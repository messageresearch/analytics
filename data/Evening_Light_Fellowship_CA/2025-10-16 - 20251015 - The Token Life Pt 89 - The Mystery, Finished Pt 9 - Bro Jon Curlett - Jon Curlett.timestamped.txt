[40:32] Lord, it's our prayer tonight.
[40:35] Lord, as we walk through life,
[40:38] Lord, things get tough, things get
[40:39] tight, things get hard.
[40:44] Lord, that we be able to go back to this
[40:46] song, this thought,
[40:48] Lord, that you're in it whether we can
[40:51] see you or not, whether we can feel you
[40:54] or not, Lord. Not knowing what lies
[40:57] ahead, Lord, but trusting you that your
[40:59] grace will take us through, Lord, that
[41:02] all things work together for our good,
[41:05] Lord, and that there's a wonderful end
[41:07] for us at the end of it all, Lord.
[41:09] There's an expected end,
[41:12] Lord. There's something that you
[41:13] prepared for us, Lord, that requires
[41:16] that we go through it, Lord. And in the
[41:19] end, we'll be better for it, heavenly
[41:20] father. Lord, help us to remember that
[41:23] each day, Lord, in the good times. Thank
[41:25] you for it. In the bad times, thank you
[41:27] for the same, Lord. Because we know in
[41:29] the end, it's you that's working in our
[41:31] lives, Lord. We're in the palm of your
[41:32] hands. Nothing can touch us, Lord,
[41:34] except you allow it, Lord. So bless us,
[41:37] Lord. Thank you for this song service
[41:38] this evening, Lord. Lord, thank you for
[41:41] the word you've given me, Lord. I pray
[41:43] it would just strike our hearts and our
[41:45] souls, Lord, that it would go, Lord, to
[41:47] the very depths of our being tonight,
[41:49] Lord. That we could take it in faith,
[41:50] Lord, and apply it. Be with us, Lord. We
[41:53] pray. those that are here, those that
[41:55] aren't, Lord. Each one, Lord. Those that
[41:57] are listening, wherever they may be,
[41:58] Lord, we pray a grace to them. Each one,
[42:01] thanking you for your goodness, Lord,
[42:02] thanking you for your promise that
[42:04] you'll never leave us or forsake us. Be
[42:06] with us now, Lord Jesus. We ask in Jesus
[42:08] Christ's name we pray it. Amen. And
[42:11] amen. God bless you. Good to see each
[42:14] one this evening. Let's turn, if we can,

[42:19] Amen. Uh certainly want to remember my
[42:22] wife and Samuel are home. He had a
[42:24] allergic reaction. We're not sure to
[42:26] what exactly. We think we might know,

[42:29] going down very quickly. So, he's very
[42:31] itchy and he's got hives all over his
[42:33] body. So, we want to remember him
[42:36] especially. Amen. I'm excited to preach
[42:39] this evening. I've got some
[42:40] encouragement coming your way. It may
[42:41] not seem that way from the first little
[42:43] bit, but I've got some encouragement
[42:45] coming your way. So, I'm glad to be here
[42:47] tonight. It's always good to preach good
[42:49] things. You know, it's not easy to
[42:50] preach it when you you think you're
[42:52] correcting or or whatever, but boy, when
[42:54] you got something that if we can sink
[42:56] our teeth into, it's going to be good.
[42:57] Then you're always glad to be a
[42:58] preacher. Amen. I certainly didn't want
[43:02] to be here tonight. I wanted to be
[43:04] taking my rest yet again so that we
[43:07] could get ready for the special
[43:09] meetings, but brother Aaron had a kind
[43:10] of a semi-serious uh incident and health
[43:14] incident and uh he's waiting on surgery
[43:17] and it could happen any day. And he was
[43:18] going to grit it through, but on the
[43:21] advice of his pastor, he's not going to
[43:22] do that. And we certainly don't want him
[43:24] up here needing surgery. So, we're going
[43:26] to put that off. He uh he'll come maybe
[43:28] sometime in the new year, Lord willing.
[43:30] But in the meantime, I have tentatively
[43:32] booked another minister for November
[43:34] 28th through the 30th. I know that's
[43:36] still 6 weeks out yet again. I
[43:38] apologize. I'm doing everything I can.
[43:40] I'm just trusting the Lord has a plan in
[43:42] it. Amen. That's all we can do. But this
[43:44] is a a brother that I've known for many,
[43:47] many years. He goes to my old home
[43:49] church down in Dallas, Texas. A
[43:50] wonderful, wonderful preacher, a a
[43:53] humble man, a sincere man. And I know
[43:55] he'll fit in just like he comes from
[43:58] Newfoundland when he comes. So Lord
[43:59] willing, he's going to confirm with me
[44:01] next week. He's traveling to London uh
[44:03] today uh London in the UK uh for
[44:06] business and then he's coming back and
[44:07] he'll be able to confirm then. But we
[44:09] look forward to that. Trusting the Lord
[44:11] will get us into some special meetings
[44:12] here one way or another. Otherwise, it's
[44:14] just going to be me and Brother Grant.
[44:15] We're just going to tag team it through
[44:17] a weekend just to say we had special
[44:18] meetings, I think. But again, the Lord
[44:21] knows and we just have to trust that.
[44:23] Amen. We've had many disappointments
[44:24] this year when it, you know, with this
[44:26] set of services with brother Aaron and
[44:28] we're just trusting the Lord's got a
[44:29] hand in it and uh and that it's not our
[44:32] fault or anybody's fault. It's just he's
[44:34] working things for our good. Amen.
[44:36] Matthew 22 says this and says, "Then one
[44:40] of them which was a lawyer asked him a
[44:42] question, tempting him and saying,
[44:43] Master, which is the great commandment
[44:45] in the law?" Jesus said unto him, "Thou
[44:48] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[44:50] heart, with all thy soul, and with all
[44:53] thy mind. This is the first and great
[44:56] commandment." Amen. God bless you. You
[44:58] can have your seats. And we're
[45:00] continuing our series on the Holy Ghost.
[45:02] And this idea of the mystery, finished,
[45:04] the revealing of Christ in his church.
[45:06] And we've been talking about the
[45:07] preeminence. And this idea of the
[45:09] preeminence is really the the final key,
[45:11] I believe, to what we're talking about.
[45:13] Because when we look at something being
[45:15] revealed, a mystery being finished, a
[45:16] mystery being revealed, if it's been
[45:18] hidden, then what's been underneath all
[45:20] that time has to come through. And when
[45:22] it's Christ being revealed, that means
[45:23] he's got to have the preeminence. Amen.
[45:25] I don't think he can be revealed if
[45:27] we've got the preeminence. It's got to
[45:28] be him that has the preeminence in our
[45:30] lives. And so, if there's one thing I
[45:32] want to start the service out with this
[45:33] evening, it's that preeminence is not
[45:35] lip service. Amen. Preeminence is not
[45:37] just about how we talk by any means.
[45:40] talking about God, talking about the
[45:41] goodness of God, talking about the
[45:43] things God's done for you, talking about
[45:44] how much you love God. We ought to do
[45:46] those things. Amen. We ought to we ought
[45:48] to have a positive testimony. We ought
[45:50] to be able to talk about the good things
[45:52] of God. Amen. But that is not giving God
[45:54] the preeminence. That's a part of it,
[45:56] but it's not certainly the thing that
[45:58] we're talking about here tonight. Amen.
[46:00] Talk is cheap. I think we've all learned
[46:01] that by now. Even dealing with
[46:03] believers, talk is cheap. Professing
[46:05] believers, talk is cheap. But I want to
[46:07] open with something that Jesus said. And
[46:08] I warned you the beginning is not going
[46:10] to be so positive because we always have
[46:12] the anti-ype and then we have the type.
[46:13] Amen. We've got the thing that's on it
[46:15] looks right but it's wrong. And then
[46:17] we've got the thing that maybe looks
[46:18] wrong but it is right if we're looking
[46:20] at our natural lives. And so I want to
[46:22] just take what Jesus said here and
[46:24] remember who he was speaking to. He was
[46:26] talking to the religious leaders and and
[46:28] the religious people. And he says thus
[46:31] have ye made the commandment of men of
[46:33] none effect by your tradition. That word
[46:36] none effect there means disanold. You've
[46:38] made a void. You've invalidated the word
[46:40] of God. You've taken away its impact and
[46:42] its application in your life as it was
[46:44] intended. He says by how? By your
[46:47] tradition. Then he says, "You
[46:48] hypocrites." What's a hypocrite?
[46:51] Somebody that says one thing and does
[46:54] another. That's why I say talk is cheap.
[46:56] You can talk all you want. It's what you
[46:58] do that God really cares about. Amen. He
[47:00] says, "You hypocrites, well did Isaiah
[47:02] prophesy of you, saying, this people
[47:05] drawth nigh unto me with their mouth and
[47:07] honorth me with their lips, but their
[47:09] heart is far from me." So Jesus analysis
[47:12] of this group of people of that age,
[47:15] even if we could put it that way, is
[47:17] that they talked a good talk, but they
[47:19] couldn't walk the good walk. Their mouth
[47:21] said the right things, their lips said
[47:23] the right things, but when it came to
[47:25] the word, they take it and they twist it
[47:27] for their own benefit. And he said, 'In
[47:30] doing so, you've made it of no effect.
[47:33] Because we've got to remember the word
[47:34] is God's thoughts. It's God's
[47:35] intentions. It's God's plan. And it's
[47:38] for our benefit that he gives it to us.
[47:40] But remember, you can't add one word to
[47:42] it and you can't take one word from it.
[47:44] Otherwise, it loses its power. And
[47:46] that's what he's saying is you tried to
[47:48] take it, you tried to take something
[47:49] that was for your benefit and twist it
[47:52] in a way you thought was good, and you
[47:54] actually lost the benefit. You took the
[47:56] best thing that God could give us, which
[47:58] was his word, and you twisted it for
[48:00] yourself. And in doing so, you lost its
[48:04] effect. And he says, "What's the effect
[48:06] of it now?" He says, "Your heart, your
[48:08] your inner desires, your real
[48:10] intentions, your real goals, your your
[48:12] real plans, they're far away from mine.
[48:14] They in no way match up with what I
[48:16] intended." Amen. Can you imagine hearing
[48:18] that from God in flesh? What an
[48:21] indictment. What a judgment that would
[48:22] be to have God come up and say, "You
[48:24] know what? You talk one way, but in
[48:26] reality, your heart is far from me. You
[48:28] have no relationship with me. You're not
[48:30] even close to me. You have no idea. And
[48:33] who is it he was talking to?
[48:35] Critics.
[48:37] It's the critics that do this. It's the
[48:40] critics that can't shut up. It's the
[48:43] critics that keep poking and poking and
[48:46] pointing and pointing and trying to pin
[48:48] you down here and pin you down there.
[48:49] And I found one thing. It's the critics
[48:51] that have the least to offer when the
[48:53] push comes to shove. The reason they can
[48:56] talk is because there's no focus on
[48:58] their own life. Amen. Critics rarely
[49:01] have a life comparable to those they're
[49:03] even criticizing. They usually have the
[49:05] skeletons in the closet. The scripture
[49:07] bears it out. And I think real life
[49:09] bears that out. And I want to kind of
[49:11] take us down a road of of what this
[49:13] looks like because we look at critics,
[49:15] we look at hypocrites, we look and those
[49:17] are people that talk one way and live
[49:19] another. And I think one of the greatest
[49:20] examples of this that we can see in
[49:22] scripture is the rich young ruler
[49:24] because we're taking this series now
[49:26] into where rubber meets the road. This
[49:28] is getting real personal and it's going
[49:30] to stay personal till we close it out by
[49:32] God's grace. But we look at that rich
[49:34] young ruler. He lived a good life. He
[49:37] was well thought of by people. He had a
[49:39] good career. He was kind to his parents.
[49:41] Well spoken of in church. He went to
[49:43] church.
[49:44] Brother says when he died, no doubt the
[49:46] priest was there saying what a great man
[49:49] he was. And no doubt he was in the
[49:50] presence of God. All these different
[49:52] things. Amen. And yet internally for all
[49:55] of those good works, for all of that
[49:56] good life, internally there was
[49:58] something that was unsettled in that
[50:00] man.
[50:02] Something wasn't settled in his life.
[50:04] And we see what happened. Amen. I want
[50:06] to read the scripture that tells this
[50:08] little story a bit. But I want you to
[50:10] see something that with preeminence,
[50:11] it's all or nothing.
[50:14] It's not a halfway. It's not a 3/4 way.
[50:17] It's not a 90% way. It's 100% or it's
[50:20] nothing. You cannot have two masters.
[50:23] You can only have one master. And so
[50:24] with preeminence in our lives, that
[50:26] means there's only one in charge. It's
[50:29] not me plus one. It's not one plus me.
[50:33] It's one only. And it's God or it's
[50:36] nobody else or somebody else, I should
[50:38] say. Amen. We can say we'll give it, but
[50:40] the question is, will we actually give
[50:42] it? And look at this rich young ruler.
[50:44] By all appearances, by all uh influence
[50:48] that he had, his his his reputation was
[50:51] stellar. The rich young ruler was
[50:54] everything we would want our sons and
[50:55] daughters to be, if I put it that way.
[50:58] Isn't it? He was everything that we want
[51:00] our young people to be. But I want you
[51:02] to catch something. It says, "And when
[51:04] he was gone forth into his way, Jesus
[51:06] was walking now. There came one running
[51:08] and kneelled to him and asked him, "Good
[51:10] master, what shall I do that I may
[51:12] inherit eternal life?" I want you to see
[51:15] something, church. He didn't send a
[51:16] servant to Jesus. He didn't come riding
[51:19] up regally on his donkey or his horse.
[51:21] He came running.
[51:24] That wasn't very dignified in those
[51:26] days. A rich young ruler, somebody that
[51:29] was used to other people running to him,
[51:31] he came running. He showed a desire. He
[51:34] humbled himself by running to Jesus
[51:36] rather than calling Jesus to him. And
[51:38] what does he say? He says, "Good master,
[51:41] what shall I do that I may inherit
[51:42] eternal life?" He gives Jesus the title
[51:44] that belongs to only the best of the
[51:46] best teachers. We'd say today he gives
[51:48] Jesus his due. He gives Jesus the honor
[51:51] that's that he's worthy of. He gives him
[51:52] public recognition. So his approach is
[51:55] perfect, church. His approach is
[51:58] perfect. And Jesus said unto him, "Why
[52:00] callst thou me good? There is none good
[52:03] but one that is God. Jesus is testing
[52:05] his revelation.
[52:07] Are you just talking to me or do you
[52:10] really mean what you say? He says, "Thou
[52:13] knowest the commandments. Do not commit
[52:15] adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do
[52:17] not bear false witness. Defraud not.
[52:19] Honor thy father and mother." And he
[52:21] answered and said unto him, "Master, all
[52:23] these have I observed from my youth."
[52:26] Now church, Jesus never challenges him
[52:29] on what he said there.
[52:31] Jesus takes him at his word. We could
[52:33] say Jesus believes him. Jesus, knowing
[52:35] all things, does not go into his life
[52:36] and say anything to him. He leaves it
[52:39] right there. He accepts it at face
[52:41] value. He takes it. Amen. But remember,
[52:43] church, we're dealing with the spirit of
[52:45] truth.
[52:47] And so, the spirit of truth is not here
[52:49] just to pat us on our back and say,
[52:51] "Good boy, good girl. You've done such a
[52:54] good job." But the spirit of truth is
[52:55] there to lead us to eternal life. And
[52:59] when you come to the spirit of truth,
[53:01] it's going to tell the truth. It can't
[53:03] do anything other than that. Amen. Why?
[53:05] Because the Holy Spirit is sent to
[53:06] prepare a bride for a wedding. And
[53:09] before she can be married, she's got to
[53:11] meet his requirements. He's got to be
[53:13] able to look at her and say, "Well done.
[53:16] You're exactly what I anticipated.
[53:18] You're exactly what I was looking for."
[53:20] Amen. We've got to meet his approval,
[53:22] not our approval. We're in a world today
[53:25] where self approval is the only thing
[53:26] that seems to matter. church. It's his
[53:28] approval or it's none. Our approval gets
[53:31] us nowhere. Now watch this. Jesus
[53:34] beholding him loved him.
[53:38] And he said unto him, "One thing thou
[53:42] lackest."
[53:44] Jesus never said what he said to this
[53:46] man to anyone else.
[53:48] Why? It's an individual affair and it's
[53:52] personal.
[53:55] Listen, God may cause brother Chad to
[53:58] give up something he never calls me to
[54:00] give up.
[54:02] You young women may not have to give up
[54:05] what sister Morin and Sister Brenda gave
[54:07] up because you're born into this message
[54:09] in terms of the acceptance of it and
[54:11] these different things. Listen, some of
[54:13] us are going to have to pay prices that
[54:14] others don't.
[54:16] But it's for our good. It's always for
[54:21] our good. Amen. Jesus said one thing
[54:23] thou lackest. This is your issue. This
[54:26] is why you don't have peace.
[54:30] He says go thy well way sell whatsoever
[54:33] thou hast and give it to the poor and
[54:36] thou shalt have treasure in heaven and
[54:38] come take up the cross and follow me.
[54:40] Jesus did not say sell all that thou
[54:42] have give it to the poor take up your
[54:45] cross and follow me. That's not what he
[54:47] said.
[54:48] He said, "Sell all that thou hast give
[54:50] to the poor, and thou shalt have
[54:53] treasure in heaven,
[54:55] and take up thy cross, and follow me."
[54:57] See, church, God God doesn't just take
[54:59] take take take.
[55:02] Sometimes it might seem that we go
[55:05] through dark seasons. We go through
[55:06] valleys. And it seems like all he's
[55:08] doing is taking and taking, taking.
[55:10] Seems like all we're doing is taking
[55:13] punches and giving this up and giving
[55:15] that up. and everyone's getting what
[55:17] they need and we're not getting what we
[55:18] need, it seems. But he never said, "Give
[55:22] everything you've got and take nothing."
[55:24] He didn't say, "Give everything you've
[55:26] got and take up your burden." He said,
[55:27] "Give everything you've got. I'll give
[55:29] you something in the future. Now take up
[55:31] your cross."
[55:33] What was he doing, church? He was
[55:36] challenging his words with action.
[55:39] He was saying, "Let's put your faith
[55:41] where your mouth is.
[55:43] Let's put your question into the
[55:46] sincerity bank and see if it cashes out.
[55:49] Do you really mean what you're asking?
[55:50] Are you really wanting eternal life or
[55:52] are you just wanting me to pat you on
[55:54] the back? Are you just wanting me to
[55:56] affirm everything you've done so far?
[55:59] Listen, church, he had a question.
[56:02] He couldn't even affirm himself. Why was
[56:04] he looking for Jesus to do it?
[56:07] He needed something settled in his
[56:09] heart.
[56:12] He was challenging this young man to put
[56:15] his revelation into action. How faithful
[56:18] obedience to the word for himself.
[56:21] That's what he was looking for. But look
[56:23] at his response. And he was sad at that
[56:26] saying and went away grieved for he had
[56:30] great possessions. He valued what he had
[56:33] more than what he could get.
[56:36] Now, we look at that young man and we
[56:38] see he's in the same condition as those
[56:40] Pharisees and those Sadducees and those
[56:41] hypocrites. His mouth was saying all the
[56:44] right things and the surface of that man
[56:46] was perfect Christian.
[56:49] We'd love to have a man like that in our
[56:50] churches. We would say did everything
[56:52] right, said everything right,
[56:54] dependable, generous, kind, polite,
[56:59] a great churchgoer, a great benchwarmer,
[57:02] lots of tithes and offerings. But when
[57:05] God got personal with him, he turned it
[57:08] down. The price was too great. Amen. And
[57:12] what do we see? His talk was cheaper
[57:14] than his value for his eternal life. He
[57:17] couldn't put the two together. Amen. As
[57:18] soon as that word of God made him
[57:20] uncomfortable,
[57:21] as soon as that word of God made him
[57:23] common,
[57:26] he's like everyone else. church.
[57:33] We go to school. We get our careers. We
[57:37] make our money. We have our looks. I'm
[57:40] not talking about me. I'm spreading this
[57:41] out over the church clearly.
[57:44] We all have something we think's of
[57:46] great value.
[57:48] And you know what God will do? He'll
[57:50] say, "Lay it down. Become like the rest
[57:52] of him." When you look at Jesus
[57:54] followers, what does he have? fisherman,
[57:57] ignorant, unlearned, uncouy,
[58:04] stinky, and sweaty. And this rich young
[58:07] ruler in his perfect robes with all of
[58:09] his money, bathed every day, no doubt.
[58:12] Had the mo the the best smelling cologne
[58:14] that money could buy, had a wonderful
[58:17] bed to go to sleep on every night, air
[58:19] conditioned house.
[58:21] And he says, "Come here and identify
[58:24] yourself with a bunch of commoners."
[58:28] Sometimes that's the hardest thing. Be
[58:30] like everyone else. Lose your identity.
[58:35] Lose what makes you different. Lose your
[58:37] comfort.
[58:39] Lose your superiority.
[58:41] He had everything, church. And Jesus
[58:43] said, "Lay it down and come be like the
[58:44] rest of us."
[58:47] Why? Because there's something waiting
[58:48] that's much better than what you have
[58:50] here, son. And what did he do? He said,
[58:52] 'I'd too much. Scripture says he went
[58:55] away grieved. And the meaning of that
[58:58] original word is a cloud came over his
[59:01] face. Now, have you ever seen somebody
[59:04] crestfallen?
[59:06] Maybe you've seen it with your children
[59:08] when they're opening a gift and they
[59:10] think it's going to be one thing that's
[59:11] really great and they open it up and
[59:12] it's socks and underwear
[59:15] and they kind of smile, but their face
[59:17] goes crestfallen, doesn't it?
[59:20] because it's not what they're expecting.
[59:22] But this is beyond crestfallen. It's
[59:24] it's like a stormy cloud came over him.
[59:28] He wasn't just gloomy. He was sullen.
[59:32] He wasn't happy with how he'd been put
[59:35] in a box and it didn't work out for him.
[59:39] Amen. He was like a storm cloud now.
[59:42] Dark, forbidding.
[59:45] You wouldn't want to be around him after
[59:47] this conversation. In other words, amen.
[59:49] He didn't leave in a good move. He got
[59:51] He was He thought he was going to get an
[59:52] answer that let him keep his lifestyle
[59:56] and take him into eternal life. What was
[59:59] he expecting? He was expecting I can add
[1:00:02] to what I have,
[1:00:04] not lose what I've got. Amen. Jesus
[1:00:07] said, "Lay your lifestyle down
[1:00:08] completely. Come follow me and I'll give
[1:00:10] you something you've never expected in
[1:00:12] the end."
[1:00:13] He knew so much, church. He acted so
[1:00:16] well. He talked so well, but when the
[1:00:19] word of God came his way for him
[1:00:21] personally, he said, "Sorry, not
[1:00:23] interested."
[1:00:26] It's a shame, you know, David had given
[1:00:28] him instruction in the Psalms by the
[1:00:30] Holy Spirit. Psalms 119 says this,
[1:00:32] "Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse
[1:00:35] his way?" It says, "By taking heed
[1:00:38] thereof according to thy word." Says,
[1:00:43] "How shall a young man cleanse his way?"
[1:00:45] How shall a young man make his way
[1:00:46] clean? To make it pure, make it clear,
[1:00:50] make it blameless. In other words, how
[1:00:51] can a young man live a blameless life?
[1:00:53] And it doesn't just apply to young men.
[1:00:55] It applies to all of us. He says by
[1:00:57] taking heed thereto. And the root of
[1:01:00] heed is hedge. And it means literally by
[1:01:03] building a hedge around his way
[1:01:06] according to what? Thy word. By building
[1:01:10] a hedge around his life of the word of
[1:01:13] God. It's not by going out and and
[1:01:15] applying Dave Ramsey's money management
[1:01:18] principles.
[1:01:20] Not by reading Dale Carnegy's seven ways
[1:01:22] to influence people and make friends.
[1:01:25] It's not by going to church. Those are
[1:01:28] all good things perhaps, but that's not
[1:01:30] how we have a life that's pleasing to
[1:01:33] God. He says you've got to build a hedge
[1:01:35] around it. Now, we don't have a lot
[1:01:36] about hedges here in Newfoundland, and
[1:01:38] these days they're kind of a thing of
[1:01:40] the past. You know, mostly they're
[1:01:41] decorative shrubbing that's around the
[1:01:43] perimeter of a property or something,
[1:01:45] but it's not something that's constant.
[1:01:47] But in the old days, hedges were used
[1:01:49] everywhere and they were used to protect
[1:01:52] a road. And this is one that they have
[1:01:54] over in the UK if I'm not mistaken. I
[1:01:56] just grabbed it off of the internet, but
[1:01:58] they were used as a protection. And the
[1:02:00] main thing was to keep it clear for
[1:02:02] what? For animals, for one thing, but
[1:02:04] two, to keep people off that you didn't
[1:02:06] want on it. It was to maintain your
[1:02:08] property boundaries as well. Hedges were
[1:02:11] there to protect something of value. And
[1:02:13] so they put up these hedges. And you
[1:02:15] look at something like that, you look
[1:02:16] how thick it is. You look at how tall it
[1:02:18] is. You can't climb over it. Going
[1:02:20] through it, you're going to get real
[1:02:22] uncomfortable. And actually here, it's
[1:02:24] not just about hedges, but it's it means
[1:02:26] thorny hedges. In other words, surround
[1:02:29] your life with the word that's so
[1:02:31] prickly and hard for enemies to go
[1:02:33] through it that they just don't try and
[1:02:35] get through anymore. They completely
[1:02:37] give it up. Amen. We look at that hedge
[1:02:39] there and I tell you this, I wouldn't
[1:02:41] want to go through it. I wouldn't even
[1:02:43] want to go through it when it occur
[1:02:45] because it's thick. It's woven tight.
[1:02:47] Everything's That's the way a hedge
[1:02:49] works. It's not just individual strands,
[1:02:51] but it's all interwoven. It's like a
[1:02:54] fabric that's on the side of the road.
[1:02:56] It's like an armored tree fabric that's
[1:02:58] around the sides of the road to keep
[1:02:59] everything out that you don't want to.
[1:03:01] And they can only come in by the gates
[1:03:02] that you open up. Okay?
[1:03:06] Now, the Holy Spirit speaking through
[1:03:07] David says, "Protect your life's way
[1:03:10] with a hedge of the word of God. Make it
[1:03:14] tight. Make it thick." Amen. Now, you
[1:03:15] look at that hedge. Did that grow up
[1:03:17] overnight.
[1:03:20] How effective was that hedge when they
[1:03:22] first planted it, do you think? Because
[1:03:24] you don't plant a hedge this tall. You
[1:03:27] got to plant it and you got to commit to
[1:03:29] it. You got to cultivate it. You got to
[1:03:32] work it.
[1:03:34] You got to commit to having a hedge to
[1:03:37] get a hedge. You got to build line upon
[1:03:40] line, word upon word word. You can't
[1:03:43] just say, "I believe the word and go."
[1:03:44] No, you got to commit to it. You got to
[1:03:46] apply it to your life. Every part of it.
[1:03:48] Amen. If you want it to work, you got to
[1:03:50] apply it. You got to commit to it every
[1:03:52] step of the road that you're on.
[1:03:55] Otherwise, anyone can get in anywhere.
[1:03:58] Amen. What if you have a place where you
[1:04:00] didn't plant a hedge?
[1:04:03] I found a picture and you see there to
[1:04:06] the left and to the right is a hedge.
[1:04:07] But what did they do in the middle
[1:04:08] church? They said, "I'll just plant a
[1:04:12] couple trees." You know why? Cuz they're
[1:04:14] easy.
[1:04:17] But look at there.
[1:04:19] How do you think those trees would work
[1:04:21] to stop someone come from coming
[1:04:23] through? The right side, the left side,
[1:04:25] that's real hedges. But in the middle
[1:04:27] there and those trees, I don't care how
[1:04:29] big they are, you're going to be able to
[1:04:30] push through them, aren't you? Anything
[1:04:32] can get through those trees. If it has
[1:04:34] even a little bit of inclination to get
[1:04:36] through, a person can get through there.
[1:04:38] Robbers, thieves, a cow, whatever. It's
[1:04:41] just going to push right through that.
[1:04:42] It's not even going to slow it down. And
[1:04:44] so, what do you have? You have a weak
[1:04:46] link now in the hedge because you've
[1:04:48] decided you didn't need to fill up that
[1:04:49] gap.
[1:04:52] Amen.
[1:04:54] And you can get a stream of people
[1:04:55] through there, stream of animals. Once
[1:04:58] they figure out where your weakness is,
[1:05:00] they just start rolling through it
[1:05:02] anytime, day and night. Why? Cuz we
[1:05:05] didn't commit to the hedge. We didn't
[1:05:08] commit to protecting our way that we're
[1:05:09] told we were supposed to do it. You know
[1:05:13] who has to guard that church?
[1:05:15] If the hedge doesn't guard it, who's
[1:05:17] left?
[1:05:19] This little guy.
[1:05:21] And let me tell you, he ain't good
[1:05:22] enough to do it. That's why we needed
[1:05:24] the word in the first place. Amen. If
[1:05:27] I'm guarding my road, it's because I
[1:05:29] haven't applied the word. And the word's
[1:05:31] the only thing that's going to protect
[1:05:32] me. And so now I've got to stand there
[1:05:35] and guard that day and night. And you
[1:05:37] know what that means? I can't move on
[1:05:40] cuz I've got holes in my past.
[1:05:43] I've got chinks in my armor that I
[1:05:45] haven't closed up. And so now I'm too
[1:05:48] busy trying to figure out where all
[1:05:50] these animals are coming from. How'd
[1:05:52] these people get on my property? because
[1:05:54] I didn't put a hedge around my life
[1:05:55] according to the word. What's the
[1:05:58] solution to this, church? Commit
[1:06:00] yourself to doing the hedge.
[1:06:03] Go back and do the harder work. Commit
[1:06:06] yourself to applying the word to your
[1:06:08] life. Amen. For every stage of your
[1:06:10] life, to every circumstance, church,
[1:06:12] it's never too late to do the right
[1:06:14] thing.
[1:06:15] When it comes to a believer, it's never
[1:06:17] too late to go back to the word. It's
[1:06:19] never too late to say, "I can close that
[1:06:22] up if I'll just take the word." Amen.
[1:06:25] David will continue in Psalms 119. He
[1:06:27] says, "With my whole heart,
[1:06:31] a whole heart that is seeking
[1:06:35] will always apply the word of God."
[1:06:40] He says, "With my whole heart have I
[1:06:42] sought thee. Oh, let me not wander from
[1:06:45] what? Thy commandments."
[1:06:50] doesn't say, "Let me not wander from my
[1:06:52] thoughts, my ideas, my desires." It
[1:06:55] says, "From thy commandments." And he
[1:06:56] confirms it. Thy word have I hid in mine
[1:06:59] heart that I might not sin against thee.
[1:07:02] So, how do we know that we've given God
[1:07:03] the preeminence, church? How do we know
[1:07:05] that? With our whole heart, we're
[1:07:06] seeking him.
[1:07:08] Thy word have I hid in my heart. Amen.
[1:07:10] The word has the preeminence. And how do
[1:07:13] we know that? We put it into action in
[1:07:15] our lives. Amen. No matter the cost, no
[1:07:18] matter the consequences, no matter the
[1:07:19] hardship, no matter the discomfort.
[1:07:21] Amen. No matter the separation, no
[1:07:23] matter the hurt, no matter the struggle,
[1:07:25] we'll apply the word. We'll take it over
[1:07:28] everything else. We're going to see that
[1:07:29] as we go through tonight. Brother Brown
[1:07:31] would say this. He says, "That's the
[1:07:32] only way you can do a right kind of a
[1:07:34] job for the Lord is to put everything
[1:07:37] you got right to the forefront for
[1:07:39] Christ.
[1:07:41] Excuse me. all your strength,
[1:07:44] all your soul, all your heart, all your
[1:07:48] mind, everything you've got. He says,
[1:07:50] when you're doing anything, do it right
[1:07:52] or don't do it at all. See, just leave
[1:07:53] it alone.
[1:07:55] If you're going to be a Christian, put
[1:07:58] everything you've got to Christ. He
[1:08:00] says, that's your time, your talent,
[1:08:03] your everything.
[1:08:05] Now, I'll tell you what, most of us are
[1:08:07] pretty good at talent.
[1:08:09] Yeah, I'll use it for the Lord. We've
[1:08:11] got people up here song leading. We got
[1:08:12] people up here playing music. We've got
[1:08:14] people that are preaching. We got people
[1:08:16] serving offices. We got people that are
[1:08:17] cleaning. We got people that are
[1:08:18] helping. We've got all those things. We
[1:08:20] got all that talent. We got people
[1:08:21] working jobs. We got people paying
[1:08:23] tithe. But what about your time?
[1:08:26] That's the killer these days, church,
[1:08:28] cuz Satan can fill our time faster than
[1:08:31] we can shake our heads.
[1:08:33] That's what he's trying to do. Fill our
[1:08:35] time. He says, "That's your time, your
[1:08:37] talent, your everything." Now, we ended
[1:08:40] the last service with this quote, and
[1:08:41] we're we're we're really getting to
[1:08:43] rubber meets the road here where we're
[1:08:45] getting personal. I want to read it one
[1:08:46] more time as we set up for this the last
[1:08:48] portion of the service this morning,
[1:08:50] this evening. He says, "What can you
[1:08:52] give?" God will receive what you'll
[1:08:54] give, but God wants all of you. He wants
[1:08:57] every bit of you. He wants all. He wants
[1:09:00] everything you are. He wants your life.
[1:09:03] He wants your testimony. And that's
[1:09:05] really where we're going to go tonight.
[1:09:06] He wants your testimony. He wants every
[1:09:09] minute you live. God help us. He says he
[1:09:14] wants you to live right, act right, talk
[1:09:17] right, do right. He wants everything
[1:09:20] perfectly surrendered to him for what
[1:09:22] purpose? That he can lead you and guide
[1:09:25] you and put you into the places he want
[1:09:28] where he wants you to go. You'll be led
[1:09:31] of the spirit.
[1:09:34] Where does he want us to go, church?
[1:09:37] That's really the question I've got for
[1:09:39] us tonight. Where does God want us to
[1:09:40] go? Where's he taking us? What should we
[1:09:43] be looking for? What are we to be
[1:09:44] expecting of where God's taking us? Is
[1:09:47] anybody else interested in that? I want
[1:09:50] to know where God's taking us. Me and
[1:09:52] Brother Joe. Good. We'll continue. We've
[1:09:53] got a we've got a quorum of two here
[1:09:55] tonight. I want to know what God has for
[1:09:57] me. The lovely thing is we've got
[1:10:00] something that tells us exactly what he
[1:10:02] has for us. Amen.
[1:10:04] I want to know what he has for me. I
[1:10:06] still think this is one of the most
[1:10:08] beautiful scriptures to any believer. He
[1:10:10] says this in Jeremiah, for I Jeremiah,
[1:10:13] for I know the thoughts that I think
[1:10:15] towards you, sayeth the Lord. Thoughts
[1:10:18] of peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:10:21] expected end. Church, that's a very
[1:10:23] strange thing to say. Why does he just
[1:10:25] say thoughts of peace to give you an
[1:10:27] expected end? Why does he say and not of
[1:10:29] evil?
[1:10:31] Because sometimes it's going to look
[1:10:32] like evil.
[1:10:35] It's going to start out looking like
[1:10:36] it's a bad thing for you. It's going to
[1:10:39] start out looking like it's Satan
[1:10:41] working in your life, not God working in
[1:10:43] your life. It's going to look like pain
[1:10:46] and hurt and suffering and separation
[1:10:48] and hardship and sleepless nights and
[1:10:51] poor health.
[1:10:54] Why? Cuz he wants your testimony.
[1:10:58] Amen. He says, "Then shall ye call upon
[1:11:01] me, and you shall go and pray unto me,
[1:11:04] and I will hearken unto you." Look at
[1:11:05] Joseph.
[1:11:07] We're going to preach on Joseph in a
[1:11:09] couple weeks.
[1:11:10] Look at Joseph. Thoughts of peace and
[1:11:14] not of evil. And all he had was a
[1:11:16] continuous downward slide in a harder
[1:11:18] and harder life. Amen.
[1:11:21] All for what? To give him his promised
[1:11:23] end. Amen. He says, "And you shall seek
[1:11:26] me and find me when ye shall search for
[1:11:29] me." How?
[1:11:32] With all your heart.
[1:11:36] Church, do we have a part to play? We've
[1:11:39] got a part to play. The answer is yes.
[1:11:41] We've got a part to play. He's looking
[1:11:42] for a people that will search for him
[1:11:44] with all their heart. What's he pointing
[1:11:47] to? He's pointing to a place where
[1:11:48] Christ would have the preeminence.
[1:11:52] with our whole heart. We're seeking
[1:11:53] where our hearts would finally agree
[1:11:55] with our mouths. He's had the mouths for
[1:11:58] a long time. It's the hearts he's
[1:12:00] looking for for a people that'll seek
[1:12:01] after him with everything that's inside.
[1:12:03] And God would look at us and he say
[1:12:05] they're pure because their heart and
[1:12:07] their mouth both say the same thing.
[1:12:09] They line up with the word of God.
[1:12:12] How do we get there?
[1:12:15] Cleanse our way. Build a hedge of the
[1:12:17] word around our life. Amen. Spiritled
[1:12:20] according to the word. Paul would say
[1:12:22] this. He says, "All scripture,
[1:12:25] the word is given by inspiration of God
[1:12:28] and is profitable for doctrine, for
[1:12:31] reproof, for correction, for instruction
[1:12:33] in righteousness." Church, this word
[1:12:35] will do a lot for you.
[1:12:38] It'll do a lot for you. It'll take you
[1:12:40] far, but you got to accept it for all
[1:12:42] that it offers.
[1:12:44] Sometimes we're coming looking for
[1:12:46] encouragement, and we really need the
[1:12:47] the correction more than we need the
[1:12:49] encouragement that morning.
[1:12:51] Sometimes we're so hard on ourselves, we
[1:12:53] can't receive the encouragement.
[1:12:55] Sometimes we're looking at the wrong
[1:12:56] thing and we don't see ourselves and so
[1:12:58] he's got to lift us up. But I'll tell
[1:13:00] you this, it has a job that it's
[1:13:02] supposed to do. And that job is in verse
[1:13:04] 17. That the man of God may be perfect.
[1:13:10] That word perfect means complete,
[1:13:12] adequate, or sufficient to the task.
[1:13:17] In other words, when God's done with
[1:13:19] you, you'll be able to do what he's put
[1:13:21] to your account. You'll be able to
[1:13:24] finish the work that he's assigned to
[1:13:26] your name. He says that the man of God
[1:13:27] may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
[1:13:30] unto all good works. In other words,
[1:13:34] we'll be matched to what we're supposed
[1:13:36] to do. Whatever he's required of us is
[1:13:39] how he'll have built us. Amen. will be
[1:13:42] built exactly for what he's got in store
[1:13:45] for us. And we're going to see that
[1:13:47] tonight, church. I'm telling you here
[1:13:49] tonight. I'm I'm jumping to the
[1:13:50] punchline. There's more to you than
[1:13:52] meets the eye. There's more to you than
[1:13:54] you think. And we'll see what God does
[1:13:56] to those that he has a high estimation
[1:13:58] of. Amen. And I was listening. Sorry.
[1:14:02] Let me read this one more thing. Amen.
[1:14:04] He says, "What? That he may be
[1:14:05] thoroughly furnished unto all good
[1:14:07] works." What are good works? Jesus said,
[1:14:09] "There's only one good, and that's God."
[1:14:11] So that means God's works,
[1:14:14] the father's business is the only thing
[1:14:16] that he's looking for us in our lives.
[1:14:17] Amen.
[1:14:19] God's got good thoughts towards us.
[1:14:22] Look at Ephesians. It says, "For we are
[1:14:24] his workmanship, created in Christ, his
[1:14:28] workmanship." Who's making this happen?
[1:14:32] It ain't me. It ain't you. It's him.
[1:14:36] He's the one that's making this happen.
[1:14:37] We are his workmanship, created in
[1:14:40] Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
[1:14:43] had before ordained that we should walk
[1:14:45] in them. Amen. God's got good thoughts
[1:14:48] towards us. We are his good thoughts.
[1:14:50] Amen. And his intention is that we
[1:14:52] should continue the very works of Christ
[1:14:54] to fulfill the word of God for our day.
[1:14:57] But what does this look like?
[1:15:00] Because this is where it all comes down
[1:15:01] to it. You say, "Do I have the Holy
[1:15:04] Ghost? How am I going to know? How do I
[1:15:06] know the spirit of God is working in my
[1:15:07] life? How do I know I'm a part of this
[1:15:09] end time bride? How do I know that he
[1:15:11] really has me as his child? I heard this
[1:15:14] this on Sunday. I heard this quote on
[1:15:16] Sunday and it was so beautiful, but it's
[1:15:18] not for the faint of heart either. Amen.
[1:15:21] Are you with me this evening? It's not
[1:15:24] for the faint of heart. The prophet of
[1:15:26] God is talking, this is in the Ephesian
[1:15:27] church age, and he's talking about the
[1:15:29] seven golden candlesticks. So that's the
[1:15:31] gentile church ages. seven gentile
[1:15:34] churches, the gentile bride out of the
[1:15:36] last 2,000 years. And he says this, he
[1:15:39] says, "The true church of Jesus Christ,
[1:15:42] the bride, is likened to pure gold. Her
[1:15:45] righteousness is his righteousness. Her
[1:15:48] attributes are his own glorious
[1:15:50] attributes. Her identity is found in
[1:15:52] him. What he is, she is to reflect." He
[1:15:57] says, "What he has, she is to manifest.
[1:16:02] He said there is no fault in her.
[1:16:08] Hallelujah. Perfect, thoroughly
[1:16:10] furnished, meeting his approval,
[1:16:13] sufficient to the task. Amen. Holy,
[1:16:17] unbelievable, unreprovable. That's what
[1:16:19] we read last service. If you remember,
[1:16:21] he says, "She is all glorious within and
[1:16:26] without." In other words, she is not a
[1:16:27] surface believer, but from the outside
[1:16:30] in, everything is the same quality and
[1:16:33] it's pure gold. He said, "From beginning
[1:16:37] to ending, she is the work of her Lord
[1:16:39] and all his works are perfect." I want
[1:16:43] you to say this this evening. I am
[1:16:45] perfect. I am perfect. Why? Because all
[1:16:50] his works are perfect.
[1:16:54] When you wake up in the morning,
[1:16:57] tomorrow morning, if you dare look in
[1:16:58] the mirror, look in the mirror and say,
[1:17:00] "You are perfect."
[1:17:03] That's a way to start your morning.
[1:17:06] That'll wake you up.
[1:17:09] I am perfect. Sister Nikki is going to
[1:17:12] do it. I can tell she's nodding her
[1:17:14] head. She's got it.
[1:17:17] Church is better than saying, "I'm a no
[1:17:21] good
[1:17:22] whatever that Satan's trying to pin on
[1:17:24] you."
[1:17:26] Say, "I am perfect because he says I'm
[1:17:30] perfect."
[1:17:32] Amen. It's not you saying it, it's him
[1:17:34] saying it. We're just repeating his word
[1:17:36] back to him. Amen. God loves for us to
[1:17:39] do that. He said, "From beginning to
[1:17:41] ending, she is the work of her Lord and
[1:17:43] all his works are perfect." In fact, in
[1:17:46] fact, in her is summed up and manifested
[1:17:50] the eternal wisdom and purpose of God
[1:17:58] in you is summed up the eternal wisdom
[1:18:02] and purpose of God. How can one fathom
[1:18:06] it? We can't. We're sitting here
[1:18:07] dumbfounded tonight.
[1:18:09] He said, "How can one understand it?
[1:18:12] Though we cannot do that, yet we accept
[1:18:14] it by faith for God has spoken it. I say
[1:18:17] hallelujah.
[1:18:19] But I want you to see how did she come
[1:18:22] to this place.
[1:18:25] How many here wants to be what this
[1:18:26] says?
[1:18:29] How many of what this thing says? All
[1:18:32] right, get ready for part two. Not only
[1:18:35] is the candlestick of gold, it is of
[1:18:38] Uhoh.
[1:18:41] I always do this to you, don't I? I get
[1:18:43] you hyped and then I tell you, you are
[1:18:47] of beaten gold.
[1:18:50] Handcrafted
[1:18:52] of beaten gold according to her
[1:18:55] blueprints which were spirit given.
[1:18:57] Church, have you noticed this? That
[1:18:59] things today don't last.
[1:19:02] Why is it? because they're always made
[1:19:04] by the lowest bidder in the most
[1:19:06] god-forsaken corner of the earth with no
[1:19:09] real intentions towards quality or
[1:19:11] longevity.
[1:19:13] You know what lasts?
[1:19:16] Things that are handbuilt,
[1:19:19] that are perfected, that are built for
[1:19:22] purpose exactly according to spec
[1:19:26] with no concern
[1:19:28] for cost nor time.
[1:19:32] You know what? Since I became a
[1:19:35] preacher,
[1:19:37] things that I used to have last a long
[1:19:41] time don't last anymore. I used to only
[1:19:44] wear dress shoes if I was on deacon duty
[1:19:46] or if I was preaching. So, not very
[1:19:49] often. And guess what? I could go to
[1:19:51] spring in the mall and pay $60 for a
[1:19:54] pair of shoes and they'd last me five or
[1:19:55] six years. You know how long they last
[1:19:57] when I wear them? a couple times a week
[1:19:59] for hours on end sweating into them
[1:20:02] months.
[1:20:04] They're not suited for the purpose.
[1:20:07] They're for the occasional shoe wearer.
[1:20:09] So, what do I do now? Now, now I don't I
[1:20:11] can't afford handbuilt shoes, don't get
[1:20:13] me wrong, but what do I do? I now buy
[1:20:15] shoes that are real leather,
[1:20:18] not pleather
[1:20:20] made in Taiwan or China by a small child
[1:20:23] at a machine in a stinky factory. Now I
[1:20:26] buy good American shoes built from long
[1:20:31] lasting materials. Shoes that can be
[1:20:33] rebuilt
[1:20:35] if I wear the soles out cuz the rest of
[1:20:38] it's good. The dayto-day may wear it out
[1:20:40] the bottoms but the rest of that shoe
[1:20:42] will last me a lifetime as long as I
[1:20:44] don't get fat.
[1:20:46] Okay.
[1:20:48] What is it? Handmade is where the
[1:20:51] quality is.
[1:20:53] And God has a bride that is his
[1:20:56] workmanship.
[1:20:57] Not sent off to China.
[1:21:00] Not given to somebody who gave him the
[1:21:02] lowest bid. He says this is too
[1:21:04] important. This is one of one. This is
[1:21:07] limited edition. There's one and done.
[1:21:10] I've got a maker.
[1:21:12] So we are handcrafted
[1:21:14] of beaten gold. Amen.
[1:21:18] He says, "Outside of her Lord and Master
[1:21:20] Jesus Christ, was ever a people so
[1:21:23] beaten and purged as the bride of Jesus
[1:21:26] Christ." And we all said, "Praise the
[1:21:29] Lord, Brother John." No.
[1:21:34] He says, "Surely she is filling up the
[1:21:36] sufferings that Christ has left behind."
[1:21:39] Now, he's talking the Ephesian church
[1:21:40] age where they literally were beaten.
[1:21:42] They literally were killed. They
[1:21:45] literally were destroyed. But don't
[1:21:47] think for a second we're not going
[1:21:48] through the same thing in a different
[1:21:50] realm.
[1:21:52] He says her goods are desoiled. Her life
[1:21:54] is in jeopardy. She's accounted as sheep
[1:21:56] for the slaughter. She's killed all the
[1:21:58] day long. She suffers much, but in it
[1:22:01] all retaliates not. Neither does she
[1:22:03] cause others to suffer. He said, "Worthy
[1:22:06] of the gospel is this lovely bride of
[1:22:09] Christ. And as gold is malleable,
[1:22:14] you can take I believe the
[1:22:18] something like an ounce of gold and it
[1:22:21] is malleable. You know what malleable
[1:22:23] means? When a metal is malleable, it
[1:22:25] means you can stretch it without it
[1:22:27] breaking. Copper is very malleable. But
[1:22:31] the most malleable of all is gold. You
[1:22:33] can take, I believe, 1 ounce of gold and
[1:22:35] stretch it something like six kilometers
[1:22:37] in a wire before it breaks.
[1:22:40] That's how much it can be stretched,
[1:22:41] without breaking.
[1:22:43] That's how much church you can take
[1:22:46] without snapping.
[1:22:49] We would think if I was up here and I
[1:22:51] had a an ounce of gold, an ounce of gold
[1:22:52] is not that much. And we started
[1:22:54] stretching, we got to the edge from here
[1:22:56] to there, you'd say, "Brother John,
[1:22:57] don't pull on it anymore." Not realizing
[1:22:59] we can go six kilometers further before
[1:23:01] we break. Why? Because we're suited to
[1:23:05] the task that he gives us. Amen.
[1:23:08] He said, "And as gold is malleable,
[1:23:11] whereas brass will break with the
[1:23:12] beating. This gold of God will bear her
[1:23:15] suffering for the Lord, not bowed, not
[1:23:18] broken, not destroyed, but formed as a
[1:23:21] thing of beauty and a joy forever by the
[1:23:25] Oh, here we go again. The trials and
[1:23:27] testing of this life." So, I've asked
[1:23:31] you the question, what does preeminence
[1:23:33] look like? It looks like applying the
[1:23:34] word to your life. Let me ask you again.
[1:23:37] What does preeminence look like?
[1:23:39] Allowing yourself to be molded and
[1:23:42] shaped
[1:23:43] without resentment or bitterness towards
[1:23:47] the things that our Lord and Savior
[1:23:49] decides are needed to get you to his
[1:23:52] finished condition.
[1:23:54] Amen. I don't know if you've noticed the
[1:23:56] Christian life is not always one of
[1:23:58] laughter, ease, enjoyment.
[1:24:03] Do we have fun all day every day?
[1:24:06] Nope.
[1:24:08] Joshua does. God bless him.
[1:24:13] Enjoy it while you can, brother Joshua.
[1:24:17] Hey, seriously, enjoy it while you can
[1:24:20] because it won't always be there. That's
[1:24:22] for sure.
[1:24:24] What? It's a life that builds character.
[1:24:28] Prophet of God says the only thing
[1:24:29] you're taking with you is your
[1:24:32] character. Why? because that's his
[1:24:34] workmanship.
[1:24:36] It's eternal. It's what he does and it's
[1:24:39] perfect in our lives. Character is what
[1:24:41] God's looking for. And we see true
[1:24:43] Christian character by one thing and one
[1:24:45] thing alone. Faith in the word of God
[1:24:47] applied to your life. That's what he's
[1:24:50] looking for. That's what a believer is,
[1:24:51] a faithful applier of the word to their
[1:24:54] life. Amen. It's not just our words.
[1:24:56] It's our actions. And I want to take one
[1:24:57] small example tonight and I hope we
[1:25:00] it'll encourage us. This is the
[1:25:01] encouraging part. If you haven't been
[1:25:02] encouraged so far, here it comes.
[1:25:05] Remember Elijah the prophet had called
[1:25:07] down judgment on Ahab for his idolatry
[1:25:09] and for uh causing so much trouble in
[1:25:12] Israel. And then he God said, "Go to the
[1:25:14] brook Cherith." He says, "I've made a
[1:25:16] way for you. I I'll I'll provide for you
[1:25:18] there." So he went to the brook Cherith
[1:25:19] and remember the ravens came and they
[1:25:21] gave him bread and they gave him meat
[1:25:23] and he drank from the brook Cherith. But
[1:25:25] after a while, God's provision dried up.
[1:25:28] The brook Cherith dried up. And look at
[1:25:30] God's instruction to him now. He says,
[1:25:33] "And the word of the Lord came unto him,
[1:25:35] saying, Arise, get thee to Zerapath,
[1:25:38] which belongth to Zidon, and dwell
[1:25:41] there. Behold, I have commanded,
[1:25:44] I've commanded a widow woman there to
[1:25:46] sustain thee." I want you to catch how
[1:25:48] God phrases this. I've never seen this
[1:25:51] before until I was studying this uh the
[1:25:53] other night and I had to leave Brother
[1:25:55] Chad's they had us over for
[1:25:56] Thanksgiving. I apologize, Brother Chad.
[1:25:57] We had to leave a bit early cuz I had to
[1:25:59] go home and study cuz all of a sudden I
[1:26:02] was preaching Wednesday night so I
[1:26:03] didn't have all the time to relax like I
[1:26:05] thought I did.
[1:26:07] But I was reading this and I had never
[1:26:09] seen it the way that I saw it yes on on
[1:26:11] Monday night. He says I've commanded a
[1:26:13] woman. He didn't just say I have someone
[1:26:15] there. He says I've commanded a widow
[1:26:17] woman to sustain you. The original
[1:26:19] language is I have appointed a widow
[1:26:22] woman there to sustain you. And I had
[1:26:24] never seen it that way. Never understood
[1:26:26] it that way. And I searched high and low
[1:26:28] through the message and I could only
[1:26:29] find one reference to it. And I want you
[1:26:31] to catch this. Here's our encouragement.
[1:26:33] He says, he said, "I've commanded a
[1:26:36] widow woman to feed you." He said, "He
[1:26:38] had already commanded her. She didn't
[1:26:41] know it."
[1:26:43] He might have commanded of you a
[1:26:45] testimony of your healing. You might not
[1:26:48] know it. But just hang on. When you are
[1:26:51] sure that you've met all the
[1:26:52] requirements, when you know that you've
[1:26:54] done everything that you know to do and
[1:26:56] laid yourself before God, there's only
[1:26:59] one thing to do is hang on to his
[1:27:02] promise. Then
[1:27:05] see, so often what we're doing is we're
[1:27:06] hanging on to the promise until we've
[1:27:08] done everything we can and nothing
[1:27:09] happens and we say, "Well, that's it."
[1:27:12] No, that's when his promise can work.
[1:27:15] Amen. When when your your skill runs
[1:27:17] out, when your strength runs out, when
[1:27:19] your patience runs out, when your
[1:27:20] discipline runs out, when your whatever
[1:27:23] it is that you've been getting through
[1:27:24] all of this trial, when that runs out,
[1:27:26] he says, "Then hang on to his promise."
[1:27:30] When you're at the end of yourself,
[1:27:32] cling to him. That's the only way you're
[1:27:34] going to get through it. Amen. I want
[1:27:36] you to see this. He says, "Stay there."
[1:27:40] God promised to answer. He'll do it. You
[1:27:43] don't know what he's commanded, what
[1:27:44] angel or what to do it. It may be this
[1:27:47] night before the healing service starts
[1:27:50] tomorrow night. God might have seen your
[1:27:52] condition today. He might have heard
[1:27:55] your prayer.
[1:27:57] I want you to see the kind of people
[1:27:59] that God ordains, that God appoints,
[1:28:02] that God commands. I want you to see the
[1:28:04] kind of people that God chooses. And
[1:28:06] church, they don't realize it until
[1:28:08] everything is said and done. That's our
[1:28:11] problem is we can only see through a
[1:28:13] glass darkly. We only see what's in
[1:28:15] front of us. We only see what our five
[1:28:17] senses tell us. We only see maybe what
[1:28:20] our inner five senses can reason out or
[1:28:22] remember to get us to some sort of a
[1:28:24] conclusion. We can be so blind to the
[1:28:26] supernatural because we're completely
[1:28:28] encompassed by the natural. But God's
[1:28:31] trying to elevate our sights. He's
[1:28:32] trying to elevate our faith to as a
[1:28:34] super as a super sense to look beyond
[1:28:37] what these five senses are screaming at
[1:28:39] us to say there's more to this than you
[1:28:41] realize.
[1:28:43] Listen to this. He says how that this
[1:28:46] little woman must have been of the
[1:28:50] caliber of Elijah. I say hallelujah
[1:28:53] tonight. What? That you can be of the
[1:28:56] same caliber as William Brham.
[1:28:59] Did you hear Did you hear what I just
[1:29:01] said?
[1:29:03] what the message comes to somebody
[1:29:05] that's of the same caliber of the one
[1:29:07] that gives it
[1:29:09] because he's got to have a giver but
[1:29:11] he's got to have a receiver of the same
[1:29:13] caliber for this to work. Amen. He says
[1:29:16] because usually your action shows what
[1:29:18] you are. And again, she had been chosen
[1:29:20] to entertain God's prophet. Remember,
[1:29:23] she was a gentile, not a Jew. For we see
[1:29:26] that God would not have called to her if
[1:29:27] she hadn't been a worthy one to
[1:29:30] entertain God's prophet.
[1:29:34] He said, "For he never would have sent
[1:29:35] his prophet to a house that was
[1:29:37] unworthy. It was not his choosing. It
[1:29:40] was God's choosing." It wasn't her
[1:29:43] bidding him. It was God bidding him. He
[1:29:46] had been placed by a brook. The ravens
[1:29:48] were feeding him. But it was God's
[1:29:50] command for something to take place. And
[1:29:52] God surely went to a believer of the
[1:29:55] same nature of Elijah. We're talking
[1:29:58] about highc caliber people. Now, high
[1:30:01] caliber has two meanings. In guns, it
[1:30:03] means uh large caliber, big caliber,
[1:30:06] something that's got to hit a lot of uh
[1:30:08] uh destructive power. But when it comes
[1:30:10] to people, high caliber means they are
[1:30:13] of the highest quality,
[1:30:15] of the highest uh endurance and strength
[1:30:19] and longevity. They're the real deal.
[1:30:22] Do you ever buy something off of Teimu
[1:30:24] or Amazon and it looks so good in the
[1:30:26] pictures and when you got it, it wasn't
[1:30:28] what you expected?
[1:30:33] Guess what? God doesn't get his
[1:30:35] believers off Teeu and Amazon.
[1:30:38] They're high caliber. They're the real
[1:30:40] deal. Amen.
[1:30:43] Remember, we're talking about
[1:30:44] preeminence here.
[1:30:47] But let's look at her condition. Amen.
[1:30:48] Let's look at this woman. Because we
[1:30:50] think we're weak. We think we're
[1:30:52] insufficient. We think we're nothing. We
[1:30:54] think we don't have what he's looking
[1:30:56] for. Why? Because of our circumstances.
[1:30:58] Because of our heavy circumstances. We
[1:31:00] say, "If I was a better believer, I
[1:31:02] wouldn't have to deal with this or I
[1:31:04] wouldn't be struggling with this or I
[1:31:06] wouldn't be hurt by this or I wouldn't
[1:31:07] be bitter about this." But church, he
[1:31:10] knows the caliber that's under there.
[1:31:12] He's just beating you to get it out.
[1:31:15] He knows there's something inside that
[1:31:17] he can get out if you'll just go through
[1:31:18] the process. Amen. Church, the rapture
[1:31:22] revelation is we know who we are. God
[1:31:25] already does. He's trying to get us to
[1:31:27] see what he sees.
[1:31:29] Remember church, this woman is a widow.
[1:31:33] She's a single mom. She has nobody to
[1:31:36] help. She has nobody to sustain her. She
[1:31:38] has to do everything for herself. And
[1:31:40] that alone would destroy many people. It
[1:31:43] would drive them into a relationship
[1:31:44] they ought not to be in. It would drive
[1:31:46] them into selling their body. It would
[1:31:48] drive them into theft, whatever it might
[1:31:49] be, to make ends meet, to take care of
[1:31:51] their child. But she stays faithful
[1:31:53] through all of this. Abraham says it
[1:31:56] this way. He says, "This poor little
[1:31:57] woman, she knew that he was God." Can
[1:32:01] you say that this evening? I know he's
[1:32:03] God. That ought to be our testimony. He
[1:32:06] says, "And as that barrel went down,
[1:32:09] down, down, down, circumstances got
[1:32:12] worse and worse all the time." He says,
[1:32:15] "But God was letting it get that way."
[1:32:19] He just loves to do that. He loves to
[1:32:21] put your faith to a test to see how
[1:32:23] you'll act on it. Let you be anointed
[1:32:25] and praying for it and make you worse.
[1:32:28] Said, "Come on, Satan. Put him to the
[1:32:30] test. I know he believes me." He says,
[1:32:32] "Bless God forever." Oh my. Put him to a
[1:32:34] test now. I know he took my word for it.
[1:32:37] He says, "Could he say that about you?"
[1:32:40] This is a woman that has enough flour,
[1:32:43] meal, it calls it in the scripture, and
[1:32:45] enough oil to make one little loaf of
[1:32:47] bread for her son and her. That's it.
[1:32:51] She's watched her supplies dwindle day
[1:32:53] after day, week after week, month after
[1:32:55] month. There's no money coming in.
[1:32:57] Everything she got is coming down to one
[1:32:59] little cruise of oil and one little
[1:33:02] thing of meal, and that's it.
[1:33:07] and she knows he's God.
[1:33:11] And it's getting worse and worse and
[1:33:14] more dire and more dire and closer and
[1:33:17] closer and closer to her death and that
[1:33:19] of her son
[1:33:22] and she still knows he's God. Church,
[1:33:24] let me say it this way. Sometimes God
[1:33:26] will let you get down to your last
[1:33:27] nerve.
[1:33:29] Your last bit of health, your last bit
[1:33:31] of patience, your last bit of service,
[1:33:35] your last bit of love, your last bit of
[1:33:37] faith, your last bit of joy,
[1:33:42] just to see what you do when you're
[1:33:45] standing on the edge and saying, "What
[1:33:46] next?"
[1:33:48] And you see no end in sight, no doors
[1:33:51] opening, no provision coming your way.
[1:33:54] Why? because he knows we're a high
[1:33:57] caliber people.
[1:34:00] He knows what you're made out of.
[1:34:04] He knows we'll do what he requires. He
[1:34:06] knows we'll make the right decision.
[1:34:07] Amen. Sometimes he'll get us to the
[1:34:10] place where we're staring at our need
[1:34:12] and everything we've applied against it
[1:34:14] hasn't met the need and we've got a
[1:34:16] stark reality that we're going to hit
[1:34:18] rock bottom in the next day or two. What
[1:34:21] do we do? And you know what he does?
[1:34:25] He sent somebody there to take that last
[1:34:28] little bit that we've been relying on to
[1:34:30] get us through this last little bit.
[1:34:35] He said, "What was it?" God works on
[1:34:39] both ends of the line.
[1:34:43] Church, Elijah's need and the widow's
[1:34:46] need are the exact same thing.
[1:34:51] Elijah's hungry. She's hungry. Elijah's
[1:34:55] got no food. She's running out of food.
[1:34:58] He has nothing in sight. He's got to
[1:35:00] walk the entire way to her house without
[1:35:02] food. She's at least had a meal every
[1:35:06] day. Small, but she's had one. He's had
[1:35:08] nothing since he's walked from the brook
[1:35:10] Cherith to this lady's house.
[1:35:14] They have the exact same need, church.
[1:35:17] And she's done everything she can to
[1:35:19] supply it. And now God's coming with
[1:35:22] somebody to take away that last little
[1:35:24] bit she's done for herself.
[1:35:26] Out of options. God had showed Elijah a
[1:35:29] vision. Go down into the city for I've
[1:35:31] commanded not the ravens this time to
[1:35:33] feed you. But I've commanded a widow
[1:35:34] woman to sustain you. And took him to
[1:35:37] the poorest of the poors. And she didn't
[1:35:39] even have enough meal in the barrel for
[1:35:40] her and her son to live that day. But
[1:35:42] I've commanded I've ordained it. Blessed
[1:35:44] be the name of the Lord. When God
[1:35:46] ordains anything, it's got to happen.
[1:35:48] It'll be there. God will meet it.
[1:35:51] Church, think of Elijah when he's coming
[1:35:52] here. And you'd think that God would
[1:35:54] send him to the rich house.
[1:35:56] Where it's not going to be a burden,
[1:35:59] where there's plenty,
[1:36:01] where they've had plenty of money to
[1:36:03] take him through. He sends him to the
[1:36:05] poorest of the poors. This woman is
[1:36:08] crying out to God, seeking an answer for
[1:36:12] the hunger that she's about to face. And
[1:36:14] what does God send her? Someone that's
[1:36:16] even more hungry than she is.
[1:36:20] [Music]
[1:36:22] Church, do you understand why we need to
[1:36:24] be building a hedge of the word around
[1:36:25] our life? So that we understand when
[1:36:28] these things happen, it ain't Satan.
[1:36:31] It's God refining his bride. It's God
[1:36:35] showing who she is. It's God proving she
[1:36:39] has what it takes. Amen.
[1:36:44] He says, "So he arose and went to
[1:36:46] Zerapath." Listen, that was no small
[1:36:49] deal for him to go. He's got a long
[1:36:50] journey to go with no ravens to sustain
[1:36:53] him. He's going to have to go on his
[1:36:54] fat. And he probably didn't have a whole
[1:36:56] lot of it.
[1:36:58] And when he came to the gate of the
[1:37:00] city, behold, the widow woman was there
[1:37:02] gathering of sticks. And he called to
[1:37:04] her, and he said, "Fetch me, I pray
[1:37:05] thee, a little water in a vessel that I
[1:37:07] may drink." And as she was going to
[1:37:09] fetch it, he called to her and said,
[1:37:11] "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of
[1:37:13] bread in thine hand." Church, this is
[1:37:15] the test of preeminence. God sends us a
[1:37:18] dilemma.
[1:37:21] If we didn't know the ending, we'd say
[1:37:24] this is unfair.
[1:37:27] God, there are people that have way more
[1:37:29] than this woman. Why are you going to
[1:37:31] her?
[1:37:32] But remember, church, he wants
[1:37:34] everything.
[1:37:36] He wants your testimony.
[1:37:38] Amen. Today we can look at our lives and
[1:37:41] we can say how come I'm the only one
[1:37:43] dealing with this.
[1:37:46] Hey, look around.
[1:37:49] Sickness, hardship, finances, school,
[1:37:54] job situations.
[1:37:57] Not everybody's got it all they're
[1:37:58] dealing with, but all of us have
[1:37:59] different things we're dealing with.
[1:38:01] Amen. And we can say, "Lord, why me? I'm
[1:38:05] doing everything I can for you. Why me?
[1:38:07] I've given everything I've got. Lord,
[1:38:09] why me?
[1:38:10] Just trying to do what you want me to
[1:38:12] do. Lord, why me?
[1:38:14] Church, that's when we've got to
[1:38:16] remember, I have good thoughts toward
[1:38:18] you, of peace, not of evil, to bring you
[1:38:22] to an expected end. That's why we need
[1:38:25] that hedge to keep us in the right
[1:38:27] mindset. Amen. We ought to have faith
[1:38:30] that God's controlling all things.
[1:38:34] Listen to her response. And she said,
[1:38:36] "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not
[1:38:38] a cake, but a handful of meal in a
[1:38:40] barrel, and a little oil in a cruise,
[1:38:42] and behold, I'm gathering two sticks
[1:38:44] that I may go in and dress it for me and
[1:38:46] my son, that we may eat it and die." She
[1:38:48] throws this right back at him. She says,
[1:38:51] "You think you got needs? We got needs.
[1:38:55] I got a son. I got a little bit of food.
[1:38:57] We're going to make a bit of bread.
[1:38:58] We're going to eat it today, and then
[1:38:59] we're going to lay down. We're going to
[1:39:00] die together. Do you really want to take
[1:39:02] the the food out of my son's mouth and
[1:39:05] out of my mouth? Do you want to kill us
[1:39:06] a day earlier than we would have died?
[1:39:08] That's what she's saying here.
[1:39:11] She's saying, "Do you realize what
[1:39:12] you're asking of me? How do you think he
[1:39:15] felt?"
[1:39:19] Because the Lord has said, "This is the
[1:39:21] woman." And then he realizes her
[1:39:23] condition and he's saying,
[1:39:26] "I'll just maybe go ask somebody else."
[1:39:30] No, he can't do it. He's a prophet. He's
[1:39:33] got to go where God takes him. And God
[1:39:36] has said, "This is the woman." So, he
[1:39:39] has to push through his own inhibitions
[1:39:41] now, his own mercy and grace, if I could
[1:39:44] put it that way, his desire to help her
[1:39:47] rather than hurt her to be obedient to
[1:39:49] the word. Church, see, they're both in a
[1:39:52] test of preeminence.
[1:39:54] One, will you trust God? The other, will
[1:39:56] you obey God?
[1:39:59] Amen. Are you with me tonight?
[1:40:02] And Elijah said unto her, "Fear not." I
[1:40:06] love that God always says that. You'll
[1:40:09] find time and time again God calls you
[1:40:11] to do a hard thing. What is the first
[1:40:12] thing he says? Fear not. Don't worry
[1:40:15] about it.
[1:40:17] He says, "Go and do as thou hast said,
[1:40:20] but make me thereof a little cake first,
[1:40:22] and bring it unto me, and after make for
[1:40:25] thee and thy son." Elijah says, "Feed
[1:40:28] me, then feed you." But she's already
[1:40:31] made it clear. There ain't enough for
[1:40:32] all of us, bud. If I feed you, I ain't
[1:40:37] feeding me.
[1:40:39] Here comes the test of preeminence to
[1:40:41] the believer.
[1:40:43] Brother Ram says, "What do we hear then
[1:40:44] next? But fetch me a little cake first."
[1:40:47] He says, "God first." No matter what
[1:40:50] anybody else says, what anything else,
[1:40:52] what any evidence, how gloomy it looks,
[1:40:54] whatever it might may be, take God
[1:40:56] first. His word first. Doctor said, "I
[1:40:59] can't get well." But his word first. I'm
[1:41:02] too much of a sinner. I'm a prostitute.
[1:41:04] I'm a gambler. I'm a drunkard. God's
[1:41:07] word first. Though your sins be as
[1:41:09] scarlet, they shall be as white as snow,
[1:41:11] red like crimson. They'll be white like
[1:41:13] wool. He says, "First, God."
[1:41:16] He says, "Go bring me a little cake
[1:41:18] first. All that you've got, bring it to
[1:41:21] me." He says, "Are you willing to give
[1:41:23] it into my hands, my life, all that I
[1:41:25] am, I'm 50 years old. Are you willing,
[1:41:28] William Brandham, to lay it to me? Are
[1:41:30] you willing, your little children, to
[1:41:32] lay your life to me? Are you willing?
[1:41:34] Can you do it, sick people? Can you
[1:41:37] trust me? Put me first."
[1:41:41] She looked at him. There was something
[1:41:44] told her that that man knew what he was
[1:41:46] talking about. He said, "God knows his
[1:41:50] own. My sheep know my voice. They know
[1:41:53] whether it's scripture or not, whether
[1:41:55] it's right or not." Church, can you
[1:41:58] imagine? She's been crying out to God
[1:42:01] days, weeks, maybe months. Lord, help
[1:42:04] me. Lord, provide for me. Lord, I need
[1:42:06] flour. Lord, I need oil. Lord, we're
[1:42:08] going to die if you don't help. Lord,
[1:42:10] help. Lord, you know I'm your servant.
[1:42:12] Lord, you know I'm sincere. Lord, you
[1:42:13] know I go to church. Lord, you know I
[1:42:15] pay my ties. Lord, you know I'm doing
[1:42:17] everything for you that I can. Will you
[1:42:19] help me? And all she's seen is things go
[1:42:21] down, down, down. And now somebody comes
[1:42:23] and says, "Give me what you've got left.
[1:42:27] Take away any bit of insurance you've
[1:42:29] got. Take away any bit of comfort you
[1:42:31] got. Take away any hope you've got and
[1:42:33] give it to me."
[1:42:35] Church, her prayer request is standing
[1:42:38] before her with the answer.
[1:42:41] And the answer is give me everything
[1:42:43] you've got.
[1:42:47] Now she's in a moral dilemma.
[1:42:51] Remember, she's a child of God.
[1:42:55] God had appointed her
[1:42:58] for a testimony.
[1:43:03] How many people here want a testimony
[1:43:04] tonight?
[1:43:07] Even brother Joe won't raise his hand to
[1:43:08] that one
[1:43:11] because a testimony always requires a
[1:43:14] test.
[1:43:16] I can't tell you how happy I am that I'm
[1:43:19] not in university anymore because nobody
[1:43:21] likes tests. The stress that hangs over
[1:43:24] you, the anxiety that's there. My son's
[1:43:26] going through it. Brother Garfield's
[1:43:27] going through it. Our kids in school
[1:43:29] tests. Nobody says, "I just I just hope
[1:43:32] the teacher gives us a test today."
[1:43:36] But this is God's way of working. It's
[1:43:38] God's way of proving you're ready for
[1:43:41] the next chapter. Amen. God knew she'd
[1:43:45] make the right choice. Listen to this.
[1:43:49] He continues, "For thus sayeth the Lord
[1:43:51] God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall
[1:43:53] not waste, neither shall the cruise of
[1:43:55] oil fail until the day that the Lord
[1:43:57] sendeth rain upon the earth." Church,
[1:43:59] this is no less different, no different
[1:44:00] than what the young rich young ruler
[1:44:02] had. Give and I'll give.
[1:44:06] Let go and I'll pour in. Pressed down,
[1:44:10] shaken together, pouring out. I'll give
[1:44:12] you more than you got, but you got to
[1:44:14] give before I can give. You got to let
[1:44:16] go so I can put something else into your
[1:44:18] hands. And here's the showdown, church.
[1:44:20] She can take care of herself for one
[1:44:22] more day. She can take care of her son
[1:44:25] for one more day. With all her logic,
[1:44:27] with all her region, with reason, with
[1:44:29] all her strength, she can live for that
[1:44:31] extra day. or she can give the word of
[1:44:34] God the preeminence
[1:44:36] and make it all the way through.
[1:44:39] But she's got to have faith to take that
[1:44:42] final step
[1:44:44] to lay down the last shred of hope that
[1:44:47] she has in faith. That's what the
[1:44:51] preeminence is going to be. Amen.
[1:44:53] Without any proof up front that she's
[1:44:56] going to get what this man says, church,
[1:44:58] she doesn't know Elijah. She's never met
[1:45:00] Elijah. He's never met her. They are
[1:45:02] total strangers. But he's giving her
[1:45:05] thus saith the Lord. Amen. What would
[1:45:09] you do?
[1:45:11] What do you do?
[1:45:14] I love this. I cried. She turns in
[1:45:18] obedience.
[1:45:21] He said, "That's what you've got to do."
[1:45:23] And when she turned to obey what the
[1:45:27] prophet said do, then came the thunder
[1:45:30] from heaven that every man looks to
[1:45:33] hear.
[1:45:35] For there came a thunder out of the
[1:45:37] voice of the prophet that every sinner
[1:45:39] and every sick person longs to hear.
[1:45:41] Thus saith the Lord. He said, "How we
[1:45:45] long to hear that? How that people sit
[1:45:48] in my driveway and say, "Come to this
[1:45:50] door. My daughter's in such my baby, my
[1:45:52] solo. Just say the word. He said, how
[1:45:54] can you say it before it's in your
[1:45:56] mouth? You be saying it yourself, but
[1:45:59] they long to hear that. Thus saith the
[1:46:02] Lord.
[1:46:04] I've never known this
[1:46:07] struggle
[1:46:10] that comes until I became a pastor.
[1:46:14] church, I've got no great gift of
[1:46:16] healing or faith like some do.
[1:46:19] But I've got a flock that God's given
[1:46:20] me. And when I see the hardships you
[1:46:22] face, when I see the struggles you face,
[1:46:25] when I see the health that is broken so
[1:46:27] many times, when I see children that are
[1:46:30] away, when I see family situations, when
[1:46:32] I see people that are down, people that
[1:46:34] are are just keep slipping, and what do
[1:46:36] I do? I want to go and give them a word.
[1:46:41] But that's me and my humanity.
[1:46:44] Brother Grant and I have talked about
[1:46:45] this. You hear somebody sick and they
[1:46:48] just can't seem to get past it. You want
[1:46:50] to go over and you want to cast that
[1:46:51] thing off them right then and there. And
[1:46:54] I have done that. But there's a
[1:46:57] sovereignty in it that I can't force.
[1:47:00] God has a time. God has a way. God has a
[1:47:04] season. And it's his choosing. Certainly
[1:47:08] not mine and certainly not yours. But
[1:47:11] that's what he's saying. He's saying, "I
[1:47:13] would want to do this, but I can't do
[1:47:16] it."
[1:47:18] He said, "But when she turned in
[1:47:19] obedience, she heard what we all long to
[1:47:22] hear. Thus saith the Lord." Amen.
[1:47:30] He says, "And she went and did according
[1:47:33] to the saying of Elijah." Church, that's
[1:47:36] the test.
[1:47:38] Will you do what he says without proof
[1:47:41] that he'll do what he says?
[1:47:45] That's what faith is. To call those
[1:47:47] things that are not as though they are
[1:47:49] and to act on it. Amen.
[1:47:54] The perfect rich young re ruler couldn't
[1:47:58] do it, but this little single mother
[1:48:02] could.
[1:48:04] That's why I don't dwell too much on how
[1:48:06] people look.
[1:48:08] It's when things get tough that's when
[1:48:09] we find out who's really a believer.
[1:48:13] He says there it came across the fence
[1:48:15] because she was obeying
[1:48:18] and the gloom
[1:48:20] broke. Hallelujah.
[1:48:24] Church, when the rich young ruler heard
[1:48:26] thus sayeth the Lord, gloom came down.
[1:48:30] Why?
[1:48:32] Because he wouldn't accept it.
[1:48:35] Now she in her gloom accepts the word
[1:48:39] and what happens? The gloom breaks.
[1:48:43] Thus saith the Lord,
[1:48:49] the barrel will not go empty, nor the
[1:48:51] crews run dry until the day that the
[1:48:54] Lord God sends rain on the earth. He
[1:48:56] says, "Oh, what a consolation. She made
[1:48:58] the cake. She gave it to the prophet.
[1:49:01] She went back and made some for her son
[1:49:03] and herself. and they ate and drank with
[1:49:05] plenty upon the earth. Can you imagine,
[1:49:09] church? She pours it all out. She makes
[1:49:11] the cake. She bakes it. She knows beyond
[1:49:14] a shadow of a doubt there's nothing left
[1:49:16] in the cruise of oil and there's no meal
[1:49:18] in the barrel. She knows it's gone. She
[1:49:22] goes and she gives him the cake, watches
[1:49:25] him eat it, and then she goes back in.
[1:49:28] Can you imagine when she goes and she
[1:49:30] looks in and she scoops up more flour
[1:49:35] and then she goes to pour the oil and
[1:49:38] oil comes out.
[1:49:41] Hallelujah.
[1:49:43] You talk about a revival. You talk about
[1:49:46] a consolation church. Why? She gave the
[1:49:50] word the preeminence it deserved. She
[1:49:53] said, "I'll do what you say,
[1:49:56] though it slay me.
[1:49:58] Though it hurt me, though it break me,
[1:50:02] though I sacrifice my own family on the
[1:50:05] altar of your word, I'll do it because I
[1:50:07] believe you'll raise us up again. That's
[1:50:10] the royal seed of Abraham, church.
[1:50:13] That's what we're talking about here
[1:50:14] tonight.
[1:50:17] Where did it come from?
[1:50:19] How did it get there? Scientifically,
[1:50:22] tell me where that meal came from. Where
[1:50:24] did that oil come from? How did it get
[1:50:26] in that cruise? She had poured it dry
[1:50:28] every morning. She emptied the meal
[1:50:30] barrel every morning and it was dry. But
[1:50:33] when she went back for more, it was
[1:50:35] there. Where did it come from?
[1:50:38] Where did it come from, church? Here's
[1:50:41] where it come from. Take God at his
[1:50:43] word.
[1:50:45] Be certain of God. He's the creator. You
[1:50:47] might have lost your health. You might
[1:50:49] have lost your fellowship. Take him at
[1:50:51] his word. Be certain that he's God.
[1:50:54] Catch this now. The gloomy times that's
[1:50:57] looking now may not look so gloomy if
[1:51:00] you'll just take his word and be certain
[1:51:03] that he's God. Let me say it this way,
[1:51:07] church. You're never going to experience
[1:51:09] the supernatural if you keep holding on
[1:51:12] to the natural.
[1:51:14] Not going to happen.
[1:51:17] You won't let go and let God have his
[1:51:19] way.
[1:51:21] You can't experience the eternal
[1:51:24] if you're just grasping the temporal all
[1:51:26] the time. Amen.
[1:51:29] This woman was no doubt praying and
[1:51:31] seeking God for a long, long time. And
[1:51:35] ultimately,
[1:51:37] she couldn't make it work.
[1:51:42] She did everything she could.
[1:51:45] Listen, I remember when my father left
[1:51:47] and he didn't have a whole lot of income
[1:51:48] coming in and mom's there with five kids
[1:51:50] and she's working and working and
[1:51:52] working and we didn't have a whole lot
[1:51:53] of money.
[1:51:55] Church, she did everything she could to
[1:51:57] stretch 10 cents into a dollar. And I've
[1:52:00] seen her do it.
[1:52:02] I've seen her do it. This woman was like
[1:52:05] that. But in the end, she still couldn't
[1:52:09] save herself.
[1:52:11] She couldn't save her son. Amen. And
[1:52:14] when she realized that, church, that's
[1:52:16] when she gave the word the preeminence.
[1:52:20] Her heart was right the whole time, but
[1:52:22] she was doing everything she could do.
[1:52:24] Remember what brother Bram says?
[1:52:27] When you've come to everything you can
[1:52:29] do, he says, "Then hang on to God and
[1:52:33] his word." She had nothing left to hang
[1:52:36] on to. All her skill in stretching out
[1:52:39] those those groceries to to make the
[1:52:41] meals and keep them there. Amen. And God
[1:52:44] put her to a test. He says, "Will you
[1:52:46] stay your way or will you let me provide
[1:52:49] like I've been trying to do?
[1:52:52] Will you let me give you a testimony,
[1:52:53] daughter?"
[1:52:57] How? He gave her a message from a
[1:52:59] prophet.
[1:53:01] A gentile woman got a message from a
[1:53:03] prophet that would answer her prayer if
[1:53:05] she'd only let him do it.
[1:53:08] Listen to this. The barrel of meal
[1:53:10] wasted nothing.
[1:53:12] It didn't go dry.
[1:53:16] It didn't run out
[1:53:18] and it didn't get weevils in it.
[1:53:21] She had flour until the drought was
[1:53:24] over. Neither did the crews of oil fail
[1:53:27] according to the word of the Lord which
[1:53:30] he spoke by Elijah. See, remember my
[1:53:34] thoughts are of peace, not of evil. This
[1:53:38] sure looked like evil, didn't it?
[1:53:40] Sending a drought, taking the last
[1:53:42] morsel of food from her mouth. But in
[1:53:44] the end, she had more by doing it God's
[1:53:47] way than she had had the entire time of
[1:53:50] scrimping and saving and stretching on
[1:53:53] her own. Church, you can't outgive God.
[1:53:57] You can't outperform God. You can't give
[1:54:00] more than he'll give back to you. Amen.
[1:54:05] For months, it seemed like God's
[1:54:07] thoughts were of evil.
[1:54:10] But at the last minute, he came down. He
[1:54:12] says, "No, it's for peace. I was
[1:54:14] watching all along. I've got your answer
[1:54:17] right here."
[1:54:19] Brother Brown would say this. He says,
[1:54:20] "If the preacher preaches the word, and
[1:54:22] the man that receives it, believes it,
[1:54:24] and acts upon it, something has got to
[1:54:27] happen. If you're a sinner, you'll have
[1:54:30] to be saved. If you're sick, you'll have
[1:54:31] to be healed because God promised it if
[1:54:34] we are certain of God. And as certain as
[1:54:36] he is, God has to keep it. God has to
[1:54:40] keep his word.
[1:54:42] What's he saying? You can't do this on
[1:54:45] your own, church. You're going to fail
[1:54:47] if you try on your own. Amen. You can't
[1:54:49] do it your way. You can't do it with
[1:54:50] your own leadership. Can't do it with
[1:54:52] your own skill. Can't do it with your
[1:54:54] own discipline. Can't do it with your
[1:54:55] hands clinging to whatever it is you got
[1:54:57] your hands on tonight. You're not going
[1:55:00] to be able to save it. You're not going
[1:55:03] to be able to preserve it. You're not
[1:55:04] going to be able to multiply it. It
[1:55:05] doesn't matter. It's him or nothing.
[1:55:09] It's giving him the preeminence. Amen.
[1:55:12] You can't make a rapture on your own.
[1:55:14] You can't please God on your own. You
[1:55:16] can't heal yourself. Can't provide for
[1:55:18] yourself. Can't give yourself peace,
[1:55:20] joy, love. You can't do anything. It's
[1:55:23] going to take giving him the preeminence
[1:55:25] to get those things into our lives.
[1:55:27] Amen. And what'll happen is it'll come
[1:55:29] down to a place, and I speak by
[1:55:30] experience, you'll come to a place where
[1:55:32] you've driven and you've directed and
[1:55:34] you've guided and you've used everything
[1:55:36] you've got, and you'll still be broken
[1:55:38] down on the side of the road. Why?
[1:55:41] Because this guy tried to have the
[1:55:42] preeminence.
[1:55:45] And like this woman, we're going to have
[1:55:47] to say, "Lord,
[1:55:49] I don't want to stay broken down.
[1:55:52] I don't want to stay hurt. I don't want
[1:55:55] to stay disappointed.
[1:55:57] I don't want to stay frustrated.
[1:55:59] I don't want to stay bitter. I don't
[1:56:02] want to stay cold. Tell you that. That's
[1:56:04] one thing I found, church. Self
[1:56:06] leadership leads to cold relationship.
[1:56:10] Absolutely it does. Why? Because how can
[1:56:12] you have relationship with your head if
[1:56:14] he's not in your head? Amen.
[1:56:18] And the question we've got to ask
[1:56:19] ourselves in those moments is who has
[1:56:21] the preeminence and who ought to have
[1:56:23] the preeminence?
[1:56:25] That's where that integrity comes in
[1:56:27] that we talked about where we look in
[1:56:28] the mirror and we say, "Lord, take me
[1:56:30] out of the picture. I'm taking myself
[1:56:32] out. I want you to have the
[1:56:33] preeminence." Amen.
[1:56:36] We do that, God will take care of it.
[1:56:39] Remember what Jesus said, "Seek ye first
[1:56:40] the kingdom of God and his
[1:56:42] righteousness." And all these things,
[1:56:44] everything we've been clinging to,
[1:56:46] that's what he was talking about. the
[1:56:47] things we seek for, the things we fight
[1:56:48] for, the things we struggle for, the
[1:56:50] things we worry about. He says, "Give me
[1:56:53] the preeminence,
[1:56:55] and I'll take care of all of that. I'll
[1:56:58] take care of all of that." Brother Brown
[1:57:00] would say this, and we're closing. I've
[1:57:01] got one page left. What we need today is
[1:57:04] not a lot of material things. We have
[1:57:07] that. This is the most material
[1:57:10] generation that's ever been. We have
[1:57:11] more than anybody's ever had terms of uh
[1:57:14] gadgets and appliances and efficiencies
[1:57:17] and all these different things. We got
[1:57:18] tools for everything. Sisters, you
[1:57:20] barely have to wash a dish or clothing.
[1:57:23] What you have to do is fold it. And I'll
[1:57:25] guarantee you there's something out
[1:57:26] there that'll fold it if you're willing
[1:57:27] to pay enough money.
[1:57:29] Brothers, we sit there and computers do
[1:57:31] most of our work. We just tell them what
[1:57:33] to do. We're hardly most of us out there
[1:57:35] sweating except those of us that are
[1:57:37] blue collar. Brother Matt probably does
[1:57:38] some sweating. Brother Chad will do some
[1:57:39] sweating from time to time. Brother
[1:57:41] Kingsley certainly, but even then you
[1:57:43] look at what we do and so much is
[1:57:45] automated. We have so much material
[1:57:47] things says we have that we don't need
[1:57:49] greater churches. We don't need greater
[1:57:51] congregations. We don't need more on
[1:57:54] radio and on television. We don't need
[1:57:56] so many more of these things.
[1:58:01] You want to know what we need?
[1:58:04] But what we need today to be spiritual
[1:58:08] is a person that will humble themselves
[1:58:11] before God if they haven't got a penny
[1:58:14] and will pray till.
[1:58:18] Can I challenge your prayer life
[1:58:20] tonight?
[1:58:24] Here's a test for our prayer lives
[1:58:26] tonight.
[1:58:28] A pe person that will humble themselves
[1:58:30] before God and will pray till that
[1:58:34] spirit within them is satisfied with the
[1:58:37] goodness of God.
[1:58:42] I've done a lot of things in my life in
[1:58:44] terms of career,
[1:58:46] academics,
[1:58:47] athletics,
[1:58:49] competitions,
[1:58:51] and let me tell you, not a one of them
[1:58:54] gave me satisfaction that lasted. Oh,
[1:58:58] they felt good for the moment. Not going
[1:59:00] to pretend they didn't.
[1:59:04] Youngest ever senior engineer in Lufkin
[1:59:07] Industries. Youngest ever head of
[1:59:10] engineering for North America
[1:59:13] for one company.
[1:59:16] Multiple winnings employee of the year.
[1:59:19] Academic scholarships.
[1:59:22] Won two championships in the lowest
[1:59:24] league of hockey in Edmonton.
[1:59:26] The boys found my ring the other day.
[1:59:28] They said, "Dad, is this worth
[1:59:29] anything?" I said, "No."
[1:59:32] But in the moment, scoring the winning
[1:59:34] goal felt pretty good.
[1:59:38] Do I ever think about it? Nope. Barely
[1:59:41] remember it? Only when my boys bring out
[1:59:43] the ring and then I realize, oh yeah, I
[1:59:45] scored the winning goal.
[1:59:48] Whoopde ding dong day, as I used to say.
[1:59:52] In the moment, it was so great. You
[1:59:54] know, they are we okay? Can I take a
[1:59:57] just a couple more minutes here? We're
[1:59:59] We're closing.
[2:00:01] The number one golfer in the world is a
[2:00:03] man named Scotty Sheffler. And he just
[2:00:06] signed a $400 million contract with Live
[2:00:09] Golf to play golf.
[2:00:12] He's won more tournaments a year, I
[2:00:14] think, than any player has won.
[2:00:18] He's won every one of the Masters, if
[2:00:19] I'm not mistaken. And they asked him,
[2:00:21] they said, "How does it feel to win the
[2:00:25] Masters?" That's the, you know, they've
[2:00:27] got four masters tournaments which are
[2:00:28] the great championships amongst the golf
[2:00:30] tournaments every year. He said, you
[2:00:33] know, it's great in the morning, but
[2:00:41] and people couldn't believe it
[2:00:43] because to him it was just a fleeting
[2:00:46] moment. And then the next morning, what
[2:00:48] do you have to do? get up and do it all
[2:00:51] over again with no more satisfaction in
[2:00:54] his heart than he had before he won it.
[2:00:58] This is the best of the best
[2:01:01] in golf today. And he said,
[2:01:06] "There are things that are worth more."
[2:01:09] And this is what he does for a living.
[2:01:11] $400 million generational wealth church
[2:01:14] has made over half a billion dollars in
[2:01:17] his lifetime playing golf. Okay,
[2:01:21] guess what? 150 grand a year. It's not
[2:01:25] going to matter when you get it.
[2:01:27] 200,000, 300,000, become a VP, become a
[2:01:30] president, become a CEO, become a the
[2:01:33] greatest home run hitter, become the
[2:01:34] greatest goal scorer, beat Alex
[2:01:35] Ovetchkin and Wayne Gretzky. It won't
[2:01:37] matter to a child of God.
[2:01:40] He says, but what? To be spiritual, to
[2:01:43] find your position as a son of God.
[2:01:45] says, "Pray till the spirit within you
[2:01:48] is satisfied with one thing, the
[2:01:50] goodness of God."
[2:01:53] And until then, we're going to get into
[2:01:55] this in the next series into thirsts and
[2:01:57] things like that. We'll try and we'll
[2:01:59] fill it with everything. accolades at
[2:02:01] work, career uh enhancement,
[2:02:05] promotions,
[2:02:07] academic achievement, athletic
[2:02:09] achievement, the thousand pound club,
[2:02:12] weightlifting, getting a spouse.
[2:02:15] It won't satisfy
[2:02:17] if you're a child of God. He says, "Pray
[2:02:20] till the spirit within you is satisfied
[2:02:22] with the goodness of God." Number one.
[2:02:25] Number two,
[2:02:27] and a revival takes place on the inside
[2:02:30] of their heart.
[2:02:33] You say, "I'm satisfied." Church, if
[2:02:35] you're satisfied, it'll change your
[2:02:37] outlook. It'll change the way you act.
[2:02:40] It'll change where you put your time.
[2:02:41] It'll change where you put your energy.
[2:02:43] It'll change everything about you when
[2:02:45] you're satisfied. Because satisfied
[2:02:47] people don't chase.
[2:02:50] They have what they're looking for.
[2:02:53] A revival takes place on the inside of
[2:02:55] their heart
[2:02:57] that changes
[2:02:59] their attitudes and atmosphere that they
[2:03:03] live in. Can I read that through one
[2:03:05] more time? What we need today to be
[2:03:08] spiritual is a person that will humble
[2:03:10] themselves before God if they haven't
[2:03:12] got a penny and will pray till that
[2:03:15] spirit within them is satisfied with the
[2:03:18] goodness of God. A revival takes place
[2:03:20] on the inside of their heart that
[2:03:23] changes their attitudes and atmosphere
[2:03:26] that they live in. Amen. God bless you.
[2:03:29] Let's stand this evening. You know, I
[2:03:32] love that.
[2:03:35] You know, you can't fake an attitude for
[2:03:36] long. Anybody ever try and fake an
[2:03:39] attitude? Get up feeling grumpy and try
[2:03:41] and act chipper and happy. And all it
[2:03:44] takes is one wrong look, one wrong
[2:03:46] thing, not quite going the way you want.
[2:03:48] And what happens? Little Mr. snappy snap
[2:03:50] comes out or little miss snappy snappy
[2:03:52] comes out. Amen.
[2:03:54] Sometimes the biggest thing holding God
[2:03:57] back is this. Our attitude. Amen.
[2:04:02] Sometimes it's what we're holding on to
[2:04:04] and we won't let go. Sometimes the only
[2:04:07] thing holding us back is the ability for
[2:04:09] this guy to say, "I was wrong.
[2:04:12] I went down the wrong road. I made the
[2:04:15] wrong decision." church. Hey, sometimes
[2:04:17] we make wrong decisions and we did it in
[2:04:20] ignorance.
[2:04:22] Sometimes it's will for ignorance, as in
[2:04:23] we didn't go check it with God. We
[2:04:25] didn't go pray. We didn't go check it
[2:04:26] with his word, but we did it in
[2:04:27] ignorance. Sometimes we're just stubborn
[2:04:31] and we want to do a certain thing. We
[2:04:32] think a certain thing's got to happen.
[2:04:33] We think if we get a certain thing,
[2:04:35] it'll make us so much happy. And so,
[2:04:37] what do we do? We go down there. We've
[2:04:38] got to come back to that hole in the
[2:04:40] hedge and say, "Lord, I'm wrong. Let's
[2:04:43] fill this hole with your word. Sometimes
[2:04:46] we get fooled.
[2:04:48] Sometimes we get fooled. But that
[2:04:50] doesn't mean we just let it go. We got
[2:04:53] to go back and say, "Lord, can we fix
[2:04:55] that blind spot in my life?" But I've
[2:04:58] noticed one thing. God always brings us
[2:05:00] to a junction where we can make him the
[2:05:04] preeminent one. God always gives us an
[2:05:06] opportunity to come back and walk the
[2:05:08] road with the hedge of the word
[2:05:10] alongside it. where he's got the
[2:05:12] preeminence, where he's guiding by his
[2:05:13] spirit, where he's guiding by his word.
[2:05:15] And all he's doing is standing there
[2:05:16] waiting for us to come back to that
[2:05:18] little hole where we slipped out the
[2:05:19] side or something slipped in. He's
[2:05:22] saying, "Let's fix this before we move
[2:05:23] on, son."
[2:05:25] And that takes me saying, "I messed up.
[2:05:28] I missed the spot.
[2:05:31] I opened a gap up." Amen.
[2:05:34] What he doesn't do is promise that if we
[2:05:36] give him one thing, he'll give us that
[2:05:37] thing back. You'll never find in the
[2:05:40] scripture where God says, "If you give
[2:05:41] me your money, I'll give you all your
[2:05:43] money back." We have a promise for
[2:05:44] tithes.
[2:05:46] But listen, he didn't promise us wealth.
[2:05:50] What he promised us was the fruit of the
[2:05:51] spirit. What he promised us was his
[2:05:53] presence. What he promised is his
[2:05:55] blessing, his covering, his leadership,
[2:05:57] his guidance, his provision. That the
[2:05:59] righteous are never forsaken or receive
[2:06:01] bacon bread. That our needs are provided
[2:06:03] if we'll give him the preeminence.
[2:06:06] But what does he have? good thoughts
[2:06:08] towards us. Hallelujah, church. It's a
[2:06:12] good thing when God has good thoughts
[2:06:13] towards us, thoughts of peace to take us
[2:06:16] to an expected end. In other words, he's
[2:06:18] a God that'll do what he says he's going
[2:06:19] to do about you, for you with you. And
[2:06:23] by the end, you'll come through, as the
[2:06:25] scripture says, as pure gold.
[2:06:28] And it'll be more precious to you, those
[2:06:31] things, than the gold you could have
[2:06:33] gotten otherwise. Amen.
[2:06:37] Like that woman, what does he do? He
[2:06:39] takes it
[2:06:41] and he says, "Here,
[2:06:43] it's in your hands. You take it." That's
[2:06:47] all he wants us to do. Take it, eat it,
[2:06:51] and see what it'll do for you. And
[2:06:54] you'll never thirst again for anything
[2:06:55] else. You'll never hunger again for
[2:06:56] anything else. Because when you see what
[2:06:58] this does,
[2:07:00] it satisfies something that you've been
[2:07:02] looking for for a very long time. Amen.
[2:07:06] God bless you this evening.
[2:07:08] Little serious there at the end, but I
[2:07:10] hope it encourages you. There's a reason
[2:07:12] why you go through things that other
[2:07:14] people may not. He knows what you're
[2:07:17] made out of. He knows you're high
[2:07:19] caliber. He knows your quality. He knows
[2:07:21] you're handmade. He knows you've got
[2:07:24] what it takes to come through with a
[2:07:26] testimony
[2:07:29] that'll glorify him. that other people
[2:07:32] can see Jesus Christ living in flesh all
[2:07:35] over again. Amen. God bless you tonight.
[2:07:37] Let's bow our heads.
[2:07:40] Heavenly Father,
[2:07:42] Lord, how blessed we are to know your
[2:07:44] thoughts towards us. Lord, to know that
[2:07:47] our lives are in your hands, that you
[2:07:49] have all things in control, that you're
[2:07:50] working all things for our good.
[2:07:53] But Lord, I also know sometimes the
[2:07:55] battle gets real long.
[2:07:57] The valley gets real deep.
[2:08:01] Lord, the gloom settles in.
[2:08:05] But Lord, we saw what broke that gloom
[2:08:08] was a little bride, a little gentile
[2:08:11] woman that obeyed the word of the Lord.
[2:08:18] Lord, it's such a simple thing, this
[2:08:20] obedience,
[2:08:22] this simple faith.
[2:08:24] But Lord, it's what you're requiring in
[2:08:26] this day is a bride that will take you
[2:08:28] at your word, that'll trust you
[2:08:30] completely with everything that she has
[2:08:33] in her life, including life itself. Lord
[2:08:36] God, Lord, you see the needs. Lord, you
[2:08:40] see the glooms that we face. You see the
[2:08:42] darknesses.
[2:08:44] You see the struggles. you see the
[2:08:46] weights and the burdens that we're
[2:08:47] carrying, Lord God. Lord, but you called
[2:08:50] us to lay those at your feet and walk
[2:08:52] with you.
[2:08:54] Lord, I pray you help us to take you at
[2:08:56] your word. Lord, help us to get up
[2:08:58] tomorrow morning and repeat these words
[2:09:01] back that you spoke to us tonight. I am
[2:09:04] perfect because he says, I'm perfect,
[2:09:08] Lord. That your works are perfect, your
[2:09:10] thoughts are perfect, and we are all of
[2:09:12] those things. Lord, we are the
[2:09:14] expression and the manifestation of the
[2:09:17] wisdom and purpose of God. Help us to
[2:09:20] remember that tomorrow and the next day
[2:09:22] and the next day. Lord, we're forgetful
[2:09:25] hearers. Lord, take your word and
[2:09:26] engrave it on our hearts. Lord, help us
[2:09:28] to encourage ourselves in the Lord by
[2:09:30] your word. Lord, give us a word of
[2:09:33] praise, a song of praise. Lord, help us
[2:09:36] to lift your name, Lord. It'll break the
[2:09:39] gloom, Lord, and it'll get us in an
[2:09:41] atmosphere, Lord, that'll change our
[2:09:43] lives. That'll change our situations,
[2:09:46] Lord. I pray you speak to hearts, Lord.
[2:09:48] Pray you encourage us to seek after you,
[2:09:51] Lord. That's all you desire is a person
[2:09:52] that'll seek. Seek and you'll find.
[2:09:55] Knock and it'll be opened. Give and
[2:09:58] it'll be given back. Pressed down,
[2:10:00] shaken together, running over. Lord,
[2:10:02] your blessings are wonderful. They're
[2:10:04] perfect. They're unending. Lord, to a
[2:10:06] people that will have faith that you'll
[2:10:08] do what you say. Bless us, Lord, I pray.
[2:10:11] Lord, I pray for those that are sick
[2:10:12] tonight. Thank you, Lord, for bringing
[2:10:13] brother Paul back to us. Lord, I pray
[2:10:16] your grace, Lord, for Samuel tonight,
[2:10:18] Lord. You see how miserable he is, Lord.
[2:10:20] I pray, Lord, even for Biscuit, Lord,
[2:10:22] with that infection, his swollen nose,
[2:10:23] Lord. Praying your touch for him as
[2:10:25] well. Lord, be with us each one. In
[2:10:28] Jesus Christ's name, we're asking it.
[2:10:30] Amen.
[2:10:31] And amen.

[2:20:42] another. Let the Lord lay somebody on
[2:20:44] your heart. Amen. Say, "Lord, who is it
[2:20:46] that needs it most today, this week, and
[2:20:50] let them put somebody there?" And you
[2:20:51] pray for them, trusting that somebody's
