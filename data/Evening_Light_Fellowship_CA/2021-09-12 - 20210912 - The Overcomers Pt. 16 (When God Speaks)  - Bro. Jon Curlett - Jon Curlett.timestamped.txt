[38:02] philip amen and god bless our sister
[38:05] susan amen and again also of course we
[38:08] will welcome our sister
[38:10] uh delfina
[38:12] and her friend ellen
[38:14] so god bless us good to see you again
[38:17] praise the name of the lord the bible
[38:18] says forsake not the assembling of
[38:22] yourselves together
[38:23] and much more as you see the day
[38:26] approaching that's right amen
[38:28] and he put that scripture there
[38:30] highlighting the fact that we would need
[38:32] it more and more in the last days
[38:34] oh yes definitely the world is getting
[38:37] together for this get together for that
[38:38] the assemble for that symbol for that
[38:40] but what about him
[38:42] amen how many are really making the
[38:44] sacrifices to sacrifice together
[38:47] together for him and in his presence
[38:49] amen is giving him the glory is giving
[38:52] him the honors giving him the praise
[38:54] giving him the preeminence
[38:56] amen in our lives
[38:58] morning noon and night consider brothers
[39:01] brothers what he did for you
[39:02] amen he gave he gave us preeminence amen
[39:06] and look what he did to lay down his
[39:08] life for you he suffered for you amen
[39:11] and he picked up that life again and
[39:13] come back
[39:14] just think come back to share it with us
[39:17] amen just thinking he was god he could
[39:19] do anything he wanted to do he could
[39:22] have wiped the whole thing off and as i
[39:24] said it started again
[39:25] which he which he already did he could
[39:27] have done it again
[39:28] because in the beginning god created the
[39:30] heaven and the earth
[39:31] and period amen and there and again
[39:35] like i said jeremiah referred to it and
[39:36] another another reference to it in the
[39:38] bible where god did create
[39:41] this create that but he destroyed it
[39:43] amen because everything was so turned
[39:45] over and given over to the devil he
[39:47] destroyed it all amen and that's why in
[39:50] the end those spirits are loosed out of
[39:52] the out of the river euphrates amen upon
[39:55] the world and brother maybe we're
[39:56] experiencing those things now
[39:58] because i tell you brother sister
[40:01] there's there's you know we don't see or
[40:03] experience much of the moving of the
[40:04] spirit of god over the world oh no but
[40:08] satan is in control as the prophet
[40:10] preached he is the god of this world
[40:13] that's right amen they're not worshiping
[40:15] jesus they're worshiping the devil
[40:17] oh yeah
[40:18] or they're giving free image to the
[40:19] devil
[40:20] sometimes they think they're giving
[40:22] preemies to god but it's the devil oh my
[40:24] lord keep our spirit right our attitude
[40:26] right amen and and check everything with
[40:29] the word
[40:30] amen are we lining up with the word are
[40:32] we doing this according to the word it's
[40:33] just your leadership jesus or is it mine
[40:36] amen or is it the devil amen so i pray
[40:39] the grace of god as christ in our hearts
[40:42] working out
[40:43] amen what he's worked in through his
[40:45] word amen so again again let me remind
[40:48] you that that where is the devil's
[40:50] watchtower is it in our brain
[40:53] in our brains and our knowledge and our
[40:55] reasoning in our feelings and so on but
[40:58] god is in the heart
[41:00] amen and brother we're going by faith
[41:03] the revelation spiritual revelation of
[41:05] the will of god according to the word of
[41:07] god and it's in our hearts amen when i
[41:10] go according to our flesh
[41:12] we're not going according to our just
[41:14] human spirit but the holy spirit
[41:17] and i trust he's in trouble control of
[41:18] you today amen amen that you're you're
[41:22] allowing him to govern your life
[41:24] by the holy ghost amen to the lord bless
[41:27] us and again as i said we welcome my
[41:29] sister delfina and and sister ellen amen
[41:32] and it's australian from tanzania i
[41:34] believe
[41:35] amen so but again
[41:37] according to the grace of god to us that
[41:39] we've been ministering to maybe over 62
[41:42] countries around the world
[41:43] over many many many years
[41:46] and as i've said when i went to that
[41:49] convention somewhere in the in tucson i
[41:51] think and we met that that uh colored
[41:54] brother
[41:54] and
[41:56] and he tapping on my shoulder and so on
[41:58] oh he said and he knew by the tay
[42:01] where we were from and so on thank you
[42:04] thank you for what you did amen and we
[42:07] we thank god for brother
[42:09] mark's burden to do what he did when it
[42:11] comes to typing typing out three
[42:13] messages
[42:14] in swahili i believe
[42:16] language yeah and that's what that
[42:18] brother tapped me on the shoulder for to
[42:20] thank me for for what the believers in
[42:22] newfoundland did in providing those
[42:24] messages
[42:26] he said that was the first message
[42:27] material we ever had in our language oh
[42:30] i said well praise the lord amen well i
[42:33] believe the lord laid it on our brother
[42:34] mark's heart to do it amen
[42:37] because they they were hungry and
[42:38] thirsting for it
[42:40] and maybe it's through that and other
[42:41] things we've done as they said he said
[42:44] you started over brother in edmonton
[42:46] told me you start you brother and have
[42:47] started over 300 churches in africa
[42:50] alone
[42:51] amen and he said they're still growing
[42:54] well to god be the glory
[42:56] we believe we're nearing the end we
[42:58] believe it'll it'll all soon be over
[43:01] am i trust by grace that we have done
[43:03] what god wants us to do amen in the last
[43:06] days
[43:07] praise the lord so i pray the grace of
[43:09] god to continue blessing what we've done
[43:12] but you let it be for his glory
[43:14] not us but for the glory of god so we'll
[43:16] give the glory to god for what he's done
[43:19] and what he's doing amen pray it's
[43:21] amazing but let it continue on to
[43:23] eternity amen and maybe is like the
[43:27] father of god beyond the curtain of time
[43:29] and the angel pointed that sister to him
[43:31] and she only young
[43:33] but
[43:33] the angel said brother random he said
[43:36] she was 95 years old when you let her to
[43:38] the lord
[43:40] 95 and you couldn't believe it
[43:42] because now she was only about 20 years
[43:44] old or look maybe 20 or 21 years old so
[43:47] like i said our young people is going to
[43:49] be 20 or 21 years old our older folks
[43:51] are going to be 20 or 21. amen
[43:54] as i said the old will be young there
[43:56] forever
[43:58] amen transformed in a moment of time
[44:01] amen by the grace of god and again like
[44:03] i said there's not going to be no no
[44:05] infant of days no no man that did not
[44:07] fulfill these days no no because we're
[44:09] going back to what god wants us to be
[44:12] sons and daughters just young men and
[44:14] women worshipping the lord
[44:16] praise the lord why because old age is a
[44:18] result of sin
[44:20] old ladies is what brought us to that
[44:22] amen it put us down now we grow up into
[44:25] old age but god has god has given us the
[44:28] word to give us the faith amen to go
[44:30] from time to eternity amen to focus not
[44:34] on the old age but on on a new body amen
[44:37] by the grace of god
[44:39] amen so god's blessings upon us and here
[44:42] and again those who are gathered with us
[44:44] online and as i have i was surprised
[44:48] uh to know
[44:50] that our brother ed cater was listening
[44:52] to us online
[44:54] amen i i was actually surprised because
[44:57] again our brother called us there a
[45:00] couple of days ago
[45:01] to let me know that yes he has come back
[45:05] to the lord amen
[45:07] because back years and years ago i've
[45:10] had fellowship with brother ed and of
[45:12] course he is that his brother alan cater
[45:14] you know he was in brother danny's
[45:16] church
[45:17] and of course our brother alex keator
[45:19] and i think he's in nova scotia right
[45:21] now
[45:22] so i'm with a fellowship and of course
[45:24] brother cater
[45:26] and brother catery's father used to have
[45:28] a
[45:29] message
[45:31] broadcast on on the radio oh yeah many
[45:33] years ago and i remember a couple of
[45:35] times once i think it's a couple of
[45:37] times that that he recorded sermons that
[45:39] i made and that was put on the radio
[45:42] and sermons by the manual bridge that
[45:44] was put on the radio so we thank brother
[45:46] brother cater for what he's did amen
[45:49] and being a witness for the message
[45:51] around different land amen to god be the
[45:54] glory amen but we welcome our brother ed
[45:57] cater back to the word back to the
[45:59] message
[46:00] amen and we trust that we'll experience
[46:02] more fellowship with our brother head
[46:04] amen it was a blessing when he called me
[46:07] on the phone but again i've it's only
[46:09] just recently that i've i've been
[46:11] praying for him
[46:12] and uh praying the grace of god in his
[46:14] heart and his soul amen knowing what god
[46:17] has done through him knowing what god
[46:20] did do and so on in newfoundland and the
[46:23] witness that he's given i pray grace to
[46:25] continue with him amen
[46:28] and we didn't know that he did leave the
[46:30] message
[46:31] and went on his own way and so on but
[46:34] again god got a hold of him and brought
[46:36] him back
[46:37] i'm surprised when i when
[46:40] he let me know that he was he was tuned
[46:42] in and listening to us online i said go
[46:45] god bless you brother amen so we don't
[46:48] know really who the lord is dealing with
[46:51] amen well and like i said it was it was
[46:53] surprised when he called
[46:55] to confirm that he was come back to the
[46:57] lord back to the word back to the
[46:58] message amen and of course he's uh
[47:02] he's told me he said well brother i'm
[47:04] not young anymore and he said i'm 72
[47:07] years old
[47:08] amen so we're about the same age so god
[47:11] bless brother ed cater amen
[47:15] it is absolutely tremendous
[47:17] i i can remember even now when our
[47:20] brother basically first come to the word
[47:21] to the message and i remember sitting in
[47:24] that large
[47:25] church in bishop falls and up there in
[47:28] the middle somewhere with our brother ed
[47:29] cater oh yeah and he was sitting there
[47:32] and he was worshiping the lord amen
[47:34] praise the lord and it came a time as i
[47:36] said when he did walk away from it
[47:39] and but now god has brought him back to
[47:41] god be the glory and also to remember uh
[47:44] of course his wife rosalie
[47:46] and he
[47:48] left me with the understanding that his
[47:49] son timothy wanted to be baptized
[47:52] in the name of the lord jesus christ so
[47:54] we pray the lord open the way
[47:56] for timothy to be baptized amen
[47:59] so the grace of god be with us and of
[48:02] course to also welcome our brother
[48:03] philip and sister susan back to
[48:05] newfoundland
[48:06] from all the way from the yukon
[48:08] amen from the extreme west to the
[48:11] extreme east
[48:12] amen so god bless her and like i said we
[48:15] remember our fellowship with her for
[48:17] quite a while amen here in the assembly
[48:20] so god and i think the 19th as i said
[48:23] should be flying back
[48:25] so we pray the grace of god be with her
[48:27] amen
[48:28] and again
[48:30] uh i was highlighted by the fact that oh
[48:32] that they're
[48:34] that even there
[48:35] that they were
[48:37] getting us
[48:38] back there years ago they were getting
[48:40] us on online
[48:41] and so on so again we don't know who
[48:44] else is listening to us online
[48:46] i was advised that there's brethren and
[48:48] even in africa
[48:49] and he said right and he said they'll go
[48:51] into a certain place where they have
[48:53] those
[48:54] things where they can view things online
[48:56] and they go in and listen to us online
[48:58] so god bless them amen in africa maybe
[49:01] in india maybe in other parts of the
[49:03] world as well by the grace of god to god
[49:06] be the glory
[49:07] and thinking again of hearing from
[49:09] brother ed and his recommitment to the
[49:12] word to the lord as the lord as what
[49:14] else have we done and what else are we
[49:16] doing i said we'll leave that with you
[49:18] amen eternity will tell
[49:21] it'll be revealed in eternity because
[49:24] our brother ed when the lord was dealing
[49:26] with him he did call his brother alec as
[49:28] i said alec was here for a few months
[49:31] and so brother alex told him to call
[49:33] brother the journal
[49:34] so
[49:35] so we had wonderful fellowship on the on
[49:37] the phone

[49:44] and the grace of god with our brother
[49:46] again our brother alec in in nova scotia

[50:02] interested in fellowship now than we
[50:04] were back then oh yes definitely because
[50:06] we're getting closer and closer to the
[50:08] end of all things
[50:10] so god be with us and god help us and
[50:12] god help us to stay true to the word

[56:52] ephesians chapter four again to echo the
[56:55] welcoming to the different ones that are
[56:56] here or back and then it's good to have
[56:59] each one here including those that are
[57:02] online amen ephesians chapter four
[57:04] familiar verse we've covered it before
[57:06] in one other service but we're going to
[57:07] take it from a different angle this
[57:09] morning
[57:10] ephesians 4 verse 29 says let no corrupt
[57:13] communication proceed out of your mouth
[57:15] but that which is good to the use of
[57:17] edifying that it may minister grace unto
[57:20] the hearers
[57:21] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[57:23] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[57:25] redemption
[57:26] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[57:28] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[57:31] from you with all malice and be ye kind
[57:34] one to another tenderhearted forgiving
[57:36] one another even as god for christ's
[57:39] sake hath forgiven you amen you can have
[57:42] your seats this morning god bless the
[57:43] reading of his word and then we spoke
[57:45] last time on the gifts within the body
[57:47] we covered what a spiritual gift was it
[57:49] was something that could be anointed and
[57:50] used by god for god's purpose and then
[57:52] we cover the goal and the the the effect
[57:55] of those gifts when they're in operation
[57:57] when it's a spiritual gift in operation
[57:59] we know that when it's a carnal gift in
[58:00] operation all it brings is death but
[58:02] when it's a spiritual gift all it brings
[58:04] is life amen the separation is easily
[58:06] seen if it's bringing destruction if
[58:07] it's bringing death that's not god
[58:09] that's satan working but when it's
[58:10] bringing forth life according to the
[58:12] word you know that a spiritual gift is
[58:14] in operation amen and paul said that the
[58:16] the gifts were given to edify that was
[58:18] to build to strengthen up to encourage
[58:20] to bring other people to their place in
[58:23] christ amen and today we want to cover a
[58:25] little bit more on gifts but we want to
[58:26] take it from a different angle and i
[58:28] want to take
[58:29] a title of when god speaks amen when god
[58:31] speaks and last service we close with a
[58:34] very powerful quote that brother branham
[58:36] made and i want to read it again to set
[58:37] the tone for this service and he says
[58:39] now let me tell you something each man
[58:41] that's born again with the spirit of god
[58:43] in him is a miniature creator now that
[58:46] might shake you a little but that's the
[58:48] truth we're in the image of god and god
[58:50] is a creator that's the reason you can
[58:53] believe that god could heal a person is
[58:55] because god is in you and god made this
[58:58] world he just spoke it and his word
[59:00] became material the very ground that
[59:03] you're sitting on is the word of god
[59:05] made manifest
[59:06] if he didn't where does he get it see he
[59:09] just spoke it and it turned into
[59:11] existence he believed in his own word
[59:14] he says now and if a man is born of the
[59:17] spirit of god he is an offspring of god
[59:20] and that part of god is in him and he
[59:23] believes every word that god says will
[59:25] materialize see and so that makes him
[59:28] part of god the holy spirit in the man
[59:31] makes him a part of god
[59:34] amen brother branham takes us right back
[59:36] to genesis 1 and he says look you're
[59:38] standing today literally on the
[59:40] manifested word of god the earth that
[59:42] you're standing on the dirt that you're
[59:43] standing on it wasn't always here in
[59:45] that way but what you're standing on is
[59:47] because he spoke it and out of that
[59:49] speaking there came forth what a reality
[59:52] a manifestation of what he was speaking
[59:54] amen so let's take it back to the
[59:55] scriptures this morning of where brother
[59:57] branham gets us from in genesis 1 1 says
[1:00:00] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:00:02] and the earth
[1:00:03] he created it amen
[1:00:06] doesn't mean it was formed from
[1:00:07] something else but he created it he
[1:00:09] brought it out of nothing and the earth
[1:00:11] now after he created it there's a
[1:00:13] separation of time here between creating
[1:00:15] the heaven and the earth and verse 2
[1:00:16] says and the earth was without form and
[1:00:18] void that means it was there was
[1:00:20] something there but it wasn't in order
[1:00:22] it was in chaos and it lacked those
[1:00:24] defined features and characteristics
[1:00:25] that we see today in other words it was
[1:00:27] a mess the earth was a mess
[1:00:30] the scripture says and darkness was upon
[1:00:32] the face of the deep
[1:00:33] and then it says and the spirit of god
[1:00:36] moved upon the face of the waters now i
[1:00:39] want you to catch something here the
[1:00:40] spirit is moving but it has no effect
[1:00:44] the spirit is moving but there's nothing
[1:00:46] happening it's moving over the face of
[1:00:47] the waters because all of the earth is
[1:00:49] covered in water but there's nothing
[1:00:51] happening yet why because the spirit of
[1:00:53] god has not been given direction on what
[1:00:55] to move
[1:00:56] it hasn't been given direction on what
[1:00:57] to change it hasn't been given direction
[1:00:59] on how things are supposed to look here
[1:01:01] so it's moving it's it's hovering over
[1:01:04] that earth and it's waiting for
[1:01:06] direction but it can't do anything
[1:01:08] it can't do anything but then we see in
[1:01:09] verse three it says and god said
[1:01:12] let there be light
[1:01:15] and there was light
[1:01:16] now you'll notice here we've got the
[1:01:18] what we've got a full set of colons here
[1:01:20] don't we
[1:01:21] god said let there be light and then
[1:01:23] there's a gap
[1:01:25] there's a period of time there and we
[1:01:26] don't know if that was one minute we
[1:01:28] don't know if that was one second we
[1:01:29] don't know if that was a million years
[1:01:31] between the time that he said let there
[1:01:32] be light and there was light but that is
[1:01:35] given there because it meant there's a
[1:01:37] period of time between what he said and
[1:01:39] what happened but the point is he said
[1:01:41] it and it happened amen but we don't
[1:01:43] look at the period of time we look at
[1:01:45] what he said and then we trust that what
[1:01:46] he said is going to happen and the
[1:01:48] scripture follows on it says and god saw
[1:01:50] the light that it was good and god
[1:01:52] divided the light from the darkness and
[1:01:55] then the spirit was hovering and now the
[1:01:56] spirit is put into action because what
[1:01:59] god spoke right it gave it direction it
[1:02:01] gave it purpose and now all of a sudden
[1:02:03] it says all right now i've got a job to
[1:02:05] do and it does what it brings forth
[1:02:07] light
[1:02:08] amen and darkness was or sorry and god
[1:02:11] saw the light that it was good and god
[1:02:13] divided the light from the darkness and
[1:02:15] god called the light day and the
[1:02:16] darkness he called night and the evening
[1:02:18] and the morning were the first day
[1:02:21] verse 6 says and god said
[1:02:24] and god said
[1:02:26] let there be a firmament in the midst of
[1:02:28] the waters and let it divide the waters
[1:02:30] from the waters and god made the
[1:02:32] firmament and divided the waters which
[1:02:34] were under the firmament from the waters
[1:02:36] which were above the firmament and it
[1:02:38] was so so we have and god said and then
[1:02:40] we have a period of time where it
[1:02:41] happens and then it says and it was so
[1:02:44] so while it's happening it wasn't so but
[1:02:46] it was in the fruits right it was in the
[1:02:48] par it was in the process of manifesting
[1:02:50] but it wasn't done until it was so so we
[1:02:53] have god said then we have it happening
[1:02:55] and then we have and it was so right god
[1:02:57] puts the emphasis behind it says all
[1:02:59] right we've got to finish work here amen
[1:03:01] and god called the firmament heaven and
[1:03:03] the evening and the morning were the
[1:03:04] second day now there is no creative work
[1:03:07] that's happened here yet aside from
[1:03:08] light
[1:03:10] all he's doing is he's separating
[1:03:12] there's things there that need to be
[1:03:13] moved into place there's things that
[1:03:15] have to be put into order in order for
[1:03:17] him to now put life in there amen but
[1:03:19] the spirit's just moving and separating
[1:03:21] things amen so that firmament's there
[1:03:24] right the water's there but he's now
[1:03:26] taking it and he's putting the
[1:03:27] separation between the two so that
[1:03:29] you've got a land and you've got a water
[1:03:30] and a place for people to live
[1:03:32] he says and god said let the waters
[1:03:35] under the heaven be gathered together
[1:03:36] into one place and let the dry land
[1:03:38] appear and it was so so he's moving
[1:03:41] things into position
[1:03:42] now he's not creating he's just moving
[1:03:45] things into position for what he's going
[1:03:47] to create next right god isn't always
[1:03:49] creating sometimes he's moving things
[1:03:51] into position everything he needs is
[1:03:53] there to support life but he's got to
[1:03:54] get it in its order in order for that
[1:03:56] life to be able to sustain once he
[1:03:58] brings it forth amen
[1:03:59] god's orchestrating what a place for his
[1:04:01] creation to exist
[1:04:04] it says and god called the dry land
[1:04:05] earth and the gathering together of the
[1:04:07] waters called he sees and god saw that
[1:04:10] it was good now brother brown says this
[1:04:12] he says now it's been in all ages when
[1:04:14] god first made creation in the
[1:04:15] phenomenal way when he spoke the world
[1:04:17] into existence and said
[1:04:19] and blow the stars and moon off his
[1:04:21] hands as they say he expressed the word
[1:04:23] and it came into existence the very
[1:04:26] earth that you're sitting on today was
[1:04:27] the created word of god if he didn't
[1:04:30] speak the word into existence where did
[1:04:32] he get the material to make it out of
[1:04:34] where did it come from sure he did he
[1:04:35] spoke it into existence it's the word of
[1:04:39] god he says the very dirt and things
[1:04:41] you're setting on today
[1:04:43] is the creative word of god amen now
[1:04:46] that sounds great but watch how he flips
[1:04:48] this now and he says you're here because
[1:04:51] you come into creation by the speaking
[1:04:54] of the word of god every one of you amen
[1:04:57] he doesn't say don't just look to this
[1:04:59] earth and say that was created by him it
[1:05:01] was spoken into existence it was brought
[1:05:03] in by a supernatural event but he says
[1:05:05] you're here by the very same process
[1:05:07] that this world is here today and it is
[1:05:09] what by the spoken word of god amen
[1:05:13] but if we look at these first couple of
[1:05:15] days that are here in genesis where
[1:05:16] god's working he's doing what he's
[1:05:18] separating things he's separating light
[1:05:20] from darkness he's separating land from
[1:05:22] sea and these different things and he's
[1:05:24] creating something
[1:05:25] right he's not a he's not a haphazard
[1:05:27] god he doesn't just do things to show
[1:05:29] he's god but he's got a purpose behind
[1:05:32] it amen and he's starting to show that
[1:05:34] purpose as he moves in now watch in
[1:05:36] verse 11. he says and god said let the
[1:05:38] earth bring forth grass and the herb
[1:05:41] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[1:05:42] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:05:45] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[1:05:47] so
[1:05:48] god said there's a process and then it
[1:05:50] was so
[1:05:51] amen if you're stuck in the process
[1:05:53] thing don't worry right god's moving
[1:05:56] just trust that if he said it the
[1:05:58] process will work out to bring it to and
[1:06:00] it was so it says and the earth brought
[1:06:03] forth grass
[1:06:04] god didn't create this everything that
[1:06:06] he needed was already in there
[1:06:08] amen the scripture brother jail talked
[1:06:10] about this before the service in
[1:06:11] jeremiah in these different places it
[1:06:12] talks about what a fallen civilization
[1:06:15] these things were already in the earth
[1:06:17] to bring forth what was needed to
[1:06:18] support life
[1:06:20] and he said let it bring forth he didn't
[1:06:22] say let there be apple seeds and orange
[1:06:25] seeds and grass and everything he said
[1:06:26] no no no let's what's in there come
[1:06:28] forth and it'll support life
[1:06:31] it says and the earth brought forth the
[1:06:33] earth obeyed the spoken word and her
[1:06:36] building seed after his kind and the
[1:06:37] tree yielding free fruit who see was in
[1:06:40] itself after his kind and god saw that
[1:06:42] it was good and the evening and the
[1:06:44] morning were in the third day amen he
[1:06:46] doesn't create anything here he says
[1:06:48] just let's what's have what's inside of
[1:06:50] it come out amen amen but this is a part
[1:06:53] of creation is bringing out what's in
[1:06:55] something already
[1:06:57] amen
[1:06:58] those seeds were there and they were
[1:06:59] waiting to come forth and they couldn't
[1:07:01] come forth until the spoken word of god
[1:07:03] what set a stage where they could
[1:07:05] survive because they were all under
[1:07:06] water
[1:07:08] and then he had to call him forth when
[1:07:10] he chose to
[1:07:12] now after he separated the sea in the
[1:07:14] land they could have come forth at any
[1:07:16] time the light was there to do it but it
[1:07:18] wasn't until he spoke and said let him
[1:07:20] come forth that's when they came forth
[1:07:22] amen what is it the word seed of god
[1:07:24] coming forth in its time amen there's a
[1:07:27] time and a season for it until god comes
[1:07:29] forth we can't bring a child of god out
[1:07:31] that's right amen but when god speaks
[1:07:33] they'll come forth and they'll bring
[1:07:34] forth fruit amen
[1:07:37] and then sometimes we look at ourselves
[1:07:38] and we think i failed yesterday i failed
[1:07:41] today have i crossed the line between
[1:07:43] mercy and judgment you know have i
[1:07:45] spurned the word of god one last time
[1:07:47] what he's showing here is what's in you
[1:07:49] has got to come out and it doesn't
[1:07:51] matter what you do it doesn't matter
[1:07:52] what you say it's never going to change
[1:07:54] you from a child of hell into a child of
[1:07:56] god or a child of god back into a child
[1:07:58] of hell i mean that's a that's a it's a
[1:08:00] mental concept it's a world concept that
[1:08:02] we were one thing and we became another
[1:08:04] no in god's word it shows us that we
[1:08:06] always were one thing and if you are a
[1:08:08] child of hell you will always be a child
[1:08:10] of hell and if you are a child of god
[1:08:11] you will always be a child of god i was
[1:08:14] listening to anointed ones at the end
[1:08:15] time this morning brother brahms quotes
[1:08:17] a scripture where he says it will become
[1:08:19] so close at the end that it will deceive
[1:08:20] the very elect if it was possible and he
[1:08:23] says you can't deceive the elect because
[1:08:25] it's in the roots it's in them to be
[1:08:28] what they are going to be and so you
[1:08:29] cannot deceive someone out of being what
[1:08:31] they are going to be if you're an eagle
[1:08:33] it doesn't matter how long they tell you
[1:08:35] you're a chicken or a duck if you keep
[1:08:37] feeding it then guess what an eagle's
[1:08:40] going to come out whether they want you
[1:08:41] to or not and he says it's the same
[1:08:43] thing you can't be deceived from being a
[1:08:45] child of god because you are a child of
[1:08:47] god and all you can produce is what a
[1:08:49] child of god produces which is what the
[1:08:51] word right so he says don't be worried
[1:08:53] about where you're going to end up if
[1:08:55] you are a child of god you'll always be
[1:08:57] a child of god
[1:08:58] amen don't worry about what's going on
[1:09:00] don't worry about where you fall but
[1:09:02] rather rest in what that he has called
[1:09:04] you he has placed you he always meant
[1:09:06] for you to be a part of him and
[1:09:07] therefore he'll never lose you he can't
[1:09:10] lose you amen
[1:09:11] so what is it you you you can't change
[1:09:13] yourself from a sinner into a saint amen
[1:09:16] that's just what that's just us looking
[1:09:18] at the exterior
[1:09:20] amen we don't become magically something
[1:09:22] else but what we have a new birth when
[1:09:24] that's when the holy ghost comes in
[1:09:25] that's what the new birth is it's not
[1:09:26] being baptized it's not repenting the
[1:09:28] new birth is when you get a new life
[1:09:30] amen the old life dies a new one comes
[1:09:32] in and it's only through the holy spirit
[1:09:34] so it's not sin that's going to separate
[1:09:36] us from god amen you can't be we're
[1:09:37] sealed to the day of our redemption but
[1:09:39] what does sin do then all sin does is it
[1:09:41] puts a barrier up in your life to break
[1:09:43] communion with you and god
[1:09:45] amen so what you you don't lose your
[1:09:47] salvation but you lose the joy of your
[1:09:49] salvation right what happens is you lose
[1:09:51] your peace and something else comes in
[1:09:53] because what the holy spirit the
[1:09:55] presence of the holy spirit the feeling
[1:09:57] of the holy spirit that that anointing
[1:09:59] that we have on our lives it gets what
[1:10:01] pulled away from us our soul is sealed
[1:10:03] but the rest of our body now is left to
[1:10:05] fight with its own things because what
[1:10:07] the holy spirit's pulled away right your
[1:10:10] soul's in no danger but the rest of you
[1:10:11] has got to fight with what it has and
[1:10:13] guess what that's never going to be a
[1:10:14] match for satan so what do you have to
[1:10:16] do you have to make things right with
[1:10:17] god in order to let the holy spirit come
[1:10:19] in and now take preeminence over what
[1:10:21] your spirit and your outward man amen
[1:10:24] isaiah 59 and this is speaking to when
[1:10:26] you have
[1:10:27] situations in your life and and this was
[1:10:29] speaking to israel of course and you
[1:10:31] know they got into situations where they
[1:10:33] were under slavery and they were
[1:10:35] conquered and they couldn't worship the
[1:10:36] same way and these different things and
[1:10:38] isaiah says this he says behold the
[1:10:40] lord's hand is not shortened that it
[1:10:42] cannot save neither his ears heavy that
[1:10:45] it cannot hear he says don't blame god
[1:10:47] for when things aren't going well
[1:10:49] right
[1:10:50] why he says but your iniquities have
[1:10:52] separated between you and your god and
[1:10:55] your sins have hit his face from you
[1:10:56] that he will not hear
[1:10:58] amen when things aren't going well take
[1:11:00] a look at your own life don't say lord
[1:11:02] what's wrong with you say lord what's
[1:11:04] wrong with me that something's going on
[1:11:06] in my life that doesn't seem to belong
[1:11:07] in the life of a believer amen the new
[1:11:10] birth closes the gap that we have
[1:11:12] between god but we still have two-thirds
[1:11:13] of our body that is unredeemed amen and
[1:11:16] so you've got that fight day in and day
[1:11:18] out day out and you notice when jesus
[1:11:20] said he said you know he went to peter
[1:11:22] and he wanted to wash his feet and peter
[1:11:24] said lord don't wash my feet you know
[1:11:26] don't touch anything i'm not worthy and
[1:11:28] he said look unless i wash your feet you
[1:11:29] have no part of me and they said well
[1:11:31] wash everything then he said no no you
[1:11:33] don't need that he says you just need to
[1:11:34] wash your feet why because it's your
[1:11:36] daily walk when you're out and you're
[1:11:37] interacting with the world in these
[1:11:39] different things what happens is you're
[1:11:40] getting what attacked and satan's
[1:11:42] throwing dirt and satan's throwing dirt
[1:11:44] at you to try and see if it'll hold on
[1:11:45] for a little bit and what did jesus say
[1:11:47] you got to wash that off on a regular
[1:11:49] basis say man you got to make sure
[1:11:50] there's no little clingers on your robe
[1:11:52] if we can put it that way what is it
[1:11:54] satan trying to get something on you to
[1:11:55] cause a separation between you and the
[1:11:57] holy spirit working in your life amen
[1:12:01] going back to genesis and god said let
[1:12:03] there be lights in the firmament of
[1:12:05] heaven to divide the day from the night
[1:12:07] and let them be for signs and for
[1:12:09] seasons and for days and years and let
[1:12:12] them be for lights in the firmament of
[1:12:13] heaven to give light upon the earth and
[1:12:15] it was so this is spoken word
[1:12:18] this is spoken word god says it now and
[1:12:19] it comes into that it says and god made
[1:12:21] two great lights the greater light to
[1:12:23] rule the day and the lesser light to
[1:12:25] ruin the night rule the night he made
[1:12:27] the stars also and god set them in the
[1:12:29] firmament of heaven to give light upon
[1:12:31] the earth and to rule over the day and
[1:12:34] over the night and to divide the light
[1:12:35] from the darkness and god saw that it
[1:12:37] was good and the evening and the morning
[1:12:39] were the fourth day
[1:12:41] now i want you to notice something here
[1:12:42] is that god has just set a calendar in
[1:12:44] the earth in a time when they are in
[1:12:46] eternity
[1:12:47] why
[1:12:48] because he's looking down through time
[1:12:50] and he's seeing that we're going to need
[1:12:51] a time of seasons we're going to need a
[1:12:52] way to have a calendar because he's
[1:12:54] going to put things according to that
[1:12:55] calendar with the jews god is very
[1:12:57] specific with time they can literally
[1:12:59] count down to the day
[1:13:01] to the year certainly when god's going
[1:13:02] to do something because he deals with
[1:13:04] him on a very strict calendar so he puts
[1:13:06] in his creation a way for them to track
[1:13:08] what he's told them he's going to do
[1:13:10] before there was ever a need for it
[1:13:12] what is it he's looking down he's seeing
[1:13:13] the need he's jehovah jiren amen and he
[1:13:15] puts here a place and a time for seasons
[1:13:17] and signs and these different things
[1:13:19] he's got his whole order there because
[1:13:21] remember he says what i'll do nothing
[1:13:22] except i show it to my servants the
[1:13:24] prophets first but he says he always
[1:13:25] shows it in the heavens as well so we've
[1:13:27] got a whole calendar built in from
[1:13:29] eternity to show us what time and season
[1:13:31] we're in amen
[1:13:32] before it was ever needed what is it god
[1:13:34] said and it was so so that we'd have
[1:13:36] something to fall back on amen
[1:13:39] but i want you to catch something here
[1:13:40] as we've worked through these these
[1:13:42] first few days so we worked through the
[1:13:43] first four days and all we have here is
[1:13:45] god speaking and the spirit moves and it
[1:13:48] happens
[1:13:49] right this is spoken word if i could say
[1:13:51] it this way god was sitting up on his
[1:13:53] great throne and he's speaking these
[1:13:54] tremendous words of power and authority
[1:13:57] and what happens is the holy spirit
[1:13:58] moves out and it makes it happen but as
[1:14:00] we step into the fifth day which is
[1:14:02] grace we start to see something and
[1:14:04] that's we see god step out of his throne
[1:14:06] he starts to actually work inside of his
[1:14:08] creation he starts to come down and the
[1:14:10] words change even though the english
[1:14:11] sounds the same if you look in the greek
[1:14:13] the words change and it starts to talk
[1:14:14] about god now getting his hands dirty
[1:14:16] where he starts to take what he's made
[1:14:18] already and he starts to recombine it
[1:14:20] and he starts to use the elements of
[1:14:21] what he's built to make something else
[1:14:24] and we see this here now in verse 20 it
[1:14:25] says and god said let the waters bring
[1:14:27] forth abundantly the moving creature
[1:14:30] that had life and fowl that may fly
[1:14:32] above the earth in the open firmament of
[1:14:34] heaven he says let the water bring forth
[1:14:35] fish in the and and the other the you
[1:14:38] know the the skies and these different
[1:14:39] things to bring forth
[1:14:40] birds but this is not spoken word he
[1:14:43] says and god created
[1:14:45] now and you go in the greek and this is
[1:14:47] a different word this is not just to
[1:14:48] bring about but this is to form
[1:14:51] he makes something and if you look at
[1:14:52] animals they say you can look down and
[1:14:54] you can see the path of what the
[1:14:55] cellular structure and how it goes from
[1:14:57] one to the other to the other there's a
[1:14:59] whole there's a whole order to all of it
[1:15:01] and if you consider that it was a divine
[1:15:02] creator it would make sense that he
[1:15:04] built things up from things that were
[1:15:06] amen right
[1:15:08] and god created great whales and every
[1:15:10] living creature that moveth which the
[1:15:11] waters brought forth abundantly after
[1:15:13] their kind and every wing foul after his
[1:15:15] kind and god saw that it was good and
[1:15:17] god blessed them saying be fruitful and
[1:15:19] multiply and fill the waters in the seas
[1:15:21] and let vowel multiply in the earth and
[1:15:23] the evening in the morning were the
[1:15:24] fifth day now notice here he didn't say
[1:15:26] and god said and it was so it says and
[1:15:29] god said and then god moves to fulfill
[1:15:31] his own word now he's got something to
[1:15:34] work with that he's created by the
[1:15:35] spoken word and now he comes in he says
[1:15:37] now i'm going to work with what i have
[1:15:39] and i'm going to produce what my word
[1:15:40] said what this is grace this is grace
[1:15:43] where he takes what he's got and he
[1:15:44] turns it into something bigger and
[1:15:46] better amen
[1:15:48] verse 24 and god said let the earth
[1:15:50] bring forth the living creature after
[1:15:52] his kind cattle and creeping thing and
[1:15:54] beasts of the earth after his kind it
[1:15:56] says now and it was so but the next one
[1:15:58] says and god made
[1:16:01] he's stepping down again he says and god
[1:16:03] made the beast of the earth after his
[1:16:05] kind and cattle after their kind and
[1:16:06] everything that creepeth upon the earth
[1:16:08] after his kind and god saw that it was
[1:16:10] good and god said let us make man in our
[1:16:14] image after our likeness and let them
[1:16:16] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:16:18] to foul the air over the cattle over all
[1:16:20] the earth and over every creeping thing
[1:16:22] that creepeth upon the earth
[1:16:24] and so god created a man in his own
[1:16:26] image and the image of god created he
[1:16:28] him male and female created he them and
[1:16:30] god blessed them and god said unto them
[1:16:33] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[1:16:35] the earth now the word replenish means
[1:16:37] what repopulate so it means it was
[1:16:39] populated before
[1:16:41] amen so what this is the big restart
[1:16:43] this is the big restart and now it's
[1:16:45] driven by what now the spoken word if i
[1:16:48] were to offer an opinion it was only
[1:16:49] mine that first one he let them go the
[1:16:51] way they wanted and all it ended up was
[1:16:53] in destruction he said this isn't going
[1:16:54] to work i'm going to have to give them a
[1:16:56] word to hold them i'm going to have to
[1:16:57] put a part of me in there that's going
[1:16:59] to hold them to something because
[1:17:00] otherwise it's just going to continue to
[1:17:01] go back to destruction time and time
[1:17:03] again that's just me it's not even thus
[1:17:05] saith john it's just my idea take it or
[1:17:07] leave it amen
[1:17:09] but he says what and god created so he
[1:17:11] created a man in his own image it says
[1:17:12] and god bless them and said unto them be
[1:17:14] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[1:17:16] earth and subdue it and have dominion
[1:17:18] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:17:20] fowl of the air and over every living
[1:17:22] thing that moved upon the earth amen so
[1:17:25] god has now personally finished off
[1:17:26] creation and now he's having a
[1:17:28] conversation with his creation and we
[1:17:30] went from what and god said and it was
[1:17:32] so to and god said and god created
[1:17:36] and then it was so amen so we have god
[1:17:38] now working in and amongst his con his
[1:17:41] creation it says and god said behold i
[1:17:44] have given you every herb bearing seed
[1:17:46] which is upon the face of all the earth
[1:17:48] and every tree in which the fruit of a
[1:17:49] tree yielding seed to you it shall be
[1:17:51] for me
[1:17:52] and to every beast of the earth and to
[1:17:54] every fowl of the air into everything
[1:17:55] that creepeth upon the earth wherein
[1:17:57] there is life i have given green herbs
[1:17:59] for meat and it was so amen the original
[1:18:01] diet was vegan
[1:18:03] everything ate vegetables and and
[1:18:04] grasses and whatnot amen but we're in a
[1:18:07] fallen condition now which is why we
[1:18:08] must have meat amen praise the lord amen
[1:18:12] but it says here and god said
[1:18:14] and then he says i've given you dominion
[1:18:16] over everything and it was so and he
[1:18:17] placed man as what ruler over all of the
[1:18:20] earth
[1:18:20] and then he puts him in a position of
[1:18:22] rulership he puts him in a position of
[1:18:24] power he puts him in a position of
[1:18:25] authority and he says and god said and
[1:18:27] he gives it to him and then he says and
[1:18:29] it was so and that's why we can say adam
[1:18:31] was what a mini god because god said
[1:18:33] that that was his position and he steps
[1:18:35] into it and now he becomes what god on
[1:18:37] earth right amen
[1:18:41] amen matt ruled earth as a god now
[1:18:42] that's a long ways for me to prove to
[1:18:44] you that the earth you're standing on is
[1:18:46] the spoken word of god
[1:18:47] amen but i want you to catch that it
[1:18:50] comes when when god speaks amen amen
[1:18:53] that the things that happen that are of
[1:18:54] spiritual value that are of eternal
[1:18:56] value that the things that are related
[1:18:58] to the word of god have to be spoken by
[1:19:00] god amen when he speaks it is so
[1:19:03] and that gap of time is where our test
[1:19:05] of faith is but if god has said it then
[1:19:07] it will be so and if god didn't say it
[1:19:09] then it will never be so in the way that
[1:19:11] it's supposed to be so amen
[1:19:14] so what was it that brought us from god
[1:19:15] said and it was so it's always the
[1:19:18] moving of the spirit it's the holy
[1:19:19] spirit that is released when god speaks
[1:19:22] to bring about that which is supposed to
[1:19:24] be amen so when we speak
[1:19:26] then what we're going to release some
[1:19:28] sort of spirit to go and do what we're
[1:19:30] going to ask amen and let me ask you is
[1:19:32] there only one spirit in all of this
[1:19:33] world or is there more than one because
[1:19:35] when you speak there's a spirit that's
[1:19:37] going to be released and you've got to
[1:19:38] make sure that you're speaking to
[1:19:39] release the holy spirit rather than
[1:19:41] speaking to allow satan into your life
[1:19:43] amen we'll get into that a little bit
[1:19:44] better amen what is it the word spoken
[1:19:48] releases the holy spirit to bring it to
[1:19:50] reality amen having set a foundation
[1:19:52] let's move on back to ephesians 4 now
[1:19:55] it says let no corrupt communication
[1:19:57] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[1:19:59] is good to the use of edifying amen
[1:20:02] everything we talk about when it comes
[1:20:03] to being in a body is that you must be
[1:20:05] edifying you have to be building up you
[1:20:07] have to be strengthening you have to be
[1:20:08] encouraging it is not a tearing down
[1:20:10] process god does the tearing down we do
[1:20:13] the building up if i could put it that
[1:20:14] way it's not that god doesn't build up
[1:20:16] but our purpose is to what is to grow
[1:20:18] it's to help other people to achieve
[1:20:19] what they're supposed to be in the body
[1:20:21] of christ it says but that which is good
[1:20:23] to the use of edifying that it may
[1:20:24] minister grace unto the hearers and the
[1:20:27] amplified says let no foul or polluting
[1:20:29] language nor evil word nor unwholesome
[1:20:32] or worthless talk
[1:20:34] ever come out of your mouth but only
[1:20:37] such speech as is good and beneficial to
[1:20:39] the spiritual progress of others
[1:20:42] as is fitting to the need and the
[1:20:44] occasion
[1:20:45] let me put it this way you can say
[1:20:46] something that you think is good and
[1:20:48] beneficial but if it is not actually to
[1:20:50] the time and season it's supposed to be
[1:20:52] spoken it's not going to have the right
[1:20:53] effect you've got to say the right thing
[1:20:55] at the right time scripture says a word
[1:20:57] fitly spoken is like apples of gold and
[1:20:59] pitchers of silver it's a beautiful
[1:21:01] thing amen but it is fitting to the need
[1:21:04] and occasion that it may be a blessing
[1:21:06] and give grace which is god's favor to
[1:21:08] those who hear it amen that's a mouthful
[1:21:12] pardon the pun amen paul says you don't
[1:21:15] let anything cross your mouth that
[1:21:18] contains this sort of thing
[1:21:20] nothing it says ever don't let it ever
[1:21:22] cross your mouth amen paul's just talked
[1:21:26] about setting the gifts in position he's
[1:21:28] talked about finding your place in the
[1:21:29] body and then he comes down and he
[1:21:31] finishes this this chapter with what
[1:21:34] words come out of your mouth
[1:21:36] amen because what we've just read what
[1:21:38] happens when god speaks
[1:21:41] but we've already recognized our
[1:21:42] position and we know that we are a part
[1:21:44] of god we are an attribute of god we are
[1:21:46] a piece of god if we have the holy
[1:21:48] spirit in us so when we speak what can
[1:21:50] we expect to happen
[1:21:52] if god said and it was so then when you
[1:21:54] speak it's going to be so as well but
[1:21:56] you got to make sure that you're
[1:21:57] speaking the right thing when you do it
[1:21:58] amen why because we see from the very
[1:22:00] beginning that the word spoken has
[1:22:02] created power
[1:22:03] and then so when you speak then expect
[1:22:05] something to go forth and happen amen
[1:22:07] and if you speak through the holy spirit
[1:22:09] then it will be creative because only
[1:22:10] god can create but if you speak and
[1:22:12] you're under another influence then it's
[1:22:14] going to be destructive because satan
[1:22:15] can only warp and manipulate and kill
[1:22:17] what god has already done amen
[1:22:19] satan tries to twist it and god tries to
[1:22:21] what grow it into what it's supposed to
[1:22:23] be amen
[1:22:25] brother bram says this he says i'm
[1:22:26] talking about an absolute remember we
[1:22:28] spoke about you have to get connected to
[1:22:30] christ and then he'll fit you into a
[1:22:31] body
[1:22:32] right and sometimes what we have is we
[1:22:34] have people trying to connect to the
[1:22:35] body and they're not connected to christ
[1:22:36] and that won't work i mean that's just
[1:22:38] somebody trying to put something on you
[1:22:40] know we don't and the thing is the world
[1:22:41] does that these days you can have just
[1:22:43] about anything you want added to your
[1:22:44] body
[1:22:45] you know and and it's a freaky thing but
[1:22:48] this is where we're getting at is people
[1:22:49] say well i just want to be a part of the
[1:22:50] body and they latch on and guess what
[1:22:52] they're not what they're supposed to be
[1:22:53] and the body rejects it and they rot and
[1:22:55] fall away
[1:22:56] the
[1:22:57] brother baby says this i'm talking about
[1:22:59] an absolute connected with christ he
[1:23:02] says then it makes you an odd person if
[1:23:03] you're an odd person you're not
[1:23:04] connected to christ you're odd because
[1:23:06] you're odd not because you're connected
[1:23:08] to christ
[1:23:09] okay but
[1:23:10] we laugh
[1:23:12] but how many people and we've all run
[1:23:14] across them where they're weird because
[1:23:15] they're weird and they've taken the
[1:23:17] message that god has given us and
[1:23:18] they've turned it into something that's
[1:23:20] so weird that they're of no value to
[1:23:22] anybody else
[1:23:23] you don't have to be that weird amen he
[1:23:25] says what get connected to christ and
[1:23:27] then you'll be odd and that means you'll
[1:23:29] be different you won't be common at all
[1:23:31] you'll do odd things
[1:23:33] now let me stop again you'll be odd and
[1:23:35] you'll do odd things
[1:23:36] even if you're not connected to christ
[1:23:38] but you take the word and you try and
[1:23:39] act on it because the world is what it
[1:23:41] is and it's never going to line up with
[1:23:42] the word of god but again the problem is
[1:23:45] not to do things that are odd the
[1:23:46] problem is to do things that are odd
[1:23:48] because you're connected to christ
[1:23:50] amen
[1:23:52] he says your thinking is all together
[1:23:54] different than the thinking you once did
[1:23:56] if your thinking has always been the
[1:23:58] same you haven't had the new birth
[1:24:02] because you have found something that
[1:24:04] you've anchored a faith in someone that
[1:24:06] created the heavens and the earth that
[1:24:08] his very word itself is creative a god
[1:24:11] who spoke the world into existence and
[1:24:13] there's nothing too hard for him you
[1:24:15] look at this world and then you say but
[1:24:17] he can't do what i want him to do
[1:24:20] you're standing on a living breathing
[1:24:22] organism if you want to put it that way
[1:24:24] that has sustained life for thousands
[1:24:25] and thousands of years and then you say
[1:24:27] but he can't do the little thing that
[1:24:29] i'm asking him to do in my life what's
[1:24:31] he saying he's saying there's nothing
[1:24:32] god can't do look at what it did the
[1:24:34] first time and how great that was and
[1:24:36] then look at your own life and say is
[1:24:38] that really compared to the creation of
[1:24:39] the worlds by spoken word amen
[1:24:42] he says there's nothing too hard for him
[1:24:43] so it makes you creative yourself
[1:24:47] because you take his word and a word is
[1:24:50] a thought expressed
[1:24:52] he says and people act funny they seem
[1:24:56] to just forget about the negative side
[1:24:58] because they have found an absolute
[1:25:00] because it's the word of god jesus said
[1:25:03] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:25:05] word shall never fail so if we've got
[1:25:08] the word of promise then there's no
[1:25:10] failing it to it it cannot fail
[1:25:14] and then you speak from the absolute in
[1:25:15] your position and in your in your your
[1:25:18] your situation and if that absolute can
[1:25:20] get focused on something other than the
[1:25:22] word of god then you're going to start
[1:25:24] to have problems but if you can hold
[1:25:25] your absolute to what the word says then
[1:25:27] you can trust that god said and it was
[1:25:30] so is going to happen in your life amen
[1:25:32] but he says here remember they seem to
[1:25:34] just forget about the negative side what
[1:25:36] when they've taken on a new way of
[1:25:37] thinking why because they've got the
[1:25:39] mind of christ now that's pointing them
[1:25:40] to the word rather than looking at the
[1:25:42] situation and when you start looking at
[1:25:44] the negative what happens is you start
[1:25:46] looking at the symptoms rather than the
[1:25:48] healing amen you start looking at the
[1:25:49] conflict rather than the resolution and
[1:25:51] the restoration and all of a sudden
[1:25:53] satan's got something to step into your
[1:25:55] life with and all of a sudden the holy
[1:25:56] spirit is nowhere to be found because
[1:25:58] you open the door for satan to do
[1:26:00] whatever he wants in your life amen and
[1:26:02] all of a sudden you're looking at where
[1:26:03] you failed last rather than what god has
[1:26:05] said you're going to be victorious over
[1:26:07] amen but catch the mind of god here and
[1:26:10] watch what happens brother braham says
[1:26:11] now if the blood of bulls and goats
[1:26:13] could give a power to moses to go out
[1:26:15] there by the commission of god and
[1:26:18] stretch forth that rod and say let there
[1:26:19] come flies he had the word of god and he
[1:26:22] spoke that word and when he did it
[1:26:24] become from god's thought amen he says a
[1:26:27] word is a thought expressed so when god
[1:26:29] thought it and put it in moses mind and
[1:26:33] he spoke it it became a word capital w
[1:26:37] now moses didn't think it god thought it
[1:26:39] god sends it to his prophet puts it in
[1:26:41] his mind to say it and then he speaks it
[1:26:43] and that becomes the word of god
[1:26:46] and moses turned around and went back
[1:26:48] maybe not a fly in the country in an
[1:26:50] hour from them maybe one old green fly
[1:26:52] began to buzz around in half an hour
[1:26:54] there was 10 pounds per square yard what
[1:26:56] was it the creative word of god that was
[1:26:58] spoken by the lips of a mortal man why
[1:27:01] because it was not spoken by his stuff
[1:27:03] but he caught the thought of god and it
[1:27:05] became what a word on his lip and a word
[1:27:09] is a thought expressed and when the word
[1:27:11] goes forth god said it and it was so
[1:27:14] amen
[1:27:15] when god says it into you and you speak
[1:27:18] it through your lips it will be so
[1:27:21] it has to be so amen
[1:27:23] now you've got to be careful with this
[1:27:24] because look at elisha elisha comes from
[1:27:26] his experience with getting what the
[1:27:28] road from elijah he's got a double
[1:27:30] portion he strikes the water he walks
[1:27:33] back across the river on dry land goes
[1:27:35] and performs a miracle and then he's
[1:27:37] walking and a bunch of kids come out and
[1:27:39] they start making fun of him and they
[1:27:41] say go up now bald head they're making
[1:27:43] fun of hud what he had just witnessed he
[1:27:45] just saw elijah take a rapture and these
[1:27:48] kids come out and they start making fun
[1:27:50] of him and he's got a double portion of
[1:27:51] the anointing and look at what he does
[1:27:53] he says and he turned back and looked on
[1:27:55] them and cursed them in the name of the
[1:27:58] lord and there came forth two she-bears
[1:28:01] out of the wood and tore 42 children of
[1:28:04] them
[1:28:07] what happened was
[1:28:08] he used his prophetic authority to bring
[1:28:10] judgment amen and that was not god as
[1:28:12] best i can tell
[1:28:14] right
[1:28:15] what is it you just move on you just
[1:28:18] move on and we see that with christ at
[1:28:20] the end he says what forgive them for
[1:28:22] they know what not what they do those
[1:28:24] kids had no idea who they were messing
[1:28:25] with they probably had parents that had
[1:28:27] talked funny about him in all
[1:28:28] probability you know and it had come
[1:28:30] down on them and they decided to go out
[1:28:32] and tease the man
[1:28:33] amen and what happened is what elisha
[1:28:36] overreacted before the sons of thunder
[1:28:38] were elisha was
[1:28:40] right and what oh lord we're going to
[1:28:42] call down and he called down the thunder
[1:28:43] didn't he and two bears came out and
[1:28:45] destroyed 42 children because he
[1:28:47] overreacted why because god
[1:28:50] backs up his prophets whether you like
[1:28:52] it or not moses had the same thing and
[1:28:54] it kept him out of the promised land
[1:28:55] didn't it he what he would not refuse
[1:28:58] his prophet's word now you and i aren't
[1:29:00] prophets amen we have a different
[1:29:01] position to take and god won't honor us
[1:29:03] the same way amen
[1:29:05] but you are the bride of christ
[1:29:08] right and the bride of christ has what
[1:29:10] she has the name of jesus attached to
[1:29:12] her she is a part of him she is a she is
[1:29:14] attached to him amen and when you speak
[1:29:17] negative things guess what there's
[1:29:19] authority behind the words that you
[1:29:21] speak
[1:29:22] that's why paul's saying don't do it is
[1:29:24] because there's authority when you speak
[1:29:25] and when you do somebody's going to obey
[1:29:28] somebody's going to come forward and
[1:29:29] they're going to live in those words
[1:29:30] amen if you don't speak the word the
[1:29:32] word can't go into action and if the
[1:29:34] word isn't going to get into action then
[1:29:35] what is there's only one other influence
[1:29:37] that can go into action that's satanic
[1:29:38] power every single time amen
[1:29:42] the minute you do that the minute you
[1:29:43] speak something negative into the
[1:29:45] situation you give satan an open door to
[1:29:46] come in and rob you of everything that
[1:29:49] you've worked so hard to build up to
[1:29:50] this point amen
[1:29:52] this is in the the church ages here he
[1:29:54] says i wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:29:56] impressed with the word in our midst let
[1:29:59] me give you a thought here how do we
[1:30:01] pray we pray in jesus name don't we
[1:30:04] every prayer is in his name or there
[1:30:06] isn't any answer
[1:30:08] yet in first john 5 14 we are told this
[1:30:10] is the confidence that we have in him
[1:30:12] that if we ask anything according to his
[1:30:14] will he heareth us and if we know that
[1:30:17] he hears us whatsoever we ask we know
[1:30:19] that we have the petitions we desired of
[1:30:21] him
[1:30:22] now we ask he says what is the will of
[1:30:24] god there is only one way to know his
[1:30:26] will and that is by the word of god
[1:30:28] lamentations 3 37 says who is he that
[1:30:31] sayeth and it cometh to pass when the
[1:30:33] lord commandeth it not
[1:30:36] he says there it is if it isn't in the
[1:30:38] word you can't have it
[1:30:42] you can't have it from god
[1:30:44] amen but the scripture talks to us that
[1:30:46] what we ask and miss and what we receive
[1:30:48] what we've asked for and it isn't god
[1:30:50] that's giving it to you it's satan
[1:30:51] that's giving it to you because you
[1:30:53] haven't gone with the word you've gone
[1:30:54] with your own desires you've gone with
[1:30:56] your own thoughts and what you've done
[1:30:57] is you've actually anointed satan to
[1:30:59] work in your life now because you're not
[1:31:01] speaking according to the word of god
[1:31:03] satan is more than happy to give you
[1:31:05] anything you want from his kingdom and
[1:31:06] if you if you speak it you'll get it and
[1:31:08] you'll see it in all of these you know
[1:31:10] uh the the prosperity gospel people and
[1:31:12] everything satan's more than happy to
[1:31:14] give you all the money in the world if
[1:31:15] he can keep you from from expressing the
[1:31:17] word of god right he'll give you wealth
[1:31:19] he'll give you fame he'll give you a
[1:31:20] fortune he'll give you influence he'll
[1:31:22] give you all of these things and it has
[1:31:23] nothing to do with god all it is is
[1:31:25] you're worshiping satan in the in the
[1:31:26] temple of god and you don't realize it
[1:31:28] you've opened it up because you don't go
[1:31:30] according to the word you've gone
[1:31:31] according to your own flesh
[1:31:33] he says here so we can't ask unless it's
[1:31:36] in the word and we can't petition or ask
[1:31:38] unless it is in his name there it is
[1:31:40] jesus the name is the word the will you
[1:31:44] can't separate god in the word they are
[1:31:46] one
[1:31:47] listen if my wife goes to the bank and
[1:31:49] says give me all the money in the
[1:31:51] accounts
[1:31:52] what are they going to say
[1:31:54] do you want it in 50s or 100s
[1:31:57] they're not going to say no
[1:31:59] who are you
[1:32:00] what right do you have to this why
[1:32:02] because she is mrs jonathan corlett and
[1:32:05] she has a card that identifies it and
[1:32:07] she has an access pin that gives her a
[1:32:09] right to empty those bank accounts any
[1:32:11] time she wants she has full authority to
[1:32:14] use the money in our bank accounts
[1:32:15] anytime she wants including withdrawing
[1:32:18] every single penny of it amen why she
[1:32:20] speaks in my name i have added her as a
[1:32:23] joint account holder on all of my
[1:32:25] accounts and so when she comes in there
[1:32:27] and she wants something from them they
[1:32:29] have to do it as if it was me speaking
[1:32:31] there
[1:32:32] amen but the word of god remember we
[1:32:33] read that quote the other day where
[1:32:34] brother brahms said if the sons of god
[1:32:37] could speak a world into existence and
[1:32:38] go live on it if there wasn't a law
[1:32:41] controlling those things why because
[1:32:43] we're not allowed to go we've got to
[1:32:44] stay here god's got a purpose and a plan
[1:32:46] for us amen so i trust my wife not to go
[1:32:48] in and empty our bank accounts and do
[1:32:49] what she wants with it but why is that
[1:32:51] because she has the mind of john right
[1:32:54] she has a vision she has a purpose she
[1:32:55] knows what she's supposed to do with it
[1:32:57] and that's what she does with it and
[1:32:58] it's no different with god what he's
[1:33:00] given us the word of god that gives us
[1:33:02] access to what every divine right that
[1:33:04] he's given us as a child of god as a
[1:33:06] bride of jesus christ and so we have the
[1:33:08] availability for that but we have to go
[1:33:10] in and our access point is what a pin
[1:33:13] which is the word
[1:33:14] right the word is the pin that we enter
[1:33:16] every time we don't just go in and claim
[1:33:18] all of these different things but we go
[1:33:19] in with the word and that unlocks the
[1:33:21] promise in our life for every one of us
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:24] so what paul is warning us is he's
[1:33:26] saying look you've got gifts and you're
[1:33:27] supposed to be edifying to the body and
[1:33:29] your words are going to have authority
[1:33:30] and power if you're a child of god so be
[1:33:32] careful of what you say here brother
[1:33:35] braham says this he says
[1:33:37] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[1:33:40] when god and man comes together two
[1:33:42] omnipotents something's got to shake now
[1:33:44] an omnipotent is anything something
[1:33:47] that's able to do anything
[1:33:49] now i understand omnipotent when we
[1:33:50] speak of god but he says two omnipotents
[1:33:52] and then he says man when god and man
[1:33:54] meet something has got to shake and
[1:33:57] where's he coming from he's taking us
[1:33:59] back to genesis 1 where it says what
[1:34:01] that dominion was given us to rule over
[1:34:04] the earth
[1:34:05] right and so he's saying he's what when
[1:34:06] you step back into that position that
[1:34:08] restored position that eating condition
[1:34:10] now you're omnipotent on this earth you
[1:34:13] have the power
[1:34:15] by the word to do whatever needs to
[1:34:17] happen in the situation amen
[1:34:20] he says something's got to shake
[1:34:22] whatsoever you'd say with that creative
[1:34:25] power of the omnipotence of god knowing
[1:34:27] that he's promised it and he said it in
[1:34:29] his word catch that he's promised it and
[1:34:32] he said it in his word you didn't make
[1:34:34] it up it creates a power that goes out
[1:34:37] yonder and brings things to pass
[1:34:40] things that is not
[1:34:43] not just brings things into subjection
[1:34:45] but it will literally go out and create
[1:34:47] what you need for the situation it'll go
[1:34:50] out and create the solution to what you
[1:34:52] have going on in your life it'll what
[1:34:54] take out of nothing and bring the
[1:34:56] something that's going to make all the
[1:34:57] difference in your life amen
[1:34:59] he says it creates a power that goes out
[1:35:02] yonder and brings things to pass things
[1:35:04] that it is not it makes them as though
[1:35:06] they are because two omnipotents have
[1:35:08] met he says there he stands isn't he
[1:35:10] wonderful two omnipotents met but we are
[1:35:13] a part of him he is not a part of us and
[1:35:15] if i can put it that way what all the
[1:35:16] glory all the praise all of all of the
[1:35:19] deserving goes to him amen we don't lift
[1:35:21] up ourselves but we give it to him
[1:35:23] amen but watch it when we get under
[1:35:25] another influence amen if we get out
[1:35:27] from under the influence of the word if
[1:35:28] we start to selectively pick and choose
[1:35:30] the word because that says satanic is
[1:35:32] not not sticking with it at all is when
[1:35:34] you pick and choose to suit your idea
[1:35:36] and suit your life and suit what you
[1:35:38] want to happen that's when the demons
[1:35:39] get in amen it's that so that's what
[1:35:41] satan did in the first thing he just got
[1:35:43] her off of one word didn't he he got her
[1:35:45] off the one word that made all the
[1:35:46] difference and it brought us into this
[1:35:48] place of destruction that we're in
[1:35:50] why because as much as faith is created
[1:35:52] doubt and fear are destructive
[1:35:54] amen so the minute you start to speak
[1:35:56] negatively then what happens is you
[1:35:58] allow satan in to do what start tearing
[1:36:00] down what god has spent so much time
[1:36:02] building up amen what you say is what
[1:36:04] will be
[1:36:06] what you say is what will be but
[1:36:07] remember you've got two powers waiting
[1:36:09] there and you're either anointing one to
[1:36:10] go or you're anointing the other one to
[1:36:12] go and so that's why he says when two
[1:36:14] omnipotents meet if you said if he said
[1:36:17] it in his word and he promised it in his
[1:36:19] word that's what you want to speak don't
[1:36:20] make up things on your own and don't
[1:36:22] speak into the situation in a way that
[1:36:24] the word doesn't give you authority to
[1:36:25] do it amen
[1:36:27] amen if what you're saying is that your
[1:36:29] brother or sister is going to keep
[1:36:30] failing where they're failing guess what
[1:36:32] that brother sister is going to keep
[1:36:33] failing if only in your eyes amen if
[1:36:35] your spouse is a disappointment and all
[1:36:37] you can do is dwell on the
[1:36:38] disappointment of your spouse guess what
[1:36:40] in your eyes they will continue to
[1:36:41] disappoint and sometimes what god's
[1:36:43] waiting on is your attitude to shift and
[1:36:45] your prayer to shift to where instead of
[1:36:47] speaking the way you are you start to
[1:36:48] speak what the word says that they are
[1:36:50] supposed to be and it opens up access
[1:36:52] now to what get your attitude out of the
[1:36:54] way so that god can move completely on
[1:36:56] their their end of things amen sometimes
[1:36:58] it's our attitude that's blocking
[1:36:59] somebody else from getting the very
[1:37:01] thing that we need amen
[1:37:03] job three says for the thing which i
[1:37:05] greatly feared has come upon me and that
[1:37:07] which i was afraid of is come unto me i
[1:37:10] was not in safety neither had i rest
[1:37:12] neither was i quiet yet trouble came
[1:37:16] what the thing that he was dwelling on
[1:37:17] came to pass
[1:37:19] why because what did you do you opened
[1:37:21] up a door hey man we dwell on calamity
[1:37:23] we dwell on problems we see something
[1:37:25] coming down the road and we say oh boy
[1:37:26] this is going to be bad this is not
[1:37:29] going to be good we're going to have a
[1:37:30] big situation oh my goodness and what
[1:37:33] are we doing we're opening the door to
[1:37:34] satan and his demons and we're saying
[1:37:35] come on in boys here's the door to my
[1:37:38] rest here's the door to my piece here's
[1:37:40] the door to my joy here's the joy here's
[1:37:42] a door to my victory go in there and
[1:37:44] destroy whatever you think you can
[1:37:46] destroy today because i'm going to sit
[1:37:48] here and worry about what's going to
[1:37:49] happen down the road all we're doing is
[1:37:51] giving satan an open door when we start
[1:37:53] confessing what it's going to be rather
[1:37:55] than looking to the word and saying
[1:37:56] victory is mine amen victory is mine joy
[1:37:59] is mine love is mine is that song we
[1:38:00] sing so often is amen what is it when we
[1:38:03] look at the situation then what happens
[1:38:05] is we're opening the door for satan to
[1:38:06] keep working in that situation remember
[1:38:08] when we look to the word and we say lord
[1:38:10] we're trusting you now then all of a
[1:38:12] sudden the holy spirit is what released
[1:38:14] to do exactly what the word says is
[1:38:16] going to happen amen so watch who you're
[1:38:18] listening to
[1:38:20] right watch what you're feeding on
[1:38:21] because that's going to determine how
[1:38:22] you respond your absolute is what you're
[1:38:25] feeding on day by day so if you're in an
[1:38:27] unvindicated source then get out of it
[1:38:29] because an unvindicated source is going
[1:38:30] to have unvindicated results amen you've
[1:38:33] only got to sit under the word to get
[1:38:35] word results you don't have to add
[1:38:36] anything and you definitely can't take
[1:38:38] anything away from it amen
[1:38:40] the world doesn't have answers for us if
[1:38:42] i can put it that way if you want world
[1:38:44] results do things the world way
[1:38:47] amen if you want world results do things
[1:38:49] the world does it and you'll get world
[1:38:51] results and you the thing is you don't
[1:38:52] even have to have discernment about
[1:38:54] what's going to happen because you just
[1:38:55] look at the world and see how it's gone
[1:38:57] for them and that's what you can expect
[1:38:58] in your life and then whether it's our
[1:39:00] finances whether it's our families
[1:39:01] whether it's our relationships whether
[1:39:03] it's how we run a church it doesn't
[1:39:05] matter go look at the world and if you
[1:39:06] want to take anything from the world
[1:39:08] you'll get world results every time but
[1:39:10] if you can go to the word and do the
[1:39:12] harder work because the world is all
[1:39:14] about quick and easy and mental this and
[1:39:17] and this and that and the other thing
[1:39:19] the word is the longing it's a long game
[1:39:21] it's not immediate results necessarily
[1:39:23] but if you stick with it it holds amen
[1:39:26] it'll come to its fruit in its time and
[1:39:28] season but the world is all about
[1:39:29] getting you there quickly and it never
[1:39:31] lasts
[1:39:32] amen
[1:39:34] listen brother brahm says satan never
[1:39:36] received the holy ghost he ain't got
[1:39:38] nothing then to give you faith
[1:39:41] so if you're repeating words from
[1:39:43] satan's eden it's not going to be full
[1:39:45] of faith amen amen
[1:39:47] in other words it won't be faithful to
[1:39:49] the word of god and it can only produce
[1:39:51] one thing and that's doubt which leads
[1:39:52] to destruction and death okay satan
[1:39:55] never received the holy ghost so he
[1:39:57] ain't got nothing then to give you faith
[1:39:58] it's god that's got the faith and just
[1:40:01] as if you're filled with god you're
[1:40:03] filled with faith if you're the son of
[1:40:05] god you're like god he just speaks the
[1:40:07] word and it creates itself
[1:40:11] amen like i said if we can take on that
[1:40:13] mind of christ who thought it not
[1:40:14] robbery what being in the form of god to
[1:40:16] be equal with god
[1:40:18] right that's the mind of christ is to
[1:40:19] say lord you have put me into this
[1:40:21] position and so i'm going to speak in
[1:40:24] that position right i'm going to say you
[1:40:26] put me here i didn't put myself but on
[1:40:29] the basis that you put me here now i'm
[1:40:31] going to speak into the situation we saw
[1:40:33] it with joshua amen we preached on this
[1:40:35] many months ago where what he's standing
[1:40:37] there and he's got a work to do and the
[1:40:39] enemy's getting away and they've had a
[1:40:41] great victory but it's not a final
[1:40:42] victory and he says moon stay here son
[1:40:45] stay here why because he's in the line
[1:40:46] of duty he's doing what god asked him to
[1:40:49] do and so he pulls all that he needs
[1:40:51] from god and god obeys it right then and
[1:40:54] there it'll never happen again in that
[1:40:55] way the scripture says but for one day
[1:40:57] god gave him exactly what he needed to
[1:40:59] finish the job and he finished the job
[1:41:01] why and god said and it was so and
[1:41:03] anything you needed in the middle of
[1:41:05] that he give you amen anything you need
[1:41:07] according to the word he'll give it to
[1:41:09] you to resolve the situations that are
[1:41:11] in your life amen
[1:41:13] verse 28 and ephesians 4 says and grieve
[1:41:16] not the holy spirit of god whereby you
[1:41:19] are sealed into the day of redemption i
[1:41:20] love this here where paul says don't
[1:41:22] grieve it but you can't get rid of it
[1:41:24] right you're sealed to the day of your
[1:41:26] redemption but he says don't grieve it
[1:41:27] don't let something get between you and
[1:41:29] that holy spirit to the point that satan
[1:41:31] has a an opening in your armor that
[1:41:32] there's a there that's opened up
[1:41:34] because you grieved him out of your life
[1:41:36] what you didn't lose your salvation but
[1:41:38] what you lost was what the effect of
[1:41:40] that holy spirit that's moving in your
[1:41:42] life and how do you grieve it what do
[1:41:43] you do is you deny the word of god and
[1:41:45] that is reflected in your words and your
[1:41:47] actions right and when you put something
[1:41:49] else ahead of the word of god now the
[1:41:50] holy spirit has nothing to work on and
[1:41:52] all of a sudden satan's got the opening
[1:41:54] that he needs
[1:41:55] so the question then is whose thought
[1:41:57] are you speaking
[1:41:58] who's thought are we speaking in our
[1:42:00] conversations
[1:42:01] whose thought are we speaking even in
[1:42:03] our thoughts if i can put it that way
[1:42:04] because guess what they'll drop a
[1:42:06] thought in and sometimes it's the holy
[1:42:07] spirit and you want to do what meditate
[1:42:09] on it that means think on it dwell on it
[1:42:12] but don't let it be a thought from satan
[1:42:13] because if you dwell on it and meditate
[1:42:15] on it it's going to bear a fruit as well
[1:42:16] and it'll be destructive in your life
[1:42:18] amen
[1:42:19] what you've got to be careful that what
[1:42:22] you say doesn't grieve the holy spirit
[1:42:24] out of your life and it doesn't have an
[1:42:26] effect on those that are around you it's
[1:42:27] supposed to be edifying amen he says let
[1:42:30] all bitterness and wrath and anger and
[1:42:32] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:42:34] from you with all malice now the
[1:42:36] amplified says lit all bitterness and
[1:42:38] indignation indignation's a big one can
[1:42:41] you believe what they said to me can you
[1:42:43] believe what they did to me do you
[1:42:44] believe the gall that they had
[1:42:48] wrath passion rage bad temper and
[1:42:51] resentment anger animosity and
[1:42:53] quarreling brawling clamor contention
[1:42:56] and slander evil speaking abusive or
[1:42:59] blasphemous language be banished from
[1:43:02] you and with all malice and spite ill
[1:43:05] will or baseness of any kind
[1:43:08] we can speak the truth without
[1:43:09] bitterness we've all got a reason to be
[1:43:12] bitter if we want to choose a reason you
[1:43:14] know we've all been wronged
[1:43:16] we've all literally done things where we
[1:43:18] did nothing and somebody just absolutely
[1:43:19] came in and destroyed us in some way and
[1:43:22] we have a right to be bitter what we got
[1:43:24] something we didn't deserve and that's
[1:43:25] usually what bitterness is surrounded by
[1:43:27] amen but we should be able to speak of a
[1:43:29] difficult situation without being
[1:43:30] slanderous towards the other person amen
[1:43:33] i've said it before we ought to be able
[1:43:34] to speak the truth without taking
[1:43:36] somebody's christianity away from them
[1:43:37] and then we ought to be able to go into
[1:43:39] a situation amen as christ did in his
[1:43:41] dying breath said father forgive them
[1:43:43] for they know not what they do
[1:43:45] if he can do that based on what he had
[1:43:47] just went through
[1:43:48] right his body was completely wrecked
[1:43:51] and he's sitting up there as the last
[1:43:52] drops of blood drain out from his body
[1:43:54] and says father forgive them for they
[1:43:56] know not what they do why are we talking
[1:43:58] the way we talk sometimes
[1:44:00] what did have we suffered as badly as
[1:44:02] christ that we would somehow not have to
[1:44:04] have the attitude that he had did we get
[1:44:07] so far beaten up did we get so far
[1:44:09] destroyed did our character get so
[1:44:11] besmirched by what somebody said that we
[1:44:13] can't say father forgive them the way he
[1:44:15] did
[1:44:16] right paul said you've not been you
[1:44:17] haven't been
[1:44:18] you know you haven't even been killed
[1:44:20] you haven't been killed with what they
[1:44:22] did so what are you talking about guess
[1:44:24] what christ was killed he was killed
[1:44:26] that's how bad it was for him we don't
[1:44:28] get killed we just get our feelings hurt
[1:44:30] and we treat it as if we're getting
[1:44:31] killed
[1:44:32] what is it you to let what the words
[1:44:34] that come out in those situations be
[1:44:36] what to the edifying of the hearer and
[1:44:37] not to destroy them even further amen
[1:44:41] because why what happens is we go from
[1:44:42] stating the facts if we let satan's get
[1:44:45] in there then we go from facts to what
[1:44:47] assigning intent to the person when
[1:44:50] sometimes there was nothing there and
[1:44:52] how many times do you have a situation
[1:44:53] with someone where you go in the
[1:44:55] situation happens and you come out of
[1:44:57] that and you say they did that because
[1:44:59] of this this and this and then you come
[1:45:01] around and you finally make it make up
[1:45:03] and you you say i'm sorry and hey
[1:45:05] sometimes it's with your spouse let's
[1:45:07] make it easy sometimes with your spells
[1:45:08] you have a fight with your spouse and
[1:45:09] you're back in your room and you're
[1:45:10] stewing and she said this because
[1:45:13] and you go back and you talk to her and
[1:45:16] and you apologize you say honey you know
[1:45:17] i'm sorry i shouldn't have snapped at
[1:45:18] you and she says i'm so sorry and then
[1:45:20] she says i just had this on my mind and
[1:45:22] when you said that it it caused me to
[1:45:24] react that way and you're sitting there
[1:45:25] and you've assigned 43 different demons
[1:45:27] to your wife because she spoke to you
[1:45:29] the wrong way and all she had was one
[1:45:30] little thing and you triggered it right
[1:45:33] what and you've just completely
[1:45:34] destroyed your wife's christianity while
[1:45:36] you're in your room stewing and it had
[1:45:38] nothing to do with anything with you you
[1:45:40] just stepped on a land mine that you
[1:45:41] didn't know existed
[1:45:43] right and it's not your fault and it's
[1:45:44] not her fault it was just there right
[1:45:47] what we need to be careful how we
[1:45:48] respond and not to assign intent to
[1:45:50] somebody's mistakes sometimes we're
[1:45:52] ignorant because we're ignorant
[1:45:54] you don't know what you don't know
[1:45:56] right you can't be bigger than you are
[1:45:58] you can't say you know the scripture
[1:46:00] says what man by taking thought of it
[1:46:01] can add a cubit to a stature you can't
[1:46:03] grow a foot by thinking about it right
[1:46:05] you got to have an experience to back up
[1:46:07] what you're talking about and sometimes
[1:46:08] what happens is people hurt you because
[1:46:10] they're speaking without experience
[1:46:12] right and you've got to give grace to
[1:46:13] that person to grow and you back away
[1:46:16] and what you do you go into your prayer
[1:46:17] closet brother bram says you go in and
[1:46:18] pray until god gives you an
[1:46:20] understanding of why they did it and
[1:46:21] then you can come out and you can pray
[1:46:22] for them because you see an issue there
[1:46:24] that needs to be resolved rather than
[1:46:26] the oh they did this to me it's like oh
[1:46:28] satan's got a foothold there there's
[1:46:29] some growth that needs to happen and now
[1:46:30] you can take them to the throne of god
[1:46:32] in prayer rather than sit there and say
[1:46:34] god smite them
[1:46:36] amen
[1:46:39] has anybody ever prayed the god smite
[1:46:40] them prayer
[1:46:42] no
[1:46:43] okay
[1:46:45] not after this service
[1:46:49] sorry
[1:46:51] 32. i missed it i didn't put in my notes
[1:46:53] i'm sorry it says and be kind one to
[1:46:55] another
[1:46:57] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:46:59] as god for christ's sake hath forgiven
[1:47:02] you
[1:47:03] amen can you say your words are dosed
[1:47:05] with these things rather than poison and
[1:47:07] malice can you say that it's
[1:47:08] tenderhearted and forgiving one to
[1:47:10] another
[1:47:12] god help us amen
[1:47:14] why he says it why
[1:47:16] why do we do that he says why do you
[1:47:18] have to do it he says why because even
[1:47:20] as god for christ's sake have forgiven
[1:47:22] you what freely you have received freely
[1:47:25] give amen let it be a reflection of his
[1:47:27] grace to you that the words you say are
[1:47:30] the same as the ones he would say and
[1:47:31] has said and has said to each and every
[1:47:34] one of us time and time and time again
[1:47:36] amen his mercies are new every morning
[1:47:39] right he doesn't hold us again hold it
[1:47:40] against us he doesn't come up and wake
[1:47:42] us up with thunder and lightning every
[1:47:43] morning you know
[1:47:45] based on what we've done or what we
[1:47:46] didn't do what is it his mercies are new
[1:47:48] every morning it should be the same for
[1:47:49] us one to the other
[1:47:51] brother brown says and i've noticed that
[1:47:52] a lot of times i'd say things that i
[1:47:54] couldn't hardly think myself but i'd say
[1:47:57] it anyhow he's speaking about the
[1:47:59] supernatural now
[1:48:00] and i come to find out it did happen
[1:48:02] just that way i'd say things i didn't
[1:48:05] hardly didn't mean for it to happen that
[1:48:07] way but it did anyhow because i had said
[1:48:10] it
[1:48:11] catch that he says i didn't even hardly
[1:48:13] mean it that way what it was was he had
[1:48:16] something inside of him that was wanting
[1:48:17] to come out and until he spoke it he
[1:48:20] didn't even realize what it was that was
[1:48:21] lurking in there to come out but what
[1:48:23] was it it was the word of god sitting
[1:48:25] there he says but i did anyhow because i
[1:48:27] said it and i thought wait a minute
[1:48:30] so i said you see when we speak anything
[1:48:33] if something is anchored to us we
[1:48:35] shouldn't never speak it till we believe
[1:48:37] it
[1:48:38] then when we believe it we speak it and
[1:48:41] that creative word goes out
[1:48:43] it's a part of god see and it created
[1:48:47] brother branson branham's pointing us
[1:48:49] back to the original creative work of
[1:48:50] god and he says look you've got the same
[1:48:53] thing because you're the word and you're
[1:48:54] believing the word and that leads to
[1:48:56] speaking the word and therefore as god
[1:48:58] spoke the word that came to pass so you
[1:49:00] should speak and expect it to pass
[1:49:03] amen brother gerald read this the last
[1:49:05] service i have my notes completely done
[1:49:07] and i went back and i added this in
[1:49:08] because it was a tremendous scripture
[1:49:10] this was in second corinthians it says
[1:49:12] we having what
[1:49:14] the same spirit of
[1:49:17] faith
[1:49:19] according as it is written i believed
[1:49:22] and therefore have i spoken he's
[1:49:24] pointing back to genesis amen
[1:49:27] what what was it god believed his word
[1:49:29] and he spoke it it says we also believe
[1:49:33] and therefore speak
[1:49:35] what the spirit that drives our
[1:49:37] confession is what one of faith faith in
[1:49:39] what the word of god faith in the word
[1:49:41] of god will what bring it to pass every
[1:49:43] time amen but faith is what drives us to
[1:49:45] speak it is not doubt it is not fear it
[1:49:48] is not disappointment what is it faith
[1:49:51] faith faith
[1:49:52] what i believe and therefore i speak
[1:49:55] amen amen the same life the same word
[1:49:58] the same situation the same results will
[1:50:00] follow it what out of nothing comes
[1:50:02] something
[1:50:03] that's what the word does out of nothing
[1:50:05] comes something out of a completely
[1:50:08] hopeless situation comes what life
[1:50:12] resolution
[1:50:13] appreciation acceptance
[1:50:16] right when you think it can look look at
[1:50:18] brother ed cater brother ed sorry to
[1:50:20] pick on you
[1:50:21] 72 years old and you come back to the
[1:50:23] lord is anything too hard for the lord
[1:50:26] right what
[1:50:28] i told brother gerald after that i said
[1:50:30] what a what a
[1:50:31] faith it ought to give to those of us
[1:50:33] that are looking to people that are
[1:50:34] serving anything other than the lord
[1:50:36] these days and then if he can bring
[1:50:37] someone back at 72 he can bring him back
[1:50:39] at 32 42 52 62 72 all the way at least
[1:50:43] up to 95.
[1:50:44] after 96 there's no hope
[1:50:48] amen
[1:50:50] what is it the spirit of faith the holy
[1:50:51] spirit moving to perform
[1:50:53] that which was spoken
[1:50:55] so when we speak
[1:50:57] what are we speaking
[1:50:59] what do we speak about our spouses
[1:51:01] and then do we build them up
[1:51:03] listen you have to have hard
[1:51:04] conversations with your spouses
[1:51:06] sometimes but if you're constantly
[1:51:08] tearing them down
[1:51:09] either to them or to others guess what
[1:51:12] they'll always be down in your eyes
[1:51:14] it doesn't matter if they grow in the
[1:51:16] lord you're still not going to see it
[1:51:17] because you're speaking what a negative
[1:51:19] thought into your mind and that gives
[1:51:21] satan the the right
[1:51:23] the right to operate and keep that in
[1:51:25] front of you and blind your eyes to what
[1:51:26] god's actually doing in that person's
[1:51:27] life amen when we speak to our children
[1:51:29] how do we speak is it constantly what
[1:51:32] correction because we're supposed to
[1:51:34] correct but are we correcting with them
[1:51:35] with with an intent of what building up
[1:51:38] and then with growing them and
[1:51:39] confirming to them that they're doing
[1:51:41] well in these different things and then
[1:51:42] if all we if all that comes out is
[1:51:44] correction correction correction and
[1:51:45] there's no love with that correction
[1:51:47] then what are we going to do we're going
[1:51:48] to destroy them amen
[1:51:51] when we look at our jobs when we look at
[1:51:52] our finances when we look at our health
[1:51:54] what does our conversation look like
[1:51:56] is it negative meaning not according to
[1:51:58] the word of god or is it positive
[1:52:00] meaning that it is what based on the
[1:52:02] promises of god rather than the symptoms
[1:52:04] of the situation amen when we look at
[1:52:05] brothers and sisters in this church
[1:52:07] listen we've all got flesh attached to
[1:52:09] us amen and i can sit here and brother
[1:52:11] josh can focus on all the flesh that's
[1:52:12] on me all day long and guess what he'll
[1:52:14] never get a thing out of my preaching if
[1:52:15] he's focused on that but he doesn't do
[1:52:17] that why because he's got in him that's
[1:52:19] looking to the god of me and he's
[1:52:20] focused on that and that's what we've
[1:52:22] got to do with each and every one of us
[1:52:23] is we've got to pray for the parts that
[1:52:25] aren't of god and we've got to what look
[1:52:27] to it connect the things that are of god
[1:52:29] in that person he meant because each one
[1:52:31] of us only has a part of god and each
[1:52:33] one of us only has a portion in this
[1:52:34] body nobody is all things to all men
[1:52:37] right paul paul said i try to be all
[1:52:39] things dull men but we can't do that and
[1:52:41] then we got to be what we are we've got
[1:52:43] to try and attach in the way that we do
[1:52:44] and if i expect a brother or sister to
[1:52:46] be something that they're not i'm going
[1:52:47] to be severely disappointed but if i can
[1:52:49] look to the god that is within them to
[1:52:51] the portion the expression the attribute
[1:52:53] of god that's in them now all of a
[1:52:54] sudden we've got something to fellowship
[1:52:56] on don't we
[1:52:57] amen
[1:52:58] if we're writing people off if we're
[1:52:59] writing situations off then it means
[1:53:01] that we're not looking at the word we're
[1:53:02] not looking at the god that changed us
[1:53:04] and that can change them in the exact
[1:53:06] same way amen
[1:53:07] amen god help us to speak by what
[1:53:09] inspiration of the holy spirit rather
[1:53:11] than the unholy spirit if i could put it
[1:53:12] that way amen
[1:53:14] but we talked initially there
[1:53:16] about that that creation process and god
[1:53:18] speaking and the holy spirit was sitting
[1:53:20] there and it was just resting on the
[1:53:22] earth and it was just moving over there
[1:53:23] but nothing was happening but as soon as
[1:53:25] god spoke that holy spirit moved and we
[1:53:27] saw that it was not creative initially
[1:53:29] aside from that light amen it was not
[1:53:31] created but rather it was moving to
[1:53:32] cause separation it was what a refining
[1:53:34] process of what was already there it was
[1:53:36] this holy spirit moving to draw out the
[1:53:39] things that were already in existence
[1:53:40] but to put them in their place and put
[1:53:42] them in their position and set them up
[1:53:44] to support life amen and that's the very
[1:53:46] same way that we were we were born
[1:53:48] chaotic we were born out of alignment
[1:53:50] with the word of god we were born
[1:53:51] unconnected to the word and then what
[1:53:53] happened was god released the holy
[1:53:55] spirit to do what move over us and draw
[1:53:58] us out and separate us and then after
[1:54:00] separation what comes out is the life
[1:54:02] that's within us amen and what's he
[1:54:04] doing is he's pulling out the portion of
[1:54:06] him that he had planted in the beginning
[1:54:08] amen he's drawing out an original word
[1:54:10] that was there from before the
[1:54:11] foundation of the world and then he's
[1:54:13] drawing it back from eternity and he's
[1:54:15] taking those things and he's pulling it
[1:54:17] and bringing it into life now and he's
[1:54:18] saying now is your time and now is your
[1:54:21] season and then we had a time and a
[1:54:22] season it was in the the seventh church
[1:54:24] age other people were born the first
[1:54:26] second third why that was their place
[1:54:28] and their time to do it but the holy
[1:54:29] spirit moving on us now has brought us
[1:54:31] to life we are not here by chance we
[1:54:33] were not born by chance we're not born
[1:54:35] in the families we were born by chance
[1:54:37] amen but it was god orchestrating it to
[1:54:39] bring us out in the land that we needed
[1:54:40] to be born in and the place where you
[1:54:42] need to be born in and the situations we
[1:54:43] needed to be born in to what caused the
[1:54:46] life that was within us to come forth
[1:54:47] amen and with those things come gifts
[1:54:50] and then you you know we talked about
[1:54:52] the apple seed did not magically become
[1:54:54] a pear tree when it grew up no an apple
[1:54:56] seed grew into an apple tree and bore
[1:54:58] apples and so within us we have the same
[1:55:00] thing we have the word within us and we
[1:55:02] have a portion and an attribute of god
[1:55:04] and that's a gift inside of us and that
[1:55:05] gift has to be expressed and it's a
[1:55:07] creation gift it's something that we
[1:55:09] have whether or not we ever realize it
[1:55:11] whether or not
[1:55:12] we're serving the lord right now or not
[1:55:14] serving the lord that gift is always
[1:55:16] there but if we can submit it to him now
[1:55:18] it becomes a spiritual gift amen but
[1:55:20] it's a creation gift you have it no
[1:55:22] matter what
[1:55:23] and brother brown says this now here's
[1:55:25] the last quotation video he says listen
[1:55:26] friends listen all look this way you
[1:55:28] have those gifts you didn't deserve them
[1:55:31] god gave them to you before the
[1:55:32] foundation of the world they are yours
[1:55:36] when you was born in this world you were
[1:55:37] born with them
[1:55:38] he quotes the scripture to timothy he
[1:55:40] says stir up that gift that is within
[1:55:41] you see you're born with these things
[1:55:43] you can't make yourself do some things i
[1:55:45] couldn't make my eyes brown because
[1:55:47] they're blue who taking thought can add
[1:55:48] one cubit to his stature it's all in
[1:55:51] god's divine program if i tried to be a
[1:55:53] sankey or a finney what good would it do
[1:55:55] me see god had a sankey and a finney i'm
[1:55:57] william branham you're whoever you are
[1:56:00] she says don't try and mimic somebody
[1:56:02] else don't try and be somebody else
[1:56:03] don't try and have their gift or say
[1:56:05] that's what i want to be he says no it
[1:56:07] doesn't matter he says i would like to
[1:56:08] be like finney or sankey maybe but god
[1:56:10] already made them so he doesn't need me
[1:56:13] to be them because he's got them so he
[1:56:15] said i'm going to be me and you be you
[1:56:17] and let god work in you the way that
[1:56:19] he's created you to be amen
[1:56:21] elvis never got the holy ghost and so
[1:56:22] his singing though it was a creation
[1:56:24] gift never had a spiritual effect
[1:56:26] because why he never surrendered it to
[1:56:28] god amen it doesn't matter you know with
[1:56:31] elvis it's it doesn't mean that he
[1:56:33] missed his calling but rather he missed
[1:56:35] an opportunity when you look at elvis
[1:56:37] life you see this man was not a child of
[1:56:38] god
[1:56:40] he wasn't a child of god his choices
[1:56:42] reflect that clearly he never got the
[1:56:43] holy ghost right every child of god's
[1:56:45] got to have the holy ghost before they
[1:56:47] go amen
[1:56:48] we believe that in terms of a member of
[1:56:49] the bride of christ if we could do that
[1:56:51] his choices showed a clear deviation
[1:56:52] from the word so what he missed though
[1:56:54] was an opportunity because remember
[1:56:56] salvation is to whosoever will right and
[1:56:59] if he surrendered his gift and he could
[1:57:01] dedicate his life to christ then what
[1:57:03] he'd have an opportunity at salvation
[1:57:05] even if he never got the holy ghost but
[1:57:06] he chose not to even do that and so i
[1:57:08] have no doubt and brother ram says he he
[1:57:10] knows where elvis is today and he's in
[1:57:12] the flames of hell
[1:57:13] right if we want to put it that way he's
[1:57:15] in isolation right he's he's in
[1:57:16] nothingness as we know these different
[1:57:18] things but what happens is he had a gift
[1:57:20] he had a creation gift inside of him and
[1:57:22] those that was his regardless of whether
[1:57:24] he gave it to god
[1:57:25] he has it in his life and each one of us
[1:57:26] has a gift inside of us at least one
[1:57:28] gift inside of us that can be used for
[1:57:30] god
[1:57:31] in this world amen
[1:57:33] so elvis was potentially an asset and he
[1:57:36] never gave it over he did a few gospel
[1:57:37] songs of course but his life's work was
[1:57:39] not to do what god wanted him to do or
[1:57:41] what god could have used him for rather
[1:57:43] he gave it over to himself and he died
[1:57:45] overweight drugged out on a toilet
[1:57:48] you know what an end
[1:57:49] what an end you see you know if god
[1:57:52] never comes out of your life if i can
[1:57:53] put it this way god never comes out of
[1:57:55] your life god was never in your life
[1:57:57] that's what we're talking about we're
[1:57:58] talking about a seed amen you can't
[1:58:00] change what you are
[1:58:01] amen but what he's done is he's given
[1:58:04] the opportunity to people to do what
[1:58:06] surrender amen surrender as best they
[1:58:09] can they were never a child of god but
[1:58:10] he says that you get the opportunity for
[1:58:12] eternal life and it's through service
[1:58:13] and through dedication that's the only
[1:58:15] thing that's going to get you there
[1:58:16] amen brother bram says this i saw
[1:58:18] visions for 40-something years and never
[1:58:20] has it failed i saw visions when i was a
[1:58:23] sinner why it was a gift the first
[1:58:25] vision i ever remember my mama told of
[1:58:27] me speaking it to her when i wasn't
[1:58:28] quite two years old why gifts and
[1:58:30] callings are without repentance you're
[1:58:32] born that way the traits in you just
[1:58:34] like you're born with blue eyes or black
[1:58:36] eyes or brown eyes or whatever it's
[1:58:37] something god has done and that's the
[1:58:39] only way it can correctly be it has to
[1:58:41] come from god
[1:58:43] not something you made
[1:58:45] it's what god has ordained to be then
[1:58:48] it's of god if you're just bluffing to
[1:58:50] make it up your hand it'll be wrong see
[1:58:54] amen just as the earth brought forth
[1:58:55] seeds and each seed brought forth of its
[1:58:57] kind so does god within our lives amen
[1:58:59] our life has to bring out what god has
[1:59:01] placed within us john 6 39 says and this
[1:59:04] is the father's will which has sent me
[1:59:06] that of all which he had given me i
[1:59:09] should lose nothing but should raise it
[1:59:11] up again in the last day now we look at
[1:59:13] that scripture and we think he's talking
[1:59:15] about souls
[1:59:16] right and he is talking about souls he's
[1:59:18] talking about people here amen but
[1:59:20] remember we're not just children of god
[1:59:22] we are attributes of god and we've got a
[1:59:24] gift and we've got an expression a
[1:59:26] manifestation of god that's unique to
[1:59:27] each and every one of us and jesus
[1:59:29] doesn't say here that i will lose nobody
[1:59:32] he says i will lose nothing no thing
[1:59:35] what he's saying every gift
[1:59:37] every attribute not just your soul he's
[1:59:39] not going to lose but every expression
[1:59:41] of him is going to be manifested on this
[1:59:43] earth before we go in that rapture amen
[1:59:45] there is nothing that he has planted
[1:59:46] that won't come to life before he takes
[1:59:48] us off of this earth amen he won't lose
[1:59:50] a single thing that he planted because
[1:59:51] why it was the word and god said and it
[1:59:54] is so
[1:59:56] amen
[1:59:57] the principle then is that god created
[1:59:59] and then he sends his spirit to refine
[2:00:01] it's the same god and the same spirit
[2:00:03] and that spirit is refining the elements
[2:00:06] that god built into your life amen amen
[2:00:08] so what happened when malachi 4 came to
[2:00:10] restore all things
[2:00:12] because what remember
[2:00:14] something's got to be spoken
[2:00:16] before
[2:00:17] things can come out
[2:00:18] right so malachi comes and it's not just
[2:00:20] doctrines and truths and faiths but what
[2:00:22] it was opening up the seals to read to
[2:00:24] us out of the title deed i mean it was
[2:00:26] opening that word back to us and inside
[2:00:28] that title deep was every promise every
[2:00:30] attribute every manifestation of god
[2:00:32] that he had ordained for his children on
[2:00:35] this earth amen so what happens when
[2:00:36] malachi 4 comes names start getting
[2:00:39] called out gifts start getting called
[2:00:41] out ministries start getting called out
[2:00:42] people start getting placed into their
[2:00:44] positions because why the word has
[2:00:46] spoken god has spoken and it has to come
[2:00:48] to the place where it is so amen so
[2:00:51] that's what happened here is we have a
[2:00:52] restoration and because god won't show
[2:00:55] anything unless he shows it to his
[2:00:56] servants the prophets that prophet comes
[2:00:57] and he speaks to us and he says you are
[2:01:00] the bride of christ and we're like
[2:01:02] say what
[2:01:03] me i'm the bride of christ yeah you're
[2:01:05] the bride of christ and he's what he's
[2:01:07] preaching a message that draws people
[2:01:09] out of the denominations which is what
[2:01:11] he never judges the denominations in
[2:01:13] that sense he says the people in him but
[2:01:14] rather they'd gone back to what
[2:01:16] sitting under men and it was men's ideas
[2:01:18] and a headquarters and all these
[2:01:20] different things and there was no there
[2:01:21] was no freedom there was no sovereignty
[2:01:23] to the local churches and they tied
[2:01:24] themselves to a man's idea men's
[2:01:27] doctrines and they couldn't move and he
[2:01:28] had to call them out of there so that
[2:01:30] what the holy spirit could start moving
[2:01:31] again because when they got into the
[2:01:33] denominations they kicked him out of the
[2:01:34] church right when you read in revelation
[2:01:36] 3 it says yeah i stand at the door and
[2:01:38] knock he's outside he wasn't in there so
[2:01:40] he had to call them out so he could
[2:01:41] start working with them and sit down and
[2:01:42] fellowship with them amen and so he
[2:01:45] started calling those names out and when
[2:01:48] god speaks it has to be so so those
[2:01:50] people started coming out those
[2:01:52] attributes started calling out amen and
[2:01:54] they start to come out and they start to
[2:01:55] grow and all of a sudden you've got a
[2:01:56] separate bride a group that's been
[2:01:58] called out right the church is what the
[2:02:00] called out ones right they're separated
[2:02:03] they're called out and now what what god
[2:02:05] spoke to a prophet is coming to
[2:02:06] manifestation in its fullness in this
[2:02:08] age amen
[2:02:10] like i said before manifestation happens
[2:02:12] god always speaks and we had a prophet
[2:02:15] come and say that all that god was he
[2:02:16] poured into christ and that's where
[2:02:18] everybody stops if they can even get
[2:02:20] that far but he says all that christ was
[2:02:22] he poured into the church and so what
[2:02:24] you've got a manifestation of the
[2:02:26] fullness of god in a multi-member body
[2:02:28] which is the bride of jesus christ amen
[2:02:32] and then malachi 4 like i said he came
[2:02:34] and started talking to a bride that
[2:02:35] didn't even know who she was didn't even
[2:02:37] know she was a bride
[2:02:38] right didn't even know she was she was a
[2:02:40] supernatural uh embodiment of christ in
[2:02:43] this age had no idea was just what dead
[2:02:46] in doctrines and dogmas
[2:02:48] and they started speaking and out of it
[2:02:49] came what a life amen
[2:02:52] amen
[2:02:53] the thing is this
[2:02:54] my boss doesn't hold me accountable for
[2:02:56] what he thinks
[2:02:57] he holds me accountable for what he says
[2:03:00] right and if he doesn't say it then i'm
[2:03:02] not expected to bring it forth
[2:03:04] right i'm not expected to do something
[2:03:05] that he thinks i'm expected to do what
[2:03:06] he says or what he writes down and god's
[2:03:09] no different with us amen we don't have
[2:03:11] to sit here
[2:03:12] and and worry about what god's thinking
[2:03:14] but not telling us but it's what he
[2:03:15] tells us and what he has told us that we
[2:03:17] need to worry about amen and so the word
[2:03:19] is what a thought written right that's
[2:03:21] what he put down for us to read to live
[2:03:24] by to understand by these different
[2:03:25] things and that's what he's going to
[2:03:26] hold us accountable to do amen and god
[2:03:29] expects us to ask to act based on the
[2:03:32] words which is this thought expressed
[2:03:34] that says thought expressed that's what
[2:03:35] we have and that is our absolute is the
[2:03:36] word of god it is not 1200 messages from
[2:03:39] a prophet that is not our absolute he
[2:03:40] pointed us back to a restoration of the
[2:03:43] word of god amen and if he said
[2:03:45] something that i don't understand or
[2:03:47] that i can't line up with the word of
[2:03:48] god what do i do i lay it aside it may
[2:03:50] be me that's off could have been him
[2:03:52] that's off it doesn't really matter to
[2:03:53] me but until i can understand and see it
[2:03:55] through the word i leave it alone why
[2:03:56] because the word is the absolute not
[2:03:58] what the prophet said in 1200 messages
[2:04:00] amen amen so what are we asked to do
[2:04:02] we're asked to act and speak on the word
[2:04:05] of god amen act based on the holy spirit
[2:04:07] quickening that word i mean there's a
[2:04:09] quickening power that comes with the
[2:04:11] holy spirit when it moves on us and we
[2:04:13] can respond to it amen and that's great
[2:04:15] that's great when we all are in our
[2:04:16] place isn't it when we're all in our
[2:04:18] place and doing things exactly and we're
[2:04:19] not stepping on each other's toes and
[2:04:22] running around and bumping into people
[2:04:23] that are you know in a fine balancing
[2:04:25] act with what they're doing amen but
[2:04:27] what happens is we get out of place
[2:04:28] sometimes we get ahead of ourselves or
[2:04:31] we start dragging behind right and then
[2:04:33] if you're not feeding yourself at home
[2:04:35] during the week and you come into the
[2:04:36] service and you're trusting the song
[2:04:38] leader trusting the minister to come
[2:04:39] here and get you all the way up to speed
[2:04:42] right what are you doing you're holding
[2:04:43] back the church aren't you because if
[2:04:45] everybody comes in ready to go but
[2:04:47] you're not ready to go then guess what
[2:04:48] the the weakest link is you and that's
[2:04:50] what's going to break the chain you're
[2:04:52] the one that's going to get frustrated
[2:04:53] because the preacher's taking too long
[2:04:54] because the song leader didn't sing the
[2:04:55] songs you said because one of the
[2:04:56] musicians made a mistake and they ought
[2:04:58] to know better and why aren't they
[2:04:59] practicing and adapted that to death all
[2:05:00] of a sudden you've ruined the spirit in
[2:05:01] the entire service because 99 of us are
[2:05:04] where we need to be and one percent is
[2:05:05] not
[2:05:06] what you can hold back an entire service
[2:05:09] based on what you're feeding on
[2:05:10] throughout the week
[2:05:11] amen
[2:05:13] but the other thing is when we all come
[2:05:15] in and every one of us wants to be
[2:05:16] something
[2:05:17] and paul addresses us he says in first
[2:05:18] corinthians how is it then brethren
[2:05:20] remember we're talking about gifts and
[2:05:22] we're talking about being in your place
[2:05:23] and being moved by the spirit he says
[2:05:25] how is it then brethren when you come
[2:05:26] together every one of you has a psalm
[2:05:29] has a doctrine has a tongue has a
[2:05:31] revelation has an interpretation let all
[2:05:34] things be done undead defined so paul's
[2:05:35] saying them in order here and he says
[2:05:37] everyone coming into the service wanting
[2:05:39] to do something is not the holy spirit
[2:05:42] right
[2:05:43] that's people seeking attention
[2:05:45] amen verse 33 says for god is not the
[2:05:48] author of confusion but a peace as in
[2:05:51] all churches of the saints let all
[2:05:53] things be done decently and in order
[2:05:56] have you ever noticed we never have all
[2:05:58] of the sisters and brothers that sing
[2:06:00] specials come in on one service and say
[2:06:03] i've got a special
[2:06:04] because why we take up the en we'd be
[2:06:06] here an hour wouldn't we why because the
[2:06:08] holy spirit's moving on them
[2:06:10] individually at different times to bring
[2:06:12] something to the church and what it
[2:06:14] would do is by the time the minister got
[2:06:16] up we'd be tired out from singing
[2:06:18] what it's not the holy spirit moving to
[2:06:20] cause everyone that can sing to come in
[2:06:22] and sing a special in one service
[2:06:24] right so and and he said the same thing
[2:06:26] everyone has a psalm everyone has a
[2:06:27] doctrine a tongue a revelation
[2:06:28] interpretation everybody in the church
[2:06:30] was saying i've got this gift and i'm
[2:06:32] going to come into church and i'm going
[2:06:33] to share it and everybody needs to hear
[2:06:35] my gift
[2:06:36] and paul says no no no that's chaos and
[2:06:39] confusion and that he says god is not
[2:06:41] the author of that there shouldn't be a
[2:06:42] clash of gifts in the church right
[2:06:45] because you're sitting there and you're
[2:06:46] so busy and we don't have it in this
[2:06:48] church by god's grace so i'm pointing
[2:06:50] generically you're sitting there and
[2:06:52] you're saying i wish she'd shut up so i
[2:06:54] can get up and sing my song i wish that
[2:06:56] brother would stop his testimony because
[2:06:58] he's taken too long and i'm sitting here
[2:07:00] and i need to get up there and sing my
[2:07:01] song right
[2:07:03] or this or that or the other thing or
[2:07:05] maybe the preacher's saying i wish
[2:07:06] they'd stop singing so i could get out
[2:07:07] there and preach
[2:07:09] it's full circle nobody gets out from
[2:07:11] under this right what is it if you go
[2:07:13] there if we ever get to the point where
[2:07:15] we're clamoring to be the one up here in
[2:07:17] whatever form or fashion that's where
[2:07:19] the problem comes in and if you want to
[2:07:21] look at the manifestation of this
[2:07:22] scripture
[2:07:24] in our lives it is that if every time i
[2:07:26] show up to church it's so that i can
[2:07:27] publicly operate my gift it isn't the
[2:07:30] holy spirit
[2:07:31] let me put it this way
[2:07:33] don't just show up to church to operate
[2:07:35] your gift
[2:07:36] amen it has to be done to edify and
[2:07:38] guess what if somebody's singing i can't
[2:07:40] be preaching
[2:07:42] and if i'm preaching somebody can't be
[2:07:43] speaking in tongues
[2:07:44] why because it causes a conflict each
[2:07:46] has to be in their order in their time
[2:07:48] and in their season even within the body
[2:07:50] even within the service amen
[2:07:53] why because we are a body and a body
[2:07:55] that only operates one thing all the
[2:07:57] time is weak
[2:07:58] right if i went to the gym and all i did
[2:08:00] was strengthen my right arm doing bicep
[2:08:02] curls all day long what would happen i'd
[2:08:04] get this huge massive right arm and the
[2:08:06] rest of me would look like a wimp
[2:08:07] wouldn't it
[2:08:08] and that's what happens when you get
[2:08:09] into a church where you only have one or
[2:08:10] two or three people doing all the heavy
[2:08:12] lifting is you get a deformed body
[2:08:14] because you're only using those gifts in
[2:08:16] those particular areas and so you're
[2:08:18] very strong in that area and when you
[2:08:19] need somebody that's in those areas
[2:08:21] that's a great church to be but in the
[2:08:23] rest of the ways they fall down because
[2:08:24] why you're only operating a few of the
[2:08:26] gifts you're only letting a few of the
[2:08:27] people express the word in their life
[2:08:30] for the edification of the body amen now
[2:08:33] somebody would say to me or brother joe
[2:08:34] and say well you're a minister you're
[2:08:35] supposed to operate your gift every
[2:08:36] service am i
[2:08:39] scripture says there's a five-fold
[2:08:41] ministry
[2:08:42] and if we've only got two of us here we
[2:08:43] need another two or three for sure right
[2:08:45] so if i'm saying no i've got to be up
[2:08:47] here all the time brother jail can't get
[2:08:48] up here brother joe's saying brother
[2:08:50] jonathan can't get up here we never have
[2:08:51] a visiting minister or anything what is
[2:08:53] it what we're doing is we're saying i'm
[2:08:55] insisting on using my gift all the time
[2:08:57] and that's not the holy spirit amen why
[2:08:59] because he's ordained a different he's
[2:09:01] ordained a multi-member
[2:09:03] ministry to handle those situations amen
[2:09:05] so every one of these things it can't
[2:09:07] always be me me me i i i
[2:09:10] right
[2:09:11] amen
[2:09:12] usually what happens when we get into
[2:09:14] those situations is a presumption of a
[2:09:16] gift rather than a true gift or more
[2:09:18] importantly it's not yielded to the holy
[2:09:20] spirit because it's what it's
[2:09:21] self-seeking and it's self-elevating
[2:09:23] rather than to the edification of others
[2:09:25] amen
[2:09:26] and the minute we start doing that or we
[2:09:28] start focusing on just a select few we
[2:09:30] get out of balance balance is a
[2:09:31] multi-member body all actively working
[2:09:34] that's when we're all doing it you talk
[2:09:35] to anybody that likes to to strengthen
[2:09:37] themselves go to the gym and that and
[2:09:38] they say you've got to work every part
[2:09:40] of your body you know there's the joke
[2:09:41] about the guys that skipped leg days and
[2:09:43] what they have is this massive upper
[2:09:44] body and these tiny little legs
[2:09:45] underneath it's because all they focus
[2:09:47] on is their upper body they're not a
[2:09:48] balanced person
[2:09:50] their body isn't balanced amen
[2:09:53] amen we've gotta what don't try and be
[2:09:55] something you're not i think more
[2:09:56] importantly don't try and be something
[2:09:58] at all
[2:09:58] and then just relax
[2:10:00] let god move let god work in your life
[2:10:02] and then let him draw it out and then
[2:10:04] let him speak into your life let him be
[2:10:06] the one that pulls these things out that
[2:10:08] tells you all right now's the time to
[2:10:10] come to life and sometimes it's going to
[2:10:11] be something you never had an idea of in
[2:10:13] the first place sometimes gonna be
[2:10:14] something that you had no clue about
[2:10:16] like i said i would never have thought
[2:10:17] i'd be ministering behind a pulpit
[2:10:19] right would never have chosen it but yet
[2:10:21] here i stand amen i guarantee you
[2:10:23] there's plenty of people in the
[2:10:24] christian walk have ended up in places
[2:10:26] that they never thought they'd do
[2:10:28] they they'd end up because why god
[2:10:30] pulled something out of them that they
[2:10:31] didn't realize was there and sometimes
[2:10:33] he hides that gift because it's such a
[2:10:34] tremendous gift that if he were to have
[2:10:36] it out in the open the whole time satan
[2:10:38] would have too much opportunity to go in
[2:10:39] there and destroy it right he keeps it
[2:10:41] hidden then he pulls it out at that last
[2:10:42] second you kind of have this quick short
[2:10:44] work if you will where it just comes
[2:10:46] comes to life in a few quick months and
[2:10:48] all of a sudden boom that that man's out
[2:10:49] there preaching or you know that that
[2:10:51] sister starts singing and it just hits
[2:10:53] the mark at the right point in these
[2:10:54] different things amen
[2:10:57] and if you aren't sure what you're
[2:10:58] supposed to be doing
[2:11:00] help somebody that does
[2:11:01] get your shoulder to the wheel behind
[2:11:03] somebody else man if you don't know
[2:11:04] where your place is if you don't know
[2:11:05] where your gift is help somebody else do
[2:11:07] it and then make sure that their life is
[2:11:08] a little bit easier amen
[2:11:10] brother as we start to close here he
[2:11:12] says oh
[2:11:13] how that we need in this journey that
[2:11:15] we're in now to find a place of rest and
[2:11:17] to feast on the word of god so that
[2:11:20] it'll give us strength
[2:11:22] night after night go to the room and
[2:11:24] rest and come back the next morning
[2:11:25] fresh and eat more for there's a great
[2:11:28] journey and a great battle ahead for the
[2:11:30] church
[2:11:31] he says i believe we have been children
[2:11:33] long enough
[2:11:34] god's going to turn his church into
[2:11:36] manhood now and we played and frolicked
[2:11:39] as children fun and games
[2:11:42] always fun no responsibility
[2:11:45] he says no no no
[2:11:46] we played and frolicked his children but
[2:11:48] now we're going to have to put away
[2:11:50] childish things and take on manhood
[2:11:52] maturity
[2:11:54] i believe it was paul who said when i
[2:11:55] was a child i spake as a child because
[2:11:57] he thought as a child but it's time we
[2:12:00] begin to think like men and women now
[2:12:02] for we've got to get down
[2:12:05] to business amen god bless you if the
[2:12:07] musicians would come this morning
[2:12:10] amen
[2:12:12] we've been preaching on and god said
[2:12:16] i want you to think about what you've
[2:12:17] been saying in the last little while and
[2:12:19] say has god been speaking
[2:12:22] when i've been looking at situations
[2:12:23] when i've been looking at my family when
[2:12:25] i've been looking at my job when i've
[2:12:26] been looking at my health when i've been
[2:12:28] looking at the future when i've been
[2:12:30] looking at the past
[2:12:32] what is it that i've been speaking what
[2:12:33] is it that i've been thinking because
[2:12:35] what you've been thinking about what
[2:12:36] you've been dwelling on whatever you've
[2:12:38] been meditating on that's what's going
[2:12:39] to start coming out of your mouth
[2:12:40] eventually amen but i want you to think
[2:12:43] about that and say lord
[2:12:45] have you been speaking into my life
[2:12:47] or have i been letting something else
[2:12:48] speak into it and then i don't want you
[2:12:50] to look at anyone else
[2:12:52] just stop and think about that as we
[2:12:54] stand together and we're going to pray i
[2:12:55] want you to think about the words that
[2:12:57] you've been saying have they been
[2:12:59] edified
[2:13:00] have they been growing other people up
[2:13:02] into christ or have they been tearing
[2:13:04] down and then have we been destroying
[2:13:06] people's character we've been destroying
[2:13:07] our spouses have we been destroying our
[2:13:09] children have we been looking at a
[2:13:11] negative through a negative lens in the
[2:13:12] things that are going on in our life or
[2:13:14] has god been speaking and are we giving
[2:13:16] it an opportunity to be so amen because
[2:13:18] whatever you speak is what's going to be
[2:13:20] amen god's looking for a word of faith
[2:13:23] he's not looking for a word of doubt
[2:13:25] amen perfect love casts out all fear
[2:13:28] amen so if there's fear there then i
[2:13:30] guarantee you there's an influence that
[2:13:32] hasn't been the holy spirit amen and
[2:13:34] then let's just stand together if we
[2:13:35] would
[2:13:36] and then we want to let the holy spirit
[2:13:38] come in and start speaking through our
[2:13:39] lips amen and it's going to start in
[2:13:41] your mind before it ever starts in your
[2:13:43] mouth and then if i can put it that way
[2:13:45] and what's in your mind is what you're
[2:13:46] feeding on it's what you're dwelling on
[2:13:48] what you take in is what's going to come
[2:13:50] out of him and we want to feed the holy
[2:13:51] spirit inside of us let's bow our heads
[2:13:56] lord jesus
[2:13:58] lord yet another day and your word
[2:14:00] challenges us to come a little higher
[2:14:03] lord to take on that very mind of christ
[2:14:06] lord that surrenders itself first and
[2:14:08] foremost and lord and in surrendering
[2:14:10] finds itself in the position that you
[2:14:11] placed it lord in a place of authority
[2:14:14] in a place of power lord but not just to
[2:14:16] do what we would want but to do it
[2:14:18] according to your word heavenly father
[2:14:20] and lord you see each life here you see
[2:14:22] each family lord you see each person
[2:14:25] that's dealing with things in their
[2:14:26] lives lord god
[2:14:28] and lord so often what happens is we
[2:14:30] start to dwell on the negative lord as
[2:14:32] your prophet said but lord we want to
[2:14:34] dwell on what your word says we want to
[2:14:36] look to the promise lord we want to
[2:14:38] speak what you have spoken lord so that
[2:14:40] we can have the same results that it was
[2:14:43] so lord we pray that you would just
[2:14:44] touch each heart and soul here lord lord
[2:14:47] as they will reflect lord help them to
[2:14:48] reflect on themselves lord let us each
[2:14:51] be honest on where we've been speaking
[2:14:52] from in our lives lord where we've
[2:14:54] spoken in faith or may our faith just
[2:14:56] grow and continue that it will be lord
[2:14:58] and where we've spoken in doubt or fear
[2:15:00] or disappointment lord may your love
[2:15:02] just come in and wash it out lord may
[2:15:04] forgiveness rise up lord mercy and grace
[2:15:07] take its place we pray heavenly father
[2:15:09] lord touch your people we ask now in
[2:15:11] jesus christ's name
[2:15:13] amen
[2:15:14] amen
[2:15:16] it is no secret what god can do
