word tonight be in prayer a man want to share with you what the Lord has laid on my heart and trusting that it's what we need here tonight trusting is what you need tonight and I do feel that it is needed so we pray the grace of God to be with us brother so that he will anoint me to give it buddy anoint you to take it hey man so you got the father God said when the minister is preaching you know you got to be pulling on it it's all depend on its it he said if the anointing is not in the assembly he said he said we might as well not preach if the anointing is not in the congregation he said he's because you got to be praying you got to be calling for it you got to be hungry and thirsting for it and he said then God is going to move on the scene and anoint the speaker he's going to anoint the breacher a man so brother sister remember God is depending on you a man and the preacher is depending on you a man there probably would depend on the people a man their hunger and their thirst for the Word of God and God is going to respond to that hunger God is going to respond to that thirst God's going to anoint the preacher to say what he wants him to say not what the preacher wants to say but what God wants him to say a man it's you can go so far with your notes but then you got to leave the rest with God a man as God wants to bypass the notes that's fine and if God gives you the notes but that's fine we'll we'll stick with that as the Lord leads so it's not my will father time be done by the grace of God amen so we're trusted Lords go to minister to each brother and sister here and maybe somebody online maybe somebody in DVD land we don't know but God knows so we're going to leave it with the Lord so I trust by the grace of God there we're gonna have the heart to receive it we're gonna do it as we as we've been ministering on during the last service concerning I have heard but now I see it's hearing what God wants you to hear it's hearing the wake I want you to hear then you're gonna see what God wants you to see a man as their part of God I like the fact that he said you can hear it with these ears but he said you're not going to see it the way God wants you to see it no no you see it may be the way the devil wants you to see it a man he's going to interpret it he's going to show you this he's going to show you that but God wants to show you something the devil is trying to keep from you a man so let's let's have the every ear of the soul it's not these ears it's the year a man and the Bible highlights that as I've already given you some scriptures on it and we'll give you more tonight concerning let him that hath an ear not ears we all got ears but again let him better than hear hear what the Spirit is saying to the church praise the Lord so I pray God that we got we got the ear of the soul we got the ear of the Holy Ghost amen we're going to hear what God is speaking and we're going to see it I have heard but now I see but if you hear it right

with me to the book of proverbs chapter 20 proverbs chapter 20 a man be in prayer praying the leadership of the Holy Ghost to leave me to do what he wants me to do say what he wants me to say a man so the grace of God that it will be what you need well I feel it's what we need or the Lord has laid on my heart I want to share it with you and it concerns the revealed Word and brother/sister we can fit it into we can fit it into into the into the written word a man and as I've said before this is what I saw brother Billy Paul explained concerning this and the written word and I saw him do it on on a film somewhere and and he said you got to take this he said this is the written word but he said you got to put it in here a man to get the balance of it he said it there to reveal word in the written word a man by the grace of God and I said Lord I said that's exactly the truth a man so that only this way are we going to hear it the way that God wants us to hear it and we're going to see it the way that God wants us to see it but we got to do it right we got to put we got to do as our brother said put it in here but there's too many taking this and going with it no no no you got to take it and lay it in here and go and you got to go with this a man man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and it's not just what God has revealed in this hour in this age brother we got to put it in and see how it fits with all the rest that God has done down through the ages from Genesis to Revelation there's too many of them when it comes to believers and they're only focusing on what God has done in this hour only what God has done in this age brother we're not going to see it the way we need to see it we're not going to hear the way we should hear it unless we see it in the playing the purpose and the pattern of God a man we got to be able to fit it in here somewhere and say oh yeah oh yes Lord that's you a man you you did this you started this you did this and then oh well there was a Luther and there was a Wesley and now now there's a melancholy for a man now we're getting into the eel or revelation or we're getting into the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ we're getting into the revelation of the resurrection we're getting into the revelation of the rapture a man but how are we going to see it the way we should see it are we going to hear the way we should hear whether we got to put it in here amen it is it is a revealed word a man whether this is the revealed word but let's get back to the word and see what God is revealing a man to see the mystery of God in the scriptures it is written it is thus saith the lord a man it is not just all William Branham said this wheel in Wrentham said that and it's in this magic sereth in that message brother he kind of he takes us back to the word amen even in this message right here I have heard but now I see brother and he takes us back to Joel and brother that's not going back to the Jew you know in the middle of the Bible that book was written before any other book was written a man Joel was there before the book of Genesis was written a man what Joel be experienced in the revelation that God gave Joel became it was before Genesis a man that's hard for a lot of people to believe because all what the book of Joel was somewhere you know whether 1:30 waits for the Bible makes no difference a man got our data to be pretty what there ain't man but but God what job experience and what God was revealing fruit roll brother it was before the book of Genesis amen but God ordained it to be put in the Bible where he where it is why because after reading Genesis and and the Old Testament and the end the Old Covenant a man under the law there we needed to get into the book of Joel a mayor because I tell you this if there's anything that drove had it wasn't the law it was grace a man hallelujah because people were getting caught up with the law and there are people yet today are still under the under the influence of the law and the Old Covenant and trying to mix it with the New Covenant no no it's Grace and brother name we want to go back to the book of Joel that is to hear God the way we need to hear and to see the things of God we need to do a we need to see it amen and that's why god oh he was before Genesis though he's before Abraham there's before Moses a man he was before all the others a man blessed be the name of the Lord yet is it is a testimony of the grace of God amen and then and not only that Jesus played it back to Joel and he wanted to remember the patience of Joe he want to remember a job this and job that a man as her father God brings out in the message he said God is not correcting job he said God is purging job a man God is is it's just making job more and more and more righteous he's bringing out more and more faith in Joe hallelujah Joe oh my god was challenging Joe but a man he knew where job was maybe even before the book of Genesis and he said where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth hey when the son morning stars sang together the sons of God said of her joy ain't man and the morning star was the ministry and the sons of God the the seed the seed of God the children of God and he said so where were you when I did this hey man Joe we got a revelation hallelujah and him brother he was condemned by the world a man the bride to be condemned by the world a man they they they were crucifying Christ in Joel amen amen but God was given to how God was endeavoring to show ain't man to show you and me the revelation of Christ in Joel the revelation of the grace of God in Joel amen thank God brother which we look through the Old Testament over there that's that's the law no we go back here as grace a man brother if there's any other book that stands there I there's not not many I attended this the book of Job stands out a man because it is a testimony of the grace of God so God Elvis and we get into it to hear it the way we should hear it and see what God wants us to see it and see the way that God wants us to see it a man see they didn't they didn't all see Luther's message the way that or they didn't all hear it the way God wanted them to hear it they didn't all see it the way that God wanted to see it where there's Wesley or the Pentecostals or even the old fashioned Salvation Army and other revivals that God started no no no they got they they were caught up with emotion they were caught up with the with the flesh but they didn't get the revelation of the word in their hearts you got to hear it a man by they by the year of the soul a man you got to see it as God wants you to see it in your soul not in your mind no no no that's that's what the withers Wesley yeah even Wesley and Luther and the Pentecostals at the beginning they got into it and I and they was all flesh hey man there they were looking at it through there through the mind then they were sensing everything's true through the flesh they wanted this they wanted that and Wesley couldn't see it the way that God wanted him to see it he never heard it the way God wanted him to hear a man God let him go and do this and go do that go do something else amen God God proved all those sayings and that Joel that led to I let Luther know that none of that works amen you're not justified by works and I justified by this and I just thought I buy that you're justified by Christ amen he mentioned Jesus justified us Jesus sanctified us Jesus filters with the Holy Ghost amen jesus didn't law hey man it is not me going to do this it is God by grace through faith are we justified amen by grace or favor sanctified by grace or favor filled with the Holy Ghost and it is by grace through faith that we are resurrected and raptured amen what is the faith it is the revelation of what God is doing and what God has done God show Luther you're justified amen how do you show them that he showed him in the word a man he was going here he was going there he was doing this doing that and to finally he couldn't go any more he couldn't do anything else I don't know how to do he said I know finally he open up the Bible and he opened a lot to that right word there and it struck his heart it struck his soul a man it wasn't something he was just reading with his natural eyes no he was reading with the eye of the heart amen hallelujah and God spoke to him Alleluia and he heard it with the year of his soul let him that hath been here hear what the Spirit is saying to Luther amen and he heard it hey man and he just read that one verse of scripture and he struck him and you know hallelujah praise the Lord and as I said he picked up the marker there and he wrote on that Bible in that church he wrote alone hey man the just shall live by faith alone hey man and Luther and Wesley discovered the same thing where'd he get it from he got it from Wesley's Luther's teaching he did oh you got a friend Luther's teaching and on down brother there was the pet there was the Salvation Army and and they were bridging the gap between the Methodists and the Pentecostals and then where did the Pentecostals get where they wasn't what God was giving them even from the Salvation Army why because when when they were prayed they were preaching near the end of their ministries they were preaching what would order we need he said we need what they had on the day of Pentecost hey man we need the power of the Holy Ghost we need the anointing of the Holy Ghost amen we need this we need that and yeah our brother will remove that even his wife we was preaching then they were preaching those things they were teaching the people this is what we need because we got big churches we got lots of money and we got lots of people what we need now is the Holy Ghost amen that's what they were teaching what would he do they were appointing the people to the to the pentecost revival a mayor and brother going on the pentecost revival water water we looking for one of them for the resurrection of the rapture amen there's nothing else we're just a resurrection and the rapture so god help us whether they get into it brother let me say it's very very serious hey man if not some of you gonna get into with your natural eyes your natural ears no it's got to be the Holy Ghost in you it's got to be a revelation in your heart by the great that's gonna strike you and there's got a man brothers go to oh it's gonna strike in a in a way that's gonna make you serious it's gonna make you an absolute different person amen it made a Luther a different person in a Wesley a different person it made the Pentecostals different hey may brother how much more is there going to make the bride that's getting ready for the rapture and the resurrection amen it's separated Lutheran separator the Bay the Methodist its separated the Pentecostals that much greater it says the separation of those that's gone in a resurrection rapture amen brother it's the same thing you know in the Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ hey man so it's going to be in the Ministry of mrs. Jesus Christ in this hour Amen he was totally absolutely separated a man from the front those in his generation they never understood him they couldn't catch though the revelation of what was going on in his life and they'll not catch the revelation what's going on in the Indian the bride a man they'll think you're crazy the other thing you lose you're losing your mind and so oh yeah they they thought there's something gone wrong with Jesus because why because he laid aside his shrines and his wonders and brother he even stopped to stop preaching amen prior to this thing that happened in the ministry of Malachi for in this last hour these last days a man and he said era and he got to the place where he stopped preaching this was not preaching that and he said in 1963 here I go he said back into evangelism hey man because he knew that the first poll was done the second bullet was done and now the third poll was finished a man died who's waiting on God to do what God was going to do for the bride hey man and only realized that if God was going to take him off the scene amen because way the there wasn't striking them right then he said that I'll let you sit down in a moment but it wasn't striking him right he said I know it's not striking us right he says not strike he you right and he says not striking me right hey man because he knew if it struck us right we go in the resurrection than the rapture amen he knew that's what it was ordained to do in this hour the Serb Pope was rapturing faith Amen sir brother sister we better get serious with the Word of God we better get serious with the truth we better get serious with Jesus hey man we're very serious with the revealed Word ain't man we better be looking for what Luther was looking for justification he got it amen and he saw the way that he needed to see it he heard it and he saw the way needed to see it it was they both the voice of the Holy Ghost speaking through the word same request me chamber the Pentecostals amen by the grace of God now it's so bright in the bright age not that I've seen age rather than wearing a bright age and brothers going to make us more serious but I wonder and I don't bring much if there's many that really want to get out of here and leave behind the things you got the things you're enjoying in this life the things you love in this way the things you put the emphasis on in this in this world amen are you ready to leave it hey man are you ready to drop it are you ready to let it go amen any moment now say I'm going thank you Jesus hey man so now I know the enemy is there to get you to worry about this get you to think about this and worry about that one worry about somebody else no no let's worry about the world with the word on Jesus let's think about Jesus hey man he maybe we put so much emphasis on Jesus we're putting on on this one in that one or this and that and something else we'd be gone yes or the grace of God brother it's serious I want to share with you and I will see if we have the Lord willing when we get to the message again and I have heard but now I see or hearing and see but in the mean though I want to share with you these scriptures and there's a quote here that I was going through our brother marks notes then he that he ministered on I guess three or four weeks ago whenever it was and I was going to print it trying to get into a pamphlet form and sure with you and I was going through this quote city here there by those by the prophet of God and and this quote struck me a man because there was something that I experienced on Monday night or early Tuesday morning they also want to share with you a man it's serious it is absolutely serious brother so I pray the grace of God we're going to we're going to have the ear of the soul to hear what God wants us to hear and how that God wants us to hear it and we're going to see it with the eye of the soul the way that God wants us to see it a man sir is going to change our attitude change our spirit change our motives and objectives amen by the grace of Almighty God a man is a serious brother well it was serious in the days of Jesus and the disciples knew there was something different about Jesus different about his ministry and the world is going to recognize something different about the bright a man and no wonder again is the profit Center if they got asked to pick out a dozen he said IB he'd be shocked yeah if he had to figure out a dozen and he said there might be he said so many thousand and then he brought it down to several hundred and he brought it down to five hundred two hundred whatever you know and so many he said they're dead a living Saints on the earth that'll go in the rapture it's not gonna be many anyway how do you know that that's the Lord he said if he didn't shorten time to be no flesh st. case of God to us don't you take don't pop yourself up you better puff Jesus up a man that's not all eight ourselves and think we're somebody we're nobody he's the one this give the glory to Jesus and tell of his love amen and His divine law I'm not not natural of divine love by the grace of God and you wanna know the evidence of the Holy Ghost divine love a man because the Bible says you can do this you can do this you can even understand the mysteries understand this a new come heaven faith to move mountains and he said but if you don't have the divine love he says all being God help us some people think I can do this I can do that yeah where's your do you divine law grace of God there's power divine love is powerful hey man why because God is not and he is divine huh amen god help us sir let's hear the word the way God wants us to hear tonight as we'll get into this quote that had that our brother Mark had highlighted and maybe when when he administered on on the message what was the title that our brother Mark Minister doc what was it brother oh you can't remember what keeps me a man he was reaching out what keeps me and he did bring bring this quote not shared with you and I want to highlight to some experience that I had on Monday night or Tuesday morning in proverbs chapter 20 beginning to read a verse five counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out they'll take counsel when how many is going to take counsel today no no they feel that they know what to do when to do it how to do it they know they feel they don't need any counsel and it says most men will proclaim everyone is own goodness but a faithful man who can find and his faithfulness to the Lord a man in his favorite of God he be faithful to the body of Christ but it said the just man walketh in his only in his integrity and his children are blessed after him a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scatter the way all evil with his eyes who can say I have made my heart clean I am pure from my sin divers weights and divers measures both of them are alike abomination to the Lord even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure or whether it be right a man the hearing ear and the scene I the LORD have made even both of them a man the hearing ear and the scene I the Lord has made even both of them a man so we think it's on the inside of the inside us in your soul amen it is the seed of God predestinated to to hear what God wants him to hear the way he wants him to hear and to see what God wants you to see and to see it the way God wants you to see it a man there are many different ideas about the end at the end of the day all time a man in what's going on now even what God is buried some see it this way some see it that way some are hearing this I'm hearing that but the bride is hearing the truth God is bright is hearing the way God wants her to hear a man and there's many around the message that are not hearing it the way they should amen you're not seen it the way they should as I said there's too many there they just see a prophet you know or they see this book or they see a tape or whatever no brother sisters you got to see Christ amen well be with but bear with me we didn't play attention to the work amen none it's not the excitement of the above a preacher brother it's it's it's a complicity of the word God is hidden and God is revealed in simplicity any man you talk with the Lord's prayers God in simplicity hey man praise the name of the Lord and yet brother we would left the impression around this message what get the impression that all that there there are many Christians out there they say all those that believe the measure with a random is that they won't say the Lord's Prayer oh yeah they left that impression and there very few that will repeat the Lord's Prayer we thank God for brother Carson's influence in getting us started and those things by the grace of God amen god help us brother so again the hearing ear and the scene i the lord have made even both of them a man I trust God has made your ear and he's made your eye that's in your soul god bless you may be seated turn with me to first Corinthians chapter 2 first Corinthians chapter 2 and beginning to read at verse 6 howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory a man which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory they didn't know it because they didn't hear the word the way they needed to hear it they didn't see it the way they needed to see it they never recognized the Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Ministry of the Messiah to them he was false to them as I have violated to a number of people that are keeping Saturday Sabbath I should they crucified Jesus for breaking the a man but Jesus says I am the lord of the Sabbath and that he could do what he wanted on the Sabbath but they they had a day that Abra legalize down to the just to the letter of the word and there are many today that I got he got the message legalize down to the letter of the message a man but there's a spiritual revelation that God wants us to hear and there's a spiritual revelation what God has done and what God is doing and that's what God wants us to see that's what God wants us to recognize it is not a recognizing God's and a prophet it is not just to recognize they God through the Provident and the Ministry of the Prophet that there was the old many of the seven seals we got that we got to get the revelation of why God did what he did why God sent that prophet and why God should their provenance for that ministry a man opened the mystery of the seven seals to the elect of God in the last days a man why did he show the probably with a three pull ministry why did you should a prophet to do this and do that and then take it away from him and just to speak the word a man there was that there was a reason for that a man so I pray God that we're going to see what God did it as I said for many years that he did all that was preached once God has sent a prophet God has sent a prophet God has sent a prophet help under 19 and 19 1972 it began to change and by 1977 it was changed and for the greater part there were ministries of not preaching God's and a prophet but they were preaching the prophesy amen and so our brother Paula Fontaine brought out he said any and he brought that quote out with a prophet said we got a goal from the Prophet to the prophecy and we got to go from the messenger to the message a man so it was in the 19 and 70 so we began to get get away from the emphasis on William Brown and begin to get into the emphasis on our Lord Jesus Christ amen where we're moving from the prophecy to the from the Prophet to the prophecy and moving from a man by the grace of Almighty God from the mess to the message so god help us by the sister that we are getting more and more into the message we're getting more and more into what God wants us to hear and what God wants us to see in the message and it's not again it's not just all the Prophet came and the Prophet did this and the Prophet did the head and the same and the mystery of the seven seals was revealed and now we know this and now we know they had this doctrine that doctrine yeah but why did God do what he did amen he had a reason for doing what he did in lugar in Wesley in the Pentecostals and he had a reason for doing what he has done in the Ministry of William Branham in the Ministry of Malachi for a man but the Bible says he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the father's as he has he turned your hearts back to the faith of our for our forefathers a man as he turned our hearts back to the faith of those in the Pentecostal revival as he turned our hearts back to those in the in Wesley survival in the Methodist revival even to those I on the day of Pentecost a man by the grace of Almighty God so brother there's many that don't recognize that they don't realize this is what God is looking for in them in their lives in their testimony what they're saying in what they're doing hey man it is the reflection of the message it has given them the faith that God wants them to have in this hour the part of God say concerning they will be the seven seals he said that it's the third pole and he's in the third and in the third pole he said his rapture II faint amen her brother here there there there was a ministry as they said that God finally revealed justification to Luther sanctification to Wesley the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit to the Pentecostals but now brother it is the coming of the Lord to the bright bright amen and there is an invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the early bride amen that Ikki came he came they came to redeem the bride now he has come to get the bright a man he has come to enter into a union with his bride a man why for it is take her take her to the marriage supper of the Lamb by the grace of Almighty God amen brother closer we to the to the rapture how close will be to the resurrection how much longer is God gonna let it go on amen brother hey it's been over 50 years now since they're going to the prophet it's been almost 60 years since the Rivini of the seven seals amen since the old me of the mystery of God to give a give the bride right through faith and brother we've been we've been preaching and ministering about the Prophet and we've been preaching and ministering about the message of the hour amen for all of these years not brother where where is our faith as it has it improved our faith as it increased our faith as it made our faith stronger amen brother we're living in a world we're living in a realm now where people are putting more and more and more faith in the natural things of life and less than the spiritual anymore there are plenty more lenses on the natural things I left side the spiritual things I'll tell you this whether we're seed of God and we're the sons and daughters of God we're going to put more emphasis on the spiritual and less and less and less on the natural amen why because we know what we see out there in the world now we know that the natural things of life this too shall pass away a man Jesus recognized what was going on in his ministry he realized he was coming down to the end of his ministry he realized the change in administering a man he realized that he was gonna have to lay down his life what he knew what he was he came for he knew what he was gonna do he knew what he had to do a man because he promised that he was going to stay true to his own word amen he was going to lay down his life for you and me lay down his life to redeem all the seed of God amen that were born in sin Satan iniquity come to the world speak unless a man go sing he was 33 years old brother not much is that night night not not very old when it comes to a young man he even back then at 33 years old and he recognized that he was coming to the end of that of his natural life a man why what was it based on it was base word human face on the word he knew it was written it was written hey man that he had the lead on his life a man and then when he was getting closer and closer and closer to the third pole you know he was as I said he was saying how much longer will I be with you he wanted to go anyhow oh yeah because he couldn't stand this the sin he couldn't stand the unbelief he wanted to get out of this world hey man how much longer would I be with you because we even he was he was experiencing more and more and more unbelief and less less and less and less faith amen under finally he made the statement when he prayed for the disciples and he prayed for the seed of God he pray for you and me amen in John chapter 17 and who finally said I am no more in the world what that's amazing amen he recognized that he was approaching that third Pole amen and in the third pole he was going to lay down his light pick it out and he was going from time to eternity again he was going back to where he come from that's like I said you know the scripture let me say it again many and he said there no man has ascended up to heaven only he that came down from heaven even the Son of man who is in heaven what did it what did they think about that when they heard it amen what do you say the man the son of man who who came down and who is what do you mean he is in heaven you're here no no it's the off and he was there a man the prophet of God say see what happened we bypassed earth theophany because of sin but he said Jesus didn't bypasses the Alpha knee any man he came and he talked to it was a hey brave a blademan man as Melchizedek a man a man see and when Abraham saw him coming he said don't Street those three angels and and he recognized the Lord a man he said would they did they came from the theophanies into either blended into those bodies amen yeah cuz and and and Abraham went cooked the lamb and he offered it to Jesus it was Jesus and he called him Lord yeah he call him Lord and the other two angels went on down to it or to minister to lot in Sodom and Gomorrah but the other one came to Amen hallelujah Abraham very man why because of the promise and brother now yes coming this hour in this age amen the same Lord is coming this hour on this aid and he and brother he's putting the bride the same attitude that he ain't how much longer will we be here a minute longer we do I had to put up with all that foolishness out there in the world it's getting worse and worse and worse brilliancy insanity of the age that we're living in it's an insane world and much longer so it's Christ in us brother and brother the same what what he felt we are feeling the brightest feeling amen the Andrew that he had the bride God that he I am and the finally brother I pray grace we're getting we're getting to that revelation I am no more in the world come on now you took on take your faith to produce that let's go take your faith faith in what God has done what God is doing and what God is going to do that's what's gonna put to produce that attitude in you oh yeah you you just won't feel comfortable there at all you you you and people want feel comfortable with you because because why because they're on the world and you're not there's such a difference between you and them any man there of time in your of eternity brother they're getting more and more caliber tired and we're getting more will cook more caught up with eternity old brothers sister I pray God in the name of Jesus loved us as I said do we realize and we hungry and thirsty for for the kingdom of God what as I was thinking on my way here tonight and Oh what language are we're going to be talking in in in heaven well language are we gonna be talking in in the kingdom of God anybody in what language sir we're gonna be talking in the new heaven and new earth amen brother I trust were getting getting further away from this old world closer to that one Amen that's right by the grace of God somebody said one time like one of our brothers that ministered here he said that he felt that we would that we would speak English English would be the will be the language of of heaven English will be the language of the new heaven new earth I don't know who that no I don't think so oh all due respect you know I don't I don't think so no definitely not English this is any language that curse God is the English language a man and her cursing God more amen so regardless of the language whatever God wants to choose as God's choice ain't man we're gonna talk it we're gonna how I believe we're all gonna have the same language and knowing that the public God should we get here in glorified bodies he said we may there's time who we won't need to talk you see we'd be able to communicate by thought yeah your thought my thought your thought my thought amen old brother what a place is gonna be I pray grace that we are going to getting a greater and a greater and a greater desire to get out of here and into the kingdom of God I am no brother let's get to that place I am no more in the world because I'm more and more and more caught up with God I am more and more power with the Lord and more and more caught with it with heaven than I am this whole world I can't wait to get out I can't wait to get into the glorified body no oh people feel no no no no no just wait wait wait wait no God's waiting on you the prophecy yeah you gotta want to if we are all waiting on Jesus to finally see he wanted to get out he wanted to get out of this world he wanted to get out of this world he wanted to get out of here and he knew that to get out he what he had to do so that's why he went to get Remini and before he went there he said I'm no more in the world goodbye he knew he's gone do you know you're going I tell you this God's gonna reveal it to a bride God for the anointing and for the Ministry of the word he's gonna produce such an spirit and an attitude in the bride it's gonna be through the word oh yeah you've got to recognize the word then this is the hour for the resurrection this is the hour of the rapture amen amen amen brother the resurrection is already on I believe it's already already in progress and brother the rapture is all in progress and God is pulling us away from the world to get us more and more in to eternity he's pulling the wave of time how many feel that they're being pulled pull pull and you got no more interest in time you got a hunger and you got a thirst for eternity you're hungry and you're thirsty for your glorified body bear with me this is serious this is not Pentecost no date if the better comfort of the Pentecostal revival message the prophet of God said God didn't do away with it he said he just laid it on shelf he said the Pentecost anointed kind of cost the gifts he said they're still buried there on the shelf he said if we need them mister they're there though I know there's ministries around the message that are preaching Oh God God did away with it there's gone now well there brother if God did away with that God did away with Luther's justification he did away with Wesley's sanctification no no no see it's God said I will restore and what he restored he's not gonna do away with it's gonna stay there what for but why because it's God building us up in our faith you can't take you can take justification away what are you what are you gonna put this this revelation of the rapture our God is building us up in the most holy faith right on off just to fit your brother since we got to have the revelation of justification we gotta have the revelation of st. of vacation we gotta have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and the anointing even the revelation of the gifts yeah so that God is their God and God is God and God we got is still the healer goddess - is God still there to do this for me God is still there to help me with this help me with that a man brother and when it comes to the gifts don't do away with that there's like a you see this progressive revelation of God in his children and its sons and daughters hey man it's like you take it taking your children and putting upon them in the elementary school but and maybe the junior ah but don't let him go to the high school oh wait didn't I do that they they can talk they can write they can read so they don't need to go on to the hot to the high the high school oh yes they need more and more and more and more see well for to give us the revelation of the will of God for this hour for this age amen by the grace of God is like when I was in school one time and and like I said I only got a grade 9 diploma but I did go on to grade 11 and I remember in one grade you I don't know what grade it was but the teacher had put something on the board and it was it was mathematics and I don't know it might have been algebra well what did you call it anyway so I was always he said now he said I want you to solve this just this problem right here he says see if you can get the head and get the right answer so I looked at it oh that's simple so I and we did it on paper and then the teacher went around and looking at every student yeah you got it you got it yeah right right and then he looked at mine oh that's wrong I said wrong I said the answer is right oh yes he said the answer is right but you did it wrong I said well if I got a right answer what difference does the way I mean I did it as long as I got the right answer I sister the way I saw it and this is the way I did it I said and so on me I said you explained it and I heard it and I did it but he didn't make a correction there he just marked an X I didn't make it yeah even though I had right answer a man got Elvis brother that we're gonna have the right answer with the right spirit and the right of 19 amen with the right revelation of the word this is what God does God has got us building us up building us up building herself brother amen to what praise the name of the Lord till we're not back here in the beginning God created the heavens of the earth period let's go on to find out why he did it amen what was his purpose and what is his pattern a man so brother got it got it what for God is raising up raising us up as sons and daughters of God he's building us up in the faith so we got more and more and more faith we're doing more in this hour than they did in Luther's day God requires more of us than he did in Wesley's day or the Pentecostal age even amen and they had tremendous revival around the world the Pentecostals a man with the gifts of the Spirit a man but now gospel person not just the gifts God's looking for the resurrection and the rapture as he said the dead in Christ are waiting on us and he said God is waiting on us but back then it wasn't striking them right why because the hour wasn't there for the resurrection the other wasn't there for the rapture that's why I said isn't he said he's not even striking me right william branham yeah why he wanted he wanted to be here for the rapture but then then he it began to dawn on him that he felt the Lord was gonna take him before the rapture and he said that's the will of God then he saw him ready I'm willing to go amen we're brothers a generation rising that's supposed to be ready for the rapture and if I'll tell you this if you're your ordained and you're gonna be part of that bride and you're gonna be part of the rapture I tell you this you're gonna have a different anointing a different atmosphere you're gonna think different act different live different a man you're gonna be as the word so a lot of people think you're in a world of your own but it's you and Jesus they felt Jesus was there just in a world of his own as I said there were the scribes and Pharisees talked to the disciples because why because it seemed like they couldn't communicate with Jesus after a while there was a time when they couldn't communicate with him why because he had set is faced toward Jerusalem and he knew what was going to happen there when he got the Jerusalem he wept and cried over Jerusalem knowing what was going to happen yeah brother wait we're gonna set our faces toward the New Jerusalem and give God the glory amen that we're gonna sit with him and he's strong so I pray God grace amen that we're going to get we're gonna be totally absolutely different totally separate unto the Lord celebrated what for the resurrect the rapture listen before God brought Israel out of Egypt he separated them they were separated on to the Lord in Goshen yeah he said now he said all he said and they're all under all under the token blood of the Lamb that was slain why death was coming through Egypt and death is coming through this world the spirit of death spiritual death amen and as many of course were laid the foolish virgin will lay down their lives for the gospel they don't have the extra oil of the revealed word for this hour revealing the word we're giving this Resurrection a rapturing faith and so on they don't they don't see that they don't catch that amen but again the foolish virgin the Prophet said they're virgins so they go to the Great Tribulation yeah so just keep your attitude right your spirit right brother toward them but you haven't got the right attitude right spirit toward them you haven't got the right attitude right spirit right toward Jesus that's right whether we come to the hour of the resurrection the rapture you know it's not the world won't recognize it because there's gonna be so few that are gonna be separated unto the Lord that Jesus was he wept over Jerusalem to finally went on and did this and when I did that the funny went to get so many hey man what poor it was the example for you and me to let us know that we got to come to that place that he came to that we got to say what he said what was it not my will father dying be done just think of what he suffered what are we gonna suffer he was going to lay down his life and pick it up again yes he said no man takes it from me he gave up the ghost they never took her from you give it up yeah praise the Lord but he picked it up again and shared it with you and me and now he's now the fullness of the Godhead body is in the bright for the rapture for the resurrection Jesus raised that raised that body up again and it was in a glorified condition and of course he raised the Old Testament Saints up not all of them but most of them he raised him up and and when he went up they went up there was a resurrection and a rapture now there's a resurrection a rapture now for the bride for the Gentiles but it's going to be a mystery to the world and even a mystery to a lot of so-called believers but to do this the anointing is going to be on the bride it was on Jesus the bridegroom now he's going to be on the bride as I said the Alpha now the Omega the Alpha he redeemed our souls this Omega is redeeming our bodies grace let's see bear with me I said first Corinthians - six again verse nine but as it is written the I have not seen nor the ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him but our eye is seen and our and the ear is hearing what God has prepared for us for them that love him the resurrection the rapture but God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit thank God for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God you got to have the Holy Ghost in you now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God amen grace of God go with me to chapter 15 chapter 15 I read it not too long ago let's hear it again faith comes by hearing the word and the word that God will reveal is the word that's ordained for the hour in which we lived in first Corinthians 15 and verse 45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from evam as is the earthy such are they that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly grace that were in the heavenly realm with the heavenly anointing and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God and neither doth corruption inherit incorruption the old I show you a mystery but brother it's a revealed mystery to you and me he-man because this is the hour when God is bringing it to pass and it says we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed the grace of God in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality brother what God has ordained to give us that faith God has done let me share with you the quote again that I got from our brothers notes and it's questions and answers on the seven seals 1963 pay attention to what the profit is warning the people it's a warning if there's ever an hour never an age that we that we ought to catch what he's saying is this is this hour is this is this time maybe they didn't fully catch what he was saying then but we ought to catch it now because we're living in a more serious hour now than they did it was serious then a man but yet God was still moving by his spirit over the earth the anointing that was in the atmosphere back then not the same anointing that's here now back then you could sense the Holy Spirit in in the atmosphere oh yeah but now you you don't brother it's not there no more now it's made flesh and the bride the Provost said the fullness of the Godhead bodily is now in the bride God was moving by his spirit here he was moving by his Spirit there there everywhere you all the atmosphere was was was filled with the anointing around the world but now no matter where I go I don't sense that atmosphere I don't sense that the anointing out there like it used to be know why people are not going to church like they used to people people don't respect God like they used to he we don't respect Christians like they used to be we don't respect church like they used to as I've said I've looked at a window one time and in in in a house that I was in and look out and there was a clergy from a denomination there and he was he was standing on the road and he had his hands laid on a man and he was praying for him what outdoors yeah her doors he apparently he was walking one way and that person was walking another and and he met this person and to begin to talk and their conversation no doubt maybe he got spiritual and I'm personal and and that that that gentleman wanted prayer and the and the clergy just he didn't didn't take a little work we'll go over it to the church we'll go into your house no no he just he just stood in the middle of the road oh yeah stood in the middle of the road ladies hands on him both hands and prayed for him where you gonna find that today you already find that in in the church let alone outside the church yeah brother grace of God seated the Holy Ghost is is pulling away now and the only at one time the anointing was there the non he was there the anointing was there now the anointing is in the bride for the resurrection in the rapture and it's so few oh yeah it's so few that you you can't sense it like you used to the only ones are gonna sense it are those that are going in the rapture and going into resurrection and I know many of you don't don't catch what I'm saying in that because you haven't experienced it but at 71 years old I've experienced it yeah brother the prophet of God referred to even lap overs from one age to another because he referred to our brother brother Willard Collins and he said brother Collins he says you're concerned about your father yes he said brother Ram I am he said don't worry brother he said he's going to be there he said you're concerned because yeah he did he said he didn't know he don't believe the message and he said don't see this and he don't see that and brother bounce with no brother he doesn't he said because he is from the previous age another age and he said he's part of a lap over he said into this age and he said he's going to be there and I think he was he was a Presbyterian yeah that was back then many many years ago and so he said just leave him with the Lord and move on yourself by the grace of God a man so just all we can do brother is just leave it and it was lap overs back then and when we first come to the message to his lap overs I didn't look down on him just because he in a denomination or in this church or in that church because why I knew I knew that even the Spirit of God was still if I measure in that church the Spirit of God my measure was in that church I said I was sense the anointing with that person and with the other person a man but as time went on they got less and less and less and not only that brother there they there recognized it in themselves now because as that sister told me when she was in a certain denomination or church over there and not long there long ago and she's an old brother she said I was talking about water work what things were getting like yes he said you're right she said because she said there's there's I don't know if she says anybody in our church now she said less than 50 years old she said everybody is just seniors and getting older and so on but she said all the young people are not going or they're pulling away he said him well she said one time she saw used to even teach the Sunday School but she says no one there to teach now and a lot of churches are experiencing the same thing that the young people are pulling away not only that there's messy churches experiencing the same thing that there's less and less and less young people coming in and being a part of this and part of that so brother I pray the grace of God help us amen then when we see all these things happen brother we know that the anointing is the anointing is in the resurrection now in the rapture that's what God is looking for in you and me it's not all preach this doctrine preach this stuff preach that doctrine brother let's get in the resurrection let's get in the rapture it's not just did not not have a denomination of doctrines and doctrines and doctrines let's let's get and do what Jesus wants us to do or less yield ourselves for Jesus to do what he wants to do and that's the resurrection I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we should all be changed amen in questions and answers on the seals he said all of you are conscious and know that there's something mysterious happening and it is happening and he said I know what it is but they didn't and he said I'm not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know what it is and it'll be the grace of God to let the bride know that the rapture and the resurrection is upon us and God is now requiring the rapture and the resurrection well don't wait for God to do it he's waiting for you to do it whether all that God has done is to give us that faith yeah he said the OB the Seventh Seal with the third pole rapture in faith and he said he said it's something that's tremendous and it's gone right now and there's not a way in the world for you to see it but so help me with the Bible in my hand he said I know what it is he knew but they didn't he may it's like he preached in jeffersonville how can I overcome because why because there are a lot of believers in his Tabernacle that were not overcomers they never had the faith that God was looking for oh you rebuke them and he said I'll keep preaching until you stop doing it he says so help me with this Bible in my hand I know what it is it's been told to you before so just don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour yeah because got what we need in this hour God was doing back here and that was the opening of the seven seals the Rivini of the mystery of God to give the bride rapturing faith a man to give us the revelation of what God was doing what God was focusing on now what we're focusing on the resurrection the rapture each then has been told you before so just don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour will you just be real humble be a Christian try to live for God and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you he said you see you only may commit a mysterious something and missed a real program of you mess rather not miss it but any SS you messed a real program of God up brother I tell you there's a lot of people messing it all up it's going they're going on with this doctrines going with that doctrine leading the people astray here stray they're focusing on this focusing on that brother it's God in simplicity justification in Luther Wesley bad son sanctification name we know the gifts of the Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost but what's next it's the resurrection in the rapture and as I said that simple detail when it comes to the mr. mystery is raised how God is doing it but it's going to be very very simple so simple people are going to miss it why am I tell you that the resurrection the rapture is gonna be such a simple thing it has come between you and God but you got to be sensitive to what God's doing you gotta be sensitive to the resurrection and rapturing faith you gotta be you got to grow more and more into resurrection or atrophy you've got become more and more conscious of the resurrection and of the rapture more and more conscious of eternity more and more conscious of the kingdom of God anybody you're gonna you you will if you're if you're spiritual and living in the spirit walking in the spirit by the grace of God you're just going to get a totally different atmosphere totally different feeling around you and in you that you are you'll be like Christ I am no more in the world Norah and now I know I'm more into eternity now there's time has got less and less effect on me less and less influence in my life Lord eternity is getting more influence that's gonna be the resurrection of rapture it's gonna be very simple it'll be the life you're living oh yes in reflecting the life that you're living he said just be a real humble be a Christian try to live for God and live honest with your fellow man I love those who don't love you hmm is this tremendous you see you only make it a mysterious something and mr. and miss the real program of God up and I'll tell you brother there's a lot of there that's messed up the message there because of the way they're teaching it and what and how they're teaching it and what they're putting the emphasis on and so on they've got it they're making a mess out of it he said yesterday afternoon something happened in my room that I'll never be able to leave it you see he said about two weeks ago something happened that'll never be able he says long as I live on this earth I'll never be able to get away from it well brothers for the preaching of the word and the mystery of God made flesh and the bride there's something gonna happen in your life you're not gonna be able to get away from it's going to take preeminence over over all the natural things of life yeah what you're putting the emphasis on really indicates whether your spiritual or not spiritual well brother no we can't do this can't do that oh yes this to comforted an African think this to just passed away god help us he said I'll never be able to get away from it and so the church you're not supposed to know these things so don't put no interpretation to anything you just go ahead and just remember what you're told live a Christian life go to your church yeah knobbly or sting kill they don't even go to church that's true they feel they don't have to go to church the Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and much more as she see the Day approaching man we would take a vote have served some Sunday night as well as Sunday morning as I said one time they would have services three or four times a week I think our brother car does well god bless them hey man yeah and now it's getting less and less and less oh yeah why because work more caught up with natural things than spiritual how many are willing to do as Jesus did lay down your life as he lay down as you lay down yours as he sacrifice what he sacrificed that our sacrifice how real is eternity great stress so he said go to your church be a real light wherever you are and just burn for Christ and tell the people how you love him and just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people hey man this is tremendous but this is the bride that's the right let your testimony be would love all the time with the people because if you don't you if you don't you twist yourself out into something there and he said then you're off the beaten track see every time you try to do it he said you've done that so just don't try to make no interpretation and especially tonight when that seal becomes up in front of you again they are interpreting the seals they're adding to the revelation of the seals they're taken away from the revelation of the seals leave it the way that it is don't make it bigger than what it is or smaller than what it is grace of God and that said that shield is referring to as the seventh seal so he said just don't try to interpret it just go ahead and just be humble and go right on with the same plain message hey plain there's a lot of preachers making it complicated it's not very plain it's not simple dietary this the prophet of God revealed the simplicity of what God was God has done and what God is doing amen brother the ministry couldn't explain it other ministries couldn't explain it but the prophet of God came with the revelation of God's plan and purpose and he showed us the seven seals are the seven churches and he showed us the seventh the seven seals and so on and the stature of a perfect man grace of God to us grace grace grace brother again you know the prophet of God said if you look at that picture and if you see anything more than that pillar of fire he said he said you're not seeing it right you're not looking at it right he said it why you got don't don't look at William Branham he said look at the pillar of fire amen as I said about that sister that was in the hospital and she had that picture on on the table next to her bed in hospital and she looked at it she was praying she looked at it and when she looked at it she looked at the pillar fire and the pillar of fire began to move from the picture to her and she was healed hey Mary but we got a look at not William Branham we got a look at Jesus Christ and not only that when he pointed to the clouds and the cloud of angels see he said there he is looking down at us he said in the cloud of angels but he said one the one the last message he preached he pointed the cloud ISA see there he is looking down at us and he's you can see his eyes there's his eye there as I there a main anise tea it's it's just like the picture of our Lord Jesus Christ there hey man and someone is all ated 2pac - cuz brother bouncin he was caught up and you can see brother brown on the side yeah he said I was cut up cuz he is he was attracted to the seventh angel yeah is God in simplicity oh they're trying to figure out where did that cloud come from they said this it was too high to be a natural cloud and there was no planes or anybody anything that had gone by to make that cloud they said oh yeah I got I've got the scientists the science reports you know in a scientific magazine that was published years ago still published and I got the Life magazine also of the picture and so on all different you have that and so on and they were saying there was no there was no no no Club no no no planes no jets no nothing there and they said it's too high to be a natural cloud because they said it would you wouldn't be able to have the the moisture up there to make a cloud and so on so they don't know what it was and as I said maybe I'll bring the magazine and show you again concerning the Life magazine amazing Life magazine yeah it's eternal life so brother/sister and again you you look at this cloud and they they got this and this in in the end in the magazine and as I said if you want to older magazine up that that page and when you look through the page what do you see on the other side a rainbow and they were and you opened it Oh rainbow yeah but again even that was a mystery why if a picture was taken in taken in Mexico at midnight and they said this is the this is the rainbow at midnight in Mexico and it's amazing that they printed that picture and that mystery on one side of the page and on the other side the page they printed the angels of God that wasn't that wasn't just accidental I think God ordained that a man why why if that brother that's revelation 10 because the mighty angel came down for the opening of the seven seals the mystery of the seven seals with a rainbow over easy revelation 10 old brother though do Tago a witness to the world the world the world's been witness to a man and the world has being witness to as I say concerning our the homepage that our brother Mark and myself did a mint with over 2 million hits and this banner that's been around the world I receive I received the emails from from even royalty yeah in certain countries I've received emails from other countries that are not Christian not allowed that Christians stopped and wanted to know if they could download and print the things on our homepage yeah so we the brethren through their printing I have ministered to over 62 countries yeah and I would say there's a lot more than that we don't know about that's the countries we know about and then and again as I said before that brother told us that that a 1988 as a result of printing that the Brethren did and that's before the home page as we saw the printing that we did then the brothers printed it I remember another mark typing it typing out of booklet or something pregnant and then the sisters sitting all around to collate the paid the booklets and so on and the brother told me that as a result of all of that that we had started at 1988 over 300 churches in Africa alone and he said brother they're still growing I said well praise the Lord to God be the glory this is tremendous brother so we thank God we don't not gonna take the glory to ourselves we'll give the glory to God amen so it was it was the Lord that was moving on our brother mark when he called me and asked me but putting the message on on that's right because back then there in 1995 there wasn't not one one answer to the to the name William Branham it was zero he got one he got one reply to the name Branham and that that had to do with some sort of a sport that something that I did there was a there was somebody there named Brent him and he was proud of a sport I'm not sure what the sport was and football I don't know what it was and so on but bolding okay no bowling so that's how it was so I said okay I said let's go I'm not just gonna cost and then we'll if we can do it we'll put it up so it's up that was the first reference to William Branham and the message thank God to God be the glory brother yeah brother god help us I believe it's finished now it's over with now he said just don't interpret nothing if God wants you to know anything you'll send it to you so just be real real solid now all still something has happened he said you understand what I mean don't you if you can't understand it he said this is that third pole he said you should have caught it the other day you remember there be no impersonation like there was of the other two poles he just said - but it's the two poles he's referring to a man and he said there be no one person there was impersonations of the other two poles but they couldn't impersonate this certain third Pole they condemned as I said and it's on the internet they said we don't brand I made these two signs he had these two two two two things that he did when it comes to the discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and and the sign in his hand and so on but he said how do you reconcile somebody with those signs how can you reconcile that and the message that he preached they said this that's a mystery well it's a mystery that the bright understands they don't understand no because they think is his message was false and they can't reconcile it with with the signs that he had so thank God brother for what God has done and what God is doing he saw things that he wouldn't tell us he experienced things that he wouldn't tell us and he also said he said I got things in my heart he said that'll easily be there he said when I go he wouldn't tell us he saw things that that maybe we're seeing now and he saw things that we won't see but he saw it and it struck him he knew that we are we were at the end of the world surely we know we're at the end of the world surely we know that we're reaching the time of the resurrection and the rapture but I'll tell you that anointing it's going to bring us to a greater and greater separation it's going to cut us off more and more cut us off from the world and the things of the world it's like I said it was a dream that I had on Monday night or early Tuesday morning for me to explain it I can't do it but all I know is that it was the rapture yes they said the rapture yes they were difficult to explain it's something that I experienced in the dream and I saw my glorified body it was I was up there I can't I can't explain even in what I what I was sensing not feeling it's not feeling his it's faith and I was wondering what was going on what's going on what's going on moving here moving they're moving they're moving there and then then it's like I wasn't subject to to the to the dimension or or the atmosphere anything it's like you you were you were just floating around just floating around I said what's going on and then there was a revelation it's the rapture it's sir rapture there is your glorified body and I was looking looking looking looking reaching for but then I woke up I said oh lord I would lay back in on the bed and tried and trying to trying to get back into it again trying to get back into it again no it was gone I said oh oh Lord I'll share it with the people and let him know that we're approaching that hour they don't know that this is this is the time for them to reach out to their glorified bodies yeah see the dead in Christ are waiting on us and the prophets said they're going to appear to us amen they're going to appear to us and then he said we're going to I'm gonna go into that dimension where they are but he said we're gonna go instantly he said to our glorified bodies and he said instantly we're gonna be changed not glorified by theophany bodies and instantly will be changed to glorified bodies and then he said they're being glorified bodies the dead in Christ and then he said we look up and he said oh that pillar of fire will have gone back into glory incarnated in the body called Jesus and there he is coming down and he said we look up at here he's coming down in the clouds and he said we're gonna rise to meet him amen that is the resurrection the rapture amen the catching away of the bride to be with the bridegroom and a marriage supper of the Lamb he's here now oh yeah that's it that's him in the pillar of fire there he isn't that in that cloud of angels so what brother/sister the proper was caught up in that cloud so the bride's gonna be cut off amen Jesus was cut up in a cloud and he said as you seen him go he saw so come in like manner and he did that was our Elvis that was Christ coming down in the cloud of angels Christ coming down in the in the pillar of fire amen and at the time of the resurrection and the rapture and we're big Lord we're going to change them to glorified bodies remember the promise said that pillar fire will incarnate itself again into the body called Jesus and come down to unite with the bride he's uniting now spiritually but then we're going to get together Christ in the glorified body any in his body they're in his glorified body and the bride and her glorified body and we're going on to sit with him in his strong brother Branham said now he should understand he didn't say we're going to sit with him on the throne in Israel amen it is the stronger the revealed word and it is the throne a throne of judgment amen by the grace of God so brother sister be ready it's going to happen in a way you don't think so I mean we think it's going to happen and what we're going to feel this we're gonna feel that no brother sister's not feelings it is faith it's not feelings it's faith you and there's not what you feel is what you're going to experience amen faith being made flesh in the bright faith be made flesh in a glorified body by the grace of God please be in prayer for one another please be on your guard stop and think good talk to the Lord concerning you know who you are and what's going on in your life know what I'm not becoming more spiritual am i becoming more
