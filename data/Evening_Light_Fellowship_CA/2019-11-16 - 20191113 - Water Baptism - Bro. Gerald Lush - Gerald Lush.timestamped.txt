[39:11] god bless amen thank God for the
[39:15] gathering well it's the promised forsake
[39:19] not the assembling of yourselves
[39:20] together not just period but much more
[39:24] as you see the Day approaching a man and
[39:27] where we see the Day approaching and we
[39:30] recognize the need for fellowship
[39:32] because the hours come when we won't
[39:34] happen
[39:35] amen as the prophet of God said that you
[39:38] won't even be allowed to pray for the
[39:40] sick that's right and he said maybe
[39:43] they'll shoot you well brother that's
[39:45] not hard to believe considering the
[39:47] world we're living in and what's going
[39:49] on and what's what's happening from day
[39:51] to day so we thank God for the grace of
[39:54] a new heaven and a new earth rather we
[39:57] want to get out of this one and into the
[39:59] kingdom of God amen where it's going to
[40:02] be absolutely perfect
[40:03] man just think there's not gonna be no
[40:05] but it comes to seeing it's not me no
[40:07] thoughts of him no nothing absolutely
[40:10] nothing negative everything's gonna be
[40:12] positive like it's gonna be real it's
[40:15] right now it's something that's hard for
[40:17] us to comprehend you know what it's
[40:19] going to be like but it's going to be
[40:21] what we want it's going to be what we're
[40:23] hungry for what we're thirsting for on
[40:25] the inside of the inside by the grace of
[40:28] Almighty God amen
[40:30] so let's keep believing let's keep
[40:32] trusting that brothers sister that we
[40:34] are not far from the kingdom amen
[40:37] you know one legis but like our Lord and
[40:40] I violated it our Lord Himself being
[40:44] here and just think he was only
[40:46] ministering for three three and a half
[40:48] years what would he feel if he was
[40:51] ministry for over 50 years
[40:53] well I tell you he is experiencing it
[40:56] he's feeling it in in the ministry all
[40:59] the way down through by the grace of God
[41:02] and he can identify with the ministry
[41:04] feel for the ministry because well when
[41:06] he was here as God he was God in flesh
[41:09] and he was there you know and oh brother
[41:14] it wasn't it wasn't this was bothering
[41:16] him you know he said he had nowhere to
[41:18] lay his head they didn't bother you know
[41:20] and maybe
[41:21] he didn't have much when it comes to for
[41:23] food and that's why the devil tempted
[41:25] him speak to speak and turn this to
[41:27] breath turn the stones to bread and he's
[41:31] a mansion I live by bread alone but by
[41:32] every word that proceeds out of the
[41:34] mouth of God
[41:35] he put the emphasis on the word so he
[41:38] didn't have what you and I have when it
[41:40] comes to this world the comforts of this
[41:42] world know but yet he he had that faith
[41:47] of the world the kingdom of God he knew
[41:49] what it was like and brother after three
[41:52] and a half years of ministry he wanted
[41:53] to go back yeah how much longer sir
[41:56] shall I be with this faithless
[41:58] generation a man I wonder if that
[42:01] bothers you a lack of faith you know
[42:05] where people are trusting this trusting
[42:07] this trusting this were they that
[42:09] trusting the Lord a man through the
[42:12] grace of God to his brother my oh my oh
[42:15] my
[42:16] well what would we feel like if if we
[42:19] were like the woman that that wanted to
[42:21] this one of that jesus said is not me to
[42:24] give the tribbles bread to dogs and so
[42:26] on well she said her dog eats from the
[42:28] crumbs she said that falls from the
[42:30] master's table well when she answered
[42:32] like that and that she was acknowledging
[42:34] you know I'm no more than a dog who here
[42:38] is going to acknowledge her a dog yeah
[42:41] who's going to humble yourself and
[42:42] consider yourself well Lord yeah I
[42:45] thought I am I'm just a dog you know and
[42:47] because of that faith Jesus there's
[42:50] earning her faith just think a man and
[42:53] he knew that she was real she really
[42:55] meant what she said and oh my and he
[42:58] said go he said your fate your
[43:01] daughter's is well he meant she was she
[43:03] wanted she wanted prayer for her
[43:05] daughter jesus healed her daughter right
[43:08] because of that faith amen
[43:10] so what would Jesus do because of your
[43:12] faith recognizing your faith looking at
[43:16] your faith what's he gonna do for you
[43:18] and me so brother I pray oh god help us
[43:20] that we'd have the same attitude yet
[43:22] because of a faithless generation a man
[43:26] so he said how long shall I be with you

[43:46] faith you want the atmosphere of faith a
[43:49] man atmosphere of divine love by the

[43:56] there's a couple of quotes I got here
[43:59] and and it's called don't take sides
[44:03] they met and it's in the message Christ
[44:07] is the mystery of God revealed amen
[44:10] so it's a very strong this is a strong
[44:14] message and that is a strong quote a man
[44:18] concerning what God is looking for in
[44:20] you and me when it comes to our attitude
[44:22] and it's our attitude toward one another
[44:25] amen so let's be on our guard so you can
[44:28] have a copy of that quote on your way
[44:30] over tonight and I was I was blessed
[44:32] when when in fellowship with our brother
[44:35] Jonathan Kerr let that he had mentioned
[44:37] that that he was also in reading the
[44:40] book Christ as the mystery of God
[44:42] revealed a man 1963 I said you're
[44:46] reading that oh yes he said it just
[44:48] recently he said I've been going through
[44:49] it he may praise the name of the Lord
[44:52] amen so let's let's pay attention to
[44:55] what he said and let's let's by the
[44:57] grace of God keep the right attitude and
[45:00] the right spirit yeah if you don't have
[45:03] it you won't make it I tell you you're
[45:06] not cutting you the bride is going to
[45:07] have a right attitude and a right spirit
[45:09] amen and if you don't have it here you
[45:12] won't be there to have it that's true so
[45:15] let's make our calling and our election
[45:17] sure by the grace of Almighty God amen
[45:20] so grace of God and again I got away
[45:26] from the thought I was on
[45:29] mr. bender a man ages taken is totally
[45:35] yes sit yeah
[45:37] sister sadly told me a man that she felt
[45:40] that age was taking the stone amen a
[45:44] tree said was coming to its head that's
[45:46] what we're usually experiencing is in
[45:48] our heads amen
[45:50] so anyway the Lord bless us and keep us
[45:53] in the faith brother
[45:54] by the grace pressing on as our Lord
[45:57] looking for eternity not time one the
[46:01] world you wants to spend more time here
[46:02] for it's get let's get let's get out of
[46:05] here
[46:05] amen if our Lord brother and knowing the
[46:09] love that he had and the compassion that
[46:11] he had yet he just wanted to go a man
[46:14] but he was Pro pushing pushing pushing
[46:16] as I say it he got to the place where he
[46:19] was his face was was toward Jerusalem a
[46:22] man was right he stopped he stopped the
[46:25] signs and the wonders he stopped healing
[46:27] this to stop doing this to stop doing
[46:28] that
[46:29] it's but he's he was set toward
[46:31] Jerusalem and we are set toward the New
[46:34] Jerusalem by the grace of God a man
[46:37] because he knew that what he would
[46:39] experience in Jerusalem he was going to
[46:41] Aysen
[46:42] the day when he would go from time to
[46:44] eternity amen so grace of God to us
[46:48] brother we want to get out of here by
[46:51] grace amen
[46:53] I believe that's what God is looking for
[46:57] in you and in me because we can't stand
[47:00] it no longer
[47:01] this lack of faith amen so the Lord
[47:05] bless you and also to bring greetings
[47:08] from our brother Jonathan and no doubt

[47:13] Columbia he's a long ways to go so God's
[47:16] grace to him and God bless him and he
[47:19] was absolutely shocked at the at the
[47:22] offering that we gave him and

[47:28] some of this back to you that's he said
[47:30] that's what I'm going to do he said I
[47:32] can't take this

[47:59] and I search for a job so the will of
[48:02] God be done for our brother Jonathan :
[48:05] amen and as they said I'd never dreamed
[48:07] maybe that brother Jonathan would come
[48:09] back this way again and with his family
[48:13] as I've said I preached to him when he
[48:16] was 2 years old now he's 40 years old
[48:18] preaching to us so god bless him a man
[48:22] and god bless the family amen
[48:27] for the not just his immediate family
[48:30] there but I'm referring to his mother
[48:32] and his and his and his brothers and his
[48:35] sisters amen
[48:37] grace so he thanks us for the offering
[48:43] and he expressed absolute shock over it
[48:45] and he wanted to give some of it back
[48:48] again but I told not to do amen yeah not
[48:53] many would do that no so I pray grace to
[48:57] our brother and also our brother John in
[49:01] Ottawa
[49:03] he sends his greetings to the Saints
[49:05] here and he said he said I will be at
[49:09] work tomorrow
[49:10] he said because they're waiting for me
[49:12] to set things up with them and he said
[49:15] he would update us later and he also
[49:18] sent greetings from his father in the
[49:23] Congo he said my father told me to greet
[49:25] you in the name of the Lord and he said
[49:28] to greet the church and he said he is
[49:31] very thankful he said considering what
[49:34] you did for me
[49:36] amen so I appreciate the help that we
[49:39] all gave him that we all stepped in to
[49:42] help our brother a man financially and
[49:45] of course spiritually as well so God
[49:47] blessed our brother John in Ottawa
[49:51] praise the Lord
[49:53] and also greetings from brother Chad he
[49:57] called this evening and he was on his
[49:59] way to Corner Brook and so we pray the
[50:02] grace of God with him he said he's not
[50:05] expecting the best weather out there and
[50:06] he said his it's very cold but he sends
[50:09] his greetings to the Saints here and
[50:14] he's praying for us and we'll pray for
[50:18] him that God give him a safe journey
[50:19] he's got a long ways to go amen and he
[50:23] said that his family is some of the
[50:24] members of his family is not well so we
[50:27] pray the grace of God to them amen
[50:29] again there's the promise amen that's
[50:35] right with His stripes we are eat by the
[50:39] grace of God so God help our sister Leah
[50:42] with those needs in the industry in the
[50:45] family and lay hands on them and
[50:47] proclaimed the promise amen because
[50:51] again this is this is hard there's a
[50:56] challenge to her faith as he said he
[51:00] said he can't believe in healing how can
[51:02] you believe for the rapture
[51:05] and there's too often too many is just
[51:07] just oh yeah that's right yeah yeah they
[51:10] go on it's just a thought in their head
[51:12] that's like brother Brown said
[51:14] concerning believing the message and he
[51:15] said he said but he said your your
[51:17] problem is he said you got a mental
[51:19] faith he said you got the message in
[51:22] your head but you don't have it in your
[51:24] heart and he brings that out also I
[51:27] think in this message Christ is the
[51:29] mystery of God revealed concerning
[51:31] mental faith versus spiritual faith
[51:34] intellectual faith versus spiritual
[51:37] faith and most today most believers
[51:39] today God got an intellectual faith but
[51:43] they don't have spiritual faith
[51:45] spiritual faith it's going to produce a
[51:47] spiritual life a man the life of Christ
[51:50] in their bright so it is it is serious
[51:56] just think about it don't don't don't
[51:58] just brush it off as just a quote just
[52:00] something the Provost said no no it's as
[52:03] God challenging our faith can we believe
[52:07] for healing or well it's a challenge are
[52:11] you believing for the rapture because
[52:15] why the rapture is a change of the body
[52:18] not just healing to the body it goes
[52:21] beyond that to a change a man we're
[52:24] going out of the out of the this body of
[52:26] flesh born in sin to a glorified body
[52:29] like is nuria's body how many here
[52:35] facing the challenge morning noon and
[52:37] night how many are claiming the problems
[52:42] not many God had mercy
[52:46] so that we're going to get beyond if the
[52:48] Provost said he said get beyond the
[52:50] intellectual faith he said in your head
[52:53] he said to a spiritual faith in your
[52:56] heart and many and he knew that in his
[53:00] preaching he knew that they were getting
[53:02] it in the head but they weren't getting
[53:03] it in their heart
[53:07] God have mercy that's why there's going
[53:10] to be very very few growing the rats
[53:12] they don't happy
[53:19] so grace of God be with us greetings to
[53:25] the Saints also from brother Chris and
[53:27] sister Ruth they were here and they
[53:29] enjoyed the services amen they were
[53:32] blessed amen
[53:33] so god bless brother Chris and sister
[53:37] Ruth amen
[53:38] so they are into the word and they
[53:41] walked the word amen
[53:43] so that's and brother why because fake
[53:46] off my hearing hearing by the word amen
[53:50] so grace of God that will get the word
[53:52] that God wants us to get and it's the
[53:55] word that'll give us the faith that
[53:57] pleases God and what is the faith that
[53:59] pleases God now really rapturing pay
[54:03] resurrection and rapturing fee amen
[54:06] that's what God is looking for in you
[54:08] and in me
[54:10] god help us also just to announce that
[54:16] by the grace of God I mentioned to
[54:21] brother Chad and he of course not
[54:24] surprising if I told you that he began
[54:27] to shout and scream and praise the Lord
[54:30] and I told him that brother Weiser I
[54:34] said is going to be baptized they said
[54:36] on Sunday morning I said 9 o'clock and
[54:40] he started to shout praise the Lord a
[54:44] man I don't know if anybody else heard
[54:46] of there but we heard him in here in in
[54:49] the city a man
[54:51] so being prayer for brother basil as we
[54:55] approach Sunday morning 9 o'clock at the
[54:58] tops of pong table some fine yeah tops
[55:05] that's upon troll yeah amen
[55:08] so and that's where we had the last
[55:11] baptism he meant right so be in prayer
[55:14] and as the Lord leads and that you that
[55:18] you will come and witness our brother
[55:20] Lazarus baptism they may have raised the
[55:24] name of the Lord it's been a long time
[55:27] since I was baptized in the name of the
[55:28] Lord Jesus Christ and we're going to
[55:31] deal with some of these things tonight
[55:32] and there's water baptism and we're
[55:34] going to hear the Prophet and he's just
[55:36] full remote maybe just over 20 minutes
[55:38] and he is ministering on water baptism
[55:42] and so we'll hear what he had to say
[55:44] concerning water baptism there's a lot
[55:47] of other things he gets into but we were
[55:49] bypassing that and just to get into what
[55:52] he said about water baptism and he'll be
[55:54] focusing on water baptism for about 20
[55:57] just over 20 minutes so be in prayer and
[56:00] I pray God God gave not only for our
[56:03] brother by earlier but for all of us we
[56:06] need to be reminded of these things what
[56:09] is the significance of our water baptism
[56:11] what does it mean amen
[56:13] why is God requiring water baptism amen
[56:17] it is a manifestation of our faith a man
[56:21] what what faith repentance is a
[56:24] manifestation of faith it's a reaction
[56:27] to fate water baptism is a reaction to
[56:29] fate and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:32] is God's response to our faith amen
[56:36] praise the name of the Lord so I trust
[56:38] by grace brother you what did you repent
[56:42] by faith did you get baptized in in the
[56:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ by faith
[56:46] was it real faith a man and did God
[56:50] respond to that and give you the baptism
[56:52] of the Holy Ghost
[56:54] do you ever it's a challenge do you have
[56:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[57:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost is Christ in
[57:03] me a man now Christ with me Christ
[57:08] it's Christ in me a man he said that day
[57:12] you'll know that I'm in the father the
[57:14] father and me I in you and you would be
[57:16] a man talk about a one brother through
[57:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and some
[57:23] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:25] that's according to their faith before
[57:27] they're baptized and others received the
[57:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost after they're
[57:32] baptized a man we know that there is in
[57:35] in the book of Acts chapter 10 there
[57:37] there's the Gentiles that they receive
[57:41] what Peter was preaching to them and man
[57:43] and God responded to their faith and
[57:46] they were baptized with the Holy Ghost a
[57:48] van and Peter said can any man forbid
[57:52] water that these should not be baptized
[57:54] because they've received the Holy Ghost
[57:56] as we did and so on and so by the grace
[58:00] of God and so they were they were
[58:03] baptized in water the Gentiles a mayor
[58:05] to God be the glory
[58:08] so brother maybe brothers brother wise
[58:11] who have got the Holy Ghost God knows a
[58:14] man maybe you received it before you got
[58:18] baptized maybe you were some of you
[58:19] received it after you got baptized but
[58:21] I'll tell you this without the baptism
[58:23] of the Holy Ghost you're lost why
[58:26] because God hasn't recognized your faith
[58:28] a man it is God the Provost said
[58:31] responding to your faith repent is your
[58:35] faith baptism is your faith amen your
[58:39] God looking at it see it's like George
[58:43] Beverly Shea when he came to the altar
[58:44] and repented and he and he just used
[58:48] there kneeling down on one knee and he
[58:51] had the other one up and he was up you
[58:54] know repenting and I think it was his
[58:57] father I believe it was or might have
[58:58] been his mother his father come by and
[59:00] says this get down on your knees too
[59:03] nice
[59:03] he says you're a sinner like everybody
[59:05] else and he and you need to repent a man
[59:08] oh yeah and he just felt you know I'm
[59:10] just gonna do this I'm gonna Lord
[59:12] forgive me yeah no he should get down
[59:14] and he's dead at home with yourself a
[59:16] man how many of us have humbled herself
[59:21] in repentance I remember crawling under
[59:31] the bed
[59:36] and got down to pray but I call them
[59:39] gonna be I should Oh God forgive me be
[59:44] merciful to me no amen Lord I'm
[59:48] repenting anymore please man
[59:52] grace of God yeah you repent you're
[59:56] really sorry for your scene yeah you're
[1:00:00] thanking God for what he did to redeem
[1:00:02] you through Christ as repentance again I
[1:00:06] like I like Billy Graham said remember
[1:00:09] that's the theme of this his ministry
[1:00:10] and the Ally's message was repentance
[1:00:13] and he said what is repentance
[1:00:17] he's repentance is he said you're going
[1:00:20] this way but then he said you hear the
[1:00:23] gospel you're here they got the message
[1:00:25] preached the word is preached and he
[1:00:27] says it and you're ordered to repent
[1:00:30] because you need Jesus as your Lord and
[1:00:31] Savior and then on the revelation of
[1:00:34] what he did he said you turn around if
[1:00:36] you're if you want to repent he's what
[1:00:39] you're doing if you turn around you're
[1:00:40] going this way but now you're going this
[1:00:42] way amen everything changes thoughts
[1:00:46] words and deeds amen your your your
[1:00:49] motives your your your desires
[1:00:52] objectives everything now you're not
[1:00:54] living for yourself no more you're
[1:00:56] living for Jesus not my real father
[1:00:59] don't be done amen repentance is
[1:01:02] changing your mind
[1:01:04] repentance is changing your thoughts you
[1:01:07] want his thoughts you want is will not
[1:01:10] your will amen praise the name of the
[1:01:13] Lord you're gonna do what God wants you
[1:01:15] to do when he wants you to do it where
[1:01:18] he wants you to do it and oh you want
[1:01:19] you to do that's repentance he meant it
[1:01:24] might be repentance that it brought our
[1:01:26] brother Elijah earlier oh yes amen
[1:01:33] doing what he wanted to do what God
[1:01:35] wanted him to do
[1:01:36] I believe that praise the Lord and
[1:01:38] praying that God responding to his fate
[1:01:41] gives him the Holy Ghost praise the Lord
[1:01:45] Alleluia so we're going to hear tonight
[1:01:47] the Prophet Minister for like I said
[1:01:50] just around 20 minutes over 20 minutes
[1:01:52] on water baptism and will share with you
[1:01:55] some Scripture but the round does go
[1:01:57] through a number of scriptures
[1:01:58] concerning a man and he begins don't get
[1:02:02] mixed up with without we're going to
[1:02:05] start a man and
[1:02:11] why I I skipped the previous paragraph
[1:02:14] but he went on and he highlighted this
[1:02:18] and then in the paragraph that we're
[1:02:19] going to start with its paragraph 38 and
[1:02:22] he said but to me he said I must be an
[1:02:26] old-fashioned Catholic
[1:02:29] well fast really old-fashioned and he
[1:02:34] now he's now saying Roman Catholic
[1:02:36] Catholic and he's not going back to the
[1:02:39] Roman Catholic Church he's going back to
[1:02:41] the to the Holy Ghost Church of the day
[1:02:44] of Pentecost so he said I must be an
[1:02:47] old-fashioned Catholic I must stay with
[1:02:50] what the early church did I must baptize
[1:02:53] according to the way the early church
[1:02:55] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:58] Christ and now should we try to keep
[1:03:01] that amen so understand he was referring
[1:03:06] to Roman Catholic by Catholic amen

[1:11:37] others that I understood not a man he
[1:11:43] was wise in the eyes of the world but
[1:11:46] not in the eyes of God and God brought
[1:11:49] him to this place of repentance a man to
[1:11:53] change his thoughts the changes idea to
[1:11:58] move him from self righteousness to the
[1:12:02] righteousness of God a man-eater
[1:12:05] therefore a by uttered that I understood
[1:12:08] not things too wonderful for me which I
[1:12:12] knew not he's acknowledging it he's
[1:12:15] repenting and he said here I beseech
[1:12:19] thee and I will speak I will demand of
[1:12:23] thee and declare thou unto me he said I
[1:12:26] have heard of thee by the hearing of the
[1:12:29] year but now mine I see thee wherefore I

[1:12:40] he humbled himself to repent and brother
[1:12:46] the preaching of the word the revelation
[1:12:48] of the word gives us the revelation that
[1:12:51] we are sinners born in sin shaped in
[1:12:55] iniquity come to the world speak in lies

[1:13:01] redeemer sinners saved by grace

[1:13:11] unmerited because we were born dance in
[1:13:14] a man and we had no desire just just to

[1:13:19] through the preaching of the word would
[1:13:21] change your nature a man
[1:13:26] to repentance praise the Lord he said
[1:13:30] now might I see at thee and where feiiow
[1:13:33] bore myself and repent god help us to
[1:13:38] have or ourselves o world i not Blake
[1:13:40] Joel oh yeah we're the same job most
[1:13:44] definitely a man we needed to get away
[1:13:47] from our self-righteousness to get the
[1:13:50] revelation of his righteousness so let's
[1:13:53] let's uh bore ourselves a man and he
[1:13:56] said and repent in dust and ashes a man
[1:14:01] he sought the Lord's forgiveness amen
[1:14:05] and yet just think right in there in the
[1:14:08] beginning of joke brother
[1:14:12] even he was very religious but not very
[1:14:15] spiritual a man he had a lot in his head
[1:14:19] but not in his heart and God wanted to
[1:14:21] deal with him conviction why because of
[1:14:25] the family that he had and Bible says
[1:14:30] that he was he was perfect and upright
[1:14:32] and one that feared God and aided evil
[1:14:36] yeah that's good but he saw that out
[1:14:42] there he saw God there he saw this there
[1:14:45] they evil there and all that but he
[1:14:47] didn't see it in here he didn't see it
[1:14:49] in himself self-righteousness and he
[1:14:53] said just think he said God loud all
[1:14:56] that to happen to Joel he said just to
[1:14:59] erase and wash away that little bit of
[1:15:02] self-righteousness what's he gonna do to
[1:15:06] you and what's he doing to you
[1:15:08] a man to get us to be humble oh he got
[1:15:13] job job humble himself he said I repent
[1:15:15] in dust and ashes a man I know where I
[1:15:18] come from he saw how we're going to go a
[1:15:20] man but yet he also knew he had a
[1:15:23] spiritual revelation not just physically
[1:15:25] yes spiritual and where he said with the
[1:15:27] sons of God shouted for joy the morning
[1:15:29] stars sang together and because God said
[1:15:32] where were you when I laid the
[1:15:33] foundations of the earth when this
[1:15:34] happened when that happened what job was
[1:15:36] there in the theophany a man you and I
[1:15:39] were there in TLC
[1:15:40] but and it says he feared God and
[1:15:44] eschewed evil but he didn't recognize
[1:15:47] the evil in his own flesh a man oh he
[1:15:51] offered sacrifices burnt offerings
[1:15:53] according to the number of his children
[1:15:55] for it is said it may be that my sons
[1:15:58] have sin curse God in their hearts and
[1:16:00] thus did Jobe continually a me but ah
[1:16:06] the devil come down so all but you're
[1:16:08] protecting him let me do this God said
[1:16:10] well go ahead he said but don't take his
[1:16:12] life now why would God permit the devil
[1:16:16] to do that because God saw something and
[1:16:18] joked at the rest didn't see a man God
[1:16:22] sees things in you then that others
[1:16:24] don't see and sometimes you don't see by
[1:16:27] God through the preacher of the word
[1:16:28] reduce it a man brings it out what for
[1:16:32] to keep us in a spirit of repentance I
[1:16:35] have repented and I repent and I repent
[1:16:38] you got the attitude of repentance
[1:16:40] humble yourself in the presence of God
[1:16:43] and job said I abhorred myself and
[1:16:46] repent in dust and ashes amen turn with
[1:16:53] me to the book of Acts and we'll go into
[1:16:55] the message of the Prophet we'll go back
[1:16:59] to chapter 2
[1:17:06] and really we could go on for many hours
[1:17:10] just preaching on this when it comes to
[1:17:14] the book of Acts and the book of John
[1:17:16] and other scriptures a man concerning
[1:17:20] repentance brother the Jews felt only
[1:17:28] could do all they had to do was offer
[1:17:30] sacrifices offer this sacrifice offer
[1:17:33] that sacrifice do this then to keep
[1:17:35] their Sabbath and so on no they were
[1:17:38] still sinners and right and and the
[1:17:41] blood of the Lamb sacrifice only covered
[1:17:44] their scene it never took it away but
[1:17:46] just think of what the blood of the Lamb
[1:17:49] of God did with your sin it washed it
[1:17:53] away and it was went into the sea of
[1:17:57] forgetfulness what God doesn't remember
[1:18:01] it God doesn't see it no more as if you
[1:18:04] really got that true faith and then
[1:18:07] you're you really repented and you're
[1:18:09] reborn again you're a new creature in
[1:18:11] Christ he looks down a sees his son and
[1:18:13] his daughter a man you don't see no sin
[1:18:16] and no man can lay a charge against you
[1:18:19] I pray we got that faith amen
[1:18:25] we got that relationship with the Lord
[1:18:28] by the grace of God listen and in Acts
[1:18:33] chapter 2 that's read from verse 37 and
[1:18:40] when they heard this Peter had preached
[1:18:43] the word to them they were pricked in
[1:18:46] their heart and said unto Peter and to
[1:18:49] the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:18:52] brethren what shall we do they were
[1:18:56] convicted a man concerning the Messiah
[1:19:02] convicted concerning his death his
[1:19:05] burial and his resurrection they wanted
[1:19:10] to identify with him they said what
[1:19:13] shall we do and then Peter said unto
[1:19:15] them repent be sorry for what you
[1:19:20] amen and be baptized every one of you in
[1:19:26] the name not names in the name of Jesus
[1:19:31] Christ for the remission of sins amen
[1:19:36] and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:46] where was it yeah that's it receive the
[1:19:50] gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise
[1:19:53] is unto you and under your children and
[1:19:56] all that are afar off even as many as
[1:19:59] the Lord our God shall call and with
[1:20:02] many other words did he testify and
[1:20:05] exhort saying save yourself from this on
[1:20:08] toward generation and then they that
[1:20:10] gladly received his word were baptized
[1:20:12] and the same day they were added unto
[1:20:15] them about 3,000 Souls amen we thank God
[1:20:20] for two or three now not 3,000 braise
[1:20:23] the Lord and again the miss
[1:20:26] understanding of the water baptism
[1:20:28] concerning they go baptized in the name
[1:20:30] of the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:20:32] Holy Ghost Jesus said go teach to
[1:20:35] baptize in the name of the Father and of
[1:20:36] the Son and of the Holy Ghost but I was
[1:20:38] only one name amen and the Prophet
[1:20:41] brings this out in this in these few
[1:20:43] minutes that he's got a ministry amen
[1:20:46] so it's about but just over 20 minutes
[1:20:48] amen concerning baptism and he explains
[1:20:51] every every detail and he gives
[1:20:53] scripture after scripture after
[1:20:54] scripture amen so listen don't just
[1:20:57] assume because I've been baptized in the
[1:20:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't
[1:21:01] need to hear it we do need to hear it
[1:21:02] and thank God for the understanding and
[1:21:05] the revelation amen
[1:21:07] Lord bless you you may be seated
[1:21:14] amen but to me I must be an
[1:21:28] old-fashioned Catholic I'm a stable
[1:21:40] I must be an old-fashioned Catholic i'ma
[1:21:44] stay with what the early church did and
[1:21:47] I must baptize according to the way the
[1:21:51] early church baptized in the name of the
[1:21:54] Lord Jesus Christ and now we try to keep
[1:21:59] that now that I might say this in
[1:22:02] Matthew 28:19 jesus said go ye therefore
[1:22:07] teach all nations baptizing them into
[1:22:10] the name of the Father and of the Son
[1:22:13] and all the Holy Ghost
[1:22:16] bhana one of them he never said in the
[1:22:20] name of the Father in the name of the
[1:22:22] son in the name of the Holy Ghost he
[1:22:24] said in the name Sanger great scholars
[1:22:29] like Scofield knows in the original
[1:22:32] Greek all in in the all translations
[1:22:36] it's in the name not names or in the
[1:22:41] name of the Father in the name of the
[1:22:42] son it's in the name of Father Son and
[1:22:45] Holy Ghost well father is not a name
[1:22:50] neither is Sunnat II and neither is Holy
[1:22:54] Ghost a name it's titles that goes to
[1:22:57] one name see there's one name that if
[1:23:02] the revelation that we are trying to
[1:23:06] bring to you surely must have been the
[1:23:08] same revelation that the Apostles had
[1:23:10] when they stood by listen at him give
[1:23:13] that Commission someone said well I
[1:23:14] don't care what the Apostles done Jesus
[1:23:17] said this if the Apostles disobeyed and
[1:23:20] then the Scriptures are wrong you have
[1:23:23] to make the Scriptures perfect are there
[1:23:25] not nothing it's every word right oh
[1:23:27] it's none of it right I don't know which
[1:23:29] would be right if at all isn't right if
[1:23:32] part of it isn't inspired than the rest
[1:23:34] of it might not be but there's not a
[1:23:36] contradiction in the scriptures
[1:23:38] so if Peter said repent and be baptized
[1:23:42] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:23:44] Christ and all after that was baptized
[1:23:46] the name of Jesus Christ and Jesus said
[1:23:50] go baptize the name of father son Holy
[1:23:52] Ghost that's a lie
[1:23:54] contradiction looks like but it isn't if
[1:23:57] you just know remember the scriptures
[1:23:59] are hid from the eyes of the wise and
[1:24:01] students did you know that and to be
[1:24:05] revealed the Scriptures doesn't
[1:24:07] contradicts itself it only declares
[1:24:10] itself now if you turn back if you're
[1:24:15] reading a story like you said John and
[1:24:17] Mary live happy ever after as some of
[1:24:21] you we all guilty of reading stories and
[1:24:24] if you didn't know who John and Mary was
[1:24:26] the only thing you could do is turn back
[1:24:29] to the first book and read through and
[1:24:31] find out who John and Mary was if Jesus
[1:24:34] commanded them to be baptized in the
[1:24:36] name of the Father Son Holy Ghost and
[1:24:38] father's not a name and Sons not a name
[1:24:40] and Holy Ghost is not a name we better
[1:24:43] go back and find out who Father Son and
[1:24:46] Holy Ghost is and what his name is so if
[1:24:49] you would turn with me to the first
[1:24:50] chapter of Matthew like you would have
[1:24:52] any book it said now the give me the
[1:24:54] geologist it said now the birth of Jesus
[1:24:57] Christ is on this wise when his mother
[1:25:00] Mary was espoused to Joseph engaged
[1:25:05] otherwise now I want to show you how
[1:25:08] look we're going to say this is the son
[1:25:10] Jesus this is the father this is the
[1:25:14] Holy Ghost now anybody knows and Jesus
[1:25:17] said that God was his father you believe
[1:25:19] that we'd have to the father of Jesus
[1:25:24] Christ was God I'm quoting scripture
[1:25:26] Matthew 1:18 the birth of Jesus Christ
[1:25:30] was on this one when his mother Mary was
[1:25:33] espoused to Joseph before she they came
[1:25:37] together she was found with the child of
[1:25:39] the Holy Ghost and which one of these is
[1:25:45] his father
[1:25:48] and she shall bring forth the child they
[1:25:52] shall call his name Jesus notice she was
[1:25:56] and when Joseph her husband being a just
[1:25:59] man not willingly to make her a public
[1:26:01] example was minded to put it away
[1:26:04] privately on this one but when he
[1:26:07] thought on these things behold the angel
[1:26:09] of the Lord appeared to him in a dream
[1:26:10] in Saint Joseph thou son of David fear
[1:26:16] not to take unto thee thy wife Mary thy
[1:26:19] wife for that which is conceived in her
[1:26:21] is of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:25] but how could God be his father if the
[1:26:28] Holy Ghost is his father you'd have two
[1:26:32] fathers and what kind of a child would
[1:26:35] he be there's no tooth the Holy Ghost
[1:26:38] that God is the same thing see and she
[1:26:43] shall bring forth a son and they shall
[1:26:47] call his name Jesus all this was done
[1:26:51] that it might be fulfilled which spoke
[1:26:53] to the Lord by the Prophet saying a
[1:26:55] virgin shall conceive and bear a child
[1:26:57] and he shall be called a manual which is
[1:27:01] why God with us now here's the son on
[1:27:08] the day of his baptizing in Jordan John
[1:27:12] Barrow records seen the Spirit of God
[1:27:13] like a dove coming and dwelling on him
[1:27:17] jesus said it's not me to do if the
[1:27:19] works it's my father that dwelleth in me
[1:27:21] now Father Son and Holy Ghost has one
[1:27:27] name then three titles and what did the
[1:27:30] Bible say that name was Jesus so that
[1:27:34] must have been the revelation that the
[1:27:36] Apostles had for that's the way they
[1:27:38] baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost is
[1:27:42] not a name none of them redeems the name
[1:27:46] of the Father Son Holy Ghost it was the
[1:27:48] Lord Jesus Christ that's the name of the
[1:27:51] Father Son Holy Ghost now I shall read
[1:27:54] some scriptures just before we
[1:27:56] I want to read first on the first
[1:28:00] occasion for the water baptism and
[1:28:02] that's found in acts the second chapter
[1:28:05] Peter at the day of Pentecost
[1:28:07] he'd been preaching and when they heard
[1:28:10] this they were pricked in their heart
[1:28:11] and said to Peter and the rest of the
[1:28:13] Apostles men and brethren what shall we
[1:28:16] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[1:28:19] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:28:22] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:28:24] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:28:26] the Holy Ghost for the promises in the
[1:28:29] you and to your children for them as far
[1:28:30] off even as many as the Lord our God
[1:28:32] shall call then the next time we have
[1:28:35] baptism recorded is from Philip two days
[1:28:39] after each what down to sumerians and
[1:28:41] with Jews and then when there's only
[1:28:45] three tribes of people in the earth
[1:28:47] that's ham Shem and Japheth people Jews
[1:28:50] Gentiles and helped you and Gentiles
[1:28:53] Samaritan when Philip went out and
[1:28:55] preached to the Samaritans here's what
[1:28:56] taking place this one Simon the sorcerer
[1:29:00] was bewitching people by sorcery but
[1:29:02] when they believed Philip preaching the
[1:29:06] things pertaining to the kingdom of God
[1:29:08] in the name of Jesus Christ they were
[1:29:11] baptized both man and women
[1:29:14] the next time baptism is spoke of is
[1:29:17] found in acts 10:44 248 at the house of
[1:29:23] Cornelius the Gentile there's the Jews
[1:29:26] at Jerusalem Philip that Samaria and
[1:29:29] here's Peter with the Gentile and while
[1:29:33] Peter yet spake these words the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost fell on them which heard the word
[1:29:37] and they are the circumcision Jew which
[1:29:41] bully he were astonished as many as came
[1:29:42] that Peter because on the Gentiles was
[1:29:45] also poured out the gift of the Holy
[1:29:47] Ghost for they heard them speak with
[1:29:50] tongues and magnify God that answer
[1:29:52] Peter can a man forbid water that these
[1:29:55] should not be baptized
[1:30:00] and he commanded them who has received
[1:30:03] the Holy Ghost as well as we and he
[1:30:06] commanded them to be baptized in the
[1:30:08] name of the Lord he prayed for them the
[1:30:12] next time baptism is spoke of is an acts
[1:30:15] 19 where they come up on the disciples
[1:30:19] of John this is Paul
[1:30:22] now this enclosed acts 19 and it came to
[1:30:27] pass while Apollo's is at carrieth Paul
[1:30:30] having passed through the upper coast of
[1:30:32] Ephesus he finds certain disciples and
[1:30:34] he said unto them I watched they were
[1:30:36] disciples they were believers Christians
[1:30:38] he said unto them have you received the
[1:30:41] Holy Ghost since you believed and they
[1:30:46] said unto Him we have not so much as
[1:30:47] heard whether there would be any Holy
[1:30:48] Ghost listen what he is listen to this
[1:30:52] essential question of this apostle an
[1:30:56] and he said unto them until what then
[1:31:00] were you baptized and they said unto Him
[1:31:04] under John's baptism now I had imagined
[1:31:06] this morning
[1:31:07] if either any of us have been baptized
[1:31:10] by the same man that baptized Jesus
[1:31:13] Christ we think our baptisms pretty well
[1:31:16] secured when you think so but you're as
[1:31:19] Paul says it isn't in the same hole of
[1:31:23] water by the same man that baptized our
[1:31:26] Lord
[1:31:26] Paul condemns that baptism now because
[1:31:31] it wasn't in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:33] now listen
[1:31:36] and he said until what then were you
[1:31:39] baptized now if you want to look at up
[1:31:41] in the Greek he said how was your
[1:31:42] baptized see and they said unto Him
[1:31:45] under John's baptism then said paul john
[1:31:48] barely baptized on the baptism of
[1:31:51] repentance saying unto the people that
[1:31:53] they should believe on him that's come
[1:31:55] that is on jesus christ
[1:31:58] notice this same group had been baptized
[1:32:01] in the Jordan with Jesus Christ when
[1:32:04] they heard this they were rebaptised
[1:32:07] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:32:11] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:12] pauling his hands upon them the Holy
[1:32:15] Ghost came on them and they spake with
[1:32:17] tongues and prophesied now the Saint
[1:32:22] Paul says here in the book of Galatians
[1:32:25] this is why hang to it Galatians the
[1:32:28] first chapter and the eighth verse
[1:32:30] listen I'm going to get this at the
[1:32:34] sixth verse speaking to the Galatians
[1:32:37] I'm marvelous she'd be so soon removed
[1:32:39] from him that called you unto grace of
[1:32:42] Christ unto another gospel which is not
[1:32:46] another but there be some that trouble
[1:32:48] you and prevent the gospel of Christ but
[1:32:52] though we are an angel from heaven
[1:32:56] there would be priests Pope preacher
[1:33:00] whatever it might be
[1:33:01] though we are angel from heaven preach
[1:33:03] any other gospel unto you than that
[1:33:08] which we have preached unto you let him
[1:33:10] be accursed and added and we said before
[1:33:17] so now I say again if any man preach any
[1:33:22] other gospel unto you than that which
[1:33:25] you have received let him be accursed if
[1:33:32] we shall take one word away from the
[1:33:34] Bible revelations 21 or 22 and or add
[1:33:38] one thing to it knowingly
[1:33:41] the same will be taken out of the book
[1:33:43] of life for us
[1:33:45] therefore it is my convictions know
[1:33:49] disregarding two people who wants to be
[1:33:51] sprinkled poured or immersed and father
[1:33:54] son Holy Ghost that's deliberately up to
[1:33:57] you my dear brother sister I will not
[1:34:00] disagree with you on this you're God's
[1:34:03] servant but to me I must be faithful and
[1:34:06] true to the Bible therefore Paul
[1:34:10] commanded people that had been baptized
[1:34:13] some other way besides the name of Jesus
[1:34:15] Christ and constrain them to come and D
[1:34:18] read
[1:34:19] Tai's again in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:21] to preach that same gospel I've got to
[1:34:25] do the same thing the restraining to
[1:34:28] persuade people don't never leave your
[1:34:32] church stay with your pastor do
[1:34:35] everything you can in your own local
[1:34:36] church but follow the Bible instructions
[1:34:41] therefore we believe this morning that
[1:34:45] Jesus is coming and when I stand that
[1:34:49] day now maybe the creed book might be
[1:34:51] all right
[1:34:52] I can't disregarded it might be all
[1:34:54] right but and maybe the Catholic Church
[1:34:57] does have that authority I don't know
[1:35:00] and if you're Catholic Chur and you
[1:35:03] think your church has that authority
[1:35:05] this they say is their original book so
[1:35:09] will I take what some modern man said
[1:35:11] when Christ the founder of your church
[1:35:13] commissioned this when your first pope
[1:35:16] commissioned this let's follow the Bible
[1:35:21] where I believe that is the truth now
[1:35:24] while we are preparing I want those who
[1:35:26] are to be baptized to come forward and
[1:35:28] stand up here so we can show to the
[1:35:31] world that we believe that Jesus living
[1:35:34] he loved us dying he saved us buried he
[1:35:38] carried our sins far away rising he
[1:35:40] justified freely forever believe someday
[1:35:44] he's coming
[1:35:45] waiting for that glorious day and you're
[1:35:47] coming this morning to confess that
[1:35:50] that's sin that I've preached about this
[1:35:53] morning the sins of the world has been
[1:35:56] condemned and killed and you no more
[1:36:00] serve it to that thing but it's dead and
[1:36:04] you're coming to be buried in the name
[1:36:08] of him who died for you and kill sin for
[1:36:12] you and rose for your justification and
[1:36:15] you are complete in him not in no church
[1:36:19] not in the random Tabernacle not an
[1:36:21] association but you are complete and
[1:36:24] safe in Jesus Christ let us pray Lord
[1:36:29] this sometimes seems to be hard for I
[1:36:34] know that I have precious French air of
[1:36:38] the Catholic faith and some of the
[1:36:41] Wesleyan Methodist and no doubt many of
[1:36:45] the Trinitarian extreme we believe Lord
[1:36:50] that Father Son and Holy Ghost is the
[1:36:53] same God but three offices that the God
[1:36:57] of heaven served in one time for the
[1:37:00] Jews in the Fatherhood once then flesh
[1:37:03] as the sonship and now in the Holy Ghost
[1:37:07] in the church not three gods we do not
[1:37:11] believe father or you cannot deny your
[1:37:14] own Word when there's no other God
[1:37:16] except you you said I'm the LORD thy God
[1:37:19] thou shalt have no other gods and we
[1:37:22] believe Lord that this one true God
[1:37:26] lived in three different dispensations
[1:37:30] under the law under the Christian
[1:37:34] dispensation when crisis on earth in a
[1:37:37] body of flesh that was born of the
[1:37:38] Virgin Mary died rose again and has
[1:37:42] redeemed us the church and now in the
[1:37:45] form of the Holy Ghost the witness of
[1:37:49] the resurrection lives in our lives
[1:37:51] forgive us of our sins now pray that
[1:37:55] you'll bless every person here
[1:37:57] regardless of church affiliations or
[1:38:00] denomination there are human beings that
[1:38:03] live and eat and love and want to go to
[1:38:06] heaven they're like us all and we we are
[1:38:12] we are not trying to dishonor anything
[1:38:16] or any work that anybody has done in
[1:38:18] your name but we're only trying to give
[1:38:22] a statement of the hope that lies within
[1:38:25] us based upon thy word thy Word is truth
[1:38:32] so we pray father that if there be some
[1:38:35] here that you would desire
[1:38:37] to have them rebaptised
[1:38:40] let them come forward and those who have
[1:38:44] never made a Christian confession that's
[1:38:46] coming out to be baptized in the name of
[1:38:49] the risen Lord what a beautiful time to
[1:38:52] do it only Easter morning
[1:38:54] what makes baptisms because there was an
[1:38:58] Easter grant Lord that whosoever shall
[1:39:02] come may be blessed and fill with the
[1:39:05] Holy Spirit as they are desiring soul or
[1:39:08] we asked it in Jesus name Amen amen now
[1:39:13] those that have come for baptism would
[1:39:16] you just stand to your feet so we could
[1:39:19] get a general conception of who is to be
[1:39:21] baptized there will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[1:39:28] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 of them
[1:39:34] all right I got yours back there sister
[1:39:36] in the bank now I wished you all would
[1:39:40] if you would walk right barber here just
[1:39:42] a moment would you would you play for us
[1:39:45] sister I can understand your calling
[1:39:48] quietly as you can slowly
[1:39:57] and as I see coming down the line
[1:39:59] knowing the people's I'll see people
[1:40:01] from out of town from churches that
[1:40:07] would really think I was just a little
[1:40:11] bit off of line by baptizing people you
[1:40:14] move right out this way a little bit
[1:40:15] brother saw these back here about
[1:40:18] baptizing them in the name of the Lord
[1:40:20] Jesus but I have truly tried to make it
[1:40:25] as clear as I know how to make it
[1:40:37] now this is a nice group of people I
[1:40:40] wish I'll turn right around to the
[1:40:42] audience like this these people standing
[1:40:48] here are coming up on the basis that
[1:40:51] they believe that Jesus Christ is the
[1:40:54] son of God that he was suffered under
[1:40:57] Pontius Pilate and was crucified on
[1:41:01] Calvary died buried rose the third day
[1:41:06] triumph over death hell and the grave
[1:41:08] and ascended up on high setting at the
[1:41:11] right hand of the Majesty to make
[1:41:12] intercessions upon their confession they
[1:41:15] have now shown to you that they believe
[1:41:19] this solemnly with all their heart and
[1:41:21] have confessed their sins before God and
[1:41:24] are convinced that Jesus is the Son of
[1:41:27] God and has accepted him as personal
[1:41:30] Savior
[1:41:31] if that be so raise your hands all of
[1:41:33] you stand around like that it's raised
[1:41:37] there for some of them has been
[1:41:40] Christians for a long time some of those
[1:41:43] have been baptized in the name of the
[1:41:45] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[1:41:47] Ghost
[1:41:48] and they are convinced today that that
[1:41:52] the scripture and Apostolic way of
[1:41:55] baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:58] Christ and they have come believing this
[1:42:01] and have accepted it and embracing this
[1:42:04] and will think that that's the truth
[1:42:08] because the scripture teaches it if such
[1:42:10] a standing in the line would you raise
[1:42:11] your hands you who have been baptized
[1:42:14] before and will in the name of the
[1:42:17] Father Son Holy Ghost and now believe in
[1:42:19] the Lord Jesus Christ thank you O Lord
[1:42:23] creator of heavens and earth altar of
[1:42:26] everlasting life here stands man women
[1:42:29] boys and girls they have to lead here to
[1:42:33] this Easter tomb Oh God
[1:42:39] someday maybe this day yet I've got to
[1:42:43] stand with an at the judgment bar
[1:42:46] and when the great boss comes forward in
[1:42:50] his great kingly garments as a minister
[1:42:57] of the gospel I've got to stand before
[1:42:59] this open Bible and give an account for
[1:43:02] what I've talked to people ah dread Lord
[1:43:07] and fear godly fear unless I should
[1:43:12] teach something that was wrong and then
[1:43:15] all that I've done would be thrown away
[1:43:20] or you said till heavens and earth pass
[1:43:23] away not one word of mind shall pass
[1:43:26] away and you have said let all man's
[1:43:31] word be wrong and yours be right
[1:43:34] therefore Lord I am as the servant of
[1:43:37] yours and days gone by constraining them
[1:43:40] to come and be rebaptised again that I
[1:43:45] might say that at that day that I have
[1:43:47] done a hole that I don't know how to do
[1:43:50] the face of criticisms and want more but
[1:43:54] tried to live true to this Bible grant
[1:43:58] Lord if their life will be enriched and
[1:44:00] blessed and maybe they won't for nothing
[1:44:03] may the Holy Ghost come upon each of
[1:44:06] them that has not received him as yet
[1:44:08] may this be a resurrecting time that
[1:44:12] this group of people will be resurrected
[1:44:14] and this church will be charged with the
[1:44:17] power of the resurrected Jesus may we go
[1:44:23] from this building today saying good
[1:44:25] night our hearts burn within us as he
[1:44:28] talked to us along the road grandfather
[1:44:31] is your servant but these material
[1:44:33] things are we go far burn out to obey
[1:44:36] your Commandments in the name of Jesus
[1:44:38] Christ your son Amy
[1:44:50] a man
[1:44:56] clearly explained I try to clearly
[1:45:00] believe it concerning water baptism that
[1:45:05] we're going back as he said I'm an
[1:45:07] old-fashioned Catholic and an old-time
[1:45:11] Catholic to go back not to when the
[1:45:14] Catholic Church started to go back to
[1:45:15] before the Catholic Church started
[1:45:17] because that's spoken of again as
[1:45:20] prophesied in the in the book of in the
[1:45:23] book of revelations concerning the
[1:45:25] church ages amen because God was
[1:45:29] discerning that spirit even in the first
[1:45:32] church age and have referred to as the
[1:45:34] deeds of the Nicolaitans a man there was
[1:45:38] a spirit on the move a man too to
[1:45:42] overcome that the control and leadership
[1:45:45] of the Holy Spirit amen
[1:45:47] there was another spirit to conquer the
[1:45:49] laity a man chose to put man in charge
[1:45:52] to put the priesthood in church to put a
[1:45:54] church in charge and you had to be
[1:45:57] subjected to that leadership a man but
[1:46:00] he said you hate those deeds of the
[1:46:02] Nicolaitans he said which I also ate but
[1:46:06] that spirit came more and more in any
[1:46:09] way and went from his just the deeds of
[1:46:11] the Nicolaitans eventually it became a
[1:46:13] doctrine of the Nicolaitans so we have
[1:46:17] traced that down through the church ages
[1:46:19] it was this it was this then it became a
[1:46:21] doctrine and then it came under yeah I
[1:46:25] have a few things against thee because
[1:46:27] thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which
[1:46:30] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[1:46:32] and to seduce my servants and to commit
[1:46:36] fornication to eat things sacrificed
[1:46:38] unto idols and what was it it was the
[1:46:42] Catholic Church coming more and more in
[1:46:43] control it was man coming more and more
[1:46:46] in control it was orga they were it was
[1:46:48] organized religion amen and they were
[1:46:50] going again from the spiritual
[1:46:52] revelation to going back to the
[1:46:54] intellectual knowledge of the word in
[1:46:56] their heads
[1:46:57] amen and and the problem God I like this
[1:47:00] in the revelation of the seven Church
[1:47:02] ages
[1:47:03] beginning with the light of the revealed
[1:47:05] word on the day of Pentecost
[1:47:07] but the deeds of the Nicolaitans came
[1:47:08] they were they were there and this is
[1:47:11] what this dark little bit of darkness is
[1:47:13] an indication of the deeds from their
[1:47:15] claims are going on to a doctrine of the
[1:47:17] Nicolaitans till eventually it became an
[1:47:20] organized religion controlling a man
[1:47:23] controlling faith controlling religion a
[1:47:26] man but again there was always an a
[1:47:28] there's always a few that didn't that
[1:47:30] didn't go under them and stay with them
[1:47:32] or come under their influence but the
[1:47:35] majority they'd eventually come under
[1:47:36] their influence and it was organized
[1:47:38] religion but God promised that he was
[1:47:41] going to restore and brother in this
[1:47:43] organized religion there was something
[1:47:44] like almost 68 million that were
[1:47:47] martyred and they laid down their lives
[1:47:49] for the truth a man that they wouldn't
[1:47:52] they wouldn't go along with it they
[1:47:53] wouldn't stay with it no they're going
[1:47:54] to stay with the word stay with the
[1:47:56] revelation that everything started with
[1:47:58] on the day of Pentecost and then brother
[1:48:01] but again what did they wonderful things
[1:48:04] they change was was one of apt ISM a man
[1:48:07] and it went from of course eventually it
[1:48:11] went from adult baptism to - it to
[1:48:14] children baptizing babies dedicating
[1:48:17] yeah baptizing babies they were just
[1:48:19] pulled in water on their foreheads I've
[1:48:21] seen that done now not only in the
[1:48:23] Catholic Church and there are other
[1:48:24] churches as well amen
[1:48:27] but it became it became adding a
[1:48:30] denomination organized religion but
[1:48:32] there's always a few in every age that
[1:48:34] didn't didn't go along with their state
[1:48:36] away from it and many as I said laid
[1:48:38] down their lives they died for it amen
[1:48:41] they die they give up their land and
[1:48:44] they heard that ours coming again amen
[1:48:47] but the bride is not going to be not
[1:48:49] going to experience that she won't be so
[1:48:51] she wants off for that he's gonna take
[1:48:53] the bride out he promised that amen but
[1:48:56] there they're going to be those again
[1:48:58] mother been referred to them as the
[1:49:00] foolish virgins they're virgins but
[1:49:02] they're foolish a man and they and they
[1:49:05] lack the anointing of the Holy Ghost he
[1:49:08] meant because there did you went on with
[1:49:10] with religion religion religion but
[1:49:12] again they had an experience because he
[1:49:15] said they were virgins they were
[1:49:16] separated they were virgins a man and of
[1:49:20] course when they did
[1:49:22] they realize all the rapture well it
[1:49:25] already happened they didn't know it
[1:49:27] amen because they never had the extra
[1:49:29] lender into it I trust we got the extra
[1:49:33] please may you tell them make your call
[1:49:36] and election sure make your rapture
[1:49:38] short amen
[1:49:40] make sure that your your you're in the
[1:49:42] process to be changed from time to
[1:49:45] eternity a man and brother it's the HC
[1:49:48] anointing
[1:49:49] it's the anointing that God is giving us
[1:49:51] through the revealed word because God
[1:49:54] restored what was lost down through the
[1:49:57] dark ages and what was changed from from
[1:50:00] the the Word of God by the Holy Ghost
[1:50:01] and just changed to a denominational
[1:50:04] Creed and and a false baptism and a
[1:50:07] false this and the false that and then
[1:50:09] they they just did away with the name
[1:50:10] and they said just repent and be
[1:50:12] baptized in the name of the Father and
[1:50:14] of the Son and of the Holy Ghost amen oh
[1:50:17] yeah they put the name out they did away
[1:50:21] with the name but God said he was going
[1:50:23] to restore and bring it back again
[1:50:25] and that's exactly the truth and brother
[1:50:28] been buddy in the restoration of course
[1:50:30] there was Luther and Wesley and then of
[1:50:32] course the Pentecostal age and so on and
[1:50:35] with the penico with the Pentecostal age
[1:50:38] there was baptism but again they stayed
[1:50:41] with the titles Father Son and Holy
[1:50:44] Ghost I was in 1965 I was baptized in
[1:50:49] the Pentecostal church and they baptize
[1:50:52] me in the name of the Father and of the
[1:50:53] Son and of the Holy Ghost now and it was
[1:50:57] again it was in June of 66 that I got
[1:51:01] the revelation of the name and in July
[1:51:05] brother Bill agate baptized me in the
[1:51:07] river in Bashar Falls he said according
[1:51:10] to the he said Lord according to your
[1:51:12] command he said to baptize in the name
[1:51:16] of the Father and of the Son and of the
[1:51:18] Holy Ghost I baptized my brother in the
[1:51:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:51:24] because this same Jesus was made both
[1:51:27] Lord and Christ amen to identify that it
[1:51:31] was it was God amen it was not just Oh
[1:51:36] this is just Jesus no but it was God in
[1:51:38] Christ and it was the Holy Ghost in
[1:51:40] Christ by the grace of God
[1:51:42] remember he laid down his life but he
[1:51:45] picked it up again to share the the Holy
[1:51:48] Ghost with you and me a man he come back
[1:51:51] praise the name
[1:51:52] he said I'll not leave you comfortless I
[1:51:54] will come to you see again like I said
[1:51:57] that Pentecostal pastor that I said some
[1:52:00] books to any and he just sent back the
[1:52:03] books and and he said oh he said you
[1:52:06] don't believe the Trinity he said but he
[1:52:08] said read there he said there is a
[1:52:10] Trinity I Jesus I will pray the father -
[1:52:14] he said that he was saying you a
[1:52:16] comforter the Holy Ghost and that's the
[1:52:21] only scripture he gave me and like I
[1:52:23] told you I were I wrote back and I said
[1:52:25] brother you need to go on down and read
[1:52:27] a few more verses that same chapter
[1:52:29] Jesus said I will not leave you
[1:52:33] comfortless I will come to you I said
[1:52:37] who's the comforter is Jesus and he said
[1:52:40] in that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:52:42] father the father and me I in you and
[1:52:44] you would me so I said it's not three
[1:52:46] he's all one by the grace of God by the
[1:52:49] anointing of the Holy Ghost a man the
[1:52:51] father came to reveal himself in the son
[1:52:55] amen and then the son is revealing God
[1:52:59] through the Holy Ghost in the right and
[1:53:02] any sons and daughters praise the Lord
[1:53:06] but again God God God began to restore
[1:53:09] back that which was lost during the dark
[1:53:12] ages amen he got Luther out of it but
[1:53:15] then they organised and he got to
[1:53:17] Methodist out of it then they organized
[1:53:19] then they went on to others and others
[1:53:21] and others and they organized and so on
[1:53:23] - Bonnie come with the Pentecostals and
[1:53:25] they organized and even the UPC the
[1:53:28] United Pentecostals they organized come
[1:53:31] denominational any man and they wouldn't
[1:53:34] receive when God come on the scene with
[1:53:35] the revealed word they all turned it
[1:53:38] down they met they just didn't didn't
[1:53:42] recognize what God was doing or they
[1:53:44] recognize what God did in the end of apt
[1:53:47] ISM of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:53:48] Pentecostal
[1:53:50] what God did and Luthor's revival
[1:53:51] Wesley's revival yeah but at the third
[1:53:53] or fourth generation made a denomination
[1:53:55] out of it that's right
[1:53:57] and so God when it comes to the
[1:54:00] Lutheran's they made a denomination so
[1:54:02] God moved on and he wanted to reveal
[1:54:04] something else there's other things he
[1:54:06] had to restore but but man was so
[1:54:08] organized so God had to move on beyond
[1:54:11] Luther and beyond others groups did that
[1:54:14] maybe broke away from Luther but they
[1:54:16] were still organized still denominations
[1:54:18] and so on so God had to raise up John
[1:54:21] Wesley a mayor right and it wasn't
[1:54:24] wasn't the church wasn't a denomination
[1:54:26] no but after Wesley they organized they
[1:54:29] and no no they broke off again into
[1:54:31] different groups different churches but
[1:54:34] it's all denominational and so and the
[1:54:37] prophet of God said that's why God
[1:54:39] raised up with him move with redhot
[1:54:41] salvation yeah he was red-hot salvation
[1:54:45] a man what for he's because the
[1:54:47] Methodists had organized so quickly he
[1:54:49] said God had to raise up wouldn't move
[1:54:51] to carry the message on to the
[1:54:53] Pentecostal age yeah that's what he did
[1:54:55] amen
[1:54:56] and then of course didn't the
[1:54:58] Pentecostals came and it wasn't very
[1:55:00] long only three or four years after the
[1:55:02] Pentecostal revival that they organized
[1:55:04] they became denominated a man and they
[1:55:06] were focusing on this and focusing on
[1:55:08] that but but they wouldn't continue on
[1:55:10] in the word they wouldn't continue on in
[1:55:12] the revelation Amen and it was in 1933
[1:55:16] that God brought the Prophet on the
[1:55:19] scene in 1933 that the the angel of God
[1:55:24] came down the pillar fire came down when
[1:55:26] the problem was baptizing in the Ohio
[1:55:29] River and and we were we were there
[1:55:32] three years ago I guess when our brother
[1:55:34] Joseph Paul was married down there and
[1:55:36] we went we went down to Jeffersonville
[1:55:39] area and so on and the brother took us
[1:55:41] to the part that part of the river and
[1:55:43] the Ohio River and he said now he said
[1:55:45] this is where the pillar of fire came
[1:55:47] down and so on and in 1933 voice it's
[1:55:51] amazing and and ordained and
[1:55:55] commissioned the Prophet that as John
[1:55:58] forerun the first coming he said you're
[1:55:59] going to forerun the second coming with
[1:56:02] his message
[1:56:03] a man that scripture that's not what why
[1:56:08] would we find that hard to believe
[1:56:10] brother he'd look what he did in his
[1:56:13] first coming he would do the same in his
[1:56:14] second coming that wouldn't that
[1:56:16] wouldn't be seemed seem hard or our
[1:56:19] contrary to the Word of God because
[1:56:21] again we know that it is Scripture
[1:56:24] because John was Malachi 4 but John did
[1:56:28] willfully at all and Jesus identified
[1:56:31] that John came and turned the hearts of
[1:56:34] the Jewish fathers to their credit
[1:56:36] costal children and now in the last days
[1:56:38] he said in that Malachi was going to
[1:56:40] he's going to send a messenger a prophet
[1:56:43] and what was he going to do turn the
[1:56:44] hearts of the Pentecostal children back
[1:56:47] to the father's a man right why because
[1:56:50] they got away from them from the
[1:56:52] original Pentecostal revival a man and
[1:56:55] the stand they took then and the life
[1:56:57] that they were living then and what they
[1:56:59] were the holiness they were teaching
[1:57:00] then they got worldly and and they got
[1:57:02] away from the the full revelation of the
[1:57:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:57:07] Pentecostal revival a man and so the
[1:57:11] prophet of God came on the scene a man
[1:57:13] what for the for rung the second coming
[1:57:15] of Jesus for the bride amen he came to
[1:57:19] redeem the bride now he come for the
[1:57:21] bride then he'll come with his bride
[1:57:22] amen to set up a ring upon the earth
[1:57:26] during the great millennial reign amen
[1:57:29] by the grace of God so brother that's
[1:57:31] Scripture it's like the prophet of God
[1:57:33] bring you know concerning water veteran
[1:57:35] scripture scripture father son Holy
[1:57:37] Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ father son
[1:57:40] Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ and so
[1:57:42] on a man from titles to the name titles
[1:57:46] to the east and it's one me in the name
[1:57:48] now names because if there's reached
[1:57:52] free persons it was plural and have you
[1:57:56] had to go baptize in the names of the
[1:57:58] Father Son and Holy Ghost if to the
[1:58:01] Trinity it's not a Trinity a man
[1:58:05] although even our brother Ray dear who
[1:58:08] did this Bible
[1:58:09] our mother Schofield he was credit area
[1:58:12] yeah but again
[1:58:16] but we see by the revelation of the word
[1:58:18] that it is not names it is not three
[1:58:22] persons it's one person see it's just
[1:58:24] amazing is this God doing this God doing
[1:58:28] that oh they knew him as this is Jehovah
[1:58:31] yeah then we then he then we came he
[1:58:34] came and he down and he was known as
[1:58:37] Jesus a man then he went back up and
[1:58:40] come back again in a different form
[1:58:41] and he's known as the Holy Ghost amen
[1:58:44] same one it is the same God praise the
[1:58:47] name of the Lord for that revelation
[1:58:49] amen
[1:58:50] and so God set problem promise to
[1:58:53] Malachi 4:2 for run the second coming a
[1:58:55] man and brother to forerun the second
[1:58:58] coming the mystery of God would be
[1:59:00] revealed in Revelation 10 and so on a
[1:59:03] man and an understand always and he's
[1:59:06] not in the church ages no he's in the
[1:59:09] bride age why because five of the seven
[1:59:14] ages were commanded to repent repent
[1:59:18] repent repent and so on and when he got
[1:59:22] to the seventh age he was put out don't
[1:59:26] put him out of your life but yet I know
[1:59:31] there are believers who got to put it it
[1:59:33] said that that there are so many
[1:59:37] believers they go to church on a regular
[1:59:48] basis why well I'm a believer what do
[1:59:51] you mean you're a believer oh I believe
[1:59:53] the message that God sent you William
[1:59:56] Branham that's all and and just a form
[2:00:01] of godliness they'll go to church and
[2:00:02] worship yeah yeah Lord yes right Lord
[2:00:05] that's what you revealed that's what you
[2:00:07] did Lord yeah thank you lord yeah and
[2:00:09] they go on when they go out it's
[2:00:13] forgotten
[2:00:14] oh if anybody were to question them or
[2:00:18] just I'm a believer I what do you mean
[2:00:22] your believer or we believe that God
[2:00:23] sent a prophet we believe that that he
[2:00:26] did this and he did that we
[2:00:27] that he revealed this you revealed that
[2:00:29] yeah but like brother Brown said it's
[2:00:32] all mental faith there are so many
[2:00:37] believers that are that have a mental
[2:00:40] thing it's all in their heads but not in
[2:00:44] their hearts because they won't still
[2:00:48] live their lives this way this way
[2:00:50] oh yeah they're again like the foolish
[2:00:55] virgin for virgins but they don't have
[2:00:59] wisdom of the wise no no no they're not
[2:01:07] allowing the message to govern
[2:01:09] everything they do oh yes the sister
[2:01:11] will still have long hair and and
[2:01:14] certain clothes and so on and the
[2:01:17] brothers will allow that oh I can't do
[2:01:20] that because I don't believe that I'm a
[2:01:22] believer
[2:01:22] I'm believer no you're a son of God
[2:01:25] you're born again that's what gives you
[2:01:28] a new creep the new new hunger thirst a
[2:01:31] man I think but no there's too many
[2:01:34] astir just going by the letter of the
[2:01:36] word they're going by the intellectual
[2:01:39] knowledge of the word and again like I
[2:01:41] said the prophet of God was identifying
[2:01:43] these things as he was getting near the
[2:01:45] end of his ministry and God was gonna
[2:01:46] take him off the scene yeah but he was
[2:01:49] he was God was leaving the warning to
[2:01:51] the people just saying and I think it's
[2:01:54] this message again crisis the mystery of
[2:01:56] God revealed where he talks about the
[2:01:59] intellectual faith in their heads versus
[2:02:02] the faith that God's looking for in your
[2:02:04] heart in your soul where do you have the
[2:02:07] revelation of this word in your head or
[2:02:09] in your heart why are you here because
[2:02:12] of intellectual conviction or it's a
[2:02:17] spiritual Holy Ghost conviction
[2:02:23] it said but again to make your car
[2:02:28] unless your Shores make sure you got it
[2:02:30] in your heart not in your head make sure
[2:02:33] you got it by your spiritual revelry and
[2:02:35] it controls you it governs you your
[2:02:40] attitude your spirit your actions and
[2:02:42] your reactions yeah you're not you're
[2:02:46] not like you used to be no more you know
[2:02:47] you're born again you're a new creature
[2:02:49] and and what are you reflecting they're
[2:02:52] reflecting the word - reflecting the
[2:02:53] message a man in your in your attitudes
[2:02:57] in your spirit not just by going to
[2:02:58] church not to pee by you having long
[2:03:01] hair or our sister having a certain
[2:03:03] clothes on
[2:03:04] you know our brother with this is
[2:03:05] they're short and so on and modest
[2:03:07] dinner there and modest there no no no
[2:03:09] no it is the anointing that controls
[2:03:12] your life your thoughts your motives
[2:03:14] your objectives everything now you're
[2:03:16] governed by the Holy Ghost even it's in
[2:03:19] your job but I don't care where it is
[2:03:21] it's the Holy Ghost
[2:03:23] it's God in control oh yes Jesus living
[2:03:26] in you it's like I've said whether I was
[2:03:30] a cook or a janitor or or working in in
[2:03:34] again in kitchens or whatever or in the
[2:03:36] retail business you know I was just did
[2:03:42] it for the Lord
[2:03:43] oh yeah the Lord was with me if I was
[2:03:47] there I wonder when I started one time
[2:03:49] in the in the Jannah in the business in
[2:03:51] it there's no stores that I was the
[2:03:56] insurance they put me in charge of the
[2:03:57] men's department then the boys
[2:03:58] department and then the footwear and and
[2:04:02] they just kept adding to it but I am me
[2:04:07] so much because I was there for a number
[2:04:09] of years until I became the manager of
[2:04:12] that store and they said to me they said
[2:04:15] are you a preacher oh I said I don't
[2:04:18] know I said I do
[2:04:20] I said AB encoding me sometimes I exhort
[2:04:22] the people or something not an over a
[2:04:24] preacher or not all I said okay we just
[2:04:27] we just thought you were you seem to be
[2:04:29] one so I you leave that impression with
[2:04:33] the people
[2:04:35] they know you're a Christian they know
[2:04:39] and now I'm not you're not you're not
[2:04:41] denominational they know that - they'll
[2:04:45] know that by the life you live but by
[2:04:46] why would you talk and how you act now
[2:04:48] you're wrecked and don't don't carry it
[2:04:50] carry on foolish not by any means no way
[2:04:55] because you're you're you're not what
[2:04:58] are you doing you're not you're not
[2:04:59] reflecting Christ the way you should
[2:05:01] reflecting Jesus the way you should by
[2:05:04] the grace of God
[2:05:05] so god help us brother in my prayer
[2:05:08] so make your call and election shore see
[2:05:11] if God is not only in you in church see
[2:05:13] if God is in you outside of church see
[2:05:16] if God is in you where you're doing your
[2:05:18] work see if God is in you in school oh
[2:05:22] yeah
[2:05:24] praise the Lord and again they knew that
[2:05:27] even in the school I attended and I'm
[2:05:30] not saying that for myself
[2:05:32] I've seen that for the Jude give the
[2:05:34] glory to God it's not me it's Christ and
[2:05:38] they knew that they knew what to say and
[2:05:42] how to say it they knew what they should
[2:05:44] not say and when I'm we're not when I
[2:05:45] was there or it she just changed the
[2:05:48] atmosphere and like I said I'll come it
[2:05:52] was the Lord for the for that that man
[2:05:56] to say what he said to me he said mister
[2:06:00] lush he said you're going to be a pastor

[2:06:16] diploma for grade 9 but he said yes and
[2:06:19] he wanted to know if I was going to take
[2:06:21] my course in Memorial University to be a
[2:06:26] pastor I said I don't think so I'll
[2:06:29] leave that with the Lord I said I said
[2:06:31] whatever the Lord wants me to do I'll do
[2:06:33] so ok said good and and that that man

[2:06:51] so brother sister are you gonna rise in
[2:06:56] judgment against those you're working
[2:07:00] are you gonna rise in judgment against

[2:07:08] going to be see if you're living for
[2:07:10] grace and he said you live for this one
[2:07:13] in the in the presence of this one you

[2:17:08] the same way Jesus act are we going to
[2:17:11] feel the same way Jesus felt are we
[2:17:13] gonna add the revelation that Jesus had
[2:17:15] concerning the end of his ministry cuz
[2:17:19] during the end of our ministry and the
[2:17:21] end of our witness and testimony that
[2:17:25] now as it was then Jesus laid down his
[2:17:28] light resurrected it picked it up
[2:17:30] raptured it amen and the Old Testament
[2:17:34] Saints raptured with him but now I see

[2:19:06] amen praise the Lord he said there were
[2:19:26] present at that season some that told
[2:19:28] him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate
[2:19:31] had mingled with their sacrifices and
[2:19:36] Jesus answering said unto them suppose
[2:19:39] ye that these Galileans were sinners
[2:19:42] above all Galileans because they
[2:19:44] suffered such things I tell you nay but
[2:19:50] except ye repent ye shall all likewise
[2:19:54] perish anything God's looking for in our
[2:19:59] hearts is repentance God is desiring
[2:20:03] that we have a repentant attitude a
[2:20:05] repentant spirit a man even after you
[2:20:08] become a new creature in Christ you're
[2:20:10] born again we have that spirit of
[2:20:13] repentance he said if we sin we have an

[2:21:53] great light and to them we said in the
[2:21:57] region and the shadow of death light is

[2:22:03] to preach and to say repent for the
[2:22:08] kingdom of heaven is at an amen
