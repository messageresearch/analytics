[40:28] subdue it have dominion over the fish of
[40:31] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[40:33] over every living thing that moveth upon
[40:36] the Earth amen God bless you you can
[40:38] have your seats and just in in seeking
[40:41] leadership for this service this week
[40:42] and I feels very Sovereign and I was
[40:45] thinking on things and then you know
[40:47] just kind of putting things to paper and
[40:48] then I'd have a conversation with one
[40:50] and then I'd have a conversation with
[40:51] another and this is kind of just where
[40:53] it came out so I'm trusting the leading
[40:54] of the Lord this morning amen I want to
[40:57] take a bit of a different angle than
[40:58] what we've been speaking on recently
[41:00] we've been talking about the Holy Spirit
[41:02] and the attributes and the nature of the
[41:04] the Holy Spirit and we know that that's
[41:05] the very life of God it's the nature of
[41:08] God it's it's the character of God and
[41:10] we know that's been given to every
[41:11] Christian every true son and daughter of
[41:13] God has to have the Holy Ghost Inside of
[41:16] them amen because it's the Difference
[41:17] Maker it's the Difference Maker between
[41:19] a professing Christian and a living
[41:21] Christian amen it's the life that's
[41:23] behind us that makes us live the life we
[41:24] do amen there's nothing in me that can
[41:26] make me live this life according to the
[41:28] word of God I'll fail every single time
[41:30] but it's the power of the holy spirit in
[41:32] us that allows us to do these things but
[41:35] out of all this I want to speak this
[41:36] morning on a title of the broken image
[41:39] amen the broken image and we know that
[41:41] as we read here in Genesis 1 that God
[41:43] made Mankind in a state of perfection he
[41:45] put him in a perfect place and there was
[41:47] no sin there we were Immortal we had
[41:49] full Authority and the winds and the the
[41:52] waves could obey us like it did Christ
[41:54] we have full Dominion we were sons of
[41:56] God God and Daughters of God just as
[41:57] Christ was Adam and Eve were of course
[41:59] as we're we're talking about these
[42:00] things and there was no sin there was no
[42:02] pain there was no sickness there was no
[42:04] unbelief there was no fear there was no
[42:06] separation there was nothing there it
[42:08] was a perfect place today and yet we
[42:10] look at where we're at today and
[42:11] obviously something has changed amen
[42:14] because all of those things that were
[42:15] good are gone and all of the things that
[42:17] are bad that they never had have come in
[42:19] here and we know that that's because
[42:20] there was a battle that raged back then
[42:22] and it's going on today and it's for
[42:24] control of the lives and The Souls of
[42:25] man kind amen and it's between good and
[42:28] evil it's between God and Satan and God
[42:31] sent and he still sends his word to keep
[42:33] us right that's the only thing that God
[42:35] promised was his word to keep us right
[42:37] he said I sent my word and I healed thy
[42:39] diseases when he was talking to Israel
[42:41] he said if you'll stay in my word then
[42:42] I'll stay with you if you'll stay in my
[42:44] word then you'll get the blessings of my
[42:46] word but if you go against it then all
[42:48] the curses of it will fall upon you as
[42:49] well amen so he sends the word to us and
[42:52] he says take it or leave it and that's
[42:55] the choice we make amen is will we take
[42:57] it or we leave it now we know that if
[42:59] you're a true son or daughter of God you
[43:01] cannot be lost because you come from God
[43:04] and you go back to God and we'll we'll
[43:05] maybe touch on that a little bit later
[43:07] but you're a part of God and so God will
[43:09] bring us to the place where we decide
[43:11] and we make the right decision and
[43:13] whether he has to lay us on our back in
[43:14] a hospital whether he has to take things
[43:16] from us or whether he has to show us the
[43:18] graciousness of the supernal by healing
[43:21] by provision whatever it might be God
[43:23] will bring us to a place where we
[43:24] recognize that our place is with him
[43:26] amen but I want to see what this image
[43:29] of of mankind is supposed to look like
[43:31] and how it got broken and and how God is
[43:33] restoring it and if we turn to Genesis
[43:35] chapter 2 it says this it says and the
[43:39] Lord God took the man and put him in the
[43:41] Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep
[43:43] it so there's his job within the context
[43:45] of what he said earlier amen so he's
[43:47] supposed to prepare Eden he's supposed
[43:49] to turn it into Perfection it says and
[43:51] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[43:53] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[43:55] freely eat but of the tree of knowledge
[43:58] of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou
[44:00] shalt not eat it for in the day that
[44:02] thou eatest thereof you shall surely die
[44:04] so God gives his word he tells him what
[44:06] to do and he tells him what not to do
[44:08] and he says if you do what I say
[44:10] everything will stay the same and if you
[44:12] refuse to do what I say if you disobey
[44:14] and do which I tell you not to do then
[44:16] something's going to happen and it's
[44:17] something horrible now here's the thing
[44:19] they wouldn't even know what death meant
[44:21] back then because they're in a state of
[44:23] perfection there was no understanding of
[44:25] what death meant but they knew that God
[44:27] said not to do it and that ought to have
[44:28] been enough amen we know that death
[44:30] means separation from God and eternal
[44:32] life means you're in the presence of God
[44:34] CU he is eternal life amen God only gave
[44:37] mankind one do not he gave him lots of
[44:40] dues and he gave him only one do not and
[44:43] he said to be to be fruitful to multiply
[44:45] to replenish the Earth to subdue it to
[44:47] have dominion over the animals and I
[44:49] think it's interesting that if they had
[44:51] focused more on what he said to do then
[44:53] they wouldn't have had a problem with
[44:54] the do Nots amen we look today and we've
[44:57] been told what to do with our lives
[44:58] we're to we're to spread the gospel
[45:00] we're to to seek after the king of
[45:02] kingdom of God to seek after the things
[45:04] that God wants us to do and if we
[45:06] consume ourselves with that then the do
[45:08] Nots become a lot less of a problem
[45:10] don't they because we're too busy doing
[45:12] what we're supposed to for Satan to come
[45:13] in and get a wedge in our life and try
[45:15] and draw us away from God CU Eve gets in
[45:17] trouble when she starts doing when she
[45:20] stops doing what she's supposed to be
[45:21] doing what did she do she started
[45:23] talking to the serpent as an equal
[45:27] the serpent was not like snakes are
[45:28] today because God cursed them and he
[45:30] said you're going to have to go on your
[45:31] belly he was like a man he could speak
[45:34] he had arms and legs he was the closest
[45:36] thing to a man if you're looking for the
[45:38] missing link it is Satan in the serpent
[45:40] amen that was the missing link between
[45:42] man and everything else it was one that
[45:43] was so close he could Converse but he
[45:45] had no soul and he was a beast and what
[45:48] happened is he struck up a conversation
[45:50] with Eve and she treated him as an equal
[45:53] instead of saying you're under my
[45:54] Dominion and what she did is she allowed
[45:57] him to get close to her and all of a
[45:59] sudden he starts talking to her and he
[46:01] starts asking her about the word of God
[46:03] gets into a conversation and pretty soon
[46:05] he's got her tricked amen Eve should
[46:09] have been using her Authority and
[46:10] Dominion to put him aside and say no no
[46:12] no you don't talk to me you know nothing
[46:14] about the word of God the word of God
[46:16] wasn't given to you no more than a
[46:18] parakeet could talk to us today they
[46:20] have no understanding of who we are that
[46:22] animal should have been under her
[46:23] submission amen as as the wife of Adam
[46:26] but yet she continued to talk to him
[46:28] amen and we see there that when she got
[46:31] into a conversation with him something
[46:32] breaks because she listens to what he
[46:35] has to say instead of the word of God in
[46:37] Genesis 3 it says this it says now the
[46:39] serpent was more subtle that means he
[46:41] was more crafty he was more SL Sly he
[46:44] was shrewd he was more of that than any
[46:46] beast of the field which the Lord God
[46:48] had made and he said unto the woman has
[46:50] God said You shall not eat of every tree
[46:51] of the garden and the woman said unto
[46:54] the serpent we may eat of the fruit of
[46:56] the Trees of the garden but of the fruit
[46:58] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[47:00] garden God has said ye shall not eat of
[47:02] it neither shall you touch it lest ye
[47:05] die everything's good to this point but
[47:08] watch verse four it says the serpent
[47:09] said unto the woman you shall not surely
[47:13] die God says you shall surely die and he
[47:16] says Thou shalt not it's 180 degrees
[47:19] it's a total opposite to what the word
[47:21] says amen and one word changed caused
[47:24] the entire downfall of humanity one
[47:26] change from what God Said Amen it
[47:28] swapped the truth for a supposedly
[47:30] greater plane of
[47:32] existence because what he says in verse
[47:34] 5 he says for God does know that in the
[47:37] day you eat it your eyes will be opened
[47:39] and you shall be as God's knowing go
[47:41] knowing good from Evil watch the
[47:43] subtlety now this is Satan's Hallmark
[47:46] Satan doesn't come up and punch you
[47:47] between the eyes Satan tries to slide a
[47:50] little bit here and a little bit there
[47:52] so in the hope that you won't understand
[47:54] you won't realize when what's going on
[47:56] and he's saying God's holding back on
[47:58] you there's a good thing available here
[48:00] and God's holding back on you because if
[48:03] you do this you'll be just like him and
[48:05] he doesn't want anybody to be like him
[48:07] God doesn't want to have an equal God
[48:09] doesn't want to have somebody that knows
[48:10] as much as he does so he's saying don't
[48:12] touch this and God has it in God has a
[48:15] selfish interest in keeping you from it
[48:17] now I want you to understand here
[48:19] nothing that the serpent says here is
[48:21] technically wrong God did know that when
[48:23] they ate of it their eyes would be open
[48:25] and they would know good from evil but
[48:26] that's not a good thing that's why God
[48:29] said don't do it you don't want to know
[48:31] good from Evil you don't want to
[48:33] experience what comes behind this amen
[48:35] it's not a state that they were supposed
[48:37] to be in and they knew no sin there was
[48:39] no unbelief there amen the word of God
[48:41] was pure and as long as they were in
[48:43] obedience to it then they could be pure
[48:45] as well but Satan has prefaced this
[48:48] whole thing with the lie and that's that
[48:49] you shall not die the effects are
[48:52] exactly right except for that thou shalt
[48:54] not die part and amen what is it he gave
[48:57] them 99% truth and 1%
[48:59] lie and a person that gives you 1% lie
[49:02] is still a liar no matter how much truth
[49:05] is there listen to this quote it says
[49:07] now we remember that that by this Holy
[49:09] Spirit we are brought into the body of
[49:11] Christ and we're free from the judgments
[49:12] of God we cannot come into judgment
[49:15] after you are in Christ because Christ
[49:17] took the Judgment for you he stood in
[49:19] the place just like Adam he says now
[49:21] Adam was not deceived he knew exactly
[49:23] what he was doing why did he do it to
[49:25] stay with Eve because she came out of
[49:27] him he said but Eve was deceived she
[49:30] thought that what she was doing was
[49:33] right she was deceived but she thought
[49:36] she was doing the right thing Satan gave
[49:38] her about 95% pure gospel and the other
[49:41] 5% was enough to throw that off he said
[49:45] so we've got not to be we've got to be
[49:47] not just park gospel we've got to be
[49:50] Full Gospel amen we've got to have the
[49:52] entire word he says for the Antichrist
[49:55] is this a part gospel preacher he says
[50:00] we know that and his works are part
[50:02] gospel remember what the Apostle Paul
[50:04] says I have not what uh shunn to declare
[50:07] unto you the Full Gospel we don't hold
[50:12] back just because it might offend or it
[50:14] might hurt we speak in love always
[50:17] because we want everyone to come to
[50:19] Christ we want everyone to experience
[50:21] what it means to be in Christ to have
[50:22] the baptism of the Holy Spirit to live
[50:24] an overcoming life amen but we don't
[50:26] hold back because people might not like
[50:28] it we have to speak the truth we do it
[50:31] to our children all the time don't we
[50:34] hopefully we do we tell them things they
[50:36] don't want to hear but we tell them it
[50:37] for their good because we're trying to
[50:39] teach them how to live a life amen that
[50:42] won't bring them into pain and suffering
[50:43] that they don't have to go
[50:45] into but listen what happens now because
[50:48] this is Eve's experience of Disobedience
[50:51] to the word of God I want you to catch
[50:52] what's happening here it says and when
[50:54] the woman saw that the tree was good for
[50:57] food and that it was pleasant to the
[50:59] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[51:02] one wise she took of the fruit thereof
[51:05] and did eat and gave also to her husband
[51:07] with her and he did eat Eve saw that the
[51:10] tree was good but that did not make the
[51:13] tree good her sight her experience her
[51:16] five senses her feelings saying this is
[51:19] good did not make it
[51:21] good God had already said it's evil
[51:23] don't touch it so her experience of
[51:26] pleasure did not make it
[51:29] right what she felt in her heart was
[51:32] good did not make it right amen God said
[51:35] it wasn't good and that's where the only
[51:37] truth is we can say all day long it
[51:40] feels good it feels right this is the
[51:41] way I feel but if it's against the word
[51:43] of God it can never be right ever ever
[51:46] ever God cannot deny his word amen when
[51:50] she did this it made her feel all sorts
[51:52] of things she enjoyed her moment of
[51:54] disobedience
[51:56] it was
[51:57] pleasurable scripture says that that
[51:59] that that that the that sin is
[52:01] pleasurable for a
[52:03] season we're not denying that sin can
[52:06] feel good but it's a feel good that
[52:08] doesn't last amen she enjoy breaking the
[52:10] word of God in the moment
[52:13] amen but what happens is after a while
[52:17] something changes but in the moment
[52:20] nothing happened she didn't experience
[52:22] this death God was talking about
[52:25] everything supposedly remain the same
[52:28] people do things all the time and when
[52:30] the Judgment Hammer Of God doesn't come
[52:32] down they say Well it must have been
[52:34] okay but remember the wages of sin is
[52:37] death amen it's
[52:39] destruction and just because it doesn't
[52:41] happen immediately doesn't mean it's not
[52:43] going to happen amen there's a cause and
[52:45] effect for everything look at verse
[52:47] seven now it says and the eyes of both
[52:49] of them were opened and they knew that
[52:51] they were
[52:53] naked and they sold fig leaves together
[52:56] and made themselves
[52:58] aprons that's quite a response to eating
[53:02] fruit now I'm not going to go into
[53:04] original sin this morning but I want to
[53:05] ask you a question if Eve ate a fruit
[53:09] why did she know she was naked and if
[53:12] the mouth is what caused the problem
[53:13] then why is she covering something other
[53:15] than her
[53:17] mouth right this wasn't an apple or a
[53:21] peach because the only thing that we
[53:23] were denied access to was the tree of
[53:25] life we were never denied access to the
[53:27] tree access to the tree of knowledge of
[53:29] Good and Evil so if that was a tree we
[53:30] ought to be able to find it
[53:32] today but we can amen but Watch What
[53:36] Happens now watch we start to see the
[53:38] effect and the effect is
[53:41] shame and shame and fear will keep you
[53:44] out of the presence of God verse eight
[53:46] says they heard the voice of the Lord
[53:48] God Walking In The Garden in the cool of
[53:50] the day and Adam and his wife hid
[53:53] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[53:54] God God would come down in the cool of
[53:56] the evening every day and spend time
[53:58] with them that was their experience that
[54:01] was eternal life that was the tree of
[54:02] life was God
[54:04] himself and they would spend time with
[54:06] them and they loved that and all of a
[54:07] sudden the thing that they love they're
[54:09] scared of and they're hiding from that
[54:11] which can save them it says and they hid
[54:15] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[54:16] God amongst the Trees of the garden with
[54:18] such a with such a knowledge if it was
[54:21] so good and it was so right they should
[54:23] have been running to God saying look at
[54:24] what we've got
[54:25] look at what we've experienced but
[54:27] instead they're hiding and they're
[54:28] trying to cover what they've done
[54:30] because they know now that they aren't
[54:32] fit to be in the presence of God the
[54:34] only new understanding they have is now
[54:36] I'm not worthy what a horrible place to
[54:39] be they went from perfect with no sin no
[54:42] shame and now they don't even want to be
[54:43] in the presence of
[54:45] God verse N9 says and the Lord God
[54:47] called unto
[54:49] Adam we can give me the next slide
[54:51] brother Matt and the Lord God called
[54:53] unto Adam and said unto him where are
[54:55] thou and he said I heard your voice in
[54:57] the garden and I was afraid why because
[55:00] I was naked and I hid myself Adam had
[55:02] never experienced fear until now why
[55:05] because he's living in perfect love the
[55:07] scripture says perfect love casts out
[55:09] all fear Adam is experiencing his heart
[55:12] racing and his palms sweating and things
[55:15] just not feeling right a turmoil in his
[55:17] stomach because for once in his life now
[55:20] he is not fit to be in the presence of
[55:22] God and he's worried about how to fix it
[55:24] amen
[55:25] and he said God said ' who told you you
[55:27] were naked hast thou eaten of the tree
[55:29] that I commanded you that you shouldn't
[55:31] eat and the man saidthe woman who thou
[55:33] gavest to be with me she gave me of the
[55:36] tree and I did eat the very fabric of
[55:38] the family of God is falling apart as
[55:40] fingers start to point at the next one
[55:41] down the line nobody's willing to stand
[55:43] up and say I did
[55:45] wrong the first place we have to
[55:47] recognize is our role in any of this
[55:50] amen I can't pass it off to my wife I
[55:51] can't pass off to my children I can't
[55:53] pass it up to my daddy and Mom
[55:55] I can't pass it on to the minister it's
[55:57] me and me alone that takes
[55:59] responsibility for how I live my life
[56:00] amen my decisions amen we know what
[56:04] happened after that we know that God
[56:05] pushed them out of his presence and he
[56:07] put a flaming angels with a flaming
[56:09] sword there to keep the way of life lest
[56:12] the people could come and have eternal
[56:13] life but before they leave God says
[56:17] stop and he gives them
[56:20] hope and he says
[56:23] here
[56:25] I will put enity between thee and the
[56:27] woman he's speaking to the serpent and
[56:29] between thy seed and her seed it'll
[56:32] bruise your head and it will and thou
[56:33] shalt bruise his heel now we know as
[56:36] Believers we've been well taught that
[56:38] this promise was fulfilled in Christ not
[56:40] just in his birth but in his death amen
[56:42] without going into the original sin
[56:44] though why did God have to be born of a
[56:46] virgin what does virginity have to do
[56:48] with
[56:49] anything why is it that Christ had to be
[56:51] born the way he did because he was
[56:53] drawing a line between what we are and
[56:56] what we were supposed to be our our our
[56:59] our nature our very flesh has fallen
[57:02] from the beginning and there was no
[57:03] redeeming quality in itself there was
[57:06] nothing God could do with what we had so
[57:08] he had to come as Adam was by a spoken
[57:11] word
[57:12] birth Perfect by the spirit of God
[57:16] speaking him into existence so that he
[57:18] could come forth perfect amen God said
[57:21] I'm going to draw a line between what
[57:22] you are and what you're supposed to be
[57:24] I'm going to un do the effects of all of
[57:26] this and it's going to be in a special
[57:28] way now Christ was came and he was born
[57:30] of a virgin it was perfect remember the
[57:33] scripture says Mary was not in a
[57:35] relationship with the man it says she
[57:36] was overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and
[57:39] the angel said what's found in you is of
[57:41] the Holy Spirit not of Mary there was no
[57:45] DNA of Mary in Jesus she had nothing to
[57:48] do with it everything inside of her was
[57:50] spoken by the word of God and the Holy
[57:53] Spirit placed it inside of her and so
[57:55] when Christ was born he was neither Jew
[57:57] nor
[57:58] Gentile he was the second Adam perfect
[58:02] born by the word of God Jesus never
[58:04] called Mary Mother he called her
[58:09] woman Joseph was never acknowledged as
[58:11] his father he said don't you know that I
[58:14] must be about my father's business that
[58:15] wasn't carpentry it was the Gospel it
[58:17] was the good news and all of these
[58:19] things the scripture calls him the
[58:20] second Adam because he had no flaw and
[58:23] no fault
[58:26] nothing in him was was broken and that's
[58:29] what we needed because we had to have a
[58:30] second Adam that would come the
[58:32] difference between Christ and Adam was
[58:33] Christ never fell Christ never went away
[58:36] from the word instead he fulfilled the
[58:38] word that he could redeem the bride that
[58:39] he could redeem his children back to him
[58:42] amen and he came and he died on Calvary
[58:44] and he became our sin you know it's
[58:46] taught so often that that he took our
[58:49] sins he carried them he didn't carry
[58:51] them he literally became them he became
[58:54] you and and I so that we could become
[58:56] him amen Paul said in 2 Corinthians he
[58:58] says for he has made him to be sin for
[59:01] us who knew no sin he took everything
[59:05] wrong that we were and he put it into
[59:08] Christ when he went to the whipping post
[59:10] when he went to that that cross why did
[59:12] he do it that we might be made the
[59:15] righteousness of God in him so we have a
[59:17] supernatural swap going on where
[59:19] everything wrong with us he puts on
[59:21] Christ and everything that's right with
[59:23] Christ he puts on us and so we get all
[59:25] the benefit and he pays all the price
[59:28] that's a deal I'm willing to take church
[59:30] that I don't have to pay the price
[59:31] because he already pray it
[59:33] amen listen to this it says but man was
[59:36] put here with a dominion over the Earth
[59:38] he had everything under his control what
[59:41] Adam lost Jesus proved that he had
[59:43] restored he stopped nature he raised the
[59:46] dead he did everything he says and the
[59:48] world is groaning today the Bible said
[59:50] for the manifestations of the sons of
[59:52] God just like Christ
[59:55] what for God to get into his children
[59:58] again in what
[1:00:00] realities realities not just Doctrine
[1:00:04] not just theology not just our name on a
[1:00:06] book but the reality of a living God
[1:00:08] inside of us amen he says and it's to
[1:00:11] make things real and then he says but it
[1:00:15] stumbles the
[1:00:16] people why because they believed a
[1:00:19] different lie they believed a different
[1:00:22] word they don't have the fullness of it
[1:00:24] amen the image of God was broken in men
[1:00:28] when Eve and Adam fell the image was
[1:00:31] broken and there was nothing in it that
[1:00:33] was worth saving but yet Christ came and
[1:00:35] he says I'll save it I'll take
[1:00:36] everything that's broken and I'll take
[1:00:38] it on me and I'll pay the price the
[1:00:40] price was death that's what we deserve
[1:00:42] the price that we deserve for our fallen
[1:00:44] condition is death according to the word
[1:00:45] of God but he says I'll pay the price
[1:00:47] I'll take my perfection and give it to
[1:00:49] them I'll take their place and I'll pay
[1:00:51] that price and it's to do what to bring
[1:00:53] us back to our original condition but I
[1:00:56] want to dig into what happened with Eve
[1:00:58] because I want to take us to where we
[1:00:59] are today we don't just want to talk
[1:01:02] about the past but we want to talk about
[1:01:03] the effect of what God has done in our
[1:01:06] lives amen because if we don't step into
[1:01:08] full Redemption we're going to miss out
[1:01:10] on what God's trying to do amen the
[1:01:13] world preaches a Christ of salvation but
[1:01:15] how many are preaching a Christ of full
[1:01:16] Redemption redeem means to restore back
[1:01:19] to its original place to take us back to
[1:01:22] what we were in Eden that's what God's
[1:01:23] trying to do
[1:01:24] he's not just trying to get our names on
[1:01:26] a book He's not just trying to tell us
[1:01:27] our sins are forgiven he's trying to
[1:01:29] restore us in our life in our condition
[1:01:32] back to what we were inside of Eden now
[1:01:34] remember Eve's mind and her five senses
[1:01:37] all declared that the tree of knowledge
[1:01:38] of Good and Evil was good Pleasant and
[1:01:41] enjoyable her experience was that a
[1:01:44] pleasure she thought that she was doing
[1:01:47] the right thing she had a good time and
[1:01:50] we tend to think today if we have a good
[1:01:51] time it must be right but nothing could
[1:01:54] be further from the truth amen but her
[1:01:56] experience and her opinion of pleasure
[1:01:59] did not change the fact that God said
[1:02:01] this is
[1:02:03] wrong that's where our standard is
[1:02:05] that's where our absolute is is not in
[1:02:07] how I
[1:02:08] feel not in how I think not in my
[1:02:11] intuition but it's what does the word of
[1:02:13] God say about it what has God said about
[1:02:15] it because only God is good only God
[1:02:18] knows what is right and only God knows
[1:02:19] what is wrong he is the definition of it
[1:02:22] he's the definition of it amen God said
[1:02:24] it was wrong and in the end the word
[1:02:25] proved right and her experience proved
[1:02:28] wrong her experience of pleasure didn't
[1:02:30] last but the word of God didn't fail and
[1:02:32] what happened death came after it what
[1:02:35] did she do she laid aside the word of
[1:02:37] God and she followed her senses she
[1:02:39] followed her mind she followed her
[1:02:41] intuition however we want to put it amen
[1:02:43] she entered into fellowship with an
[1:02:45] unbeliever and it led her down a path of
[1:02:47] unbelief until she would believe a lie
[1:02:49] and she would be damned by that very
[1:02:50] thing how'd she do it she got out from
[1:02:53] under God's protection
[1:02:55] listen to this always when God
[1:02:59] provides brother Matt you're going to
[1:03:01] have to help me here it's a having some
[1:03:02] issues with the clicker always when God
[1:03:04] provides he provides the
[1:03:07] best that means it works and it works
[1:03:10] all the time every time when God
[1:03:13] provided a way to fortify his church he
[1:03:15] provided the best when he gave Adam and
[1:03:17] Eve in the Garden of Eden what he gave
[1:03:18] them was his word you stay behind this
[1:03:21] word and you're safe but if you get out
[1:03:23] from it the day you eat thereof is the
[1:03:25] day you die God has never changed his
[1:03:29] strategy and Satan has never changed his
[1:03:31] how he got into Adam and Eve he gets
[1:03:34] into them today why by trying to reason
[1:03:37] it out everyone today wants to have a
[1:03:40] debate and they want to have an
[1:03:42] argument that's the way it is social
[1:03:45] media is full of it the news is full of
[1:03:47] it the commentators are full of it
[1:03:50] everything is controversial and
[1:03:51] everything's up for discussion and there
[1:03:53] are no absolutes
[1:03:55] that's not the way a Believer believes
[1:03:57] that's not the way we look at the word
[1:03:58] of God Amen and listen to what they say
[1:04:01] now it's reasonable that God would not
[1:04:04] oh God has said told Satan but surely a
[1:04:06] holy God won't do this surely you won't
[1:04:09] die he say surely he will because he
[1:04:11] said he would God can't lie he's not a
[1:04:13] man that he should lie the scripture
[1:04:15] says if God says he's going to do it
[1:04:16] he's going to do it and if God says he
[1:04:19] won't do it then he won't do it but
[1:04:21] Satan tries to interject something with
[1:04:23] our feelings with the logic that God
[1:04:25] surely would not do something CU God is
[1:04:27] not that type of a person God's already
[1:04:29] declared who he is he's already declared
[1:04:31] what he likes and he's already declared
[1:04:32] what he hates and he'll stand behind
[1:04:34] that until everything's finished up amen
[1:04:37] now I had a video recommended to me on
[1:04:39] YouTube recently and it was by some
[1:04:41] actor that's on a Big Show and he's a
[1:04:42] professing Christian he has his own
[1:04:44] YouTube channel where he talks about God
[1:04:46] and His beliefs and what's happening in
[1:04:48] his life and the title of the video was
[1:04:50] some say I can't be a Christian and play
[1:04:53] this role
[1:04:54] as an actor in this big TV show amen now
[1:04:57] remember we're talking about the broken
[1:04:58] image this morning and this is what it
[1:05:00] looks like I as soon as I read that
[1:05:02] title I knew it was going to be a
[1:05:04] doozy but I wanted to hear his logic
[1:05:07] because I knew logic was going to come
[1:05:08] through but I want to repeat some of his
[1:05:11] words because I want you to see what a
[1:05:12] broken image looks like
[1:05:15] today he said I love playing this
[1:05:19] character I love telling this story he
[1:05:23] has pleasure in it I love playing a
[1:05:26] character who creates a kind of moral
[1:05:29] ambiguity that we should struggle
[1:05:31] against as we consider whether or not
[1:05:33] what he's doing is good all the time or
[1:05:35] morally right I think that kind of thing
[1:05:39] is fun and fascinating and I think
[1:05:41] escaping to that world as an audience I
[1:05:43] hope it's as enjoyable for you as it is
[1:05:45] for me to bring it to life moral
[1:05:49] ambiguity he says but it's funny to me
[1:05:51] how a lot of people criticize me
[1:05:53] supposed Christians especially for
[1:05:55] playing this character as if the only TV
[1:05:58] that should exist is people silently
[1:06:00] folding their hands in the Pew of a
[1:06:01] church I mean what kind of a story are
[1:06:04] we supposed to be
[1:06:07] telling maybe we could start with the
[1:06:11] gospel there's only one thing Jesus told
[1:06:13] us to go out and do preach the gospel he
[1:06:17] didn't say tell stories he said preach
[1:06:19] the gospel in word and In Deed we've got
[1:06:23] Mark 16 that tells us if we're going to
[1:06:25] do TV that's the kind of TV we ought to
[1:06:27] do the gospel amen but I've said this
[1:06:30] before don't answer satanic questions
[1:06:32] with satanic answers and his answer is
[1:06:35] well if that won't sell then that means
[1:06:36] we've got to do something else no if
[1:06:40] that won't sell and we have to
[1:06:41] compromise on anything else then maybe
[1:06:42] we don't need to do it at all now maybe
[1:06:45] we don't have to do it at all amen but
[1:06:48] you look at that show The Chosen seems
[1:06:50] to be doing just fine where they focus
[1:06:51] on the gospel but what's the simple Le
[1:06:54] fact he takes pleasure in what he's
[1:06:56] doing and that's his bottom line I take
[1:06:59] pleasure in it I call myself a Christian
[1:07:01] therefore it's okay we're not here to
[1:07:05] sell we're here to offer free of charge
[1:07:08] we've received freely we give freely
[1:07:10] amen we're not here to make money off
[1:07:12] the gospel we're not here to make money
[1:07:13] off of the gifts God gives us we're here
[1:07:15] to bring souls to
[1:07:17] Christ so he continues he says I think
[1:07:19] it's laughable when people criticize me
[1:07:22] for playing people that aren't
[1:07:24] saintly that's not my job so in his mind
[1:07:27] we don't have to be saintly we can be
[1:07:28] morally ambiguous to make people
[1:07:31] think he says and I don't think God only
[1:07:34] cares about telling those kinds of
[1:07:35] stories now he presumes to think for
[1:07:39] God Amen God gave us a story to tell
[1:07:42] Mark
[1:07:43] 16 that's it the story we have to tell
[1:07:48] is what he's done and what he's doing
[1:07:51] amen we give our testimony for what the
[1:07:52] gospel looks like today amen our job is
[1:07:55] to live the life of Christ not just talk
[1:07:57] it it's to live it amen and it's to
[1:07:59] bring people up to his level not stoop
[1:08:02] at their level amen we don't look down
[1:08:04] at somebody that's not a Believer but
[1:08:07] that means we don't get in the mud
[1:08:08] either I don't become a drunk to save a
[1:08:10] drunk I don't become a fornicator to
[1:08:12] save a fornicator I don't become a liar
[1:08:14] to save a liar I say there's a higher
[1:08:16] plane there's a way that you can live
[1:08:18] there where you don't have to be that
[1:08:19] way he says I think we can start
[1:08:22] conversations and Reach people through
[1:08:23] these mediums in a way that I think God
[1:08:27] enjoys does God enjoy moral
[1:08:31] ambiguity scripture says that you're yay
[1:08:33] be yay and you're NB
[1:08:36] nay scripture says that these things are
[1:08:39] plain the way of Holiness is is so easy
[1:08:42] to follow that a man though a fool could
[1:08:44] still walk in it God's not trying to
[1:08:47] hide things from people so why do we
[1:08:49] need moral
[1:08:51] ambiguity he says in a way that I think
[1:08:53] God is enjoys he says so here we are now
[1:08:56] where we can get to the heart of the
[1:08:57] matter where God has built a platform
[1:09:00] because of this show for me where I can
[1:09:03] reach people who maybe don't think about
[1:09:04] these things all the time and maybe
[1:09:07] maybe for those who are struggling or
[1:09:08] feel lost and want to try something new
[1:09:11] they can find something that brings them
[1:09:12] hope like my faith has to me but I want
[1:09:15] you to catch what he says here I think I
[1:09:17] think I think I don't
[1:09:19] think Where's God he doesn't mention a
[1:09:23] sing Le scripture he doesn't take his
[1:09:25] thoughts back to the word of God he just
[1:09:27] says I think because he's enjoying what
[1:09:30] he's
[1:09:31] doing and because he enjoys it and he
[1:09:33] thinks that there's something of God in
[1:09:35] it that makes it right and good amen but
[1:09:37] the scripture says God doesn't dwell in
[1:09:39] darkness there's no darkness in him
[1:09:41] there's no evil in him there's no moral
[1:09:43] ambiguity God doesn't preach through sin
[1:09:47] God doesn't preach through going against
[1:09:48] his word amen God doesn't contradict his
[1:09:50] word with his blessings it doesn't work
[1:09:52] that way you can't say I'm doing what
[1:09:54] the word says not to do and God's in it
[1:09:57] no that's not the way God does it God
[1:09:59] can turn it for good but he's not in it
[1:10:02] amen so we can see that these man's
[1:10:05] contradictions are obvious but yet we
[1:10:07] come to our own
[1:10:08] lives and we can say well I feel led to
[1:10:12] do this and it takes you right out of
[1:10:14] the word of God and what do we fall back
[1:10:15] on what we feel I think I feel led is
[1:10:19] the the great thing that I hear so many
[1:10:21] times but your leadership has to come in
[1:10:24] line with the word of God otherwise it's
[1:10:26] your own leadership it's not God it's
[1:10:29] never God if it's contrary to his word
[1:10:32] amen God never blesses us in a way that
[1:10:34] makes us go against his word he doesn't
[1:10:36] do it he can't do it because it would
[1:10:38] mean he's going against himself amen now
[1:10:41] this this man this actor is extremely
[1:10:43] passionate about God when you watch him
[1:10:46] he's eager his eyes are bright and
[1:10:48] Shining he's passionate he's Fearless he
[1:10:52] loves to talk about God
[1:10:55] but that has nothing to do with
[1:10:57] it I went and looked up his show and his
[1:11:01] show is rated to be 18 plus years old to
[1:11:03] watch it it has sex and nudity profanity
[1:11:07] alcohol drugs and smoking intense
[1:11:08] violence and Gore and taking the name of
[1:11:10] God in vain in it and he does those
[1:11:13] things personally in those in in the
[1:11:16] show or whatever it
[1:11:17] is so he is doing things that Paul said
[1:11:20] are not even to be named Among Us
[1:11:22] they're not even to be spoken of and he
[1:11:25] is doing them in front of millions of
[1:11:27] people and saying this is the platform
[1:11:30] God has built so that I can share the
[1:11:32] gospel what's his testimony on the
[1:11:34] screen I'm like all of you and what's
[1:11:37] his testimony off the screen I'm not
[1:11:39] like all of you you can't get clear
[1:11:43] water and dirty water out of the same
[1:11:46] Fountain you can't do it there's a
[1:11:49] disconnect here and the disconnect is is
[1:11:50] that he's not running his filter through
[1:11:52] the word of God man there's nothing
[1:11:54] there this man has nothing of God in his
[1:11:57] in his show you can look it up and
[1:11:59] they'll they'll give you all the things
[1:12:00] that they do and say and warnings and
[1:12:02] all these different things they have
[1:12:03] websites for these things there's no
[1:12:04] references to Christ except to take his
[1:12:06] name in vain in the show that's it no
[1:12:09] spirituality no faith no nothing like he
[1:12:11] says it's a morally ambiguous show about
[1:12:14] a man that goes around writing wrongs
[1:12:16] and he says this is God using me
[1:12:18] building a platform he said God's
[1:12:21] blessing my work by making me famous
[1:12:23] enough so people will listen to me about
[1:12:24] the
[1:12:25] gospel doesn't that sound
[1:12:29] good that's what we want to do isn't it
[1:12:32] God has given me this God has given me
[1:12:34] that God's done this and that so I can
[1:12:35] do something for his glory but if what
[1:12:37] he's given you is contrary to his word
[1:12:39] it can't be
[1:12:40] him Paul said this in Romans 3:8 he said
[1:12:44] and why not say he said as some
[1:12:46] slanderously report claim that we teach
[1:12:48] let us do evil so that may good may come
[1:12:51] of it that's literally what this man is
[1:12:53] saying I'm going to do something that is
[1:12:56] wrong and God is using me to do
[1:12:59] something good out of
[1:13:01] it Paul says their condemnation by God
[1:13:05] is just God will judge them for it
[1:13:08] because it's in their own minds it's in
[1:13:10] their own life it's in their own
[1:13:11] Pleasures that they're doing it and God
[1:13:13] is nowhere found in it now you say
[1:13:14] brother John this is too obvious he's
[1:13:17] obviously a professing Christian he's
[1:13:18] not a real Christian but there were over
[1:13:21] 6,100 comments on that video from
[1:13:25] professing Christians saying you're
[1:13:26] absolutely
[1:13:29] right how how have we slid this
[1:13:33] far how does somebody get that far it's
[1:13:36] because they've been fed alive for so
[1:13:38] long that they finally believe it amen
[1:13:42] they believe you can do anything and be
[1:13:44] a Christian but what does Christian mean
[1:13:47] see it's lost its meaning Church it
[1:13:49] means
[1:13:50] Christlike like Christ Christ was a holy
[1:13:55] person he wasn't running around doing
[1:13:57] anything and everything he kept his life
[1:14:00] holy he kept his like Sanctified
[1:14:02] scripture tells us to be holy as God is
[1:14:04] Holy this man has no concept of
[1:14:07] Holiness and so he'll sit there and
[1:14:09] he'll say God is using me amen but
[1:14:11] what's the problem
[1:14:14] here he's not feeding on the full
[1:14:17] word he's going here a bit and there a
[1:14:20] bit and he's building a web out of
[1:14:22] scriptures that supports his IDE somehow
[1:14:24] I'm still not sure because I don't know
[1:14:25] how you can go and and have nudity and
[1:14:27] all these different things and somehow
[1:14:29] think that God's in it but yet he
[1:14:32] does 2 Thessalonians 2 says this this is
[1:14:35] Paul talking he says for this cause God
[1:14:38] shall send them strong delusion that
[1:14:41] they should believe a lie now watch why
[1:14:43] he lets them believe it because that
[1:14:45] they all might be damned who believe not
[1:14:47] the truth why had pleasure in
[1:14:51] unrighteousness God says if this is what
[1:14:53] you like I'll give you over so
[1:14:55] completely that you'll believe your own
[1:14:56] self even though it's absolutely
[1:14:58] contrary to what I've told you you love
[1:15:00] it so much I don't have to do anything
[1:15:02] I'll just let you have it church if we
[1:15:05] insist on our way you know what God
[1:15:07] does have your way do it and what
[1:15:11] happens is we get
[1:15:13] scars and it's not scars of his choosing
[1:15:16] it's not scars of his making it scars of
[1:15:18] our making by our choices amen when we
[1:15:21] walk off from the word of God you know
[1:15:23] what God does he says I'm going to stay
[1:15:25] right here and you can come back
[1:15:28] anytime the scariest thing is if nothing
[1:15:32] happens scari thing is if nothing
[1:15:34] happens we do things we know we ought
[1:15:36] not to do and nothing happens you know
[1:15:37] why because the scripture says that God
[1:15:39] chastises his children and if he doesn't
[1:15:41] chastise us it means we're not his
[1:15:43] children says we're bastards amen child
[1:15:46] of God gets off the word of God they
[1:15:47] know they're off the word of God they do
[1:15:49] it willingly in iniquity God will beat
[1:15:51] them he'll spank them he'll get their
[1:15:53] attention one way or the other and he'll
[1:15:55] bring them back to the word because
[1:15:56] that's the way God works with his
[1:15:57] children he doesn't deal in moral
[1:16:00] ambiguity he deals with sharp correction
[1:16:02] to bring us back to his presence and to
[1:16:04] his word
[1:16:06] amen what happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:16:09] was Satan took the mind and God took the
[1:16:11] heart and Eve allowed the mind to
[1:16:14] override the word of God that was in her
[1:16:17] heart logic and reason surely God won't
[1:16:20] do it prophet of God say he surely will
[1:16:23] cuz he said he would and he can't take
[1:16:25] it back what's the problem we're made in
[1:16:28] the image of God but the image is broken
[1:16:30] because we have our mind now we have our
[1:16:33] spirit now and that's what breaks it
[1:16:36] we're in His image we're meant to be
[1:16:38] creators we're meant to have dominion
[1:16:40] but what we have now is a mind of our
[1:16:42] own making and it's subject to satanic
[1:16:44] influence and so everything we do
[1:16:46] instead of being creative is destructive
[1:16:48] amen we're born in sin we're shaped in
[1:16:51] iniquity we come to the world speaking
[1:16:53] lies there is nothing of the purity of
[1:16:55] the original creation that we had in us
[1:16:57] anymore we have a presumption of our own
[1:17:00] goodness of our own correctness and
[1:17:02] usually it's with a minimal interaction
[1:17:04] with God it's not a real relationship
[1:17:07] it's just a little thing we have and so
[1:17:09] we tend to overstate the goodness that's
[1:17:11] in us people say people are good
[1:17:13] scripture says we're
[1:17:15] not word says there's nothing good in us
[1:17:18] we have moments where we can sacrifice
[1:17:20] absolutely but our overall nature is
[1:17:23] destructive because in the end we are
[1:17:25] selfish we're internally focused amen
[1:17:28] look at what the prophet of God says he
[1:17:29] says first we reckon ourselves wor
[1:17:32] Sinners and worthy of condemnation
[1:17:34] that's where we start we're unworthy
[1:17:37] nothing we have we can't bring anything
[1:17:39] to the table that's good he says we're
[1:17:41] all born in sin we're shaped in iniquity
[1:17:43] there's not a sound parcel of us our
[1:17:45] minds are bad our soul is corruptable
[1:17:47] our constant thinking is evil every
[1:17:49] imaginary thought of a man's mind is
[1:17:51] evil he's a sinner and also our body is
[1:17:54] weak our spirit is no good and we're
[1:17:55] just full of corruption that's what we
[1:17:58] are that's all we are he says and how
[1:18:01] could one corruptible thing bring forth
[1:18:03] another good thing out of a corruptible
[1:18:05] let me say this that in job the 14th
[1:18:07] chapter he said seeing that man is born
[1:18:09] of a woman full of sorrow and trouble
[1:18:11] yet he comes forth like a flower and he
[1:18:13] Fades away and on as the prophet goes on
[1:18:16] speaking he says who can bring a clean
[1:18:18] thing out of an unclean thing not one he
[1:18:20] says there's no purification to it our
[1:18:23] mind our soul our spirit is completely
[1:18:25] corrupt by our natural birth there's
[1:18:28] nothing good that we're bringing to this
[1:18:29] amen but what brings us into a Godly
[1:18:32] life is that Christ died for our sins he
[1:18:34] became our sins and we can accept that
[1:18:36] free gift it's a free gift you don't
[1:18:39] have to pay anything to accept the the
[1:18:42] work of Christ the calvary except to
[1:18:44] repent of where you're at to repent of
[1:18:46] what you're done sincere repentance for
[1:18:48] what you've been and what you've done
[1:18:50] and you accept his work at Calvary and
[1:18:52] the blood of Jesus cleanses us from our
[1:18:53] sins that is very simple amen but the
[1:18:57] Redemptive Act of Act of Calvary is only
[1:18:59] the start it's only the start amen the
[1:19:02] price of sin is paid but for the
[1:19:04] believer that's just the foundation for
[1:19:06] everything that we are why because our
[1:19:09] nature isn't Changed by Calvary our
[1:19:12] spirit isn't Changed by Calvary our
[1:19:13] heart isn't Changed by Calvary amen the
[1:19:16] only thing that Calvary changes is that
[1:19:17] we can approach God cuz when Christ died
[1:19:20] remember they had the holy of holies and
[1:19:22] the Temple and that's where the glory of
[1:19:24] God was that's where the Ark of the
[1:19:25] Covenant was that's where the word of
[1:19:27] God was that's where the presence of God
[1:19:29] was and when Christ died the the the
[1:19:31] veil was torn from top to bottom showing
[1:19:34] that God tore it and he tore it open so
[1:19:36] that anybody could come you don't have
[1:19:38] to come as a good person you can come as
[1:19:41] the dirtiest person in this world and
[1:19:44] you can walk straight into the presence
[1:19:45] of God and say I'm sorry and I want
[1:19:47] forgiveness and he will forgive you and
[1:19:50] he'll save
[1:19:51] you you never did it in the first place
[1:19:53] he'll justify you
[1:19:56] amen but that doesn't restore us to our
[1:19:59] eating condition it just is the doorway
[1:20:02] to the path to being restored to our
[1:20:04] Eden condition it takes more than
[1:20:05] forgiveness it takes a changing of Our
[1:20:07] Lives takes a changing of our heart it
[1:20:10] takes a changing of our soul a changing
[1:20:12] of our spirit not just the cleansing of
[1:20:15] our conscience because Calvary cleanses
[1:20:18] the conscience
[1:20:19] amen but unless we change our our heart
[1:20:22] and our soul our spirit we're still
[1:20:23] stuck with what we think and feel is
[1:20:26] right and it'll lead us right back to
[1:20:28] where we were before
[1:20:29] amen our nature is self- deceiving why
[1:20:33] because it's subject to sin it's born in
[1:20:36] sin and therefore it's more inclined
[1:20:38] towards being influenced by Satan than
[1:20:40] God that's our natural
[1:20:43] condition Jeremiah said this he says the
[1:20:46] heart is deceitful above all things you
[1:20:50] say I feel like this is right I feel
[1:20:51] like that is right I feel like I should
[1:20:53] do this I feel like I should do that I
[1:20:55] feel like that makes sense that has
[1:20:56] nothing to do with it he says our heart
[1:20:57] is the most deceitful thing in the world
[1:21:00] he says it's desperately wicked and who
[1:21:03] can know
[1:21:04] it you say in my heart it feels right I
[1:21:07] say who cares what does the word of God
[1:21:09] say and I've got to check that in myself
[1:21:12] every day because feelings rise
[1:21:15] up to do to not do to speak to not speak
[1:21:18] to act to not act we've got to come back
[1:21:21] to hear because that's what the spirit
[1:21:23] of God will do in our lives Isaiah 5
[1:21:26] says this woe unto them that call evil
[1:21:29] good and good evil that put Darkness for
[1:21:32] light and light for darkness that put
[1:21:33] bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter
[1:21:36] woe unto them now catch this that are
[1:21:38] wise in their own eyes and prudent in
[1:21:42] their own
[1:21:43] sight this actor is wise in his own eyes
[1:21:45] he's saying God gave me Fame so I could
[1:21:47] be a witness the deceit here is that God
[1:21:50] gave him Fame he has Fame that doesn't
[1:21:52] mean God gave it to him that doesn't
[1:21:54] mean that's the work of God Amen because
[1:21:56] why he's living contrary to the word of
[1:21:58] God in those very films and so God can't
[1:22:00] use him in that way you know what God
[1:22:03] could do God could open his eyes and
[1:22:06] that man could repent of where he's at
[1:22:08] and come into a revelation not just of a
[1:22:10] saving God but a changing God and that's
[1:22:13] how God could use where he's at but God
[1:22:15] can't use him where he's at because he's
[1:22:16] living and acting in sin and taking
[1:22:18] pleasure in
[1:22:19] it he hasn't even understood what it
[1:22:21] means to repent yet
[1:22:23] unfortunately and I'm not saying that in
[1:22:25] judgment I'm saying that that God would
[1:22:26] be merciful to him and open his eyes
[1:22:29] because there's 6,100 other people that
[1:22:31] are right there with them and it's the
[1:22:33] blind leading the blind and when the
[1:22:34] blind lead the blind they both fall into
[1:22:36] the ditch there's no hope for them amen
[1:22:38] unless God would come he needs to
[1:22:40] experience Christ as Lord not just as
[1:22:42] Savior amen but Christianity Today is
[1:22:46] satisfied with salvation but they don't
[1:22:48] want full Redemption because full
[1:22:50] Redemption means we've got to die out
[1:22:52] and we've got to let go of our
[1:22:53] self-control amen we've got to let go of
[1:22:55] our self-will and we've got to say Lord
[1:22:58] I'll let you lead my life I'll do what
[1:23:00] you want me to do rather than what I
[1:23:01] want to do Paul would warn of what was
[1:23:04] coming and he would he would talk about
[1:23:05] the end times and I want you to consider
[1:23:07] as I read the first four verses here
[1:23:09] what kind of people we're talking about
[1:23:11] Paul says this he says this know also
[1:23:14] that in the last days church we in the
[1:23:17] last days it's the end of the end we're
[1:23:20] this close to it all being over
[1:23:23] that in the last days perilous times
[1:23:26] shall come dangerous
[1:23:28] times difficult times he says for men
[1:23:31] shall be lovers of their own selves
[1:23:33] Covetous boasters proud
[1:23:36] blasphemers to call that which is of god
[1:23:39] not of God and to call that which is not
[1:23:41] of God to be of God they'll swap around
[1:23:43] what it means to be of God he says
[1:23:45] there'll be disobedient to parents
[1:23:47] unthankful Unholy without natural
[1:23:50] affection truth Breakers false false
[1:23:52] accusers incontinent now we have a
[1:23:54] different meaning for incontinent today
[1:23:56] incontinent here you know what it means
[1:23:59] morally
[1:24:01] ambiguous the very thing that this man
[1:24:03] said God loves he says this is what
[1:24:05] they're going to be morally ambiguous
[1:24:08] this is not the nature of God he says
[1:24:10] they'll be fierce always fighting always
[1:24:13] getting riled
[1:24:14] up always on a cause despisers of those
[1:24:19] that are good they find it laughable
[1:24:22] with supposed Christians
[1:24:24] think he says they'll be traitors heady
[1:24:28] high-minded that word high-m minded
[1:24:29] means inflated with
[1:24:31] self-conceit and they'll be lovers of
[1:24:33] Pleasures more than lovers of God now I
[1:24:36] read all of that and I'm going to ask a
[1:24:38] question don't answer it answer it in
[1:24:39] your head who are the people he's
[1:24:41] talking about
[1:24:44] here oh we go right to our unsaved
[1:24:47] co-workers or or atheists or or obvious
[1:24:50] Sinners right people of this world that
[1:24:53] don't know Christ that's where our
[1:24:55] that's where our mind would go isn't it
[1:24:58] but we read verse 5 and it says having a
[1:25:00] form of godliness but denying the power
[1:25:03] thereof from such turn away these are
[1:25:07] believers professing Christians here a
[1:25:10] form of
[1:25:11] godliness they've got something but it's
[1:25:14] not the whole thing it's not the real
[1:25:15] thing it says but they deny the power
[1:25:17] thereof it says turn away from them be
[1:25:19] separate from them don't spend your time
[1:25:21] with them you want a perfect example of
[1:25:23] this it was Lot remember Abraham's
[1:25:25] nephew lot they came to a place where
[1:25:28] they had so much that their people were
[1:25:30] fighting and so Abraham said let's not
[1:25:32] fight you pick where you want to live
[1:25:34] and I'll take whatever you don't want
[1:25:36] and so L looked toward the wellwater PLS
[1:25:38] of of Sodom and Gomorrah and he saw that
[1:25:40] there was lots of food and lots of
[1:25:42] pasture lots of wealth there was a
[1:25:44] walled City there and he says I'm going
[1:25:46] to take that and the scripture says that
[1:25:48] lot goes to Sodom and the actions of
[1:25:51] Sodom
[1:25:53] vexed his righteous
[1:25:55] soul but you know what it didn't Vex it
[1:25:58] enough to make him
[1:26:00] leave why a form of godliness but not
[1:26:04] willing to have the whole thing he was
[1:26:07] it was uncomfortable for him but he was
[1:26:09] willing to put up with it for the what
[1:26:11] the pleasures that he got there for the
[1:26:14] safety for the Assurance for the wealth
[1:26:16] that brought him for the influence he
[1:26:18] was a man in the gate he was one of the
[1:26:19] city officials he rose up in politics he
[1:26:22] made a name for himself by
[1:26:25] compromise so these people have a form
[1:26:28] of godliness but they deny the power
[1:26:31] thereof amen there are people that go to
[1:26:32] church they're preachers they're
[1:26:34] professing Christians they're people
[1:26:36] associated with the Bible they have a
[1:26:37] godliness of sorts they have a
[1:26:39] profession of sorts they Proclaim an
[1:26:41] experience of
[1:26:43] Christ
[1:26:45] but they don't have what the word says
[1:26:48] they're supposed to have they don't live
[1:26:51] by the word
[1:26:53] they have a little experience but they
[1:26:55] still have a lot of self amen they have
[1:26:58] a religious spirit but they don't have
[1:27:01] overcoming power in their day-to-day
[1:27:03] Life to Live what the word says we're
[1:27:04] supposed to live that's what it says
[1:27:06] they deny the power thereof and what is
[1:27:09] the denying the power thereof they say
[1:27:11] the Holy Ghost is not what it was it was
[1:27:14] only for the disciples it was only for
[1:27:15] the apostles well that's a lie cuz there
[1:27:17] was 120 in the upper room and they
[1:27:18] weren't all Apostles and they weren't
[1:27:20] all men and they weren't all preachers
[1:27:21] there there was women up there
[1:27:24] too there were men that weren't
[1:27:25] preachers the holy spirit is for
[1:27:27] everyone but they say they deny the
[1:27:29] power thereof it doesn't have the same
[1:27:31] effect it used to amen and what happens
[1:27:35] is they can't live above sin they can't
[1:27:37] live above the world they can't live
[1:27:39] above self they can't be led by God
[1:27:41] because they're still stuck in
[1:27:42] themselves amen they talk a lot but
[1:27:44] their life doesn't reflect the power of
[1:27:46] the Living Word and so they're
[1:27:47] unconcerned by what's happening in their
[1:27:49] lives like I said today the word
[1:27:51] Christian has lost all meaning because
[1:27:53] anybody can be a Christian and do
[1:27:55] anything why because they have a form of
[1:27:57] godliness but they deny the power of the
[1:27:59] full word in their lives amen they deny
[1:28:01] the changing power of God by the Holy
[1:28:03] Spirit to make the word live in their
[1:28:06] own life that's what it is they
[1:28:09] eliminate the promises of God they
[1:28:11] eliminate the the supernatural they
[1:28:13] eliminate the power of God the very
[1:28:14] Prophecies of this word because they put
[1:28:16] it on another person or or another day
[1:28:18] or say it's not even in effect anymore
[1:28:20] they take the power out of the word of
[1:28:23] God they may have been Justified they
[1:28:25] may have had an experience where they
[1:28:27] repented of their sins but to repent
[1:28:29] doesn't mean to say I'm sorry it means
[1:28:30] to act sorry to change the way you're
[1:28:33] living so if you haven't changed your
[1:28:34] life since you repented you didn't
[1:28:36] repent and so there is no remission of
[1:28:39] sins where there's no repentance you're
[1:28:41] supposed to change the way you're
[1:28:43] walking you're supposed to change the
[1:28:44] way you're living not just the way you
[1:28:46] talk so where there's no repentance How
[1:28:48] can there be a remission of sins how can
[1:28:50] they truly be forgiven they're fooling
[1:28:52] themselves this man is fooling
[1:28:56] himself it says for this sort this sort
[1:28:59] of people are they which creep into
[1:29:01] houses and Lead captive silly women I'm
[1:29:05] not picking on women here women in the
[1:29:06] scripture represents a
[1:29:08] church this is talking about churches
[1:29:10] this is talking about people that go to
[1:29:11] church it's talking about denominations
[1:29:13] it's talking about organized religion
[1:29:16] where these men will come in and they'll
[1:29:17] deny the full power of the word they'll
[1:29:19] only preach their portion and they'll
[1:29:21] put a period behind it and God can't be
[1:29:23] in there because God is the whole word
[1:29:25] he's not just a part of the word it says
[1:29:27] they'll lead captive silly women they'll
[1:29:29] keep let lead captive they'll put in
[1:29:31] bondage people that go to church Laden
[1:29:34] with sins and led away with divers lusts
[1:29:37] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:29:40] the knowledge of the truth it's all in
[1:29:42] their head what they have and it's
[1:29:43] either wrong or it's intellectual and it
[1:29:45] never drops down into the heart it's
[1:29:47] never quickened by the Holy
[1:29:49] Spirit listen to this quotes as we start
[1:29:51] to
[1:29:52] close down here he says now did you
[1:29:54] notice it's just like a man that says
[1:29:56] I'm going to refuse to believe that the
[1:29:58] sun is shining I won't have nothing else
[1:30:00] to do with the sun he closes his eyes
[1:30:02] and goes down in the basement of his
[1:30:03] house and says I just refuse to know the
[1:30:05] sun is shining my little son Samuel he's
[1:30:08] almost po when he wants to hide from me
[1:30:11] you know what he
[1:30:14] does you can't see me
[1:30:16] Daddy I say just because you can't see
[1:30:19] me doesn't mean I can't see you
[1:30:22] just CU you say the sun isn't shining
[1:30:24] doesn't mean the sun isn't Shin just
[1:30:25] means you can't see the sun
[1:30:27] shining he says why yet why you say that
[1:30:30] man something will be mentally wrong
[1:30:31] with him why because it's obvious the
[1:30:33] sun is shining he says well a man that
[1:30:36] will reject Jesus Christ has the same
[1:30:37] grounds the holy spirit is more real
[1:30:40] than the sunshine the sun will fail but
[1:30:42] the Holy Spirit can't fail it doesn't
[1:30:44] only light for the sense of sight but it
[1:30:46] lights for the soul a light of Glory
[1:30:48] that leads us to God that projects
[1:30:51] Calvary to us and the sufferings of the
[1:30:53] Lord Jesus the oncoming judgment and the
[1:30:56] Escape for those that want to come
[1:30:58] that's what the holy spirit's doing
[1:30:59] remember the the spirit of God is
[1:31:00] striving with man to get them to see
[1:31:03] what's coming and to help them find a
[1:31:04] way of Escape but he says I'm not always
[1:31:07] going to strive with man there's going
[1:31:08] to be a day where the door shuts just
[1:31:10] like it did on the ark there's going to
[1:31:12] be a day when the door shuts and you can
[1:31:14] pound on it all you want but judgment is
[1:31:16] open Mercy's
[1:31:18] closed he says I'd rather be totally
[1:31:21] blind physically Ally and have my
[1:31:23] spiritual sight than to be totally blind
[1:31:25] spiritually and have my physical sight I
[1:31:27] want to have spiritual sight notice what
[1:31:29] would be wrong with that man then his
[1:31:31] friends would come and say Jim or
[1:31:32] whatever his name is you're wrong come
[1:31:34] out of that old dingy basement and musty
[1:31:37] and he would stand and say I tell you
[1:31:39] I'm satisfied where I am he doesn't want
[1:31:41] the welcome Sunshine he doesn't want its
[1:31:43] healing Rays he doesn't want its beauty
[1:31:45] and its warm for his life he say
[1:31:47] something will be wrong with the man as
[1:31:50] new finlanders we know what a it's like
[1:31:52] to go without the sun don't we we all
[1:31:54] have our pasty skin this morning why
[1:31:56] because we don't get sun but when it
[1:31:59] comes out what do we do we rush outside
[1:32:01] if it's windy we get down low in our
[1:32:03] decks where the wind can't hit us and we
[1:32:05] can still enjoy the sunshine don't we we
[1:32:07] love the sun he's saying if you ever
[1:32:10] experience the Holy Spirit you'll love
[1:32:11] it too it's real it's there it's
[1:32:14] available but if you shut yourself off
[1:32:17] from opportunity you'll never get it
[1:32:19] you'll never get the benefits of it he
[1:32:22] says so is the man or woman who wants to
[1:32:24] stay in this dingy world shut up in the
[1:32:26] musty sin of unbelief and saying the
[1:32:28] days of Miracle are are passed there's
[1:32:30] no such thing as Divine Healing there is
[1:32:32] no Holy Ghost he says it's because
[1:32:34] you're refusing to come out of the must
[1:32:36] and the dens of the devil and of hell
[1:32:39] and of sin and of Pride you know it's
[1:32:41] hard to admit we've been
[1:32:42] fooled I've talked before in Texas how
[1:32:45] we had a pastor that was living a double
[1:32:47] life and it was the hardest thing to
[1:32:49] admit we'd been fooled but but it's the
[1:32:52] best thing we did because it kept us
[1:32:53] from ever getting fooled that way again
[1:32:55] why because we identified how we let him
[1:32:57] get away with it and it was because we
[1:32:59] did not compare his life to the word of
[1:33:02] God we let it go for the sake of a gift
[1:33:05] we let it go for the sake of the
[1:33:06] position and God taught me a lesson that
[1:33:09] I've never forgot and it's no matter how
[1:33:10] good the gift gift is if the life
[1:33:12] doesn't line up with the scripture get
[1:33:14] that man out of the pulpit amen you do
[1:33:18] that for me if I ever get out of line
[1:33:21] get me out
[1:33:22] out this is what we follow not a man not
[1:33:26] a gift not a Ministry I had to admit I
[1:33:29] was wrong and I had to admit I got
[1:33:31] fooled and I had to see where I got
[1:33:33] fooled so I could correct it and it's
[1:33:34] only the grace of God that that didn't
[1:33:36] burn me and cause me to get hurt and
[1:33:39] offended and walk away from it all but
[1:33:41] rather to learn the lesson and help
[1:33:43] others and teach the same thing when I
[1:33:44] had the
[1:33:45] opportunity he says finally if he
[1:33:47] doesn't get the sunlight he turns pale
[1:33:49] he gets real pale sickness sits in on
[1:33:51] him that's the M what's the matter with
[1:33:53] the world today what that's what's the
[1:33:54] matter with most of our churches today
[1:33:56] we're becoming anemic we need a blood
[1:33:59] transfusion he says we're pale because
[1:34:01] we are failing our spiritual health is
[1:34:03] failing us we don't have the Zeal no
[1:34:05] more to hunt souls to warm people to get
[1:34:08] our neighbors to get our friends the
[1:34:09] Milkman the paper boy whatever it is to
[1:34:12] get someone to the Lord Jesus we're pale
[1:34:14] we're failing to walk in the light which
[1:34:18] is our
[1:34:20] privilege if we've seen the light of the
[1:34:22] word of God if we've seen the light of
[1:34:24] the truth for this hour and we don't
[1:34:25] walk in it we are missing out on our
[1:34:28] privileges Prophet God would say we're
[1:34:30] living below our
[1:34:31] privileges that's why we read our Bible
[1:34:33] and pray every day so we can see where
[1:34:36] God is working and moving and the
[1:34:38] answers he has for our life he says
[1:34:40] we're failing to believe in the health
[1:34:42] of God by Divine
[1:34:44] Healing you can live in artificial light
[1:34:46] all your life but it won't give you what
[1:34:48] the sun gives you and in the end you'll
[1:34:51] become sicker and sicker and sicker why
[1:34:54] because we need what that son has for us
[1:34:56] how did these people get in such a
[1:34:58] condition they didn't walk in the full
[1:35:00] truth of God's word they picked and
[1:35:03] chose the scripture says that in that
[1:35:05] day they'll they'll they'll they'll draw
[1:35:06] to themselves they'll Heap they'll
[1:35:08] gather a bunch of teachers that tell
[1:35:10] them what they want to
[1:35:12] hear and if all you hear is what you
[1:35:14] want to hear how you ever going to
[1:35:16] grow how you ever going to change cuz
[1:35:19] all they'll do is Pat you on the back
[1:35:21] and say you're good you're good you're
[1:35:22] good don't worry about this don't worry
[1:35:24] about that Prosperity gospels influence
[1:35:27] gospels come to church Gospels it has
[1:35:30] nothing to do with God's trying to do
[1:35:32] amen what do they do they come and they
[1:35:34] try and accept the free portion of
[1:35:35] Calvary and they neglect the dying out
[1:35:37] to self that comes with full Redemption
[1:35:40] Amen to be born again Jesus said there
[1:35:43] has to be a death he says you've got to
[1:35:46] be born again not just accept the work
[1:35:48] of Calvary but you've got to be born
[1:35:50] again baptism doesn't make us born again
[1:35:53] it's symbolic of a process that we do in
[1:35:55] ourselves we die out we let go of the
[1:35:59] steering wheel we let go of self-control
[1:36:01] and we have to choose to do that we have
[1:36:03] to choose to say I'll let this govern my
[1:36:05] life rather than what I feel in
[1:36:08] here that means we need a nature change
[1:36:11] because our nature is resistive to the
[1:36:12] word of God prophet of God said if he
[1:36:15] ever pulls on you he says it's the
[1:36:18] greatest thing you'll ever have is when
[1:36:21] something in your heart says I want to
[1:36:23] live like that cuz not everybody gets it
[1:36:26] not everybody has it not everybody has a
[1:36:28] response inside of
[1:36:30] here
[1:36:32] amen we need to realize our mind our
[1:36:35] nature our spirit our very soul is
[1:36:37] Tainted and we need God to do a work
[1:36:40] inside of our Lives you know sometimes
[1:36:41] we look at the mess we're in and we say
[1:36:44] how can we get out of it ever been
[1:36:47] there how can God make something good
[1:36:49] out of this mess how can God get me out
[1:36:51] out of this pit how can God get me out
[1:36:52] of this bondage how can God get me out
[1:36:54] of this
[1:36:55] addiction we say it's too far gone or
[1:36:59] maybe today we say well I'm I'm doing
[1:37:02] good but we look at our kids we look at
[1:37:04] our relatives we look at loved ones we
[1:37:05] look at colleagues and say but them how
[1:37:08] is that ever going to work listen Saul
[1:37:12] was killing
[1:37:14] Christians and God turned him into the
[1:37:16] prophet for the
[1:37:18] Gentiles that's what God can do
[1:37:22] he can turn a sinner into a
[1:37:25] saint listen to this I was reading this
[1:37:27] in my devotions the other morning I
[1:37:28] underlined it and I just had a wonderful
[1:37:30] moment of worship and
[1:37:32] praise I love the way God
[1:37:36] provides he knows how to do
[1:37:38] it and his ways are so much greater than
[1:37:42] ours he it's a whole other level than
[1:37:46] what we could ever ask or think but I
[1:37:48] was reading this in Romans 5 it said
[1:37:50] more over the law entered that the
[1:37:53] offense might abound unless we have a
[1:37:55] law that says something is wrong you're
[1:37:57] never wrong unless we have a law that
[1:38:00] says you can't drive over
[1:38:02] 50 then you can drive any speed you want
[1:38:04] and you're not contrary to the law
[1:38:06] there's no offense without the law the
[1:38:08] Bible says that until the law came we
[1:38:10] couldn't be we couldn't be judged for
[1:38:12] our
[1:38:14] sin that's why Abraham could live the
[1:38:16] way he did and God could work with him
[1:38:17] the way he did the law wasn't given but
[1:38:20] as soon as Moses comes and the law is
[1:38:21] given now the people are held
[1:38:23] accountable for it so God says the law
[1:38:25] comes that sin May abound that the
[1:38:28] offense might abound so that the the the
[1:38:30] the the the wrongs can become big become
[1:38:34] obvious
[1:38:36] amen by the law we're judged and were
[1:38:38] determined to be worthy of death but
[1:38:40] listen to this but where sin abounded
[1:38:43] Grace did much more abound so that means
[1:38:47] if your sin is here God's grace is here
[1:38:49] if your sin is here God's Grace is here
[1:38:51] it doesn't matter how much sin you have
[1:38:53] it doesn't matter how big the mess is
[1:38:55] God's grace is greater than what you can
[1:38:56] mess up amen so if you're a liar if
[1:38:58] you're a cheat if you're a homosexual if
[1:39:00] you're a fornicator if you're whatever
[1:39:02] it might be God says whatever you can do
[1:39:05] I can take you out of it however bad you
[1:39:07] can get my goodness is far greater than
[1:39:09] your bad whatever you get your mess into
[1:39:12] I can untie all the
[1:39:15] knots I think it was Alexander the Great
[1:39:17] went to this place and they had this big
[1:39:20] knot was it the Georgia notot I'm not
[1:39:22] sure and they had this great knot and
[1:39:24] they said whoever undo this
[1:39:27] knot it was a prophecy that was given
[1:39:29] you know the way they do it then that
[1:39:31] that that's the great king and everybody
[1:39:34] had tried on doing that KN for a long
[1:39:36] long time you know what Alexander the
[1:39:38] Great did he came up he took a sword and
[1:39:42] went
[1:39:44] done that's it everybody was trying to
[1:39:47] do it their way he said I just need to
[1:39:48] get rid of the KN that was it that's
[1:39:51] what God does we think we can get things
[1:39:54] so knotted and so Twisted impossible to
[1:39:57] untangle and God just says done got
[1:40:01] something else for me he can do it in
[1:40:03] his sleep except he doesn't
[1:40:05] sleep it's nothing to
[1:40:07] God whatever our mess is his grace his
[1:40:11] unmar favor can top it every single
[1:40:16] time what does this Grace look like see
[1:40:19] we're we're we're powerless to change
[1:40:22] ourselves there's nothing good in us
[1:40:24] there's no Purity in us there's there's
[1:40:26] there there's no discipline that can
[1:40:27] take us to this path of righteousness
[1:40:29] and Holiness amen we're in the age of
[1:40:31] we're in the season of New Year's
[1:40:33] resolutions and 99% of them are probably
[1:40:35] broken already 14 days in we can't
[1:40:39] change ourselves we can't make ourselves
[1:40:41] better we can't make ourselves like God
[1:40:42] we can't redeem ourselves we can't bring
[1:40:44] us into his presence amen people stop
[1:40:47] with forgiveness of sins but they keep
[1:40:49] on living a life that's
[1:40:52] unchanged claiming a change but there is
[1:40:54] no change and they slip right back into
[1:40:57] it what they were always doing that's
[1:41:00] not the act of God that's not the work
[1:41:01] of God God wants to change us into the
[1:41:04] original image again he wants to take
[1:41:06] that broken image and turn it back into
[1:41:08] the original I want to show you what
[1:41:10] this Grace looks
[1:41:12] like this is the process of
[1:41:15] Grace he says then will I sprinkle clean
[1:41:18] water upon you and you shall be clean
[1:41:22] this isn't sprinkling the Catholic
[1:41:24] Church sprinkles that's not what he's
[1:41:26] talking about Paul would say it's by the
[1:41:28] washing of Water by the word of God
[1:41:32] that's how he washes us the water the
[1:41:35] the natural water when we baptizing
[1:41:37] these things it's just a symbol of what
[1:41:38] this word is supposed to be doing that
[1:41:40] as we read it it changes Our Lives amen
[1:41:42] by the Holy Spirit grabbing onto it he
[1:41:45] says that you shall be clean from all
[1:41:47] your filthiness and from all your Idols
[1:41:49] will I cleanse you and that's justif
[1:41:50] ification that's the finished work of
[1:41:52] Calvary where the blood cleanses us from
[1:41:54] sin but watch this see that's not enough
[1:41:56] he says a new heart also will I give you
[1:42:00] and a new spirit will I put within you
[1:42:02] and I will take away the Stony heart out
[1:42:04] of your flesh and will give you a heart
[1:42:06] of Flesh a soft heart so we need a new
[1:42:08] heart because one that has to be
[1:42:10] inclined towards God our natural one's
[1:42:13] not that way amen we're hard towards God
[1:42:15] so he gives us a spirit that can get
[1:42:17] along with his Spirit an attitude a
[1:42:19] receptive a approach that God can come
[1:42:22] into because otherwise we don't want to
[1:42:25] be around God because what we're fallen
[1:42:28] in sin like Adam and Eve were ashamed
[1:42:30] we're unworthy to come into these things
[1:42:32] amen but what happens is he gives us a
[1:42:34] new heart a new spirit and now we can
[1:42:36] really become tender towards the things
[1:42:37] of God we can be tender towards the word
[1:42:39] of God and what does it do it changes
[1:42:41] our desires and it sanctifies our life
[1:42:43] it takes out all the mil all the filth
[1:42:45] all the wrong habits and all the wrong
[1:42:47] desires and addictions and all these
[1:42:49] different things and it cleans us out
[1:42:51] and then when that's done then he says
[1:42:52] and I will put my spirit within you
[1:42:55] that's the Holy Spirit and it's in your
[1:42:56] soul he says' and I will cause you to
[1:42:58] walk in my statutes in other words I'll
[1:43:00] cause you to live the way my word says
[1:43:02] to
[1:43:03] live amen it says and you shall keep my
[1:43:06] judgments and do them so it's only in in
[1:43:09] verse 27 that we can actually live the
[1:43:11] Christian
[1:43:12] walk why because it's we sang it didn't
[1:43:14] we not by might not by power not by
[1:43:19] discipline not by desire but by my
[1:43:21] spirit by the spirit of the Living God
[1:43:23] inside of us that we can live these
[1:43:24] sorts of things
[1:43:27] amen what we have today is so broken in
[1:43:30] terms of the image of God because our
[1:43:32] opinion of ourselves is so high social
[1:43:35] media has has absolutely decimated any
[1:43:37] chance of humility that people have we
[1:43:39] all think we know all things for all
[1:43:42] people and we're out there running
[1:43:44] around sniping at this shooting off at
[1:43:46] that da da da D we think so much of
[1:43:48] ourselves amen we've become a law for
[1:43:50] ourselves amen and so we become powerful
[1:43:52] in our own eyes and we've forgotten that
[1:43:54] we need a redeemer that we've fallen
[1:43:56] from Grace we've fallen from our
[1:43:58] original position amen we don't think we
[1:44:00] need
[1:44:01] changing that's the problem is we we
[1:44:03] think it's okay to be the way we are
[1:44:05] what's the world saying today in the
[1:44:06] schools be who you are no I don't care
[1:44:10] if you're the best person or the worst
[1:44:11] person it's not going to matter in the
[1:44:12] end you got to become what Christ tells
[1:44:14] us to be good bad short tall fat skinny
[1:44:20] pop unpopular acne no acne nothing has
[1:44:23] nothing to do with it addict they living
[1:44:25] the cleanest moral life it matters not
[1:44:27] it's all in sin before God Amen our
[1:44:30] entire nature is destructive in the days
[1:44:33] of Noah God said the thoughts of men are
[1:44:35] evil continually his every imagination
[1:44:37] is evil but we're creative and you look
[1:44:39] at what technology has brought us you
[1:44:41] know in Edmonton minus 43 and they can
[1:44:43] stay warm in it they can stay
[1:44:45] comfortable that's what technology has
[1:44:47] brought us but we see that technology
[1:44:48] has destroyed the Fabrics of society
[1:44:51] it breaks up families and it's
[1:44:53] destroying the planet we're on our
[1:44:55] creation is destructive why because
[1:44:58] we're in sin now we're no longer in the
[1:45:00] image of God but we know what happened
[1:45:02] on the day of Pentecost was God came
[1:45:04] back to the Believers in the form of the
[1:45:06] Holy Spirit and that was to give us
[1:45:07] power to live power to live because
[1:45:11] before that the disciples they had power
[1:45:13] to cast out Devils they had powers to
[1:45:15] heal the sick they had great revelation
[1:45:18] of who Christ was and yet they still
[1:45:20] walked away from him when the times got
[1:45:21] tough and they went back to their old
[1:45:23] way of living Peter went back to fishing
[1:45:26] naked right ashamed lost but on the day
[1:45:31] of Pentecost Peter's changed and he's
[1:45:33] never the same again and he never has
[1:45:35] that fear anymore he's got resolve he's
[1:45:38] got commitment he's got drive to do what
[1:45:40] to preach the gospel has been told to
[1:45:42] amen and what was it in the day of
[1:45:44] Pentecost it was the grace of God
[1:45:46] pouring out on the people in the form of
[1:45:49] the holy spirit that would let them live
[1:45:50] a life like Christ did that's literally
[1:45:53] what we're supposed to do Paul said this
[1:45:55] as we're closing I'm on the last
[1:45:57] page he says I am crucified with
[1:46:01] Christ oh you're dead Paul he says no
[1:46:04] nevertheless I live but yet not I but
[1:46:06] Christ lives in me now watch this the
[1:46:09] life I live in the flesh the life I live
[1:46:11] in this body the day-to-day living that
[1:46:13] I have is by the faith of the Son of God
[1:46:16] who loved me and gave himself for
[1:46:18] me Paul says it's Christ living in me
[1:46:21] now it's not Paul it's not my desires
[1:46:23] it's not my mind it's not my my
[1:46:25] intuition but it's Christ that lives in
[1:46:27] me then he say in 2 Corinthians he says
[1:46:29] therefore If any man be in Christ in
[1:46:33] Christ then he is a new creature he's a
[1:46:37] new creation he says old things are
[1:46:40] passed away they're dead everything in
[1:46:44] my past is dead not just what I did but
[1:46:47] the way I thought the way I acted the
[1:46:48] things I loved the things I desired it's
[1:46:51] all gone he says behold all things are
[1:46:54] become
[1:46:55] new Everything's
[1:46:57] changed that's how you know when
[1:46:59] somebody has truly accepted Christ All
[1:47:02] Things become new there's a difference
[1:47:05] we can see it we can see it in our
[1:47:06] children they go from being churchgoers
[1:47:09] to
[1:47:10] Christians we can see it in our spouses
[1:47:12] we can see it in converts and that the
[1:47:14] difference that comes from just reading
[1:47:16] about it and trying to live it to being
[1:47:18] it when we're in Christ
[1:47:21] then we become him he's literally living
[1:47:24] through us then Paul would say in First
[1:47:26] Corinthians he says for by one Spirit
[1:47:28] are we all baptized into one body this
[1:47:31] isn't a this isn't joining a church it's
[1:47:34] not putting your name on the roles it's
[1:47:35] not you know reciting a catechism it's
[1:47:37] not repeating
[1:47:39] quotes he says by one Spirit the Holy
[1:47:41] Spirit we're baptized into one body
[1:47:44] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[1:47:45] we be Bond or free and have been all
[1:47:48] made to drink by one spirit
[1:47:50] amen the only way you get into
[1:47:54] heaven as a child of God is by the holy
[1:47:57] spirit in your life that's the token
[1:48:00] that's the key that's your access that's
[1:48:03] your ticket is the holy spirit in your
[1:48:05] soul that takes you all the way to the
[1:48:07] day of your full
[1:48:09] Redemption two more quotes the M
[1:48:11] musicians can come if they would says he
[1:48:14] that heareth my words and believeth on
[1:48:16] him that hath me that sent me has
[1:48:18] present tense everlasting life and shall
[1:48:21] not come to the Judgment but is pass
[1:48:22] from Death to life he said the holy
[1:48:25] spirit is an experience of being filled
[1:48:27] and indued with power for
[1:48:31] service he says but confession and
[1:48:33] receiving Christ is to have faith and
[1:48:35] make your confession and feel free that
[1:48:38] God has forgiven you of your sins see
[1:48:40] repentance in accepting the work of
[1:48:42] Calvary sets your conscience free so you
[1:48:44] don't have to worry about that now you
[1:48:46] can set your eyes on what he has for you
[1:48:49] he's taking care of what's behind you
[1:48:51] now he gives you an opportunity to step
[1:48:52] into what he has in front of you amen
[1:48:55] your conscience is free with the
[1:48:58] finished work of Calvary but self-will
[1:49:00] is still there and that's where the
[1:49:02] dying out has to has to come in because
[1:49:04] you got to let go and let the Holy
[1:49:06] Spirit take hold of your life amen we've
[1:49:09] been set free from our past but the
[1:49:10] future is still up to us and we can only
[1:49:13] do that by letting go and letting God
[1:49:14] step into our life amen it takes the
[1:49:16] Holy Spirit to make us a new creation a
[1:49:18] new creature in Christ we die out and
[1:49:20] then we live in newness of Life by the
[1:49:22] power of the Holy Spirit he says but as
[1:49:25] many as received him we can stand as
[1:49:27] many as received him to them gave he the
[1:49:29] power to become the offsprings of God he
[1:49:32] said I give them eternal life eternal
[1:49:35] life comes from the Greek word of Zoey
[1:49:38] Zoey is that Life Zoey is the life of
[1:49:40] God he says and if the life of God is
[1:49:43] living in you it produces a Godly life
[1:49:46] just as certain as I'm standing on this
[1:49:48] platform and a man that's got it got
[1:49:50] what the life of God living in him can
[1:49:52] no more perish than God can perish
[1:49:56] because God is in the
[1:49:58] man that chokes people today because
[1:50:01] we're so used to going to church and
[1:50:05] hearing a 15minute sermon that tells us
[1:50:07] everything's okay and we've got a full
[1:50:10] word of God that says he wants to come
[1:50:12] inside of you and
[1:50:13] live to produce the very words of this
[1:50:16] Bible in your day-to-day life that he
[1:50:20] can come into your families he can come
[1:50:22] into our jobs he can come into our
[1:50:24] thoughts he can take away our desires he
[1:50:27] can break the bondage that we have the
[1:50:29] things that tie us up
[1:50:32] everything we think well i' brother John
[1:50:34] I've got the Holy Ghost been a Believer
[1:50:37] for 40 years that doesn't mean we don't
[1:50:38] have chains that need broken that
[1:50:40] doesn't mean we don't have self-will
[1:50:42] still creeping in from time to time that
[1:50:44] doesn't mean that desires don't come cuz
[1:50:46] remember Satan's a good enemy if I can
[1:50:48] say one thing about Satan is that he's a
[1:50:49] good enemy
[1:50:50] amen he knows our
[1:50:52] weaknesses he knows how to access our
[1:50:55] lives he knows our proclivities he knows
[1:50:58] what this flesh
[1:51:00] wants but remember the scripture says
[1:51:02] greater is he that's in
[1:51:04] you than he that's in the world and the
[1:51:07] only way the greater is the greater is
[1:51:09] going to be in me is if it's by the holy
[1:51:10] spirit because in John klet of myself
[1:51:13] there's nothing that can defeat Satan
[1:51:15] and look at my life before Christ as
[1:51:18] much as you try and live a good life
[1:51:20] you're still letting in the rock and
[1:51:21] roll you're still looking at things
[1:51:23] you're still getting caught up in lust
[1:51:24] and all these different
[1:51:26] things it's all there the desire is
[1:51:29] there even the will but the power is
[1:51:33] not but when I gave my life to him what
[1:51:37] happened that changed in an instant a
[1:51:41] literal instant and All Things become
[1:51:44] new and the thing which you could not
[1:51:47] defeat all of a sudden the battles is
[1:51:50] over victory's
[1:51:52] won set
[1:51:54] free and now I can walk every day and
[1:51:58] then sometimes we get worned out worn
[1:52:01] down stressed out and Satan will slide
[1:52:05] something in and we trip up don't
[1:52:07] we but you know what I've got a blood
[1:52:10] that covers
[1:52:12] me and I go and I say Lord I'm sorry I'm
[1:52:16] not up here as a preacher trying to
[1:52:17] pretend I'm perfect by no means
[1:52:20] any Christian that tells you their
[1:52:22] perfect day today is a
[1:52:24] liar but through his
[1:52:27] blood we didn't do
[1:52:29] it that's the work of the grace of the
[1:52:31] blood of Jesus Christ is that it doesn't
[1:52:33] just cover our sins it erases them and
[1:52:37] that's the freedom to walk day by day
[1:52:39] the freedom to grow the freedom to
[1:52:41] mature the freedom to step into the
[1:52:43] promises of God is because my conscience
[1:52:45] doesn't bother me anymore and I can go
[1:52:47] into his presence day after day after
[1:52:49] after day after day and he can renew me
[1:52:53] and he can refresh me and he can
[1:52:54] strengthen me and he can give me what I
[1:52:56] have need of for every single day amen
[1:52:59] amen God bless you let's bow our
[1:53:01] heads Heavenly
[1:53:05] Father Lord your word is so rich for
[1:53:10] us Lord your thought towards us are for
[1:53:13] good and not of evil Lord to bring us to
[1:53:16] an expected end to to bring us to a sure
[1:53:18] thing
[1:53:20] and Lord yet this flesh desires control
[1:53:23] Lord it desires to do its own
[1:53:26] thing Lord It Wants What It sees It
[1:53:28] Wants What It Feels Lord but there's an
[1:53:31] answer that can come in the soul of a
[1:53:33] man or a woman and it can set them free
[1:53:35] from those things and Lord no matter
[1:53:37] where we're at this morning Lord young
[1:53:39] to old experienced or never experienced
[1:53:42] you in the first place Lord we know
[1:53:44] there's a freedom that can come Lord
[1:53:46] that there's chains that can be broken
[1:53:49] Lord that there's victories to be had
[1:53:51] Lord and it's by standing on the word of
[1:53:53] God and laying all other things aside
[1:53:56] Lord would you help us to put our faith
[1:53:57] in you Lord help us to trust you day by
[1:54:00] day help us to seek you early Lord the
[1:54:02] first thing we do let us go to your word

[1:54:06] in prayer and say what would you have to
[1:54:08] say Lord laying all thoughts and
[1:54:09] feelings
[1:54:11] aside Lord even as Paul said laying
[1:54:13] aside those things which are behind I
[1:54:15] press toward the mark Lord we press
[1:54:18] towards the prize of the high calling in
[1:54:20] Jesus Christ Lord a changing of our
[1:54:22] bodies where we can go to be with you in
[1:54:25] eternity Lord I pray your Holy Spirit
[1:54:27] would fill us even again this morning
[1:54:30] Lord that those that are in need of you
[1:54:32] never had you Lord that you would touch
[1:54:33] their hearts Lord for those of us that
[1:54:36] you've already blessed with your spirit
[1:54:38] Lord I pray you fill us a new Lord fill
[1:54:40] us up to overflowing Lord that others
[1:54:42] could drink of you Lord that others
[1:54:44] could see you that others could haste
[1:54:45] and see that the Lord is good we pray
