Living Sacrifice the only source of life I hope is in the Lord forevermore tender verses [Music] [Music] [Music] from this time [Music] bring my soul out of prison then I may praise thy name the righteous shall Compass me about for Thou shalt deal bountifully with me so this Psalm is uh you know opposite one by David and this Psalm finds David in one of the darkest loneliest places that we see David you know it's everyone kind of goes to the typical you know his experience with Bathsheba or when he's in and Getty or when he's running from Absalom those are kind of the main ones that we see the most famous Psalms but this one is from a little no unknown place called The Cave of a doula and in this situation we see where David goes from hero to zero in a matter of from what it seems weeks and God literally just pulls the rug out from underneath him and what's great about David you know is that he's one of the best character studies in the Bible there's nearly 66 chapters about him more than anyone else other than Christ obviously and the beauty about David is that you can go through you know first and second Samuel first and second Kings and the Chronicles not the Kings but in Chronicles and you see the historical setting in the in the main story but then you get the added benefit of going to the Psalms and you see what's what's going on in his heart and you see how is he reacting to these situations and how is he thinking how is he pondering in his heart and you got a great 360 degree view of how how he's reacting how he's feeling and what it's like to be under that amount of Oppression because you look at David the amount that he went through God squeezed that man like no one else other than probably Abraham maybe I but I would probably put them in as a tie so with David it's just it's such a great character study like Dad did it for two years with his Sony School crew I did it for a year and a half each generation gets weaker and uh and the kids you know I think they liked it but you know it was a great great study because you're able to just kind of digest it slowly bit by bit and you see these things that you know these little stories that you normally don't hear about because everyone hears about Goliath and they hear about you know him taking Jerusalem and all that stuff but this story here is is really really jumped out of me probably the my favorite part about the whole Sunday school Sunday school study that we did because it's very very relatable because overall you know we all have these times of crushing these lonely places where God kind of takes all the feathers out of that nest and all you're left with is you and your thoughts as a lonely lonely place but you see the grace of God the God who is rich in Mercy when in these situations at his most seemingly brutal that's when his love is the sweetest and you see that with David is that he never ever gets bitter from any of these situations he just he grows each one and it's a rather than him hitting rock bottom as a trampoline leaping him forward you know so anyways we'll uh we'll go through it all and hopefully it'll be a blessing to y'all you know 66 chapters about him he did 73 of the 150 Psalms which is incredible you know in terms of how much of an impact in the Bible he had um so if we start at the beginning you know David is chosen at a young age so he was King by the time he was 30. and we know for a fact that he ran or was fleeing and hiding from Saul for about 15 years so if you go back 15 years that was when Goliath was happening that's when he was a commander in the arm of Israel so God anointed him at a very early age anywhere between 12 and 15. we all know a story that you know Israel chooses a king they do a horrible job at it you know on paper Saul was the best King ever you know he comes from the warrior tribe Benjamin you know he's a foot above everyone else the Bible literally calls him the most beautiful looking man in the Kingdom so and the Bible says that you can take it for a fact that it's it's for sure you know he's very eloquent but he turns out to be the worst one of the worst kings they've ever had to the point where at the end of it he's going to witches for counsel he is trying to kill his fellow believer blah blah blah you see how low some can go when they're trusting their own instincts so God let Israel choose first and it was definitely permissive will because you see what happens to them salt I think had a half chapter where he did good and literally from there it was all downhill and you look at him his base is for anything that he did was based in in the fear of the people fear of how he would look and everything was my control was Saul he had zero trust in God zero when anything was going wrong he would immediately do a knee-jerk he would try to take control the situation God literally ran the kingdom away from him so at this point God is now given Israel their fill and now he's going to give them someone who he's going to choose so Samuel sent to the house of Jesse and we all know the story that you know they go through all the sons Jesse doesn't even bother bringing David in because it's just there's no way and Samuel's thinking the same thing like these these kids are you know they're handsome they're strong they're you make a great king and God essentially slapped around a little bit and said you got to look at the heart not at the appearance because a good leader is not based on his qualifications it's based on his character and his character alone and is he reliant on God because you don't want someone to be new who's trusted in their own abilities because there's a limit to that there's always a limit to human ability and we see it Tom and Tom again in politics whatever maybe so God rejects each and every one of his brothers he anoints David and we see an immediate change with David it's quite incredible it gets help for any you know young person of whether or not they can make an impact and certainly you can make an impact when you're filled with the Holy Ghost you know because you look at David he he he now he's growing in stature and wisdom with the Holy Ghost you know God brings them testing and trials and you look at you know the lion and the bear like these are not insignificant you know foes you know if anyone came in today and said like I killed a bear today it'd be on the news you know it and that's the thing with us spiritually is that like you see these young young people they get filled the Holy Ghost and you see these strongholds falling these demons being cast out and the same thing in in in God's eyes these are lines and these are bears that these young people are are casting out so the power of the Holy Ghost you know program has a great quote where he talks about you know if the devil possessing someone with an evil spirit can make them strong as eight to nine people how much more does the Holy Spirit when they have full control can have an impact in that person's life and through them so it's just it behooves us to be able to like Lord let me get out of the way so you can have foreign and then there's no no guessing what God can do because we limit God in terms of what he can do he's a gentleman he will only do enough as you let him but if we can let him have his way there's no matter what we can do so what's great about Dave is that as soon as he's chosen you know we see him he he he goes straight back to the Sheepfold and what's remarkable about that is that he was literally just told by the prophet God which is the highest Spiritual Authority in the land at the time you are going to be king I have rejected salt you will be king next and with David it just there's literally no impact like he goes on like nothing's happened which shows that he had character to begin with because if you have been chosen as you know the greatest person in the land at that time it's a very rare person to be to not let it go to their head and to act on it because it's one thing you know most people if they're chosen especially today with no character around you know if someone's like you're going to be the president of the United States like they're going they're you know I'm going to talk to the people we're going to get married but you look here with David he just he goes straight back to his old job why because God doesn't tell him to do anything else go back to the Sheepfold and take care of your sheep and that's what David does and he serves there and he takes care of some the same dirty old smelly sheep that he's been staring at for however many years and the thing about David is that my favorite part about this is that you know we already see in David a servant's heart and the servantar is is a critical component in terms of Godly leadership because without a servant's heart you have a tyrant right and you look at Christ when Christ was you know here we saw him do the same thing he got down on his knees and he watched those those very smelly feet of the disciples without any complaint without any grumbling without anything because he knew that in order to lead you have to learn how to follow and if you're going to be served you've got to learn how to serve right so God requires you to start here before you were up here because characters is a victory not a gift okay and if you wanted to be effective in your leadership you got to learn how to serve in obscurity in silence without any congratulations without anyone saying thank you because that's the key to a servant's hurt is that can you do a job that no one else sees that no one else really you know cares about Faithfully can you do without Applause consistently for a long time or are you grumbling and complaining and whining about it because no one's noticing it and all that stuff that's the key to a servant's heart is that you can do it consistently no matter what because your goal is to make the one that you're serving look good not you look at David his objective was to make his father in Heaven look good not him and we see that consistently throughout his life so overall you know it's just if you can be faithful in the little you can he can grant you the responsibility to be faithful much but it starts with the little things you gotta be faithful in those little things because the foundation got to be strong in order for the rest of the house to be built so if you're not content with what the law that you have then are you neglecting the little things in your life and if you need neglect them God can't trust you with the bigger things so so he goes back here to the Sheepfold and then eventually his which is crazy to me like he's 14 or whatever and his reputation goes to solve King Saul's Court because it was King Saul's couriers and his servants that said you know we know he got an issue and but there's a kid there's a kid in Bethlehem that you know he's he's wise the stature and whatever he does it cause and prospers it and he'll be a good fit for you so Saul is like yeah sure bring one so Davis serves in in Saul's court for we don't really know how long it is and he's a blessing to Saul and eventually you know it's just it's solemn for a bit so when we come to Goliath you know Goliath is is is um up until then David's having the same type of Victory okay he's killing the line he's killing the bear when he gets a Goliath he's killing Goliath and everything is quick quick quick quick quick right so once he goes to physicists his brothers he does his job and then he hears Goliath taunting right and Goliath taunts Israel for where do I appointment there you go so Goliath comes out for 40 days to taunt Israel and no one comes out and 40 is interesting because the program says it represents Temptation Jesus spent 40 days in the wilderness his temptation Moses spent 40 days on Mount Sinai when God was given the Ten Commandments and Israelites made the golden calf it ran for 40 days and four nights during the flood and the Israelites took 40 days to spies out the land of Israel so Temptation here Goliath is representing that thing in your life that is it got boldness and it's coming out every day and saying you can't touch me there's nothing you can do about it and what God is doing is that behind the scenes you know everyone is frightened everyone's frightened about the Big Bad Wolf You Know It's Shouting and and brother says is that when the devil thinks he got you in a corner he gets he gets he gets cocky and the problem there is that when you get cocky you cross the line and that day Goliath there there was a warning that Goliath woke up and it was his last morning where he was going to taunt the children of Israel [Applause] and you look at us there's going to be a morning when that thing in your life is going to taunt you for the last time so God in his great Mercy you see the whole child the whole Army of Israel and they're they're quaking their boots you got big men you got Saul Saul is this big they say he was seven foot tall which is incredible and he's up in his tent hiding away but what God does God takes a a little Shepherd from one of the smallest towns of of Judah and what he's been doing is that behind the scenes he's been preparing this little boy in obscurity in relative silence and no one no one no one sees this happening all right so in the in in in the children of Israel's eyes it's hopeless there's nothing we can do we are going to be slaves it's over says who okay when we put a period behind the situation it's us putting a period behind the situation not God okay so when we put ourselves in a situation say this is it no it's not until God literally tells you this is your burden and this is your cross and you're gonna have to bear it that's when it's a period but until then we can hope and we can rest in the fact that God will arrive on the scene no matter how small or how insignificant that solution may look okay because you look at David you know the Bible you know calls him Ruddy and brother I'm disguises and he's at this little shrimp no one will be impressed by the side of him and he comes in and he's just he's in his path of Duty okay he's serving faithfully and he's in the path of Duty and he's not jumping out take care of the situation the situation comes to him okay and that's that's how it's supposed to happen right we're not supposed to be getting out of our you know getting out of our lane and getting out of our position in order to make things happen you stay in your position there is a protection within that position because God has told you this is your position and you stay there because you look at the children of Israel they each had a unique position in that land because they were built way up out of the land because when they were born that mother of each son of Jacob which in childbirth would scream at a name and that name had a prophecy over that and it was their legacy in each part of the land and to this day it's still the same so when you're in your position there is a strength that comes with it because you are not relying on your own strength you are tapping into God and he you're you're a conduit to him but if you get out of that you turn off the tap of Heaven so here's what Dave's doing David is in his line of duty he is Anointed he's been prepared and now he's ready and he doesn't know this okay little like more often now we don't see the potential inside of us only God sees the potential okay but it takes situations derive on the scene for us to step in and God goes you ready only he knows that so that's where you got to be ready you got to be instant in seasonal season and thank God for Grace because it doesn't you know for for the children of Israel it was it was a conditional Covenant where they had to uphold their end but with us we can't do it because no one can live the life and you look at the law no no one could do it no one did but for us it's an unconditional Covenant meaning that no matter what no matter where you're at it's never too late for one and then secondly there's always Grace for your mistakes the great the the the the greatest Victory is that even if you're falling are you falling forward okay because everything's going to fall no matter what your thing is and when you're over one thing God starts working on the next thing so the main thing is fight fight fight fight and that's that's the mark of the believer is he look at Abraham look at David they never gave up it was Joseph he never gave up each time it seemed like it was he was in a worse situation than before but God sees the end goal we don't so David comes on scene and he's put in a situation where he hears this Goliath speaking and I think Utah talked about where he the first thing wasn't how how tall is is this giant what kind of weapons is he is he wearing does he have any protection around him what's the what's what's the landscape around so I can sneak around and see if there's an angle I can get him at no the first thing that that David does is okay what's the reward for killing this guy as a 14 year old but the difference is that he's anointed for this purpose he's anointed for it the other men weren't and you can see it they weren't anointed for it so David says what's the reward and how dare this uncircumcised philistine put his finger against the children of God so like shamgar he's now going to claim his land right we know the story he you know he he's now talking to his brothers the brothers try to slap him down like typical older brothers do and uh you know there's no double meaning behind that I can assure you know he slapsing down David like any good believer should do ignores it and they bring to Salt Saul tries to discourage him tries to give him tries to get him to do it a different way and Dave's like I I don't trust what you're giving me it doesn't work I don't want to work with it I'd rather just trust God so he goes in kills Goliath cuts off his head everyone's Faith goes through the roof and they chase Goliath or not Goliath Goliath is now dead but they chase the Philistines up okay but the key the key caveat here is that King Saul's first reaction is praise the Lord he's like find out whose son this Stripling is that's literally word for word what he says find out who this the son of this Stripling is so Saul's it's sad for Saul but his first reaction was jealousy and envy rather than thank God for delivering me okay so uh next up you know he at this moment he becomes the instant National celebrity which is again another test of his character you know most people it will be you know all right ready for King and logically you could say that you know he showed he can Inspire men he can fight great goliaths and win he has you know great Charisma blah blah blah blah but God sees what David doesn't that Dave's not writing okay because God doesn't just want a normal King for Israel all the other nations had normal Kings okay and they come and go and they're cut throat and during that time especially you know they're conniving there are politickers and God didn't want that right he wanted someone who is Reliant on his leadership who would listen to him and would trust him so David at this point was didn't have that clearly so at this point David's trials are and his big victories kill and David's faith is high everything's great and what David doesn't see is that he is on the Mountaintop and he got a big long valley right in front of him right so um you know and he he could have he could have you know taken over the Kingdom at that point but he had the character to be able to to wait on God and that's the key thing there is can you wait for the promises of God or are you going to take manners in your own hands and go claim it yourself right because you look at Authority here Authority cannot be taken because if it's taken it's satanic but if it's given it's a seal of God's approval and God can bless it so even though he's anointed he has full right to take over that Kingdom he can't because God opens the doors not David okay and David was never never never willing ever to kick down that door because God tested him in that area look at how many times Saul was literally at his feet and David could just put the spear in and he could have the kingdom but David knew that the moment that he did that the same because whatever whatever measure you meet out will be meted out against you and if you begin the kingdom in blood it will end in blood and David is the only probably one of the few Kings in Israel that ever died of old age despite all he did because his ways please the Lord he was the only one that didn't die with a knife in his heart okay so the key is is that God knows when you're ready you don't know when you're ready give people around you especially don't know when you're ready it takes God's timing but and you'll know when it God's timing because not you orchestrating things and trying to maneuver and manipulating all that stuff God will open up that door when it's ready and it will be a double blessing if you wait for it so there's a great quote here um by Brother Brown and the Philadelphia Church age to wait for the Fulfillment of that word require patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he endured as seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience why if it fulfilled his word in the physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would become even more impatient with life and this is hard you know because more often not when we pray for situation or lay hands you want to see immediate results because we're taught you know you lay your hands upon the sick they shall recover and we want to see that instant but God has his own way let me show you this truth even more fully set forth Hebrews 11 7 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise the word of God offered up only his begotten son there it is Abraham was tried after he received the word of promised most think that as soon as we pray in Jesus name over the good Promises of God that there could not be a trial but here it says that Abraham was tried to receive the promise that is exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to Joseph until that time his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him God gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only impatience do we possess life may God help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of this six age learn patience we read the history of the lives of those great Christians what a contrast you see between their lives and ours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all about overcoming over patients and haste and that's the time before smartphones and computers and high-speed internet how much worse is it now so David at this point is learning patience he's learning how to wait is learning how to trust the name of the Lord so let's uh let's now turn to First Samuel 18 the review is over after half an hour oh boy all right let's turn to First Samuel 18 or you can just follow him here because I'm going to be skipping along so it's up to you so at this point um we're we're at the top of the Mountaintop Saul goes crazy and he tries to um essentially secured skewered David a bunch of times okay and Dave went out went out with us whoever Saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and Saul said him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all people and also in the sight of Soul servants and he came to pass as they came when David was turned from the slaughter of the Philistine that the women came out of all the cities the Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with taboris with joy and with instruments of music and the women answered one another as they played and said Saul has slain as thousands and David is ten thousands and Saul was very Roth and the same displeased him and he said they have ascribed on the day of ten thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and why can't he have more but the kingdom and Saul odd Dave I'd David from that day forward and it's hard to have a a song in your life because it's that requires patients when you're dealing with a difficult personality you can't do anything about and God's just using it as a as a grinding stone and those are the moments that you got you got to learn to give your problems to God because God's the only person that can Harden and soften the heart you know we can't we can't do that you can't fight fire with fire with people you got to let the God who created that heart this often hurt as he needs to because he has an ultimate purpose in it right so David or Saul tries to kill David with a javelin he tries to put David and Paul and David in an impossible situation with the Dowry from uh McCall or Michael or whatever her name was tries to get the Philistines to kill him and then he tries to get his servants and Jonathan to kill David right but David keeps on serving Faithfully no matter what and at this point you know I'm going to skip this one but Saul again finally tries to kill him again with a javelin and Dave's like I'm out of here all right so at this point you know we're at the um we're at the Apex of where David was in his climb in terms of Man's eyes he was a general in Saul's Army he was married to the wife of the king you know he was in the king's court you know he was famous he was a great warrior he had a maid in Man's eyes okay he was just a couple steps away from from the throne but at this point God says no I'm going to test you and I'm going to test you hard and I'm going to test you long because you need to be ready to be fit to rule okay because you know we'll skip that for now okay so uh let's go to First Samuel 20 verse 1 and David fled from naoth and Rema and came and said before Jonathan what have I done what is my iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he saketh my life and he said unto him God forbid thou shall not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will show it to me and why should my father hide this thing for me it is not so so if we skip down to the very bottom but as truly as the Lord liveth and as thy Soul liveth there is but a step between me and death and this is David saying this here that at this point I'm a hair's breath away from being killed by your dad right so we're no longer seeing the same faith that David had with Goliath he could handle the Philistine but he couldn't handle the king wanted to kill him okay so God's now dealing him a situation that he doesn't know how to deal with and what you're seeing now is that David was very strong in dealing with Goliath he was ready for that but then God says okay now I'm going to work on your Honda parts where you're nice and soft and you need to develop some strength there and David is totally he totally loses control he he starts you know we're going to see a very rapid Descent of David's uh objective thinking and ability to think rationally because he starts to do some kind of crazy things because God allowed a situation to come in from South that he wasn't expecting okay so at this point you know David is now fleeing from Saul at this point he's now lost his position in the army his wife is now gone Saul literally then gives his wife to another man and he David fled to the prophet Samuel and then he has a flee again because Saul's following him and you never see Samuel again okay so he lost his position his wife his access to the prophet and then after this he doesn't have any access to Jonathan's best friend and his only man inside the court on his behalf so Jonathan's now gone right so at this point we see David he's now starting to lose trust he's looking at a situation here because he's saying there's but a step between me and death what he's what he's doing now he's taking his eyes off the promise that hey I'm a king I'm going to be a king God promised it that means God's going to fulfill it and it doesn't matter what's happening to me God's going to make it happen so now he's starting to look at his situations and he's starting to Quake right so at this point self-preservation is kicking in and self-preservation is is that flight or fight Instinct that kicks in when we're in situations where we're scared we don't know how to react and you just want to do something and that's the worst thing you could do in situations like this because you want to more often not you're doing that decision out of fear and it's going to blow up and we see that with David so uh uh verse 4 then said Jonathan unto David whatsoever thy soul desireth I will do it even for thee and David said unto Jonathan behold tomorrow is the new moon and I should not fail to sit with the king at me but let me go that I might hide myself in the field until the third day at Even If thy father at all miss me then say David earnsly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his City for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family so this is a blatant line he's trying to get Jonathan to say tell your dad this so we can find out what he what how he's going to react so he's putting his best friend in a situation where he's going to lie and then we see after this David runs to um knob which is the city where the priests were and at this point David does the same thing he deceived the priest tells him the king hath commanded me a business and this is why I'm here and after this whole situation you know Saul does the unthinkable and says kill them all for they helped David and Saul killed all all the priests the whole city and he kills everything which is rare because it's all one time the Samo told him to kill everything it's all doesn't do it so David at this point officially hits rock bottom and this is when he goes to gath and he meets the the king of gath which his name is akish and verse 12 here in the middle and David laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of akish the king of death and he changed his behavior before them and feeding himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall upon his beard then said akeish unto his servants lo you see the man is mad wherefore then have you brought me him to me have I need a Madman that he have brought this fellow to play The Madman in my presence shall this fellow will come to my house so David at this point he's lost all these things and funny he loses his dignity he goes to the one place where his sworn enemy was Goliath he realizes how bad of a situation he's in now and has to do whatever he has to do to get out of that situation and he pretends to be insane and he's literally foaming at the mouth and she's like get him out of here and that's the grace of God to David because I would say there was a bounty on David's head in the city of gath okay so uh at this point David finally reaches the cave adulam and we see here in chapter 22 David therefore departed dance and escaped to the cave of dulham and this is where David is totally alone he had nothing left literally nothing all he has is a sword of Goliath and some bread from the city of Knob and that's it no one to help him he has no connections there's no hope Saul's right out his tail and he and Dave is now going through his first Valley of the shadow of death okay and think about the Valley of the shadow of death there's a reason why it says the Valley of the shadow of death and not the valley of death because there's a key difference between the two the shadow of death is just the mirror uh it feels like it's death but it's not death itself and we can be put in these situations where it feels like death is pressing and at the door but it's just a shadow it's just a big Bluff and all it is is God's saying no no no you're only going to I'll be allowed to frighten him you can't actually put your hands on them so Dave's now in a situation where he's feeling he's tasting death on every every corner and that's why we see you know Psalms like Psalm 23 come on the scene and other Psalms where you see this man is now learning how to be on the bottom okay and it's it's in the mud more often not where we learn character and how we learn how to trust God and because there's nothing else to trust like and that's the thing about the valley is that the valley is where you can't really see the Mountaintop is easy because you can see you're far away but once you're down in the valley you've got fog and you've got rain and you've got forest and you have all these things you can't see so you're losing the vision okay so that's why you can't walk by sight is because you're going to get lost whereas if you walk by faith faith is seen past all those obstacles and all those things and it's going to guide you one step at a time it's like diverse sin Isaiah that there will be a voice behind you say this is the way when you turn to the right when you turn to the left and it's going to guide you each step but it takes situations like that for our ear to get tuned to that because you know tons of comfort of comfort and prosperity are great and we praise the Lord for it but you get complacent and you get lazy and you get lazy really but it takes those times of where you're in the grindstone that you learn to not rely on this because it's failed you but it's those times where God is saying no okay it's enough you need to start trusting me and I will show you a better way than the way that you've been doing so at this point in the cave of Doom is where we just read the opening scripture of Psalms 142 and that's why we see in verse 3 he's saying when my spirit was overwhelmed Within Me you know verse four I looked on my right hand behold there was no man that would know me Refuge failed me no man cared for my soul this is a man who is alone who has no hope nothing and I cried unto the O Lord and I said Thou Art my refuge on my portion in the land of living attend unto my cry for him brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than I bring my soul out of prison then I might praise thy name the righteous shall Compass me about for thou shall deal bountifully with me after this point you know he's he's going to go through a valley and there's a great um quote well you know it's all right to be on the Mountaintop that's good but let me tell you your fruits will freeze up there at night and when the cold spell comes you lose all your fruit that's what happened now we put too much a Mountaintop experiences of dancing and shaking jump around instead of all night prayer meetings down in the valley of decision we have come down there and meet God and really pour out your life until something takes place we've grown fruits up there but the freeze kills it that's right every time it comes a little cool spell you got nothing to rest upon when the emotion dies down then the shout's all gone the noises seat and then where are you at the Temptation comes along then you can't take it and there's nothing wrong with the shouting and all that stuff but you can't you can't subsist on it you can't rely on it completely you got to learn how to trust God in the good times and in the bad times a good crop requires a wet season and a dry season too much rain in the drowns too much sun and it burns so we need to balance of both okay so the next thing here is you know God is got him in a position where he can finally work with them and you know we see we see her in this next quote that Professor by Perfect wheat is the cases with us that were not that we're too weak the cases were too strong we're just too strong that's all the thing of it is that we're too strong-headed that's right we're too strong in our head we know too much God wants to get that out of us that's right we're too strong we're too strong to yield to him and within the same message he talks about you got to lose if you want to do anything for God you got to lose the thought of human ability because it's only when you're weak you're going to be strong and you're going to be of use in the Kingdom so at this point what God is doing is that God is God has taken David and has gone crack and David is now in a position where he's going to listen and that's the difference here is that you know it was going to be hard for him to listen when he's in the king's court and everyone sings his Praises it's now in the cave that he can listen fully and he'd be willing to do what God tells him because there is no other recourse and sometimes God has got to get us in those situations right it feels like he's taking away everything there's nothing left there's no Fellowship you know everything in your life it seems like it's falling apart and what he's doing is that he's getting you to a situation where you'll finally yield because that's the thing about the human spirits that is strong like it's it's shockingly strong you see people and the amount of things they can go through and and endure without the Holy Ghost is incredible but God can't use those people because they're too stubborn and they're too proud God wants a people that are weak because then he can be strong on their behalf and he can be strong through them and they can finally be of use in the Kingdom so you know it was a lonely place in that cave and Brokenness is a lonely place to be in because you know a Brokenness can can be in it may not be you know everything in your life it could be in an area of your life it could be you know marriage problems it could be financial problems it could be you know you're on the verge of a new change or God's putting you in a new position or whatever or sickness and health and all that stuff whatever the situation is it's right for God to work on it and when God is putting his finger on that on that situation you know more often not we we start to freak out we start forgetting you know going to him we start trying to fix the situation ourselves and what we find is that in those situations we make a further mess of it no different than what David did but the big thing here is that God knew exactly how much pressure to apply to David for David to get into a position where he'd be willing to listen and obey God okay and God knows exactly how much pressure you're going to need for you to finally obey and it doesn't feel good Brokenness is not a nice place no one here enjoys being broken but there is no greater thing no greater thing because what it is is that it's break that process of being broken is not not only does it get rid of the bad but God also it produces life okay because those things that you didn't realize were inside of you that the potential of God that he placed me inside you is now being burst forth and the only thing that could burst it forth was that pressure and it's hard it's hard you know it's it must have been humiliating for David humiliation and shame is there are two very hard emotions to deal with because it's just it just it eats at you and with David you know he he went from being the the biggest hero to down to the biggest zero in a matter of that and at that point you you could very easily say David had full reason right to give up at that point and say there's no way that it's going to happen he's the furthest away from the throne he's ever been and it looks like a complete impossibility for what God or what David doesn't see is that God can turn a situation just like that but also got or David didn't know is that he was going to be in for a 15-year trial breaking him down and learning how to let God fight his battles for a turn rather than David's swinging the sword because for the next 15 years the only enemies he kills are the enemies that are attacking Israel not even Philistines for Pete's sake that's how bad David got to a point so same thing with us where you know we are put in situations where we're used to dealing with things a certain way and then God says okay you got to rely on me now you gotta rely on me to fix your problems and to fix your situations and that's the thing about faith is that faith is hard okay people like works because it's easy it's X Plus y equals z and you follow the same steps and you get the same output and it's nice and easy and everyone's having a great time whereas faith faith can lead you down strange paths faith can lead you down very lonely paths where you're going to have to do hard things and you're forced into position where you're going to have to say things that it's going to hurt your family or hurt your spouse or hurt your kids or your or whoever and it's a very lonely place and we've all been there where you you it's just you're put in situations where you're you have to choose between God and something else and God has to win every time because if you don't choose God and you're his good luck because he's going to find a way to get back to number one and you're going to have some scars at the end of it you won't be lost but you'll be hurting and we've all been there where it's just you don't put God first and he reminds you it's that chastening process and thank God for that chasing process because he's not going to have a bunch of spoiled brats as as kings and queens he's going to have a mature bride that has character knows how to rule so at this point you know it's uh you know it's like this quote here every time a wind hits a tree and shoves it back and forth it only loosens The Roots so it can grow deeper and get a better hold every time sickness strikes your home every time trial strikes your home every time the neighbor says something bad about you it's only shaking you loosening you up so you can get down and get a better hold on the Eternal Rock of God's unmovable word and that's how God does it he sends these trials to test you and to prove you to shake you up and give you a new hold and it's only through the trials that does it because we're lazy and we seek the path of least resistance and we're always wanting it as a flowery bed of ease but God is a good tutor and he has an obligation to you to tutor you so it's during these times where he's identified an area of life that this has gone on far too long and it could be you know it could be something that's afflicting you or it could be a bad habit or would be setting sin or whatever it may be but when there comes a point where God says enough is enough then God starts applying that pressure and don't be surprised when God starts sending in the winds he starts sending in all these things because you look at Job the same thing out of nowhere boom it starts happening and same thing with David but it's it's it's it's God who is rich in his Mercy that does it it's that tender hand of Jehovah it doesn't feel tender at the time it's only in hindsight when you're through it that you see and recognize the tender hand of Jehovah um another great quote here is in the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight and Pull and hurry and know if if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised any claim that he's given is yours and by letting go and letting God and once you release your hands in the situation you watch how quickly God will move because God's a gentleman he will wait until you give him permission and when he's when you're in a situation where it's just it's hopeless and it seems nothing is moving nothing's giving away that's that's when God is a specialist because he specializes in the impossible and he relishes The Impossible I feel because he loves to come in a scene is no different than you know Jesus walking on that water out to the disciples it's shown them I have power over everything and like you can trust me to take care of everything and that's the thing here is that when we're putting those hopeless situations we have to let God take control because once he starts moving then he starts restoring and the amazing thing about God's restoration is that it's complete it's whole and it's perfect so the hard part about that place of Brokenness is that it feels painful it doesn't feel Fair it doesn't feel right I'm a Child of God why am I going through this why isn't he listening to me why is he not answering my prayers because it's those times of Silence that's really really hard for a Believer to just sit back and wait because you want to do something but you got to have the faith to be able to hold on and realize that it's in that time of waiting that endurance is being built because with possess with patients possessing your souls the thing to recognize is God's gentle it doesn't feel gentle to us but he knows just how far to take your trial without hurting you okay because we think you know it's he's going to deform us it's going to be scars all these things but you'll come through as gold so if you look at you know brief Segway the the Olive Tree is a really interesting study because you look in scripture it's you see it throughout scripture you have the Olive Branch with um Noah's Ark and you see you know the two olive trees in Zechariah and you see the the role of oil and anointing the Kings and all that stuff and in Romans Paul talks about how you know that Gentile that Wild Olive Branch is grafted into the Olive Tree so when you look at the the olive it's and it's also typed as a holy spirit that's the main one Dollar Tree is is one of the most resistant species of trees is extremely strong it can live for up to a thousand years it can withstand freezing you can't kill it the only way to kill an olive tree is by uprooting it uh you gotta it has to be ripped out of place destroyed and uprooted otherwise it will continue to keep growing back every time no matter what so you have to get rid of the whole root system in order for that olive tree to finally die um they're known for deeply embedding their Roots into the ground uh but especially during the the process of turning olives into olive oil it's an extremely labor-intensive process and it's very nuanced okay so you got to first know when to harvest the olives because if you do too early the oil will be bitter and if you do it too late it's going to be Rancid so you gotta wait for the right time to harvest those olives and when they're harvested they're hers rocks and the only way for that for that oil to come out is for it to go through the crushing okay and you know it's it only takes it takes people with experience and with a lot of knowledge to be able to do that harvesting process in the processing process correctly so in terms of all production the first step was to crush the olives using a crushing stone or a millstone as you see here into a paste and during that process the the the firmer had to be really careful how closely this big Stone here is to this because if it does it too close to the olives it's going to crush the inner nut and that internet will make the whole thing bitter and if it doesn't do high enough it's not going to crush it the the oil is not going to come out so then the next thing is that once it's it's crushed it's turned to a paste and that paste is collected into baskets and those baskets are stacked and put into this press and the amount of pressure that that's putting on those baskets is insane it's like 5 900 square inches or something or pounds per square inch insane amount of pressure and every bit of oil that's in there is going to come out but the key thing here is that you got to watch the Heat because if the Heat's too high it starts creating they call them free radicals and it's these chemicals that can turn the batch and what's crazy about those chemicals is that if they get into the batch they're so destructive it actually causes cell aging and even cancer if you don't watch it so you got to be really careful about how much temperature or how hot the temperature gets during that process and then the final thing is that the oil is poured into containers where the oil separates from the water because the water the water is the waste and then it's stored to settle and during that process of settling it eliminates the bitter Aromas in the oil and then it it creates sweet and pleasant Aromas and then the end product is this golden beautiful olive oil which the ancient Greeks Greeks called Liquid Gold and it's it's it's an amazing SuperFood the health benefits are amazing because it's it reduces stroke protects against heart disease reduces risk of diabetes improves bone health aids weight loss protects against cancer has antibacterial properties and reduces the risk of Alzheimer's and arthritis it covers everything okay so at the Last Supper Jesus goes to a place called the Mount of Olives to pray and specifically he goes to the government of Gethsemane and the Hebrew word for oil press is Gethsemane okay so Christ's body may have been torn apart on the cross but his Spirit was crushed in that Garden and we see here see it takes a crucifixion it takes a crushing of the flower to bring perfume from it takes a crushing of a life to get the best out of it that there is that's the reason Jesus had to be crushed to bring forth what he was he could not stand before the crucifixion and say all powers in heavens and earth is given unto my hands but after the crucifixion he can stand and say all powers in heavens and earth is given unto my hand but what did it do it taken crucifixion first and look at what that released what was what was released on Calvary eternal life and that bomb of Gilead was released from him that soothes all your diseases you look at that olive oil it it helps everything in your human body and the same thing with Christ when he was crushed it squeezed out that eternal life that's going to soothe every everything that's going to come and infect you no matter what the disease is the HARP issue emotional problems whatever may be that crushing produced Your solution okay so when we look at it as Christ was broken so are we broken and we may go into these trials hard like olives but that crushing is what's required to get the potential out of you and God knows how close those two stones have to be he knows just enough what those trials are required he knows how close how close to the line he can get to squeeze the most potential out of you without making you bitter okay and he knows how far he can go without crushing you without without giving you you know things that's going to kill you because at the moment it feels like it's more far more than we can bear but God knows how much you can bear because he sees the end he sees the benefit of it you look at dad you look at how dead Crush Mom and Dad them coming into the message and stuff you look at the the the the ripple effect of a decision you look the the the effect of of a life being pressed and it's we won't see how much of an impact Our Lives will have on other people and other things I believe until we get it on the other side because it's during these processes it's during these times of crushing that our life is most beneficial beneficial to others because if the olive is no good to anyone it can't even be eaten until it allows the farmer to put it through that crushing process so same thing with our lives like we we can't hold on to that gift that precious gift within us and let no one else partake of it if we want to be any used to the body or the kingdom of God we have to yield ourselves to that crushing we have to trust the one who allows the crushing and it's hard it's hard you know he puts you through situations where you feel like Christ on the cross like why have you forsaken me this hurts or you're allowing it so we can rest assured that the trial will not destroy but will unleash the potential locked inside of you we see here in second Corinthians but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be manifest in our body for we which live are always deliver unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our moral flesh so then death worketh in US but life in you so if you go back to David he's in the cave of adulam and we see here in verse one and when his brother-in-law is his father's house heard it they went down thither to him and everyone that was in distress or stress Under Pressure suffering hardship and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented to be in bitterness of soul to have been wrong and mistreated gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and they were with them about 400 men so after God breaks David he now can start using David and what he does he give David a purpose and he sends these men to him criminals and the off-scaring and the cast offs people that Society didn't want that Society abused and what's amazing here is that David now is you know partially learned his lesson he still makes mistakes but he starts training these men and these these off-scaring eventually turn into the money man of David these 400 men and they follow him throughout his entire life and they're renowned for their what they do they you know they're giant Slayers and they they do these marvelous you know uh battles and all these things and and from here David has a purpose and he's now in a position where he's now being able to help other people through his experience and when you get to that point you know you know Christ you know he has the off scarring he chooses the the the low lives of society and he turns into into giant slayers none of us in our flesh are capable of any good but is only through the power of the Holy Ghost that that potential is Unleashed for us to be giant slayers so if you go to Psalm 34 Psalm 34 was actually written around the same time as this as uh 142 when he's in the cave of a doom so if we go to Psalm 34 it says I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be on my mouth my soul shall maker boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear the rough and be glad o magnified the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and Lord heard him and saved him out of his troubles the angel of the Lord in campus around about them that fear Him and delivereth them you know and the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and delivereth him out of their troubles the Lord is nigh unto them of a broken heart and saves such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth them out of them all he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate the Lord redeemeth his soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate so we look at the contrast here you go from I am there was no man to help me I am completely alone to magnify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him from all that that is a man who has learned that through the crushing through the breaking that there's joy comes in the morning he's learned that there is a there's Grace at the end of the trial there's joy at the end of the trial there's strength at the end of the trial there's trust a greater Trust in his God and master at the end of the trial okay and the pain is never wasted God never wastes her pain when he puts these through these situations where you know we feel alone and we feel abandoned once he's done with you you'll always see the good in it and over time the pain fades but the joy of it increases and you go through it again because you would see what comes out of it the end final product is always worth the trial no matter what so just clue up here being broken is you know it's it's hard but God has a purpose in it and he's unleashing the potential that he's locked inside you and these trials that come they seem random they seem out of the blue but there's always a purpose in it and what God is trying to get us to do is to be to be silent within the storm that despite you know how everything has fallen apart that we don't try and fix it what he's trying to do is for us to go to him immediately go to him in prayer seek his faith seek his counsel and you see what David you know he's not perfect but neither are we after this you see him he's going he's going to God he's going to God when something else goes to God if he makes sake goes back to God it's just he there's a it's kind of like the the Shepherd that breaks the leg of the Lamb that lamb sticks close to that Shepherd because it it wants its protection and same thing with David is that he's learned he's tasted what it's like to be out on your own and it's not nice and he's learned that like there's a safety and there's a comfort in saying next to the master and same thing with us that like once you've learned a couple times that it's better to to go to him it's better to cling to him than to try to survive it on your own because it's just you're going to get you're going to get smashed and his smashing is a whole lot better than when you're in permissive will and you're getting crushed so as we clue up here and remember those trials are brought up upon you the same way so that you'll not say well maybe this is right maybe the scripture is true maybe Divine Healing is right maybe the Holy Ghost is right but when you get that experience and come off that ass sheep and you get the revelation of God by the baptism the Holy Ghost you can scream I know my redeemeth My Redeemer liveth because he lives in me now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised by whereby lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet less that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed and as we stand one of my favorite scriptures of all time there is no King saved by the multitude of a host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength a horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver anybody's great strength behold the eye the Lord is upon them that fear Him upon them that hope and his Mercy to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive and famine our soul waited for the Lord he is our help and our Shield for our hope our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trust in His holy name let thy mercy O Lord be upon us according as we hope in thee so at the end of the day you know it's you know he his ultimate intention is for us to go from glory to glory and you know as David learned so we learn that there's Grace for mistakes there's Grace To Learn but it takes time character is a very is a line upon line gift the longest lasting growth comes slow it's slow because anything that comes fast goes fast weeds come up quick and they go quick whereas an oak tree it takes years it takes the right conditions the right food it requires sunlight and takes time for it to grow but once once it's once it's mature it can withstand any wind it provides shelter for all the animals it's fruit feeds the animals and it's a blessing to everyone around it but it requires time and it requires patience and the same thing with us when in the spiritual walk our strength will not come out of the blue what requires these valleys these valleys are the shadow of death in order to to release that strength to release that that potential that
