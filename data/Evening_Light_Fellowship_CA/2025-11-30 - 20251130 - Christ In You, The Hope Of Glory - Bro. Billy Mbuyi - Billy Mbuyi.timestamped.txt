[43:46] morning like this. So, I thought, you
[43:48] know, if there's a time to ever allow
[43:49] coffee in the service, this would
[43:51] probably be it. Amen. But I'm trusting
[43:53] we're ready to go this morning.
[43:55] Certainly appreciate Brother Billy
[43:56] coming our way. He's got to he's got to
[43:58] preach and then get on a flight and head
[44:00] back home. So, we just want to say thank

[44:07] service to go. So, very thankful for
[44:09] that. Excuse me.
[44:12] Amen.
[44:14] Let's just sing that song as we turn it
[44:15] over to him. Thank you, Jesus, for the
[44:18] grace that you have given us. Amen. And
[44:20] we'll give him his liberty again this
[44:22] morning. Amen. Thank
[44:27] you,
[44:29] Jesus, [music]
[44:34] for [singing] the grace that you have
[44:39] given us.
[44:43] though I can't repay. But from my heart,
[44:48] I'd like [singing] to say that [music] I
[44:53] thank you.
[44:56] [music]
[44:58] Thank
[45:00] you my Jesus

[45:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:36] [music]

[45:42] [music]
[45:43] given
[45:47] my heart [music]
[45:49] from my heart.
[45:56] [music]
[45:59] Hallelujah.
[46:01] Amen. What can we say? It's all by his
[46:03] grace and mercy. Why don't we just bow
[46:06] our heads this morning? Our gracious
[46:08] father,
[46:11] Lord, your grace, it's unmmerited
[46:13] [music]
[46:13] favor that you've given us, Lord,
[46:16] for this. Truly this song encapsulate
[46:19] everything that we could say this
[46:21] morning. Father, what no matter what we
[46:24] do, we can never repay for the grace
[46:26] that's been extended. Father, it's an
[46:29] everlasting debt that we look and
[46:32] [music] Father, where we when we see
[46:34] where you've taken us and when we see,
[46:37] Father, our pathway and and and the
[46:40] mercies and grace that's been made known
[46:42] in our lives and Father, the things that
[46:44] [music] you've taken us out of and and
[46:47] Father, all the mistakes we've made and
[46:49] all the foolish things that we have
[46:51] done, [music] but yet your grace was
[46:53] there, Father, to just hold us in and
[46:56] bring us through, Father.
[46:58] Father, it's only in retrospective when
[47:01] we look back and see, Lord, and [music]
[47:03] something within our hearts just say
[47:05] thank you this morning. Lord, we pray
[47:07] that we may never get to a place where
[47:10] we think we do it by our own might or
[47:12] strength, but Father, that the grace
[47:14] that started the work, let it take it to
[47:16] the end, oh God. Father, that we may
[47:19] always rely upon the promised word that
[47:22] you have given and to know that you are
[47:24] faithful and just to keep your word.
[47:27] Lord, we are here once again this
[47:28] morning as your children. Lord, we can
[47:31] never get enough of you, Lord. No matter
[47:33] how much you feed us, Lord, we still
[47:36] want more of you, Lord. And we pray this
[47:39] morning, Father, once again, fill our
[47:41] cups, oh God, and until we overflow,
[47:44] Lord. Lord, our desire when all is said
[47:46] and done is that the world may not see
[47:49] us, that they may see you manifested in
[47:52] our bodies. We commit everything that we
[47:54] are into your hands. And father, we
[47:56] commit the service into your hands. And
[47:58] I pray that Father, if there be any need
[48:01] in the building or to those that are
[48:03] listening, Lord, may you just come and
[48:05] minister to the souls. And Father, that
[48:07] as your children, that we may receive
[48:09] our daily bread and the daily measure of
[48:12] what you have for us in this morning
[48:14] that we may go home satisfied that we've
[48:16] been in the presence of the Lord. We're
[48:18] committed to you and we pray that the uh
[48:21] grace and the mercy and the honor be up
[48:23] to you, Lord, [music] for all that we
[48:25] are. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:27] Christ, we pray and ask those things.
[48:29] Amen.
[48:32] Amen. You know, I just I I know brother
[48:35] Jonathan said his heart is full and I
[48:37] want to say my heart is full this
[48:39] morning. It's so amazing that you know,
[48:43] you go uh wherever you go, uh people
[48:48] from different places, but yet we are
[48:50] from the same place. And there's such a
[48:52] kind heart and the desire to see God
[48:55] manifest and the desire to see this end
[48:58] time message be manifested in the people
[49:01] and and and it's not something that you
[49:04] can make yourself become. It's a work
[49:07] that he has done and we want to
[49:09] fellowship on that. And I just want to
[49:11] apologize this morning for having you
[49:13] here so early and I trust that something
[49:16] may be spoken to just wake you up and
[49:18] you know get you going and and and you
[49:21] know our schedule was a little tight but
[49:23] you know uh we just wanted to be in
[49:26] fellowship with you and I must say so
[49:29] thank you very much. it so meant so much
[49:31] to us and and this has just been such a
[49:36] honor and and to just come and and and
[49:39] spend time with the bride in this part
[49:41] of the world. Thank you. God bless you.
[49:43] Let's open our Bibles this morning. And
[49:45] if we don't get to shake your hands this
[49:47] morning, we'll try to make sure we just
[49:49] leave enough time to go around and shake
[49:51] everybody hands. God bless you and the
[49:53] love of God be with you. Be praying for
[49:55] us. will pray for you until we meet
[49:58] again if the Lord will certainly enjoy
[50:00] our time here. So let's turn in
[50:02] Colossians chapter 1.
[50:05] Very familiar scripture reading. And
[50:07] we'll read just a couple of verses and
[50:09] we'll turn in um we'll turn again into
[50:12] another place. Uh Colossians chapter 1
[50:15] verse 25. It says where whereof I am
[50:19] ministered. I am made a minister
[50:21] according to the dispensation of God
[50:24] which is given unto me for you to
[50:26] fulfill the word of God. Even the
[50:29] mystery which was which has been hid
[50:32] from the from the uh from ages and from
[50:35] the generation but now is made known
[50:37] made manifest to his saints to whom he
[50:41] says God would make known what is the
[50:45] riches of his glory of the mystery among
[50:48] the gentile which is Christ in you the
[50:52] hope of glory also let's turn in Romans
[50:55] 8 we're going to read verse 15.
[51:04] Start from 15. And he says,
[51:13] "For ye have not received the spirit of
[51:16] bondage, again to fear, but ye have
[51:19] received the spirit of adoption, whereby
[51:21] we cry, aba, father. For the spirit
[51:24] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[51:27] that we are the children of God. And if
[51:30] children then hes of God and join heir
[51:34] with Christ. If if if so be that that we
[51:38] suffer with him, we may also be also
[51:42] glorified together. For I reckon that
[51:45] the suffering of this present time is
[51:48] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[51:50] which shall be revealed in us. And I
[51:53] want to say this, this is not a future
[51:55] day event. This is now.
[51:59] This is this morning.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; This is this is not even 60 years ago.
[52:05] This is now the glory that is to be
[52:08] revealed in us today. And we'll Lord
[52:12] willing we'll we'll just try to get to
[52:14] what that glory is. And then it says,
[52:17] for I reckon that the suffering of this
[52:19] present time is not worthy to be
[52:20] compared with the glory which shall be
[52:22] revealed in us. For the earnest
[52:23] expectation of the creature waited for
[52:26] the manifestation of sons of God. For
[52:29] the creature was made subject to vanity,
[52:32] not willingly, but by reason of him who
[52:35] had subjected the same in hope, because
[52:39] the creature
[52:41] itself also shall be delivered from the
[52:44] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[52:47] liberty of the children of God. For we
[52:50] know that the whole creation groanth and
[52:53] travaleth in pain until now. And not
[52:56] only they, but ourselves also, which
[53:00] have the first fruit of the spirit, even
[53:03] ourselves grown within ourselves,
[53:06] waiting for the adoption to which to the
[53:10] redemption of our bodies. Our gracious
[53:13] father, we ask that you bless your word
[53:15] once again to us. We commit what we are
[53:17] to you, Lord.
[53:19] Father, we couldn't say thank you
[53:20] enough, Lord. Father, we want our lives
[53:23] to be a song of thanksgiving every day,
[53:26] Lord. Father, that we may not only say
[53:29] it from our mouth, but when people look
[53:32] at us that that they may see that we are
[53:34] a thankful people, Father, thankful for
[53:37] your grace, thankful for your salvation.
[53:40] Thank you for taking us out of sins. And
[53:42] thank you, Lord, and for making us a
[53:44] family of God. Father, thank you that we
[53:47] may be those that you have called and
[53:49] open our eyes that we may see this dark
[53:52] age. And not only that, but Father, that
[53:55] the thanksgiving may be extended to
[53:57] those that don't know you, Lord. That we
[53:59] may show them that there's a people
[54:01] that's on earth that are thankful and
[54:03] that they have received something and
[54:05] their lives are displaying the very
[54:07] things that they have received. We ask
[54:09] you right now that you take the service,
[54:11] Lord, and Father, speak your word to us.
[54:13] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[54:15] pray and ask. Amen. May I have your
[54:17] seats this morning? Certainly want to
[54:19] say I enjoy the specials throughout and
[54:22] all the songs and every I heard
[54:24] beautiful voices. I couldn't identify
[54:26] who was singing, who was not and but it
[54:28] was certainly a beautiful melody. God
[54:30] bless you for that. Amen. So I want to
[54:33] just like I said continue on the thought
[54:36] um and perhaps just bring it in a more
[54:39] general understanding and I want to
[54:42] speak on Christ in you the hope of
[54:45] glory. Um yesterday we talked about
[54:49] identification and we went right through
[54:52] into this but we want to just continue
[54:55] on where we left off. Christ in you, the
[54:58] hope of glory. And I just want to say
[55:00] for myself, I I had listened to the
[55:03] message Christ the mystery of God so
[55:05] many times and throughout the years of
[55:07] of being a a believer and a minister.
[55:09] And I thought I kind of had a grasp of
[55:11] it. But I tell you, it's just been
[55:14] opening more and more to even myself.
[55:16] And I'm looking, I'm like, I don't even
[55:18] understand what is it that he's talking
[55:20] about. And I'm realizing this message is
[55:23] an unfolding message. It's not a message
[55:26] that's already complete. No, it's the
[55:28] unfolding of your life. And God waits
[55:31] until you get to the stage where the
[55:33] next chapter needs to open. He opens it
[55:36] up to you. So, he doesn't give you as a
[55:38] whole package once and for all and you
[55:40] go into a repetition. No. but is a God
[55:43] who's walking with you and continually
[55:46] giving you what you need for the time
[55:48] that you are in. Opening the revelation
[55:51] for you to see where is it that you are
[55:53] and what is it that's unfolding at that
[55:55] time so you can grow in it. Because
[55:58] remember, it's a message that's good
[56:00] from the the new birth unto the rapture.
[56:03] So, it's not that is adding anything
[56:05] new, but it's what's been added is the
[56:08] revelation of that which was already
[56:10] spoken. And that's what we receive every
[56:13] day in our lives. That's why the prophet
[56:15] say revelation is so important because
[56:17] the revelation is what is when God is
[56:20] made a reality in your life. And I want
[56:24] to say this revelation is not your
[56:26] thinking. Revelation is what you live.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Revelation is not you know we read the
[56:31] scripture we say oh I saw. Revelation is
[56:34] not something new that you come into,
[56:36] but revelation is the new light that
[56:39] gives you the ability to make a step
[56:41] forward. It's not an added intellectual
[56:44] understanding, but it's the opening up
[56:46] of what already existed because we
[56:49] understand God reveals himself in
[56:51] simplicity. The word is the already
[56:53] there. The word is already spoken. But
[56:56] God waits for the season and the time to
[56:58] open it up so you can see who you are.
[57:01] And that's why even in the church of
[57:03] God,
[57:04] we don't want to treat and and and
[57:07] consider everybody at the same level.
[57:09] God will unfold himself from the
[57:11] youngest to the oldest at the stage that
[57:13] you are in so you can receive the food
[57:16] that you need for that time. Because
[57:18] remember this is spiritual food in due
[57:21] season. In due season. So when you get
[57:24] in that season of your life, whatever
[57:26] season you are in, God will unfold
[57:29] himself in that season for you to
[57:31] receive the food that you need. So
[57:33] Christ, the mystery of God revealed it.
[57:36] It's to understand the very purpose of
[57:38] God from the beginning. And to
[57:41] understand, and I want to just say this,
[57:43] it's the the Christ, the mystery of God
[57:46] revealed. And I was talking to brother
[57:48] Jonathan about this. You read what we
[57:51] talked about was invisible union
[57:53] yesterday and it talks about who you
[57:55] are, where you came from, and all of
[57:57] that. But when you go back to Christ,
[57:59] the mystery of God revealed, God is
[58:01] showing you the unfolding of the whole
[58:04] mystery. How that you came to be
[58:06] sinless, how that you came to be
[58:09] perfect, how that how is it that all of
[58:11] that happened, it was all sealed in the
[58:14] single mystery.
[58:17] In Christ, the mystery of God revealed.
[58:19] So and I want to say this when you read
[58:21] this we we as believers as we read this
[58:25] we have to come to the understanding
[58:26] that Christ the mystery of God we are
[58:29] included in the very purpose
[58:32] the the the mystery is not about I want
[58:36] to just let me just say this you are the
[58:38] actual mystery
[58:41] Christ God creation the purpose what
[58:44] says he created the world so he can have
[58:47] a bride in
[58:50] You're like, "Well, I thought he created
[58:52] the world so he can have mountains and
[58:54] so he can have billions of people." No,
[58:57] he created all of that so he can come
[58:59] and get get a bride out of it. He
[59:02] created all of this things so he can
[59:04] come and have fellowship with you in
[59:07] you. You take him from the purpose in
[59:09] the beginning. You take the death of
[59:11] Christ on Calvary. You take all the
[59:14] sacrifice that's been happening. You
[59:16] take all the prophets and you take all
[59:18] the books of the Bible, it all comes
[59:20] down to one thing that God wanted a
[59:22] bride of his own choosing.
[59:26] It says be and then so we find out that
[59:28] before there was any creation. So
[59:31] therefore when he was uh talking about
[59:33] the planning
[59:40] when he when before there was anything
[59:43] before there was any creation God in the
[59:46] beginning he thought of you in the
[59:49] beginning and not that you were an
[59:51] afterthought or just part of the the
[59:54] whole creation but he made you as the
[59:57] central piece of the plan.
[1:00:01] You are the very central piece of the
[1:00:04] plan. And we'll read some of that. So
[1:00:06] God desired, as we said yesterday, his
[1:00:09] desire was to have a family. His desire
[1:00:12] was to have sons and daughters and uh
[1:00:14] born of his spirit, sharing his nature.
[1:00:17] Let me say this, God didn't create you
[1:00:20] just so you can come and say, "Oh Lord,
[1:00:22] I worship you as a servant." When he
[1:00:26] says that God was not God, when he was
[1:00:29] not God, he created angels for that.
[1:00:32] He created angels so he can receive
[1:00:35] worship. He created the trees and he
[1:00:37] created that so he can express himself.
[1:00:40] And if you go, you read it. He created
[1:00:43] you and you for the sole purpose of
[1:00:46] having fellowship. He had already the
[1:00:49] nature that worship him. He had angels
[1:00:52] that sing holy, holy three times every
[1:00:55] day and worshiping him and everything.
[1:00:57] He didn't create you so you can do what
[1:00:59] the angel was doing. No, he created you
[1:01:02] for a unique purpose that he can look at
[1:01:05] someone that was like him so he can look
[1:01:08] at you and have fellowship with him.
[1:01:10] God. Just like in in our lives, you
[1:01:12] know, you grow up and you're a young man
[1:01:14] and you are a a young kid and you have a
[1:01:17] family and all of the sudden you grow
[1:01:19] old and you get to a certain age. You
[1:01:21] want companionship. You want fellowship.
[1:01:23] You want somebody that you're going to
[1:01:24] spend life with you with and all of
[1:01:26] that. All of that is part of God's
[1:01:29] nature even being manifested in human
[1:01:32] being. God didn't want to be alone. He
[1:01:34] didn't want his glory to just be about
[1:01:36] him. He wanted to share what he was with
[1:01:39] somebody and that's the purpose of your
[1:01:42] creation.
[1:01:44] He created the world for the purpose of
[1:01:46] getting the bride out of it. God didn't
[1:01:48] want to dwell alone. His nature is a
[1:01:51] loving nature. And love requires an
[1:01:55] expression.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; You you you can't say you love out of
[1:02:00] the blue. Like you you can't. AND I WANT
[1:02:03] TO SAY THIS. That's why it's so
[1:02:05] important. I I I'm trying not to jump
[1:02:07] ahead of myself, but but if you could
[1:02:09] just bear with me for a second. So, love
[1:02:12] requires an expression. When you say
[1:02:15] your love, you can't say your love and
[1:02:17] it's empty word. Love is manifested in
[1:02:20] works. Love is manifested in you doing
[1:02:23] something. So if what God was a father,
[1:02:27] if God was a savior, if God was a a
[1:02:30] healer and all of those things, it
[1:02:32] required a place for him to express all
[1:02:35] of those things. And I want to say this,
[1:02:38] so God wanted to express his thoughts
[1:02:40] and his attributes that would dwelt in
[1:02:42] him, the father, the redeemer, and all
[1:02:44] of those things. And I want to say this,
[1:02:46] God's nature of expression, IT HAS NOT
[1:02:50] STOPPED EXPRESSING ITSELF. When that
[1:02:53] nature is manifested into THE SON OF
[1:02:55] GOD, THAT NATURE IS CONTINUAL.
[1:02:59] THAT'S WHY THE EXPRESSION NEVER STOPS.
[1:03:02] THAT'S WHY IT'S AN ETERNAL EXPRESSION.
[1:03:04] WHY? BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE a the desire
[1:03:07] to to to love and everything, when you
[1:03:09] become a son and a daughter of God, you
[1:03:11] have that same love into your heart.
[1:03:13] When you become a son and A DAUGHTER OF
[1:03:15] GOD, YOU HAVE THAT SAME ATTRIBUTE to
[1:03:18] want to save somebody. YOU HAVE THE
[1:03:20] ATTRIBUTE TO WANT SOMEBODY HEALED. WHAT
[1:03:22] IS IT? It's the continuation of the
[1:03:24] expression. The expression didn't stay
[1:03:27] with him. He shared it with you as part
[1:03:29] of his attribute. And that same
[1:03:31] expression is continuing in you.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; That's why when you become a believer,
[1:03:36] you have a heart for the people and they
[1:03:38] lost souls.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; You can't SAY, "I'M SAVED. THANK GOD I'M
[1:03:42] SAVED." AND and the world is dying. No.
[1:03:44] When you see somebody struggling, YOUR
[1:03:46] HEART GOES after it. YOUR HEART GOES
[1:03:49] AFTER THEM. AND YOU SAID, "LORD, IF YOU
[1:03:51] CAN SAVE them and if you can do
[1:03:53] something." That's why WHEN YOU SEE
[1:03:54] SOMEBODY with purple hair or or green
[1:03:56] hair, don't just look at them and says,
[1:03:58] "Oh, look at the devil." NO, LET
[1:04:00] SOMEBODY SOMETHING in your heart call
[1:04:02] out and said, "OH, YOU KNOW, AND I WANT
[1:04:04] TO SAY THIS. I love to see people like
[1:04:06] that because I know at least they're
[1:04:08] fanatic for something, but oh, if they
[1:04:11] can be GET CHANGED, I KNOW THAT THEY
[1:04:13] will give 100% to God."
[1:04:17] So we the expression is not to be
[1:04:21] contained and be happy with and say oh
[1:04:24] I'm safe and I'm a Christian and that's
[1:04:25] the end of it. No, a expression IS TO BE
[1:04:28] CARRIED OUT. Is to be expressed INTO A
[1:04:31] DYING WORLD. IS to look at your
[1:04:33] neighbor, to look at your coworker, to
[1:04:36] look at the people AROUND YOU. THAT SAME
[1:04:38] expression is there. So when the need
[1:04:40] arises, that expression CAN CALL OUT.
[1:04:43] I'LL TELL YOU THIS, BUT when I'm says we
[1:04:45] worship him in many ways in churches and
[1:04:48] everything, but if you ever been around
[1:04:50] somebody who's constantly talking
[1:04:52] negative and everything, DON'T LET them
[1:04:55] escape from that.
[1:04:58] He he talks about I believe being in a
[1:05:00] museum I believe and this professor
[1:05:03] teacher he's walking around with kids
[1:05:05] and he goes to a fish and he said that
[1:05:08] oh look at didn't the Bible says that no
[1:05:11] uh uh Jonah was swallowed by the fish
[1:05:14] and he started taking measurements and
[1:05:17] say look he said how is it that a man
[1:05:20] can can pass through here you know and
[1:05:22] everything he said I was over there and
[1:05:25] I just couldn't hold my peace
[1:05:28] I love that. I couldn't hold my piss and
[1:05:30] then I just said, "Sir, that was a
[1:05:33] speciallymade fish."
[1:05:37] That was a speciallymade fish. And I'm
[1:05:41] not talking about being confrontational.
[1:05:43] You if you make somebody say, "Oh, I'm
[1:05:45] sick and such and such is going on and
[1:05:48] and everything." What is it? They're
[1:05:50] calling out to something. IT'S A CRY
[1:05:52] OUT. THE WORLD IS CRYING OUT, MY
[1:05:54] BROTHER, MY SISTER. BUT THE WORLD IS
[1:05:56] CRYING OUT. THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.
[1:05:58] THEY REJECTED the message. THEY REJECTED
[1:06:01] THE PROPHET. THERE'S NOTHING out there.
[1:06:03] So the only hope they have is you that
[1:06:05] are sitting here this morning. It's you
[1:06:08] that have received this message. When
[1:06:10] somebody's crying out, DON'T LET THE CRY
[1:06:12] GO OUT. JUST SAY SOMETHING AND SAY, "OH,
[1:06:14] I KNOW A GOD who can save. I know a God
[1:06:17] who can heal. I know somebody THAT I CAN
[1:06:19] TAKE YOU TO. I know if I pray, I know
[1:06:22] he's given me the ministry of
[1:06:25] reconciliation. I know he's CALLED ME SO
[1:06:27] WHEN I SPEAK, HE CAN hear me. I KNOW I
[1:06:31] CAN COME, I CAN bring you, you can hear
[1:06:33] about THIS GOD AND WE CAN PRAY for you
[1:06:35] and see what he can do. If the doctors
[1:06:37] CAN'T HELP YOU, I know somebody who can
[1:06:39] help you.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't keep IT FOR YOURSELF. SHARE
[1:06:42] IT with somebody.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; The world is dying.
[1:06:50] So,
[1:06:52] oh my,
[1:06:58] if I don't get to finish,
[1:07:01] the Lord will have his way. Just allow
[1:07:04] me to just take my time. I don't want to
[1:07:06] go too fast and I don't want to go too
[1:07:09] slow. Just want to take my time and and
[1:07:11] you know, the world is eternal and the
[1:07:13] Lord will just fill up the rest. So the
[1:07:16] God the it's the understanding that
[1:07:19] God's nature
[1:07:24] is the continuation of the expression of
[1:07:27] revealing himself and it's not done.
[1:07:30] He's continually revealing and
[1:07:32] everywhere every form
[1:07:36] every form that he find himself it's his
[1:07:40] expression continuing.
[1:07:42] You see a tree, a tree will grow up and
[1:07:46] and it will produce folk the seed and
[1:07:48] the seed will fall into the ground and
[1:07:50] another tree will rise up. Job said, "I
[1:07:53] saw God in nature. I I was uh I've
[1:07:56] always wondered you know but when talks
[1:07:58] about the message the path of life and
[1:08:01] what's one of my favorite and he says
[1:08:05] how that God is the tree and we are the
[1:08:08] fruits hanging off of it and and you're
[1:08:10] like well I see a leaf fall and then it
[1:08:14] dies and I said well the leaf doesn't
[1:08:17] you know it actually falls so how is the
[1:08:20] process continue because the tree falls
[1:08:22] on the ground and then everything but
[1:08:24] but And if you go listen, what you'll
[1:08:26] understand is the the the the the leaf,
[1:08:30] it's not the leaf, the life when winter
[1:08:34] comes, the life is pulled out of the
[1:08:37] leaf.
[1:08:40] Are you with me this morning? It's the
[1:08:42] life when winter comes, the same life is
[1:08:46] pulled out of the leaf to go back into
[1:08:49] the root for the saving of the tree. The
[1:08:53] leaf fall and the leaf represent the
[1:08:56] flesh. But the life is not gone. When
[1:08:59] when the time for springtime comes, it's
[1:09:02] the same expression. It's not a
[1:09:04] different life. It's the same expression
[1:09:06] that comes back. That's why my brother,
[1:09:08] my sister, in the resurrection, it's not
[1:09:11] going to be a different you. If you went
[1:09:14] by the way of the grave or whatever,
[1:09:16] it's going to be THE SAME EXACT YOU
[1:09:18] sitting this morning. It'll be a
[1:09:20] different flesh because this this flesh
[1:09:22] is here. It's it's the down it's it's
[1:09:24] the the the the ground and it's going to
[1:09:26] go back to the ground. But the
[1:09:28] expression remains the same. It says
[1:09:30] resurrection is not replacement.
[1:09:34] IT'S NOT REPLACEMENT. IT'S THE SAME
[1:09:36] LIFE. IT'S THE SAME CHRIST WHO WENT INTO
[1:09:39] the ground is him that resurrected.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And it's the same. That's why one of the
[1:09:45] things I I I one of my things I get
[1:09:48] especially on the young people is
[1:09:50] because I don't understand how they can
[1:09:54] see and and see that that God was in
[1:09:57] Christ. They can see the life of God in
[1:09:59] CHRIST BUT WHEN IT COMES to themselves
[1:10:02] they take that same life and they
[1:10:03] belittle it. All of the sudden when it's
[1:10:08] in Christ it can do all things. when he
[1:10:10] comes in you, he can't do anything.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; What a confusion.
[1:10:17] You know, and because remember what I'm
[1:10:20] says that what what God did in Christ,
[1:10:24] Christ does in you. Well, get there.
[1:10:26] What God did in Christ, Christ does in
[1:10:29] you. HE SAYS ALL THAT WAS INTO GOD, he
[1:10:33] poured into Christ. And all that was
[1:10:35] into Christ, he poured it into the
[1:10:37] church. So if IT'S THE SAME LIFE, IT'LL
[1:10:39] produce the same fruit. And I'm not
[1:10:41] saying that for you to look at yourself
[1:10:43] and say, "How come I'm not producing?" I
[1:10:45] mean, I'm saying that so YOU CAN KNOW
[1:10:47] THE FULLNESS IS THERE TO TAP INTO IT.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; It the fullness IS THERE FOR YOU TO WALK
[1:10:57] into it.
[1:10:59] and and and and you know the prophet
[1:11:01] will even talk how you know the the
[1:11:04] planter will go and plant and some will
[1:11:06] bring uh 40 and some will bring 50 and
[1:11:08] some will bring 60 and some will bring a
[1:11:10] 100fold my brother my sister if you
[1:11:12] bring in 6040 God that's not the END OF
[1:11:16] YOU GOD WANTS you to be at your full
[1:11:18] potential
[1:11:21] but when I'M SAYS THAT GOD DOESN'T MAKE
[1:11:23] halfway believers
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; but the believer can be halfway the The
[1:11:28] reason we are halfway is because we
[1:11:31] don't go into the storehouse. We don't
[1:11:34] go into it to take all the fullness
[1:11:36] that's been made available to us because
[1:11:38] it's THE MORE WE DIE to ourselves.
[1:11:40] That's when we receive the more of God.
[1:11:42] It's the dying to the self. It's the
[1:11:45] DENYING OF THIS FLESH. IT'S THE COMING
[1:11:47] LIKE WE WERE talking about yesterday.
[1:11:49] It's the constant reminding OF YOURSELF
[1:11:51] THAT I'M NOT THIS FLESH.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; I can't SAY THAT ENOUGH. I'M NOT this
[1:11:57] flesh. This flesh you were first created
[1:12:00] in the nature and in THE IMAGE OF GOD.
[1:12:03] AND THAT IMAGE IS THE SPIRIT MAN. But
[1:12:06] the spirit man cannot express himself in
[1:12:08] the air. The spirit MAN NEEDS A FLESH by
[1:12:11] which the expression will come from.
[1:12:18] So you've been going to BATTLE FOR ALL
[1:12:20] YOUR life to bring out that expression.
[1:12:23] And let me say this, don't give up.
[1:12:27] NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, DO NOT GIVE UP.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; YOU CONTINUE TO BATTLE EVERY DAY. LET ME
[1:12:34] SAY THIS. If you fail, if your your
[1:12:36] flesh shames you, if your FLESH BRINGS
[1:12:39] REPROACH, DON'T STOP THERE. YOU
[1:12:41] CONTINUE. ONE DAY, GOD WILL BRING THAT
[1:12:43] FULL EXPRESSION OUT OF YOU.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about the woman at the
[1:12:49] well. She seen the body.
[1:12:53] Think about it. She couldn't even come
[1:12:56] to the well when everybody else came.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; She was known as a reproach into the
[1:13:03] town. Nobody would want to be associated
[1:13:06] with her. But one day, the time for the
[1:13:09] expression came. You know what the
[1:13:11] prophet said? Even though she was in
[1:13:14] that condition, she had a representation
[1:13:17] out there.
[1:13:19] Aren't you glad you have a
[1:13:21] representation, my brother, my sister?
[1:13:23] If it wasn't for the representation, we
[1:13:25] would all be lost this morning. But we
[1:13:27] thank God that there's an expression and
[1:13:30] a representation out there. So she came
[1:13:32] and she met a man, a different kind of
[1:13:36] man. And he talked to him and said,
[1:13:37] "Give me some water." And said, "Well,
[1:13:40] you know, how can you and asked me for
[1:13:42] water?" And he said, "You know, we know
[1:13:44] that the Samaritan and the Jews, they
[1:13:46] have nothing in common. How why would
[1:13:48] you ask me to drink?" where said, "Well,
[1:13:50] if you have if you know what I can offer
[1:13:52] this morning, I'll give you the water
[1:13:54] that never runs dry and I will just
[1:13:56] babble in your heart." And she looked at
[1:13:58] him and said, "You don't even have
[1:14:00] anything to draw with." Now, I want you
[1:14:02] to realize now until that time, but says
[1:14:06] Jesus was contacting a spirit. Here is
[1:14:08] Jesus speaking about spiritual things
[1:14:11] and where where she was sitting, she's
[1:14:14] taking everything and making it all
[1:14:15] natural.
[1:14:19] in church the word being preached and
[1:14:21] all it is is just adding and subtracting
[1:14:25] you know all of our lives all we do am I
[1:14:27] able am I capable is this for me is this
[1:14:29] not FOR ME THAT'S ALL she was doing JUST
[1:14:33] ALL THE WORD THE WORD TRYING TO CONTACT
[1:14:36] HER spirit and she's over there just
[1:14:39] plainly blank of what was happening it
[1:14:41] wasn't until and and I want to say this
[1:14:44] God knew exactly what she had need and
[1:14:47] he knew exactly how to get to her. And
[1:14:50] he does the same for every one of his
[1:14:52] children. He knows I don't care how you
[1:14:55] ready you find yourself and how quiet
[1:14:58] you are, how loud you are, how
[1:15:00] emotional, non-emotional, for whatever
[1:15:02] characteristics you have. God knows how
[1:15:05] to get to you. You don't have to be
[1:15:07] something that you're not in order for
[1:15:09] God to go. He knows. He's built you. He
[1:15:12] let you be in that flesh and he knows
[1:15:14] exactly what it takes. But has a quote.
[1:15:17] I don't have it with me. IT SAID THAT
[1:15:19] GOD KNOWS MEN. WE THINK WE KNOW MAN, BUT
[1:15:22] GOD knows man. He knows exactly how to
[1:15:26] get to you.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; So the little seed falling from the
[1:15:32] ground, it doesn't matter if he laid but
[1:15:35] say every form of life you he would take
[1:15:39] and it says you take a blade of grass
[1:15:41] and you put it under a concrete.
[1:15:44] It says it will find its way out.
[1:15:49] If it has to crack the concrete, it has
[1:15:53] to push its way out to the sidewalk.
[1:15:55] Why? Because there's a life. And
[1:15:57] wherever there's a life, there's always
[1:15:59] an expression.
[1:16:03] And and and and guess what we do? We
[1:16:06] take our nature. We post it for the
[1:16:09] reason why we can't express. Let me tell
[1:16:11] you if the life of Christ is in you that
[1:16:14] expression will come forth. Why? Because
[1:16:17] let me say this. It's the reason for
[1:16:19] that is because in every time the
[1:16:23] supernatural expresses itself, the
[1:16:26] supernatural is made to have dominion
[1:16:29] over the natural.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; The supernatural from the beginning.
[1:16:37] THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU go read even from
[1:16:40] from uh uh the beginning you read about
[1:16:42] the first Adam you read about the second
[1:16:44] Adam and even when you read we take it
[1:16:47] all the way to the manifested son in the
[1:16:49] end time you see the expression in the
[1:16:51] prophet but said that one of the things
[1:16:53] you realize is it was always the ability
[1:16:56] to take control of nature and I'm not
[1:16:59] just talking about nature out there even
[1:17:01] this very nature that you have why
[1:17:04] because when TIME FOR EXPRESSION COMES
[1:17:06] THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN STOP IT.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; You don't have TO WORRY ABOUT IT. THAT'S
[1:17:13] WHY BUT WHEN SAYS, "OH, I'm just
[1:17:15] jumping. I'm sorry." He says, "WE WE WE
[1:17:17] STUDY TOO MUCH. WE DO TOO MUCH." HE
[1:17:19] SAYS, "IF YOU JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH
[1:17:21] HIM, MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, WHEN PETER
[1:17:24] came on the day of Pentecost, he didn't
[1:17:26] SEND THERE SAY STOP DRINKING AND STOP
[1:17:28] SMOKING AND STOP." I TELL YOU THAT LIST,
[1:17:30] YOU CAN NEVER FILL ALL OF IT. BUT ONE
[1:17:32] THING YOU CAN DO IF YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY
[1:17:34] SPIRIT, HE'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; HE'LL SHOW YOU THE WAY. HE WILL GUIDE
[1:17:39] YOU AND HE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU FROM
[1:17:41] BEGINNING till the end.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about that.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I do this wrong. I do."
[1:17:48] But sister, do not pay attention to the
[1:17:51] wrong that you do. Pay attention to the
[1:17:54] life of Christ this morning and let that
[1:17:56] life dwell in you. It will take care of
[1:17:58] all of those wrongs.
[1:18:03] So
[1:18:06] when we'll
[1:18:12] need help, so if it's time, somebody
[1:18:15] just wave me. I'm sorry. Yeah, just wave
[1:18:18] me so I know. I I feel like I'm just
[1:18:23] So when you talk about the three-fold
[1:18:25] purposes,
[1:18:28] one of the things you realize is these
[1:18:30] are connected purpose. These are not
[1:18:33] three distinct purpose.
[1:18:37] The barbam says it was for a purpose of
[1:18:39] revealing himself.
[1:18:42] And then the second purpose was for the
[1:18:44] purpose of having uh uh uh dominion or
[1:18:49] for him to be the headship. And then the
[1:18:52] the third purpose was of the purpose of
[1:18:54] restoration. But those are not three
[1:18:56] different because how can you have
[1:18:58] headship over somebody you don't know?
[1:19:02] The the purpose of expression was so
[1:19:05] that we can look and see that this is
[1:19:07] our bridegroom.
[1:19:10] The purpose was so in the revealing
[1:19:12] himself that the fellowship will be
[1:19:14] created so we can give him the proper
[1:19:17] place into our lives.
[1:19:19] And then when we give him the proper
[1:19:21] place he leads to the restoration of
[1:19:23] what was in the beginning. So it's not
[1:19:26] three what uh three distinct purposes
[1:19:29] where we go around and say oh God I just
[1:19:31] want you to reveal himself but to reveal
[1:19:33] himself for what
[1:19:36] what is the purpose of this man? Why did
[1:19:39] God open your eyes? It's not so we can
[1:19:42] sit and just say thank God you open. No
[1:19:45] he's doing that so you can understand
[1:19:47] that. But what I'm says that Christ is
[1:19:50] the center of the entire Bible.
[1:19:54] the center, the Old Testament. He's the
[1:19:56] fulfillment of all the prophecy of the
[1:19:58] Old Testament that was given. And when
[1:20:00] he comes and now in the New Testament,
[1:20:03] he it's not just Christ himself. Now he
[1:20:06] takes himself, he divides himself in the
[1:20:09] people and they become a continuation of
[1:20:12] what he was. That's why he says the book
[1:20:15] of Acts, it says THAT'S WHY IT'S CHRIST
[1:20:17] in it's not the act of of of the people,
[1:20:20] but it's the act of the Holy Spirit.
[1:20:23] It's the act of God himself dwelling in
[1:20:25] his people. And I want to say this, GOD
[1:20:28] WAS NOT HAPPY with the church where he
[1:20:30] would come. He's the beginning of the
[1:20:32] church. He's the one who started the
[1:20:34] first church.
[1:20:36] And and in the church, God didn't want
[1:20:40] to be Jesus didn't want to stand there
[1:20:42] because it did happen where the
[1:20:44] disciples will go and they'll do great
[1:20:47] miracles and he'll send them out.
[1:20:49] They'll go and come back. Oh, the devils
[1:20:51] were subject to as they say, well, you
[1:20:53] know, he says, rejoice not because the
[1:20:55] devil are subject to you, but rejoice
[1:20:56] because your name is written in the
[1:20:58] book. And but then there will go certain
[1:21:00] times and they will go and cast demons
[1:21:02] and they couldn't. And they'll come and
[1:21:03] say, "Master, we tried, we couldn't for
[1:21:05] some reason." He said, "Oh, you know, he
[1:21:07] says this one, there are some that you
[1:21:09] have to to to be in a certain condition
[1:21:11] in order for you to take care of her."
[1:21:13] So for and then there will be a woman
[1:21:15] come and they'll try to stop him and the
[1:21:17] master will say, "No, just let him come
[1:21:18] in." So they knew they were in such
[1:21:22] comfort that they knew that if we needed
[1:21:24] anything the master was just there to
[1:21:26] take care of it.
[1:21:29] Now I I I just want to say this not
[1:21:32] perhaps just as a somber thought.
[1:21:34] Imagine the prophet still being in town.
[1:21:38] I he couldn't live in the town big
[1:21:39] enough.
[1:21:42] But that's not the model of the church
[1:21:44] Jesus was looking for. He looked at
[1:21:46] them. He set them down and says, "It's
[1:21:49] expedient that I go." Now, I MEAN, THEY
[1:21:52] WERE PROBABLY LOOKING AND SAY, "THIS IS
[1:21:54] THE BEST CHURCH EVER.
[1:21:57] THIS IS THE BEST SERVICE EVER. WE KNOW
[1:21:59] IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM, the pastor is
[1:22:01] there. He's there to just take care of
[1:22:03] everything. All our needs, we just bring
[1:22:05] over to him." HE SAYS, "NO, THAT'S NOT
[1:22:06] what I'm looking for. The church that
[1:22:08] I'm looking for is for ME TO COME BACK
[1:22:11] IN THE FORM OF THE SPIRIT AND FOR ME TO
[1:22:14] DWELL IN EACH AND EVERY ONE of you."
[1:22:16] WHERE YOU BECOME A UNIT THAT ACTUALLY
[1:22:18] FUNCTION
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; NOT LOOKING AT ONE BUT AS A PEOPLE each
[1:22:23] one playing its role in coming together
[1:22:26] that you may do greater works
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE CHURCH THAT JESUS HE SAYS ON
[1:22:32] THE DAY of Pentecost and I want to say
[1:22:34] this Christ in you that's why and yeah
[1:22:39] they are after they receive the baptism
[1:22:41] of the Holy Ghost but says one place it
[1:22:44] says the man that was sitting at the
[1:22:46] gate. Beautiful. No doubt Jesus passed
[1:22:49] there time and time again.
[1:22:54] And every time your pastor says,
[1:22:57] "My boys are going to take care of you
[1:22:58] one day.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Not today. Today is not the time.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Just stay there a little longer." He
[1:23:07] will come and pass by the gate beautiful
[1:23:08] and say, "I know. I have just a vision
[1:23:12] of what exactly is going to happen."
[1:23:14] What did the Holy Spirit do? He brought
[1:23:17] them into the consciousness that they
[1:23:20] were already gods.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; That the works that I do, ye shall do
[1:23:26] also. When the Holy Spirit comes into
[1:23:29] the life of a believer, you no longer
[1:23:32] are your flesh and worry about the
[1:23:34] things of the flesh. Your focus is into
[1:23:37] Christ and you know that Christ in you,
[1:23:39] that same spirit in him will produce the
[1:23:41] same work. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; He said that father he went when he in
[1:23:47] John 14 and I'm just summarizing
[1:23:49] everything right now. In John 14, he
[1:23:51] prays and it says, "Father, I'm going to
[1:23:54] go to the cross and I'm going to give my
[1:23:56] life. But what I pray for is that the
[1:23:59] love, the the the union and the
[1:24:01] fellowship that I have with you that
[1:24:03] they may receive it also." Christ didn't
[1:24:06] pray for you to come under him. He
[1:24:09] prayed so that the same access, the same
[1:24:12] life, the same everything that he had,
[1:24:15] YOU COULD HAVE. THAT'S WHY WE READ THE
[1:24:17] SCRIPTURE. It says is a core air. We He
[1:24:20] didn't take YOU AND PUT YOU UNDER. HE
[1:24:22] MAKE YOU HE MADE YOU ONE WITH HIM.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; But we keep putting ourselves under.
[1:24:33] We keep choosing a different position
[1:24:37] than what he gave us.
[1:24:40] Let me say this. God loves for people to
[1:24:43] take him at his word and to approach him
[1:24:46] with the the identity that he has given
[1:24:49] you for the time. We're not building
[1:24:52] boats this time. We are not crossing the
[1:24:54] Jordan this time. We are not crossing
[1:24:56] the Red Sea this time. In this same
[1:24:59] time, he said, "I called you bride.
[1:25:04] And the boldness that I was talking
[1:25:06] about yesterday is to understand that I
[1:25:09] have been called to come. Now, I'm not
[1:25:12] saying that all of the sudden you feel
[1:25:15] deserving. No, perhaps for the rest of
[1:25:18] our lives, we'll feel undeserving all
[1:25:20] the time. But nevertheless, that's the
[1:25:23] position he's given us. We approach him
[1:25:25] with grace with the understanding that
[1:25:28] even though I'm undeserving but you
[1:25:30] still called me to do this.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; So it shows God was showing his original
[1:25:38] intention that his life was that he
[1:25:41] would uh that his life would one day
[1:25:44] live in the human flesh again. His
[1:25:47] original desire from the beginning has
[1:25:49] always to have fellowship not religion.
[1:25:54] No, that is not I I I preach back home a
[1:25:57] message. God is not interested in
[1:25:58] religion. He's interested in fellowship.
[1:26:02] Religion is when you come and you
[1:26:04] conform to a book. You you you hear what
[1:26:07] they said. Oh, you got to stop smoking.
[1:26:09] You got to stop drinking. You train your
[1:26:12] flesh into doing that. And I'll say
[1:26:14] this, perhaps you may be successful.
[1:26:18] There are good people out there that
[1:26:21] don't got the Holy Ghost, that don't
[1:26:23] smoke, that don't drink,
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; but that's not enough. He says your
[1:26:28] righteousness is filthy rag.
[1:26:32] So, it's not about that. God desires
[1:26:35] fellowship. He created you for
[1:26:38] fellowship. So, it's not in trying to
[1:26:40] conform with the letter and say the
[1:26:43] letter does that. In fact, God, he said,
[1:26:45] but he we his promise in the scripture
[1:26:48] was that I will take away the stony
[1:26:51] heart. I will take away your heart. I
[1:26:54] will give you a heart of flesh. I'll
[1:26:56] give you a new spirit. I will put my
[1:26:59] spirit into your spirit and I will cause
[1:27:02] you to obey my commandment.
[1:27:05] Oh my, that's grace right there. You
[1:27:08] know why it's grace? Because some of us
[1:27:10] know WE WERE NOT DISCIPLINED ENOUGH TO
[1:27:12] STOP WITH our own self. WE KNOW IF IT
[1:27:15] WASN'T FOR HIM, WE WOULD HAVE FAILED.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; We know it. AND WE KNOW EVEN UNTIL NOW,
[1:27:21] IF HE JUST LETS US GO ONE MOMENT, WE'RE
[1:27:23] GOING TO BE A FAILURE. We need him every
[1:27:25] hour of the day.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And every step of the way, we are
[1:27:33] reminded, Lord, if you don't do, I'm
[1:27:36] done. If you stop, I'm stopping. It's
[1:27:40] like Moses, he says, Lord, if you don't
[1:27:42] go before us, we won't go. Show us your
[1:27:45] glory. And his glory, he says that so
[1:27:48] where I am that ye may be also. And that
[1:27:51] place is positioning. He was at the
[1:27:53] place where Jesus was one that
[1:27:55] understood his position and what he came
[1:27:58] to do. So what the Holy Spirit does in
[1:28:00] you when you receive the Holy Spirit, it
[1:28:03] trains you so you can get into position
[1:28:06] and know who you are.
[1:28:16] So no not not coming into
[1:28:20] rituals
[1:28:23] and commandment and but it's a communion
[1:28:27] between the creator and his creation.
[1:28:31] But I want to say one place that the
[1:28:34] bridegroom
[1:28:36] created his own bride.
[1:28:39] I love that the bridegroom created his
[1:28:43] own bride
[1:28:47] in the beginning of creation. I love how
[1:28:49] the prophet said you will see that the
[1:28:53] description of the earth was without
[1:28:56] form and void. It says, "And then God
[1:28:59] said, let her be." And then he says,
[1:29:02] "The voice or the word that went forth
[1:29:06] took what was out of form and chaotic
[1:29:09] and all of that." He says, "Perhaps the
[1:29:11] clinker will fall for thousands and
[1:29:14] thousands and billions of years or
[1:29:16] whatever it will fall." He says, "What
[1:29:20] was he doing? He was creating you."
[1:29:25] And we put it into our mind as a
[1:29:29] creation being such a peaceful thing.
[1:29:31] No, there was thunders, there was
[1:29:35] earthquakes, there was shaking and
[1:29:37] things being brought out of foam. And my
[1:29:39] brother, my sister, your expression is
[1:29:41] no different. We see we want to have
[1:29:45] this where we say, "Oh, God, I want
[1:29:47] this." And then it happens. NO, GOD
[1:29:49] WANTS THAT BATTLE, that that raggedness.
[1:29:52] And I continue to say this because
[1:29:54] that's what life is all about. It's not
[1:29:56] a peaceful. It's bringing under
[1:29:59] subjection.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It's holding forth and say, "I will not
[1:30:03] let go."
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; It It's not a peaceful something where
[1:30:08] it just happened. No, it's you going on
[1:30:10] your knees and saying, "Lord, you give
[1:30:12] me life or I'll die."
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; It's the dying. BUT PAUL SAYS, IT SAYS,
[1:30:19] "I I DIE DAILY.
[1:30:22] I I RING EVERY DAY. I STAND UP AND I DIE
[1:30:25] AND I DIE SO THAT CHRIST MAY BE
[1:30:27] GLORIFIED.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Let me say death is not an easy thing.
[1:30:33] You got to look that man. How many times
[1:30:35] have you done something and you look at
[1:30:37] yourself, you just about to punch
[1:30:39] yourself in the face? I can't believe I
[1:30:41] did that.
[1:30:44] But what? IT'S THE DYING. YOU don't like
[1:30:47] what you see anymore. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
[1:30:49] BECAUSE the the SPIRIT IS NOW CALLING
[1:30:52] OUT FOR THE REAL EXPRESSION to come out.
[1:30:54] The spirit is LOOKING AND SAYING,
[1:30:56] "YOU'RE NOT doing what I want to do.
[1:30:58] EVERY TIME I WANT TO DO SOMETHING, YOU
[1:31:00] COME ALONG MY WAY AND YOU UNDERCUT ME.
[1:31:02] EVERY TIME I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING
[1:31:04] RIGHT, YOU PUT THE WRONG WORDS IN MY
[1:31:06] MOUTH. EVERY TIME I WANT TO SHOW LOVE,
[1:31:08] YOU SHOW HATRED AND EVERYTHING. YOU GO
[1:31:10] TO BATTLE WITH THAT PERSON, WITH
[1:31:13] YOURSELF." THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID,
[1:31:15] "YOU HAVE TO DOUBT YOUR OWN DOUBT. YOU
[1:31:17] HAVE TO TAKE THAT MAN AND KICK HIM out
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; in order for the expression
[1:31:29] to come forth.
[1:31:32] When Jacob battled with an angel,
[1:31:37] the scripture says
[1:31:39] he touched the hollow of the tide
[1:31:42] and he came up limping.
[1:31:45] That's what happens when you fight with
[1:31:47] God. This flesh becomes so weak
[1:31:52] and you look there's no beauty to be
[1:31:54] desired of the flesh.
[1:31:57] That's the flesh that the expression
[1:31:59] will start to come out from. It's not
[1:32:01] when the flesh is strong and all well.
[1:32:04] No, it's when the flesh can stand there
[1:32:06] and say, "I can't do anything except the
[1:32:09] spirit come upon me. I won't speak
[1:32:12] unless he speaks for me." He says that's
[1:32:14] what the bride is in the end time. He
[1:32:15] says he says the brother the the bride
[1:32:19] says she won't say anything unless he
[1:32:22] says
[1:32:23] she's she speaks what he speaks. She's
[1:32:26] quiet when he doesn't speak. She doesn't
[1:32:28] have a mind of her own. She has the mind
[1:32:31] of Christ dwelling in her.
[1:32:38] So the same life that was in Christ flow
[1:32:40] through the believers. The complete
[1:32:43] cycle of redemption God manifested in
[1:32:45] flesh again. This time is not in one
[1:32:48] flesh and in many many members flesh
[1:32:53] but for the purpose of manifesting the
[1:32:55] same life. Why? Because we have an
[1:32:58] example. The she wave offering is that
[1:33:02] in the end time that we may know that
[1:33:04] once again the fullness will be
[1:33:06] manifested in the mankind. What was it?
[1:33:09] Vabanam is to us that she wave offering.
[1:33:13] Vabanam says what resurrection that was
[1:33:15] the first resurrection. What
[1:33:17] resurrection this is? What is it? It was
[1:33:19] Christ. Now it was uniting time and to
[1:33:24] that was the sign to us that this is the
[1:33:26] uniting time. What is it? God wanted to
[1:33:29] dwell in human being again. He will
[1:33:32] stand there and said, "Oh, I love some
[1:33:34] of the things he said." He says, "What
[1:33:35] if Jesus was standing here with this
[1:33:38] suit here?"
[1:33:42] And people will say, "Oh, are you saying
[1:33:44] that Venom was God?" No, he wasn't. He
[1:33:46] was a yielded vessel. And you know what?
[1:33:50] So are you. Your body is the temple of
[1:34:00] these hands were made to worship God.
[1:34:03] Your feet were made to go do good
[1:34:05] things, not bad things. Not to run after
[1:34:08] the things of the world, to run. Your
[1:34:10] body, this body here was made for you to
[1:34:14] speak the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:16] Christ.
[1:34:18] The heart that he given you is for you
[1:34:20] to love others, not to hate.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; He He came and he stood there. He was
[1:34:28] the she offering. He came and he created
[1:34:31] the squirrel. He shows us that God will
[1:34:33] provide for your need. Not that we need
[1:34:36] to go and create scrolls, but we know
[1:34:38] that when we have need of something, God
[1:34:40] will provide in that time. That we can
[1:34:42] speak the word and say, "Father, I have
[1:34:44] need of this and it's going to come to
[1:34:46] pass."
[1:34:49] Why? It was the same life. Now, you
[1:34:52] could say that was a prophet, but
[1:34:54] remember the prophet, you can't separate
[1:34:56] the prophet, the messenger, the
[1:34:58] messenger as it's been told to us. Why?
[1:35:00] because he can't just speak it and not
[1:35:03] show us what that is because his own
[1:35:05] life will also reflect what is it that
[1:35:08] he's preaching.
[1:35:10] But one says I believe in the rising of
[1:35:12] the sun or somewhere says you cannot be
[1:35:15] something that you don't know or you can
[1:35:18] only be what you are pointing to.
[1:35:22] We have to know what is it that we are
[1:35:24] pointing to and we are pointing to the
[1:35:26] Lord Jesus Christ. In fact, let me read
[1:35:29] this. Let me just uh skip you and read
[1:35:32] for the sake of time.
[1:35:35] He says this. He says in the message
[1:35:38] deity of Jesus Christ and I love this.
[1:35:40] He says and the same power the same
[1:35:42] Christ hallelujah the fundamentalist let
[1:35:45] them let them let let them people who
[1:35:47] deny the power of God say it's wrong.
[1:35:50] But the same power that spoke the world
[1:35:52] into existence in those people. It is in
[1:35:55] those people that's got the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:57] Same power. And it says, "That's right,
[1:35:59] men and women. It's time that we found
[1:36:02] out who we are."
[1:36:04] The devil is trying to hide you back and
[1:36:07] tell you that you are some uh little
[1:36:09] downtrodden something. You are not. You
[1:36:11] are sons and daughters of God. This
[1:36:14] isn't a message deity. Paragraph 80. He
[1:36:17] says, "Deity is not in heaven. It's in
[1:36:20] you."
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:36:27] I hope we caught that.
[1:36:30] Let me even continue on. It says, "I
[1:36:32] know." It says, "I know you think I'm
[1:36:36] crazy."
[1:36:38] But let me tell you something, brother.
[1:36:40] When you re, excuse me, when you realize
[1:36:45] the almighty God lives in you, immortal
[1:36:47] life, Zoe, I give you Zoey life, the
[1:36:52] life of God in a human being. It says,
[1:36:54] "And brother and sister, deities it is
[1:36:56] in you." the it says in a little while
[1:36:58] the world will see me no more yet you
[1:37:01] shall see me I'll be with you and even
[1:37:03] in you till the end of time now listen
[1:37:06] to this this is the part that I really
[1:37:07] want you so he says God is in you and
[1:37:10] now it says Christ in the manger no
[1:37:13] Christ in you hallelujah listen to this
[1:37:16] we are worshiping Christ we are not
[1:37:19] worshiping Christ in the manger but we
[1:37:21] are worshiping Christ in you says the
[1:37:24] Holy Ghost uh the hope of life, the
[1:37:27] creator, God himself dwelling in the
[1:37:31] human being.
[1:37:34] So when you actually worshiping, you're
[1:37:37] not worshiping some creature in heaven.
[1:37:40] You are worshiping that is that which
[1:37:42] dwells in you.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; This is the message of the hour. And
[1:37:52] that's why I started off with identity.
[1:37:54] My brother and my sister, we have
[1:37:56] received so much of the word that it's
[1:37:59] so important that we ask to put it in
[1:38:01] perspective. Otherwise, we we tend to
[1:38:04] take the message and dilute it back into
[1:38:06] the denomination where we keep putting
[1:38:09] Christ back in heaven, Christ back in
[1:38:10] the cross, Christ back here. The only
[1:38:13] place where he wants to be, we are not
[1:38:15] taking him there.
[1:38:19] In fact, we even come to service, we see
[1:38:21] Christ in the preacher. We see Christ in
[1:38:23] the person sitting next to you. And the
[1:38:25] only place you don't see him is Christ
[1:38:26] in you. What good is that for?
[1:38:32] I'm not here to give you some teaching
[1:38:34] or something you never heard. I'm here
[1:38:36] to emphasize who God has already made
[1:38:39] you to be. I'm just telling you. And you
[1:38:41] say, "How much do we need to hear it?"
[1:38:43] KEEP HEARING IT UNTIL YOU BELIEVE IT.
[1:38:47] Keep keep hearing IT UNTIL SOMETHING IN
[1:38:50] YOU GETS QUICKENED AND LIFE BEGIN TO
[1:38:53] MANIFEST.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE LAW OF identification says
[1:38:57] that if you tell a child something that
[1:39:00] one day they will become CALL YOUR SON A
[1:39:02] LIAR EVERY DAY DON'T be surprised one
[1:39:04] day if he lies.
[1:39:09] You're a liar. You're a liar. You're a
[1:39:10] liar. Well guess what? One day
[1:39:13] identification is going to happen. and
[1:39:16] they're going to come and they said,
[1:39:17] "Didn't you say I was a liar?"
[1:39:23] But I'm trying to say, the point I'm
[1:39:25] trying to make is it's not that we are
[1:39:27] becoming something we were not. He's
[1:39:30] just keep emphasizing so we can come
[1:39:33] into the realization of the work that's
[1:39:36] been made. Barbanam says it says if
[1:39:38] Jesus was here today he couldn't do one
[1:39:42] more thing except what he already
[1:39:44] promised to do.
[1:39:48] He talked about the artisian well. He
[1:39:51] said you can cry out and say oh water
[1:39:55] come up this way.
[1:39:57] Water is not made to go upstream.
[1:40:01] Water is made to come downstream. And
[1:40:05] what is that is that God will only do
[1:40:08] what he promised he will do.
[1:40:15] So
[1:40:17] as we said
[1:40:22] make for the expression God made in
[1:40:24] flesh and and and and and that because
[1:40:27] by deity nature dominion and expression
[1:40:30] has to come forth and so that's why we
[1:40:33] have to be to understand that that that
[1:40:35] our flesh and and and and you look
[1:40:38] around and everything you you realize
[1:40:40] what the Lord is doing from your your
[1:40:43] saving or even this morning if you are
[1:40:45] not saved and you haven't received the
[1:40:47] Holy Spirit but what God is trying to do
[1:40:49] is to bring you into the knowledge of
[1:40:51] himself and once you are saved what he's
[1:40:54] trying to do is to bring you into the
[1:40:57] expression of that which you already
[1:40:59] existed in that's why I called it it's
[1:41:02] the journey of self-discovery so it's
[1:41:04] not us discovering something that we
[1:41:06] were not but yet is that which is inside
[1:41:09] of us coming to the surface so we may
[1:41:12] know and understand that God was is in
[1:41:16] us and is becoming an expression that
[1:41:18] can be seen everywhere. So because
[1:41:21] remember he says the least of the desire
[1:41:24] that you have in your heart
[1:41:27] the least of the desire if you say if
[1:41:30] this morning you say oh I want to serve
[1:41:33] God
[1:41:34] that alone is enough to overcome every
[1:41:38] darkness
[1:41:40] that's a quote
[1:41:44] the least he didn't say the biggest the
[1:41:47] least of your desire to just say Lord I
[1:41:50] want to serve you with all my life. Say
[1:41:52] it in sincerity. That alone is enough
[1:41:55] power to overcome every devil and every
[1:41:58] darkness in your life.
[1:42:03] So that's why we don't we don't want to
[1:42:07] be a people that live under our
[1:42:08] privileges, but we want to come into the
[1:42:11] the the place where we we use that which
[1:42:14] has been given to us so we can overcome
[1:42:17] the darkness that we find ourselves. So
[1:42:19] Christ died. He didn't die to pay a
[1:42:22] partial payments and and pay and say,
[1:42:25] "Well, I'll pay this, but this you got
[1:42:26] to do on your own." No. The penalty of
[1:42:29] sin as far as the world is concerned,
[1:42:31] the scripture will say that Christ died
[1:42:34] for the sins of the whole world.
[1:42:37] So if anybody on the planet earth today
[1:42:40] will say that I want to serve Christ,
[1:42:42] they have the capability to do that. But
[1:42:45] what they lacking is the nature and the
[1:42:47] desire within them to seek Christ.
[1:42:49] That's why Brandham says only the elect
[1:42:52] will receive it. Because why? They were
[1:42:54] predestinated to receive it. And how do
[1:42:56] you know you are predestinated? If
[1:42:58] there's something in you that cries out
[1:43:01] for God,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; that means he's made you to receive it.
[1:43:06] And and I want to say this, you couldn't
[1:43:08] wake up in the morning 8:00 a.m. and and
[1:43:11] get right ready and do all of that you
[1:43:13] need to do to be here in church just so
[1:43:15] you can be. I believe with all my heart
[1:43:17] you here because there's something in
[1:43:19] you to receive him.
[1:43:23] It says look
[1:43:27] Christ in you makes you the center.
[1:43:30] Christ in you makes him the center of
[1:43:33] life of the revelation. See, Christ's
[1:43:36] life in you makes him the center of the
[1:43:40] revelation. Christ in the bride makes
[1:43:44] the Bible the complete revelation of
[1:43:46] Christ. Christ in you makes you, not
[1:43:51] him, makes you the complete revelation
[1:43:54] of the whole thing.
[1:44:01] I can't wait till that day. You know, we
[1:44:03] sing that way that song, here comes the
[1:44:06] bride. I I tell you, all the ages, the
[1:44:08] bride of all the ages will line up and
[1:44:11] and they'll be walking and Christ will
[1:44:12] look and say, "This is what my blood is
[1:44:15] able to do. This is what I paid for.
[1:44:18] This is what I I I tell you, the bride
[1:44:20] is a special class of people. Will there
[1:44:22] be people saved?" Yeah, there will be
[1:44:24] people around the city as the prophet
[1:44:25] told us. But the only the elected of
[1:44:28] every generation are those that have
[1:44:30] been specially chosen for this. And I
[1:44:33] want to say this, I'm just thankful to
[1:44:35] be chosen. I I know I don't have any
[1:44:38] ability in me whatsoever. And often
[1:44:42] time, you know what what believers do is
[1:44:44] they take preachers and they elevate
[1:44:46] them. And there's nothing wrong with
[1:44:48] that in some senses. But let me say
[1:44:50] this. I still have to overcome in life
[1:44:52] just like you do.
[1:44:54] I still have to make wrong decisions and
[1:44:56] correct them and do all of that. I was
[1:44:58] sharing with the brothers and I remember
[1:45:00] just being a young Christian and and I
[1:45:02] went and and and I got a job. I I was
[1:45:05] looking for a job really desperate and I
[1:45:08] I got this job and they told me that I
[1:45:10] would work on Wednesdays.
[1:45:13] Well, you know, in my mind I'm like,
[1:45:14] well, I still come to church on w on on
[1:45:17] Sundays, so that should be fine. And
[1:45:19] then you know and then I knew that they
[1:45:21] told me that well uh you go to a
[1:45:25] probation period and after that you you
[1:45:27] you become full-time but but then after
[1:45:29] that you can switch. So I said okay I
[1:45:32] will I will do that. Then I took the job
[1:45:33] and and everything and and I took the
[1:45:36] job and I continue. So when the
[1:45:38] probation time came my desire was always
[1:45:40] to go back. So I went to my supervisor
[1:45:43] and said hey I want to go back and and
[1:45:45] everything. So they put my name on the
[1:45:47] waiting list and everything and all of
[1:45:49] the sudden the position opened. So I
[1:45:51] went and I took the position. I went. So
[1:45:53] I take the position. A day or two later
[1:45:56] my supervisor comes back and say, "Well,
[1:45:58] guess what? I need you back on the other
[1:46:00] shift." I said, "Oh no."
[1:46:04] And I said, "Well," and then in my heart
[1:46:06] I'm like, "Well, I already this is what
[1:46:08] my was my heart desire. What's going
[1:46:10] on?" And I like, "No, I can't take it."
[1:46:12] He's like, "Okay, I'll make you a
[1:46:13] proposition." He he came to where he
[1:46:18] offered almost close to double what I
[1:46:21] was making for me to take back the
[1:46:23] position that I had before.
[1:46:26] My my my
[1:46:28] you talk about cars breaking and and
[1:46:32] things going wrong and all of you all of
[1:46:34] the sudden realizing that you need
[1:46:36] money. I mean, you know, you want to do
[1:46:39] this and then in your ears you hear if
[1:46:42] you if you get that job, you could get
[1:46:44] money to do this. And you know, if you
[1:46:46] get that job, you'll get money to do
[1:46:47] that. And and all of the sudden and I
[1:46:49] and I went and I prayed about it and
[1:46:51] everything. And so and I said, "Okay,
[1:46:53] give me some time." And he gave me time
[1:46:55] and I said, and I called him. I said,
[1:46:56] "Can I talk to you?" I said, he said,
[1:46:58] "Yes." So I came and I walked in his
[1:47:00] office. He's like, "Okay, so are we
[1:47:02] ready to go?" I said, "Okay, here's what
[1:47:03] we'll do." So, we work from Monday
[1:47:05] through Friday, I believe, or Thursday.
[1:47:07] I don't remember. I said, "Okay,
[1:47:10] I'll come in Monday. I would come in
[1:47:12] early and I'll work till your shift and
[1:47:15] everything and I'll do that on Tuesday.
[1:47:17] I'll do that Thursday. I'll do that
[1:47:19] Friday. And what I want you to do is to
[1:47:22] get somebody else for that position and
[1:47:24] I will train them however long it takes
[1:47:27] until you feel comfortable that they can
[1:47:29] do the job." And then he looked at me
[1:47:31] and said, and I said, "But you know
[1:47:33] what? You don't have to pay me that
[1:47:35] extra money.
[1:47:38] Now, you talk about silence.
[1:47:41] You talk about awkwardness.
[1:47:44] He looked at me and he thought I was
[1:47:46] crazy. And you know what? I was.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; It's just I was crazy for Christ.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; I was crazy for him. Was I a preacher?
[1:47:55] No. This is a believer. It's just I
[1:47:59] wanted to be in church. I wanted to be
[1:48:01] there for Christ. I I made a mistake,
[1:48:03] but I I needed a way to figure out a way
[1:48:06] to correct it. And I asked God, I said,
[1:48:08] "If I get the opportunity, I will do
[1:48:10] it." And and I got the opportunity,
[1:48:13] right? When I get the opportunity, the
[1:48:15] devil was right there to bring me right
[1:48:17] back in. And I took And did things go
[1:48:21] wrong? Oh yes. Oh yes. I mean, you talk
[1:48:25] about the the battle. I mean, you woke
[1:48:28] up and every if you didn't get that
[1:48:30] money, you wouldn't have to worry about
[1:48:32] breakfast. If you got that money, you
[1:48:34] wouldn't have to worry about gas money.
[1:48:35] If you worry about money, you wouldn't
[1:48:37] have to worry about going out to eat.
[1:48:39] Now, everybody's going out to eat you
[1:48:40] here. And and and I constantly and I
[1:48:43] said, "You know what? It's already
[1:48:45] done." And that's all of it.
[1:48:48] Not even long after
[1:48:51] they opened a new position that never
[1:48:53] existed
[1:48:55] in the first shift that I was in. And
[1:48:58] that's the job I've had for over 20s
[1:49:00] something years.
[1:49:07] And I'm just saying it. I don't know who
[1:49:08] need it. I'm just here to speak and
[1:49:10] encourage somebody. You take God at his
[1:49:13] word, God will come through.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; You put him first. I don't care. He told
[1:49:19] that uh that that woman of serap he said
[1:49:22] he didn't say that the curse will grow,
[1:49:25] the oil will fill and the flower will
[1:49:27] fill. No, he said every time you reach
[1:49:29] in to get it, it will still be there.
[1:49:32] That's the kind of God we serve. I tell
[1:49:35] you, he's not going to take just care of
[1:49:36] your supernatural. He has to take care
[1:49:38] of the natural, both the spiritual. He's
[1:49:41] a provider. Let me say this. the earth
[1:49:43] that you see the grain grows by the word
[1:49:46] of God.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; You You remember there's times in Israel
[1:49:50] where it says it's not going to rain.
[1:49:54] He He can cause the grain not to come
[1:49:56] out. You can plant and nothing comes
[1:49:59] out. He still has control over even the
[1:50:01] natural. Even though men shall not live
[1:50:03] by bread alone, it's both the natural
[1:50:06] and the spiritual.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; It's by his word. So, if I can encourage
[1:50:10] you this morning, take God at his word.
[1:50:13] Don't never give up. If you really want
[1:50:16] to know who God is, he's looking for
[1:50:18] people that can stand there. Endurance
[1:50:21] is what's needed in this age that we are
[1:50:23] living in. This is not the age of babes.
[1:50:26] This is the age of maturity where we
[1:50:29] stand in the presence of the sun until
[1:50:31] all the greens is baked out of us.
[1:50:40] He says, "What's the new birth?"
[1:50:43] And I love this.
[1:50:46] You would say, "Well, brother Brennan,
[1:50:48] what is the new birth?" It says, "It's
[1:50:50] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:50:53] personally to you.
[1:50:56] Christ making himself known to you." And
[1:51:01] let me say this, that expression is
[1:51:04] tailor made to be individual.
[1:51:08] You can't compare it with any other
[1:51:10] expression. It produces the same Christ,
[1:51:13] but it's different.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; You can't look at an experience and say,
[1:51:17] "Oh, you know, this one was in the
[1:51:19] world. It did this and this. I need to
[1:51:21] go in the world so I can get the same
[1:51:22] experience." No.
[1:51:25] Whatever your upbringing is, whatever
[1:51:28] experience you've gone through, but
[1:51:30] Ranam says it's those deserts of
[1:51:32] experiences where righteousness,
[1:51:34] righteous men are molded into saints. In
[1:51:37] other words, he's making you a
[1:51:38] tailormade Christian in his own image.
[1:51:42] Not in the image of the pastor, not in
[1:51:44] the mean of any other minister, not in
[1:51:47] the image of of your parents. You are
[1:51:49] your own unique image that he can look
[1:51:52] and say, "That's me." And you know what?
[1:51:55] When that expression comes out, no
[1:51:56] matter who it is, you look at it, you
[1:51:58] say, "That's Christ
[1:52:01] manifested in many members body."
[1:52:05] It says, "But God's great mystery,
[1:52:10] what the eternal God had,
[1:52:15] he had a mystery that has been unfolding
[1:52:18] in Christ, then began right down to his
[1:52:21] church." What was once in God's mind is
[1:52:25] now in the body of Christ.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; There are no mystery left. You are the
[1:52:33] unfolding of the mystery in the end
[1:52:35] time.
[1:52:37] Jesus making love to the church, his
[1:52:40] bride, whispering secret to her.
[1:52:47] It's personal.
[1:52:49] is not remember in Laudian church ages
[1:52:52] Christ find himself outside of his own
[1:52:55] church
[1:52:58] outside of think about it he started the
[1:53:00] church but it got so bad towards all the
[1:53:04] way to the end by the time you get to
[1:53:06] the end he the creator he the beginner
[1:53:09] of the church he's actually at the
[1:53:11] outside but that's why says in the end
[1:53:13] time he's not knocking at the church as
[1:53:16] the building as the people as a group
[1:53:18] He's knocking at each and every
[1:53:20] individual door so he can come and s
[1:53:24] with you and you with him. Individual
[1:53:27] relationship with each one of us so we
[1:53:30] can know him. It's Christ. He was made
[1:53:33] the fulfillment of the prophecy that was
[1:53:36] concerning him in the Old Testament.
[1:53:38] He's here to express himself in the end
[1:53:41] time. And you get that's why it's
[1:53:44] important we come here. We say I'm not
[1:53:46] here to express darkness. Oh, no. I'm
[1:53:49] not here to express whatever the world
[1:53:52] is doing. I'm not here to be caught up
[1:53:55] in what the world is and everything. I'm
[1:53:57] here to express Christ in this dying
[1:53:59] generation. That's my mission. That's my
[1:54:02] life. And you have to believe that
[1:54:07] you and and I don't care like I said
[1:54:10] whether you make a mistake. You have to
[1:54:12] say I have been predestinated by God to
[1:54:17] shine light in this dying generation.
[1:54:21] Do I do it at every second and every
[1:54:23] moment? No. Sometimes you know you know
[1:54:26] we're talking you know they say misery
[1:54:29] love company. Somebody may be talking
[1:54:31] negative and it's easy with the flesh to
[1:54:33] just jump in in there and contribute.
[1:54:36] But that's the thing you got to look out
[1:54:38] for. You have to it can get negative,
[1:54:42] but you have to remind yourself that
[1:54:45] negativity and all of those and darkness
[1:54:47] will continue. I'm here to at least for
[1:54:50] the time that I'm here to shine light on
[1:54:53] this dying generation. But Ram says in
[1:54:56] the message, how can I overcome? He says
[1:54:58] it's just like the little uh uh given an
[1:55:02] example. He says that like the lily I
[1:55:04] think one that's one of the most
[1:55:05] prettiest flower. It's I'm very fond of
[1:55:08] those great color lily and the pond
[1:55:10] lily. And I think there's nothing as
[1:55:12] hardly as pretty as this great pond
[1:55:14] lily. Now I want to ask you what is it
[1:55:17] that makes the lily the most beautiful
[1:55:20] flower?
[1:55:22] He's going to tell us just a moment. He
[1:55:24] says, uh, and I think there's nothing as
[1:55:27] hardly as pretty as the pond lily. You
[1:55:29] call it water lily. It's radiant. Now,
[1:55:32] where does it come from? It says, now
[1:55:36] he's expressing the lily is the little
[1:55:39] seed
[1:55:40] down in the bottom of the muddy muck
[1:55:44] pond. that little seed yet all the
[1:55:48] radiance that it's ever had in it and is
[1:55:51] right in there when it's in the muck.
[1:55:55] But it has to strive daily
[1:55:58] knowing that there is something out
[1:56:01] there knowing it's black, it's dirty,
[1:56:05] it's mucky, it's limey, it's lime that
[1:56:08] it's living in. Yes, it presses its way
[1:56:11] through the mud, the muck, and the water
[1:56:14] and the stagnant places until it sticks
[1:56:18] his head above the light.
[1:56:22] That Let me say this. That's the
[1:56:24] description of your life this morning.
[1:56:26] That's the description of my life. We
[1:56:28] have to stick our hands up in the
[1:56:30] market. You know why we do that? The sun
[1:56:33] is calling. You know why the sun is
[1:56:35] calling and said, "Come, there's light
[1:56:37] on the other side." HE SAID, "YEAH, BUT
[1:56:39] I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING." IT SAYS, "KEEP
[1:56:41] pressing on, son. Keep pressing on. KEEP
[1:56:44] PRESS." OH, I DON'T SEE PROGRESS. YOU
[1:56:46] DON'T MEASURE YOUR PROGRESS BY YOUR OWN
[1:56:48] SELF. YOU JUST TAKE THE WORD AND
[1:56:49] CONTINUE TO PRESS ON AND PRESS ON. ONE
[1:56:52] DAY, YOU'LL COME OUT TO THE LIGHT.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a fight in you.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; You got to be like that. But whenam says
[1:57:04] it's not the size of the dog but it's
[1:57:07] the size of the fight in the dog.
[1:57:11] You know I'm a very you know
[1:57:15] you know lay down and but I have a lot
[1:57:18] of Christian fight in me. I I just I
[1:57:21] just love God. I was telling brother
[1:57:23] Jonathan I can talk about God from
[1:57:25] sunrise to sunset. There's just
[1:57:27] something in the hearts of the believer
[1:57:29] that rejoices to hear more about him.
[1:57:32] You can never hear enough about him.
[1:57:37] What is that? There's got to be a fight.
[1:57:39] He created you with a fight in you.
[1:57:43] Until he sticks his head up in the
[1:57:45] light, it says expressing
[1:57:48] what was hidden in her all the time.
[1:57:55] Journey of selfdiscovery,
[1:57:58] he said. And I think and let me just
[1:58:00] skip for the sake of time. It says God
[1:58:03] by predestination.
[1:58:05] See, he brought his seed.
[1:58:09] He brought he this seed of life
[1:58:14] and expressing itself. See, coming to
[1:58:16] the light. And now on top of all of
[1:58:18] that, it's an o it's an overcomer. It
[1:58:22] doesn't express itself down there.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; The expression is not down there. when
[1:58:29] you in says I'll read it when you were
[1:58:32] in the world you were not expressing
[1:58:34] Christ you expressing whatever the flesh
[1:58:36] wanted to you did whatever it says when
[1:58:40] you were uh uh uh you that were once in
[1:58:42] sin and trespasses you walk according to
[1:58:44] your the the the lust of the flesh and
[1:58:46] the lust of the world and all of those
[1:58:48] things you did all of that but within
[1:58:50] you there was the ability of expressing
[1:58:54] God and you didn't even know it
[1:58:57] some people had to call it out of you.
[1:59:00] Somebody even had to tell you, but
[1:59:02] somehow somewhere in due season when
[1:59:05] your time came, God came knocking at
[1:59:08] your door. It said, "Now it's your time.
[1:59:10] I want to s with you."
[1:59:16] Now,
[1:59:18] this expression is not going to come by
[1:59:21] your might and your power. It's going to
[1:59:24] come by his spirit working in you. And
[1:59:27] what one of them spoke in the
[1:59:28] masterpiece and if I could just what
[1:59:32] Jonathan here just if you could come I
[1:59:34] hope I don't embarrass you. Yeah just
[1:59:35] come for a second here. I hope this is
[1:59:38] okay.
[1:59:40] I hope I'm not embarrassing you. You're
[1:59:42] good right? Oh you look sharp. You look
[1:59:44] good. You look very great.
[1:59:50] I think about when talks about
[1:59:54] Michelangelo,
[1:59:56] the great sculptor, and he said that he
[1:59:59] had a vision
[2:00:02] of what the statue of Moses had to look
[2:00:04] like.
[2:00:06] And
[2:00:09] this
[2:00:11] stone or the rock or the marble that he
[2:00:14] used and I had a chance to see it. I was
[2:00:16] in California. I went to that cemetery
[2:00:19] place. I forgot what they call it. And I
[2:00:21] had a chance to to see this one replica.
[2:00:24] I don't know if it original or replica
[2:00:26] there that I was able to see. And
[2:00:30] the stone
[2:00:32] or the marble was predestinated.
[2:00:37] Are you with me this morning?
[2:00:40] I'm just hoping I go really slow so even
[2:00:43] the young kids can get it because I feel
[2:00:45] like sometimes we're pissed to the
[2:00:47] older, we leave the younger ones. So
[2:00:48] this is for you.
[2:00:51] And
[2:00:52] it didn't matter how much I told the
[2:00:55] stone about its predestination.
[2:00:59] It has no ability within itself to
[2:01:02] produce it.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:01:06] The word is not preached to your flesh.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; The word is preached to the soul
[2:01:18] because when the soul gets it,
[2:01:21] the flesh will will will come under the
[2:01:24] subjection. Don't forget that.
[2:01:27] So he he he had the vision and I love it
[2:01:32] because the prophet even doesn't say I
[2:01:34] don't even think he wrote it on paper
[2:01:35] and everything he had the vision and and
[2:01:38] if you know what an artist is artist is
[2:01:41] they are very obsessed people just want
[2:01:45] you very obsessed with details
[2:01:49] and
[2:01:50] the only way for that marble to bring
[2:01:54] out that image it was for it to submit
[2:01:58] itself to the author,
[2:02:02] the one who had the vision. So he can
[2:02:05] take the vision from his mind and bring
[2:02:08] out the expression
[2:02:10] out of the model.
[2:02:14] Butam says Moses Moses the parents told
[2:02:17] him he was called. He grew up all his
[2:02:19] life knowing that he was called to be
[2:02:22] the deliverer. But when he went in his
[2:02:25] own might, he failed. He had to meet the
[2:02:29] one
[2:02:31] who made the promise and called him to
[2:02:33] be the deliverer. Only then he could
[2:02:38] bring it to come to pass.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? So when we
[2:02:43] come to church and hear the word of God,
[2:02:46] we got to come in contact with Jesus
[2:02:48] Christ himself.
[2:02:51] The word will produce what he said. But
[2:02:54] there has to be a contact
[2:02:57] with that God of the promise and say, "I
[2:03:00] heard of your promise. I'm here so you
[2:03:03] can bring the promise out of me."
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; The mistake we made is we take the
[2:03:09] promise and we go do our own molding.
[2:03:12] You know, we look at our imagine how
[2:03:14] strange that is. and you take the hammer
[2:03:16] and the chisel and you go, you know,
[2:03:20] you're making a monster. You may make
[2:03:23] something that look identical, but
[2:03:24] there's no life in it. There's no
[2:03:26] imprint of the master on it. There's no
[2:03:29] masterership. The scripture says that we
[2:03:32] are his workmanship.
[2:03:36] So the requirement what says he says the
[2:03:40] bride cannot even stand still long
[2:03:42] enough.
[2:03:46] We run over here. We run over there. I
[2:03:48] like this. I like that. Oh no. I'm not
[2:03:50] this anymore. I'm that. No. What he
[2:03:53] wants is for you to stand still and let
[2:03:56] him take the chisel and the hammer and
[2:03:58] begin to do the work. Now some of the
[2:04:01] pieces may be hard to take off.
[2:04:05] You know, when you get to the fingers
[2:04:07] and the details that has to go in the
[2:04:09] work, it's not the same as chipping the
[2:04:11] blocks that are on the side. When you
[2:04:13] come to the details of what that's
[2:04:15] supposed to be, it's not as easy as the
[2:04:18] others. But the trust is in that he has
[2:04:22] the image, but when I'm says the whole
[2:04:24] creation is like one piece of the the
[2:04:27] clay is just like one piece of a fabric.
[2:04:30] the God cut off the predestinated
[2:04:34] uh fabric. He decides which part of the
[2:04:37] fabric is predestinated.
[2:04:39] We don't we just take him as he says,
[2:04:43] but we have to stand still and let him
[2:04:45] do the molding.
[2:04:47] It may hurt.
[2:04:51] Sometimes we may be joyful about it but
[2:04:54] if we stand still when all is said and
[2:04:57] done we will come into the real image
[2:05:01] but calls it the living image of the
[2:05:05] living God.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:05:10] The living image of the living God. Not
[2:05:14] a performance.
[2:05:16] Not what I can show forth. No, I I keep
[2:05:20] saying this true new birth gives you
[2:05:23] humility
[2:05:25] because you know you are undeserving.
[2:05:28] You know you are incapable. However long
[2:05:31] you walk with him, you still know that
[2:05:33] I'm not deserving of this.
[2:05:41] It says,
[2:05:49] it says, God by predestination
[2:05:52] saw and brought the seed to life and
[2:05:54] says coming to the light. And now on top
[2:05:56] of all of that, it has overcome. It has
[2:05:59] overcome.
[2:06:05] Has overcome. It says It it it doesn't
[2:06:09] it it says it doesn't have itself. It
[2:06:12] doesn't express itself down there. It
[2:06:14] gets up here and then express itself.
[2:06:16] Neither did you when you were in sin and
[2:06:18] adultery and everything that you lived
[2:06:20] in. You didn't express nothing.
[2:06:24] Oh my good. I mean in fact you thought
[2:06:26] you were it.
[2:06:29] I mean you know it's like being a
[2:06:30] teenager. You think you know everything.
[2:06:32] I mean it's like you think you know you
[2:06:35] all of the sudden your parents becomes
[2:06:36] dumb. and they don't know anything. All
[2:06:39] of the sudden you feel like
[2:06:41] I've acquired so much knowledge
[2:06:45] and I feel like we have to go through
[2:06:47] that journey so God can humble us
[2:06:49] somehow. And then you get old and then
[2:06:52] and then every day you walk and say, "Oh
[2:06:53] Lord, I have no nothing. Oh Lord, I know
[2:06:56] nothing." Because you realize the more
[2:06:59] you know, the less you don't know.
[2:07:03] The more you know, the more you realize,
[2:07:05] the more there is to know. And you
[2:07:08] realize the only thing to know really is
[2:07:10] to know that it's him that does all
[2:07:11] things.
[2:07:16] But there's a seed in there and you got
[2:07:18] a chance to express itself to light. And
[2:07:20] now you are pressing, you are in the
[2:07:22] presence of Jesus Christ, the sunlight.
[2:07:25] And it brought you out.
[2:07:28] It brought it brought out what you
[2:07:30] really was in the beginning. See what I
[2:07:33] mean? You saw the light. You bloomed
[2:07:36] out. You laid out your heart open. And
[2:07:39] now you are a lily.
[2:07:43] You saw the light. You bloomed out. You
[2:07:46] laid your heart open.
[2:07:49] And now you are a lily. The only way to
[2:07:52] express it is by him coming and
[2:07:56] [clears throat] making himself known
[2:07:57] making his light known unto you. He says
[2:08:00] in perfect faith, he says when we were
[2:08:02] in sin Elliot ended out of God. He says
[2:08:05] in the world in the muck and mud, he
[2:08:07] says as I talked this morning, God came
[2:08:09] to us. God sought us. You never sought
[2:08:12] God. No man can come to God except the
[2:08:14] father draws him first. God came down in
[2:08:17] the muck and you were that that uh what
[2:08:20] you were and he sought you out and
[2:08:22] brought you out to light. That ought to
[2:08:24] put perfect love into your uh perfect
[2:08:27] that that I create per uh perfect love.
[2:08:30] Look what what you was. Look what you
[2:08:33] are. What did that? He says somebody
[2:08:36] that loved you.
[2:08:40] Can't you have faith in what he's
[2:08:43] promised to you?
[2:08:45] Then really then real genuine love will
[2:08:49] create a confidence in his love in his
[2:08:52] word.
[2:08:56] Christianity is not built upon
[2:08:59] intellectual.
[2:09:01] You have to look at your life and lay it
[2:09:03] open and see what you was and see that
[2:09:07] something changed, something happened to
[2:09:10] you. to see that somebody somewhere put
[2:09:14] a different desire in you than everybody
[2:09:17] else. Somebody in you that loved you
[2:09:20] called you out. And let me say this,
[2:09:23] that's the foundation of Christian life.
[2:09:26] Anything you build, you build upon that.
[2:09:29] Because remember Peter says, "Who do men
[2:09:31] say that I am?" He says, "Well, the
[2:09:33] preacher told me you are this. The
[2:09:34] pastor told me you are this. That man
[2:09:36] said you are this." He looked at them.
[2:09:38] He says he didn't build this church upon
[2:09:40] what other people said. He says, "But
[2:09:42] who do you say that I am?" A personal
[2:09:45] identification. That's why he says the
[2:09:46] revelation up to you. The word was
[2:09:48] preached to you, but at the end it was
[2:09:51] what you heard him talk to you.
[2:09:56] Your own experience to know that God has
[2:10:00] talked to me. I'm here because I heard
[2:10:02] the voice of God. I love God. I love his
[2:10:05] word because there is something that's
[2:10:07] speaking to me. That's where you build
[2:10:10] upon.
[2:10:13] If you build upon intellect, you'll find
[2:10:15] somebody who knows more than you. You'll
[2:10:19] find somebody who knows better, who can
[2:10:20] explain better. And guess what? You will
[2:10:23] crumble your foundation and go build
[2:10:24] upon that.
[2:10:26] the only foundation that will last that
[2:10:28] he said that the gates of hell will will
[2:10:31] will that it will it will stand against
[2:10:33] the gates of hell and it's the
[2:10:35] revelation that you know within your own
[2:10:38] life that God saved me God spoke to me
[2:10:43] and if you don't know him that way he's
[2:10:45] giving you an opportunity this morning
[2:10:47] so you can hone him for yourself that
[2:10:51] you will know him for that personal
[2:10:53] experience with him you and him.
[2:11:02] He says,
[2:11:04] "He caught me when I was nothing, and
[2:11:07] I'm still nothing."
[2:11:10] But I'm in his hand.
[2:11:14] I love it. He says, "He caught me. He
[2:11:19] loved me when I was unlovable."
[2:11:23] Oh my. unlovable,
[2:11:26] rejected,
[2:11:28] left out. Nobody cared but he cared.
[2:11:33] And let me say this, don't ever look at
[2:11:35] your past as something to be frowned
[2:11:37] upon. I tell you, if you look at every
[2:11:40] single one of us, there's something in
[2:11:41] our lives that you can look and say, you
[2:11:44] know, I I don't know where that came
[2:11:46] from. I didn't choose the parents by
[2:11:48] which I would come from. You know,
[2:11:49] sometimes I talk about I remember being
[2:11:52] in college and I and I go to this
[2:11:54] interview with this professor. I'm
[2:11:56] talking about my own life and the
[2:11:58] prophet professor, he was white and he's
[2:12:01] turning red on my story.
[2:12:05] I mean, he's completely embarrassed and
[2:12:07] I'm the one telling the story.
[2:12:14] where you come, how you came to this
[2:12:16] world has no virtue at all. He chose to
[2:12:21] bring you that way so he can get the
[2:12:23] vessel that you are today. But what
[2:12:25] matters is what he wants to do with you.
[2:12:32] You can't dwell in the past. You can't
[2:12:33] drive a car every time looking at the
[2:12:36] past. Oh, I did that. I did that. The
[2:12:38] sin of the past, let me say this. It's
[2:12:40] either Jesus paid or he didn't pay for
[2:12:42] it. And if he paid for it, let's forget
[2:12:46] about it. In fact, the scripture says
[2:12:48] his mercies are new every morning. I was
[2:12:51] preaching at the church and I said, you
[2:12:53] can wake up today, you know, you have to
[2:12:55] be like I love the sport players and
[2:12:57] everything because they have such an
[2:12:59] attitude you won't understand. They will
[2:13:01] lose the game today and come up the next
[2:13:03] day. He says, "Oh, I forgot about all
[2:13:05] that happened yesterday."
[2:13:08] You're like, "You just lost a game
[2:13:10] yesterday." He's like, "Yeah."
[2:13:12] He says, "If I let what I lost
[2:13:14] yesterday, today, I won't be able to
[2:13:17] perform the way I should. I learn from
[2:13:20] my mistake, but I go forward completely.
[2:13:23] I know every day his mercies are brand
[2:13:25] new and and a new day." He's given me a
[2:13:30] brand new sheet of paper for me to
[2:13:32] express myself once again. As long as I
[2:13:35] have breath in my life, I want to take
[2:13:37] every opportunity of every day to
[2:13:40] express him.
[2:13:42] not to be caught up with what happened
[2:13:44] in the past. And let me say this, when
[2:13:45] God saves you, the past becomes just the
[2:13:48] history.
[2:13:51] I I can talk about myself as I was
[2:13:53] talking about somebody else. And people
[2:13:55] go, "Really?" I was like, "Oh, yeah.
[2:13:57] Aren't you ashamed
[2:14:00] of what?" Of the flesh, man. I mean, you
[2:14:04] haven't really seen what the flesh man
[2:14:06] can do. I guess
[2:14:09] this guy, he's no good.
[2:14:12] This guy, he's the one that you battle
[2:14:15] with. You are your own enemy.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Let the light of Christ shine abroad
[2:14:24] your heart and what he has promised. I'm
[2:14:27] sorry. I feel like I'm just talking too
[2:14:29] much. Let me try to get to where I can
[2:14:31] close. It says,
[2:14:34] "I was unlovable." The love of God, it
[2:14:36] says he changed you. It says just like
[2:14:39] the color sister said that time it says
[2:14:44] it says in her testimony she said I'm
[2:14:47] not what I ought to be but I'm not what
[2:14:50] I want to be but I'm it says and I'm not
[2:14:53] what I want to be but then I'm also not
[2:14:55] what I used to be.
[2:14:58] I know I'm not what I know what I have
[2:15:00] in me as a desire today is not what I
[2:15:02] used to have. God changed me. He gave me
[2:15:06] a desire to be a Christian, to love him,
[2:15:08] to serve him. She says she know she
[2:15:12] knowed that she had she had come from
[2:15:15] somewhere. Something happened and that's
[2:15:17] the way it is. If God when I was an
[2:15:20] alien from him, he loved me and he still
[2:15:24] he stooped down to get me and picked me
[2:15:27] up. That gives me confidence that he
[2:15:29] wants to use me.
[2:15:32] But says God cannot build the house
[2:15:35] unless he wants to live in it.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; H how who who's one that builds a house
[2:15:41] so he can leave it empty?
[2:15:46] You build a house so you can live in it.
[2:15:49] He made you so he can live in you.
[2:15:52] He says that gives me confidence that he
[2:15:55] wants to use me. He's got a purpose.
[2:15:57] He's got a purpose uh in doing it. And
[2:16:00] he says he's seen something enemy. He
[2:16:03] seen something. He seen something in
[2:16:05] you. He had he had a reason to save you.
[2:16:09] Look at the people that are unsafe
[2:16:11] today. Look at a million that could have
[2:16:13] uh uh uh took beside you, but he took
[2:16:16] you. Amen. He says, "No one can take
[2:16:19] your place." Amen. You are in God's
[2:16:22] economy. No one can do it. That's the
[2:16:25] love of God to you.
[2:16:30] God calls you and you say, "Why don't
[2:16:32] you pick so and so? He's better. Look at
[2:16:35] him. He's better looking. He's more
[2:16:37] articulate. He can He can He has the
[2:16:40] charisma."
[2:16:42] No,
[2:16:44] no. It's you that is calling. Not your
[2:16:47] neighbor, not your mother, not your
[2:16:49] sister. It's you.
[2:16:54] Don't Don't ponder it upon somebody
[2:16:57] else.
[2:16:59] or don't don't take your Christian life
[2:17:01] and pawn it upon the preacher. No, he's
[2:17:04] called you to live. And he says no one
[2:17:07] can take your place. And let me say
[2:17:09] this, God called you to be here in New
[2:17:12] Finland in this place that you are here
[2:17:15] so you can be his expression and nobody
[2:17:18] else can do it except you that are
[2:17:20] sitting here.
[2:17:27] That's the truth.
[2:17:29] This is your responsibility of the
[2:17:33] expression of God in the area that you
[2:17:35] are living in.
[2:17:37] Everywhere he puts you, you
[2:17:40] automatically become the responsible
[2:17:42] party for the expression of God into
[2:17:44] that place.
[2:17:50] It sounds scary, right? No.
[2:17:54] But he said that the same way that God
[2:17:57] God sent Jesus, the same way Jesus sent
[2:18:01] you. And he asked the question, he says,
[2:18:03] "How did God send Jesus?" He said, "The
[2:18:06] father that sent him dwell in him."
[2:18:13] And the same God, the same way he's
[2:18:14] sending you, he's repeating the same
[2:18:16] exact process. And he that is sending
[2:18:19] you, he's dwelling in you.
[2:18:23] If I can just admonish you this morning,
[2:18:26] don't be fearful. Don't be afraid. His
[2:18:29] ever present. His pres presence is
[2:18:32] walking with you every day. He's there
[2:18:34] to walk alongside of you. Don't let the
[2:18:38] complexes of the flesh take you away
[2:18:41] from what God wants to do. He wants to
[2:18:43] use you. He wants to be for you to be a
[2:18:46] light in your community, your schools,
[2:18:48] and the places and the people that you
[2:18:49] fellowship with. He wants to see that
[2:18:51] light continue. He doesn't want that
[2:18:54] light to just come and be manifested in
[2:18:57] the church. What good would that be if
[2:18:59] we just come and shout and oh praise God
[2:19:02] and then we go out there. We are just
[2:19:04] like anybody else.
[2:19:07] Right? The Christian life is not made to
[2:19:10] be here. It's made to be lived out
[2:19:12] there. In fact, the scripture says, but
[2:19:15] Renham said that's the reason why when
[2:19:18] after the day of Pentecost, God didn't
[2:19:21] keep them together. He spread them
[2:19:23] across the world. Why? Because they had
[2:19:27] to go and the expression had to be lived
[2:19:29] in every part of the world. And he
[2:19:32] didn't want it to just be together. You
[2:19:34] know, I've met brothers that say, "Oh,
[2:19:36] you know, I wish I could get a job at
[2:19:38] the Christian place and do this and, you
[2:19:40] know, just be among brothers and every
[2:19:42] day." But that's good. But the
[2:19:46] expression is got to be lived out, too.
[2:19:48] The world has to see it on display, too.
[2:19:50] It's good to have a job in the
[2:19:52] Christian. It's wonderful. If I get one,
[2:19:54] would I take it? Yes. But that's not the
[2:19:57] end of it. He wants the expression to be
[2:19:59] lived in the dying world. He says that
[2:20:02] the works that I do, ye shall do also.
[2:20:05] Why? Because when you preach, those that
[2:20:07] believe, that's the ones that the signs
[2:20:09] and wonders are going to come for. when
[2:20:11] you hear when they hear the gospel. Now
[2:20:14] they may not be saved but when you
[2:20:16] preach or when you your life is
[2:20:17] preaching when your when your life is
[2:20:20] preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:20:22] somebody can get healed. They may not
[2:20:24] get saved but they can get healing.
[2:20:26] There's benefits.
[2:20:29] We want them to be saved. But whatever
[2:20:32] benefit they can get out of it let your
[2:20:34] life bring it about. That's how you're
[2:20:37] going to fill this building by the life
[2:20:39] lived by every single one of you.
[2:20:48] And he says
[2:20:51] he wants to mold our character.
[2:20:56] The he says this, I love it. He says
[2:21:00] your character is molded by the life
[2:21:03] that's in you.
[2:21:09] Now that's contrary to what I've always
[2:21:11] learned. You know, you know, I taught
[2:21:14] you your character is no, you know,
[2:21:16] molded in, you know, I went to school. I
[2:21:19] grew I I, in fact, I don't know if I say
[2:21:21] this, but I was born in the Congo. Um,
[2:21:24] and then I left when I was about 17, 18.
[2:21:26] I went to South Africa, went to college
[2:21:28] there, and then my uh immigrated to
[2:21:30] America. So I remember, you know, when
[2:21:34] we went to a a primary school and they
[2:21:37] the teachers were really hard on that. I
[2:21:39] grew up in the time where you get a
[2:21:40] spanking in school, you know what I
[2:21:42] mean? And and so to me, that's how you
[2:21:44] were molding characters. You know, they
[2:21:46] say we're trying to make you a better
[2:21:47] person. But the prophet is saying your
[2:21:51] character is molded by the life that's
[2:21:54] in you. So the life of Christ in you
[2:21:58] molds the character of who you're
[2:22:00] supposed to be.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Well, I thought it was from outside in.
[2:22:05] No, it's from the inside out.
[2:22:13] He's here. The word of God is given to
[2:22:17] mold you by by the trials and the things
[2:22:21] that you go through. What is it? Is
[2:22:23] molding you. Now remember, we're going
[2:22:25] to a wedding supper and there's only one
[2:22:28] that knows what the requirements are for
[2:22:30] you to get there. And there's only one
[2:22:32] that knows in which shape do you need to
[2:22:34] be. And and his word when it comes forth
[2:22:37] the life that you are living in and the
[2:22:39] things that he's letting you go through,
[2:22:41] he's molding you so you can fit the
[2:22:43] characteristics of what existed. Because
[2:22:46] remember that person existed before this
[2:22:49] one comes. So this one has to be molded
[2:22:52] into the image of that. Remember it
[2:22:55] wasn't that uh that the robe that Elijah
[2:22:59] had had to be cut for the size that
[2:23:01] Elisha was. No, but it was that Elisha
[2:23:05] had to grow into the word that was
[2:23:08] already provided into the road that was
[2:23:11] already provided.
[2:23:15] I want to say this don't waste that
[2:23:16] opportunity. Barbanam talks about going
[2:23:19] to the wedding supper
[2:23:22] and and I don't want you to waste that
[2:23:25] opportunity. Barbanam says whatever you
[2:23:27] do don't miss it.
[2:23:29] Don't miss it. Don't don't let the
[2:23:32] busyiness of life the cares and the
[2:23:34] family and the things that sure we have
[2:23:37] to work. Sure we have to feed our
[2:23:39] family. Sure we have to do all of that.
[2:23:41] But don't let those things of the cares
[2:23:45] of life choke the life of Christ. No,
[2:23:48] make time for the life of Christ. Do
[2:23:51] feed the life of Christ. When you feed
[2:23:54] that life, that life will provide for
[2:23:56] both spiritual and even natural.
[2:24:00] Don't live by the provision of the
[2:24:02] devil. Live by the provision of God.
[2:24:09] Let him be the light for you. Let him be
[2:24:12] your guiding principle. Let him every
[2:24:14] decision that you made. But Baram says
[2:24:16] you always ask yourself, will Christ be
[2:24:19] okay with us? Will with will with will
[2:24:20] with will with will with will with will
[2:24:20] with will with will with will with will
[2:24:20] with will with will God be okay with us?
[2:24:22] Put him first. He says you seek first
[2:24:24] the kingdom of God and the rest will be
[2:24:27] given unto you. If that is a prophecy
[2:24:30] for everyone that puts the word first.
[2:24:32] If you put the word first, it doesn't
[2:24:34] come to pass, then God is a liar. But we
[2:24:36] know the scripture says that God is not
[2:24:38] a liar and he's not a son of man that he
[2:24:41] will change his mind. When he's already
[2:24:43] spoken, it will come to pass.
[2:24:46] He wants us to do that.
[2:24:49] I was thinking about even uh mentioned
[2:24:52] this, you know, talks about the the the
[2:24:55] wedding invitation that the scriptures
[2:24:57] in Luke 24.
[2:25:00] Now when you read it, the scripture says
[2:25:02] that when the servant went
[2:25:07] and I just want to set up the scene. I'm
[2:25:08] coming to a close and I really want you
[2:25:10] to pay attention for just a moment so I
[2:25:12] can finish it.
[2:25:16] He the these people had already received
[2:25:19] the invitation
[2:25:22] that there was a wedding and there was
[2:25:25] an event happening.
[2:25:27] says that the bride today has the
[2:25:30] material on earth to get ready.
[2:25:33] In other words, you already heard that
[2:25:36] there's a wedding supper coming.
[2:25:39] It's known. So were these people. But
[2:25:42] the scripture will go that when the
[2:25:44] servant showed up that those they begin
[2:25:47] to make excuses one to another. The
[2:25:50] scripture says that one said that he was
[2:25:53] going to get married. The other said he
[2:25:55] bought a mul of land and the other said
[2:25:58] that uh um uh that that he he he had
[2:26:02] bought five oxen that he couldn't come
[2:26:05] and everything. And I want you to hear
[2:26:07] what the prophet said in the message is
[2:26:10] your life worthy of the gospel. It says
[2:26:12] Jesus here is saying man has always
[2:26:16] tried to make excuses to not receive
[2:26:19] God's word of
[2:26:21] his invitation.
[2:26:25] and and and I want you to apply it to
[2:26:28] your own life
[2:26:30] and what you think is the reason why you
[2:26:34] cannot be the things that we just talked
[2:26:36] about yesterday and today.
[2:26:40] Some will say it's too high.
[2:26:43] Some will say it's too great that I can
[2:26:46] measure to it. whatever it is. And in in
[2:26:49] some cases, it's it's going in both
[2:26:53] directions.
[2:26:54] It's either some that are so
[2:26:56] overconfident that they have it that
[2:26:59] they don't even got it and some that
[2:27:02] they always belittle themselves at all
[2:27:04] times that they cannot attain to it.
[2:27:08] He's saying that this is men's kind
[2:27:13] always
[2:27:15] trying to make excuses for not receiving
[2:27:18] the God's word of invitation. He says,
[2:27:20] "Though it be firmly proven to them
[2:27:25] that his supper and his invitation, but
[2:27:28] man is constantly making excuses."
[2:27:32] And if you say you read St. Matthew 22,
[2:27:35] you will find out that
[2:27:37] the excuse were made also. And he's
[2:27:40] taking this the parable of the this two
[2:27:43] parable and he's putting it together.
[2:27:45] And it says another place it says, "So
[2:27:48] we see that when God gives a man an
[2:27:50] invitation to do something or to receive
[2:27:53] the invitation,
[2:27:55] he's giving him
[2:27:57] that is given him and he returns. He
[2:28:00] turns it down and there is nothing left
[2:28:03] after mercy is burned
[2:28:08] but judgment.
[2:28:09] If you step over the boundaries of
[2:28:12] mercy, then there's only one thing left
[2:28:15] and that's and that says that that's his
[2:28:18] judgment. And we found out that man has
[2:28:20] done that in all the ages. It happens
[2:28:25] most every age in the Bible.
[2:28:29] Now
[2:28:31] you can we could sit here and say well
[2:28:35] one got married,
[2:28:38] one bought an accent, one box bought a a
[2:28:41] piece of land and everything and who do
[2:28:44] you actually think had the better excuse
[2:28:47] to not be there?
[2:28:51] Right? You could say, "Well, I mean one
[2:28:53] got married. You got to give him a
[2:28:55] break." You know what I mean?
[2:28:58] Now I I I'm trying to show you how human
[2:29:01] mind works. We we weigh everything by
[2:29:05] our own
[2:29:07] level, right? Like well, you know, if
[2:29:10] this happened, then this is acceptable
[2:29:13] and but then the question is
[2:29:18] how do you pick one excuse over the
[2:29:20] other? Because when all is said and
[2:29:22] done, they all missed the benefit of
[2:29:26] what was provided.
[2:29:32] Whether the excuse
[2:29:34] fit the best or didn't fit the best,
[2:29:40] whether you felt like you were capable
[2:29:42] or incapable, whether it was your
[2:29:45] arrogance or it was your complexes.
[2:29:48] when it when it's all said and done,
[2:29:51] they missed the invitation.
[2:29:58] And some said, "I'm unworthy." But now
[2:30:01] look at what it does. Because they
[2:30:03] refused the invitation. He goes in the
[2:30:05] highways and the byways and everything.
[2:30:07] Now that and he calls all that were
[2:30:10] there. Remember now the invitation had
[2:30:14] everything that they needed to be ready.
[2:30:17] All the the master was looking for was
[2:30:20] just bodies to show up because when he
[2:30:23] called the people from the street, they
[2:30:25] didn't show up all cleaned up and
[2:30:27] dressed up. The invitation included the
[2:30:30] dressing.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; The invitation included the robe. The
[2:30:35] invitation included everything for you
[2:30:37] to make it.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; God's word has all the vitamins that you
[2:30:42] need. If you are not worthy, if you are
[2:30:45] unclean, if you've done this, whatever,
[2:30:47] the invitation has to has the power for
[2:30:50] you to sit on the table.
[2:30:53] Otherwise, it's not an invitation. You
[2:30:56] can't say, "Well, I want you to come to
[2:30:57] the party." It's not like, you know, not
[2:31:00] it's bad. You know, it's not a party
[2:31:02] where you say, "Oh, I want you to come,
[2:31:03] but I want you I want you to bring
[2:31:05] salad. I want you to come, but I want
[2:31:06] you to bring dessert. I want you to come
[2:31:08] back. No, this is a seven course meal
[2:31:10] prepared and everything is included. All
[2:31:14] he wants is you and your acknowledgement
[2:31:17] and your acceptance to the invitation.
[2:31:20] The moment you say I here I am. I'll
[2:31:23] come. He says okay from that moment on
[2:31:26] the responsibility is mine that you are
[2:31:29] seated at that table.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful thing. Now let me tell
[2:31:36] you in closing if the musician could
[2:31:38] come I'll tell you what the invitation
[2:31:40] include
[2:32:04] The invitation says,
[2:32:08] "The bride
[2:32:10] is the final voice to the final light."
[2:32:18] You're like,
[2:32:20] "That's pretty tall." Yeah, I know.
[2:32:26] I know. He's looking for badger skins.
[2:32:30] He's looking for a veil for him to hide
[2:32:33] himself behind. But says, "We in this
[2:32:37] generation,
[2:32:38] we have the devil's answer."
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; The devil answer. Oh yeah. There is no
[2:32:47] tactics. There's no lies. There's no
[2:32:51] He's been exposed at every level. Now,
[2:32:54] how is he going to bring you to the
[2:32:56] supper unless he shows you what the way
[2:32:59] is and every trap that the enemy has
[2:33:02] laid to you? Now, he's because remember
[2:33:05] in the process of overcoming, you have
[2:33:07] to have somebody who knows the way,
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; right? You have to have somebody. So,
[2:33:12] what he does, he goes to Calvary, he
[2:33:14] overcomes and he comes, he says, "Now I
[2:33:17] have overcome." Now, what he does is he
[2:33:19] says, "Okay, come put your arm across
[2:33:22] from me. I want you to walk side by
[2:33:24] side. I will now show you the way. Now,
[2:33:26] every footstep that he's making, he
[2:33:29] knows exactly where he's stepping at.
[2:33:31] Why? Because he's already overcame that.
[2:33:34] So, your your calling in your life, the
[2:33:37] only thing God is asking you is to
[2:33:39] accept and to walk with him the march of
[2:33:42] an overcomer.
[2:33:46] He says,
[2:33:48] "The bride is the continuation of the
[2:33:51] book of Acts."
[2:33:54] The invitation, "The works that I do, ye
[2:33:58] shall do." Also, he says, "The bride is
[2:34:01] a written epistle read of all men." The
[2:34:03] bride is the manifestation of the word
[2:34:06] of God in the age that we are living in.
[2:34:12] That's the key in the age that we are.
[2:34:15] There's so many people that try to
[2:34:16] interpret this Bible, but we have
[2:34:18] received, but says in this end time, we
[2:34:21] have received by God's grace a divine
[2:34:24] interpretation of the entire Bible. No,
[2:34:28] no, the interpretation is not the
[2:34:30] explanation. The interpretation is
[2:34:32] actually showing you what God has been
[2:34:35] doing.
[2:34:37] And but says God interprets his word by
[2:34:40] bringing it to pass. So God is here
[2:34:43] showing us every step of the way what he
[2:34:46] meant is in in his own word.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; We're not making these things up. This
[2:34:51] is him walking with you.
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; He says the bride, he says she is him.
[2:35:00] Now this will take eternity, I believe,
[2:35:02] in my opinion for us to ever grasp these
[2:35:05] things.
[2:35:06] because he will continually unveil it
[2:35:09] and unveil it and unveil it and talk to
[2:35:12] us, talk to us until we get it. She is
[2:35:15] Christ in the bride form.
[2:35:20] It's the same anointing.
[2:35:22] I I said just a moment ago, if the
[2:35:24] spirit of Picasso was upon me, Barnam
[2:35:26] says you will draw paintings. If the
[2:35:29] spirit of Michelangelo was upon me, what
[2:35:31] I'll do? I'll do sculptural. I'll do
[2:35:32] whatever all of that. If the spirit
[2:35:34] Christ is in you, what is it? You'll do
[2:35:36] the works of Christ.
[2:35:39] He says she's the gene of God.
[2:35:44] That's your identification. So what God
[2:35:48] is, you are.
[2:35:50] What God is, you are. You can actually
[2:35:53] look at yourself in the mirror and said,
[2:35:55] "I am God."
[2:35:58] They said, "You say you are God." He
[2:36:01] said, "Well, don't you call them to them
[2:36:03] the word of God comes to? Don't you call
[2:36:05] them God? Why are you offended when I
[2:36:07] say I'm God?" He came to that place when
[2:36:10] they were lowering the men under. He
[2:36:12] looked at them, he says, "Oh, thy sin be
[2:36:15] forgiven thee." They were resentful.
[2:36:17] They said, "How can you say, who is he
[2:36:19] that he thinks that he can forgive sin?"
[2:36:21] He looked at them, he says, "Okay, which
[2:36:22] one is easy to say, thy sin be forgiven
[2:36:25] thee or take up thy bed and walk?"
[2:36:28] Because he can do both.
[2:36:32] We get caught up in the limitation of
[2:36:34] the flesh and therefore we try to limit
[2:36:37] God to our own flesh. God is bigger than
[2:36:40] our flesh and the only way we can know
[2:36:43] him is by the revealing of his own word.
[2:36:45] And I ask you this morning, don't take
[2:36:48] God and measure him by your mind.
[2:36:50] Measure him by the greatness of his word
[2:36:52] and the revelation he's given us. Then
[2:36:55] only you can live the life above what
[2:36:57] the flesh can offer.
[2:37:01] He says she has never done it in the
[2:37:04] first place. It says she's the gene
[2:37:08] bride of God in say in fact brother
[2:37:11] Vanam says she is his victory.
[2:37:15] We are the victory of Christ.
[2:37:19] He didn't want that life that was in him
[2:37:22] to remain in him. And the scripture says
[2:37:25] unless the seed goes into the ground it
[2:37:27] remains alone. But if it does, it will
[2:37:30] bring forth much more. And we are the
[2:37:33] much more that's been made on known. And
[2:37:35] we are here to continue, not to do new,
[2:37:39] but to continue the works of Christ.
[2:37:41] Why? Because the works that he did, we
[2:37:44] shall do also. But I said, not by our
[2:37:46] power, not by our might, but by the
[2:37:49] spirit of God dwelling in us. God bless
[2:37:52] you. Let's all stand.
[2:38:07] I just want to say this.
[2:38:10] I know I said much, but
[2:38:13] don't think this is one something that's
[2:38:15] going to happen in one day. This is the
[2:38:18] journey of your life.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; It's the journey of your discovery. What
[2:38:23] I try to do this morning is to paint you
[2:38:25] the map and the picture of what we are
[2:38:28] walking into.
[2:38:31] You may make a step forward and tomorrow
[2:38:33] you feel like you make a step for
[2:38:35] backwards. Don't let that discourage
[2:38:37] you. I want you to continue in the
[2:38:39] journey. Know that he's still doing the
[2:38:41] chiseling. He's still removing the
[2:38:44] pieces that are untowards because he the
[2:38:47] last thing that he has to do is to
[2:38:50] separate you. It says the scripture says
[2:38:53] in that day what he will do he will
[2:38:55] separate the sheep from the goat. He
[2:38:58] does the separation and the only way he
[2:39:00] does the separation is by taking you and
[2:39:03] removing everything that's not of him.
[2:39:08] It's like gold said it will take it. The
[2:39:11] gold will be beaten until the beer
[2:39:14] himself can see his own reflection.
[2:39:18] And the only way we can become gold is
[2:39:20] to lay in the presence of the one that's
[2:39:23] doing the beating. So all the impurity
[2:39:26] could be taken out. Brother, my sister,
[2:39:28] when the impurity is taken out, it will
[2:39:31] be glorious. And I love that he said, as
[2:39:33] Paul said, the suffering of this life
[2:39:36] will not even be close to the glory that
[2:39:40] awaits us. We're in Christ Jesus. Our
[2:39:43] gracious father, we thank you this
[2:39:45] morning. Father, I just poured my heart
[2:39:48] to this people. And father, my heart
[2:39:50] desire is that your word may be made on
[2:39:53] known unto us. And father, the only way
[2:39:56] we know how to is how your prophet
[2:39:58] taught us that faith comes from the
[2:40:00] hearing and the hearing of the word.
[2:40:03] Father, you said that we have to hear it
[2:40:05] first and to believe it and then it will
[2:40:07] drop into our hearts and then it will
[2:40:10] cause the whole body to obey the word.
[2:40:12] But say that it's the positive
[2:40:14] confession. He says if we have negative
[2:40:17] confession will bring it to come to
[2:40:19] pass. But if we confess the word every
[2:40:21] day, he says that you are the high
[2:40:24] priest of our confession. That you will
[2:40:26] take that confession and run it up to
[2:40:28] the father and make it happen. This
[2:40:31] morning we confess your word. What you
[2:40:33] say is what we say. What you say is what
[2:40:36] we believe. We don't want to be anything
[2:40:38] outside of what you claim us to be. We
[2:40:41] don't want to be anything outside of
[2:40:43] what you called us to be. When all is
[2:40:45] said and done, Lord, we want to be the
[2:40:47] living image of the living God
[2:40:49] manifested to this generation. I'm so
[2:40:52] thankful for these people. Lord, I
[2:40:53] commit them into your hands. And Brother
[2:40:55] Jonathan and Sister Blanca and the
[2:40:57] family down here, Lord, I pray that you
[2:40:59] keep them into your hands, Lord. Father,
[2:41:01] I know they have both individual and uh
[2:41:05] challenges as from the young to the old
[2:41:07] and and church challenges and all of
[2:41:09] that. But in all of that, we know that
[2:41:11] our father suppliers all our needs,
[2:41:13] Lord. That you be the supplier. You lead
[2:41:16] them. You grow them. Father, that this
[2:41:18] place even as the name that it may
[2:41:20] become a lighthouse to the generation
[2:41:22] and to the people living in this place
[2:41:24] that they may come to know that there's
[2:41:26] a living God among them that's
[2:41:28] manifested himself in the people. I
[2:41:30] commit them to you. I thank you for
[2:41:32] them. I ask that you be with them until
[2:41:34] we meet again. We love you and we say
[2:41:36] thank you, Father, for all things. In
[2:41:38] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[2:41:40] pray. Amen.
[2:41:43] Amen.
[2:41:44] You sing that song, I lift your name.
[2:41:47] Amen.
[2:41:49] What key I sing it in a
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:41:56] What do you sing it in?
[2:42:01] B flat. Lord, my heart can grow
[2:42:09] so [music] far away.
[2:42:13] Hallelujah.
[2:42:15] Oh, and yet for me [music]
[2:42:18] your love is the
[2:42:25] [music]
[2:42:28] Oh
[2:42:31] [music] my. Hallelujah.
[2:42:36] [music]
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, and my head down
[2:42:46] [music]
[2:42:47] to your
[2:42:49] name.
[2:42:53] Oh, I
[2:42:56] am
[2:42:57] your
[2:42:59] name.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; Your [music] holy
[2:43:05] name,
[2:43:08] the holy [music]
[2:43:12] God.
[2:43:16] [music]
[2:43:20] Hosana
[2:43:22] [music] greatest
[2:43:28] the [music]
[2:43:35] [music]
[2:43:43] [music]
[2:43:45] Lord my heart desire. I
[2:43:50] is to [music] be filled with spirit and
[2:43:55] fire.
[2:43:58] My purpose is to [music] worship you
[2:44:04] alone.
[2:44:07] [music]
[2:44:10] So open [singing]
[2:44:12] up my soul
[2:44:17] to worship [music]
[2:44:19] and adore
[2:44:24] to [music] be a fragrance
[2:44:28] offered to [music] your throne.
[2:44:35] I lift [music]
[2:44:39] your
[2:44:40] name.
[2:44:43] Your [music]
[2:44:44] holy
[2:44:47] name.
[2:44:49] Jehovah [singing]
[2:44:53] God. [music]
[2:44:55] Tell
[2:44:57] him
[2:45:01] the [singing]
[2:45:02] great [music]
[2:45:05] I am
[2:45:08] the [music] risen
[2:45:12] lamb.
[2:45:15] My [music and singing] comfort
[2:45:20] and [music and singing] king.
[2:45:24] I lift
[2:45:27] your
[2:45:28] name. [music]
[2:45:31] Your holy
[2:45:34] name.
[2:45:37] Jehovah
[2:45:39] [music]
[2:45:41] God.
[2:45:43] Tell all [singing] him
[2:45:46] [music]
[2:45:49] the
[2:45:51] great
[2:45:52] I [singing] am
[2:45:56] [music] the risen
[2:46:00] lamb.
[2:46:03] my [music]
[2:46:03] comforter
[2:46:08] and king. [music]
[2:46:13] Amen. What a beautiful word we've heard
[2:46:15] this weekend. Amen. Amen. I've certainly
[2:46:18] enjoyed it. Brother Billy's going to get
[2:46:20] changed so he can head to the airport
[2:46:21] shortly. We'll sing one more song
[2:46:24] perhaps before we close. I want to sing
[2:46:26] that song. Let your word be born in the
[2:46:28] manger of my heart. Amen. And then we'll
[2:46:31] uh we'll let you go. Remember, we've got
[2:46:32] a fellowship. We've got food waiting for
[2:46:34] us. So, please stick around if you can.
[2:46:36] Enjoy that fellowship with each other.
[2:46:39] I'm trying to get us out quickly enough
[2:46:40] so you can shake Brother Billy's hand as
[2:46:42] well and uh show your appreciation.
[2:46:44] Amen. Thank him for his efforts and for
[2:46:47] for sacrificing the way that he has.
[2:46:50] Amen. But let's sing this song. Amen.
[2:46:52] Let your word be born in my heart. Lord,
[2:46:55] produce what you said you were going to
[2:46:56] produce. Let me surrender enough that I
[2:46:59] could get out of the way so you can do
[2:47:02] what I want you to do. Amen.
[2:47:04] It's in my jacket. Um, amen. Let's sing
[2:47:08] this before we close. Brother Grant, I'm
[2:47:11] going to ask you to pray, but I'm going
[2:47:12] to ask you to pray a little shorter than
[2:47:14] you normally do, just so we have time to
[2:47:16] say goodbye to Brother Billy if that's
[2:47:17] okay, brother. Amen. Let's [music] sing
[2:47:19] this. It was a tiny [singing] simple
[2:47:23] stable
[2:47:25] all beaten [music]
[2:47:27] and [singing] worn.
[2:47:30] Oh, heartly
[2:47:32] a place
[2:47:34] for a king [music and singing] to be
[2:47:36] born.
[2:47:38] He didn't choose something [singing]
[2:47:41] special
[2:47:42] to reveal his majesty. [music]
[2:47:47] So I know if I give him control,
[2:47:52] he'll be born [singing] in me.
[2:47:55] [music] Let your [singing]
[2:47:58] word
[2:48:00] be born
[2:48:02] in the manger [music and singing]
[2:48:03] of my heart.
[2:48:07] Let it live [music] in me. Let it start.
[2:48:15] Live inside [singing]
[2:48:16] this [music]
[2:48:16] house of clay
[2:48:19] and mold it every day.
[2:48:24] Let your [music] word be born
[2:48:27] in the manger
[2:48:30] of my heart. [music]
[2:48:36] Well, outwardly I'm nothing.
[2:48:40] Not much to behold,
[2:48:45] unlikely
[2:48:46] a [singing] place
[2:48:48] for his word to unfold.
[2:48:53] But if [music] I just yield this vessel
[2:48:57] and I let him have his way
[2:49:01] from [singing] glory on to glory,
[2:49:06] he'll change me day by day. [music]
[2:49:10] Let your word
[2:49:14] be born [singing]
[2:49:16] in the manger [music] of my heart.
[2:49:21] Let it live in me. Let
[2:49:25] [music and singing] it start.
[2:49:29] Live inside this [music] house of clay
[2:49:34] and [singing] mold it every day.
[2:49:38] Let your word be born [music]
[2:49:42] in the manger
[2:49:45] of my heart.
[2:49:48] [music]
[2:49:50] Oh, outwardly I'm nothing,
[2:49:55] not much to [singing] behold,
[2:49:59] unlikely
[2:50:01] [music] a place
[2:50:03] for his word to unfold.
[2:50:07] But if I just yield this vessel
[2:50:11] and I let him have his way
[2:50:16] from glory [singing]
[2:50:17] on to glory, [music]
[2:50:20] he'll change me day [singing] by day.
[2:50:24] Let your word [music] be born [singing]
[2:50:30] in the manger of my heart.
[2:50:35] Let it live in me. [music]
[2:50:38] Let it start.
[2:50:41] [singing]
[2:50:43] Live inside [music] this house of clay
[2:50:47] and mold [singing] it every day.
[2:50:52] Let [music] your word be [singing] born
[2:50:56] in the manger
[2:50:58] of my heart.
[2:51:02] And let [music]
[2:51:03] your word
[2:51:06] be born
[2:51:08] in the manger [singing and music]
[2:51:09] of my heart.
[2:51:13] Oh, let it live in me. Let it [music]
[2:51:17] start.
[2:51:20] Live inside this [music and singing]
[2:51:22] house of clay
[2:51:25] and hold it every day.
[2:51:30] that your word be [music] born
[2:51:33] in the manger
[2:51:36] of my heart.
[2:51:43] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts to him.
[2:51:47] Lord, we thank you for this morning. We
[2:51:49] thank you for our precious brother, Lord
[2:51:52] God, as he unveil his life, Lord. And
[2:51:55] Lord, you speak to him through our
[2:51:57] hearts, Lord God.
[2:51:59] Lord God, we ask even this morning,
[2:52:01] Lord, that the words that were said,
[2:52:03] Lord God, that will it will bring that
[2:52:06] Lord God, that experience, Lord God,
[2:52:09] where your life can be made expressed
[2:52:11] through us, Lord, Lord God, in this dark
[2:52:14] hour, Lord. And so we surrender oursel
[2:52:16] to you one more time, oh God, that
[2:52:18] you'll have the preeminence, Lord God,
[2:52:20] and that our lives will be a blessing to
[2:52:22] someone. Bless them, Lord God. Bless
[2:52:24] your people, Lord God. And Lord God,
[2:52:27] remember Lord God, all that we have need
[2:52:29] of, Lord God, we know God, it's a time
[2:52:31] of your expression. And Lord God, we ask
[2:52:33] for life, Lord God, this haze of life,
[2:52:36] bless us now. We pray, have thy own way,
[2:52:39] Lord. God, as we go to fellowship, Lord,
[2:52:41] bless each and everyone, we pray in
[2:52:43] Jesus Christ's name we say. Amen. Amen.
[2:52:55] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:53:02] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:53:12] hey.
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:53:41] [music]
[2:53:59] &gt;&gt; Hey.

[2:54:29] [music]
[2:54:30] glory,
[2:54:36] [music]
[2:54:38] glory,
[2:54:41] glory.
[2:54:42] You
[2:54:46] won't [music]
[2:54:48] be
[2:54:50] my
[2:55:04] [music]
[2:55:05] glory.
[2:55:10] Oh my [music] god.
