[36:42] and we want to say this evening We
[36:43] Appreciate You Lord we love you Lord
[36:46] we're so glad that we can call you our
[36:49] father Lord that you've given us a
[36:50] revelation of where we come from Lord
[36:53] and with that Revelation comes the
[36:55] knowledge of where we're going Lord I
[36:57] pray You' just speak again tonight Lord
[36:59] that you would Minister to us Lord raise
[37:01] our sights a little higher raise our
[37:03] lives a little higher raise our faith a
[37:05] little higher Lord draw us into the

[37:13] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[37:16] God bless you turn if you would to Acts
[37:17] chapter 2 Acts chapter
[37:20] 2 good to see each one here good to have
[37:23] Selena back with us as well after a long
[37:26] and eventful and
[37:28] not on time trip but trust God's in it
[37:31] always amen like we said before all
[37:34] things work together in isolation they
[37:37] may not seem like much but God's always
[37:39] got a purpose and a plan for these
[37:41] things amen Acts chapter 2 verse1 very
[37:44] familiar scripture says and when the day
[37:47] of Pentecost was fully come and they
[37:49] were all with one Accord in one place
[37:51] and suddenly there came a sound from
[37:53] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[37:55] it filled all the house where they were
[37:57] sitting and there appeared unto them
[37:59] clothing tongues like as of fire and it
[38:01] sat upon each of them and they were all
[38:04] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[38:06] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[38:09] gave them
[38:10] utterance amen God bless you you can
[38:12] have your seats this evening we're going
[38:14] W right back to our series on the Holy
[38:16] Ghost on the token life and the the last
[38:18] service we took on this we preached on
[38:20] how do I receive the Holy Ghost then I
[38:23] want to go to the next obvious question
[38:25] and that's how do I know I have received
[38:27] received the Holy Ghost amen this is the
[38:29] biggest question you need to answer in
[38:32] your life today we want certainty in
[38:33] this world everybody's looking for
[38:35] certainty everyone if they they're going
[38:37] to invest money they want it to be
[38:38] certain they're going to get a return on
[38:40] it if they're going to take a job they
[38:41] want certainty it's going to work out if
[38:43] they get married they want a certainty
[38:44] that their spouse is going to stay with
[38:46] them and things are going to go well but
[38:48] I'll tell you one thing we need
[38:49] certainty in our walk with God we need
[38:50] to know that our Eternal destination is
[38:53] secure and it's the right one amen some
[38:55] people have an eternal destination and
[38:57] it's it's the wrong one but I don't want
[38:58] to come down to the end of this age and
[39:00] then find out I didn't have the Holy
[39:02] Ghost amen I don't want to be standing
[39:05] in front of the white Throne judgment I
[39:07] don't want to see this world tumbling
[39:08] into tribulation and realize oh my
[39:10] goodness I missed it I want to make
[39:12] certain today I want to make certain now
[39:14] I want to make certain tonight before I
[39:16] leave this building that I know where
[39:18] I'm standing that I've made my calling
[39:20] and my election sure amen as children of
[39:23] God that be that ought to be the one
[39:25] thing that settled is that my soul has
[39:27] been sealed with the Holy Ghost and if
[39:29] it hasn't how do I get it Lord don't let
[39:32] me leave here tonight without it amen
[39:34] because there's going to come a time and
[39:36] it's not going to be the tribulation
[39:38] I'll tell you this Satan is trying to
[39:40] knock us off the Revelation that we are
[39:42] children of God and as things come up in
[39:44] life we need a certainty to know that I
[39:46] am a child of God when sickness comes
[39:49] when hard times comes when struggles
[39:51] come when we don't know what's going on
[39:53] that's not the time to figure out you're
[39:54] a child of God you want to come into
[39:56] that knowing your a child of God so that
[39:58] Satan can't knock you off of it
[40:00] otherwise what happens is we get into
[40:01] the trial and we're weak upfront and he
[40:04] can do just about anything with us but
[40:06] before we go so far on this question
[40:08] really we're not going to know we're not
[40:09] going to answer this question today
[40:11] because first we have to answer another
[40:12] question and I open with Acts 2 and we
[40:15] read that verse four it said they were
[40:16] all filled with the Holy Ghost and began
[40:18] to speak with other tongues as the
[40:19] spirit gave them utterance and to most
[40:21] people that is the answer how do I know
[40:23] I've received the Holy Spirit I've
[40:24] spoken in tongues but the thing is what
[40:27] they they haven't realized is that the
[40:29] Holy Ghost was given for a
[40:31] reason and we have to go back and ask
[40:33] ourselves what was the Holy Ghost given
[40:35] for and if we know what it was given for
[40:38] then that will tell us what the evidence
[40:40] is if I if I go to the store and they
[40:43] tell me that this tool will do a certain
[40:45] thing and I go home and it won't do a
[40:46] certain thing then guess what the
[40:48] purpose that they've told me of that
[40:49] tool is wrong or I'm using it the wrong
[40:51] way so if God has given us something and
[40:53] he says this is the purpose of it then
[40:55] the evidence for him giving it it and US
[40:58] receiving it will be that it does what
[40:59] it's purposed to
[41:01] do and so if we take it back to the
[41:03] scripture we'll find out why the Holy
[41:05] Spirit was set in the first place you go
[41:07] to a a Baptist Church and they'll tell
[41:09] you that that the evidence of receiving
[41:11] the holy spirit is that you believed on
[41:12] Jesus Christ you go to a Pentecostal
[41:15] church and they'll tell you that because
[41:16] you've spoken in tongues then you've
[41:18] received the Holy Ghost you'll go to
[41:19] certain message churches and they'll
[41:21] tell you if you believe this Doctrine or
[41:22] that Doctrine you've clearly received
[41:24] the Holy Spirit because only a child of
[41:26] God can receive that but we want to hear
[41:28] what the word has to say listen
[41:30] denominations change Ministries change
[41:32] churches change opinions change
[41:34] doctrines change but the word is the
[41:36] only thing that stands alone and
[41:37] unchanging so we've got to take our
[41:39] answer back to the word and so if we go
[41:42] back to the promise of the coming of the
[41:44] spirit of God in our lives we've read
[41:45] this many times but for sake of
[41:47] completeness we'll read it again tonight
[41:49] in Ezekiel 36 he says for I will take
[41:51] you this is God speaking for I will take
[41:54] you from among the Heathen and gather
[41:56] you out of all countries and will bring
[41:58] you into your own land then will I
[42:00] sprinkle clean water upon you and ye
[42:03] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[42:06] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[42:07] you and a new heart also will I give
[42:10] unto you and a new spirit will I put
[42:12] within you and I will take away the
[42:15] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[42:17] give you an heart of Flesh so if we look
[42:19] up to verse 26 what do we see if we're
[42:22] looking at this person's life we see the
[42:24] first two works of Grace we see
[42:26] justification
[42:28] justification it's going to be one of
[42:30] those nights justification what is it
[42:33] you didn't do it in the first place your
[42:35] sins are covered amen they're separated
[42:38] from you there's that's one divorce we
[42:40] believe in is my sin from my person when
[42:42] Christ died at Calvary if I put my sins
[42:45] and I leave them under the blood then
[42:47] they're divorced for me and they can't
[42:48] be attributed to me amen and then we see
[42:51] after that he says I'm going to clean
[42:52] you up we see a Sanctified life so this
[42:55] is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[42:58] but it is a work of the Holy Spirit
[43:01] God's working on you God's doing
[43:03] something in your life notice through
[43:04] all these scriptures he keeps saying I
[43:06] will I will I will I will it's all his
[43:10] work it's not what I'm doing it's what
[43:13] he's doing in my life it's what the
[43:14] spirit of God is doing but this is not
[43:16] the baptism or the infilling or the
[43:18] sealing of the holy spirit it's merely
[43:20] the work of the Holy Spirit and what
[43:22] it's doing is it's preparing us for 27
[43:25] verse 27 which is the holy spirit
[43:29] himself see he's preparing you for
[43:31] himself and that means it's got to meet
[43:34] his standard not my standard and when he
[43:37] says we're ready that's when he'll come
[43:39] in so that's what he's trying to do so I
[43:42] can't sit here today and say I don't
[43:44] drink I don't smoke I don't fornicate I
[43:46] don't go out to bars and therefore I
[43:49] have the Holy Spirit no I can say the
[43:51] holy spirit's done a work in my life and
[43:53] I believe you can say that today as well
[43:55] but that doesn't mean I've received the
[43:56] Holy SP Spirit it might mean it but it
[43:59] doesn't definitely mean it but then we
[44:02] come to verse 27 and he says God says I
[44:05] will put my spirit within you that's the
[44:09] baptism of the Holy Spirit and then what
[44:12] happens when the Holy Spirit comes in it
[44:15] will cause you to walk in my statutes
[44:18] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[44:21] them notice what happens Hallelujah this
[44:23] is so beautiful he does the final work
[44:27] and then we finally start doing
[44:30] something we can do nothing to please
[44:32] him we can do nothing to satisfy him but
[44:35] as soon as his work's done in 27 now we
[44:39] come out and we start to do something we
[44:41] start to live by his statutes we start
[44:43] to keep his judgments what's that that's
[44:46] the word of God once he's finished his
[44:49] work we line up with the word of God and
[44:51] our life starts to match what his word
[44:53] tells us to do that's what the work of
[44:56] the holy spirit is amen the purpose of
[44:58] the holy spirit is not just so we can
[44:59] hear it with our ears and speak it with
[45:01] our mouth but it's so that we can live
[45:03] it out through our life amen it's
[45:05] bringing us and the word into Unity it's
[45:08] making us one and the same thing that's
[45:10] why the Holy Spirit was given its
[45:12] purpose is not to make us speaked in
[45:14] speak in tongues we'll talk about that
[45:16] later not this service its purpose is
[45:18] not to give us visions and dreams its
[45:20] purpose is not to give us signs and
[45:22] wonders those are all just effects and
[45:25] blessings you can go through your life
[45:27] and not see a single one of those things
[45:28] and still have the Holy Spirit because
[45:30] the proof is that it's done something to
[45:32] you amen but his purpose is to get us in
[45:36] unity with the word of God to make God's
[45:38] thoughts my thoughts to make God's words
[45:41] my words God's responses my responses
[45:44] God's actions my actions God's life my
[45:46] life that's the purpose of the spirit
[45:49] it's to get me out of the way to get me
[45:51] good and dead so that God can come in
[45:53] and rest control from my dead hands and
[45:55] start driving my life to take over the
[45:58] steering wheel but why is God even
[46:00] talking about this why is God going
[46:02] through such detail to say I'm going to
[46:04] get you to live by my word because
[46:06] that's what Israel could never do they
[46:08] could never live by the word time and
[46:10] time again they come back to God and
[46:12] they fall away they come back to God and
[46:15] they fall away and so we see here God
[46:17] saying the remedy you need if you keep
[46:19] trying and never making it is to get my
[46:21] spirit the new birth is what will
[46:24] resolve the trying and the failing cuz
[46:26] it'll be his work then instead of my
[46:28] work I can stop trying and start let him
[46:31] do I can surrender myself to him and he
[46:35] can start to do something listen if we
[46:37] look at Israel a prophet won't change us
[46:40] signs and wonders won't change us the
[46:42] pillar of fire in our midst won't change
[46:44] us it takes the pillar of fire inside of
[46:46] us to change us that's the only thing
[46:48] that's going to work amen great
[46:50] victories won't change us great revivals
[46:52] won't change us great promises won't
[46:54] change us it takes the receiving of the
[46:56] promise of the spirit of God inside of
[46:59] us to change us I think that's one of
[47:00] the biggest frustrations for a
[47:02] professing Christian is when you can
[47:04] talk it but you can't walk it and as
[47:07] much as we try and tell other people
[47:09] we're living it in our heart of hearts
[47:11] we know we're not there yet and yet we
[47:13] want to be there's a sincere desire amen
[47:16] we do everything right we try everything
[47:18] right we go to church we're under the
[47:19] hearing of the word and there's nothing
[47:21] we can point to in our lives that tells
[47:23] us that we're wrong but yet we know
[47:25] we're not completely in we're not where
[47:27] we ought to be we're not in the victory
[47:29] that we ought to be we're not overcoming
[47:31] we're not serving our our our surrender
[47:34] just isn't there and we're good for a
[47:36] while and then we fall away again and
[47:38] we're good for a while and we fall away
[47:40] again and it just beats us up it just
[47:43] beats us up you can't ever seem to win
[47:45] the battle once or for
[47:48] all but if you're there
[47:50] tonight and maybe some of us are tonight
[47:53] I'm not here to beat you up I'm not here
[47:55] to tear you down I'm here to say you've
[47:57] got a work of the Holy Spirit don't
[48:00] throw that away don't throw away the
[48:01] desire in your life for the things of
[48:03] God you're believing you're trying
[48:05] you're seeking God but don't stop short
[48:08] of The Full Experience amen don't stop
[48:10] until you come into a place of rest a
[48:12] place of assurance a place where you
[48:14] know the work is finished in your soul
[48:18] the work never stops until we get out of
[48:20] here but your soul is sealed all the way
[48:22] to Eternity to Eternity amen you've come
[48:24] to a place of overcoming power
[48:27] brother Brown would say this he says you
[48:29] find them people who seem to be very
[48:32] religious seem to have such a deep
[48:34] desire and daily they search and hunt
[48:37] and seek for God and never come to any
[48:40] settlement of any kind to where they
[48:42] could ever be settled or Anchored In
[48:44] Christ and this I have learned to be an
[48:47] experience he says that this is
[48:49] intellectual people now there are two
[48:51] different types of Christianity I'll say
[48:53] two different phases would be a better
[48:56] word to use not two types but two phases
[48:59] the same Christianity but two phases of
[49:01] it see he's not taken away from what you
[49:04] have we never want to do that that has
[49:07] broken so many Believers when they said
[49:09] they've been told you don't have the
[49:11] Holy
[49:12] Ghost with no encouragement but God's
[49:14] doing a work you're here because there's
[49:17] a desire you're here because there's a
[49:18] call God's doing something in your life
[49:20] brother Braham doesn't say that he says
[49:22] there's two phases to it if you're in
[49:24] the first part that's okay but make sure
[49:26] you get to the the second part he says
[49:28] now one of them is an intellectual or a
[49:30] mental conception of what God has said
[49:32] in his word and of Jesus Christ by the
[49:35] way of knowledge and the other is an
[49:38] experimental experience that God has
[49:41] given the man in his heart the one
[49:43] intellectually is hungry he's feasting
[49:46] on God but his Feast doesn't hold out
[49:49] the other one seems to have Victory all
[49:51] the time there's nothing that bothers
[49:53] them they're just as solid and anchored
[49:56] as they can be no trials no storms
[49:58] bother them at all but they seem to have
[50:01] something about them that people who are
[50:03] Christians and trying to live for God
[50:05] admire that type of Christian so if I
[50:09] could maybe rephrase it another way that
[50:12] is one Christian that's in and the other
[50:14] one is
[50:16] out because the holy spirit is really
[50:18] the dividing line of our Christian walk
[50:20] really it's everything leading up to the
[50:22] baptism of the Holy Spirit and then it's
[50:24] everything that's after that but once
[50:26] you get the Holy Spirit your whole life
[50:29] changes I know I've been there I've done
[50:32] that you think you've got it but when
[50:34] you get it you realize W it is different
[50:38] there is more to this
[50:40] amen so there's a difference in the
[50:42] thing is they're on the same walk
[50:43] brother BR says they're in two phases
[50:45] they're on the same walk but one has
[50:48] reached the point of no return and
[50:50] crossed over the other is still
[50:52] potentially going back and forth he's
[50:54] not saying they're not both children of
[50:56] God he's just saying one has come all
[50:58] the way into eternal life and the other
[51:00] one hasn't I'm not saying that one
[51:02] hasn't isn't going to get to eternal
[51:03] life they just haven't received it in
[51:05] the form of the Holy Spirit they're just
[51:07] at different places in their in their
[51:08] walk and now brother Brandon would go
[51:10] from here and and he would take a type
[51:13] and he would start talking about the
[51:14] Mana in the wilderness and he would take
[51:16] it then into the the into the Tabernacle
[51:18] the the meeting place that God had
[51:20] designed there and he would talk about
[51:22] in that Tabernacle you've got three
[51:24] sections and you have the outer Court
[51:26] which is where you can see here we've
[51:27] got the Altar and we've got the the the
[51:30] Basin for washing and then you have the
[51:32] whole the holy place which is just
[51:34] inside the building and then you have
[51:37] the holy of holies which is on the
[51:39] innermost part of the inside amen so you
[51:41] could take that Mana remember what that
[51:43] Mana was it was angel food it was God's
[51:46] provided Feast it was God's provided
[51:49] food amen but that Mana would only last
[51:53] today out in the regular World out even
[51:56] into the outer court that Mana would
[51:58] only last a day and really what we're
[52:00] seeing here is a type of the Flesh of
[52:02] the spirit and of the soul and you take
[52:05] what God provides you take the word of
[52:07] God you take the provision of God in
[52:09] your soul and you can go into the outer
[52:12] court and you can offer your
[52:15] sacrifice this body needs a lot of
[52:17] cleaning you can go in there and you can
[52:18] clean yourself up but it doesn't resolve
[52:22] anything you have to go in every single
[52:25] day to do it and in the outer Court
[52:27] you're subject to circumstances you're
[52:29] subject to weather you're in natural
[52:31] sunlight there the wind and the rain and
[52:33] darkness can come there and you can't do
[52:35] anything about it brother B would
[52:37] continue and he says this he says see
[52:39] your faith anchors you in Christ that's
[52:42] intellectual you believe it you accept
[52:44] it you say that it's right you recognize
[52:46] it to be the truth and you're a
[52:48] Christian you're on the campgrounds man
[52:50] is falling and you're eating it he says
[52:52] but did you notice a strange thing there
[52:54] was a mixed multitude eating the same
[52:56] man
[52:57] people who are sinners who do not accept
[52:59] the Lord Jesus can still enjoy seeing
[53:01] the moving of the miracle of God Healing
[53:04] The Sick can rejoice in people doing
[53:06] right can open their hearts and rejoice
[53:09] in a sermon that's preached under the
[53:12] anointing we've seen
[53:14] it we've seen it even in our very midst
[53:16] where people come in and they hear
[53:18] anointed preaching and they come out and
[53:20] they're Amazed by it and they don't know
[53:22] how to deal with it and they just can't
[53:24] understand how God could come into their
[53:26] lives and speak that way and then walk
[53:28] away
[53:29] unchanged but in the moment they enjoyed
[53:31] it they didn't understand it but they
[53:34] enjoyed
[53:35] it he says that's the same type of Mana
[53:39] that the Christian and is eating so he's
[53:40] saying they're sitting under the same
[53:42] blessings they sitting under the same
[53:44] experience and it's not that these
[53:45] people are unaware of God quite the
[53:48] contrary they just haven't come in to a
[53:50] place where it's a daily experience
[53:53] rather than an occasional event amen
[53:57] we ought to be Christians all the time
[53:59] not just in church not just when we're
[54:01] around Believers amen the reality of God
[54:03] ought to be a daily thing not just a
[54:05] church thing not just when we're around
[54:08] certain people otherwise Church we're
[54:10] playing at our Christianity that's for
[54:11] sure brother B continues he says now I
[54:14] met people who would stand in the church
[54:16] and just rejoice and see them go outside
[54:19] the church and maybe Monday or Tuesday
[54:22] one just living Unbecoming to a
[54:24] Christian and the man or woman whoever
[54:26] it may be will turn again and shake your
[54:28] hand and say I don't want to do those
[54:30] things you feel sorry for
[54:33] them what is it the desire is there the
[54:37] knowledge is there but something hasn't
[54:40] occurred that will take them to the
[54:41] place of living
[54:42] it so they go and they're eating Mana in
[54:45] the outer court but you could take now
[54:47] that mana and go into the next realm
[54:49] which was the Holy place and now you're
[54:51] into the spirit realm and remember under
[54:53] the work of Grace and sanctification and
[54:56] just ification he says I'll give you a
[54:58] new spirit hey the flesh is completely
[55:00] unconverted the spirit at least is new
[55:03] from him it's not his but it's new from
[55:05] him it's something that can get along
[55:07] with God so inside here now we're in
[55:09] something that's from God but it's not
[55:12] God so it's better but it's not the
[55:15] best and inside this place you can take
[55:18] that Mana now and you can move into the
[55:20] inner Court the holy place and the Mana
[55:23] though is still the same but the
[55:25] conditions have changed
[55:27] now you've got the Candlestick in there
[55:30] now you've got showbread that will last
[55:32] for seven days showbread out in the open
[55:35] won't last that long but you put it in a
[55:36] place where it's kept out of the
[55:37] elements and stuff it'll last for 7 days
[55:40] but that Mana still won't do it and the
[55:42] light is not affected by what's going on
[55:44] outside you don't get your hair all
[55:46] messed up in the Holy
[55:48] place the wind can't affect you the rain
[55:51] the darkness circumstances are shut out
[55:53] in the Holy place but you're still
[55:56] depending on your works because the
[55:59] light that's there is the light from a
[56:00] candle that you have to supply the oil
[56:03] you've got to keep it lit and the thing
[56:06] is eventually if we stayed here for
[56:08] billions of years we'd run out of oil
[56:11] and we wouldn't have enough to keep that
[56:12] lamp lit and it would go out and we
[56:14] would go back into darkness amen so it's
[56:17] a better place the rain doesn't soak you
[56:19] the night doesn't scare you the wind
[56:21] doesn't mess up your hair sisters but
[56:24] the light's still artificial and it
[56:26] doesn't do anything for the
[56:28] Mana but when you come into the holy of
[56:30] holies it's a whole different
[56:33] experience because in the holy of holies
[56:35] there is no artificial light there is no
[56:38] ups and downs it's the pillar of fire
[56:40] amen it's the presence of God himself
[56:43] and in the holy of holies you don't have
[56:45] to do any work to stay alive you ever
[56:48] realize that in the holy of holies
[56:50] you're in the presence of eternal life
[56:53] in that presence nothing fails
[56:56] nothing dies nothing gets sick rather
[57:00] the opposite is that which is dead
[57:02] becomes alive that's why I said you
[57:04] don't have to do anything in there in
[57:06] there is where the shikina glory of God
[57:08] dwelt and there's only a few things in
[57:10] there there's the revealed word there's
[57:13] the blood of the lamb and there's the
[57:15] presence of God it's a perfect type of
[57:18] the new birth it's a perfect type of the
[57:20] True Believer in this age amen when you
[57:22] got into the holy of holies now he was
[57:24] you weren't preserving yourself he was
[57:25] preserving serving you in that presence
[57:28] in there the presence of God brought
[57:31] eternal life that's why they could only
[57:33] go in for a little bit one day a week
[57:35] because that was literally the Tree of
[57:37] Life in there that was the presence of
[57:39] God that was eternal life in there in
[57:41] there the almonds never stopped budding
[57:43] on Aaron's rod in there the Mana stayed
[57:47] fresh why not because of me because of
[57:50] him he's preserving it he's keeping it
[57:54] fresh and it never runs out it's eternal
[57:56] life it's the word that keeps coming and
[57:58] coming and coming so in that presence if
[58:01] it brings out the original life then
[58:03] what would it do to a child of God it
[58:05] would bring out eternal life we couldn't
[58:08] stay in there that's why the veil was
[58:11] was was kept there until Christ died and
[58:13] then as soon as it's open now it's what
[58:15] it's eternal life is now available to
[58:17] all of us brother Bram says this he says
[58:19] now we notice that this Mana when it
[58:21] fell God sending it down to provide life
[58:24] for the children of Israel in their
[58:25] Journey then God told Moses and Aaron to
[58:28] go make a great golden pot and to fill
[58:30] it full of mana and put it in the
[58:31] holiest of holy places by the ark that
[58:35] Mana was to be set by the ark and there
[58:37] it never failed it never got old it
[58:39] never lost its sweetness it was always
[58:42] good inside
[58:44] there why it was in the presence of God
[58:48] he says did you ever meet a person
[58:50] that's been in there and has tasted and
[58:53] living on this Mana you can meet him on
[58:55] M Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[58:57] Friday Saturday or Sunday cloudy day
[59:00] Bright Day gloomy day things going right
[59:02] or wrong he is always sweet always full
[59:05] of love never to talk or do anything
[59:07] wrong he's living under the glory of God
[59:10] he never gets hungry he never has to go
[59:12] to church to get built up he is just
[59:14] always full of
[59:18] God now can I stop here and give us a
[59:21] dose of honesty and
[59:23] reality I have never in my life met a
[59:26] person that is always like
[59:30] this I've met people that are almost
[59:32] always like this but the simple fact is
[59:36] we are still in a body that's 2/3
[59:39] unredeemed and so we have moments at at
[59:42] at best we have
[59:44] moments where we fail where we fall
[59:46] where we drop down amen we have emotions
[59:49] we have feelings that can play with our
[59:50] mind we have sickness that can knock us
[59:52] down we get tired we don't get enough
[59:54] sleep these different things
[59:56] but the point he's trying to make here
[59:58] is this is a person that knows where to
[1:00:00] go to get it
[1:00:02] back brother Ram's not trying to pretend
[1:00:05] that we're all perfect we sin every
[1:00:07] single day every single one of us from
[1:00:09] the oldest to the youngest from the
[1:00:11] ministry through the lady it matters not
[1:00:13] we all make mistakes every single day
[1:00:16] but I look around this church and I look
[1:00:18] at some of the elders here all of the
[1:00:22] elders we'll include you too brother
[1:00:24] David tonight
[1:00:26] and yes your public Christianity your
[1:00:28] public Christian walk is a wonderful
[1:00:31] thing and many people would say Flawless
[1:00:34] or near Flawless but yet talking to you
[1:00:37] on a personal level and you share your
[1:00:39] struggles with me and I know it ain't
[1:00:42] perfect I know how you've had to go
[1:00:45] before God when your attitude's not
[1:00:47] right and say God my attitude doesn't
[1:00:49] match your attitude can I please have
[1:00:51] your attitude where people have crossed
[1:00:53] us up have done us wrong have falsely
[1:00:56] accused us have have cast slurs at us
[1:00:58] have ripped into our families and this
[1:01:01] flesh wants to rise up but what have we
[1:01:03] done Church we've gone from the outer
[1:01:05] Court through the holy place and into
[1:01:08] his presence and when we walk out the
[1:01:10] person that comes out is not the person
[1:01:12] that went in amen we haven't changed but
[1:01:16] what we've gone is we've taken ourselves
[1:01:17] out of the Flesh and out of the spirit
[1:01:19] and into the soul realm where there is
[1:01:22] something anchored that we can go to I
[1:01:25] have a sort of strength amen I have a
[1:01:27] meeting place where I can go before
[1:01:29] almighty God and he can take my desires
[1:01:32] that would hurt and tear down and break
[1:01:36] and respond and fight and put it aside
[1:01:39] and I can walk out and say like Christ
[1:01:42] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:01:44] they're doing even when it hurts my
[1:01:46] family even when it hurts my reputation
[1:01:49] even when they walk away say Lord Jesus
[1:01:52] forgive
[1:01:53] them that's what he's talking about a
[1:01:56] person that can go to a place where they
[1:01:58] can walk out and they're full of God
[1:02:01] again listen we don't lose the soul the
[1:02:04] sealing of the soul but we lose the
[1:02:08] feeling of our joy of our Salvation
[1:02:12] that's what David lost and it takes us
[1:02:14] going back into the presence amen of God
[1:02:18] to get back into that Soul
[1:02:21] realm I'm not saying we're one person
[1:02:23] one moment and then another person
[1:02:25] another moment
[1:02:26] I'm saying we've got to get to the place
[1:02:27] where we're letting the soul the control
[1:02:30] tower where Christ is in our life that's
[1:02:33] the one that would have the place amen
[1:02:35] where we've gone from our fleshly senses
[1:02:37] we've gone through the emotions of our
[1:02:39] spirit and we've come into that Center
[1:02:40] place of our soul where almighty God
[1:02:43] resides and there's where the change is
[1:02:45] made that's where the power is that's
[1:02:47] where the overcoming is that's where the
[1:02:49] victory is fought in one
[1:02:52] amen what happens is when we dwell on
[1:02:54] God and the things of God we get get
[1:02:56] centered again and it tells us what's
[1:02:58] important and let me tell you tonight
[1:03:00] Church our feelings aren't important our
[1:03:03] emotions aren't important our finances
[1:03:06] aren't important what matters to him is
[1:03:09] the kingdom of heaven and everything
[1:03:11] else has to be put aside everything else
[1:03:14] has to be put
[1:03:17] aside he says people go to church and
[1:03:19] they'll shake your hand in church and
[1:03:21] laugh and call you a brother and outside
[1:03:23] the church they pull a little business
[1:03:24] deal that wouldn't be just EX exctly
[1:03:26] straight for personal gain least little
[1:03:28] thing will bring that old temper back
[1:03:30] again that selfishness open up an ear to
[1:03:32] hear gossip or do something to that type
[1:03:34] that person has never entered into this
[1:03:36] pot in here they're
[1:03:38] outside this is some straight preaching
[1:03:40] tonight he says they're truly eating the
[1:03:43] same kind of mana and that Mana that
[1:03:45] they eat is the same Mana this man eats
[1:03:47] here he's saying the problem is not what
[1:03:49] they're
[1:03:50] eating he says they both have the same
[1:03:53] Pastor they both read the same Bible but
[1:03:55] one constantly stays true and humble and
[1:03:59] the other one has got his ups and downs
[1:04:00] going like this in and out both of them
[1:04:03] are eating the same Mana but one has
[1:04:05] entered in and the other one is still
[1:04:08] out he says both of them are believers
[1:04:11] unto eternal life but one is baptized
[1:04:14] with the Holy Spirit in the kingdom of
[1:04:15] God and the other one is outside eating
[1:04:17] the same Mana he says and the people
[1:04:20] have been telling us that you have to
[1:04:22] shout you have to get in here you have
[1:04:23] to speak with tongues to get in here you
[1:04:25] you have to do all these things but we
[1:04:27] find out that those things don't work
[1:04:31] I've seen people shout that lived any
[1:04:32] kind of a life I've seen people dance in
[1:04:35] the spirit up and down their halls and
[1:04:37] come back out and living horrible I've
[1:04:39] seen both men and women do that I've
[1:04:41] seen men and women dance in the spirit
[1:04:43] and speak with tongues and Shout that
[1:04:44] had a temper like I don't know what he
[1:04:46] says there is something
[1:04:48] wrong and yet they enjoy the blessings
[1:04:52] of God
[1:04:56] they believe in it they have faith in it
[1:04:59] but it's only in this outer Court it has
[1:05:02] never come to the inner Court he says
[1:05:04] they've never got from here the Mind
[1:05:07] down here to the soul that's what's the
[1:05:10] matter with the churches
[1:05:13] today so we see this distinction here
[1:05:16] and I know we're familiar with the idea
[1:05:18] that you can be around God you can be in
[1:05:20] the atmosphere of God you can be in the
[1:05:22] blessings and provision of God and yet
[1:05:24] you can be outside of Christ you can be
[1:05:27] Anointed with but not have it in you can
[1:05:32] be associated with it and not have it
[1:05:35] now that's a hard thing for people to
[1:05:37] understand but again if we go back to
[1:05:39] the original type which is Israel they
[1:05:41] had every benefit of the presence of God
[1:05:44] they had food every day they had water
[1:05:46] they had shelter their clothes didn't
[1:05:48] wear out they had the pillar of fire
[1:05:50] they had a prophet they had the word
[1:05:51] they had signs and wonders they had
[1:05:54] protection but only two of that original
[1:05:56] generation went
[1:05:58] in they had every aspect of the benefits
[1:06:02] and attributes of the presence of God
[1:06:05] and yet only two of them were true
[1:06:07] children of God that went in you've got
[1:06:09] Moses and Aaron as well that died
[1:06:11] beforehand but you've got people there
[1:06:12] that literally were under the anointing
[1:06:15] the personal presence of God over that
[1:06:17] entire camp with every blessing that it
[1:06:20] could offer and they were not children
[1:06:23] of God
[1:06:27] remember association with it won't get
[1:06:30] you in the foolish virgins were with the
[1:06:33] wise virgins they didn't get in they
[1:06:35] were around a lot of oil but they didn't
[1:06:36] go
[1:06:37] in remember the promise was that it
[1:06:40] would be in us not just around us God
[1:06:44] had been around them an awful long time
[1:06:47] but it was getting in them that was
[1:06:48] going to be the promise
[1:06:49] amen he says the heart is the Abode of
[1:06:52] God and in the Old Testament God dwelt
[1:06:55] in his glory over the ark and the Ark is
[1:06:58] the heart God dwells not in the head but
[1:07:00] in the heart he's not known by theology
[1:07:02] or by mental conception he's known by an
[1:07:04] oldfashioned Sanctified Born Again
[1:07:07] experience that's in the human heart he
[1:07:09] says yet men and women live a good life
[1:07:12] and love God by mental
[1:07:14] conception but the real hiding place is
[1:07:17] in the heart hidden with Christ and when
[1:07:21] Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your
[1:07:23] heart he is in you catch this with your
[1:07:27] temperament and he is living his own
[1:07:30] life in his own will through you
[1:07:33] Hallelujah he says so yielded you are
[1:07:36] that Christ speaks the kind of words he
[1:07:38] would speak he thinks the kind of
[1:07:40] thoughts he would think through you he
[1:07:42] does the kind of works he would do
[1:07:44] through you you are yielded and
[1:07:48] resting he says what a beautiful picture
[1:07:51] of a consecrated consecrated Christian
[1:07:54] yielded Christ working through see it's
[1:07:59] him that's working it's not you that's
[1:08:00] working you're resting and
[1:08:03] yielded you've ceased from your dead
[1:08:07] Works Paul
[1:08:09] said and we've come into a place of
[1:08:12] rest now I'm not trying to pretend
[1:08:14] church it's not a daily struggle that's
[1:08:16] not what we're talking about but the
[1:08:18] soul is settled there's an assurance
[1:08:21] there that we pass from Death unto life
[1:08:23] he says Paul said to me to live is
[1:08:25] Christ and to die is gain it's not me
[1:08:28] that liveth anymore but Christ that
[1:08:29] liveth in me Christ Living in the
[1:08:31] individual so surrendered when Christ
[1:08:34] speaks through the lips and thinks
[1:08:36] through the mind and sees through the
[1:08:37] eye and acts through the temperament
[1:08:40] than the things of the world have passed
[1:08:42] away he says how can it be anything but
[1:08:44] sweet and pleasant all the time Christ
[1:08:46] has got control amen you see it that's
[1:08:49] what it is it's Christ in you well you
[1:08:51] see he says you say I believe that to be
[1:08:55] the
[1:08:56] truth now this is perfection being
[1:08:59] spoken
[1:09:00] here that's what's
[1:09:04] available whether we live there is
[1:09:06] really a
[1:09:07] choice every day every day we have a
[1:09:11] choice are we going to feed our
[1:09:13] Christian walk or are we going to feed
[1:09:14] this flesh or are we going to feed our
[1:09:16] spirit some people are great at keeping
[1:09:18] the things of the flesh out but they've
[1:09:19] got so many mind gains going on and
[1:09:21] they're so caught up in emotions and
[1:09:23] drama that God is has no place there we
[1:09:27] can look down at the people that are
[1:09:28] home watching movies and then we're
[1:09:29] sitting here caught up in drama every
[1:09:31] single day guess what we're both pushing
[1:09:33] away the
[1:09:35] presence there's no difference we've got
[1:09:37] to push through to the holy of holies
[1:09:38] we've got to get into the soul realm
[1:09:40] amen he says you well you see you say I
[1:09:44] believe that to be the truth he says
[1:09:45] that's right it's in here he says but
[1:09:48] has it come here if it is your whole
[1:09:51] makeup is Christ your attitude your
[1:09:54] desire your appetite your everything is
[1:09:57] Christ yielded resting everything
[1:10:00] perfect no matter how dull it looks or
[1:10:02] how black it looks still it's the same
[1:10:04] Christ is in you he speaks to The Sinner
[1:10:07] in the voice that he would speak to him
[1:10:08] in he speaks to the prostitute in the
[1:10:10] voice that he would speak to them in he
[1:10:12] thinks through your mind the very
[1:10:14] thoughts that he speaks through your
[1:10:15] heart the very way that he would if he
[1:10:17] was here on Earth and you are no more
[1:10:20] your own but you're surrendered so we're
[1:10:23] kind of jumping ahead a little bit but
[1:10:24] he's talking talking about people that
[1:10:26] have come to a place of Rest In Christ
[1:10:28] and he's saying the purpose of the Holy
[1:10:30] Spirit and therefore the evidence of it
[1:10:32] will be when Christ is living through
[1:10:35] you if he's doing what he did before
[1:10:38] then you know that he's in you amen
[1:10:41] that's the purpose of the holy spirit is
[1:10:42] to make the Living Word come out to take
[1:10:45] the written word to take the spoken word
[1:10:48] and make it a Living Word and take our
[1:10:50] lives and put them into God's hands to
[1:10:52] bring us to a place where we're
[1:10:53] surrendered to him
[1:10:55] but I want to just drop something in
[1:10:57] here because we can look at this and we
[1:10:59] can think it's just a plan but church
[1:11:01] it's not just a plan of
[1:11:03] God there's a there's a much bigger
[1:11:06] sermon here but just as I was studying I
[1:11:08] had a great conversation with brother
[1:11:09] Garfield on on Sunday and it it just it
[1:11:12] really brought something out but this
[1:11:15] isn't just a plan of God but rather it's
[1:11:17] to produce what is already in
[1:11:20] eternity see we're here and we're we're
[1:11:22] in a place of an image we're in 2D or in
[1:11:25] 3D but he's wanting to bring us into
[1:11:27] four-dimensional he's wanting to bring
[1:11:29] us into the fullness of the reality of
[1:11:31] God and that can only be experienced in
[1:11:34] eternity in time it's limited in so many
[1:11:36] ways but Paul would say this in
[1:11:38] Ephesians 1 he said blessed be the God
[1:11:40] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:11:43] had blessed us with all spiritual
[1:11:45] blessings in Heavenly places in
[1:11:47] Christ according as he had chosen us
[1:11:50] where in who him when before the
[1:11:56] foundation of the world so before we
[1:11:59] ever came into existence here we were in
[1:12:02] Christ that's our that's our origin that
[1:12:05] we should be he's chosen us to be in
[1:12:08] Christ that we should be holy and
[1:12:10] Without Blame before him in love having
[1:12:12] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:12:14] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:12:17] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:12:18] will so Paul says in verse three there
[1:12:21] that we right now present tense are
[1:12:24] blessed with all all spiritual
[1:12:27] blessings what are spiritual
[1:12:29] blessings you have the the the gifts of
[1:12:32] the
[1:12:33] Spirit and you have the benefits of a
[1:12:35] child of God so you have everything from
[1:12:37] prophecy to speaking in tongues you have
[1:12:39] the gift of Divine Healing you have a
[1:12:41] word of knowledge you have the gifts of
[1:12:42] helps all these different things these
[1:12:44] are all spiritual
[1:12:47] blessings but let me ask you today do we
[1:12:50] have all spiritual blessings right here
[1:12:53] right
[1:12:54] now so you can give me two answers you
[1:12:56] can give me a faith answer or you can
[1:12:57] give me the reality
[1:12:59] answer the faith answer says yes we have
[1:13:01] it but the answer really is it's
[1:13:05] available because there is no prophecy
[1:13:08] going on right now you have the
[1:13:10] preaching of the word that's a form of
[1:13:12] Prophecy I guess but we don't have
[1:13:13] prophecy going on right now we don't
[1:13:15] have Divine Healing going on right now
[1:13:16] we don't have speaking in tongues going
[1:13:17] on right now we don't well we have the
[1:13:19] gift of helps going on with the people
[1:13:21] managing the systems but the point is
[1:13:23] that we are in time and God sovereignly
[1:13:26] decides when and how those gifts are
[1:13:28] operated and used in the body so
[1:13:31] everything is
[1:13:32] available but it's not in use all the
[1:13:34] time that's not the way that it works
[1:13:37] amen what it is is we're in we're
[1:13:39] creatures in
[1:13:40] time well look at
[1:13:43] Christ you look at Christ when he walked
[1:13:45] on this Earth was anything held back
[1:13:47] from him in terms of power or authority
[1:13:49] or gift he did it all but was Christ
[1:13:53] always prophesying no
[1:13:55] was Christ always healing no was he
[1:13:58] always doing signs and wonders no but
[1:14:01] every spiritual blessing was in him but
[1:14:04] it wasn't always in operation and it's
[1:14:06] the same thing for us it's there it's
[1:14:08] available but it's not always something
[1:14:10] that we're actively using and the
[1:14:12] reality is is that they are perfect and
[1:14:15] full in eternity but when they come into
[1:14:17] time time is a
[1:14:19] filter and what it does is it breaks it
[1:14:21] down from the fullness into an image
[1:14:25] and so what we get is just a portion of
[1:14:27] the fullness in time that's what we are
[1:14:31] right now if you think about it we are a
[1:14:32] portion of the fullness in time amen so
[1:14:36] what that does is time takes the Eternal
[1:14:38] perfect and full thing and it breaks it
[1:14:40] down into an image a representation a
[1:14:43] portion of what is really there in
[1:14:45] eternity rather than the thing itself so
[1:14:47] in eternity they don't have healing they
[1:14:50] have eternal
[1:14:51] life they don't have sorrow they have
[1:14:54] joy on speakable amen they don't have
[1:14:57] pain they have pleasure at his right
[1:14:59] hands are Pleasures forever more they
[1:15:01] don't have hunger they have
[1:15:04] satisfaction they don't have comfort
[1:15:07] they have perfect rest see all of these
[1:15:10] things remember you go in the Book of
[1:15:12] Revelation says that he will wipe away
[1:15:14] all tears from our eyes and there'll be
[1:15:16] no more sorrow or death or pain why
[1:15:19] because those things are sin are the
[1:15:22] cause of sin but the things we had to s
[1:15:24] satisfy them have Blended from the image
[1:15:27] into the reality of it the fullness of
[1:15:30] it amen so what we get here is just a
[1:15:33] taste of those things we have a portion
[1:15:35] of it because we're creatures bound up
[1:15:37] in time in a body that's 2third
[1:15:39] unredeemed so in in eternity healing for
[1:15:42] our bodies isn't needed why we are in a
[1:15:45] perfect glorified body
[1:15:49] amen we're in perfect restoration before
[1:15:52] God so what's the Holy Spirit here to do
[1:15:55] it's here to take us in this time into
[1:15:58] the image but it's not going to stop at
[1:16:00] the image but it's going to transform us
[1:16:02] into the reality of what's already in
[1:16:04] eternity waiting for us the fullness of
[1:16:07] God
[1:16:08] Amen healing is just the image of a
[1:16:11] glorified
[1:16:13] body healing is a representation of the
[1:16:16] resurrection and the Rapture that's
[1:16:17] coming right it's just representing
[1:16:19] what's waiting for us which is a
[1:16:21] glorified body it's not Perfection
[1:16:24] healing is not not Perfection but it's
[1:16:25] representing the Perfection that's
[1:16:27] already over there Comfort is temporary
[1:16:31] here but it's pointing to the Eternal
[1:16:33] rest that waits for us over there amen
[1:16:37] so the holy the holy spirit's here to
[1:16:39] draw us back to the fullness of the
[1:16:41] Eternal and it of the Eternal and it's
[1:16:43] the enforcer of bringing us into that
[1:16:46] reality amen into the reality of
[1:16:48] perfection of Eternity of perfect love
[1:16:50] and all those attributes it's here to
[1:16:52] take us from The Taste to the full meal
[1:16:55] if I could put it that way amen remember
[1:16:57] what Paul said I think uh 1 Corinthians
[1:17:00] uh 13 He says here we know in part we
[1:17:03] prophesy in part but when that which is
[1:17:07] perfect comes everything else goes away
[1:17:11] right he says here we see darkly we see
[1:17:14] a little bit but we don't see the whole
[1:17:16] thing we don't experience the whole
[1:17:19] thing you ever go to a place where they
[1:17:21] give you a sampler
[1:17:23] platter what's a sampler platter it's a
[1:17:26] taste of something you can order a whole
[1:17:28] meal of but it's a chance for you to try
[1:17:30] some a bunch of little things to see
[1:17:32] what you like and then you can order the
[1:17:34] full-size
[1:17:36] thing here on Earth that's what the holy
[1:17:38] spirit's doing is it's giving us a taste
[1:17:40] of what awaits Us in
[1:17:42] eternity
[1:17:44] amen it's here to give us a sampler
[1:17:47] platter of the word and what happens is
[1:17:49] we take a little taste of
[1:17:51] it and we might be a sinner we might be
[1:17:55] completely outside of God but what
[1:17:56] happens is somehow the word of God comes
[1:17:58] our way and it gives us a sample and we
[1:18:00] taste it and we say wow that's better
[1:18:04] than anything this world has offered me
[1:18:06] can I have some more please and what do
[1:18:09] we do we go in and we take the full word
[1:18:10] we take more and more of it and
[1:18:13] even when it hurts there's something
[1:18:16] about it that keeps drawing us back to
[1:18:18] it's like chocolate even when it hurts
[1:18:20] us we still keep coming back to it
[1:18:25] it's the only thing that'll satisfy a
[1:18:27] Believer you know my wife and I we were
[1:18:29] headed out one time for a uh an
[1:18:33] anniversary getaway and my dad called as
[1:18:36] we were leaving Edmonton just two of us
[1:18:38] in the sports car having a wonderful
[1:18:40] time trying to get through snow in a car
[1:18:41] with this much clearance dad says what
[1:18:44] are you doing I said well we're just
[1:18:45] driving down the highway trying not to
[1:18:47] die he says where are you going I said
[1:18:49] we're going to B for an anniversary
[1:18:50] weekend he says here's what I want you
[1:18:52] to do he says go to the nicest
[1:18:54] restaurant you can find and have an
[1:18:56] anniversary meal and send me the bill
[1:19:00] and we said
[1:19:01] Hallelujah and so what we did is we went
[1:19:03] to a restaurant called the Bison Terrace
[1:19:05] in B and there we had the most wonderful
[1:19:09] meal of our
[1:19:11] life everything was prepared by a
[1:19:15] highquality
[1:19:16] chef and you didn't get to choose your
[1:19:19] sides you didn't get to choose what came
[1:19:21] with it you ordered the meal and you ate
[1:19:24] it as as they provided it and I ate
[1:19:27] things there and tried things I would
[1:19:28] never have liked and you know what when
[1:19:31] it's made by a chef it's perfect they
[1:19:35] know how to blend it in they know how to
[1:19:36] contrast the tastes and the textures my
[1:19:39] wife got a dessert that came with a
[1:19:41] drink who who serves a a dessert with a
[1:19:43] drink but the drink was necessary to
[1:19:46] make the dessert perfect and it was it
[1:19:49] was perfect we had never eaten food like
[1:19:51] that before probably never never since
[1:19:54] it was a very expensive meal and I I'm
[1:19:56] so glad my dad did that so we could see
[1:19:58] it amen but this is what the holy
[1:20:00] spirit's doing is day by day it's giving
[1:20:03] us a taste of what's really waiting for
[1:20:05] us and it's that taste that makes us
[1:20:07] know there's more to come and there's
[1:20:09] better things to come and there's
[1:20:10] greater things to come and we keep
[1:20:12] coming back to the word for more of a
[1:20:14] taste
[1:20:16] amen but why do we receive the holy
[1:20:18] ghost in the first place cuz we have
[1:20:20] representation in
[1:20:22] eternity amen Paul said said we were
[1:20:25] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:20:28] world in him remember he said if we if
[1:20:31] if this if this body passes away we have
[1:20:34] another one already waiting for us
[1:20:36] listen God has a closet if you want to
[1:20:38] believe it with a glorified body or a
[1:20:41] theophany body for every single child of
[1:20:43] God there's no spares there's no extras
[1:20:46] cuz why he knows every single one that's
[1:20:48] coming and it's prepared just for us and
[1:20:51] if we pass away from this Earth we step
[1:20:54] right into that that
[1:20:55] theophany that's our representation
[1:20:58] that's our representation before God and
[1:21:00] it's waiting for us to move from a time
[1:21:02] of tasting to a time of being where the
[1:21:05] full realization we won't just look
[1:21:07] through a mirror Darkly as as Paul said
[1:21:10] but we'll see him because we'll we'll be
[1:21:12] like him we'll be in the fullness of the
[1:21:15] word exactly as he is remember what Paul
[1:21:17] said in Galatians he says and because ye
[1:21:19] are Sons because ye are
[1:21:23] Sons God God has sent forth the spirit
[1:21:25] of his son into your hearts crying Abba
[1:21:28] Father brother brah says this he says
[1:21:30] and when was your name put on the book
[1:21:31] of life before we ever had a world you
[1:21:34] were chosen to receive the Holy Ghost in
[1:21:38] This age praise the
[1:21:41] Lord so yes we're in a plan of God but
[1:21:44] it's not just a reactive plan of God
[1:21:46] it's just not just God coming up with
[1:21:48] something to do with time this is the
[1:21:51] the God has a a representation he has a
[1:21:54] reality in his mind and we came from
[1:21:57] there and now we're here in time and he
[1:21:59] sends the Holy Spirit to us to draw us
[1:22:01] back into the reality that was in his
[1:22:03] mind in the first place amen it's taking
[1:22:06] the word to do it and it takes us and it
[1:22:08] makes that word live through us and it
[1:22:09] produces the very thing that was in his
[1:22:11] mind because that's what the word is the
[1:22:13] thoughts of God Paul says this having
[1:22:16] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:22:17] will according to his good pleasure
[1:22:19] which he had purposed in himself that in
[1:22:21] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:22:23] times when the times right he Des it he
[1:22:26] says he might gather together in one all
[1:22:29] things in Christ remember what he said
[1:22:31] you were predestinated you were chosen
[1:22:34] in Christ before the foundation of the
[1:22:36] world now when it's all done he brings
[1:22:38] us right back to where we are why we
[1:22:40] have representation our names are on the
[1:22:43] book we have a theophonic
[1:22:54] Earth even in him so you can't be a part
[1:22:57] of God if you never were a part of God
[1:22:59] you had to be there in the beginning
[1:23:01] we've always been his family we aren't
[1:23:03] just his family now when we were born
[1:23:05] but we always were his family and he's
[1:23:07] Gathering us back to him and we'll see
[1:23:09] as we go through this series that the
[1:23:10] Holy Ghost is the resurrection and the
[1:23:12] Rapture that's exactly what it is it's
[1:23:14] the power of God to transform not just
[1:23:17] our nature and not just this flesh but
[1:23:19] it's to take this very body and our
[1:23:22] spirit and our soul and bring them
[1:23:23] together with that theop and give us a
[1:23:25] glorified body so we can be exactly the
[1:23:27] way Christ is amen he's Gathering us
[1:23:30] back to the great Unity of the word
[1:23:32] that's what he's doing he's bringing us
[1:23:34] back not to an existence of the letter
[1:23:36] not to the existence of a Doctrine not
[1:23:38] to the existence of an idea but back to
[1:23:41] the reality of the Eternal Living Word
[1:23:44] that's what's happening with the Holy
[1:23:45] Spirit in our
[1:23:46] lives and then we cheapen it and say
[1:23:48] it's here to make us speak in
[1:23:51] tongues it's not here just to make us
[1:23:53] speak in tongues that's it's okay it's
[1:23:55] not just here to overcome it's here to
[1:23:57] transform it's here to take the taste
[1:23:59] and bring us into the fullness of the
[1:24:01] reality take this image into the reality
[1:24:03] you know we love lots of different
[1:24:05] things for boys we might have pictures
[1:24:07] of cars on our wall listen there's a
[1:24:09] picture of a Lamborghini and that
[1:24:10] Lamborghini looks really good but
[1:24:12] somewhere there's a real
[1:24:14] Lamborghini and here what we have is we
[1:24:17] have a picture we have an image of the
[1:24:19] reality of God but some there someplace
[1:24:21] there's the reality of God and that's
[1:24:23] what it's trying to bring us back to we
[1:24:25] sing that old song You Know joy
[1:24:27] unspeakable and it says the half has
[1:24:29] never yet been told we go to the
[1:24:31] scripture brother Joe shared this this
[1:24:33] morning with the with with some people
[1:24:34] on WhatsApp and the scripture says but
[1:24:36] as it is written I had not seen nor ear
[1:24:40] heard neither have entered into the
[1:24:41] heart of man the things which God has
[1:24:43] prepared for them that love him well you
[1:24:46] can say well brother John we have the
[1:24:48] word that tells us it tells us but it's
[1:24:50] limited by our English language or
[1:24:52] whatever language we happen to read it
[1:24:53] in it's limited by this little tiny peab
[1:24:56] brain I have it's limited by what I
[1:24:58] think is beautiful and good and
[1:25:00] wonderful it's limited by what I think
[1:25:02] is
[1:25:03] pleasurable it's limited by me my
[1:25:07] understanding can only go as far as I've
[1:25:09] experienced something but Paul's saying
[1:25:11] listen what is waiting for you is so far
[1:25:14] beyond what you've heard what you've
[1:25:16] seen what you've thought about what
[1:25:18] you've imag imagined regardless of
[1:25:20] whether or not you have the Holy Spirit
[1:25:22] what's there is so much much further
[1:25:25] beyond what you've ever experienced here
[1:25:28] how wonderful is that going to be and
[1:25:31] we've experienced the presence of God
[1:25:32] we've experienced his love we've
[1:25:34] experienced the unity of the Brethren
[1:25:36] we've experienced healing and all these
[1:25:37] things but what will it be over there
[1:25:39] church if what we have is so wonderful
[1:25:42] as a taste what will the fullness be
[1:25:47] like but the holy spirit's here to break
[1:25:49] a break me out of the mold of what my
[1:25:51] eyes have seen and what my ears have
[1:25:53] heard because that's what limits my
[1:25:54] faith that's what limits my expectation
[1:25:57] is when I'm limited by what I can come
[1:25:59] up with rather than saying Lord let you
[1:26:01] do it your way and blow my mind with
[1:26:05] what you're able to do the holy spirit's
[1:26:08] here to get us to hear to see to accept
[1:26:11] what God has for us and lay aside
[1:26:14] everything that this mind can come up
[1:26:16] with and so the evidence of the Holy
[1:26:18] Spirit has to be tied to what it was
[1:26:19] sent for we know the effect of it we've
[1:26:23] seen it in our service we know what
[1:26:24] happens when the when the presence of
[1:26:26] God comes down in this this building or
[1:26:28] wherever it might be it has a different
[1:26:30] effect on all of us some of us shout
[1:26:33] some of us scream some of us cry some of
[1:26:35] us sit quietly some of us stand up and
[1:26:38] can't sit
[1:26:40] still some of us raise our hands some of
[1:26:42] us can't do anything just sit there limp
[1:26:45] in the presence of
[1:26:47] God that's the effect of the atmosphere
[1:26:49] but we're looking for the evidence of
[1:26:51] the indwelling spirit amen and it's a
[1:26:54] life-changing experience it's not
[1:26:57] temporary it's not occasional it's a day
[1:26:59] in day out 24/7
[1:27:03] 365 experience of God Amen we can't go
[1:27:06] out that church today and leave it here
[1:27:08] out those doors we can't leave it when
[1:27:10] we go to the gym we can't leave it when
[1:27:12] we go to school we can't leave it when
[1:27:13] we go to work it's with us it's in us we
[1:27:16] cannot separate ourselves from it
[1:27:18] otherwise we're playing around with our
[1:27:20] Christianity amen if it's not in us it's
[1:27:23] just on us and that means it can come
[1:27:25] and go but when the soul is sealed that
[1:27:27] means it's with us all the day to our
[1:27:29] full Redemption
[1:27:30] amen now we know the spirit of God the
[1:27:32] holy spirit is only for a child of God
[1:27:35] it is not for whosoever will Paul makes
[1:27:38] it abundantly clear because ye are Sons
[1:27:40] the spirit comes to you that's who it's
[1:27:43] for amen we read where Paul said that
[1:27:45] and so it's not by our choosing but it's
[1:27:47] by his choosing Before Time began
[1:27:49] remember Jesus said no man can come to
[1:27:51] the me except the father draw him first
[1:27:54] he says and I'll raise him up at the
[1:27:55] last day how by The Same
[1:27:58] Spirit we'll set ourselves up for the
[1:28:00] next service before we close this
[1:28:03] evening then we'll move on to the next
[1:28:05] part on Sunday Jesus says this he says
[1:28:07] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:28:09] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:28:12] that sent me have everlasting life and
[1:28:15] shall not come into condemnation but is
[1:28:17] passed from Death unto life now we have
[1:28:21] to be so careful here because you'll
[1:28:23] hear so many people people preach that
[1:28:25] if you believe that Jesus Christ died
[1:28:27] for your sins and you accept that you
[1:28:29] have eternal
[1:28:30] life that isn't what we see Peter
[1:28:33] preaching on the day of Pentecost that's
[1:28:35] not what we see Paul preaching we see
[1:28:38] him preach that Christ died for your
[1:28:39] sins that your sins can be forgiven but
[1:28:41] where did they always go to point to
[1:28:43] eternal life the Holy Spirit they
[1:28:47] preached you must receive the holy
[1:28:50] spirit that is What mattered that was
[1:28:53] eternal life eternal life is not
[1:28:56] believing eternal life is receiving your
[1:28:59] belief has to become sight it has to
[1:29:02] become a reality amen and so Paul would
[1:29:05] even warn of those that have tasted of
[1:29:08] the Holy
[1:29:09] Spirit it wasn't in their soul it wasn't
[1:29:11] a ceiling but they had it on them they
[1:29:13] had it around them they had gifts they
[1:29:15] had experiences they had all of the
[1:29:17] benefits without the indwelling of the
[1:29:19] spirit he says but they fall away and
[1:29:21] they can't renew themselves to
[1:29:22] repentance why they never were a child
[1:29:24] of God they never were sealed in their
[1:29:27] soul but yet they believed his word they
[1:29:29] accepted his sacrifice they did all
[1:29:31] sorts of things lived a religious even
[1:29:33] lived a Christian life but in the end
[1:29:35] they fell away they couldn't go all the
[1:29:37] way so Jesus words here are not what
[1:29:40] people take them to be because if you
[1:29:42] hear his word and you believe his word
[1:29:45] it'll have an effect brother brah said
[1:29:48] if you believe it you do
[1:29:49] it amen so if you believe his word then
[1:29:54] you'll accept his word then you'll obey
[1:29:57] his word and then you'll apply his word
[1:30:00] and then you'll receive the effect of
[1:30:01] his word that's the way it works amen
[1:30:04] you can't hear and believe it truly if
[1:30:06] you don't obey it and apply it they're
[1:30:08] all tied together so the true Christian
[1:30:10] experience is to receive the full word
[1:30:12] to get the full effect of the word right
[1:30:15] I've talked about this before and it was
[1:30:17] just a footnote in a service not too
[1:30:19] long past but in the New Testament the
[1:30:22] word here me obey it was implicit in the
[1:30:26] meaning was if you hear a word if you
[1:30:29] hear an instruction you didn't hear it
[1:30:31] unless you obeyed
[1:30:33] it why because you can't say you truly
[1:30:36] heard it and accepted it and understood
[1:30:38] it if you didn't do what you heard and
[1:30:41] it's only when you come into the New
[1:30:42] Testament that Christ separates hearing
[1:30:45] and obeying because they're under a New
[1:30:47] Covenant coming in and he's
[1:30:49] differentiating you can't just say I'm a
[1:30:51] child of Abraham we're looking for
[1:30:53] children of God
[1:30:54] CU they were resting on their on their
[1:30:56] their natural lineage amen but in in in
[1:30:59] the way they were taught in the Old
[1:31:00] Testament it was implied that if you
[1:31:03] heard something it meant you obeyed it
[1:31:05] and you did what you were told to do
[1:31:08] look at John 8 Jesus is talking to the
[1:31:09] priests here he says Jesus said unto
[1:31:11] them if God were your father you would
[1:31:13] love me for I proceeded forth and came
[1:31:16] from God neither came I of myself but he
[1:31:18] sent me why do you not understand my
[1:31:21] speech even because you cannot hear my
[1:31:25] word did they hear his word church oh
[1:31:27] they heard it cuz it offended them they
[1:31:30] heard it with their ears they heard it
[1:31:32] with their mind but they could not
[1:31:35] understand it they could not accept it
[1:31:37] they could not apply it much less obey
[1:31:40] it and Jesus said if you can't accept
[1:31:43] it then you'll never obey it and if you
[1:31:47] never obey it you're never going to get
[1:31:49] the benefit of
[1:31:50] it and so these men would never
[1:31:54] have the Holy
[1:31:56] Ghost cuz they couldn't hear the word
[1:31:58] that would give them the Holy
[1:32:00] Ghost he says ye are of your father the
[1:32:04] devil you can't change
[1:32:08] fathers we don't pick our fathers he
[1:32:11] says you're of your father the devil and
[1:32:13] the lust of your father you will do he
[1:32:15] was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:32:17] Abode not in the truth because there is
[1:32:20] no truth in him when he speaketh a lie
[1:32:22] he speaketh of his own for he is a liar
[1:32:25] and the father of it and because I tell
[1:32:27] you the truth ye believe me not he says
[1:32:31] which of you convinces me of sin and if
[1:32:33] I say the truth why do you not believe
[1:32:35] me he says he that is of god so in other
[1:32:40] words if you're a child of God that word
[1:32:42] of means if you're born of God if you
[1:32:44] come from God if God is your father then
[1:32:47] he that is of God heareth God's words
[1:32:52] not just here
[1:32:55] he hears obeys applies accepts
[1:33:01] expects
[1:33:03] receives he that is of God heareth God's
[1:33:06] words ye therefore hear them not because
[1:33:09] ye are not of God so Jesus is giving us
[1:33:12] here the evidence of who is and is not a
[1:33:15] child of
[1:33:16] God so if you are a child of God you
[1:33:20] will receive the Holy Spirit you have to
[1:33:23] it's a etal life You' got to be on that
[1:33:25] other end you've got to be there so
[1:33:27] you've got to recognize the evidence of
[1:33:29] a child of God so you can recognize what
[1:33:31] the Holy Spirit evidence is as well and
[1:33:33] Jesus says those that will receive the
[1:33:36] word of God truly in their hearts those
[1:33:38] are children of God now that doesn't
[1:33:41] mean they'll accept it the first time or
[1:33:43] the second time or the 10th time we are
[1:33:46] creatures of time we're in a battle God
[1:33:49] has a time appointed brother Braham said
[1:33:52] a Son of God can go long time before he
[1:33:54] realizes he's a Son of God he says in
[1:33:57] fact most of them are like that little
[1:33:59] chicken that was hatched among the or
[1:34:01] that little Eagle that was hatched among
[1:34:02] the chickens it took him a while to
[1:34:04] realize he wasn't one of
[1:34:06] them and you can be raised in a message
[1:34:08] home in a Christian home pick your pick
[1:34:10] your place and not realize that you're
[1:34:13] different because sometimes we fit in so
[1:34:15] well with the world in certain ways our
[1:34:18] skills our athleticism our wit our
[1:34:20] intellectuality whatever it might be our
[1:34:22] humor whatever it is we fit in real well
[1:34:26] in some cases and it takes a while for
[1:34:28] us to realize this isn't really working
[1:34:31] and it takes the word to do that and
[1:34:33] then we realize I'm a child of God and
[1:34:35] we can step out of those
[1:34:37] things but he says he that is of God
[1:34:40] heareth God's words and this is common
[1:34:42] to us all this is how I this is just me
[1:34:47] okay when you have somebody that Hears A
[1:34:50] Hard sermon and they can walk out and
[1:34:53] say that was just for me I say praise
[1:34:56] the lord we got a child of God
[1:34:58] here I cringe sometimes at the words I
[1:35:02] say over this Pulpit I'll be
[1:35:04] honest cuz I know it
[1:35:06] hurts sometimes we get a spiritual punch
[1:35:09] between the eyes and you know what a
[1:35:11] child of God
[1:35:12] does that's me
[1:35:15] Lord amen and then they move on with
[1:35:19] God I've got to keep my attitude right
[1:35:21] I've got to keep my motive and objective
[1:35:23] right I've got to be led of the spirit
[1:35:25] in those things but we've seen it many
[1:35:27] times in our midst I've been punched
[1:35:28] Between the Eyes by ministers in this
[1:35:30] church by the word they're speaking and
[1:35:33] and a child of God says thank you Lord
[1:35:36] for letting me know rather than oh my
[1:35:38] goodness don't let anybody find this
[1:35:41] out we open ourselves to the word rather
[1:35:45] than shielding ourselves from the word
[1:35:47] that's how you know you're a child of
[1:35:49] God as you will receive it regardless of
[1:35:51] how it impacts your life your emotions
[1:35:54] your pride your ego whatever it might be
[1:35:56] why because we are ordained to receive
[1:35:59] the word and God will get it through to
[1:36:02] us one way or the other Hey listen we
[1:36:04] might flare up sometimes and duck away
[1:36:06] and say no I'm not going to hear it
[1:36:07] that's not for me la la la la la I can't
[1:36:09] hear you but he'll get through because
[1:36:12] we are ordained to eternal life we're
[1:36:15] ordained to the character of the bride
[1:36:16] of Christ
[1:36:18] amen because we're children of God but
[1:36:21] Braham says now I've often spoke and
[1:36:23] believe this great faith or fundamental
[1:36:25] truth that Jesus Christ said he that
[1:36:27] heareth my word and believeth on me that
[1:36:29] sent on him that ha sent me ha
[1:36:31] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:36:33] condemnation but has passed from Death
[1:36:35] unto life he says you see it he that
[1:36:38] heareth my word oh I wish I could sink
[1:36:41] it into every heart that's his word what
[1:36:44] do you have to do believe hear Faith
[1:36:48] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:36:50] word of God he says and believing and
[1:36:55] applying and
[1:36:57] resting what's he saying he's saying if
[1:37:00] you receive the word if you truly
[1:37:02] receive the word it automatically means
[1:37:04] you will believe it you will apply it
[1:37:07] and it will have a resting effect on the
[1:37:10] believer
[1:37:12] amen these are all coming from the
[1:37:14] message why are people so tossed
[1:37:16] about he
[1:37:18] says you see it the word says
[1:37:21] so hear it your heart says so believe it
[1:37:25] and your whole being rests in it it's
[1:37:28] finished Jesus said the word he that
[1:37:30] heareth my words believeth on him that
[1:37:31] sent me of eternal life never ending
[1:37:34] always existing life he says isn't it
[1:37:36] marvelous ever existing life and shall
[1:37:39] never perish but had already passed from
[1:37:41] Death unto life has passed from
[1:37:44] Separation on to Everlasting presence
[1:37:49] amen he says already when you are an
[1:37:51] alien from God you cease from being an
[1:37:53] alien now you are a child he says from
[1:37:57] Death unto life from Darkness unto day
[1:38:00] from Mortal to Immortal from corruption
[1:38:02] to incorruption from weary unto Joy from
[1:38:05] Death unto life and resting fully upon
[1:38:09] thus saith the Lord what did we say
[1:38:12] earlier the holy spirit's here to take
[1:38:14] us out of the image into the fullness of
[1:38:17] the
[1:38:18] reality right you know when you look at
[1:38:22] TV in the early days everything I mean
[1:38:25] they had black and white and you
[1:38:26] couldn't hear anything but they went to
[1:38:28] cartoons and cartoons are
[1:38:31] two-dimensional but now they have
[1:38:33] everything is drawn in 3D and you can
[1:38:35] see full shapes and shadows and these
[1:38:37] different things and now we've gone to
[1:38:39] 40 where you can immerse yourself in it
[1:38:42] and it can wrap around you in all of
[1:38:44] these different
[1:38:45] things that's what we're trying to do is
[1:38:48] move from just a portion a little bit a
[1:38:52] flat representation
[1:38:54] limited by our carnality and our
[1:38:56] Humanity into the great Eternal fullness
[1:39:00] of God Amen he says it's not upon
[1:39:03] feelings mental emotions Theory upon
[1:39:07] some unknown something that somebody has
[1:39:09] said to you that has no basis upon
[1:39:12] someone saying well you come and join
[1:39:13] our church it'll be finished God help us
[1:39:15] if we get to that place church if the
[1:39:18] fact that somebody's attending means
[1:39:19] they're
[1:39:21] saved a life Chang Changed by the
[1:39:24] word he says but upon the word of God
[1:39:28] the human soul rests solid God said so
[1:39:32] that settles it and makes it real amen
[1:39:35] God bless you let's stand together if we
[1:39:37] would where is our soul
[1:39:40] resting is it resting because we had a
[1:39:42] shouting singing dancing running
[1:39:46] hollering crying
[1:39:49] service does it rest on how often we
[1:39:52] raise our hands or fall to our
[1:39:54] knees does it rest on how I'm feeling
[1:39:57] close to God
[1:39:59] today does it rest on how close I'm
[1:40:01] feeling to my brothers and
[1:40:03] sisters has nothing to do with it our
[1:40:06] soul rests on one place God said it I've
[1:40:11] received it that settles it
[1:40:13] amen I want to say one thing before we
[1:40:16] close tonight you know we read about
[1:40:18] that original Church in the book of Acts
[1:40:20] and we're going to read a whole lot more
[1:40:21] about that book of Acts Church
[1:40:23] as we go through
[1:40:25] this but everything I'm seeing today not
[1:40:28] in the message but everything outside of
[1:40:32] us in Christianity is saying you cannot
[1:40:35] have an experience with God like they
[1:40:38] had you know why because none of them
[1:40:40] have
[1:40:42] it and they have stated that because we
[1:40:44] don't have it it is not available I'm
[1:40:47] here to tell you tonight if you don't
[1:40:48] have it it's
[1:40:51] available every as ask aspect of it I
[1:40:54] know of a person that had never spoken
[1:40:55] in tongues and they wanted to speak in
[1:40:58] tongues it has nothing to do with
[1:41:00] Salvation Church it has nothing to do
[1:41:02] with their Eternal destination but the
[1:41:04] Bible says you could have it and they
[1:41:07] said I want it and you know what God did
[1:41:09] God allowed them to speak in tongues and
[1:41:12] speak in tongues with the purpose of
[1:41:16] interpretation it's not held
[1:41:20] back we hold back
[1:41:23] we don't expect we don't
[1:41:25] ask my faith is not resting on the signs
[1:41:29] and wonders and the blessings of God and
[1:41:32] those different things my soul is
[1:41:33] settled because I've had a personal
[1:41:35] experience with Jesus Christ where he
[1:41:37] made himself real to me and called me
[1:41:39] and settled my soul but I have
[1:41:42] experienced many things not everything
[1:41:44] yet but I believe it's available and if
[1:41:48] we seek after it Paul said seek the best
[1:41:52] gifts but but he says but I show you a
[1:41:54] better way that was charity that was the
[1:41:58] agapo love the very presence of God in
[1:42:00] our lives but that doesn't mean we have
[1:42:02] to throw away everything else with it
[1:42:04] I'm not looking to turn us into some
[1:42:06] sort of a particular church with signs
[1:42:08] and wonders and and shouting all the
[1:42:09] time or prophecy or tongues and
[1:42:11] interpretation but I say Lord if you
[1:42:13] have a need for it give it and let us
[1:42:16] receive it let us be willing vessels for
[1:42:18] it amen but one thing's for sure you
[1:42:22] don't have to go through life without
[1:42:23] the Holy Ghost you don't have to live a
[1:42:25] cold formal message Doctrine life you
[1:42:30] can have a satisfied Assurance in your
[1:42:33] soul that you passed from Death unto
[1:42:35] life and you've got a
[1:42:37] Wellspring of Life bubbling out of you
[1:42:41] that on your worst day you still can't
[1:42:43] quench
[1:42:44] it why because it's Christ in you amen
[1:42:49] God bless you Heavenly Father
[1:42:53] Lord I love the promise of your
[1:42:56] word Lord our great
[1:43:00] security our
[1:43:02] hope our rest our trust is that you do
[1:43:07] not
[1:43:08] lie Lord that you have said it you will
[1:43:12] do it and if we are a child of God every
[1:43:16] promise in the book is
[1:43:19] mine Lord God
[1:43:26] set our
[1:43:27] eyes on the things of
[1:43:30] God set our hearts Lord on the Promises
[1:43:34] of your
[1:43:38] word Lord let us walk away from these
[1:43:41] things that so easily beset
[1:43:45] us Lord that we could have a
[1:43:48] taste of those things that are so much
[1:43:51] greater
[1:43:53] so much
[1:43:55] higher so much beyond the things that
[1:43:57] this world tries to satisfy our souls
[1:44:00] with Lord let us go out of
[1:44:03] a place of in andout and up and
[1:44:08] down lord a place of being controlled by
[1:44:13] circumstances Lord a place controlled by
[1:44:15] emotions and feelings and hurts and
[1:44:17] offenses and Rights and Wrongs Lord and
[1:44:20] come into a place where your shakina
[1:44:22] glor Glory sits us at rest Lord with
[1:44:26] your revealed word and the covering of
[1:44:28] your blood Lord we can sit a while Lord
[1:44:33] and listen and learn and be
[1:44:35] saturated Lord with the goodness of
[1:44:38] God lord I pray you fill us a new if
[1:44:41] we've received your spirit Lord I pray
[1:44:44] you pour it out Lord and if there's
[1:44:47] anyone here this night Lord that is
[1:44:50] sitting in a place of coldness a place
[1:44:53] where they have not yet reached that
[1:44:55] Assurance Lord I pray they'd seek you
[1:44:58] until they find you Lord that they would
[1:45:00] open up their hearts their
[1:45:02] soul lord that they would rest that you
[1:45:06] have offered it to your
[1:45:08] children and it is available to all that
[1:45:12] will accept it Lord your Prophet said
[1:45:14] you're wanting to give it more than we
[1:45:17] want it Lord I pray you raise a desire
[1:45:19] in our heart for more of you in Jesus

[2:09:58] [Music]
[2:10:02] and
[2:10:05] Hallelujah the Lord
[2:10:08] hallelujah oh that's
[2:10:10] loud um I thought I shared with you real
[2:10:13] quick um I was studying the book of
[2:10:16] Galatians today and so tied to the
[2:10:18] message that John was preaching
[2:10:21] interestingly chapter one spoke about
[2:10:24] how you um your old self comes in place
[2:10:29] of your spirituality how you're let me
[2:10:33] say I'm a Nigerian right how I want to
[2:10:36] serve God but instead of serving God
[2:10:38] based on his word I want to serve God as
[2:10:40] a Nigerian and that impacts my spiritual
[2:10:43] journey and there's an interesting thing
[2:10:45] I found in chapter 3 it says we've been
[2:10:48] introduced to God now it's our
[2:10:50] responsibility to Ure we get to know him
[2:10:54] imagine being introduced to brother
[2:10:56] brandham at this a day and age you would
[2:10:59] have series of questions you want to
[2:11:01] know how is his journey you want to ask
[2:11:03] you want to talk to him you just want
[2:11:05] that conversation so you've been
[2:11:06] introduced to God it's now your
[2:11:08] responsibility to get to know him to ask
[2:11:10] him those questions and say hey let me
[2:11:12] know more about you there's so much I
[2:11:14] you know I need to uning about you I
[2:11:16] just want to know more about you it's
[2:11:17] really our responsibility and then he
[2:11:19] ended in chapter 6 talking about
[2:11:23] how interestingly he
[2:11:26] said when you start any work your focus
[2:11:30] should be to do the job right it's not
[2:11:33] to be complimented it's not to receive
[2:11:35] praise your focus to finish it so we're
[2:11:38] trying to get to know God our focus is
[2:11:40] to get to know God it's not to be
[2:11:42] complimented and it's to say oh you're
[2:11:44] doing well we like how you sing and how
[2:11:46] you pray and all that but your focus is
[2:11:48] to do it well but he also ended with
[2:11:50] something very funny which is he said
[2:11:53] you still cannot get to know God without
[2:11:55] God you did so that would be the basis
[2:11:59] of my prayer tonight and if any of you
[2:12:02] would like to pray for me tomorrow don't
[2:12:03] worry I'm not a fan of gifts um I'll be
[2:12:05] older tomorrow just pray for me and uh
[2:12:09] pray that I I'm able to yield as well
[2:12:12] cuz I'm a control freak all right let us
[2:12:15] pray in Jesus name our heavenly father
[2:12:18] we've heard your word and it's stood in
[2:12:21] into our heart it's reassuring because
[2:12:24] it's giving us Clarity on our journey
[2:12:27] it's making us desire you more is making
[2:12:29] us cling to you more and more we thank
[2:12:32] you for using your servant to speak to
[2:12:34] us and to open our eyes to the reality
[2:12:38] of your word and building the love and
[2:12:41] the desire and that peace and joy and
[2:12:45] comfort of knowing that we have a father
[2:12:47] who loves us and who truly desire the
[2:12:50] best for us who has planned our life
[2:12:53] from the before we were even born or to
[2:12:55] the end of our journey and he is
[2:12:57] strategically being in places where we
[2:13:00] want him to be in times when we are down
[2:13:02] lord you were there in times when we are
[2:13:04] smiling you made it happen for us and
[2:13:07] for this oh Lord we ask that you give us
[2:13:09] this desire and the spirit to yield to
[2:13:11] you to your word and to your will don't
[2:13:14] let any part of us the old self the old
[2:13:17] self that keeps coming out that's logic
[2:13:20] that's morals that is that thing that
[2:13:22] will makes us think that that's the best
[2:13:24] way to serve you which is not but we all
[2:13:26] be want to hold on to you just the way
[2:13:30] you want us to we want to come to a
[2:13:32] point where none of our none of us exist
[2:13:35] but basically it's you living through us
[2:13:38] until we come to that point Lord don't
[2:13:40] let us go we ask this in the fullness of
[2:13:44] joy in our hearts and we pray for every
[2:13:45] other member of the church that are not
[2:13:47] here today we your peace be with them
[2:13:51] and that your mercy be with them as we
[2:13:53] go home Lord we also pray that your
[2:13:55] peace and your mercy go with us let the
[2:13:58] joy of our Salvation envelop us every
[2:14:01] day of our lives in Jesus name we pray
[2:14:04] amen amen
