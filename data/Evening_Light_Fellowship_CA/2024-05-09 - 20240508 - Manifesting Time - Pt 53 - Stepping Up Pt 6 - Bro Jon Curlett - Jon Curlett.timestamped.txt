[40:43] Revelation 1 and verse4 familiar
[40:45] scripture after the last few Services he

[40:49] are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace
[40:53] from him which is and which was and
[40:55] which is to come and from the seven
[40:56] spirit which are before his throne and
[40:59] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[41:01] witness and the first begotten of the
[41:03] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[41:05] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[41:08] us from our sins in his own blood and ha
[41:10] made us Kings and Priests unto God and
[41:13] his father to him be glory and Dominion
[41:16] forever and ever amen God bless you you
[41:18] can have your seats this evening and as

[41:22] series on manifesting time and I want to
[41:25] take yet another six service on stepping
[41:27] up amen and I I'm trusting that this is
[41:29] starting to hit home after 53 portions
[41:33] of adoption I hope that we're starting
[41:35] to gather what it is to mean to to be an
[41:38] adopted son an adopted daughter of
[41:40] Christ and we want to speak again of
[41:42] kingship this evening and last service
[41:44] we talked about it the the kingship has
[41:46] to start in that we can't be the kings
[41:48] of our own lives we have to give over
[41:50] that to Christ and we have to let him be
[41:52] king and when we let the Holy Spirit
[41:54] come in now we come under his Dominion
[41:56] we come under his Authority and that's
[41:58] by the word of God and then from there
[41:59] his Dominion starts to take effect in
[42:01] our lives amen and before we can have
[42:03] effect on others we've got to let him
[42:05] have an effect on us and it's it's God
[42:07] within us now working and doing these
[42:09] things by the Holy Spirit and our lives
[42:11] are driven by the Holy Spirit and
[42:13] tonight I want to focus on what that was
[42:15] last service we we kind of ended on
[42:17] dominion and we we spoke about it
[42:19] generally but I want to go into the
[42:20] details of dominion and what that
[42:22] Dominion looks like in our in our
[42:23] personal lives as individuals sitting
[42:26] here this evening uh listening to the
[42:28] word and I want to pick up with a quote
[42:30] that we read in the last portion of
[42:31] service on Sunday brother Bram says this
[42:33] he says we are Kings spiritual Kings he
[42:36] says oh we're going to be Kings upon the
[42:38] Earth with him when he sits on his
[42:40] throne but now we are spiritual Kings
[42:43] and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom
[42:45] that means that our battles are going to
[42:47] be spiritual amen that it is not flesh
[42:49] and blood but it's against
[42:50] principalities and powers and darkness
[42:53] and all these different things he says
[42:55] right now right now today church we
[42:57] reign with Christ having dominion over
[43:00] these four things he says we have
[43:01] dominion over sin the World the Flesh
[43:05] and the devil but what is it that's
[43:07] doing this he says it's showing forth
[43:09] his praise and glory showing forth
[43:12] himself for it is Christ in US willing
[43:16] and doing of his good pleasure that
[43:18] means it is his will it is his pleasure
[43:20] that we would have dominion over sin
[43:22] that we would have dominion over the
[43:23] world that we would have dominion over
[43:25] the flesh that Satan couldn't put one
[43:27] over on us at any time that is his will
[43:29] and that's his good pleasure for the
[43:31] believer tonight he says yes indeed even
[43:34] now we are seated in Heavenly places in
[43:37] Christ Jesus so we have dominion over
[43:40] these things and I want to just do a
[43:41] quick refresh this evening and we read
[43:43] last service that Dominion means supreme
[43:46] authority not just Authority we see in a
[43:49] in a country we see in a company we see
[43:51] people that have authority but in every
[43:53] one of those places there's somebody
[43:55] that has supreme authority every answers
[43:57] to them and it's usually the CEO or the
[43:59] president of the company the owner of
[44:01] the company here in Canada it's the
[44:03] Prime Minister but above the prime
[44:05] minister is actually the king if we
[44:07] wanted to go that far and everything
[44:09] comes back to him the buck stops with
[44:11] him or the buck stops with hers the case
[44:13] may be but there's a supreme authority
[44:15] and this Dominion that the the scripture
[44:17] is talking about gives us supreme
[44:19] authority it means that that is what is
[44:21] available to our lives but there is
[44:23] sovereignty and we understood that that
[44:25] was self-rule
[44:27] nothing can force us to do something we
[44:29] don't want to do now that's a key
[44:32] because oft times what we have going on
[44:33] in our lives is because we allow it and
[44:36] because we choose it even when we fall
[44:38] away sometimes but we allow it and when
[44:40] we decide we don't want it that's when
[44:42] God goes to working but if we want it in
[44:44] our lives then it's going to stay there
[44:45] Satan's got every right cuz we're the
[44:46] ones that opened the door to him and
[44:48] then that third thing was absolute
[44:50] ownership and we talked about that
[44:52] because it's property rights it's the
[44:54] abstract title deed that we don't just
[44:55] own the land we owned everything
[44:57] everything above the land everything on
[44:58] the land and everything below the land
[44:59] nothing can come on our property unless
[45:01] we allow it and we've got Holy Ghost
[45:03] rights we've got word rights to push off
[45:05] anything that comes on our property but
[45:08] as we move on this series on adoption
[45:10] and as we start to close it down I know
[45:12] I keep saying it and it just keeps
[45:13] moving on and on but we'll be talking
[45:15] more and more about the Holy Ghost
[45:17] because the Holy Ghost we've talked
[45:19] about it it makes all the difference
[45:21] this is the key to all of this is going
[45:23] to be the Holy Ghost and when we
[45:24] recognize that it's the Holy Ghost in US
[45:27] that is Christ in us and we are
[45:28] submitted to Christ then we have
[45:30] dominion we have supreme authority over
[45:34] everything that comes against us but I
[45:36] want us to realize that sometimes the
[45:38] battle is not over what comes against us
[45:40] it's what's in us already and it's that
[45:41] self-will it's that human nature it's
[45:44] that flesh it's the Mind battles and
[45:45] these different things but it's the
[45:47] power of the holy spirit that overcomes
[45:48] in every situation by the word of God
[45:51] now I want to talk about what this looks
[45:53] like and in Ephesians 1 it says it says
[45:55] that the god of Lord Jesus Christ the
[45:58] father of Glory may give unto you the
[46:01] spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the
[46:03] knowledge of him we're talking about
[46:05] Dominion now he says the eyes of your
[46:07] understanding being enlightened that ye
[46:09] may know what is the hope of his calling
[46:12] and what the riches of the glory of his
[46:14] inheritance in the Saints and what is
[46:16] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[46:20] us word we could say toward us who
[46:23] believe according to the working of his
[46:25] mighty power now we've talked about this
[46:27] before this word power is dunamis and it
[46:30] is a reference to the power of the holy
[46:32] spirit in The Believer it is the literal
[46:35] literal powerful attributes of God in
[46:38] The Believer amen and notice that Paul
[46:40] says here in verse 17 he says that God
[46:43] did would not just give us a spirit he
[46:44] said God would give us the spirit amen
[46:47] it is the holy spirit it's his his
[46:49] Spirit itself of wisdom and Revelations
[46:52] and what do those things do it says here
[46:54] that it opens our eyes our understanding
[46:57] is enlightened the eyes of our
[46:59] understanding would be enlightened Jesus
[47:01] said that the Holy Spirit would lead us
[47:03] into all truth what you have need of
[47:06] he'll give you if you need it he's going
[47:08] to give it to you that's the truth
[47:10] that's required for our lives but not
[47:12] only that we would know it but notice he
[47:14] says here that we would know the the
[47:16] hope of his calling not that we would
[47:19] have hope but that we would know the
[47:21] Hope in other words that we would have
[47:23] the reality of a living Christ in our
[47:25] lives day by day it's not not just a
[47:27] knowing by by understanding but it's a
[47:29] knowing by experience that the believer
[47:31] has and then he says we would know the
[47:34] hope of his calling and the riches of
[47:36] the glory of his inheritance hey I'd be
[47:39] happy with just an inheritance but he
[47:40] says there's glory and there's riches
[47:42] that come with this inheritance it's a
[47:44] wonderful thing that he's offered us
[47:45] tonight church but not only in verse
[47:48] what he has in verse 18 you know with
[47:51] these things but he says now it's not
[47:52] just knowledge or understanding this
[47:54] isn't an intellectual Dominion
[47:57] I was telling my wife I was watching a
[48:00] man that that was trying to turn away
[48:03] acts 238 and he said that was only for
[48:05] the Jews because as soon as we see
[48:07] everybody else they don't get it the way
[48:09] the Jews did and I guess he completely
[48:12] ignored what happened to Cornelius I
[48:14] guess he completely uh ignored what
[48:17] happened to to the Samaritans but he
[48:19] said he went to the to the story of the
[48:21] unic in The Chariot where Philip was
[48:23] caught up in the spirit and he said that
[48:25] man was saved when he believed and then
[48:27] he got baptized and that's the path for
[48:29] the Gentiles but then we go see
[48:31] Cornelius who's a gentile and while he's
[48:34] yet preaching the Holy Ghost falls on
[48:35] him and it was exactly the way it was on
[48:38] the day of
[48:39] Pentecost why because he was trying to
[48:41] fit his Doctrine his church into the
[48:44] word what the truth could not come into
[48:47] him because he's satisfied where he's at
[48:49] he's satisfied with his church
[48:50] experience but I thought how sad that
[48:52] that man he's a PhD of Theology and he
[48:56] doesn't
[48:57] understand what sister Lydia understands
[48:58] this this evening how sad it is but the
[49:02] Holy Ghost is there to Open the Eyes of
[49:04] our understanding you know why that man
[49:06] doesn't believe in the Holy Ghost
[49:07] because he doesn't have the Holy Ghost
[49:09] you know why we believe in the Holy
[49:10] Ghost not just because the Bible says it
[49:12] but because we have it because we've
[49:14] experienced what this does in our life
[49:16] and that's what we're going to talk
[49:17] about this evening is that I can testify
[49:19] that there is a holy ghost available to
[49:21] the believer today because I've got it
[49:23] and I've seen what he does in the lives
[49:24] of men and women that that can accept it
[49:27] amen but because he says here that this
[49:30] is not just understanding and this is
[49:32] just not intellect but he says it's the
[49:34] exceeding greatness of his power in
[49:36] other words it's an experience and he
[49:39] says now it is not something you're
[49:40] doing but he says it's something I'm
[49:42] doing because it's my work that's doing
[49:45] this ministry of the mighty power it's
[49:47] him inside of us that's doing this
[49:49] notice the holy spirit is power but I
[49:51] want to say it this way tonight you
[49:53] don't have power the power has you amen
[49:56] that's the key to this is that we are
[49:58] surrendered and then it works through us
[50:00] and it looks like we've got power but
[50:02] remember what they said to Peter and
[50:04] John they said how did you do this they
[50:05] said we didn't do it it was the power of
[50:07] God that did it's through faith in
[50:09] jesus' name that did it they don't have
[50:11] anything it's something had them and it
[50:13] used them and it operated them to
[50:14] produce a healing in that man brother
[50:16] Ram said I'd heal you if I can but he
[50:19] says I don't have any healing power but
[50:21] I can take you to the one that has
[50:22] healing power amen it's the working of
[50:25] the power in us the key is not that we
[50:27] have power the key is that the power has
[50:29] us and it's using us and it's working
[50:30] through US day by day God's trying to do
[50:33] it and it says it's an effective work
[50:34] when he does it it's an effective work
[50:37] that word means it says according to the
[50:39] working the effective operation of his
[50:41] mighty power God's trying to do things
[50:43] in our lives church but you know the
[50:45] first thing he does he gives us a test
[50:48] so he can give us a testimony so we can
[50:50] go tell somebody we've got Mighty power
[50:52] working in our lives we've got a living
[50:54] God that's working in our lives day by
[50:56] day
[50:57] what are we going to talk to people
[50:58] about are we going to go talk to our our
[51:00] our our work colleagues about the the
[51:02] the opening of The Seven Seals that goes
[51:04] right over their head but you when you
[51:06] say God heal me God deliver me God show
[51:09] me what to do God warm me God preserve
[51:11] me that's something they can identify
[51:13] with that's the effectual working of the
[51:16] holy spirit in the believer's lives is
[51:18] it gives them a testimony that they can
[51:19] share with other people and so often we
[51:22] shrink back from those trials instead
[51:23] God's trying to show us what he can do
[51:25] in our lives when we'll just understand
[51:26] understand that he's there amen Our
[51:28] Testimony is the evidence of what faith
[51:30] will do in in a believer's life amen
[51:33] look what he says in verse 20 he says
[51:34] which he wrought in Christ when he
[51:36] raised him from the dead and set him at
[51:39] his own right hand in the Heavenly
[51:40] places the holy spirit is resurrection
[51:43] power amen remember we die first in this
[51:46] in in our souls and in our spirits and
[51:48] we die and we are born again as new
[51:50] creatures in Christ it's a resurrection
[51:53] power that's only the first fruits
[51:55] though of what's coming when these
[51:57] bodies go by way of the Grave or they go
[51:59] in a Rapture and we get a glorified body
[52:01] in a moment in a in a change in a
[52:02] twinkling of an eye amen this is the
[52:05] setting of us in places that we couldn't
[52:07] come to before we sang that song I
[52:09] thought it was so perfect when I
[52:10] couldn't go to him he came to me and now
[52:13] he's taking us to where he is because he
[52:15] came and took our place he made a way
[52:17] for us to go and so now we are seated in
[52:19] Heavenly places right now and that is
[52:22] where our Dominion is it's under the
[52:23] hearing of the word it's under the
[52:25] revealing of the word
[52:27] where is this
[52:31] place it's far above Hallelujah far
[52:35] above
[52:37] listen as humans I think we're satisfied
[52:40] with just enough but God is not a god of
[52:43] just enough God is a god of superlatives
[52:46] he is a god of exceeding he's a god of
[52:48] far above and he says where he has
[52:50] placed us is far above that's Dominion
[52:54] that's overwhelming superiority
[52:57] in in in in fighter battles in in in
[53:00] when you're you're flying jets and that
[53:02] altitude is the the key to Victory the
[53:05] one that's highest gets the victory when
[53:07] they have land battles the one that has
[53:09] The High Ground usually wins and he says
[53:12] we are far above we're not just above
[53:15] we're way higher way above it's not even
[53:18] close we're far above all principality
[53:21] and power and might and Dominion that
[53:24] means there's might out there that means
[53:26] there's Dominion out there Satan has
[53:28] some power Satan has some Authority he
[53:30] has some Dominion but we're way above it
[53:33] that means we're going to face battles
[53:35] because there are mights and dominions
[53:37] coming against us but we are far above
[53:39] it we are more than conquerors amen
[53:42] tonight he says we are that might and
[53:44] dominion and every name that is named
[53:47] not only in this world but also in that
[53:50] which is to come you know I think about
[53:52] that and you know what we don't we don't
[53:53] put a name on it anymore of Satan but
[53:56] you you know what comes against us
[53:58] cancer amen high blood pressure heart
[54:01] disease family genetic traits and
[54:05] there's names that we put on these
[54:06] mental diseases everybody's got a mental
[54:09] disease these day everybody can be
[54:12] diagnosed with something if they spend
[54:13] enough time around medical professionals
[54:16] and we put names on them and all it is
[54:18] is satanic power that's trying to come
[54:19] into our lives we read last service
[54:22] about that box of rattlesnakes don't you
[54:24] take the box of rattlesnakes of a name
[54:27] that Satan tries to give a disease that
[54:28] he's trying to put on you don't ever
[54:30] confess that don't ever confess it cuz
[54:33] that's you taking it into your personal
[54:34] possession now he says and he hath put
[54:38] all things under his feet remember
[54:40] Dominion is supreme authority that's why
[54:42] he says all things are under his feet
[54:44] because he has Dominion amen he says and
[54:47] gave him to be the head over all things
[54:49] to the church there's our King there's
[54:52] our Dominion is right there it's Christ
[54:54] he says but let's see our place now
[54:56] because he's talking about Christ as all
[54:58] his Dominion but now he says what and
[55:00] has B ba him to be the head over all
[55:03] things to the church which is his body
[55:06] the fullness of him that filth All In
[55:08] All We Are the fullness of the one that
[55:10] fills us look at what it says here it
[55:13] says which is his body the fullness of
[55:16] him who fills all in all now here's our
[55:18] description Church here's our Dominion
[55:21] for in that body lives the full measure
[55:26] of him who makes everything complete
[55:28] Hallelujah who makes everything complete
[55:30] you say brother John I'm lacking
[55:32] something tonight you've got the god in
[55:34] you that makes everything complete he
[55:36] says and who fits everything everywhere
[55:40] with himself he makes us compatible with
[55:42] him and he makes us compatible with each
[55:45] other brother Braham said all that God
[55:47] was he poured into Christ and all that
[55:49] Christ was he poured into the church
[55:51] Christ was the fullness of the godhead
[55:53] bodily today the bride is the fullness
[55:55] of Christ bodily on this Earth that's
[55:58] where we are today amen without you
[56:00] without me the body of Christ is
[56:01] incomplete so we've got to be in our
[56:03] place and position but I want you to
[56:05] come back to the quote that we read at
[56:07] the start of this service and I'm going
[56:08] to read it again because brother branam
[56:10] is placing us into Ephesians 1 which we
[56:12] just read and it's this quote that we
[56:14] read here he says right now we reign
[56:16] with Christ having dominion over sin the
[56:19] World the Flesh and the devil showing
[56:21] forth his praise and glory showing forth
[56:24] himself for it is Christ in us willing
[56:27] and doing of his good pleasure he says
[56:30] yes indeed even now we are seated in
[56:32] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what's
[56:34] he doing he's pointing to Ephesians 1
[56:35] and saying everything that comes against
[56:38] us has already been defeated every
[56:40] weapon's been broken every enemy's been
[56:42] defeated every wall has been torn down
[56:44] and all that's left now is a bluff
[56:46] that's all Satan has left for the
[56:47] believer is a bluff because if we
[56:49] believe the word then everything he's
[56:51] brought against us has already been
[56:53] defeated amen amen
[56:57] it's Christ in us doing these things and
[56:59] we're going to talk about how we can
[57:01] sometimes get our eyes on ourselves
[57:02] instead of him and that's where we fail
[57:04] but it's Christ in us but I want you to
[57:06] see that this whole world is groaning
[57:09] and and and just in labor for us to come
[57:12] into our position that's what the world
[57:15] is looking for and we know that that
[57:17] won't happen in its fullness until the
[57:19] millennial Reign when there will be
[57:21] peace for a thousand years and the lamb
[57:23] and the lion will lay down together and
[57:25] these things but there's a man estation
[57:26] of the sons of God now and there's a
[57:28] groaning now but it's in a spiritual
[57:30] condition and the world is groaning for
[57:32] the manifestation of sons because
[57:34] without the sons then the rest of them
[57:36] can't get their help sons are needed to
[57:38] produce more Sons not that we produce
[57:40] them but we go and we find them amen it
[57:43] starts with one in this church with
[57:44] brother Mark and then it moves to Sister
[57:46] Moren and brother Bob and sister Brendan
[57:48] meanwhile it's brother Gerald over here
[57:50] and what happens is they come together
[57:51] and where the spirit of God is it
[57:53] produces other Sons and Daughters of God
[57:55] so comes to one and it brings to others
[57:57] and so as we're in our workplaces as
[57:59] we're in our school groups and schools
[58:01] and these different things people are
[58:03] crying out and they're needing help and
[58:05] they don't know where it's going to come
[58:06] from and they don't know where to go and
[58:09] they've tried doctors and they've tried
[58:10] Psychiatry and they've tried medication
[58:12] and they've tried drugs and they've
[58:14] tried entertainment and they've tried
[58:16] money and all these things and nothing
[58:17] satisfies and there's a groaning within
[58:20] and it's only going to come sometimes
[58:21] through the Sons and Daughters of God
[58:22] that have found their place and they can
[58:24] say I can help you not by what I give
[58:27] you but where I can take you to the one
[58:29] that I can point you to we know many
[58:31] people and I know in talking with many
[58:33] of us we're talking to people that have
[58:35] great needs and they're searching and
[58:36] they're seeking and some of them are are
[58:38] are professing Christians very faithful
[58:41] and yet they're seeking for something
[58:43] that they don't yet have that's why we
[58:45] need to be steadfast and sure on what we
[58:47] believe to hold fast to have that
[58:50] meekness to have that humility to have
[58:52] that love to have that care for those
[58:54] that are around us because they're
[58:56] groaning trying to find what we've
[58:57] already had to F to get our satisfaction
[58:59] in this life but we've only got one
[59:02] answer and I said it last service in the
[59:04] service before were broken records
[59:05] there's only one remedy come to Christ
[59:07] and let him change you let him change
[59:09] you there's no promise that he would
[59:11] change situations but there's a promise
[59:13] that he'll change me and he'll change
[59:14] you into whatever we need to be to come
[59:16] through it people are crying out for
[59:18] help people have family traditions of
[59:21] failure we know them people that have
[59:24] been bound by by by family fults for
[59:26] generations and they're trying to break
[59:28] it and the only one that can break it is
[59:30] Christ amen people that are bound by
[59:33] addictions people that are bound by
[59:35] situations people that are feeling
[59:36] hopeless no choice whatsoever and the
[59:39] Only Hope they've got is that a son or
[59:40] daughter of God comes their way and says
[59:42] I've got a remedy for you cuz he's he's
[59:45] delivered me from those
[59:47] things brother Braham says what's
[59:49] everything wor waiting on what's the
[59:51] whole creation waiting for the
[59:53] manifestations of the sons of God it's
[59:56] waiting for the church to become into
[59:59] its position who was the son of God Adam
[1:00:02] and where was his domain the Earth he
[1:00:04] had domain over the Earth is that right
[1:00:06] and all the whole creation is waiting
[1:00:09] for the sons of God to be manifested he
[1:00:11] says is that right it's waiting God
[1:00:13] trying to place his church in position
[1:00:16] to manifest himself getting one that he
[1:00:20] can work through it just takes one one
[1:00:23] that he can work through like this
[1:00:24] saying there's my spirit flowing freely
[1:00:28] there it is that I can work he says here
[1:00:31] get another one over here and place them
[1:00:33] I can place him he says it's adoption
[1:00:36] placing manifesting take him out here
[1:00:39] and put a ceremony on him visit him with
[1:00:41] an angel tell him something he says now
[1:00:43] if he's told the truth now if he's just
[1:00:45] making up something that won't work no
[1:00:48] that won't work we've had a lot of that
[1:00:49] but he says I mean the manifestation of
[1:00:51] sons of God when God manifests himself
[1:00:55] and God say him
[1:00:57] out we need to know we've met with
[1:01:00] God you don't have to be a minister to
[1:01:02] meet with God you just need to know that
[1:01:05] he has come to you and revealed himself
[1:01:06] to you personally
[1:01:08] amen he says he sends him out he says
[1:01:12] and when then he goes forth and what he
[1:01:16] says is truth what he does is the truth
[1:01:20] what he does he manifests Christ he says
[1:01:22] and how do you judge him by by the way
[1:01:24] he stays with the word
[1:01:26] right with the word see that's how you
[1:01:29] know all man is by the way he stays with
[1:01:31] the word he says if they speak not
[1:01:33] according to the word there's no light
[1:01:34] in them says the B Bible That's Isaiah
[1:01:37] 8:20 if you're wondering he says leave
[1:01:39] them away what's God trying to do he's
[1:01:41] trying to show himself through surrender
[1:01:44] Believers it's not people that want to
[1:01:47] go do things it's people that are led to
[1:01:50] do things amen the scripture says sons
[1:01:52] of God are led by the spirit of God and
[1:01:54] what we end up doing we take what God
[1:01:56] gives us and we go running with it
[1:01:58] rather than waiting for him to send us
[1:02:00] out brother brah talks about those those
[1:02:02] two preachers that were out there and
[1:02:04] they got all aggressive with a brother
[1:02:05] and trying to convert him to their way
[1:02:06] of believing and brother says those two
[1:02:08] men need to be tied to the snubbing post
[1:02:11] and the snubbing post is what you tie a
[1:02:12] horse to so that it can't pull away and
[1:02:14] it keeps it tight so it can't get into
[1:02:16] trouble remember they said when when
[1:02:19] they finally got the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:21] these these denominational Brothers they
[1:02:22] said to brother Bram do we go seeking
[1:02:24] our gifts now he says no
[1:02:26] stay there just be humble and God will
[1:02:28] give to you what you have need of and
[1:02:29] then he'll send you out don't just run
[1:02:32] out let's wait on God let's see what he
[1:02:33] would have us to do I'm wanting to find
[1:02:35] his will because when I'm in his will he
[1:02:37] backs me up every time CU I'm on his
[1:02:40] path not on my path now that's where I
[1:02:42] have faith that's where I have
[1:02:43] confidence is where I've taken the time
[1:02:45] to meet with him and figure out what he
[1:02:46] wants to do in my
[1:02:47] life but I want to take us back to that
[1:02:50] thought on Dominion that quote we read
[1:02:52] and brother Bram says it's four things
[1:02:54] it's sin the World the Flesh and the
[1:02:56] devil that we have dominion over and I
[1:02:58] want to start with dominion over sin
[1:02:59] tonight you know and we want to turn sin
[1:03:02] into smoking and drinking and partying
[1:03:04] and all these things but we know there's
[1:03:06] only one sin and that's unbelief in the
[1:03:08] Garden of Eden sin was found in Eve
[1:03:11] because she disbelieved the word and
[1:03:13] everything after that was based on her
[1:03:15] disbelief her lack of belief in the word
[1:03:17] she got out from under that she acted on
[1:03:19] her unbelief and that brought forth the
[1:03:21] fruits of sin anden It produced the it
[1:03:24] brought a product of sin in our lives in
[1:03:26] our lives but we are not to be like Eve
[1:03:29] we're not supposed to fall that way
[1:03:30] we're supposed to stay true to the word
[1:03:33] but I want you to see here and I don't
[1:03:35] want to preach you know it can be my
[1:03:37] nature sometimes to preach these things
[1:03:39] as law but I want to preach them to you
[1:03:41] tonight as promises amen when I go into
[1:03:43] the word and and especially under a
[1:03:45] Grace Covenant I don't look at this as
[1:03:47] law I look at it as promises if there's
[1:03:49] a requirement the requirement is a
[1:03:51] promise that he'll help me to live the
[1:03:53] way he wants me to live not you must do
[1:03:55] or you must do or or else or else or
[1:03:58] else but rather if he requires it then
[1:04:00] he's got the power to make me live it
[1:04:02] the way he wants me to amen so let's
[1:04:04] listen as promises tonight I don't want
[1:04:05] to put any pressure on you but I want
[1:04:07] you to see the promises of God and I
[1:04:10] love the Books of John you know John was
[1:04:12] the one that was close to Jesus he was
[1:04:14] he was the one that laid on his on his
[1:04:16] chest and these things and we see there
[1:04:17] that John has a wonderful revelation of
[1:04:19] what the love of God does and I think
[1:04:21] it's a great place for the believer to
[1:04:23] be resting tonight he says whosoever
[1:04:25] abideth in him sinth
[1:04:28] not Hallelujah if I'm in Christ then
[1:04:31] there's no sin found in me he says
[1:04:33] whosoever sinth had not seen him neither
[1:04:35] known him little children let no man
[1:04:38] deceive you he that doeth righteousness
[1:04:40] is righteous even as he is righteous and
[1:04:43] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[1:04:45] for the devil sinth from the
[1:04:48] beginning that means that those that Sin
[1:04:50] Sin from the beginning as well because
[1:04:51] they're of the same Source he says for
[1:04:54] this purpose now the Son of God was
[1:04:56] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:04:59] works of the devil so we had an original
[1:05:03] manifestation 2,000 years ago but now
[1:05:05] it's Christ being manifested again and
[1:05:07] what's the purpose of the second
[1:05:08] manifestation to destroy the works of
[1:05:10] the devil in you and
[1:05:12] I he says now catch this this is our
[1:05:15] promise whosoever is born of God does
[1:05:19] not commit
[1:05:21] sin he says for his seed remaineth in
[1:05:24] him and he cannot sin because he is born
[1:05:27] of God and if you're not born of God
[1:05:29] it's like the scripture we read earlier
[1:05:31] he that committed sin is of the devil
[1:05:32] why because the seed of the devil is in
[1:05:34] him and it remains in him but I want to
[1:05:37] stop here and dwell on this because
[1:05:38] we're talking about dominion over sin
[1:05:40] and John says right here that he who is
[1:05:43] born of God does not commit sin John
[1:05:46] says it's impossible to commit sin but
[1:05:48] if I were to start from the oldest to
[1:05:51] the youngest tonight and walk down the
[1:05:53] the pews and say brother so and so did
[1:05:55] did you sin today did you think a wrong
[1:05:57] thought did you have a wrong attitude
[1:06:00] did you do something out of self-will
[1:06:02] instead of God's will did you do
[1:06:04] something in your own interest instead
[1:06:05] of your brothers and sisters each one of
[1:06:07] us would slowly have to raise our hand
[1:06:09] and say
[1:06:11] yes and the devil will point at us and
[1:06:14] he'll say gotcha John 1 John 3:9 says
[1:06:18] that whoever sins is is is of the devil
[1:06:21] and whosoever is born of God doesn't sin
[1:06:23] and you just sinned is what he'll say
[1:06:26] but the word of God can't lie church
[1:06:28] amen the word of God can't lie and if we
[1:06:30] are born again of him then the scripture
[1:06:33] says we cannot sin but yet we have this
[1:06:35] this now our reality is bumping up
[1:06:38] against the word and which one's right
[1:06:40] well what's right is the word and what's
[1:06:42] wrong is our understanding and Satan is
[1:06:44] always wrong because he's a liar amen so
[1:06:47] when he comes against you and says
[1:06:48] you've sinned therefore you're not a
[1:06:49] child of God you point him back to this
[1:06:51] scripture and then listen to these
[1:06:52] quotes that I'm about to read to you
[1:06:54] tonight he says who was the sin offering
[1:06:57] Jesus Christ who died for us Christ what
[1:07:01] did he die for our sins he took my
[1:07:04] punishment is that right and then how do
[1:07:06] I get into him by one Spirit we are all
[1:07:09] baptized into one body and when in this
[1:07:12] body we're covered by the blood and free
[1:07:15] from the judgments that's step one he
[1:07:18] who The Sinner cannot sin why because
[1:07:22] there's a blood sacrifice laying for him
[1:07:25] da and night he says hallelujah he can't
[1:07:27] sin he has no desire to sin if he does
[1:07:31] do something wrong he don't mean to do
[1:07:33] it amen I say praise the Lord then
[1:07:36] brother Ram takes us to the scriptures
[1:07:38] he says the Bible says in Hebrews the
[1:07:40] 10th chapter for if we sin willfully
[1:07:43] after we've received the knowledge of
[1:07:45] the truth he says and he is the truth
[1:07:47] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:07:49] sin he that despised moses' law died
[1:07:51] under two or three Witnesses how much
[1:07:53] more sore punishment supposed so worthy
[1:07:56] those who TRS who's trod the blood of
[1:07:59] Jesus Christ under his feet and counted
[1:08:01] the blood of the Covenant wherewith he
[1:08:02] was Sanctified with an Unholy thing and
[1:08:04] done despite to the works of Grace he
[1:08:06] says how can he says if they were judged
[1:08:08] under the law of Moses and now you
[1:08:10] knowing all things and You' been under
[1:08:12] the blood come and do that again he says
[1:08:14] you've Rec crucified him he says you
[1:08:15] made him out worse than he was he says
[1:08:18] it can't be
[1:08:19] done but we're at this disconnect then
[1:08:22] because we
[1:08:23] make what we would call we do sin every
[1:08:26] day that's the way we would look at it
[1:08:27] isn't it in our human mind we would say
[1:08:29] we sin but brother Adams he's refuting
[1:08:32] this and he's showing us the meaning of
[1:08:34] 1 John 3 he says for by one Spirit we
[1:08:37] are all baptized into one body and we
[1:08:39] are free from sin and we cannot sin what
[1:08:41] he's saying is if you're in Christ
[1:08:43] there's no sin in that
[1:08:44] body so no matter what you think about
[1:08:47] it it cannot be there he says there is
[1:08:50] an atonement waiting for us now catch
[1:08:53] this he says if there's still desire in
[1:08:55] your heart to sin you have never been
[1:08:57] baptized into that body because you are
[1:09:00] dead and your life is hid in Christ
[1:09:02] through God and sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:05] that's a checkup
[1:09:07] quote do I have what I really say I
[1:09:10] have but catch this he says Christians
[1:09:13] don't sin what do they do brother bradam
[1:09:17] they make mistakes but they don't sin
[1:09:21] amen he says that's the reason they
[1:09:22] don't for he cannot sin he says' if I go
[1:09:26] down through the city here and the mayor
[1:09:28] of the city says Mr Brandon I know that
[1:09:30] you make sick calls there are speed
[1:09:32] limits the highest speed limit in the
[1:09:34] city is about 30 m an hour but I'm
[1:09:36] giving you permission to run 90 if you
[1:09:38] want to cuz I have faith in you that you
[1:09:40] wouldn't do it unless you had emergency
[1:09:42] call or somebody dying Yonder in a wreck
[1:09:45] he says I'll give you permission as the
[1:09:46] mayor of this city that you can run any
[1:09:48] red light do whatever you want to just
[1:09:52] go right on now catch what he says here
[1:09:54] he says how could a little two- bit
[1:09:56] officer ever arrest here arrest me out
[1:09:58] here making 40 mph in a 30 m Zone he
[1:10:02] says he can't I can't break any speed
[1:10:05] laws in this city because why he says
[1:10:08] I'm above the speed laws he says amen I
[1:10:12] hope you see it now I'm going to I'm
[1:10:13] going to explain this in a minute
[1:10:14] because that sounds like we can do
[1:10:16] anything we want we can do anything we
[1:10:19] want but with the Holy Ghost it'll be
[1:10:21] the right thing every time but he says
[1:10:24] and when we are are dead he's saying
[1:10:26] what does this look like now in our
[1:10:27] lives what's this Above the Law look
[1:10:28] like he says when we are dead God has
[1:10:31] recognized our repentance he's
[1:10:33] recognized our baptism he's recognized
[1:10:35] the blood of his own son which by faith
[1:10:37] has been applied he recognizes his for
[1:10:39] ordination and he knew that I do it and
[1:10:42] has recognized me in Christ dead he says
[1:10:45] and Christ died in my place when he was
[1:10:47] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:10:49] my name was put on his book as a
[1:10:51] Christian Hallelujah he says Christ died
[1:10:54] my death Christ is my sacrifice and God
[1:10:58] could not impute to me sin anymore he's
[1:11:00] given me the Seal of the Holy Ghost as a
[1:11:02] witness that I passed from Death unto
[1:11:04] life he says phw that does it I've been
[1:11:07] talking about the Holy Ghost and we
[1:11:09] can't escape this fact that that's what
[1:11:11] makes the difference it's the holy ghost
[1:11:13] or nothing it's the holy ghost or
[1:11:16] nothing but what is he saying here he
[1:11:18] says are we he says we are above the law
[1:11:20] is that what he's saying are we Above
[1:11:21] the
[1:11:23] Law I won't ask you to ask but I want
[1:11:25] you to answer answer it but answer it in
[1:11:27] your own mind are we Above the Law
[1:11:30] tonight he said we were but what does
[1:11:34] that really mean what we're Above the
[1:11:36] Law because we're no longer under the
[1:11:38] law we're under a Grace Covenant amen
[1:11:41] that's what it means Christ fulfilled
[1:11:42] the law at Calvary and now we have his
[1:11:45] righteousness attributed to us we've got
[1:11:47] a blood that covers over any mistakes we
[1:11:49] make and we've got the holy spirit in us
[1:11:51] in a sign to prove that God has accepted
[1:11:54] us God's not dealing with us under the
[1:11:57] law that's not where we are there the
[1:12:00] holy spirit's our proof our token it's
[1:12:02] our ticket to speed if you want to put
[1:12:04] it that way that Satan Can't Hold Us
[1:12:06] bound to something that Christ has
[1:12:07] already fulfilled cuz that's what the
[1:12:10] law is it is something that had to be
[1:12:12] fulfilled and once it's fulfilled the
[1:12:14] law is broken the law is broken it never
[1:12:17] applied as soon as Christ died then the
[1:12:18] law was broken and we came under a Grace
[1:12:21] Covenant so Satan can't now pull out the
[1:12:23] law and say you're lost because you
[1:12:24] broke this law we look at that and say
[1:12:26] Christ fulfilled that that law doesn't
[1:12:28] even exist on the books anymore I'm
[1:12:30] under a blood Grace Covenant now and
[1:12:33] here's my
[1:12:34] token and he's got to let us go the law
[1:12:37] doesn't have any ability to enforce on
[1:12:39] us because we're under grace now we can
[1:12:42] do whatever we want but you turn it into
[1:12:45] disgrace and it proves that you never
[1:12:46] came out in the first place we don't
[1:12:48] abuse these things notice what the
[1:12:50] scripture says the scripture says the
[1:12:52] wages of sin is death
[1:12:56] but we have Christ Living on the inside
[1:12:57] we have eternal life on the inside so we
[1:12:59] can't be living under sin which is the
[1:13:01] law and under eternal life at the same
[1:13:04] time brother Bram saying the Holy Ghost
[1:13:06] is the seal to prove that you pass from
[1:13:08] Death un life that you pass from law
[1:13:10] into Grace and so the law doesn't apply
[1:13:12] to us anymore what we became his
[1:13:14] Perfection and we cannot sin it can't be
[1:13:17] attributed to us because there's no sin
[1:13:19] in his righteousness there's no sin in
[1:13:21] him at all it's all given to us amen but
[1:13:24] like I said in the last service I don't
[1:13:26] listen to rock and roll anymore I don't
[1:13:28] listen to country music I don't go hang
[1:13:30] out with certain types of friends I
[1:13:31] don't watch things or read things of a
[1:13:33] certain nature why because those desires
[1:13:36] have been T out taken out I can say that
[1:13:38] genuinely tonight young people if you
[1:13:40] got those desires I'm telling you they
[1:13:42] can be taken away you know how I know
[1:13:45] because I used to love those things I
[1:13:47] used to do those things I used to be
[1:13:48] bound by some of those things I've
[1:13:50] talked about it I make no bones about
[1:13:52] the things that Satan had in my life but
[1:13:55] they're not there anymore but I don't
[1:13:57] feed the flesh because the flesh will
[1:13:59] love that every time you know brother B
[1:14:00] talk about rock and roll he says you put
[1:14:02] rock and roll in front of a baby and
[1:14:03] what do they do they start moving around
[1:14:06] don't they they love it because the
[1:14:07] flesh loves those
[1:14:11] things you put anything of Satan's in
[1:14:14] front of you this flesh will start
[1:14:15] loving it if you give it enough
[1:14:17] time right the black dog starts to
[1:14:19] overcome the white dog in your life and
[1:14:21] you'll start to get those things in
[1:14:22] there so if we're longing for the world
[1:14:24] on a daily basis it's for two reasons
[1:14:26] one of two reasons one we've never
[1:14:28] gotten the holy ghost or two we're
[1:14:30] feeding this flesh and that's causing us
[1:14:31] to think and dwell on those things that
[1:14:33] we ought not to do it's the only two
[1:14:34] ways because if you've been born again
[1:14:37] those desires have been taken out and so
[1:14:38] all it is is you've lost a battle with
[1:14:39] your flesh and the flesh is rising up
[1:14:41] and the only way the flesh Rises up and
[1:14:43] has Dominion is when we feed it that's
[1:14:45] it it's it I mean I've learned that a
[1:14:48] long time ago if I feed my flesh the
[1:14:49] flesh starts winning if I feed my soul
[1:14:52] then the Soul keeps winning and it's
[1:14:53] that simple every day amen but as
[1:14:56] Believers we can't disbelieve this word
[1:14:59] that's why we're called Believers is
[1:15:00] because we believe it sin can't reign in
[1:15:02] us we're built to believe we're built to
[1:15:04] accept it now we can look at our lives
[1:15:06] and I look at my own life and we can say
[1:15:08] but I only believe it so far today
[1:15:11] you'll believe it as much as you need to
[1:15:12] to make it through the next portal
[1:15:13] through the next gate through the next
[1:15:14] stage of your life God will raise up the
[1:15:17] faith to meet the challenge so often
[1:15:20] what we're looking for is the challenge
[1:15:21] for tomorrow while we're walking in
[1:15:23] today we need to just be where God
[1:15:25] places us and say Lord you've given me
[1:15:27] cuz what sufficient to the day is the
[1:15:29] evil thereof the test thereof we'll have
[1:15:31] the faith we need when we get there
[1:15:33] church we can sit there and you know
[1:15:35] I've talked with people recently about
[1:15:37] certain situations and I said I don't
[1:15:39] know that I have faith for that but I
[1:15:41] believe if God calls me to that
[1:15:43] situation I'll have faith when I get
[1:15:45] there amen I don't need to borrow
[1:15:47] trouble I don't need to tear down my
[1:15:49] current experience by a future
[1:15:52] possibility let's just dwell on what
[1:15:53] God's given us let's well on the
[1:15:55] blessings on the calling on the faith
[1:15:57] that he's given us for today amen but
[1:15:59] we're ordained to believe we're ordained
[1:16:01] to overcome we're ordained to make
[1:16:03] Satan's works of n effect in our lives
[1:16:06] that's what we're built for we're built
[1:16:07] for overcoming amen don't worry about
[1:16:10] how long it takes that's the that's the
[1:16:12] human side of us that's the flesh side
[1:16:13] of us amen is that we get caught up in
[1:16:15] time in instead of the word that says
[1:16:18] he'll do it that's the great trial for
[1:16:20] all of us it's a test of our faith is
[1:16:22] the time between the believing and the
[1:16:23] actual occurrence brother BR would talk
[1:16:26] about Sin we're talking about dominion
[1:16:27] over sin brother BR would say he says if
[1:16:29] you want to kill something he says you
[1:16:31] don't start on the limbs or the
[1:16:32] extremities he says you go for the head
[1:16:35] if an animal attacks you if one of us
[1:16:36] was was attacked by an animal or we
[1:16:38] wanted to kill it all you do is you get
[1:16:40] it in the head and that's what kills it
[1:16:42] brother says that's what he did at
[1:16:44] Calvary was he wounded the head and then
[1:16:46] the rest of it falls
[1:16:47] apart I saw a a a clip of a of a
[1:16:52] wildlife photographer and they were out
[1:16:54] walking and they had this Osprey that
[1:16:56] they saw in the water and it was in the
[1:16:58] in the side of a river there and he kept
[1:16:59] struggling and when they got closer they
[1:17:01] saw that he had tried to to catch a
[1:17:04] snake and the snake had coiled itself
[1:17:06] around him so he couldn't fly away and
[1:17:07] the snake was trying to drown him but
[1:17:09] when they got closer what they saw was
[1:17:11] that the snake was was was pierced
[1:17:14] through the head with the Talon not in
[1:17:17] its brain but enough that the snake
[1:17:19] couldn't do anything else except hold on
[1:17:21] and what they did is they had to unwind
[1:17:23] that snake and as soon as they did that
[1:17:24] snake to have wanted nothing to do with
[1:17:26] that Osprey anymore it just wanted to
[1:17:28] get away but it couldn't get away cuz it
[1:17:29] was held by the head I've gone after
[1:17:31] snakes when we were in Texas with with
[1:17:33] the way back when um back when I was
[1:17:36] quite a bit younger and and my cousin
[1:17:38] said hey let's go look for snakes and So
[1:17:39] eventually they caught one and I
[1:17:41] wouldn't catch one but they said you
[1:17:42] want to hold it and so you hold them up
[1:17:43] by the tail because they can only
[1:17:45] support so much weight so as long as you
[1:17:46] keep them out here that head can't get
[1:17:48] you but when they went to kill it they
[1:17:49] didn't cut off the tail they cut off the
[1:17:51] head that's what we need to understand
[1:17:53] is that when Christ cut cut off the head
[1:17:55] when he took the keys of death Hell In
[1:17:57] The Grave everything behind that died as
[1:18:00] well so all of the sickness all of the
[1:18:02] worry all of the stress all of these
[1:18:04] things that Satan's trying to impose on
[1:18:06] US are as dead as the head that Christ
[1:18:08] struck at
[1:18:09] Calvary so when he kills the head then
[1:18:12] none of those other things we have to
[1:18:13] let into our life
[1:18:14] anymore the head's dead the rest of the
[1:18:17] body has to die and rot with it amen we
[1:18:21] talked about dominion over the Flesh and
[1:18:22] I'm not going to you know Paul says that
[1:18:24] I Crucify My Flesh daily it's a daily
[1:18:26] thing and so I don't want to dwell on
[1:18:28] that so much this evening but I want to
[1:18:29] go into this one of he says we have
[1:18:31] dominion over the world and we know that
[1:18:33] the world is a big trap amen it is it is
[1:18:36] designed to trap us into things with a
[1:18:39] false promise of what it can offer and
[1:18:41] then every time it disappoints Us by
[1:18:43] what dangling the carrot just a little
[1:18:44] bit further you've seen that thing where
[1:18:46] they put the carrot on a stick and they
[1:18:47] put it in front of an animal and that
[1:18:49] animal will go wherever that carrot is
[1:18:50] in front of it it can never get the
[1:18:52] carrot and that's what this world is
[1:18:54] it's a carot that we never get it's
[1:18:56] always there this flesh can never be
[1:18:58] satisfied what Satan offers can never
[1:19:00] satisfy us and so we have all these
[1:19:02] things and we want recognition we want a
[1:19:04] career we want money we want stability
[1:19:06] we want a great work life balance
[1:19:08] whatever it is and Satan says I can give
[1:19:10] you that and it's just a carrot that's
[1:19:11] dangling and we never get to fully taste
[1:19:13] the carrot it's not wrong to want those
[1:19:16] things it's not wrong to want peace in
[1:19:18] our life it's not wrong to want
[1:19:19] stability it's not wrong to want to have
[1:19:21] money in the bank account but how we
[1:19:23] seek after it is what's going to
[1:19:24] determine what's really leading us amen
[1:19:27] Christ said seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:19:29] God and all these things will add he'll
[1:19:31] add unto us
[1:19:33] amen otherwise we're going to be seeking
[1:19:35] a satisfaction that we can't get I
[1:19:38] remember now I think it was with purpose
[1:19:40] that this happened but when my wife and
[1:19:42] I we were in Edmonton and we were making
[1:19:43] good money and and we had no real debt
[1:19:46] and and and just everything was good we
[1:19:49] had our health we had finances we had a
[1:19:51] great job I had good career prospects
[1:19:53] and all these different things and we
[1:19:54] kind of just looked at each other and
[1:19:55] said if this is all there is to our our
[1:19:57] walk then this is silly it's pointless
[1:20:01] it's not that we weren't uh uh children
[1:20:03] of God it's not that we didn't have the
[1:20:05] Holy Ghost but these these things of the
[1:20:07] world are not
[1:20:08] satisfying you can have all the money in
[1:20:10] the world you can have no debt you can
[1:20:12] have money left at the end of the month
[1:20:14] you can have great health you can have
[1:20:15] all of these things but there is no
[1:20:17] satisfaction in those things for a child
[1:20:18] of God there not not there I mean
[1:20:22] there's there are those here that have a
[1:20:23] lot and there are those of us that have
[1:20:24] little or less than that but regardless
[1:20:27] I found you know my wife and I were were
[1:20:29] talking about it and when we lived in
[1:20:31] Texas you know I just finished my
[1:20:32] engineering degree I was making $32
[1:20:34] $34,000 a year we were like this much
[1:20:37] money left at the end of the month it
[1:20:38] was so
[1:20:40] tight but you know we found that even in
[1:20:42] those times God was still
[1:20:44] good God was still God he was still
[1:20:47] Jehovah Gyra amen he was still the god
[1:20:50] of our lives and I think sometimes God
[1:20:52] will hold us back a little bit just to
[1:20:53] see if we'll be Fai faithful when we
[1:20:55] don't have much when we'll still be
[1:20:57] faithful in our time in our commitments
[1:20:59] and these different things if we won't
[1:21:01] complain so that he can bless us with
[1:21:03] more because he knows that we appreciate
[1:21:05] what he's done for us
[1:21:07] already Paul says this in Galatians 4
[1:21:10] we're talking about dominion over the
[1:21:12] world he says even so when we were
[1:21:15] children we're in bondage we are slaves
[1:21:19] we are servants we are addicts under the
[1:21:21] elements of the world but when the
[1:21:23] fullness of the time was come God sent
[1:21:25] forth his son made of a woman and made
[1:21:28] under the law to redeem that were under
[1:21:30] the law them that were under the law
[1:21:32] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:21:35] sons he says and because ye are Sons God
[1:21:38] has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:21:40] into your hearts crying Abba Father
[1:21:44] church we need Holy Ghost anointed
[1:21:46] ministers we need Holy Ghost anointed
[1:21:48] parents we need Holy Ghost anointed
[1:21:49] friends and family but you know what we
[1:21:51] need more than that we need to be holy
[1:21:53] ghost anointed and we can surround
[1:21:55] ourselves with those things but until it
[1:21:57] happens to us it does us no good we
[1:22:00] don't get the full benefit of it amen we
[1:22:02] can be surrounded by Victory but until
[1:22:03] we get the victory in our own lives it's
[1:22:05] not going to do us a liqu of good we're
[1:22:07] on the outside looking in and we won't
[1:22:09] have the fruit of the spirit we won't
[1:22:11] have the the peace The Joy the rest the
[1:22:13] victory the love all these things that
[1:22:15] we crave as children of God but he says
[1:22:17] when he sends forth that Spirit when it
[1:22:19] comes into your your heart he says after
[1:22:21] that he says wherefore thou are no more
[1:22:23] a servant you're not bound to what you
[1:22:25] were bound to before it doesn't have any
[1:22:27] hold on you he says but now you're not
[1:22:30] in bondage to the world but you're a son
[1:22:32] you recognize you're a son and if a son
[1:22:34] then you're an heir of God through
[1:22:36] Christ let me tell you we're in leoda
[1:22:39] and leoda is all about what you
[1:22:42] have now it's we know it's a religious
[1:22:44] spirit but there's also a a carnal
[1:22:47] Spirit that's there so there's this the
[1:22:49] the this Spirit of trying to get stuff
[1:22:52] everybody's trying to get ahead every
[1:22:54] everybody's trying to get what the
[1:22:55] person next to them have Envy ambition
[1:22:57] jealousy these different things are
[1:22:59] great Tools in Satan's hands and we love
[1:23:02] stability we love to know that we've got
[1:23:04] enough to make it through the month or
[1:23:06] through the year and these different
[1:23:07] things but it's not just the young
[1:23:09] people that get caught up in that it can
[1:23:11] be us in the middle-aged side of things
[1:23:13] where we're trying to get more and
[1:23:14] trying to come to that stability rather
[1:23:16] than walking by faith day by day amen
[1:23:19] the Walk of a Christian is a walk of
[1:23:21] Faith always because he can take it at
[1:23:23] the drop of a hat and what are we going
[1:23:24] to do then our faith cannot be in our
[1:23:26] bank account balance it cannot be in the
[1:23:29] security of our job I had such a great
[1:23:31] job in Alberta I thought I was
[1:23:33] intouchable we had done tremendous
[1:23:34] things to grow the bottom line we had
[1:23:36] grown the business hugely we had great
[1:23:38] success we had a great model that was
[1:23:40] working really well and then in a drop
[1:23:42] of a hat some idiot made a decision that
[1:23:43] they could manage everything from 12 and
[1:23:45] 1 half hours away over in Australia and
[1:23:47] laid off a bunch of managers and in a
[1:23:49] moment like that for the sake of saving
[1:23:51] a few salaries they destroyed all the
[1:23:53] work we did and it took them s years to
[1:23:56] realize the mistake they made but what
[1:23:58] was it doing God was getting me out of
[1:24:00] my comfort zone to where I would now
[1:24:03] step into what I needed to be and do
[1:24:05] which was Ministry not to become a
[1:24:07] president or a CEO or a VP or these
[1:24:09] different things but to get me focused
[1:24:11] on where I needed to be so my hope then
[1:24:13] could not be in my bank account in my
[1:24:15] career prospects in my education in my
[1:24:17] experience My Hope had to be that I'm a
[1:24:19] child of God and God is leading me and
[1:24:21] he'll provide for me no matter what in
[1:24:23] the good times and in The Bad Times amen
[1:24:26] it's all a part of the Walk that we
[1:24:31] have you know when we get
[1:24:34] comfortable that's when Satan tends to
[1:24:36] slide
[1:24:37] in because comfort means we don't need
[1:24:40] God we need him but in our mind we'll
[1:24:43] say what do I need God for and what
[1:24:45] happens is our devotions cool off Church
[1:24:47] attendance cools
[1:24:49] off that fire inside burns down and we
[1:24:52] get cold we get cold when we're
[1:24:55] comfortable the leans we're comfortable
[1:24:58] people we're living in an age that seeks
[1:25:02] comfort and we've got churches that are
[1:25:04] full of comfortable
[1:25:06] Christians God help us if we only preach
[1:25:08] what will Comfort amen there's some
[1:25:10] there's certainly some checkups this
[1:25:12] evening that we're going to get
[1:25:13] into but Peter would say this he says be
[1:25:17] sober be
[1:25:20] vigilant take things seriously and
[1:25:23] always be looking around
[1:25:25] ground he says why because your
[1:25:27] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[1:25:30] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[1:25:34] now you say I'm still coming to church
[1:25:36] I'm still paying my ties I'm still
[1:25:38] faithful but is he devouring your time
[1:25:40] is he devouring your energy is he
[1:25:43] devouring your
[1:25:45] fellowship see we can we can be in here
[1:25:47] and do our forms and our habits of
[1:25:49] Christianity but if we aren't living an
[1:25:51] overcoming life then he's devoured
[1:25:53] something that belongs to us
[1:25:56] you know we he says here he's as a
[1:25:57] roaring lion walking around and we think
[1:25:59] well it's going to be obvious if it's a
[1:26:01] roaring lion if he Roars over there I'm
[1:26:02] going to go over there but you notice
[1:26:05] when a lion roars it's not
[1:26:07] because the Lions you're looking out for
[1:26:10] or where he is see we run away from the
[1:26:12] Roaring line and you know what happens
[1:26:14] we run right into the lions that are
[1:26:15] waiting in Ambush that's the way the
[1:26:17] Lions Hunt is they have some sitting
[1:26:19] quietly and some that are moving you
[1:26:21] towards the thing that you don't even
[1:26:22] know is there it's the Lions we don't
[1:26:24] hear that are going to get us but it's
[1:26:26] the fear of the one that we can hear
[1:26:28] that runs us right into the thing that
[1:26:29] we don't see many times Satan's subtle
[1:26:32] that's what I'm trying to get to is when
[1:26:34] you see the big things you run from it
[1:26:37] and then you forget the little things
[1:26:38] Satan's
[1:26:40] religious he has to be because he's
[1:26:42] sitting literally in the Churches of God
[1:26:45] being worshiped as God the scripture
[1:26:46] says he's subtle and he's religious he
[1:26:49] didn't get Eve by coming up to her and
[1:26:51] he's not going to come into our lives
[1:26:52] and say hey how you doing I'm Satan I've
[1:26:54] got something that's going to make your
[1:26:55] life miserable today he does not
[1:26:58] identify himself the scripture says that
[1:27:00] they come as angels of light that's how
[1:27:02] subtle he is that's how religious he is
[1:27:05] so Satan comes in and it's very subtle
[1:27:07] we've got to be vigilant we've got to be
[1:27:09] sober we've got to be careful we've got
[1:27:10] to be always on guard because he's
[1:27:13] trying to get in all day every day Satan
[1:27:17] doesn't take breaks he's always trying
[1:27:18] to get in at us but B would say this he
[1:27:21] says but to see the deceitfulness of the
[1:27:23] enemy we've never had a day like this
[1:27:25] we're now Living Church that means
[1:27:27] listen
[1:27:28] up no day has been like what we're
[1:27:31] living in today he says it is the most
[1:27:33] cunning deceitful day he says and when I
[1:27:37] see that it brings this that the
[1:27:39] Christian has to be more on his toes
[1:27:41] today than he ever was in any
[1:27:46] age we're supposed to overcome the
[1:27:49] world to do that we've got to see that
[1:27:52] it's going to be the subtle things it's
[1:27:54] the small foxes that spoil spoil a grape
[1:27:56] vine it's the little things that he
[1:27:58] brings in that slowly erode our
[1:28:00] Christian experience and bring us to a
[1:28:02] place where we're cold and formal and we
[1:28:04] don't even know how we got there Jesus
[1:28:06] would say this he's talking about the
[1:28:08] parable of the S he says and some fell
[1:28:11] among thorns and the Thorns grew up and
[1:28:13] choked it and yielded no fruit see Jesus
[1:28:16] said that your fruit would remain was
[1:28:18] his purpose he says but this it only got
[1:28:21] up so far but it didn't come all the way
[1:28:23] to yielding fruit
[1:28:24] and then they go and they ask him they
[1:28:26] say what does this mean and in verse 18
[1:28:28] He says and these are they which are
[1:28:29] sown among Thorns such as hear the word
[1:28:33] and the cares of this world and the
[1:28:35] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[1:28:38] other things entering in choke the word
[1:28:41] and it becometh unfruitful notice what
[1:28:43] he says here the first thing that gets
[1:28:45] him is the cares of this
[1:28:47] world remember what I said last service
[1:28:49] I said when we say we don't have a
[1:28:51] choice what it means is we've already
[1:28:52] made a choice and something has dominion
[1:28:55] and our choice determines what that
[1:28:57] Dominion is we always have a choice and
[1:28:59] the choice is the word of God or
[1:29:01] everything else and if it's not
[1:29:03] according to the word of God we can wrap
[1:29:04] it up in a skin of religious whatever
[1:29:07] but if it doesn't match the word of God
[1:29:08] it's just Satan being subtle again amen
[1:29:12] we can't serve God in man we can't serve
[1:29:15] God in money we can't serve God in
[1:29:17] career we can't serve God in
[1:29:20] education we can't serve God in family
[1:29:23] we serve God and everything else comes
[1:29:25] beneath that that's the only way it
[1:29:26] works but I was looking up this word
[1:29:28] before we go into the cares of this
[1:29:30] world that word world is not the one we
[1:29:34] typically think of which is Cosmos it
[1:29:36] says but the cares of this
[1:29:39] age this is literally a leody Dean
[1:29:41] scripture for us the cares of this age
[1:29:44] in other words the challenge of the age
[1:29:46] the problem of the age the anxieties the
[1:29:49] stresses the issues overcome the people
[1:29:51] and what happens is it overcomes them by
[1:29:53] their five senses and it completely
[1:29:55] pushes the word
[1:29:56] away but notice it doesn't say that the
[1:29:59] hearing of the word is the
[1:30:01] problem these people have a witness of
[1:30:03] the
[1:30:04] word these are people sitting in
[1:30:06] churches where the preaching of the
[1:30:08] world of the word is so don't put it on
[1:30:11] denominations tonight this is people
[1:30:13] that are hearing the full
[1:30:16] word but he says what happens is the
[1:30:19] cares of this world Amen and it chokes
[1:30:23] the word
[1:30:24] it takes the life out of
[1:30:27] them it takes the effect of the word out
[1:30:32] of them it takes the life of the word
[1:30:34] out of them cuz the life was there to
[1:30:36] start but it chokes it out and they
[1:30:38] can't produce the fruit of the spirit
[1:30:41] they don't go all the way they come so
[1:30:43] far and then what happens is things take
[1:30:45] over and you see what's taking over
[1:30:47] people today we've got high taxes We've
[1:30:49] Got High Cost of Living cares of this
[1:30:52] world right climate
[1:30:54] change social media social justice
[1:30:57] issues we've got all these things we're
[1:31:00] just half of us are just struggling to
[1:31:01] make ends meat and it's so consuming and
[1:31:05] people are so wrapped up in it that they
[1:31:07] forget that there's a God that provides
[1:31:09] our every need and so we make
[1:31:11] [Applause]
[1:31:12] choices based on the cares of this world
[1:31:16] rather than the kingdom of heaven and
[1:31:17] what does it do it chokes out the effect
[1:31:20] of the word in our
[1:31:22] lives what happens is we get cold that's
[1:31:25] all we get cold we get formal we still
[1:31:29] come to church we still pay our ties but
[1:31:32] we know that in our lives there's not
[1:31:33] the same thing that used to be there
[1:31:36] anymore it's Satan that's come in and
[1:31:40] just slowly eroded what we
[1:31:42] had brother Braham says this check up
[1:31:45] moment number one he says now we find
[1:31:48] there's trouble what's the matter he
[1:31:50] says something's taking place the ship
[1:31:52] is rocking the wind is blowing
[1:31:54] Satan is buffeting the ship blow after
[1:31:56] blow wave after wave Satan remember the
[1:31:59] scripture says when the enemy comes in
[1:32:01] like a what a flood Relentless isn't it
[1:32:05] sometimes it is Relentless he won't let
[1:32:08] us rest that's when we've got to be
[1:32:12] careful because we can make up an excuse
[1:32:15] for why we're not doing the things we
[1:32:16] ought to do too busy don't have time to
[1:32:19] slow down don't have time for this got
[1:32:21] to do that no no no no
[1:32:24] he says and all hopes is gone to have
[1:32:28] another Revival testimonies are dying
[1:32:30] out they'd rather stay home and see
[1:32:32] television see no more Wednesday night
[1:32:34] testimony meetings and Things No More
[1:32:36] prayer meetings see the ores are broke
[1:32:38] the mass fell and the helm all's gone
[1:32:40] the winds have knocked all the sails
[1:32:42] down he says and the cares of this world
[1:32:44] will soon knock all the testimony out of
[1:32:46] you
[1:32:47] too he says you feel ashamed to get up
[1:32:52] why he says you know you know what
[1:32:54] you're living He says you know you're
[1:32:57] not living up to that he says and then I
[1:32:59] tell you what we need is a
[1:33:04] Revival never let where you're at stop
[1:33:07] you from coming to
[1:33:12] him sometimes we just get cold church
[1:33:16] but the thing is say how did I get here
[1:33:20] and if we look in sincerity I believe in
[1:33:22] the word and we go in prayer before God
[1:33:24] God will point us right to where we
[1:33:25] walked away from where he wanted us to
[1:33:27] be I've seen it in my life many times
[1:33:30] and he's always waiting right where you
[1:33:32] left him he's faithful he's like the
[1:33:34] it's like the prodical son he's waiting
[1:33:36] to see you a far off if you're coming
[1:33:38] back to him and he'll meet you he'll
[1:33:40] meet you but we've got to say Lord I've
[1:33:42] grown cold Lord I've fallen away Lord
[1:33:45] I've lost some
[1:33:47] steps I've lost some possession in this
[1:33:50] land brother BR would say this he says
[1:33:52] the great Royal seed of ab Abraham his
[1:33:54] spirit is here tonight his promises are
[1:33:57] all true he fulfills everything that he
[1:34:01] said but then he ask this question why
[1:34:04] is it that some setting will be healed
[1:34:06] and others will fail it's a good
[1:34:10] question he says just because that you
[1:34:12] try to keep a little bit of the world
[1:34:15] around
[1:34:16] you a little bit just a little bit he
[1:34:20] says turn loose everything
[1:34:24] then what do you do be simple and look
[1:34:27] to God and believe it with all your
[1:34:29] heart hold on to it he says it's got to
[1:34:32] come to pass God promised it there's
[1:34:34] nothing can keep it brother B remember
[1:34:36] coming through the prayer line if people
[1:34:38] had something in their lives the Holy
[1:34:39] Ghost would call it out and he'd call
[1:34:41] him aside and he'd say you got to make
[1:34:42] something right you got to change this
[1:34:44] you got to do this you can't come
[1:34:45] through until this is finished till this
[1:34:47] is fixed and they go make that right or
[1:34:50] he'd say will you do
[1:34:51] it and they'd say yes and then he pray
[1:34:53] and they would almost always get healed
[1:34:56] but sometimes the things that's holding
[1:34:57] us back is things we're holding on to
[1:35:00] and we've got to let go of that we've
[1:35:01] got to lay it aside so that Christ can
[1:35:02] come in and do something deceitfulness
[1:35:05] of the cares of this world but then he
[1:35:07] says the deceitfulness of riches and
[1:35:09] that's the layout of see and curse I've
[1:35:11] got everything I need therefore I am
[1:35:15] blessed that's not proof of the
[1:35:17] blessings of God the fact that I've got
[1:35:19] a bank account full of money that I've
[1:35:20] got a nice house I've got a nice car
[1:35:22] I've got a good job I've got a good
[1:35:24] family that is not proof of the
[1:35:25] blessings of God because what the layer
[1:35:28] to Sea and age is the greatest that is
[1:35:30] self- deceived it's a self- deceiving
[1:35:32] age we've got to line ourselves up with
[1:35:34] the word not just look at our lives and
[1:35:36] say I've got everything I need listen
[1:35:38] there's people out in this world have
[1:35:39] more than we do and they don't have
[1:35:41] anything of God so why would we say that
[1:35:43] because we have it we're we're in a
[1:35:45] perfect place that's not it brother Bram
[1:35:48] says it's not the sunny skies that are
[1:35:49] proof of his Blessing nor the Cloudy
[1:35:51] Skies proof of his disapproval Life Is
[1:35:54] Life and he brings things our way as we
[1:35:55] need it amen but these worldly riches
[1:35:58] aren't Christianity I've been broke and
[1:36:00] I've been well off and through it all
[1:36:01] God was good and we saw the working hand
[1:36:04] of God and the provision of God in many
[1:36:06] times and I've told the testimony of
[1:36:07] coming to church and we needed $90 to
[1:36:10] make our payment for our insurance and
[1:36:12] we've been away and and uh and there was
[1:36:15] nothing coming in it was a Sunday
[1:36:16] nothing nothing hits the bank on on
[1:36:18] Sundays on the weekend and we needed $1
[1:36:20] and something dollars $90 or something
[1:36:22] like that and we pray about before
[1:36:24] service and then when we came out
[1:36:25] brother Bob handed me an envelope and
[1:36:26] said this came for you in the mail cuz
[1:36:28] they were holding our mail while we were
[1:36:29] away in Halifax and we opened it up and
[1:36:30] there was a check for hundred and
[1:36:32] something dollars so we had enough to
[1:36:33] pay our insurance bill we deposited that
[1:36:35] afternoon went into the bank so we
[1:36:36] didn't have an overdraft which is a huge
[1:36:38] deal when you're a student and we had
[1:36:39] enough to go to Mary Browns and buy N9
[1:36:41] for
[1:36:41] $9.99 which you'd never do today that
[1:36:43] would be $34 I
[1:36:45] think what he knows what he's doing and
[1:36:49] listen Church whether he's providing the
[1:36:51] $107 that we needed or he's providing in
[1:36:53] the $50,000 you need for whatever it is
[1:36:55] brother
[1:36:56] Chad he's a God of all
[1:36:59] situations I'll tell you what we learned
[1:37:01] then we were
[1:37:03] desperate we're poor students we can't
[1:37:05] afford the 40 bucks that they charge you
[1:37:07] every time that you go into overdraft
[1:37:09] we'd already had that happen to us and
[1:37:12] God had already known seen and provided
[1:37:14] the
[1:37:16] answer that's it sometimes the greatest
[1:37:19] things that happen in our life is when
[1:37:20] we have so
[1:37:21] little cuz we see what happens when we
[1:37:24] trust God cuz we know we can't do it on
[1:37:26] our own but that's the secret whether we
[1:37:28] have more or whether we have less is
[1:37:30] that it's all him no matter what and
[1:37:32] we'll see as we get into this that's one
[1:37:33] of the things that Satan tries to hold
[1:37:35] us back with is we look at ourselves
[1:37:37] instead of looking to
[1:37:39] him amen but we've got a promise we've
[1:37:43] got a promise that these things won't
[1:37:44] hold us back we've got a promise that
[1:37:46] we've got dominion over the world and
[1:37:48] the things of the world and we come back
[1:37:49] to First John again he says ye are of
[1:37:51] God little children and have over come
[1:37:54] them have it's a finished
[1:37:57] work listen when he wrote in Revelations
[1:37:59] 3 to him that overcometh I'll Grant to
[1:38:01] sit on my throne for the latest in
[1:38:03] church age that was in recognition that
[1:38:05] there are going to be
[1:38:07] Overcomers we're written right into the
[1:38:09] Bible there he says ye are of God little
[1:38:11] children and have past tense overcome
[1:38:13] them who the Antichrist Spirit Satan's
[1:38:16] working in this age he says why because
[1:38:20] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:38:23] that is in the
[1:38:25] world Listen the victory I have cannot
[1:38:28] be greater as he that is in brother Mark
[1:38:30] or greater than he that's in Sister
[1:38:31] Lydia or greater than he that's in
[1:38:33] brother Dale or sister uh Kimberly it's
[1:38:36] got to be greater as he that's in John
[1:38:38] klet I've got to see it that way I can't
[1:38:40] see it as in somebody else I've got to
[1:38:42] see that he's in me otherwise I'm going
[1:38:44] to lose the victory every time brother
[1:38:46] says this a very familiar quote I know
[1:38:48] but it Bears repeating overcome means to
[1:38:51] recognize the devil in every one of his
[1:38:53] tricks what be sober be
[1:38:55] vigilant be on the
[1:38:57] lookout he says a lot of people says
[1:39:00] there's no devil it's just a thought he
[1:39:02] says don't you believe that there's a
[1:39:03] real devil he's just as real as you are
[1:39:06] or anybody a real devil and you must
[1:39:08] recognize him real you must know he's a
[1:39:11] devil but don't just say I've got an an
[1:39:14] adversary I've got somebody that's
[1:39:16] fighting me I've got an enemy I've got
[1:39:18] something that's holding me back that's
[1:39:21] trying to hold me back he says then the
[1:39:23] same time that you recognize him and
[1:39:24] know that he's a devil and he's against
[1:39:26] you that doesn't give you overcoming
[1:39:28] power that's
[1:39:30] discernment but you got to have more
[1:39:32] than
[1:39:34] discernment I can tell when somebody's
[1:39:36] shooting at me but that doesn't help me
[1:39:38] keep them from hitting me it doesn't
[1:39:40] keep me safe to know somebody shooting
[1:39:41] at me he says he says and when you
[1:39:44] recognize him know he's a devil and he's
[1:39:46] against you then to overcome this is
[1:39:48] what's our part he says You must
[1:39:50] recognize that the god in you is greater
[1:39:53] and mightier than he is that the one
[1:39:56] that's in you has already overcome him
[1:39:59] he says and by his what
[1:40:03] Grace by his grace you are more than a
[1:40:07] match for him he says amen that's real
[1:40:09] overcoming when you
[1:40:11] recognize see sometimes that takes a
[1:40:14] while remember we read that quote
[1:40:15] brother B says it takes sometimes it
[1:40:17] takes a Son of God a while a while to
[1:40:19] realize he's a Son of God sometimes it
[1:40:21] takes us a while to realize that greater
[1:40:23] is he that's in me than he that's in the
[1:40:24] world but we got to remember it's in me
[1:40:27] it's god in me that's doing this work
[1:40:29] it's not me that's doing it that's why
[1:40:31] we have to feed our faith daily and
[1:40:34] crucify the flesh
[1:40:36] daily it's two sides of the same coin
[1:40:39] I'm putting one down and I'm building up
[1:40:40] the other so that there's no room for
[1:40:42] Satan to come in amen that's why we stay
[1:40:45] close to God every day is because we've
[1:40:48] got to recognize there's something going
[1:40:50] on in me there's someone living through
[1:40:52] this life that I've got so that when the
[1:40:53] battle comes we're built up and we're
[1:40:55] ready for it to say
[1:40:57] hey not any step further you're not
[1:41:00] allowed in this house you're not allowed
[1:41:02] in my life you can take that box of
[1:41:04] rattlesnakes back to where you got
[1:41:07] it but watch this okay Prophet God
[1:41:10] saying okay you got to recognize Satan
[1:41:12] recognize every one of his tricks that's
[1:41:13] step one to overcoming two recognize
[1:41:15] that greater is he that's in you now
[1:41:17] watch how he shows us how Satan tries to
[1:41:19] keep us from doing that he says you look
[1:41:22] back and say I'm doing this and I'm
[1:41:24] doing that what looking at your faults
[1:41:27] and your
[1:41:27] failures and saying because of those I
[1:41:30] don't get to
[1:41:32] overcome he says then no he says you're
[1:41:35] defeated but what's the antidote to this
[1:41:37] he says but there's no condemnation to
[1:41:40] them which are in Christ Jesus that walk
[1:41:42] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:41:45] he says then then you realize that
[1:41:48] you've overcome when you can get past
[1:41:50] your conscience when you can get past
[1:41:52] these things that Satan brings up about
[1:41:53] your past even about your present and
[1:41:55] say that's not what I'm trusting in I'm
[1:41:58] trusting in the Holy Ghost that's
[1:41:59] indwelling my life in my heart today he
[1:42:01] says then you realize that you've
[1:42:03] overcome and you know that he's a devil
[1:42:06] you can't say I got a sickness and I
[1:42:07] don't believe it's a sickness he says oh
[1:42:09] yes it's a sickness you got cancer but
[1:42:11] you don't believe it's a cancer it's a
[1:42:13] cancer he says but remember greater is
[1:42:17] he that's in you than he that's in the
[1:42:19] world you must
[1:42:23] must must must recognize realize that
[1:42:27] the Holy Spirit that's in you has
[1:42:32] already already overcome this thing he
[1:42:36] says and he's in you and you can
[1:42:38] overcome by him he says that's exactly
[1:42:40] sensible it's exactly the way the
[1:42:42] scripture is written overcoming what is
[1:42:45] it you've got to know that you know that
[1:42:47] you know that the Holy Ghost is inside
[1:42:49] of you church and when that is settled
[1:42:52] everything else will be settled in time
[1:42:54] in time don't think that it suddenly
[1:42:56] makes you able to overcome every single
[1:42:58] thing because we've still got a develop
[1:43:00] character we've still got to prove our
[1:43:01] faith God's still got to give us a
[1:43:03] testimony you will never see anywhere in
[1:43:06] scripture where every single person any
[1:43:08] person walked through life and never had
[1:43:10] a moment of a trial of their faith where
[1:43:12] there was a gap of time between when
[1:43:14] they believed and when they received it
[1:43:16] even Christ had to wait three days
[1:43:18] before he was raised from the
[1:43:21] dead amen
[1:43:24] we all have a trial of our faith don't
[1:43:27] let the time barrier hold you back from
[1:43:30] believing you got the Holy Ghost
[1:43:34] amen first John I'm loving first
[1:43:38] John for whatsoever is born of
[1:43:42] God how do we get the New Birth by one
[1:43:45] Spirit he says for whatsoever is born of
[1:43:48] God
[1:43:50] overcometh you know what I love about
[1:43:52] that that means
[1:43:53] continuously
[1:43:55] overcomes not just yesterday not just
[1:43:58] tomorrow right
[1:44:00] now
[1:44:02] forever whatsoever is born of God
[1:44:05] overcomes continuously Moment by moment
[1:44:08] day by day you've got victory in your
[1:44:10] life he says overcomes what the world he
[1:44:14] says and this is the victory that
[1:44:16] overcometh the world even our faith what
[1:44:20] it's our personal revelation and this is
[1:44:22] not just human Faith this is just not
[1:44:24] personal faith this is the faith of
[1:44:26] Jesus Christ Paul said he says I live
[1:44:28] the life that I live I live by the
[1:44:30] faith of the Son of God Amen that's our
[1:44:33] day-by-day faith church this is not like
[1:44:36] I said a law this is a promise this is
[1:44:40] something we can go to God and say God
[1:44:41] I'm looking for you to enforce this in
[1:44:43] my life I'm looking for the Holy Spirit
[1:44:45] to give me overcoming power day by day
[1:44:49] by day don't put pressure on yourself
[1:44:52] put pressure on God if you you want to
[1:44:53] put it that way and say Lord I'm living
[1:44:55] my life as clean and as as close to you
[1:44:57] as I can and when I do that then the
[1:44:59] rest is up to you I can only do my best
[1:45:03] the best is not what overcomes it's the
[1:45:05] power of the Holy Ghost Inside of us
[1:45:07] that overcomes because we're born of God
[1:45:09] we're born of the spirit brother B says
[1:45:12] this he says the holy spirit separates
[1:45:13] us from the things of the world from the
[1:45:16] cares of this world and our whole
[1:45:18] affection set on Christ Jesus whether we
[1:45:20] live or die what do we do we serve him
[1:45:23] and we love him and we go
[1:45:26] forward go forward go forward go forward
[1:45:31] he says doing all that we can to Magnify
[1:45:33] Him unto the people do we have dominion
[1:45:37] over the world church we are more than
[1:45:39] conquerors we are more than Overcomers
[1:45:42] through Christ who died for us
[1:45:44] amen he says we have dominion over the
[1:45:47] devil now this is the big bad wolf isn't
[1:45:49] it see it's one thing to talk about
[1:45:52] demons it's one thing to talk about
[1:45:53] sickness it's one thing to talk about
[1:45:55] life's trials and tribulations but now
[1:45:57] we're talking about the personality the
[1:45:59] very one of evil the son of predition
[1:46:02] the origin of all of these
[1:46:04] things it's one thing to fight a
[1:46:06] Philistines it's another thing to fight
[1:46:08] Goliath isn't it this is the Goliath now
[1:46:10] coming out this is the big dog amen this
[1:46:12] is the head of all principalities and
[1:46:14] powers on this Earth and you know what
[1:46:17] he's extremely logical and extremely
[1:46:20] reasonable that's what makes him so
[1:46:22] difficult so many times is he makes so
[1:46:24] much
[1:46:26] sense that's why he got that's how he
[1:46:28] got Eve he got her into reasoning
[1:46:30] instead of stain behind the protection
[1:46:31] of the word of God brother Braham says
[1:46:33] God gives us the greatest weapon that
[1:46:35] you can have and he says it's the word
[1:46:38] of God and as soon as we lay it down
[1:46:39] Satan's got us because he's way better
[1:46:41] at logic and reasoning than any of us
[1:46:43] could
[1:46:44] be he's subtle he's not obvious he's
[1:46:47] smart he knows how to reason but I want
[1:46:49] to read our portion in Hebrews 2 says
[1:46:52] for as then as the children are
[1:46:54] partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[1:46:56] likewise took part of the
[1:46:58] same he says we go through Flesh and
[1:47:01] Blood realities we live life in flesh
[1:47:03] and blood and so he came down to do the
[1:47:05] same thing we
[1:47:07] do but he came for a different reason
[1:47:09] and with a different effect it says that
[1:47:11] through
[1:47:12] death he might destroy him that had the
[1:47:15] power of death that is the devil so what
[1:47:19] Christ did destroy the power of the
[1:47:20] devil it didn't just destroy the power
[1:47:21] it destroyed him says that is Christ's
[1:47:24] Dominion because he took Satan's best
[1:47:26] shot and he rose on the third day and he
[1:47:28] came up with the keys to everything that
[1:47:30] Satan held a bunch of broken weapons in
[1:47:32] a house that has no lock that works
[1:47:35] anymore he says and what does he do he
[1:47:38] delivers them who through fear of death
[1:47:40] were all their lifetime subject to
[1:47:42] bondage remember we read in the
[1:47:44] scriptures we were that we're no longer
[1:47:46] servants we were in bondage to the
[1:47:47] things of this world he says but now we
[1:47:49] realize we're children of God we're not
[1:47:51] bound by fear
[1:47:53] that's Satan's tool is fear it's always
[1:47:56] fear that's why we make decisions
[1:47:57] against the word of God is because we
[1:47:59] fear what could happen rather than what
[1:48:01] could happen by the word We Fear Satan's
[1:48:03] effect rather than believe God's effect
[1:48:06] that's the things that jump out at us
[1:48:08] speaking of Christ he says at the age of
[1:48:10] 33 Jesus owned everything he made the
[1:48:14] world he says he was in the world and
[1:48:17] the world knew him not he never made
[1:48:19] himself a reputation he never gathered
[1:48:21] any military man he never or organized
[1:48:23] any churches he never made any great
[1:48:25] names for himself he never come forth
[1:48:27] with any boasting degrees of Doctrine
[1:48:29] Theology and so forth he never had a
[1:48:31] record of him ever going into any School
[1:48:33] of Theology he says but he had
[1:48:37] God you'd think today with all of the
[1:48:40] Mega
[1:48:41] Ministries that they'd have God but it's
[1:48:44] the one thing they're lacking and you
[1:48:45] see it in the effect of their Ministries
[1:48:47] is they've got everything except him
[1:48:48] they've got wealth Fame Fortune
[1:48:51] influence and they don't know anything
[1:48:53] about
[1:48:55] Christ he says and at the age of 33 he
[1:48:58] had conquered every devil that stuck his
[1:49:00] head out of hell he conquered sickness
[1:49:02] he conquered superstitions he conquered
[1:49:04] Devils he conquered death and when he
[1:49:06] died at the cross he descended into the
[1:49:08] Bottomless Pits of hell and conquered
[1:49:10] hell and on Easter morning he conquered
[1:49:13] the grave why catch this he played the
[1:49:16] rules of the game right running with the
[1:49:19] message we have to stay with the word
[1:49:21] for our day we we can't overcome by
[1:49:23] somebody else's word somebody else's
[1:49:25] message we've got to run with the
[1:49:26] message of our
[1:49:28] day he says he was and he gone go God
[1:49:31] sent him and he had a message to tell
[1:49:33] them and with the message that God gave
[1:49:36] him he conquered the powers of Satan
[1:49:38] remember what brother BR would say he
[1:49:39] said he conquered him by three words it
[1:49:41] is written he said showing that even the
[1:49:45] weakest believer can conquer anything
[1:49:47] that Satan brings against them it is
[1:49:49] written we conquer by the word we
[1:49:51] conquer by the word and then what
[1:49:53] enforces the word the Holy Spirit that's
[1:49:56] it if the only words that come out of
[1:49:58] your mouth are it is written Satan won't
[1:50:00] stick around for long because there's no
[1:50:02] reasoning there's no logic there's no
[1:50:04] arguing with somebody that only does the
[1:50:05] word if everything that comes out is it
[1:50:07] is written it is written it is written
[1:50:09] Satan gets real tired of that real easy
[1:50:11] because you're under the umbrella of the
[1:50:13] word he can't get to you he can't touch
[1:50:15] you as long as you stay
[1:50:17] there he says he with the message God
[1:50:19] gave him he conquered the powers of
[1:50:21] Satan he conquered sickness conquered
[1:50:23] death he conquered hell he conquered the
[1:50:25] grave why because he went go tell I
[1:50:28] always do that which my father shows me
[1:50:30] to do I do nothing but what he tells me
[1:50:32] to do but watch this he says then before
[1:50:35] he died he said even as the father has
[1:50:37] sent me so send I you not to build Men
[1:50:41] by military strength not to put all your
[1:50:43] time in who will be president that might
[1:50:45] be essential but it's not essential in
[1:50:47] this the world is
[1:50:50] gone so don't get tied up in it
[1:50:53] he says we've got one message that is
[1:50:56] Jesus Christ this raised from the dead
[1:50:59] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:51:02] forever you know the scripture says that
[1:51:04] there'll be a famine of hearing the
[1:51:06] words of the Lord in the end time it's
[1:51:09] sad to see how people have painted them
[1:51:12] into a into a box of unbelief by taking
[1:51:14] the word of God and making it of no
[1:51:16] effect my wife shared something with me
[1:51:18] there's a pastor named Dwayne Miller and
[1:51:21] they didn't have video of this I would
[1:51:22] have loved to see the video especially
[1:51:24] since it happened in this Modern Age but
[1:51:25] it was on recording when what happened
[1:51:27] was he had a a a disease in his throat a
[1:51:31] condition in his throat he'd been to
[1:51:32] many doctors many specialists they
[1:51:35] couldn't do anything about it and he's
[1:51:37] literally talking about the the Isaiah
[1:51:40] 53 I think it is with by his stripes we
[1:51:42] are healed and he was saying now that
[1:51:44] doesn't mean that God will heal every
[1:51:46] person and I agree with that because we
[1:51:50] see that God doesn't heal every person
[1:51:52] but I believe that he heals the
[1:51:53] Believers I do believe that brother Bram
[1:51:56] taught us that the scripture teaches us
[1:51:58] that he says but I also don't believe
[1:52:00] that God that as they say today God
[1:52:02] doesn't heal anymore he says we can't
[1:52:05] put God in a box God we leave the
[1:52:07] sovereignty of those decisions up to him
[1:52:09] but as he's talking about this so he's
[1:52:11] saying I believe God heals that's his
[1:52:13] confession is I believe God heals I
[1:52:15] don't believe he heals everybody but I
[1:52:17] believe he heals and he's able to heal
[1:52:19] even today and as he's talking his voice
[1:52:22] starts to change and he doesn't realize
[1:52:26] what's happening until he's literally
[1:52:27] completely healed and then he starts to
[1:52:30] choke up and he says I don't know what's
[1:52:33] happened he says I don't know what to do
[1:52:36] I don't know what to say because he has
[1:52:39] just experienced the supernatural
[1:52:41] Sovereign healing of the Lord Jesus
[1:52:43] Christ in his
[1:52:44] body what a wonderful thing to see but
[1:52:48] then we've got the vast majority of
[1:52:49] churches preaching that was only for the
[1:52:51] day of the apostle
[1:52:53] and nobody gets healed because what
[1:52:56] there's a famine for the hearing of the
[1:52:58] words of the Lord they made the word of
[1:53:00] no
[1:53:01] effect and we see here that he conquered
[1:53:04] every single devil every sickness
[1:53:07] everything that comes against us he
[1:53:09] conquered and we're supposed to have a
[1:53:11] taste of that victory in our very lives
[1:53:13] today and people are preaching it's for
[1:53:15] a different day what a
[1:53:19] shame we read this earlier in 1 John 3
[1:53:22] but I want to highlight it again from a
[1:53:23] different aspect says cuz we're talking
[1:53:26] about dominion over the devil we're
[1:53:27] starting to close he says he that
[1:53:29] committeth sin is of the devil for the
[1:53:31] devil sinth from the beginning but for
[1:53:34] this purpose the Son of God was
[1:53:36] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:53:39] works of the
[1:53:40] devil Dominion is destruction of
[1:53:43] anything and everything that
[1:53:46] opposes total Destruction supreme
[1:53:49] authority Supreme destruction it's a
[1:53:52] finished work it's a total Deliverance
[1:53:54] brother Brandon would preach about we
[1:53:56] sometimes stop so much earlier than we
[1:53:58] have
[1:53:59] to we're satisfied with our progress
[1:54:02] rather than a total deliverance and God
[1:54:05] never promised a partial he said kill
[1:54:08] everyone destroy everyone he came to
[1:54:11] destroy the works of the devil does that
[1:54:13] mean that we would hold back and say no
[1:54:14] we'll deal with a little bit of it no
[1:54:17] it's the same manifestation today it's
[1:54:18] the same Spirit of Christ it's meant to
[1:54:20] destroy the works of the devil he it
[1:54:22] says and whosoever is born of God does
[1:54:24] not commit sin for his seed remaineth in
[1:54:26] him and he cannot sin because he's born
[1:54:27] of God we read that earlier about the
[1:54:30] law we're under grace and there's no
[1:54:31] part of the law in it that's the beauty
[1:54:33] of unmar favor there's nothing I can do
[1:54:36] to make me worthy of it and there's
[1:54:37] nothing I can't
[1:54:39] do to make me worthy of it I have no
[1:54:42] part in it it's all a work of Grace amen
[1:54:44] the only law is the Covenant that he
[1:54:46] bound himself to that said there be a
[1:54:48] bride there that's without spot without
[1:54:50] wrinkle perfect unblemished before him
[1:54:52] that's the only law is that he promised
[1:54:55] and he holds himself to that when he
[1:54:57] took our
[1:54:58] place when he took our place he gave us
[1:55:01] his place his righteousness his
[1:55:04] Perfection his
[1:55:06] position all of those things and he sent
[1:55:08] down the Holy Spirit as a down payment
[1:55:10] as a seal as a proof of what is
[1:55:12] available to the Believers and the
[1:55:14] finished work that he's in the process
[1:55:16] of doing in our Redemption today you
[1:55:18] know under before Pentecost men live
[1:55:20] great lives but not a single one of them
[1:55:22] could could Ascend up to where he was
[1:55:24] they had to wait but as soon as he went
[1:55:26] down what did he do he rose those Saints
[1:55:29] with him and he took them off to be with
[1:55:31] him their perfect
[1:55:34] lives under the blood of bulls and goats
[1:55:36] as good as they were and I would say
[1:55:38] many of them were better than I and
[1:55:40] maybe better than you it could never
[1:55:42] take them into their into God's presence
[1:55:44] it took his death his burial his
[1:55:47] resurrection his blood his Perfection to
[1:55:50] restore us back to that
[1:55:53] and in that time Satan had a right to
[1:55:54] accuse we see there that Satan's Up
[1:55:56] Before the Throne of God and he's
[1:55:57] accusing the
[1:55:59] Brethren he had a right to brother Brown
[1:56:03] would say it's because the the sins were
[1:56:04] covered not
[1:56:05] erased there was still something there
[1:56:07] he still had something but as soon as
[1:56:09] that Holy Ghost came down on the day of
[1:56:11] Pentecost what did it do it took away
[1:56:13] Satan's rights because now we're
[1:56:15] standing perfect and accepted and God
[1:56:18] won't allow anybody to stand there and
[1:56:20] impune the good nature of his bride he
[1:56:22] won't stand for it
[1:56:24] anymore that's the down
[1:56:26] payment of fully destroying the works of
[1:56:30] Satan what's the finished the scripture
[1:56:32] says the final thing that'll be
[1:56:34] destroyed is what
[1:56:36] death we go into Resurrection we go on a
[1:56:38] Rapture that's the last thing that'll be
[1:56:39] destroyed but everything beneath that
[1:56:41] will be destroyed in our lives before we
[1:56:43] get out of here that's the dominion over
[1:56:46] Satan that's the dominion over the devil
[1:56:48] that we have today and we get to
[1:56:49] experience that it starts in our soul
[1:56:51] the first place is always a soul but
[1:56:53] that Holy Ghost starts to do a work then
[1:56:55] on the spirit and it starts to work out
[1:56:57] into the body until this whole thing is
[1:56:59] bound up in the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:01] and Satan is bound he can't touch us
[1:57:04] it's the temple of God he has no place
[1:57:06] there he has no right there and a People
[1:57:08] is holding that token deed that title
[1:57:11] deed that Abstract title deed and saying
[1:57:12] you got no right to be here
[1:57:14] Satan and we defeat him by the power of
[1:57:17] the Holy Ghost Inside of us brother R
[1:57:20] puts it this way as we close he says on
[1:57:22] the day of Pentecost he sent down the
[1:57:24] Holy Ghost to continue through the
[1:57:26] Gentiles to take out a seed of promise
[1:57:29] to give to the Gentiles the offcast to
[1:57:31] give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:33] to bring them into the promise he says
[1:57:36] now we have a right to conquer all
[1:57:39] sickness that's a lot of pressure he
[1:57:43] says we don't have to conquer it it's
[1:57:44] already conquered we just have to claim
[1:57:47] the promise and go take it it's already
[1:57:49] conquered death is conquered hell isqu
[1:57:52] conquered sickness is conquered
[1:57:53] temptation is conquered all Devils is
[1:57:55] conquered hell is conquered death
[1:57:57] conquered the grave is conquered he says
[1:57:59] we stand in the gate taking it don't
[1:58:02] have to fire a shot it's already been
[1:58:05] paid for he says his enemy he'll possess
[1:58:08] the gate how many he says thousands of
[1:58:10] millions he'll possess the Gate of his
[1:58:13] enemy which one every enemy he rose from
[1:58:17] the dead we possess it because what he
[1:58:20] gave it to us it's all a free gift and
[1:58:23] besides that and everything that he has
[1:58:25] done and conquered every gate he
[1:58:27] conquered sickness and took the gate the
[1:58:29] only thing we have to do is walk up to
[1:58:31] the gate and say in the name of Jesus
[1:58:33] Christ the Conqueror amen he says and we
[1:58:36] who are dead in Christ are Abraham's
[1:58:38] seed and we are more than conquerors
[1:58:40] through him who conquered everything for
[1:58:42] us no reason for us to have to overcome
[1:58:45] anything because it's already
[1:58:49] conquered he says The Last Enemy
[1:58:52] sickness death
[1:58:55] Temptations all things are put under his
[1:58:57] feet and we are the Seed of Abraham
[1:59:00] being dead in Christ we are Abraham's
[1:59:02] seed what does this look like church
[1:59:04] marching on Victory to Victory to
[1:59:08] Victory holding God's promise out before
[1:59:11] us and going on he says Abraham SE with
[1:59:13] a swarm Promise by Jehovah God that he
[1:59:16] will possess the Gate of every
[1:59:20] enemy what are we afraid
[1:59:24] about what are you afraid about what am
[1:59:27] I afraid about this
[1:59:28] evening can I tell you where I get
[1:59:31] afraid when I say I don't think I can do
[1:59:37] it when I say I don't have it I don't
[1:59:41] have enough I've never done this before
[1:59:44] I've never tried this before this is
[1:59:46] bigger than me this is bigger than
[1:59:47] anyone else that's ever tried
[1:59:50] it what is it
[1:59:53] I'm looking at me I'm afraid of me I'm
[1:59:56] afraid of my capability I'm a of afraid
[1:59:59] of my strength I'm afraid of my
[2:00:01] discipline I'm afraid of my lack of
[2:00:03] those things that's why I'm afraid is
[2:00:05] because I'm looking at
[2:00:08] me remember what happened when Goliath
[2:00:11] came sorry we'll leave that alone when
[2:00:15] they went into Canaan what held them
[2:00:17] back from Canaan Church they said
[2:00:19] compared to what's waiting for us to
[2:00:21] battle us we are like
[2:00:23] grasshoppers we're little itty bitty
[2:00:26] nothings compared to the giants that are
[2:00:28] waiting for us over there and only two
[2:00:31] said we are more than able to take it
[2:00:35] why because they said he promised us
[2:00:38] it's for
[2:00:39] us they looked at the promise not
[2:00:42] themselves and that is how they overcame
[2:00:45] they overcame because they looked at the
[2:00:46] promise not themselves we get afraid
[2:00:48] when we say you've got to do it
[2:00:52] we'll never do it not a single believer
[2:00:55] has ever overcome by
[2:00:57] themselves he says what are we afraid
[2:00:59] about possess the gates we have God's
[2:01:03] promise do you have his
[2:01:05] promise he says we have his word do you
[2:01:08] have his word he says we have his holy
[2:01:11] spirit that's the only question that's
[2:01:13] left the word is here you tell me your
[2:01:16] problem I'll give you a word promise so
[2:01:19] the only question is do you have the
[2:01:20] Holy Ghost that's the only thing that
[2:01:22] would hold us back we're afraid we don't
[2:01:25] have what we say we
[2:01:26] have he says the angels are encamped
[2:01:29] about everything's in order every wall
[2:01:32] can be taken down he says it's already
[2:01:35] taken
[2:01:36] down look at look at Elisha or Elijah
[2:01:39] whichever one it was and he's out there
[2:01:41] and he's on the city walls and the the
[2:01:43] Chariots are all around them the Army's
[2:01:45] all around them and gahaz is standing
[2:01:48] there and he's saying we're in big
[2:01:49] trouble now and the prophet of God says
[2:01:52] there's more with us than there are them
[2:01:54] and he says what are you talking about
[2:01:56] and he prays and he says Lord Open the
[2:01:58] servant's eyes and he opened his eyes
[2:02:00] and he saw flaming Chariots of Fire in
[2:02:02] all the hills around them and he says
[2:02:04] there's more with us than there is with
[2:02:07] them that's what we've got to
[2:02:09] recognize the battle's not ours battle
[2:02:12] belongs to God not by might not by power
[2:02:17] by my
[2:02:18] spirit he
[2:02:20] says the every wall can be taken down
[2:02:23] it's already taken down there's more of
[2:02:26] us with us than against us he says the
[2:02:28] Son of God goes before us His Banner are
[2:02:30] waving and there's nothing can stand in
[2:02:32] the way of a saint going to meet a
[2:02:35] promise of God death can't stop at the
[2:02:37] grave can't stop it the devil can't stop
[2:02:39] it we are more than conqueror sickness
[2:02:42] is conquered for you friends death is
[2:02:44] conquered for you habits have been
[2:02:46] conquered for you praise the Lord habits
[2:02:48] have been conquered amen I'm a testimony
[2:02:50] that habits have been conquered
[2:02:51] temptation's been
[2:02:53] conquered he says you say I got a temper
[2:02:56] I can't get over
[2:02:58] it it's conquered he already conquered
[2:03:01] it the great final Seed of Abraham
[2:03:04] there's no more conquering to do now he
[2:03:06] conquered for us now we by his grace
[2:03:10] through his promise just believe and
[2:03:13] hold on he says that's all we do it's
[2:03:16] already finished our sickness our
[2:03:19] transgressions he was wounded for our
[2:03:21] transgression bruised for our iniquity
[2:03:23] the chastisement of our peace is upon
[2:03:25] him and with his stripes we were healed
[2:03:31] amen God bless you let's stand if we
[2:03:33] would the musicians would
[2:03:36] come what hinders
[2:03:39] us dominion over sin flesh the world
[2:03:45] devil what hinders us
[2:03:51] when we forget who we
[2:03:53] are when we doubt our experience when we
[2:03:57] doubt our baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:03:59] when we forget the works of God in our
[2:04:04] life it's always been a Marvel to me how
[2:04:06] the was talking with somebody about this
[2:04:08] the other day a Marvel how the children
[2:04:10] of Israel could forget that God was with
[2:04:13] them when he literally had a sign over
[2:04:15] them day in and day
[2:04:18] out Pillar of Fire by night and a cloud
[2:04:20] of fire and a pillar of cloud by day
[2:04:23] Mana falling every
[2:04:25] morning every need supplied your clothes
[2:04:27] don't wear out shoes don't wear
[2:04:30] out everything provided and yet they
[2:04:32] forgot all about
[2:04:34] him we've got to feed our Experience day
[2:04:37] by day keep reminding ourselves of who
[2:04:40] we are you know what gives me faith when
[2:04:42] I read about others that did the things
[2:04:44] that I'm looking to do cuz you know what
[2:04:46] you'll find is that they're just regular
[2:04:48] people like you and I we think that
[2:04:50] there are these great people that have
[2:04:52] these great gifts and these great things
[2:04:54] but literally the vast majority are just
[2:04:56] simple people that stood up and took God
[2:04:58] at his word that's it that's all God
[2:05:01] asks us to do see what he says we by his
[2:05:04] grace through his promise we just
[2:05:06] believe and hold on that's it set your
[2:05:10] mind and say Lord I'm not letting go
[2:05:13] like Jacob I'll not let thee go until
[2:05:16] you bless me Lord until you give me what
[2:05:18] your word says I'll hold on now if he
[2:05:20] tells us to make some changes we'll make
[2:05:22] some changes amen sometimes we got to do
[2:05:24] some letting go of some other things
[2:05:26] before he can give us what he wants if
[2:05:28] he wants us to change he'll make those
[2:05:29] changes he'll let us know but otherwise
[2:05:31] all he's looking for is somebody that'll
[2:05:33] hold on say God I believe you at I'll
[2:05:35] take you at your word and every day say
[2:05:37] Lord I'm taking you at your word and you
[2:05:40] keep reminding him and you keep
[2:05:41] reminding Lord I believe you Lord I'm
[2:05:43] trusting you Lord I'm expecting you Lord
[2:05:47] I'm going to testify of you and you wait
[2:05:49] and see what he does it may take years
[2:05:53] Church it may take a split second I
[2:05:56] think of that man Dwayne Miller and
[2:05:58] while he yet spake the Lord healed his
[2:06:01] voice like
[2:06:02] that there are things that I'm believing
[2:06:04] for for people that I believe would just
[2:06:06] happened just like that this the way God
[2:06:09] works so many times he terries for a
[2:06:11] while but when when he moves it's a
[2:06:12] sudden quick work and it's a finished
[2:06:15] work and we finally get to see the the
[2:06:17] fruit of our faith amen but we've got to
[2:06:19] hold on we're Believers we've got to
[2:06:22] believe the only way I can get there
[2:06:24] church keep feeding on
[2:06:26] this the more I read it the more I
[2:06:29] believe it the more I see it the more I
[2:06:31] say that belongs to me that belongs to
[2:06:34] this congregation that belongs to every
[2:06:36] son and daughter of God that's been born
[2:06:38] again amen let's believe it let's feed
[2:06:41] on it God bless you let's bow our
[2:06:44] heads Lord

[2:06:51] Lord to the place of Victory Lord to the
[2:06:54] place of dominion that we're resting in
[2:06:57] tonight not in our own Works Lord not in
[2:07:00] our own righteousness not even in our
[2:07:03] own Faith Lord but it's the finished
[2:07:04] work of Calvary it's the power of the
[2:07:06] Holy Ghost Lord and it's a quickened
[2:07:08] word in our lives that does it Lord I
[2:07:11] pray you help us to feed on those
[2:07:13] things Lord I pray that you'd help us to
[2:07:16] just draw closer to you day by day Lord

[2:07:21] read of your promises Lord that we see
[2:07:22] our position Lord that we would say that
[2:07:25] is yay and amen and call other all other
[2:07:27] things as lies of Satan Lord let us not
[2:07:30] get into reasoning and
[2:07:32] logic Lord help us to just take you at
[2:07:35] your simple word Lord you don't make it
[2:07:38] difficult you don't hide these things
[2:07:39] from us Lord but Satan comes in and he
[2:07:42] tries to argue and tell us that they're
[2:07:44] not for us Lord I pray you'd help the
[2:07:46] people tonight Lord I include myself
[2:07:49] Lord I include myself Lord help us to
[2:07:52] see what you have for each and every one
[2:07:53] of us Lord that when you gave us the
[2:07:56] Holy Ghost you gave us everything we
[2:07:57] have needed to take us all the way into
[2:07:59] eternity Lord God lord may we let the
[2:08:03] power take hold of us Lord let us not
[2:08:05] wrestle with it or direct it Lord but
[2:08:08] let us yield to it and let it have its
[2:08:11] full and complete way in our lives in
[2:08:12] our bodies in our minds Lord in our
[2:08:15] habits in our temperament Lord wherever
[2:08:17] it is the need is Lord I pray that you
