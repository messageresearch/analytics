[41:52] amen thank
[41:54] you okay let's turn to zear Zariah
[41:58] 4 we'll start at verse
[42:09] 6 all right verse six then he answered
[42:12] and he spake unto me saying this is the
[42:14] word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying
[42:17] not by might nor by power but by my
[42:20] spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts who art
[42:22] thou oh great Mountain before zeruel
[42:24] Thou shalt become a plain and he shall
[42:27] bring forth The Headstone thereof with
[42:28] shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it
[42:31] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[42:33] me saying the hands of zerubabel have
[42:36] laid the foundation of this house his
[42:37] hands shall also finish it and thou
[42:39] shalt know that the Lord of hosts has
[42:41] sent me unto you for who hath despised
[42:44] the day of small things for they shall
[42:46] rejoice and shall see the plummet in the
[42:48] hand of zuub with those seven they are
[42:51] the eyes of the Lord which run to and
[42:52] fro through the whole earth all right
[42:55] you may be seated
[43:00] all right part three of
[43:03] Nehemiah and again we're still building
[43:05] the foundation okay the journey is hard
[43:10] but the destination is worth it I
[43:12] promise um the more I dig into this the
[43:15] more I am thankful that I am laying this
[43:19] large of a foundation because a lot of
[43:21] this is going to pay dividends when we
[43:23] finally talk about Nehemiah we mentioned
[43:24] Nehemiah once tonight okay we at least
[43:27] mention him one time right so we're
[43:29] getting
[43:30] closer so um let's get started uh so
[43:33] there's going to be a lot of scriptures
[43:36] um so I'm I'm got them all up here so
[43:39] you don't have to go through all them if
[43:40] you want to read it's up to you but uh
[43:43] no
[43:44] pressure okay so let's do a quick review
[43:46] uh last time we had a much smaller crowd
[43:48] I think Joe's family and John's family
[43:50] were were gone last time so um we'll
[43:53] just do a quick review to bring everyone
[43:55] up to speed
[43:57] all right so uh last time we went
[44:00] through essentially from uh the time of
[44:02] Jezebel up until uh the end of the seven
[44:05] years captivity when uh the children of
[44:09] Judah and Benjamin were essentially sent
[44:12] into slavery and were brought to
[44:14] Babylon
[44:16] so things started badly once Solomon
[44:19] fell into idolatry uh through the um
[44:23] causes of his foreign wives to are
[44:26] pagans and he broke the Commandment that
[44:28] Moses made of not multiplying women unto
[44:30] himself and for bringing Pagan wives
[44:34] into Jerusalem and he not only brought
[44:37] them in but he also tolerated it and
[44:40] made allowance for it by building
[44:41] temples for his wives and he started the
[44:45] the process that we see um the children
[44:47] of Israel go through we went through
[44:50] Ahab and how Jezebel essentially was the
[44:53] cause of the worship of Baal to come
[44:56] first into the 10 tribes which are
[44:59] called Israel and because of that you
[45:03] you see
[45:04] uh idolatry being something that was
[45:07] just happened amongst the people to it
[45:09] being mandated by the government and
[45:11] being enforced by the government so you
[45:13] had that combination of the political
[45:15] power with the religious power and when
[45:16] you combine those two it's absolute
[45:20] tyranny and it was death to a lot of
[45:23] Believers okay and that's where we see
[45:26] there came to a point where there was
[45:27] only 7,000 Believers in all of Israel
[45:31] out of all those people so it got to a
[45:34] dark point where the the spirit of
[45:36] Jezebel just had a grip on that entire
[45:39] Kingdom and through joh jehoshaphat's
[45:42] mistake when we go down into the uh
[45:45] children of Judah and Benjamin he
[45:47] started Mak lines with Ahab and that
[45:49] brought those two houses together and
[45:50] there was familiarity between those two
[45:52] houses and due to that they made a
[45:55] strategic decision to marry jeet's son
[45:58] to Jezebel's daughter okay and that's
[46:01] how we see the introduction of Baal come
[46:03] into the children of Judah and Benjamin
[46:07] and we see Judah goes from having good
[46:10] Kings you you see them struggle every so
[46:12] often but you you really don't see you
[46:15] don't see any mention of bail in Judah
[46:18] up until Jezebel and ethia come on the
[46:20] scene when that happens you see Judas
[46:24] just just completely gets sold out to
[46:26] baale and it's just it's a very rapid
[46:28] decline into absolute heathenism
[46:31] paganism and every vile and disgusting
[46:34] thing you can imagine it's just they
[46:36] went from the worship of Jehovah to the
[46:39] absolute pig sty it was just it was
[46:42] insane how you went from uh David to
[46:46] manasse who was offering his own
[46:49] children on on an altar and burning them
[46:51] alive with
[46:54] fire in a very very 200e period very
[46:57] short period of time you see David
[46:59] writing the Psalms to child sacrifice in
[47:02] Jerusalem just an absolute crazy uh
[47:05] decline into sin and that was from the
[47:08] spirit of Jezebel coming into Judah and
[47:10] bringing Baal
[47:11] in so from then on Manasseh was the Apex
[47:16] of of sin in Judah okay up until there
[47:20] was Grace God was sending uh prophets he
[47:23] was sending
[47:24] Isaiah and Jeremiah and this these these
[47:28] Kings would not heed okay and it came to
[47:32] the point where manasse went so far the
[47:35] Bible describes that the the the blood
[47:38] of the innocent ran through the streets
[47:40] of Jerusalem through his actions he was
[47:42] an absolute ruthless
[47:45] idolator absolutely ruthless so from
[47:48] then on in scripture God always
[47:51] describes that Judah is written off due
[47:54] to the sins of this one king manasse
[47:57] okay it was game over it was done no
[48:00] Grace remaining judgment was coming and
[48:02] from then onward you see in scripture
[48:04] you see mention of in Isaiah and
[48:06] Jeremiah that judgment is coming
[48:09] judgment is coming judgment is coming
[48:11] and then Jeremiah when he comes on the
[48:12] scene it's a it's a done deal okay there
[48:15] there's no more grace and Jeremiah is
[48:17] saying you're going to be sold into the
[48:19] land of Babylon for 70 years and I will
[48:21] bring you back unto
[48:23] myself so we see the first attack come
[48:26] against
[48:28] uh against Jerusalem in the year 1607
[48:31] and that's when we see Daniel and the
[48:33] three Hebrew children and this is when
[48:36] all the prime of of Judah just gets
[48:38] gutted and gets sent to Babylon right
[48:41] and the reason before that is is quite
[48:42] smart from a a natural point of view if
[48:44] you want to completely crush a nation
[48:48] never allow it to rise again you take
[48:50] the Brain Trust you take the prime you
[48:53] take all the smart people all the uh the
[48:55] talented people and you send them
[48:58] away that way you just got a bunch of
[49:01] you know Farmers you got a bunch of
[49:03] people who are not really you know Wise
[49:05] in the ways of politics and and conniver
[49:09] and they won't rise up again so you see
[49:12] with each attack they take away more and
[49:14] more they're just being stripped down to
[49:16] the bone nothing is left so Daniel gets
[49:19] sent off into Babylon after first
[49:22] attack um Nebuchadnezzar comes back with
[49:25] this with a second attack against
[49:26] Jerusalem that's when they take away
[49:28] Ezekiel and bring him um to the land of
[49:31] Babylon not to the city of Babylon but
[49:33] he was outside uh in another city
[49:36] ministering to the Jews there and then
[49:39] finally you see Jerusalem destroyed in
[49:42] the year
[49:43] 1587 and that's where we see um the
[49:46] whole the the city is ripped to shreds
[49:51] all the walls are torn down you see
[49:54] absolute devast station because the the
[49:57] Babylonians essentially starve them to
[49:59] death they set up a Siege around the
[50:00] city and they just let everyone starve
[50:02] to death and that's where jerus um
[50:05] Jeremiah prophesied the whole thing
[50:06] about plague and famine and all these
[50:09] things that that was when it was
[50:10] fulfilled in the city of Jerusalem it
[50:12] was just it was a miserable time you
[50:14] didn't do not want to want to be there
[50:16] during that point it was very
[50:17] reminiscent of what happened when uh
[50:19] Jerusalem fell again to the Romans after
[50:21] Jesus uh rose again that it was the same
[50:24] type of vation you know parents eating
[50:27] their children Etc it was just terrible
[50:30] so the temple gets stripped of all the
[50:34] treasures all the gold is ripped from
[50:36] the walls and then the temple is
[50:39] completely burned and all the treasures
[50:41] that were in the temple go to Babylon
[50:46] and this is where the Ark of the
[50:47] Covenant is just lost to history they
[50:50] they they just don't know what happened
[50:51] to
[50:52] it so finally all these uh uh the the
[50:57] final wave of uh slaves gets sent away
[51:00] to Babylon and that's where we see
[51:02] Jeremiah goes down into Egypt and
[51:04] eventually he dies they say he gets
[51:06] stoned to death at some point and you
[51:09] have the 70-year
[51:11] period where you have Daniel essentially
[51:13] is essentially the main character during
[51:15] these 70 years where he deals with
[51:17] Nebuchadnezzar he deals with Bazar with
[51:20] the the the hand on the wall and then
[51:23] the finally the the fall of Babylon to
[51:25] the
[51:26] Persians and this is where you see
[51:28] Darius the Meade come in and he's
[51:30] dealing with the Persians for that
[51:32] little period and then finally we come
[51:34] to the 70th year 537 which is when Cyrus
[51:37] the Great comes on the scene so this is
[51:40] where we left off and this is where
[51:43] we'll proceed to the next
[51:45] part so when they left
[51:49] Jerusalem the last wave of Jews leaving
[51:52] way this is how they left it this was
[51:54] the last thing they they saw when they
[51:56] left the whole place burning okay and
[52:01] this was a sober
[52:03] period of idolatry in Israel in
[52:08] Judah death famine
[52:12] flame so this was a very Stark reminder
[52:15] to the Jews of this is the end result of
[52:20] sin this is this is you reaping what you
[52:23] have sown and this is what going to
[52:25] happen if you don't obey me this is what
[52:28] happens when you allow these things into
[52:30] your life and you allow them to fester
[52:32] and you tolerate it and you don't burn
[52:34] it out immediately and you allow it to
[52:36] grow and grow this is the end result and
[52:39] it's not a pretty sight
[52:43] so
[52:46] uh
[52:49] the so this is this is a a stark reality
[52:54] and it it was quite depressing
[52:56] because Solomon's Temple was was
[52:58] glorious it was it was the it was one of
[53:00] the wonders of the world and it was they
[53:03] say if they rebuilt it today it would
[53:05] cost between three billion to6 billion
[53:07] dollar that's how much it would cost
[53:09] that that was how much gold was overlaid
[53:12] it was an absolute Masterpiece peoples
[53:15] of the world will come to it it was that
[53:17] amazing that's why you see the Queen of
[53:18] Sheba coming because it was just a
[53:20] marvelous thing and you have Solomon on
[53:22] top of it and then you have this and his
[53:25] Devastation so as we know is this the
[53:29] end no it's not what it is it's an
[53:32] opportunity for I will restore and God
[53:36] is a master at chaos taking chaos and
[53:40] brooding over it allowing life to come
[53:42] forth he it's that that's when the God's
[53:45] light bursts the brightest it's because
[53:48] he can take the impossible and make it
[53:51] live
[53:52] again and it's God's grace because it's
[53:54] just
[53:56] in man sight this is the kingdom is done
[53:58] you look at Nineveh the the the the
[54:00] capital of Assyria it was the greatest
[54:02] nation at that time they ruled for a
[54:04] thousand years and then the Babylonians
[54:07] came in and it becomes a wasteland it
[54:10] becomes buried in hundreds of feet of
[54:13] sand and they only found it
[54:15] recently that's how that without God
[54:18] that's that's what happens to Jerusalem
[54:21] buried in years of
[54:23] sand but you look at today is a thriving
[54:26] place where you know they don't have the
[54:29] temple yet but they will soon have it
[54:30] and it's just this is grace of
[54:33] God so the next phase that we're we're
[54:36] entering now is you you went from
[54:38] idolatry ending in judgment and now they
[54:41] have hit the bottom of the barrel okay
[54:42] there's nothing to
[54:44] go there's no direction to go but up and
[54:47] now this is the time of restoration
[54:50] right so restoration means the action of
[54:53] returning something to our former own
[54:55] Corner place or condition right and this
[54:58] process of restoration would would come
[55:02] through three phases so the there was
[55:04] three waves of the Jews out of Jerusalem
[55:09] and Judah and then three waves back from
[55:11] Babylon into Jerusalem right and he
[55:14] would use three three men all right and
[55:16] those three men were zerubabel Ezra and
[55:18] neamiah and each each phase of Exiles
[55:22] returning from Babylon had a distinct
[55:24] job and purpose because zerubbabel's job
[55:26] was to restore the temple Ezra's job was
[55:29] to restore the law and R applies the
[55:31] token in such a way that is quite um
[55:36] it's quite Stark but when you realize
[55:38] how far the the Israelites went through
[55:41] idolatry you see why Ezra was so so hard
[55:44] with
[55:45] sin and then the finally uh Nehemiah
[55:49] Nehemiah uh his job was to restore the
[55:52] wall okay and this was the three phases
[55:54] of God 's
[55:56] restoration
[55:58] so
[55:59] restoration tends to be a slow process
[56:04] it's not a typically a fast thing it's
[56:07] not like a miracle where you you are
[56:09] from this to to to complete healing it's
[56:13] usually a very line uponline a very slow
[56:17] a very purposeful process right and you
[56:21] look in our lives there there's certain
[56:23] things where God takes it quick and
[56:24] there's certain things that he takes
[56:25] slow right and there's things in our
[56:28] lives that for whatever reason it just
[56:31] takes slower for God to restore them and
[56:33] God's constantly constantly working on
[56:36] every area of your life as you allow him
[56:39] okay because God's a gentleman he's not
[56:41] not going to come in like a tyrant and
[56:43] kick the doors down he is a gentleman
[56:45] right and he's a gentle husband and
[56:47] father and he will ask permission right
[56:50] and it's free will that's where Free
[56:52] Will is still uh has a place because you
[56:56] can brother BR says it God will work
[56:59] with whatever you give him and sansim is
[57:02] probably the the the most clear and
[57:04] distinct example of this where he gave
[57:06] God his gift but he didn't give God his
[57:08] heart right and and there's there's a
[57:11] there's a great degree of blessing that
[57:14] comes with giving God everything you
[57:15] look at someone like
[57:16] Elijah God loves Elijah and you see to
[57:19] the point where there was such an
[57:20] obedience there that God uses that same
[57:22] Spirit five different times because it's
[57:24] so yielded himself to the word of God
[57:27] and to the leading of the Lord whereas
[57:29] you look at someone like Samson when you
[57:32] don't give God everything pain and trial
[57:35] and tribulation follows you okay because
[57:38] if you're seed you'll finally get there
[57:40] and you look at someone like Sam uh
[57:41] Samson he finally got there let me die
[57:45] with my enemies that was when he finally
[57:47] surrendered everything and he finally
[57:49] was of great use not just of some use
[57:52] but of great use so if you want to be a
[57:54] effective if you want to be of use to
[57:56] the kingdom of God you have to yield but
[57:59] there's also Grace for that yielding he
[58:01] doesn't require a total yielding all at
[58:04] once you if you read the the the sermon
[58:06] that brother B does door and doors it's
[58:09] a a great sermon about how God just
[58:11] there's there's there's all these doors
[58:13] and eventually he starts knocking on all
[58:14] them and there's certain things that he
[58:17] he doesn't work on everything all at
[58:19] once because it's it's too much for the
[58:21] human Spirit to handle if he worked on
[58:23] everything all at once we' be all
[58:25] running away as fast as we could because
[58:28] we're human it's just the spirit is
[58:30] willing but the flesh is weak all right
[58:32] and there's Grace for that there is
[58:34] Grace for that and he's patient with you
[58:36] he's a lot more patient with you than
[58:37] you are with yourself and certainly a
[58:39] lot more patient than other people that
[58:41] than with you you know it's just God's
[58:43] grace to us because you know I look at
[58:47] myself like I have no patience for
[58:49] myself like you I'm constantly being
[58:50] myself like why AR am I further ahead
[58:53] but God has perfect time
[58:55] and there's there's reasons for why cuz
[58:59] if at the end of the
[59:01] day there's a certain place where we
[59:03] need to to get at before we go and the
[59:07] bride is not going to be this
[59:09] defeated tail between its legs
[59:13] lackluster weak frail
[59:17] fatigued
[59:18] bride she's going to be without blemish
[59:22] she's going to be glorious she's going
[59:24] going to be Victorious and she'll be
[59:26] shining like the stars and that's going
[59:29] to happen here not over there it's going
[59:31] to happen here and there's a certain
[59:34] process that each and every one of us
[59:36] has that will get us there and Dad's
[59:39] process is not going to be my process
[59:42] because Dad has a different set of
[59:44] issues than I do brother Mark for those
[59:46] listening um so there's certain things
[59:50] that God requires of of brother Mark
[59:52] that he doesn't require of me and vice
[59:54] versa
[59:55] because each and every one of us has a
[59:57] different place and a different purpose
[59:59] zerubbabel's purpose was what restoring
[1:00:01] the temple if he tried to restore the
[1:00:03] walls he was out of the will of God and
[1:00:05] he would have been
[1:00:06] punished and vice versa if Nehemiah
[1:00:09] tries to go ahead of God and restore the
[1:00:11] temple without zuub doing it he would
[1:00:13] have been out of the plan of God because
[1:00:15] it doesn't matter if you have the desire
[1:00:17] for it or if you have the ability for it
[1:00:19] it doesn't matter what Iota are you the
[1:00:21] right person at the right time with the
[1:00:24] right
[1:00:26] leading with the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:00:28] you those all those things have to line
[1:00:31] up in order for you to have purpose and
[1:00:33] to be effective I can't do brother Joe's
[1:00:36] job and brother Joe can't do my job and
[1:00:38] there's Grace for that and you got to
[1:00:40] respect it and you got to stay in your
[1:00:41] lane and you can't keep on saying you
[1:00:44] know why aren't you doing more because
[1:00:46] God is over everything and Joe answers
[1:00:51] to God he doesn't answer to me and vice
[1:00:54] versa
[1:00:55] so that's why you can't look look at the
[1:00:57] arm of Flesh that's why you can't I
[1:00:59] can't look at Joe and and and criticize
[1:01:01] for where he not where he's at you you
[1:01:04] know what I mean Joe is a great guy
[1:01:06] right he's a wonderful boss and brother
[1:01:09] and
[1:01:10] friend
[1:01:11] um so the main thing here is that
[1:01:15] restoration is a process and it starts
[1:01:18] the moment you say I
[1:01:21] surrender and it ends when you either
[1:01:24] croak or you go in a
[1:01:27] Rapture that's the bookends there's no
[1:01:30] there's no breaks there's
[1:01:32] no as much as we would love it just
[1:01:35] vacations from the restoration
[1:01:38] process because he has to get us Rapture
[1:01:43] Ready
[1:01:45] okay so you know the the scripture here
[1:01:48] just kind of summarizes everything we're
[1:01:49] saying here is that in Isaiah Whom Shall
[1:01:51] he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he
[1:01:53] make to understand Doctrine them that
[1:01:55] are weaned from the milk and drawn from
[1:01:56] the breast for precept must be upon
[1:01:58] precept precept upon precept line upon
[1:02:00] line line upon line here little and
[1:02:02] their little for with stammering lips
[1:02:04] and another tongue will he speak to this
[1:02:06] people to whom he said this is the rest
[1:02:07] worth you may cause the weary to rest
[1:02:10] and this is the refreshing yet they will
[1:02:12] not hear
[1:02:14] okay so moving on you know the the where
[1:02:19] it's applicable for us is you know
[1:02:21] brother Bram says here in the the seven
[1:02:23] Church age book uh the resume of the
[1:02:25] Ages which is the summary he says but in
[1:02:27] the age in which each lived so in each
[1:02:29] of the the first six Church Ages was not
[1:02:32] the age of restoration neither was any
[1:02:34] age but this last age the age of leosa
[1:02:37] the age of complete blackout in
[1:02:40] apostasy this is the age of apostasy and
[1:02:43] this is the age of restoration is the
[1:02:45] age of the finished cycle with this it
[1:02:46] is all over all right so we are in the
[1:02:49] season of
[1:02:50] restoration we're at the point where
[1:02:52] everything has been restored in terms of
[1:02:53] the word and now it's time for us to get
[1:02:56] into our positional places right and
[1:02:58] it's just it what and what that requires
[1:03:01] is a very simple thing brother Rand
[1:03:03] gives two directions in terms of getting
[1:03:06] to a place where you'll be ready read
[1:03:08] your Bible and pray and somehow those
[1:03:11] two very simple things are the hardest
[1:03:13] things to do day in day out it should be
[1:03:15] the simplest thing but it's the hardest
[1:03:16] thing okay and what and what that does
[1:03:20] is that that means that you're laying in
[1:03:21] the presence of the Sun and he's baking
[1:03:23] out that greenness that immaturity
[1:03:26] that's inside of you because what gets
[1:03:28] into the kingdom character that's the
[1:03:31] only thing you're bringing with you and
[1:03:33] that's what he's trying to build within
[1:03:34] you with this restoration process is
[1:03:36] that gradual growth that line upon line
[1:03:39] how does a tree grow one ring at a time
[1:03:43] its only job is to soak up so it can
[1:03:45] push out and with each time it does that
[1:03:48] there is another ring of
[1:03:51] growth that that that is produced
[1:03:54] and it's a very slow process if you try
[1:03:57] to watch a a tree grow it's very boring
[1:03:59] because it's very
[1:04:01] slow but over time it grows and it not
[1:04:04] only does it grow out it grows down and
[1:04:06] that's the most important thing that it
[1:04:08] grows down and it the roots go down and
[1:04:11] it clutches the Bedrock because if it
[1:04:13] grips onto the Bedrock it doesn't matter
[1:04:15] what happens up top as long as he's
[1:04:17] grabbing down below nothing's going to
[1:04:18] hurt it okay so that's what our job is
[1:04:22] our job is to grow down soak up the word
[1:04:24] of God and push out the attributes of
[1:04:26] the spirit okay and there's different
[1:04:28] seasons there's times where you're not
[1:04:30] going to have much fruit there because
[1:04:31] it's a different season okay so that's
[1:04:34] why you you you got to have Grace for
[1:04:36] yourself and don't look at yourself
[1:04:39] based on your own standard because your
[1:04:41] standard is not the word of God your
[1:04:44] standard is supposed to be the word of
[1:04:46] God okay and there is dry seasons and
[1:04:51] then there's wet Seasons if you have a
[1:04:53] constant state of wet time of revival
[1:04:57] time where you're feeling the Holy
[1:04:59] Spirit fully in your life constantly
[1:05:01] what happens you're going to drown but
[1:05:04] you need the dry why do you need the dry
[1:05:06] the dry forces your roots down it forces
[1:05:10] you down otherwise you're going to be a
[1:05:11] shallow tree and we don't want to be
[1:05:13] shallow Believers okay because the first
[1:05:16] instance that you have some storm or a
[1:05:18] period where someone is not nice to you
[1:05:21] or doesn't shake your hand say God bless
[1:05:22] you in the right way that you think they
[1:05:23] should then you're all in a
[1:05:26] fluster but that's why God has to put
[1:05:29] you through these dry seasons where you
[1:05:30] don't feel his presence so much it's
[1:05:33] because it's forcing you down into the
[1:05:35] roots it's forcing you down to the
[1:05:38] Rock and because then you're no more
[1:05:41] children tossed to and
[1:05:43] fro you want to be able to handle those
[1:05:45] Seasons where it's just you don't need
[1:05:47] much not not that you don't need the
[1:05:48] present but you don't require God always
[1:05:52] giving you what you think you need all
[1:05:54] all the time he wants mature
[1:05:57] children okay so the end goal of where
[1:06:01] this restoration for us is you know the
[1:06:05] purpose of brother br's Ministry was
[1:06:07] what to to restore the the the faith of
[1:06:09] the children back to the fathers and
[1:06:11] what was it the faith of the fathers it
[1:06:13] was that first church the book of Acts
[1:06:15] church right and what you saw there was
[1:06:18] full Liberty those first from 8033 to
[1:06:20] 8053 you had full word you had full
[1:06:24] dominion and that's where we got to get
[1:06:26] at it is Dominion where you have full
[1:06:28] dominion over your life over your home
[1:06:31] and you're in charge and the devil knows
[1:06:33] it and you know it that way you know at
[1:06:36] that point that you you and your father
[1:06:38] are one and that's that's really where
[1:06:39] restoration is has to
[1:06:42] culminate all right so let's get into it
[1:06:45] so Cyrus the Great was the was the tool
[1:06:48] by
[1:06:49] which um God was going to use to bring
[1:06:52] restoration to Israel okay so cus the
[1:06:54] great was the first official Persian
[1:06:58] king because you got to remember the the
[1:07:00] when Babylon was was destroyed and King
[1:07:02] Bethal shazar was killed it the kingdom
[1:07:05] wasn't just the Persians it was the mes
[1:07:07] and the Persians right so then that's
[1:07:09] why the first king was Darius the me and
[1:07:12] he's the one that you see throws Daniel
[1:07:14] into the lion's den and all that stuff
[1:07:16] and there was Grace I believe for Darius
[1:07:18] you know you see his heart was tender
[1:07:20] towards Daniel but Cyrus is the first
[1:07:23] official Persian king all right fully
[1:07:26] Persian because they eventually defeated
[1:07:27] the mes so if we uh read in isra one
[1:07:33] here now in the first year of cus King
[1:07:36] of Persia that the word of the Lord by
[1:07:37] the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled
[1:07:39] the seven years of captivity the Lord
[1:07:41] stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of
[1:07:43] Persia that he made a proclamation
[1:07:45] throughout all his kingdom and put it
[1:07:47] also in writing saying thus saith Cyrus
[1:07:49] King of Persia the Lord of God of Heaven
[1:07:52] hath given me all the kingdoms of the
[1:07:53] Earth and he has charged me to build him
[1:07:55] a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah
[1:07:58] who is there among you of all his people
[1:08:00] his God be with them and let him go up
[1:08:02] to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build
[1:08:04] a house of the Lord God of Israel he is
[1:08:07] the god uppercase God which is in
[1:08:10] Jerusalem right so what's what's
[1:08:14] uh quite interesting about Cyrus is that
[1:08:17] he was mentioned nearly 200 years before
[1:08:20] by the prophet Isaiah by name and Isa
[1:08:23] isah essentially stated that Cyrus was
[1:08:26] going to be the shepherd upon which
[1:08:28] Israel would be essentially hered back
[1:08:30] to
[1:08:31] Jerusalem so his declaration here is
[1:08:33] that God is the god and I will I have
[1:08:37] been commanded by him to build him a
[1:08:39] house to restore the temple in
[1:08:43] Jerusalem
[1:08:44] so that initiates the process of um the
[1:08:49] Jews are being gathered to
[1:08:50] go Cyrus gives all the the treasures to
[1:08:55] the Jews to bring back to Jerusalem so
[1:08:58] all the treasures that were stolen from
[1:08:59] the temple by Nebuchadnezzar Cyrus gives
[1:09:02] all of it back to the Jews to bring back
[1:09:05] with them to put it in the
[1:09:07] temple so the
[1:09:09] leader sorry the the leader of this wave
[1:09:13] of Exiles was a name called uh was a man
[1:09:15] called zerubabel and there's two names
[1:09:18] for zerubu that you'll see here in Ezra
[1:09:21] the the first one is zerubabel the
[1:09:22] second one is shes
[1:09:25] which is a very exotic name but it's
[1:09:27] interesting how both names coincide
[1:09:29] because zerubabel means a stranger at
[1:09:33] Babylon dispersion of confusion so
[1:09:37] confusion being eradicated is
[1:09:40] essentially what his name means shesh
[1:09:41] Bazar means joy and
[1:09:44] tribulation okay you almost see like one
[1:09:47] name it's almost like uh God knew
[1:09:50] exactly what was going to happen to zuub
[1:09:52] and it plays out exactly
[1:09:55] so he's he's U given the title of
[1:09:57] governor of Judah he's named The Leader
[1:09:59] by Cyrus as they go back into
[1:10:02] Jerusalem and zuub is is a real key
[1:10:05] figure because he's if you look in
[1:10:07] Zechariah he's typed as Christ not only
[1:10:11] coming in uh the time of Christ but also
[1:10:13] in the seven Church ages you know
[1:10:16] there's things where it's you know
[1:10:18] brother brandham is essentially one of
[1:10:20] the things that are listed in relation
[1:10:22] to Z to zerubabel it's
[1:10:24] quite interesting we don't have time to
[1:10:26] get into it but it's quite interesting
[1:10:28] so he was the grandson of uh one of the
[1:10:31] last kings of Judah so he he's in the
[1:10:34] line of Christ so he's one of the
[1:10:37] ancestors of that's listed in the New
[1:10:41] Testament so their Journey takes them
[1:10:44] back to Jerusalem and it's nearly 900
[1:10:46] miles it takes 4 months for them to
[1:10:48] Journey from Babylon to Jerusalem so
[1:10:50] it's a grueling Journey it's uh you know
[1:10:53] fraught with danger and they make it
[1:10:56] back
[1:10:57] okay and when you remember when they
[1:11:01] when they left everything was in flames
[1:11:02] and when they come back it's it was a
[1:11:05] crushing disappointment because this
[1:11:08] once glorious city and land is
[1:11:10] essentially in Ruins it's you know
[1:11:12] riddled by thieves and vagrants and you
[1:11:16] now have the Samaritans and all these
[1:11:18] people kind of coming in and they're
[1:11:20] they they're essentially squatters right
[1:11:23] correct was everywhere the priesthood
[1:11:25] was corrupted everything was vile and
[1:11:27] it's just it's the bottom of the
[1:11:29] barrel so the the Mandate that zul is
[1:11:33] given is is to rebuild the Temple that's
[1:11:36] his one job his job is not to rebuild
[1:11:38] the walls his job is not to you know
[1:11:40] eliminate corruption his job is not any
[1:11:43] of those things his one job that he's
[1:11:44] given is rebuild the Temple at all costs
[1:11:47] no matter what happens build the
[1:11:50] temple so like we alluded to earlier the
[1:11:54] Solomon's Temple at that time was was an
[1:11:56] incredible piece of architecture it's
[1:11:58] it's covered in Gold it's you know like
[1:12:00] I said it was nearly three to6 billion
[1:12:02] dollar in value in terms of what they
[1:12:04] put into it and when it was built the
[1:12:07] dedication of the of the temple was was
[1:12:09] an absolute miraculous event all right
[1:12:12] because when um they brought the Ark of
[1:12:15] the Covenant into the holy of holies
[1:12:17] which is in the back in the very back
[1:12:18] there you can see it on the left there
[1:12:21] once they put the Ark of the Covenant in
[1:12:23] the temple the Shan Glory comes down and
[1:12:25] fills the entire place so the
[1:12:28] essentially a cloud like the one that
[1:12:30] was in the when they were leaving Egypt
[1:12:33] essentially fills the whole Temple
[1:12:35] completely Solomon does a sacrifice and
[1:12:39] God answers it from heaven with fire and
[1:12:41] it burns the entire thing and the shikan
[1:12:44] glory was so strong that the priests
[1:12:46] could not Minister anymore they couldn't
[1:12:47] speak the the the the atmosphere of the
[1:12:50] Lord was so strong so it was an absolute
[1:12:52] miraculous event and from then on you
[1:12:55] know it was there was a daily sacrifice
[1:12:57] the atonement had to occur there the the
[1:12:59] temple was an insanely important
[1:13:02] structure okay why because the the
[1:13:05] presence of God was in the temple that's
[1:13:07] where God chose to dwell was in that
[1:13:09] building in the holy of holies so
[1:13:12] without that there there was no
[1:13:14] atonement and what is atonement it is
[1:13:17] the the the the acceptable sacrifice of
[1:13:20] sin in God's eyes and without that
[1:13:22] atonement they're
[1:13:24] lost so it it it it's it's the number
[1:13:28] one thing that God is saying you have to
[1:13:30] do
[1:13:32] this
[1:13:34] so the temple is a three-chambered
[1:13:36] building so you remember there's the
[1:13:38] outer Court there's the inner court and
[1:13:39] then the most holy of holies and you
[1:13:41] know we see how it types back to us and
[1:13:43] we'll get into it in a
[1:13:45] second um if you read here in Acts
[1:13:50] 7 but Solomon built him a house how be
[1:13:54] it the most high dwelleth not in temples
[1:13:55] made with hands as sayith the prophet
[1:13:57] Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot
[1:13:59] still what house will you build me sayth
[1:14:01] the Lord or what is the place of my rest
[1:14:04] and we read here in the seven Church age
[1:14:07] book Man was created for God man was to
[1:14:10] be the temple of God the place of God's
[1:14:13] rest the Holy Spirit was man the temple
[1:14:16] okay so anything that happens to the
[1:14:20] Jews physically happens to the Gentiles
[1:14:24] spiritually all right so the the the
[1:14:27] place of God's dwelling and the place of
[1:14:29] God's rest in Old Testament times was
[1:14:31] the temple and after the temple was
[1:14:33] finally destroyed God is saying through
[1:14:35] Jesus and the first church is that the
[1:14:39] the the place of his dwelling at that
[1:14:40] point was man's heart right we are the
[1:14:44] temple of God that's where he has chosen
[1:14:47] to what to dwell not a building not a
[1:14:51] church man man's heart
[1:14:56] right all right moving right
[1:15:00] along so they arrive back in
[1:15:06] Jerusalem and they all each one of them
[1:15:09] go goes to their
[1:15:10] cities they get everything cleaned up
[1:15:12] and then they gather into Jerusalem to
[1:15:14] start building the the temple right so
[1:15:18] Ezra 3:1 and when the seventh month was
[1:15:21] come and the children of Israel were in
[1:15:22] the city ities the people gathered
[1:15:24] themselves together as one man to
[1:15:25] Jerusalem then stood up Joshua the son
[1:15:28] of josc and his Brethren the priest and
[1:15:30] zerubabel the son of shiti and his
[1:15:33] Brethren and builded the altar of the
[1:15:35] god of Israel to offer burnt
[1:15:37] offerings thereon as it is written in
[1:15:39] the law of Moses the man of God and they
[1:15:41] set the altar upon his bases for fear
[1:15:44] was upon them because of the people of
[1:15:45] those countries and they offer burnt
[1:15:47] offerings thereon to the Lord even burnt
[1:15:50] offerings morning and evening they kept
[1:15:53] also also the Feast of the Tabernacles
[1:15:54] at is as is written and offered the
[1:15:56] daily burnt offerings by number
[1:15:57] according to the custom as the duty of
[1:16:00] every day required and afterward offered
[1:16:02] the continual burnt offering both of the
[1:16:03] new moons and of the set feasts of the
[1:16:05] Lord that were consecrated and everyone
[1:16:07] that willingly offered a free will
[1:16:09] offering unto the Lord from the first
[1:16:10] day of the seventh month began they to
[1:16:12] offer burnt offerings unto the Lord but
[1:16:14] the foundation of the Temple of the Lord
[1:16:16] was not yet laid so the key phrase there
[1:16:19] is the one that's underlined for fear
[1:16:20] was upon them because of the people of
[1:16:22] those countries
[1:16:23] and fear was a dominating Factor here of
[1:16:26] this first wave okay and it gets them in
[1:16:30] trouble so finally after they get all of
[1:16:33] these um the altar rebuilt and they
[1:16:36] start doing the sacrifices again then
[1:16:37] they finally begin the work of building
[1:16:39] the foundation of the Lord so you got to
[1:16:40] remember the temple is totally in Ruins
[1:16:42] there's not a single Stone left lying
[1:16:44] upon each other it's not a small job
[1:16:47] okay it's huge Stones you see them today
[1:16:50] Mom and Dad saw them and brother Bob and
[1:16:53] uh C Brenda where you go to the The
[1:16:56] Wailing Wall the the stones are massive
[1:17:02] just crazy amount of weight per per
[1:17:05] Stone so it's not a simple job what
[1:17:06] they're
[1:17:08] doing so they begin building the
[1:17:10] foundation and we see in verse 8 now in
[1:17:12] the second year of their coming unto the
[1:17:14] house of God of Jerusalem in the second
[1:17:15] month began
[1:17:17] zerubabel the son of shiel and josua the
[1:17:21] the son of josc and the of their
[1:17:23] Brethren the priests and the Levites and
[1:17:25] all they that were come out of the
[1:17:26] Captivity unto Jerusalem and appointed
[1:17:29] the Levites from 20 years old and upper
[1:17:31] to set forward the work of the house of
[1:17:33] the Lord so let's skip down to verse 10
[1:17:36] and when the builders laid the
[1:17:37] foundation of the Temple of the Lord
[1:17:38] they set the priests in their apparel
[1:17:39] with
[1:17:40] trumpets and the Levites the son of Asaf
[1:17:43] with symbols to praise the Lord after
[1:17:45] the ordinance of David king of Israel
[1:17:47] and they sang together by course and
[1:17:49] praising and giving thanks unto the Lord
[1:17:51] because he is good for his mercy and
[1:17:52] endureth forever toward Israel and all
[1:17:55] the people shouted with a great shout
[1:17:56] when they praised the Lord because of
[1:17:57] the foundation of the house of the Lord
[1:17:59] was laid so this is a hugely significant
[1:18:02] moment right because the Cornerstone has
[1:18:04] been laid the foundation it means that
[1:18:07] worship is coming back to the to
[1:18:10] Jerusalem the presence of God and this
[1:18:13] is why they're they're bringing out the
[1:18:15] musicians and the symbols and and the
[1:18:17] timal and all these things
[1:18:19] but there are those who remember the
[1:18:23] original Temple and the glory of that
[1:18:24] original Temple and the glory of the
[1:18:26] dedication of that Temple and then
[1:18:28] remember stories about it and how it was
[1:18:30] this amazing thing and they remember all
[1:18:32] these
[1:18:33] things and if we go to verse 12 but many
[1:18:36] of the priests and Levites and chief of
[1:18:38] the fathers who were ancient men that
[1:18:40] had seen the first house when the
[1:18:41] foundation of this house was laid Before
[1:18:43] Their Eyes wept with a loud voice and
[1:18:45] many shouted aloud for Joy so that the
[1:18:47] people could not discern the noise of
[1:18:48] the shout of Joy from the noise of the
[1:18:50] Weeping of the people for the people
[1:18:52] shouted with a loud short
[1:18:53] with a loud shout and the noise was
[1:18:55] heard a far off so this is a this is a
[1:18:59] Bittersweet moment for the children of
[1:19:00] Israel right because this second temple
[1:19:04] was was not as large as solon's Temple
[1:19:07] wasn't as Grand as Solomon's Temple you
[1:19:10] didn't have it like the gold and all
[1:19:12] these things they had the treasures but
[1:19:14] they didn't have this this um because
[1:19:16] you remember with with David DAV David
[1:19:19] uh stored up resources he all the
[1:19:22] treasure everything he got was going
[1:19:23] into the temple that rubal did not have
[1:19:26] that luxury so it was a a much more
[1:19:29] modest and
[1:19:30] humble um essentially
[1:19:34] Temple so as things
[1:19:38] go any work of God that happens is going
[1:19:43] to have
[1:19:44] opposition because Satan does not like
[1:19:48] restoration he does not like anything
[1:19:51] good he doesn't like when someone 's
[1:19:53] life is going well he is he is a
[1:19:55] Tormentor he he kills Steals and
[1:19:58] destroys that that's his number one goal
[1:20:02] and you see here that the work of God is
[1:20:04] finally happening everyone's excited
[1:20:07] they're all worshiping you have a
[1:20:09] revival going on and you have opposition
[1:20:12] rise up and not only does it rise up
[1:20:14] it's a it's a powerful resistance that
[1:20:17] happens here it's no small thing that
[1:20:20] happens against them and we'll see here
[1:20:21] how it goes
[1:20:24] so verse uh yeah chapter 4 verse one now
[1:20:28] when the adversaries of Judah and
[1:20:29] Benjamin heard that the children of cap
[1:20:32] of the Captivity builded the temple unto
[1:20:33] the Lord God of Israel so let's pause
[1:20:35] there so the adversaries of Judah and
[1:20:38] Benjamin are
[1:20:40] who they are the Samaritans and the
[1:20:43] Samaritans if you remember were the were
[1:20:47] the result of the
[1:20:49] um the 10 tribes of Israel Maring into
[1:20:53] to the kingdom of Assyria because the
[1:20:56] king of Assyria the son of sakb sent all
[1:20:59] these men into the 10 tribes of Israel
[1:21:01] and married into their women okay and
[1:21:05] what happened is that they had this this
[1:21:08] you had the the mother who is a believer
[1:21:09] of Jehovah you have the father who is a
[1:21:11] pagan and you have this weird mixture of
[1:21:14] the worship of Jehovah and also idolatry
[1:21:17] okay and they did what they were
[1:21:21] commanded by Moses not to do marry the
[1:21:24] heathens of the land okay because
[1:21:27] immediately you see the result of it and
[1:21:29] the
[1:21:30] Samaritans from then onor were a thorn
[1:21:33] in Judah side because they always
[1:21:37] thought they had a right to Jerusalem
[1:21:38] because they were they were also half
[1:21:41] Jewish but they were not willing to let
[1:21:44] go of their idolatry and you see that
[1:21:47] zerubabel you see Nehemiah there's no
[1:21:49] tolerance for it they the they're not
[1:21:52] willing to have any Fellowship
[1:21:54] whatsoever with the
[1:21:55] Samaritans because there are they
[1:21:59] disobeyed the law of Moses they're not
[1:22:00] willing to give up their idolatry and
[1:22:02] they're essentially you can't mix man
[1:22:05] and God and God cannot accept it he
[1:22:07] won't accept it he won't tolerate it and
[1:22:09] the moment that zerubu lets it in you
[1:22:12] have the exact same thing that happened
[1:22:14] happening again and you see what the
[1:22:16] children of Israel there's no
[1:22:18] tolerance verse two then they came to
[1:22:20] zerubabel and to the chief of the
[1:22:22] fathers and said unto him let us build
[1:22:24] with you for we seek your God as you do
[1:22:27] and we do sacrifice unto him since the
[1:22:28] days of asah hardan king of Asher or
[1:22:32] Assyria which brought us up hither so
[1:22:35] they're saying you know we want to
[1:22:37] worship with you we want to help build
[1:22:39] the
[1:22:40] temple but you see here at the beginning
[1:22:42] it says the adversaries of Judah and
[1:22:44] Benjamin so they're coming in sweet
[1:22:46] they're coming in with the honey but
[1:22:48] they got drawn swords behind their back
[1:22:50] they are not for the work of of the
[1:22:52] temple because you see the moment
[1:22:55] they're not told an answer they don't
[1:22:56] like you see their true colors come
[1:22:59] out so zerubabel
[1:23:03] answers but zeruel and Joshua and the
[1:23:05] rest of the chief of the fathers of
[1:23:06] Israel said unto them you have nothing
[1:23:08] to do with us to build a house unto our
[1:23:10] God but we ourselves together will build
[1:23:12] unto the Lord God of Israel as king
[1:23:14] Cyrus the King of Persia hath commanded
[1:23:16] us because that's the other thing the
[1:23:18] Samaritans were not given a
[1:23:20] vision they were not given the King's
[1:23:22] Command the king said to zerubabel you
[1:23:26] build the temple he didn't say to the
[1:23:28] Samaritans you build the temple he said
[1:23:30] it to zerubabel it was Z zerubbabel's
[1:23:33] responsibility alone to do it not anyone
[1:23:37] else he was not given any commandment to
[1:23:40] bring the Samaritan
[1:23:42] in okay
[1:23:45] so how do the Samaritans
[1:23:48] respond verse four then the PE people of
[1:23:51] the land we weakened the hands of the
[1:23:53] people of Judah and troubled them in
[1:23:56] building and hired counselors against
[1:23:58] them to frustrate the purpose all the
[1:23:59] days of cus King of Persia even until
[1:24:02] the reign of Darius King of Persia this
[1:24:04] is not the Darius that um Daniel dealt
[1:24:06] with this is Darius the first the first
[1:24:09] Persian king named
[1:24:11] Darius and we see all these things
[1:24:13] culminate finally in the last chapter of
[1:24:17] um the last verse of um chapter 4 then
[1:24:20] cease the work of the house of God which
[1:24:21] is at Jerusalem so it cease until the
[1:24:23] second year of the reign of Darius King
[1:24:24] of Persia so the opposition that they
[1:24:27] faced from the Samaritans got to such a
[1:24:28] degree that it completely halted the
[1:24:30] work on the temple okay because you see
[1:24:34] here the
[1:24:35] Samaritans they are told
[1:24:39] no and they start conniving they start
[1:24:42] politicking and they start bribing
[1:24:44] officials in the Persian Empire to stop
[1:24:47] the work of the temple and the whole
[1:24:49] thing halts and not only does it halt
[1:24:52] for a moment in time it halts for 17
[1:24:55] years completely grounds to a halt not a
[1:24:59] bit of work is done on the temple and
[1:25:01] what happens is that the Jews get
[1:25:04] complacent they accept that condition as
[1:25:08] a reality and they stop working on the
[1:25:10] temple and they get lazy and they start
[1:25:13] working on their on their own homes and
[1:25:15] they start focusing on their on their
[1:25:16] own lives and things go into a state of
[1:25:19] disrepair okay but the key thing here is
[1:25:23] that there is a prophecy given that the
[1:25:26] temple would be restored the walls would
[1:25:29] be restored and it had to happen there's
[1:25:31] a prophecy hanging over their head and
[1:25:33] it didn't matter what happened it was
[1:25:35] going to happen God himself was going to
[1:25:37] do something about this and at that
[1:25:40] moment the enemies of Israel
[1:25:43] triumphed they thought they had
[1:25:46] it and that is the case in a lot of
[1:25:49] times in our own lives where the devil
[1:25:51] thinks he got us he thinks he got us in
[1:25:53] a corner there's no way out there's no
[1:25:56] way you can move you're done this is
[1:25:58] your reality now accept
[1:26:01] it but he doesn't have the the the the
[1:26:04] shout of the king in the camp he doesn't
[1:26:06] have the king's prophecy hanging over
[1:26:09] what we have we have a vision right and
[1:26:13] that's the purpose of why we come to
[1:26:14] church we come to strengthen that Vision
[1:26:18] that there is a Rapture there is a
[1:26:20] resurrection we will make it that's why
[1:26:22] we have to stay in the presence of God
[1:26:24] because it strength strengthens that
[1:26:26] resolve it strengthens that the the
[1:26:29] purpose in our heart that not only am I
[1:26:32] going to make it into the Rapture but I
[1:26:33] will go into the Rapture thriving not
[1:26:36] only will I go into the Rapture but my
[1:26:37] family will go into the Rapture with me
[1:26:40] my house will be restored etc etc etc so
[1:26:42] that's the thing is that like that's why
[1:26:44] at this point Israel had
[1:26:47] failed and God was going to prove to
[1:26:49] them that despite their failure he was
[1:26:52] going to going to be strong on their
[1:26:55] behalf
[1:26:56] okay so at this point this is a this is
[1:27:00] a critical Junction in time this could
[1:27:02] really go sideways quickly
[1:27:04] here Israel had had had been sold into
[1:27:08] slavery they lost the temple and there
[1:27:10] was this this Mighty work of God
[1:27:12] happening and then it just suddenly hits
[1:27:14] a brick wall and for anyone looking on'
[1:27:16] be like so much for your God so much for
[1:27:20] the Commandment but God was going to
[1:27:22] raise up a man
[1:27:24] right and that man man's name was
[1:27:27] hegi and
[1:27:29] hegi was only on the scene for four
[1:27:33] months but you talk about a candle lit
[1:27:36] on both ends he comes in burning he
[1:27:39] comes in shouting and he comes and he
[1:27:40] leaves screaming he's he you know
[1:27:43] Scholars talk about him it's just like
[1:27:45] he is he comes in the most critical time
[1:27:48] and there was no one more successful
[1:27:49] than hegi within 24 days of he guys
[1:27:52] first sermon they're back at it building
[1:27:54] the Temple after 17 years of lethargy
[1:27:56] and doing nothing 24 days they're back
[1:27:59] at it like nothing happen and you see
[1:28:02] what happens after those 20 days 24 days
[1:28:04] is
[1:28:05] incredible so
[1:28:07] hegi he has the uh second shortest book
[1:28:11] in the
[1:28:12] Bible um I think only Obadiah has one
[1:28:15] chapter and then his obai with with with
[1:28:17] with two chapters and the first the
[1:28:19] first chapter is him tearing the hide
[1:28:23] off the Jews chapter 2 is saying okay
[1:28:26] I've tore the hide off you now do the
[1:28:29] work and you're going to do great okay
[1:28:31] and that's usually how it goes the
[1:28:32] discipline comes and then here's the
[1:28:35] encouragement so HEI and it it and it
[1:28:39] it's actually very beneficial because it
[1:28:41] literally dates each chapter that he's
[1:28:44] preaching so you you know exactly when
[1:28:46] he comes in when he leaves so hegia
[1:28:49] comes on the scene and he's he's he's
[1:28:50] like a a Man on Fire
[1:28:52] so he preaches for 3 months and then you
[1:28:54] have Zachariah come in in November
[1:28:57] because it literally you know exactly
[1:28:59] which month he comes in he comes in
[1:29:01] November he does the same thing rips the
[1:29:04] hide off of him and then gives them
[1:29:06] encouragement and then from then on in
[1:29:08] December hey guys's off the team forever
[1:29:10] we don't hear about hey guy ever again
[1:29:12] so from September to to December hey
[1:29:14] guys is there and he's gone he does his
[1:29:17] job and Zachariah takes over and
[1:29:20] Zachariah his job was to to encourage
[1:29:22] zerubabel to be a support to him but you
[1:29:26] see his switch for Zachariah where he he
[1:29:28] completely changes to prophecy long-term
[1:29:30] prophecy and he there's so many prophecy
[1:29:33] I was just talking to that about there's
[1:29:34] so many Prophecies of Zechariah where it
[1:29:36] has to do with us he talks about uh the
[1:29:39] seven eyes of the Lord and brother
[1:29:41] brandham is one of those seven eyes and
[1:29:42] he talks about the Millennium and he
[1:29:43] talks about so many things that are just
[1:29:46] so applicable to us but we won't be able
[1:29:47] to get into it incredible incredible
[1:29:50] amount of Prophecy happens in z
[1:29:52] um book is kind of second to to Daniel
[1:29:55] in terms of in terms of that
[1:29:57] period
[1:30:01] so if we go to hegi chapter 1 is that
[1:30:06] small is that
[1:30:08] readable maybe she turn to
[1:30:11] heya so it's in the latter um portion of
[1:30:16] um the Old
[1:30:18] Testament if you can read it we can just
[1:30:20] we can just go ahead with it verse one
[1:30:23] in the second year of Darius the king
[1:30:25] and the sixth month in the first day of
[1:30:27] the month came the word of the Lord by
[1:30:29] hegi the prophet unes rubbable the son
[1:30:31] of shiel governor of Judah and to Joshua
[1:30:34] the son of josec the high priest saying
[1:30:36] thus speaketh the Lord of host saying
[1:30:38] this people say this the time is not
[1:30:40] come and the
[1:30:43] time uh I lost my
[1:30:49] place sorry let's start over verse to I
[1:30:52] lost my place thus speaketh the Lord of
[1:30:53] host saying this people say this time is
[1:30:55] not come the time that the Lord's House
[1:30:57] should be built then came the Lord the
[1:31:00] word of the Lord by heah the prophet
[1:31:02] saying is it time for you or ye to dwell
[1:31:05] in your SED houses or panel houses is
[1:31:07] another word for it and this house lith
[1:31:10] waste so he's talking about the temple
[1:31:12] he's the the Jews are saying it's not
[1:31:13] the time for the for the temple to be
[1:31:15] restored so you go from them being in in
[1:31:17] in a place of Revival to saying it's not
[1:31:20] time for the temple to be restored
[1:31:24] verse four is it time for ye oh ye to
[1:31:26] dwell in your side houses in this high
[1:31:28] this house lie waste now therefore
[1:31:31] sayith the Lord of hosts consider your
[1:31:33] ways you have so much and bring in
[1:31:34] little you eat but you have not enough
[1:31:36] you drink but are not filled with drink
[1:31:38] you clothe but there is none warm and he
[1:31:41] that
[1:31:50] earnthenecklace ified sayeth the Lord
[1:31:52] you look for much and low it came to
[1:31:54] little and when you brought it home I
[1:31:56] did blow upon it why sayith the Lord of
[1:31:58] hosts because of mine house that is
[1:32:00] waste and you run every man unto his own
[1:32:02] house therefore the heaven over you is
[1:32:04] stayed from Dew and the Earth is stayed
[1:32:06] from her fruit and I called for a
[1:32:08] drought upon the land and upon the
[1:32:09] mountains and upon the corn and upon the
[1:32:11] new wine and upon the oil and upon that
[1:32:13] which the ground bringeth forth and upon
[1:32:15] man and upon cattle and upon the labor
[1:32:18] of the hands so what happens here they
[1:32:21] they get complacent they say it's not
[1:32:24] time for the temple to be built and they
[1:32:26] focus on building their own houses and
[1:32:28] what happens is that because they focus
[1:32:30] on their own Affairs rather than seeking
[1:32:32] first the kingdom of God essentially HEI
[1:32:35] is saying to them you have tried to
[1:32:37] build and it hasn't worked out for you
[1:32:39] you've tried to put on clothing to stay
[1:32:40] warm and you're still cold you try to
[1:32:42] earn money and you put into purses with
[1:32:44] holes in it it's just falling onto the
[1:32:46] ground you tried to plan but I've
[1:32:48] stopped up the Heavens because you're
[1:32:50] not obeying me I've cursed the land the
[1:32:54] the the rain everything because you are
[1:32:56] not seeking
[1:32:58] me so this is what hegi comes in with
[1:33:01] with both guns blazing and he is saying
[1:33:04] to him you have you have faced
[1:33:07] resistance but you have brought this on
[1:33:09] your own
[1:33:10] head you have allowed the situation to
[1:33:13] drag out because you've gotten
[1:33:16] complacent and what happens here is that
[1:33:19] it's you know type in Shadow for us is
[1:33:20] that if you don't seeking first the
[1:33:22] kingdom of God you're you're you're
[1:33:25] you're you're fighting the
[1:33:27] wind if you don't put God
[1:33:30] first don't expect to be blessed if you
[1:33:33] don't tithe don't expect to be blessed I
[1:33:37] I knew one
[1:33:38] uh son of a minister in the message at
[1:33:41] the time he was struggling he was still
[1:33:43] going to church but he was struggling
[1:33:44] and he decided um he wasn't going to
[1:33:47] tithe anymore so he stops tithing and he
[1:33:50] gets pulled over I think four or five
[1:33:52] times by the
[1:33:53] cops and the exact total in tickets that
[1:33:57] he got total the amount of tithing that
[1:33:59] he owed the
[1:34:02] Lord if you're a child of God you get
[1:34:05] back because it's not your
[1:34:06] money and don't expect to be blessed if
[1:34:08] you're not given not only do your money
[1:34:10] but your
[1:34:12] time God
[1:34:14] wants you to give to him first because
[1:34:17] if you give to him first then he can add
[1:34:20] all these things shall be added unto you
[1:34:23] and the requirement is God first he is
[1:34:24] the foundation of your life you can't
[1:34:27] build on any other Foundation you're
[1:34:28] fighting against yourself and you're
[1:34:30] going to get into trouble and you're
[1:34:32] going to cause everything around you to
[1:34:33] get in trouble
[1:34:36] because yeah you look at aen you know
[1:34:39] you have someone who's not only does it
[1:34:41] affect their their their family it
[1:34:43] affects the church so it we we better
[1:34:46] take heed in terms
[1:34:48] of our lives are not bubbles that are
[1:34:52] just contained to our own home it has a
[1:34:54] ripple effect to everyone around
[1:34:59] you all righty so after the essentially
[1:35:03] the spanking um hegi brings
[1:35:07] encouragement in verse two of chapter 2
[1:35:09] speak now to zerubabel the son of shiel
[1:35:13] govern of Judah and to Joshua the son of
[1:35:14] josec the high priest and to the residue
[1:35:16] of the people saying who is left among
[1:35:18] you that saw this house in her first
[1:35:20] Glory so that he talking about Solomon's
[1:35:22] Temple and how do you see it now is not
[1:35:25] in your in your eyes in comparison of it
[1:35:27] as nothing so he's
[1:35:28] saying for those who have seen the
[1:35:31] Solomon's Temple now that you've seen
[1:35:32] this Temple it's nothing in your
[1:35:35] sight verse four yet now be strong o
[1:35:38] zerubabel sayeth the Lord and be strong
[1:35:40] oh Joshua son of josec the high priest
[1:35:42] and be strong all you people of the land
[1:35:44] sayeth the Lord and work for I'm with
[1:35:45] you say the Lord of hosts according to
[1:35:47] the work that I have Covenant with you
[1:35:48] when you came out of Egypt so my spirit
[1:35:51] remaineth among you fear ye not for thus
[1:35:53] sayith the Lord of hosts yet once it is
[1:35:55] a little while and I will shake the
[1:35:57] heavens and the earth and the Sea and
[1:35:59] the dry land and I will shake All
[1:36:00] Nations and the desire of all Nations
[1:36:02] shall come and I will fill this house
[1:36:04] with Glory said the Lord of hosts the
[1:36:06] silver is mine and the gold is mine said
[1:36:08] the Lord of hosts the glory of this
[1:36:10] latter house shall be greater than of
[1:36:12] the former said the Lord of hosts and
[1:36:13] this is the place will I give peace
[1:36:16] saith the Lord of hosts and what is and
[1:36:19] who is the day of days
[1:36:23] Christ that psalmist Temple had the Shan
[1:36:25] of Glory it had the Ark of the Covenant
[1:36:28] you had a miracle of the fire coming
[1:36:30] down but you had the the culmination of
[1:36:33] the ages you had the the the person of
[1:36:35] whom all nature was crying for you had
[1:36:38] the person who all the prophets were
[1:36:39] proclaiming walking not in Solomon's
[1:36:42] Temple but in zerubbabel's little humble
[1:36:47] Temple and the the the latter Glory was
[1:36:50] greater than the former glory GL why
[1:36:51] because the culmination of all ages was
[1:36:54] Walking The Halls teaching preaching and
[1:36:56] healing in those
[1:36:58] corridors so that's why he was saying it
[1:37:01] doesn't matter how small it is the day
[1:37:03] of days is going to walk in these halls
[1:37:06] and not only is he will I shake Nations
[1:37:09] but through him I will bring peace in
[1:37:11] this
[1:37:14] Temple so then Zechariah Falls
[1:37:17] suit
[1:37:19] and he provides encouragement for zerubu
[1:37:24] then he answered and spake unto me
[1:37:25] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:37:27] rubul saying not by might nor by power
[1:37:30] but by my spirit say the Lord of hosts
[1:37:32] who art thou oh great Mountain before
[1:37:34] zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and
[1:37:36] he shall bring forth The Headstone
[1:37:37] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[1:37:39] Grace unto it moreover the word of the
[1:37:41] Lord came unto me saying the hands of
[1:37:43] zerubabel have laid the foundation of
[1:37:45] this house his hands shall also finish
[1:37:47] it and thou shalt know that the Lord of
[1:37:49] hosts has sent me unto you for who who
[1:37:51] hath despised the day of small things
[1:37:54] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[1:37:56] plummet in the hand of zerubabel with
[1:37:57] those seven they are the eyes of the
[1:37:59] Lord which run to and fro throughout the
[1:38:01] whole earth and that that brother Braham
[1:38:03] says the these are the seven Church AE
[1:38:05] Messengers they are the eyes they are
[1:38:07] the eyes running to and fro throughout
[1:38:10] the whole earth and they they they were
[1:38:12] rejoicing because of the plummet of Zer
[1:38:15] and what is a plummet line it's it's the
[1:38:17] thing that determines if something is
[1:38:19] plum straight up and down is it accurate
[1:38:23] and in the hand of zerel is the plum
[1:38:25] line and he was establishing what is
[1:38:27] true what is straight and what is
[1:38:29] correct and they Rejoice because of
[1:38:32] it and Christ was the one he was he
[1:38:35] fulfilled the law and he was the one who
[1:38:38] paid the debt of sin and he was the one
[1:38:39] who established that through my spirit
[1:38:43] the church would overcome not by not by
[1:38:45] might nor by power but by my spirit
[1:38:47] sayeth the Lord and this is what uh
[1:38:49] brother Braham is saying is that the
[1:38:51] seven Church age cry is not by might nor
[1:38:54] by power but by my spirit sayith the
[1:38:56] lord it's not through your own abilities
[1:38:57] it's not through your own strengths or
[1:38:59] your tools or your Ambitions your dreams
[1:39:00] or whatever it's by his Spirit alone
[1:39:04] because he can't do it yourself you look
[1:39:05] at the Jews they failed over and over
[1:39:09] but through his
[1:39:11] Spirit greater is he that is in you than
[1:39:14] he that is in the
[1:39:16] world
[1:39:18] okay so you see here that the work stop
[1:39:21] for 17
[1:39:22] years
[1:39:25] and it looks like the Samaritans had won
[1:39:29] they even to convince the Persians to be
[1:39:31] on their side it looked
[1:39:34] impossible so God sent hegi and
[1:39:37] Zechariah and they they they rebuke him
[1:39:40] this is where you're this is where
[1:39:41] you're wrong this is not just all the
[1:39:43] Samaritans fault you had you have let
[1:39:45] things slide yourself okay and you got
[1:39:48] to get back in line and once you're in
[1:39:49] line now
[1:39:51] I'll give you the strength that you need
[1:39:52] to finish the job so you have all these
[1:39:55] encouragements and you see how zable and
[1:39:58] the people are going to react then
[1:40:00] zerubabel the son of shiel and Joshua
[1:40:02] the son of josec the high priest with
[1:40:03] all the remnant of the people obeyed the
[1:40:05] voice of the Lord their God and the
[1:40:06] words of hegi the Prophet as the Lord
[1:40:09] their God has sent him and the people
[1:40:10] did fear before the Lord then spake hegi
[1:40:13] the Lord's messenger in the Lord's
[1:40:15] message unto the people saying I Am with
[1:40:17] You sayeth the Lord and the Lord stirred
[1:40:20] up the spirit of zerubu the son of shiel
[1:40:22] governor of Judah and the spirit of
[1:40:23] Joshua the son of josec the high priest
[1:40:25] and the spirit of all the remnant of the
[1:40:27] people and they came and did in the
[1:40:28] house of the Lord of hosts their
[1:40:32] God
[1:40:34] so things finally start
[1:40:37] moving so the Samaritans see this effort
[1:40:41] so I'm going to start summarizing
[1:40:43] because we're going to run out of
[1:40:45] time so they they come up to him and
[1:40:47] said who who's commanded you to start
[1:40:48] building the wall in the temple again
[1:40:52] what authori is and they they start
[1:40:54] questioning the Jews and then zeruel
[1:40:57] gives an answer we're doing this because
[1:40:58] Cyrus the Great commanded us to do this
[1:41:01] and he's commanded that we build the
[1:41:04] temple and that's who we answer
[1:41:06] to so the Samaritans send a letter to
[1:41:09] Darius the King of Persia essentially
[1:41:12] saying uh and I'll skip to
[1:41:16] it the final bit here verse 17 now
[1:41:20] therefore if it good to the king Let
[1:41:22] There Be search made in the king's
[1:41:23] Treasure House which is there at Babylon
[1:41:25] where there be so that a decree was made
[1:41:27] of Cyrus the king to build this house of
[1:41:28] God of Jerusalem and let the king send
[1:41:30] his pleasure to us concerning this
[1:41:32] matter so they're saying the Jews have
[1:41:34] said the cus the Great have done this
[1:41:36] can you check in your in your record
[1:41:38] house to ensure whether they actually
[1:41:41] actually are telling the truth or not so
[1:41:43] at this point the Samaritans have done a
[1:41:45] a great misdeed to themselves and they
[1:41:49] have essentially poke the bear without
[1:41:52] realizing it so by doing
[1:41:54] this they by essentially saying we don't
[1:41:59] believe zable that he's actually doing
[1:42:01] the work of sarus the great we think
[1:42:03] he's lying so check in in in your
[1:42:05] records and see if he if he is lying so
[1:42:07] the thing is if they're wrong it's going
[1:42:10] to be a bad time and if they're right
[1:42:11] then the work
[1:42:13] stops so King
[1:42:17] Darius essentially
[1:42:19] he um and let's just read it just clear
[1:42:22] that way then Darius the king made a
[1:42:23] decree and search was made in the house
[1:42:25] of the rolls where the treasures were
[1:42:26] laid up in Babylon and there was found
[1:42:28] at aam actha in the palace that is in
[1:42:30] the province of the mes a role and
[1:42:33] therein was a record thus written in the
[1:42:35] first year of sarus the king the same
[1:42:38] King uh the king made a decree
[1:42:40] concerning the house of God at Jerusalem
[1:42:43] let the house be builded the place where
[1:42:44] they offer sacrifices and let the
[1:42:46] foundations thereof be strongly laid the
[1:42:48] height thereof of three score cubits and
[1:42:50] the breath thereof three score cubits
[1:42:52] with three rows of great stones and a
[1:42:54] row of new Timber let the expenses be
[1:42:57] given out of the King's house and also
[1:42:59] let the gold and silver vessels of the
[1:43:01] house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took
[1:43:03] forth out of the temple which is at
[1:43:04] Jerusalem and brought unto Babylon be
[1:43:06] restored and brought again unto the
[1:43:08] temple which is at Jerusalem everyone to
[1:43:10] his place and place them in the house of
[1:43:12] God so Darius in a nutshell has said has
[1:43:15] just has just read okay Zu is right so
[1:43:20] here darias then writes a letter back to
[1:43:22] the
[1:43:24] Samaritans verse six now therefore
[1:43:27] tanite Governor beyond the river sheth
[1:43:30] bazai and your companions the aites
[1:43:33] which are beyond the river be far from
[1:43:35] then let the work of this house of God
[1:43:37] alone let the governor of the Jews and
[1:43:40] the Elder of the Jews build this house
[1:43:42] of God in his place moreover I make a
[1:43:44] decree what ye shall do to the Elders of
[1:43:46] these Jews for the building of this
[1:43:47] house of God that of the king's Goods
[1:43:49] even of the tribute beyond the river
[1:43:51] forwith expenses be given unto these men
[1:43:53] that they be not hindered and that which
[1:43:55] they have need of both young Bullocks
[1:43:57] and Rams and Lambs for the burnt
[1:43:58] offerings of the god of Heaven wheat
[1:44:00] salt wine and oil according to the
[1:44:02] appointment of the priests which are at
[1:44:04] Jerusalem let it be given them day by
[1:44:06] day without fail that they may offer
[1:44:09] sacrifices of sweet Savers unto the god
[1:44:11] of heaven and pray for the life of the
[1:44:13] king and of his sons also I have made a
[1:44:15] decree that whosoever shall alter this
[1:44:17] word let Timber be pulled down from his
[1:44:19] house and being set up let him be hanged
[1:44:21] thereon and let his house be made a
[1:44:23] dungill for this and the god that had
[1:44:25] caused his name to dwell there destroy
[1:44:27] all Kings and people that shall put to
[1:44:29] their hand to alter and to destroy this
[1:44:31] house of God which is at Jerusalem I
[1:44:33] Darius have made a decree let it be done
[1:44:36] with speed so this is a doozy okay there
[1:44:39] a lot to unpack here so Darius is
[1:44:41] essentially saying okay you are now
[1:44:44] messing with a Royal Decree of Cyrus so
[1:44:47] this is what's going to happen
[1:44:49] Samaritans you you are going to leave
[1:44:51] them alone you are not going to hinder
[1:44:53] the work not only are you not going to
[1:44:54] hinder the work you're going to pay for
[1:44:56] the construction of this Temple out of
[1:44:58] your own pockets and out of the treasury
[1:45:01] and not only will you do that you'll
[1:45:02] provide cattle and you'll provide
[1:45:04] sacrifices so they can do their daily
[1:45:06] sacrifices not only that you're going to
[1:45:09] provide all the ingredients that they
[1:45:10] need for that the salt and the wine and
[1:45:13] the wheat all these things you're going
[1:45:14] to provide to them every day so they can
[1:45:17] sacrifice unto their God because I don't
[1:45:19] want to mess with their God I've heard
[1:45:21] about their God and you see he said like
[1:45:24] I whoever Alters this let them be
[1:45:26] destroyed by their
[1:45:27] God and the final thing
[1:45:30] is if you don't do any of
[1:45:33] this what's going to happen is that in
[1:45:36] each of your homes the main beam out of
[1:45:39] the house will be set up and you will be
[1:45:41] hanged upon it and then your house will
[1:45:42] be turned into a dung Hill dung is
[1:45:45] another word for manure okay it will be
[1:45:47] turned into a house of absolute
[1:45:50] grossness in the Amplified Bible it it
[1:45:53] it says the beam of the house will be
[1:45:55] taken out and you will be impaled upon
[1:45:56] it so whatever one you want to go with
[1:45:59] both ends are not nice the ingredients
[1:46:01] are death and suffering so he's saying
[1:46:05] here you will obey them you will not
[1:46:08] mess with them you will pay for
[1:46:09] everything you will provide everything
[1:46:11] for them every day and as of they if
[1:46:13] they need something else you will give
[1:46:14] it to them if you don't listen to this
[1:46:16] or alter this order you will be
[1:46:19] destroyed and your house
[1:46:21] filled with
[1:46:22] dung and not only that I have made this
[1:46:25] decree I'm putting my name behind this
[1:46:27] not only am I saying obey Cyrus I'm
[1:46:30] putting my own name behind this the full
[1:46:32] authority of the Persian Kingdom the
[1:46:34] greatest Kingdom at the time you will
[1:46:36] listen to this and you will do it with
[1:46:43] speed what part in this did Rubble
[1:46:47] play not my not by might not by power
[1:46:51] but by my spirit sayith the Lord what
[1:46:54] did zerubabel do he answered to them and
[1:46:57] said I'm obeying my king that's who I'm
[1:47:01] listening
[1:47:02] to that's all he did he witnessed of his
[1:47:06] purpose and the enemy made a noose for
[1:47:09] his own neck just like
[1:47:11] hmon and what's funny is that the the
[1:47:14] circum sense of hmon happens right after
[1:47:16] this the next king after Darius was
[1:47:18] Xerxes and he uh and in uh in the Bible
[1:47:22] he's his Hebrew name is Aeris and he
[1:47:25] marries Esther so this whole season is a
[1:47:29] season of the Jews are just in their
[1:47:31] position they are just doing what they
[1:47:34] need to do in order to worship God and
[1:47:37] Obey him every day and these enemies are
[1:47:38] coming against
[1:47:40] them and all all they got to do is
[1:47:43] witness of who they are witness of their
[1:47:45] purpose of their vision and God was
[1:47:48] going to take care of the rest
[1:47:51] nothing
[1:47:52] else not by might nor by power but by my
[1:47:56] spirit sayith the
[1:47:57] Lord a total Miracle after 17
[1:48:02] years they start they start to get
[1:48:05] resistance again here we go again but
[1:48:08] you look at the difference that where
[1:48:09] zerubabel he's saying to them we're
[1:48:11] doing the work that sarus told us if you
[1:48:14] have a problem with that go to the
[1:48:17] king and they brought destruction their
[1:48:20] on their own
[1:48:21] head so you look what happens
[1:48:24] next then Tatai governor on this side of
[1:48:26] the river sheth banai and their
[1:48:29] companions according to that which
[1:48:30] Darius the king had sent so they did
[1:48:32] speedily and the Elders of the Jews
[1:48:34] builded and they prospered through the
[1:48:35] prophesying of hegi the prophet and
[1:48:37] Zachariah the son of Ido and they build
[1:48:39] it and finished it according to the
[1:48:40] Commandment of the god of Israel and
[1:48:42] according to the Commandment of Cyrus
[1:48:43] and Darius and art exes King of Persia
[1:48:46] and this house was finished on the third
[1:48:48] day of the month of Dar which is in the
[1:48:50] sixth year of the reign of darus the
[1:48:52] king and the children of Israel the
[1:48:54] priests and Levites and the rest of the
[1:48:56] children of the Captivity kept the
[1:48:58] dedication of this house of God with
[1:49:01] joy the temple was
[1:49:05] restored atonement was
[1:49:08] back and God's commandment was
[1:49:12] fulfilled and they didn't do anything
[1:49:15] all they did was their job the
[1:49:17] Commandment that God gave them was to
[1:49:18] build the temple the Commandment was not
[1:49:21] fight the Samaritans if they come after
[1:49:22] you and try to justify yourself to them
[1:49:25] and no what what was their job build the
[1:49:28] temple don't focus on anything don't let
[1:49:31] anything else distract you or pull you
[1:49:32] away from the job that you've been
[1:49:34] given because the job that you have
[1:49:37] given
[1:49:39] is it's so
[1:49:41] critical because you look at you know
[1:49:45] the I forget the the exact verse and how
[1:49:47] it goes in where Paul talks about how
[1:49:50] the house of God is fitly put fitly
[1:49:53] together and
[1:49:55] each fitly framed together and brother
[1:49:58] brandom talks about how the Stars
[1:50:00] influence each other by staying in their
[1:50:03] place because if you have you look at
[1:50:05] this at our solar
[1:50:08] system and you you look at someone like
[1:50:10] uh like Jupiter Jupiter is just a big
[1:50:13] ball of gas but it is it is such a
[1:50:17] critical structure in the solar system
[1:50:19] because it's Gra is is second to that of
[1:50:21] the Sun so what happens is is most
[1:50:23] asteroids that have Earth's name on it
[1:50:25] are pulled in by Jupiter so you have
[1:50:29] this big giant mass that's just
[1:50:32] essentially plain safety for the Earth
[1:50:34] and if that that planet was out of the
[1:50:37] way Earth would be pummeled by
[1:50:40] asteroids and you look at like if if if
[1:50:42] the moon if the the small the smallest
[1:50:45] of planets if the moon was moved away by
[1:50:47] a certain degree there would be floods
[1:50:49] everywhere
[1:50:51] so each of these things have an
[1:50:54] incredible effect on one another and you
[1:50:57] look at a church the smallest person the
[1:51:00] most insignificant humble person who may
[1:51:02] not have a a big position in the church
[1:51:04] has an influence in a pool on that
[1:51:07] church and and the person who who may
[1:51:10] have the biggest job you don't know how
[1:51:12] many things are they getting hit with
[1:51:15] that are getting are meant for
[1:51:16] you you don't realize how how the people
[1:51:19] going in front of you have have suffered
[1:51:21] just to such a degree that's why you
[1:51:23] give honor to the elderly that's why you
[1:51:25] give honor to the pastor double honor is
[1:51:28] is is what scripture says it's because
[1:51:30] you don't know what they go through in
[1:51:32] order to protect the
[1:51:35] Sheep you don't know half of it I you
[1:51:38] don't know half of it so you look at
[1:51:41] like our positions are so critical a
[1:51:43] mother how critical is a mother in terms
[1:51:46] of the the trajectory of a of of a uh of
[1:51:49] a child
[1:51:50] or a
[1:51:51] father all these things have influence
[1:51:54] upon each other and if you move one out
[1:51:57] of the way it it it it Causes Chaos in a
[1:51:59] church in a home
[1:52:02] anywhere and it goes to show that like
[1:52:04] no matter the obstacle that that that
[1:52:06] comes against
[1:52:07] us our job is not to
[1:52:10] fight you look at you look at what Moses
[1:52:12] said to the Egyptians God LED them to a
[1:52:15] dead end to a to to a red sea and all he
[1:52:19] said is look at the
[1:52:20] Egyptians they're going to be no
[1:52:23] more and what was their job their job
[1:52:25] was to believe Moses that's it believe
[1:52:28] it and the thing is is that God is
[1:52:31] bringing us to these Red Sea moments
[1:52:33] where it's just you're looking at a big
[1:52:35] giant wall of water and behind you
[1:52:37] there's a big army coming in behind you
[1:52:39] and you're about to get
[1:52:42] Squat and if they went in any other
[1:52:44] direction but towards that sea they
[1:52:46] would have
[1:52:47] died and you look at these situations
[1:52:49] that we get ourselves in or it just so
[1:52:52] happens we may not be putting ourselves
[1:52:54] in those situations but those Red Sea
[1:52:56] moments there they're so critical
[1:52:59] because you know the the Rapture is is
[1:53:02] is not this this big boom thing the the
[1:53:07] Rapture is is an event okay it's a
[1:53:09] process but it's also an event and it's
[1:53:11] it's a stepping stone and while God what
[1:53:14] God's doing with each trial that you're
[1:53:15] going through is a stepping stone
[1:53:17] towards the Rapture and and that's why
[1:53:19] we we we kind of pych yourselves out
[1:53:20] because we we see you know the Rapture
[1:53:22] is this big thing you know I'm not going
[1:53:24] to be ready for it but you don't realize
[1:53:26] that like he says here Zer Rubble he
[1:53:29] started the building and he'll finish it
[1:53:31] Christ who started the work in you is
[1:53:32] going to finish it and the Rapture is
[1:53:34] just going to be an event another
[1:53:35] stepping stone another opportunity where
[1:53:37] God is saying just trust
[1:53:41] me and that's why these little events in
[1:53:44] your life are little opportunities for
[1:53:46] you to get a bit more
[1:53:47] faith a little bit more Trust
[1:53:51] because he's going to be testing those
[1:53:53] areas that you're weak in you
[1:53:55] know and he's going to be doing it
[1:53:57] constantly and each opportunity each
[1:54:00] moment of trust is building that a bit
[1:54:03] by bit in order for you when you finally
[1:54:06] get to the precipice you got one step
[1:54:07] left it's just another moment of saying
[1:54:10] I trust you and boom you're
[1:54:14] gone so that's why you thank God for
[1:54:18] these these
[1:54:20] these trials and these
[1:54:21] tribulations because there are
[1:54:23] opportunities of growth and there's
[1:54:25] there are opportunities where he can
[1:54:27] show you I am strong on your behalf you
[1:54:30] just got to trust me you got you got to
[1:54:32] stop thinking here and stop thinking of
[1:54:35] like well it's not possible God does not
[1:54:36] dwell in the realm of possibility he
[1:54:38] went from a temple that was was laying
[1:54:41] dormant for 17 years to a fully funded
[1:54:44] construction
[1:54:46] project fully paid for within 24
[1:54:51] days God is Not constrained by space
[1:54:54] time or matter he can open up a wall in
[1:54:58] front of you and say this is your way
[1:55:00] out and it can happen in a
[1:55:03] moment so all we have to do is realize
[1:55:06] that he is the gentle
[1:55:08] Shepherd and he gently leads his
[1:55:11] children along and you you'll have these
[1:55:14] moments where you're you're afraid and
[1:55:16] you're
[1:55:17] frightened but that's where it's just
[1:55:19] you have to go to him and you
[1:55:30] you you know it's
[1:55:35] um God requires the most out of this
[1:55:38] this age because it's the darkest age
[1:55:41] it's the furnace has been stoked seven
[1:55:44] times hotter it's the most deceitful age
[1:55:47] it's the hardest age
[1:55:50] it's the most amount of
[1:55:52] pressure the most amount of
[1:55:55] deception it it it's
[1:55:59] um but you look at it and God God has
[1:56:02] has left the best for
[1:56:04] last he's left the the the apple of his
[1:56:07] eye for this moment in time for for such
[1:56:10] a time as this Esther you have been
[1:56:13] chosen and prepared for
[1:56:14] this it's the same thing little bride
[1:56:18] you have for such a moment as this you
[1:56:21] have been you've been molded and
[1:56:23] prepared for
[1:56:24] this and you look at these moments in
[1:56:27] our lives and it's just you realize it
[1:56:30] doesn't happen all the time but you
[1:56:31] realize it for such a time as the moment
[1:56:33] that you're in he has prepared you for
[1:56:35] it and all you got to do all you got to
[1:56:38] do is take one step at a time that's all
[1:56:41] he
[1:56:42] requires your word is a lamp unto my
[1:56:44] feet and a light unto my path a p a lamp
[1:56:47] a lamp is not like a flashlight where it
[1:56:49] shines out a lamp shines
[1:56:52] down so that and you only see a couple
[1:56:55] steps in front of you and that's the way
[1:56:59] he's ordained for us we see a couple
[1:57:01] steps at a time in front of you and you
[1:57:04] got to trust that wherever you're going
[1:57:06] is not leading towards a big pit or a
[1:57:09] bunch of lions or whoever that's where
[1:57:12] you got to trust the tender hand of
[1:57:13] Jehovah that no matter where he leads
[1:57:15] you it's going to be threaded
[1:57:18] perfectly
[1:57:20] so as we clue
[1:57:25] up here in 1957 time tested Memorials of
[1:57:28] God every time a wind hits a tree and
[1:57:30] shoves it back and forth and back and
[1:57:32] forth it only loosens The Roots so it
[1:57:33] can grow deeper and get a better
[1:57:35] hold every time sickness strikes your
[1:57:37] home every time trial strikes your home
[1:57:39] every time the neighbors say something
[1:57:40] bad about you it's only shaking you
[1:57:42] loosening you up so you can get down and
[1:57:44] get a better hold in the Eternal Rock of
[1:57:46] God's immovable word that's how God does
[1:57:48] it he sends those trials to test you and
[1:57:50] to prove you shake you up and to give
[1:57:52] you a new
[1:57:53] hold if the musicians want to come and
[1:57:56] we can
[1:57:57] stand we read here in um Psalm 20 the
[1:58:02] Lord hear thee in the day of trouble the
[1:58:05] name of the god of Jacob defend thee

[1:58:19] name of our God we will set up our
[1:58:21] banners the Lord fulfill all thy
[1:58:22] petitions now know I that the Lord saves
[1:58:26] his anointed he will hear from his holy
[1:58:29] heaven with the saving strength of his
[1:58:30] right hand some trust in chariots and
[1:58:33] some in horses but we will remember the
[1:58:34] name of the Lord Our God they are
[1:58:36] brought down and Fallen but we are risen
[1:58:37] and stand upright save Lord let the king
[1:58:40] hear us when we

[1:58:44] eyes of the Lord run to and fro
