indeed come to us amen well he give the promise he said i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you amen to god be the glory i trust we're believing it i trust we're experiencing it amen what he said he's doing praise the name of the lord so the lord bless us as we go further into the word again with our brother jonathan amen i just wanted to pass along the greetings to our sister sandy curlett and i said i want to get up there personally and welcome her amen after well we ministered to her son who's going to preach tonight ministered to him for maybe 20 odd years and we ministered to sister sandy for about 20 years and so on and our family so we're thankful the lord has brought them back again amen for fellowship oh yes praise the lord brother i will put it this way if i trust we're going to meet again in a better place amen yeah and we'll be young and praise the lord and now it's a revelation to us the old will be young there forever amen transformed in a moment of time and a mortal will stand in his likeness the moon as the sun destroys to and shine by the grace of god i trust brother god is giving us that faith and increasing that faith more and more and more if there's anything brother the ministry of the word it's not just to let us know it's the end it does not let us know god did this god did that but what is god doing amen and what does god want you to do what does god want want you to think on him and meditate on oh my and and oh yeah to govern you in these last days brothers not just come to church because oh i'm in the message i'm trying to go into church no no not by any means brother it is a spiritual responsibility that we have brother praise the lord it is not just going to church it's getting ready for the resurrection it is getting ready for the rapture and we what are we going to church for is to hear the word and get a greater and a greater faith for the resurrection a greater and a greater faith for the rapture amen so the old brother with that it'll come to the place where we won't be able to get away from it no no morning noon and night it'll be with us and in us and we'll be constantly looking up looking up amen for the resurrection for the rapture looking for the change amen and brother the more we see going on in the world such as this covenant 19 issue it's not it's just not we don't think about that the way the world thinks about it no but we think about it the way the bible warns us amen concerning these things that are going to come up on the earth oh brother oh my and and just think it's not just newfoundland it's not just canada it's the whole world that's influenced by what is going on in college 19. so brother sister don't take it lightly i i don't think oh that'll be all right that come and it'll it'll go well i'll tell you that if it goes something else is going to follow it and i'll tell you this it's going to get even more serious so brother i i trust as the world gets more and more serious facing what's going on in the world i trust that we're going to get more serious when it comes to the revelation of the word when it comes to what god has reminded us concerning the resurrection and rapture and again the power of god has highlighted the fact concerning the opening of the seven seals the mystery of god he said what is it why has god done all that and why is he doing all this it is he said it is for rapturing faith amen and one of the last messages that the prophet preached he highlighted again concerning what god had done and what god was doing and he said the whole thing is to give us rapturing faith so brothers i trust by the hearing of the word by the ministry of the word that that we're going that the rapture is going to get even more and more and more real to us we just won't be able to shake it we won't be able to get away from it if oh you're a seed of god oh most definitely you won't be able to just go on and think this and think that and just be religious no you're spiritual and if you're spiritual you're caught up with what god is doing or religious or that's what god did and what god will do but brother we need to be spiritual so we identify with what he's doing amen and there's too many as i said around the message now oh yeah oh yeah they're just worshiping now god what god did what god did he said the prophet he did this he did that yeah but what is it accomplishing in you and me amen praise the name of the lord what does it really mean to you and me what effect and what influence is it having on the bride oh brother if if if the brightest has caught it the bride believes it i'll tell you they're bright just looking to get out of here oh yeah well as i said just pray for your family pray for your friends pray for your neighbors leave them with the lord and move on amen because if we're going to say oh i've got to wait for this i got to wait for that no if we're going to take that attitude we'll never get out of here there'll never be a resurrection there'll never be a rapture if we're just thinking oh i'm going to wait i want the lord to wait till this one my son sees this my daughter sees this husband sees this wife sees that you leave it with the lord amen god has given us through the word the ministry of the word and the mystery of god he has given us the responsibility of the resurrection he's given us the responsibility of the rapture and again this confirms what the prophet warned us he said god is waiting on us and the dead in christ are waiting on us and waiting by the grace of god amen so i pray the grace of god brother oh don't let him wait any longer lord we want to get out of here amen and we're longing lord now to get into your presence we've we worship you and we and we've heard about you and we heard the revelation the words you gave us in these last days what you've done in these last days and again lord i pray grace as the prophet challenged us to see the other angel amen oh that people see this angel that angel this one that one william branham but brother who's seeing jesus amen who is seeing jesus i tell you this if there's anyone that is revealed in what god has done through the ministry of a prophet it's jesus amen because even even pentecostals and even others who don't believe this message that they they feel the same thing concerning william brown's ministry they said my even though they disagree with his teachings yet he says when it comes to his ministry and he and his life and the anointing upon him he said oh my he said it's just exactly he said like jesus christ amen oh is it to say the same thing he said that they experienced 2 000 years ago when the word was made flesh and amen to redeem us spiritually amen so the exact same thing brother god did in this hour please i pray grace we're not going to visit i pray grace we haven't missed it amen but brother grace now to the extent that god what god did what god's doing god god will do is revealed in you and me amen and you and me are reflecting it by the grace of god oh yeah that's why the people look at you and our brother jonathan was bringing it out concerning you you're a christian and so on amen because why you're going to live christ amen now that you're going to live and reflect like what christ is doing amen and what he will do oh yeah oh praise the name of the lord you go right on back to moses and coming out of egypt and so on what was god doing he had to get involved in that praise the lord he did this he did that amen brother we got to identify with god in the present tense yeah so that all we are so that he he can expect us by grace by grace expect us to be there to do what he's ordained what he's prophesied amen so brother again don't don't let god wait any longer for the resurrection don't let god wait any longer for the rapture i pray grace that's through the ministry of our brother jonathan's word the ministry of the word through our brother jonathan's ministry is going to give us more and more and more resurrection and rapturing faith a greater and a greater revelation of the resurrection a greater revelation of the rapture amen so that now god is making it flesh in you and me brother if the word is fleshing you and me oh it is we're not going to go there and and just oh re manifest this church in that church or when it comes to that this doctrine that doctrine no no if it's in you and me the word made flesh oh if there's anything we're focusing on what did mo moses focus on amen what does the true visual focus on to get out of egypt amen what is the right focusing on to get out amen god has delivered us the prophet sir from from a denominational egyptian bondage amen by the grace of god but brother he didn't just bring us out and leave us there no no he didn't just bring him out of israel and leave him in the wilderness that was their choice amen no he he brought them in amen he brought us out thank god for what he did through the ministry of the prophets and i thank god for what he's doing through the ministry of the word today what was he doing just getting us more and more into oneness with christ amen the word in flesh to redeem us physically amen praise the lord this robot flesh will drop and rise and seize the everlasting price amen by the grace of god and if this cast his body down well we got a glorified body amen oh yes without the old body going back to the dust but praise the lord we're going into our glory find one thank jesus for redemption what redemption oh brother is not just coming oh wonderful this doctrines and hear the ministry preaching oh i pray god that we're getting the faith that he's that he's endeavoring to get to us because faith comes by hearing the word i pray grace that we get the faith that god has ordained for us to get tonight through the hearing of the word amen so that you're living for the lord you're living for the resurrection you're living for the rapture amen you're you're living to get to get back where we come from amen oh brother see in all the revelations that god gave job gave him this cave of this and he knew this and he do this about god but but but everything came down to the revelation of where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth job where were you when the morning stars shame together and the sons of god shut it for joy amen job do you know where you come from oh he knew god was with him he knew god was blessing him amen oh yeah because god was god in the present tense amen but god gave him a greater revelation of where he come from and where he was going amen so now he said oh lord thank you for what you did thank you for what you did lord we want to give you give the be a witness to the world for what you are doing not what you did not what you will do but what you are doing oh brother because most of you today they identified with what god has done amen well what god will do but the bride is here praise the lord what are you what are you getting into we're into what god's doing amen praise the lord so what so that god is not waiting on us amen so the bride is not waiting on us oh they're looking forward to what they're expecting oh that they're they're on their way brother if they are on their way to us we're on our way to them by the grace of god amen and brother it's not just jesus coming now he has come yeah he has come now now they're looking for us to come back into eternity praise the lord because he that came in us is in us to take us back by the grace of god to god be the glory amen so again we want to turn it over to our brother jonathan for the going forth of the word but be in the spirit amen so that it's not going to be this the intellectual letter but you're going to catch the spiritual revelation amen that's motivating our brother jonathan oh yeah it's not just oh the the letter of the word oh i think i'll preach it with that i think i preach with that no no you want to preach what god wants you to preach you want to preach concerning what god is doing so let let god in the present tense of the ministry of our brother jonathan let god in the present tense of the revelation in your heart and in your soul amen praise the lord you're here not because of what he did not because of what he's going to do you're here because of what he's doing you want to identify more and more with what he's doing we are on our way home by the grace of god amen and i'll tell you this i pray grace that we're that we got that attitude jesus said amen concerning getting back he said he said i want to leave here he said i can't i can't stay here any longer he means that i'm go i'm going and he said no man is ascended up but he that came down even the son of man who is in heaven amen praise the lord i'm sure most didn't understand what he was talking about what son of man who is in heaven you you did they believe he was the son of man amen so brother but he was going by faith and i tell you that dimension was more real to him than this that's why he said i want to get out of here amen he wanted to and brother sister well brother our lord was in in the flesh for 33 years and he gets got to the place after he's in his ministry and he's seen this and he's seen that and he knew what he had to do knew what he had to do let's go do it oh peter tried to stop him oh yeah jesus said well he didn't cut him off he just said get there behind me satan why he wasn't all together rebuking peter it was the spirit on peter it was a spirit you oh i pray grace well we're not going to let that spirit get on us so we're going we're going to watch the emphasis on the negative no let's put emphasis on the positive amen so brother until finally the lord did get peter we just think after all the negative things he dealt with in peter in his ministry but yet when he when he laid down his life picked it up again praise the lord and he came back to fulfill the promise to give us the power the anointing of the life of his blood the baptism of the holy ghost who who was the messenger it was peter would you choose peter i said not many would that god did amen see it's not who you choose who god chooses yes oh we choose this we choose it no no what does god choose amen so we got to cast down our feelings and our thoughts and let's accept the will of god and believe god we'll be ministering tonight through our brother jonathan not not brother jonathan it's the lord using our brother it's the lord ministering to our brother so i pray grace we're going to hear it's just not near brother jonathan let's hear the lord amen and well to hear the lord you have to believe that the lord is ministering through our brother for the amen so just think this keep it in mind because why because we're at the end and what god's going to minister is to give us more and more faith to get us out of here amen he's looking for that generation to get out amen so that he can make a new heaven and a new earth by the grace of god so the lord bless us and again just to say we welcome our sister sandy my it's amazing i trust by the grace of god we're going that oh yeah so that we're going to see her in glory amen but she's not going to have no gray hair amen she's going to be young for sure amen so i trust our sisters there are encouraged with that amen you want to be young forever so oh i got this gray hair but again uh how do you respect to those that would would diet but still the reality is there the reality is there and god sees it well god doesn't seem to die god sees you god sees you who you are and so on oh yeah and and he wants to change you back to a real young person amen so that back then you're not going your air is not going to be gray but it's going to be naturally the right color amen oh yeah we're going to be exactly the way god wants us to be as sons and daughters of god and we're just saying and we'll be brothers and sisters oh yeah brother don't let on the natural relationships overtake your spiritual one no not by any means it's just that the prophet of god said concerning his natural family his natural brothers and sisters and and when they came back to see and see the mother and eventually when the lord took her off the scene and they all came for the funeral oh he said he said we're not going to see each other much more now he said oh yeah may not see them on each other no more why is it because now she's gone and he said we didn't come back for this this we just came back and to see mom and he said we fellowship with each other we met each other oh yeah that was the end of his relationship with his natural family amen and he went and he let go and he got more and more to a greater relationship with his spiritual sons and daughters of god and brothers i know i pray grace don't let the enemy influence us to concentrate more on the natural natural natural no you're leaving with the lord when the enemy says this the enemy says that you say satan get behind me i leave in my my family my sons and daughters husbands wives brothers sisters i'm leaving with the lord and he'll do all things well trust god trust god not trusting them he's trusting god amen brother he knows he's not willing then any should perish so brother if that's god's attitude that's god's spirit we we just say lord i'll leave you with you oh you will love that why because now you're going to focus on the spiritual and move on by grace god help us amen let's stand and let's sing only believe as we turn to our brother jonathan carlett god bless and again praying for those online and again some of the saints that we're not able to make it here tonight the grace of god to them amen and there are some online i believe in central and maybe in even in western newfoundland and uh i have been advised too uh by a couple of brothers from africa that they they go online to hear the ministry of the word from newfoundland oh so i said oh praise the lord this is amazing that we are heard all over the world amen our brother jonathan is going to be ministering not just to just do a few here in saint john's no no he's going to be ministering to saints around the world amen so brother we wonder why is he saying this why would he say that well it's god amen and it's because why maybe there's somebody in india somewhere in africa someone in another part of the world what they they'll need this they'll need that it'll strike them and give them the faith amen that god wants them to have amen praise the lord as i said before so god so glad that the lord has brought brothers and sisters from africa oh priest oh you talk about oneness amen oh they come from the east or from the west the north the south amen praise the lord well this church is a testimony of what god has done amen as we say it again that some of us come from the east the north the west the south amen and we're gathered together here representing the bride of christ thank the lord amen so let's sing only believe and we'll turn to our brother jonathan and really amen commit our brother into the hands of god amen and say lord be with our brother help our brother amen lord that he'll he'll you'll be here and after a few minutes he'll be out of it and god will be in it ain't god in control right the problem of god said no he said just you see he said that he said i'm not no different i'm not there's not that he said he's not waiting on him what for he had to get himself out of the way so jesus could take control the ministry has got to get themselves out of the way so the minute so that god can take control amen and as as believers we get ourselves out of the way so we're going to hear what god is saying by the grace of god amen so the lord bless us and keep us strong in the faith amen more real real sincere by the grace of god amen amen so the lord bless us thank you only believe in our brother jonathan only baby [Music] oh oh glory amen amen amen let's believe in our souls things are possible amen [Music] jesus is here [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah because jesus is here hallelujah the resurrection the rapture praise the lord praise the name of the lord hallelujah jesus [Music] are possible jesus is here lord i believe lord [Music] oh [Music] [Music] r [Music] heavenly father lord we commit this service into your hands lord each heart and soul that's listening here tonight lord that may listen to the recording lord online later lord we pray that lord the seed of your word would find ready ground or prepared ground lord open ground that's ready to bring you forth heavenly father lord set me as aside aside this evening lord just settle me down lord i pray lord may all it's said lord be according to your will to your way lord amen lord may not just be truth but may there be spirit with it lord to quicken it to our lives we pray lord we ask your grace now for this service in jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless you if you turn the scriptures to galatians chapter four i'm in galatians chapter four i did talk with brother carson earlier this week and he was released to go back to work so he's uh he's doing better for sure sister sharon is still a little under the weather so we want to remember them in prayer amen but if he's back to work that's certainly a good sign and then i think brother bob also mentioned brother jason demars is doing well he sent us a selfie from his hospital bed so if a man does that he's either out of his head or feeling very good so i'm glad glad to hear that certainly the report was not so good a few days ago and the lord has definitely touched him so we're very thankful for that amen galatians chapter 4 verse 1 says now i say that the heir as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father amen may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen we want to continue with our series on thy kingdom come we want to take a title of christ-like young men this is a directed sermon that uh it's kind of hard to to say it's for anybody else but it is for everybody actually in these things and you'll see as we go into this that that while we're talking to the young men today amen we are when we start talking about being christ-like then the principles apply to all of us maybe not exactly in the ex in the same way as they might to the men if you're a woman if you're a young lady if you're an older woman it may not be the exact same way but christ-like is christ-like amen so as we go through this certainly don't just just look to the young men or the the young men to be in the church but look to your own self and see what would apply to you amen but we've we've talked so much about the separation of the roles but we want to look at what the growth of those work looks like what the the the the training of those roles looks like amen you don't just you know because you're a man you become a leader um and it's automatic amen just because you're a man does not mean that you are a great leader that you are a capable leader that you are able to handle authority that you're able to handle the responsibility it's something that has to be trained up into you and then you don't instinctively have it god didn't instinctively give us what we need to help lead our households to help support our wives to help support the local church body it's something that he has to put in you and be quickened by the holy spirit amen jesus said that the holy spirit would lead us into all truth it was something that we were brought into it's not something that is instilled in us instinctively but it's something that has to be grown in our lives amen so as we go through this i want to say this that we are at a time of decision and then we are at a very late time in the time where we have to decide as jesus as joshua said choose you this day whom you will serve and then when we talk to young men that decision has to be made very early otherwise they face quite a few struggles in life everyone does if they don't make the choice early but if if as parents as mothers and fathers if we can make the choice for them to train them up in it and then if they when they come to that age of accountability can make the choice to continue in that training and to submit themselves to the word of god and to let the holy spirit lead in their lives then we know that they're going to be successful amen that they're going to be able to do what god has called them to do they'll be able to step into their their role in the body and in their families in these different things and then last service we talked about the requirement for a man to keep his household under the blood and we saw that that transitioned after christ that he had to have not only the blood keep them under the blood of christ but he had to have the life token of that blood which was the holy spirit amen you cannot be a christ you cannot be a christian which is christ-like you cannot be a christian without christ and then you have to have the life of the blood in you and that's the holy spirit so in order to be a proper leader in order to be an authority under the scriptures you need to have the holy spirit to do it the way god wants you to do it amen but the big question is what does that look like we've got a lot of different opinions about what it looks like to have the holy ghost we've got a lot of opinions about what it means to be going in a rapture to be bride ready to be rapture ready but we want to look today at maybe where some of the rubber meets the road things because like i said before we can sit here and we can say i know this doctrine and that doctrine and i can i can i can give you all the truths all the mystery truths of the scripture but if you can't live it then it doesn't do you much good amen so we're talking a bit more about living today rather than than just something that might be in our head remember this growth we're looking for is that growth in their leadership and again this is very much rubber meets the road preaching and you say why do we need this we've got the seals are opened you know the the book has been opened why are we preaching on our rolls well here's this enoch before he was raptured had one revelation what was the revelation that enoch had it was that he pleased god and how do you please god you please god by being in obedience to his word i mean that's how we know where we're going to please him and so when we look at these things in the scripture we don't just want to know about god we don't just want to know about the mysteries but we want to be a mystery we want to be a part of the mystery and that is going to be expressed in your life and if you can't live what you're reading about if you can't live what you're you're you're being taught then what's the point of it amen all it's going to do is is build you up in your head is going to give you a religious spirit and you're going to be of no use to anybody amen but like i said last time we want to we don't just want to to to have a revelation we want to be a revelation and this is a revelation of what it looks like to be a young man in christ we'll get into the young sisters and these different things as we go through but the purpose that we talk about when it goes through training is to do what it's to set a foundation it's to set a basis for how you're going to live your life it's going to set a foundation for what means the most to you and to eliminate everything else that doesn't and then to stick with the things that matter most to stick with the things that have been tried and true things that have been proven in your life and push everything else to the side so that you're not building on shifting sands but you're building on a firm foundation amen so that what when satan does come your way and he is going to come your way and he throws an offer at you when he throws a conversation at you because it always starts with a conversation doesn't it he started a conversation with eve had not god said right he's going to have conversations with you so when he does that you've got to be able to throw that right back at him and say we're not having this conversation i know the road that this is going down and we're not even going to talk about it i'm going to turn around and walk away and you can talk to the door i just shut your face amen that's what we're looking for is to stop him before he can ever get started why because the thing that satan comes into and this is where we have to watch out is that he comes in as an angel of light i mean it's not the big bold things i've said that we have to look out for it's when he comes in and he's posing as something that is godly he's posing as something that would come from the word and then we look in second corinthians 11 and paul says this for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ these are people that are making themselves to look like they are like christ he says and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works amen i appreciate what brother ed cater said the other night where he said your bible he says it ought to be falling apart you ought to be taping things back in there because you know that bible from front to back because if you don't know your bible then he's going to have a heyday with you satan's going to have a heyday with you you say i know all the messages guess what if you know the messages but you don't know the bible that it draw us back to then you're going to get into problems as well because how many offshoots have we seen in the message because people started reading the message books and they didn't stick with their bible and then they didn't take it back from genesis to revelation when satan comes to jesus what did he test him with he tested him with the word he brought the word what did he say to eve had not god said he comes with the word and what we're looking for is to rightly divide by what the full word not just the partial word because satan's conversations are usually snippets of scripture without context and he never reads the full verse he never reads the full chapter and he never takes it all the way from genesis to revelation so you've got to realize what satan looks like when he comes in and as we start talking to the young men tonight they've got to see where the traps are laid they've got to see what it's going to look like when he's offering them something and if satan offers it he's going to make it if that's a good young man if that's a godly young man if that's a man of the holy ghost he's going to try and base it on scripture but it's going to be out of context it's not going to be the fullness of it amen amen the most deceitful thing that i know is a religious spirit because it gives you the appearance of god without the power and the life of god and so it always fails and never brings forth fruit but it'll keep you chasing fruit for years and years and years until you recognize that that wasn't god that was satan trying to trick you amen brother braham said this he said and the antichrist spirit is a religious spirit don't forget that dear people and how blessed are your eyes that do see and hear and understand for you cannot understand unless god reveals it to you amen we've got to have god on the inside to do this because otherwise we can't even see the kingdom of heaven jesus said he said the antichrist spirit is religious jesus said it'd be so close it'd deceive the very elect if possible amen amen remember satan is working within the very framework of the church amen we do not look outside to see satan's moving we look to see him moving in here because that's what that's what we've been warned about is that he's moving within the framework and we even see that satan sits within the church being worshipped as god amen now that means that could happen literally in this church doesn't matter how good the ministry is and how straight they are you can put a man in the position of god and then you end up worshiping satan or you can ignore the word coming forth and now you're worshiping satan again because you've rejected the word and there's only one thing left and that's antichrist amen it's anti-word every time so the discernment is always with what the full word you've got to take the full word and if you only take a portion of it you're always going to fail you need all of the points from genesis to revelation to get through it amen amen now brother ed cater mentioned the threefold purpose of god was in having the preeminence in his bride and i want to read a quote to you because this is where we're talking about the the thy kingdom come and we want to see that these things are based on scripture amen not just quotes but this is a good it's a good quote to set us up and he said he's talking about the threefold purpose he says first it was to express himself completely god in christ second to have the preeminences by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them the preeminence to the point where he could express himself through us so when we talk about christ like men when we talk about christ like women that's going to look like christ expressing himself through us it's not just going to look like it it's going to be it amen is christ expressing himself through us he says all right and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people and talked with them and fellowship with them amen we're preaching on thy kingdom come and he's saying before the kingdom can come before the kingdom can be restored something's got to happen and that's that the preeminence has to be given to god in our lives the preeminence of the word has to be above everything else in our lives amen so what does the preeminence look like if you say i've got the preeminence of the word in my life if the holy spirit has the preeminence in my life how do we know it how do we know that it's true how can we confirm to ourselves that it's true i'm not so worried so much about proving it to you but i need to prove it to myself tonight amen i want to know that the word has a preeminence in us amen and it's has preeminence when that's how we live our life when our decisions are made by it when our thinking is according to it and the way that we make our decisions it follows all the way through with the word amen that we don't just say it but we do it i was listening to the god has only one way provided for anything where brother brahm says he says you can read the bottle you can read the the instructions and the details on the pill bottle he says but if you don't take it it doesn't do you any good right you can't have the preeminence just by reading it and saying i believe it he says you've got to put it in you and then if you're just reading it it's not doing you any good you know all about what it can do but until it has the preeminence until it's a part of you it can't do you any good you've got to take the pill amen and that's how you know it has the preeminence is when you take the pill of the word and you put it in your life and you say i won't take anything else but this i'm feeding on the body word of the son of man as brother branham said amen so we're talking about men and women and that covers the full spectrum spectrum of god's family amen you have men and you have women and when we go into this we want to see that the preeminence is there and we want to see what it means for men and we want to see what it means for a woman amen now some of this may sound legalistic and guess what where the scriptures are black and white we want to be legalistic why there is no variance there amen if you look at marriage and divorce there's only a few things that allow you to be divorced and everything outside of that you're not supposed to do it amen and there's lots of things in the scripture that are black and white and so we want to say where it's black let it be black and where it's white let it be white but let's not make it gray because it makes us uncomfortable amen let's not make it gray because it's easier if we don't do that amen but let's look at ourselves in the word and say if the word says it then be it unto me according to thy word and trust that god will back it up if we'll only line up with it amen and this is going to help us moving forward because guess what it's not going to get easier and then it's going to get harder it's going to get tougher and the young men are going to have to lead the way and then the young men are going to have to be able to stand on the word and know that no matter what the world says the word is always going to be true and every other word is going to be a lie amen they've got to know that god is real in their lives amen let's take it back to the idea of training proverbs 22 6 says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it now we use this scripture as one for all of children but it actually when it says he and when it says child it's speaking of a young boy it's speaking of a lad it is actually speaking of the young men i mean it's teaching about the males here and it's not that the women don't matter but the idea is that if you don't get the leadership right then everything under that authority of that leadership is going to fail so he's saying focus on the met young men here make sure they're raised right and then they'll disseminate that down through the ranks of their authority amen so we ought to be training our young men we ought to be training our young boys from the earliest age what it means to be a true man of god and then we ought to be teaching them by not just word but also by our example by letting them in on the decisions we make by sharing the things we go through right by letting them see that this is what is in front of us and this is how we're making the decision and it's not because it's easier but it's because that's what god tells us to do amen and if we can show them first by example what we do and then follow it up with thus saith the word then they'll put the two together and then when they see the word being vindicated in your life then they'll start to realize hey there's something to this this isn't just a religion this isn't just a way of life but this is life itself and that's what we need to have in our lives amen we want to have something that is anchored that is steadfast and sure and if they can see it in our lives first and then our word second then we know that they're gonna have a good chance to come up and be what they're supposed to be amen but then after that they've got this transition point and as they come into their late teens and their early 20s for certain as they start to finish school as they start to get a job as they start to buy a car as they supposed to have their own their own free time maybe they move out and get their own place what they've got to start making decisions for themselves they've got to be able to say this is how i'm going to spend my time this is the sort of entertainment i'm going to allow these are the sort of electronics i'm going to have in my life these are the sort of friends i'm going to have these are the hobbies i'm going to have am i going to attend church regularly or am i not what kind of girls am i going to see what am i going to prioritize in my life right now and as we come into that transition point we want them to be transitioning into what true sons of god and may we want them to transition into a role that fulfills not only themselves but it helps out the local body and in time perhaps would even help their own family as they would start one of their own amen why they are part of the church and the church means called out ones god doesn't call us out for no reason but he calls us out for a purpose and because of that purpose he requires a training time amen and so that's what we see with the young men is that they have to go through a training time before they can ever be of any real use in the local body now the greatest example of this i think is found in timothy i mean you can see it through the lives of people you can see it through joseph god certainly went put him through a set of trials we see it through david the testing that he went to but if we come into the new testament we've got a new order because and we'll see this more as we get into the sisters in the old testament the sisters didn't have quite the role that they have in the new testament but in the the males have kind of had the same role all the way through and so we can look at the old testament the new testament and it's fairly simple but paul gives us a lot of instruction on how it's supposed to be amen in the in the old testament we see the types and shadows in the new testament we see the words that confirm how they got to where they are amen so let's look at first timothy verse four first timothy verse four or first timothy 4 verse 1 says now the spirit speeches speaketh expressly this is not a random thing this is this is a specific message that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith so it's talking about the end time now now paul's talking to timothy for his life right now but this is also a message to us today because what we're in the latter times right we're in the end now so this is where this scripture is being fulfilled in its greatest in its greatest portion that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits a seducing spirit is one that says what you want to hear and doctrines of devils and that's the men's ideas amen it's not anointing it's not the anointing of the holy spirit but it is the anointing of satan upon them amen the doctrines of devils notice like we said before the antichrist spirit is religious amen it is not political it is religious it says speaking lies in hypocrisy that means they're telling you a lie willfully they know it's not true but they're saying it's true because it benefits them not you having their conscience seared with a hot iron in other words when they go to this point the word doesn't have an effect on them and because they've rejected it now they actually get to the point where they start to believe what they say and they preach it as if it is the truth they get to the point where they believe their own lies amen they are self-deceived and then paul continues in a few different things but if we drop down to verse 12 he says this amazing thing he says timothy let no man despise thy youth now i have heard this scripture quoted a bazillion times by young people and they say hey don't despise my youth i might be young but paul says that we've got a purpose and we've got something that we can offer and you shouldn't look down upon us now that's a great idea but let's read the rest of the scripture amen he says let no man despise thy youth because what we want to be on the front lines we know so much we've been raised right we've been under great ministries we've got great parents we've got something to offer we've got passion we've got energy young people have energy don't they and they have passion you know what they don't have well they're usually right here amen amen i i speak as an experienced young person amen right here you usually don't have that what you have is worldly knowledge and you have word knowledge that hasn't been proven through faith yet and so you've got lots of ideas and you've got all this energy and you think you're ready to go to here but you've got to go through the stature of a perfect man you've got to be built up into this the way everyone else does and i i think i can conclusively say that almost every young person thinks they know more than they do and they think they know how to apply it better than they do and i say that because that's what i thought that's what i thought and it only takes you some time to get into a situation where you have to apply it and all of a sudden you realize whoa i have no clue what's going on here and why isn't this going the way i thought it was going to go and it's because you don't have any wisdom to go with your knowledge i mean you haven't been trained yet but you're thinking you can apply it's like a young engineer going in and he wants to be the chief engineer of the firm he can't do it because he has all of the knowledge the chief engineer might have in many ways but he lacks the experience to apply what he's learned in a way that will achieve the results that they want amen so paul says let no man despise their youth thy youth but he says but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith and impurity now the amplified says let no one despise or think less of you because of your youth and all the young people said praise the lord and then he says but be an example a pattern for the believers in speech in conduct in love in faith and impurity so in other words let your life contradict your youth let the life that you live let the words that you speak let the way that you do things contradict the fact that you're a young person let your maturity be there that they would see that and in that maturity in that consistency and that stability then they would say this is somebody that actually has maybe a bit of what they're talking about he's saying don't let them look down on you and don't let them do it by showing them that your life is different than a typical young person that you aren't so caught up in yourself but rather that you are proving yourself by the life that you live that you're not just a head full of words but rather that you've got the holy spirit inside you that is making those words live amen now he's speaking to timothy but by no means is this only for timothy now timothy we know is a minister as well this isn't just for ministers it's not just for young men but it's for every young person is let yourself be an example for the believers in your life and let that be something that says hey that young person can be of you of use amen contradict your youth with your life and show that you've got the maturity that they're looking for amen because why the scriptural principle is that you've got to be proven before you can be trusted with responsibility you have to be proven that you've got what's required before you can get the job now the problem is this is that guess what we don't have to wait on god to get married do we i could you know somebody can go get a wife tomorrow and get married that doesn't mean god says they're ready that means they wanted to get married and they got married but if you wait on god's time then god will prepare you for marriage and when you're ready then he'll give you a wife or he'll give you a husband but if you go ahead and do it yourself now you're in the school of hard knocks because you've jumped ahead of his time and you've jumped into a responsibility for which you don't have the experience amen you don't have the proof in your life amen you can have every great spiritual gift you could be a prophet ordain from before the foundation of the world but until you get the proof in your life until you get the character and the experience to show that god is working in you you can be of no use to the local body or to anybody if we can put it that way amen so this is what he says to timothy says timothy let no man despise our youth but do this be an example in your life to all of the believers all of the believers amen not just to the young people your age not just just the ones below you but be an example to the ones above show your consistency and let them see it and timothy is no doubt saying how long how long do i do this for paul he says till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation and to doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery so he's acknowledging that there's a gift and a call in timothy's life but he says timothy don't you dare use it you what prove yourselves go read your word get into the word get your doctrine sound listen be taught now he says you can exhort we ought to be able to exhort a man that's got the holy ghost should be able to exhort he should be able to witness to somebody of what god's doing in his life but he doesn't say timothy get up there and preach buddy he laid hands on him he laid hands on him he ordained timothy himself this is this is paul's protege here but yet he says wait till i come don't you dare start down this path even though i've ordained you don't you start preaching just yet but you need to sit down for a while and prove yourself to the people so that when you do get up they'll receive what you say amen he says meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them give everything you've got to this timothy let this be your focus for the next little while is these things that i'm telling you about and don't focus on anything else but focus on living the life and getting into the word amen and that's the only thing that he wanted him to do meditate upon these things give thyself holy to them why that thy profiting may appear to all so that everyone can see what's happening in your life so that everyone can see that there's been a change in timothy that timothy is acting different that timothy's living different that timothy's talking different that timothy's got a different attitude and an approach and hey that's a good young man now amen it reminds me of when they when jesus said to them he says go and tarry in jerusalem what do you tell him to do terry wait wait timothy what are you going to do i'm going to wait i'm going to tarry paul until you come and tell me that i'm ready to go amen i'll respect what you see what you've said to me amen the same thing we see that uh that moses told to joshua that joshua told the young told the children of israel was what meditate on the law of moses meditate on the word get into it and keep it on your lips keep it in your mouth amen eat it drink it live it sleep it let it be every part of you and when that's there then what the propheting appears to all when you give everything holy over to the word to the instruction of god it's going to have an effect in your life amen there's going to be fruit that's coming forth and people are going gonna say he ain't the way he used to be she ain't the way she used to be praise the lord he's moving amen now we've got another young person that we can come up and can be a pillar in the church and can raise a good family and we can trust to get up behind the pulpit and preacher can lead songs or can help with the young people or we can trust them to to marry our daughters or marry our sons in these different things amen what that we can see that the character of christ is being molded through and into them and it's appearing to all and we say wow god is really moving in that young person's life amen amen why you've got to be able to see that take what you believe is true apply it in your life and pull it all the way through and see if it bears the fruit that you thought it was going to bear because if it doesn't bear the fruit of the holy spirit it wasn't the holy spirit that you were feeding on it wasn't the true word that you're feeding on and something's injected itself in there amen there's a reason why a young man isn't allowed to be a pastor you remember why because he gets caught up in himself right amen starts thinking of something because he has a position can't do it brother braham says this he says god has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and meek and stay in the place until god calls him to do something a man that god can bless and he'll still keep himself a man not be an angel or a god and that can be hard not only for the man but those that are around that man you see great gifts within the ministries and all of a sudden people are just latched on to them aren't they that's real hard it's real hard for a man to keep himself from getting prideful in those situations amen but if he if he's truthful and he's honest he'll say this isn't me it's god anyways what do i have anything to be proud of as soon as man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a god he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person what i do what me and me and mine all that that's the wrong attitude god's hunting for somebody who he could bless and pour out the blessings and the more he blessed the literal the the littler the man will become amen can we say lord may that be us amen i saw something where brother braham says you don't need more gifts he says you've had enough gifts he says you need to humble yourself and what let the giver come into you amen let god express himself through you throw the gifts away and get the giver inside of you amen and then the gifts will be put in their place if you need them he says and you'll never get more of god until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself belittle yourself you know what that means i am nothing i am nothing i have nothing of worth and it's only his grace and his anointing that'll make anything that i do to be worthwhile in the kingdom of god amen you've got to belittle yourself he that will exalt himself god will bring a base he that will humble himself god will exalt you've got to get little before you can get big and you'll never be big in your own self you'll only be as big as god will be big in you hallelujah if we could get to the point that we are so small that god could be magnified in us amen if we could make our thinking if we could make our education if we could make our opinions even our gifts itself and say this is nothing without you lord may you take us and may you use us amen amen amen what is it you've got to prove that you've got the goods in your own life before you try and get somebody else get the goods in their life and then you can't offer somebody something that you don't have already and then it's got to be proven by application and by experience amen i can talk a good talk and i can preach a good sermon but if i can't leave it live it why would anybody listen to me amen why would i be up here if at least somebody here didn't think that i was a true christian why because i'd have no effect and then when i fall and when i disappoint that's the strong that's the hardest part for the people is because all of a sudden they realize hey he's still he's still human i don't think anybody was worried that i wasn't human by any means but what it's the humanity bleeds through sometimes isn't it amen god's grace to you and god's grace to me when those things happen amen that i would humble myself amen what is it we've got this idea of an influencer today and now the old people older older people probably don't know much about this but the young people know all about tick tock they know all about instagram and they know all about facebook and what do they have on those platforms they have influencers don't they they have people that present something to everybody else and the intent is to make money off of them get them to buy something somehow build up their reputation build up their business build up their persona build up whatever it is they're offering at the expense of you and anybody can be an influencer today you don't actually have to be rich to pretend you're rich on there they actually have sets that they rent out by the hour that looks like the inside of private jets of mansions they have fancy cars that you can pose next to all that fake champagne bottles that cause you know the real things cost a hundred thousand dollars and they'll give you two fake ones to break and pretend that you don't that you that money means nothing to you everything is available out there if you want to influence today amen but it doesn't require anything real i mean you can be whatever you want it doesn't require character and it doesn't require any proof it just requires an image that you portray online amen what is it it's a bunch of liars telling other liars that they're awesome right and if a liar tells you tells you that you're awesome are you awesome no because he's a liar amen there's nothing to be found there what is it they're trying to make themselves feel good and they're trying to build up something that they don't have in their lives in the first place now there are some that are genuinely rich but the vast majority are nothing and what they do is they're they're putting things on there to try and make it make themselves important is really what it is and i can't tell you how many of them have been caught out where people saw them in real life where people saw them doing things and they're like hey i saw you on there i saw you on there why are you driving an old you know 1972 corolla you know you you're supposed to have a lamborghini you have a learjet you live in a mansion and and people find out who these people are and all of a sudden they're like wow that wasn't real what is it social media is not where we go for our influence i mean it's not a place to gain it or a place to give it why because there is no cri requirement for character or experience on these platforms and then you can be anything you want on there and how many of us have seen people that tried to be something on their and all eventually they fall flat amen what is it social media is set up to hide your flaws and promote your strengths amen and you know what that is that's antichrist now i'm not saying don't be on social media i'm on social media amen but don't use it as a platform for influence and don't use it as a platform to build your reputation your reputation is always built first and foremost with the local body with your own family and then once you get the influence here you can do whatever you want with it elsewhere amen but if you cannot have influence here then why would you be out there trying to have influence why because here is where you have to have character before you can have influence here's where you have to have character before you can have a position here's where you have to have character before you're allowed to take on responsibilities why because we're subject to the word social media is not subject to anything it's subject that anything goes is what it is amen amen god's coming for a real bride can i say that he's not coming for a digital bride he's not coming for what we put online he's coming for what we have in our hearts and how we live our day-to-day lives amen amen i've seen brothers and they only teach and preach on social media why is that because the local congregation won't allow behind the pulpit why because they don't have the trust because they don't have the respect because they haven't proven themselves to be able to do it and so what do they do they go online because they they may have a gift amen but they've got to go through the process like timothy did to get what the proof in their life the profiting that everyone would see before they can get behind the pulpit and what happens is they bypass that and they try and go online and they gather themselves an online reputation they gather themselves in online ministry and guess what it's a bunch of rebels just like them amen why because the local body is always going to have the preeminence in people's lives you've got a local pastor you've got a local group of elders you've got a local group of families and these are the ones that we're supposed to be working for amen the thing is that social media has allowed us to bypass so much the telephone has allowed us to do that television videos all these different things has allowed us to bypass the entire process of being what subject to one another and then improving ourselves here to the people that are here and paul's day you can write letters to everybody right you couldn't send out a video to everybody and have this influence you had to go in person and either they would receive you or they wouldn't but it was always done in person and you had to have that proof of a personal character you had to have the characteristics of christ in order to be accepted amen but now we don't have to do that now we can just plop ourselves in front of our phone put out a video and all of a sudden we've got influence but is it godly influence is a christ-like influence amen amen we read the scripture in a previous service it's first corinthians 8 2 and it says if any man that's if any person if any person think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing as yet he ought to know amen that character is what's going to prove that what you have is real and until it's proven we shouldn't be sharing it with others amen now paul writes a second letter to timothy and to us we'll see because he says this know also second timothy three verse one that in the last days perilous times shall come so remember last time he spoke about the latter days now he's saying the last days the the the the the drama hasn't changed here right he's still talking to us at the last times but he's talking to timothy because the struggle is still the same he says that in the last days perilous times shall come for men that's mankind shall be lovers of their own selves amen you'll be your own greatest fan that's what that means you think you're awesome he says that's what a characteristic of the last day person now this is not the characteristic of the last day christian this is what mankind in general covetous this is funny you think you're awesome but now you're covetous it's a paradox isn't it if you are so awesome then why would you be coveting right boasters that means you're outwardly expressing how awesome you are so not only do you think it but you talk about it right proud blasphemers disobedient to parents now this one's a great one and this is speaking of humanity and you say well that's i'm talking to kids but he's talking to timothy he's talking to a young man right and so if you're raised right to do right and as an adult you're doing wrong then who are you disobedient to you're still disobedient to your parents you might be out of the house you might be 50 years old but if you're going against what your parents taught to to you you're still disobedient to your parents i mean this is not limited by age if you've been taught right and you don't do it you're still disobedient amen what unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce always fighting or always looking for a fight now if that isn't social media today then i don't know what i'm talking about because everybody's looking for a fight on social media everybody's got an ax to grind everybody's looking to jump on somebody's little dot or uncrossed t to point out how wrong they are and how right i am right brother mark doesn't know the rest of us know amen what is it everybody's got something and they're always looking for somebody when we're coming home there was somebody driving 80 in the left lane that's the fast lane right and so i stayed behind them for a while i flashed my lights once or twice to let them know that they needed to move over and they didn't so i ripped around and i told my mom i said i'm not angry i'm just educating them right because i i did lean on the horn as i went by but i genuinely wasn't angry i could say that i wasn't angry but a little annoyed for sure right and and then we came up on another person that needed to be educated right but i didn't beep but then i just went around them you know but what everybody's looking for a fight everyone's got to prove they've got something that i'm right you're wrong and guess what we're almost exactly on the same page but you're still wrong and i'm going to tell you all about it right fierce always looking for a fight amen they're not at rest that's what it is folks they're not at rest they're fighting because they lack rest and so what do they want to do they want to take away your rest so you know how you get away get away right you don't want to be around fierce people get away from where the fierce people are my wife had an incident she was on the newfoundland home growers page or something like that and somebody did something silly and you know what she did she just left right they wanted to fight she just left apologized and left and what she won't go back again why because it's just going to upset her and it's just going to feed their fire of fierceness so walk away from it amen despisers of those that are good that's definitely the truth isn't it they're out there looking to pin us down they're looking for something that'll tell them that we're not what we say we are so that it'll make them feel good about being nothing right and i mean nothing by nothing by the word of god amen traitors that's betrayers backstabbers doing or speaking badly to those that help them that's what a traitor is you don't you're not a traitor to the enemy you're a traitor to your family you're a traitor to your country you're a traitor to those that are around you amen heady you know what hedy means this isn't pride this is recklessness plunging bravely in without any clue about what's waiting for you brother brown put this way walking with hobnailed shoes where angels fear to tread and then you have no what you have no idea of a holy god and then you just push through because you think you know better highminded now this is arrogance lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof this is the religious spirit that we talked about this is the antichrist spirit why because the word of god always comes with transforming power and if you're not being transformed then the word of god is not active in your life and then the holy spirit hasn't had an effect he says from such turn away for this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women now this is talking about literal women and then it's talking about churches right brother brown talked about this woman is always representing the church in the scriptures so what they're leading in what churches that want the things that they're talking about and they lead them captive and they bind them to themselves and you see these great ministries come out of it and all it is is them telling people what they want to hear amen and then you look maybe make bring it a little closer to home look at the churches that left the message you look at brother jeff jenkins is he still a brother who knows you look at jeff jenkins i've seen videos of his church and you know what it is 70 women 80 women what kind of women it says laden with sins led away with divers lusts that doesn't mean physically or anything weird like that but it means that they had a desire for something else than what was being served over the pulpit right and they willingly followed the man that offered it to him that word laden with sins laden means heaped up and overwhelmed with unbelief that's the kind of people that get led away by these men ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth amen seekers but never able to find because they've already defined in their head what truth will look like they are looking for a truth that they believe rather than looking for truth as an absolute amen they're looking for something that is within their expectation rather than just saying i want whatever is true amen they're only open to their expectations and then paul ends his his admonition to timothy now we're going back to the first one he says take heed unto thyself so this is his first series with timothy says take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee he's saying you got to stick with it bud because if you don't stick with it then it's not going to have the effect you're looking for but not only that it won't have the effect on those that are around you but if you can stay with it it'll bleed out because you won't be able to help it right when the life of god's in you it's going to bleed out isn't it we're going to see fruits from it and that'll do what that'll help and save those that are around you now you'll actually have influence timothy but it'll be influenced to save them not influenced to draw them to you but it'll draw them to the god that drew you to him amen that's what we're looking for amen he says look out for yourself and then the rest will come amen now in second timothy 2 so this is the follow-up to his first letter so timothy has done what he said and then he follows up he says thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus remember we've always said you've got to remember that this is a grace work from start to finish timothy remember that this is christ's grace in you that's working in this that the growth that you're seeing that the ministry you're embarking on that the influence that you're about to have or that you are having with people is what it's his grace to you this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with him he says and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also what's he doing he's saying timothy time for you to go out time for you to go teach other men time for you to pass on what you've learned since i last taught you time since you've been spending time in the word since you've meditated on these things since you've committed yourself holy to it now that the proof is there now go and commit the same thing to other men let them see how the effect it's had in you teach them what i've taught you and then they'll go and they'll expand it out to somebody else and pretty soon we'll have the growth of the great church what is it take the proof that you've got and go show other people the proof and let them get it in their life as well what is it he's stepping into his active ministry now paul is saying you're trusted now timothy now it's time for you to start working with other people he says thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ things are about to get tough timothy and he calls him a soldier now right now he before he was a son before he was a youth now what is he he's a soldier he's been proven he's got something to fight with now he's been trained right the proof that you're ready for battle is that you get what put into battle that you pass the training that you pass the course and that they've they've decided that you're good enough to go why he's about to battle for the gospel of jesus christ and in those days that was a killing thing they killed you for that in those days right they didn't just make fun of you they just just didn't take your job they took your head right he's got to endure the real deal now he says no man that wareth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life what he's got one focus battle for the gospel why that he may please him who had chosen him to be a soldier and then if the general tells you to do something and you go do something else and you say well i got distracted by this or distracted by that does that please the general or the captain or the lieutenant or the colonel no when he asks you to do something he wants you to do it he's saying timothy you've been loosed now you're ready to go you're ready to battle go battle and let your focus be solely on what i've taught you to do he says and if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully in other words you don't get a medal if you don't do the work and then you don't get position without proving yourself and you don't get authority unless you've proven that you can share that responsibility amen what is it leadership proves cheaters really really quickly why because the first thing that's tested as a leader is what character it's always character and brother brown said character is what a victory so if you have presumed that you have character rather than you have character because you've had it proven in battle then the first thing that's going to happen is you're going to fail in leadership because you lack the character by experience and by proof right what's the first thing that's going to be tested will you give preeminence to the word or to you or will you put it above your own comfort and reputation right character will put reputation aside to make things right every time and then the buck stops with leadership the buck stops with leadership so if leadership can't humble themselves to the word what's the point of them leading right one will you pump or two will you humble yourself to the word personally even if it hurts you that's a tough one for us men isn't it pride flares up pride flares up every time and i don't want to no no no no let's just smooth this over right let's just point out their flaws so that mine slip away no no no no we've got to put ourselves under the microscope right we've got to be willing to do the same thing that we expect of them amen and what the third thing is will you be influenced away from the word by personal relationships or gifts especially those with a greater ministry or a higher level of responsibility because guess what the greater your gift the greater your ministry the greater the people you start to rub shoulders with and guess what they ain't all angels of light right some of them are trying to draw people to them they're trying to get financial support they're trying to get ministerial support they're trying to make a name for themselves and you can get drawn into that amen like a moth is drawn to light if you don't have character to say no the word applies to every one of us amen amen he continues he says the husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits now this is a weird scripture because we think he's the first partaker because he's the one that's done the work but what he's also saying here is look if you've planted and you've got fruit coming out you need to try the fruit first because if you've done a good job the fruit will be good if you've done the right things then the fruit will be right but if you've done it wrong you taste it first so that if it's not good you don't try and feed what you've just done to somebody else and then prove the fruit that you've got coming out taste and see that it's good and if it's good then let other people know this is the way it works but if you taste it and you say there's some bitterness in there it's not quite the way i expected it to taste and you got strawberries and they're sour you did something wrong didn't you right the fruit has to be the way that it's supposed to be and if you taste it and see that's not then you know not to try and feed it to somebody else then paul says consider what i say and the lord give thee understanding in all things dropping down to the 14th verse he says of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no prophet but to the subverting of the hearers he says don't get caught up in petty conversations and ideas it only undermines the faith of the people that get drawn into it as well don't be one of those people that get sucked into the little things amen this is a huge scripture for today because why we're in laodicea everybody's got their rights and not only that everybody's got an opinion and everybody thinks their opinion is right now i don't think that's exclusive to laodicea what they do have today is they have everyone a platform to express their opinions one of them social media the other thing is in the workplace the other thing is out wherever people are talking about anything and everything and they feel that because they have an opinion that they should be expressing the opinion did you know that's not scripture everybody doesn't get to talk all the time in scripture there's an order for who talks when they talk and who listens amen amen and if you haven't proven yourself by your conduct guess what nobody's going to listen to you and you're not even going to be given a chance to speak right there's an order to all these things and for the young men they've got to realize that just because you have something to say doesn't mean it's always it always needs to be said amen again i'm still learning that lesson right and i have learned it many many times right sometimes just because you think you have something to say doesn't mean you should say it one thing i learned from brother phil mcwugby over in alberta he's a manager senior manager he said whenever i have a meeting at work he says i speak last you know why he says one because if i speak first and people have a differing opinion they don't want to say it but he said two there's lots of experience in the room he says and i'll take the best things that they say and add it to what i had and even modify it and i'll speak last and wrap the team up together right there's a time to speak and there's a time not too amen look at what we have we have what a 14 15 year old activist from sweden greta tunberg trying to tell the world how to fix their problems listen she doesn't even know she what does she know she knows nothing but she has a voice and she has an opinion and somehow she thinks that makes her worthy of listening and guess what the world has told her you're worthy of listening what kind of message does that give to every other 14 or 15 year old that they should get on tv and they should tell things of which they have no knowledge or experience no practical knowledge or experience that's for sure amen thing is we all have opinions but how many of us have word opinions how many of us can say it is written amen not i think right or i believe but it is written amen amen that's who i want to speak is somebody that knows what they're talking about amen i don't want to listen to just anybody with an opinion it can be fun it can be interesting sometimes but i want to listen to somebody that knows what they're actually talking about amen when we surround ourselves with people like ourselves and when we base our rightness or spirituality on those that are like us rather than those that have a proven track record of experience we are hearing what scripture calls the song of fools the song of fools why because we're surrounding ourselves with yes people people that affirm us where we are rather than hold us accountable to the word and how do you hold somebody accountable to the word it's by the experience of the word not just by the letter of the word you've got to know what you're talking about and then we've got a beautiful example of this it's not so beautiful but it's it's beautiful for us to learn by amen this is first kings 12. this is what happens when we what when we look to our immediate peers those that are in our own age group amen and this is what we tend to do as young people again i'm speaking from experience i'm not making this up what do us young people tend to do we talk to other young people right am i not right am i not great am i not educated am i not knowledgeable about this do i not have a gift and all of the people around us say yes yes yes why because they want you to say the same thing about them when they get up and talk or when they have something they want to do or something they want to say we surround ourselves with people that will affirm rather than people that will align us with the word and that's the that's the natural that that's that's human nature is to make our life easy and so we surround ourselves with people that will affirm us first kings 12 1 says andrea rehoboam this is solomon's son this is the sun that follows the millennium right that was the millennium kingdom with solomon it was it was the representation of the millennium it was all peace no fighting and a wise king and rio bone went to shechem for all israel will come to shechem to make him king and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yet in egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt that they sent and called him and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spake unto rehoboam saint so remember jeroboam can take israel they're considering jeroboam as king but they go to rehoboam and say okay we got something to talk to you about jeroboam you come back just in case because we got two choices here so they came to rehoboam and they said thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy oak which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee and he said unto them depart ye depart yet for three days and then come again to me and the people departed and king rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do you advise that i may answer this people catch that why does solomon need anybody to advise him these are the old men that what advised solomon solomon that has the greatest wisdom known to mankind for a non-holy ghost-filled man this is a man that astonished the entire world with his knowledge and wisdom and yet he had who to advise him old men because why solomon wasn't a fool right he knew there was value in experience so he so rehoboam his son now goes to the men that consulted solomon it says and they spake unto him saying if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and will serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants forever but he sorry and he said unto them sorry then they will be thy servants forever but he forsook the counsel of the old man which they had given him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and which stood before him in other words he talked to the people close to him his friends his buddies the ones that were raised in the palace what all the ones that had something to gain by his influence and those are the ones that he went and talked to right he didn't ask in or add in anyone that wasn't affiliated with him and that wasn't known to him what'd he do he gathered the yes men and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me say make the yoke which thy father then put upon us later and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy and thou shalt and make thou lighter unto us thou shalt say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins and now whereas my father delayed you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father has chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions what'd they say flex your power show them who's boss let them know that you're the king and you can do whatever you want make it tougher just to prove a point to them make a point to prove to them that you've got the power to do whatever you want so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old man's counsel that they gave him and spake to them after the council of the young man saying my father made your yoke heavy and i will add to your yoke my father also chastise you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions wherefore the king heart cannot unto the people for the cause was from the lord that he might perform his saying which the lord spake by ahijah the shiloh knight unto jeroboam the son of nebat so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to thine house own house david so israel departed under their tents what'd he do he lost all of israel why he listened to people of his own age amen paid a heavy price he lost the majority of his kingdom and it devolved into what civil war so let me ask you young brothers and young sisters who's giving you your advice amen is it somebody that's grown up with you is it your own peer group or is it somebody that is above you an experience in age that has the proof of the life and the decisions that you're trying to make and have amen if we're talking to people that are at our own level what could they ever hope to offer right they have nothing that we don't already have in most cases what do we do we always look above to learn before we can ever hope to teach those that are around us amen amen amen listen if we're asking it's because we don't know so why would we ask other people that don't know as well right it's head knowledge to us amen we can all read the word and we do right but you've got to know how to rightly divide it and you've got to know how to rightly apply it and that comes with experience and we're we're foolish if we're not talking to the older people and then if we're not looking to those that have a track record that says they know how to make a good decision and they know how to how to lead themselves they know how to lead themselves and their families amen ecclesiastes 7 5 says it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools guess what whenever i talk to somebody that's older than me and i have i have three men in my life four maybe that i go to when i'm wondering about something and i asked them and guess what my expectation is not that they will affirm what i think my expectation is that they'll be honest with me and let me know if i'm off track and let me know how to make it right or let me how know how to do it better or let me know what the right decision is straight up if there's a word answer i want a word answer amen and sometimes sometimes we're ignorant ignorant because we don't know not ignorant willfully but other times we're ignorant willfully because we want something to go a certain way and if you've got a friend if you've got somebody above you that can help you and tell you it's straight that's the best friend you're ever going to have because they're looking out for your good rather than trying to make you into something you're not amen proverbs 13 verse 20 says he that walketh with wise men shall be wise guess what wise means more than you've got usually right you're looking to go with somebody that's ahead of you not somebody that's with you and definitely not somebody that's behind you on their christian walk wise people are going to be the ones ahead of you fools are going to be the ones with you or behind you when it comes to future decisions or decisions that are going to take you in a particular path a critical path moving forward amen amen if we as young people are affirming our own spirituality with each other then we miss the boat somewhere and then affirmation of that type comes from above not from below and not even at our own level first peter 5 says likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility so he points us to the ones that are above us but he says listen we all still answer to each other amen i think we could all say those of us that have children we've been corrected by our children haven't we right they've said things and they've said i remember a brother told me something and they had to do something on a on a church night and and his young son piped up and he said dad we're supposed to be at church tonight and he said he just went because he said he was right we should be at church tonight but instead we're doing something else that we deem to be more critical but his son was saying dad you've always said church is critical so why is this more critical right he said i couldn't answer because why what he had to humble himself to even that little kid it's not that we can't teach somebody that is above us right but it's not our position to do it amen but our kids definitely can teach us amen so the quick principle if we were to look at this is what you do not teach upwards you only teach downwards you don't teach at your level you teach to those that are below you and you are taught by those that are above you that's the scriptural principle and we'll actually see this we see it here and this is this is in general this is to men and women but it actually is most focused on the the young women if you look into the scriptures that they are to learn from the older to from the age of women but says likewise you're younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility if you're teaching the lesson be humble and if you're receiving the lesson be humble amen for god resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble humility i i mean i just listened to the message humbled myself and it wasn't really a message it was just brother brad i'm getting up and talking but he said so much in those 25 minutes i think that it was a worthy sermon you know and when he talks about humility is what gives us power with god amen humility is what gives us power with the people that are around us amen god help us humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time let me put it this way humility looks a lot like listening and not a lot like talking that's what humility is is there's a lot less talking and there's a whole lot more listening if i can put it this way we have two ears and one mouth i would take that to mean we should listen twice as much as we talk amen so he says what you younger submit yourselves to the older so we have younger and we have older now that's that's a varied spread because guess what jensen is younger compared to brother paul but brother paul is younger compared to brother mark and i'm younger compared to brother gerald so there's a spectrum of younger and older all the way through so jensen can't teach brother paul but brother paul can teach brother jensen brother paul should not necessarily be teaching brother mark but brother mark should be teaching brother paul and i should not be teaching brother gerald but brother gerald should be teaching me because we submit ourselves to the elder they are the ones that teach us amen but there's a sliding scale there so each one of us has a sphere of influence we have a range that we can we can actually teach in and that others would be subject to us but we're also subject to somebody else and it's only when you get to the high end that basically the oldest person in the room has nobody answered to except for god so whoever that is brother gerald i think right but that's the way it is is the elders what they teach the younger in these things so what can brother gerald learn something from me absolutely but it is not my position to teach him right he can learn from me but is not my position to take authority over him in any way amen we listen we teach downwards but we listen upwards and then when we start trying to teach even at our own level we're playing with fire because again we're sitting around with people that don't know anything more than us and so what do we have to teach them we don't read a book and somehow no more that's not what we're talking about you've got to have experience above and beyond them and for most of us we have more or less the same experience as people our own age amen now that's a tricky thing sometimes because i'm sure somebody has noticed the paradox here you're saying brother john you're not allowed to teach upwards and yet who's behind the pulpit tonight i'm teaching a bunch of elders and i'm teaching some people at my age roughly and then i'm teaching younger but did i take this pulpit did i come in and say i want the pulpit no what happened the elders of the church the pastor of the church has given me the authority to teach and by recognition of the gift they will accept what i say is the word of god as long as it stays with the word of god amen but they are still sitting and don't think they aren't they are still sitting here and they are judging what i say by the word and you know what happens if brother jonathan gets off the word a vote no vote brother gerald's going to pull me aside and what's he going to do he's going to say brother john you're off the word brother right and if i persist what's he going to do is he's going to pull brother bob and brother mark in there and the three of them are going to sit down with me and say now brother john you're off the word and if i insist on holding the pulpit still what are they going to do they're going to sit me down in the pew until i can humble myself to the word aren't they because even though they have delegated that authority even though they've given me that authority to teach i cannot presume to have it it is given every service that i get up here they are giving me that anew every single time right so i can't take it and i can't presume i have it it is given every day that i get up here they are giving me the right to teach amen but let me tell you if my life gets out of order i'm going to get pulled out of the pulpit really quick why because if i can't live it i can't preach it amen and that's the god that's the word standard is if you can't live it then you can't preach it and that doesn't that's not just behind the pulpit that's in whatever you do and say amen if you you can't preach above your life if i can put it that way what did brother brahms say your life is speaking so loudly i can't hear what you're saying right that's where we're at today is we've got people that are speaking so loudly and not living right the young men what is it brothers speak less live more amen i've got tremendous respect for young men that don't talk a lot i was a big talker by the way i was a big talker i'm not putting myself up i was a big talker but i learned to shut up real quick when god gets a hold of you and he starts working he shuts you up for a while because you got to listen because what you're being taught and you can't speak while you're being taught you have to listen amen amen but the other thing is when i get outside the church do i go around and tell brother bob and brother joe and brother mark what to do yeah good luck i can't do it what do i do i defer to age because why they're the elders of the church they're the guardians of the church that's the pastor of the church and as much as brother gerald allows me my freedom up here out there i cannot presume to tell him what to do i have to defer to the authority that god has placed in his life defer to the authority of the elders in here amen if i want to do something i ask them if i want to do something that's going to impact them i ask them for permission i don't go up and say i'm the i'm the assistant pastor i'm a minister therefore we're going to do this no no i've got to ask them because they have authority over me as the elders amen if you look in the book of job what do we see we see jobs comforters that weren't very good at comforting right have you ever noticed who was the one that set them right was it the old guy or the young guy it was the young guy okay so it's again it's not that you can't help it's not that you can't teach somebody something in that you can't bring them to the word but if you look at elijah when he's there did he start or did he finish he finished he led all of those that were older more experienced he let them go on and on for what 30 35 chapters that's a long conversation and he sat there and he waited and he waited and then the scripture says he waited after they stopped for a while just in case they had anything more to add and then he spoke amen and he wasn't doing it in a formal role he was there as a friend speaking to them so again it's not that the young can't ever teach the old something as i said i'm pretty sure we can all say our children have taught us something so that means anybody can teach us anything listen a worldly person teaches us things at times if balaam's donkey can teach then just about anybody can amen i'm sure we've all been humbled in that way but rather our intent is not to go in and teach if it's somebody that's older than us our intent is to listen amen you're out of your position when you do that we're supposed to be listening to the elders not teaching the elders titus 2 says young men likewise exhort to be sober minded in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works good words good works live it don't talk it in doctrine showing on corruptness gravity and sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned you know how you get sound speech that can't be condemned think before you speak and speak very little that's how you do it is when you measure your words against the word and you only speak what the word says amen too often we're waiting just for the other person to be quiet that's not what we're looking for we're looking to add to to edify or to stay silent amen this is the pattern for young men now goes for young women too but for young men this is how you build up a reputation this is how you prove yourself in training is you listen and you learn more than you talk and show amen sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you can we say that i i would love it if my reputation was that is that when people said something bad about me then they would be ashamed because they know it's a lie that brother john isn't like that he would never do that but i'm not there yet amen but what what a reputation that would be that that even people that are contrary to your position contrary to what you say or believe would say but he's still a real man of god that i have nothing to lay at his feet that would say that he's a si a secret sinner you know or that he's a hypocrite or those things amen may god help us to be in that position amen that they would have no evil thing to save us listen as we wrap this up you know we've got a lot of scripture here but let's take it back to the god man can i do that just to wrap it up let's take it back to the god man and see how jesus dealt with this right jesus leaves the temple at the age of 12 having taught who the priests he went in there and he astonished them with what he knew okay so it is not a knowledge issue but he knew so much more and he astonished them they couldn't answer him jesus knew the word why because he was the word but watch what happens here amen he teaches all of those priests and then what happens is mary comes back to him and says we've been so worried about you and what were you doing he said know you not that i must be about my father's business right and then what does he do and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject to them this is the fullness of the godhead bodily at the age of 12 expounding on the scriptures in a way that the priests could not answer him and yet he goes down back to nazareth and is subject to who the dad that's not his dad and the mama that's not his mama for how long 18 more years he was subject to his parents until he was 30 years old god in flesh went back to nazareth until he was 30 and was subject to his parents amen but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart now listen to verse 52 and jesus remember he is subject to his mother and father fleshly speaking he increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man in what subjection in subjection he grew in stature and favor with god amen you want influence here's here you go this is this is the perfect picture of the perfect man of the god man and he subjects himself to those that god has put in authority and he grew in wisdom and stature glory amen what this is not just a man filled with the holy ghost this is the holy ghost in flesh and yet god used those that were in authority over him to help him grow in wisdom and in stature and jesus took it until he was 30. listen guys i know when we're 20 we're busting to get out aren't we we're busting it out we know so much we have great plans great ideas jesus stayed till he was 30 for a three and a half year ministry that's what we're looking at i'm not saying stay home until you're 30. all the parents are shooting daggers at me right now right no they're not they're not but i want you to see the pattern here paul didn't just make this stuff up amen paul didn't just come up with some good ideas for young men he's even pointing right back to the very one that showed us the great example and said even he was subject amen even he was under authority even he went back to those that god had placed in his life amen and how did he learn scripture says he learned by the things that he suffered why it was a struggle it was a trial you go into the military i've never been seen lots of videos is it a struggle is it easy you want to be on seal team six is it gonna be a joke no no no no the elite warrior requires elite training and the further you want to go the higher you want to be the better you want to be the harder you got to be you got to be trained brother brahm talks about you got to go back on those sands and then what did paul do when he got the holy ghost what did he what happened god took him out to arabia on the back side of the desert and he trained his prophet out of man out of everything he drilled everything out of him that he'd ever had and filled it back with something with a message that would come and take those people into a rapture amen final portion of timothy as we close he says to timothy study to show thyself approved unto god compare your life to what the word says a workman that needeth not be ashamed when is a workman ashamed when the owner or when the boss tells him to do something he does what he thinks he wants to do and then he comes back and he says that's either wrong or it's not as good as i expected of you that's the ashamed workman is somebody that's done something but it doesn't meet the standard that was required amen what is it rightly dividing the word of truth not just having it you got to rightly divide it you got to be able to apply it the right way but shun profane and vain babblings vain idol and useless talk for they will increase unto more ungodliness they're ungodly to start with and they'll lead you and others into more ungodliness and their word will eat as dutha canker in other words there's when i look that up in in the aramaic it says that they're like a cancer or gangrene what does cancer do does it just stay in one spot no it feathers out doesn't it you'll either get a tumor or you'll get something that just branches out through everything you know you get it in your lungs and it starts here and you go a week later and it's down to here and then a month later it's all the way through your lungs what it branches out and it envelops everything that's around it until what you can't cut it out because it's so tied into everything in your systems he says there were we'll eat as the other canker of whom is hymenus and philetus there was two men that were doing this and he names them he says look at them for an example this is what happens when you talk this way when you live this way when you don't compare yourself to the word but you lift yourself up on a platform amen what's he saying there's a lot of talking going on right there's a lot of talking going on he says watch what you're saying because it may lead you in the path of these two men that fell amen this is challenging amen brothers and sisters this is challenging i i know i'm speaking to the young men but if if we as as men and women of any age take this it's a challenge to us amen and say is he happy with the way i'm living is he happy with the way i'm developing my reputation is he happy with the decisions i'm making and then could we say that we're rapture ready that we please god and then when we look at this i mean this is rubber meets the road there's nothing there's no high revelation here and i know that amen but we've got to be able to take the word that we're we're hearing and we've got to be able to apply it we've got to be able to live a christian life and not just talk a christian life we've got to be able to live a christian life amen amen god bless you let's just stand this evening amen what is a young man we want to set a foundation that god can build up line upon line word upon word precept a prompt precept and then when that when that foundation is set then god's got something he can work on him and that's something he can trust is when you're built on that foundation but when you get that sand underneath and it moves underneath that stone will shift won't it every single time you've got to set it on a solid rock and that's what we're talking about here is when you make those decisions in life as you move forward as you look to be a part of the local bodies you look to find your place what paul's saying is be quiet before you get loud amen find your place get trained up and then when you're trained up then it'll it'll happen organically isn't that what they talk about today organic growth and a company will want to grow organically what is it we don't want to bring in some big outside we just want it to naturally develop into something that's what paul's talk about do the organic growth thing because that's what will last if you come in with boosters and injectors and and hot sauce and this and that and the other thing what's going to happen is you're going to have this quick burst but then you can't sustain it right why because it wasn't god to start with but if you can just take that slow the harder path amen that's what we're talking about here is the harder path if you can take the harder path then nothing will do it you'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water amen that's what we're looking for is something that's just pushing taking in god pushing it out taking in god pushing it out and then you grow into that stature of a perfect man or a perfect woman in christ amen let's bow our heads heavenly father lord once again i know a challenging sermon lord for my own self if i was only preaching to myself lord i'd say there are many areas here where i don't match up lord maybe where pride lifts up lord ignorance at times lord maybe just an unwillingness to do the harder work but lord we know the reward comes when we'll submit ourselves to you amen lord when we'll knock down anything that we've built up lord and let you be the master builder of our lives lord god lord we want to lift our young brothers up this morning lord no matter their age no matter where they're at in life lord we want to lift them up before you and ask you to grant them grace lord to humble themselves to your word lord not only the brothers lord but each one's here lord that we would be able to look into the mirror of your word and where there is a disparity lord where we don't match up we'd say lord would you tear it down to bear rock and build it up in your way lord we pray your grace to each one of us lord just minister to hearts and souls lord you know my heart it's not directed to any one person lord i see myself in so many of these things lord i ask your grace for me lord i ask your forgiveness for me i ask your strength for me lord that i would grow in the way that you will want me to grow lord so that i can help those that are around me to grow as well lord lord may we not be stuffed shirts lord but may we be full of experience lord in the love and power of the holy ghost in our lives lord that others will benefit we pray right in jesus christ's name we ask it amen i love you lord and i lift my voice do we know that 748 brother matt or sister amber we'll hand it right over to brother bob [Music] i love you lord and i lift my voice to worship you oh my soul rejoice [Music] take joy my king in him watch

lord amen well that took i'm sure to take it took the holy ghost to deliver that but it takes the holy ghost to receive it too amen amen may god give us the from the youngest to the oldest to be able to take it and apply it let's sing 490. it is just as i am i said just as i am without one plea we don't have anything to offer god god showed me that recently [Music] not to get into a long long diatribe here but just to say that [Music] i realized that after all those years you know you sit back and think i was thinking about song services and things and realized that you know i don't really have anything it's only what god wants from me he wants from all of us is an obedient heart he wants a willingness he wants willingness to be subject to him and by the time god got through talking to me when i was out for a walk recently he said you know i i was i said i got nothing i got nothing and then when i got home and i opened up a message that i was reading god and simplicity and brother branham said you think you've got this or that you think you've got this talent he said you got nothing and what god was doing there was confirming that for me right and and that's for me that's where the rubber hit the road now it took me 41 years to come to that but you know i didn't realize before i didn't have very much but god just showed me that it's him from the beginning right to the end it's he is the genesis he's the revelation he's all in all and everything that he's done everything that he's done in our lives is to bring glory to him amen okay that's what i've come to and that's why i said there a couple of weeks ago when john preached the first the first sermon in this series that this i see it as god taking me out of all of this right he's taking me out and he's putting more of him in right that's that's where i believe god wants us to be totally subject to his will yes god whatever you want is what i want amen let's see you first just as i am [Music] without one please [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes amen just as i am waiting [Music] to thee whose [Music] god just as i am the tossed about [Music] hallelujah [Music] just as i am for reduction [Music]

amen hallelujah my father knows what i need [Music] [Applause] [Music] blessed lord hallelujah my father knows hallelujah i put my life amen [Music] is [Music] amen amen praise the lord it's one thing to sing it it's another thing to mean it actually take our lives and completely surrender it to him that he might have his way with us as we go let's sing i was born to be a dwelling place i believe that's appropriate and other people will be able to see christ dwelling in us as brother brown said for a lot of people that's all they will see of god it's what they see in us right so it's like i always say that that every every action that we go through that we present everything we say everything we do not not only here not here but outside is a reflection on christ it's a reflection on the body it's everything we do and say we're in a way we're under a microscope are we you know ministry feels that they're under a microscope and probably rightfully so you feel like you're a microscope for sure but believers are too because people are watching us right so how we conduct ourselves how we live how we talk and how we present ourselves is absolutely critical right it could mean the difference between heaven and hell for somebody amen what a responsibility so let's sing this tonight especially david become a close in prayer and pray one for another as we continue to soldier soldier on until the rapture takes place amen this time of pressure that's that's upon us and more to come we need each other more we need christ more amen so let's draw close to him and closer to each other as we go for the next few days and being prayerful by john as he brings you preaching sunday okay uh be in prayer for go to john for the service on sunday i was born to be [Music] a dwelling place [Music] so let my life [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] that i might be [Music] amen [Music] [Music] bless the lord hallelujah [Music] amen bless the lord [Music] we praise you blessed lord and thank you lord for your many blessings with us lord if you love toward us lord your blessings lord your blessings with your word once again my regard this night hallelujah we cannot find the words of the lord to express our gratitude to your lord but our sense of loving god oppresses lord in our sight and lord we just want to thank you lord tonight lord for your grace to us each one lord
