[44:24] are my heart.
[44:26] Desire and I long to worship
[44:32] me.
[44:36] Let's sing. Uh number 1245. I came to
[44:39] worship you.
[44:49] I came to worship
[44:53] you.
[44:56] I came to sing your praise.
[45:04] I came to love you Lord.
[45:11] Your holy
[45:13] name you reign.
[45:18] Oh hallelujah.
[45:26] Hallelujah.
[45:32] Oh, how I worship
[45:36] you.
[45:40] You are my Lord
[45:47] and I came to worship
[45:51] you.
[45:54] I came to sing your praise.
[46:01] I came to love you Lord.
[46:09] Your holy
[46:11] name to raise.
[46:16] Oh hallelujah.
[46:24] Hallelujah.
[46:30] Lord, how I worship
[46:35] you.
[46:37] You are my Lord.
[46:43] Yes, Lord. We've come in to worship and
[46:46] thank you, heavenly father, Lord. And we
[46:49] want to thank you from the bottom of our
[46:50] hearts, Lord, for your grace that's kept
[46:52] us through another few days, Lord. for a
[46:55] grace that brings us into your presence,
[46:57] Lord, for a grace that brings you to an
[46:59] open word, Lord, that's changing us into
[47:01] your glorious image, heavenly father.
[47:04] Lord, we're thankful this evening for
[47:05] this people, this place you've provided,
[47:07] Lord, and we're asking you once again to
[47:09] just move in our midst, heavenly father.
[47:11] You said if we gather in your name,
[47:13] you'd be in the midst, Lord. So, here we
[47:15] are just looking to you and trusting
[47:16] you, Lord God. Praying that you would
[47:18] just speak, Lord, to each heart and
[47:20] soul, each life that's here, Lord God.
[47:22] You know their needs, Lord, better than
[47:24] anyone. No, even better than we know
[47:26] ourselves, Lord. You know the real needs
[47:27] that are in our lives. So, we ask you to
[47:29] speak, Lord, once again, Lord, minister.
[47:32] You're the great shepherd, Lord. This is
[47:33] your flock, Lord. I pray you feed them
[47:35] the the word of eternal life, the bread
[47:37] of eternal life here tonight. We ask in
[47:39] Jesus Christ's name we pray it. Amen.
[47:42] Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would
[47:44] to James chapter 5. James chapter 5.
[47:48] Amen. Just a few announcements and
[47:50] updates. As brother Joe mentioned, we've
[47:52] got prayer meeting on Saturday. So, just
[47:54] so you know, this time we'll have it in
[47:55] the fellowship hall and we're going to
[47:57] set it up in a circle so that we can all
[47:59] hear each other and we know what's being
[48:01] said and done there as opposed to we've
[48:03] had some feedback and I certainly
[48:04] noticed it. You can't hear everybody,
[48:06] you know, during the prayer meeting and
[48:08] whatnot. So, we're going to go in there
[48:09] and we'll sit on the couches and the
[48:10] chairs and and it'll be a wonderful
[48:12] time, Lord willing. We'll also be having
[48:14] Easter meetings this year, Lord willing,
[48:16] again, April 3rd through 5th. And I'm in
[48:18] contract negotiations with brother Kyrie
[48:21] digs. So I spoke to him on uh Tuesday
[48:24] and he said yes. Uh brother Barry Coffee
[48:27] had reintroduced me to him and said you
[48:29] need to go up and preach for those
[48:30] people and they'd like to have you
[48:32] Easter. So he held his Easter open. So
[48:34] Lord willing as long as it works out
[48:36] he's he's available as long as
[48:37] everything else works out we'll have
[48:38] brother Kyrie Digs come up and preach
[48:40] for us on the uh Easter uh weekend. So
[48:43] really looking forward to that. We also
[48:45] have our business meeting coming up on
[48:47] Thursday at 7 o'clock. And uh I just
[48:50] wanted to I know I shared with many of
[48:52] you on the the WhatsApp chat for the
[48:53] church, but just brother Dale Walsher's
[48:55] blood results came back and he his uh
[48:58] his uh his blood the levels of the
[49:00] cancer PS what PSA is uh is down to
[49:04] about 40 which is way higher than it
[49:07] should be but it's way better than it
[49:08] used to be. So we're just trusting that
[49:10] things are moving in the right
[49:11] direction. Amen. That the Lord is giving
[49:13] him a healing touch there. Uh my wife
[49:16] ran into or not she didn't run into her
[49:18] but she met up with Cherylyn Piery on a
[49:20] walk and she is done work now. So she's
[49:24] basically just slowly reducing her life
[49:26] to the ver the bare minimum. Uh she
[49:28] can't do anything that's highly
[49:29] repetitive. It agitates the scaraderma.
[49:32] So really except the Lord touches her
[49:34] she's kind of pulled away now and
[49:36] there's not much left. So we pray the
[49:38] Lord's grace to her. I had a real burden
[49:40] for her as I was driving away. I met
[49:41] them as I was leaving for work and and
[49:44] so I just greeted her. But what she
[49:46] needs is a revelation that there's a
[49:48] healer. Amen. And I believe God can do a
[49:50] wonderful thing in her body and in her
[49:51] life. So just remember her in prayer if
[49:54] you would. That's a real burden that's
[49:55] on my heart for her that she would see
[49:57] the salvation of the Lord truly in a in
[49:59] a in a reality that she's never even
[50:01] perhaps believed in before. Amen. God
[50:04] bless you. James chapter 5 and 16 says
[50:07] this. Confess your faults one to another
[50:09] and pray for one another that ye may be
[50:11] healed. And then he says these wonderful
[50:14] words, the effectual fervent prayer of a
[50:17] righteous man avaleth much. Amen. God
[50:20] bless you. You can have your seats
[50:22] tonight. And I want to continue our
[50:23] series on prayer that we've been doing.
[50:25] And and I want to take a a subtitle this
[50:27] evening of effective prayer. And I think
[50:30] if I was to ask for a show of hands, I
[50:32] won't. But if I was to ask for a show of
[50:34] hands, how many of us want to have an
[50:36] effective prayer life? I would say all
[50:38] of our hands would go up. Amen. But we
[50:40] can get in this mindset that we read uh
[50:43] certain scriptures and we we hear
[50:45] certain quotes and we can get into this
[50:46] mindset that if I if I really get down
[50:48] and I really pray and I'm really sincere
[50:51] and I really keep praying, then
[50:53] something's going to happen. And what's
[50:55] going to happen is what I'm praying for.
[50:57] What's happened is going to I'm going to
[50:58] get what I'm asking for. And and we can
[51:00] read scriptures like the ones I'm about
[51:02] to read and we can get ourselves into a
[51:04] mindset and it sets us up perhaps for a
[51:06] false expectation. Listen to these words
[51:08] of Jesus. He said, "Verily, verily, I
[51:10] say unto you, he that believeth on me.
[51:12] The works that I do shall he do also,
[51:13] and greater works than these shall he
[51:15] do, because I go unto my father. And
[51:17] whatsoever you shall ask in my name,
[51:19] whatsoever anything you ask in my name,
[51:21] that will I do, that the Father may be
[51:23] glorified in the Son. If you shall ask
[51:26] anything in my name, I will do it." And
[51:27] the church said, "Amen. Amen. That
[51:30] sounds like a wonderful promise." And it
[51:32] is a wonderful promise. Then he would
[51:34] say in John 15, he says, "You have not
[51:35] chosen me, but I've chosen you and
[51:37] ordained you that you should go and
[51:39] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[51:41] should remain that whatsoever you shall
[51:43] ask of the Father in my name, he may
[51:45] give it to you. Whatsoever you ask.
[51:47] He'll give it to you." John 16:24,
[51:50] "Hitherto have you asked nothing in my
[51:52] name." He says, "Ask and ye shall
[51:54] receive that your joy may be full." And
[51:57] there's tons of scriptures where Jesus
[51:58] would say this. Paul would say it in
[52:00] different places where you can and it
[52:02] seems like if you're a a Christian, if
[52:04] you're a believer, then you can ask
[52:06] whatever you want and you'll get it.
[52:10] If you took those just on on kind of the
[52:13] the flat basis of what's said there,
[52:15] that's what it would seem. And you can
[52:16] see people around this world that have
[52:18] built huge ministries that are
[52:20] successful based on the number of
[52:22] members and the amount of money that
[52:23] they bring in on scriptures like this.
[52:26] And then you take a quote like this one
[52:27] I'm about to read and it seems like
[52:29] we've got all this power to ask whatever
[52:31] we want so we can get whatever we want.
[52:33] Brother Bram says this. He says, "Prayer
[52:35] is the most vital force that God ever
[52:38] put into the hand of mankind."
[52:42] The most effective force that's known to
[52:45] man is prayer. He says, "Do you believe
[52:48] that it is it's prayer that changes
[52:51] things?" that when a prophet of God says
[52:53] something like the most vital uh force
[52:56] and the most effective force, my ears
[52:58] perk up because if there's something I
[53:00] want, it's to be effective. If there's
[53:02] force I want in my life, I want it to be
[53:04] effective force. I want it to be the
[53:05] real deal. Amen. And I pay attention to
[53:07] that because if it's so effective, I
[53:09] want it in my life. The prophet of God
[53:11] says, "You want to have a an effective
[53:12] prayer life, it's supposed to be
[53:14] effective." Amen. I want changing power.
[53:17] I want prayer that changes things. But
[53:19] we've got to put it in the context of
[53:21] what he's talking about. Amen. Prayer.
[53:23] God, brother Brandham would say, prayer
[53:25] is the way to be effective. And I hope
[53:27] we can say tonight, I have an effective
[53:29] prayer life. We ought to be able to say
[53:31] that as believers. Brother Brandham says
[53:33] this. He continues on. He says, "Now, if
[53:34] you ever want to do anything for me
[53:36] that'll please me, you pray for me.
[53:38] That's one thing I want you to do is
[53:40] pray for me because I know prayer
[53:42] changes things." Now, he says these
[53:43] words, "It even changes God's mind about
[53:46] things." changes God's program. He says,
[53:49] "Do you believe that God can pronounce a
[53:51] certain thing? It's going to be just
[53:52] that way." And prayer will change his
[53:54] mind about that. He says, "It has been
[53:57] done." Now, we've got to take that back
[53:59] to the scripture. We can't just take
[54:00] that as a blanket statement across
[54:02] everything. And as far as I know, this
[54:05] is just me. As far as I know, there's
[54:07] only one place in the scripture where
[54:08] you can see God truly changing his mind,
[54:11] or at least what looks like him changing
[54:13] his mind. Amen. There's only one place
[54:15] and that's where God told Hezekiah. He
[54:18] said, "Hezekiah, you're going to die."
[54:20] Hezekiah was a king. And he said,
[54:22] "You're going to die." And then Hezekiah
[54:24] went and he turned his face to the wall
[54:26] and he prayed to God. He said, "God, I
[54:28] want more time." And God sent the
[54:30] prophet back to him and said, "I'll give
[54:32] you another 15 years." And brother
[54:34] Brandon would use that as his example
[54:36] time and time again when he says things
[54:38] like this. So we have to keep it in the
[54:41] context and we have to understand the
[54:42] impact of what happens when we do this
[54:45] as well. Amen. Now listen to this. He
[54:48] says remember when Hezekiah was going to
[54:50] die the prophet went up and told him to
[54:52] get his house in order that Hezekiah
[54:54] turned his face to the wall and wept
[54:55] bitterly before the Lord. He said Lord
[54:58] he walked before him all those years
[54:59] with a perfect heart and he wanted to be
[55:01] spared 15 years and the prophet was
[55:03] gone. But the spirit of the Lord come
[55:05] upon the prophet said go back and tell
[55:07] him I heard his prayer. And after 3
[55:09] days, he's coming off the bed. He said,
[55:11] "God could have took him off the bed
[55:13] right then, couldn't he?" He says,
[55:14] "Don't you believe that?" He says, "But
[55:17] we have to know God's program and things
[55:20] just how he is." Okay, we're teaching
[55:26] tonight, but we can look at a situation
[55:27] and we can say this situation, we can
[55:29] say, "Well, God said his will was one
[55:31] thing, but Hezekiah was a righteous
[55:32] man." The scripture says he was a
[55:34] righteous man. He prayed earnestly for
[55:36] God to give him f more time. and God
[55:38] said it. See, we can change the the
[55:40] purpose and the plan of God. That's what
[55:42] we can read into that story. But notice
[55:44] how brother Brandham finishes this
[55:46] quote. He says, "But we have to know
[55:47] God's program and things just how he
[55:50] is." In other words, we have to bring
[55:52] this into context of God's program and
[55:54] how that he works. Amen. And there's a
[55:57] key thing to recognize there. And that's
[55:58] really where we want to focus tonight.
[56:00] But let's go back to scripture so we can
[56:02] read this for ourselves and then and
[56:03] then carry it through. In Isaiah 38
[56:05] says, "In those days was Hezekiah sick
[56:07] unto death. And Isaiah the prophet, the
[56:10] son of Amos came uh Amos came to him and
[56:12] said him unto him, thus sayeth the Lord,
[56:15] set thine house in order, for thou shalt
[56:16] die and not live." That Hezekiah turned
[56:19] his face towards the wall and prayed
[56:20] unto the Lord and said, "Remember now,
[56:22] oh Lord, I beseech thee, how I have
[56:24] walked before thee and truth and with a
[56:27] perfect heart, and have done that which
[56:28] is good in thy sight." And Hezekiah wept
[56:31] sore. Hezekiah really had a crying
[56:32] spell. He says, 'Lord, you look at my
[56:35] life. I've lived a good life. I've lived
[56:37] a righteous life. I've lived by your
[56:38] word. I've lived by your will.
[56:41] What What's up with this? Why am I going
[56:43] to die? I don't deserve to die.
[56:47] Amen.
[56:48] And it says, "Then came the word of the
[56:50] Lord to Isaiah, saying, Go and say to
[56:52] Hezekiah, thus sayeth the Lord, the God
[56:55] of David, thy father, I have heard thy
[56:57] prayer. I have seen thy tears. Behold, I
[57:00] will add unto thy day 15 years." Now, we
[57:03] can look at this and we can say, "See,
[57:04] the prayer of a righteous man changed
[57:06] God's mind."
[57:08] And it did.
[57:10] It changed God's decree. That's for
[57:12] sure. But we have to be so careful here
[57:14] because the question is, why are we
[57:17] trying to change God's mind?
[57:22] Okay, this this is going to be real
[57:23] teaching tonight. But I want you to ask
[57:25] yourself, why in the world would I ever
[57:28] want to change the mind of the almighty,
[57:31] all- knowing, allseeing God who knows
[57:34] the past, the present, and the FUTURE
[57:36] PERFECTLY? WHY WOULD I want to change
[57:38] that that that beings, that person's
[57:40] mind? But yet sometimes we absolutely
[57:43] do. Amen.
[57:45] We look at this and Hezekiah's prayer
[57:48] was not intended to change or or it was
[57:50] intended to change God's God's response,
[57:53] God's answer. And God honored that man's
[57:56] prayer.
[57:57] We might say that he changed his mind
[57:59] and in a way he did because he didn't
[58:00] die right then. But if we look at the
[58:02] result of Hezekiah's answered prayer, we
[58:06] see that Hezekiah living created more
[58:09] problems than Hezekiah dying.
[58:12] Right after the very next chapter, he
[58:14] comes off his bed after three days. A
[58:16] and and what happens is the king of
[58:17] Babylon sends some messengers to
[58:19] Hezekiah. And Hezekiah brings him in and
[58:22] he shows him all of the city of
[58:24] Jerusalem. He shows him all his toys. He
[58:27] shows them all of his treasures. He
[58:28] shows them every good thing that's in
[58:30] the city. And that's not the smartest
[58:32] thing to do. When people invaded
[58:34] countries for less, he showed them
[58:37] everything that they could have wanted.
[58:38] And he said, "Look at what I've got."
[58:40] And Isaiah the prophet comes to Hezekiah
[58:42] as soon as he's done that. He said, "Who
[58:44] was that?" And what did they want?
[58:45] Hezekiah said, "Oh, that was just that
[58:47] was just messengers from the king of
[58:48] Babylon. They were just here to to to
[58:50] bring peace and they just wanted to know
[58:51] how we were doing." And Isaiah said,
[58:52] "Are you nuts?" He said, "Thus sayeth
[58:55] the Lord." He says, "They're going to
[58:56] come back and they're going to take
[58:57] everything you show them, and they're
[58:58] going to put everyone into into
[58:59] slavery." He says, "The only favor, the
[59:02] only grace you have is that you won't be
[59:03] alive when it happens."
[59:06] That's what happened when a man changed
[59:08] the mind of God.
[59:10] Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; The point I'm trying to make here is
[59:12] that our goal should not be in prayer to
[59:15] get our way.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we say amen to that? Again,
[59:19] the goal is not to get our way. The goal
[59:22] is to find out God's will and plan.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; That's what we're supposed to be doing.
[59:27] Amen. Our goal shouldn't be to get what
[59:29] we want or or to get things going our
[59:31] way. Because like we preached on Sunday,
[59:33] we're sheep. We can't lead ourselves.
[59:35] And if we if we lead ourselves and we
[59:37] insist on our way, then guess what? We
[59:40] can't be in God's way if we're in our
[59:42] way. We can't be in God's will if we're
[59:44] in our will. And so, the purpose of
[59:46] prayer is to bring us there. Hezekiah's
[59:48] prayer was far worse being answered than
[59:51] it was if he just let things go the way
[59:54] that God had said to do it. God knew
[59:56] best. And God was protecting the kingdom
[59:58] from Hezekiah's own nature. Even as a
[1:00:01] righteous man, God God saw what was
[1:00:04] coming. You know, the scripture, I want
[1:00:06] you to catch something here. The
[1:00:07] scripture, remember, says it's given in
[1:00:09] one in one place says it's given for our
[1:00:11] admonition.
[1:00:13] In other words, it's for us to learn
[1:00:14] without going through the pain and the
[1:00:16] suffering and the damage that we would
[1:00:18] go through otherwise. Amen. Sometimes we
[1:00:20] we we face tough situations. We we face
[1:00:23] tough decisions. We we face things that
[1:00:25] we say we that on the face of it we say
[1:00:28] that can't be God's will. Hezekiah dying
[1:00:32] is a good king. He's a good man. Why
[1:00:33] would he have to die? Amen. But remember
[1:00:36] sometimes and and what we're looking for
[1:00:38] is that situation to go away. We want
[1:00:40] the situation to change. And that's what
[1:00:43] we would call victory.
[1:00:45] That's what we would call an answer to
[1:00:47] prayer. Amen. But too often remember
[1:00:49] what brother Bram said. He said
[1:00:50] overcoming means to stand the test. And
[1:00:53] what we're saying is, "Don't take me
[1:00:54] through the test. Take the test away.
[1:00:57] That's not overcoming. That's not
[1:00:58] victory.
[1:01:01] That's just ease of life. That's just
[1:01:03] comfort. That's just pain avoidance."
[1:01:04] Amen. But too often we're saying, "Lord,
[1:01:07] take that away." And we think that of
[1:01:08] victory rather than saying, "God, take
[1:01:10] me through it without complaining.
[1:01:13] God, take me through it without losing
[1:01:15] my faith. God, take me through it
[1:01:17] without losing my my worship and my
[1:01:19] praise. God, take me through it without
[1:01:20] me losing my church attendance.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, let me go through it without not
[1:01:25] without without uh not losing the
[1:01:27] ability to raise my hand or raise my my
[1:01:29] voice and worship to you.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, let me go through it without
[1:01:33] losing my thankfulness.
[1:01:35] That'll be overcoming. But too often we
[1:01:38] want to change the situation by prayer
[1:01:40] rather than have ourselves changed by
[1:01:42] prayer. Amen. The victory we're needing
[1:01:44] many times is a right attitude.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did Paul say? He said, "In
[1:01:50] everything
[1:01:52] give thanks for this is the will of God
[1:01:55] in Christ Jesus concerning you." That's
[1:01:58] an overcomer's attitude. In everything
[1:02:01] give thanks no matter what happens. Paul
[1:02:03] would say this about himself.
[1:02:06] He said, "Not that I speak in respect of
[1:02:07] want." He says, "For I have learned in
[1:02:09] whatsoever state I am therewith to be
[1:02:12] content
[1:02:14] in whatever state of life, in whatever
[1:02:17] the conditions are, in whatever my
[1:02:19] health is, and whether I'm in jail or in
[1:02:22] a nice hotel, he says, I've learned to
[1:02:24] be content." He says, "I know both how
[1:02:26] to be abased." That word means
[1:02:29] humiliated.
[1:02:32] I know how to go through humiliation. I
[1:02:34] know how to abound, to exceed, to have
[1:02:36] abundance, to have plenty to spare, to
[1:02:38] be overflowing. So Paul says, I've been
[1:02:41] humiliated and I've had more than I
[1:02:43] needed.
[1:02:44] He says, "Everywhere and in all things,
[1:02:46] I am instructed both to be full and to
[1:02:48] be hungry, both to abound and to suffer
[1:02:50] need." He says, "I can do all things
[1:02:53] through Christ which strengthens me."
[1:02:56] Paul did not say, "I can defeat every
[1:02:59] situation
[1:03:02] through Christ which strengthens me.
[1:03:04] He said, "I can go through every
[1:03:07] situation through Christ which
[1:03:08] strengthens me." Whether I'm in need,
[1:03:11] whether I'm in humiliation, whether it's
[1:03:12] a time of breaking me down, whether it's
[1:03:14] a time of building me up, whether it's a
[1:03:16] time where I have lots of needs, whether
[1:03:17] a time it's I have everything, I need
[1:03:19] Christ through it all. Because here's
[1:03:20] the thing, when we have needs, we
[1:03:21] definitely need Christ, don't we? When
[1:03:24] we don't have money in the bank, when we
[1:03:25] don't have health, when things aren't
[1:03:27] going so well with the business, when I,
[1:03:28] you know, when school is tough, oh, I
[1:03:30] need you, Lord, right now. But I'll tell
[1:03:32] you this, church, you need him more when
[1:03:33] you have everything because he'll keep
[1:03:35] you in balance. He'll keep you seeking
[1:03:38] him. He'll keep you dwelling on him.
[1:03:40] He'll keep you thankful. He'll keep you
[1:03:42] centered on your kingdom purpose. It's
[1:03:44] when we have a lot, we tend to fall away
[1:03:46] from God. We got to learn to be close to
[1:03:49] him no matter what. The simple answer is
[1:03:51] we need Christ no matter what.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; That's for sure. Brother Ram says it
[1:03:55] this way. He says, "And then we wonder
[1:03:56] in the scriptures when it's written, all
[1:03:58] things work together for good to them
[1:04:00] that love God." Many times, catch this,
[1:04:03] when maybe the lash of his correction is
[1:04:06] laying upon us, and we wonder how it
[1:04:09] could be working for the good,
[1:04:12] but after it's all over, then we look
[1:04:16] back and we praise him for it because he
[1:04:20] knows we do not. We just act obedient to
[1:04:24] his word and to his chastising. He says
[1:04:27] he never did chastise us unless we had
[1:04:30] need of it. He says, "And sometimes we
[1:04:32] might think that we weren't guilty, but
[1:04:34] he knows." And he says, "And maybe we
[1:04:36] are not, but he knows just how to do it
[1:04:40] to make it all work good." Look at what
[1:04:43] he says here. He says, "The lash of his
[1:04:45] correction." And that seems like a harsh
[1:04:46] statement, but let me tell you
[1:04:48] something, church. The things we learn
[1:04:50] in hardship are the lessons we keep
[1:04:52] forever.
[1:04:54] You learn something the hard way, you'll
[1:04:56] never forget it. I've talked about what
[1:04:58] happened in Texas with the pastor there
[1:05:00] and how we allowed the the idea that we
[1:05:02] needed a pastor and we needed a a
[1:05:04] ministry gift in the church. We allowed
[1:05:06] that to override the word requirements
[1:05:08] for a man in that position and we didn't
[1:05:10] hold him to it. And we paid a very dear
[1:05:12] price for that.
[1:05:15] That's a hard lesson to learn, but I've
[1:05:17] never forgotten it. And it hasn't
[1:05:19] mattered who it is that wants to be my
[1:05:21] friend, who it is whose friend I want to
[1:05:23] be, what kind of gift, what kind of
[1:05:24] ministry they have. Since that time, by
[1:05:26] God's grace, I have never allowed a man
[1:05:28] to raise himself above the word of God.
[1:05:31] That's a key in the ministry because
[1:05:34] otherwise you'll come under the
[1:05:35] influence of men instead of the Holy
[1:05:36] Spirit. You'll come under the influence
[1:05:38] of those you want to please in a church
[1:05:40] in these different things. you you put
[1:05:42] anything above the word and it will
[1:05:44] become an idol and it'll have power
[1:05:45] inside of your life. God knew that I had
[1:05:47] to learn that. Amen. And so the other
[1:05:49] thing is is that sometimes God's putting
[1:05:51] us through what seems a hard time now
[1:05:54] because the thing is we can't afford to
[1:05:56] make this mistake down the road. In
[1:05:58] other words, there's going to come a
[1:05:59] situation down the road where you've got
[1:06:01] to have this principle figured out. And
[1:06:04] so God will drive it in through hardship
[1:06:07] so that when the time comes, it's not
[1:06:10] even a question of what you're going to
[1:06:11] do because you've learned it the hard
[1:06:13] way. And you say, "Lord, I know exactly
[1:06:15] what you want me to do here." And we can
[1:06:17] walk through that and it doesn't have
[1:06:18] any effect on us. Amen. There's
[1:06:20] situations coming down the road where
[1:06:21] you can't afford to learn the lesson the
[1:06:23] hard way. It have a greater impact.
[1:06:26] Listen, if I make mistakes now as a
[1:06:27] husband, as a father, as a preacher, as
[1:06:30] a pastor,
[1:06:32] the impact is far wider than when I did
[1:06:34] it when I was just me alone, as a single
[1:06:36] young man. See, the further you go in
[1:06:39] responsibility in the kingdom, the
[1:06:41] greater the impact of our failures. And
[1:06:43] so, God has to work hard. Brother
[1:06:45] Brandham talks about it. He says, you
[1:06:46] got, you know, God's got to take his man
[1:06:48] out on the back side of the desert and
[1:06:50] teach him. And backside the desert's not
[1:06:52] a fun place to be. But God's trying to
[1:06:54] teach us lessons so that when we come
[1:06:56] back and we're into our ministries, we
[1:06:58] know how to handle certain things and we
[1:06:59] don't get moved around by the by the
[1:07:01] winds of society or what people want or
[1:07:03] expect or these different things.
[1:07:06] Brother Brown will continue on. He says
[1:07:07] this, "What a beautiful thing it is just
[1:07:11] to lay your life in his hands and say,
[1:07:13] "Here am I, Lord. Just use me now. lead
[1:07:17] me and guide me and direct me in the way
[1:07:20] that would be pleasing unto thee. Can we
[1:07:23] say amen tonight? He says, "And then
[1:07:26] what do we do? Don't murmur no matter
[1:07:29] what the path is. Stay with it anyhow
[1:07:32] and God will work it." All right. He
[1:07:33] says, "The footsteps of the righteous
[1:07:35] are ordered by the Lord." He says, "And
[1:07:37] that scripture is true." Can we say amen
[1:07:40] again? Lord, let me be yielded. Lord,
[1:07:42] let me be willing. Let me not murmur
[1:07:45] when things aren't quite as easy or as
[1:07:47] fun or as enjoyable as we might want.
[1:07:50] You know, some of us crave variability.
[1:07:52] It's not me. Some of us like to have
[1:07:55] variety all the time. My wife will tell
[1:07:57] you I can eat the same thing breakfast,
[1:07:59] lunch, and dinner almost for years. I
[1:08:02] did it all through university. I've been
[1:08:03] drinking smoothies for breakfast for 15,
[1:08:06] 20 years now. I love it. But some people
[1:08:10] that would drive them crazy. I have a
[1:08:13] feeling brother Vichael would not want
[1:08:14] to eat the same thing for breakfast
[1:08:15] every day. He craves variety
[1:08:18] and sometimes God puts us in a place
[1:08:20] where we don't get variety and we say
[1:08:22] this is no fun
[1:08:24] and I just got to do the same thing over
[1:08:26] and over and over again. You know what?
[1:08:28] That's mostly the Christian walk is that
[1:08:30] steady straight just doing the right
[1:08:32] thing over and over and over again.
[1:08:34] Amen. But you take an evangelist or
[1:08:36] missionary, those are the guys that get
[1:08:38] variability.
[1:08:41] But mom's staying at home, it's pretty
[1:08:43] straight every day, isn't it? Father's
[1:08:45] going to work, it's pretty straight
[1:08:47] every day. It's the same thing that we
[1:08:48] have to do. But what God has called us
[1:08:50] to, brother says, don't murmur. No
[1:08:52] matter what the path is, stay with it
[1:08:54] anyhow and God will work it all right.
[1:08:56] You know, I've gone down some pretty
[1:08:57] strange paths in my mind. And it gets
[1:09:00] strange when you get into situations and
[1:09:01] you think, is this really God's will?
[1:09:04] Because you're going through hard times
[1:09:06] and you're dealing with tough situations
[1:09:08] and things aren't maybe going the way
[1:09:09] you thought they were going to go. We've
[1:09:10] got to have faith in those moments that
[1:09:12] he's called me. He's placed me there and
[1:09:14] he wants me to do it. And I can say this
[1:09:16] after 16 years away from Newfoundland. I
[1:09:18] can say this, God knows what he's doing.
[1:09:20] God knows exactly how to get us where he
[1:09:23] wants us to be and be be ready for the
[1:09:25] moment that he's called us to. Amen.
[1:09:26] That's the only reason I can even think
[1:09:28] of being your pastor tonight is because
[1:09:30] God has prepared me especially for those
[1:09:33] things.
[1:09:34] But we got to keep him in the first
[1:09:36] place. And brother Bram says this said
[1:09:38] God must have first place in your heart.
[1:09:40] We're talking about effective prayer
[1:09:41] now. God must have first place in your
[1:09:44] heart,
[1:09:46] first place in your life. Notice he's
[1:09:49] he's not letting us get away with I've
[1:09:51] got a good heart.
[1:09:54] It does no good if it stays in here and
[1:09:56] doesn't come out into our lives.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. First place in our heart, first
[1:10:00] place in your life, first place in
[1:10:03] everything that you do and what you are.
[1:10:05] God must be first. He doesn't want the
[1:10:07] second place. He doesn't deserve the
[1:10:08] second place. He deserves the best and
[1:10:11] the first. He says, "And all that we've
[1:10:13] got, he deserves it." Now, catch this.
[1:10:15] He says, "Oh, we need to seek the will
[1:10:18] of God." Not the favor of your neighbor,
[1:10:22] not the favor of your children, not the
[1:10:24] favor of your husband or your wife. I
[1:10:26] can say this as a husband and a father.
[1:10:27] Sometimes the hardest thing to do is
[1:10:28] make a decision that is going to that
[1:10:30] your wife doesn't agree with and your
[1:10:32] children are going to be disappointed
[1:10:33] in. It's hard to be the bad guy
[1:10:36] sometimes. A brother says, "You got to
[1:10:38] seek God's will, not the even the favor
[1:10:40] of your own family." He says, "But seek
[1:10:43] the will of God and do that first. Then
[1:10:47] everything else, the will of the wife,
[1:10:48] the will of the children will fall right
[1:10:49] in with it." He says, "But place God
[1:10:51] first." You know, we look at Balum.
[1:10:54] Balam was one that that that that had
[1:10:56] people come to him and wanted him to do
[1:10:58] something. And he went and he found the
[1:11:00] will of God. And then he went he kept
[1:11:03] trying to change the will of God to
[1:11:04] please the people that were around him.
[1:11:06] Amen. I like the way that that brother I
[1:11:09] think it was brother Jason Watkins said
[1:11:10] it. He says he was a real pro he was a
[1:11:13] he was a a false he had a real gift in a
[1:11:17] false vessel.
[1:11:19] Because in the end what Balam wanted was
[1:11:21] Balum.
[1:11:23] He wanted what self wanted. He wanted
[1:11:24] what this flesh wanted. He didn't want
[1:11:26] what God wanted. Now remember what
[1:11:27] happened. The king of Midian sent
[1:11:29] people. He sent messengers to Balum. He
[1:11:30] said Balam come. I got a people for you
[1:11:32] to curse and and they're they're
[1:11:34] annoying me and they're bothering me and
[1:11:36] I want you to curse them because if
[1:11:37] you're a prophet of God and you curse
[1:11:38] them, they're going to be cursed. Now
[1:11:40] listen to this. Listen to what brother
[1:11:42] Brandham says. He says, "Now here was a
[1:11:43] man who was a prophet of God. And when
[1:11:46] he was to be hired to come over and
[1:11:47] curse another people of God, notice he
[1:11:50] went to seek the will of God." Good,
[1:11:52] good start. He says, "And he wanted to
[1:11:54] know his perfect will and God gave him
[1:11:57] his perfect will in the matter."
[1:12:01] He says his perfect will was presented
[1:12:02] to him. What was his will? Don't you go.
[1:12:04] He says that's God's first word. Don't
[1:12:07] go with them. Don't you try to attack my
[1:12:09] people walking in my perfect ways.
[1:12:11] Church, if you want to know God's will,
[1:12:13] he'll show you. There's no reason for
[1:12:15] God not to show you. If you want to know
[1:12:17] his will, you've got to be able to find
[1:12:20] it. Amen. Don't settle for anything less
[1:12:22] than his will, but when you've got it,
[1:12:24] don't try and push it. Because that's
[1:12:26] what Balam tried to do. He says, "Now
[1:12:28] notice here, as a prophet of God, in
[1:12:31] other words, his position in the kingdom
[1:12:34] should have kept him from something." He
[1:12:35] said, "He should not have been caught in
[1:12:38] such a group as that to begin with." In
[1:12:41] other words, his job as a prophet is not
[1:12:43] to take cues from society, from
[1:12:46] politics,
[1:12:47] from culture.
[1:12:49] This has no place in the in the in the
[1:12:52] life of a prophet. A prophet's job is to
[1:12:54] get thus sayeth the Lord and repeat it
[1:12:57] word for word and then go back and wait
[1:12:59] for another word from God. Amen. A
[1:13:02] prophet can't be for hire. Money is not
[1:13:05] part of the dues of a prophet. Remember
[1:13:08] what Samuel said? He told the people,
[1:13:09] "Listen, I haven't taken a thing from
[1:13:11] you." He was showing the path of a true
[1:13:14] prophet. Amen. But what you hang you you
[1:13:17] you get caught up in a group like that,
[1:13:19] they'll drag you if you hang around.
[1:13:23] My wife and I, I was I was sharing
[1:13:24] something I'd seen of a of a professing
[1:13:26] believer on social media today, and I
[1:13:28] said, "I haven't seen him in a while,
[1:13:30] but it just seems like, you know, she's
[1:13:31] she's a certain way now, and it doesn't
[1:13:33] look right. There's something off
[1:13:34] there." And she said, "Oh, well, maybe
[1:13:36] they've gone to this church."
[1:13:39] Because in that church, the women do
[1:13:40] things with their hair and they do
[1:13:41] things with makeup and they do things
[1:13:43] with their dress. And when she said it,
[1:13:44] I'm like, "Maybe that's true cuz she
[1:13:46] looks exactly like the people in that
[1:13:47] church." She said, "Yeah, I noticed
[1:13:48] sister so and so has gone there now and
[1:13:50] now she's trimming her hair and stuff."
[1:13:52] Why? Cuz the sisters there do it. You
[1:13:54] get around the wrong group. Watch what
[1:13:55] happens. You get around a compromising
[1:13:57] group, it'll turn you into a
[1:13:59] compromiser. That's what happened with
[1:14:01] Balum. Absolutely. Amen. He says he
[1:14:03] shouldn't have gone with them, but watch
[1:14:05] for popularity sake, for conscience
[1:14:07] sake, for his wallet's sake. He said,
[1:14:09] "Well, stay all night and I'll try
[1:14:10] again." He says, "What do you want to
[1:14:12] try again for?"
[1:14:15] God has come down and said, "Balam,
[1:14:19] who are these people
[1:14:23] in your house?"
[1:14:27] Balam invited them in
[1:14:30] when they offered him something he was
[1:14:32] not allowed to take as a prophet. He
[1:14:35] invited trouble into his house. God
[1:14:37] said, "Baam, who is this?" And Baalam
[1:14:39] told him who it was and he says, "God,
[1:14:40] they want to, you know, they want me to
[1:14:42] go and curse people." God said, "Don't
[1:14:43] do it." Balam said, "Okay, I'm going to
[1:14:45] go back again." God said, "If they're
[1:14:47] there in the morning, you can go." And
[1:14:49] when he woke up in the morning, they
[1:14:50] were gone. And what did he do? He chased
[1:14:52] them down. Amen. But look, he says, "I'm
[1:14:55] going to try again." He says, "What do
[1:14:56] you want to try that? What do you want
[1:14:57] to try again for?" That's something I'll
[1:15:00] say as a pastor, as a minister, when
[1:15:02] you're dealing with people and the will
[1:15:04] of God's made clear by his word and we
[1:15:07] keep trying to find ways to go around so
[1:15:09] we can get what we want, that's when I
[1:15:11] know we've got a soul problem.
[1:15:13] There's another influence there. And
[1:15:14] it's not the Holy Spirit that's trying
[1:15:16] to get us to find a way so we can have
[1:15:18] our way and still say we're in God's
[1:15:19] will. It doesn't work that way. When
[1:15:21] God's given you his will, find it, stay
[1:15:24] there, and don't move from it. You're
[1:15:26] better off if you do that. Amen. When
[1:15:28] God shows us his plan, the best thing we
[1:15:30] can do is say, "Yes, Lord." And then we
[1:15:32] keep trucking. Do exactly what he says.
[1:15:34] You know, let me take it as a personal
[1:15:36] example tonight. I I've shared this with
[1:15:38] some of you. When I came to
[1:15:39] Newfoundland, I I I I made a really good
[1:15:42] living when I was in British Columbia.
[1:15:43] My costs were low and my income was
[1:15:45] high, relatively speaking. We always had
[1:15:47] money at the end of the month. When I
[1:15:49] came to Newfoundland, I took a lower
[1:15:51] salary and then working for where I do,
[1:15:54] they take a m a big chunk of money out
[1:15:56] of pension for for pension. And when I
[1:15:59] got my first paycheck, I started a a
[1:16:02] complaint with the payroll department
[1:16:04] because I thought they'd only paid me
[1:16:05] for one week. That was the difference.
[1:16:09] And they said, "No, no, you've been paid
[1:16:11] for your two weeks." And I I called my
[1:16:12] wife or I told my wife, I said, "We're
[1:16:14] going to have to trim some things here.
[1:16:16] The lifestyle changed drastically." And
[1:16:18] so I'm looking at that and I went from
[1:16:20] making this much to making this much.
[1:16:22] Expenses are still there. I still got a
[1:16:24] family to raise and all these different
[1:16:26] things. Taxes are higher here and
[1:16:27] whatnot. So I'm making less and they're
[1:16:29] taking more. That means I've got to
[1:16:31] adjust. And the first thing that came to
[1:16:33] my mind is I said, "I can start flipping
[1:16:36] things. I can buy things and I can
[1:16:38] resell them for more than I paid. I'm
[1:16:39] good at it. I like to do it. I like
[1:16:41] finding deals. It's something that that
[1:16:42] that I enjoy doing. But you know what I
[1:16:46] did? I went and I prayed about it
[1:16:49] and I said, "Lord, this is what I'm
[1:16:51] thinking of doing to supplement my
[1:16:53] income
[1:16:54] so that we can just get along a little
[1:16:56] easier here." And you know what God
[1:16:59] said? Don't do it.
[1:17:03] He said, "You focus on ministry because
[1:17:06] you're here for ministry."
[1:17:09] So, I didn't do that. And you know how
[1:17:11] much
[1:17:13] annoyance there is when you see a
[1:17:15] smoking deal on Facebook Marketplace
[1:17:17] that just popped up one minute ago and
[1:17:20] you can go and buy it and you know you
[1:17:22] can flip it for $5,000 more, but he said
[1:17:25] don't do it.
[1:17:27] Now, maybe you don't know that
[1:17:28] annoyance. For me, that can be very
[1:17:30] frustrating. Then when you have to buy a
[1:17:32] car that you weren't planning to buy,
[1:17:35] you know what the temptation is? Well, I
[1:17:37] can just make a couple deals so I can
[1:17:39] get a bit more money so I can more
[1:17:40] easily afford this new car that I wasn't
[1:17:42] planning to buy. New to me, which I do.
[1:17:44] I did buy a car, by the way. I'm going
[1:17:45] to go to Cornerbrook next week and pick
[1:17:46] it up by God's grace. But you know how
[1:17:50] tempting that is to say, listen, the
[1:17:52] Lord will understand.
[1:17:56] The Lord doesn't understand.
[1:18:00] That's not the way he works. Saul said,
[1:18:04] "The Lord will understand." Amen. Come
[1:18:07] on now.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; We think the Lord sees my situation.
[1:18:11] He'll understand if I don't do exactly
[1:18:14] what I know to do. I'm being your pastor
[1:18:17] tonight. I'm using my own life as an
[1:18:20] example. The temptation to do it is so
[1:18:22] strong because the situation warrants my
[1:18:26] disobedience. I have a need God will
[1:18:29] understand. God won't understand and God
[1:18:31] won't honor it.
[1:18:33] Bashel's grinning. I must be hitting the
[1:18:35] point here somehow somewhere.
[1:18:39] We don't get a pass because the
[1:18:41] situation is in any way dire or
[1:18:44] necessary
[1:18:46] emergency.
[1:18:48] No, that's when we prove who he is
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; by staying right in the channel of his
[1:18:53] will.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we're supposed to do.
[1:18:57] Listen, he said God already told him
[1:18:58] what to say. God said, tell him you're
[1:19:00] not going. That's his original word. I'm
[1:19:03] not going and you don't go. Don't you
[1:19:05] curse what I bless. He says, now watch
[1:19:07] how it backfired on him after a while.
[1:19:09] He says, see, and it will every time.
[1:19:15] He says when God says anything, he means
[1:19:18] it. He doesn't change his mind about it.
[1:19:21] He stays right with his word. No matter
[1:19:22] what anyone else says, he stays right
[1:19:24] with that word. So what's his
[1:19:26] expectation of us? We stay right with
[1:19:28] that word. He says, "But yet Balam said,
[1:19:30] you stay all night and I'll try again."
[1:19:33] See, he had the word. You don't have to
[1:19:35] argue anymore about it. God has done
[1:19:37] said so. But he said with a group like
[1:19:39] that, they always talk you out of the
[1:19:42] will of God if you'll let them.
[1:19:47] Those of us that work with
[1:19:50] unbelievers
[1:19:51] and even or I would say especially
[1:19:54] professing Christians, we have to be so
[1:19:56] careful of the influence that we allow
[1:19:58] them to have on us.
[1:20:01] Because remember, if you hang around a
[1:20:04] group like that, they'll always talk you
[1:20:06] out of the will of God. Midionites were
[1:20:09] related to Moses by marriage.
[1:20:12] That was his own kin.
[1:20:15] That was his own kin that was doing
[1:20:16] this. Amen. You know, I've had I've had
[1:20:19] brothers in the church ask me, Brother
[1:20:21] Joe, I would say more than anyone, maybe
[1:20:23] brother Kingsley a bit. you know, he's
[1:20:24] asked my opinion on his business affairs
[1:20:26] based on, you know, my management
[1:20:27] experience and and having, you know,
[1:20:30] responsibility for profit and loss and
[1:20:31] companies and that. And you know, me,
[1:20:34] I'm always willing to give my opinion,
[1:20:36] but in the end, you know what I say to
[1:20:38] him? I say, Joe, in the end, your
[1:20:42] business is between you and one person,
[1:20:45] Almighty God. I said, "Because you've
[1:20:49] done things I don't agree with as a
[1:20:51] businessman
[1:20:52] and yet you have succeeded."
[1:20:56] So I said, 'If God has blessed you by
[1:20:58] you following his leadership, who am I
[1:21:01] to tell you to do something different?
[1:21:05] Amen.
[1:21:07] I'll give a professional opinion, but
[1:21:10] that's not going to cut it.
[1:21:13] What is it?
[1:21:15] be led by God.
[1:21:17] Brother Chad, be led by God. Brother
[1:21:20] Kingsley, be led by God. We can have all
[1:21:23] of our education, all our training. We
[1:21:25] can have our franchise telling us what
[1:21:27] to do. We can have other business
[1:21:28] leaders telling us what we could do. We
[1:21:30] can see other people what they're doing
[1:21:31] and we say, "I should do that." No. Be
[1:21:33] led of God. Sons of God are led by the
[1:21:36] spirit of God. Same thing for our jobs.
[1:21:39] We can be clawing and fighting to get
[1:21:41] the position, get the promotion, get the
[1:21:43] pay raise, and you know what God says?
[1:21:46] Just let me handle that. Brother Marcus
[1:21:48] said he's never never tried to be
[1:21:50] promoted in his life. And they kept
[1:21:52] promoting him, didn't they?
[1:21:54] I won't say I never tried to be
[1:21:56] promoted,
[1:21:59] but God always gave me a promotion.
[1:22:02] And it was when I saw other people that
[1:22:04] I felt had worked there longer, had
[1:22:05] deserved it more, and yet God would
[1:22:07] grant me grace and favor with people. We
[1:22:10] don't have to fight for things. Amen.
[1:22:13] God loves to give us things that we can
[1:22:16] handle. Amen.
[1:22:19] One thing I can say though is this. We
[1:22:22] read it earlier. Brother Bram said,
[1:22:23] "Give God first place." You give him
[1:22:25] first place in your business, in your
[1:22:28] job, in your schooling, in your home, in
[1:22:31] your marriage, your finances, whatever
[1:22:32] it might be. You give him first place
[1:22:35] and he will always take care of you.
[1:22:40] Always.
[1:22:42] Always. Amen. Because here's the thing,
[1:22:45] church. When you go and you have a need
[1:22:48] now, let's say it's it's in your
[1:22:49] business, and you say, "Lord, I need
[1:22:51] more contracts. Lord, I need more work.
[1:22:55] I got bills to pay and not enough things
[1:22:56] coming in to pay for it. Now, you've got
[1:22:58] a foundation to stand on because you
[1:23:01] say, "Lord, you know my heart and you
[1:23:04] know my life and they're in alignment.
[1:23:06] I've given you first place and now I'm
[1:23:09] asking you to back your word up to
[1:23:11] provide the needs that I have in my
[1:23:12] business, in my job, in my schooling, or
[1:23:14] whatever it might be." Like I said, I
[1:23:16] never skipped church, as far as I know,
[1:23:18] for exams or tests in university. Why?
[1:23:21] because I trusted that if I did what God
[1:23:24] expects me to do, then he'd take care of
[1:23:26] me. And he always did. And I'm a
[1:23:28] testimony to those things. Proverbs 3
[1:23:30] says this, "Trust in the Lord with all
[1:23:33] thine heart, and lean not under thine
[1:23:36] own understanding. In all thy ways
[1:23:38] acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
[1:23:41] paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes."
[1:23:44] That's something I really had to learn.
[1:23:47] Like I said before, a bit of a
[1:23:48] know-it-all. And I had to realize that I
[1:23:51] don't know anything compared to God. I
[1:23:56] don't see anything compared to God. And
[1:23:58] because of that, it's better if I let
[1:23:59] him do the leading than I do the
[1:24:01] leading. Be not wise in thine own eyes.
[1:24:03] He said, "Fear the Lord and depart from
[1:24:05] evil." But let me give you some
[1:24:07] encouragement tonight. Because when God
[1:24:09] has shown you what to do and God's made
[1:24:12] it clear what he wants you to do, do it.
[1:24:15] Don't move from it. Stay exactly in the
[1:24:18] channel that God has shown you. Amen.
[1:24:20] And when he wants you to do something
[1:24:22] different, he'll let you turn that
[1:24:23] corner. He'll make the corner happen.
[1:24:26] Amen. For a believer's life, we ought to
[1:24:28] be straight lines all the way until God
[1:24:31] gets us to turn a corner. And he'll help
[1:24:32] us to do those things. Amen. There's a
[1:24:34] great blessing in just being faithful to
[1:24:36] what God has called you to do. No matter
[1:24:40] how big it is, how little it is.
[1:24:42] Remember, you got to prove yourself
[1:24:44] yourself in the small things first. God
[1:24:47] has never promoted somebody to greatness
[1:24:49] and it gone well. They've always had to
[1:24:51] go through the trials. They've had to go
[1:24:53] through the preparation. We see King
[1:24:54] Saul. King Saul got promoted into
[1:24:56] greatness without training. And we see
[1:24:58] what a what a dog's breakfast that
[1:25:00] turned into. Brother Aram says this. He
[1:25:03] says, "We are God's servant in the field
[1:25:04] that he has placed us in. No matter how
[1:25:07] little it is or how great, it's just the
[1:25:09] same in the sight of God. always the
[1:25:11] same to act right in the place where
[1:25:14] you're at. He says always, it's a great
[1:25:17] thing to follow the Lord. I'd rather go
[1:25:18] and have a church with 50 people in it
[1:25:21] in the will of God than to have 5,000
[1:25:23] out of the will of God. Can I take his
[1:25:25] words and flip it? I'd rather have $50
[1:25:28] in my bank account in the will of God
[1:25:30] than 5,000 in my bank account out of the
[1:25:32] will of God.
[1:25:34] Put your metric in there. I'd rather
[1:25:36] have straight A I'd rather have straight
[1:25:37] C's in the will of God than straight A's
[1:25:40] out of the will of God. I'd rather have
[1:25:43] I'd rather have five people like me in
[1:25:45] the will of God than everybody like me
[1:25:46] out of the will of God. Whatever it is
[1:25:48] turns your crank. Whatever it is that
[1:25:50] you enjoy in life, whatever thing it is
[1:25:52] that you think is important for you to
[1:25:53] be good at, he says, listen, better to
[1:25:56] have little in God's favor than a lot in
[1:25:59] man's favor.
[1:26:01] He says, listen to this. I love this.
[1:26:03] God can do more with a man in his will
[1:26:06] in one hour than he could do with a man
[1:26:09] out of his will in 50 years.
[1:26:13] He says, see, he's stumbling and
[1:26:15] staggering like shooting in the dark.
[1:26:17] But when a man is really in the will of
[1:26:19] God and knows his calling, he should
[1:26:22] abide there. Now, he's generally talking
[1:26:24] about ministers there. Amen. But let me
[1:26:26] tell you, it goes for every single role
[1:26:28] that you play in the kingdom of God. If
[1:26:30] you're a father, if you're a mother, if
[1:26:32] you're a wife, if you're a husband, if
[1:26:33] you're a teacher, if you're a mechanic,
[1:26:35] if you're a machinist, if you're a
[1:26:36] business owner, if you're a manager,
[1:26:38] whatever it might be, and wherever you
[1:26:41] are in the will of God is where you'll
[1:26:44] be effective. Because if God has placed
[1:26:47] you there, he's placed you there to be
[1:26:50] effective. God doesn't place us there to
[1:26:53] be ineffective.
[1:26:55] God places us there to fulfill his work
[1:26:57] and his word. Amen. And this ties into
[1:27:00] prayer so tightly is that your prayers
[1:27:02] are effective when you're in the place
[1:27:03] and the channel that God wants you to be
[1:27:05] in. Amen. When we're in our position,
[1:27:08] see what happens is God allows us to see
[1:27:10] things and experience things in our
[1:27:13] position that other people won't grasp
[1:27:15] because that's not where they're working
[1:27:17] and walking day by day. But he can come
[1:27:19] to you and he can help you to see a
[1:27:20] situation. He can help you to see a
[1:27:22] need. He can help you to see a problem.
[1:27:24] And then we can be effective because we
[1:27:26] take that as a burden in our lives and
[1:27:28] we start to go to God about it and God
[1:27:30] starts to work on it. Amen. You mothers,
[1:27:34] God wants you to be effective in your
[1:27:36] home. He wants you to be effective in
[1:27:38] teaching your children. He wants you to
[1:27:40] be effective in keeping up the
[1:27:42] household. He wants you to be effective
[1:27:44] as you're in the homeschool group and as
[1:27:46] you walk around this world and you go
[1:27:47] and get groceries and you fill up with
[1:27:49] gas and you do these different things.
[1:27:50] You are a walking testimony just by how
[1:27:53] you look. But he wants more than just a
[1:27:56] silent witness. He wants an effective
[1:27:59] witness that can interact and can talk
[1:28:01] to people about the things of God. Amen.
[1:28:04] And then as you go about your day, God
[1:28:05] can drop a burden in a mother's heart
[1:28:07] that she can pray for in a way that
[1:28:09] nobody else can because she's in her
[1:28:11] role. She's in her position. She's in
[1:28:12] her place and she's got a burden for
[1:28:14] things that impact
[1:28:17] the world that she's walking in. Amen.
[1:28:20] And then we can take that and we can
[1:28:21] rest in being right in the line of duty
[1:28:24] doing what God wants us to do. It's a
[1:28:26] wonderful thing to be in the line of
[1:28:28] duty because you know that whatever you
[1:28:29] ask in the line of duty, he'll give it
[1:28:31] to you because you're about his
[1:28:32] business, not your own. But then after
[1:28:35] God has given us a direction, amen, and
[1:28:38] has revealed to us his will, then we can
[1:28:40] rest assured that he's going to take
[1:28:42] care of the situation. If God has shown
[1:28:44] you his will, then you can walk in his
[1:28:46] will and know that whatever happens,
[1:28:48] he's got it all in control.
[1:28:50] That's the that's the assurance that we
[1:28:52] have as we walk. And if he's making us
[1:28:55] wait,
[1:28:57] if it's not happening, if if what he's
[1:28:59] promised, if what he showed us is his
[1:29:00] will isn't happening, then our prayer
[1:29:02] has still been answered.
[1:29:05] When he has showed you his will, you
[1:29:07] don't have to pray for the effect of his
[1:29:09] will anymore because his will is what's
[1:29:11] going to happen. And you can say the
[1:29:13] answer's on the way. You can rest in
[1:29:16] those situations. Amen. There'd be no
[1:29:18] point in continuing to pray over a
[1:29:20] situation that God has shown you his
[1:29:21] will for. You don't have to.
[1:29:24] You don't have to do those things. Amen.
[1:29:27] And so then we switch from saying, "God,
[1:29:29] please do. God, please intervene. God,
[1:29:31] please heal. God, please provide." When
[1:29:34] he's shown you his will, then you can
[1:29:35] say, "Lord, give me faith and trust to
[1:29:37] just keep walking forward." And like
[1:29:40] Abraham, what did Abraham do? He said
[1:29:42] that he what? He gave praise and
[1:29:44] thanksgiving and worship because he was
[1:29:46] strong giving thanks unto the Lord.
[1:29:49] He didn't have Isaac yet, but he could
[1:29:51] walk and he could have praise and
[1:29:53] worship because God had shown him what
[1:29:55] his will was going to be. But at the
[1:29:58] same time, God will use prayers as a
[1:30:00] catalyst. Now, a catalyst is something
[1:30:02] that causes something to happen. We look
[1:30:04] at this from a chemical reaction
[1:30:05] standpoint. You can have two things that
[1:30:08] don't do anything, but if you add a
[1:30:09] catalyst to that mixture, it causes
[1:30:11] things to happen. You know, we would see
[1:30:13] this in uh in the science fairs when
[1:30:15] people would do their their volcanoes
[1:30:17] and they'd take I think baking soda and
[1:30:18] vinegar. You put it together, the baking
[1:30:20] soda reacts with the vinegar and it's a
[1:30:22] catalyst and it caused all the things
[1:30:24] all the bubbles and the big messes that
[1:30:25] the children would always make at those
[1:30:27] things. It's a catalyst. It makes things
[1:30:29] happen. And God's I say that because
[1:30:31] prayer is God's way of getting us
[1:30:33] involved in the situation
[1:30:35] and sometimes to drive things to make
[1:30:38] them happen. Amen. God's wanting us to
[1:30:40] be involved in this program. And so God
[1:30:42] is laying things on our hearts. He's
[1:30:44] putting uh an uncction in our hearts to
[1:30:46] get us to create an expectation and a
[1:30:50] desire for the things that he's trying
[1:30:51] to do in in in a place, in a church,
[1:30:54] whatever it might be. Burban would say
[1:30:56] God puts a desire on the people for
[1:30:58] revival before he sends revival so that
[1:31:00] they're expecting revival.
[1:31:03] God doesn't just come and give revival.
[1:31:05] God sends a desire for revival before he
[1:31:07] sends it. That people start to pray
[1:31:09] about that people start to be an
[1:31:10] expectation. Amen. And it's it's to
[1:31:12] create a pull for something that God is
[1:31:14] desiring to do in our lives. And so in
[1:31:17] our prayer lives, we'll get a a strong
[1:31:19] urge or what we call an uncction or a
[1:31:21] desire for God to do something. And
[1:31:23] that's God's way of getting us involved
[1:31:25] by getting us to start calling for and
[1:31:28] looking for something. Why? Because he's
[1:31:30] wanting us to be involved in his will.
[1:31:33] He's wanting us to be involved in his
[1:31:35] program. He's wanting to work in our
[1:31:36] lives. He's wanting to do things for us.
[1:31:38] And he wants us to be asking and
[1:31:40] desiring for the things that he has in
[1:31:42] store for us. Amen. You know, as I
[1:31:44] expect my wife to work with me to
[1:31:46] achieve the things in our life that
[1:31:48] we're supposed to, so God is expecting
[1:31:50] his bride to be in lock step with him.
[1:31:52] He's the head. We're the body. We're his
[1:31:54] hands. We're his feet. We're the ones
[1:31:56] that do the work. He's the one that does
[1:31:57] the leading. And prayer is a way to get
[1:32:00] in the channel of God so that you know
[1:32:01] what he wants to do so you can go do it.
[1:32:04] Amen.
[1:32:07] Brother Bram says this. God is
[1:32:09] interested in everything. He's
[1:32:11] interested in the little things you do
[1:32:13] or the big things you do. He's
[1:32:14] interested in you and he's interested in
[1:32:16] me. But he says, and he's interested to
[1:32:19] see his word made manifest. and he's
[1:32:21] depending on us to do it. He says, "For
[1:32:24] we are his agents, but it's nothing in
[1:32:26] ourselves. It's him yielding ourselves
[1:32:29] and walking with him." Then he said,
[1:32:32] "He's God over creation. He's God over
[1:32:34] all things. And there's nothing too
[1:32:36] little or too insignificant, but what
[1:32:38] he's interested in." He says, "So that
[1:32:41] would give us to know though we may be
[1:32:44] little and insignificant,
[1:32:46] God is interested in doing something for
[1:32:49] in us, doing something for him." Now
[1:32:51] catch this. He says he likes to display
[1:32:54] his glory. Amen. Do you see the point
[1:32:58] there? I put those two quotes one after
[1:33:00] the other to drive one thing. God's
[1:33:02] interested in in displaying himself
[1:33:05] through you and through me. That's what
[1:33:08] God's interested above all else. And
[1:33:09] that's what he's been doing all along.
[1:33:11] That's this great mystery that's been
[1:33:12] hidden from the beginning of time was
[1:33:14] God being revealed through a bride. God
[1:33:17] being revealed through a people that are
[1:33:18] so yielded to him that it would express
[1:33:20] Christ all over again. And so God's
[1:33:22] interested in one major thing and that's
[1:33:24] Christ being expressed through the
[1:33:25] believer. How are you going to get
[1:33:27] there? You got to find the will of God.
[1:33:28] How you going to do that? By prayer.
[1:33:30] That's when our prayers become
[1:33:31] effective. Amen. He's not here to give
[1:33:33] us this dreamy life of ease and pleasure
[1:33:35] and luxury. He's here to give us a
[1:33:37] supernatural expression of God in our
[1:33:39] flesh. That's exactly what he's looking
[1:33:42] for. Amen. So, this is the way that that
[1:33:44] God works. And prayer is certainly one
[1:33:46] way that God gets us involved. But
[1:33:48] there's a right way to pray and there's
[1:33:50] many wrong ways to pray. There's one
[1:33:53] right way and many wrong ways. And we
[1:33:54] can pray wrongly. We know. And it's
[1:33:56] because we have the wrong motives and
[1:33:58] objectives. James would say, "You ask
[1:34:00] and you receive not." You pray, you talk
[1:34:02] to God, you ask for things and you don't
[1:34:04] get it. He says because you ask a misk,
[1:34:06] you ask the wrong thing for the wrong
[1:34:09] reasons. He says that you may consume it
[1:34:12] upon your lust. He says you spend your
[1:34:14] prayer time asking for things that are
[1:34:17] are are a lust in your life.
[1:34:21] Now, that's pretty straight. James was
[1:34:23] pretty rough on the church,
[1:34:26] but it's because he saw people that were
[1:34:28] trying to take what God had intended
[1:34:30] them to do and turn it into a
[1:34:32] selfserving gospel rather than a serving
[1:34:35] gospel.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. They had reversed the intent of
[1:34:38] the gospel, which is go you out. And
[1:34:40] they were talking about bring it in.
[1:34:42] Give it to me. Give me what I want.
[1:34:43] Amen. Selfish prayer for carnal things
[1:34:46] is not what God created prayer for. That
[1:34:49] is not it. Amen. The prosperity gospel
[1:34:51] is completely voided. just by this one
[1:34:53] scripture. You ask what you want and
[1:34:56] you're asking a miss because it's it's
[1:34:57] all based on carnal things that you're
[1:34:59] wanting. Amen. We're supposed to be
[1:35:01] seeking what he promised rather than
[1:35:04] what we want. That's what prayer is
[1:35:07] supposed to do. Amen. Church, I've got
[1:35:08] no problem asking God for things
[1:35:10] relating to this world. I have no
[1:35:13] problem doing it. Amen. I've prayed for
[1:35:14] many things. Listen, I I I share with my
[1:35:17] family that I finally bought a car and I
[1:35:18] g went through the kind of the the the
[1:35:21] criteria I had and I thought about this.
[1:35:22] I thought about this and this and that
[1:35:23] and the other thing and dad said, "Do
[1:35:24] you overthink much?" I said, "It's a
[1:35:27] vehicle. Of course, I overthink."
[1:35:30] And but here's the thing. I said, "Lord,
[1:35:33] I had missed a really good deal out in
[1:35:35] Placentia on a Honda CRV and I was like,
[1:35:38] h everything else was f the same car at
[1:35:41] every dealership was5 to $6,000 more
[1:35:43] plus fees. I was like, "Ah, that would
[1:35:46] that would have been a good one." But in
[1:35:48] the end, that wasn't what I really
[1:35:50] wanted. But I said, 'Lord, can you just
[1:35:53] lead me to the right one because, you
[1:35:54] know, I'm going to just die over this
[1:35:57] because I like vehicles. I and I don't
[1:35:59] want to buy a lemon and I don't want to
[1:36:00] buy a wrong one. I don't want to buy a
[1:36:02] bad one. And, you know, this this
[1:36:04] experience the last year with cars is
[1:36:05] really Lord, just give me something
[1:36:07] that'll be simple and easy to operate,
[1:36:08] you know, in these different things.
[1:36:10] So, I have no problem saying, 'Lord, I'm
[1:36:14] going to keep doing my day stuff. I'm
[1:36:16] going to stay in the channel of being a
[1:36:18] pastor and being a a father and a
[1:36:20] husband. Lord, can you take care of the
[1:36:22] car situation and give me peace about
[1:36:24] the one that you want me to get? And you
[1:36:27] know what? He did. And what I got was
[1:36:30] exactly what I've been looking for. I
[1:36:32] just didn't know that that was what I
[1:36:33] wanted. It wasn't on my radar to start.
[1:36:35] It just wasn't there. But that's the way
[1:36:37] it worked out. I've got no problem
[1:36:38] asking God to provide me with a house, a
[1:36:41] place to live, you know, a a good deal
[1:36:43] on an appliance, whatever that might be.
[1:36:46] But I tend to place those things under
[1:36:47] the fact that I pay my tithes.
[1:36:50] And so God says, "I'll pour out a
[1:36:52] blessing." And so God will take care of
[1:36:54] me financially. That's what tithing is
[1:36:55] for. That's what I take as a as a God
[1:36:58] saying, "I I'll take care of your needs.
[1:36:59] Not your wants, but your needs." But if
[1:37:01] he chooses to bless me, because he said,
[1:37:02] "Listen, try me and I'll pour out more
[1:37:04] of a blessing than you can contain." So
[1:37:06] I just say, 'Lord, if you'd help me, I'd
[1:37:09] sure appreciate it. And he does. I
[1:37:11] believe God loves to give us what we ask
[1:37:13] for. I believe absolutely he does. It's
[1:37:16] not a question of his will or not his
[1:37:18] will. It's a question of do you believe
[1:37:20] enough to ask him for it. Sometimes
[1:37:24] in every aspect of my life, I believe
[1:37:26] that if I ask him, it's of interest to
[1:37:29] him purely on the basis that I asked
[1:37:31] him. If it's important enough to me to
[1:37:34] ask him about, I believe it's important
[1:37:36] enough to him to give me an answer
[1:37:38] about. Not to give it to me, but to give
[1:37:40] me an answer about it. As much as I want
[1:37:42] to involve God, God wants to be
[1:37:44] involved. Amen.
[1:37:47] That's always going to please him. God
[1:37:48] wants a closer relationship. And if I
[1:37:50] involve him with every aspect of my
[1:37:51] life, God's going to say, "Bring it on."
[1:37:54] Listen to this. Remember, brother says,
[1:37:56] he's interested in you. He's interested
[1:37:57] in everything you do. Jesus said, "Are
[1:37:59] not two sparrows sold for a farthing,
[1:38:01] and one of them shall not fall on the
[1:38:03] ground without your father? But the very
[1:38:05] hairs of your head are all numbered."
[1:38:08] What does it have to do with anything?
[1:38:11] Why would God want or need to know about
[1:38:13] the hairs of your head? Jesus said,
[1:38:16] "You're so important that he knows how
[1:38:18] many hairs are on your head." Some of us
[1:38:20] are making it a little easier for him
[1:38:22] than others,
[1:38:23] but he says he knows how many hairs you
[1:38:26] have today.
[1:38:28] That's how much God cares about you. So
[1:38:31] then, does he care about your children,
[1:38:32] church? Does he care about your
[1:38:34] marriage? Does he care about your
[1:38:35] business? Does he care about your
[1:38:36] ministry? Does he care about your hurts?
[1:38:38] Does he care about your sickness?
[1:38:40] Absolutely. If he cares about how much
[1:38:42] hair you have,
[1:38:44] he cares about everything else. He said,
[1:38:46] "Fear you not, therefore, ye are of more
[1:38:49] value than many sparrows."
[1:38:52] Brother says God is interested in
[1:38:54] everything that's wrong. Everything that
[1:38:56] you participate in, he says every walk
[1:38:59] of life, God's interested in you. You
[1:39:01] are his children and he is rich in
[1:39:03] mercy. He wants to do it for you. Now, I
[1:39:07] would say this. Now, this is just me.
[1:39:08] This is thus sayith brother John. I
[1:39:11] don't know that God has a plan for every
[1:39:13] single aspect of your life. And I say
[1:39:17] say this, when I look at scripture, I
[1:39:19] tend to see that there are way points in
[1:39:21] people's lives that are critical. And
[1:39:24] that's where God has hard points in. And
[1:39:25] you cannot miss those points. You have
[1:39:28] to be there. But what happens between
[1:39:30] them seems to be highly variable. And
[1:39:33] brother B would talk about perfect will
[1:39:35] versus permissive will. Perfect will is
[1:39:37] a straight line. Permissive will is all
[1:39:38] over the place. And it's a whole lot
[1:39:40] more fun. And yet it's a whole lot
[1:39:42] harder as well. That's the way it goes.
[1:39:45] So that this is just me. I I don't have
[1:39:47] I didn't look up a quote on it or
[1:39:49] anything like that, but we can see in
[1:39:50] scriptures that God has it seems like
[1:39:52] God has flexibility between the way
[1:39:54] points, but he's going to get you where
[1:39:55] he's going to get you no matter what.
[1:39:57] Amen.
[1:39:59] And so between those, we can ask and God
[1:40:03] will give. We can request and he will
[1:40:06] grant because what happens in between
[1:40:08] those isn't as important as that we get
[1:40:10] to one point to another. And so I see
[1:40:12] that in the scriptures where we can ask
[1:40:14] for things and God will give it because
[1:40:15] it has no real influence on the outcome.
[1:40:18] It just changes the way that we walk
[1:40:20] dayto day or the way we experience life
[1:40:21] in these different things. But when we
[1:40:23] ask God for something, we're asking him
[1:40:25] because we believe that he'll answer.
[1:40:29] We shouldn't go in believing he'll give.
[1:40:31] We should go in believing he'll answer.
[1:40:33] That's what prayer is supposed to do.
[1:40:35] Amen. The key to answer prayer is to
[1:40:37] find his will, not just to ask.
[1:40:41] Just because you ask in prayer doesn't
[1:40:42] mean you're going to get it. That is not
[1:40:44] what the scripture said. And brother
[1:40:45] Brand would teach, he says, God's will
[1:40:46] is bound by his word. So if I'm asking
[1:40:50] something and it is not contrary to his
[1:40:52] word, then I've got a possibility he'll
[1:40:55] answer it. He'll give me what I ask for.
[1:40:57] But if I ask according to his word, then
[1:41:00] I'm going to get what I ask for. Amen.
[1:41:02] That's the way that it's going to work.
[1:41:04] This is what what John would say in
[1:41:06] First John. He says, "This is the
[1:41:07] confidence that we have in him, that if
[1:41:09] we ask anything according to his will,
[1:41:12] he heareth us. And if we know that he
[1:41:15] hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know
[1:41:17] that we have the petitions that we
[1:41:19] desired of him." So if we ask according
[1:41:21] to his will, he hears us. And if he
[1:41:22] hears us, we'll get it. And you can look
[1:41:24] at it this way.
[1:41:27] It's like there's a guard at the at the
[1:41:29] the throne of there's a there's a guard
[1:41:32] before the court of God. if he was a
[1:41:33] king sitting on his throne, he would
[1:41:35] have a guard in front of it. And when
[1:41:37] you come up to the guard, the guard
[1:41:39] knows everything that's in the king's
[1:41:40] will. And so you you say you come up to
[1:41:43] the guard and you say, "Okay, guard, I'm
[1:41:46] I I'm I want to talk to the Lord and
[1:41:48] I'll just use my example and I would
[1:41:50] really really really like a Porsche 911
[1:41:53] Turbo."
[1:41:55] Well, the G the guard looks at his list
[1:41:57] and he says, "Sorry, a Porsche is not on
[1:42:00] God's will for you. go away.
[1:42:03] In other words, we don't even get into
[1:42:04] the presence of God to make that
[1:42:06] petition because it's not according to
[1:42:07] his will. That's the way John's kind of
[1:42:09] talking about here. There's a guard of
[1:42:11] God's will that keeps him from even
[1:42:13] hearing your request.
[1:42:15] He's not going to consider it. He's not
[1:42:17] going to dwell on it. You can't even get
[1:42:19] in there with that. But he says, "Now,
[1:42:21] if you come according to his will, then
[1:42:24] you get in there and he'll actually hear
[1:42:26] you. You'll have a hearing." I don't
[1:42:29] know if you've ever been before a judge.
[1:42:32] You get a hearing before a judge and you
[1:42:34] get to express your need or you get to
[1:42:36] express your side of the story and then
[1:42:38] the judge will make a ruling. He says if
[1:42:40] you come in according to his will then
[1:42:42] you get a hearing. And he says when you
[1:42:44] get a hearing, you're always going to
[1:42:45] get what you ask for cuz God brings you
[1:42:48] in so he can give you what you have need
[1:42:50] of. But you got to come in according to
[1:42:52] his will. And what is it now? You're
[1:42:54] asking him to do what he wanted to do in
[1:42:57] the first place. So now you're in align
[1:42:58] with him and you get it every single
[1:43:00] time.
[1:43:01] That's what the Holy Spirit's meant to
[1:43:03] do in our lives is to bring us to a
[1:43:05] place where we ask according to his will
[1:43:09] and we don't ask until we have found his
[1:43:11] will.
[1:43:13] Amen.
[1:43:15] Because the Holy Spirit is what shapes
[1:43:17] out his will in our life.
[1:43:20] That's why when we go to pray, we can't
[1:43:21] go and pray and ask for what we want. We
[1:43:25] go and say, "Lord, what would your will
[1:43:26] be?" and then let my desire be shaped to
[1:43:29] that. That's when we're going to get
[1:43:30] what we want. Amen. When we do that, now
[1:43:33] it's and you come to that place, then
[1:43:35] now it's not you that's speaking. It's
[1:43:37] the Holy Spirit speaking through you.
[1:43:38] And brother Bam says that's deity
[1:43:39] speaking through the lips of man. We'll
[1:43:41] get into that in our series on dominion
[1:43:43] at some point, Lord willing. But let's
[1:43:45] come back to what we read earlier as we
[1:43:49] start to close this evening.
[1:43:51] This is Jesus saying, "Hitherto have ye
[1:43:53] asked nothing in my name. Ask and you
[1:43:56] shall receive that your joy may be full.
[1:43:59] So listen, our joy is not in carnal
[1:44:02] things. As sons and daughters of God,
[1:44:04] our joy cannot be in carnal things.
[1:44:06] Amen. If so, we'll find out real quick
[1:44:08] that God isn't interested in answering
[1:44:10] our prayers. If what we want is the
[1:44:12] things of this world, things that money
[1:44:13] can buy. It's like I said before, if all
[1:44:15] your prayers are about things that money
[1:44:17] can buy, you're wasting your prayer
[1:44:18] time. Cuz that's all the things of this
[1:44:20] world that he'll add unto you if you
[1:44:22] seek him first. Amen.
[1:44:25] Amen. It's not that we can't enjoy the
[1:44:27] things of this world. Did everyone enjoy
[1:44:30] driving to work in a car that had a
[1:44:33] working heater that the wind wasn't
[1:44:35] rolling through us and you could get to
[1:44:36] church in 15 minutes instead of Can you
[1:44:38] imagine if Brother Matt had to drive a
[1:44:39] horse and buggy all the way here? He'd
[1:44:41] have had to start this morning. We enjoy
[1:44:44] it in the sense that we appreciate what
[1:44:46] it brings to our life. When we go home,
[1:44:49] we don't have a a tent.
[1:44:52] We have nice solid houses that keep the
[1:44:55] the cold out and keep the weather out
[1:44:56] and these different things. We can enjoy
[1:44:58] it, but our joy ought not to be full in
[1:45:01] those things. And Jesus said, "Listen,
[1:45:02] what you're asking for is to make things
[1:45:04] that make your joy full." Amen.
[1:45:09] So, we look at this. Jesus said, what he
[1:45:12] says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[1:45:14] and all those other things will be added
[1:45:15] to you." So, your joy is in the kingdom
[1:45:18] of God. It's not in the things that he
[1:45:19] adds unto you. That's just a bonus.
[1:45:21] That's just something we can appreciate.
[1:45:23] Amen. We, you know, brother Brand will
[1:45:26] say this and we've heard it many times.
[1:45:28] God will give you your heart's desire.
[1:45:30] Have you ever heard somebody say that?
[1:45:31] God will give you your heart's desire.
[1:45:33] But you know what God will give you
[1:45:34] before he gives you your heart's desire?
[1:45:37] He'll give you a new heart and then
[1:45:39] he'll give you a new spirit and then
[1:45:41] he'll put his spirit within you and then
[1:45:42] he'll give you your heart's desire.
[1:45:44] Because with the right heart, with the
[1:45:45] right spirit, you'll ask the right
[1:45:46] thing. That's what he's looking to give
[1:45:47] you. He'll change your condition and
[1:45:49] then he'll give you your desires because
[1:45:51] your desires will be for the right
[1:45:52] things.
[1:45:54] Let me give an example in my life.
[1:45:57] This is something that really happened.
[1:45:58] Uh I it's kind of since I came back to
[1:46:01] Newfoundland. Everywhere I've gone,
[1:46:03] whether it's been whether it's been at
[1:46:05] work or or whatever it's been, I've
[1:46:07] always testified to people. I've always
[1:46:08] found a way to testify to people about
[1:46:10] the things that God's done for me and
[1:46:11] the things that I believe. And I've
[1:46:13] shared some of those testimonies I've
[1:46:14] had down in Texas and Alberta and these
[1:46:16] different things. I've had chances to
[1:46:17] witness to co-workers for hours on end
[1:46:19] driving in vehicles and whatnot and it's
[1:46:21] been amazing many times. Amen. But when
[1:46:23] I came to Newfoundland, that really
[1:46:24] ratcheted it up a bit. And I believe
[1:46:26] it's because God called me to be a
[1:46:28] pastor here. And a pastor is looking to
[1:46:30] bring souls to Christ. But I wanted to
[1:46:33] be a witness. And so I've witnessed to
[1:46:34] to at my mechanic shop. I've witnessed
[1:46:37] at work. I've witnessed in the grocery
[1:46:38] store. We talked to people all over the
[1:46:40] place. And we've had so many
[1:46:41] opportunities to witness to people. But
[1:46:44] the thing that really escalated that was
[1:46:45] when we started praying about it. And it
[1:46:49] wasn't just my wife and I talking about
[1:46:51] it, but it was all of us in our family
[1:46:52] devotions and we were talking about
[1:46:54] things and we were praying, Lord, make
[1:46:57] us a greater witness to our community.
[1:47:00] Lord, make us a greater witness to the
[1:47:01] people we work with. Make us a greater
[1:47:03] witness to those that are at the
[1:47:04] homeschool group. Whatever it might be,
[1:47:06] wherever our sphere of influence is, you
[1:47:08] know, Jonathan going to university,
[1:47:09] Lord, help us to be a witness. help us
[1:47:11] to stand out as an example of Christ in
[1:47:13] this age. And you know what happened? As
[1:47:15] soon as that really started pressing on
[1:47:17] us and we started praying about it, what
[1:47:19] started happening? You're getting more
[1:47:21] and more opportunities to witness. Why?
[1:47:23] Because that's not us making that up.
[1:47:25] That's the Holy Spirit coming in and
[1:47:27] preparing us for the opportunities that
[1:47:29] are going to come our way. And so, we're
[1:47:31] calling for something that God's trying
[1:47:33] to do in our lives and through us. And
[1:47:36] so our prayers made us effective because
[1:47:38] we had found the channel of God's will
[1:47:42] and that brought great joy. Our joy was
[1:47:46] full. I can't tell you how happy we are
[1:47:49] when we sit down and we can say, "Hey, I
[1:47:51] had a chance. You know, Selena comes,
[1:47:52] she says, "Oh, I had the greatest talk
[1:47:54] with a with another rider at my at my
[1:47:56] stable."
[1:47:58] And it's it's a little bit scary in the
[1:48:00] moment, but you just walk away and
[1:48:03] you're like, "How did that happen?"
[1:48:06] And your heart is just bursting because
[1:48:08] you said, "I've shared Christ with
[1:48:11] somebody."
[1:48:12] When I that young man Griffin, when I
[1:48:14] talked to him, you know, we talked to
[1:48:15] him for two hours and by the end it was
[1:48:16] a whole family affair. Jonathan was in
[1:48:18] on it and Blanca was in on it and and
[1:48:20] whatnot and and and even uh it was uh
[1:48:24] who was it that gave us the the cinnamon
[1:48:26] buns? Elsa. Elsa was in on it. She kept
[1:48:28] them there with her cinnamon buns. She
[1:48:29] had made cinnamon buns that day and gave
[1:48:31] them to us and and he ate her cinnamon
[1:48:32] bun. It was a whole body affair. But
[1:48:34] after that, we were just we were so
[1:48:36] excited. We were so happy to see that
[1:48:38] God had done something like that. Our
[1:48:40] joy was full. Why? Because potentially
[1:48:43] that's an eternal event that we just
[1:48:46] experienced.
[1:48:48] We don't know. The Lord knows in the
[1:48:49] end. But there's nothing like sharing
[1:48:52] this gospel with somebody.
[1:48:55] It's better than getting a raise. Better
[1:48:58] than getting a big contract.
[1:49:00] Better than getting a new house, new
[1:49:02] car. When you have the potential to to
[1:49:05] to bring a soul to Christ, that's the
[1:49:07] fullness of joy. And so, when we look at
[1:49:10] our day-to-day lives, see, we can look
[1:49:11] at it. I'll speak to the mothers again.
[1:49:13] You can look at it, well, I'm just at
[1:49:15] home and I'm just trying to teach my
[1:49:16] kids. I'm not doing that very well. I'm
[1:49:18] just trying to keep the house clean. I'm
[1:49:19] not doing that very well. Or maybe you
[1:49:21] are, but that's all I'm doing. No,
[1:49:22] you're not. Your joy is full because
[1:49:24] you're helping to set an atmosphere.
[1:49:26] You're helping to create a place where
[1:49:27] your children can learn about God. That
[1:49:30] they can be in a good atmosphere that
[1:49:32] they can be influenced by a a a person
[1:49:34] that's filled with the Holy Ghost. And
[1:49:36] your joy is full because you're
[1:49:37] fulfilling your kingdom commission.
[1:49:41] Whether it's at home, whether it's the
[1:49:42] brothers at work, wherever that might
[1:49:44] be. Amen. And so what I found is that
[1:49:46] when God puts a burden in your heart for
[1:49:48] others, that's when you really start
[1:49:50] praying
[1:49:52] because we are here to serve. We're not
[1:49:54] here to be self- serving as I said
[1:49:55] earlier. Amen. And so we are
[1:49:57] intercessors for those that cannot come
[1:49:59] into the throne room because they don't
[1:50:01] know his will. They don't know his
[1:50:03] purpose and they can't find it because
[1:50:04] they have nothing to to bring them to
[1:50:06] that place. And so we're there to pull
[1:50:08] those things in. Amen. Jesus said what?
[1:50:11] He said, "Ask that your joy may be
[1:50:12] full." And the question I'm asking you
[1:50:13] tonight is what makes you joyful?
[1:50:16] If I was to say, what makes you joyful
[1:50:18] tonight? What is it that that that
[1:50:20] you're just like, if this would happen,
[1:50:23] I would be complete?
[1:50:25] Amen. Brother Bram says this. He says,
[1:50:28] "Now the Bible wants us to ask for big
[1:50:30] things, not to be satisfied with, Lord,
[1:50:34] I belong to church now. That's enough."
[1:50:39] He says, "No, that's not enough for me.
[1:50:42] I want to get something else.
[1:50:46] Is that what he said? He said, "I want
[1:50:50] to do something else. I've got what I
[1:50:54] need. Now I want to do something with
[1:50:56] it. I want to take what's happened to me
[1:50:58] and turn it into something else. I don't
[1:51:01] want more for me. I want more for
[1:51:03] somebody else." And then see the
[1:51:05] direction he's pointing in. It's not
[1:51:07] Lord, you know, I want a nice car. I
[1:51:09] want a nice house. I want a nice spouse.
[1:51:11] I want a nice bank account. I want great
[1:51:12] health. I want No, he's saying, I want
[1:51:15] more from God than a church experience.
[1:51:18] I want to be engaged in a kingdom
[1:51:20] purpose. I want to do more than just sit
[1:51:23] here and listen to brother John.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:28] Listen to this. This one, this one
[1:51:30] struck me to the core. He said, I'll
[1:51:32] give you my estimation of what I think
[1:51:34] the closest thing to an evidence that a
[1:51:35] man is a Christian than anything I know
[1:51:37] of. He says, you know what it is? It's
[1:51:40] travail of soul.
[1:51:43] He says it's a person that's always so
[1:51:46] hungering and thirsting for God. They
[1:51:49] just simply day and night they just
[1:51:51] can't stand it. They've got to do
[1:51:54] something for God. What a phrase,
[1:51:58] travail of soul. If you take anything
[1:52:00] away from this service tonight, ask
[1:52:02] yourself this question. If I was to say
[1:52:04] what I my my soul is travailing for,
[1:52:07] what would it be tonight? Don't shout
[1:52:08] out your answers.
[1:52:11] But what is it that we've been really
[1:52:13] worked up about?
[1:52:16] See, we can get worked up here and we
[1:52:19] can get worked up here, but in the soul
[1:52:21] that's on the innermost, what is it
[1:52:22] that's travailing?
[1:52:24] In other words, what's really groaning?
[1:52:26] What's really aching? What's really
[1:52:28] calling? Where's the real burden inside
[1:52:30] of our lives? What is the travail of
[1:52:31] soul that we have? Do we have travail of
[1:52:33] soul or are we so involved with all
[1:52:36] these other things that there is no
[1:52:37] travail of soul? There's just worry
[1:52:39] about business and finances and health
[1:52:41] and this and that and the other thing.
[1:52:45] Travail of soul. Amen. When's the last
[1:52:47] time travail of soul overtook our prayer
[1:52:50] life instead of everything else?
[1:52:53] I'm challenging you tonight. I'm
[1:52:55] challenging myself. Amen. When is the
[1:52:58] last time that we got down and we just
[1:53:01] had a burden?
[1:53:03] You know, when I talked to Cherylyn
[1:53:05] Percy, I drove away crying and praying
[1:53:07] as I drove away
[1:53:09] cuz I said, "Lord, that woman is she she
[1:53:13] has no hope without you."
[1:53:18] No hope.
[1:53:21] She is lost in every way unless she can
[1:53:24] come to a realization of Jesus Christ
[1:53:26] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:53:29] And I wept as I cried for her
[1:53:34] cuz there's a soul that's hanging in the
[1:53:35] balance. It's not just a a horrible
[1:53:37] death by in in a lingering way. But it
[1:53:40] is a soul that's sitting there captive
[1:53:42] by a tormentor
[1:53:44] that she could be set free of if she
[1:53:46] could only have faith in the word of
[1:53:48] God.
[1:53:49] That's travail of soul. When we look at
[1:53:52] our young people and we say they need
[1:53:54] the Holy Ghost.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; They need the Holy Ghost more than I
[1:53:58] need a bigger bank account. They need a
[1:54:00] Holy Ghost more than I need a new car.
[1:54:02] They need the Holy Ghost more than
[1:54:03] anything else that we have. If there's
[1:54:05] anything we ought to have travail of
[1:54:07] soul, it's for our young people to get
[1:54:08] the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:10] When's the last time we got down and we
[1:54:12] said, "Lord," and we went name by name
[1:54:14] by name through the young people and
[1:54:15] said, "Lord, fill them with the Holy
[1:54:17] Ghost. Lord, give them a new birth. Let
[1:54:19] them never be the same again.
[1:54:31] When's the last time we couldn't get
[1:54:32] away from a burden for someone else
[1:54:35] rather than ourselves?
[1:54:40] Coming back to our opening scripture,
[1:54:41] James said, "Confess your faults one to
[1:54:43] another. Pray for one another that you
[1:54:45] may be healed." Then he says, "The
[1:54:47] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:54:51] man avaleth much." What kind of a man is
[1:54:54] he talking about? What kind of a person?
[1:54:56] He says it's a righteous man. A
[1:54:58] righteous person. What does it mean to
[1:55:01] be righteous, church? It means to be in
[1:55:04] right standing with God. It means to be
[1:55:08] living in the will of God. Amen. And so
[1:55:12] that's the key to effective prayer is
[1:55:14] that you are a righteous person.
[1:55:18] Amen. Are you seeking the will of God?
[1:55:21] Because Paul says that's the key to
[1:55:23] being an effective prayer warrior is
[1:55:24] that you're seeking and you are in the
[1:55:27] will of God. That's what makes you
[1:55:28] righteous. We take on Christ
[1:55:29] righteousness. It's not by works. I'm
[1:55:31] saying this, but a righteous man is one
[1:55:33] that is more interested in the will of
[1:55:34] God than what people want him or her to
[1:55:36] pray for. Amen.
[1:55:40] It says that the affection the the the
[1:55:41] prayer of that person avails much and
[1:55:44] that word means it prevails. It has
[1:55:46] strength and force. Remember brother
[1:55:48] Bram says prayer is the most effective
[1:55:50] force. Here's your scripture for it. The
[1:55:52] original word says that this this
[1:55:55] person's prayer it embodies strength
[1:55:58] that gets into the battle. In other
[1:56:00] words, this is somebody that really gets
[1:56:03] in there and starts fighting in the
[1:56:04] situation by prayer.
[1:56:08] There's somebody that goes in and gets
[1:56:09] things done,
[1:56:11] that changes situations, that can come
[1:56:14] in and that can intercede and God starts
[1:56:16] to listen. Remember, brother Rab said
[1:56:18] it's the most effective force and
[1:56:19] there's your scripture that places it,
[1:56:21] but it's for a select group of people
[1:56:25] that are committed to one thing and one
[1:56:27] thing alone, the will of God.
[1:56:32] Amen. And they're living in it daily.
[1:56:34] Amen. That's the one you want praying
[1:56:36] for, church, because you'll tell them
[1:56:38] the situation and they'll go and they'll
[1:56:40] find God's will rather than praying the
[1:56:42] way you want them to pray. I've told
[1:56:44] people, I've said this over the pulpit,
[1:56:47] they'll come up for prayer, they tell me
[1:56:48] their prayer, they tell me what what
[1:56:50] they want me to pray for, and I don't
[1:56:52] pray for it. You know why? Because
[1:56:54] that's not what needs to be prayed
[1:56:56] about.
[1:56:59] And I don't explain it except in this
[1:57:00] way to say if the prayer doesn't go the
[1:57:02] way you thought, stop and think about
[1:57:03] what was prayed.
[1:57:05] Amen.
[1:57:09] Remember, Balum was not supposed to be
[1:57:11] for hire. We're not for hire.
[1:57:15] Sister Brenda, you can't come to me and
[1:57:16] say, "Brother John, pray for this." I've
[1:57:19] got to find the will of God before I can
[1:57:21] pray for that. I can pray about the
[1:57:23] situation, but she can't direct me how
[1:57:25] to pray. My wife can't direct me how to
[1:57:28] pray. My children can't direct me how to
[1:57:30] pray. We're not for hire. We are bought
[1:57:32] with a price. We belong to one. Amen.
[1:57:36] These are people that are not for sale.
[1:57:37] They're going to pray for effect, not
[1:57:39] for favor. Remember this story?
[1:57:43] I feel like somebody told it here
[1:57:44] recently, but maybe not. About that
[1:57:46] family that had gotten away from church,
[1:57:50] and this was in the old days, of course.
[1:57:53] And in the middle of the night, someone
[1:57:55] came running up to the preacher's door
[1:57:56] and they pound out, "Preacher, preacher,
[1:57:57] you got to come pray for the Smiths."
[1:57:59] You know, Johnny got bit by a
[1:58:01] rattlesnake. You got to come pray for
[1:58:02] him. It's bad, bad, bad. And the
[1:58:04] preacher went up and they said,
[1:58:06] "Preacher, we're so glad you're here.
[1:58:08] You got to pray for Johnny. He's sick.
[1:58:09] He's going to die." And he and he got
[1:58:11] down and he knelt by Johnny's bed and he
[1:58:13] got everyone to kneel around him and he
[1:58:14] said, "Lord,"
[1:58:16] he said, "Send more and bigger
[1:58:18] rattlesnakes."
[1:58:21] What they needed was not life. what they
[1:58:23] needed was Christ.
[1:58:25] Amen. That's a that's a pastor that
[1:58:27] could pray for the right thing rather
[1:58:29] than pray for what they wanted him to
[1:58:30] do. See, if they got healing, they'd
[1:58:32] just keep walking the way they were
[1:58:33] going. What they needed was to come back
[1:58:35] to the Lord. It's just a story. I don't
[1:58:38] know that it's true or not, but it it
[1:58:39] sets the the the tone for how we pray.
[1:58:41] Amen. And we've got to be able to pray
[1:58:44] and find God's will, not just pray the
[1:58:46] way a be another believer tells us to
[1:58:48] pray.
[1:58:50] But then there's another side of things.
[1:58:51] We get into situations where God's just
[1:58:53] waiting for us to pray. God has already
[1:58:56] said it. God has already declared it.
[1:58:58] God has already said, "This is my will.
[1:59:00] This is what I'm going to do." But
[1:59:01] sometimes he's waiting for us to come to
[1:59:02] him and say, "Lord, I believe it enough
[1:59:04] to tell you I want it."
[1:59:07] And there's an example. You know, you
[1:59:09] think about Isaac and Rebecca and
[1:59:11] remember he was the promised one. And
[1:59:13] God said, "Through him, I'm going to
[1:59:14] bring a nation, a great nation of many
[1:59:16] people." And you think that with Isaac
[1:59:18] and Rebecca, with that promise hanging
[1:59:19] over them, they'd have had kids all
[1:59:21] running around the tent. You'd think,
[1:59:23] right? The promises hanging over them,
[1:59:26] kids ought to be everywhere, we'd say.
[1:59:29] And guess what? Nothing. Watch this. He
[1:59:34] says, "And Isaac was 40 years old when
[1:59:36] he took Rebecca to wife, the daughter of
[1:59:38] Bethl, the Syrian of Pad Padanaram, the
[1:59:41] sister to Laban the Syrian." He said,
[1:59:43] "And Isaac intreated the Lord for his
[1:59:46] wife because she was barren. She's got a
[1:59:49] promise hanging over her that she'll be
[1:59:51] the mother of a great nation and she
[1:59:53] can't have a kid."
[1:59:56] He says, "And the Lord was intreated of
[1:59:58] him." And Rebecca his wife conceived. So
[2:00:02] what did prayer do here, church? It
[2:00:04] moved God into action.
[2:00:07] God was just waiting for Isaac to come
[2:00:09] and say, "All right, God. You promised
[2:00:12] nothing's happening. We need you to move
[2:00:14] on the scene. God had promised it's
[2:00:16] going to happen. But it wasn't
[2:00:18] happening. He was waiting for Isaac to
[2:00:20] say, "Okay, Lord, how about that promise
[2:00:22] about now? Can we not wait until I'm a
[2:00:24] hundred like my dad?" And it says, "The
[2:00:27] Lord was entreated. The Lord heard what
[2:00:29] he did, what he asked for, and God gave
[2:00:31] it to him." Amen. We look in the book of
[2:00:33] Revelation. You look in Revelation 5,
[2:00:35] all the prayers are gathered up and then
[2:00:38] you see in Revelation 8, they come up
[2:00:39] before God and then God does something.
[2:00:42] It's not that God needs prayer to do
[2:00:44] something, but rather that God ties
[2:00:46] himself to our prayers and then they get
[2:00:49] to a point where we ask in faith, it all
[2:00:52] comes together and it's almost like
[2:00:53] there's a rock that's at the top of the
[2:00:55] hill and our prayers slowly move it,
[2:00:56] move it, move it and then it tumbles.
[2:00:59] Where God's wanting us to to to work in
[2:01:01] unity. Amen. Is it's like uh the upper
[2:01:04] room.
[2:01:05] The promise was already given, but the
[2:01:08] people went up into that room in unity
[2:01:10] and they prayed and they waited and they
[2:01:11] prayed and they waited until something
[2:01:13] happened. That's the perseverance of
[2:01:16] prayer that we're looking for. When
[2:01:18] God's promised it, we're going to pray
[2:01:19] until we get it. And we're going to
[2:01:21] trust and we're going to express it.
[2:01:23] Look at the believers in Jerusalem.
[2:01:24] Peter been in prison multiple times
[2:01:26] before, but they never had a prayer
[2:01:27] meeting about it. But then Peter's
[2:01:29] inside and he's got more people guarding
[2:01:32] that jail. I think it was three
[2:01:33] different sets of soldiers if I'm right.
[2:01:35] It might be four. He's in a cell. He's
[2:01:37] he's he's actually uh shackled to two
[2:01:40] guards. Then there's a gate. There's
[2:01:42] another guard there. Then there's
[2:01:43] another gate and guards. And then I
[2:01:44] think there's another one. I think there
[2:01:45] was three layers plus he was shackled to
[2:01:47] two. Impossible situation.
[2:01:52] Like it better to pray when the priest
[2:01:54] had him, right? You got a better chance.
[2:01:57] But he's in there and he's completely
[2:02:00] surrounded. There's no way getting out.
[2:02:01] He's got multiple gates locked and
[2:02:03] guarded to go through. They start
[2:02:05] praying and an angel comes, wakes Peter
[2:02:07] up, walks him right out the front door,
[2:02:10] through every gate, through every door,
[2:02:11] past every guard. They never see him,
[2:02:13] never notice a thing. He comes to the
[2:02:15] door and he knocks on the door. And
[2:02:16] remember, Roa comes up and she opens it.
[2:02:18] She sees Peter freaks out cuz her
[2:02:20] prayer's been answered. And she's like,
[2:02:22] "It's a ghost.
[2:02:24] Peter's ghost is outside. They've
[2:02:26] already killed him, guys. Cuz he was
[2:02:27] supposed to be killed the next day.
[2:02:28] They've already killed him. No, their
[2:02:30] prayers were answered.
[2:02:33] Church, we ought not to be surprised
[2:02:35] when our prayers are answered.
[2:02:37] But what was it? It took the people
[2:02:39] getting together as a catalyst to get
[2:02:42] God moving. When they did, something
[2:02:44] happened. Amen. You know, we've got a
[2:02:47] lot we're praying about these days.
[2:02:50] We've got a lot we're praying about. And
[2:02:51] I'm so thankful for the answered prayers
[2:02:53] that we've had. you know, things that
[2:02:54] have come out in prayer meeting and the
[2:02:56] testimonies that people have shared
[2:02:57] because I want us to be a church that's
[2:02:59] effective in our prayers. I don't want
[2:03:01] us to have a form of praying. I want us
[2:03:04] to be prayer warriors. I want us to be
[2:03:07] effective in the things that we're
[2:03:08] praying about. Amen. And sometimes to be
[2:03:10] effective, church, we've got to make the
[2:03:13] right request.
[2:03:15] Sometimes the problem's not in the
[2:03:16] prayer. The problem's in the person
[2:03:18] asking.
[2:03:20] Remember Hannah?
[2:03:22] Hannah didn't have children. She's
[2:03:23] living with a man and he's got a second
[2:03:26] wife and she's having all the kids and
[2:03:27] Hannah gets nothing and nothing. Hannah
[2:03:29] always goes up every year and she's
[2:03:30] asking God for a kid, asking God for a
[2:03:32] kid. But she wasn't doing it the right
[2:03:34] way. And as soon as she said, "God, I'll
[2:03:36] give them back to you." God gave her
[2:03:37] what she wanted. The request was all
[2:03:39] wrong. You know, sometimes we're asking
[2:03:41] people to pray for something that's
[2:03:42] really not the issue. And sometimes the
[2:03:44] issue isn't our condition or our worry
[2:03:46] or our health or our finances. Sometimes
[2:03:48] the issue is a soul condition. Sometimes
[2:03:51] it's an attitude condition. And instead
[2:03:53] we're asking people to say fix the
[2:03:55] situation
[2:03:56] instead of saying Lord take me through
[2:03:59] you know but I I'll tell you this. I'm
[2:04:02] telling you how we ought to do it. But I
[2:04:05] want to say how thankful I am for the
[2:04:06] prayer requests that have come through.
[2:04:10] And some of you I've talked to you about
[2:04:11] it afterwards and just thanked you
[2:04:12] personally for it. Amen. Because
[2:04:14] sometimes we really have to humble
[2:04:16] ourselves to get to the root of what we
[2:04:19] really need prayer about. And I've been
[2:04:22] so blessed because we've had people that
[2:04:23] have said, "Lord, we we I need help with
[2:04:26] my attitude." Rather than I need help
[2:04:28] with my situation.
[2:04:30] They're not saying, "Lord, change the
[2:04:32] situation." They're saying, "Lord, help
[2:04:33] me go through it with grace." That takes
[2:04:35] real humility
[2:04:37] to say, "This is a struggle of me, not a
[2:04:39] struggle of the situation. Lord, help me
[2:04:42] with those things." Amen. We've had
[2:04:43] people ask, "Lord, help me be better
[2:04:45] around the house. Lord, help us to be
[2:04:46] more productive as a family. Lord, help
[2:04:48] us to get things in line. Help us to do
[2:04:50] this. help us to do that where we're not
[2:04:51] trying to say, "Lord, change the
[2:04:53] situation." We're saying, "Lord, help us
[2:04:54] to be effective in the situation."
[2:04:56] That's the things that God's looking
[2:04:57] for. Amen. I believe God's looking to
[2:04:59] change this more than anything. Amen.
[2:05:03] That the soul would have the victory.
[2:05:04] That our attitude would have the victory
[2:05:06] rather than our natural conditions be
[2:05:08] changed to suit our weaknesses. That's
[2:05:10] not what we ought to be praying for.
[2:05:11] Lord, change the situation so that I can
[2:05:13] go through it the way I am. No, say,
[2:05:15] "Lord, help me to change so I can meet
[2:05:17] the circumstance. keep my head up in the
[2:05:19] midst of these things. Amen. That's what
[2:05:22] I've experienced in my life and I've
[2:05:23] seen it in others. Amen. And I believe
[2:05:25] that's the most effective way in prayer
[2:05:26] meeting is to be honest about what's the
[2:05:28] real struggle because then we can really
[2:05:30] get to pray him for it. An honest
[2:05:32] request will get an honest prayer. I
[2:05:34] believe I want to share two quotes as we
[2:05:37] close and the musicians can come if they
[2:05:38] want. Brother Ram says he wants us to
[2:05:41] ask and believe that our joys may be
[2:05:43] full. He says ask for big things. Don't
[2:05:46] limit your faith to some little mustard
[2:05:48] seed. Get on out there here to some
[2:05:50] other kind of faith and move out in big
[2:05:52] things.
[2:05:55] He says this, "Big things are just as
[2:05:57] easy to receive as little things."
[2:06:03] I think only a prophet can say that
[2:06:04] because we don't feel that way, do we?
[2:06:06] I'm seeing some grins here. I had the
[2:06:08] same response. I'm like, "That's not the
[2:06:11] way I feel about that."
[2:06:14] But he's saying it is no different. He
[2:06:16] says, "You just have to believe. That's
[2:06:18] all." Why do we believe for little
[2:06:20] things?
[2:06:21] Because we believe God can do it.
[2:06:24] So what is it that makes us think God
[2:06:26] can't do the big things?
[2:06:31] I don't know. Dwelling on the wrong
[2:06:33] things, getting in the wrong atmosphere,
[2:06:35] looking at the situation.
[2:06:37] And then let's look at the big things
[2:06:39] God has done. You know, it was funny.
[2:06:41] I'm not I'm not going to share any
[2:06:43] specific details, but brother Garfield
[2:06:44] was sharing a bit more with me about the
[2:06:45] prayer request he made. And the
[2:06:47] interesting thing was the exact thing
[2:06:49] he's praying for, God did the last time
[2:06:51] they needed it.
[2:06:53] So, you know how easy it is to ask when
[2:06:56] God's already done a big thing, we ought
[2:06:57] to be able to say, "Lord, you can do it
[2:06:59] again.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; You can do it again." Our faith ought to
[2:07:01] rise to that. Our faith ought to say,
[2:07:02] "Lord, as you've done it before, I'm
[2:07:04] believing you can do it again." And we
[2:07:06] walk forward in the same faith as last
[2:07:07] time. The faith of his answering last
[2:07:09] time ought to give us faith before he
[2:07:11] answers this time. He says, "And when
[2:07:13] you have faith, you just know exactly
[2:07:14] how to use it and it'll be all right.
[2:07:16] You can put it right to work and it'll
[2:07:18] just be fine." He says, "Could you
[2:07:20] imagine talking about exhausting God's
[2:07:22] love?" He he tells that story about the
[2:07:23] fish that's in the ocean and he says, "I
[2:07:25] better just have a sip because I might
[2:07:26] run out of water." He says, "Can you
[2:07:28] imagine talking about exhausting God's
[2:07:30] love and power and beneficiaries for
[2:07:33] you? He's the inexhaustible fountain of
[2:07:36] life. Whatever you have need of, need
[2:07:39] of,
[2:07:41] ask him and believe it. He provided it
[2:07:44] in the redemptive blessings when he died
[2:07:46] at Calvary and gave a promise to you for
[2:07:49] everything you have need of while you're
[2:07:51] in the journey. He says, "And it's yours
[2:07:53] if you'll ask and believe it." That's
[2:07:56] right. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[2:07:59] together. Amen. Whatever you have need
[2:08:02] of, he says, ask him and believe it.
[2:08:06] Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[2:08:08] Heavenly Father,
[2:08:10] Lord, very simple thought again this
[2:08:12] evening,
[2:08:14] but Lord, I'm thankful for the clarity
[2:08:15] that your word gives in these things,
[2:08:18] Lord, that if we can find your will,
[2:08:21] Lord, and we can align our prayer with
[2:08:23] your will, Lord, we know we'll get
[2:08:24] exactly what we ask for, heavenly
[2:08:26] father. Lord, that's a soul cry, Lord.
[2:08:29] That's something that has to change on
[2:08:31] the inside of us, Lord, where we can lay
[2:08:33] aside our every thought and our ideas
[2:08:34] and our preferences, Lord, and just come
[2:08:37] in and say, "Lord, have your way, Lord.
[2:08:39] That you would just do a perfect work in
[2:08:41] our lives. That Lord, you would take
[2:08:43] these situations, you'd work them for
[2:08:44] our good. Lord, when it seems like we're
[2:08:47] carrying a burden that's not doing
[2:08:48] anything except hurting and and harming
[2:08:51] and and frustrating us, Lord. May we
[2:08:53] see, Lord, like the prophet said, that
[2:08:54] that is bringing us to a place and you
[2:08:56] know just what you're doing, Lord, where
[2:08:59] we'll be able to look back after it's
[2:09:00] all said and done and we can praise you
[2:09:02] for what you did in our lives, heavenly
[2:09:04] father. Lord, help us to raise our heads
[2:09:06] this evening, Lord, that we'd have
[2:09:08] faith, Lord, as we face hard times and
[2:09:10] circumstances,
[2:09:12] Lord, that we'd be able to look to you
[2:09:13] as the changing God, Lord, that brings
[2:09:15] us through these the unchanging God,
[2:09:17] Lord, that brings us through changing
[2:09:18] circumstances.
[2:09:20] Lord, I Lord, you know what we're
[2:09:22] facing. Lord, you know the things that
[2:09:24] have been shared with me, Lord,
[2:09:26] privately that people are praying for.
[2:09:27] You see the things that we've talked
[2:09:29] about publicly. Heavenly Father, Lord, I
[2:09:31] pray that you'd move in those
[2:09:32] situations. Lord, I pray that you give
[2:09:35] us faith, Lord, to believe in big
[2:09:37] things, Lord. that we'd just not stop at
[2:09:39] a time of saying, "I fought and I tried,
[2:09:41] Lord, but that we'd hold on by faith,
[2:09:43] Lord, to the promise of your word, by
[2:09:45] prayer, and say, Lord, we're believing
[2:09:47] and we're going to worship and we're
[2:09:48] going to praise and testify of what you
[2:09:50] promised in our lives, heavenly father.
[2:09:52] Lord, we thank you for what you've done.
[2:09:54] We thank you for answered prayer, Lord.
[2:09:56] How many testimonies have we had in even
[2:09:58] in this little congregation of your
[2:10:00] healing power, of your saving power,
[2:10:01] your providing power, Lord, your Holy
[2:10:04] Ghost filling power, heavenly father.
[2:10:06] Lord. So we pray for each one that's in
[2:10:08] need here tonight. Those that weren't
[2:10:09] able to make it, Lord, we pray a special
[2:10:11] grace to them. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:10:14] those that are sick, Lord, be with them.
[2:10:16] We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[2:10:18] it. Amen.
[2:10:22] In everything give him thanks. 950
[2:10:30] in
[2:10:33] everything.

[2:13:22] everything.

[2:15:54] to help you.
[2:15:58] will bring all your needs to the Lord.
[2:16:06] Hear my prayer, O Lord. Should be the
[2:16:08] same key. 887.
[2:16:12] Hear
[2:16:14] my
[2:16:16] prayer, O Lord.
[2:16:21] From the ends of the earth I cry,
[2:16:29] your peace
[2:16:31] will lead me to
[2:16:35] the rock that is higher than I.
[2:16:41] For you have been my strength in times
[2:16:46] of trouble.
[2:16:48] a tower above
[2:16:52] my eneies.
[2:16:56] And Lord, I will abide with you
[2:17:02] forever
[2:17:05] in the shelter
[2:17:08] of your wings.
[2:17:13] So hear
[2:17:16] my
[2:17:18] prayer, oh Lord.
[2:17:23] From the ends of the earth I cry.
[2:17:30] And your peace
[2:17:32] will lead me to
[2:17:37] the rock that is higher than I.
[2:17:42] For you have been my strength in times
[2:17:48] of trouble,
[2:17:50] a tower above
[2:17:54] my eneies.
[2:17:58] And Lord, I will abide with you
[2:18:03] forever
[2:18:07] in the shelter
[2:18:10] of your wings.
[2:18:13] For you have been my strength in times
[2:18:19] of trouble,
[2:18:21] a tower above
[2:18:25] my eneies.
[2:18:29] And Lord, I will abide with you
[2:18:34] forever
[2:18:38] in the shelter
[2:18:40] of your wings.
[2:18:44] Amen. And we're going to sing that song,
[2:18:46] Forever Answered Prayer, 1168,
[2:18:49] Key of G. Amen. I'm going to ask Brother
[2:18:53] Chad to close in prayer tonight if he
[2:18:55] would. Amen. Remember the needs that
[2:18:56] have been mentioned. Uh remember
[2:18:59] Cherylyn Piery. That's a real burden,
[2:19:01] like I said, on my heart. Has been since
[2:19:02] I heard. But seeing her again and just
[2:19:05] to me some things stood out on her faces
[2:19:07] just as she was talking and that and I
[2:19:09] said, "She's not doing better." That's
[2:19:11] for sure. and just small things maybe,
[2:19:13] but you know, it's only been a couple
[2:19:15] months since I last saw her. So,
[2:19:17] definitely want to remember her in

[2:21:50] for all that's yet to be.
[2:21:57] The trials we may have to face

[2:24:20] You are here
[2:24:25] dwelling within
[2:24:28] our praise.
[2:24:44] Thank you Lord for hearing our prayer.
[2:24:49] for encouraging us to pray, Lord. For
[2:24:52] encouraging that channel, that
[2:24:53] friendship that only you could provide,
[2:24:56] Lord.
[2:24:59] And our human minds will never
[2:25:00] understand why some is lost, some is
[2:25:03] saved. And
[2:25:05] sometimes, Lord, we just take grace for
[2:25:08] granted, Lord.
[2:25:12] Help us, Father God. Help us truly truly
[2:25:16] have that friendship with you, Lord.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; And for the people that are lost, Lord,
[2:25:25] let us be the
[2:25:27] Lord.
[2:25:31] Let us show them the love that they've
[2:25:33] never seen. Lord,
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; what whatever their days are, Lord, let
[2:25:39] it be comfortable for them, Lord.
[2:25:42] There's people you put in front of us,
[2:25:43] Lord, who may be the only bit of love
[2:25:45] they've ever seen, Lord.
[2:25:48] I just pray, I pray with all my heart,
[2:25:51] Lord,
[2:25:55] that that kindness and love shine
[2:25:57] through us all, Lord, that people may
[2:25:59] see that you dwell inside, Lord.
[2:26:03] Thank you for the service tonight, Lord.
[2:26:06] Pray for brother John. Father God, that
[2:26:09] you continue to give him wisdom, Lord.
[2:26:13] Guide his thoughts, Lord. Guide his
[2:26:15] heart, guide his intentions, Lord, and
[2:26:19] anoint him in a way, Lord, that will
[2:26:20] transform this church to be the little
[2:26:23] church that you said will go, Lord, I
[2:26:26] pray for everyone we come in contact
[2:26:28] with, Lord, that they may see you in us,
[2:26:32] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
