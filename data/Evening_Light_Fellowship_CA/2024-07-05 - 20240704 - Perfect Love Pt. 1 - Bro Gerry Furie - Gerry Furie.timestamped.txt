[56:38] it's wonderful to see each one that's
[56:40] here this evening not just from the
[56:41] local congregation but I was going to
[56:44] say we've got people from out west but
[56:45] everything's West from here pretty much
[56:47] so all the way from the west coast of
[56:50] Canada brother Jim duly to the western
[56:53] coast of Newland and into New Brunswick
[56:56] and all these ones and down into Arizona
[56:59] you know each one I'm not going to name
[57:00] names because I'll forget one I know but
[57:02] I just want to welcome each one of you
[57:04] personally here we sure appreciate the
[57:06] fellowship we appreciate the support
[57:09] amen and we're here to have a wonderful
[57:11] time in his presence amen these are our
[57:13] dedication meetings to thank the Lord
[57:15] for this building amen but what matters
[57:18] most is where he dwells day by day and
[57:20] it is not in buildings made of stone and
[57:22] brick and wood but it's in the hearts of
[57:24] souls that are dedicated to him so we're
[57:26] here to just enjoy ourselves and you
[57:29] know I was reading in devotions in John
[57:32] 8 where Jesus said I am the light of the
[57:34] world he that followeth me shall not
[57:37] walk in darkness but shall have the
[57:39] light of life this is the darkest of
[57:43] darkest ages remember when that angel
[57:45] showed the seven Church ages there was
[57:47] no light in that last age and brother
[57:49] Brandon by permission put in that little
[57:51] bit of light to represent you and I
[57:53] that's how dark it is but Christ
[57:55] promised us you'll have the light of
[57:58] life and he would say that you shall
[57:59] know the truth and the truth shall make
[58:02] you free and he said if the son
[58:04] therefore shall make you free you shall
[58:06] be free indeed we've got all sorts of
[58:08] people offering us things these days but
[58:10] he says when I set you free you're truly
[58:12] free now I have no idea what brother
[58:15] Jerry's going to preach this evening but
[58:17] I'm so glad he came this way and brother
[58:19] Jerry's a pastor in in Edmonton Alberta
[58:22] and if you know anything about brother
[58:24] Jerry he only travels to Africa or he
[58:26] stays
[58:28] home but he's here so I think we're the
[58:31] Africa of Canada perhaps but he
[58:33] graciously came out here all the way the
[58:35] last English-speaking Nation you know
[58:37] and then once you cross over they start
[58:39] to speak other languages but I'm so
[58:41] thankful to have him here this evening
[58:43] we want to welcome him we want to
[58:45] welcome the presence of the Lord we want
[58:46] to pull on the gift uh he told me it's
[58:49] going to be something pastoral that's
[58:50] all I know uh we met him at the airport
[58:53] yesterday exchanged pleasantries gave
[58:54] him some food and sent him on his way so
[58:56] I haven't talked to him about anything
[58:58] um he knows nothing about anything in
[59:00] anybody's life here so if he hits you
[59:02] hard today it's the presence of the Lord
[59:04] speaking to hearts and souls and I pray
[59:06] he hits me hard amen I pray that I know
[59:09] without a shadow of doubt that the Holy
[59:11] Spirit has been here to minister to my
[59:13] need this evening amen let's not get
[59:15] offended let's not get hurt let's get
[59:17] encouraged and say Lord It's the light
[59:18] of your life that's coming my way to
[59:21] help me along in this darkness that he
[59:23] that that we're we're walking through
[59:25] these days and when you Set Me Free Lord
[59:27] I'll be truly free then that's what I
[59:29] want I want to be set free by the sun
[59:31] this evening amen I want whatever he'd
[59:33] have for me that would encourage me that
[59:35] would correct me that would direct me
[59:37] that would heal me that would change me
[59:39] more and more into his likeness this
[59:41] evening amen so let's sing that song
[59:43] 12:15 draw me draw me Lord and I'll come
[59:46] running back to you amen and let's just
[59:49] welcome the Lord Jesus Christ into our
[59:51] service this evening as brother Jerry
[59:53] would come I said take your Liberty
[59:56] we're well trained he asked me how long
[59:58] I normally preach I said it varies
[1:00:00] wildly so he's in he's in good company
[1:00:03] tonight however long he would want to go
[1:00:04] he'll take the service tomorrow night as
[1:00:06] well Lord willing but we just want to
[1:00:08] pull on that gift let him know you're

[1:00:13] most of it and let's let the Lord have a
[1:00:15] work in our lives this evening amen God

[1:00:19] [Music]

[1:01:21] draw amen amen God bless you Saints amen
[1:01:26] it's good to be here just want to say
[1:01:28] that I'm thankful brother Jonathan uh
[1:01:30] actually invited me I was kind of
[1:01:32] surprised when he invited me here about
[1:01:34] 3 or four months ago or maybe it was
[1:01:36] January but anyways I said I'll pray
[1:01:38] about it and prayed about it and here I
[1:01:40] am and I just want to say that I thank
[1:01:42] the Lord for what he's done for us in
[1:01:44] this day and age that how he's opened up
[1:01:46] the revealed word to us because without
[1:01:49] Christ in our life we have nothing
[1:01:51] friends and when when brother Jonathan
[1:01:53] uh said that he'll make you a new
[1:01:55] creation
[1:01:56] make you means creation I'm a new
[1:01:59] creation here tonight I'm not just
[1:02:01] passed over but I'm just waiting for my
[1:02:03] body change and I want to go in the
[1:02:05] Rapture do you not friends the thing is
[1:02:07] that we're not here just to play Church
[1:02:09] we're here to actually become the word
[1:02:11] the see the word is based off
[1:02:14] manifestation it's not based on
[1:02:16] discussion it's not based on debate it's
[1:02:19] based on manifestation and we want to
[1:02:22] manifest the word in this day see when
[1:02:25] we actually really know who we are then
[1:02:27] all of a sudden everything else goes
[1:02:28] away we are the word made flesh in this
[1:02:31] day we are the broadc coming of Christ
[1:02:34] amen I want to welcome or I want to say
[1:02:37] to to brother uh Jonathan too and for
[1:02:40] sister Marine that they met us at the
[1:02:42] airport last night and got some goodies
[1:02:44] I sister maren gave us some goodies
[1:02:46] there and it was really nice uh I like
[1:02:48] those things because I like food as you
[1:02:51] probably see amen amen you ready for
[1:02:56] some preaching gu turn to First John
[1:02:59] 4:16 I'll get out of the way and just
[1:03:00] let God have his way because I've been
[1:03:04] praying about these meetings and I've
[1:03:05] been praying about thank you musicians
[1:03:08] I've been praying about these meetings
[1:03:10] I'm just because when you start coming
[1:03:12] down this line of thought and you're
[1:03:14] trying to get the mind of God it's not
[1:03:16] that you don't have uh know what you're
[1:03:18] going to pre or have uh subject to
[1:03:21] preach on it's just what to preach on
[1:03:23] see because the thing is there's so many
[1:03:25] things in the message and so many things
[1:03:27] in the scripture to preach on but you
[1:03:29] have to get to a place where the mind of
[1:03:31] God actually comes on the scene and I
[1:03:33] Pray by God's grace I can have the mind
[1:03:35] of God here tonight and speak something
[1:03:37] to you God bless you brother Dale it's
[1:03:39] good to see you amen uh used to live
[1:03:42] right by us but God bless him he went to
[1:03:45] the other side of the world I was
[1:03:47] talking to a brother from Africa and he
[1:03:49] and I told him I'm going to dedication
[1:03:51] means he said where is that I new land
[1:03:53] he how far it is it away and I said 61
[1:03:55] 100 km he says what country is that
[1:03:59] in I said it's still in Canada amen amen
[1:04:03] let's read from verse 46 here and we
[1:04:06] have known and believe the love of God
[1:04:10] and ha to that God have to us God is Agy
[1:04:15] love now we know there's several
[1:04:17] different meanings to this word love one
[1:04:19] of them is brotherly love and he goes on
[1:04:22] God is love and he that that dwelleth in
[1:04:27] love now it's not just separate from
[1:04:30] love but God is love and the believer or
[1:04:34] the Born Again believer dwelleth in love
[1:04:37] and so he dwelleth in Love Actually
[1:04:40] dwelleth in God so it's not just a in
[1:04:43] and out in and
[1:04:45] out you dwell in the love as a saint of
[1:04:49] God I call it the inner sanctum
[1:04:53] Sanctuary inside not just you come in
[1:04:56] and come out you're in at all the time
[1:04:59] he that dwelleth in go in love and God
[1:05:02] in him and here is our love made perfect
[1:05:06] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:05:10] judgment because as he is so are we in
[1:05:14] this world so just a second here okay
[1:05:19] there it is there is no fear in love but
[1:05:23] perfect love castes out
[1:05:26] fear now fear it can be tormenting but
[1:05:30] perfect love moves in and casts that out
[1:05:34] because fear hath torment he that fearth
[1:05:38] is not made perfect in love let's just
[1:05:42] just have a word of prayer heavenly
[1:05:43] father as Lord Jesus as we look at this
[1:05:47] word tonight father we want you Lord
[1:05:49] Jesus to come on the scene father we
[1:05:51] come Father Here Lord expecting and Lord
[1:05:54] we're going to get what we expect and
[1:05:57] father we want more of you Lord Jesus
[1:05:59] than we've ever had before father I just
[1:06:01] want to yield myself get myself out of
[1:06:03] the way let you Lord take over granted I
[1:06:06] pray I ask in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:08] amen you may have your
[1:06:10] seats So speaking on this and looking at
[1:06:13] some of these things and love is not
[1:06:16] something that you just project but
[1:06:19] actually the believer of this day and
[1:06:21] age because you know the everything that
[1:06:22] was in the bridegroom is in the bride in
[1:06:25] the last days we not just project love
[1:06:27] we are love because God is love so if
[1:06:30] you're in God you're actually dwelling
[1:06:32] in love so we got to understand is that
[1:06:35] love is actually you here tonight as a
[1:06:38] as a Believer love is actually you here
[1:06:40] as a Believer and I want to get these
[1:06:43] point at across to you because to
[1:06:44] understand it's about it's about perfect
[1:06:47] love not perfect Doctrine perfect
[1:06:49] love because every because we can
[1:06:51] emphasize many things in this message we
[1:06:54] emphasize things that we like we
[1:06:55] emphasize Doctrine we emphasize maybe
[1:06:57] you know gifts we emphasize this we we
[1:06:59] can emphasize a lot of things in this in
[1:07:01] this message because we can pull our
[1:07:03] quotes out the quotes that we actually
[1:07:05] like but if we don't have perfect love
[1:07:07] it doesn't do you no good see it's not
[1:07:10] about having the perfect Doctrine
[1:07:11] because you can have perfect Doctrine
[1:07:13] and not have perfect love you can have
[1:07:15] an understanding and you know of
[1:07:17] knowledge and Mysteries and we'll get
[1:07:18] into that tonight but I just want you to
[1:07:20] understand see fear is not cast out by
[1:07:23] death fear is cast out by perfect love
[1:07:27] see we can and I'm not talking about
[1:07:28] just natural fear when you you know you
[1:07:30] might be scared of spiders or scared of
[1:07:32] snakes and stuff like that and you have
[1:07:33] fear of that but I'm talking about
[1:07:35] tormenting fear fear that actually
[1:07:37] torments you you come to church and
[1:07:39] you're tormented by by things that that
[1:07:41] you may be gone through and it's just
[1:07:43] tormenting and the fear is not just cast
[1:07:45] out by just putting on your message
[1:07:47] uniform and coming to church and sitting
[1:07:49] there and say I'm a message believer see
[1:07:51] it's not about just believing something
[1:07:53] it's actually about having C having
[1:07:55] perfect love and cast out that fear see
[1:07:58] the only way fear is cast out is by
[1:08:01] perfect love he realized when job lost
[1:08:04] everything the Bible says and he says
[1:08:06] what I feared Came Upon me so it was
[1:08:08] actually something that was actually
[1:08:10] became a part of him he dwell on those
[1:08:12] things and they actually he feared those
[1:08:15] things and they came upon him it's just
[1:08:17] like Peter when when Jesus talked about
[1:08:19] you know or the scripture talks about
[1:08:21] when he got out of the boat and walked
[1:08:22] on water see he lost substance after he
[1:08:25] begin to sink something actually took a
[1:08:28] hold of him and he feared now brother
[1:08:30] bam tells us the thing is is that what
[1:08:33] the church can't move on without getting
[1:08:36] rid of this fear and he says the
[1:08:38] greatest curse I'm going might get into
[1:08:40] it tonight but the greatest curse to the
[1:08:42] church is that reason why they can't
[1:08:44] operate is because they fear you say
[1:08:46] well I I I don't fear I believe the word
[1:08:49] see it's not about just believing the
[1:08:51] word it's just it's about casting out
[1:08:54] fear through perfect love see because
[1:08:56] fear can't enter in if you have perfect
[1:08:59] love it cannot actually trespass into
[1:09:03] perfect love if you have you know if you
[1:09:05] have perfect love so to have the
[1:09:08] understanding it's actually a mature
[1:09:10] love now you know the realm that we're
[1:09:13] talking about here is a realm that you
[1:09:15] cannot get by just coming to church and
[1:09:18] hearing the word it's not just by
[1:09:21] something that you can just believe on
[1:09:23] it it's something out of this world
[1:09:26] because we all have human love we got a
[1:09:29] certain standard of human love but when
[1:09:31] we're talking about perfect love we're
[1:09:33] talking about God's love it's something
[1:09:35] that is you know because you're sitting
[1:09:37] here tonight because you've been
[1:09:39] influenced by something something
[1:09:41] actually took place in your life that
[1:09:43] you influenced you and Drew you close to
[1:09:45] the word see but the thing is is that
[1:09:47] this type of love that I'm speaking of
[1:09:49] comes in different degrees see it's just
[1:09:52] like if you if you type it naturally and
[1:09:54] you type it to the spiritual side see
[1:09:56] friends the thing is is that when you're
[1:09:58] born again and birth in the word you
[1:10:01] have baby love you begin to start out in
[1:10:03] the spiritual walk and then you move up
[1:10:06] maybe to adolescence or Teenage Love and
[1:10:08] then you come to an adult love and what
[1:10:11] is it it's a mature grownup love it's a
[1:10:15] love that friends the thing is is that
[1:10:17] it matures you it has gives you
[1:10:20] understanding it gives you knowledge our
[1:10:22] problem is and and I'll tell you what
[1:10:24] you know brother brother R say and we'll
[1:10:26] get into this but our problem is we
[1:10:28] don't trust enough we don't have
[1:10:30] confidence enough in the word you say I
[1:10:32] believe the word I believe the word all
[1:10:34] those things but understand this how
[1:10:36] much trust or confidence do we actually
[1:10:39] have in the word we say I got all the
[1:10:41] confidence until something
[1:10:43] happens something happens in your life
[1:10:45] and all of a sudden you start to try to
[1:10:47] sort out you try to put things together
[1:10:50] work your problems out and and still we
[1:10:53] have the testimony I believe the word
[1:10:56] and we have and I thing is Jesus says oh
[1:10:58] oh ye of little faith and what is he
[1:11:01] saying you have little trust so what we
[1:11:04] have to understand here is that the
[1:11:06] emphasis that we should have an
[1:11:09] understanding this because before we can
[1:11:11] have a body change you have to have
[1:11:13] mature love you have to have this
[1:11:15] perfect love I love a grown up type of
[1:11:18] Love here's what brother Bram says and
[1:11:20] I'll and and we'll quote this a couple
[1:11:23] times here but to understand is that he
[1:11:25] this is after he went uh into the sixth
[1:11:29] Dimension and uh and he came back and he
[1:11:32] and he begin to say what it was like
[1:11:34] over there he says that he says thus
[1:11:37] sayith the Lord he said it will take
[1:11:39] perfect love to put you in that place he
[1:11:42] said for that's all there was there no
[1:11:44] matter how many how much religious
[1:11:48] demonstrations message
[1:11:51] uniforms hey friends I'm a Holiness
[1:11:53] preacher don't get me wrong
[1:11:55] I believe that but you can have all that
[1:11:57] and not have perfect love you can be
[1:11:59] bitter and be dressed right and you can
[1:12:02] even have quotes and speak right and
[1:12:05] have scripture right but if you don't
[1:12:07] have perfect love you're not going to go
[1:12:08] anywhere he says he says no matter how
[1:12:11] much religious demonstrations how many
[1:12:13] Good Deeds you done or whatever You'
[1:12:15] done that won't count nothing on that
[1:12:18] day it'll take perfect love so whatever
[1:12:20] you do whatever you do you lay a beside
[1:12:26] everything else and I know we know this
[1:12:28] quote off by heart but I just want to
[1:12:30] get us on the same page here until you
[1:12:32] are so filled with the love of God till
[1:12:35] you can love those who hate
[1:12:38] you now we're a church body here
[1:12:43] right can you love everybody on this
[1:12:49] degree come on
[1:12:51] friends we we we we say we're message
[1:12:53] Believers like told brother Jonathan
[1:12:56] it's going to be pastorial
[1:12:58] here because it's going to go get down
[1:13:00] to the nitty-gritty where we're actually
[1:13:02] at we can sing the nice songs great
[1:13:05] wonderful we can praise the Lord raise
[1:13:07] our hands and all the stuff but we can't
[1:13:09] stand our brother next to
[1:13:12] us you can't go in without perfect love
[1:13:16] I don't care how much perfect Doctrine
[1:13:18] you have you can't go in on perfect love
[1:13:21] now watch again in first John and we'll
[1:13:23] go over the scripture here just just to
[1:13:25] understand this herein is our love made
[1:13:28] perfect now friends the thing is we know
[1:13:31] these words and the words were actually
[1:13:33] you know a translat from Greek from
[1:13:35] Hebrew into English King James version
[1:13:38] that we read right it was it was
[1:13:40] translated in 1611 but the thing is it's
[1:13:43] not about catching the letter it's
[1:13:45] actually about catching the spirit of it
[1:13:49] what God is trying to convey to the
[1:13:51] church what God is trying to tell us
[1:13:53] here because the English language is
[1:13:56] quite descriptive or is not as
[1:13:58] descriptive as other languages right now
[1:14:02] some of you might know different
[1:14:03] languages here I don't know where you're
[1:14:04] from some of you probably from Africa if
[1:14:07] you're from east side of Africa bana aab
[1:14:10] bur means God bless you and Swahili
[1:14:12] that's about as much African I know but
[1:14:15] I understand this is that the thing is
[1:14:17] is you know the languages that we take
[1:14:19] we we take a word but it doesn't really
[1:14:21] give the context to it see but we want
[1:14:24] to understand the context to it because
[1:14:27] now when the word is used perfect verse
[1:14:30] 17 and verse 18 they have two different
[1:14:34] means see because the same word but has
[1:14:38] different means so hear in is our love
[1:14:41] made perfect which means finished
[1:14:44] fulfilled to make perfect to complete to
[1:14:47] carry through completely add what is yet
[1:14:50] wanting in order to render a thing full
[1:14:52] so it's got to be a full perfect love a
[1:14:57] fullness not just your third Doctrine
[1:15:00] understanding not just the
[1:15:03] Mysteries let me we'll get into
[1:15:05] something here friends watch here it is
[1:15:08] our love made perfect he said that we
[1:15:11] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:15:15] your your life your the the the dwth of
[1:15:18] perfect love that you have you will have
[1:15:20] boldness on the day of judgment why you
[1:15:23] have the same love as Jesus Christ
[1:15:26] not a different love the same actual
[1:15:29] love that he has when he was hanging on
[1:15:31] the cross when he was being crucified
[1:15:33] and he said forgive them for they know
[1:15:36] no what they do that type of love he had
[1:15:40] perfect love and remember friends Jesus
[1:15:42] was just as flesh as you and I were he
[1:15:44] was virgin born but friends the thing is
[1:15:46] is that he died as a man he had emotions
[1:15:49] in tied into him he had all things tied
[1:15:52] into him even though he's virgin born
[1:15:54] but friends the thing he felt the same
[1:15:56] way you
[1:15:57] felt so have boldness in the day of
[1:15:59] judgment because as he is so are we in
[1:16:04] this world
[1:16:06] now not in the future not the not not in
[1:16:09] the you know not in the future home not
[1:16:12] in the Millennium right now as he is so
[1:16:16] are we where are we in the scale like I
[1:16:18] said teenage love baby love adult love
[1:16:23] we can actually look on a scale of our
[1:16:25] lives and see where we're actually love
[1:16:27] now in verse 18 He says there is no fear
[1:16:30] in love but perfect same English word
[1:16:34] but look at the word perfect in this one
[1:16:36] it says man of full age it's grown up
[1:16:39] it's adult not baby form not teen form
[1:16:44] not adolesence form but a grownup form
[1:16:47] brought to its end finished wanting
[1:16:50] nothing necessary to completeness full
[1:16:52] grown adult full age mature
[1:16:55] so John is actually writing this in a
[1:16:58] degree of different you know degrees of
[1:17:02] love and he finishes up with a adult
[1:17:05] love a grownup love so not a baby love
[1:17:08] not a teenageer but a full mature love
[1:17:11] so let's look at this a little bit so
[1:17:13] you know which where I'm going here he
[1:17:15] said there is no fear in love but
[1:17:18] perfect love casteth out out fear same
[1:17:24] word you used for casting out
[1:17:28] Devils so we need to be cast out of our
[1:17:32] fear amen we need to be cast because it
[1:17:35] says cast out to throw or let go of a
[1:17:37] thing without caring where it falls in
[1:17:39] other words perfect love has an
[1:17:42] aggressive attribute it casts out fear
[1:17:46] it doesn't play around with it it
[1:17:49] doesn't think about it it just takes it
[1:17:51] and throws it out it don't care where it
[1:17:53] lands see because because it's your
[1:17:55] enemy is fear is not your friend in any
[1:18:00] way shape or form that's why brother
[1:18:02] Bram can say the things he said he said
[1:18:05] the church won't move on it's because
[1:18:07] they have fear now listen now perfect
[1:18:10] love friends when we look at perfect
[1:18:11] love we think well you know I'm just
[1:18:13] going to be right in because I believe
[1:18:15] this message but friends the thing is
[1:18:17] there's got to be an out perfect love in
[1:18:19] you before we get out of
[1:18:21] here because we talk about rapturing
[1:18:24] faith
[1:18:25] but that we have an understanding what
[1:18:26] rapturing faith actually involves see
[1:18:28] because perfect love actually gets rid
[1:18:30] of fear so it casts us out so we got to
[1:18:33] get to a place where we have an
[1:18:35] understanding of what we need to do
[1:18:37] because the word has been the message
[1:18:39] has been here for many many years 60
[1:18:41] some years but how come we still don't
[1:18:45] understand what fear actually does to us
[1:18:47] is because we don't understand perfect
[1:18:49] love to understand where we need to get
[1:18:52] to we got to understand what love is God
[1:18:54] is love we need to be taught
[1:18:57] love you got human love that's not I'm
[1:19:00] talking about we're talking about the
[1:19:01] God's love so this fear is opposite of
[1:19:04] perfect Faith or perfect love so this
[1:19:07] perfect love cast out fear so this fear
[1:19:09] don't want nothing nothing to do with it
[1:19:12] I don't want nothing to do with fear I
[1:19:13] want fear in my life he says where there
[1:19:16] is there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:19:19] love cast fear because fear hath torment
[1:19:24] perfect love doesn't have
[1:19:26] it if you're tormented here right here
[1:19:30] tonight it's because you fear something
[1:19:33] you fear something I fear I'm going to
[1:19:35] miss the Rapture I'm fear I'm going to
[1:19:37] have a not have a B I fear this I fear
[1:19:40] that I Fe some people even fear coming
[1:19:42] to
[1:19:43] church because what the preacher is
[1:19:45] going to preach but they don't
[1:19:48] understand that's why you don't have to
[1:19:50] understand what love is God will always
[1:19:52] reach out to you and show you what these
[1:19:54] things are because perfect love does not
[1:19:57] have torment love is Cap love is only
[1:20:01] capable of growing and growing in God's
[1:20:04] love see it's the same Principle as
[1:20:06] Faith understanding trust with many of
[1:20:09] the Divine Natures of God see friends
[1:20:11] it's having trust in God having
[1:20:14] confidence in God now God is the essence
[1:20:16] of perfection there's nothing more
[1:20:18] perfect than God
[1:20:21] himself now can I say this to you so you
[1:20:24] you can grasp this you realize you're
[1:20:27] the second coming of Jesus
[1:20:29] Christ you realize friends the thing is
[1:20:32] you are the very
[1:20:34] Rapture and what God does with his
[1:20:36] church with his bride he shows you
[1:20:39] something so you can grow into it he
[1:20:42] doesn't waste his time there's nothing
[1:20:44] more perfect than God God's it God is
[1:20:47] love that's why he will take time and
[1:20:50] he'll bring you to imp Perfection that's
[1:20:52] why he's involved in our lives
[1:20:54] see he doesn't separate himself from you
[1:20:57] see it's not just about your testimony
[1:20:59] but he'll show you how show you how you
[1:21:01] should grow see what it is for as he you
[1:21:04] know brother bam talks it starts out
[1:21:05] with a small button let me just say it
[1:21:08] this way God's you know brother man
[1:21:09] explains he said love is like a is a big
[1:21:12] ocean and it goes down to a river then
[1:21:14] it goes down to a creek then it goes
[1:21:16] down to a stream and then it goes even
[1:21:17] to a capful so if you had an experience
[1:21:20] with God friends the thing is there was
[1:21:22] God's love reaching out to you and it
[1:21:24] might want any capful but it grows from
[1:21:27] there it might grow from a to a creek or
[1:21:29] to a stream or to a river or you know I
[1:21:32] I don't think I'll ever get to an ocean
[1:21:33] but I'm still a part of God so I have
[1:21:35] the love of God see but the problem is
[1:21:37] we don't have trust and confidence in
[1:21:40] his word we say we do until something
[1:21:43] happens all of a sudden something
[1:21:45] happens your spouse dies your brother
[1:21:47] dies your sister dies your child dies
[1:21:50] and all of a sudden things happen in
[1:21:52] your life and what it does it just
[1:21:54] destroy you put you flat in your back
[1:21:56] what is it God's trying to prove to us
[1:21:58] we need to trust and have confidence in
[1:22:00] him see that's why people they whine and
[1:22:03] complain they murmur they come to church
[1:22:06] it's too cold it's too warm it's on this
[1:22:08] and on what is it because they're still
[1:22:10] in baby
[1:22:12] form I believe I believe that the bride
[1:22:15] of Christ are going to fulfill the
[1:22:17] scripture of a body change I don't
[1:22:20] believe they're going to be murmuring
[1:22:21] complaining I don't believe they're
[1:22:23] going to have any fear in them I do
[1:22:25] believe they're going to have perfect
[1:22:26] love see because the thing is a baby
[1:22:28] they'll stop their feet when they don't
[1:22:30] get their way when they don't get their
[1:22:31] way in
[1:22:32] church everybody with
[1:22:35] me see what it is and God might you
[1:22:38] might be I've been there for years and
[1:22:39] years years but God might rebuke you
[1:22:42] because it's been a long time because
[1:22:44] you got little faith you got little love
[1:22:47] you got little trust and you got a
[1:22:48] little confidence in his word yeah I
[1:22:51] need to grow up how do you grow up
[1:22:53] brother Jerry consecrate your life
[1:22:56] more consecrate your life more to the
[1:22:59] things of God see because it comes in
[1:23:01] various degrees if we could take your
[1:23:04] life and put it up here on a chart what
[1:23:06] would it look like what would it be what
[1:23:08] what would it be would it be up and down
[1:23:11] I love this time but I hate the next
[1:23:13] time that's just filial
[1:23:15] love you know the thing is that little
[1:23:18] faith or little trust little coment be
[1:23:20] God wants to achieve this perfect love
[1:23:22] in us he already has it because he is
[1:23:26] love but he wants to achieve it into his
[1:23:29] church into his bride he wants to
[1:23:31] achieve these things our problem is that
[1:23:33] we compare one another we compare to one
[1:23:35] another we compare ourselves how's this
[1:23:38] brother doing how's this sister doing
[1:23:39] you realize the Bible says don't do that
[1:23:43] don't compare yourselves to one another
[1:23:45] see be what God Made You see friends the
[1:23:48] thing is I'm not your example brother
[1:23:50] Jonathan's not your example see one
[1:23:52] another is not your example Christ is
[1:23:55] our example that's who we depend on our
[1:23:58] desire is to be what God wants for us to
[1:24:00] be you know when brother bam gave us
[1:24:01] description of the different Apostles
[1:24:03] they had different attributes to them
[1:24:05] you have Andrew who was a prayer War he
[1:24:07] had Peter that was you know a man of
[1:24:09] Faith you know so to speak but John here
[1:24:11] he has a real understanding of what love
[1:24:13] is and and and it went so deep and you
[1:24:17] know if you looked at the other
[1:24:18] disciples you would look like they're
[1:24:19] not even Christians but John had a
[1:24:22] deepness of love and understanding what
[1:24:24] was actually about and the thing is that
[1:24:26] you look at look at the different
[1:24:28] disciples and different ones but even
[1:24:30] today when you look at yourselves
[1:24:32] there's certain attributes in us that
[1:24:34] we're strong in but there's certain
[1:24:36] attributes that we're not strong in I
[1:24:39] want to be strong in the love of
[1:24:41] God because I know friends the thing is
[1:24:43] is that God will equip us and be content
[1:24:47] to one another as a body Believers here
[1:24:50] we're a church see compliment one
[1:24:53] another you know not you know just not
[1:24:56] talking against each other not just
[1:24:58] putting other each other down and not
[1:25:00] being jealous where there's Strife
[1:25:02] strife and jealousy will not excel in in
[1:25:04] the kingdom of God only love for one
[1:25:07] another I'm talking about this perfect
[1:25:09] love see it's god-given see I you know
[1:25:12] friends the thing is I didn't give it
[1:25:14] you didn't give it God Alone can only
[1:25:16] give it this what brother Bram
[1:25:19] says perfect love castes out fear the
[1:25:24] reason you're fearful is because the
[1:25:27] right Temperance of love has never
[1:25:29] entered
[1:25:31] yet you've never entered in to that
[1:25:34] right Temperance of
[1:25:36] Love see the right Temperance of love
[1:25:38] has never entered it so this is the key
[1:25:41] to me we can say we love the Lord and
[1:25:45] yet we're so
[1:25:47] fearful about so many
[1:25:50] things and the reason why that is is
[1:25:52] because we don't have the right temp of
[1:25:55] love and you try to replace it maybe you
[1:25:58] say well I'm going to believe a certain
[1:25:59] doctor maybe you're going to listen to
[1:26:01] more tapes and and read more books
[1:26:04] nothing wrong with any of that but the
[1:26:06] thing is that still doesn't give you the
[1:26:08] right amount of temperance you might
[1:26:10] even have the right theology you might
[1:26:12] have the right understanding of the
[1:26:14] third pole but we're talking about
[1:26:16] perfect
[1:26:17] love not perfect
[1:26:20] Doctrine you might be a theologian here
[1:26:22] tonight I don't know I I've been serving
[1:26:24] the lord for 40 years now I've read the
[1:26:27] message over and over I've read the
[1:26:28] church ages you know thoughtfully over
[1:26:31] over in easily 20 times I study this
[1:26:36] message but that does not give me
[1:26:38] perfect love see the thing is is that
[1:26:41] there's nothing like it you know you
[1:26:43] know you may come to church and somebody
[1:26:45] might do something against you how do
[1:26:47] you react how are you to one another see
[1:26:50] because that's why people they can sit
[1:26:52] under a great ministry a third pole
[1:26:54] Ministry a Ministry that so so move you
[1:26:58] and you still might not have the right
[1:26:59] Temperance of love can you shake a
[1:27:01] Brother's hand can you say God bless you
[1:27:05] Sister you can't do that this this what
[1:27:07] is that you don't have the right right
[1:27:09] right Temperance of Love see what it is
[1:27:12] friends we need to enter a place that
[1:27:14] where he dwell and then only dwells in
[1:27:18] perfect
[1:27:19] love see because friends we got to be
[1:27:22] willing to do these things that's why
[1:27:24] people go in the prayer closet and feel
[1:27:26] religious over
[1:27:28] it I said my prayers today okay
[1:27:33] Catholics I know there are some
[1:27:35] Catholics here I was raised a Catholic
[1:27:38] too we said our prayers but I wanted to
[1:27:41] know what time the hockey game was on
[1:27:43] after I had the rosary down pat I know
[1:27:47] we would have pray me means at my my
[1:27:50] home when I grew up it was 6 minutes to
[1:27:52] 8 and the hockey game started at 8:00 I
[1:27:54] knew the rosary took 7
[1:27:56] minutes I knew that but people can go in
[1:27:59] their prayer closet they can have all
[1:28:01] kinds of you know outward things that
[1:28:04] happen all those things but never change
[1:28:06] in that place of perfect love where
[1:28:08] actually dwell and they'll feel
[1:28:10] religious but God isn't hard up he's not
[1:28:13] going to compromise on his word in the
[1:28:15] end
[1:28:16] time he demands perfect love because he
[1:28:21] is love I want to be like God I want to
[1:28:25] be because friend Hugh said there's
[1:28:26] going to be a bride in the last days
[1:28:28] everything that happens to the
[1:28:29] bridegroom is going to happen to the
[1:28:31] bride she's going to have perfect love
[1:28:33] just like Jesus Christ said he doesn't
[1:28:36] want quality I mean quantity he wants
[1:28:39] quality so people think that they can
[1:28:41] get away with everything just by
[1:28:42] believing the message it's more than
[1:28:44] that friends it comes in degrees it
[1:28:47] grows in you now watch this we go over
[1:28:50] this real quick here he said wherefore
[1:28:52] if God so close the grass of the field
[1:28:56] which today is and tomorrow is cast in
[1:28:59] the oven shall he not not much more
[1:29:01] clothe you o e of little faith OE of
[1:29:05] little trust that's what that means I
[1:29:08] don't have the confidence I got to do it
[1:29:09] myself so they so they move away from
[1:29:13] church and go somewhere there's no
[1:29:15] church nothing to feed their soul what
[1:29:19] is it they have little faith they
[1:29:21] trusting is so small see this so it's
[1:29:24] not just believing it's trusting Jesus
[1:29:27] never said Do you believe me they
[1:29:28] believed them you have to believe you
[1:29:31] have to have trust in him confidence in
[1:29:34] his word what he's actually giving you
[1:29:35] see it's saying you don't trust me so
[1:29:38] he's talking about us he's telling the
[1:29:40] church you don't really trust me so
[1:29:42] therefore if God so clothe the grass of
[1:29:44] the field which is today is tomorrow is
[1:29:46] casting into the oven shall he not much
[1:29:49] more clothe you so God asks us trust me
[1:29:55] have confidence in me watch this this is
[1:29:58] Peter of course he said
[1:30:01] immediately and immediately Jesus
[1:30:04] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[1:30:07] and said unto him oh thou of trusting
[1:30:12] little faith trusting he trust him a
[1:30:15] little only trust God a little wherefor
[1:30:18] didst thou doubt now Peter's been with
[1:30:21] Jesus for a while here for three years
[1:30:24] and Jesus saying you have little trust
[1:30:26] in me you have little confidence in me
[1:30:28] goes on again when Jesus heard he Marvel
[1:30:31] and said unto them he Marvin said unto
[1:30:34] them that F that follow verily I say
[1:30:36] unto you I have not found so great a
[1:30:38] faith which means large abundant intense
[1:30:43] so what is what's what I'm showing here
[1:30:44] it's growing it grows in
[1:30:46] degrees it grows and gets larger and
[1:30:49] larger you might have started out with a
[1:30:51] little faith but I you might believe God
[1:30:53] more than you've ever believed him now
[1:30:55] friends I've been serving the lord I
[1:30:56] believe God more than I've ever believed
[1:30:58] him now before I have trusted him more I
[1:31:01] have confence it more see because it's
[1:31:04] not so only so far it's all the way the
[1:31:07] full we all believe the fullness of the
[1:31:09] word came back in this
[1:31:10] day right we can show you the man oh God
[1:31:14] sent a prophet fullness of the word came
[1:31:16] back but it's the fullness of the word
[1:31:18] on display on your life where you have
[1:31:20] trust in him friends the thing is that
[1:31:23] if you have trust trust in him you will
[1:31:25] have full Victory if you have confidence
[1:31:28] in the word you will have full you will
[1:31:29] have victory in your life but it's our
[1:31:31] trust Factor see people just stay in the
[1:31:34] status quo come to church be a message
[1:31:36] believer hear the quotes go home get in
[1:31:38] the regular life that's status quo
[1:31:41] there's a lot of message people like
[1:31:43] that but understand this friend God
[1:31:45] wants us to grow up farther than that he
[1:31:48] doesn't want us just to be a church
[1:31:50] goers he doesn't want us just be church
[1:31:53] members he doesn't want us just to be
[1:31:55] message Believers he wants to grow up in
[1:31:58] US amen he said that Jesus answered said
[1:32:02] un unto her a oh woman great is thy
[1:32:05] faith he said be it unto thee even thou
[1:32:09] Wilt and her daughter was made whole
[1:32:11] from that very hour so it comes in
[1:32:13] degrees so the love can come the same
[1:32:16] degree now watch and he turned to the
[1:32:20] woman and said unto Simon seest thou
[1:32:23] this woman I entered in thy house thou
[1:32:25] gavest me no water for my feet but
[1:32:28] sheath washed my feet with tears and
[1:32:30] wiped them with the hairs of the head
[1:32:32] thou gavest me no kiss but this woman
[1:32:34] since the time I came in hath not ceased
[1:32:36] to kiss my feet my head with oil thou
[1:32:40] did not anoint but this woman haveth no
[1:32:43] anointed my feet with ointment wherefore
[1:32:45] I said unto thee her sins which are many
[1:32:48] are forgiven for she loveth much but to
[1:32:52] whom little is for given the same loveth
[1:32:56] little now who are these people that
[1:32:58] Jesus is talking about they're
[1:33:01] Pharisees we all know that but they're
[1:33:04] Prophet quoting
[1:33:09] people they could quote Moses inside out
[1:33:13] but what do they miss the word made
[1:33:16] flesh that's what they miss we can miss
[1:33:19] the same thing we' be proph quing people
[1:33:22] and Jesus can walking in here right and
[1:33:24] sit right by us but missed the whole
[1:33:26] picture of it see understand this is
[1:33:28] that this is why they were looking at
[1:33:30] themselves I'm a pretty good guy I go to
[1:33:33] church I don't drink I don't steal I
[1:33:35] don't lie they thought they were pretty
[1:33:38] good this woman didn't think she was
[1:33:40] good she knew something had to be
[1:33:42] changed in her life she knew God how to
[1:33:44] get in in her life see because
[1:33:46] understand this see a person that thinks
[1:33:48] they're a pretty good person will never
[1:33:50] love
[1:33:52] much legalization legalization can only
[1:33:56] go so far you can legalize yourself to
[1:33:59] death but it can only go so far your
[1:34:02] self-righteous becomes greater than the
[1:34:03] love of God and that's what I don't want
[1:34:06] I don't want my self-righteous to become
[1:34:07] greater than the word of God I want the
[1:34:09] love of God to come out of my life see
[1:34:12] because the thing is I'm a person that
[1:34:14] was born lost I needed to be saved I
[1:34:17] wasn't a good guy I know that I know I
[1:34:20] God had an influence my I know God had
[1:34:23] to come down and do something in my life
[1:34:24] I know that so it went beyond my
[1:34:27] self-righteous I needed God and until
[1:34:31] you know you truly truly need him and go
[1:34:35] beyond your self-righteousness I dress
[1:34:37] right I have the message uniform I come
[1:34:39] to church I hear the word but what about
[1:34:42] the love of God what about the per
[1:34:45] perfect love of God because the thing is
[1:34:47] is that we need to understand God is
[1:34:50] full of Mercy he still delivers
[1:34:55] amen he still delivers you look at this
[1:34:57] woman see what is she doing she's
[1:34:59] actually recognizing what she
[1:35:03] needed
[1:35:05] friends a Believer who can
[1:35:08] experience God's love toward you can
[1:35:12] actually understand the love of God and
[1:35:14] you can grow in that see he can go
[1:35:17] beyond just John
[1:35:19] 3:16 and go beyond just believing that
[1:35:22] God said a prophet
[1:35:24] it can go beyond that because what it's
[1:35:26] happened is that you can actually enter
[1:35:28] into a place where God is in the inner
[1:35:31] sanct but some people friends just like
[1:35:34] coming to church and hearing the quotes
[1:35:36] I want
[1:35:38] more I want more I don't know about you
[1:35:41] but I want more than that see I want to
[1:35:44] Ender in that place where friends it's
[1:35:46] just him and me see because naturally
[1:35:49] you can do good things and the thing is
[1:35:51] that you you can be a good person person
[1:35:53] sitting here tonight you might never
[1:35:55] smoke you might never swore you might
[1:35:56] never drink but if you don't know you
[1:35:58] need more of God then you're in a bad
[1:36:01] shape I need more God see I need more
[1:36:05] than just this
[1:36:07] friendship I just don't have a
[1:36:08] friendship love with him it's an Earnest
[1:36:11] it's a love for him a deep Earnest that
[1:36:14] I need more of him that friends the
[1:36:16] think is I'm just not come to church
[1:36:17] just to you know see other people I'm
[1:36:20] coming to church to for him to feed me
[1:36:22] to tell me some something that I
[1:36:24] actually need that's why love can
[1:36:26] actually go and and and the perfect love
[1:36:28] of God can actually do something in my
[1:36:30] heart where I can love my brother more
[1:36:33] than
[1:36:35] anything back to that quote again thus
[1:36:38] sayeth the Lord it'll take perfect love
[1:36:41] to put you in that place for that's all
[1:36:43] there was there no matter how many how
[1:36:47] much religious demonstrations how many
[1:36:50] Good Deeds you've done whatever you've
[1:36:53] done
[1:36:54] he said thou won't count for nothing on
[1:36:56] that day it'll take perfect love so what
[1:36:59] whatever you do you lay aside everything
[1:37:03] else until you are just so filled with
[1:37:07] the love of God till you can love those
[1:37:10] who hate
[1:37:11] you now these are dedication meetings
[1:37:14] right the true character of any church
[1:37:17] is the
[1:37:19] people
[1:37:20] right so Paul here
[1:37:24] in Corinthians he cast catches the
[1:37:26] inspiration of the Holy Ghost and he
[1:37:29] catches from the Divine Fountain of the
[1:37:32] Divine love and remember friends when
[1:37:35] Paul went to the
[1:37:37] Corinthians see they were people that
[1:37:40] were Harlot from the Harlot system you
[1:37:43] know all kinds of sexual sins all kinds
[1:37:45] of garbage in them Paul didn't even want
[1:37:47] to go to Corinthian but the Holy Ghost
[1:37:50] told him I have seed down there see but
[1:37:53] you know friends the thing is Paul's
[1:37:55] going to write to the Church of Corinth
[1:37:58] and the church has a lot of problems in
[1:38:00] the Corinth see they have good points
[1:38:02] but they also have good bad points their
[1:38:05] bad points they ran each other down they
[1:38:08] gossip about each
[1:38:09] other they had the Christian spot in
[1:38:12] church but they go back to their homes
[1:38:14] and they ran each other down read the
[1:38:16] read read what brother B talks about
[1:38:18] when about the Corinthian Church and he
[1:38:20] said they had
[1:38:21] gifts but gifts never helped them in
[1:38:24] their perfect love
[1:38:26] issues they had issues in the
[1:38:29] church now friends I've been pastoring
[1:38:32] for 20 years now and I know churches and
[1:38:35] you're still human here tonight I don't
[1:38:38] see angel wings I don't see Halos over
[1:38:39] you I don't see that if you got a Halo
[1:38:42] on you God bless
[1:38:44] you but remember friends there's things
[1:38:47] that happen in
[1:38:49] churches and friends the thing is people
[1:38:51] can act so holy
[1:38:54] but I'm just trying to tell you when
[1:38:56] Paul begin to write to the Corinthian
[1:38:58] Church because they had Miracles they
[1:39:00] had signs they had tongues they had
[1:39:02] wonders they had all those things and
[1:39:04] Paul's inspired to bring the view of
[1:39:07] what perfect love
[1:39:10] is so we can all sit here we can say how
[1:39:13] spiritual we are how grown up we are but
[1:39:16] watch what Paul writes about let's re
[1:39:19] look at this Expos Exposition he said
[1:39:22] though I speak with the tong of men and
[1:39:24] angels and have not which is the same
[1:39:26] word John uses about goel
[1:39:29] love and I have not God's
[1:39:32] love charity I am become as a sounding
[1:39:36] brass or a tinkling
[1:39:38] symbol now let me ask you something Have
[1:39:42] you ever talked in angels tongues have
[1:39:44] you ever heard Angel's tongues besides
[1:39:46] on tape brother Braham my my wife has
[1:39:50] but she would never say that's that that
[1:39:52] that that's the love of God in her room
[1:39:55] one night praying for one of her boys
[1:39:58] God came down this the way way brother
[1:40:00] bam displays it and begins to speak
[1:40:02] through her and she's speaking in
[1:40:04] another tongue that she doesn't even
[1:40:06] know and the thing is but after that she
[1:40:08] would never say I have the perfect love
[1:40:10] of God because it was the years ago
[1:40:13] thank God that God got a hold of their
[1:40:15] lives but understand this is that Paul
[1:40:17] is stress addressing to the church
[1:40:20] according to their needs see because the
[1:40:24] real because people were saying well we
[1:40:26] got the gifts we're more spiritual we're
[1:40:27] done speak with tongues of men all these
[1:40:29] different things and and it fall among
[1:40:31] and would actually happened to them but
[1:40:33] Paul's trying to tell them you're
[1:40:36] nothing remember they're a poor City
[1:40:39] they got heartest coming they got all
[1:40:40] the different all kinds of different
[1:40:42] languages coming into the through
[1:40:43] through them and the thing is very
[1:40:45] Supernatural they see tongues of angels
[1:40:47] they got tongues of man they got all
[1:40:48] these things happening and Paul's
[1:40:50] telling them you know we would look at
[1:40:52] this and say this person is a spiritual
[1:40:54] spiritual person will we
[1:40:58] not but Paul's saying no they're not
[1:41:01] what's he trying to show us what
[1:41:03] actually the true love of God is because
[1:41:05] the thing is is that what the thing is
[1:41:07] that they we got to check our emphasis
[1:41:09] what their emphasis was was the gifts in
[1:41:10] that day but what's our emphasis now our
[1:41:13] emphasis is not the gifts but our
[1:41:15] emphasis is how deep we actually
[1:41:17] are and we think that is going to get us
[1:41:20] in the Rapture but that's not the
[1:41:22] requirement
[1:41:24] it's not the requirement brother Bram
[1:41:27] never said
[1:41:28] that the Bible doesn't say
[1:41:31] that but the thing is people can be so
[1:41:33] spiritual and can't even talk to their
[1:41:36] brothers they can't even love their
[1:41:38] brother can't love their sister properly
[1:41:41] and the thing is we think we're so
[1:41:43] spiritual but imagine there's the these
[1:41:45] gifts going on and Paul comes along see
[1:41:48] you become nothing but a sounding brass
[1:41:50] or a tickling symbol see what is a
[1:41:53] symbol a symbol is just an instrument in
[1:41:55] a in a band or drum set and the thing is
[1:41:58] that it makes all kinds of sound they
[1:42:00] say the symbol is really hard to make I
[1:42:02] don't know much about it but I looked it
[1:42:03] up real quick here but it has to give a
[1:42:06] certain
[1:42:07] sound see but symbols can't say
[1:42:10] words symbols can just beat
[1:42:15] on and sometimes that's the way we are
[1:42:18] talk this quote talk that quote talk
[1:42:20] this quote but when something comes
[1:42:22] against us
[1:42:24] something comes against us we
[1:42:27] change see because friends the thing is
[1:42:30] many of us need to have trained of what
[1:42:33] the spirit of God is saying to
[1:42:35] us because he who has an
[1:42:38] ear and a spiritual ear that actually
[1:42:41] hears what the spirit is saying is a
[1:42:45] blessing that's not saying well you
[1:42:47] heard the quotes you hear the grammar
[1:42:49] you hear all those things that's not
[1:42:50] what it's say friends it's actually
[1:42:52] having an
[1:42:53] understanding of what the spirit of God
[1:42:55] is trying to say to us so Paul's here
[1:42:58] he's telling them that's not perfect
[1:42:59] love and you go down to verse two and
[1:43:02] said though I have the gift of
[1:43:05] Prophecy now we know balum prophesied
[1:43:08] right and we know cus prophesied C
[1:43:12] keesus actually called for called forth
[1:43:14] the death of Jesus and Paul saying
[1:43:17] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[1:43:19] understand all
[1:43:20] Mysteries now we all believe all the
[1:43:22] Mysteries been revealed have we not but
[1:43:25] does that make you have perfect love not
[1:43:28] according to what Paul said here you
[1:43:30] going understand all the ministry you
[1:43:32] can understand all third pole you can
[1:43:34] understand this you can understand Seven
[1:43:35] Seals Church eight you can understand
[1:43:37] all those things but if you don't have
[1:43:38] the perfect love of God you have
[1:43:40] nothing remember I just read you that
[1:43:43] quote we believe that's a Vindicated
[1:43:44] Prophet don't we not put all things
[1:43:48] aside put all things aside so here all I
[1:43:52] understand all men iies so we can stick
[1:43:55] out our chest and say how spiritual we
[1:43:57] are rattle off this and rattle off that
[1:43:59] and rattle off this and know this and
[1:44:01] understand this and understand this s
[1:44:03] and Paul says if you don't have charity
[1:44:05] or you don't have perfect love if you
[1:44:07] don't have that gopel of love you're
[1:44:09] absolutely
[1:44:10] nothing I know this is
[1:44:13] simple that word Mysteries hidden things
[1:44:17] Secrets only given to the initiate not
[1:44:19] ordinary Mortals hidden purpose or a
[1:44:21] secret will miss refer to the Deep
[1:44:24] counsel of God through the secrets but
[1:44:25] now reveal with Supernatural wisdom to
[1:44:28] understand all secrets of God so you can
[1:44:32] be endowed with all the mysteries of God
[1:44:34] here
[1:44:35] tonight but you can't stand people
[1:44:38] something
[1:44:39] wrong it's where we put the emphasis on
[1:44:41] our
[1:44:42] life because the thing is people just
[1:44:45] rattle things off but the thing is is
[1:44:48] that they don't they don't have what God
[1:44:51] requires because we think God requires
[1:44:53] certain things but I just read you the
[1:44:55] quote it's perfect love that's what he
[1:44:57] requires that's why friends the thing is
[1:44:59] when I speak about these things you know
[1:45:02] understand all
[1:45:03] Mysteries a man could be one of the best
[1:45:06] preachers in the
[1:45:07] message and I've met people of course
[1:45:10] things go on behind closed doors I know
[1:45:12] about preachers I know tons about
[1:45:15] preachers some preachers are so bitter
[1:45:19] against other preachers so bitter
[1:45:21] against people and I'm how does that
[1:45:23] match and these people can preach they
[1:45:26] can preach like you've never heard
[1:45:28] anybody else and they stand up here not
[1:45:30] here but Stand Up In a Pulpit and you
[1:45:32] say wow they know their stuff but behind
[1:45:35] the scenes they hate people they can't
[1:45:37] stand people and the thing is they can
[1:45:39] solve everybody's problem in the message
[1:45:41] if you're just giving them M if I go
[1:45:43] through this P I'll solve all the
[1:45:45] problems friends the thing is that
[1:45:46] they're full of
[1:45:48] themselves that's why preacher can focus
[1:45:51] on these things and go down certain
[1:45:52] Avenues but be so bitter and we think
[1:45:55] it's so trival if a preacher comes in
[1:45:57] and it's so
[1:45:58] surface but I say does that person have
[1:46:01] perfect
[1:46:02] love to love people remember brother
[1:46:06] Braham loved people remember I want the
[1:46:09] same spirit that was in that
[1:46:11] man because the thing is they said he'd
[1:46:13] walk up and down the streets and nobody
[1:46:15] would know who his enemy
[1:46:16] was because he treated everybody the
[1:46:19] same I want to be that type of person
[1:46:22] don't you
[1:46:24] I might hate brother Bob's guts but
[1:46:25] he'll never know it I'm just
[1:46:29] kidding amen I can pick on him but we
[1:46:33] can get so deep and so besides ourselves
[1:46:37] so and and we know all things but
[1:46:40] understand this understand all Mysteries
[1:46:42] all Mysteries and and and all and
[1:46:45] understand all Mysteries and all
[1:46:47] knowledge so these are the deeper things
[1:46:49] of God we understand the Mysteries but
[1:46:51] guess what friends the thing is God
[1:46:53] might show you those things but he can
[1:46:55] show you those things without you have
[1:46:56] perfect love it's amazing to
[1:46:59] me imagine a person can prophesy person
[1:47:02] speak in tongues a person that knows the
[1:47:04] Mysteries a person that knows prophets
[1:47:06] all these different things all the
[1:47:08] knowledge and Spell bound the people and
[1:47:10] still don't have Godly love and though I
[1:47:13] have all
[1:47:14] Faith so that I could remove mountains I
[1:47:17] have not charity copy I'm nothing
[1:47:23] because most people think of Charity
[1:47:25] soup suppers good will coffee to the
[1:47:29] homeless feeding the poor donations to
[1:47:32] Charities nothing wrong with any of that
[1:47:35] but you can do that without perfect love
[1:47:37] you can do that without God's love see
[1:47:39] because when Paul's talking about he's
[1:47:41] talking about the manifestation of the
[1:47:43] word in a person's
[1:47:45] heart coming out from a person see
[1:47:49] because like I said the word is based on
[1:47:52] manifestation it's not based on what we
[1:47:55] know it's got to manifest the love of
[1:47:59] God in the bride remember brother Bon
[1:48:01] says the world is starving for
[1:48:04] love he said there will be nobody like
[1:48:07] the Bride of Jesus Christ they'll
[1:48:09] actually have the love of God see I met
[1:48:12] so-called spiritual people they might
[1:48:14] have some gift of uh of discerning so
[1:48:19] somewhat and they'll discern prophesy
[1:48:21] all these different things but they get
[1:48:23] to a place where there's
[1:48:25] something and the thing is that friends
[1:48:27] the thing is people they get jealous of
[1:48:29] one another they look down at one
[1:48:32] another and the thing is they're not
[1:48:34] even in Christ because they love to
[1:48:37] emphasize how spiritual they are how
[1:48:40] wonderful they are how great they are if
[1:48:43] you're that type of person friends you
[1:48:45] you need to get out of your baby stage
[1:48:47] and grow up a little bit see we love to
[1:48:50] emphasize certain parts of the word
[1:48:52] certain quotes certain doctrines certain
[1:48:56] scriptures because much of it goes with
[1:48:58] their
[1:49:00] makeup a person that's not emotional
[1:49:03] they like the scripture be still and
[1:49:04] know I'm
[1:49:05] God they love those then the other one
[1:49:08] is about raise your hands give him a
[1:49:10] hand clap
[1:49:11] Rejoice we pick our quotes because it's
[1:49:14] according to our makeup I'm not an
[1:49:17] emotional person so they pick the ones
[1:49:19] that are un emotional then the ones that
[1:49:20] are emotional pick up the emotional
[1:49:21] quotes which quotes are right both are
[1:49:25] right but we do those things because we
[1:49:28] think that's
[1:49:30] spiritual but friends the thing is if
[1:49:32] you don't have perfect love then you
[1:49:33] have nothing let me just say it this way
[1:49:35] if you don't have perfect love to
[1:49:37] towards your
[1:49:40] wife oh we should have a marry seminar
[1:49:44] here is if you don't have perfect love
[1:49:47] towards your wife you don't have perfect
[1:49:48] love towards your husband there's a
[1:49:50] problem
[1:49:52] listen friends husbands love your wives
[1:49:56] as Christ loved the church he doesn't
[1:49:58] say that the other way around he says
[1:50:01] there only one way don't be bitter
[1:50:03] against them you know why they're the
[1:50:04] weaker
[1:50:06] vessel amen oh we can really pound on
[1:50:09] our wives sometimes with our words just
[1:50:12] Yap away and away because you know
[1:50:14] but friends the thing is they're a
[1:50:15] weaker vessel in
[1:50:17] us so maybe you got signs maybe you got
[1:50:20] prophets I'll get off that see you look
[1:50:22] at the cian Church they were actually
[1:50:24] mean to one
[1:50:26] another read brother brother BR said
[1:50:29] they're actually mean they were actually
[1:50:30] uncaring to one another but they they
[1:50:32] thought they were spiritual they thought
[1:50:34] they knew things they're arrogant
[1:50:36] they're indifferent so Paul how to speak
[1:50:39] them on a level of perfect love though I
[1:50:42] have the gift of Prophecy though I
[1:50:44] understand all mystery all the knowledge
[1:50:46] and though I have all Faith so that I
[1:50:49] could remove mountain and not and have
[1:50:51] not charity I am am nothing charity
[1:50:54] means Love In
[1:50:58] Action we might love certain
[1:51:01] things but love is
[1:51:04] action not simply emotion it's the heart
[1:51:08] reaching out to
[1:51:10] others out to who even the Lost not
[1:51:14] everybody who accept it he goes on in
[1:51:17] verse three he said and though I bestow
[1:51:20] all my goods to feed the poor you think
[1:51:22] that person would have some perfect love
[1:51:24] here remember perfect love cast out all
[1:51:29] fear so though I bestow all my
[1:51:33] goods now
[1:51:35] friends if you just give things away
[1:51:38] that you're going to throw out anyways
[1:51:39] it's not much of a
[1:51:41] sacrifice right we do that oh let this
[1:51:45] person have it I'm going to throw it out
[1:51:46] anyways well it's not much of a
[1:51:48] sacrifice we're talking about sacrific
[1:51:50] here see people do things for Honor
[1:51:54] and why do they do forarm to think that
[1:51:56] they're a great person that other people
[1:51:57] look at them and think they're a great
[1:52:00] person okay church I know we're
[1:52:02] spiritual here I I understand I maybe
[1:52:04] somebody's streaming here that needs
[1:52:08] this I know you don't need it I I I know
[1:52:11] that but understand this people are
[1:52:15] looking for rewards if you know other
[1:52:18] people are going to give you a reward
[1:52:19] you already got your reward as Jesus
[1:52:21] said Remember the the Pharisees the
[1:52:23] publicans he said they already got the
[1:52:26] reward he said though I so Goods to feed
[1:52:28] the poor though I give my body to be
[1:52:30] burned what's amazing about this
[1:52:32] scripture is that this is before the
[1:52:34] burning of
[1:52:35] bodies there was no burning at this time
[1:52:38] it was narrow that brought in burning
[1:52:39] bodies and then bringing people to the
[1:52:41] gift but he said even if I give myself
[1:52:44] they don't have to come and even give
[1:52:46] get you even if I give myself and you
[1:52:49] don't have perfect love friends there's
[1:52:51] the thing is is that it's not a
[1:52:53] sacrifice that's why self- sacrifice can
[1:52:56] still be
[1:52:58] self-centered
[1:53:00] self-sacrifice can be
[1:53:02] self-centered because what you realize
[1:53:05] people can conso themselves by doing
[1:53:08] things for others what's the motive
[1:53:11] what's the reason why people do things
[1:53:12] for others is because they can be
[1:53:14] honored they can be worshiped what's the
[1:53:17] motive what's the objective see because
[1:53:19] the thing is a heart filled with the
[1:53:21] love of God goes beyond human compassion
[1:53:24] nothing wrong with human compassion but
[1:53:26] that's not perfect love that's not what
[1:53:28] Paul's speaking about here because it
[1:53:30] comes from the Divine love which goes
[1:53:32] beyond feeling sorry for
[1:53:34] people I've said to people in our church
[1:53:38] I feel bad because I feel sorry for
[1:53:40] people and I might be getting in a way
[1:53:42] of God's plan by doing something for
[1:53:45] that person that God doesn't want me to
[1:53:47] I'm just being honest here I bestow all
[1:53:50] my goods to feed the poor though I give
[1:53:52] my my body to be burned I have not
[1:53:54] charity it proth me nothing so
[1:53:59] zero doesn't profit me nothing so
[1:54:03] understand this friends you can give
[1:54:05] yourself give to the poor give yourself
[1:54:07] to the stake to be burned you can do all
[1:54:09] those different things but at the white
[1:54:11] Throne judgment you're going to come up
[1:54:13] in the resurrection and God says I have
[1:54:15] not recorded because I didn't lead you
[1:54:17] to do that this this is this is
[1:54:20] different than human compassion
[1:54:23] this is different than your Humanity
[1:54:24] because you can't get it from your
[1:54:26] Humanity because they do all kinds of
[1:54:28] Charity things in the world they do all
[1:54:30] those type of things but friends the
[1:54:32] thing is it's got to be recorded on
[1:54:34] God's God's God's records it's got to be
[1:54:36] recorded on his book but he's going to
[1:54:38] say depart from me workers of iniquity I
[1:54:40] did not know you because I didn't lead
[1:54:42] you to do those things this is why we
[1:54:45] got to be led by the Holy Ghost not led
[1:54:48] by a church led by the Holy Ghost
[1:54:51] because what people do they do things
[1:54:53] because they want to be recognized see
[1:54:55] if you getting led to the stake or give
[1:54:57] yourself to the stake people wanted to
[1:54:59] be on the book of Martyrs I don't
[1:55:01] know I don't know what the mor objective
[1:55:03] people see so you can give and you can
[1:55:05] do with a Divine love it means nothing
[1:55:08] to God remember the Widow that gave
[1:55:10] money or might in the in the synagogue
[1:55:12] and these other publicans come in and
[1:55:14] they give all kinds of
[1:55:16] money but God had it so it be written in
[1:55:20] his word so it be reminded to us for
[1:55:22] thousands of years that this woman cuz
[1:55:25] she sacrificed everything she got but
[1:55:29] these other ones they had all kinds of
[1:55:30] money oh I give so much I give so much
[1:55:33] friends the thing is that if it's not
[1:55:35] divinely LED God don't recognize those
[1:55:37] things that's why we got to understand
[1:55:39] it's got to become from the soul God
[1:55:42] don't even look at it if it doesn't come
[1:55:44] from the soul it's God's love it's his
[1:55:47] perfect love so understand this is that
[1:55:50] sacri self- sacrifice can be self
[1:55:52] centered so if a person is still getting
[1:55:54] something out of it see it's not God
[1:55:57] asking you it's not
[1:55:59] recorded now I'm going to step on some
[1:56:01] toes here not really but now for a
[1:56:06] preacher it's not what you can do for
[1:56:09] God and how many meetings you can
[1:56:11] hold or how often you can preach or
[1:56:14] where you can travel to because
[1:56:16] preachers think that's the way it is but
[1:56:19] if it's not God L it doesn't mean
[1:56:21] nothing
[1:56:23] if it's not his
[1:56:25] will and I you know friends I I've been
[1:56:29] around this message for for quite a few
[1:56:30] years and seen a lot of things see
[1:56:33] people will preach so many times you
[1:56:36] know in a in a year time and think
[1:56:38] they'll go here go there go nothing
[1:56:40] wrong with that if it's God L but
[1:56:42] they're just doing it to get their name
[1:56:44] out
[1:56:45] there God doesn't recognize it I'm a big
[1:56:48] name in the preacher I'm what is it
[1:56:50] friend is what is it doing is that there
[1:56:52] they they're trying to you know use what
[1:56:56] God's Gift gave to them for their own
[1:56:59] for their own
[1:57:00] means and we're not supposed to do that
[1:57:03] I want to be a blessing I want to be in
[1:57:05] his will I want to be in his will here
[1:57:07] tonight and the thing is that what what
[1:57:09] am I what are people trying to prove
[1:57:11] what preacher trying to prove they
[1:57:12] actually are trying to prove their
[1:57:15] vanity preachers are vain
[1:57:17] too absolutely because it's the way we
[1:57:21] think
[1:57:22] more is better so Paul goes a little
[1:57:26] deeper what the charity is Charity
[1:57:29] suffer
[1:57:31] long you realize a Corinthian Church
[1:57:34] they had little tolerance for one
[1:57:36] another they couldn't stand in you read
[1:57:38] read the book of Corinthians and read
[1:57:39] what brother R says about them see God
[1:57:41] wants to see his as reflected in love or
[1:57:44] reflected in
[1:57:46] charity charity suffer
[1:57:49] long so it was necess NE for them to
[1:57:54] understand what the love of God
[1:57:56] was there was a lot of contention going
[1:57:58] on in the Corinthian Church at this time
[1:58:01] so Paul brings this in because there was
[1:58:03] jealousy in the church there was Envy in
[1:58:05] the church there was complaining in the
[1:58:07] church there was muring in the
[1:58:10] church but suffereth long slowness to
[1:58:14] anger p and passion patience oppos to
[1:58:17] haste it Den notes the state of mind
[1:58:19] which can bear long when one is provoked
[1:58:21] a accommodated by someone who seeks to
[1:58:24] injure us you realize this isn't this
[1:58:28] isn't for a natural
[1:58:31] man a natural man doesn't think this way
[1:58:35] every one of us has a spot where our
[1:58:38] human love will run out we will stop
[1:58:41] forbearing for one another we will stop
[1:58:43] enduring for one another
[1:58:45] longsuffering people come along push
[1:58:47] your
[1:58:49] buttons in church
[1:58:52] push your buttons you're like an
[1:58:53] elevator going up and down push it push
[1:58:56] it up down B and God has it that way but
[1:59:00] the thing is is that the cost is or or
[1:59:03] or or or or what you can uh actually
[1:59:06] manifest in your life that you still
[1:59:07] love that person no matter what and you
[1:59:10] don't know why but God knows God knows
[1:59:13] because the thing is the love of God has
[1:59:15] no Li limits see it's adult love it's
[1:59:18] not teenage love it's not baby love it's
[1:59:21] an adult of full maturity so charity
[1:59:24] suffer long you might be thinking what
[1:59:26] does it have to do with fear the reason
[1:59:28] you have so much fear is you don't know
[1:59:31] how to love
[1:59:35] right quiet why is that we lack the
[1:59:41] perfect love
[1:59:43] attribute see before you can get rid of
[1:59:46] fear you got to find out what love
[1:59:49] is because charity suffereth
[1:59:53] long and is kind to be a good nature
[1:59:57] tender affectionate it wishes well it is
[2:00:00] not harsh or ill natur it is gentle mild
[2:00:04] manner so this is what you know this is
[2:00:08] what God's asking of us these aren't my
[2:00:11] words this is your Bible this is what we
[2:00:14] say we believe in see the thing is you
[2:00:17] can have a wife that overdoes your steak
[2:00:20] you can have a wife that burns your
[2:00:21] toast just get the old don't say nothing
[2:00:24] be kind rake the the burnt toast burnt
[2:00:27] off the toast he just all she's doing is
[2:00:31] acting you like a god she's worshiping
[2:00:33] you she's burning you food for you
[2:00:37] listen friends charity is kind I know we
[2:00:41] don't think these things are important
[2:00:42] but these are things that are important
[2:00:43] this is what Paul's letting know to the
[2:00:45] Corinthian Church because we emphasize
[2:00:47] certain things because perfect love is
[2:00:49] who we actually really are
[2:00:52] what we actually are is what our love
[2:00:55] that portrays out of us that's who we
[2:00:58] are he said charity is kind charity
[2:01:02] envieth not envieth jealous of any
[2:01:05] person or thing not to Envy Envy others
[2:01:07] for the happiness that they enjoy can
[2:01:09] you actually be happy for
[2:01:12] others come on friends we're all humans
[2:01:16] here see we're talking about the spirit
[2:01:18] of God here the perfect love the because
[2:01:21] God dwell in love God is love and we
[2:01:24] need to dwell in there too so can we
[2:01:27] actually be happy for others see because
[2:01:29] we they may have more domestic Comforts
[2:01:31] than we have they might make more money
[2:01:33] than you they might have a better job
[2:01:35] they might have a good family life they
[2:01:36] might and we get jealous and we envy
[2:01:38] people can we actually be happy for
[2:01:40] others because real charity is being
[2:01:43] happy for others realize that brother
[2:01:45] bam tells us that you should be the
[2:01:48] happiest people on this face of the
[2:01:50] Earth see because Envy always comes in
[2:01:54] its
[2:01:55] ranks you got Ministry you got deacons
[2:01:57] you got office of the church you got
[2:01:58] music song leaders specials Ministry
[2:02:01] envies other ministers they don't envy
[2:02:03] song leaders especially
[2:02:05] me they don't man they don't envy uh uh
[2:02:09] musicians see what it is they they envy
[2:02:11] people that are in their rank it's
[2:02:13] they're in their own class because what
[2:02:15] it is that they see somebody else doing
[2:02:17] what they're doing and they envy that
[2:02:20] person say oh I wish I had had a gift
[2:02:22] like that I wish well friends the thing
[2:02:24] it's what God's made you just like in
[2:02:27] church when your singer gets up and
[2:02:29] sings and gets a you know gets oh wow I
[2:02:31] really enjoyed that special then
[2:02:32] somebody else gets up you don't really
[2:02:34] enjoy that special and because you don't
[2:02:35] like that
[2:02:38] person are we carnal
[2:02:40] here how spiritual are
[2:02:43] we see perfect love isn't
[2:02:48] jealous perfect love isn't jealous
[2:02:52] Church isn't a
[2:02:55] competition preach is not a competition
[2:02:58] song leading is not a competition
[2:03:00] musicians is not a competition offic of
[2:03:02] the church it's not a competition
[2:03:04] friends it's us that makes it a
[2:03:06] competition but it's God that does it
[2:03:08] see if God wants that person in that
[2:03:10] position he's the one that placed them
[2:03:12] see being a Christian isn't a
[2:03:15] competition we're talking about maturity
[2:03:18] a perfect love here tonight see that's
[2:03:20] why we need a judge yourselves where we
[2:03:23] are out spiritually are we in a baby
[2:03:25] stage are we in a teenage stage or are
[2:03:28] we in a full age out those stage see
[2:03:31] what's going through us how are we
[2:03:34] actually being a blessing to
[2:03:36] people you realize
[2:03:38] friends brother Brown says this I get up
[2:03:41] every morning to be a blessing to
[2:03:43] someone thinking that
[2:03:45] way that's what he
[2:03:47] said see friends the thing is I want to
[2:03:50] be a blessing to people
[2:03:52] I want to be a bless I get up in the
[2:03:54] morning I want to be a blessing to that
[2:03:55] person you know just even God bless them
[2:03:58] or say be a kind uh kind to a person
[2:04:01] that you work with that you can't stand
[2:04:04] it's hard on you I know you say these
[2:04:06] things are trivial but I'm talking about
[2:04:08] perfect love here see because the thing
[2:04:10] is that you know God is one that gives
[2:04:12] out gifts but we look for The Faults we
[2:04:15] look for
[2:04:16] Flaws we look for those things cuz our
[2:04:19] Humanity part we're we're born in a
[2:04:21] negative body
[2:04:22] we're on the negative side but God can
[2:04:25] grow this love in these vessels in these
[2:04:28] bodies so
[2:04:30] charity charity uh fath not itself is
[2:04:35] not puffed up now think about
[2:04:38] this I don't know if I'm talking to
[2:04:41] anybody see if I put a graph up what
[2:04:43] would it say where would it be on this
[2:04:45] scale of all these things I read about
[2:04:47] see because the thing is when we look at
[2:04:49] some of these things and have an
[2:04:50] understanding of some of these things I
[2:04:52] need to grow up some more can we confess
[2:04:55] that can we say that can we actually sit
[2:04:58] there and say Lord because God wants us
[2:05:00] to be honest that's what God wants us to
[2:05:02] be honest with ourselves he said do not
[2:05:05] behave itself
[2:05:06] unseemly seeketh not her own feminist
[2:05:12] Spirit why didn't he say him why did he
[2:05:15] say
[2:05:17] her see because why the bride
[2:05:23] it's the bride
[2:05:24] Age The Bride is going to be this
[2:05:27] love remember when brother bran was aino
[2:05:31] Canyon and the thing is is that he lifts
[2:05:34] up his hand and the sword came down what
[2:05:37] was happening the transferring of the
[2:05:39] kingdom of God was transferring down to
[2:05:42] the
[2:05:42] Earth comes with a word and begins to
[2:05:45] speak the word speak the
[2:05:48] word perfect love castes out all fear
[2:05:53] speak the word perfect love cast out
[2:05:56] fear do we understand it's not easy to
[2:05:59] provoke think of no evil so this perfect
[2:06:02] love has actually been transferred to us
[2:06:05] we we got a mission here I've been
[2:06:08] commissioned see I'm not commissioned
[2:06:10] just to know the doctrines because it's
[2:06:11] not perfect Doctrine it's perfect love
[2:06:14] see mature love see perfect love this is
[2:06:17] where God wants to get us to now we can
[2:06:19] say well is this attainable I say yes it
[2:06:22] is am I is this able can I able to get
[2:06:25] yes it is because he never would have
[2:06:26] put in his
[2:06:27] word it's got to be attainable see or
[2:06:30] it's just a subject matter where we can
[2:06:32] just sit around and just discuss and
[2:06:34] discuss this and discuss that see now we
[2:06:36] want to get rid of our fears but how can
[2:06:40] we move on how does it happen see that's
[2:06:43] why brother B told us the reason why the
[2:06:45] church can't move on is because it's got
[2:06:48] so much
[2:06:49] fear there's only one way to remove
[2:06:52] fear is allow mature perfect love to
[2:06:57] come in now this perfect love consists
[2:07:00] all kinds of
[2:07:02] attributes
[2:07:04] now I don't know what you drive here but
[2:07:06] most of us have spare tires will we not
[2:07:09] in our
[2:07:10] vehicles a spare tire can come in
[2:07:14] handy most of us though as Humanity part
[2:07:17] of us we don't want to be a spare tire
[2:07:19] we want to be the main Tire
[2:07:22] amen but spare tires can be handy
[2:07:26] they're designed to be handy they're
[2:07:27] designed to be in your view you get a
[2:07:29] flat tire and the thing is they come in
[2:07:31] handy when you get in trouble and the
[2:07:32] thing is now now if we can ask ourselves
[2:07:36] where am I on the scale do I have adult
[2:07:38] love remember brother bam says I'm you
[2:07:41] know when they ask him the question are
[2:07:43] you the main preacher you know what he
[2:07:44] said he says no I'm just a pebble on the
[2:07:46] beach that's what he said now do we
[2:07:48] actually believe that I think he
[2:07:50] actually believed that about himself
[2:07:52] because he was so humble about who he
[2:07:55] was because God knows how to Humble us
[2:07:59] right so understand this is that we
[2:08:02] don't want just to be you know capful I
[2:08:05] don't want just to be a creek full I
[2:08:07] want to be a river full I want something
[2:08:10] to flow through me I don't want to be
[2:08:12] self-centered I just want to be
[2:08:13] satisfied of going to church I want
[2:08:15] something more in my
[2:08:18] life but how often does Satan Rob us
[2:08:22] see because brother Bown tells us that
[2:08:25] the bride actually ministers to Christ
[2:08:30] how do we minister to him not through
[2:08:33] tapes not through
[2:08:35] books but it's actually the Bride made
[2:08:38] flesh it's the bride coming of
[2:08:41] Christ see the Bible doesn't minister to
[2:08:44] him tapes don't minister to them books
[2:08:48] don't minister to them it's actually the
[2:08:50] word made flesh so what is it friends
[2:08:53] many of many of us can sit right here
[2:08:57] just tonight we can sit in a message
[2:09:00] church and we can pretend I believe this
[2:09:03] message because remember friends you can
[2:09:07] pretend that you're a message believer
[2:09:09] you can all the quotes but have an
[2:09:12] understanding that you have not this
[2:09:14] manifestation of what I'm preaching
[2:09:15] about
[2:09:16] tonight because how
[2:09:19] patient how God has been patient with me
[2:09:23] this is what I look at how God has been
[2:09:26] patient with me as long as he says as
[2:09:29] long as you're doing what he says to do
[2:09:33] and you know you're directly LED well
[2:09:35] that there's nothing to fear he said
[2:09:39] perfect love castes out all fear there's
[2:09:42] no fear in God love takes away
[2:09:48] fear amen now watch perfect love CES out
[2:09:54] all fear and when fear is gone faith is
[2:09:59] perfect but look at the problem you're
[2:10:02] scared he won't keep his
[2:10:06] word that's the problem we're scared he
[2:10:09] won't keep his word because we try to
[2:10:11] sort everything out we categorize we
[2:10:13] think everything out we sit there and
[2:10:15] get so deep we categorize and we think
[2:10:17] that we know it and but no we don't know
[2:10:19] it we have to have confidence in his
[2:10:21] word
[2:10:21] because he goes on he says perfect love
[2:10:23] cast out of fear and as long as you got
[2:10:25] fear you can have faith so you got to
[2:10:27] have love first you got to have love
[2:10:31] first you got to have love first it
[2:10:35] drives all fear out and then faith comes
[2:10:39] in and takes the place of
[2:10:43] fear now you can have little faith and
[2:10:45] still have fear or you can have great
[2:10:48] faith and no fear but you can't have a
[2:10:51] lot of fear and have a lot of
[2:10:53] faith he can't have it that way now
[2:10:56] listen to what brother Bram says here
[2:10:59] that's where the church
[2:11:01] is you're always scared it's not going
[2:11:05] to happen that's the reason it don't
[2:11:08] happen love cast out fear when you got
[2:11:12] love fear is gone but as long as you got
[2:11:15] fear love cannot
[2:11:19] operate so you have Fe now brother bam
[2:11:22] tells us I mean I'm just touching the
[2:11:24] surface of
[2:11:25] this but you come to church and he says
[2:11:28] many people have fear that's why things
[2:11:30] don't operate like it should in a church
[2:11:33] is because you don't allow the love of
[2:11:35] God to come in amongst you and operate
[2:11:39] among you that's why brother bam when he
[2:11:41] says things like this he says I rather
[2:11:43] have the love of God than all the gifts
[2:11:45] operating he'll say statements like that
[2:11:48] see because why what is he trying to get
[2:11:49] to he's trying to drive that fear fear
[2:11:51] out of the church and trying to show us
[2:11:54] he said love has no fear he said love
[2:11:57] cast out fear and I know it's in my
[2:11:58] meaning so much that when I come into
[2:12:01] the people one of the great things I
[2:12:02] find among them is fear what makes fear
[2:12:04] is lack of confidence oh you little
[2:12:07] faith oh we have little trust little
[2:12:10] confidence if you lack confidence it
[2:12:12] will make you fear but if you love it
[2:12:15] Cast Away fear so when Peter got out of
[2:12:18] that boat he lost confidence he lost
[2:12:21] that substance because substance fear is
[2:12:24] a substance love is a substance and when
[2:12:27] you lose that substance of love you get
[2:12:30] that substance of fear and that's why
[2:12:32] you begin to sing that's why friends the
[2:12:34] thing is when he got terrified it
[2:12:36] actually overtook him just like job it
[2:12:39] overtook him now watch this he said I
[2:12:42] find out that one of the greatest
[2:12:44] hindrances that the Church of God today
[2:12:46] is that they're scared to death what are
[2:12:48] you scared about that's only what I'm
[2:12:51] wondering if you'll just only
[2:12:54] realize that who you are you don't know
[2:12:57] who you are you don't know who that is
[2:12:59] sitting next to
[2:13:02] you I'm talking about church body
[2:13:05] dedication meetings you don't know who's
[2:13:07] beside you watch oh you say yeah that's
[2:13:12] my
[2:13:13] neighbor I know I know him all right
[2:13:16] that but he's a Son of God see that's
[2:13:18] right adopted by Jesus Christ into the
[2:13:21] the family that's a daughter of God
[2:13:23] sitting next to you he said and who are
[2:13:26] you if you're a Christian believer
[2:13:28] you're a son or daughter of God what are
[2:13:30] you scared about no need of being scared
[2:13:33] as long as the devil can keep you scared
[2:13:36] that's all he wants to do he's got you
[2:13:40] right
[2:13:42] then so we emphasize so many things in
[2:13:45] the message we come to church we have
[2:13:48] emphasis what's brother Jonathan going
[2:13:50] to preach to tonight oh he really did
[2:13:53] rotten tonight he really did a bad job
[2:13:55] tonight but understand friends don't

[2:18:24] one of you how do we do it by removing
[2:18:27] that fear from us and letting the
[2:18:28] perfect love come into us and come into

[2:23:16] of good amen I had so many notes there
[2:23:19] but I loved how we started with the
[2:23:21] reason you're fearful is because the
[2:23:23] right Temperance of love has not entered
[2:23:26] yet we need more of him amen we need
[2:23:30] more of his love we need to spend more
[2:23:32] time in his presence love how he said
[2:23:34] it's a question of trust not
[2:23:37] belief because that's the challenge
[2:23:39] isn't it the challenge is to put the
[2:23:42] word into
[2:23:44] action that shows trust we believe it
[2:23:48] our soul says I believe it but now this
[2:23:50] flesh has to become subject because
[2:23:53] remember what is the manifestation in
[2:23:56] it's in flesh the soul agrees but the
[2:23:59] flesh has to be brought subject I love
[2:24:02] how he said the word is here for
[2:24:06] manifestation that's his purpose is to
[2:24:08] produce itself the word Goes Forth in
[2:24:11] power and the Holy Spirit quickens it to
[2:24:13] make it a reality in each and every one
[2:24:15] of our lives and that's when trust turns
[2:24:18] into reality what a beautiful thought
[2:24:21] and it struck me as he was saying that
[2:24:23] that if the fullness of the word has
[2:24:25] been given what does that mean for you
[2:24:28] and I the fullness of the word is to be
[2:24:32] manifested
[2:24:34] am what limit is there on the bride of
[2:24:37] Christ tonight if the full word has been
[2:24:39] open then what holds us
[2:24:41] back trust it's the only
[2:24:45] thing we're
[2:24:47] scared you know there's things I prayed
[2:24:49] about in my life life that I've never
[2:24:51] gotten healed for yet and you get to the
[2:24:54] point brother Jerry like he said you
[2:24:56] don't even want to pray about it anymore
[2:24:58] cuz you're scared it's never going to
[2:25:00] happen exactly been there done that
[2:25:02] doing it at times church right amen
[2:25:05] let's let's get honest tonight amen are
[2:25:08] we scared it's never going to happen
[2:25:11] amen because if we can't have our
[2:25:13] healing if we can't have our deliverance
[2:25:16] how are we ever going to get a Rapture
[2:25:17] yeah really anden we talk about grades
[2:25:19] of love we we talked about grades of
[2:25:21] Faith last service if you remember we're
[2:25:23] looking for rapturing Faith but we need
[2:25:25] healing faith we don't just need saving
[2:25:26] faith we need delivering faith we need
[2:25:28] guiding Faith that's right amen we need
[2:25:31] to step into a higher place and where
[2:25:32] does it come in his presence in his
[2:25:35] presence in that prayer closet I like
[2:25:38] the good Catholic
[2:25:40] comment you were vindicating some of my
[2:25:42] service from last time where I was
[2:25:44] talking about we get to the place where
[2:25:45] we check off everything a Believer does
[2:25:47] and we say that makes us a believer and
[2:25:50] what do we hear tonight what makes us a
[2:25:52] Believer is the love of God in our life
[2:25:55] it's the Holy Ghost In Action not just
[2:25:58] in me but working now for your benefit
[2:26:01] and your brothers and your sisters and
[2:26:02] these different ones
[2:26:04] amen he says love drives out fear and
[2:26:07] then faith comes in can I share a
[2:26:10] testimony this
[2:26:12] evening last service you saw people come
[2:26:14] up and be prayed for little Mary Beth
[2:26:18] came up for prayer because of a th of an
[2:26:22] issue in the glands in her throat and
[2:26:24] her throat was in such
[2:26:26] pain she was healed before she got back
[2:26:30] to her
[2:26:32] Pew because she
[2:26:35] trusted Hallelujah she took the belief
[2:26:39] amen if you have faith like a little
[2:26:42] Mustard Seed
[2:26:45] yeah how old are you Sister Mary Beth 10
[2:26:52] if a 10-year-old can
[2:26:54] trust in childlike Faith what up mature
[2:26:58] Sons and Daughters to be doing tonight I
[2:27:01] say Lord lift up my faith lift up my
[2:27:03] trust Lord take me to a higher plane
[2:27:05] Lord help me to put the word into action
[2:27:08] to rest my very life and Soul on it day
[2:27:11] by day right amen what a word we heard
[2:27:14] tonight God bless you brother Jerry all
[2:27:17] I could think of
[2:27:20] was that song More of
[2:27:23] You Can we sing
[2:27:25] that not because brother Jerry told us
[2:27:28] we needed more of him yeah but because
[2:27:31] we recognized more of him yeah I was
[2:27:34] sharing with brother Jerry in the office
[2:27:35] that God had to take the arrogance out
[2:27:38] of me and he's still taking it out
[2:27:40] sometimes but that's what he did in the
[2:27:42] 16 years that I left this church and
[2:27:45] went and traveled around and sat under
[2:27:46] Ministries and went through many things
[2:27:48] in my life was he was beat that
[2:27:50] arrogance out and it comes from a
[2:27:52] self-righteous
[2:27:54] attitude big fish in a little
[2:27:57] Pond and we think because of something
[2:28:00] that's in there family name I know more
[2:28:03] than this one I'm smarter than that one
[2:28:04] I whatever it is we go out and what
[2:28:07] happens is we limit what God can do in
[2:28:09] our life because we think we're good
[2:28:11] enough already he talked about that God
[2:28:14] had to knock me off my feet to bring me
[2:28:17] to a place where he could use me where
[2:28:20] he could fulfill his word in my life in
[2:28:21] a greater way and it came to a place
[2:28:24] where I said God I need more of you than
[2:28:27] what I have right now because what I'm
[2:28:29] facing is greater than what I have to
[2:28:31] face it with and it's going to take a
[2:28:33] supernatural event it's going to take a
[2:28:36] supernatural experience it's going to
[2:28:37] take a greater Faith than what I've got
[2:28:39] a greater love than what I've got to
[2:28:41] pass through this journey and when I
[2:28:43] humbled myself guess what all of a
[2:28:45] sudden God became magnified and all of a
[2:28:47] sudden the battle started being won
[2:28:49] instead of Lost and all of a sudden we
[2:28:51] started to grow and mature in ways that
[2:28:53] we hadn't before why because we got out
[2:28:55] of our
[2:28:57] self-righteousness that's what he was
[2:28:58] talking about tonight the check marks
[2:29:01] are not what make us Believers exactly
[2:29:04] it's the love of God the Holy Spirit In
[2:29:07] Action that is the difference between a
[2:29:09] true son and daughter of God and someone
[2:29:11] that merely says it amen we need more of
[2:29:14] him tonight Church let's say it as a
[2:29:17] prayer let's say it as a revelation
[2:29:18] tonight Lord I need more
[2:29:20] you and let that love flow
[2:29:23] in for your situation for your body for
[2:29:27] your marriage for your job whatever it
[2:29:29] might be wherever you're going whatever
[2:29:31] you're doing saying Lord if you can have
[2:29:34] the preeminence if it can be all you and
[2:29:37] none of me then I know the victory is on
[2:29:40] the way I know the way it comes out will
[2:29:42] be your
[2:29:44] way then we can have trust amen as he
[2:29:47] said when we know who we are when we
[2:29:49] know our direct leadership we can have
[2:29:52] faith and stand amen amen let's sing it

[2:34:24] years ago on one of my trips to Edmonton
[2:34:27] when we went to visit Adam um before
[2:34:31] before we left brother Gerald was
[2:34:32] preaching a series and I I don't even
[2:34:35] recall what the series was but you know
[2:34:38] what it's like when you go to another
[2:34:40] church sometimes you're go you're
[2:34:41] looking forward to maybe something
[2:34:43] different cuz I know one of his series
[2:34:46] that he preached one time is
[2:34:47] 69 was was 69 sermons on Oneness but um
[2:34:52] so anyway I I figured I'm going to hear
[2:34:54] something different and that Sunday
[2:34:56] morning I went to church and he picks up
[2:34:59] right where brother J left off and so
[2:35:02] one when I said oh I didn't get a break
[2:35:04] at all God God must have figured I
[2:35:06] really needed this you know I needed
[2:35:09] this tonight and I just wanted to say
[2:35:11] that God is moving into the ministry
[2:35:13] just beautifully he took like brother
[2:35:15] John said he must have been must have
[2:35:18] taken something out of last Sunday
[2:35:19] servant sermon but uh just I just marvel
