[41:00] bless those that are online and i
[41:02] understand that online that uh
[41:05] that there are brethren around the world
[41:10] just checking in on the youtube there
[41:12] amen and
[41:13] to listen to the ministry of the word
[41:15] and i was saying i was
[41:17] in communication by email with a brother
[41:19] in africa
[41:20] and uh he said brother you may not be
[41:23] unaware of it
[41:24] but he said there's there's uh a number
[41:27] of african
[41:28] people and ministering brothers and so
[41:30] on he said that that tune in
[41:32] online and uh he said to for the
[41:36] to hear the ministry and they've heard
[41:38] myself again of course preaching
[41:40] and they've also heard our brother
[41:41] jonathan ministering online
[41:44] amen so we don't know really who who
[41:47] we're talking to
[41:48] when it comes to ministering the word
[41:50] and when you're you're reflecting
[41:51] worship and praising the lord
[41:53] amen it's a it's even that's a blessing
[41:55] to the people
[41:56] amen and not just a singing and not just
[41:59] the music we appreciate it
[42:01] but it is the spirit that anoints it
[42:04] and the ministry of the word to god be
[42:06] the glory
[42:07] so god again god's grace and god's
[42:09] blessing upon those not with us
[42:11] amen in grace and again let me say this
[42:15] that
[42:17] it it does strike us when things come to
[42:20] this
[42:20] this level and we're not allowed to go
[42:23] to church
[42:24] we're not allowed to do this and so on
[42:26] and they reduce the numbers numbers
[42:28] numbers
[42:29] and and just not what's going on out
[42:31] there in the world but they
[42:32] they they do put the emphasis on on
[42:34] churches
[42:35] you know and i think right now this time
[42:38] they're putting the emphasis on on the
[42:39] faith groups
[42:40] and so on well that's church groups you
[42:42] know not just us
[42:44] but there's another group and another
[42:45] group so i pray the grace of god with us
[42:49] to you know to do as jesus said
[42:52] and i praise grace with air tonight
[42:54] concerning what jesus said
[42:55] where the bible says where two or three
[42:57] are gathered together my name there
[42:59] am i in the midst but from the original
[43:02] version of it it says where i
[43:03] have gathered two or three in my name he
[43:06] said i
[43:07] am in the midst because there's there's
[43:09] there are those that are meeting in the
[43:10] name of the lord
[43:12] meeting because of this word or that
[43:13] verse narrow scriptures
[43:15] just before jesus never never put them
[43:17] together
[43:18] amen it's the influence of man or is the
[43:21] influence of a religious spirit
[43:23] amen the devil a amen so trusting that
[43:25] we're here
[43:26] because of the holy ghost amen where two
[43:29] or three
[43:30] i've gathered in my name i am there in
[43:32] the midst he said
[43:34] he's there to bless you there to
[43:35] encourage you there to meet your need
[43:37] so the god of all grace be with us here
[43:40] and be with the brothers and sisters at
[43:41] home
[43:42] again whether it's two or three
[43:44] believers whether it's two or three it
[43:45] might be members of the same family
[43:47] amen trust the lord amen amen god
[43:51] is with them there and trusting and
[43:53] believing that god is with us here
[43:55] by grace amen praise the name of the
[43:58] lord god help us to have that faith
[44:00] and also to bring greetings to the
[44:03] saints from
[44:04] our brother clarence stride and he
[44:07] called the other night and i spoke with
[44:08] him on the phone for a while
[44:10] and uh his uh stepdaughter i believe is
[44:14] sister linda peckford and uh
[44:17] i've a number of times where i've met
[44:19] our brother stride out there
[44:20] and sister linda's been there as well
[44:23] amen so god bless sister linda
[44:25] and i've known her again for many many
[44:27] many years
[44:29] because as far back as i can almost
[44:30] remember that
[44:32] i remember that sister linda was there
[44:34] of course they lived
[44:35] maybe a lot closer to bishop falls than
[44:38] they do now
[44:39] so we pray the grace of god to sister
[44:41] linda and
[44:42] understand that she'll be supporting the
[44:44] ministry here
[44:45] folks supporting the work here or has
[44:48] started to support the ministry and work
[44:50] here
[44:50] so i say god bless her amen so alleluia
[44:54] to god be the glory
[44:56] so be in prayer again for the ellsworths

[45:34] it's been a long long time so we pray
[45:36] the grace of god to them
[45:38] amen and to their children and as i said
[45:41] it was many many years ago
[45:43] and since i had a
[45:46] fellowship with him and it wasn't long
[45:49] ago
[45:50] maybe just a few months ago that our
[45:52] brother
[45:53] derek and his son came to
[45:56] our apartment there at the condo
[45:59] because they they wanted me to fill in
[46:01] some papers and sign some papers for
[46:04] brother derrick's son i think his name
[46:06] is andrew so i pray the grace of god to
[46:09] them
[46:09] amen grace grace grace
[46:13] and again to keep the saints online in
[46:16] prayer
[46:17] and again don't think that brother
[46:18] gerald's just ministering to you
[46:20] ministering to people that we've never
[46:22] known on this earth
[46:24] amen but by grace we'll meet him in
[46:25] glory amen
[46:28] and again keep our brother jacob jonah
[46:30] in prayer
[46:31] and uh what's the other brother's name
[46:33] is leo
[46:35] leo he's the brother that ministered
[46:37] here yeah
[46:38] and he was in ontario and he came down
[46:41] here and ministered
[46:42] and went back again so we pray the grace
[46:44] of god to brother leonie
[46:45] and he he's got needs right now so pray
[46:48] gracious
[46:49] he's emailed me for prayer and because
[46:52] of the needs that he's got he's
[46:53] responsible for so
[46:54] many believers in uganda
[46:57] and and i think it's four churches
[47:00] that's sort of under his control
[47:02] and he's got to govern and and lay the
[47:04] word in for him
[47:05] so we pray the grace of god to him and
[47:07] his wife when they just
[47:08] when they go from one church to another
[47:10] one church to another ministering to the
[47:12] saints
[47:12] amen god bless him amen
[47:15] and i know i do believe too that there
[47:17] are ministries and churches
[47:20] in canada and in the united states that
[47:22] are helping the brother
[47:24] but again when you consider four
[47:25] churches as a as
[47:27] a big ministry and not only that
[47:31] not like this where this is a palace
[47:34] compared to the churches that he's that
[47:36] he's ministered to oh yeah because
[47:38] there's some churches
[47:39] they got a roof they got a roof they got
[47:41] a you got a floor
[47:43] but when it comes to the the walls
[47:44] there's no walls it's just uh
[47:46] just a frame amen so god help them it's
[47:50] my prayer
[47:52] whether i pray that the word is as
[47:55] good to us as it maybe is good to them
[47:58] that regardless if you got nowhere to go
[48:02] amen you appreciate the word the message
[48:04] amen so the lord bless us
[48:07] and tonight we are going to uh
[48:10] hear brother madam minister and it'll be
[48:14] about an hour i think
[48:15] and uh and the message is
[48:18] the world is falling apart
[48:21] amen if it ever was it is amen
[48:25] and it is falling apart so i pray the
[48:27] grace of god that we have
[48:29] that by not in our heads knowledge but
[48:32] by a revelation in our souls
[48:34] amen that it is god amen to god be the
[48:37] glory
[48:38] to stay with the word amen it's like one
[48:41] time that
[48:42] i was asked to be in a cemetery
[48:45] that on the bureau peninsula and i was
[48:47] asked to
[48:48] go up and give direction to a gentleman
[48:50] there in a tractor
[48:52] that was digging a grave oh
[48:56] and he didn't know how to do it didn't
[48:57] know where to do it now where's it
[48:59] i said over here right there and he went
[49:01] over and
[49:03] i said no you don't do it that way he
[49:06] said what do you mean
[49:07] and i said because i said this i said
[49:10] represents
[49:12] resurrection and i said that did go down
[49:16] and we're trusting and believing that
[49:17] they'll come back up
[49:19] you know in another dimension and he
[49:21] said what do you mean
[49:22] i said well i said you're you're going
[49:24] to dig this grave i said facing the west
[49:27] i said no i should dig it facing the
[49:29] east or you're going to dig it facing
[49:30] the north
[49:31] no i said facing the east when they put
[49:34] that
[49:34] coffin down the person is looking toward
[49:36] the east he said never heard it before
[49:39] and i said why why toward the east i
[49:41] said because that's the rising of the
[49:42] sun
[49:43] amen and most protestant churches and i
[49:46] think he was a roman catholic
[49:47] he didn't realize that and you go to
[49:50] some catholic church
[49:51] cemeteries and they're not facing east
[49:54] they're facing north or south or west
[49:56] nor you got to face east it's a
[49:58] testimony of the resurrection
[50:00] amen because that's what every every
[50:02] morning when the sun comes up
[50:04] it doesn't come up in the north or the
[50:06] south or the west it comes up
[50:07] in the east amen it goes on it closes in
[50:11] in the west
[50:12] and we're witnessing to believe the
[50:14] dawning of a new day
[50:15] amen and their son is rising in the in
[50:18] in the east so the god of all grace be
[50:21] with us
[50:21] see regardless what you're doing
[50:24] is to reflect your faith amen
[50:28] i don't know if that brother that
[50:29] gentleman in that tractor was
[50:32] dug any more graves but according to him
[50:34] i think he
[50:35] dug a lot of graves but they weren't
[50:37] facing east
[50:38] he said i was never told that so he said
[50:41] thank you
[50:42] amen and oh i'm not sure i think it
[50:44] might have been the the burial of a
[50:46] funeral of
[50:47] sister betty's uh grandmother it was her
[50:50] grandmother
[50:50] dunford mr dumford's mother amen
[50:54] and i have fellowship with her of course
[50:55] in that in your home
[50:57] for quite a while amen and i prayed with
[51:00] her
[51:01] but i do appreciate and i do have a
[51:03] picture of her sitting on her couch
[51:06] in her kitchen and she's there with the
[51:09] book that she only read and that was the
[51:11] bible
[51:12] amen and i got a picture over there
[51:14] because i noticed every time i go there
[51:15] looking and say goodbye or hello
[51:17] she's sitting on the couch with a bible
[51:20] and she was reading it
[51:21] oh i said praise the lord god rest her
[51:24] soul
[51:24] amen to god be the glory so the lord
[51:28] bless us
[51:29] as we go into the message on the world
[51:31] is falling apart
[51:33] and it was preached in new york and it
[51:35] was uh
[51:36] this was in uh november the 15th and i
[51:39] think it was two weeks later
[51:41] that he that he preached it again i'm
[51:42] not sure exactly where
[51:44] but he preached it again the world is
[51:46] falling apart
[51:48] and and amen so brother if we can see it
[51:51] if he saw it then
[51:52] what do we see now amen because
[51:55] what we're seeing is a testimony that
[51:58] it is finished amen when jesus
[52:02] wrong on the cross and he's practically
[52:05] his last words it is finished
[52:07] amen his ministry and brother i believe
[52:10] that we are witnessing
[52:12] that again grace to the bride amen
[52:16] he has come and brother and and and what
[52:18] he has done
[52:19] and what he's doing is a sign that it's
[52:21] finished it's over with luke
[52:23] amen because our redemption
[52:26] resurrection rapture is at hand
[52:29] but not just that either to bring to
[52:32] your thoughts and
[52:33] understanding the revelation of the
[52:35] prophet when he
[52:36] highlighted the fact that the rapture is
[52:37] going on now he said
[52:39] it's taking place now amen and what what
[52:43] what's the evidence well the evidence as
[52:45] time goes on
[52:46] that we're getting further and further
[52:47] away from the world getting further and
[52:50] further away from
[52:50] from the interest in this interest in
[52:52] that the natural things of life
[52:54] we're getting more and more interested
[52:56] in the spiritual not the natural
[52:59] amen and brother again that's why we
[53:02] see all that's going on in the world
[53:03] right now and it is around the world
[53:06] concerning this covet 19 amen
[53:09] and it's causing many to do to put
[53:12] beyond their guard with this beyond
[53:13] their guard with that they're so caught
[53:14] up with the natural things
[53:16] and and i'm letting the fact that when
[53:18] you when you get together you got to
[53:20] wear the the
[53:20] the mosque or the mask you got to wear
[53:23] not a mosque
[53:25] no the mosque will wear us amen so are
[53:28] you going to wear the mask
[53:30] and uh well brother i tell you they're
[53:32] going to need more than a mask
[53:34] and i guarantee you we as believers can
[53:36] wear a mask
[53:37] and leave the rest with the lord amen
[53:40] but our faith is in god
[53:42] but again the world is wearing it and
[53:44] their faith is in the mask
[53:45] oh it is that's right brother their
[53:47] faith is in the mask
[53:48] what man tells them to do they'll do
[53:50] this do this do this but brother no
[53:53] god's looking for something else amen
[53:56] and
[53:56] and really what god is looking for man
[53:58] is forgotten
[53:59] man is ignored man is not seriously
[54:01] considering it oh
[54:03] if they believe it was god oh yes they
[54:04] said well maybe this is going to happen
[54:06] maybe that's good but oh if it's god and
[54:08] god god is going to change it god will
[54:10] take it back to normal again
[54:12] you know it's the devil god has
[54:14] permitted it
[54:15] for a reason to bring up what's in the
[54:17] world and listen saints
[54:19] it's also done and allowed for a reason
[54:21] to bring up what's in you and me
[54:23] amen it'll it'll highlight the unbelief
[54:26] that's in the world
[54:27] but it'll highlight the faith that's in
[54:29] the bride amen
[54:31] because the bride looks up to god be the
[54:34] glory
[54:35] so god be with us and god bless the
[54:37] saints again
[54:38] as we go into the word on the world is
[54:41] falling
[54:42] apart but before we go in our last god

[1:04:52] amen they made a calf in oreb
[1:04:55] and worshiped the molten image thus they
[1:04:58] changed their glory into the similitude
[1:05:00] of an ox

[1:05:05] god their savior which had done great
[1:05:08] things in egypt

[1:05:16] wondrous works in the land of ham and
[1:05:18] terrible things by the red sea
[1:05:21] therefore he said that he would destroy
[1:05:23] them and not moses his chosen stood
[1:05:25] before him
[1:05:26] in the beach breach to turn away his
[1:05:29] wrath
[1:05:30] lest he should destroy them
[1:05:33] moses the spirit of christ interceding
[1:05:37] amen yea they despise the pleasant land
[1:05:42] they believe not his word but murmured
[1:05:45] in their tents
[1:05:47] and arken not unto the voice of the lord
[1:05:50] therefore he lifted up his hand against
[1:05:52] them to overthrow them
[1:05:54] in the wilderness amen to overthrow
[1:05:58] their seed also among the nations
[1:06:00] to scatter them in the lands they joined
[1:06:02] themselves also onto baal

[1:06:08] dead

[1:06:12] their inventions

[1:06:16] their inventions today
[1:06:18] and the plague breaking upon them and
[1:06:21] then stood up for
[1:06:22] phineas and executed judgment

[1:06:30] righteousness unto all generations

[1:08:27] that which it was purpose to do
[1:08:29] and we pray that you'll grant this
[1:08:31] through jesus name
[1:08:32] amen amen in the book of the
[1:08:35] revelation of jesus christ we find i'm
[1:08:38] going to
[1:08:39] read just a little bit from the sixth
[1:08:41] seal
[1:08:42] out of the book of revelations found in
[1:08:44] the sixth chapter
[1:08:46] of the revelation and then we will begin
[1:08:48] with the twelfth verse
[1:08:50] and then i also want to read from
[1:08:51] hebrews 12
[1:08:53] 25 uh to for
[1:08:56] another little quotation for some
[1:08:58] scriptures i got written down here and
[1:09:01] a few things i would like to speak on if
[1:09:04] the lord willing
[1:09:05] and now on revelation
[1:09:08] 6 12 and i beheld when he had opened the
[1:09:12] sixth seal and lo
[1:09:13] there was a great earthquake and the sun
[1:09:16] became as black as santa claus of hair
[1:09:18] and the moon became his blood and the
[1:09:21] stars of heaven
[1:09:22] fell unto the earth even as a fig tree
[1:09:25] cast her
[1:09:26] untimely face when she's shaken of a
[1:09:29] mighty wind
[1:09:30] the heavens departed as a scroll when
[1:09:33] it's rolled together and every
[1:09:35] mountain and every island were moved out
[1:09:37] of their places
[1:09:39] and the kings of the earth and the great
[1:09:41] man and the rich man
[1:09:42] the chief captains and the mighty man
[1:09:44] ever bombed the never freeman
[1:09:46] hid themselves in dens and in rocks of
[1:09:50] the mountains
[1:09:51] and said to the mountains and rocks fall
[1:09:53] on us and hide us from the face of him
[1:09:55] that set us upon the throne and from the
[1:09:58] wrath of the lamb
[1:10:00] for the great day of his wrath has come
[1:10:03] and who shall be able to stand
[1:10:06] now in the book of hebrews the 12th
[1:10:09] chapter
[1:10:10] and beginning with the 25th verse
[1:10:14] see that you refuse not him that
[1:10:16] speaketh
[1:10:17] for if they escape not who refused him
[1:10:20] and spake
[1:10:22] on the earth much more shall not we
[1:10:26] escape
[1:10:26] if we turn away from that from him that
[1:10:30] speaketh from heaven
[1:10:32] whose voice then shook the earth
[1:10:35] but now he has a point saying
[1:10:39] yea once more i shake not the earth only
[1:10:42] but also the heavens
[1:10:44] and this word yet
[1:10:47] once more signifying removing of those
[1:10:51] things which are shaken
[1:10:52] as all things that are made
[1:10:56] that those things which cannot be shaken
[1:10:59] may remain wherefore we
[1:11:03] receive a kingdom which cannot be moved
[1:11:07] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[1:11:09] god
[1:11:10] acceptable with reverence and godly fear
[1:11:14] or god is a consuming fire
[1:11:18] now this is a little
[1:11:22] text that i would like to draw from that
[1:11:25] to make the text out of it if i should
[1:11:27] call it
[1:11:28] i hope i don't hold you too long and
[1:11:31] so um don't forget tomorrow night now to
[1:11:34] come early to get the prayer cards and
[1:11:36] we'll have a prayer line where we pray
[1:11:38] for
[1:11:38] all the people so it's got the prayer
[1:11:39] cause my text tonight
[1:11:42] is the world is falling apart
[1:11:45] it's a very odd text but i'm
[1:11:50] thinking today as uh i had the glorious
[1:11:54] opportunity and the grand privilege to
[1:11:56] walk with
[1:11:57] uh brother vic this honorable noble
[1:12:00] servant of christ
[1:12:02] with brother joseph my precious friend
[1:12:05] also we had um um
[1:12:08] well it was dinner to me i think it's
[1:12:10] lunch to you all here but
[1:12:12] if that's dinner then uh this is
[1:12:16] dinner tonight and that's lunch and
[1:12:18] breakfast where does my supper come in
[1:12:21] i feel like i've left out something and
[1:12:23] then
[1:12:24] as we went to dinner and come back
[1:12:27] down the street we were noticing they
[1:12:29] were putting up
[1:12:30] starting to put up things for christmas
[1:12:34] we are approaching the christmas season
[1:12:37] and right over a month away but
[1:12:40] all the stores is getting out all their
[1:12:42] christmas sales how far
[1:12:44] they miss the meaning of christmas it's
[1:12:46] become
[1:12:48] just a commercial act all the holidays
[1:12:50] have become that
[1:12:52] mother's day father's day everyday rv
[1:12:55] mother and father's day
[1:12:57] and they have uh all the easter
[1:13:00] santa claus took the touch the
[1:13:03] birthplace
[1:13:04] a rabbit chicken a little duck took the
[1:13:07] resurrection
[1:13:08] time it's all chickens and ducks and
[1:13:11] ages and
[1:13:11] what y'all got to do with the
[1:13:12] resurrection it's too bad we
[1:13:16] that puts it before our children a many
[1:13:18] a little boy right here tonight can tell
[1:13:20] you more about
[1:13:21] davey crockett and he can tell you about
[1:13:22] jesus christ
[1:13:25] because it's a great commercial thing
[1:13:27] they take clothes like some
[1:13:29] cowboy or some hero and or something of
[1:13:32] some
[1:13:32] uh outlaw or something and and they sell
[1:13:36] clothes that looks like him and
[1:13:38] and then all the little children know
[1:13:39] about it we'll read the history of it
[1:13:41] if we could just get the program of
[1:13:43] christ over to the people like us
[1:13:45] you usually try to impersonate what you
[1:13:48] read
[1:13:49] yeah the readers i remember it's been
[1:13:51] always been that with me on
[1:13:52] remember one time as a little boy about
[1:13:55] 12 years old
[1:13:56] down in the public library i got a hold
[1:13:57] of the uh one of zane gray's books
[1:14:00] called
[1:14:01] the lone ranger i rode mama's broom to
[1:14:04] death as a
[1:14:05] hobby horse around around the house so i
[1:14:07] broke it up
[1:14:09] later on i read edgar ice buer's
[1:14:12] story of tars tarzan the apes and i
[1:14:13] slept in a tree
[1:14:15] because i i was reading that that was on
[1:14:17] my mind
[1:14:18] and oh one day i got a hold of
[1:14:20] something's real
[1:14:23] a truth not a fiction ever since then
[1:14:26] i want my life to be like his i found
[1:14:29] something
[1:14:29] that was real when i read the bible in
[1:14:31] the life of jesus christ
[1:14:34] now as we approach this season
[1:14:37] it's very familiar the world is just
[1:14:39] about the same condition it was
[1:14:41] 2 000 years ago when he come on earth on
[1:14:44] his first event
[1:14:46] when he came to the earth the earth had
[1:14:48] met its
[1:14:49] time ever so often the world gets in
[1:14:52] such a
[1:14:53] chaotic condition until there's nothing
[1:14:56] can help it
[1:14:57] we've had this several times these
[1:15:00] preludes and we
[1:15:01] we find that each time when it meets
[1:15:04] this condition
[1:15:05] and it causes people to to start praying
[1:15:09] and they feel that everything's played
[1:15:12] itself out
[1:15:13] and to all of our systems and everything
[1:15:15] that we have
[1:15:16] play itself to the end it did that in
[1:15:18] the andalusian world and so forth
[1:15:20] uh politics and and other things just
[1:15:23] comes to its end
[1:15:24] there's no more to it and i think all
[1:15:26] that's done by god for a purpose
[1:15:28] to kind of uh rejuvenate to kind of
[1:15:31] bring back
[1:15:32] it has a way of renewing itself and i
[1:15:34] think it's just a
[1:15:36] law of god that these things comes to
[1:15:37] that place
[1:15:40] the time of christ's first advent i
[1:15:43] i believe we could say the world was
[1:15:46] falling apart
[1:15:48] it was a corruptible time in politics
[1:15:51] across all time and in religion
[1:15:55] the whole systems have become corrupted
[1:15:58] that mingle uh injecting
[1:16:01] other things and man-made theories into
[1:16:04] religions and so forth until
[1:16:06] the whole thing was corruptible and the
[1:16:09] world
[1:16:09] was a falling apart and the world at
[1:16:12] that time
[1:16:13] was praying for a messiah
[1:16:17] now the romans was praying for a messiah
[1:16:21] the greeks wanted a messiah the jews
[1:16:24] wanted a messiah
[1:16:26] and god gave him a messiah
[1:16:29] but they didn't want it the way he sent
[1:16:31] it and i wonder today in our
[1:16:34] chaotic time that if all of us reaching
[1:16:37] this place again
[1:16:38] as we approach christmas we find the
[1:16:41] world
[1:16:41] about the same condition morally decayed
[1:16:46] and politics is decades religious life
[1:16:49] is
[1:16:49] is decade denominationalism is the cage
[1:16:52] and everything is just corrupted
[1:16:54] and all of us are looking for uh
[1:16:57] something to help us out of it
[1:17:00] all of us are expecting a messiah
[1:17:03] i wonder if god sent us the messiah if
[1:17:07] we would just about do the same thing
[1:17:09] they've done in the past we wouldn't
[1:17:11] know him
[1:17:12] we'd know who he was i don't think the
[1:17:15] world would recognize
[1:17:16] him at all and notice why
[1:17:20] here's my thought the reason why
[1:17:23] the romans they had their idea what a
[1:17:26] messiah should be each one of us has got
[1:17:28] our own ideas
[1:17:29] each denomination has its ideas we've
[1:17:31] been taught
[1:17:32] drawn out on charts and everything what
[1:17:34] the messiah should be
[1:17:36] that's going to be our church is the
[1:17:37] ones going to receive it well
[1:17:39] the jews the pharisees thought that and
[1:17:41] so the sadducees taught their side
[1:17:43] same thing you see spirits doesn't die
[1:17:46] just the man that's
[1:17:46] occupied see that the devil doesn't take
[1:17:50] his spirit he only takes
[1:17:52] it the man and the good thing about it
[1:17:55] god doesn't take his spirit later see it
[1:17:58] remains
[1:17:59] just the name same spears upon christ is
[1:18:03] upon the believer today
[1:18:04] a true believer now
[1:18:09] notice the romans in that day were
[1:18:11] looking for
[1:18:12] a messiah a politician
[1:18:16] they wanted somebody or to come down
[1:18:19] from
[1:18:20] jupiter or someone to come down with a
[1:18:22] chair a fire and a
[1:18:24] son behind his head and he drove the
[1:18:27] chats across the sky
[1:18:28] and wanted jupiter to come down and give
[1:18:31] him the gimmick
[1:18:32] uh the military secret how they could
[1:18:35] stomp out the whole world that's what
[1:18:38] they wanted to do they wanted to be down
[1:18:40] the greeks and
[1:18:41] and master the whole world that's kind
[1:18:43] of messiah they wanted
[1:18:45] well the greeks wanted that kind of
[1:18:47] messiah to come and tell them
[1:18:50] just exactly the kind of strategy that
[1:18:52] they could use to beat the romans down
[1:18:54] see that's kind in the jews they were
[1:18:56] looking
[1:18:57] for a general some man that was coming
[1:19:00] with a rod of r in his hand
[1:19:03] and a lion a tribe of judah and he was
[1:19:06] going to a rule
[1:19:07] nations and run rome out into the river
[1:19:10] and drown them and
[1:19:11] and and israel was going to take over
[1:19:13] that's the reason
[1:19:15] why he come exactly the way the
[1:19:17] scripture said he would come
[1:19:18] but they was looking for him in a
[1:19:19] different way
[1:19:21] if it wouldn't be the same thing today
[1:19:23] if he comes if we wouldn't think that we
[1:19:25] have
[1:19:26] our own ideas about what he ought to be
[1:19:28] and what he ought to look like and how
[1:19:30] he should wear his clothes and parties
[1:19:31] hair
[1:19:32] everything if it isn't just on the taste
[1:19:34] but we wouldn't receive it you see
[1:19:36] i mean we the world today all right
[1:19:39] they are there the jews
[1:19:42] uh they rejected the messiah
[1:19:46] because that he didn't fit their taste
[1:19:49] he didn't
[1:19:50] a few days ago a fine uh taylor
[1:19:53] out in tucson was uh cutting some
[1:19:55] trousers farming
[1:19:57] and he was curious i heard he's broken
[1:20:01] english and and i said uh what are you
[1:20:04] jewish he said yes sir and he said i
[1:20:07] suppose you're christian i said yes sir
[1:20:09] so he went ahead fixing my trousers and
[1:20:11] i thought i let him lead next
[1:20:13] and he said uh well he said i have
[1:20:15] nothing against you christians i said
[1:20:17] thank you sir i have nothing against you
[1:20:19] and he said he said i said what's your
[1:20:22] opinion of christ he said
[1:20:24] he came uh too early
[1:20:28] and they said he was too young for the
[1:20:29] job and i said
[1:20:31] yes sir he said it was just a little too
[1:20:33] young for his job
[1:20:34] so now christ of jesus were to come
[1:20:37] today not christ they don't believe it
[1:20:39] so jesus would have come today his
[1:20:41] program had been all right said it's
[1:20:42] something another like
[1:20:43] rockefeller and goldwater said they're
[1:20:46] fighting one another
[1:20:47] and in the same party and he said you
[1:20:50] see uh
[1:20:50] they wanted to be doing that i said
[1:20:52] that's correct said when jesus came
[1:20:54] said he come fighting his own party his
[1:20:57] people i said oh no he came to his own
[1:20:59] in his own receiving heart
[1:21:01] that was interesting so i let him rest
[1:21:04] till i get back and see
[1:21:06] a little at a time because i remember
[1:21:08] god glided his eye i thought i could see
[1:21:11] so i i'm very grateful to the race that
[1:21:13] i certainly am
[1:21:14] don't you worry israel if you're sitting
[1:21:16] here your time sooner than
[1:21:20] now many times we say that
[1:21:23] no he wasn't no he was not jew
[1:21:26] he was a jew not gentile he was god see
[1:21:30] the hemoglobin is where the life cell is
[1:21:34] and the lifestyle was a creative cell by
[1:21:37] god
[1:21:38] there was no no social life between god
[1:21:42] and mary
[1:21:43] there's not even a sensation he's
[1:21:45] created both germs
[1:21:47] right egg and cell and he was neither
[1:21:50] jew nor gentile he was that breach
[1:21:51] between he was god
[1:21:53] and if he was jewish blood were lost if
[1:21:55] his gentile blood were lost
[1:21:57] he was the blood of god created without
[1:21:59] sexual desire
[1:22:01] that's that's reason our faith can look
[1:22:03] there and stand assured that's it
[1:22:05] so he died for both now we find
[1:22:09] that when he came oh he didn't come in
[1:22:11] the taste
[1:22:12] of the jew so they conditioned it we
[1:22:15] can't stand about because we do the same
[1:22:17] thing
[1:22:18] what a cause is that i believe there was
[1:22:21] a cause for that
[1:22:22] and i think it is because they have
[1:22:25] tucked the word of god
[1:22:26] and made it of no effect by their
[1:22:28] traditions jesus said so
[1:22:30] he said you by your traditions has made
[1:22:33] the word of god of no effect
[1:22:36] that's right it wasn't effective because
[1:22:38] it added and projected into it their
[1:22:40] traditions
[1:22:41] and when you can't add nothing to that
[1:22:44] you can't take nothing from it it's
[1:22:46] that's just the way it is
[1:22:48] that's why god preserved it we can't add
[1:22:50] creeds and
[1:22:51] dogmas and things to inject in that
[1:22:53] that's don't need any help
[1:22:55] that's that's him that's human letter
[1:22:57] form and the word is the seed and the
[1:22:59] seed in the right kind of ground will
[1:23:01] grow
[1:23:02] if you don't dig it up every morning to
[1:23:03] find out where it's grown or not you
[1:23:05] just plant it commit it to god and leave
[1:23:07] it there that's the way that it goes
[1:23:08] just leave it the way it's in the ground
[1:23:11] and that's where it's supposed to be the
[1:23:12] ground of your heart
[1:23:13] faith is lord and hour they say god said
[1:23:16] so it's mine
[1:23:17] that's the way to do it so the whole
[1:23:19] world then
[1:23:20] was falling apart like it is today every
[1:23:23] nation was looking for
[1:23:25] someone to to uh
[1:23:29] hold them out uh this tragedy
[1:23:32] it was about to strike the world and
[1:23:33] trying to hold them together the nations
[1:23:36] were looking for something and
[1:23:38] and each nation was looking for it but
[1:23:40] they looked like they didn't want to
[1:23:41] accept
[1:23:42] what god sent them they were asking for
[1:23:45] a man a messiah that would
[1:23:49] stop out the wrestling nation and god
[1:23:51] give them
[1:23:52] a baby asking for a general and got a
[1:23:56] baby
[1:23:57] god knowed what they had need of he
[1:24:00] humiliated them that's what god does he
[1:24:03] humiliates us when we think we know
[1:24:05] something like he said to joe you're so
[1:24:08] got so much wisdom
[1:24:09] why was you where i lived the foundation
[1:24:10] of the world when the morning stars sing
[1:24:13] together and the sons of god shouted for
[1:24:14] joy
[1:24:15] where is he job when his wisdom was done
[1:24:18] see god humiliates us when we get to
[1:24:21] thinking we're something great
[1:24:22] when we think our organization is the
[1:24:24] only one god will come back from
[1:24:25] something is nowhere
[1:24:27] rise up something and humiliate us by it
[1:24:29] he always does it that way
[1:24:32] yes he they asked for a general and got
[1:24:34] a baby god
[1:24:36] know what they had need of that's right
[1:24:39] they asked for a general and got a
[1:24:41] savior although they thought they were
[1:24:43] saved
[1:24:44] but god's visit to him showed that they
[1:24:46] wasn't maybe that's a whole that's
[1:24:48] what's the matter today the world faiths
[1:24:49] are saved by joining church
[1:24:51] but they need a savior
[1:24:54] if that isn't a picture of the world
[1:24:56] today i don't know the world
[1:24:58] that's just about the way it is at this
[1:24:59] christmas again we find the same thing
[1:25:01] the world falling apart
[1:25:03] if you go to this that's gone you go to
[1:25:06] this that's gone
[1:25:07] it's got that way so that we will come
[1:25:10] to this
[1:25:12] it takes all the props out from under us
[1:25:14] so that we can
[1:25:16] we can have to come to the only resource
[1:25:19] there is and that's eternal life
[1:25:23] it's uh now looking today as it was then
[1:25:25] for some system to hold it together
[1:25:28] as it was then it is now again falling
[1:25:31] apart
[1:25:31] in the religious world then was looking
[1:25:34] for a promised messiah
[1:25:36] to do this and god keeps his promise
[1:25:40] he never fails to keep his promise in
[1:25:43] all ages
[1:25:44] when the world was falling apart in the
[1:25:46] time of noah
[1:25:47] god sent him a mighty prophet what did
[1:25:50] they do with it
[1:25:51] turn it down what is the prophet the one
[1:25:53] the word comes to
[1:25:55] it's the word of god again in the time
[1:25:58] of
[1:25:58] a nor they said in moses time a whole
[1:26:02] system is falling apart they sent a
[1:26:04] prophet in elijah's time
[1:26:06] a whole system is falling apart they set
[1:26:08] a profit
[1:26:09] every time when the world gets in this
[1:26:11] chaos they send a prophet
[1:26:13] and then at this first christmas he set
[1:26:16] the word in its fullness
[1:26:17] see the word opposed to the word and the
[1:26:19] prophet prophet had the message for that
[1:26:21] age
[1:26:22] and he went forth giving the prophet and
[1:26:23] what did they do with them each time
[1:26:25] stone them they didn't agree with their
[1:26:28] systems
[1:26:28] and put them to death jesus said you
[1:26:31] do garnish the walls of the prophets the
[1:26:34] tombs in your fathers put them in there
[1:26:37] and you testify that you're their
[1:26:40] children
[1:26:41] see they do it it's just too bad but
[1:26:43] that's that's the world
[1:26:45] see it's always god sends his word
[1:26:48] and wisdom tries to burst the word
[1:26:51] that's the way it was at the beginning
[1:26:53] the very thing started the whole system
[1:26:55] of sin
[1:26:56] was because somebody eve
[1:27:00] satan produced a better plan than god's
[1:27:03] he
[1:27:04] produce wisdom they eat from the tree of
[1:27:06] knowledge wisdom always takes you away
[1:27:09] from
[1:27:09] god faith brings you back to god
[1:27:13] you don't know god but you're a great
[1:27:15] wisdom you and it's so good it said the
[1:27:17] world is foolishness to god
[1:27:19] but it please god through the
[1:27:21] foolishness of preaching his word to
[1:27:22] save
[1:27:23] the lost so god
[1:27:26] always used something foolish and simple
[1:27:29] when he called his disciples if he would
[1:27:32] have uh
[1:27:33] chosen campuses and the great priests
[1:27:35] that they had trained for that hour
[1:27:37] there's been something to brag on they
[1:27:39] had their doctor's degree and everything
[1:27:41] but
[1:27:41] he goes down and gets ignorant man
[1:27:45] fishermen who couldn't even read their
[1:27:46] own name or write their own name
[1:27:48] and he might take nothing and make
[1:27:50] something out of it
[1:27:52] even the great saint paul said he had to
[1:27:54] forget all he ever known
[1:27:56] that he might find christ he told the
[1:27:59] church i
[1:27:59] would come to you with the excesses of
[1:28:01] words of wisdom of this world
[1:28:03] because you build your faith in that and
[1:28:05] look today people don't want a pastor
[1:28:07] that's he can talk just
[1:28:08] properly make all these nouns and
[1:28:09] pronouns and of that be so i couldn't
[1:28:12] get no pulp because
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:25] the thing we want to know is him but to
[1:28:28] see
[1:28:29] our religious system has uh adopted the
[1:28:33] educational system and took the place of
[1:28:35] the holy spirit that's what it's done
[1:28:37] now in the days of noah the days of
[1:28:40] moses they sent the prophets to them and
[1:28:42] what do they do
[1:28:42] storm amen put them to death song to
[1:28:46] pieces
[1:28:46] burn them any way you get rid of them
[1:28:48] get them off with their hands
[1:28:50] yeah jesus taught the very fine
[1:28:53] abrupt terrible when he said there was a
[1:28:56] man
[1:28:56] a great man made him had a vineyard and
[1:28:58] put dressers in it
[1:29:00] and he sent a servant and they killed
[1:29:02] him and sent another servant and they
[1:29:03] killed him and
[1:29:04] so forth and said finally he said i'll
[1:29:06] send the son and they'll regard him and
[1:29:08] the the dressers of the vineyard said
[1:29:10] this is heir let's kill him
[1:29:12] that was god's son that he sent sending
[1:29:15] the prophets
[1:29:16] saying his word the word god you
[1:29:18] remember
[1:29:19] every fallen generation there's only one
[1:29:22] thing that can bridge this world
[1:29:23] together
[1:29:24] that's the word of god this world was
[1:29:27] made by the word of god is praying
[1:29:29] together by the word of god
[1:29:31] that's the only thing to ever keep it
[1:29:33] together is the word of god
[1:29:35] our hebrews said we understand that the
[1:29:37] world was framed by the word of god
[1:29:40] people doubt the word of god in the very
[1:29:42] dirt that you're sitting on this a word
[1:29:44] of god made manifest the very seeks that
[1:29:46] you're sitting in
[1:29:47] it's a word of god made manifest
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:50] god speaks it it has to happen because
[1:29:53] it's uh
[1:29:54] the word of god now the only thing that
[1:29:56] can keep it together will never be a
[1:29:58] political system it'll never be a u.n
[1:30:00] it'll never be any of these
[1:30:02] organizations it'll be the word of god
[1:30:04] that keeps the world
[1:30:06] together that's the only thing that i
[1:30:08] can recommend today
[1:30:09] to keep the world from falling apart
[1:30:11] right now is back to the word of god
[1:30:14] that's god's program always the garden
[1:30:17] of eden
[1:30:18] satan come along and said to eve he said
[1:30:20] uh you should take the fruit of the tree
[1:30:23] and uh she said but the lord said i said
[1:30:25] now oh surely you'll not die
[1:30:27] see he knows as long as people stay
[1:30:30] fortified
[1:30:31] this is what we're supposed to say 45 is
[1:30:33] the word
[1:30:35] see we are surrounded by the word
[1:30:38] the word is in you god in you
[1:30:42] around you wherever you go it's the word
[1:30:44] the word
[1:30:45] keep him always before you remember be
[1:30:47] conscious of him everywhere
[1:30:49] now when even adam walked like that
[1:30:52] there was no death
[1:30:53] the man or woman that walks like that
[1:30:54] now there's no death to him they got
[1:30:56] eternal life
[1:30:57] when you're when you're surrounded and
[1:30:59] kept by the word
[1:31:01] now watch wisdom comes up the verse the
[1:31:04] word
[1:31:05] and when it does it broke that barrier
[1:31:08] and when satan found out that that was
[1:31:10] the place he could hit the human race
[1:31:12] that's exactly what's hit it every time
[1:31:14] even in an antichrist spirit so close
[1:31:17] that were to see the very elect in the
[1:31:18] last age it comes in the form of
[1:31:20] religion
[1:31:21] now there's not no such thing as a
[1:31:23] communistic party ever fooling anybody
[1:31:26] there are anti-gods you begin with but
[1:31:28] that's not the antichrist
[1:31:30] the antichrist is religion so close he
[1:31:33] was deceived they're very elected
[1:31:35] look at judah says walk back with the
[1:31:37] church and profess
[1:31:38] christ he done everything the rest of
[1:31:40] them did
[1:31:41] went out and even cast out devils and
[1:31:43] come back rejoicing with him
[1:31:44] correctly matthew 10 but when it come to
[1:31:47] the place at pentecost
[1:31:49] to receive eternal life he showed his
[1:31:51] colors that's what comes today the devil
[1:31:54] lets you have all the church joining you
[1:31:56] want to
[1:31:56] but when it comes to the time that you
[1:31:58] receive the holy ghost hearts a bunch of
[1:32:00] holy rollers or something
[1:32:01] you don't want nothing to do with that
[1:32:04] and judas and his system can follow
[1:32:06] right
[1:32:06] up to that hour because that's where
[1:32:08] judas deceived the world
[1:32:09] up to that spot but he couldn't do it
[1:32:11] that's the elected right there
[1:32:13] now he can come that close but he uh but
[1:32:15] he can't come the rest away because if
[1:32:17] you would he'd be your brother then
[1:32:19] so you can't you do that somebody said
[1:32:22] you know the devil got me no he never
[1:32:24] he you went not enter him he never come
[1:32:26] and got you
[1:32:27] because you are dead and your life is
[1:32:30] hitting god
[1:32:32] and sealed by the holy ghost
[1:32:35] the only way he can ever get in there is
[1:32:37] the same way you did
[1:32:38] so he just invited you walked out to him
[1:32:40] that's all
[1:32:41] see it isn't he coming after you he
[1:32:43] can't come in there for you are
[1:32:45] in christ dead to yourself
[1:32:49] amen i'm not amen myself but that he's
[1:32:52] so big and i
[1:32:54] know it's true uh
[1:32:57] experienced it and know that it's true
[1:32:59] it's passing from death unto life to
[1:33:01] receive christ in you all right
[1:33:05] now we find then that the religious
[1:33:07] world
[1:33:08] and that day was falling apart and um
[1:33:11] they had always done it before and why
[1:33:15] is because
[1:33:16] that the coming prophets and the coming
[1:33:19] messiah
[1:33:20] did not meet their specification there
[1:33:22] is a theological term
[1:33:24] for it they it didn't that's the way
[1:33:27] we'll be today
[1:33:28] uh this is probably today that we're
[1:33:31] we're stunned in this day because in the
[1:33:34] move of god because it
[1:33:36] even in the churches it doesn't exactly
[1:33:39] come to the terms of what
[1:33:40] they've got to figure out it should be
[1:33:42] they figure out that there should be a
[1:33:44] time that
[1:33:45] certain certain things don't happen and
[1:33:47] and then when the real criminality comes
[1:33:49] down well then
[1:33:50] they reject that then and uh what's the
[1:33:53] use of putting up electric water if you
[1:33:54] refuse that animal
[1:33:56] see they can't get no kerning it's just
[1:33:58] a dead law
[1:33:59] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:34:01] today we got all the wires up you press
[1:34:03] the button there's no light
[1:34:04] what we need is get connected that's all
[1:34:06] of us
[1:34:08] get connected with christ our lives of
[1:34:11] our emotions the lives of our minds
[1:34:14] connected in him you say well i i tell
[1:34:17] you
[1:34:18] i i uh i believe i you have got no you
[1:34:21] ain't got no thought coming
[1:34:22] that's right you said i think this you
[1:34:25] have a god of thought i haven't either
[1:34:26] the bible said let the mind that was in
[1:34:29] christ be in you
[1:34:30] and he was always about the father's
[1:34:32] business so that's the only thought you
[1:34:33] ought to have
[1:34:33] what god said about it not what somebody
[1:34:36] else said but what god said that's all
[1:34:38] you see he said all the man's word be
[1:34:41] lying mind me the truth
[1:34:43] that's the thing to put the world back
[1:34:45] together but they won't receive it
[1:34:47] now we know they won't cause they never
[1:34:48] did all right
[1:34:51] we wonder then if the answer is today
[1:34:54] the cry
[1:34:54] today is for help for the messiah to
[1:34:57] come
[1:34:58] and i believe sometimes if we would if
[1:35:00] he would stand it i wonder if we would
[1:35:01] do the same thing he did then
[1:35:03] all of our politics both in religion and
[1:35:07] both in the uh federal life and so forth
[1:35:10] is polluted
[1:35:11] uh we polluted our worship with man-made
[1:35:14] designed
[1:35:15] fashions fashioned and designed a
[1:35:17] man-made to fit every cult that's on the
[1:35:19] face of the earth
[1:35:20] everyone's got their own idea again it
[1:35:23] must be come again like it was in the
[1:35:25] days
[1:35:25] when god rolls up the mighty prophet
[1:35:27] isaiah said your sacrifices and things
[1:35:30] has become a states in my nose
[1:35:32] see israel first when god told him to
[1:35:34] take a sacrifice
[1:35:36] and go over it while it was a great
[1:35:38] thing you can imagine a jew going down
[1:35:40] the road
[1:35:41] with a lamb a fat little lamb or a
[1:35:43] bulldog or whatever he was
[1:35:45] it was a passover and he goes down lays
[1:35:48] his hands upon the
[1:35:49] sacrifice that's connecting himself
[1:35:52] identifying himself with the sacrifice
[1:35:54] when he puts his hand on
[1:35:55] the priest killed the beast the little
[1:35:58] lamb whatever it was and there's a
[1:35:59] little fella
[1:36:00] died kicking and blading the blood
[1:36:03] splashed upon his hands and the
[1:36:04] worshiper in sincerity
[1:36:06] no that that shouldn't be him but the
[1:36:08] lamb was taking his place that's what
[1:36:10] jehovah required because it was a type
[1:36:12] of christ but one time that kept on
[1:36:15] going on until it became a
[1:36:16] family tradition they offered the land
[1:36:19] just the same but there was no sincerity
[1:36:21] about it
[1:36:22] god said they sneak in my nostrils and
[1:36:25] today
[1:36:25] years ago we used to find the people in
[1:36:28] deep sincerity and worship
[1:36:30] and today it's become a big glamour of
[1:36:32] hollywood
[1:36:33] just uh some kind of a trained uh
[1:36:36] music and uh women up on the platform
[1:36:39] with their clothes tight enough to skin
[1:36:41] on the outside
[1:36:42] almost dancing around on the platform no
[1:36:45] sincerity you're not
[1:36:46] almost making an uh uh just an outlet
[1:36:49] a ridiculous shame professing
[1:36:52] christianity
[1:36:53] i wonder if our offerings hasn't become
[1:36:56] kind of stench in his nose again our
[1:36:58] differences it's such a shame
[1:37:00] that the enemy has taken our american
[1:37:03] women and stripped them down out there
[1:37:05] on the streets and
[1:37:06] why it's it's a disgrace no wonder
[1:37:09] little boys and little girls and things
[1:37:10] are in such a shape as they are today
[1:37:13] they're always trying to pattern after
[1:37:14] some woman out here in hollywood
[1:37:17] married four or five times and she'll
[1:37:18] come out with some sort of a
[1:37:20] nude clothes on and all the little girls
[1:37:22] in the country a pattern after that
[1:37:24] what a pity that's too bad yes sir
[1:37:28] it's too bad you got into the church the
[1:37:30] beautiful virtue that god gave a woman
[1:37:33] to be a mother
[1:37:34] has been marred and that's the backbone
[1:37:36] of the nation you break motherhood you
[1:37:38] broke the nation right then
[1:37:39] that's one thing it helps hold it
[1:37:41] together real genuine parenthood
[1:37:44] i was talking to the cab driver coming
[1:37:46] down we talked about some delinquent
[1:37:48] children up there and he said
[1:37:49] i think it's the parents i said hey man
[1:37:51] oh i don't know who you are but you're
[1:37:53] on the right road
[1:37:54] and i said that's right i said it's too
[1:37:56] bad that they
[1:37:57] took the bible out of the home and gave
[1:37:59] him a deck of cards
[1:38:01] and i started in the church standing on
[1:38:03] the elevator a few moments ago in a
[1:38:04] certain moment
[1:38:05] on there talking to another said well
[1:38:07] you know he said this is a
[1:38:09] wonderful thing our church is giving a
[1:38:11] card party
[1:38:12] and how they were going to have some
[1:38:14] kind of a thanksgiving turkey
[1:38:16] affair that there's going out of a
[1:38:18] protestant
[1:38:19] church home gambling lottery
[1:38:24] bunker dances oh when it gets to a time
[1:38:27] that people have to do stuff like that
[1:38:29] to entertain the church the church born
[1:38:32] again the holy ghost entertains the
[1:38:33] church
[1:38:34] with eternal life
[1:38:38] but people they don't want that because
[1:38:40] they're pleasure stricken
[1:38:42] it's too bad that the things happen the
[1:38:44] way we have
[1:38:45] long ago too long ago as the beautiful
[1:38:49] virtue
[1:38:49] of women and their fine dress has bowed
[1:38:52] before the shrine of the goddess of
[1:38:54] hollywood
[1:38:55] to truth it's such a pity that the
[1:38:58] world's got in a place like that
[1:39:00] nation backbone is broken sex appeal
[1:39:03] is many times regarded as fashion
[1:39:09] people dressing going out on the street
[1:39:13] you know what the bible said i'll tell
[1:39:15] you
[1:39:16] i was speaking on that one time and
[1:39:18] there's a noted minister said to me
[1:39:20] he said uh why don't you leave away from
[1:39:22] them women doing that
[1:39:23] saying that i told him i said said you
[1:39:25] ought to teach them how to become
[1:39:27] prophetess and so forth like that i said
[1:39:30] how
[1:39:30] am i going to teach them algebra when
[1:39:32] they won't even learn their abcs
[1:39:35] always believe christ you know hey bc
[1:39:37] and so i said
[1:39:39] how can you do that all these
[1:39:42] things have just been a great
[1:39:44] conglomeration that's
[1:39:45] weeded into the church it's too bad it's
[1:39:48] getting amongst
[1:39:48] we pentecostal people old people stop
[1:39:52] paint you may call me a fanatic now but
[1:39:54] that's a day of the judgment you'll
[1:39:56] shake my hand
[1:39:58] uh i love you what's your
[1:40:01] godly lie and i want you to be right
[1:40:04] friends

[1:40:10] don't they
[1:40:11] that's the only kind of clothes they
[1:40:13] make for women i said they still make
[1:40:15] goods and sell sewing machines
[1:40:16] there's no excuse to try look and let me
[1:40:19] say one thing again
[1:40:20] is this you know if you dress like that
[1:40:24] and some center on the street looks at
[1:40:26] you in the wrong way
[1:40:28] you're going to answer at the day of
[1:40:30] judgment for committing adultery with
[1:40:32] that sinner
[1:40:33] you might be as virtues to your husband
[1:40:35] as you can be you might be his virtues
[1:40:37] to your boyfriend as loyal as you know
[1:40:39] how to be
[1:40:39] but in the sight of god you're a street
[1:40:41] heart you say is that right threw that
[1:40:44] by the word brother brown
[1:40:45] he said ask you anything if it was a
[1:40:47] word yes sir jesus said
[1:40:48] whosoever look up upon a woman to lust
[1:40:51] after her
[1:40:52] has committed adultery with her already
[1:40:54] in his heart
[1:40:55] and if you present yourself like that
[1:40:57] you're a cause of it that's exactly
[1:40:59] though you be innocent in yourself
[1:41:00] you've presented yourself to that sinner
[1:41:02] like that when he answers for it
[1:41:04] you'll be the one to be guilty oh get
[1:41:07] you some clothes and cover up
[1:41:09] not like ladies that's right and you
[1:41:12] man you don't let your wives do a thing
[1:41:15] like that wear them kind of close
[1:41:17] don't you have no respect for you or her
[1:41:18] either one
[1:41:20] let your wife sit and smoke cigarettes
[1:41:22] in the house and blow it
[1:41:24] why do you and then call yourself a
[1:41:26] christian
[1:41:27] uh i can't understand that you say why
[1:41:30] not wait a minute um
[1:41:31] uh uh by the way i know then that's what
[1:41:34] i'm talking about
[1:41:34] see i try if you love the lord with all
[1:41:37] your heart

[1:41:50] he's my god he's my love he's
[1:41:53] all and all that i have leader that are
[1:41:55] needed in christ
[1:41:56] [Applause]
[1:41:59] thirsty
[1:43:04] breaks into a message and speaks like
[1:43:06] that there must be something important
[1:43:08] that's going to happen oh
[1:43:26] [Applause]
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:43:58] amen the people said amen
[1:44:03] i remember if i got the interpretation
[1:44:05] right we are to warn the people see
[1:44:07] the coming of the lord and that's worn
[1:44:09] with the right kind of a life behind it
[1:44:11] because you can't talk to man living
[1:44:12] anyway and then go tell him he knows
[1:44:14] he's living as well as you are see let's
[1:44:15] get right and get ready
[1:44:17] because i believe the holy spirit wants
[1:44:18] us to know these things and to be ready
[1:44:20] for this
[1:44:21] great thing that's fixing to happen yes
[1:44:24] yes sir the hour the world is now
[1:44:27] falling apart
[1:44:28] the all systems are falling apart why is
[1:44:31] it
[1:44:32] it's got to come that way see is we're
[1:44:35] looking for a city whose builder and
[1:44:36] maker is god
[1:44:38] and all these earthly things has to give
[1:44:39] away to it now
[1:44:41] we find out that god promised to supply
[1:44:43] all of our needs we had need of in this
[1:44:45] journey is that right
[1:44:47] but remember he only supplies him on
[1:44:49] conditions
[1:44:51] we've got to meet his condition first if
[1:44:54] we do not meet his condition he will not
[1:44:56] meet
[1:44:57] our condition we've got to do the thing
[1:45:00] that's right first got to go down to the
[1:45:02] bottom and
[1:45:03] build up that's exactly we can't start
[1:45:05] at the top and come down
[1:45:06] we got to go to the bottom and build up
[1:45:08] go back to the bottom
[1:45:10] now he'll meet our condition all of his
[1:45:12] promises our own condition
[1:45:14] but we try to reverse this by our
[1:45:18] traditions
[1:45:18] we try to make god something else we are
[1:45:22] going to inject our tradition it says
[1:45:24] just a little better or that's the way
[1:45:26] the people try to fake it now i'm not
[1:45:27] just speaking to this church
[1:45:29] right here this group of people i'm
[1:45:30] speaking of to the world it's being
[1:45:33] taped here and go all around the world
[1:45:35] what we say we want our wants supplied
[1:45:39] but he supplies our needs that's a
[1:45:41] different we want our wants
[1:45:43] and he gives us our needs but he knows
[1:45:45] what we have need of
[1:45:47] and we would most surely the world would
[1:45:49] today
[1:45:50] accept it if it come according to our
[1:45:53] tradition
[1:45:54] oh the baptist would like to say it's
[1:45:56] according to what we believe this to see
[1:45:58] you were all wrong
[1:45:59] the message saying now you've done this
[1:46:01] wrong it's going to want it come the way
[1:46:03] we believed it but i
[1:46:04] imagine it'll come different from what
[1:46:06] any of us think about it
[1:46:08] that's right it's going to come the way
[1:46:10] god is our danger to come
[1:46:12] and it's just not in man to be able to
[1:46:13] cut this thing out and say it's that way
[1:46:16] now would you we wonder today what's why
[1:46:19] the gifts and things are not in the
[1:46:20] church operating the way they should be
[1:46:22] while the gifts are put into church to
[1:46:24] separate and take sin out to keep the
[1:46:26] church clean
[1:46:27] it's a it's god's uh uh toxin
[1:46:31] that's given to the church it's god's
[1:46:33] also his disinfect
[1:46:35] that he puts into the church to kill out
[1:46:37] all the
[1:46:38] parasites that it tears the church and
[1:46:41] and uh
[1:46:42] it's god springs his church over with
[1:46:44] his word and that
[1:46:45] keeps all the termites out you know so
[1:46:48] the church can grow
[1:46:49] the plant and god knows what it takes to
[1:46:52] do it
[1:46:53] well you say it's just like a little
[1:46:55] baby crying
[1:46:56] for your razor when you were shaving and
[1:46:59] you little babies told her
[1:47:00] give me that razor daddy give me that
[1:47:02] razor your little son two three years
[1:47:03] old
[1:47:04] just screaming jumping up and down the
[1:47:05] floor give the razor you know better to
[1:47:07] do that
[1:47:09] or you wouldn't give that baby that
[1:47:10] razor he doesn't know how to handle it
[1:47:12] that's the reason we don't find them or
[1:47:13] divine gifts and what we do
[1:47:15] they push off on some kind of tradition
[1:47:18] over some denomination
[1:47:19] they don't know how to handle it god
[1:47:21] knows what to do
[1:47:22] or you might say the little boy might
[1:47:24] say to you you refusing to raise and say
[1:47:26] i see you hand on the daddy but see
[1:47:28] you're older you know what to do with it
[1:47:30] that's the way when the church becomes
[1:47:32] from a little baby
[1:47:34] toddling around to a real virtue of sons
[1:47:37] and daughters of god
[1:47:38] then things are going to be different
[1:47:41] yes sir the church already acts in the
[1:47:43] sons and daughters
[1:47:44] when we already be teachers we have to
[1:47:46] be taught reminds me of my colored
[1:47:48] friends here tonight my brothers and
[1:47:49] sisters will excuse this expression
[1:47:51] years ago down the south he used to sell
[1:47:54] uh people when the slavery was going on
[1:47:56] down in the south and they took those
[1:47:58] poor people and would take them out and
[1:48:01] auction them off like some kind of a
[1:48:02] used cloth you have a bill of sales a
[1:48:05] human life it
[1:48:06] never was god's will to have no manual
[1:48:08] over another
[1:48:10] man god made man and man made slaves
[1:48:14] we're all off the same tree one can give
[1:48:16] the other blood transfusions
[1:48:17] whether we're yellow black brown red or
[1:48:20] whatever we are
[1:48:21] we're all adam's race the country we
[1:48:24] lived into it changed our colors has
[1:48:26] nothing to do with it not at all jesus
[1:48:28] died to save the sinner
[1:48:29] no matter who it was and it used to
[1:48:33] be a broker's team combined would buy
[1:48:35] them people
[1:48:36] just like you'd buy a car come by and
[1:48:39] buy so many used cars take it sell it
[1:48:41] somewhere else and
[1:48:42] come with the plantations and find these
[1:48:44] poor people out there and look around
[1:48:45] and find out
[1:48:46] which one was good workers and big
[1:48:47] strong men and women and they would
[1:48:50] sell them take the big strong man and
[1:48:52] breed them to big strong women like you
[1:48:54] would cattle or something to get a
[1:48:55] bigger head is slave i wonder what he'll
[1:48:57] be full of that kind
[1:48:59] that a thing like that and here there
[1:49:01] was a little mother with her babies
[1:49:02] trying her husband
[1:49:03] auctioned off it was terrible then the
[1:49:05] first thing you know
[1:49:06] these one broker came by a plantation it
[1:49:08] was told one day
[1:49:09] and he was looking over the slaves he
[1:49:11] said how many you got said oh
[1:49:13] we got about 200 out there and so uh
[1:49:16] he watched me the people were sad they
[1:49:18] were away from their home their loved
[1:49:19] ones they were brought from africa here
[1:49:21] and
[1:49:22] brought in by the borders and seoul down
[1:49:24] here in the south
[1:49:25] and um they they know they never go back
[1:49:27] home
[1:49:28] they they were finished they never get
[1:49:30] to go back and they were sad
[1:49:32] you know they couldn't make them work
[1:49:33] harder they did they'd have to whip them
[1:49:35] and everything else to make them work
[1:49:37] because they know they'd never
[1:49:38] get back home their daddy was over there
[1:49:40] maybe mother here
[1:49:42] and daddy over there and maybe the
[1:49:44] children here and their father somewhere
[1:49:45] oh it's terrible
[1:49:47] and one day this broker came by and
[1:49:49] looked into this bunch of slaves
[1:49:50] and he noticed there's one of those
[1:49:52] young slaves out there that they didn't
[1:49:54] have to whip him
[1:49:56] yeah he's chest out he walked around
[1:49:59] he was right on the spot and the broker
[1:50:02] said say
[1:50:03] i want about that one the owner said but
[1:50:06] he's not for sale
[1:50:08] so why so i keep him he said
[1:50:11] he must be the boss or the rest of him
[1:50:14] and said no
[1:50:15] he ain't the boss or said maybe you feed
[1:50:17] him better said no they all eat out
[1:50:19] there in the galley together
[1:50:21] he said well what makes him so much
[1:50:23] different from the rest of the slaves
[1:50:24] he said i often wanted that myself to
[1:50:26] one day i found out
[1:50:28] that over in a homeland where he come
[1:50:30] from his father
[1:50:31] is a king of the tribe and though he's a
[1:50:34] native
[1:50:35] he still knows he's a king son he
[1:50:38] conducts himself like one
[1:50:40] oh if we are the sons and daughters of
[1:50:43] the king
[1:50:44] the king of pain let's uh conduct our
[1:50:47] characters christians yes
[1:50:51] we are aliens we're pilgrims and we're
[1:50:53] strangers here this is not
[1:50:54] our world we are seeking a kingdom that
[1:50:57] is to come
[1:50:58] this is not our home though we be tossed
[1:51:00] about and made fun of by the world and
[1:51:02] call this that neither an old fashioned
[1:51:04] and
[1:51:05] all like that why do you care you don't
[1:51:07] want to be a pattern yourself after a
[1:51:09] some kind of a movie star or some
[1:51:10] television star or something you're a
[1:51:12] daughter of
[1:51:13] [Music]
[1:51:19] that we're god sons and daughters of the
[1:51:21] king
[1:51:22] our character reflects his presence
[1:51:30] there are buildings over there
[1:51:36] his partners are full he has riches
[1:51:38] untold
[1:51:40] we're the children of the king with
[1:51:42] jesus our savior
[1:51:45] i'm a child of the king let's conduct
[1:51:48] ourselves like our father
[1:51:50] going someday we will go home to be with
[1:51:52] him
[1:51:53] yes yes they they want a messiah but
[1:51:56] they want it under their own conditions
[1:51:58] yeah they want a savior
[1:52:00] they didn't want it now the same way for
[1:52:02] the same reason
[1:52:04] for the denominations and politics has
[1:52:07] taken the place of the
[1:52:08] holy spirit the ministers instead of
[1:52:11] being too many of them are
[1:52:12] led by the religious politics instead of
[1:52:16] letting the holy spirit lead them
[1:52:18] see some church will give them a little
[1:52:19] better offering or something other way
[1:52:21] they go to get a feather and a head or
[1:52:23] something like that
[1:52:24] but that's too bad lord be led by the
[1:52:27] holy spirit
[1:52:28] god sent the real leader of the church
[1:52:32] and that's the holy ghost
[1:52:33] our educational system in our churches
[1:52:36] has led us far
[1:52:38] away from the presence of god it's too
[1:52:40] bad that we
[1:52:41] put our boys i'm talking to pentecostals
[1:52:44] now
[1:52:44] how into the seminaries and things hatch
[1:52:46] them out like ecuador chickens
[1:52:48] that's right always felt sorry for an
[1:52:51] incubator chicken
[1:52:52] it was uh wasn't a hatch right he chirps
[1:52:55] me ain't got no money to go to
[1:52:57] just turned out about a big machine or a
[1:52:59] regime that's why they seem to be
[1:53:01] turning out preachers today with some
[1:53:02] kind of
[1:53:03] doctor's degree and send him into a
[1:53:04] church and sometimes he knows more about
[1:53:06] god than a hot and talk will know about
[1:53:08] an egyptian knight all we need is a good
[1:53:10] old-fashioned
[1:53:14] the holy ghost back into the church
[1:53:16] again of cleaning out
[1:53:18] gun barrel straight sky blue religion we
[1:53:21] need a cleaning out and starting over
[1:53:23] again that's the truth church i'm not
[1:53:25] beside myself
[1:53:26] i may be mad as i said last night but i
[1:53:29] feel good this way i never did feel this
[1:53:31] way the other way so
[1:53:32] i i just like to stay this way yes sir i
[1:53:35] did lose my mind i had you to find the
[1:53:37] mind of christ every other believer
[1:53:44] the educational system has taken this
[1:53:45] away i live in a college town
[1:53:48] where the university of arizona is there
[1:53:51] and i
[1:53:51] was saying thinking this what can
[1:53:54] science do for you
[1:53:56] they could take something and say this
[1:53:57] was so many hundred years ago
[1:53:59] now they found out it wasn't so many
[1:54:01] hundred years ago they haven't got one
[1:54:03] thing yet
[1:54:03] scientifically proven that the world has
[1:54:06] ever had any life on
[1:54:07] any more than 6 000 years they pick up
[1:54:09] bones and they used to take
[1:54:11] different measurements and say i was now
[1:54:13] they wouldn't confess it a big professor
[1:54:14] and i stood up there in arizona
[1:54:16] and said they won't profess it no but
[1:54:18] they found out that the age of the bone
[1:54:20] has been because of the chloride
[1:54:22] itself in the water and also the salt
[1:54:24] turned it like at an agent it absolutely
[1:54:26] wasn't time to done it
[1:54:28] hey man god's word still worry me
[1:54:32] yesterday brother they could never be
[1:54:34] able to disprove it that's the
[1:54:36] thing that'll hold the world together
[1:54:37] not an educational system
[1:54:39] anything that you adopt instead that is
[1:54:40] an antichrist movement
[1:54:42] it's exactly right it's against the
[1:54:43] principles of christ back to the word
[1:54:46] christ is the word the word
[1:54:49] made flesh and dwell among us education
[1:54:52] can never give us life education can
[1:54:56] never
[1:54:56] science can't give us life the world
[1:54:59] can't give us life
[1:55:00] the church can't give us life theology
[1:55:03] can't give us
[1:55:04] life there's only one thing to give you
[1:55:06] life
[1:55:07] that's christ he is life
[1:55:10] he is
[1:55:13] some time ago in a city in canada i was
[1:55:16] going up on an elevator

[1:55:19] americans up there and it was it was
[1:55:21] some kind of a meeting i won't call

[1:55:24] someone in a certain lodge in here and i
[1:55:25] wouldn't hurt your feelings
[1:55:27] but there was going up on the the uh the
[1:55:29] elevator in a big

[1:55:47] the of the stage or the
[1:55:49] little escalator elevator rather it

[1:55:55] there with just their underneath
[1:55:56] garmadon
[1:55:57] they had a bottle of whiskey in their
[1:55:59] hand and they were drinking
[1:56:01] and they started down and drunk man
[1:56:03] coming out of the house so drunk or the
[1:56:04] little rooms trying to
[1:56:05] catch them and pulling their clothes
[1:56:07] down and it was horrible looking
[1:56:09] and they come down and i just dug back
[1:56:11] in a little hall and waited until they
[1:56:12] passed by a little door
[1:56:14] and they stopped in front of me and nice
[1:56:16] looking women
[1:56:17] and they were standing there just with
[1:56:19] their little underneath skirt on all the
[1:56:21] clothes they had
[1:56:22] they took this bottle and tried to pour
[1:56:23] it on one another one pulled up or
[1:56:25] underneath garment as high as she could
[1:56:26] pull it
[1:56:27] through her leg up in the air whoopee
[1:56:30] this is life
[1:56:31] i couldn't stand the war of it i stepped
[1:56:33] out i said sister i beg your pardon
[1:56:35] that's death
[1:56:37] that's death she said i'm have a dream
[1:56:41] and i said wait just a minute
[1:56:43] i said you said that was life i said
[1:56:45] that's for very life
[1:56:46] why do you try to do a thing like that
[1:56:49] come to find out
[1:56:50] i said i am a minister of the gospel
[1:56:53] i'm an american too now i'm ashamed of
[1:56:56] you
[1:56:56] i'm ashamed of you to call yourself an
[1:56:59] american and up here like that
[1:57:01] come to find out one of them was a
[1:57:02] sunday school teacher
[1:57:04] and she started crying first she started
[1:57:06] running i grabbed both of the hands to
[1:57:08] drink they couldn't get away
[1:57:09] i said wait we're gonna pray right here
[1:57:13] that is the way it seems right well they
[1:57:15] say they're just having a little clean
[1:57:17] fun
[1:57:18] a little clean fun nothing that thing
[1:57:20] doesn't i don't care how much sunday
[1:57:21] school teacher you are if that thing's
[1:57:23] in your heart
[1:57:24] god can't dwell in that unclean place
[1:57:26] what we need is an old christian whole
[1:57:28] industry behind going to sweep the
[1:57:29] church
[1:57:30] from one end to the other yes sir we
[1:57:32] don't do that
[1:57:34] that should not be permitted but it's
[1:57:36] americans having a little clean fund
[1:57:38] set an example as a christian nation
[1:57:40] whole my
[1:57:41] educational system that isn't life
[1:57:43] that's death
[1:57:44] what makes a person do that why do they
[1:57:47] do it
[1:57:48] what makes the world do the way they do
[1:57:50] because they reject this
[1:57:52] there's some little place in a man's
[1:57:54] heart to thirst for god
[1:57:57] a little place a man has made the thirst
[1:58:00] you're set up like that that's what
[1:58:02] makes you drink
[1:58:03] that's what makes you do these things is
[1:58:05] because there's something in you that
[1:58:08] craves
[1:58:09] for satisfaction thirsting
[1:58:13] and god forbid that a man will try to
[1:58:16] satisfy and crush that holy cow of god
[1:58:20] with the substitute that the devil would
[1:58:22] give him
[1:58:24] you have no right to do that that's god
[1:58:26] calling to you
[1:58:28] that stuff is a thirst of death and if
[1:58:30] you won't take christ in there to fill
[1:58:31] it up the devil will give you a
[1:58:33] substitute of death in it
[1:58:35] so right you have no right to do that
[1:58:37] how dare any man or woman
[1:58:39] to hush that holy calling out of god
[1:58:42] calling and because you won't receive it
[1:58:44] then the devil will see it satisfied
[1:58:45] with something else
[1:58:47] that's what satisfies it god's word i've
[1:58:49] hid in my heart not a sin not against
[1:58:51] him
[1:58:52] that's right god in the heart is what
[1:58:54] settles the question
[1:58:56] yes sir science can't give you life
[1:58:58] education can't give you life
[1:58:59] denomination can't give you life schools
[1:59:01] can't give you life
[1:59:02] nation can't give you life church can't
[1:59:04] give you life it's only
[1:59:06] god to give you life he's the only one
[1:59:08] that can do it
[1:59:10] now we see in chapter that what the
[1:59:12] prophet said would come to pass in this
[1:59:14] day
[1:59:15] the prophet paul and ii timothy 3
[1:59:18] we find out that the time was coming
[1:59:20] when the church would be
[1:59:21] heady high-minded overall
[1:59:25] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[1:59:27] lovers of god
[1:59:29] truce breakers false accusers
[1:59:31] incontinent and despisers of those that
[1:59:33] are good
[1:59:34] you say that's communists not all let's
[1:59:36] profess christians listen
[1:59:37] read the next verse having a form of
[1:59:39] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:59:42] from
[1:59:44] [Applause]
[1:59:48] the power of the resurrection denying
[1:59:50] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:59:52] today and forever
[1:59:54] right he is the same yesterday and
[1:59:56] forever
[1:59:57] peter said on the day of pentecost the
[1:59:59] promise isn't to you
[2:00:00] and to your children and to them it's
[2:00:02] far off even as many as the lord our god
[2:00:04] shall call
[2:00:05] that's what the holy ghost for as long
[2:00:06] as god still calls the holy ghost is
[2:00:08] still
[2:00:09] here to fill every hungry heart that god
[2:00:11] called
[2:00:12] but we substitute something else we try
[2:00:14] to satisfy that
[2:00:16] feeling by joining church you just
[2:00:19] deaden that feeling by doing that
[2:00:21] you ain't satisfied with that that won't
[2:00:23] satisfy there's only one thing you'll
[2:00:25] satisfy that's when christ comes into a
[2:00:27] man's life
[2:00:28] because he's made in the image of god
[2:00:30] and he's made in the statue of god and
[2:00:31] god
[2:00:32] didn't give you this trip here on earth
[2:00:35] to be this side of the other but be a
[2:00:36] son and daughter of god
[2:00:38] and there's nothing else to satisfy
[2:00:40] that's the only thing we'll hold our
[2:00:42] our world together and take not our
[2:00:45] man-made economy but take god's economy
[2:00:47] and his way of doing it through his word
[2:00:50] that'll hold it together that's a pile
[2:00:52] that binds our hearts and christian love
[2:00:54] the fellowship of kindred mind is back
[2:00:56] to that above
[2:00:57] that's right what the world needs today
[2:01:00] the good old times
[2:01:01] saint paul's revival in the bible holy
[2:01:03] ghost back again
[2:01:05] where the spirit of god falls amongst
[2:01:07] the people and signs and wonders appear
[2:01:09] like sparks all from an anvil that's
[2:01:11] where we need it
[2:01:12] that's what we have to have to hold
[2:01:14] together then
[2:01:15] we expect god to meet us in our
[2:01:17] traditions
[2:01:18] oh to keep the world from falling apart
[2:01:21] we expect him to come to our system
[2:01:23] that's exactly what they thought back
[2:01:25] there now if the messiah comes in this
[2:01:27] age we gotta find high priest campuses
[2:01:29] we got uh lebinsky all these priests
[2:01:32] along here and see
[2:01:33] fine man we schooled him schooled and
[2:01:35] they know what they're talking about
[2:01:37] but when he come he bypassed every one
[2:01:39] of us
[2:01:41] he didn't even touch their system
[2:01:44] besides that he said you're of your
[2:01:45] father the devil in his works you do
[2:01:48] you generation snakes in the grass he
[2:01:50] said who's wanted you to flee the wrath
[2:01:52] that is to come
[2:01:53] what's the word of god come out in that
[2:01:55] review oh it certainly didn't meet their
[2:01:57] theological test
[2:01:58] and it wouldn't today either it doesn't
[2:02:01] when they see him standing and perform
[2:02:02] the son of the prophet to show that he
[2:02:04] was messiah
[2:02:05] what do they say he's the elder about
[2:02:06] that's the evil spirit and jesus said
[2:02:08] that's blasphemy and when the holy ghost
[2:02:10] comes and you speak against that it'll
[2:02:12] never be forgiven in this world the
[2:02:13] world economy
[2:02:14] but you see the system today it's the
[2:02:16] same thing we formed our own system
[2:02:19] that's the reason our system
[2:02:20] will never hold this world together they
[2:02:22] might elect the president or
[2:02:24] abraham lincoln and every county in the
[2:02:26] united states and they'll never hold it
[2:02:27] together until we get
[2:02:28] back to the word of god back to the old
[2:02:31] fashioned black back bibles got the
[2:02:32] truth
[2:02:33] that's the only way we'll ever know god
[2:02:35] and keep our world together
[2:02:36] is back to the principles of jesus
[2:02:38] christ back to his doctrine back
[2:02:40] to the holy ghost again leading the
[2:02:41] church
[2:02:43] that's why the truth has been so
[2:02:45] mishandled in this last days
[2:02:46] is because when the god trying to get
[2:02:49] his program in
[2:02:50] and people have already denominated
[2:02:52] themselves off and such
[2:02:53] they build up a fence so that the holy
[2:02:55] spirit can't get in there
[2:02:57] keeping him out we want god to save us
[2:03:00] in the the very condition we're in
[2:03:04] that's the way that i think you
[2:03:05] pentecostal people what did you start
[2:03:07] out at did you ever read the zeus street
[2:03:09] in mission do you ever read before the
[2:03:11] general counsel ever started
[2:03:12] the pentecostal people were known
[2:03:14] because they come out of those
[2:03:15] denominations that
[2:03:16] separated that's what they was come out
[2:03:19] from among them
[2:03:20] they used to preach that all time be
[2:03:22] separated saith god
[2:03:23] get away from them traditions of man and
[2:03:25] what did he do he turned right back
[2:03:27] around and went back in the same garm
[2:03:29] you come out of
[2:03:30] now you're separated one's a church of
[2:03:32] god the other into this and that and
[2:03:33] this that
[2:03:34] you're separating fussing with one
[2:03:35] another break that down when i first
[2:03:38] come in
[2:03:38] to the ministry i thought everything was
[2:03:40] pentecostal one group i come to find out
[2:03:42] this broke up as bad as the baptist
[2:03:44] the thing i did is stand right in the
[2:03:46] middle of both of them say we are
[2:03:47] brothers that's all
[2:03:49] but as long as you're firing one another
[2:03:51] satan don't have to fire at you
[2:03:52] but unless that bound to be broke and
[2:03:55] spread forth your tents way out the
[2:03:57] undertaking every brother
[2:03:58] then i tell the great army of god arise
[2:04:00] in the power of jesus christ
[2:04:02] go back to the bible you talk about our
[2:04:04] church through
[2:04:05] rights and grief it would come to pass
[2:04:08] when we can tear down our traditions
[2:04:09] forget all of our denominational things
[2:04:11] and come right back on the
[2:04:12] basis of god's word but we want god to
[2:04:14] save us in the condition we are
[2:04:16] we got to meet his condition if we don't
[2:04:19] we don't meet us on ours
[2:04:20] upon his we want god to save us in the
[2:04:22] very thing that
[2:04:24] uh that if it's polluted let god
[2:04:27] get back to the word and love one
[2:04:29] another that's the only thing that i
[2:04:30] know to do
[2:04:31] god sends us prophets and when we uh put
[2:04:34] them to death just exactly like jesus
[2:04:36] said they would do then
[2:04:38] we found out after a century or two
[2:04:42] or 100 years or 50 years god will send
[2:04:45] us a prophet or
[2:04:45] a messenger and um first thing you know
[2:04:48] we'll
[2:04:49] criticize him putting to death then
[2:04:51] after a while after his death you know
[2:04:53] why the church will wake up what do they
[2:04:55] do they'll say well we'll build a
[2:04:57] denomination up on that
[2:04:59] that's what happened to the methodist
[2:05:00] baptist and all the rest of you
[2:05:02] build a denomination and the thing is
[2:05:04] after he's done dead and his message is
[2:05:06] over
[2:05:06] we're going to let him go into another
[2:05:08] place then you go back to his message
[2:05:10] you're that dead you're trying to go
[2:05:11] back there
[2:05:11] and go in his hands too when he is going
[2:05:14] on right here all the time
[2:05:16] you forget the hour just like man man's
[2:05:19] always praising god for what he did do
[2:05:22] and praise him or what he will do and
[2:05:24] ignoring what he's doing
[2:05:25] that's that's just a way of man he's
[2:05:27] always done that he thinks of what he
[2:05:29] has done gives him thanks
[2:05:30] believe he's going to do something like
[2:05:32] but forget he's doing it all the time
[2:05:34] right here
[2:05:35] he always overlooks it that's the
[2:05:37] devil's business for him
[2:05:38] to do it that way yes there are
[2:05:40] traditions
[2:05:42] yes sir the messiah he says for another
[2:05:46] generation something like that he was
[2:05:48] back there he is the same yesterday and
[2:05:49] forever
[2:05:51] in his first advent jesus the whole
[2:05:54] world was corrupted with politics and
[2:05:55] religions always crying for a messiah
[2:05:58] they wanted an anointed one israel
[2:06:00] wanted something and rome wanted
[2:06:01] something
[2:06:02] the rest of them it's the same thing
[2:06:03] today we all each one want
[2:06:06] a politician we want something today now
[2:06:09] today russia wants a messiah
[2:06:13] russia wants a messiah that'll take him
[2:06:14] to the moon right quick

[2:06:58] that's right the world wants that's what
[2:07:01] it wants
[2:07:02] now what you're going to do with it you
[2:07:04] want to show how smart you are you can
[2:07:06] put them on
[2:07:07] television to show that one can outsmart

[2:07:21] you're wanting a smart educated
[2:07:23] intellectual minister
[2:07:24] to raise up like a conqueror better than
[2:07:26] billy graham
[2:07:27] to take them all back to your
[2:07:29] denomination you've got similarities and
[2:07:31] things trying to hatch them out
[2:07:33] you're trying to think that's true but
[2:07:36] look
[2:07:36] your action speaks louder
[2:07:41] you want a religious genius one who can
[2:07:44] uh
[2:07:44] lead you your denomination over them all
[2:07:47] stop
[2:07:47] out the bad just stomp out the method to
[2:07:49] stop out the one to stop out the trinity
[2:07:51] everything walk over all
[2:07:55] [Applause]
[2:07:57] that's the kind you want but you know
[2:07:59] what you need you need a savior just in
[2:08:00] fact
[2:08:02] that's what god knows you need as a
[2:08:04] savior
[2:08:07] but do they want it no sir that don't
[2:08:09] beat their
[2:08:10] fit their ecclesiastical taste it just
[2:08:13] doesn't work that way with them
[2:08:14] but the whole world wants their genius
[2:08:17] now what if russia got their messiah
[2:08:22] then what about us you know germany got
[2:08:25] theirs not long ago and many you boys in
[2:08:26] the first world war remembers that very
[2:08:28] well
[2:08:29] see they got it you don't need that kind
[2:08:32] of a messiah
[2:08:33] it was in the wrong way it was the wrong
[2:08:34] thing it was contrary to god's word
[2:08:37] just think napoleon at the age of 33
[2:08:41] he had conquered the world and died in
[2:08:43] defeat
[2:08:45] he died in the feet he was a probitious
[2:08:47] when he first raised up
[2:08:48] and his great uh success brought him and
[2:08:51] he died an alcoholic
[2:08:53] seven thousand prostitutes found his
[2:08:54] army
[2:08:56] he died at 33 years old and he
[2:08:59] tried to conquer the world but he did it
[2:09:02] the wrong way
[2:09:03] but jesus christ at the age of 33
[2:09:06] had conquered the world death held
[2:09:08] racism
[2:09:12] he was the word of god made manifest
[2:09:15] that's our messiah amen
[2:09:19] [Music]
[2:09:20] sure you always we want to we want a
[2:09:22] messiah but we want it in the way i have
[2:09:24] to admit some things that god wrote down
[2:09:25] now we're getting too late
[2:09:27] we uh we have to admit some of it but
[2:09:29] the world wants
[2:09:30] monster messiah the world wants one the
[2:09:33] church wants one
[2:09:35] and what have found santa juan if god
[2:09:38] sent a messiah
[2:09:39] what would he be he would not be a
[2:09:41] religious politician
[2:09:43] [Music]
[2:09:45] he would not be an intellectual giant as
[2:09:47] we call it
[2:09:48] oh no what would he be he'd be like
[2:09:51] hebrews 13 8
[2:09:52] the same that he was he's always been
[2:09:55] he'd be the word of god
[2:10:00] he was god's word he is god's word he'll
[2:10:03] forever be god's word
[2:10:06] even though the sounding force of his
[2:10:07] coming was always a prophet see the word
[2:10:09] came to you
[2:10:10] hear the word come in fullness and now
[2:10:12] if they come again today it would be a
[2:10:14] word of god
[2:10:16] manifested word of god dedicated word of
[2:10:19] god
[2:10:20] god living aloneness that's the messiah
[2:10:24] he promised it amen
[2:10:27] you'd be that pillar of fire again you'd
[2:10:29] be the same aside of that israel
[2:10:35] [Music]
[2:10:38] then turn it down like they always did
[2:10:40] certainly of course they want to build a
[2:10:43] great nation
[2:10:44] we want to build a great church body
[2:10:46] today we are thinking about
[2:10:48] we want a great general church all right
[2:10:51] you're going to get it
[2:10:52] you want a united church you're going to
[2:10:54] get it you're going to get
[2:10:56] it why do they want it like that if
[2:10:58] messiah would come he never said
[2:10:59] something like that in order
[2:11:00] he'd be against it sure he would but
[2:11:03] what do they want it for what's the
[2:11:04] reason
[2:11:05] he has to come that way they want one
[2:11:08] man that can stand up and dictate the
[2:11:10] whole thing you're going to get it
[2:11:12] the doctor you will receive him because
[2:11:15] he's coming
[2:11:17] another will come and you will receive
[2:11:19] him jesus said and they will
[2:11:21] they will receive him why do they want
[2:11:22] to do that people are
[2:11:24] lying to things their own way the
[2:11:27] messiah would come
[2:11:28] he just shut the feathers off of you
[2:11:30] hallelujah
[2:11:31] talk about some preachers skinning down
[2:11:33] women and man he would really skin him
[2:11:35] down
[2:11:36] he did what he come he said you
[2:11:37] generation of pipers
[2:11:39] you snitched to the grass you're you're
[2:11:41] a pile of the devil if that messiah
[2:11:43] would return to this fluted time you'd
[2:11:45] do the same thing again
[2:11:48] god wouldn't vindicate his work just
[2:11:50] like you did in the beginning with the
[2:11:51] same kind of signs and wonder
[2:11:53] you certainly would do it if he returned
[2:11:56] again if we got that messiah
[2:11:57] just like he wasn't the first time
[2:11:58] because it couldn't be nothing else
[2:12:00] the bible said he's the same yesterday
[2:12:03] today and forever
[2:12:04] he's always the word but what do we want
[2:12:07] we wouldn't want that kind of messiah
[2:12:08] no no we want to be something like the
[2:12:10] world what the
[2:12:12] people are trying to do they want a
[2:12:13] messiah that'll let them
[2:12:15] live and and do anything they want to
[2:12:17] and act like the world and
[2:12:19] live in the world and still hold that
[2:12:21] christian profession
[2:12:21] [Music]
[2:12:23] you can't do that if you love the world
[2:12:25] or the things of the world the love of
[2:12:27] god's writing in you jesus
[2:12:30] yes sir but that's kind of messiah the
[2:12:32] world wants that's reason won't receive
[2:12:34] god's himself
[2:12:35] it won't do it this is his messiah
[2:12:39] exactly his word is his messiah that
[2:12:42] messiah
[2:12:42] in you does the works that the word says
[2:12:44] it does it reproduces christ
[2:12:47] because christ is in you his life is in
[2:12:49] you and it does just exactly what
[2:12:51] he's supposed to do like he always did
[2:12:54] same way he did at the same things that
[2:12:56] he did
[2:12:56] because he is the same that's the
[2:12:58] messiah that god said
[2:13:00] the of the world wants to just let them
[2:13:02] do anything they want to get by oh

[2:13:19] right i'm not taught in politics i'm
[2:13:21] talking truth
[2:13:22] and you know this nation is just exactly
[2:13:24] like israel
[2:13:26] they've done the same thing israel come
[2:13:28] in and drove the occupants
[2:13:30] out of that nation and tuck it god gave
[2:13:33] it to him and what did he do
[2:13:34] they drove out the occupants of the
[2:13:35] nation and took him first they had great
[2:13:38] kings

[2:13:45] and he married jezebel and she was one
[2:13:48] of these little
[2:13:48] painted face flappers and when he did
[2:13:51] she was the one controlling
[2:13:53] she told him what to do he might have
[2:13:55] been the head but she was the neck
[2:13:56] and she told him what to do if this
[2:13:58] nation hasn't done the very same thing

[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:56] is
[2:20:59] [Music]
[2:21:10] i was i checked online
[2:21:13] some service that a brother had a large
[2:21:15] church
[2:21:16] and everybody every one in the
[2:21:18] congregation i think had a
[2:21:21] mask on but he didn't
[2:21:24] of course he was further away from them
[2:21:27] standing in the pulpit ministering the
[2:21:28] word so praise the lord
[2:21:31] thank god for his word amen
[2:21:35] and again this world is
[2:21:38] falling apart it's been falling apart
[2:21:41] for quite a while
[2:21:43] in all the inventions of man in the in
[2:21:46] the century that we're living in
[2:21:48] but we give god the glory for giving us
[2:21:51] the revelation of the messiah the
[2:21:54] revealed word
[2:21:55] amen he was the revealed word two
[2:21:57] thousand years ago he used to reveal the
[2:21:59] word now
[2:22:00] and he's been he's been the word
[2:22:02] revealing himself through the prophets
[2:22:03] to israel
[2:22:04] and and he continues to be the word the
[2:22:06] messiah revealing himself through the
[2:22:08] through the messengers
[2:22:09] down through the ages amen and up
[2:22:12] through the ages
[2:22:13] by the grace of god amen well
[2:22:16] or whether martin luther did what he did
[2:22:19] because of the revealed word
[2:22:21] wesley did what he did it was god in him
[2:22:24] moving
[2:22:24] amen moving us on moving us on by the
[2:22:27] grace of god
[2:22:28] and as the prophet has said when when
[2:22:31] that
[2:22:32] brother asked me if the prophet said
[2:22:34] anything about the salvation army
[2:22:37] and so on and i thought for sure he
[2:22:39] would know that because he was
[2:22:41] he was many years older than i was at
[2:22:43] the time
[2:22:44] and we know as the brother branham did
[2:22:47] say the prophet said
[2:22:49] he said that the methodists ordained not
[2:22:52] ordained but
[2:22:52] organized and became denominational so
[2:22:54] quickly
[2:22:55] after wesley passed on that he said that
[2:22:58] god raised up william booth with red
[2:23:00] hot salvation and it was back in that
[2:23:04] day it was red
[2:23:05] hot salvation brother because amen
[2:23:08] what we were did they doing they were
[2:23:10] getting closer to the pentecostal
[2:23:11] revival
[2:23:13] and the prophet said that's why god
[2:23:14] raised them all he sort of bridged the
[2:23:16] gap
[2:23:17] between the methodists and the
[2:23:18] pentecostal it was on its way
[2:23:21] but just to take the people on he raised
[2:23:24] up william booth
[2:23:25] and it was oms tremendous and you know
[2:23:29] i was thinking as he was ministering
[2:23:31] there and
[2:23:32] it came to my my heart my mind and
[2:23:35] concerning the the methodist church we
[2:23:38] understood it to be the united church
[2:23:41] and i remember sister burns testimony
[2:23:45] and she's of course we remember sister
[2:23:48] burns as being a resident of gamble
[2:23:51] and but sister burns
[2:23:54] when she was a young she was i'm not
[2:23:57] sure she was born in gamble or not
[2:23:59] but because that her i believe when
[2:24:00] maybe her mother died
[2:24:03] when she was very young and she was she
[2:24:05] was transferred from gamble
[2:24:07] to a a town in northeast newfoundland
[2:24:10] upon the upon the that part of
[2:24:12] newfoundland
[2:24:14] there and of course that's where brother
[2:24:16] barnes was living at the time
[2:24:17] and sister barnes was explained now that
[2:24:20] even as a
[2:24:21] just a young young girl she went to the
[2:24:23] united church
[2:24:25] or the methodist church and she said
[2:24:27] brother i remember
[2:24:28] she said you know the singing and
[2:24:30] worshiping
[2:24:31] and she said the power was so great
[2:24:34] in the church everybody was experiencing
[2:24:37] it
[2:24:38] and back then they had those those
[2:24:40] lights those lamps
[2:24:42] they were lamps that you would like not
[2:24:43] not electric but they were light and
[2:24:45] they're
[2:24:46] hung on from the ceiling and i remember
[2:24:49] those
[2:24:49] lamps even in the salvation army it was
[2:24:51] a long time ago
[2:24:53] amen that i remember that and sister
[2:24:56] barnes said as we worshiped and we
[2:24:57] praised the lord
[2:24:58] oh my she did look up and and those
[2:25:00] lamps were
[2:25:01] they were going back and forth back and
[2:25:03] forth he should just go
[2:25:06] nothing nothing standing still she said
[2:25:07] not even the lights
[2:25:09] no she said the power when the anointing
[2:25:12] was so great
[2:25:13] i said it was back in in that church oh
[2:25:15] yes she said
[2:25:16] you know of course it's not like that
[2:25:18] now not not not like that in very many
[2:25:21] many churches for sure
[2:25:22] so we thank god that god was moving er
[2:25:26] on
[2:25:26] god was moving us on and so on so where
[2:25:29] are we going now
[2:25:30] they left to left one to go into another
[2:25:33] into another another revival that god
[2:25:35] was having
[2:25:36] but but now it's over with amen and we
[2:25:39] we entered in by grace through the
[2:25:41] revealed word of a prophet in this hour
[2:25:43] we entered in
[2:25:44] amen to the bride revival and the bride
[2:25:48] revival is going to take us on
[2:25:50] to resurrection and rapture that's the
[2:25:53] end
[2:25:53] it's finished there's nowhere else to go
[2:25:57] the lutheran revival took them on to
[2:25:58] justification the methodist on to
[2:26:01] sanctification
[2:26:02] and the salvation army is the same thing
[2:26:04] pointing to
[2:26:05] the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[2:26:07] gifts of the spirit amen
[2:26:09] so he moved the world onto that and now
[2:26:11] he's moving the bride onto the
[2:26:13] resurrection rapture this
[2:26:14] is finished it's over with we come to
[2:26:17] the end
[2:26:18] so what what is the last thing that god
[2:26:20] would want to do now
[2:26:22] when we consider what god has done in
[2:26:24] the in in in israel
[2:26:26] and through the prophets and so on it
[2:26:28] went on and on and on till it to the
[2:26:30] till the god prophet came on the scene
[2:26:32] the messiah prophet came on the scene
[2:26:34] amen and did what he did for the jews
[2:26:37] but they turned it down
[2:26:39] and they they wouldn't accept it but
[2:26:41] again god god allowed it
[2:26:43] why because he wanted to go from the
[2:26:45] jews to the gentiles
[2:26:47] and when he's finished with us he goes
[2:26:48] back to israel goes back to the jews
[2:26:51] and we know that's what's going on
[2:26:53] there's a lot going on right now brother
[2:26:55] sister
[2:26:55] concerning prophecy end time prophecy
[2:26:59] so i pray grace by the grace of god
[2:27:01] we're not ignoring
[2:27:02] you know what god has done what god is
[2:27:05] doing
[2:27:06] amen and we know what god is doing is
[2:27:09] going to move us on to what he what he
[2:27:10] wants to do
[2:27:11] amen by the grace of god so i pray the
[2:27:14] lord
[2:27:15] that by grace that we're going to keep
[2:27:18] moving
[2:27:19] walking living by faith amen
[2:27:22] let faith that god gives the faith that
[2:27:26] pleases god
[2:27:27] let that motivate our worship amen
[2:27:30] and our hunger and thirst for the things
[2:27:32] of god
[2:27:33] by the grace of god amen
[2:27:37] there's just a few scriptures here
[2:27:41] and it says
[2:27:44] let's see and then said then stood up
[2:27:48] phineas and executed judgment and so
[2:27:51] the plague was stayed and that was
[2:27:53] counted unto him for righteousness
[2:27:55] unto all generations forevermore amen
[2:27:59] amazing why they were they were walking
[2:28:02] in the light of the word
[2:28:03] they were going according to what god
[2:28:04] wanted to do amen
[2:28:07] and they angered him also at the waters
[2:28:10] of strife
[2:28:11] so that it went ill with moses for their
[2:28:13] sakes
[2:28:14] because they provoked his spirit so that
[2:28:17] he spake unadvisedly
[2:28:19] with his lips and god judged israel for
[2:28:22] for doing that
[2:28:23] yeah they were they were pro they were
[2:28:25] provoking
[2:28:26] moses to do this provoking moses to do
[2:28:28] that amen
[2:28:30] most they paid for it but moses had to
[2:28:32] pay for it too
[2:28:34] amen so they did not destroy the nations
[2:28:37] concerning whom the lord commanded them
[2:28:40] yeah
[2:28:41] they wouldn't do what god wanted to do
[2:28:44] but were mingled
[2:28:45] among the heathen and learned their
[2:28:47] works
[2:28:48] and they served their idols which were a
[2:28:50] snare unto them
[2:28:52] yea they sacrificed their sons and their
[2:28:54] daughters unto
[2:28:55] devils and shed innocent blood even in
[2:28:58] the blood of their sons and their
[2:29:00] daughters
[2:29:00] whom they sacrificed unto idols of
[2:29:02] canaan
[2:29:03] and the land was polluted with blood
[2:29:07] thus were they defiled with their own
[2:29:10] works
[2:29:11] and went a whoring with their own
[2:29:13] inventions
[2:29:15] amen and it says therefore was the wrath
[2:29:18] of the lord kindled against his people
[2:29:20] insomuch that he aborted his own
[2:29:22] inheritance and he gave
[2:29:24] them unto into the hand of the heathen
[2:29:27] and they that aided them ruled over them
[2:29:29] and that's what's already
[2:29:31] coming to pass in the world amen the
[2:29:34] christian nation
[2:29:35] coming more and more under the control
[2:29:37] of of the healing world
[2:29:39] god help us and they gave them into the
[2:29:42] hand of the heathen
[2:29:44] and they hated them they that aided them
[2:29:47] rule over them
[2:29:48] and their enemies also oppressed them
[2:29:51] and they were brought
[2:29:52] into subjection under their hand many
[2:29:55] times did he deliver them
[2:29:57] but they provoked him with their counsel
[2:29:59] and were brought
[2:30:00] low for their iniquity nevertheless
[2:30:03] he regarded their affliction when he
[2:30:05] heard their cry
[2:30:07] and he remembered for them his covenant
[2:30:09] and repented
[2:30:10] according to the multitude of his
[2:30:12] mercies i wanted
[2:30:14] to highlight some of those thoughts
[2:30:17] regarding repentance
[2:30:19] because this somebody uh showed me the
[2:30:22] scripture
[2:30:24] after the last service i believe or
[2:30:27] before that
[2:30:28] concerning god repenting god repenting
[2:30:32] god did this and repented god did that
[2:30:34] repent he said god repented
[2:30:36] yeah he did but we want to show you what
[2:30:40] what it means when god repented what it
[2:30:42] means when we repent
[2:30:43] amen because they were wondering if it's
[2:30:46] the same kind of repentance
[2:30:47] no now amen
[2:30:53] and again it says and he gave them into
[2:30:55] the hand of the heathen
[2:30:56] and they hated them ru and they that
[2:30:59] aided them rule over them
[2:31:01] and their enemies also oppressed them
[2:31:03] and they were brought
[2:31:04] into the subjection under their hand and
[2:31:07] many times did he deliver them but they
[2:31:09] provoked him
[2:31:10] with their counsel and were brought low
[2:31:13] for their iniquity
[2:31:15] nevertheless he regarded their
[2:31:17] reflection
[2:31:19] when he heard their cry and he
[2:31:21] remembered for them his covenant
[2:31:23] and repented according to the multitude
[2:31:26] of his
[2:31:26] mercies amen he made them also to be
[2:31:30] pitied
[2:31:31] of all those that carry them captives
[2:31:35] save us o lord our god and gather us
[2:31:38] from among the heathen
[2:31:39] to give thanks unto thy holy name and to
[2:31:43] triumph in thy praise blessed be the
[2:31:46] lord god of israel
[2:31:47] from everlasting to everlasting and let
[2:31:50] all the people say
[2:31:52] amen praise ye the lord
[2:31:57] amen psalms 106.
[2:32:00] it's the long psalms 48 verses amen
[2:32:04] but there's a blessing in it so thank
[2:32:06] the lord
[2:32:07] again for his word and trust him by
[2:32:09] grace that will go forth
[2:32:11] with revelation amen of what god
[2:32:14] is doing amen
[2:32:17] but brother he's allowing it we're here
[2:32:20] he's allowing it to get us to look up
[2:32:23] he's
[2:32:24] allowing this to happen that to happen
[2:32:26] to stir us in our hearts and look up
[2:32:28] because why
[2:32:29] we got to want to go as he said he
[2:32:32] israel had to want to get out
[2:32:34] that's right of egypt and he said i've
[2:32:37] heard the cry of my people
[2:32:39] and he said come down to deliver them
[2:32:41] amen
[2:32:42] so it had the same with the bride you
[2:32:44] want to go so
[2:32:46] he's come down that's what brings god on
[2:32:48] the scene he's responding to
[2:32:50] to us amen and to our cry and our hunger
[2:32:52] and our thirst
[2:32:53] to god be the glory amen
[2:32:57] again the world is falling apart now
[2:33:00] what what testimony is it to us
[2:33:03] the evidence that the world is falling
[2:33:04] apart by the grace of god
[2:33:06] it's evidence that there is there is a
[2:33:08] people there
[2:33:10] calling for the rapture of the
[2:33:11] resurrection amen
[2:33:13] amen and why are we calling for the
[2:33:16] rapture in the resurrection because
[2:33:17] of what we're seeing out there what god
[2:33:20] has done
[2:33:20] and what's going on in the world amen
[2:33:23] what god has done the prophet
[2:33:25] by the grace of god amen we know it's
[2:33:28] the
[2:33:28] the end time we know it's the revelation
[2:33:31] of the mystery of god
[2:33:32] and so on but we know at the same time
[2:33:35] that's grace for the bride but they are
[2:33:38] a judgment for the world
[2:33:40] so i pray grace in the name of jesus oh
[2:33:42] my what a sermon
[2:33:44] what an anointing was i'm the prophet
[2:33:45] back then
[2:33:47] amen but that that was that was moving
[2:33:50] away
[2:33:51] more and more and more it was in 1963
[2:33:54] july
[2:33:55] and it was after the opening of the word
[2:33:57] the mystery of god
[2:34:00] and we know that the problem of god when
[2:34:02] when he
[2:34:03] as he began to minister in 63 he was
[2:34:05] getting closer
[2:34:06] november the 15th not july it's november
[2:34:09] 1963
[2:34:11] amen and as i've mentioned before let me
[2:34:13] say it again
[2:34:14] that after the after they opened the
[2:34:16] seals
[2:34:17] and the prophet went on and ministered
[2:34:19] and ministered and ministered
[2:34:21] unto finally in december 1963
[2:34:24] he said here i go he said back into
[2:34:27] evangelism
[2:34:28] amen so he had far as he was concerned
[2:34:32] that the purpose of his ministry was
[2:34:33] fulfilled
[2:34:35] it was he had that first pull he had
[2:34:37] that second pull
[2:34:38] and then god gave them the revelation
[2:34:40] that the opening of the word the third
[2:34:42] poem
[2:34:43] it was finished oh yeah and he felt that
[2:34:46] the anointing was moving away moving
[2:34:47] away moving away
[2:34:49] amen and as he ministered on until
[2:34:52] finally in 1965 i believe he said
[2:34:54] he said oh my everything is a dead thump
[2:34:56] now he said the revival is over
[2:35:00] yeah so he had gone back into evangelism
[2:35:02] and he ministered and ministered and
[2:35:04] ministered
[2:35:05] and thank god for the anointing with him
[2:35:07] there tonight
[2:35:08] one time that was that was in in in
[2:35:11] revivals like the old-fashioned
[2:35:12] salvation army
[2:35:13] that was common the old-fashioned
[2:35:16] pentecost that was common
[2:35:17] oh yeah and the early days of the
[2:35:19] message that was common to worship the
[2:35:21] way that people were worshiping
[2:35:22] responding to the word the way they
[2:35:24] responded to the word amen
[2:35:26] but now it's getting less and less and
[2:35:29] less
[2:35:30] shall the grace that why because the
[2:35:31] bride is getting less
[2:35:33] so the grace of god be with us to follow
[2:35:35] his leadership
[2:35:38] amen lesson
[2:35:41] 463 amen
[2:35:45] i am coming to jesus for rest
