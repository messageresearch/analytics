[1:17:44] there's a third or fourth generation
[1:17:47] that move that came up and what do they
[1:17:49] do instead of moving on they just settle
[1:17:51] down into what they started with oh yeah

[1:20:08] amen for the trumpet shall sound and the
[1:20:12] dead and cry and the dead shall be
[1:20:14] raised incorruptible
[1:20:16] and we shall be changed amen let's
[1:20:21] believe for the change
[1:20:23] brother we thank God for justification
[1:20:26] for sanctification we thank God for the
[1:20:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts
[1:20:30] of the Spirit but brother are we
[1:20:32] believing now for the change
[1:20:34] that's not just keep looking back for
[1:20:36] this and keep focusing on that and keep
[1:20:38] focusing on that just keep focusing on
[1:20:39] let's focus on change
[1:20:41] focus on the resurrection focus on the
[1:20:43] Rapture by the grace of God

[1:20:50] must put on incorruption and this Mortal
[1:20:53] must put on immortality amen that's what
[1:20:56] we're looking for that's what we're
[1:20:58] believing for so when this corruptable
[1:21:01] shall I put on incorruption and this
[1:21:03] Mortal should have put on immortality
[1:21:06] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:21:09] that is written death is swallowed up in
[1:21:12] Victory amen God help us to believe amen
[1:21:16] that what God has done what God is doing
[1:21:18] amen is to give us the victory over
[1:21:21] death
[1:21:24] hell and the grave
[1:21:27] oh death where is thy sting
[1:21:30] and oh grave where is thy victory
[1:21:34] The Sting of death is sin
[1:21:37] and the strength of sin is the law
[1:21:41] but
[1:21:42] thanks be to God which giveth us the
[1:21:45] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ

[1:21:59] resurrection and the rapture
[1:22:02] and he said therefore my beloved
[1:22:04] Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable

[1:22:28] Luke chapter 18.
[1:22:33] we'll read the scriptures and get into
[1:22:34] some thoughts and some
[1:22:37] quotes of the prophet Luke chapter 18.
[1:22:43] thank God for the word
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:48] brother for many many many years the
[1:22:50] man's been oh yeah he's been reading the

[1:22:56] living in the in the Fulfillment of the
[1:22:58] word

[1:23:03] Omega the end there's a beginning

[1:23:10] got the revelation of the end
[1:23:12] amen that we're not looking for more for
[1:23:15] this to happen for this to happen for

[1:23:18] age no no believing that we have come to
[1:23:21] the end of the age for the bride of
[1:23:23] Christ amen but you got to believe it
[1:23:26] I pray Grace we believe it amen
[1:23:31] so in Luke chapter 18.
[1:23:36] and verse 7.
[1:23:40] and he said and shall not God avenge his
[1:23:42] own elect
[1:23:44] which cry day and night unto him
[1:23:48] though he bear long with them
[1:23:52] having to deal the bride the elect of
[1:23:55] God having to deal with sin and unbelief
[1:23:58] yes and then it's to a certain extent
[1:24:00] religion amen for two thousand years
[1:24:04] Grace
[1:24:06] that we're going to stand for the truth
[1:24:09] and brother all down through in every
[1:24:12] age where God has revealed the word man
[1:24:14] has stood for the truth and then man has
[1:24:16] paid the price oh yeah
[1:24:20] so many million have been killed because
[1:24:22] they took their stand for the truth of
[1:24:24] God
[1:24:26] brother let's lay down our lives
[1:24:28] for the truth
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:35] see

[1:25:07] avenge them speedily nevertheless when
[1:25:10] the son of man cometh shall e find faith
[1:25:13] on the Earth
[1:25:15] and it's amazing
[1:25:17] that the brother
[1:25:19] that did this version of the scriptures
[1:25:23] he understood what that Faith was
[1:25:26] he said it's a belief
[1:25:28] in the whole body
[1:25:30] of revealed truth

[1:25:42] that faith that you believe in the whole
[1:25:44] body of revealed truth amen and this is

[1:26:11] find faith on the earth and what is the

[1:26:15] looking for the revelation of the whole
[1:26:18] body of revealed truth because in the
[1:26:21] last days the truth is going to be
[1:26:23] revealed amen that there is a revelation
[1:26:26] that that will bring them on from one
[1:26:28] age to another but finally in the last
[1:26:31] stage there's going to be a revelation
[1:26:32] of the truth for the resurrection and
[1:26:34] for the Rapture amen they believe for

[1:35:28] we're not living for natural things
[1:35:30] we're living for Spiritual amen but
[1:35:33] still there's too many so-called
[1:35:34] Believers that are putting too much
[1:35:35] emphasis on the Natural Things of life
[1:35:37] and they want to do this they want to do
[1:35:39] that they want to succeed here succeed
[1:35:40] there no amen maybe leave this
[1:35:43] impression with here and leave that
[1:35:45] impression somewhere else Amen brother
[1:35:47] we got to impress God
[1:35:49] amen and what the only thing that
[1:35:51] impresses God is your faith
[1:35:53] amen so I pray the grace of God that we
[1:35:56] got the faith that pleases God
[1:35:58] by grace
[1:36:00] to imagine chapter 24 and verse 1.
[1:36:09] and Jesus went out and departed from the
[1:36:11] temple and his disciples came to him for
[1:36:13] to show him the buildings of the Temple
[1:36:17] and Jesus said unto them see ye not all
[1:36:20] these things verily I say unto you there
[1:36:24] shall not be left here one stone upon
[1:36:27] another that shall not be thrown down
[1:36:30] amen
[1:36:32] and as he said upon the Mount of Olives
[1:36:34] the disciples came unto him privately
[1:36:36] saying tell us when shall these things
[1:36:40] be
[1:36:41] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:36:44] and the end of the world
[1:36:47] and Jesus answered and said
[1:36:53] take heed that no man deceive you
[1:36:56] amen
[1:36:59] for many shall come in my name saying I
[1:37:03] am Christ and shall deceive many
[1:37:07] amen
[1:37:09] that's well that's again the reason why
[1:37:11] he said when the son of man comes will
[1:37:14] he find faith on the Earth amen because
[1:37:18] there's going to be so much deception
[1:37:21] for many shall come in my name in his
[1:37:24] name
[1:37:25] saying I am Christ and shall deceive
[1:37:27] many
[1:37:29] and ye shall hear wars and rumors of
[1:37:31] wars and see that ye be not troubled
[1:37:34] amen for all these things must come to
[1:37:37] pass but the end is not yet
[1:37:40] for a nation shall rise against Nation
[1:37:43] and Kingdom against Kingdom and there
[1:37:46] shall be famines and pestilences and
[1:37:49] earthquakes in diverse places amen all
[1:37:54] these are the beginning of Sorrows how
[1:37:58] bad is the world going to get
[1:38:01] don't pray O Lord
[1:38:04] heal this stop this Lord change this
[1:38:08] make the world better no no
[1:38:10] brother according to the prophecy it's
[1:38:12] going to get worse
[1:38:14] amen that's why we're looking for a new
[1:38:16] Heaven and a new Earth
[1:38:18] amen
[1:38:21] and he said all these are the beginning
[1:38:23] of Sorrows and then shall they deliver
[1:38:25] you up to be afflicted and shall kill
[1:38:27] you and you shall be aided of all
[1:38:29] Nations for my name's sake
[1:38:33] and then shall many be offended and
[1:38:36] shall betray one another and shall hate
[1:38:38] one another
[1:38:39] amazing
[1:38:41] and many false prophets shall rise and
[1:38:44] shall deceive many
[1:38:46] and because iniquity shall abound the
[1:38:49] love of many shall wax cold
[1:38:51] amen
[1:38:53] but he that shall endure unto the end
[1:38:55] the same shall be saved God help us
[1:38:58] Amen to be in the spirit
[1:39:00] and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be
[1:39:02] preached in all the world for a witness
[1:39:04] unto all nations and then shall the End
[1:39:08] come the gospel has been preached around
[1:39:10] the world brother sister
[1:39:12] don't think there was a time when I was
[1:39:15] maybe looking around and concerning what
[1:39:18] was going on religiously around the
[1:39:20] world and I was saying Lord Oh The
[1:39:22] Gospel needs to be preached there the
[1:39:23] gospel needs to be preached there and so
[1:39:25] on but now brother concerning
[1:39:27] considering the technology of the world
[1:39:30] we're in
[1:39:31] brother it's the gospel have been
[1:39:33] preached around the world
[1:39:35] definitely when it comes to the
[1:39:37] television radio now the technology of
[1:39:41] computers and so on and not only that I
[1:39:44] guess some of you may have it there in
[1:39:46] your hand you know just a computer in
[1:39:48] your hand oh yeah and you can talk to
[1:39:51] anybody and around the world or you can
[1:39:53] go and see what was going on around the
[1:39:55] world Amen this is absolutely amazing
[1:39:58] oh brother and the father of God thought
[1:40:01] it was amazing for to be going to listen
[1:40:03] to people going around the world that he
[1:40:06] saw and they were listening to listening
[1:40:07] to the message
[1:40:08] and they just Jesus had a certain thing
[1:40:10] in their hand amen that technology
[1:40:13] wasn't available when the father of God
[1:40:15] was here but God showed it to him by a
[1:40:17] vision oh yeah
[1:40:18] amen when he said when he saw this oh
[1:40:21] yeah and it was in a certain country and
[1:40:23] they were they were and it was the
[1:40:25] message on this in this technology and
[1:40:27] they were listening to the message and
[1:40:29] it's around the world amen
[1:40:33] and even brother sister concerning what
[1:40:35] we have done
[1:40:37] and believing that God did choose us for
[1:40:40] a reason
[1:40:42] because it was
[1:40:46] I could start with brother Mark there
[1:40:48] and it was the church here and the
[1:40:50] Believers here the brothers and sisters
[1:40:51] here that basically started the message
[1:40:54] around the world
[1:40:56] you did oh yeah
[1:40:59] because we went online and and we put
[1:41:01] the message online we were this and this
[1:41:04] and this much of it and it was about two
[1:41:06] years or more before anyone else went
[1:41:09] online
[1:41:10] we were the first online
[1:41:13] with the message of the hour
[1:41:15] amen and I know that even Believers in
[1:41:18] Jeffersonville recognize that Believers
[1:41:20] in other parts of the world recognize
[1:41:22] that amen
[1:41:24] that God God uses for that purpose for
[1:41:26] that reason amen so brother the message
[1:41:29] has gone around the world
[1:41:32] and we've and I've had I've had it
[1:41:35] emails as it were from practically
[1:41:38] around the world
[1:41:40] as a result of the of the technology
[1:41:42] that we put on computers and they're oh
[1:41:45] yes it's absolutely amazing and I don't
[1:41:47] know I surely wouldn't have the time to
[1:41:49] to go and explain all what we've
[1:41:51] experienced and all that we have heard
[1:41:53] and Khan made contact with in the well
[1:41:57] since 1995 when our brother Mark was
[1:41:59] suggesting putting message that message
[1:42:01] on the internet
[1:42:03] I remember our brother taking me into
[1:42:06] his basement there
[1:42:07] and showing the computer and he and he
[1:42:10] searched for the name William Branham
[1:42:12] and there was nothing
[1:42:14] all he found was he found the name
[1:42:16] Branham but I think it was a a sports
[1:42:18] figure
[1:42:19] football or something or base or
[1:42:22] you have something like that and
[1:42:24] football player and that was Branham but
[1:42:28] there was nothing but William Branham
[1:42:29] nothing but the message online
[1:42:32] so and the brother did say he said
[1:42:34] brother would you like to put the
[1:42:35] message online
[1:42:37] I said well I said you let me know how
[1:42:38] much it'll cut costs and I said I'll
[1:42:41] I'll decide
[1:42:43] and he checked it and I said okay we'll
[1:42:45] put it online and so we went online 1995
[1:42:48] I believe yeah
[1:42:51] and it was two years later before
[1:42:53] certain other individuals would go
[1:42:56] online
[1:42:57] we were the first
[1:42:59] so to God be the glory brother the
[1:43:01] message has gone around the world
[1:43:04] amen because as it is written here in
[1:43:08] the scripture amen
[1:43:10] because then then the end is going to
[1:43:12] come
[1:43:13] why because it's been around the world
[1:43:16] amen so brother get ready look up
[1:43:20] our Redemption draweth nigh it's
[1:43:23] finished
[1:43:25] well I think well we got to do this well
[1:43:27] if we evangelize this and evangelize
[1:43:30] that with the prophet of God brother in
[1:43:32] 1963 in December when he when he had
[1:43:35] finished the the revelation of the seals
[1:43:37] and he finished other other mysteries on
[1:43:39] the seals because even after the seals
[1:43:42] in April 63 brother Brown went and
[1:43:45] preached other Mysteries and they said
[1:43:47] now he said this is another revelation
[1:43:48] of this on the seals oh yeah and he
[1:43:51] preached this mystery another revelation
[1:43:53] of the seals unto finally brother at the
[1:43:55] end of 1963 he said now he said here I
[1:43:59] go he said back into evangelism
[1:44:02] yeah
[1:44:04] back into evangelism why because why
[1:44:06] because what God had ordained and
[1:44:08] predestinated for him to do he had done
[1:44:10] amen and now his ministry was to change
[1:44:14] it was it was basically finished and he
[1:44:16] said oh he said you're going to notice
[1:44:17] the difference he said you you'll wonder
[1:44:19] about this and wonder about that and so
[1:44:21] on I got that quote here somewhere and
[1:44:23] we'll I don't know
[1:44:29] he did say to the church the bride he
[1:44:32] said the Rapture is a revelation
[1:44:34] amen
[1:44:36] and he said it's revealed to her that
[1:44:38] the Revelation the true bride of Christ
[1:44:39] will be waiting for that revelation of
[1:44:42] the rapture
[1:44:43] amen so we're going to be focusing on
[1:44:46] the revelation of the Rapture so I pray
[1:44:48] God help us amen
[1:44:50] but again there's other Revelations
[1:44:52] there where the prophet of God said he
[1:44:54] was he was going to move away from this
[1:44:56] move away from that he wasn't going to
[1:44:58] put the answers on this and this now he
[1:45:00] said I'm going back into evangelism that
[1:45:02] was in 1963 and basically it was
[1:45:05] December 63 that he
[1:45:09] that he said he would go back into
[1:45:10] evangelism
[1:45:13] see
[1:45:18] I'm not sure so we'll see
[1:45:21] later
[1:45:23] but let me give you this quote right
[1:45:25] here again was in the message perfect
[1:45:27] faith
[1:45:29] and he said this is coming to that third
[1:45:31] pool
[1:45:32] of his ministry
[1:45:35] 1963 and he said now he said listen he
[1:45:39] said I'm working out something and he
[1:45:41] said it's taking this charge of faith
[1:45:43] and it's going right back to begin and
[1:45:45] come in and he said see to kind of raise
[1:45:48] faith in a bracket where you have never
[1:45:51] noticed it that way before
[1:45:56] so is he raising your faith is God
[1:45:58] raising our faith in a bracket that we
[1:46:00] have never noticed it before
[1:46:03] God help us
[1:46:06] he said not
[1:46:07] not a faith
[1:46:10] he said but perfect faith
[1:46:12] amen that's right perfect faith
[1:46:15] amen you got faith that's good but do
[1:46:19] you have perfect faith
[1:46:21] you may have a perfect faith in
[1:46:23] believing for justification but you have
[1:46:26] the perfect faith that believes Alpha
[1:46:27] and Omega
[1:46:29] beginning and the end
[1:46:31] amen
[1:46:33] there are those that have a perfect
[1:46:35] Faith to believe this to believe that to
[1:46:36] believe that but do you have the perfect
[1:46:39] Faith to believe what God has done what
[1:46:41] God is doing what God will do
[1:46:44] amen the Alpha and the Omega
[1:46:48] not just the perfect faith of the alpha
[1:46:51] but you have the perfect faith of the
[1:46:53] Alpha and Omega
[1:46:55] amen do you have the perfect faith of
[1:46:57] the beginning and the end
[1:47:00] God help us
[1:47:01] amen that we know that God did this and
[1:47:05] God did that and now he's doing this
[1:47:08] it's the plan of God
[1:47:10] amen
[1:47:12] so he said listen
[1:47:13] watch
[1:47:15] he said it is not a faith it is a
[1:47:18] perfect faith
[1:47:19] he said built up in here and he said
[1:47:22] watch a perfect god with a perfect heart
[1:47:26] keep a perfect promise
[1:47:29] by his perfect word
[1:47:32] amen which is sharper than a two-edged
[1:47:35] sword and a discerner of the thoughts of
[1:47:38] the heart
[1:47:40] it wasn't William Brenham it was the
[1:47:42] word
[1:47:44] the word in flesh amen deserting the
[1:47:48] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:47:51] and he said what and he said we are
[1:47:53] coming now to the perfection
[1:47:56] because the people has to come to this
[1:47:58] perfection
[1:48:00] what for
[1:48:02] he said in order for the rapture
[1:48:06] God help us
[1:48:08] brother's not focusing on the Rapture is
[1:48:09] focusing on the Perfection of the
[1:48:11] revelation
[1:48:12] in your heart in your soul in your life
[1:48:16] amen
[1:48:19] he said that's what's holding it away
[1:48:21] right now is waiting for that church to
[1:48:24] come into that perfect raptured faith
[1:48:31] and the ministry of the word is to
[1:48:33] because faith comes by hearing
[1:48:35] the word
[1:48:37] and the ministry as to preach and
[1:48:39] Minister the word to increase our faith
[1:48:42] in the rapture
[1:48:44] to increase our faith in the
[1:48:45] resurrection
[1:48:46] not yesterday today
[1:48:49] oh he did this 2000 years ago he laid
[1:48:53] down his life he picked it up again and
[1:48:54] resurrected it amen that's right what
[1:48:57] about now
[1:49:02] God help us and got out the ministry
[1:49:06] it's like I said when I was visiting
[1:49:08] some brethren and they put on their
[1:49:11] internet and put on a message preacher
[1:49:15] and he would preaching
[1:49:18] Lord
[1:49:20] I said he's not called to preach
[1:49:23] no I felt that
[1:49:25] that particular Minister that particular
[1:49:27] preacher and he's on the internet and no
[1:49:30] doubt there's many many thousands are
[1:49:32] listening to him and I said Lord I said
[1:49:33] sure he's not called to preach I see I
[1:49:35] said I don't even sense that there in in
[1:49:38] in in in in what he's preaching and now
[1:49:40] he's preaching
[1:49:41] I said that's he doesn't have the the
[1:49:43] spirit of that prayer of a Preacher a
[1:49:46] pastor
[1:49:46] ah Lord I said please don't let the
[1:49:49] people be deceived but yet many are
[1:49:51] deceived and are listening to that
[1:49:53] preacher
[1:49:55] and then I went on and
[1:49:57] but they put out another preacher
[1:50:00] and somebody had mentioned to me about
[1:50:02] that preacher you hear this one here
[1:50:03] that one I said
[1:50:05] I wouldn't I heard it I said no
[1:50:09] oh Lord I wasn't doubting a call to
[1:50:12] preach but what he was preaching I said
[1:50:14] it's not giving us resurrection and
[1:50:16] rapturing faith
[1:50:17] I said that's not really the message of
[1:50:20] the hour
[1:50:22] I said God have mercy on us
[1:50:24] brother
[1:50:26] when you leave when you hear a preacher
[1:50:28] you better make sure it's the word that
[1:50:32] you need
[1:50:34] make sure it's the word that God is
[1:50:36] ordained for us to have in these last
[1:50:38] days amen and brother what God has
[1:50:41] ordained for this hour is to give us
[1:50:43] resurrection and rapturing faith
[1:50:46] is to get us out of time and into
[1:50:48] eternity
[1:50:49] let's focus on Amen this focus on
[1:50:51] eternity let's focus on getting out of
[1:50:53] time
[1:50:54] but yet there are those are just they're
[1:50:56] satisfied with this ministry or they're
[1:50:59] going to preach oh they preach this they
[1:51:00] preach that and brother you can preach
[1:51:02] on what's going on out there in the
[1:51:03] world but let's preach on what's going
[1:51:05] on in the bright
[1:51:07] let's focus on what's going on in the
[1:51:08] bride
[1:51:10] as one Minister that somebody was
[1:51:13] showing me and and getting me to listen
[1:51:16] to and he was focusing on what's going
[1:51:18] on that there going on there going on
[1:51:20] there oh it's then it's the end yep
[1:51:23] focused on the bride
[1:51:25] what's going on in the bride
[1:51:28] and then you determine whether it's
[1:51:29] going on in your life
[1:51:34] brother is your life reflecting what
[1:51:36] God's doing
[1:51:38] to get the bride into the resurrection
[1:51:40] and into the rapture

[1:51:47] resurrection of rapture does do you have
[1:51:50] the faith for the resurrection do you

[1:51:56] on us
[1:51:57] and waiting on you
[1:51:59] we better focus on it
[1:52:02] amen
[1:52:05] make sure
[1:52:07] that the preaching of the word is
[1:52:08] bringing us to Resurrection and
[1:52:10] rapturing faith
[1:52:12] amen he said we're coming now to the
[1:52:15] Perfection because the people has to
[1:52:17] come to this in order for the rapture
[1:52:21] what is it what kind of perfection
[1:52:23] oh live a perfect life no you better go
[1:52:27] and live perfect faith
[1:52:29] of what God is doing
[1:52:33] what God has done amen but what God is
[1:52:36] doing
[1:52:37] and that God can use you
[1:52:40] if there's something else he got to do
[1:52:43] Grace
[1:52:46] it is for the rapture
[1:52:50] and he said that's what's holding it
[1:52:52] away right now is waiting for that
[1:52:54] church to come into that perfect
[1:52:55] raptured faith
[1:52:58] and he said I'm looking for it it means
[1:53:00] a lot of shaking down for me it means a
[1:53:03] lot for you but together we'll make it
[1:53:05] by the grace of God Amen so brother is
[1:53:09] God shaking you down
[1:53:11] spiritually
[1:53:12] shaking you yeah
[1:53:15] when it comes to the word
[1:53:17] so that you're focusing more and more
[1:53:19] and more on the resurrection you're
[1:53:21] focusing more and more on the rapture
[1:53:24] Amen brother
[1:53:27] whatever God
[1:53:30] did
[1:53:31] we could see it in the scriptures
[1:53:35] God moved in such a way as to get to get
[1:53:39] his seed focusing on what he was doing
[1:53:43] not to say well I believe this Lord and
[1:53:45] then they they move on and do this and
[1:53:47] do that no no they had to focus on it
[1:53:49] and they would reflect it
[1:53:51] it's like it's like Cain and Abel
[1:53:54] praise the Lord
[1:53:56] brother
[1:53:57] they both had a revelation of that they
[1:53:59] needed Redemption
[1:54:02] but Abel had the right revelation
[1:54:06] to sacrifice
[1:54:09] and remember they both sacrifice
[1:54:11] and Cain sacrificed as I said before we
[1:54:14] say it again Cain's sacrifice was
[1:54:16] excellent
[1:54:17] how do you know that well it says that
[1:54:20] Abel offered them more excellent
[1:54:24] and you can get Believers that are
[1:54:26] offering wonderful oh yeah good
[1:54:27] sacrifices as Believers oh yeah he's a
[1:54:31] Believer she's a Believer yeah but is it
[1:54:33] the more excellent sacrifice
[1:54:37] it caused Abel his life
[1:54:41] and if you're offering the more
[1:54:42] excellent sacrifice it's going to cost
[1:54:44] you your life
[1:54:46] when it comes to with family friends
[1:54:48] Neighbors
[1:54:50] yeah
[1:54:53] you'll be cut off
[1:54:57] look what they did to Jesus
[1:55:00] look what they did to the to the
[1:55:02] disciples
[1:55:04] now God help us
[1:55:06] are we are we willing to lay our lives
[1:55:09] down as Peter did is and not only just
[1:55:11] when they went to crucify Peter oh
[1:55:14] I'll tell you this
[1:55:17] Peter said pump me don't Don't crucify
[1:55:19] me the way you did it you did him
[1:55:22] he said I'm not worthy
[1:55:23] what
[1:55:25] not worthy no he said I'm not worthy he
[1:55:28] said turn me upside down
[1:55:31] They Crucified him on a cross but
[1:55:35] they put his feet up and his head down
[1:55:39] that's the way he wanted to lay his life
[1:55:41] down
[1:55:42] because he felt he wasn't worthy to lay
[1:55:45] his life down like Jesus did
[1:55:47] on the cross normally
[1:55:49] no he said turn me upside down
[1:55:53] God help us
[1:55:58] what was Peter
[1:56:01] into perfect faith
[1:56:04] perfect day
[1:56:07] for him to want to do it that way his
[1:56:10] faith had to be perfect
[1:56:11] oh Peter God bless you
[1:56:14] you know
[1:56:17] and brother
[1:56:18] the father said
[1:56:20] we're waiting to come to this perfect
[1:56:22] faith for the Rapture and he said we've
[1:56:24] got to come to perfect faith for the
[1:56:27] rapture
[1:56:31] yes
[1:56:33] he said it means that oh yeah I was
[1:56:35] going to emphasize some of this
[1:56:36] eventually
[1:56:38] but I said no I won't do it maybe I'll
[1:56:40] take another message in another
[1:56:43] some more services
[1:56:46] to put the emphasis on
[1:56:48] William Branham
[1:56:55] you look at Cain and Abel
[1:56:58] look what happened to Abel
[1:57:00] you look all the way down through and
[1:57:03] and and you and this this one and that
[1:57:05] one they were religious but not
[1:57:08] spiritual one was spiritual and look at
[1:57:11] the price that they had to pay to take
[1:57:13] their stand
[1:57:16] spiritually for the Lord
[1:57:21] and I wanted to
[1:57:23] spend some time
[1:57:25] to show you what was going on in
[1:57:27] William's Ministry
[1:57:30] because he also said that he said he
[1:57:32] that he he had to lay aside everything
[1:57:34] now he said I'm going to quit this and
[1:57:36] quit that now he said I'm just going to
[1:57:38] go back into evangelism and so on and
[1:57:41] that he also was indicating too that he
[1:57:43] that he wouldn't that they were going to
[1:57:45] miss him because he felt that he
[1:57:47] wouldn't he wouldn't stay it much longer
[1:57:50] and he didn't
[1:57:52] shortly after he mentioned those things
[1:57:54] God took him off the scene
[1:57:59] you mean to say William bam change this
[1:58:01] ministry like that yes he changed his
[1:58:03] ministry
[1:58:05] he was focusing on this focusing on that
[1:58:07] until finally at the end of 1963.
[1:58:10] he changed it
[1:58:13] two years later God took him home
[1:58:16] and just think when he celebrated his
[1:58:19] his birthday 56th birthday I believe it
[1:58:22] was in 1965.
[1:58:25] oh yes it's on the tape there and he
[1:58:27] said see
[1:58:28] amazing he said I see my end coming at
[1:58:31] 56 years old
[1:58:34] he did yeah
[1:58:37] and with that same year that God took
[1:58:40] him home
[1:58:42] he knew he was going
[1:58:45] brother
[1:58:49] he said we're coming to perfection
[1:58:52] perfect faith for the rapture
[1:58:55] and he said we have to come to this in
[1:58:57] order for the rapture we got to focus on
[1:58:59] the rapture
[1:59:01] what God's done and what God's doing
[1:59:04] and what God's going to do for the
[1:59:06] rapture
[1:59:08] focus on it
[1:59:14] are you really looking for the rapture
[1:59:17] do you really want to go in the Rapture
[1:59:18] are you really hungry and thirsty for
[1:59:21] the rapture
[1:59:22] God help us or you just satisfied to be
[1:59:26] religious
[1:59:29] most are just satisfied to be religious
[1:59:31] I'm religious I'll do this I'll do that
[1:59:34] no no
[1:59:41] he said that's what's holding it away
[1:59:43] right now is waiting for that church to
[1:59:45] come into that perfect raptured faith
[1:59:50] raptured
[1:59:52] not rapturing raptured
[1:59:54] because the the prophet of God is the
[1:59:56] fact that the Rapture is already on
[2:00:00] is going on now he said
[2:00:04] I trust that we're experiencing the
[2:00:05] Rapture that we've been caught up
[2:00:07] what do you mean being caught up how do
[2:00:09] you know that well if you're being
[2:00:11] caught up
[2:00:14] the world and the things of the world
[2:00:16] around you is having less and less
[2:00:18] effect on you
[2:00:21] yeah you're getting more and more and
[2:00:23] more interested in the resurrection more
[2:00:25] interested in the Rapture monster in the
[2:00:28] Lord amen amen oh yeah a new Heaven new
[2:00:32] Earth
[2:00:33] because I said you
[2:00:36] you're not of this world and as I said
[2:00:39] if you if as like a newfoundlander maybe
[2:00:41] like I said the other night going going
[2:00:44] to a a certain place in in the world and
[2:00:47] after after you're there a while oh you
[2:00:48] want to get back home
[2:00:50] why
[2:00:51] because that's what you're used to
[2:00:53] oh
[2:00:54] get back home oh I feel good now I'm
[2:00:57] home
[2:00:58] oh yeah
[2:01:00] so brother it's the same thing with the
[2:01:02] seed of God the bride of Christ we want
[2:01:04] to get home
[2:01:06] that's why we're not satisfied here in
[2:01:08] this old world
[2:01:10] no
[2:01:11] we want to get home
[2:01:14] God help us
[2:01:16] amen and that's why in the word of God
[2:01:19] we know that the only way home is the
[2:01:22] resurrection and the rapture
[2:01:28] he said that's what's holding it away
[2:01:30] right now and waiting for that church to
[2:01:32] come into that perfect raptured faith
[2:01:34] raptured and I said I'm looking for it
[2:01:37] and it means a lot of shaking down for
[2:01:39] me
[2:01:40] it means a lot for you
[2:01:42] but together we'll make it by the grace
[2:01:45] of God
[2:01:46] amen
[2:01:48] and then he said don't you love him he
[2:01:51] said think right now he said already be
[2:01:53] going to work in your body
[2:01:55] of your healing because that he promised
[2:01:58] it would happen and he said did you
[2:02:00] catch what I was saying tonight have you
[2:02:02] got the riddle of it
[2:02:04] he said
[2:02:06] if you say to this mountain don't doubt
[2:02:08] but he said believe that what you have
[2:02:11] said
[2:02:12] he said I'm your brother he said
[2:02:15] standing as your brother an intercessor
[2:02:17] and he said I'm trying to my best to
[2:02:20] hold you before God and I'm standing
[2:02:22] here right before the white throne
[2:02:24] point my finger to that Bloody sacrifice

[2:02:45] he said to the church the bride the
[2:02:47] Rapture is a revelation to her
[2:02:50] and it's revealed to her that the
[2:02:53] Revelation the true bride of Christ will
[2:02:55] be waiting for that revelation of the

[2:03:11] it being faith faith is a revelation
[2:03:13] because it's something that's revealed

[2:08:37] I pray God we're not looking for the
[2:08:39] Saints there they're not there
[2:08:42] if they are seed of God
[2:08:44] during the dimension with you
[2:08:47] you're right that's the prophet said

[2:08:50] 12 feet from you at any any given time
[2:08:53] yeah
[2:08:55] so don't worry about the graveyard
[2:08:59] it's like I said there's a
[2:09:01] a picture that I saw one time in a
[2:09:03] certain book and I I did pass it on to
[2:09:05] somebody else it was a religious book
[2:09:09] and it was a picture a painting of the
[2:09:12] Resurrection
[2:09:15] and
[2:09:16] in the resurrection there was any like a
[2:09:20] cemetery and you saw the Dead coming out
[2:09:22] of the graves and going out
[2:09:25] oh yes there was Grandma and Grandpa
[2:09:27] they were old
[2:09:29] and there was a a a a child just a young
[2:09:33] child
[2:09:34] and a baby and they were they were being
[2:09:36] raptured and resurrected and they were
[2:09:39] going up up in in the painting I said
[2:09:42] well I said that brother never had the
[2:09:43] revelation
[2:09:44] because I said that baby is not going to
[2:09:46] be out there there's no infant of days
[2:09:48] neither an old man does not fulfill his
[2:09:50] days
[2:09:51] amen because that the the infant is
[2:09:54] going to be young and the old man comes
[2:09:56] back to you to his to his young days and
[2:09:58] so on praise the Lord
[2:10:00] that that will be the resurrection

[2:10:09] resurrection of the Rapture brother

[2:10:23] wrinkled and so on no will not need by
[2:10:25] any means they're going to be young
[2:10:29] it's like the young sister one time that
[2:10:31] had the vision of going from time to
[2:10:33] Eternity
[2:10:35] and
[2:10:36] when she got over and she got over to
[2:10:38] that other dimension she saw this young
[2:10:40] man
[2:10:42] and she looked at him and he said you
[2:10:45] don't know me
[2:10:48] she said no who are you oh she said I
[2:10:51] was he said I was your brother
[2:10:53] he said when we were on Earth he said I
[2:10:55] was your brother
[2:10:57] but he was just a young
[2:10:59] young boy and here he was the young man
[2:11:03] in eternity
[2:11:04] well she said oh yes he said that's me
[2:11:08] and he said this is what I am here he
[2:11:10] said in eternity praise the Lord
[2:11:13] please
[2:11:16] let's be in the spirit
[2:11:19] brother if you're not in the spirit here
[2:11:20] when you go on to Eternity you won't be
[2:11:22] in the in the right Spirit there
[2:11:25] amen if we're going to recognize what
[2:11:27] God has done what God's doing here
[2:11:29] brother we got we'll recognize what God
[2:11:31] has done doing in eternity
[2:11:33] let's be on our guard for the glory of
[2:11:36] God
[2:11:38] amen
[2:11:41] Allah to finish with this
[2:11:46] in
[2:11:49] again Matthew 24.
[2:11:54] I'll read the scriptures that I got
[2:11:56] listed here from Matthew 24 again
[2:11:59] and verse 1
[2:12:01] and Jesus went out and departed from the
[2:12:03] temple and his disciples came to him for
[2:12:05] to show him the building of the temple
[2:12:07] or the buildings
[2:12:09] and Jesus said unto them see ye not all
[2:12:12] these things verily I say unto you there
[2:12:15] shall not be left ear one stone upon
[2:12:17] another that shall not be thrown down
[2:12:19] and as he set upon the Mount of Olives
[2:12:21] the disciples came unto him privately
[2:12:24] saying tell us
[2:12:25] When shall these things be and what
[2:12:29] shall be the sign of thy coming and the
[2:12:31] end of the world
[2:12:33] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[2:12:35] take he that no man deceive you
[2:12:39] for many shall come in my name saying I
[2:12:43] am Christ
[2:12:45] and shall deceive many
[2:12:48] and ye shall hear wars and rumors of
[2:12:51] wars see that ye be not troubled for all
[2:12:54] these things must come to pass but
[2:12:58] the end is not yet
[2:13:00] for a nation shall rise against nation
[2:13:03] and Kingdom against Kingdom and there
[2:13:05] shall be famines pestilences and
[2:13:07] earthquakes in diverse places and these
[2:13:11] are the beginning of Sorrows
[2:13:14] then shall they deliver you up to be
[2:13:16] afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[2:13:19] shall be aided of all Nations for my
[2:13:21] name's sake
[2:13:23] and then shall many of be offended and
[2:13:26] shall betray one another and shall hate
[2:13:28] one another
[2:13:31] yes indeed
[2:13:32] and many false prophets shall rise and
[2:13:35] shall deceive many
[2:13:36] and because iniquity shall abound the
[2:13:39] love of many shall wax cold
[2:13:42] but he that shall endure unto the end
[2:13:44] the same shall be saved
[2:13:46] amen God help us to endure
[2:13:50] and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be
[2:13:52] preached in all the world for a witness
[2:13:55] unto all nations and then shall the End
[2:13:58] come and as I said it has been preached
[2:14:00] in all the world
[2:14:02] where it's finished
[2:14:03] but again
[2:14:05] we think it's just a matter of days or
[2:14:07] whatever when the Bible says one day
[2:14:08] with the Lord has a thousand years
[2:14:10] a thousand years is one day
[2:14:12] amen so it's been two days
[2:14:17] since since Calvary
[2:14:20] oh yeah two thousand years says Jesus
[2:14:23] came and laid down his life and picked
[2:14:24] it up again
[2:14:27] it's about two days well what about the
[2:14:29] third day we're into the third day
[2:14:33] that's right so I pray Grace
[2:14:37] the three is the perfection
[2:14:41] amen
[2:14:47] it says when ye therefore shall see the
[2:14:49] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[2:14:52] Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy
[2:14:54] place
[2:14:55] whoso readeth let him understand then
[2:14:58] let them which be in Judea flee into the
[2:15:01] mountains let them which is on the
[2:15:03] housetop not come down to take anything
[2:15:05] out of his house
[2:15:07] forget it
[2:15:09] I wonder how many of us are willing to
[2:15:11] let go
[2:15:12] I forget all that we possess
[2:15:17] yeah all your worldly positions
[2:15:20] what about your vehicles your money your
[2:15:23] house your furniture
[2:15:27] don't put no emphasis on it here
[2:15:30] thank God you got it
[2:15:32] and move on
[2:15:34] by grace
[2:15:38] unfortunately there's so many that they
[2:15:40] feel so bad about having to leave all
[2:15:42] that
[2:15:43] but if you're a bride
[2:15:44] leave it
[2:15:47] burn it
[2:15:49] amen
[2:15:51] he said let them which be in Judea flee
[2:15:53] into the mountains let them which is on
[2:15:55] the housetop not come down to take
[2:15:57] anything out of his house
[2:16:00] neither let him which is in the field
[2:16:02] return back to take his clothes and woe
[2:16:05] unto them that are with child and to
[2:16:08] them that give suck in those days pray
[2:16:11] ye that your flight be not in the winter
[2:16:13] neither on the Sabbath day
[2:16:16] for then shall be Great Tribulation such
[2:16:20] as was not since the beginning of the
[2:16:22] world to this time nor ever known nor
[2:16:26] ever shall be
[2:16:28] and except those days should be
[2:16:30] shortened there should no flesh be saved
[2:16:34] but for the elect's sake those days
[2:16:37] shall be shortened
[2:16:39] then if any man shall say unto you
[2:16:41] lawyers Christ are there believe it not
[2:16:44] for there shall arise false Christ false
[2:16:48] prophets and shall show great signs and
[2:16:50] wonders in so much that if it were
[2:16:52] possible they should deceive the very
[2:16:55] elect God have mercy on us
[2:16:57] amen
[2:16:59] that will not be deceived but stay with
[2:17:01] the truth stay with the word by the
[2:17:04] grace of God
[2:17:05] amen
[2:17:07] we'll have to leave it maybe stop there
[2:17:11] and continue
[2:17:13] on Wednesday
[2:17:16] he said when a man lives by faith
[2:17:20] and when a man walks by faith
[2:17:23] substance faith
[2:17:24] he is isolated from the entire world
[2:17:28] and becomes a new creature in Christ
