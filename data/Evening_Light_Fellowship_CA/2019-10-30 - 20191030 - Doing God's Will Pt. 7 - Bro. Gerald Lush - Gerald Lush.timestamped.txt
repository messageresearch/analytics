[49:25] that brother Bantam used in us in a
[49:27] message that I want to share with you
[49:28] tonight and some thoughts in that
[49:30] message amazing that it still lines up
[49:34] with the theme of the messages that
[49:37] we've been ministering on brother
[49:40] because it's what God does from the
[49:45] beginning and that is get personal with
[49:47] us amen
[49:48] God is not over there and we're over
[49:50] here no he comes down a man to make us
[49:53] one with him through his word praise the
[49:56] name of the Lord that's where he kept or
[49:59] he asked Martha believe us though this a
[50:01] man and brother if God was looking for
[50:04] anything all down through the ages he
[50:07] was looking for those that believed his
[50:08] word a man regardless of what he
[50:11] revealed when he revealed it where he
[50:13] revealed how he revealed it believe us
[50:16] now this a man so brother when the word
[50:19] was made flesh believed the word and
[50:22] brother if the word is may flesh in you
[50:24] believe the word a man by the grace of
[50:27] Almighty God so brother right from the
[50:30] beginning where was it that the
[50:33] the sin in the beginning it was caused
[50:35] Eve to doubt the word what to do he
[50:38] handed one to it that's all God said
[50:42] thou shalt surely die and the devil said
[50:45] yea thou shall not surely die just one
[50:49] word and they believed them that's right
[50:52] he believed the serpent yeah I said
[50:54] you're all you will be as God's knowing
[50:57] good and evil
[51:00] a mayor so don't go by what the devil is
[51:03] saying you stay with what God said amen
[51:06] brother
[51:07] oh my and but yet God knew what was
[51:10] going to happen and God permitted it a
[51:12] man knowing that again why did he do
[51:15] that because she was again one of our
[51:18] brothers linked Rome Africa he said that
[51:20] he was a byproduct and he highlighted
[51:23] the fact that yarn I thought and I sure
[51:25] what part of Africa he said yeah he said
[51:27] that's right he said because the women
[51:29] are still byproducts thereof buying
[51:31] products all the time and so brother I
[51:35] pray God will not forget it a man but
[51:39] she was a byproduct she wasn't cheating
[51:41] she was not in the original creation
[51:43] no no Shh Adam was the original creation
[51:46] but he took act he took Eve out of Adam
[51:49] a man she was she was the rib a man and
[51:53] she was weak she had that weakness and
[51:54] God knew what was going to happen and
[51:56] God permitted it because God wanted to
[51:59] reveal himself to us as Lord and Savior
[52:03] he wanted to reveal his love to us so
[52:06] that we're going to love him for himself
[52:08] amen not because like the Angels they're
[52:11] gonna love him because they're made to
[52:13] love him they're created to love him
[52:15] no no no he's going to reveal his
[52:18] character and we're gonna love his
[52:19] character thank you Jesus amen love the
[52:23] Lord from the inside out in in st.
[52:27] Luke's Gospel chapter 14 and beginning
[52:31] to read at verse 16 and again
[52:35] a number of times recently I've been
[52:37] feeling to read this scripture and I
[52:42] said no I can't read that for some
[52:44] reason no no no and I go to it no turn
[52:49] from it again I still Lord what would
[52:50] you have me to read and but I never
[52:53] realized that this would be the text for
[52:56] the message is your life worthy of the
[53:01] gospel a man and we're talking about
[53:04] hearing and seeing the way that God
[53:06] hears and wants you to hear and see it
[53:08] we're done by the right motives and the
[53:10] right objectives and doing doing God a
[53:14] service without his will a man but to
[53:18] Kornegay his will we got to see it the
[53:20] way God wants us to see it hear it the
[53:22] way God wants us to hear it a man we
[53:24] gotta have a right motive and a right
[53:26] objective a man and then with what we do
[53:29] we'll do according to his will by the
[53:31] grace of God so brother but now it comes
[53:34] down to the question is is your life
[53:37] worthy of the gospel
[53:38] a man so are you hearing it and seeing
[53:41] it the way you should and do you have
[53:44] the right motive and the right
[53:45] objectives in your life a Maya and how
[53:49] you doing God a service according to his
[53:51] will a man these things got to line up
[53:55] with the will of God and the Word of God
[53:57] to do that do what he wants you to do
[53:59] according to his will amen
[54:02] you can serve God and yet be lost and
[54:05] he'll bring that out that's tremendous I
[54:08] said oh Lord
[54:09] I'll have to share that quote with him
[54:10] for sure a man is right near the end of
[54:13] the message but I said oh God I said
[54:16] lord I never never saw that in that way
[54:18] before but at the way that he brought it
[54:20] out so I said Lord how I said help me I
[54:22] said him to say it help me to speak it
[54:25] and helped us out the Saints I said to
[54:27] receive it
[54:27] amen so it's tremendous what is the life
[54:31] a man that is worthy of the gospel this
[54:36] is tremendous because there are lives
[54:38] maybe in the Bible we think is worthy of
[54:40] the gospel but they weren't no no they
[54:44] weren't
[54:45] so I pray the grace of God brother we
[54:48] need to understand what is the life that
[54:50] is worthy of the gospel amen
[54:52] well I mean in the message but the
[54:55] promise of the message is not in you a
[54:56] man
[54:58] so I'll make sure the message is in you
[55:00] by the grace of God and this was his
[55:04] tanks verse 16 then said he unto him a
[55:09] certain man made a great supper and made
[55:14] many and sent his servant at supper time
[55:19] to say to them that were bidden come for
[55:24] all things are now ready the marriage
[55:29] supper of the lamb come for all things
[55:33] are now ready and they all with one
[55:38] Accord began to make excuse amazing the
[55:45] first said unto him I have bought a
[55:48] piece of ground and I must needs go and
[55:52] see it
[55:53] I pray thee and me excused they were
[55:59] invited but what they did show their
[56:06] life was not worthy of the gospel and
[56:10] another Saint I have bought by yoke of
[56:15] oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee
[56:19] have me excused amazing and another sad
[56:26] I have married a wife and therefore I
[56:30] cannot come
[56:33] so that servant came and showed his Lord
[56:38] these things then the master
[56:44] the house being angry said to his
[56:47] servant go out quickly into the streets
[56:50] and lanes of the city and bring in
[56:57] either the poor and the maimed and the
[57:01] halt and the blind yes amazing and the
[57:09] servants say Lord it is done as thou has
[57:12] commanded and yet there is room mazing
[57:19] and the Lord
[57:22] under the servant go out into the
[57:24] highways and hedges and compel them to
[57:27] come in that my house may be filled for
[57:33] I say unto you that none of those men
[57:37] which were bidden shall taste of my
[57:41] supper Amen god bless his words you may
[57:46] be seated
[57:53] we'll get into them thoughts in just a
[57:56] moment but just to remind you that on
[57:59] Sunday will be having the communion and
[58:01] foot washing and communion on Sunday so
[58:05] be in prayer for the service that God
[58:07] will be blessed us with his presence and
[58:10] also to remind you of concerning again
[58:12] our brother Jonathan Colette and he will
[58:16] be arriving on November the 8th on
[58:17] Friday night and he will be ministering
[58:21] on November the 9th and November the
[58:23] 10th and ordinarily that we would get
[58:27] them to come on
[58:28] on a Thursday and minister on a Friday
[58:31] but because of his work in British
[58:35] Columbia that he's not able to come on
[58:37] Thursday and this is why that his flight
[58:39] is on a Friday and Friday night so let's
[58:44] be in prayer for brother Jonathan that
[58:46] the Lord will give him a safe journey
[58:48] and bless his ministry to us on a
[58:51] Saturday and a Sunday by the grace of
[58:54] God and I'm not sure understand that
[58:57] maybe he'll be traveling back on a
[58:58] Wednesday so God's great God's grace to
[59:02] our brother Jonathan and also to our
[59:04] sister Blanco course and her need and
[59:07] also to pray the grace of God of course
[59:11] I believe I understood that brother
[59:13] Matthew got his moose he's not loose no
[59:17] he got it sorry
[59:20] so we'll pray the grace of God to our
[59:22] brother Matthew and also to our brother
[59:24] Joseph and pray the Lord will provide
[59:27] our brother Joseph with what he's
[59:29] looking for a man but also to if the
[59:33] Lord would permit it
[59:34] that God would bless their time with for
[59:36] all fellowship with the Saints they met
[59:39] our brother Matthew did say that he
[59:41] would endeavor and try to fellowship
[59:43] with the Saints while he was in central
[59:46] Newfoundland a man so we pray the Lord
[59:49] will will open up make it make it
[59:51] possible for brother Matthew and brother
[59:54] Joseph because there was a number of
[59:56] theirs I said that are supporting the
[59:58] ministry here and I pray the grace of
[1:00:01] God to bless the Saints with fellowship
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:05] and also again there's a brother in
[1:00:09] Africa and he's in Ghana and our brother
[1:00:13] Jacob Jonah he said that he he would he
[1:00:19] would might be coming to Canada but
[1:00:23] where he's going in Canada is Western
[1:00:27] Canada and he referred to a brother a
[1:00:30] brother Stewart and I assume his brother
[1:00:34] Stewart Cummings
[1:00:35] in British Columbia and he's in his rate
[1:00:38] writing right out through the west near
[1:00:42] the Pacific Ocean as that's the last at
[1:00:44] least the last time that I had
[1:00:46] communication with him and and his wife
[1:00:50] so I I haven't been in contact with him
[1:00:53] but brother Jonah did mention
[1:00:55] fellowship with our brother Stewart so
[1:00:58] everybody also wanted the fellowship in
[1:01:01] Newfoundland so we'll see what the Lord
[1:01:03] will do and our brother Jacob Jonah is
[1:01:06] an evangelist in in Ghana than any
[1:01:10] travels he does travel around Africa
[1:01:12] different parts of Africa and I did get
[1:01:16] a good report
[1:01:17] for regarding our brother Jonah so we
[1:01:21] pray god bless him and when it comes to
[1:01:24] his visit to Canada we'll we'll leave it
[1:01:26] with the Lord and see what the Lord
[1:01:28] would arrange aim
[1:01:30] so god bless you and god bless brother
[1:01:33] Stuart and and sister Stuart so I assume
[1:01:38] that they're not young either and
[1:01:39] they're getting out there because of
[1:01:42] course they've they've retired quite a
[1:01:43] while ago so god bless them
[1:01:46] and of course we I do have a cassette
[1:01:50] somewhere and I believe I may be we
[1:01:52] might have played it to the church and
[1:01:53] there's brother Stuart's testimony
[1:01:55] I know asked quite a while ago and
[1:01:58] concerning you know what he was involved
[1:02:01] in out there in the world but then the
[1:02:03] Lord got a hold of him he was looking
[1:02:05] for truth
[1:02:06] and he told he tells us that he went
[1:02:08] across Canada and he went down in the
[1:02:11] United States and he was looking for the
[1:02:13] truth and then he came back up into
[1:02:15] British Columbia somewhere believe it
[1:02:17] was and that's where he came in contact
[1:02:19] with the message of the hour he said God
[1:02:21] led me to the truth a man so he's he's
[1:02:25] thankful for what the Lord did he but he
[1:02:26] like I said he was sincere and he
[1:02:29] traveled and he traveled and he windier
[1:02:30] and he went there and went there looking
[1:02:32] for the truth a man cuz he felt was it
[1:02:36] was beyond denominations he was beyond
[1:02:38] this beyond that any any check number of
[1:02:41] ministries but still he just each felt
[1:02:44] it wasn't the truth till he came to the
[1:02:46] message of the hour amen so god bless
[1:02:48] our brother Stuart amen so and also to
[1:02:53] thank our brothers here our brother
[1:02:56] Weiser land brother John and brother
[1:02:59] Joshua for the fellowship we had last
[1:03:02] Sunday we were at the restaurant for
[1:03:05] quite a while and so we we had to leave
[1:03:08] because we thought if we didn't leave
[1:03:09] they were gonna force us out so we were
[1:03:12] there for such a long time fellowshiping
[1:03:14] at the table but again we thank the
[1:03:17] thing the Lord that the manager did come
[1:03:19] and have some fellowship with us as well
[1:03:21] and and also then we went to our condo
[1:03:25] and we had fellowship there and it was
[1:03:28] tremendous a man it was wonderful thank
[1:03:30] the Lord so and it was a real blessing
[1:03:33] man and
[1:03:36] a blessing in the into this desert
[1:03:39] desert brother that we add and so on in
[1:03:43] the fellowship we had and our brother
[1:03:46] Marshall was right there to help sister
[1:03:47] Betty to prepare to prepare it you know
[1:03:51] sitting the table and he wanted he won't
[1:03:53] even wash the dishes
[1:03:54] anyway that's good a man so if he if you
[1:03:59] anybody invites him here to their home
[1:04:01] get him to wash dishes a man does not
[1:04:06] many would would want to do that for you
[1:04:07] so thank the Lord so god bless him a
[1:04:10] like I said it was wonderful fellowship
[1:04:12] amen thank the Lord
[1:04:14] again the scripture in st. Luke's Gospel
[1:04:18] chapter 14 and brother Branham does
[1:04:23] bring out eventually in the message we
[1:04:25] may not be able to get into it tonight
[1:04:27] here in his your life worthy of the
[1:04:29] gospel but I have I lighted here in my
[1:04:32] notes in the Bible that does text that
[1:04:35] brother Branham was using as three poles
[1:04:39] and it does speak of the evening time it
[1:04:44] is not the morning it is not in the noon
[1:04:46] it is evening time and again it proves
[1:04:50] again what brother Benton believed he
[1:04:52] didn't believe in breakfast lunch and
[1:04:54] dinner brother BAM believed in breakfast
[1:04:58] dinner and supper a man because he said
[1:05:01] if I have breakfast lunch and dinner he
[1:05:03] said I missed my supper and he said
[1:05:05] wonder where it is because to brother
[1:05:08] Branham and again to again to
[1:05:11] Newfoundlanders and to the hill to
[1:05:13] Kentucky Hillbillies that supper was in
[1:05:16] the evening a man not dinner then it was
[1:05:20] during the noonday breakfast was in the
[1:05:22] morning but supper was in the evening
[1:05:24] and this is the parable of the great
[1:05:28] supper this is the parable of the
[1:05:32] evening time supper
[1:05:34] it is a parable of the marriage supper
[1:05:37] of the lamb a man
[1:05:40] it is the heavenly bridegroom and it is
[1:05:43] the earthly bright a man and the
[1:05:46] invitation is sent out inviting this one
[1:05:49] and this one
[1:05:50] and that one too the marriage supper of
[1:05:52] the lamb and this one uses this excuse
[1:05:55] and that issues and another excuse and
[1:05:58] the prophet of God highlights it here in
[1:06:01] this message about the excuses that man
[1:06:03] is making and he said he shows that
[1:06:06] their lives are not worthy of the gospel
[1:06:08] a man because they're giving preeminence
[1:06:11] to their natural lives but not to their
[1:06:13] spiritual and they're giving preeminence
[1:06:15] to themselves and what they want to do
[1:06:17] and when they want to do it and how they
[1:06:19] want to do it but they're not getting
[1:06:21] preeminence to the to God they're not
[1:06:23] giving Prima's to what God is requiring
[1:06:25] of us what God is looking for in us a
[1:06:28] man so their lives were not worthy of
[1:06:31] the gospel
[1:06:32] any-any he highlights this as well that
[1:06:35] they're doing this for God they're doing
[1:06:37] that for God a man and you think oh yeah
[1:06:40] they're there they're Christians oh yeah
[1:06:42] they're believers no they're not
[1:06:44] Christians and they're not believers
[1:06:45] because why because they're getting more
[1:06:48] preeminence to the natural things of
[1:06:50] life than to the spiritual a man and
[1:06:52] brother I turn to this for a life to be
[1:06:54] worthy of the gospel you're going to get
[1:06:56] more preeminence to the spiritual and
[1:06:58] less and less and less to the natural a
[1:07:01] man by the grace of Almighty God you're
[1:07:05] not going to focus on the natural you're
[1:07:06] going to leave that with God not my real
[1:07:09] father
[1:07:09] laying me down Alleluia and Jesus came
[1:07:12] to that II and they in that time of his
[1:07:14] ministry and brother the bride comes to
[1:07:17] that in the in the last days when we
[1:07:19] consider the hour that we are living in
[1:07:21] and we're in our Lord warned us that the
[1:07:24] love of many would wax cold and I didn't
[1:07:27] say there to love would be gone but
[1:07:28] their love would be cold they would they
[1:07:30] wouldn't have much love a man the love
[1:07:33] of many would wax cold a man and brother
[1:07:37] and then we're living in that day we're
[1:07:38] living in that hour Witek swear we're
[1:07:40] witnessing that thought brother sister
[1:07:42] nada just out there in the world we're
[1:07:44] witnessing that among even among many
[1:07:46] so-called believers they have not the
[1:07:48] love that they used to have a man it has
[1:07:51] when it's cold so we are living in that
[1:07:54] hour and when we have the morning a man
[1:07:56] mother to be on our guard and brother to
[1:07:59] give to give more and more preeminent to
[1:08:01] the spiritual and lay
[1:08:03] laughter the natural but again because
[1:08:06] the love of many of exco they're giving
[1:08:09] less and less preeminence and less or
[1:08:11] less attention to the spiritual things
[1:08:13] that God is dealing with in this hour
[1:08:15] amen the spiritual things that God is
[1:08:18] revealing in this hour the spiritual
[1:08:20] things that God is showing us in this
[1:08:22] hour a man
[1:08:23] their brothers are getting caught up
[1:08:24] with this doctrine and that doctor and
[1:08:26] that one a man will highlight that
[1:08:28] that's in the Word of God and the
[1:08:30] Private Eye lights it here in this
[1:08:31] message oh yeah they'll get caught up
[1:08:33] with this and caught up with that but
[1:08:35] they are not caught up with what God
[1:08:38] wants something get caught up with
[1:08:39] they're not focusing on what God wants
[1:08:42] them to focus on a man they're focusing
[1:08:44] on this revelation that revelation other
[1:08:47] revelation and doctrine but how many are
[1:08:50] focusing on the resurrection and the
[1:08:52] rapture a man a man see you're coming
[1:08:55] right back to that again because that's
[1:08:58] what God is doing in this hour and in
[1:09:00] this age it's not if not revealing
[1:09:03] justification is not just revealing
[1:09:05] sanctification is not revealing the
[1:09:07] visit the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:10] the gifts of the Spirit know were gone
[1:09:12] beyond their amen brother
[1:09:14] even the early Pentecostals were we're
[1:09:17] been looking for what you but God as
[1:09:19] done and God is doing in your life and
[1:09:23] in mine because even though the early
[1:09:25] Pentecost was the old-fashioned
[1:09:27] Pentecostals when they saw what God was
[1:09:29] doing in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:31] and the gifts of the Spirit
[1:09:33] oh yeah they were thinking oh my praise
[1:09:36] the Lord
[1:09:36] oh there there I I believe that this is
[1:09:38] going to go on to the resurrection I
[1:09:40] believe this was going to go on to the
[1:09:42] rapture hey man that's right so soon now
[1:09:45] that this generation of Pentecostals
[1:09:47] don't believe that they believe all the
[1:09:49] other resurrection is down the road the
[1:09:51] rapture is down the road oh there's
[1:09:53] going to be a resurrection is going to
[1:09:54] be a rapture but they don't see the the
[1:09:57] the revelation egg what God had done in
[1:10:00] the Pentecostal age as a prophet of God
[1:10:04] he said listen he said this this
[1:10:06] ministry and what God was doing in the
[1:10:08] Prophet and through the Prophet he said
[1:10:10] it is the crowning of the Pentecostal
[1:10:12] message it is the crowning of the
[1:10:15] Pentecostal age
[1:10:16] a man by the way because Luther's age
[1:10:19] will lead on to Wesley and Wesley slid
[1:10:21] onto the well he was Salvation Army
[1:10:24] because why because the Methodists said
[1:10:26] and organized so quickly the prophet of
[1:10:29] God said they God had the raised up
[1:10:30] William Booth he said with redhot
[1:10:33] salvation he said to keep on going with
[1:10:36] Wesley's message and brother before God
[1:10:38] took William Booth off the scene before
[1:10:40] God took a Katharine booth off the scene
[1:10:43] what were they preaching they were
[1:10:45] preaching the need for the baptism of
[1:10:48] the holy ghost and the gifts of the
[1:10:50] Spirit amen
[1:10:51] they were up there hallelujah they were
[1:10:53] pointing they were pointing to the day
[1:10:55] of Pentecost and they were preaching you
[1:10:57] know what we need in this hour now we
[1:10:59] need what they had on the day of
[1:11:01] Pentecost you mean to tell me that
[1:11:03] wouldn't move with preaching that you
[1:11:05] mean to tell me that even his wife
[1:11:07] Katherine with preaching those things
[1:11:08] yes a man and because why because all my
[1:11:13] Eva even Katherine movement was was
[1:11:15] preaching concerning the she was a woman
[1:11:17] preacher but she didn't know the other
[1:11:19] things and before God took her off the
[1:11:23] saint she was preaching at you is
[1:11:25] putting the emphasis on on the sisters
[1:11:27] in the Salvation Army she said she said
[1:11:30] we got a problem and she said it's in
[1:11:33] your in your in your closet amen because
[1:11:37] she was seeing that the worldly spirit
[1:11:40] was getting on the sisters and the
[1:11:42] worldís mirror was getting coming in
[1:11:43] around the Salvation Army
[1:11:45] amen and she solutions of the pregnancy
[1:11:48] there's not ears not there it's in your
[1:11:50] closet and she said you need to repent
[1:11:53] and we needed we knew she said where you
[1:11:55] what we need she said we need she said
[1:11:57] what they had on the day of Pentecost
[1:11:59] amen so they were putting more and more
[1:12:02] and more emphasis on the baptism of the
[1:12:05] Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit
[1:12:07] why because because that was the next
[1:12:10] thing that God was going to do
[1:12:12] amen that was an x-ray Bible God was
[1:12:14] going to bring that was the next revival
[1:12:16] Carver is going to start Amen praise the
[1:12:19] name of the Lord
[1:12:20] it was the Pentecostal revival it was
[1:12:22] Timothy was the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:25] Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit
[1:12:29] remember because during the during the
[1:12:31] church ages when they went into the Dark
[1:12:33] Ages the the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:36] that was that wasn't that wasn't
[1:12:37] considered and the gifts of the Spirit
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:41] the enemy of the me and the enemy had
[1:12:43] got in and the emphasis was no longer on
[1:12:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:12:47] Emerson's were no longer the gifts of
[1:12:49] the Spirit the emphasis was on
[1:12:51] just-just-just doctrine it was on this
[1:12:54] doctor that I would say it was on
[1:12:55] religion amen amen
[1:12:58] they got away from the spirit and they
[1:13:01] got in a man they got into organized
[1:13:05] religion and the organ it was in the
[1:13:08] first church and then in the second and
[1:13:10] third church age Amen the deeds of the
[1:13:13] Nicolaitans amen
[1:13:15] what is the deeds of the Nicolaitans and
[1:13:17] so on and I have mentioned it before
[1:13:19] here in Revelation bear with me and he
[1:13:27] said but this though a said thou hatest
[1:13:29] the deeds of the Nicolaitans which I
[1:13:32] also hate and what was the deeds of the
[1:13:34] Nicolaitans it was a spirit that was
[1:13:36] getting among the early church to
[1:13:38] conquer the lady a man so that they're
[1:13:41] going to put all the emphasis on the
[1:13:43] ministry air and take it away from there
[1:13:46] from the leadership of God in the
[1:13:47] congregation of the elders and of the
[1:13:50] Deacons are so on
[1:13:51] amen brother I tell you the Ministry of
[1:13:53] the word would be on to the authority of
[1:13:57] the ministry but again they they they
[1:13:59] not only took not only putting them in
[1:14:02] the emphasis on those things but they
[1:14:04] they didn't want anybody in the
[1:14:06] congregation to have any saint about
[1:14:08] what God was doing and what God would do
[1:14:11] amen
[1:14:11] anyway they and everybody oh yeah
[1:14:13] they're do they wanted you to worship
[1:14:15] the ministry they wanted you to put the
[1:14:17] emphasis on the ministry they wanted you
[1:14:19] to do nothing to say nothing without
[1:14:21] controlling the ministry and it was
[1:14:23] taking all authority away from any
[1:14:25] brother and sister that God would
[1:14:28] usually in their certainly a man that it
[1:14:31] was the deeds of the Nicolaitans amen
[1:14:34] conquer the laity that's what it means
[1:14:37] conquer the lady amen
[1:14:39] so that older you because God could deal
[1:14:42] with
[1:14:42] with this one God to deal with that one
[1:14:44] the gifts of the Spirit God could do
[1:14:46] with this one it in a dream or in a
[1:14:48] vision a man but no they took all that
[1:14:51] away and everything they put they gave
[1:14:53] all authority to the ministry a man so
[1:14:56] that you had you had to listen to the
[1:14:58] ministry and you had to consult the
[1:15:00] ministry a man well there is there is a
[1:15:02] truth to it a name but not to the extent
[1:15:05] that the deeds of the Nicolaitans a man
[1:15:08] what was doing in the first church H and
[1:15:11] Anna and you read the church ages as
[1:15:13] they went on into the second and into
[1:15:16] the third church H brother in it's just
[1:15:18] a thought in the first age but then it
[1:15:21] becomes a doctrine amen
[1:15:23] it's a doctrine and then it becomes an
[1:15:25] absolutely a spirit in the church and
[1:15:28] the church organized a man and the trend
[1:15:31] what do they do and because most of the
[1:15:34] church came under organized religion and
[1:15:36] he went off into darkness amen
[1:15:38] but God said I will restore saith the
[1:15:40] Lord hey man anybody any was Sri was
[1:15:44] through Luther and Wesley and to the
[1:15:46] Pentecostals that God began to bring it
[1:15:48] back again and brother lay there and the
[1:15:50] authority wasn't just in the end again
[1:15:52] there in the pulpit brother God begin to
[1:15:54] deal with the Saints in the in the
[1:15:56] congregation amen
[1:15:58] and God begin to all this one admissions
[1:16:00] this one had dreams and this would I add
[1:16:03] a gift of tongues and this one had two
[1:16:04] gift of interpretation hey man and God
[1:16:07] began to reveal the gifts of the Spirit
[1:16:09] brother it wasn't just in there caught
[1:16:11] in the in the pulpit now within the
[1:16:13] congregation
[1:16:14] hey man you got to see the the ministry
[1:16:16] has got to be anointed as the father God
[1:16:18] said he sure the ministry is the
[1:16:20] absolute authority in all spiritual
[1:16:22] matters but he's not going to take it
[1:16:24] out of the congregation a man for the
[1:16:27] man and so the brother of the ministry
[1:16:29] has got got a head the anointing of the
[1:16:30] Holy Ghost and and you in in the
[1:16:32] congregation you got to have the Holy
[1:16:34] Ghost amen but they took it out of the
[1:16:37] end of the congregation but under the
[1:16:39] ministry but now God would begin to
[1:16:41] bring it back through Luther and Wesley
[1:16:43] and the Pentecostals amen and the
[1:16:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost wasn't just on
[1:16:47] the ministry the match's emul a ghost
[1:16:50] was in the audience the bathroom of the
[1:16:52] Holy goes with anything in the
[1:16:53] congregation
[1:16:54] and this way and God began to restore
[1:16:57] the gifts of the Spirit here and there
[1:16:59] and it wasn't just a minister it was
[1:17:01] this brother it was this sister amen
[1:17:03] brother sister because when I when I
[1:17:07] first came to the Pentecostal revival

[1:17:15] our brother Berko sister Marcos came
[1:17:18] from the mainland down to to gamble said
[1:17:20] to do for the head a man and there was a
[1:17:22] revival praise the name of the Lord and
[1:17:25] brother we started having cottage
[1:17:27] meetings and the sisters there and their
[1:17:29] brothers there they had the gifts of the
[1:17:31] Spirit amen and God was dealing with us
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:35] oh there was a message in tongues it was
[1:17:37] interpreted just terms there was a
[1:17:39] tongues and interpretation or there was

[1:17:55] just the ministry but all of his sons
[1:17:57] and daughters even in the congregation
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:00] and finally what did God bring where to
[1:18:02] God bring us he brought us to the
[1:18:04] message

[1:18:07] he brought us at a religion a man in the
[1:18:10] indian to the word into there and
[1:18:12] finally into the message of the hour a
[1:18:14] man but brother that's what he brought
[1:18:16] us out out of religion that's what he
[1:18:18] brought us that a denomination a man
[1:18:20] should bring us into the word bring us
[1:18:23] into the message because if we stayed in
[1:18:25] denomination a man and then if we were
[1:18:28] putting the everyone denomination we
[1:18:30] would doubt the word or the message but
[1:18:33] God delivered us amen

[1:24:50] in the spirit they didn't walk in the
[1:24:53] light as he was in the light a man they
[1:24:57] didn't they weren't led by the spirit
[1:24:59] not the Holy Spirit they are led by a
[1:25:02] non holy spirit and remember they're

[1:25:16] sacrifices that Jesus would make no no
[1:25:21] do not live in the lives of Jesus lift
[1:25:24] it's not a life that is worthy of the
[1:25:27] gospel not by any means and it's amazing
[1:25:31] we get to it
[1:25:32] Lord willing that there's one error in
[1:25:36] the scripture it's amazing and the
[1:25:40] Prophet
[1:25:41] nights that that's that example in the
[1:25:43] scripture of the life that is not worthy
[1:25:45] of the gospel yet it's a it's a very
[1:25:48] religious life it's a holy life but not
[1:25:52] worthy of the gospel a man why because
[1:25:58] they're giving preeminence to the
[1:25:59] natural things of life more than to the
[1:26:02] spiritual oh yeah they're not denying
[1:26:05] the spiritual no they don't deny the
[1:26:07] spiritual then you know this they're not
[1:26:10] denying this denying that no but they're
[1:26:13] not they haven't they haven't they're
[1:26:15] not dying so that they can live more for
[1:26:18] the spiritual no no they're compromising
[1:26:21] so they can give more preeminence to the
[1:26:23] natural things of life and that's true
[1:26:25] so many believers today are cut off with
[1:26:27] natural things they want to do this they
[1:26:31] want to do that we want this we want
[1:26:33] brother-sister
[1:26:34] we don't want nothing if you're a seed
[1:26:36] of God you don't want anything but the
[1:26:39] will of God I'll tell you most believers
[1:26:42] today they don't stop the consider Lord
[1:26:44] what's your will and this once you're
[1:26:46] willing that see brother they're not
[1:26:48] living for God 24 hours a day it's just
[1:26:53] it's just a spirit that's on them that's
[1:26:55] right oh I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do
[1:26:58] that
[1:26:58] the Lord will mine the Lord what do you
[1:26:59] mean the Lord won't mind you better ask
[1:27:01] the Lord but most don't don't consult
[1:27:04] the Lord in all thy ways acknowledge him
[1:27:06] and he will direct your path that's the

[1:35:00] yourselves together and much more as you
[1:35:04] see the Day approaching and believers
[1:35:08] are really not into it they want less
[1:35:10] and less and less and less as I said one
[1:35:12] time we said we fellowship three four
[1:35:14] times a week and now we were down to two
[1:35:17] and eventually you get down to one and
[1:35:19] tell finally there's a lot don't even

[1:35:34] selves together often and take
[1:35:36] instructions from you lord
[1:35:38] hey man but again the people a lot of
[1:35:43] many of many so-called believers just

[1:35:50] understanding more wisdom Lord I want oh
[1:35:53] lord help me I need your help Lord

[1:36:02] what they're not recognizing they need
[1:36:03] help - what for poor and how can I be
[1:36:08] helped by increased thing hey man and
[1:36:12] how does how can I have more faith by
[1:36:14] hearing the word they come by hearing
[1:36:17] hearing by the word amen
[1:36:21] grace of God brother sister let's put
[1:36:25] the emphasis on the importance of
[1:36:28] hearing the word let's come on let's
[1:36:31] focus on what's important he's not going
[1:36:34] to church
[1:36:35] no people go to church period and thence
[1:36:38] the prophet of God said the first one in
[1:36:39] church is the devil yes he's here to
[1:36:44] control your thoughts he's here to
[1:36:46] influence your thinking in the going
[1:36:48] forth of the word and the proud of God
[1:36:50] said in the preacher of the word is over
[1:36:51] casting out spirits yeah
[1:36:55] huh listen let the Holy Ghost catch the
[1:36:58] spirit from you
[1:37:00] Amen don't think oh I got no worries
[1:37:03] with that I got no worries really
[1:37:04] because I don't know I'm not dealing
[1:37:06] with the devil Devils not dealing with
[1:37:07] me oh yes he is
[1:37:09] if you think that that with it that's
[1:37:12] proof that the devil is dealing with you
[1:37:13] cuz he made you think that oh yeah oh I
[1:37:19] don't have to worry through this I know
[1:37:20] he worried I didn't say you had to worry
[1:37:22] but let's be conscious of it we are more
[1:37:25] than conquerors hey man because Jesus
[1:37:29] laid down his life and he did this
[1:37:31] needed that he got the victory so our
[1:37:32] faith is in Christ well we're not going
[1:37:35] to ignore that you don't ignore it
[1:37:37] hey man but yet there are those that
[1:37:40] don't even stop the thing that's the
[1:37:41] truth they don't feel that they have
[1:37:44] anything wrong or they don't have any
[1:37:46] weakness you do there's not one here but
[1:37:50] you've got a weakness amen
[1:37:53] you better ask God to reveal it to you
[1:37:55] oh yeah
[1:37:57] what's your spiritual weakness Lord what
[1:38:00] is it what's my problem there that you
[1:38:02] got to deal with it you want to put me
[1:38:04] on my guard amen
[1:38:06] oh yeah there's not one you're even a
[1:38:10] prophet of God even the prophets have
[1:38:11] weaknesses oh yeah I don't care I don't
[1:38:15] care what they are who they are they got
[1:38:17] a weakness amen and brother I'll tell
[1:38:19] you this when Jesus was made flesh the
[1:38:21] word was made flesh brother he was made
[1:38:23] flesh for such a way so what he would
[1:38:24] experience those weaknesses yeah yeah
[1:38:28] the prophet of God said Jesus had a
[1:38:31] headache he had a headache yeah he had a
[1:38:35] headache he was bothered in his head he
[1:38:40] express eat mother he was tempted in all
[1:38:43] points like as we are yet without sin
[1:38:48] amen there's not one thing that we're
[1:38:52] tested with her tempted with but he
[1:38:54] experienced it amen he knows her brother
[1:38:58] he's here to help us amen he's there
[1:39:01] what for to get preeminence in a life
[1:39:05] that's worthy of the gospel hey man god
[1:39:10] help us and he said he was praying
[1:39:14] before he went into the end of the
[1:39:15] sermon and he said Lord I pray Lord
[1:39:18] these are taking this text he looked for
[1:39:22] Dean and he said is placed upon my heart
[1:39:25] he said to send out across the nation's
[1:39:28] and not just band Tabernacle this time
[1:39:30] but though but the world and he said
[1:39:34] for the people and he said that they
[1:39:36] might know he so what type of life is
[1:39:39] required of them to live a man and now
[1:39:44] it's not random tabernacles but it's all
[1:39:48] believers around the world he said that
[1:39:52] you might know what type of life to live
[1:39:54] and this is why God laid this on his
[1:39:56] heart is your life worthy of the gospel
[1:40:04] if it's worthy of the gospel you're
[1:40:06] surrendering to the word 24 hours a day
[1:40:09] a man you're running to the leadership
[1:40:12] of the Holy Ghost in your heart in your
[1:40:15] soul 24 hours a day amen and he said
[1:40:18] that they might know what type of life
[1:40:21] is required of them to live and he says
[1:40:24] so many people that have asked me is a
[1:40:26] Christian life a life of church service
[1:40:29] he said helping the poor the needy or is
[1:40:33] it a constant member he said is it
[1:40:35] loyalty to the church such questions and
[1:40:39] he said father
[1:40:41] he said the correct answer could may the
[1:40:43] correct answer come tonight through
[1:40:46] these words as we make in indifference
[1:40:50] he said to bring them these words to
[1:40:54] bring them to the people in the name of
[1:40:56] our Lord Jesus Christ and he read the
[1:41:02] scripture that we read a man I don't
[1:41:08] know if you got a highlighted in your
[1:41:09] Bible I've got a marked in mine here but
[1:41:15] I probably brought it right here
[1:41:17] concerning Luke 14 verse 16 to 24 he
[1:41:26] said did you notice this scripture he
[1:41:31] said did you notice he said there was
[1:41:34] three pulls a man everything God does
[1:41:39] every ministry there's three three poles
[1:41:42] like three is perfection
[1:41:45] five is grace 7 is completion there's
[1:41:51] seven Church ages amen they're seven
[1:41:54] seals seven there's seven that amen
[1:41:57] three is perfection father son Holy
[1:42:02] Ghost repent baptize in the name in
[1:42:06] water and then be baptized with the Holy
[1:42:08] Ghost amen
[1:42:09] see three is perfection God does this
[1:42:13] God does this and so on so he said did
[1:42:15] you notice there were three pools or
[1:42:18] three turns he said in this invitation
[1:42:21] to the marriage supper of the Lamb yeah
[1:42:25] and he said when they went out first and
[1:42:29] called them he said to where that they
[1:42:31] were bidden to come they didn't do it
[1:42:34] amen so they're without a healing
[1:42:36] campaign they went out he should to get
[1:42:40] the blind in the alt and still there
[1:42:42] were room so he said he went out and
[1:42:45] compelled the good the bad the
[1:42:46] indifferent to come amen
[1:42:48] it was the evening time of the three
[1:42:51] pools a man and they refused to come and
[1:42:59] he said they went out a healing campaign
[1:43:01] and it still it didn't bring them to the
[1:43:04] word no see the prophet of God was told
[1:43:11] when he was given those signs
[1:43:13] now I said get the people to believe
[1:43:17] amen
[1:43:19] because he was going to he what he was
[1:43:21] going to get their attention to his
[1:43:25] ministry to the signs and to the wonders
[1:43:27] to this gift and to that gift and then
[1:43:30] he was to get them to what if the third
[1:43:32] pole was to take him to the word but
[1:43:35] they didn't want the word as I said as
[1:43:38] one one evangelist told the prophet of
[1:43:40] God stop preaching those things stop
[1:43:44] preaching they stop preaching that and
[1:43:45] the Prophet got yeah well of well-known
[1:43:48] evangelist hard to believe but he did
[1:43:50] yeah the prophet of God said no he said
[1:43:53] the the evangelist said
[1:43:55] let the pastors do it and the prophet of
[1:43:58] God said brother he said the pastors are
[1:43:59] not doing it so he said somebody got to
[1:44:01] do it amen
[1:44:06] so there are three polls right here and
[1:44:11] he sent his servant at supper time to
[1:44:14] say to them that were bidden come for
[1:44:17] all things are now ready the first poll
[1:44:20] a man but they turned it down so then
[1:44:26] they were sent out to get the others and
[1:44:29] his servant come and said it showed his
[1:44:32] Lord these things and then the master of
[1:44:34] the house
[1:44:34] being angry said to his servant go out
[1:44:38] quickly into the streets and lanes of
[1:44:41] the city and bring in either the poor
[1:44:43] the main the halt and the blind the
[1:44:47] second poll and they came a man and then
[1:44:52] they said they said still there's room
[1:44:55] maybe that's why you're here hey man
[1:44:59] that's the truth because brother the
[1:45:03] prophet went out and he was trying to
[1:45:05] get him to do this trying to get him do
[1:45:06] that and they wouldn't do it
[1:45:07] first pull a man then he said go out and
[1:45:11] call these call these the second poll
[1:45:13] and they came finally
[1:45:16] he said listen go out into the highways
[1:45:19] and byways and compel them to come in
[1:45:24] that my house may be full brother was
[1:45:29] that why where God found you out to the
[1:45:31] spiritual religious highways and byways
[1:45:34] a man yeah to bring to bring that
[1:45:39] finally to bring you to the soft
[1:45:42] marriage supper of the lay the third
[1:45:44] pole and brother I believe that we are
[1:45:47] in the third pole yeah we're in the
[1:45:51] final phase of the reveal word as I have
[1:45:54] already preached that the open the seals
[1:45:56] was what to bring us to the third pole
[1:46:00] of rapturing day by the grace of God
[1:46:04] why not to let us now to know what or
[1:46:07] show us this they open the mystery of

[1:48:43] the Spirit of God is moving from the
[1:48:44] Gentiles to the Jews oh yeah I know that

[1:48:51] we're hearing that I'm almost on a daily
[1:48:52] basis amen and brother what's going on
[1:48:55] in Israel and now and brother it's been
[1:48:58] 17 years and 70 well 71 years really
[1:49:03] since what since since Israel became a
[1:49:07] nation God said he was going to bring
[1:49:10] Israel back restore Israel God has done
[1:49:12] it it's 70 years yeah like I told you
[1:49:16] was 1948 and I told that all that
[1:49:19] happened in 48 and not even the World
[1:49:21] Council churches started 48 and this was
[1:49:24] started that was starting 48 and and I
[1:49:28] said Israel became a nation in 1948 and
[1:49:31] I reminded you too
[1:49:34] that your pastor was born in 1948 yeah
[1:49:36] so I'm the same age as Israel praise the
[1:49:40] Lord well that's good to be identified
[1:49:43] with that and the prophet of God started
[1:49:47] his worldwide ministry in 94 in national
[1:49:50] international ministry in 48 yeah amen
[1:49:55] thank God that he was in Newfoundland
[1:49:59] amen
[1:50:00] thank God the pillar fire was a
[1:50:02] Newfoundland a man and it was 25 miles
[1:50:06] from where I was living but I would I
[1:50:08] bet the time I would say I was only
[1:50:10] about five years old yeah just just a
[1:50:13] young boy not knowing that a prophet was
[1:50:16] was he'd get in Gander yeah I was just
[1:50:19] 25 miles east of the end
[1:50:22] praise the Lord not knowing that that
[1:50:25] many years later or maybe fifty years
[1:50:29] later that I would come to the
[1:50:30] revelation that god it's been a prophet
[1:50:33] amen brother brother Baron said in this
[1:50:38] scripture he said you notice there was
[1:50:39] three poles and three turns of it and he
[1:50:43] said when they were now first and called
[1:50:44] to them that were bidden to come they
[1:50:46] didn't do it so they went out a healing
[1:50:49] campaign and they went out to get the
[1:50:51] blind and the alt and he says still
[1:50:53] there was room so they went out and
[1:50:55] compelled the good the bad and
[1:50:57] indifferent that they should come here
[1:51:00] praise the Lord
[1:51:01] so brother sister you read another
[1:51:05] parable of this or something order of it
[1:51:07] and he said and I drew this subject is
[1:51:10] your life worthy of the gospel and he
[1:51:15] said Jesus air is sane man has always
[1:51:18] tried to make excuses not to receive
[1:51:22] God's word of his invitation and he said
[1:51:26] though it be firmly proven to them that
[1:51:29] it's is supper and is invitation but man
[1:51:33] is constantly making excuses and brother
[1:51:36] I've experienced that over the over the
[1:51:38] over the years man is making excuses not
[1:51:43] to do this not to do that I don't have
[1:51:45] to do this I don't have to do that I
[1:51:46] don't think the Lord mind says I don't
[1:51:48] think the Lord minds that where's one
[1:51:50] time brother there was no question no
[1:51:52] what so ever
[1:51:53] as I told her brother one time and when
[1:51:56] there I felt that they were they were
[1:51:58] sort of I won't say what it was but like
[1:52:05] I said I did I did call them on the
[1:52:07] phone
[1:52:07] and I told my so you should not have
[1:52:10] done that I said because I said you're
[1:52:13] going to cause the people to do this
[1:52:14] you've got to cause believers to do that
[1:52:16] and so on and because they're what
[1:52:20] they're making light of this teaching of
[1:52:22] the Prophet make light of that teaching
[1:52:24] of the Prophet and the finally they're
[1:52:25] going to go out and they're going to
[1:52:26] they're going to compromise further on
[1:52:30] this teaching compromise on that
[1:52:32] teaching amen and I said brother don't
[1:52:35] do that and forgot that thought but I
[1:52:40] was going to say but and I've had to
[1:52:46] correct other others as well for things
[1:52:48] that they were making making they were
[1:52:50] compromising on and I said you're going
[1:52:52] to cause believers I said to get to get
[1:52:54] not not to take a stand
[1:52:56] eisah for that teaching I said you
[1:52:58] shouldn't have done it I said don't do
[1:53:01] that and I said no I said you're going
[1:53:05] to cause believers I said many of them
[1:53:07] are going to compromise I said he won't
[1:53:10] stay with the work and brother even the
[1:53:14] day this man there's many compromising
[1:53:16] you know why because it only put the
[1:53:18] emphasis on on a certain teaching or
[1:53:20] doctrine of the Prophet not necessarily
[1:53:24] on a life that is worthy of the gospel
[1:53:26] you can believe the doctrine but still
[1:53:29] not have a life that's worthy of the
[1:53:31] gospel that's right as I said it's just
[1:53:33] the Creed sure brother
[1:53:36] God's looking looking for a life that's
[1:53:39] worthy of the gospel not to make excuse
[1:53:44] don't make excuses and he said but man
[1:53:48] it's constantly making excuses and he
[1:53:51] said if you ready something out of
[1:53:53] Matthew 22 he says you'll find that the
[1:53:55] excuses were all made there and also and
[1:53:59] he should I went back into all ages I
[1:54:03] went back into the age and said a man
[1:54:05] bid and add a vineyard and he said we
[1:54:08] find that at that parable how he said
[1:54:10] his servants to collect from this
[1:54:12] vineyard a man but what did they do they
[1:54:18] killed the servants they didn't respect
[1:54:21] them and to find he said I'll send my
[1:54:25] son and he killed the son because he was
[1:54:29] going to inherit all things yeah they're
[1:54:33] killing the servants now around the
[1:54:35] message yeah you can kill the son the
[1:54:41] inflow
[1:54:41] of the Sun and then surely it's not a
[1:54:45] lot you haven't got a life that's worthy
[1:54:46] of the gospel please let's be sure just
[1:54:50] make our calling election sure listen
[1:54:52] let's be sure that you're not going to
[1:54:54] have a wrong spirit and a wrong attitude
[1:54:56] toward toward this brother toward that
[1:54:59] sister no keep your spirit right keep
[1:55:01] your attitude right amen and then you
[1:55:04] don't condemn them probably gosh you
[1:55:06] don't find fault with them because there
[1:55:07] goes you but for the grace of God he
[1:55:16] said the King finally said his son and
[1:55:20] when his son came we find out they said
[1:55:24] this is an heir and he said we will kill
[1:55:26] him and then we'll have all things
[1:55:29] brother yeah any ministry is going to
[1:55:32] stay with the word they're going to kill
[1:55:33] that ministry kill the influence of that
[1:55:37] ministry be careful yes you'd be guilty
[1:55:40] of kept of crucifying Christ and he said
[1:55:48] but the king he said he sent forth and
[1:55:51] he slew those murderers and said and
[1:55:53] burned their City a man god help us he's
[1:55:59] there's nothing left he said after mercy
[1:56:02] is spurned one thing left is judgment
[1:56:05] and he said you step over the boundaries
[1:56:08] of mercy then there's only one thing
[1:56:10] left and that is judgment and we find
[1:56:12] man has done that in all ages a man he
[1:56:17] spurned mercy and God sent judgment he
[1:56:21] said what is the problem he said it is
[1:56:23] modern thinking excuses
[1:56:27] he said they laughed and scorned Noah
[1:56:31] according to their modern thinking it
[1:56:34] didn't it wasn't the way they wanted it
[1:56:37] so they made excuses in the days of Noah
[1:56:39] they made excuses in the days of Moses
[1:56:42] they made excuses in the days of Elijah
[1:56:44] and they made excuses in the days of
[1:56:46] Christ and they make excuses today and
[1:56:50] they are not experience of four years
[1:56:52] you talk this and talk that and there
[1:56:55] make excuse make excuse make excuse or
[1:56:57] do try to explain it away and all God
[1:57:00] have mercy brother as I said this is not
[1:57:03] but not the generation of believers that
[1:57:08] I first came to the message but 1966
[1:57:13] does get their belief true believers are
[1:57:15] getting fewer and fewer and fewer some
[1:57:22] are getting more religious but less
[1:57:24] spiritual
[1:57:32] other things to do they find excuses a
[1:57:36] May I'm gonna have to skip some of this
[1:57:41] cuz it didn't want to continue with it
[1:57:48] he said now he said the same thing in
[1:57:51] the natural applies to the spiritual
[1:57:53] that he said if we as an irritants of
[1:57:55] eternal life and we hear the gospel and
[1:57:58] know that is true and we reject it and
[1:58:00] refused to do it or to listen to it we
[1:58:03] take well spirits on you he said it's
[1:58:09] the mark of the beast if you hear the
[1:58:15] gospel and reject it and refuse to
[1:58:19] listen to it he said you take on the
[1:58:22] mark of the beast see God Elvis he said
[1:58:32] you're a Richard miserable poor blind
[1:58:33] and naked and don't know the mark of the
[1:58:39] beast oh yeah that's why they put Christ
[1:58:42] down somebody
[1:58:46] there's going to be a mark of the beast
[1:58:47] it's going to come someday let me tell
[1:58:50] you it's already calm as soon as the
[1:58:56] Holy Ghost begin to fall the mark of the
[1:58:59] beast begin to take place that's true
[1:59:04] see you only have two things and one of
[1:59:08] them has accepted take the seal of God
[1:59:10] to reject it takes the mark of the beast
[1:59:13] the Bible said all that was not sealed
[1:59:16] by the seal of God took the mark of the
[1:59:18] beast now he said you see the mark of
[1:59:21] the beast if we talk about it in the
[1:59:23] future he said as when it's going to be
[1:59:26] made manifest when you realize it's what
[1:59:29] you've already done and so is the Holy
[1:59:32] Spirit he said it's to be manifested
[1:59:35] when we see the Lord Jesus coming in
[1:59:37] glory and he said then he said it'll be
[1:59:41] manifested to see those who rejected it
[1:59:45] a man will be left out he said didn't
[1:59:49] jesus said the Virgin's went out to me
[1:59:53] Christ some of them fell asleep the
[1:59:56] first watched a second a third the
[1:59:58] fourth the fifth the sixth the seventh
[2:00:01] but in the seventh watch then came forth
[2:00:04] the sound behold the bridegroom cometh
[2:00:07] go out to meet him and the ones that
[2:00:10] were sleeping awaken all the age back to
[2:00:14] Pentecost woke up a man he said from the
[2:00:17] seventh age the senator change all the
[2:00:21] way back through they woke up and those
[2:00:24] that were in this a church age he said
[2:00:26] living they were changed and they went
[2:00:29] in and at the very time they went in the
[2:00:32] sleeping words in come and said we want
[2:00:34] to buy it buy some of your oil but they
[2:00:38] said we just got enough for ourselves go
[2:00:40] to them and sell it that sell it and
[2:00:42] while they were trying to receive this
[2:00:44] oil the bridegroom came and they missed
[2:00:47] the rapture amen
[2:00:52] god help us
[2:00:53] that will not realize too late
[2:00:57] remember the Provost said they're
[2:00:58] virgins yeah but are not wise virgins
[2:01:05] so are we wise virgins so that we're
[2:01:08] going to stay with the word amen
[2:01:11] are we worried as virgins that we're
[2:01:14] looking for the resurrection the rapture
[2:01:16] and believing we're entering into the
[2:01:18] revelation of it more and more and more
[2:01:20] till one day we experience the reality
[2:01:24] the revelation becomes flesh god help us
[2:01:30] brother grace that will be wise virgins
[2:01:35] and not foolish now the way I'm not
[2:01:39] saying that like I said the wise I don't
[2:01:41] believe the wise virgins are lost but
[2:01:43] they go to the great tribulation lay
[2:01:46] down their lives god help us that will
[2:01:52] have the extra oil that we need in this
[2:01:57] hour to stay with the world
[2:02:00] amen the extra oil of Revelation by the
[2:02:05] grace of God he said those sleeping
[2:02:08] mergers are now trying to receive
[2:02:10] Pentecost trying to receive the Holy
[2:02:12] Ghost and don't the people realize that
[2:02:14] it will not happen according to the Word
[2:02:16] of God and while they were trying to
[2:02:19] come back the bridegroom come and took
[2:02:21] away the bride amen and they were cast
[2:02:25] into outer darkness for judgment because
[2:02:29] they rejected their invitation and all
[2:02:31] peoples are bidden to come God in every
[2:02:34] age as sent out is like it's been
[2:02:36] rejected and now today is no different
[2:02:38] from the any other day don't put it off
[2:02:42] till next year don't put it up to the
[2:02:44] next revival or we'll get into some
[2:02:49] thoughts on revival don't put it off to
[2:02:52] the next revival
[2:02:55] might be the next sermon yeah don't get
[2:03:01] your revelation of revivals confused can
[2:03:07] we think oh there's gonna be a revival
[2:03:09] in like that like that like that
[2:03:11] no no the bride revival is different
[2:03:20] we'll get into it
[2:03:25] you're not gonna recognize the right the
[2:03:27] bride revival the bride will the
[2:03:31] brighter catch the revival thereby to be
[2:03:33] part of the revival hey ma'am my brother
[2:03:38] his name is not gonna be like the
[2:03:40] Pentecostal revival or the Methodists or
[2:03:42] the or the or the or the Lutheran amen
[2:03:46] no I'll share some thoughts with you
[2:03:49] honor and some quotes so he said that's
[2:03:54] the our today is the day of salvation
[2:03:56] and now he said the time has come that
[2:04:00] she rejects it and she's bored in the
[2:04:02] air with it all that she'll never hear
[2:04:05] it no he said listen Israel walked day
[2:04:18] and night by the pillar of fire and when
[2:04:21] the pillar of fire moved they moved the
[2:04:25] same thing he said Martin Luther saw it
[2:04:27] and what did he do he come out of
[2:04:29] Catholicism then he said Wesley saw it
[2:04:33] and moving away from there he said what
[2:04:36] did the light do it move right on again
[2:04:39] and he said Pentecost saw it and what
[2:04:42] did they do he said they moved out of
[2:04:44] Wesley Nazarenes and so forth and he
[2:04:47] said they built a little fence called it
[2:04:50] where oneness where Trinity were the
[2:04:53] United and all this what did he do God
[2:04:56] move right on out of it because the
[2:04:59] Pentecostal revival started and out of
[2:05:02] after three years out of that out of the
[2:05:06] Pentecostal revival came the United
[2:05:08] Pentecostal revival they went off
[2:05:13] oneness what made them different from
[2:05:16] the regular Pentecost they were oneness
[2:05:19] they didn't believe in the Trinity yeah
[2:05:22] and the Trinity they went off the other
[2:05:27] way yeah brother no no he the prophet of
[2:05:35] God said even even the United
[2:05:37] Pentecostals he said their revelation of
[2:05:39] the God it is not right yeah we know
[2:05:43] there's one God there's not three
[2:05:45] persons and so on
[2:05:47] but he said even they in their
[2:05:49] revelation he said it's just just not
[2:05:51] exactly according to the scripture amen
[2:05:55] he said God moved right on out of it
[2:05:58] that's right and that is the absolute
[2:06:01] truth he moved out of the Pentecostal
[2:06:04] revival he moved out of the United
[2:06:06] Pentecostal revival a man and God moved
[2:06:09] on I died I've got some notes there but
[2:06:13] then I've had years ago that I preached
[2:06:15] on yeah well we will leave that right
[2:06:18] now brother he's gone into the bright
[2:06:21] revival hey man
[2:06:25] he said we've got to follow everyday we
[2:06:31] got to follow every hour of the day
[2:06:33] every step of the way
[2:06:35] he said we got to be led by the Lord
[2:06:36] Jesus Christ if we don't we take an
[2:06:39] organizational life and whether I tell
[2:06:43] you a lot of believers got an
[2:06:44] organizational life they really got a
[2:06:47] denominational spirit on them you know
[2:06:52] they live like denomination act like
[2:06:55] denomination talk like denomination oh
[2:06:57] my god Elvis he said a leg that doesn't
[2:07:02] follow Christ daily is not worthy of the
[2:07:06] gospel you got to follow Christ daily
[2:07:11] his car is Christ in control of your
[2:07:14] life morning noon and night
[2:07:16] if Christ in control of your life
[2:07:18] thought word and deed amen he said they
[2:07:27] take
[2:07:27] the world and that don't belong to the
[2:07:31] Church of the Living God he said when a
[2:07:34] nod to look to Jesus Christ and you
[2:07:36] ought to look to Sarah and them of the
[2:07:39] Old Testament they may God's grace a
[2:07:54] Christian is to be christ-like a
[2:07:57] Christian cannot be a Christian until
[2:08:00] Christ comes into the man the laborer
[2:08:03] Christ in him then he said it produces
[2:08:07] the life of Christ of that of that
[2:08:10] Christ lived and you do the things that
[2:08:13] Christ did what am I talking about he's

[2:10:18] to finish with this just some wonderful
[2:10:20] quotes here
[2:10:31] he said Jesus of
[2:10:34] after death for you he was not fussy and
[2:10:39] when they Schmitt on his face he said he
[2:10:43] didn't spit back and when they pulled
[2:10:46] his beard out he didn't pull that
[2:10:48] there's yeah do we have that spirit yeah
[2:10:55] are you there ready to flick back at
[2:10:59] somebody if they if they're a bit
[2:11:01] negative to you yeah
[2:11:05] no no you got the Spirit of Christ you
[2:11:08] want he opened not his mouth just think
[2:11:14] all that he went through all that he
[2:11:16] endured and he was God he said he could
[2:11:18] have called 10,000 angels to destroy the
[2:11:21] world and set him free but no what would
[2:11:23] you do well if I could do this and I
[2:11:27] could do that yeah what would you do and
[2:11:30] you got the Spirit of Christ you're
[2:11:31] gonna do what Christ would do oh well
[2:11:34] well I wouldn't do this I wouldn't do it
[2:11:36] wait a minute he was he was tested
[2:11:40] through his life he was tested at
[2:11:42] Calvary and you're tested in your
[2:11:45] everyday living it might be an
[2:11:50] individual it might be issues and my
[2:11:52] certain things that happened in your
[2:11:53] life and you're tested just to see oh
[2:11:55] you're going to act and react you're
[2:11:57] tested to see oh you're going to respond
[2:11:58] and you can respond as Jesus did now you
[2:12:05] want to spawn with the Spirit that Jesus
[2:12:07] had amen look look how we responded to
[2:12:13] Judas he wasn't he didn't he didn't get

[2:12:39] one piece of silver they've betrayed
[2:12:41] Jesus more yeah
[2:12:44] god help us or they betray Jesus oh my
[2:12:51] what if God asks you to sacrifice a
[2:12:53] relationship with somebody will you do
[2:12:56] it
[2:12:59] yeah because sometimes our relationship
[2:13:02] with Jesus cut cuts off our relationship
[2:13:05] with with somebody else it's not that
[2:13:09] you want it it's just it just happens
[2:13:11] but your Lord not my will don't be done

[2:15:12] you he was full of faith why he noticed
[2:15:19] words wouldn't couldn't fail and he said
[2:15:22] he so lived by the word till he became
[2:15:25] the word Oh God

[2:15:54] intelligence

[2:16:48] you what the Provost said concerning the
[2:16:53] rich young ruler they see even though
[2:17:04] they
[2:17:05] Christiane's they love to hold to the
[2:17:06] creeds and he said a man that's going to
[2:17:09] be a success in this day has to go with
[2:17:12] this modern trend of thinking and let me
[2:17:14] say that good and clear he said you're
[2:17:16] going to be a success you have to go
[2:17:18] with the modern thinking of this day and
[2:17:21] he should they go down and say oh isn't
[2:17:23] he a darling isn't he wonderful he can
[2:17:26] just there stay there so straight and he
[2:17:28] never keeps us over 15 minutes not me
[2:17:35] listen and he said our pastor he said
[2:17:39] don't always brawl us out about these
[2:17:42] things
[2:17:43] he says shame on that pastor any man
[2:17:48] that can stand in the pulpit and look
[2:17:50] upon the sin of this day and not cry out
[2:17:53] he said there's something wrong with
[2:17:55] that man he's not worthy of the gospel
[2:18:00] that he claims to be preaching amen
[2:18:03] that's true god help us
[2:18:08] he said did
[2:18:10] to say he said where the carcasses there
[2:18:12] the Eagles will be gathered together
[2:18:14] Eagles he said not buzzards Eagles he
[2:18:18] said where the sloppiest and the carrion
[2:18:20] and he's sure then the buzzards gather
[2:18:22] but where the fresh clean meat is Eagles
[2:18:25] gather certainly where the word is eagle
[2:18:29] food they'll gather so they don't come
[2:18:33] to the spiritual feast that they are
[2:18:35] invited to do you believe that God has
[2:18:37] give give America an invitation the last
[2:18:40] 15 years to a great revival to a
[2:18:43] spiritual face did they come no sir than
[2:18:47] to reject to come is that life worthy
[2:18:50] the gospel though they call themselves
[2:18:52] that no he said what it where is your
[2:19:00] treasures do you want to be some great
[2:19:03] somebody and he said if you are your
[2:19:06] nobody
[2:19:07] he says you get to a place till you
[2:19:09] don't want to come to me a great
[2:19:11] somebody you want to be a humble little
[2:19:13] servant of Christ that's the way out a
[2:19:16] man
[2:19:28] he said I hear something
[2:19:31] brother venom you better back up on that
[2:19:33] statement he said the people are not
[2:19:36] neurotics he said this people is not
[2:19:38] neurotics they're only educated but the
[2:19:41] prophet of God said they are educated
[2:19:44] new writings and he said I want to ask
[2:19:49] you a question
[2:19:50] please explain their actions of today if
[2:19:52] they're not neurotics he said tell me
[2:19:55] what makes them act like they do if
[2:19:56] they're not neurotics he said every
[2:19:59] fellow is pulling for his denomination
[2:20:01] he is greedy he said when the gospel of
[2:20:09] Jesus Christ can be preached and proved
[2:20:12] the God of heaven in the form of his
[2:20:14] pillar of fire wave over the people so
[2:20:17] that Jesus Christ is in the last session
[2:20:20] of his coming he said giving them the
[2:20:24] last sign a man he said yes they are
[2:20:28] neurotics highly educated
[2:20:31] degrees college he said we put some time
[2:20:34] on it more time on education and
[2:20:36] educating our children he said to
[2:20:38] algebra biology then we have to the
[2:20:41] Bible and Jesus Christ and the churches
[2:20:44] endorsed it when the Bible condemns it
[2:20:48] he said his the ministry neurotics yes
[2:20:51] educated neurotics amen
[2:21:01] I was looking for a certain quote there
[2:21:09] with me by the battlements referring to
[2:21:17] the rich young ruler and that he was
[2:21:24] putting the emphasis on money yes he
[2:21:27] said he was he was a religious man and
[2:21:32] to a certain extent he was spiritual
[2:21:34] jesus said have you kept this and kept
[2:21:36] this and kept this yes he said I've kept
[2:21:38] that except my youth
[2:21:39] she's my youth he said I kept it all and
[2:21:43] that's more than I you can see here I
[2:21:44] can say but brother Brown said what did
[2:21:46] he do he said he was putting the
[2:21:48] emphasis more on he said on the letter
[2:21:50] of the word he was putting more dances
[2:21:52] on on natural family than on spiritual
[2:21:55] and he said he didn't want he didn't
[2:21:58] want to change his relationship with his
[2:22:00] natural family no no he didn't want he
[2:22:03] said the gospel to interfere with his
[2:22:05] relationship with his natural family he
[2:22:08] wanted to maintain that and that's why
[2:22:11] that he refused when Jesus said come
[2:22:13] follow me because there's anything you
[2:22:17] have a separate problem is your natural
[2:22:18] family why because the emphasis is now
[2:22:21] put on your spiritual family a man not
[2:22:25] that you're going to despise your
[2:22:27] natural family it's not that you all you
[2:22:28] didn't want nothing to do with them no
[2:22:29] no no but you're gonna give preeminence
[2:22:32] more premise to your spiritual than to
[2:22:33] your natural and he brings that out in
[2:22:38] this in this message here somewhere
[2:22:48] something one time of a life worthy
[2:22:51] let's compare the life of st. Paul he
[2:22:54] said to the rich young ruler and he said
[2:22:58] the same light struck both man both had
[2:23:02] the same invitation from Jesus Christ he
[2:23:05] said is that right and he said they both
[2:23:07] were was well trained in the scriptures
[2:23:10] they were both theologians and Jesus
[2:23:14] told the rich young ruler keep the
[2:23:15] commandments and he said I have done
[2:23:17] this from my youth and he was a trained
[2:23:20] man and so was st. Paul both were well
[2:23:24] trained in the scriptures and he said
[2:23:26] both of them had the word and he said
[2:23:28] one added from a knowledge and the other
[2:23:31] one added the germ of life and he said
[2:23:35] that light flashed across in front of
[2:23:37] Paul and he said Lord who are you and he
[2:23:40] said I am Jesus he said earlier I am he
[2:23:43] said he was ready and he said the light
[2:23:46] struck bold man and he said one was
[2:23:50] Dermott eyes and the other was not and
[2:23:52] he said that's the way it is today
[2:23:53] there's a church spiritual and a church
[2:23:56] natural and he said the rich man and his
[2:23:59] excuse he said he couldn't do it he said
[2:24:03] he was too weighed down with too many
[2:24:05] friends of the world and he said he
[2:24:09] didn't want to quit associating and
[2:24:12] that's what's the matter with a lot of
[2:24:15] people today here's a lot that don't
[2:24:20] want to cut out relationships they
[2:24:23] didn't want to do want to lose this
[2:24:24] didn't want to lose that you know
[2:24:26] there's sometimes God will let you go
[2:24:28] over here let you do this late to do
[2:24:29] that there's other two other times that
[2:24:31] God wants to cut it because he knows
[2:24:33] that the emphasis is not what it should
[2:24:35] be
[2:24:35] amen that that that that relationship is
[2:24:39] more important than their relationship
[2:24:40] with Jesus yeah and that's when he wants
[2:24:44] to cut it nothing against them it's it's
[2:24:49] his see
[2:24:51] creig deceit his sons his daughters yeah
[2:24:55] he said he was too weighed down with too
[2:24:58] many friends of the world and he didn't
[2:25:00] want to quit associating and that's
[2:25:03] what's the matter with a lot of people
[2:25:06] today no you got to give more premise to
[2:25:13] Jesus a man when it comes to your
[2:25:17] relationship with others you let him
[2:25:19] control it you let him control you nor
[2:25:23] your will be done not mine
[2:25:24] oh yeah you pray for others I pray for
[2:25:27] them and so on
[2:25:29] oh yeah but then move on by the grace of
[2:25:33] God amen
[2:25:35] it says he had the rich man's life
[2:25:42] though he was a believer could you call
[2:25:45] that kind of a life amongst the
[2:25:46] intellectuals and entertainments he had
[2:25:50] to hear the entertainment and a beggar
[2:25:52] laying at his gate down there he gave
[2:25:55] his toast and talked about his great
[2:25:57] faith he had in God before daylight the
[2:26:00] next morning before the Sun come up he
[2:26:02] was in hell there's your intellectuals
[2:26:07] he said when Paul the light struck him
[2:26:09] he first took all his knowledge and he
[2:26:12] got away from the intellectual group and
[2:26:14] he walked in the spirit of Jesus Christ
[2:26:16] glory to God but as smart as he was he
[2:26:21] never even used big words thank God
[2:26:28] I'll finish with this quote now he
[2:26:34] the only way to live a life worthy is
[2:26:36] select Christ and his word which he is
[2:26:42] the word let Christ His Word reflect
[2:26:47] itself so perfect in you till God
[2:26:50] vindicates what he said in the word for
[2:26:53] Christ died that he might present
[2:26:55] himself before God a sacrifice and it
[2:26:58] turned back in the form of the Holy
[2:27:00] Spirit to reflect himself through his
[2:27:03] people to carry on his work reflecting
[2:27:06] himself through you to fulfill his
[2:27:09] promise word in those future days like
[2:27:12] John the Baptist heard when he heard
[2:27:14] Christ come amen and Christ walked that
[2:27:17] into the water and John said behold the
[2:27:20] lamb of God nobody else saw it but John
[2:27:23] saw it that light coming down from
[2:27:26] heaven like a dove and a voice saying
[2:27:29] this is my son in whom I am pleased to
[2:27:33] dwell Jesus walked out into the water
[2:27:38] Emmanuelle before a preacher that was
[2:27:42] supposed to be a radical but he walked
[2:27:44] out into the water before the people and
[2:27:46] said I want to be baptized of you amen
[2:27:51] grace of God he was the message of the
[2:27:54] hour we are he said we are the message
[2:27:57] of the hour amen
[2:27:59] so brother sister god help us let go let
