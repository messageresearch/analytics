Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's gone amen [Music] a man his name was called and his name is called him and God is bringing it from the past into the present by the grace of God as it was so shall it be it's Emmanuel day and it's Emmanuel now it was God with them it was God in them and it was God in Christ now it's Christ with us and Christ in us by the grace of God Amen brother I tell you the ministry of the hours of Malachi for ministry proved Immanuel a man as the father God stood many times behind the pulpit and said he said I can't do this he said I got to get out of the way so he can do it a man so he got out of the way so Jesus could do this and Jesus could could reveal the thoughts and intents of the heart Jesus could discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and you know what he did and he's still doing it a man through the Ministry of the word he's still doing it and we're praying tonight that's where the Ministry of the word through our brother George Smith the Lord is going to discern the thoughts and the intents of arts a man so I want you to be there pulling on the word a man if you wanted you have to pull on it by the great you have to have a hunger for it and a third sort by the grace of God amen no matter who was behind the bull but even if the Prophet himself were here a man you'd have to pull on the word the public God said he said you know I come out and stood in the bull but and the anointing wasn't in the in the congregation he said I did this to the preacher might as well just just get away from the bull be a man because why because what goes on here depends on what's going on there a man there has to be a hunger there has to be a thirst a man and God is going to respond to that hunger and respond to that thirst by ending the ministry anyway we're believing tonight that God is going to respond to your hunger your thirst and he could have known the ministry of our brother George Smith amen we thank God for for sending Allah to minister to us the the son-in-law of the Prophet amen we thank God for even even sending our sister ba baton see a man who and the prophet of God referred to the Fatah sees as his Italian friends a man from Chicago so we thank the Lord that he said our our sister to give her testimony hey man now he send them to the provinces a sunny Lord to give his testimony through the preaching of the word a man so let's be in prayer for our brothers word we certainly thank the Lord for sending our brother back to us again amen I believe this is the third time that our brother has come to minister to us he ministered to us an empire having you a man he's ministered to us here and now he's going to minister to us again by the grace of God so let's be in prayer for our brother as we get open the pulpit to him and let's let's pray that you're going to open your heart for the word amen praise the Lord and then what was that what's happening here is going to be a response to what's going on in your heart what's going on in your soul Amen it might be somebody online because because they're their brothers or sisters online because I J got a call just because just before I left home they wanted to know what time is the service because they because they wanted to tune in and I trusted they're there they they are they are tuning in tonight amen by the grace of God so let's be in prayer a man not only for ourselves for our brother here but also for those online by the grace of God and for those not able to make it tonight understand our brother John was sick so we pray the grace of God to him amen you know and all the other saints of God and we pray for our brother allocator a man we certainly miss our brothers fellowship and we miss his presence there in the service tonight so god bless our brother wherever he may be whether it's in Nova Scotia or maybe in Alberta so that God God's grace to him amen so we're going to turn the servers to our brother George thank God for our brother amen thank God for the ministry that he has given our brother amen so we pray that it'll be a to be according to the leadership of the Holy Ghost tonight a man responding to the hunger in your heart there's bonding to the thirst in your soul by the grace of God he going to give us what we have need of a man is not what we want is what we need a man sometimes becoming in the turn and I want this and I want a what God's going to give you what you need amen so let's let's be in in the spirit by the grace of God let go and let God have his way in your life by the grace of God let stand and we're going to sing only believe all things are possible only Billy amen let's believe God God is with us that was with us God is with us he was with the property was in the property but he took the profit now he's with you and he's with the bride and he's in the bride the Provost said the fullness of the Godhead bodily is now in the bride a man and his sobriety on getting rid the bride ready Alleluia to get at a time into eternity amen so god bless our brother tonight as we turn the pulpit to him for the going forth of the word only Billy all things are possible [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you Jesus hallelujah [Music] as our brother comes [Music] [Music] [Music] let's look the Lord in prayer my precious Heavenly Father were so thankful to be here one more time thank you Lord that you've made this possible that you've arranged the details or there's many places that we could be and there's many congregations but you've got us here father we're just thankful to be in fellowship with like-minded believers pray that you anoint your word help us Lord to speak only what's truth Lord than me we may go from here better than when we came in bless each one Lord we ask in Jesus name Amen you may be seated it's good to be back in the what I call the edge of the universe out here but what's amazing to me is you can travel this far and they still speak English it's usually with another language by the time you go that far but we're glad to be here and thank God that there's saints that are staying true to the word that's that's not true everywhere recently I was over in Africa in Malawi which is small country just west of Mozambique and so it's a very poor country it's not a first world country by any means but they had invited us over for a few days and we had some tremendous meetings I was there ten days we had 14 services so this is restful here it's compared to that but the they've done a good job the brothers have have spread the gospel and they're doing doing great work we were in one service where they had like 700 people and they didn't have benches like these there wasn't any cushion and there wasn't in the back just bored did you sit on so nobody goes to sleep in that church and they had one keyboard and two lights and that was service but they sang in time and they sang beautifully so we had a good time in another place we saw where that people weren't turning to the Bible you know with the translator had a Bible so I knew they had it in their language but the people didn't have Bibles none so we've come to find out that a lot of the homes just did not have a Bible in their home so we checked with the local Bible story yeah we got Bibles and three or four languages and so we got a list from the pastor you know so that there would be one Bible for home and we're gonna give everybody about well it's impossible but we promise to to try to get a Bible for each home so think at least how do you preach the people don't have a Bible you know and so we got the list and the Bibles were like ten dollars a piece or something nice nice Bible from their language well now we're not going to fuss about whether it's King James or that's not important the fact is they have scripture in their language and God speaks to them in their language so as far as I know it's a great translation and we were able to supply know that need and then there's another one over a little farther people couldn't get there but I also checked with the local brother in charge of you know the distribution of books oh no we don't have anymore church age books well that's too bad so we're gonna print some in South Africa and get them over there because some of them speak English and some of them speak the local local language which is chicha Wow that means nothing to you but did you see God loves variety you know he's got a little bit of each kind of person to ministers word so anyway that's where we were recently and other places but God knows what he's doing and he's got us here to listen and see if we can learn something so in these three services we're going to see how far we can get into the book of Acts the book of Acts is the only book that's not finished all the other books come to a conclusion but the book of Acts has been going on you're part of the book of 21st century and it's not really the book of Acts of the Apostles it's book of Acts it's the book of the Holy Spirit acts of the Holy Spirit in the lives of early believers because these are this is a summary and all these details of what was going on and so keep your keep your Bible handy because we're gonna go into some some details of the book of Acts and you can make notes you can you know study it and this is designed to make you want to go in and read your Bible and confirm these details and see what else God has for you but it's very foundational because sometimes we've got to go back and see why do we believe this why why did we do these things you know so the writer of this book is brother Luke he was a beloved physician and he was a doctor of a high level Greek citizen he was a writer and he accompanied Paul on a lot of his missionary journeys he did a lot of the writing Paul did the speaking and so he's believed that Luke actually wrote a lot of the New Testament and of course we have the other point that we got to make here that we have the argument today well you know that church age book I don't know it sure looks like somebody else well yeah because brother branham didn't have you know grammar like you that graduated from high school in college but we always think of the book of Romans as you know oh yeah Paul wrote the Romans uh everybody agrees on that well if you look at Romans 16 and what is it verse 22 I turn to us who wrote this epistle salutes you in the Lord so even back there we have the author and the writer so end of argument so you might think well why is this important we thought you just going to come over here and bring us a revival no the revival is in you it's in the word it's reviving what you have so we're just trying to let you see where we came from that we're part of this this family and we're here at the end time the world is falling apart and the resurrection is imminent well you see in brother Browns ministry he had a visitation with you which he called beyond the curtain of time and of course what we like to remember is the beautiful girls was along here and the crystal eyes and the nice white teeth and all that but he did say that everything was beyond perfect he didn't have word to describe it and so then when it got down to the fact that he's got to be judged for what he said then he didn't have to start biting his fingernails well I wish I could go back and erase something like I would know he just said well what about Paul well he'll be judged for his message also and so immediately brother Bram said well then there's no problem I preached what Paul preached and all of us that were there we said we're depending on that we're not depending on whether he got Mary's name right or whether this or that all these details people arguing about he preached what Paul preached and so we're totally with the green light to go in and see how this church started what did Paul preach how did we get to where we are today and so we are a vital part of God's program you're out here other people are farther west and there's other people in London and all these places around the world but no one is gonna go in the rapture without the baptismal Holy Ghost you're not gonna be going anywhere it's got to be in you and divine love reflecting daily and that is why we come to church to see what's missing you know when you when you go get ready for church you look in the mirror you know to see what's everything's in place now see I don't need a narrative mirror to call my hair like you know these sisters do but those of you that have to look in the mirror it's important that you have a clean mirror well this mirror is always clean all we're trying to do is hold it at the right angle so you can see yourself you know and so we have the the fact that brother Branham says back to the word over 200 times well then might be important that we go back to the word another place he says I think we're not getting people to Christ no we're getting people to a theory we can't we have brand mites and then we got we got people that are they're only good to argue about oh you left out the thaw and you should have said this look we're not in the start here we come here to worship God and to see what's missing so Luke became a disciple not an apostle a disciple as they follow her okay well Jesus was on earth he had 12 disciples and apostles one that it sent out a missionary like an axe one and eight Luke accompanied Paul the great missionary and the original disciples were mostly fishermen and many of them couldn't even sign their name so when you go looking and reading in 1st to 2nd Peter okay that's that's kind of what he said but those aren't his exact words because he didn't speak like that they edited it to where you could understand what he was saying but they were fishermen one was a tax collector one was a revolutionary Simon the zealot he was a fanatic that's all in chapter 10 of Matthew so these eleven disciples they became apostles okay and they were ordinary man the God used in extraordinary ways to spread the gospel they and they were endued with power early in chapter 2 that we'll get to that before you get too excited there's most of you probably know there's 28 chapters in the book of you know the Acts we won't get to all those chapters in these three days so wherever we get to we'll just say ok continued and we'll come back another time but these these people that we're going to talk about these were God's choice okay and it all worked out a lot of times we look at situations why is God using him why didn't he use me and that kind of stuff well god knows what he's doing you know there's a scripture in Psalms 46:10 be still that means just zip it we don't need your opinions be still I'm God I got it all figured out you know so extraordinary acts the Holy Ghost in ordinary people so we're going to see and there were people just like us okay they were filled with God's power Christ in spirit form showed them how to apply their faith and we can learn we can repeat and you know memorize but we don't have the the grace to make it live it's just more words see so God still in business today he's still changing lives filling believers to live through dark Laodicea okay so this was originally a letter that dr. Luke wrote to his pagan friend Theophilus a great wealthy Greek man in order to give the complete narrative of Jesus life his works and his teachings and thereby proved that Christianity is the only true religion okay and it is for everyone no matter what the class or position of life but not everyone is interested to receive it because jesus said what oh here in John 3:16 just read it here quickly and John 3:16 where he says for God so loved the world that's the Pope's favorite Scripture Oh Oh world yeah everybody's welcome ok then we've got another part of the verse then He gave His only begotten Son you notice Mary's not mentioned there didn't give Mary he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he who believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God then name there's a whole teaching right on that and we're gonna see some of that in our study here but the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts are a two volume set that are written maybe 30 years after the resurrection and of course dr. Luke being a cultured highly trained Greek citizen he spoke in the classic Greek style another point that you're going to notice is the Holy Spirit is referred to more than 50 times in this one book either the Holy Ghost the spirit relation to the baptism the Holy Spirit or being filled with Holy Spirit or being led by the Holy Spirit it's all part of this and of course that's the message that carries over to our day we must have the holy spirit or you will stay behind guarantee aim okay no shortcuts there's no respect to persons no matter what your name is no matter who your grandpa is or anything there's one way to God no other way one way now in when you see the cross and I was looking for that you have a cross here somewhere well you know what the cross looks like there's a long part there's a short part okay now we take out the level to show you that the long part is your prayer life and as you continue if you keep a steady prayer life God will take care of the horizontal and keep you in balance hope it's good if not we got start there so God knows what he's doing and in verse 1 of chapter one the former treaties have I'm a daught the awfullest of all that Jesus began to both to do and teach so that's the Book of Luke until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost said given Commandments unto the Apostles whom he had chosen here's what he told him to whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God okay so this is the only mention that you're going to find in Scripture of the timeframe between the resurrection and the Ascension 40 days okay and we have our prophet that comes along now and he says can't you see that we're at the end time it's all over now this is 19 and 62 a long time ago the next thing will be the it will be a sweep that will get that little group together in a month or so she'll be gone as soon as she has gathered together we're at the end there's no hope stuff nowhere run to Christ and then he said somewhere else I think we're not quite getting people to Christ we're getting them to a arguing point maybe but the point is we got to make Christ's real to the people of our generation and in this case here we don't know what he said in those forty days I have no idea speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God so today let's not waste time and energy wandering out into the desert of speculation you know and wondering oh just leave it alone God's in charge to the details I've got too many friends that are so worried about what's going to happen over there they've ignored right here and their kids went to the world now they're worried oh why because you didn't have a proper atmosphere at home if we have things running through that home and provide the proper atmosphere of the word they're not gonna be running away and doing things no they're gonna stay here but so what we're so busy arguing about doctrine and things go just come back to the word you know so we just need to focus on getting to the door of the resurrection you know now verse four so we're going slow because so you can get it and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which he said ye have heard of me according to hear of him that's back in John 14 and and then verse five for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked him they had some questions they're talking with a resurrected being never happened before in the world and here they're talking to resurrected being and they said Lord will you restore again the Kingdom of Israel will you take the Romans off our back and and let us you know come into a peaceful Israel so after experiencing these these infallible proofs having close fellowship with the resurrected being and having meals together Lord this is wonderful but now are you are you gonna give her these guys you know that was the greatest question there were humans like us here they put they were blessed into the meetings they were blessed and yet they were worried about politics in the lom's uh Bible on if you ever heard of it but this is the Blom's of Bible okay let me give you a short explanation the Bible we have came from the Greek and Hebrew into Latin and then it came to German and he came to English and finally we ended up with King James Version where as alums of Bible came straight from the ancient text didn't come through German and so forth and the Spanish Bible came right from the Latin and they're all very similar but in verse 7 he says it is not for you to know the time or the times which the father has put under his own authority in other words it's none of your business what we would say today they should have understood by now that rebellion and retaliation against Rome was not the proper Christian attitude I should have been able to see that but rather faithfulness to the message of the hour and the lifestyle of the gospel and simply imitating the master that's what they should have understood by that you see so brother brems says over here and we're gonna be in dispersing you know parts of the message in here so that she can you know bring it to light but he says how we need in services well thousands of lived voices the thunder of God thundering out now that has been taken in such a bad context that we're trying to beat people in submission but he says thundering the the thunder of God thundering out in sweetness holiness purity undefiled lives walking around the earth today without a blemish that's the thunder of God yes sir real Christians that's the thunder against the enemy the devil doesn't care how loud you can holler he doesn't count how how high you can jump all these things what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to God that's how you hurt the devil it's not screaming and shouting say anything to this person call him anything he's just as sweet as can be moves right along that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil and that's what was going on in these lives fears were gonna see okay so verse eight he's talking to him still but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem that's right here in town or in Judea or in Samaria and to the other most part of the earth right here gospel didn't come in a pair of sheep people somebody became in a boat or a horse and brought it over here yeah so and then in verse 9 he disappears vanished into a cloud and they went and did what he said tarry in Jerusalem until you've received the power now you might be thinking well this is kind of shallow yeah it's very shallow because we got all kinds of Christians here we got a guy back here named Levi is probably not over what six years old huh seven small seven okay so there's all kinds of people so we have to bring it so that everybody can eat you see but we you know yeah but we're the bride we're up here in the top of the pyramid we're ready to blast off are you with all the stuff still going on you know and we want to hear the deep things of God well just listen you'll find something here but we don't want to be careful how we judge you know we have an entire library of prophetic recordings you can go there and hear all the mysteries and all the great things and it all points to Jesus Christ okay so that's what we got stay balanced okay and did you see not everybody had the same kind of breakfast or same kind of supper we don't even like the same kind of coffee do we all a little different see and not everybody came the same kind of car out there well we're not no we're not the Xerox machine here we're Christians from progress okay Bible tells us in first John three four this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another now we can try in this flesh but it's very a very automatic when you have the baptism all Holy Ghost and the baptism the Holy Ghost is not optional it's imperative if you want to be with us at the meeting in the air okay so Jesus leaves and these two angels appeared in verse 11 you men of Galilee why stand ye gazing into the heaven the same Jesus which is taken from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have see him go into heaven and from this first we have the private interpretation that the cloud of 1963 is the fulfillment of these words but that's nowhere on tape okay it's not stated anywhere let's stay with what we know that was brother brems vision it was for him and we're just trying to live our message today okay verses 12 through 15 they got together in the upper room Mary the mother was there the mother of Jesus yes his very family she was saintly she was obedient she was walking in the truth of the hour she was not arrogant selfish or demanding she was just an obedient lamb she's one of the believers and it really scares me when I see preachers that can't sit on the second row and say man they got a if they can't be up here they can stay home well that's not God's Way that's arrogant then in verse 12 we have what's called the Sabbath day's journey we could make a whole study on that but it's approximately 3,000 feet and there was a reason for that because they lived under the law there were strict things they could do and couldn't do the same and first Corinthians 15:6 he says he was seen about five hundred brethren at once at once so it's commonly understood that that's the 500 that was on the Mount of Olives and so I am go away you know we don't know but if that's the fact then only 120 actually made it to the Upper Room which is only 24% what happened to the others maybe they didn't take it serious because there's always been the twins you know and there's always been three kinds of believers you got the believers to take it serious such as you and those others that well you know it's Friday and we got to do this and go see grandma or whatever so we have all along we've had those things see so 76 percent didn't make it to the upper room now we've been to the upper room it might have been a little bigger at that time I don't know but there's not room for no 500 anyway so God knows what he's doing so that verses 15 through 25 they're discussing the facts of the death of Judas the traitor and here's where they were quoting from they're quoting from song 41 just bring that up real quick here so psalm 41:9 says yay my own familiar friend in whom i trusted which the deed of the my bread has lifted up his heel against me they were also remembering Psalm 69 25 where it says let there have let their habitation be desolate and let no let none dwell in their tents okay so the regard regarding the fact that this man died no one shall live there they knew their Bible the Bible they had back then was only the Old Testament and it was about a 200-year old translation that they were using and to this day that hillside where Judas died there nobody lives there Jerusalem is a city of 900,000 people but that is desolate nobody lives there because God's Word always says fulfillment see it's a field of blood and the rest of the chapter has to do with the replacement that they chose his name was brother Matthias and he was probably a good brother you know probably attended church regularly might even paid tithes but that's the last mention we have of him okay so they were all very human like we are just remember that they were humans like us they had the same kind of problems just maybe a little different but and brother Brennan was like us he was very human you know but the more that these people yielded to God the more he could use them brother Brennan was born a prophet but it was basically worthless until he yielded to the gospel you see so God can use you in your circle the dying generation and this is the only book that's not finished so God is still in business today you see just like in the book of Acts and we're living in the continuation of the same spirit manifesting through ordinary people that are yielded completely to Jesus Christ and Hebrews 13:8 is in effect it wasn't back there it's it's today you know he's living so get into chapter 2 verse 1 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord to one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues that's like split tongues of fire and what came down on each one of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance so this is day 10 of this wait he said go there and wait he didn't say how long he didn't give him an exact Clues what was going to happen but he will know when something happens so they're waiting up there 120 in prayer and one Accord in agreement seeking the promise of chapter 1 and verse 8 and this noise from heaven came and filled the house and fire appeared on each one and so forth so the church is launched at Jerusalem okay that was the Alpha church we are the Omega church and through seven ages through two thousand years we're now restored back to the original it took it took some you know dives and you see on the graph here where there's more light and less light and so forth but we're back to the original now God has fulfilled his word we're back with a prophetic message now in verse 5 there was people from every nation God's timing is always perfect okay don't you worry about the promises and the prophecies and so forth God is on time always and so they were gathered in Jerusalem for the feast of Pentecost now that was orders that they had from back in the Book of Leviticus chapter 23 where God's dealing with this chosen people he instituted seven feast sessions throughout the year and in three of these feasts all the men needed to come to Jerusalem to the temple okay they're required that's in Exodus chapter 23 so this is the feast of Pentecost or feast of harvest it's a celebration of six days and that's why all these people were in Jerusalem in the first place you see and so so they're over here or spring God and the only way they know you know by the Book of Moses and so forth and up here in their upper rooms he's hundred and twenty hiding out from fear that they're going to get stoned and God had it all planned out that during these six days these ten days would also be accomplished and they would come out into the street speaking languages that these people understood now back then these people were from different countries because the Jews went everywhere but most of the people were at least bilingual maybe three languages because they knew the language of the temple that was Hebrew they all spoke Hebrew but they also spoke the language where they come from and in the in the in the scripture here we have for at least 16 different languages that are together now they're speaking Hebrew in the temple but when they're out in the street and here comes these guys bouncing out of the upper room and they're speaking in the language of their countries but with a Galilee accent now you guys all know all about odd accents like mine right and so they were speaking stuff that these guys could understand but hey they're from Galilee they're Hicks they're unlearned you know and it's exactly the opposite of what happened in Genesis 11 dat the tower Babel over there they all spoke the same language trying to build this brick thing to get to heaven God confused their languages and that was in program you know but only God can do these kind of things so while Peter had their attention he launches into his first sermon in verse 14 maybe 30 minutes or less we don't know and he ends up over here in verse 36 of chapter 2 therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made that same Jesus whom you guys crucified both Lord and Christ led entirely by the Holy Spirit in this short sermon here and he did not beat them into submission he simply was faithful to the truth you see he didn't call for an immediate response but he offered them here in verse 37 now when they heard these things they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of them the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do what's the next step here and Peter said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and to all those afar off even as the many as our Lord our God shall call so this would look like it's in direct contradiction to what the Lord took told them over here in Matthew 28:19 just a few days before that and we're just going to take a few minutes on this now did I did I send you these tracts yet have you seen this everybody seen okay we have more but its history and scripture but Jesus told them over here very clearly just before he left and it wasn't you know 10 years it was just a few days ago when he's with them and he said over here in Matthew 28 all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go therefore teach all nations now make disciples out of people baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the son of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even to the end of the world a few days later first chance he gets with the microphone he comes up with this formula so I'm you know I'm not too far off base I don't thinking believing that there's one or two guys there Peter he just told us this I wrote it down he telling these people but it was the revelation of those words it was the reality and nowhere in all the book of acts until three hundred years later all that time they baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so it's the right way okay so verse 41 of chapter 2 and they they gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls well when I get to heaven I want to find Peter he's probably not real tall you know he's probably short kind of like brother Gerald now Peter now we got to solve this there's no River there's no lake in Jerusalem where did you baptize 3,000 people but they did so this small yielded band of believers and one day grew from 120 over 3,000 at the first gospel meeting God's in charge you know we can only speak the word it's up to you whether you receive it and let God do something you know Billy Graham said I have found that when the gospel of Jesus Christ is presented with Authority quoting from the very word of God he then takes that message and drives it supernaturally into the human heart only God can do that brother Brennan says preaching is God's program we we preached the truth honestly but God does the work in the human heart so you may not be gifted like Peter like some of these people you know that we're talking about but your life is preaching every moment well that's because you have the long hair or the short hair brothers be sure we thought we're talking about and I mean I think I mentioned this before francis of assisi was a gospel preacher about 900 years ago he said preach always use words when necessary oh yeah but we like to talk pontificate and tell all these things know just be still just live your message God will put the question in their hearts you know and so verse 42 and they continued steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came up on every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles this is a fear like we're afraid this just as reverence and all they believed were together and had all things in common and sold their print possessions and goods and part of them to all men as every man had need okay there was unity of purpose there was fellowship and that was God's program at that time okay some have tried oh let's let's sell everything and bring it all in oh that's not program so I've tried it God's prophet told him this will not work okay so verses 46 to 47 they went to church every day they met together daily in their homes he had all those fellowship they ate together they remembered the Lord and we're having communion because in Luke 22 as often as you do this they were doing it every day so says and the Lord added to the church daily he's in charge were only the instruments you see so brother Branham says very plainly over here he says I'm just a public servant of God to you the preacher is a public servant we are not the managers of God's bride but some brothers think they are well I'm not so we only follow the New Testament examples so like you said preaching is his program and the preaching goes out through many ways I mean here we are speaking to you know 20 people or less but it's going out to who-knows-where out there and the you know the internet and then they're gonna read a brother George said brother L got up and said and so it keeps bouncing around you know and radio is one way that we've tried it in America and it doesn't work people are not interested but in Spanish it works very well people are still listening and so we're sponsoring a broadcast it actually goes out tonight I think it's from 12:00 to 10:30 to 12:00 something anyway the originates down in Dallas Texas trying to minds in charge of all this and it's um it's going out and people are listening Americans are going to Canadians it up and a half bill the night listen to gospel but they do and it goes into prisons goes a lot of places and we can't go and some of the fruit of it I was you know gonna tell you this later but woman shot now there's a very famous person that was tried in New York in February and sent to prison out in Colorado they're all aware that well this man heard the gospel in prison and he liked what he heard and so he sat down word through his people he said hey let's see if there's some literature I want to read more about this so they sent him the book of the life story and it's got the drawing on the front Wow he believed it likes it he said you tell those people we need 10,000 copies for my people because he had before he went to jail he had 10,000 people they were armed and their job is to bring the drugs from the growers to the consumers the reason there's the drug problem is because there's consumers they've got I have they'll give me any money for that and so these people are just in business they're businessmen bring it across well we didn't have no 10,000 copy so we give him a memory stick and they go and print it with their money spend it on something good and they've printed other things the man is a believer he was raised in the Apostolic Church when he was young his mother was a figure in that an apostolic church she was a believer and so his mother's been baptized his wife been baptized his father-in-law's been baptized and he said as if they ever give me a little liberty why don't you guys come baptize her you've heard the name El Chapo well that's him he's a whole lot smarter than Al Capone ever was but he's just a businessman but he's on vacation now in Colorado but it's all because of the preaching of the gospel okay that's gonna do though what time I got here anybody in hurry to go Oh burl 8:30 okay chapter three and four kind of go together it's a five-part drama the power in the name of Jesus Jesus means Jehovah is salvation and we're not going to go through all of this but Act one of this five-part drama is verses 1 through 11 of chapter 3 it records the healing of the lame man at the gate beautiful now this gate is the golden gate it's the eastern gate it's been sealed up since 1541 in an effort by the non-jews at that time to prevent the Messiah from arriving like that's gonna stop God you know so Peter and John they went up to the temple to pray at the appointed time they went you know they believers arrive on time so they're up there at 3 p.m. and verse 2 and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried when they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask for money of them that entered into the temple now this man was born wrong like we would say we don't see that too much today but I have seen people that like brother of Al used to say if they're like spaghetti they had no muscle they just they're just there and that was one of them so they taking up every day he looks pitiful people giving him money so when this man saw Peter and John about to go into the temple he asked them for alms her money and Peter looking at any of you know fasting his eyes upon him said look on us so he pays attention expecting to receive something from them and Peter says we don't have any silver gold but what we do have we're going to give you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk he didn't just stand there and wait for the miracle he reached down and got him by the hand lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength he's never walked he's never had any muscle he has no idea of how to walk all of us from instant instant miracle now he's leaping up standing up walking went into it them to the temple walking and leaping praising God and all the people which knew about this guy for years saw that and that he was walking and praising God and they knew that it was him which had been sitting at the gate they were filled with Wonder in amazement at what had happened well yeah very amazed so that's part 1 1 a is where they're greatly wondering so when Peter saw that he had their full attention he preached a sermon number 2 and this is just a street meeting it's out in the open they're not inside the temple the temple is very small that's where the priest goes in now people out in the courtyard you know so they're out there in this courtyard who knows how many people are out there and so part two of the drama is where Peters sermon identifies Jesus with the I M of Israel's history because see they excuse me he could have titled it covenants will be fulfilled there's all these promises but they had to almost proved of the people this is the fulfillment everybody didn't understand that you know so verse 12 through 26 he he's preaching to them identifying Jesus as the I M of Israel's history and so it goes on because C prophets spoke words those words had to be fulfilled the manner smaller there will be a fulfillment and so in chapter 3 verse 12 we've got here and when Peter saw it he answered to the people hey you men of Israel why are you marveled with this or why are you looking on me as though we had done something you know by our holiness verse 13 the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob the god of Our Fathers which glorified His Son Jesus and see that he had to put it in there he could just leave it alone you know that God did sure worship glorified His Son Jesus whom you all delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him go but you denied the holy one the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the Prince of life whom God hath raised from the dead they couldn't handle that either we are the witnesses of that and his name through faith in his name had made this man strong tell me you now see the faith which is by him has given him his perfect soundness in the presence of you all and now brethren I wot that means I'm sure that through ignorance she did it as also did your father's but those things which God before had showed by the mouth of his holy prophets that Christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled in other words it's coming to pass right before your eyes all this was spoken back here it's it's going on right now in real time you know so prophet said it here's the fulfillment see salvation is by faith in the name of Jesus Christ repent you therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you he's looking at the future whom the heaven must receive or it is like in the Spanish Bible retained keep back until the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since the world began okay so here's here we are in this picture we're part of this restoration you see we're part of the same program and all he's waiting for is for people to repent get with the program understand what's God's doing and receive him so when we look at the bigger picture oh that's how it works yeah it's not your little narrow way of seeing things you see and where we've been turned back to the original we understand these things and so from verse 24 all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many have spoken have likewise foretold of these things y'all just don't know your Bible your children of the prophets and the Covenant which God made with your father's sitting under Abraham and in thy seed shall all the Kindred's of the earth be blessed unto you first God having raised up his sons Jesus sent him to bless you in turning every one of you from his iniquities well God has made a way you just gotta pay attention so simple now that takes us through part 2 of this five-part series that we're talking about but if you'll notice here where he says God sent him to you now back in and I think it's in Matthew 10 somewhere Jesus said only go to the house of Israel yet they're only dealing with with Jewish believers here sitting has it we're not gonna not gonna get Gentiles for a while so in in chapter 4 we have an as they spake under the people the priests and the captain of the temple the Sadducees came upon them in other words they came over to investigate what is going on here what's all this confusion you all think you're religious you bunch of ignorant fishermen being grieved ah they're upset that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead oh we got a problem these guys are talking about resurrection we don't believe in resurrection and and they laid hands on that's a nice way of saying they grabbed him and put him in jail till the next day before it was already you know sundown okay howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men only was about 5,000 and they didn't have microphones so they had to be quiet when their preaching is everybody could hear that's just the man or 5,000 big crowd might even 10,000 people just just preaching that little sermon sermon number two many believed okay so they spent the night in jail because they preached the truth to a very large crowd verse 5 and it came to pass in the morning that their rulers and elders and scribes and Anna's the high priests and all these people the high priest verse seven and when they had sent and when they had set them in the midst in other words they brought these two preachers in hey but what power what name have you guys done this huh well you don't ask a preacher a question unless you got qala listen you know they're not gonna give you a small answer so Peters defense starts in verse nine if we this day be examined of the good deed done to this impotent man by what means he's made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel in other words you know hey listen up it's by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you all crucified whom God raised from the dead they tell you all but it's the truth even by him that this man stand here whole before you this is the stone which has said it not by you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there's none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved so not in the name of Peter not a name of any of these other guys here preaching the name of Jesus Christ he never gave up an opportunity to put it on him because they did it well who else crucified him it was them as the religious people so part four thirteen through twenty two and when they saw the boldness of Peter this guy's pretty pretty bold and John and knew that they were unlearned and ignorant not only they did not know anything they were ignorant how were they coming up with all this stuff they marveled and they had to take knowledge that they had been with Jesus and and be holding the man which was healed standing on them they could not send it they didn't they weren't arguing whether the guy was healed or not he's healed but when they cut commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves so y'all will stand outside we're gonna have a little powwow here and we're gonna decide what to do with you guys because this is we can't have this going on as this is earlier this is changing everything you know and well shall we do to these guys for indeed a notable miracle has been done and here he is you know we can't deny that verse 17 but then it spread no further among the people let's threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name there it is again the name of Jesus Christ has power it's not just anything and they call them commanded them not speak or teach in the name of Jesus but Peter you know he had a bit of a mouth probably he just couldn't keep quiet you know whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than God well you'll be the judge of that we can only speak that which we've seen and heard so when they had further and threatened dama they let him go and they had no reason to punish him because of the people aha see because the people they knew that they made their life difficult all these I mean just in that one meeting was over 5,000 people there's another 3,000 he got baptized so they had all these people believing they want get stoned so they had to be real careful how they went about this for all men glorified God for that which was done for the man was above 40 years old he'd been laying the gate for 40 years and all of a sudden he's walking you know so they they knew what they were doing they were led by the Holy Ghost so part 5 is the twenty three three thirty is the testimony service okay so we went through all these trials and and they beat us up threatened us and so forth and verse 23 they went to their own companies went back to their people and reported all the chief priests and elders had said unto them here's what they said is what they did and when the people heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord Lord thou art God thou has made heaven and earth and so far they go through this long prayer and they're so happy and they're so so blessed that God sent an earthquake yeah verse 30 31 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled all the ghosts and they spake the Word of God with boldness so 32 to 37 is where they shared everything it was due to the time of persecution and it was voluntary and it was only in Jerusalem now brother mem says in 1955 he says as Moses went with the judgment stick beforehand that same stick tonight to the churches Jesus Christ if those Egyptians could ever got that little stick out of Moses hands they would have had him whipped and when the devil could never get the deity out of the name is Jesus Christ he's got the church whipped and that's going on right now in pulpits in our country where they're trying to prove that Jesus was only your brother really yeah Jesus wasn't God well I'm sorry if prophet said he was so we have to stay balanced put things where they belong doesn't matter who it hurts you know Paul wrote in Philippians 2 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow yeah all the Muhammadans all the ices all those people are on a bow one day things in heaven earth things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord so we're on the winning side just stay with it don't don't get off the path you know maybe we'll go to one more chapter I'll be okay nobody double-parked right we're okay let's check so brother brems says in 1964 if things go on the way they are now whatever he was focusing on I don't know he said if things go on the way they are now in 50 years we'll be total insanity well guess what that was about five years ago where that was fulfilled so when you see all these things happening it's because people are insane the devil feeds him through the television and through here that's worse than television so the devil well he's on the rampage he knows what he's doing and he knows how much he's he knows better than we do how much time he's got left so it's total insanity right so when we look at chapter four I mean Chapter five we look back in chapter four back in 33 and 34 they were having things in common 34 neither was there any among them it'll act as many it was had possessors of land they sold them brought them to the prices to the things that were sold and so forth so there was unity there was peace they cared for one another greatly the one just had god bless you didn't know they took him to eat no they they helped each other love about it and so there are no needs amongst the believers there was no competition there was no looking down on anybody those that had something they sold it and they brought it proceeds to the Apostles and they distribute it fairly so they had all things in common okay this was simply a model and it's an ideal that is advocated by communism and socialism but it's never been achieved okay there's no way to make it even across the board these early believers we're not setting up an economic system they were simply responding to each other in gracious Christian living okay and compassion and they were demonstrating the love of God that's just in words everything was running smoothly but unfortunately are not all believers in New Testament times shared the same godly concerns 5:1 but a certain man named ananias and his lovely wife sapphire you notice that nobody ever calls her little girl Sapphira bible name what's problem they sold a possession and they kept back a little part of it you know for hard times his wife also being privy she understood she green and they brought a certain part and laid it at the Apostles feet they look good on the outside right and Peter said Ananias why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and keep back part of the price why was yours hey do what you want after it was sold was not your own power why hast thou conceived this thing an EIN heart and there has not lied to man but to God and when Ananias heard these things he fell down dead finished nobody rushed up to pray for him great fear come on Paul those that heard these things and the young man rose up they wound him up carried about and buried him finished about three hours later here comes lovely so far not knowing what happened Oh wasn't she concerned where's my man three hours you know and and Peter said tell me he sold the land for so much oh yeah yeah that's right verse nine and Peter said how is it that she have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which I buried your husband are at the door and they're going to carry you out of here and she fell down dead and the young man wound up took her out and buried her and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things now it wasn't so much that they didn't turn it all in because God wasn't concerned about their cash but they lied see the sin was that they lied they acted like what yells it it wasn't it who knows how much they kept back you know and so they they tried to deceive the servants of God and thereby God Himself back in verse 34 through 37 in chapter four it they brought the entire amount that's what they promised and this man in verse 36 his original name was Joseph but they give him a nickname Barnabas which means son of encouragement we'll see more about him Lord well in Chapter 9 so these two they sneaked apart to themselves for hard times you know making it look like this was the total amount so they looked good on the outside but on the inside there were cheats now this whole thing of living in common that we covered a couple times here it was a historical event it's not a doctrine we don't find that as a mandate for believers anywhere there have been those who have tried to make it work and it is failed every time you mainly to human greed and lack of the Holy Ghost where the RAM told some dear friends of mine it will not work sister Ruth Ozzy was part of that group out there verse 11 fear came upon the believers they they perked up you know they paid attention they were not afraid like in danger but much greater respect for God's holiness and his moral law was going on so the fact is no one is perfect we don't have a you know truth detector out here okay you can come in you can't come in no one's perfect God does forgive but when you're given the chance to confess it's very important to confess the truth and not lie like these to make believers you know so we're in chapter 5 and verse 12 through 16 is the miracle ministry by the hands of the Apostles and attracted opposite responses there was the unbelievers and the make believers don't do mess with them leave him alone stay away but the believers flock to the meetings they brought the signif elected from other villages in verse 16 around about Jerusalem bringing sick folks and with them which were vexed with evil unclean spirits and they were healed every one so there was great deliverance so the first persecution was over here in chapter 4 where the disciples spent one night in jail remember them because the equipment was he'll spent one night in prison and then in verse 18 you know they let it after they threatened them go just don't just don't speak the name of Jesus okay and then they had the great meeting with the earthquake and so forth and now in Chapter five is the second persecution or 17 then the high priest rose up now here all these people it says it healed everyone they're having great success great things are happening got these two dead make believers gay they're buried and then we have this great success going on from 12 to 16 then the high priest who knew his Bible perfectly rose up on all of them they're whipped with him all the Sadducees they were filled with indignation they should have been happy that prophets words were being fulfilled in their lifetime no they're mad they're upset very upset now the Sadducees it's a Jewish denomination that denied angels denied miracles resurrection and supernatural if you take all that all the way you got dead letter you got nothing you know and so in verse 18 they took him straight to jail yeah put him in prison like that's gonna solve something verse 19 but the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison door and brought them forth and said go over there to the temple preach the words of life to the people okay and so they go over there they have an early church you know and verse 21 and when they heard that they entered in Temple mourning that taught them but the high priest came and then his whole crowd and got the council together all these people and sent some people oh hey go get those guys we're gonna take care of business so they got all together and of course in verse 22 they came back empty-handed hey we saw the prison it was all locked up but prisoners weren't there and you know it's looking bad except something something's going on here so the verse 24 they're really upset they doubted them weren't who this would grow if we don't take care that's just going to get out of hand you know we've got to investigate this in verse 25 they got the real news flash behold those guys that you put in prison throw whether it's a temple teaching the people oh we thought was gonna put this fire out how's this gonna have this happen you know so they were arrested nicely uh-huh the captain the officers brought them without violence let's just come with us you know just come with us we got to talk cuz all these people are watching all these believers are out here you know and they didn't wanna get stoned they this crowd is growing daily you know because if you'll remember in know in Chapter two three thousand souls ratted Wow in verse 47 out of the church daily such as should be saved so we don't know how many verse 4 of chapter four five thousand men and verse 14 of chapter five the believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes of men and women so God's moving things are happening you know and verse 16 they're healed everyone so with the religious leaders were taking notice here's the word coming to life in these people they're happy they got victorious lives but these church leaders are upset you know they had their their organized religion it's got to happen this way the way we say no you're stupid you don't have it you don't really know how to read will tell you how to do it will tell you when to listen what to do it's organized religion and so the people are happy but these guys are upset so we're at verse 28 of chapter 5 didn't only straightly command you that you should not teach in this name you're feeling Jerusalem with this doctrine and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us well who else we're not the ones that put him on the cross it's you guys you know then Peter said in the Apostles we ought to obey God rather than man the god of Our Fathers raised up Jesus whom you guys slew and hanged on a tree him has God exalted with his room with his right hand to be the Prince and Savior for to give repentance to Israel all of you forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey Him and it's the only place you're gonna find in the Bible he gives all he goes to those that obey Him very simple so the message was positive it was factual you know he was just speaking truth it was all about God's plan and power and Peter spoke it with love you know he did not slander and show disrespect to the superiors there was not they weren't arrogant with the message of Christ and if you listen closely to brother Branham you'll never find where he is throwing rocks that people don't see it exactly his way he just preached the truth you never found him arrogant on any tape or blasting people so when they heard this mini sermon here by Peter they wanted to kill him on the spot yeah I mean they were they were upset when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay him we got to get this guy you know they're bad yeah let's see what brother Alonzo says over here in 6:30 we're going at 5:33 I've got a note here for some reason chapter 5 and verse 33 when they heard these words they were enraged and thought to murder the Apostles these same words a little more color to it we've got to get rid of these people now there's thousands of believers but these are the these are the ones that are guilty so then we have brother Gamaliel the great teacher he got up hey take the apostles outside we gotta have a conference here he says you all might want to be careful verse 36 he says here before these days just a while ago we had this guy named Theo Dias boasting to be somebody and I'm about four hundred men joined themselves to it and when he was killed those that obeyed him scattered the whole thing came to zero and then we got the guy named Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing and he carried a bunch of people away also perished the whole thing came to zero okay so he's reminding of what just happened just a few years ago examples of fake leaders and how it all came to nothing and now I say refrain from these men leave them alone for if this council this whole business is a work of man it'll come to zero don't problem don't worry about it but if it be of God you're not gonna overthrow it and you might be fighting against God in other words it's none of your business you know don't worry about it so when something's not going to cording to your narrow understanding or your great revelation remember God's still in charge over here in the last chapter of John we had a very good example in 21 and 20 we have Peter turning about see at the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said Lord this is John is asking the Lord at the supper which is either the betrayeth II and Peter seeing him say it to Jesus Lord what about the sky jesus said hey Peter if I will that he tarry until I come what's it to you follow you me in other words Peter sending your business you don't have to figure everything out leave it alone you know so God doesn't need our opinions our little you know chicken brain ideas and how things work our judgments he's the judge he will work it out you know so they agreed over here you know in these verses and okay if we have two good meal you're the smart guy you might have something on there and now they call the believers in they beat him up a little bit and they sent him on their way but in verse 40 says here they beat him up and commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and they let him go so friends the anti spirit was alive there and it's alive now just whatever you don't mention the name and there's all kinds of things going on under the umbrella of Malachi 4 that are not pointing the people to Jesus Christ to themselves - some big deal no just get back to the original it's not hard to do it you see and so in 41 they left the core they're rejoicing that they could be counted worthy to suffer some dishonor on account of the mighty name of Jesus Christ they weren't you know what are we gonna do now oh no they were happy I think they could be you know suffer for his namesake the verse 42 and daily in the temple in every house they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ so just in review of these five chapters we'll stop there for the ninth but these people had trials this was not an easy road you know and they had relatives like we have they were preaching to mixed multitudes and only in heaven well they're not being make believers and unbelievers we're gonna have to put up with them here because they're here you see some I'm landed in prison they were persecuted for using the name of Jesus Christ but they moved out into the deep waters of Revelation they faced persecution and we're gonna face persecutions things things are gonna happen it's not gonna because you busted a fingernail you know or toenail but genuinely suffer for the name of Jesus Christ so let me just leave you with one testimony that we know is real when missionaries were up in the mountains of Mexico they were called up there by invitation to preach to a little Pentecostal church but besides that they ran into some other people up there not knowing that this is a hotbed for the cartel people the government doesn't go there nobody goes up there but somehow these three guys went up in an old beat-up Toyota car that one of them had they get up there and they were there several days they end up baptizing the the mother of you know the big man and this other guy he comes up and he says hey yeah I believe what Schaller teaching him so he can I have your Bible well you know somebody asks you for your Bible what you can do no you can't have it so he gives them the Bible well he's turned up a few other times secretly see the Bible so he's that that man was baptized he has baptized himself he's baptized he says over 2,000 people so he's out there doing his little work the care of us looking for him they can't find him anyway so when they leave this area they got the little car and they're coming down the mountain well down the road there's another bunch of people that hate those people and so you're coming from there you must be one of them anyway they stopped him and of course they saw they were Christian see I had nothing no drugs no nothing but they were mad because they had been up there so here's the here's they have the victory here you get down here here's the other twin you know shows up with a problem so all of a sudden they they got him out they took the shoes off and it's just rocks there's no pavement up there shove the car in front of the ravine it's down there burning you know what I gonna do well you just walk out here we don't care what you do we're not gonna kill you so now they're walking out on the rocks it's hot they're not they were like these people they weren't bemoaning overcharge me any money for no they were just walking out they don't know where they're going they don't know where town is they just walking and they were rejoicing because they had been chosen to to suffer for his namesake the same thing that's going on here so the book is still being written see it's still gonna and we don't know where the end is we think it's soon but we're gonna stay faithful see these are our brothers and sisters this is our family this work started and we're over here at the end of it so come back tomorrow night we'll carry on god bless you the journal I found out a long time ago it's better to leave people kind of hungry thank you stuff I might come back thank you very much amen praise the Lord I've got one of these in fact when I heard of jord the gorge coming I was thinking about bringing my my own level or put it but and I put it on the pulpit here it would be a bit bigger a man oh you got a big one amen maybe for a bigger Church well I think I want to thank the Lord for the word and brother again proving that the prophet of God preached in the going forth of the seven seals and the just think the first sermon he preached was God hidden and God revealed in simplicity a man why because he knew then approaching the seven seals and as our Brotherhood was at the revelation here tonight concerning approaching the message a crook approaching the book of Acts that we're going to look at this we're gonna look at this and make it bigger than what it is or smaller than what it is but brother if we can only just take it the way our brother preaches tonight a bad brother it's not it's not going bigger than they're bigger they're smaller smaller no it was God in his in his apostle's it was God in His disciples I like what he brought oak and he concerning Lukey see he wasn't an apostle he was the disciple and a disciple was a follower a man and brother that's what that's what God's looking for you and me is to see if we would see if were two disciples we're following Jesus following the revealed Word and I thank God tonight for that word that our brother to our Brotherhood the book of Acts and just took it burst by verse by verse mother why for to show us God in and reveal in simplicity and I'll what to give us understanding that the book of Acts wasn't finished 2,000 years ago a man it was the beginning I like that that's good it was God God started in the book of Acts a man and and what and he continuing right on down to this hour and you know what he had to do in Malachi 4 he had to turn our hearts back to the book of Acts a man began to turn our hearts but why because we were going this way going this way this church sisters just dismissed faith of that faith you know the doctrines and so on but he turned he turned our hearts back to let us go back to the beginning and let's let's see what God started with and see what God is doing right on through down to the seven churches I like that Oh it struck me when he said that the book of Acts is still going on a man and I yes I said thank God said I will restore you restores the book of Acts I like that praise the Lord so this is absolutely amazing that her brother could take that the scripture in the book of Acts and and to bring out so much revelations give us so much understanding of God a man brother I trust that you can go back and start the book of Acts again and read it with a different understanding read it with a better understanding a man so you can you can identify with we're those that are that are in the book of Acts I oh I like it thank God brother that is still going on and if and is not bigger than what what it is it's not smaller than what it is these exactly the way that God ordained it to be a man God God isn't a brother sister or whatever God has done you know man makes it bigger that God what does God do God sends another another anointing on the scene to bring it back down to God and simplicity amen because there make a denomination out of it you know whether whether Luther or Wesley or the Pentecostals what God does you know it's easier as our brothers brought out it's all like it Oh Acts chapter one after scepter to Acts chapter 3 4 5 right on a man see don't you get the glory to God not demand a man for the remain always bills man off see like like they did in Luther's day Wesley's day the Pentecostal age and so on yeah but God had to keep sending the messenger bring him back down to God in simplicity a man and the same thing in this in this hour through the men and ministry of Malachi for brother they missed and they failed to comprehend God in simplicity that's the truth they they wanted the signs they wanted the wonders but they didn't want the simple revelation of the word he may come back to the truth come back to the world God's God's revelation God's understanding that he wanted to give to you and me by the grace of God a man and like in our brother broto concerning that the disciples were on learned and ingrid amen I'll try not to preach too long I'll try to go as long as I brother did so but he said they were unlearned and ignorant Oh will be too ashamed to take that oh I don't want to have that real reputation that idea I think people are gonna thank me is that be not learned and ignorant well brother that's what God's looking for if you Rea if you know that then God's able to come down and give you something that you need to know by grace it says they were on learned that ignorant but they had been with Jesus a man brother I I thank God for that this isn't me go back to that scripture that our brother was bringing out here boy this is tremendous oh brother he in an hour and a half he covered five chapters I don't think I'd be able to do it so I thought that's a gift of God in our brother's ministry for sure Brees the name of the Lord and again in Acts chapter 4 and verse 13 is see oh excuse me just for a moment here extra or 13 and when they saw and be the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant what made them bold was the Holy Ghost they humble themselves to God a man as they were on learned and ignorant they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus I like that God bless your brother see they humble themselves and God got in them to use them you want God to use you you got a humble yourself you got acknowledged Lord I don't know what I should know a man I don't understand what I should understand are all right but Lord I'm depending on you what is it it's the Holy Ghost amen that's good God taking us back to that day of Pentecost that's good see no wonder rose it is still going on exactly because in every age you had to receive the Holy Ghost you had to repent receive the Holy Ghost a man god help us brother to recognize our need of the Holy Ghost and that and to get it we got to humble ourselves well acknowledge that when it comes to the things of God we are on learned and we are ignorant but he's there with the Holy Ghost to reveal what we need a man but they marveled and they took knowledge of them do they take knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus amen or is it oh you you study the word you studied this message you studied that message all really knows the message no not knowing the message is knowing Jesus Jesus is the message and he'll reveal it hey man praise the Lord that's good thank the Lord for the don't forget it go back to it humble yourself amen you want to be exalted you're gonna all be yourself and colleagues aren't you and verse 33 in chapter 4 he said and with great power gave the Apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus that's good that's given witness of the resurrection I am what I am because the resurrected Christ is in me and in you I know what I know because the resurrected Christ is in me amen and again our brother bought up the scripture he saw me with you even in you to the end of the age you'll never leave us nor forsake us amen brother we need a minister brother it's not it's not just reading a book you got to have Christ in you and even even when it comes to the scripture the word you want to know what understand it you won't wanted to be a blessing to you you gotta have Christ in you a man and he said with great power gave the Apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and good he said great grace was upon them all as the grace of God thank God for the for the testimony of grace in you in me tonight a man well and if you if you got that grace you you're going to be a witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ our brother George was a witness of the resurrection of Christ as Christ in him Christ in you Christ in me amen what he keeping us what God hidden and God revealed in simplicity we're in you in me in our brother George in the Bride of Christ that's good praise the Lord hallelujah and one other scripture - I liked but again go back to those scriptures concerning the disciples being ignorant and I learned but what made them different David they had been with Jesus man that's what makes us different praise the Lord and our witness is of the resurrection of Jesus the life you live you live it because the resurrected Christ is in you by the grace of God and in Chapter five our brother I lighted a scripture and we are his witnesses of we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that obey Him amen praise the Lord thank God for the word amen thank God for our brother George hey man for preaching five sermons five chapters of the book of Acts and what that's all on the same level showing what what God what God started God is continuing all the way down through praise the Lord this wonderful a man so God's grace to be good to continue with our brother as he ministers tomorrow amen and brother there's a clock there but you don't have to look at the clock if you put too much emphasis on him brother Matthew would take the clock down he's done it before so he'll do it again amen so thank the Lord amen this put the emphasis on the word not on the time just put the emphasis on eternity not on time amen because what God is doing brothers through the preaching of the words with the Ministry of the word the teaching of it God is endeavoring to get us out of time and into eternity praise the Lord god bless you this sing praise the Lord amen to God be the glory great things he has done so loved either world he gave
