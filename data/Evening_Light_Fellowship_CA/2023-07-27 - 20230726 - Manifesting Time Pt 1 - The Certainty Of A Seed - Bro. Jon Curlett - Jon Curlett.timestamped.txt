[40:58] chapter 1 Genesis chapter one and we'll
[41:00] start in verse 11.
[41:02] amen welcome brother Jim Dooley here and
[41:04] Manny made the trip just in special he
[41:07] had meant to be here maybe uh this week
[41:09] or and then wasn't sure and then I said
[41:11] well I'm Gone the rest of the time so I
[41:14] think he just made the trip just to just
[41:16] because I wanted him to come in so I I
[41:18] did promise that I wouldn't promise my
[41:20] wife I wouldn't ask him to minister
[41:21] tonight or exhort us that would be
[41:23] unfair last time he was here if you
[41:25] remember he said he came to have a
[41:27] vacation and listen to Brother John
[41:28] preach and he came and he preached and I
[41:31] went on vacation so
[41:33] so I don't want to do that to them
[41:34] tonight but brother Jim it's always good
[41:36] to see you amen as brother Bob mentioned
[41:38] just to remind you I'm headed to
[41:39] Edmonton tomorrow morning bright and
[41:40] early I'll be gone and back the
[41:43] following Friday so just pray for me as
[41:45] I travel and that God would grant me
[41:47] Grace keep me safe I'll be doing some
[41:49] dangerous things while I'm there in fast
[41:51] Machinery going around a track with
[41:53] other men that are hell-bent on on
[41:55] beating me to the finish line so just
[41:57] trusting God will bless me there I'll be
[41:59] in the special services as well for a
[42:00] bit with brother Ron Spencer and brother
[42:02] Ray Erickson brother Nathan Erickson so
[42:04] just keep those in prayer and I'll be
[42:06] fellowshipping with Brotherhood
[42:07] hammermeister while I'm there as well so
[42:09] just keep me in that amen and I'll be
[42:11] praying for you trusting that brother
[42:12] Paul will be a blessing as he he brings
[42:14] his his Sunday school lesson on on
[42:17] Sunday and then brother Berry coffee
[42:18] Lord willing will minister to us on
[42:20] Wednesday I mean God bless you Genesis
[42:22] chapter 1 and verse 11 says and God said
[42:25] let the Earth bring forth grass the herb
[42:28] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[42:30] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[42:32] is in itself off upon the Earth and it
[42:35] was so and the Earth brought forth grass
[42:38] in her building seat after his kind and
[42:40] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[42:41] in itself after his kind and God saw
[42:45] that it was good amen God bless you you
[42:46] can have your seats this evening and
[42:48] we're stepping into another series and
[42:50] and really it's just the end portion of
[42:53] the Redemption series and so it's a
[42:55] focus on on Final that final stage and
[42:58] what that looks like and kind of what's
[42:59] going on uh through the word and through
[43:01] the bride and through the manifestation
[43:03] of the Sons and Daughters of God so I
[43:05] want to start a maybe a a an end phase
[43:08] series called manifesting time
[43:10] manifesting time and I want to take a
[43:12] thought tonight of the certainty of a
[43:15] seed amen the certainty of the seed and
[43:16] we're going to be taking this all the
[43:18] way back to the scriptures and we're
[43:19] going to be looking at this Final Phase
[43:21] of redemption what it looks like how it
[43:23] works how we know we're a part of it and
[43:25] the responsibilities and the benefits
[43:26] that come with being a son or daughter
[43:28] of God in this age amen and like I said
[43:30] last service I'm studying these things
[43:32] and I'm taking a closer look at these
[43:34] things and I'm revising some of these
[43:35] things and I want to be very open about
[43:37] that I don't want to hide and say you
[43:39] know that I had it right I had it right
[43:41] no sometimes we get things wrong and
[43:43] sometimes we just have to come up a
[43:44] little higher amen I I was reading in
[43:46] Revelation where the angel said to John
[43:48] he says here's this and then he says now
[43:50] come a little higher and let me show you
[43:52] other things let me show you greater
[43:53] things that maybe you haven't considered
[43:55] thus far even brother Branham had to
[43:57] grow in his Revelation so I'm not
[43:58] ashamed to say I'm growing in my
[44:00] Revelation that God can correct me that
[44:02] God can add to these things and and show
[44:04] me different things amen if we've got it
[44:06] all figured out we can't be much used to
[44:07] an all-knowing God Amen we we step into
[44:10] his shoes when we do that Amen brother
[44:12] Brown would say this just as a as a
[44:13] preface as we start he would say see
[44:15] God's got it all figured out for us
[44:19] that's the only thing we have to do is
[44:21] just hold on to him and just go right on
[44:23] see that's all he says believing that's
[44:26] all he asked us to do he will take us
[44:30] right through amen and that's what I'm
[44:31] resting today is that as we talk about
[44:33] this thought on the certainty of a seed
[44:35] we're going to take it right back to
[44:36] Genesis 1 and I love it when I can open
[44:39] a series or a thought or a scripture
[44:42] from Genesis 1 because if you can show
[44:44] where it started then you can be sure
[44:45] that it's continued all the way through
[44:47] him and you've got a you've got a real
[44:48] Foundation if you can take it back to
[44:50] the foundation that original book in the
[44:52] scriptures amen so if we look back in
[44:54] this word principle we're opening up
[44:55] this this evening in Genesis 1. it says
[44:58] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[45:00] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[45:02] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[45:04] whose seed is in itself upon the Earth
[45:07] and it was so so in other words we see
[45:09] God here is speaking to the seeds he's
[45:13] speaking to the Earth he's speaking to
[45:14] the creation and he's saying be what you
[45:16] are grow into what is already inside of
[45:19] you break out and become what was
[45:21] determined for you already just bring
[45:24] out what's inside of you that's what the
[45:26] word of God is supposed to do is bring
[45:28] out something that's inside of you
[45:29] already
[45:30] the creative work has already been done
[45:33] here what is is what is and what is is
[45:36] what will be amen there is no changing
[45:38] it after this has gone forth amend God's
[45:40] order God's principle is for a seed to
[45:43] produce what is inside of it now see
[45:45] what Catches Us off so many times is
[45:47] that seeds can lay dormant
[45:50] and we look at it and we say there's
[45:51] nothing coming out there's nothing
[45:53] coming out but see it still has life
[45:56] inside of it even though it's dormant it
[45:58] has life inside of it it has potential
[46:00] inside it and so the fact that it's
[46:02] dormant does not mean it's not a good
[46:04] seed
[46:05] it does not mean it's not a bad seed
[46:07] either it just means that it hasn't been
[46:09] in the right conditions for life yet
[46:11] that's all it means the conditions
[46:13] aren't right but we see here that God
[46:14] set the conditions for the earth to
[46:16] bring forth life and all of a sudden he
[46:18] sets the atmosphere right he sets the
[46:20] temperature right he says the the carbon
[46:22] dioxide and and he sets the the hydrogen
[46:25] and the nitrogen and all these things
[46:26] and he forms this perfect atmosphere and
[46:29] then he brings water to water it and
[46:31] something happens and what happens is
[46:33] verse 12 and you can literally take 11
[46:36] verse 11 and transpose it into verse 12
[46:38] and just change from Let It Be to it was
[46:41] because that's the way the word works is
[46:43] it just takes it from a word spoken to a
[46:45] word reality it says in the word brought
[46:48] forth grass and herbuilding seed after
[46:49] his kind and the tree yielding fruit
[46:51] whose seed was in itself after his kind
[46:53] and God saw that it was good so voila
[46:57] God speaks it God sets the conditions he
[47:00] speaks this and then he sets the
[47:02] conditions
[47:03] there's often a separation between the
[47:05] speaking and the right conditions but
[47:08] God's in all of it amen and as soon as
[47:10] he sets the right conditions and the
[47:12] seeds produce what was inside of them
[47:14] each one of them was packaged and maybe
[47:16] some of them look very very much the
[47:18] same but they were different when they
[47:19] came out other ones look completely
[47:21] different but notice that the dormancy
[47:23] did not change them the fact that they
[47:25] had laying there for who knows how many
[47:27] days or hours or years or Millennia or
[47:30] whatever it was how long they were
[47:32] laying there that did not alter them in
[47:34] any way whatever God had created by his
[47:36] spoken word in terms of seeds were still
[47:39] the exact same seeds when he finally set
[47:41] the conditions right
[47:42] Amen brother Brandon would say it this
[47:44] way he says now God in 6 000 years have
[47:47] planted all these wonderful seeds or he
[47:50] had spoke his word notice he says he had
[47:52] spoke his word he says it shall be this
[47:55] way this tree shall be this shall be
[47:56] everything was perfect it was just good
[48:00] and he commanded each one of those seeds
[48:02] that they would be that they would
[48:04] transform themselves into the plant of
[48:06] which kind of life that the word of God
[48:07] had spoken in them should be if it was
[48:09] an oak tree it was to bring forth an oak
[48:11] if it was a palm it was to bring forth a
[48:13] palm he says because the great Creator
[48:16] had just sent forth his word and the
[48:20] word seed was there before the real seed
[48:23] was ever formed he says the word formed
[48:25] the seed you've got to catch that
[48:27] principle here because he says before
[48:29] the reality was there there was a word
[48:31] that went forth there was something to
[48:34] call forth that which became reality and
[48:36] it was spoken and before it was spoken
[48:38] we'll see it was a thought and then it
[48:39] became a reality he says the word formed
[48:42] the seed see he made the world out of
[48:44] things that do not appear he made the
[48:47] world by his word God spoke everything
[48:49] into existence and being God the Creator
[48:51] speaking all things into existence it
[48:53] must have been a perfect world he says
[48:56] it was a beautiful place it was a real
[48:58] genuine Paradise here on the earth why
[49:01] because it was Word Perfect it was
[49:03] exactly the way as God had ordained it
[49:06] was exactly the way that God had said it
[49:07] was supposed to be so notice here that
[49:10] the original creation was brought by the
[49:12] spoken word but it was a part of the
[49:15] word itself
[49:16] they are not separate but one is a
[49:18] manifestation of what was spoken amen so
[49:21] that original condition on the Earth was
[49:22] word perfect because it was exactly
[49:24] according to what God had thought and
[49:26] what God had said and then it came into
[49:28] reality it was exactly right
[49:30] but notice why was it right why was it
[49:33] good because everything brought forth of
[49:36] what it was everything brought forth
[49:38] exactly as it was ordained to that was a
[49:40] Perfection of it it was exactly the way
[49:43] it was designed that it came forth we
[49:45] look today and we see how things can
[49:47] vary even within a species and one will
[49:49] be wonderful and fruit bearing in the
[49:51] next seed of that same tree or plant
[49:52] will come out it'll be all gnarled up
[49:54] and it won't produce anything or it'll
[49:55] produce bad fruit or it just won't be
[49:57] able to go through the jail but in the
[49:59] original creation everything brought
[50:01] forth perfectly the way that he had told
[50:03] it to
[50:04] that's the certainty of a seed that's
[50:06] the Perfection of a seed is that it does
[50:09] not change
[50:11] that's the certainty of a seed as it
[50:13] does not change when you plant the seed
[50:15] whatever you plant it will grow it
[50:17] doesn't sit there and change itself
[50:19] overnight it can't change itself even if
[50:21] it had intelligence to want to change
[50:23] itself it cannot change it can stay
[50:25] dormant for a thousand years and you can
[50:28] plant it and it'll produce exactly what
[50:30] it was when you laid it in the ground or
[50:32] you laid it in a seed packet and said
[50:33] sit there until I plant you amen it
[50:36] cannot change itself if you take a seed
[50:38] from an orange you're going to get an
[50:40] orange tree every time
[50:42] it's never going to become a half an
[50:44] orange tree and half an apple tree it's
[50:45] never going to become like an orange
[50:47] maybe an apple tree or or a lemon tree
[50:50] or something in the Citrus thing it
[50:52] cannot do it because the DNA is set
[50:54] within the seed already and it cannot
[50:56] reprogram itself it cannot choose to be
[50:58] something else it must come out based on
[51:01] what it's it's programmed to do
[51:03] here's the thing consider this you take
[51:05] an apple tree and you plant it in the
[51:07] midst of an Orange Grove
[51:10] you think well the influence of the
[51:11] oranges would surely have something on
[51:13] it
[51:14] but no it'll come up an apple tree and
[51:16] it'll be the only Apple Tree in that
[51:18] whole Grove of orange trees but because
[51:19] the seed is in it to be an apple tree
[51:21] it'll be an apple tree that's how we can
[51:24] sit here today and we can be surrounded
[51:26] by hundreds of thousands of people that
[51:28] don't have the seed of God inside of
[51:30] them and we can come up in a desperate
[51:32] age and an unbelieving age and we can be
[51:34] children of God it's because we cannot
[51:36] change what we are we can only be what
[51:39] he said we were going to be he can only
[51:41] be what he said we are amen
[51:43] it doesn't have a choice a seed doesn't
[51:46] have a choice it must produce what it is
[51:48] now we can say yes the environment has
[51:51] an effect on it the size of a tree the
[51:53] shape of a tree how much fruit it
[51:55] produces how fast it grows that is all
[51:57] based on environment
[51:59] if you are in a tree that doesn't have a
[52:01] lot of of sunlight it's not going to
[52:03] grow quickly and it's not going to
[52:04] produce a lot of fruit
[52:06] if you have a tree in a place where
[52:07] there isn't much water and it needs a
[52:09] lot of water it's going to grow very
[52:11] slowly but it will still grow into what
[52:13] it is it doesn't change because the
[52:15] environment changes it just maybe slows
[52:17] it down on the other side you put it in
[52:19] a place where it has lots of water the
[52:20] correct amount of sunlight and it's it's
[52:22] not being surrounded by weed sucking the
[52:24] nutrients out you you put everything it
[52:26] needs into the soil and that tree will
[52:27] grow faster than anything else why it's
[52:29] in the right environment but it's no
[52:31] different than the one that's growing
[52:32] slowly they're the exact same tree
[52:34] they're just in a different environment
[52:36] they're just in circuits in different
[52:37] circumstances because here's the thing
[52:39] all orange trees share one thing they're
[52:42] orange trees
[52:44] they're all orange trees no matter if
[52:45] one just produces one orange all its
[52:47] life or one produces one a day they're
[52:49] both orange trees it's in their DNA so
[52:51] in other words seeds cannot be corrupted
[52:54] seeds cannot be messed with amen a seed
[52:57] is inevitable it cannot change itself
[52:59] even if it wanted to
[53:01] now that's a wonderful thing if you're a
[53:03] good seed isn't it
[53:04] because we're talking about Sons and
[53:06] Daughters of God we're not talking about
[53:07] trees or plants or anything but if
[53:09] you're a good seed that's a wonderful
[53:10] thing it's not so wonderful if you're a
[53:12] bad seed
[53:14] and by bad we mean something that has no
[53:16] value or something that is a life Sucker
[53:17] from something that is amen but we see
[53:20] seeds and we look at them and if we
[53:21] don't know what a seed is based on you
[53:24] know being trained or educated in those
[53:26] things we can look at a sea a seed and
[53:28] we'll see see something's got lumps all
[53:30] over it
[53:31] lumps all over it right it's got Spikes
[53:34] all over it and it's got all those
[53:35] things and you say how can anything good
[53:37] come out of that seed look at it it
[53:39] looks horrible it looks prickly it looks
[53:42] like it just wants to hurt
[53:43] but it's surrounded by something that
[53:45] has nothing to do with what's inside of
[53:47] it
[53:48] what's inside of it is what's inside of
[53:50] and the outside can look horrible and on
[53:52] the inside can be something that is
[53:53] life-giving that's wonderful for us amen
[53:55] the shape of the seed the the appearance
[53:57] of the seed is is not at all something
[54:00] that we take into consideration it
[54:01] doesn't matter it's what's inside it
[54:02] that's really going to determine is it
[54:04] good or is it bad so like I said we're
[54:06] not talking natural seeds we're talking
[54:07] spiritual seeds we're talking Sons and
[54:09] Daughters of God and sometimes we look
[54:11] at the Shell that we have and it can be
[54:13] pretty frankly
[54:15] sometimes it can be pretty lumpy
[54:16] sometimes it can be pretty ugly but
[54:18] guess what it's meant to be ugly it's
[54:21] meant to rot it's meant to die and
[54:22] that's why we don't focus on it but we
[54:24] focus on what's inside we focus on the
[54:26] word that God has given us amen so I
[54:29] want to take us now so we can see our
[54:31] portion in this this evening we want to
[54:33] see the seed principle in us that we
[54:34] cannot be corrupted Paul would say we're
[54:37] born of a seed that's incorruptible
[54:39] amen so if we can see the certainty of a
[54:42] seed in our lives it ought to give us
[54:43] faith that we compress the battle that
[54:45] we can keep moving forward day to day
[54:47] now John would see this John was a
[54:50] wonderful Apostle because he saw things
[54:52] as a prophet
[54:54] he didn't just look at things in terms
[54:56] of what was in front of him but he saw
[54:57] things kind of from beginning to end and
[54:59] he says in the beginning was the word
[55:01] and the Word was with God and the Word
[55:04] was God and so we're looking at the
[55:06] nature of a seed or the certainty of a
[55:07] seed we can see there's something in the
[55:09] beginning in fact we see something that
[55:11] was before the beginning and that was
[55:13] the word
[55:14] and that's what we want to tie ourselves
[55:16] to because if we're going to be here
[55:17] when all of time is over we've got to
[55:19] have been here before time ever began we
[55:21] want to tie ourselves to that word but
[55:23] John he's looking through God's eyes and
[55:25] with the understanding of the Holy
[55:26] Spirit he says before there was anything
[55:28] there was the word amen so that begs the
[55:32] question what is the word
[55:34] what is the word we look at it and we
[55:36] say it's a scripture or or we might say
[55:38] it's this or that but it's the start of
[55:40] everything it's the start of everything
[55:42] it's not just the Bible in print amen
[55:44] but it's the start of everything and so
[55:46] we better know what that word is when it
[55:48] was in its original form not just in the
[55:50] form that we say is the word today
[55:52] brother Brandon would say this he said
[55:54] for his word as we saw this morning has
[55:56] to be fulfilled it is God's thought made
[55:59] manifest by his word and brought to a
[56:01] reality he says now the word was the
[56:04] beginning
[56:06] it wasn't in the beginning it was the
[56:08] beginning everything had an origin
[56:09] everything comes from that word point
[56:11] forward it says but before it was a word
[56:14] he says a word is a thought May manifest
[56:16] God had to think it before he could make
[56:19] it a word then he spoke the word and it
[56:22] materialized so we're talking about this
[56:25] concept of manifesting time and we see
[56:27] here that there's a manifestation that
[56:29] brother Branham is talking about now
[56:31] that word manifest means to make evident
[56:33] or certain by showing or displaying in
[56:36] other words manifest means to
[56:38] materialize and brother but I'm saying
[56:40] here that the word had to be in the
[56:42] thought and then it had to be in the
[56:44] mouth to be spoken and then it had to
[56:45] materialize amen so he's saying a seed
[56:48] word will manifest when it shows or
[56:51] displays what it is
[56:53] that's how you know it's manifesting
[56:55] time is when you show what you truly are
[56:57] so in other words a seed will manifest
[57:00] when it comes to life and grows into its
[57:03] form and produces the same thing that
[57:06] produced it
[57:09] see there is no new seed
[57:11] it's all old seed It's All Original Seed
[57:14] and so you've got to produce what
[57:16] produced you in the first place coming
[57:18] to life just isn't enough
[57:20] that's not what a scene is about you
[57:22] know it's not just growing a little bit
[57:24] because if you plant things I remember
[57:26] in in elementary school we would get we
[57:30] were given those beans remember and we
[57:31] had to grow them but sometimes they give
[57:33] us other things throughout the different
[57:34] years and whatnot and everybody would
[57:36] plant a seed but some of them had beans
[57:39] and some of them had corn and these
[57:40] different things and when both of them
[57:42] came up all they were was a little green
[57:44] sprig that might have had a leaf here
[57:46] and a leaf there and guess what they
[57:47] both look more or less exactly the same
[57:49] just having life is not enough just
[57:52] coming up and breaking out isn't enough
[57:53] but you've got to come all the way to
[57:55] the maturity of what called you out in
[57:57] the first place of what produced you in
[57:59] the first place amen
[58:01] otherwise you just have two plants that
[58:03] look the same you take it back to the
[58:04] scriptures remember of the wheat and the
[58:06] tares and they said listen you've got
[58:07] bad bad bad seed here should we pluck it
[58:10] all up he says no you got to wait till
[58:12] they become mature because otherwise
[58:14] you'll pluck up one that's right in your
[58:16] Zeal to get the one that's wrong
[58:18] that's why we don't do it it's God
[58:19] that's got to do these things amen he
[58:21] sends Messengers to do those things he
[58:22] sends angels to do it but if we take
[58:24] that concept of what the word is it's a
[58:26] thought Express and from that thought
[58:28] has to come A Spoken element and from
[58:31] the spoken element has to come a
[58:32] physical element and brother Brandon
[58:34] would say this he said sitting way back
[58:36] in eternity that was God
[58:38] he says and then going out of God he
[58:41] says or God unfolding himself come the
[58:45] logos which was the son of God or the
[58:48] word of God so brother I'm saying the
[58:50] manifestation of God or the
[58:52] materialization of God is God unfolding
[58:55] himself God revealing himself God
[58:58] unveiling himself he would say it's God
[59:01] projecting himself not just from
[59:03] thoughts but to words and now into a
[59:06] reality or a materialization or
[59:08] manifesting amen the first thing that
[59:11] God pulls himself into is the word and
[59:13] that's what John points us back to the
[59:15] word was a thought first in the mind of
[59:17] God and then he spoke it and that came
[59:20] into being and that being brother
[59:22] Bradham called the logos it was the body
[59:24] it was the spoken word body of God
[59:27] himself it was a body prepared for God
[59:29] and we call that the Son of God we call
[59:31] that the logos and God stepped into that
[59:34] body
[59:35] and that became Christ the anointed one
[59:38] it was the anointing of God inside of a
[59:40] body and that's what we call the logos
[59:42] that's what we call the the the the
[59:43] Jesus Christ the the anointed one so in
[59:47] the beginning was the word in thought
[59:48] form and the Word was with God it was a
[59:50] body created and then he steps into it
[59:53] and now the body becomes God the word
[59:55] because was with God the word becomes
[59:57] God Amen and that is God now manifested
[1:00:00] in his fullness in the heavenlies
[1:00:04] nothing has touched the Earth yet this
[1:00:05] is all up in the heavenlies this is not
[1:00:08] here but it is Jesus Christ the person
[1:00:10] of the word he's the materialization of
[1:00:13] the word in its fullness
[1:00:15] and everything now is starting to unfold
[1:00:17] and now it has to come through Christ
[1:00:19] because he's the fullness of the word
[1:00:21] being expressed amen
[1:00:23] so I want to dwell on this thought of
[1:00:25] what is the word because if you can
[1:00:26] recognize what the word is and if you
[1:00:28] can put yourself in it then we've got
[1:00:30] now we're cooking with gas as they say
[1:00:32] right we've got something we can work
[1:00:33] with we can nail that down we've got
[1:00:35] rest we've got Assurance we've got peace
[1:00:37] we've got a comfort we've got a faith
[1:00:39] that what we're going to be is exactly
[1:00:40] what he said we were going to be
[1:00:42] well if I would say this he says now
[1:00:44] first place the word of God is the only
[1:00:47] plan and the only truth of God
[1:00:52] about God he says the word is God you
[1:00:54] understand I'm quoting scripture in the
[1:00:56] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:00:57] God and the Word was God so the word is
[1:01:00] God now then if God has said something
[1:01:03] it's up to God to take care of his own
[1:01:06] word that's probably the greatest quote
[1:01:08] I could read you is that God takes care
[1:01:11] of his own word
[1:01:12] amen if he said it then he's going to do
[1:01:14] it if he said it then it cannot return
[1:01:16] to him boy amen that's Isaiah 55 my word
[1:01:19] will accomplish that which I sent it to
[1:01:22] and it will prosper
[1:01:24] Prosper that means it'll produce
[1:01:26] everything it'll bring a benefit it'll
[1:01:27] bring a blessing when I send it out it
[1:01:30] cannot return void God takes care of his
[1:01:33] word him and so if you're a part of the
[1:01:34] word it's up to God to bring you forth
[1:01:37] if you're struggling then it's up to God
[1:01:38] to bring you through it amen if you're
[1:01:40] down it's up to God to bring you out
[1:01:42] because his word has to produce itself
[1:01:44] amen but it's up to God to take care of
[1:01:46] it and all he's looking for is somebody
[1:01:48] to rest on faith and believe that he'll
[1:01:50] do it to stay there until he does it
[1:01:54] to let him work in our lives amen
[1:01:57] brother I would say this he says there
[1:01:58] is one thing that we're sure he can't do
[1:02:01] he can't go against his word and remain
[1:02:04] God he has to keep his word because the
[1:02:06] word is God and God is identified
[1:02:09] through his promised word at an age
[1:02:12] the next thing he says is the word is
[1:02:16] the absolute
[1:02:17] amen so it was before anything else came
[1:02:20] into existence it was the original and
[1:02:23] everything else therefore is a pretender
[1:02:25] because it is second
[1:02:27] there's only one first contrary to what
[1:02:30] they're teaching kids today there's only
[1:02:31] one first
[1:02:33] we don't all get we don't all get
[1:02:35] participation Awards there's only one
[1:02:37] first and that is the word that is the
[1:02:40] absolute that is the original amen
[1:02:41] Romans 3 4 says let God be true and
[1:02:44] every man a liar
[1:02:46] that is our absolute amen now listen he
[1:02:49] says the word is the expression of a
[1:02:51] thought it has to be a thought before it
[1:02:53] can be a word so God in the beginning
[1:02:55] gave the thought of what would be
[1:02:58] spoke the word for it to be then we
[1:03:02] received the word and it produces what
[1:03:04] God thought it was he said the word is
[1:03:07] the gospel in seed form so in other
[1:03:10] words what is and what will be may not
[1:03:13] look the same
[1:03:14] it takes time to show this thing to be
[1:03:18] what it really is there's a time element
[1:03:20] to the manifesting of the word because
[1:03:22] God is revealing this all through time
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:25] then he would say the word is the truth
[1:03:29] well if it's an absolute it has to be
[1:03:31] the truth amen
[1:03:33] he says
[1:03:35] the Bible said so Jesus said father
[1:03:37] sanctify them through the truth Thy word
[1:03:40] is truth
[1:03:41] then he would say Jesus said the word is
[1:03:44] the seed and every seed is a promise in
[1:03:48] there and if you can just take them
[1:03:50] seeds into your heart no matter what
[1:03:51] it's for God will honor it and it'll
[1:03:53] bring forth just exactly what it
[1:03:55] promised that means it'll produce
[1:03:57] eternal life it'll produce Faith it'll
[1:03:59] produce Joy love peace patience kindness
[1:04:01] all of these things it'll produce the
[1:04:04] changing power of God for your life
[1:04:06] it'll position you in the body of Christ
[1:04:08] it'll give you overcoming power every
[1:04:10] bit of it is in there as a promise it is
[1:04:13] a seed that's growing that's coming
[1:04:14] forth amen everything is is packed
[1:04:17] inside of that seed
[1:04:19] remember brother bam says you get the
[1:04:21] Holy Ghost he says it's it's like you
[1:04:23] just might only have a drop of what's in
[1:04:25] the scene but it's the exact same thing
[1:04:26] as in the sea that's what's in your life
[1:04:28] by the word is you've got everything
[1:04:30] that's in the word packed inside of you
[1:04:32] and all you need is a power to make it
[1:04:34] live
[1:04:35] all you need is a life inside of you
[1:04:37] that'll draw it out and then you've got
[1:04:39] exactly every bit that was in the ocean
[1:04:41] in the first place
[1:04:43] he would say this the word is the
[1:04:46] revelation of Jesus Christ the Bible
[1:04:49] said so Christ being revealed in his
[1:04:51] word and that really ties into the next
[1:04:52] one it says the word is the testimony
[1:04:56] of God remember Revelation 1 2 says who
[1:04:59] bear record of the word of God and the
[1:05:01] testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:05:03] then he would say God is going to judge
[1:05:06] the World by Jesus Christ and Christ in
[1:05:08] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:05:10] with God the Word was God and the Word
[1:05:11] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he
[1:05:13] said God and the word is the same he
[1:05:16] said this
[1:05:17] is God on print
[1:05:20] the word is a lot of things isn't it
[1:05:23] we so often limit it to this because
[1:05:26] this is the written portion but way
[1:05:27] before this was there was something else
[1:05:30] there was something else and that's what
[1:05:32] we want to tie all the way back to
[1:05:34] he would say the body sure was Christ it
[1:05:37] was the anointed one and if Christ means
[1:05:39] the anointed one and he's the same
[1:05:41] yesterday today and forever and he is
[1:05:43] the word then the word is the anointing
[1:05:46] if you abide in me and my word abide in
[1:05:49] you then say what you will he says it's
[1:05:51] the word of God the anointed word that's
[1:05:54] what does it remember John 6 63 says it
[1:05:57] is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[1:06:00] prophet of nothing the words that I
[1:06:01] speak unto you they are spirit and they
[1:06:04] are life so the word is the anointing
[1:06:07] amen then he says now the word is the
[1:06:10] conductor of the spirit because where
[1:06:12] the word is preached the spirit follows
[1:06:15] it wherever it goes why the spirit
[1:06:17] follows the word he says Oh I like that
[1:06:20] I like sound Bible teaching we like
[1:06:22] teaching don't we
[1:06:23] I love to sit down and hear the teaching
[1:06:26] but he says and
[1:06:29] don't stop at teaching and the Bible
[1:06:32] holy ghost coming back confirming Bible
[1:06:36] teaching
[1:06:37] acts 10 44 says while Peter yet spake
[1:06:40] these words the Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:06:43] which heard the word why the word was
[1:06:45] conducting the Holy Spirit down into
[1:06:47] their midst so that they could live the
[1:06:49] teaching that they were hearing
[1:06:51] so the word is a conductor of the Holy
[1:06:53] Spirit
[1:06:54] then he says the word assures us of the
[1:06:57] promise because it is the promise the
[1:06:59] word is the promise and the word is the
[1:07:02] God and the word is ours and we become
[1:07:04] the word and the word becomes us if you
[1:07:07] abide in me and my word in you then see
[1:07:09] it just becomes one great big family see
[1:07:11] it assures us because why well it's a
[1:07:16] part of us see
[1:07:17] second Corinthians 1 20 says for all the
[1:07:20] promises of God in him are yea
[1:07:22] are yes and in him amen so be it unto
[1:07:27] the glory of God by us
[1:07:31] then he would say this he is the light
[1:07:33] the truth the light and there is no
[1:07:36] darkness in him and he scatters the
[1:07:38] darkness when he comes in because he is
[1:07:40] the word the word is the light because
[1:07:44] he spoke and said let there be light
[1:07:45] that was the word that become light when
[1:07:48] he speaks this it's the light of that
[1:07:51] age each time remember Psalms 119 105
[1:07:54] says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and
[1:07:57] a light unto my path
[1:08:00] then he would say this he says there is
[1:08:03] your name on The Book of Life he says
[1:08:06] the Book of Life is the word of God
[1:08:08] because the word is God and God is the
[1:08:10] only thing that is life so your name was
[1:08:13] represented in the Bible before the
[1:08:15] Bible become on Word
[1:08:17] before this was ever printed see we look
[1:08:20] at this as this is where it is but
[1:08:22] before that was it had to be someplace
[1:08:24] else it had to be someplace else because
[1:08:26] before this was ever written we were in
[1:08:28] what we were in Christ we were there
[1:08:29] before the foundation of the world so
[1:08:31] you look at all of those things I just
[1:08:33] read three pages of quotes I think and
[1:08:35] you put it into one single slide and we
[1:08:38] see what is the word the word is all of
[1:08:40] these things and these are the
[1:08:41] attributes of God they're the attributes
[1:08:43] of the word they're the characteristics
[1:08:45] of the word they're the effect of the
[1:08:47] word
[1:08:48] all of these things are packaged into
[1:08:50] this and you look at that and you can
[1:08:52] see it's supernatural and and it's not
[1:08:54] it's supernatural in the way that we are
[1:08:56] and the way we we think of things
[1:08:58] because remember the word was first a
[1:09:00] thought it was an idea if we could put
[1:09:02] it that way but when we have an idea it
[1:09:05] usually just stays an idea doesn't it if
[1:09:07] we're to be honest most of our D ideas
[1:09:09] we don't even speak them much less
[1:09:11] produce them but when God thinks
[1:09:13] something it produces something because
[1:09:15] that's the nature of the supernatural
[1:09:17] God that we serve amen so it's because
[1:09:19] this is in the thought of God it is of
[1:09:22] god it becomes God and now because it's
[1:09:25] of him it has a power behind those
[1:09:27] thoughts that bring out what are
[1:09:29] supposed to be happening
[1:09:31] why our thoughts have very little power
[1:09:33] behind them
[1:09:35] I was reading this morning my devotions
[1:09:37] were were in the book of Isaiah where it
[1:09:39] says my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:09:42] why because his have power
[1:09:44] might have only my carnality behind it
[1:09:46] and my ways are not your ways
[1:09:50] because he speaks and it happens and so
[1:09:52] often we're trying to do everything and
[1:09:54] our speaking never lines up with what
[1:09:55] happens in the first place his ways work
[1:09:58] our ways don't his thoughts produce ours
[1:10:01] don't
[1:10:01] they don't create usually what do they
[1:10:04] do they destroy here's what I'm glad his
[1:10:06] ways aren't like my ways
[1:10:08] I'm glad that his ways are higher than
[1:10:09] mine amen
[1:10:12] but John takes us a little deeper we
[1:10:14] started with John 1 1 in the beginning
[1:10:15] was the word the word was with God the
[1:10:17] Word was God and we see this
[1:10:19] Supernatural in that
[1:10:21] and you say well how do I even fit in
[1:10:24] that that that's Perfection right there
[1:10:26] that's the absolute that's the beginning
[1:10:28] that is everything of God in there and
[1:10:31] now you want to stick Us in there how's
[1:10:32] that going to work well John does it he
[1:10:35] says the same was in the beginning with
[1:10:37] God so in other words all that was in
[1:10:40] the word was in the beginning with God
[1:10:43] if you can identify yourself in the word
[1:10:45] then you can put yourself right in the
[1:10:48] smack dab middle of that of that that
[1:10:49] picture we just showed you amen Paul
[1:10:52] that great prophet by the Holy Spirit
[1:10:54] take us all the way back to this point
[1:10:56] himself in the book of Ephesians he
[1:10:58] would say blessed be the God and father
[1:11:00] of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
[1:11:02] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:11:04] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[1:11:06] he had chosen Us in him
[1:11:09] that's Christ the anointed word
[1:11:11] the original before the foundation of
[1:11:14] the world that we should be holy and
[1:11:17] Without Blame before him in love so that
[1:11:19] means that's what's in the seed that's
[1:11:21] inside of you that's what is going to be
[1:11:23] produced is a person that is Holy and
[1:11:26] Without Blame before God in love amen
[1:11:28] that's what it's meant to produce that's
[1:11:30] what it's programmed to produce
[1:11:32] therefore that's what it's going to
[1:11:34] produce
[1:11:35] not because of anything you do but
[1:11:37] because the word has already declared
[1:11:39] that it's going to be and that's the
[1:11:41] certainty that we're resting upon amen
[1:11:43] we can't produce anything else if we're
[1:11:45] part of that Holy seed that seed that
[1:11:48] has no blame inside of it
[1:11:50] he says having predestinated us under
[1:11:53] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:11:55] to himself according to the good
[1:11:56] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[1:11:58] the glory of his grace wherein he had
[1:12:00] made us accepted in the Beloved brother
[1:12:03] Brian would say this he says now
[1:12:04] according to the word of God the bride
[1:12:06] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:12:09] world
[1:12:09] this choosing of the bride was purpose
[1:12:12] in themselves in Ephesians 1 9 he says
[1:12:14] and in Romans 9 11 it says that the
[1:12:16] purpose of God according to election
[1:12:18] might stand you can't read it any other
[1:12:20] way the heart purpose
[1:12:23] the Eternal purpose of God was to take a
[1:12:26] bride of his own choosing
[1:12:29] and that purpose was in himself that
[1:12:32] means you don't have anything to say
[1:12:33] about it
[1:12:35] good or bad positive or negative it
[1:12:37] doesn't matter he's already chosen you
[1:12:39] and being Eternal it was decreed before
[1:12:42] the foundation of the world he says
[1:12:44] watch carefully now and see this before
[1:12:46] there was ever a speck of Stardust
[1:12:48] before God was God he says God's an
[1:12:52] object of adoration and no one was there
[1:12:54] to worship him so he was at that time
[1:12:55] only potentially God he said he was
[1:12:58] known only as eternal spirit the bride
[1:13:01] was already in his mind yes she was he
[1:13:05] says she was existing in his thoughts
[1:13:07] and what about those thoughts of God he
[1:13:09] says they are Eternal are they not the
[1:13:12] Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you
[1:13:15] he's trying to drive it home are the
[1:13:17] thoughts of God Eternal he says if you
[1:13:19] can see this you will see many things
[1:13:24] he says God is unchangeable in both
[1:13:27] Essence and behavior God is infinite in
[1:13:30] his ability so therefore he is God he as
[1:13:33] God must be omniscient he must know all
[1:13:36] things he says if he is omniscient then
[1:13:39] he is not now learning
[1:13:42] he says nor is he taking counsel even
[1:13:44] with himself nor is he at any time
[1:13:47] adding to his knowledge if he can add to
[1:13:49] his knowledge then he's not omniscient
[1:13:51] the best we could say is that sometime
[1:13:53] he will be but that is not scriptural he
[1:13:56] is omniscient he never had a new thought
[1:13:58] about anything because all his thoughts
[1:14:01] he always had and always will have and
[1:14:03] he knows the end from the beginning
[1:14:05] because he is God
[1:14:09] he says thus the thoughts of God are
[1:14:12] eternal
[1:14:13] but then he says they are real
[1:14:17] isn't that a beautiful thing that his
[1:14:19] thoughts don't just stay in his mind
[1:14:23] then he just have a beautiful mind but
[1:14:25] he takes them out and he speaks them and
[1:14:28] that word Goes Forth with power It Goes
[1:14:30] Forth with purpose and it becomes real
[1:14:35] it has to become real it has to
[1:14:37] materialize it has to manifest it says
[1:14:40] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:14:42] blueprint he is drawn up and which one
[1:14:44] day will be translated into substance
[1:14:46] and form he says but they are already
[1:14:48] real and eternal and part of God
[1:14:52] I'm an engineer
[1:14:54] I'm sure brother Matt can identify with
[1:14:56] this sometimes we're designing something
[1:14:58] up to match a particular issue or a
[1:15:01] problem where we're making a machine or
[1:15:02] a tool or a jig or something like that
[1:15:04] and we drive once
[1:15:08] do we ever get it right the first time
[1:15:09] brother Matt Almost Never
[1:15:13] and so what do we do
[1:15:15] that thought though it's on paper it's
[1:15:18] written we rip it up and we throw it
[1:15:20] aside or if it's on a computer you know
[1:15:22] what we do we delete that file and we
[1:15:23] start all over again or we start to
[1:15:25] modify it he says God's not like that
[1:15:27] God gets it perfect the first time
[1:15:30] and then he just moves on with it
[1:15:33] amen he says these thoughts are already
[1:15:35] real and eternal and part of God these
[1:15:38] who are of the royal seed are the
[1:15:40] elective God they are the predestinated
[1:15:43] for known of God and we're in the mind
[1:15:45] of God and His Thoughts he says in very
[1:15:48] plain language the true bride of Christ
[1:15:50] was in the mind of God eternally though
[1:15:53] not expressed until each came forth in
[1:15:55] the designated decreed season
[1:15:58] you're here because this is where you
[1:16:00] were meant to be
[1:16:02] brother Branham said this is the
[1:16:03] greatest age you could ever live in
[1:16:06] you want to if you want an encouragement
[1:16:08] this evening God chose you to be in the
[1:16:12] greatest age that's ever been in this
[1:16:13] earth
[1:16:14] that's the caliber of the people that
[1:16:17] I'm talking to tonight
[1:16:19] I hope I'm a part of that that I'm not
[1:16:22] just talking but I'm a part of it that
[1:16:23] he picked he saved the best for last
[1:16:26] in the most difficult and the most
[1:16:28] twisted and the most sick in the most
[1:16:30] evil age he chose you because in your
[1:16:33] thoughts you have everything you need to
[1:16:35] come out of this age an overcomer a
[1:16:37] Victor somebody that has power and
[1:16:39] authority to what
[1:16:41] take Satan in every aspect out of your
[1:16:43] life
[1:16:44] that's what he's put inside of you as a
[1:16:46] seed he says as each member came forth
[1:16:49] it became expressed and took its place
[1:16:52] in the body he says thus this bride is
[1:16:54] the literal spoken word seed Pride
[1:16:59] very familiar quote I know for each of
[1:17:01] us but he says what we're real we're
[1:17:04] Eternal we're expressed the prophet is
[1:17:06] saying this about the Bride of Jesus
[1:17:07] Christ he says this is something that
[1:17:09] began ever Before Time began
[1:17:11] we can see what God Said in his word and
[1:17:14] we read in this and you know we spend so
[1:17:16] much time talking about Moses and the
[1:17:17] children of Israel and we see the great
[1:17:19] promises and the prophecies
[1:17:21] and we can look and we say God did what
[1:17:24] he said he was going to do you know why
[1:17:26] God did that so that we can look today
[1:17:28] and say as he spoke those things for
[1:17:30] them he spoke the same in a a special
[1:17:33] word for us and he's going to do exactly
[1:17:35] what he's been doing all Through the
[1:17:36] Ages
[1:17:37] that's why brother Brandon would come at
[1:17:39] this age and he would show us everything
[1:17:41] that's happened in six ages perfectly
[1:17:44] perfectly according to the scriptures so
[1:17:47] that you can read your portion of the
[1:17:49] scripture and say he's going to do it
[1:17:50] for me
[1:17:51] he's not going to leave me hanging
[1:17:54] it may take time
[1:17:56] but he's not going to leave me hanging
[1:17:59] remember that that story brother Brown
[1:18:01] would talk about that that rich young
[1:18:02] man that went to the ranch and he was
[1:18:04] looking for a wife and all the girls
[1:18:05] were around and trying to catch his eye
[1:18:07] and he got real sick and tired of it he
[1:18:08] went out back and he saw a girl washing
[1:18:10] dishes and something about her Drew him
[1:18:12] to her and he fell in love with her and
[1:18:15] he says I'm going to come back at an
[1:18:16] appointed time
[1:18:19] he says you be ready I'll be there
[1:18:22] and brother Brandon would say he didn't
[1:18:24] come in the morning
[1:18:27] and she had to stay there robed in her
[1:18:29] wedding dress prepared having testified
[1:18:32] of the man that was coming for her that
[1:18:35] rich man coming for her and he says
[1:18:37] they're making fun of her and they're
[1:18:38] saying you really think that he meant it
[1:18:39] and this and that the other thing and
[1:18:41] then he says and then come the sounds of
[1:18:42] her feet and then came the carriages and
[1:18:45] the coaches he says he rides up and he
[1:18:47] takes her and he walks takes her away
[1:18:48] and they're left standing there saying
[1:18:50] how did that happen
[1:18:51] they didn't see it happening why she
[1:18:53] knew that she had his word and that he
[1:18:56] would be there when he said he would and
[1:18:58] she had to go through the score and she
[1:18:59] had to go through the waiting she had to
[1:19:00] go through the trial of it all but he
[1:19:02] showed up exactly the way he said he was
[1:19:04] going to exactly when he had to amen if
[1:19:07] he did it for them what's going to keep
[1:19:08] it from doing it for us
[1:19:10] that's his promises at every word that
[1:19:12] he says is going to come to pass
[1:19:14] brother Brown's telling us you're in
[1:19:16] there you're in here just the same way
[1:19:18] as every single other child of God we
[1:19:20] look at those Heroes of the faith in
[1:19:21] Hebrews 11. you are no less in the
[1:19:23] scripture though not named specifically
[1:19:25] than Abraham and Moses and Samuel and
[1:19:28] David and Joseph and all these ones your
[1:19:31] name is written there just as clearly as
[1:19:32] there there's is but it's under the name
[1:19:34] of the Bride
[1:19:36] the elect the elect lady that's your
[1:19:39] inclusion amen that's why you've got to
[1:19:41] receive a message for your age that's
[1:19:42] why you've got to receive the word for
[1:19:43] your age so you know what's supposed to
[1:19:45] be coming your way
[1:19:46] but he's saying look don't look at this
[1:19:48] as an external thing
[1:19:50] I think that's the greatest thing that
[1:19:51] we can recognize is that this word is
[1:19:53] not external
[1:19:55] it's internal it's built into us it's a
[1:19:57] part of us we're a part of it it's one
[1:19:59] big body we're one big entity so he's
[1:20:02] saying don't look outside but recognize
[1:20:04] yourself inside of it and that's going
[1:20:06] to put you in a whole different
[1:20:07] perspective
[1:20:08] so now you're not going to something you
[1:20:10] are something
[1:20:11] you're not going to be something you are
[1:20:13] something do not perfectly expressed yet
[1:20:16] and so you're looking now by eyes of
[1:20:18] faith that I am this
[1:20:21] even though it doesn't yet appear what I
[1:20:22] shall be
[1:20:24] amen
[1:20:26] so we take that first slide that we saw
[1:20:28] and buried inside of that the very
[1:20:31] attributes the very character the very
[1:20:33] nature of the word we have the Bride of
[1:20:34] Jesus Christ embedded right in the
[1:20:36] middle by his eternal thoughts Before
[1:20:38] Time Ever began
[1:20:40] what is it a literal spoken word seed
[1:20:43] bride he said you were in his thoughts
[1:20:45] therefore you are part of the spoken
[1:20:47] word therefore you are part of the
[1:20:49] written word therefore you've got to
[1:20:50] come forth exactly as he was talking
[1:20:52] about amen
[1:20:54] once we see ourselves in our position as
[1:20:56] true believers what do we start to
[1:20:57] understand that there's a word behind us
[1:21:01] right and so that means there's an
[1:21:03] intent and there's a purpose and there's
[1:21:05] a power and there's a call and there's a
[1:21:08] push and there's a watering and there's
[1:21:10] a feeding and all these things and what
[1:21:12] is it doing it's rotting away this
[1:21:14] prickly Old Shell that's around us and
[1:21:16] it's producing the DNA of the word
[1:21:18] that's buried deep inside of us that see
[1:21:20] Gene of God that's in US amen
[1:21:22] why because his word never returns to
[1:21:25] him void
[1:21:26] John would continue and he would say
[1:21:28] this all things were made by him Christ
[1:21:31] the word and without him was not
[1:21:33] anything made that was made
[1:21:35] that's why the original Earth was
[1:21:36] perfect it was a word Earth it was made
[1:21:39] by Christ the person of the word it was
[1:21:41] word upon word
[1:21:43] that's what made it perfect brother
[1:21:45] Brown would put this way he says now so
[1:21:47] were you in if you've got eternal life
[1:21:49] you were in God before there ever was a
[1:21:52] world you are a part A Son of God an
[1:21:55] attribute of God he knew the very age
[1:21:58] you were coming he predestinated you to
[1:22:00] that age to take that place and no one
[1:22:03] else can take it he says I don't care
[1:22:06] how many impersonizations and things
[1:22:08] you've got to be there because he knew
[1:22:10] you would be there and now you are made
[1:22:12] manifest now you can fellowship with him
[1:22:15] and that's what he wants he's longing
[1:22:17] for Fellowship to be worshiped
[1:22:20] he says and if your life was not always
[1:22:22] an attribute in God you're just a mimic
[1:22:25] of Christianity
[1:22:26] see he says there'll be millions and
[1:22:28] billions of them they'll just be mimics
[1:22:31] of Christianity we see that with esan
[1:22:33] Jacob
[1:22:35] tried and he tried and he tried to live
[1:22:38] right he tried to desire right he tried
[1:22:40] to be right he tried to find a place of
[1:22:42] repentance with tears yet he could not
[1:22:44] do it why because he was just copying
[1:22:46] what he had seen
[1:22:48] there was nothing in him that was
[1:22:49] calling out for it
[1:22:51] brother I would say this it's got to
[1:22:52] come from the inside which is the word
[1:22:55] from the beginning
[1:22:57] he's saying that this Christian walk
[1:22:59] that we have the reason why we come to
[1:23:01] church the reason why we live the way we
[1:23:03] do the reason why we talk the way we do
[1:23:04] the reason why we do our hair the way we
[1:23:06] do the way we dress we do all these
[1:23:08] different things he says it's because
[1:23:09] there's something inside of us that's
[1:23:12] pushing out
[1:23:13] it is not legalism it's legalism for us
[1:23:16] in that we can't escape it
[1:23:18] it's legal because it's in us it's
[1:23:20] written in us it's a part of our DNA
[1:23:22] it's a part of our very inner being so
[1:23:24] we can't escape it but everyone else he
[1:23:26] says they're mimicking it they're just
[1:23:28] trying to be a Christian rather than
[1:23:30] being a Christian
[1:23:32] you are or you aren't and you can't put
[1:23:34] on a robe of Christianity and be a
[1:23:35] Christian you just have to be one from
[1:23:38] what the beginning he says in the
[1:23:40] beginning was of the creation of God
[1:23:42] when God began to create he bring you
[1:23:44] into existence you see you started back
[1:23:47] there as a seed and worked down to where
[1:23:49] you are now he says and then you were
[1:23:51] all in Christ and then when Christ died
[1:23:55] he died to redeem all of you and you are
[1:23:57] a part of this word he says oh the Bible
[1:24:00] all of it he says it's precept upon
[1:24:02] precept line upon line here a little
[1:24:05] there little not one jot or a tittle
[1:24:07] shall fail we're talking about the
[1:24:10] certainty of a seed and catch what he's
[1:24:11] saying he's saying if you were in Christ
[1:24:13] in the beginning then there's something
[1:24:15] that's bringing you to where you are
[1:24:17] today
[1:24:18] what is it it's a word that's encoded
[1:24:20] inside of you
[1:24:22] you know we look at
[1:24:24] programming today
[1:24:26] and if you program something
[1:24:29] and you tell it to execute you tell it
[1:24:32] to run it'll do everything that's
[1:24:34] written in that code
[1:24:35] unless it hits an error
[1:24:38] and then it can go into a loop
[1:24:40] then it can just kick itself out of the
[1:24:42] program but he's talking about in God's
[1:24:44] perfect program and he says not one jot
[1:24:46] not one Tittle not one line of code not
[1:24:49] one line of DNA what not one not not one
[1:24:52] word promise none of it can fail
[1:24:56] not one jot or tittle can fail let me
[1:24:59] tell you some of us are just jots and
[1:25:02] some of us are just tittles but not a
[1:25:04] one of us can fail as long as we're part
[1:25:07] of the word that's what he's trying to
[1:25:08] tell us amen it's not that we decided to
[1:25:11] come to God it's not that we decided to
[1:25:13] accept the message of the hour it's not
[1:25:15] that we decided to become a Christian
[1:25:16] but there's a jot inside of us there's a
[1:25:19] tittle inside of us that says I cannot
[1:25:21] fail and so it brings us to a place
[1:25:23] where it can produce that jot or tittle
[1:25:25] that's written in the word inside of us
[1:25:27] amen not one little bit he says will
[1:25:31] fail you'll produce what's In You by the
[1:25:33] predestinated thought
[1:25:35] word of God
[1:25:37] in your age in your season by his will
[1:25:41] in his timing not yours amen you will be
[1:25:45] the manifested word for this day you
[1:25:47] will be Christ the word on display
[1:25:49] because you come from the word you are
[1:25:52] the word and therefore the word will
[1:25:54] come out it has to because the word
[1:25:56] cannot fail
[1:25:58] amen
[1:26:00] but here's the thing where the word in a
[1:26:03] shell
[1:26:04] and that shell is Prickly
[1:26:07] it stinks
[1:26:08] and then it stinks it's rotten
[1:26:13] sometimes it's not so nice to be around
[1:26:14] when life's coming out because of the
[1:26:16] rotten flesh that's on the outside amen
[1:26:18] and we look at that
[1:26:20] and we say how can that be the word but
[1:26:22] look to the word that's coming out don't
[1:26:24] look at what's breaking away as the word
[1:26:26] comes forth
[1:26:27] as you see it breaking away say that's
[1:26:30] what proves it's the word coming forth
[1:26:31] because all that's rotting and dying
[1:26:33] away has nothing to do with what's
[1:26:34] inside of me that's what we want to
[1:26:36] focus on don't focus on your faults and
[1:26:39] failures hey you got false and failures
[1:26:40] I got false and failures take them to
[1:26:42] the Lord
[1:26:43] and say Lord kill them
[1:26:45] Rob them destroy them
[1:26:48] but above all bring the word out of that
[1:26:50] rottenness don't let me just rot here
[1:26:52] because there's a lot of people just
[1:26:54] rotting
[1:26:55] because there's nothing inside of them
[1:26:56] they're trying to bring forth something
[1:26:58] and they're they're bringing forth
[1:26:59] purple hair and they're bringing forth
[1:27:01] crazy clothes and they're bringing forth
[1:27:02] crazy music and they're bringing forth
[1:27:04] crazy doctrines and they're bringing
[1:27:05] forth all these alphabet everything
[1:27:08] why they're trying to produce a life but
[1:27:10] there's no life inside of them but for
[1:27:12] us as that rottenness breaks there's a
[1:27:14] real life there's a word life that comes
[1:27:15] out of it amen we don't focus on the
[1:27:18] dead rotting part
[1:27:19] that's why we need the blood
[1:27:21] remember the word that's coming out of
[1:27:23] it is going to be perfect because it is
[1:27:25] the word amen we're focused on living
[1:27:27] and coming to maturity
[1:27:29] program would say then see
[1:27:31] God came down and the character of God
[1:27:34] was Christ he was the reflection he was
[1:27:37] God made visible he says notice God made
[1:27:40] visible in the beginning was God he
[1:27:42] wasn't even God then no God's an object
[1:27:44] of worship the only thing he was was the
[1:27:46] Eternal and in him were attributes and
[1:27:49] those attributes were thoughts and those
[1:27:51] thoughts were expressed to words and
[1:27:53] word was made manifest what is it he
[1:27:55] says it's all God becoming tangible
[1:28:01] we're tangible
[1:28:03] we're the tangible word
[1:28:06] that is revealing Christ in this age
[1:28:08] you can pinch us you can touch us you
[1:28:10] can hug us you can slap us
[1:28:13] you can like us you can dislike us but
[1:28:15] we are the tangible God being revealed
[1:28:18] we are the word being made tangible he
[1:28:20] says and you are a part of God and Jesus
[1:28:22] came to redeem those that was put on the
[1:28:24] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:28:26] foundation of the world it was in God's
[1:28:29] thoughts and that's what he come to
[1:28:31] redeem he says in them as soon as it
[1:28:34] strikes to them they see it because the
[1:28:37] life is in there
[1:28:41] that's why brother Mark could read an ad
[1:28:43] and something would strike him and
[1:28:45] immediately he responded because there
[1:28:47] was a life inside of him
[1:28:50] that summer takes longer than that
[1:28:53] we've all got to have our own experience
[1:28:56] we've got to have our own revelation of
[1:28:57] Christ the word to us but there's a time
[1:28:59] where it strikes and something responds
[1:29:02] something comes out why because that's
[1:29:04] what happens to the word when the word
[1:29:06] strikes the word something's going to
[1:29:07] happen
[1:29:08] he says but if the life innocent in
[1:29:10] there then what can they do see they
[1:29:12] don't see it they'll never see it see
[1:29:14] and the whole thing is Jesus said at
[1:29:16] that day you'll know I am in the Father
[1:29:18] the father and me I in you and you and
[1:29:21] me he says the whole thing is God
[1:29:24] becoming material I love that the whole
[1:29:28] thing
[1:29:29] this whole word is about God becoming
[1:29:32] material
[1:29:34] it's manifesting time he says like a
[1:29:37] husband and wife becoming one together
[1:29:39] God and his church becoming one
[1:29:42] he said and remember if you never was in
[1:29:44] God's thoughts you'll never be with God
[1:29:48] how many knows that he was a redeemer
[1:29:49] were then anything redeemed has to come
[1:29:52] back where it fell from so if he come to
[1:29:54] redeem us how could we one time didn't
[1:29:56] have to be redeemed and we were all born
[1:29:58] and sin shaped in iniquity come to the
[1:30:00] world speaking lies it shows that the
[1:30:02] real Christian is an attribute of God's
[1:30:04] thinking before there was a world or a
[1:30:07] star or air or anything else it's
[1:30:10] Eternal and he comes back comes to
[1:30:13] redeem us back it's God's thought spoke
[1:30:16] into a word made manifest and brought
[1:30:18] back to his thought
[1:30:20] we're not going back to his thought as
[1:30:22] in in his mind we're going back to the
[1:30:24] thought that was in his mind we're
[1:30:26] materializing the thought amen we're
[1:30:28] becoming exactly what was in his mind
[1:30:30] because today we're all twisted up Satan
[1:30:32] got his fingers in the pie and he messed
[1:30:34] up all of humanity and so there's a
[1:30:36] redeeming work coming now by the power
[1:30:38] of the spoken word to what bring us back
[1:30:41] into the original image thought that God
[1:30:43] had in his mind before we all began amen
[1:30:46] I'm going to read one more quote before
[1:30:47] we close here
[1:30:49] because I want to end on a high note
[1:30:50] because I'm trying to let you see who
[1:30:52] you are
[1:30:53] what you are
[1:30:55] where you came from where you started
[1:30:57] what you're a part of what's inside of
[1:31:00] you what God said about you what God's
[1:31:01] doing for you and all these things
[1:31:03] we look at you look at what I'm talking
[1:31:06] about here tonight and the only way
[1:31:07] we've got this is we heard a voice from
[1:31:10] heaven
[1:31:11] that's the only way we've got it you
[1:31:12] will not find a lick of this in the
[1:31:15] denominations today
[1:31:17] that can take us all the way back to
[1:31:19] Before Time began to the very thoughts
[1:31:21] and mind of God and say you were there
[1:31:23] therefore you will be
[1:31:26] you won't find it you won't you won't
[1:31:28] see they can't even grasp the idea of
[1:31:31] true predestination because
[1:31:32] predestination as they preach it is that
[1:31:34] you made a choice and God saw your
[1:31:36] choice and the prophet of God's taking
[1:31:38] us all the way back and saying he chose
[1:31:39] you he put you are an attribute you are
[1:31:43] a thought you are a characteristic of
[1:31:45] God and that's why you are going to make
[1:31:47] it because you are a part of the word
[1:31:50] you're not choosing it he did it he made
[1:31:52] you that that's what's coming forth as
[1:31:54] the very thought that God had for you of
[1:31:57] you as what a materialization of God in
[1:32:00] this world today we are blessed we're
[1:32:03] blessed to hear Jesus said blessed are
[1:32:05] your ears blessed are your eyes for they
[1:32:07] see and your ears for they hear them
[1:32:09] amen
[1:32:10] he said in the beginning was the word
[1:32:13] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:32:15] was God he said see the word was in God
[1:32:18] it was God it was his thoughts that was
[1:32:21] with him always he said God's thoughts
[1:32:23] are as Eternal as God is
[1:32:27] so if you're a thought of God
[1:32:29] you're as Eternal as he is
[1:32:31] brother Brown would say we skipped our
[1:32:33] theophany and came down here we didn't
[1:32:34] realize what we were and we come down
[1:32:37] here and we have to realize that here we
[1:32:38] have to fight our way back we're in a
[1:32:40] Redemption process to bring it back he
[1:32:41] says but you're as Eternal as God as
[1:32:43] amen he says that ain't skilled milk
[1:32:45] brother here it comes he says God's
[1:32:47] thoughts was his word in the beginning
[1:32:48] he says that's in eternity now when
[1:32:52] beginning first started time he says we
[1:32:55] are literally the beginning of it all
[1:32:57] see his thoughts are what he was
[1:33:00] that's you too what your thoughts is is
[1:33:02] what you are no matter when you what you
[1:33:05] try to live by something else your
[1:33:06] thoughts is what you are you might go
[1:33:08] along and act like a nice fellow but in
[1:33:10] your heart you're an adulteress or
[1:33:12] whatever it is he says that's what you
[1:33:13] are your thoughts
[1:33:15] that's how you know one of the ways you
[1:33:17] know you've got the holy spirit is when
[1:33:19] your thoughts and your nature changes
[1:33:20] and you desire something different than
[1:33:22] you used to deserve
[1:33:23] because we're all born the children of
[1:33:25] Wrath
[1:33:26] we're all born in sin-shaped iniquity
[1:33:28] come to the world speaking lies as he
[1:33:29] would say but when your thoughts start
[1:33:31] to become like his thoughts you know
[1:33:32] there's a work going on
[1:33:35] he says and God's thoughts were his word
[1:33:37] that was with him and in him
[1:33:40] so you were with him and you were in him
[1:33:42] and it was God God's thoughts were
[1:33:45] expressed in the human body May fashion
[1:33:47] dwelt Among Us he says there you are now
[1:33:49] if you have eternal life today you are
[1:33:53] in God and by God's being in you you are
[1:33:57] God's expressed thought
[1:34:01] little you
[1:34:03] little me is God's expressed thought
[1:34:06] today
[1:34:07] I'll say this
[1:34:09] we're not big thoughts
[1:34:12] there's a bunch of us
[1:34:13] and brother Dale's got a little thought
[1:34:15] and sister Amber's got a little thought
[1:34:17] and brother Jim's got a little thought
[1:34:18] and sister Brenda has a different one
[1:34:19] and Becca and Selena each one of us is a
[1:34:22] portion of God
[1:34:24] and we have a little thought
[1:34:26] and maybe one is stability
[1:34:28] or commitment
[1:34:30] or strength or Grace
[1:34:33] or patience
[1:34:35] some of us are expressions of healing
[1:34:38] some of us are expressions maybe of
[1:34:39] power and authority in a way that others
[1:34:41] aren't but each one of us is a thought
[1:34:43] of God we are a portion of the express
[1:34:45] word of God today he says who then don't
[1:34:48] listen to any reasonings lest your crown
[1:34:51] be taken and given to another
[1:34:53] remember circumstances can trim you down
[1:34:56] it won't change you but it can trim you
[1:34:58] down and your glory can go to another
[1:35:01] he says don't take any reasonings at all
[1:35:03] just believe what God Said is the truth
[1:35:06] and stay with it amen God bless you
[1:35:09] let's stand together if we would
[1:35:12] I know I'm teaching and I don't want to
[1:35:13] take us too long and honestly sometimes
[1:35:15] I get going in this and I start
[1:35:17] preaching and I never know when how long
[1:35:19] it's going to be so I try to keep it a
[1:35:20] little bit tighter tonight amen but I
[1:35:22] want you to see
[1:35:23] you're not just here today
[1:35:25] by some choice or by happenstance or or
[1:35:28] just some freak event that somehow
[1:35:31] brought us here remember you're here
[1:35:33] because God has ordained you to be here
[1:35:35] he's ordained you to be a believer he's
[1:35:37] ordained you to be an overcomer he's
[1:35:38] ordained you to be the word expressed in
[1:35:40] your own way
[1:35:42] as he has designed it for this day in
[1:35:44] this age and there's nothing that can
[1:35:46] stop us from doing today man
[1:35:48] what did he say don't listen to any
[1:35:51] reasonings he says just believe what God
[1:35:54] Said is the truth and stay with it
[1:35:57] that's the nature of our believers they
[1:35:58] stick with it
[1:35:59] and then they believe it
[1:36:01] and against all hope they believe it
[1:36:04] and they keep believing it and they keep
[1:36:06] believing it and they keep believing it
[1:36:08] until it comes out
[1:36:10] why because his word will not return
[1:36:13] unto him void
[1:36:15] his word always agrees with his word
[1:36:16] brother Brown would say I didn't put it
[1:36:18] in here he said he had a quote he says
[1:36:19] he says if you're the word then you can
[1:36:21] never disagree with the word because
[1:36:22] you'll be disagreeing with your own self
[1:36:25] you're literally built into it it's in
[1:36:27] your nature to agree with the word of
[1:36:29] God because you're a part of it and it's
[1:36:32] a part of you amen amen let's bow our
[1:36:34] heads Heavenly Father

[1:36:51] little higher Lord that as we read your
[1:36:53] word Lord as we hear your message for
[1:36:55] this age Lord that it would help us to
[1:36:57] see that this is not just a little event
[1:36:59] Lord but it's a great event it's a great
[1:37:01] calling out of the loved elect lady Lord

[1:37:09] going to be a perfect image of that
[1:37:11] original word

[2:09:01] the Bible on my
[2:09:03] on my phone and

[2:09:20] chances of that happening then they're
[2:09:22] taking her drive 200 miles
[2:09:25] to come here and I hear the same thing
[2:09:28] witness to me

[2:09:34] fulfilled
