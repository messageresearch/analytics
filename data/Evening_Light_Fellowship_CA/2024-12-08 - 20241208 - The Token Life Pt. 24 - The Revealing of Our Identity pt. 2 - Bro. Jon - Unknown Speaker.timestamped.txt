[41:34] Genesis chapter 1 it's good to be back
[41:35] appreciate brother Mark taking the
[41:37] service on Wednesday night heard good
[41:39] reports about it amen I didn't get to
[41:41] listen to it but I got to see his notes
[41:43] and and there's some wonderful things in
[41:45] there that tied in even as we will be
[41:47] speaking on some things this morning
[41:49] amen just uh obviously many of you have
[41:52] heard I didn't get my moose I uh Nelson
[41:56] put me on on four and I had two in my
[41:58] sights and I picked one and fired and
[42:02] apparently I didn't hit it so it was 150
[42:04] M Easy Shot should have had it don't
[42:07] know what happened um and I have no
[42:09] excuse for that this morning but I got a
[42:11] lot closer to another one I got 2 meters
[42:13] away from one and missed that one but
[42:15] that was a good Miss because I was
[42:16] driving brother Mark Subaru at the time
[42:18] and uh a big big cow launched herself
[42:22] Cal moose launched herself out of the
[42:23] ditch as I was coming home from Brother
[42:25] Barry and sister Darlene guys and she uh
[42:28] I was traveling very slowly by God's
[42:29] grace I was doing under the speed limit
[42:31] on new Bay Road which is a miracle in
[42:33] and of itself cuz nobody does it amen
[42:35] but she just jumped out and uh she knew
[42:38] she couldn't get across and so she
[42:39] turned at the last second and just
[42:40] started Galloping next to me at 40 km an
[42:42] hour so uh your Subaru is in one piece
[42:45] brother Mark not a scratch on for as I
[42:47] know so God's grace there but uh you
[42:51] know if I if I would have hit her I
[42:52] probably would have put a tag on her
[42:54] just to get one no I wouldn't have done
[42:56] that I but I do I did get to see brother
[42:58] Barry sister Darlene of course brother
[43:00] Nelson guy helped me for the first day
[43:02] and a half went to over to brother Hank
[43:04] and sister vernes as well and had a
[43:06] wonderful time with them didn't make it
[43:07] to brother uh to see brother Doug and
[43:10] sister Beverly unfortunately since I was
[43:11] hunting the whole time and just not able
[43:13] to get away it's about uh almost 3 hours
[43:16] 2 hours and 45 minutes each way so uh
[43:19] you have to take a full day to go see
[43:20] them and then Blanc and the kids are
[43:22] traveling back this week want to
[43:24] remember them in prayer they leave late
[43:25] late Tuesday night fly through the night
[43:27] get here Wednesday just before church so
[43:29] want to remember them brother Dale safe
[43:31] in Evon I don't know if you mentioned
[43:33] that but I spoke to him this morning so
[43:34] we thank the Lord for that amen and then
[43:37] we also want to remember the December
[43:40] 21st I think it is the Christmas program
[43:42] remember each F 22nd uh each family with
[43:46] children is supposed to do a song or a
[43:49] testimony or scripture recital or
[43:52] something like that so um sister
[43:54] Priscilla I haven't talked to her about
[43:55] this but you're supposed to let her know
[43:57] what you're going to be doing sooner
[43:59] rather than later so please reach out to
[44:01] her so she can put together a program
[44:03] and do that amen by God's grace amen
[44:07] Genesis chapter 1 says in the beginning
[44:10] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[44:12] the Earth was without form and void and
[44:15] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[44:16] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[44:18] face of the waters and God said let
[44:21] there be light and there was light and
[44:23] God saw the light that it was good and
[44:26] God did something
[44:27] God divided the light from the darkness
[44:30] amen God bless you you can have your
[44:32] seats this morning we're taking a second
[44:34] service on this thought of the revealing
[44:36] of our identity by the Holy Ghost amen
[44:38] and I thought it was very interesting
[44:40] very good what brother Mark was
[44:41] preaching about on Wednesday night like
[44:43] I said I wasn't able to listen but just
[44:45] looking at the notes there were some
[44:46] things that really clicked into where we
[44:48] were going uh for this service I knew
[44:50] well ahead of time where I was going to
[44:52] be preaching the Lord had kind of given
[44:53] me a message already so it was wonderful
[44:56] to see that I love to see continuity and
[44:58] support in these things and kind of
[44:59] filling in some of the cracks and
[45:01] building a foundation and building it up
[45:03] hey it's line upon line it's word upon
[45:05] Lord we've got a five-fold Ministry
[45:07] we've got Elders here we've got whatever
[45:09] God needs for us amen so I believe that
[45:11] God works on each heart and each soul to
[45:13] to bring what the people need amen but
[45:15] we're talking about the Holy Spirit this
[45:17] morning and how it reveals Lord our our
[45:19] our identity how it shows us who we are
[45:21] because if we don't see who we are how
[45:23] can we progress in our Christian walk
[45:25] amen how can we even start our Christian
[45:26] walk if we don't know that we're
[45:28] children of God but we know that you
[45:30] can't be in a Plan of Redemption if you
[45:32] weren't a part of God in the very
[45:34] beginning that that that word re or that
[45:36] that that that uh that start of the word
[45:39] the re means you have to be something if
[45:41] in order to be re something amen I can't
[45:44] be renewed if I wasn't new I can't be
[45:47] reset if I wasn't in order before I
[45:49] can't be restarted if at some point I
[45:51] wasn't started already so you can't be
[45:53] redeemed if you weren't deemed at one
[45:56] point amen you can't be redeemed back to
[45:58] God if you weren't in God in the first
[46:00] place amen so we understand that this is
[46:03] something that was way before we ever
[46:05] came into existence in this natural life
[46:07] and born to our natural parents and
[46:09] these different things amen and so
[46:11] there's an opportunity when we are re
[46:13] anything to go back to our original
[46:16] condition and that's what the Plan of
[46:17] Redemption is it's to bring us back to
[46:19] our original position in Christ I like
[46:22] how brother Mark talked about Adam's
[46:23] creation and God's creation and we're
[46:26] not a part of Adam's creation because
[46:27] Adam's creation fell and we're here and
[46:30] we're in it but we're in it but we're
[46:31] not of it amen that is not our source
[46:33] it's not our strength it's not our life
[46:35] in any way we're not a part of it we're
[46:37] we're really a part of God's creation
[46:40] and that's what the holy spirit is here
[46:41] to do is to show us who we are and what
[46:44] we're supposed to be and that's what the
[46:46] whole process of redemption is about
[46:48] amen so we're just here for for the ride
[46:51] really that's what we are this process
[46:53] amen we're not here as brother Mark said
[46:55] to direct to control
[46:57] amen but we're here to surrender to keep
[47:00] our lives clean by by Clean living to
[47:02] make ourselves accessible to him so that
[47:04] he can do a work to change us and then
[47:07] in that work be able to use us for the
[47:09] benefit of his work in the kingdom of
[47:12] God Amen but we read in Genesis 1 and
[47:14] this was the same scripture we opened
[47:15] with last Sunday but we read in Genesis
[47:18] 1 how God created light and we talked
[47:20] before what that light was but I want to
[47:22] focus more on that that fourth verse and
[47:24] it says and God saw the light that was
[47:27] good and God divided the light from the
[47:30] darkness now I I put up this photo of
[47:32] the Earth because you can see that
[47:33] there's a portion of the earth that's in
[47:35] light and there's a portion of the earth
[47:37] that's in darkness and I don't care how
[47:39] much you think you're in light if you're
[47:41] in darkness you're in darkness the
[47:43] shadow is the Shadow the light is the
[47:45] light and there is no in between now you
[47:47] will see here there's a fuzzy point
[47:50] where that light transitions Into
[47:52] Darkness or that light starts to fade
[47:54] away and darkness starts to come in and
[47:56] unfort fortunately that's where the
[47:57] majority of people seem to want to live
[47:59] is right in the fuzzy line amen but
[48:01] there's a supposed to be a separation of
[48:04] light and darkness and what good god did
[48:07] in the beginning was he put a
[48:09] distinguishing line between himself and
[48:11] everything else anden that word divide
[48:14] there means to separate to make a
[48:16] distinction to exclude to set apart or
[48:20] to withdraw from something amen it
[48:22] struck me even at the end of last
[48:23] service how at the beginning God was
[48:25] putting in divine dividing lines between
[48:28] himself and everything else Amen in
[48:30] Genesis 1 God created light we know that
[48:32] was the pillar of fire for God to dwell
[48:34] in but God created something that
[48:37] distinguished him from everything that
[48:39] already was everything was Darkness
[48:42] everything was void everything was in
[48:43] chaos everything was out of order but
[48:45] when God created something it was the
[48:48] opposite of what was already there of
[48:51] the way that things were and the way
[48:53] that the systems were amen there was
[48:54] nothing welcoming or life sustaining in
[48:56] the universe at that time and so when
[48:58] God created a body for himself to
[49:01] dwelling it was the opposite of what was
[49:03] there because that's what was needed for
[49:05] change to happen if you leave things the
[49:08] way they are nothing's going to happen
[49:10] they say that's the definition of
[49:11] insanity is doing the thing you've
[49:13] always done and expecting something
[49:14] different to come out of it and so God
[49:17] created something that was completely
[49:18] different and he drew a distinction
[49:21] between himself between his attributes
[49:23] between his dwelling place and he did
[49:25] that by creating a light and that light
[49:27] was the opposite of the darkness that
[49:29] was there amen and God did it the
[49:32] scripture says as a way of separating
[49:34] who he is from everything else there is
[49:37] nothing like God he stands alone he's an
[49:39] absolute amen and the and I'm telling
[49:42] you this morning that when God did that
[49:44] that is the reason why you are where you
[49:46] are today this morning he drew a
[49:48] distinction between himself and
[49:51] everything else in that Pillar of Fire
[49:52] was every attribute every plan every
[49:55] word every person that would be a part
[49:57] of God every part of the family of God
[50:00] was in that light form and there was a
[50:03] separation there and that's why you can
[50:05] sit here this morning under the hearing
[50:06] and the preaching of the word and you
[50:08] can receive it and it can do a work in
[50:09] your life this morning only because you
[50:12] were part of that separation amen that
[50:14] was a word dwelling place for God and
[50:17] guess what we're a part of it amen
[50:19] because we're a word dwelling place for
[50:20] God today that light was given for
[50:23] purpose as we spoke of last service last
[50:25] Sunday and it was to use the atmosphere
[50:28] of the Holy Spirit to produce a way for
[50:31] life to be sustained the atmosphere of
[50:33] the Holy Spirit brought the word the
[50:36] creative word of God and what that did
[50:38] is that set the tone so that this Earth
[50:40] could come into a place of life amen and
[50:42] it was for our purpose it was for our
[50:45] good it was for our life it was for our
[50:47] benefit and it was supposed to be a
[50:49] wonderful place that we could share with
[50:50] God on a regular basis now we know that
[50:53] Humanity fell in the Garden of Eden and
[50:55] what happened after that is that
[50:57] Darkness started coming back in and how
[50:59] did it come in it came by way of what
[51:02] knowledge by Logic by reasoning and
[51:05] that's maybe a scary thing to say this
[51:07] morning because this world is trusting
[51:08] that logic and reason are going to get
[51:10] us out of where we are today but logic
[51:12] and reason are what got us into where we
[51:14] are today so we're in a spiral of
[51:16] Destruction and we keep thinking we can
[51:18] get ourselves out of it and the only
[51:20] thing that can get us out is the thing
[51:22] that would have kept us out in the
[51:23] beginning which was to go back to the
[51:25] word of God that's the only thing that
[51:27] will change the situation amen we have
[51:29] to come back to what God gave adam in
[51:31] the first place and what's that total
[51:34] separation amen don't do it stay away
[51:37] from it amen but if we look at the elect
[51:39] of God right up to the time that Christ
[51:41] came we would say that they were in
[51:43] religious light they did not have the
[51:45] full light amen but they were under a
[51:47] law and that law only had one outcome
[51:50] and that was death under the law if you
[51:53] if you if you broke a law then there was
[51:55] judgment and in the end after judgment
[51:57] always Came Death not always by the law
[51:59] but by sin so it made a way for us to
[52:02] have temporary access occasional access
[52:05] to God but we couldn't come into the
[52:06] full light remember in that shikina
[52:08] Glory inside the holy of holies only one
[52:11] man one time a year could come in but
[52:13] that man still died because he couldn't
[52:15] stay in that light but he could only go
[52:17] in once a year and so in the end the the
[52:19] law was only a provision for us to be
[52:22] able to access God but at the end of it
[52:24] there was always death people died and
[52:26] died and died died why because God said
[52:28] the day that you eat thereof is the day
[52:29] that you die and so sin had a hold on
[52:32] top of us amen we couldn't get out of it
[52:34] it had a headlock on us it had a choke
[52:35] hold and so at the end people kept dying
[52:38] they could not come into the fullness of
[52:40] what God had and so they were always
[52:41] looking over their shoulder wondering
[52:43] did I break one of the 613 Commandments
[52:46] of Moses law and if they did then they
[52:49] had to make a a reparation they had to
[52:51] make a sacrifice they had to get under
[52:52] the blood quickly because if they didn't
[52:54] if they didn't clean up if they didn't
[52:56] right now then the law would come into
[52:58] effect and guess what the law always won
[53:00] the law always won there was no getting
[53:02] out from under the law you know brother
[53:04] Mark has told this many times about that
[53:06] man that was gathering sticks to to to
[53:08] make a fire to to to make breakfast on a
[53:11] Sabbath morning and they came to Moses
[53:13] and they said you told him not to do it
[53:14] what do we do now we caught him doing it
[53:16] and Moses went in to check with God and
[53:17] God said kill him why cuz the law said
[53:20] you don't do any servile work on on a
[53:22] Sabbath and so he died under the law the
[53:26] law always wins you couldn't fight the
[53:28] law you couldn't beat the law so they
[53:30] weren't fully dark and they weren't
[53:32] fully light under the law it was a
[53:34] shadow Paul says it was a shadow it
[53:36] wasn't total darkness but it was partial
[53:38] light and partial darkness and if you've
[53:40] been in Shadow you know it's a place you
[53:42] don't want to stay because it has none
[53:44] of the benefits of darkness and it has
[53:46] none of the benefits of light you know
[53:48] if you're trying to sleep what do you
[53:50] want total darkness you can rest in
[53:53] darkness as long as you're not scared
[53:56] and if you're in light you can have
[53:57] warmth and comfort and you can grow and
[53:59] you can feel happy and all of these
[54:01] different things amen but when you step
[54:03] out of a shadow into the full light then
[54:05] something just changes doesn't it you
[54:08] know I I walked out this morning and
[54:09] it's cold but it's sunny and as long as
[54:12] that sun is there then you feel good
[54:15] I've been hunting in Alberta when it was
[54:17] -30 before the sun came up and I would
[54:20] get in early when it was dark and sit
[54:22] there in the woods for a while hunting
[54:24] for animals and you got to get there
[54:25] early so that you don't disturb them and
[54:27] any any noise you make by the time the
[54:30] sun comes up and you can see then
[54:32] they've always they've forgotten that
[54:34] you're there but as that sun would come
[54:35] up I remember distinctly it warmed up to
[54:38] minus 19 but as soon as that sun hit me
[54:41] I had to start taking off my clothes at
[54:45] minus1 19 why because the sun's on me
[54:48] and it
[54:49] changed what the
[54:51] situation in that in that cold minus
[54:54] 19 the cold I've ever had it in Newland
[54:57] isus 20 and and you just want to die why
[55:00] cuz there's no sun and there's wind but
[55:01] if it's calm and that sun's out it just
[55:04] changes the whole situation and I was
[55:05] literally sweating in my heavy clothes
[55:08] atus 19 so I started to take it off take
[55:10] it off by the end I just had on a shirt
[55:12] and a and a a fleece and that was it and
[55:15] snow pants Inus 19 why the sun changed
[55:18] everything like this morning it's cold
[55:21] but boy I'll take cold and sunny over
[55:23] warm and cloudy any day there's just
[55:25] something about being in the light that
[55:26] that changes but we see here at the
[55:28] beginning that God divided God created a
[55:31] separation between light and darkness it
[55:33] was a work of Distinction and we take it
[55:35] for granted today that light and dark
[55:37] don't work together but that is actually
[55:38] a design feature that God built in
[55:41] that's the way that God made light to be
[55:43] it's an attribute of God it's an
[55:44] attribute of light is that when light is
[55:46] there Darkness cannot be present at the
[55:48] same time now I'm just building up to
[55:50] our our service this morning just a
[55:52] quick refresh for those that weren't
[55:53] here or those that have forgotten
[55:55] perhaps remember remember we read this
[55:56] last service and it's speaking of Christ
[55:58] the word in the beginning says in him
[56:01] was life and the life was the light of
[56:03] man and the light shineth in darkness
[56:06] and the Darkness comprehended it not
[56:08] this is John taking us back to what we
[56:10] just read in Genesis 1:4 and it says the
[56:13] darkness comprehended not the light that
[56:16] word comprehend means it did not seize
[56:19] it did not overtake it could not grasp
[56:21] it could not capture it could not make
[56:24] it its own in other words when God
[56:26] created light there was a battle there
[56:28] there was a struggle between light and
[56:30] darkness because Darkness was what was
[56:33] and light was what is amen you have a
[56:36] past and you have a present and there's
[56:38] a difference now of opinion and darkness
[56:40] wanted to continue but God creates an
[56:43] attribute of himself to bring in and
[56:45] that light comes in and darkness can't
[56:47] control it Darkness has no power when
[56:50] light is there amen the light said you
[56:52] can't win you can't control you can't
[56:54] keep things the way they are now that
[56:56] I'm here you have to
[56:58] leave it was a total separation of what
[57:01] was now with what what is and that is
[57:03] God is in the building amen God is in
[57:05] the house amen that sounds so simple to
[57:07] us because when we walk into a dark room
[57:10] what do we automatically do we switch on
[57:11] a light and all the darkness
[57:13] disappears but that's something that God
[57:15] has built into light amen what was dark
[57:18] now becomes light with a simple flip of
[57:20] a switch amen and we think that's just
[57:22] the way would that it was but but God at
[57:25] the beginning there was a disagreement
[57:27] that was happening and it was a
[57:29] disagreement of what was reality cuz
[57:32] reality was chaos and darkness but God
[57:34] comes in and he says I'm about to change
[57:36] what reality is here and I'm going to do
[57:38] it by bringing light into the situation
[57:40] and when I do that then everything that
[57:42] you thought was real everything you
[57:44] thought was the way it had to be is now
[57:46] going to change purely on the basis that
[57:48] light is here that's the way that God
[57:50] was doing it why light destroys Darkness
[57:53] it destroys it it literally cannot exist
[57:56] where light is
[57:58] amen God set a law of Separation by way
[58:01] of light and we read this service this
[58:03] quote last service and I want to get us
[58:05] settled into our thought this morning he
[58:07] says now in the beginning this was our
[58:08] finishing quote he says in Genesis 1:3
[58:11] we find that there was Darkness upon the
[58:13] earth and the spirit of God moved upon
[58:15] the water and said let there be light
[58:17] and there was light and God saw that the
[58:19] light was good and God separated the
[58:22] light from the
[58:23] darkness then he says these words so the
[58:25] word of God began to separate the light
[58:29] from the darkness from the beginning
[58:31] that's a process of
[58:33] time it doesn't mean that he said it and
[58:36] it happened immediately but something
[58:37] happened and maybe it was just a little
[58:39] light to start but in that little spot
[58:42] it was still light and in that little
[58:45] spot was victory was change was life was
[58:48] light Hallelujah it only took a little
[58:51] spark for there to be a change but it
[58:53] started to grow Hallelujah and grow
[58:56] and grow and all of a sudden there's
[58:58] this great light
[59:00] there and all of a sudden the atmosphere
[59:03] completely
[59:05] changes but it started with just a
[59:07] little
[59:08] spark the word becoming
[59:11] reality and as God starts to step into
[59:14] it it grows and it grows and it grows
[59:18] and he says what does it do it separates
[59:21] light from Darkness from the beginning
[59:23] he says so does it remain until this day
[59:26] what light is trying to come in and
[59:29] Destroy Darkness trying to change what's
[59:31] going on in our lives amen it's a
[59:34] process of time notice the effect think
[59:37] of a seed that's buried in the earth
[59:39] they typically bury a seed 3 to 6 Ines
[59:41] under dirt and if you're 3 to 6 Ines
[59:43] under dirt I don't know if you've ever
[59:45] been there but it's dark there's no
[59:48] light 3 to 6 Ines under the dirt a seed
[59:51] that's under there cannot see the light
[59:54] but when light comes it does not see it
[59:57] but it can feel the effect of the light
[1:00:00] nonetheless you got your spiritual
[1:00:02] thinking caps on this morning amen that
[1:00:04] that seed it's under the atmosphere of
[1:00:07] the light and what does it do it brings
[1:00:09] warmth and warmth starts to change the
[1:00:11] soil around it starts to loosen it up
[1:00:14] and what happens is that seed that's in
[1:00:16] darkness starts to rot and it starts to
[1:00:19] break its shell under the atmosphere of
[1:00:21] the
[1:00:23] light
[1:00:24] amen it can't see the light but the
[1:00:28] light is still causing a separation from
[1:00:31] Darkness don't we see that in people all
[1:00:33] the time we have see we we see people
[1:00:36] that that are they haven't surrendered
[1:00:38] to Christ they haven't fully accepted
[1:00:39] the word of God but yet there's
[1:00:41] something that's drawing them upward to
[1:00:43] him and they don't even realize it's
[1:00:46] happening I I've got multiple people in
[1:00:48] my mind right now that don't realize
[1:00:50] that God is calling them and yet they're
[1:00:53] responding to the call of God because
[1:00:55] what there's light that's changing the
[1:00:57] things around them and it's changing
[1:00:59] their situation and there's a
[1:01:00] lifechanging experience that's going on
[1:01:02] and they don't realize what's going
[1:01:04] on but what happens it's pulling them
[1:01:07] it's drawing them to the word it's
[1:01:08] drawing them to a church it's drawing
[1:01:10] them to Fellowship it's drawing them
[1:01:12] away from the things of the world it's a
[1:01:14] process and it's going on even if it's
[1:01:16] not done they don't even realize they're
[1:01:19] coming into the light but there's one
[1:01:20] Glorious Day Hallelujah where that thing
[1:01:23] that's been sprouting and sprouting and
[1:01:25] sprouting and as it gets close maybe
[1:01:27] it's not quite through to the surface
[1:01:29] but there's a little crack in the dirt
[1:01:30] and it sees something it's never seen
[1:01:33] before and then what happens is that
[1:01:35] makes it work all the harder to keep
[1:01:37] coming up and one glorious morning what
[1:01:39] happens it breaks through and it's in
[1:01:41] full sunlight and then it really starts
[1:01:43] to grow and it realizes there's more to
[1:01:45] this life than darkness and rotting and
[1:01:47] seeds and and
[1:01:50] cold that's what's happening when light
[1:01:52] causes total separation from Darkness
[1:01:55] amen
[1:01:56] I thought that it was so good what
[1:01:57] brother Mark said that about a clean
[1:01:59] heart and a clean mind being required
[1:02:01] for perfect Faith it's causing you to
[1:02:04] come out from all of those things that
[1:02:05] are holding you down amen that's what
[1:02:08] the light's supposed to do it's supposed
[1:02:09] to create a total separation from
[1:02:12] unbelief amen how by disconnecting us
[1:02:15] from the darkness and bringing us into
[1:02:17] the light you know you look at that
[1:02:18] first church age you look at when Christ
[1:02:20] was there and then and then that first
[1:02:22] portion of that first Ephesian Church
[1:02:24] age with the disciples and Paul and they
[1:02:27] were a perfect Church led by the Holy
[1:02:29] Spirit they were a perfect Church in
[1:02:31] Perfect Light doing the perfect works of
[1:02:33] Jesus Christ and then they fell from
[1:02:35] there remember what Revelation 2 says
[1:02:37] they fell from their first love they
[1:02:40] fell from their leadership of the Holy
[1:02:42] Spirit and what did they do they went
[1:02:43] back to the Lo the tree of knowledge of
[1:02:45] Good and Evil they went back to the
[1:02:47] logic and the reason of the leadership
[1:02:49] of men and they fell away from that amen
[1:02:52] and what happened is they went into more
[1:02:54] and more Darkness into each Church age
[1:02:56] and it looked like the darkest was in
[1:02:57] the Dark Ages
[1:03:00] socalled Catholic Church is controlling
[1:03:03] everything Antichrist if there ever was
[1:03:06] one bound people in dogmas and religions
[1:03:09] and worship of saints and worship of
[1:03:11] Mary and and purgatory and all these
[1:03:14] different things people are buying their
[1:03:16] ability to sin God forbid God forbid in
[1:03:21] the darkest of times but then what
[1:03:23] happened is God sent light just a crack
[1:03:26] through Martin Luther and what did he do
[1:03:28] he said the just shall live by faith and
[1:03:31] it was just a little bit of life but it
[1:03:32] started back that growth of that tree
[1:03:34] that had been cut down and then it comes
[1:03:36] along John Wesley and he says you can
[1:03:38] live a Sanctified life you can be
[1:03:41] cleaned up you can do things in your
[1:03:43] life that that are pleasing to God and
[1:03:44] you can set yourself aside from those
[1:03:46] other things and then he came through
[1:03:48] Pentecost a little more light and there
[1:03:49] was gifts that were in the church but
[1:03:51] then there came a full word again and
[1:03:54] what does it do it shows a bride that
[1:03:56] there's a higher plane that it's not
[1:03:58] just gifts and it's not just having fun
[1:04:01] but there is a higher plane where you
[1:04:02] can live in total separation from
[1:04:05] unbelief
[1:04:07] amen but yet in that Perfect final age
[1:04:12] it's the darkest of them all in leoda
[1:04:15] Christ is outside he's outside and he's
[1:04:18] knocking on the door trying to get in
[1:04:20] the churches have put them out they are
[1:04:22] literally today worshiping Satan
[1:04:24] thinking they're worshiping God because
[1:04:26] they have created a god of their own
[1:04:28] mind and that is not
[1:04:31] Christ that is not Christ I saw a female
[1:04:33] preacher talking again about this story
[1:04:35] of Jesus and the saraph phenician woman
[1:04:38] she said he called him a dog and she
[1:04:39] says that's not the kind of Jesus I pray
[1:04:42] to you know what it is she doesn't
[1:04:45] understand her word and so she has
[1:04:47] created a god of her own making and in
[1:04:50] doing so she put God completely out of
[1:04:51] her life you can't do it you can't do it
[1:04:56] amen we're in the darkest of Ages that's
[1:04:59] ever been today everyone said praise the
[1:05:03] Lord no no it's horrible isn't it it's
[1:05:07] horrible it's the darkest it's the most
[1:05:08] perverted I don't mean to sound down but
[1:05:10] that's what the word of God tells us it
[1:05:12] was the worst of Ages it is the worst of
[1:05:15] Ages amen but yet we have a hope and
[1:05:18] that's that in the this time there's a
[1:05:20] light that's coming that's our hope is
[1:05:22] that there is light in the time of
[1:05:24] Darkness amen remember we've we've read
[1:05:27] this many times before Isaiah 60 says
[1:05:29] arise Shine for thy light is come and
[1:05:31] the glory of the Lord is risen upon the
[1:05:35] it's and behold the darkness shall cover
[1:05:37] the Earth and gross Darkness the people
[1:05:40] but the Lord shall arise upon thee and
[1:05:42] His glory shall be seen upon thee and
[1:05:45] the Gentiles shall come to thy light
[1:05:48] amen and Kings to the brightness of thy
[1:05:51] Rising gross Darkness are we in Gross
[1:05:53] Darkness this morning like I said before
[1:05:56] gross means it's heavy there's a lot of
[1:05:58] it but I also like gross meaning
[1:06:00] disgusting Darkness that's where we're
[1:06:02] at today tell me this quote isn't the
[1:06:04] truth if it isn't exactly the truth he
[1:06:06] says man wants to look like woman women
[1:06:09] wants to look like the man it goes to
[1:06:11] show there's a perversion a dark Spirit
[1:06:13] hanging over a gross Darkness over the
[1:06:16] people and he says it's the hour of the
[1:06:18] calling out there's a Darkness over
[1:06:21] Egypt before the calling out then the
[1:06:23] token was applied it's time for the
[1:06:25] church to get the token or gross
[1:06:28] darkness is upon the people see you only
[1:06:29] have one or the other there is no middle
[1:06:32] ground it's the token of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:35] or it's gross Darkness he says yes it he
[1:06:38] says clean out the cupboard clean out
[1:06:40] this house oh we have a good
[1:06:41] oldfashioned house cleaning let the
[1:06:43] blood be applied and then the token will
[1:06:45] come in he says clean it out sanctify it
[1:06:48] amen there's a s there's a separation
[1:06:50] that's coming and remember in in Egypt
[1:06:52] and Goan there was a separation in the
[1:06:54] time of Darkness
[1:06:56] that when when that that the the the
[1:06:58] land of Egypt went into darkness for 3
[1:07:00] Days Goan was still in light but that
[1:07:03] was only a type of the real shadow that
[1:07:05] was coming and that was death and life
[1:07:08] and it was only the token that was going
[1:07:09] to keep them safe amen but there's that
[1:07:11] separation going on here now and it's a
[1:07:13] separation of light and darkness and
[1:07:15] it's a promise of time it's a a process
[1:07:17] of time and that's so often the struggle
[1:07:21] with the our Christian walk is that
[1:07:22] there's time
[1:07:23] involved today everything is immediate
[1:07:27] you know I've got the fastest internet
[1:07:29] that Bell can give me and somehow I
[1:07:32] still don't think it's fast
[1:07:34] enough it takes one and a half seconds
[1:07:36] to load a web page and I'm thinking how
[1:07:39] in the world can this take that long to
[1:07:41] do why because I've become accustomed to
[1:07:43] the speed in the old days of dialup it
[1:07:45] would take you a minute to load a page
[1:07:48] and then we got cable modem and it took
[1:07:50] 20 seconds and we were like wow this is
[1:07:52] amazing and now it takes one and a half
[1:07:54] seconds and we think why is is taking so
[1:07:56] long there's a process of time that's
[1:07:58] going on Amen but what is it it's trying
[1:08:01] to let the Holy Spirit clean the house
[1:08:03] out let the token be applied so that he
[1:08:07] can have free reign in our lives amen
[1:08:08] you got something you can't kick this
[1:08:10] morning apply the
[1:08:12] token clean the house clean the house
[1:08:16] you got friends you can't let go apply
[1:08:19] the
[1:08:19] token you got something that's that's
[1:08:22] that's got its claws into you this
[1:08:23] morning apply the token
[1:08:26] amen so much of this is based on Choice
[1:08:28] it's not based on something that's been
[1:08:30] put on us somehow amen but in this in
[1:08:33] this this this last stage what does that
[1:08:35] light come to do show us who we are
[1:08:38] that's the final Revelation for the
[1:08:40] bride is when she knows who she is the
[1:08:41] rapture will
[1:08:42] go not who she thinks she is who she is
[1:08:46] the reality of who she is amen not who
[1:08:49] we were born as to our mother and our
[1:08:50] father but who we were before the
[1:08:52] foundation of the world our true
[1:08:54] position in Christ amen the light is the
[1:08:56] word and the power is the holy is is the
[1:08:58] holy spirit that's quickening us to it
[1:09:01] in this last time in this worst of Ages
[1:09:03] when everything's muddled when
[1:09:04] everything mixed up when there's no
[1:09:06] absolute when when there's nothing
[1:09:07] that's right or wrong when everything is
[1:09:10] Gray we've got a scripture that's
[1:09:12] especially for
[1:09:14] us says it but it shall be one day which
[1:09:17] shall be known to the Lord not day nor
[1:09:20] night but it shall come to pass that at
[1:09:22] evening time it shall be light you know
[1:09:25] we call ourselves evening Light
[1:09:26] Fellowship
[1:09:28] here why because that's the season we're
[1:09:30] in we're in the time of the evening
[1:09:32] light and you don't get into this you
[1:09:34] don't get into this body by attending
[1:09:35] this church you don't get into this body
[1:09:38] by believing a particular Doctrine you
[1:09:40] don't get into this body by any way but
[1:09:43] only because you're a part of the word
[1:09:45] of God that's the only way you can be
[1:09:47] part of this Fellowship is that you're a
[1:09:49] part of the word how do you become a
[1:09:50] part of the word by one Spirit we're
[1:09:52] baptized into one body the only way you
[1:09:54] can be a part of that church not this
[1:09:56] church that church of the evening Light
[1:09:59] Fellowship is to be baptized into the
[1:10:01] body by the Holy Spirit that's the only
[1:10:02] way to do it
[1:10:04] amen this is the calling out time this
[1:10:07] is the separating time this is the
[1:10:10] sanctifying time this is the rapturing
[1:10:12] time this is the resurrecting time
[1:10:14] there's a distinction that's being drawn
[1:10:16] between the bride and everybody
[1:10:20] else Paul said in Ephesians but all
[1:10:22] things that are reproved are made
[1:10:24] manifest by the the light for whatsoever
[1:10:26] does make manifest is light what's the
[1:10:29] Holy Spirit doing calling us into light
[1:10:31] that's what he's doing if we walk in the
[1:10:33] light as he is in the light then then we
[1:10:35] have Fellowship one with another and the
[1:10:36] blood of Jesus cleanses us from all our
[1:10:38] sins he's calling us to walk into the
[1:10:40] light calling us to our origin calling
[1:10:42] us back to the full word calling us back
[1:10:45] to a place where we can live and breathe
[1:10:46] as we were meant to amen calling us back
[1:10:48] to a place where God has the full
[1:10:50] preeminence in our
[1:10:53] lives Paul would say it this way he says
[1:10:55] for ye were sometimes
[1:10:59] Darkness but now remember in the
[1:11:02] beginning was Darkness but then the
[1:11:04] light
[1:11:06] came he says but now are ye light in the
[1:11:09] Lord walk as children of light it says
[1:11:12] there we were sometimes darkness that
[1:11:13] means it was a temporary condition it
[1:11:16] was
[1:11:17] circumstances that's not our inheritance
[1:11:19] it's not who we are but it's what's all
[1:11:21] around us it's our environment is
[1:11:23] Darkness amen but he says now you are
[1:11:25] light in the Lord amen in circumstances
[1:11:28] there was Darkness amen we weren't that
[1:11:30] eternally but we were born Into Darkness
[1:11:33] okay you got to be very careful this
[1:11:34] morning that you don't think that
[1:11:36] because I am that's who I am no that's
[1:11:39] the conditions that's the circumstances
[1:11:40] that are around you that's why the light
[1:11:42] comes is to pull you out of those things
[1:11:44] so you can see that's not who I am
[1:11:46] that's not who I was meant to be the
[1:11:48] things we deal with church this morning
[1:11:50] are just circumstances and conditions
[1:11:53] that's it it's not your inheritance
[1:11:56] it's not the promise of God it's not
[1:11:58] your true nature it's not what you were
[1:12:00] born into it's just the environment
[1:12:03] that's around us amen these things are
[1:12:05] not Eternal they're not Eternal they're
[1:12:07] temporal they're meant to go away amen
[1:12:10] listen to what Jesus said CU we're
[1:12:12] talking about the Holy Spirit revealing
[1:12:13] who we are look at the woman at the well
[1:12:15] if you want to talk about somebody who
[1:12:17] is sometimes Darkness you talk about a
[1:12:19] woman that was sometimes Darkness it was
[1:12:21] that woman at the well listen to this
[1:12:23] leam says watch that woman
[1:12:25] they says watch these Pharisees and
[1:12:27] trained up and UPS you see they said
[1:12:29] that man is a beb he's a devil look when
[1:12:32] that light flashed across that little
[1:12:34] predestinated seed there when it struck
[1:12:36] the real seed of God that was before the
[1:12:39] foundation of the world the name was put
[1:12:42] on the Lamb's Book of Life he says when
[1:12:44] it struck it he says then quickly she
[1:12:47] recognized that in her condition she
[1:12:52] recognized it see we would say that's
[1:12:54] who she is she's a prostitute she's a
[1:12:58] woman that's had five marriages all of
[1:13:01] them failed she's living common
[1:13:04] law she's been disappointed she's been
[1:13:07] broken she's been hurt she's been abused
[1:13:10] she keeps making the wrong decision
[1:13:12] after the wrong decision she's
[1:13:14] frustrated she's tired she's worn
[1:13:17] out but that's not her that's just her
[1:13:21] condition but it says when that word
[1:13:24] struck her in her condition she still
[1:13:27] recognized it he says brother I say that
[1:13:30] woman knew more about God right then
[1:13:32] than half the people in the United
[1:13:34] States right why she was ordained before
[1:13:38] the foundation of the world what is it
[1:13:41] when light comes something
[1:13:43] happens when light comes we start to see
[1:13:47] not just who he is but we start to see
[1:13:49] who we are and when it comes all the
[1:13:51] excuses go away she didn't walk away
[1:13:54] listen under that oh under that presence
[1:13:58] under that anointing that was there the
[1:14:00] Messiah son going forth sign going forth
[1:14:02] showing her who she was showing what was
[1:14:04] going on in her life showing her her
[1:14:07] failures did she shrink did she back
[1:14:11] away no the more he spoke the closer she
[1:14:14] got the more I pointed out her flaws and
[1:14:17] her fails she said tell me more tell me
[1:14:20] more oh I know who this is I know who
[1:14:23] this is tell me any more come
[1:14:27] on oh it didn't back away she didn't
[1:14:30] back away she said go tell me some more
[1:14:33] cuz I know when the word comes he'll
[1:14:35] tell me and when he comes he'll tell me
[1:14:38] and he'll tell me and he won't putp me
[1:14:39] down but he'll lift me up into Heavenly
[1:14:42] places oh church that's what the word is
[1:14:45] trying to do this morning that's what
[1:14:47] the holy spirit's trying to do not
[1:14:48] trying to get us to back away in shame
[1:14:51] or embarrassment but to come in and say
[1:14:53] that's me that's me and the word is here
[1:14:56] the spirit of God is here to discern the
[1:14:58] needs of my heart that's what he's
[1:15:00] trying to do he's not trying to put us
[1:15:02] down he's trying to get us out of the
[1:15:03] dirt he's trying to get us out of the
[1:15:05] muck he's trying to get us out of the
[1:15:07] filth that holds us back he's trying to
[1:15:09] get us out of the shame trying to get us
[1:15:11] out of the
[1:15:12] embarrassment nobody knows this nobody
[1:15:16] deals with this let me tell you there's
[1:15:17] more people dealing with it this morning
[1:15:19] than you
[1:15:20] think why cuz Satan's a good
[1:15:23] enemy but the word is here by the spirit
[1:15:26] to what let you see who you are let you
[1:15:30] see who you are
[1:15:34] amen we're supposed to walk as children
[1:15:36] of light supposed to be a clear
[1:15:40] distinction dabbling in the world isn't
[1:15:42] holy
[1:15:44] church dabbling in the world is not holy
[1:15:47] that's
[1:15:48] compromise and with compromise always
[1:15:50] comes a price to pay amen it's
[1:15:52] backsliding and it hurts us more than we
[1:15:54] think
[1:15:56] I'm telling you this morning you can
[1:15:58] trace everything you're struggling with
[1:16:00] to a choice you
[1:16:02] made you may not have a TV but you have
[1:16:04] a phone or you have a
[1:16:05] computer amen you may not watch movies
[1:16:08] but you watch YouTube and listen if you
[1:16:10] don't have an ad blocker you're going to
[1:16:12] see the same things that you're going to
[1:16:13] see on TV and let me tell you this by
[1:16:16] personal experience you can watch
[1:16:17] something that you think is the cleanest
[1:16:19] of the clean and it'll still get you
[1:16:22] because they always drop something in
[1:16:23] there they always do why because they're
[1:16:26] in darkness they can't do otherwise
[1:16:28] darkness is coming through whether you
[1:16:30] want to or not and so how you manage
[1:16:32] that is going to determine what you're
[1:16:34] going to struggle with throughout the
[1:16:35] next days and weeks I speak by personal
[1:16:37] experience you think it's so simple and
[1:16:40] Har and it what is it doing it's just
[1:16:42] filtering in a little bit instead of a
[1:16:44] lot listen you can poison yourself
[1:16:47] slowly but poisons poison no matter
[1:16:51] what you may not intend to hear things
[1:16:54] you may go in with the best of
[1:16:55] intentions
[1:16:57] church but guess what it's coming from a
[1:17:00] polluted
[1:17:02] stream you've got to be so careful
[1:17:05] preaching to myself you got to be so
[1:17:09] careful
[1:17:10] amen you may not read certain books but
[1:17:13] you'll listen to podcast you may not go
[1:17:15] certain places but you'll talk to people
[1:17:17] that do listen Satan's going to try and
[1:17:20] get into our lives one way or the other
[1:17:22] and we've got to be so careful to draw a
[1:17:24] line of separation amen because this
[1:17:26] flesh is sticky it has a sticky nature
[1:17:28] and anything that gives it Comfort
[1:17:30] anything that gives it ease of Life
[1:17:32] anything that gives it entertainment
[1:17:33] anything that gives it satisfaction
[1:17:35] it'll say give me more and more and more
[1:17:37] of
[1:17:40] that James said it this way he says let
[1:17:42] no man say when he's tempted I'm tempted
[1:17:44] of God for God cannot be tempted with
[1:17:47] evil neither tempteth he any man but
[1:17:49] every man is tempted when he has drawn
[1:17:51] away of his own lust and enticed and
[1:17:56] when lust has conceived when lust
[1:17:58] produces its intentions it bringeth
[1:18:00] forth sin and sin when it is finished
[1:18:02] bringeth forth death lust starts up
[1:18:06] here and what's the gateway to the mind
[1:18:09] it's the eyes and the ears and the mouth
[1:18:11] it's the senses it's the five senses
[1:18:13] amen but it doesn't have to be sensual
[1:18:15] lust doesn't have to be sensual lust is
[1:18:18] is Desiring anything carnal so listen it
[1:18:21] can be Financial it can be educational
[1:18:24] it can be job oriented it can be
[1:18:26] intellectual emotional edible digital
[1:18:29] electronic
[1:18:31] anything it can be a lust amen
[1:18:37] vehicular I I talked to to to the boys

[1:19:31] in your life and that'll tell you if
[1:19:32] it's right or wrong for you

[1:19:38] Nelson guy at the at the cabin he told
[1:19:41] me he's broken three phones I think in

[1:19:44] tired of them wants nothing to do with
[1:19:47] them most of us would cry if our phones
[1:19:50] were broken he willingly breaks them
[1:19:52] because he hates them he hates them

[1:20:26] and loses his
[1:20:27] soul you want to limp into
[1:20:30] heaven you want to go in in the power of
[1:20:32] the Holy Ghost amen how do you overcome
[1:20:33] walk away that's how you overcome you
[1:20:36] walk away take it out of your life amen
[1:20:40] but yet we have a great hope amen we
[1:20:43] have a great hope and it's that light
[1:20:45] has to be separated from darkness and
[1:20:46] God is doing that work amen and you and
[1:20:49] I were with him in the beginning and
[1:20:50] we've already been declared which side
[1:20:52] we're
[1:20:53] on and because were're in him we're on
[1:20:55] the side of light and light always
[1:20:57] wins light's going to win one way or the
[1:21:00] other we read this before Paul says ye
[1:21:03] are all the children of light and the
[1:21:05] children of the day we are not of the
[1:21:07] light nor of Darkness that's not
[1:21:09] determined today that was determined in
[1:21:11] Genesis
[1:21:12] 1 you always were a child of light but
[1:21:15] you were born in circumstances of
[1:21:16] Darkness but there's a holy spirit
[1:21:18] moving now by the word that's going to
[1:21:20] let us see who and what we are amen
[1:21:23] remember what we read in John 1 5 it
[1:21:25] said that Darkness could not comprehend
[1:21:27] the light it could not seize it it could
[1:21:30] not control it it could not hold it it
[1:21:32] could not understand it it could not
[1:21:34] overcome it it could not make it its own
[1:21:37] I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:21:38] whatever is holding you can't hold you
[1:21:42] why because you're a Child of
[1:21:45] Light Darkness can't overcome a Child of
[1:21:48] Light oh I'm not saying there's not
[1:21:50] battles I'm not saying there's not
[1:21:52] struggles I'm not saying it's not a
[1:21:54] process of time but I'm saying the
[1:21:56] dividing line has already been drawn and
[1:21:58] you've already been put on the side that
[1:21:59] has light that means light has to win it
[1:22:02] means you've got to break through amen
[1:22:04] you might be in a battle this morning I
[1:22:05] know nothing about you may have had the
[1:22:07] darkest two weeks of your
[1:22:09] life this last of it doesn't matter you
[1:22:13] may think nobody's dealing with the
[1:22:15] things you're dealing with you may be
[1:22:16] frustrated because it's so simple and
[1:22:18] nobody else is struggling with it let me
[1:22:20] tell you there's a lot more people
[1:22:21] struggling with things today than
[1:22:22] they'll tell you amen as a preacher I
[1:22:26] know
[1:22:27] it You' be amazed the things that people
[1:22:29] come up for prayer
[1:22:31] for mature
[1:22:33] Christians amen we're all in a battle no
[1:22:36] great ones amongst us amen no great ones
[1:22:40] amongst
[1:22:41] us amen I don't care where you are this
[1:22:43] morning if you're a Child of Light
[1:22:46] there's Victory on the way cuz light
[1:22:48] destroys Darkness amen
[1:22:55] Look what Jesus said he says Jesus
[1:22:57] answered them verily verily I say unto
[1:22:59] you whosoever commit a sin is the
[1:23:02] servant of sin that real word there is
[1:23:04] slave whoever commits sin is the slave
[1:23:07] of sin and that servant that slave
[1:23:10] abideth not in the house forever but the
[1:23:12] son abideth forever the Amplified says
[1:23:14] there a slave isn't a permanent member
[1:23:17] of the household but a son is he says
[1:23:20] now if the son therefore shall make you
[1:23:23] free ye shall be free indeed you shall
[1:23:25] be free for real you'll truly you'll
[1:23:28] actually be free I want you to notice
[1:23:31] the language there Jesus is saying if
[1:23:32] you commit sin you're the slave of sin
[1:23:35] now what is sin see this world would say
[1:23:38] well not this world the religious world
[1:23:39] would say that sin is smoking drinking
[1:23:42] fornicating partying rock and roll music
[1:23:44] that's not sin sin is to disbelieve the
[1:23:47] word of
[1:23:48] God and then what happens is when you
[1:23:50] disbelieve the word of God what it is is
[1:23:53] you believe something else over the word
[1:23:54] word of God and that allows you to do
[1:23:56] what the word of God says you shouldn't
[1:23:58] do see we're talking about the
[1:24:00] attributes of sin we need to go back to
[1:24:02] the source which is we disbelieve the
[1:24:03] word of God if only for a moment amen so
[1:24:06] if you believe something else above the
[1:24:08] word then Paul says or Jesus says you're
[1:24:10] a
[1:24:11] slave Amen to stay where you are makes
[1:24:14] you a slave but then he says if you are
[1:24:17] a slave if you don't believe the word of
[1:24:19] God you can't stay in the house with the
[1:24:21] father that's not a place for done
[1:24:23] Believers that's a place for believers
[1:24:26] amen he says what happens is you come in
[1:24:28] and you come out that's what slaves do
[1:24:30] don't they they come in and they go out
[1:24:32] they come in and they go out they don't
[1:24:33] get to stay there but they have moments
[1:24:36] of respit they have moments of
[1:24:37] protection see a slave has temporary
[1:24:41] benefits of the Master's house but in
[1:24:44] the end he still has to go out every
[1:24:46] night but then he says if the sun will
[1:24:49] make you free if the sun will make you
[1:24:52] believe then when you believe you'll
[1:24:54] start to realize you're not a slave
[1:24:56] you're a son you're a child of God
[1:24:59] you're a daughter of God and it'll
[1:25:01] change something about you amen you'll
[1:25:03] notice here that our our intended
[1:25:05] position is not as a slave our intended
[1:25:08] position is as a child of
[1:25:10] God but he says you what you were
[1:25:12] sometimes
[1:25:14] Darkness you thought you were a
[1:25:16] slave but now I'm here to tell you
[1:25:18] you're a son you're a daughter of
[1:25:21] God what's he trying to do get us out of
[1:25:23] that slave slave
[1:25:25] mentality I can't help it I can't change
[1:25:28] it I can't beat it I can't do
[1:25:32] it I can't win I only lose I only go so
[1:25:35] far I never go far enough that's a slave
[1:25:39] mentality he said no no I got to get you
[1:25:41] all the way in total separation from
[1:25:45] unbelief amen we think we have to come
[1:25:47] to God as God is we think we have to
[1:25:51] come in perfect we think we have to come
[1:25:54] in with our dress right with our music
[1:25:56] right with our looks right with our
[1:25:58] house right with our family right with
[1:26:00] our marriage right with our job no no no
[1:26:03] that's not the way we come to God that's
[1:26:05] the way we
[1:26:06] leave he does a work but you can't come
[1:26:09] in if you're
[1:26:10] perfect healthy people don't need
[1:26:13] doctors that's what Jesus
[1:26:16] said he said I came for the sick I came
[1:26:19] for the needy I came for those that are
[1:26:21] struggling with life
[1:26:24] so we don't have to be like God in order
[1:26:25] to come to God Paul would talk to the
[1:26:27] Corinthians he says know ye not that the
[1:26:29] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:26:31] kingdom of God be not deceived listen to
[1:26:34] the list of of things here neither
[1:26:36] fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers
[1:26:39] nor emed nor abusers of themselves with
[1:26:41] mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor
[1:26:44] drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners
[1:26:46] shall inherit the kingdom of
[1:26:48] God what a horrible list what a horrible
[1:26:51] bunch of people they had better not ever
[1:26:53] come into our church I'll tell you
[1:26:54] if I ever get one of those in our church
[1:26:56] we're going to have the deacons boot
[1:26:57] them
[1:26:58] out no you notice that half of these are
[1:27:02] learned
[1:27:05] behaviors you don't become a party
[1:27:08] animal just because you become a party
[1:27:11] animal because your parents are party
[1:27:14] animals you don't have common law
[1:27:16] relationships just because you do it
[1:27:18] because people teach you how to do it
[1:27:20] they teach you it's okay all of these
[1:27:22] things not all of them but a lot of them
[1:27:24] covetousness drunkards I'm not a
[1:27:27] drunkard why I was never taught to be a
[1:27:29] drunkard but I guarantee you if I lived
[1:27:31] in a house of drunkards I'd have
[1:27:33] probably been a drunkard learn
[1:27:35] Behavior amen but so many of these
[1:27:37] things come from our family heritage
[1:27:39] they come from the way that we're raised
[1:27:41] our genetics even and their their
[1:27:43] damages caused by people leading us
[1:27:45] astray by poor
[1:27:46] example you say none of those ought to
[1:27:48] be in the church and then Paul says and
[1:27:49] such were some of
[1:27:52] you so that means we got to welcome them
[1:27:55] into the church that's the ones that
[1:27:57] need to come into the
[1:27:58] church cuz ye were sometimes
[1:28:02] Darkness Hallelujah ye were sometimes
[1:28:05] Darkness but ye are what washed now
[1:28:09] you're children of light ye are
[1:28:10] Sanctified you are justified in the name
[1:28:13] of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of
[1:28:16] our God what's the spirit trying to do
[1:28:19] show you what you are not what you think
[1:28:22] you are
[1:28:25] it's trying to get you out of the idea
[1:28:26] of just because I am this way I always
[1:28:28] will be this
[1:28:31] way they were full-blown
[1:28:35] Sinners they were the worst of the
[1:28:39] worst every possible way filthy vile
[1:28:42] ungodly perverted but they were children
[1:28:44] of God nonetheless
[1:28:47] Hallelujah let me tell you your little
[1:28:49] problem this morning compare to
[1:28:51] that you might be one of those things
[1:28:55] there may have been people that were all
[1:28:56] of those
[1:28:58] things he says but ye are washed they
[1:29:01] were children of God Amen how many times
[1:29:04] did Paul have to rebuke the
[1:29:06] Believers Paul constantly rebuked why
[1:29:09] because we need to be changed and if we
[1:29:12] need to be changed that means we're not
[1:29:14] what we're supposed to be the idea that
[1:29:17] you might have to repent of something is
[1:29:19] a good sign because it means you're
[1:29:21] being changed if we're never changing
[1:29:24] that means we're stuck and if we're
[1:29:26] stuck that means we're backsliding we
[1:29:29] need to be changing constantly amen
[1:29:32] change means we aren't where we ought to
[1:29:33] be just yet amen and that means we have
[1:29:36] to have some real honesty about what
[1:29:37] we're doing in our lives and where we're
[1:29:41] at some of these people didn't know
[1:29:43] better until Paul came along and
[1:29:45] preached to them but once they knew
[1:29:47] better then they were held accountable
[1:29:49] but what was it when that light crossed
[1:29:51] their path that seed in their heart
[1:29:53] sprung to life and they realized I'm a
[1:29:56] Child of God but yet Paul would come to
[1:29:58] others and he'd say listen you've been
[1:30:01] taught better and you're still doing
[1:30:03] it he says and now the holy spirit's
[1:30:05] calling you out knock it off or I'm
[1:30:08] going to come over
[1:30:09] there Paul didn't pull any punches he
[1:30:12] says you've been top better than your
[1:30:14] living get your act
[1:30:17] together start acting like the people of
[1:30:19] God you really
[1:30:21] are Jesus said a servant a Slave is
[1:30:24] bound by sin not allowed to stay in the
[1:30:26] father's house all the time he says let
[1:30:28] God set you free truly free and you can
[1:30:31] live as a Sons meant to live Paul would
[1:30:34] say in Galatians he says but when the
[1:30:35] fullness of the time was
[1:30:38] come God sent forth his son made of a
[1:30:41] woman made under the law to redeem that
[1:30:43] were under the law that we might receive
[1:30:45] the adoption of
[1:30:47] sons verse six is one of my favorite
[1:30:49] scriptures in the whole Bible and
[1:30:52] because ye are Sons God has sent forth
[1:30:56] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:30:59] crying Abba Father wherefore thou are no
[1:31:02] more a servant but a son see Jesus said
[1:31:06] if the son will set you free you'll be
[1:31:07] free indeed how's he going to do it
[1:31:10] signs and
[1:31:11] wonders great ministry no he says
[1:31:15] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[1:31:17] a son why because the spirit of God is
[1:31:19] in your
[1:31:19] heart that's the only thing that'll
[1:31:21] change a person he says this and if a
[1:31:25] son then an heir of God through Christ
[1:31:28] every promise in the book belongs to
[1:31:30] you the Holy Spirit didn't come to you
[1:31:33] because you made a choice the Holy
[1:31:35] Spirit came to you because he made a
[1:31:37] choice way back when light was separated
[1:31:41] from darkness and he put your name in
[1:31:42] the Lamb's Book of Life on the side of
[1:31:44] light and said nothing's going to stop
[1:31:46] it Darkness isn't going to hold it back
[1:31:49] life is going to come forth where only
[1:31:50] death and Chaos were before that's the
[1:31:52] reason it comes because you are a child
[1:31:55] of God because you are sons of God
[1:31:57] because you are Daughters of
[1:31:59] God not because I did right not because
[1:32:03] I was born in a certain family not
[1:32:04] because I had a certain Minister growing
[1:32:06] up because you are a son or daughter of
[1:32:09] God that's why the Holy Spirit came to
[1:32:11] you amen for what purpose verse 7 to
[1:32:15] show you you're not a slave you're a
[1:32:18] son that's the reason it comes it's
[1:32:20] trying to elevate your thinking it's
[1:32:22] trying to get you into your position
[1:32:25] amen you're not a servant anymore you
[1:32:28] don't have to live in darkness you don't
[1:32:30] have to come in and out of the word of
[1:32:32] God you know brother Brown talk what was
[1:32:35] it that that message the inner Veil and
[1:32:37] then he talks about why are people so
[1:32:38] tossed about they're in they're out
[1:32:40] they're up they're down they're up or
[1:32:41] down listen a yo-yo is not the life of a
[1:32:44] true
[1:32:45] Christian it's steady oh we still have
[1:32:47] our bumps absolutely amen we have our
[1:32:51] bumps but we're not in and then we're
[1:32:53] not not out we're not saved one day and
[1:32:55] lost the next we're not sure one day and
[1:32:57] then we're unsure the next amen there's
[1:32:59] an anchor in the veil why there's an
[1:33:01] anchor of the Soul by the holy spirit
[1:33:03] that says I am a child of God that's the
[1:33:06] anchor that I have this morning
[1:33:10] amen that's what God's trying to get us
[1:33:13] to that servant could only temporarily
[1:33:15] get some of those benefits listen you
[1:33:17] can be a religious person and you can
[1:33:19] get some of the
[1:33:20] benefits you can have provision at times
[1:33:23] you can have health at times you can
[1:33:24] have Grace at times but at the end of
[1:33:26] the day you're going to go back out
[1:33:27] because of your unbelief and you lose
[1:33:29] those benefits see where's the servant's
[1:33:31] rest it's in his
[1:33:33] Works where's the son's rest in his
[1:33:36] position it's in his
[1:33:39] position he's saying you're the
[1:33:41] servant's going in and out in and out
[1:33:42] he's working working working the son
[1:33:44] just stays there why because of who he
[1:33:46] is that's all that's going on there amen
[1:33:49] why there's a dividing line that's been
[1:33:50] drawn and slaves are in darkness sons
[1:33:53] are in light
[1:33:54] amen they're in the presence of God
[1:33:56] being fed daily if they'll take
[1:33:59] it the only reason that son leaves is if
[1:34:01] he chooses to leave the father doesn't
[1:34:04] push him out amen you can lose benefits
[1:34:08] this morning because you choose to leave
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:12] word you can lose the protection you can
[1:34:15] lose the provision by your own actions
[1:34:17] but God's not forcing you out you're
[1:34:18] doing it amen we've got a choice to make
[1:34:21] amen why cuz we're in a relationship now
[1:34:23] not of works but of Love Of Trust then
[1:34:26] we're in also a relationship of
[1:34:28] authority amen I've read this quote
[1:34:30] again before but I want to read it again
[1:34:32] and it'll settle our hearts this morning
[1:34:34] I think it'll encourage Us in the
[1:34:35] battles we're facing brother Braham said
[1:34:38] this he says he chose us in love before
[1:34:41] the foundation of the world he didn't
[1:34:42] choose us by our works he didn't choose
[1:34:45] us because he knew we'd be great people
[1:34:47] he chose us in love before the
[1:34:49] foundation of the world now watch having
[1:34:51] predestinated us under the adoption of
[1:34:53] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:34:55] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:34:56] will he says isn't that wonderful he
[1:34:59] loved you he loved you before there was
[1:35:01] a world he knew your nature he knew your
[1:35:04] weaknesses he knew your habits he knew
[1:35:07] all about you what you were going to be
[1:35:11] and then when he looked all over the
[1:35:13] great universe as it was he said I
[1:35:16] Choose
[1:35:18] You he says and when he did that before
[1:35:22] there ever was a spe of light then
[1:35:24] you're Eternal with
[1:35:27] God what was it you were in the original
[1:35:29] light not before Sunshine not before
[1:35:32] Moonlight not before Starlight you were
[1:35:34] in the original
[1:35:35] light and that light comes back now to
[1:35:38] show you who you
[1:35:39] are brother Ram puts it this way he says
[1:35:41] darkness is gathering what's it
[1:35:44] gathering for to show the light you say
[1:35:47] why is this world in such gross Darkness
[1:35:49] so that you can be
[1:35:51] revealed he says Isaiah 60: verse one
[1:35:54] Rise and Shine for the light has come to
[1:35:55] you that's the reason I can say shalom
[1:35:58] the light has come to you God's peace to
[1:36:00] the elected woman to the elected lady
[1:36:02] those who G before the foundation of the
[1:36:05] world called out and ordained to that
[1:36:07] the rest of them will never see it
[1:36:09] they'll never know nothing about it the
[1:36:11] Bible said so and Jesus said no man will
[1:36:13] come to me except my father draws him
[1:36:15] first and all the father has given me
[1:36:17] will come he says there stood Judas
[1:36:20] light shining up here but back in his
[1:36:23] heart was dark seed and when The
[1:36:24] Showdown came the darkness showed here
[1:36:28] was a little old woman he's speaking of
[1:36:30] the woman at the well all blacked out up
[1:36:32] here in front see by appearance Judas
[1:36:34] was a child of light and she was a child
[1:36:36] of Darkness God's not looking at that
[1:36:40] those are just conditions and
[1:36:42] circumstances he says but down here was
[1:36:45] a predestinated seed and when the light
[1:36:47] came it scattered the darkness and it
[1:36:49] showed forth we know messiah's coming
[1:36:52] and when he does he will show these
[1:36:53] things and Jesus said I am he but Judas
[1:36:58] doubted it yet supposed to be walking in
[1:37:01] the light he said see the light up here
[1:37:03] in the head doesn't matter it's the
[1:37:05] light down here in the heart that counts
[1:37:08] the light up here will walk and
[1:37:10] fellowship and everything else but when
[1:37:12] the real power of God comes in it can't
[1:37:14] come back to this dead seed and it'll
[1:37:16] reflect off in a denomination but when
[1:37:19] it's back down here a genuine
[1:37:21] predestinated seed when that light comes
[1:37:24] AC down here shows all the darkness away
[1:37:27] from you and puts you in fellowship with
[1:37:29] Christ he was the one who gave you life
[1:37:32] when before the foundation of the world
[1:37:35] otherwise you'll never see it what God
[1:37:38] Said what's he saying there's got to be
[1:37:40] a separation at some point that woman at
[1:37:43] the well in total darkness
[1:37:46] Church five marriages failed living
[1:37:49] common law but when she met the seventh
[1:37:52] man when she met the seventh man
[1:37:54] everything changed I believe she was
[1:37:57] with that group in Acts 8 that got the
[1:37:58] Holy Ghost remember Philip goes down to
[1:38:00] Samaria and he preaches and they're all
[1:38:02] baptized in jesus' name and then when
[1:38:04] the disciples heard that that Christ was
[1:38:06] preached in Samaria they go down and
[1:38:08] they what Peter and John go down they
[1:38:10] lay hands on them and they all get the
[1:38:11] Holy Ghost I believe she was one of them
[1:38:14] but that process of Separation
[1:38:17] started when the word crossed her path
[1:38:19] and she received it and accepted it amen
[1:38:24] what happens if there's no
[1:38:26] separation we're in a gray
[1:38:29] Zone we're in a partial
[1:38:31] Shadow we're in compromise that's what
[1:38:34] Leo deia is it's neither dark nor light
[1:38:39] it's neither right nor wrong it's
[1:38:41] neither hot nor cold it's a place of
[1:38:43] compromise it's a place of
[1:38:45] backsliding
[1:38:47] Amen God's desire is light or
[1:38:51] darkness that middle Zone where people
[1:38:53] are so comfortable that's the death zone
[1:38:57] it's a place of total compromise
[1:38:59] amen how do you know you're a child of
[1:39:01] God when the word comes your way you
[1:39:03] accept it that's it that's the way it's
[1:39:07] always been to whom did the word of God
[1:39:09] come in Corinth Sons that's what the
[1:39:12] scripture says amen you'll accept that
[1:39:15] light when it comes it doesn't matter
[1:39:16] what condition you're in doesn't matter
[1:39:18] how good you are how religious you are
[1:39:19] how spiritual you are or how much of a
[1:39:22] drunkard or a whatever a pervert
[1:39:24] whatever it might be what happens is
[1:39:26] what will you do with the word when it
[1:39:28] comes your way doesn't matter how good
[1:39:30] you were before what matters is what
[1:39:33] happens afterwards because if you
[1:39:35] receive it you'll be changed after that
[1:39:37] amen why because there's a separation
[1:39:39] that's going on of light and darkness
[1:39:42] brother BR puts it this way he says
[1:39:43] every Christian in here that's born
[1:39:44] again when God called you called for
[1:39:47] total separation if he didn't you got
[1:39:51] the wrong call
[1:39:54] amen did he call for total separation
[1:39:57] sister Brenda sister
[1:39:59] Moren amen some of us didn't have to
[1:40:02] separate that way brother Grant was it a
[1:40:05] total separation brother vichel it was a
[1:40:08] total separation wasn't it see so many
[1:40:11] of us are blessed with support of
[1:40:12] Christian families but some of us some
[1:40:16] of you you had to make a total
[1:40:19] separation from the very start
[1:40:24] but to deny it would be to deny who you
[1:40:27] were something is pushing you brother
[1:40:31] Vel I don't imagine you had an enjoyable
[1:40:33] moment with your
[1:40:35] family and Satan was there no doubt
[1:40:38] trying to get him to compromise in the
[1:40:40] smallest of
[1:40:42] ways why trying to get him out of the
[1:40:45] light but something inside of him Rises
[1:40:48] up and says not
[1:40:49] today not today I'm a Child of God can't
[1:40:52] do it
[1:40:54] to deny it would be to deny who I am to
[1:40:57] be it' be to deny who's inside of me and
[1:41:00] he can't help it
[1:41:02] amen how long did Abraham's separation
[1:41:04] take God comes and he says get thee out
[1:41:08] of thy land out of thy
[1:41:10] Kindred get away from all of it and what
[1:41:12] did Abraham do see we don't we don't
[1:41:15] like to put it this way but you know
[1:41:16] what Abraham said
[1:41:18] no see he left his land but he took his
[1:41:21] dad and he took lot
[1:41:23] Abraham wasn't obeying Church partial
[1:41:26] obedience entitles you to
[1:41:28] nothing total obedience entitles you to
[1:41:30] the Token remember and so Abraham leaves
[1:41:33] and I think it what took seven years for
[1:41:35] his father to die and then I don't know
[1:41:38] how many years it took for lot to go off
[1:41:39] into Sodom and then and only then did
[1:41:42] Abraham start to receive His
[1:41:45] blessings see it's a process of time
[1:41:48] who's in control there
[1:41:51] Abraham Abraham was controlling that
[1:41:53] that separation God gave the order God
[1:41:55] gave the means God gave the blessing God
[1:41:57] gave the promise but now it's on
[1:41:59] Abraham's lap Abraham are you going to
[1:42:01] separate or not and how quickly he did
[1:42:04] it determined how quickly he was going
[1:42:05] to get his
[1:42:06] Blessing brother puts it this way he
[1:42:08] says it is a total separation we're not
[1:42:11] to go back into the world no more or
[1:42:13] have anything to do with the world but
[1:42:15] cleave on only unto God Jesus is coming
[1:42:18] after a bride a woman a church that's
[1:42:21] separated from the things of the world
[1:42:22] or the cares of the world notice the
[1:42:24] things of the world or the cares of the
[1:42:26] world cuz the cares of the world are the
[1:42:28] things that choke out the Christian walk
[1:42:30] remember what he said in the parable of
[1:42:31] the
[1:42:32] swer cares of the world can choke us out
[1:42:34] as much as separation from the word
[1:42:37] itself see we say well I don't do this
[1:42:40] and I don't do this and I don't do this
[1:42:41] but if the cares of Life have overcome
[1:42:43] our Christian walk then guess what we're
[1:42:44] dying
[1:42:46] nonetheless he says she is separated
[1:42:50] from the Fashions of this Modern Age
[1:42:52] that we live in she is separated from
[1:42:54] the cares and the traditions of churches
[1:42:56] she is separated only to God he says and
[1:42:59] God is the word and as husband and wife
[1:43:02] is one so does the bride and the word
[1:43:04] become one for the word is living
[1:43:06] through the bride that's how that's her
[1:43:09] credentials that's her identification
[1:43:13] the word is living through her you're
[1:43:15] looking for where is Christ today where
[1:43:17] is the word being lived out now where's
[1:43:20] Church Creed being lived out now where
[1:43:22] are people mimicking the ministry but
[1:43:24] where is the word being lived out today
[1:43:27] that's what we're looking for remember
[1:43:28] when Peter and John stood before the the
[1:43:31] Pharisees and the council and they've
[1:43:33] been they went out and they' done signs
[1:43:35] and wonders and they put him in jail and
[1:43:36] they brought him forth and when they
[1:43:38] stood him before him they saw that they
[1:43:39] were ignorant and uned but one thing
[1:43:41] they saw they' been with Jesus why
[1:43:42] because they were the word was coming
[1:43:44] through them the same way it did through
[1:43:45] him signs wonders and IND Doctrine the
[1:43:50] whole package was there
[1:43:53] but R says that should be our attitude
[1:43:56] take the way with God's people
[1:43:59] regardless of whether it's hard or easy
[1:44:01] go anyhow be ready to go anytime now
[1:44:05] wherever he might call you you say well
[1:44:07] what if I do that what if you don't do
[1:44:10] that like I said before what does it
[1:44:12] profit a man if he gains the whole world
[1:44:13] but loses his
[1:44:15] soul we've seen people in this church
[1:44:17] make hard decisions for the word and has
[1:44:20] God ever failed us church has God ever
[1:44:23] neglected to come down and pour out a
[1:44:25] bounty on the decisions that we make
[1:44:27] according to the word I say he has he
[1:44:29] has every time he blesses us every time
[1:44:33] amen is it
[1:44:35] easy anybody here thinks separation is
[1:44:38] easy nope I got one shake of the
[1:44:41] head separation is not easy is it but
[1:44:45] it's necessary we have to walk in the
[1:44:47] light and that means Darkness has to go
[1:44:49] to the
[1:44:50] sideen you know what the hardest thing I
[1:44:52] find is is it's hard to be separate when
[1:44:54] people around you have the best of
[1:44:56] intentions when you're at work and
[1:44:58] people are trying to include you and
[1:44:59] people are trying to do certain things
[1:45:01] and they're trying to do everything they
[1:45:03] can and yet you just can't do it because
[1:45:06] that would go against the word of God
[1:45:09] they're not trying to make you do
[1:45:10] anything bad they're trying to
[1:45:12] accommodate they're trying to be
[1:45:13] generous they're trying to be gracious
[1:45:14] but yet it's still not enough and you
[1:45:17] have to say I'm so sorry I just can't do
[1:45:20] that and all you can do is trust that
[1:45:23] they can look at your life and look at
[1:45:24] your attitude and realize it's not
[1:45:26] personal you're just having to do what
[1:45:29] you have to do
[1:45:31] amen but beyond that like I said one of
[1:45:34] the hardest things is when that light of
[1:45:36] the word washes over you
[1:45:38] personally that woman at the well I
[1:45:40] Marvel I Marvel at her response the
[1:45:43] sarap phenician woman's the same way
[1:45:46] Jesus said it's not meat to give the
[1:45:47] children's bread to the dogs and she
[1:45:50] said yay Lord but the dogs eat the crumb
[1:45:53] off the floor that fall off the table
[1:45:56] she didn't get all oh can you imagine
[1:45:59] today if you said that to a woman of
[1:46:00] this
[1:46:01] world you'd be on the
[1:46:04] news you'd probably be
[1:46:07] charged but something in her responded
[1:46:11] to that word she said yay Lord you're
[1:46:15] absolutely
[1:46:17] right that woman at the well when he
[1:46:20] says bring your husband I have no
[1:46:22] husband he says you've said said truly
[1:46:23] for you have had five and the one you're
[1:46:25] with now is not your husband like I said
[1:46:27] she didn't back
[1:46:29] away you'd think maybe she thought you
[1:46:32] know if she was anybody else she have
[1:46:35] thought maybe he's coming on to me maybe
[1:46:37] he's a Jew maybe he's going to get all
[1:46:39] up on his high horse and he's going to
[1:46:41] start preaching at me about how I'm
[1:46:42] going to hell and I'm not a true child
[1:46:44] of God because I'm a half breed I'm a
[1:46:46] half Jew and I'm a half a gentile and
[1:46:48] there's no way I can go in and I'm
[1:46:49] outside of the
[1:46:51] Covenant she had every opportunity and
[1:46:54] I'm sure Satan would have wanted her to
[1:46:56] respond in the way that people today
[1:46:58] would but yet something in her said
[1:47:01] there's more to this than what I can
[1:47:04] see and church that's the total grace of
[1:47:08] God but yet that's the hardest thing is
[1:47:11] when the word gets
[1:47:13] personal and we're sitting under the
[1:47:15] hearing and the preaching of the word
[1:47:18] and he comes down and he does
[1:47:20] that and I have to raise my hand say yay
[1:47:25] lord it's
[1:47:29] me being a pastor being a preacher
[1:47:31] doesn't exclude you from
[1:47:35] struggles Satan's pushing harder on the
[1:47:37] ministry probably than anyone
[1:47:40] else don't think we don't fail at
[1:47:44] times so when he gets
[1:47:46] personal what do we do do we open the
[1:47:50] door where no light is
[1:47:54] or do we close the door and say not
[1:47:57] today because here's the thing light's
[1:48:00] coming one way or the
[1:48:01] other and we can go easy and we can open
[1:48:04] the
[1:48:05] door or we can close it and he can kick
[1:48:08] it in because one way or another light's
[1:48:10] going to win Church light's going to win
[1:48:14] this body is completely overwhelmed by
[1:48:16] sin it's born in sin it's bound by sin
[1:48:18] it's shaped in sin amen and it's going
[1:48:21] to take a resurrection and a Rapture to
[1:48:22] change it I reminded of the story I'm
[1:48:24] told of Aunt s dicks what was she
[1:48:27] 998 and she's in the old folks home
[1:48:29] she's laying on her bed she can't even
[1:48:31] get around and she's talking about the
[1:48:33] Battle she's
[1:48:34] facing how hard can it be how hard can
[1:48:38] it be your your food's taken care of
[1:48:40] you've got a bed there you you know you
[1:48:42] would think how can you have a real
[1:48:44] struggle in there you can't really see
[1:48:46] anything you can't hear anything and yet
[1:48:48] she would say Satan's fighting me so
[1:48:50] hard why we in a battle there's a
[1:48:54] separation going on
[1:48:57] Amen youo in our living room we have pot
[1:48:59] lights that are built in and they're
[1:49:01] controlled by a dimmer switch and when
[1:49:03] we're in that room we turn the lights on
[1:49:05] by flipping a switch but then that
[1:49:07] dimmer switch controls whether the
[1:49:08] lights are low or they go all the way up
[1:49:10] to very very ey scorchingly
[1:49:14] bright amen it's all based on what we do
[1:49:17] with that dimmer switch I thought about
[1:49:19] this I thought we're kind of like these
[1:49:21] lights Jesus said let your sight light
[1:49:22] so shine before men and we've got a
[1:49:24] controller built in so what brother Mark
[1:49:27] was talking about having a clean heart
[1:49:29] and a clear
[1:49:30] mind amen the problem is not the
[1:49:33] electricity in the CH in the house
[1:49:35] there's more than enough electricity to
[1:49:37] make those lights as bright as I could
[1:49:38] ever want them the question is what am I
[1:49:41] going to do with the dimmer switch
[1:49:44] that's the only thing I hold that
[1:49:46] control amen and so there's a way that
[1:49:49] those lights can be totally off or they
[1:49:51] can be glaringly bright and it's up to
[1:49:53] me how bright that light
[1:49:56] goes I can put a damper on the Holy
[1:49:59] Spirit I can put a resistor in my
[1:50:02] life I can put a resistor in my life
[1:50:06] amen I can do things that hold him back
[1:50:10] and it dampens my faith that dampens my
[1:50:13] walk and that dampens my
[1:50:15] light
[1:50:17] amen that's my choice the problem ain't
[1:50:20] the electricity
[1:50:23] the problems the dimmer
[1:50:26] switch limitation isn't on God's in
[1:50:29] church limitation is on me how much will
[1:50:33] I let
[1:50:34] go how much will I
[1:50:37] Surrender I'll tell you let him do it
[1:50:39] one time and Watch What
[1:50:43] Happens let the Holy Spirit have full
[1:50:46] control lay it down one time clean it up
[1:50:49] one time set yourself aside one time and
[1:50:52] say say Lord I'm here and watch what
[1:50:56] happens I'm a living testimony of what
[1:50:59] God can do in a
[1:51:01] life you have your own testimony I have
[1:51:03] mine God can clean you up from lust God
[1:51:06] can clean you up from Pride God can
[1:51:08] clean you up from cynicism God can clean
[1:51:10] you up from self-loathing
[1:51:12] God can clean you up from depression I
[1:51:15] say that as a personal witness amen but
[1:51:18] you got to let him have full
[1:51:20] control listen there's some things in
[1:51:23] our lives that we shouldn't even talk
[1:51:24] about but we can sit here and say today
[1:51:26] that's what I used to
[1:51:28] be we don't give glory to that we give
[1:51:31] glory to the god that took us out of
[1:51:33] that amen we don't glory in in the fact
[1:51:36] that we did a wrong thing or we were
[1:51:38] Bound in sin and hardship and we made
[1:51:40] bad choices what we glory in is that
[1:51:42] what I'm not what I used to be like that
[1:51:45] saying was in that woman amen what did
[1:51:48] she say I'm not what I want to be I'm
[1:51:51] not what I ought to be
[1:51:53] but thank God I'm not what I used to be
[1:51:58] amen my testimony this morning is I'm no
[1:52:01] longer a
[1:52:02] slave I'm a Child of
[1:52:05] God Paul said to the Corinthians
[1:52:07] remember in the Corinthians he told them
[1:52:09] all Corinthians were a rough Church they
[1:52:11] needed a lot of
[1:52:12] work but Paul says now where the Lord
[1:52:15] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:52:17] the spirit of the Lord is there's
[1:52:20] liberty Paul didn't say because you're a
[1:52:22] horrible Corinthian Church then God
[1:52:24] isn't
[1:52:25] there no no he says you're children of
[1:52:27] God holy spirit's come to
[1:52:30] you and you had horrible lives and
[1:52:32] you've had horrible situations and
[1:52:34] you've had this one doing this and you
[1:52:35] got to throw them out of the church and
[1:52:36] you got to bring them back in later and
[1:52:38] I was just testing you and it was a hard
[1:52:40] Ro it was a hard
[1:52:42] go but Paul never says because of what
[1:52:45] you are today God has abandoned you God
[1:52:49] won't work with you God won't change you
[1:52:51] but he says now the Lord is that spirit
[1:52:53] and where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:52:55] there is Liberty what's Liberty to the
[1:52:57] believer living where we ought
[1:52:59] to amen living by the word not how we
[1:53:02] like to humanly speaking but how we
[1:53:04] ought to by the word of God he says but
[1:53:06] we all with open face beholding as in
[1:53:08] the glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:53:10] changed unto the same image from glory
[1:53:14] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:53:17] Lord that word Glory means the
[1:53:19] manifestation of God to manifestation of
[1:53:22] God
[1:53:23] in other words you don't have it all in
[1:53:25] a moment but God is revealing himself in
[1:53:28] you God's revealing himself in you and
[1:53:29] he's going step by step by step Page by
[1:53:33] Page day by day bit by
[1:53:35] bit it's a process of Time Light being
[1:53:40] separated from Darkness it's pushing out
[1:53:42] as the world is turning around into the
[1:53:44] into the light of the Sun what happens
[1:53:46] is what was in darkness now becomes
[1:53:48] light and under a full Revolution the
[1:53:51] whole thing sees light
[1:53:52] amen bit by bit Moment by moment change
[1:53:55] from one thing to another to another to
[1:53:58] another that means it's going to take
[1:54:00] time it's like that dimmer switch and
[1:54:01] what's happening is God is slowly
[1:54:03] raising the dimmer switch to the
[1:54:04] resurrection and Rapture
[1:54:06] setting amen as brother Mark preached on
[1:54:09] that Faith what's happening is Faith is
[1:54:11] moving up and up and up not bound by
[1:54:14] conditions not bound by circumstances
[1:54:16] now but what is it doing it's elevated
[1:54:18] by the word where you're looking at what
[1:54:20] the word says not what the situation
[1:54:22] says when you're looking at what the
[1:54:23] word says not what your circumstances
[1:54:25] say where you're looking at what the
[1:54:26] word says not what your DNA says it's
[1:54:29] being built up from glory to glory to
[1:54:31] glory to glory to glory until you're in
[1:54:34] the perfect image of Christ that he had
[1:54:37] before you before the foundation of the
[1:54:38] world
[1:54:41] Amen Paul says because the creature
[1:54:43] itself also shall future tense be
[1:54:47] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:54:50] into the Glorious Liberty of the
[1:54:52] children of God it's a process that
[1:54:54] finishes with a body change it's a
[1:54:57] process of time that finishes with a
[1:55:00] body change amen there's something
[1:55:02] that's going on throughout the whole
[1:55:04] thing I've read this quote before and
[1:55:06] we're almost done this
[1:55:07] morning he says all that comes to me
[1:55:10] I'll give them Zoey my own life will
[1:55:12] give them my own life and they shall
[1:55:14] never perish and I'll raise them up at
[1:55:15] the last day in other words everyone
[1:55:17] that comes to me I'll wrap him in me now
[1:55:21] what is he he's light and he's life he
[1:55:25] says amen and he'll become a part of me
[1:55:27] and he can no more die than I can die
[1:55:29] for I'm Immortal and can't die and his
[1:55:31] soul is Immortal and can't die and I'll
[1:55:34] raise him up again at the last day he
[1:55:36] says then that just makes us when the
[1:55:39] old trials get hard say in me dwelleth
[1:55:42] the spirit of God there's no good thing
[1:55:46] in here but him that's in there he says
[1:55:49] I'm not my own I'm his I don't look for
[1:55:52] the things of the world I look for him
[1:55:55] for my hopes are built on him someday I
[1:55:57] shall see him and that's all I have long
[1:56:00] for what I live for is to bring people
[1:56:02] to him he says and I tell you the old
[1:56:05] shackles begin to drop off and you start
[1:56:09] walking a new
[1:56:13] again he says
[1:56:16] again sometimes we stop
[1:56:18] walking don't we
[1:56:22] we sit down and we say you know what I'm
[1:56:28] done and we watch everybody going by in
[1:56:31] their lives and their Christian walk and
[1:56:32] they're better than me and boy they're
[1:56:34] sure not struggling and boy what do we
[1:56:36] do we sit
[1:56:39] down but he says no no
[1:56:41] no he'll come
[1:56:43] by he'll remind you he ain't about you
[1:56:46] son it's not about you
[1:56:49] daughter it's I can do all things
[1:56:51] through Christ
[1:56:53] and then what happens is you pick
[1:56:54] yourself up again I think I did 48 kilm
[1:56:58] of walking in the bush this week over 5
[1:57:02] days that's not walking on nice smooth
[1:57:04] easy roads that's walking through bushes
[1:57:06] through trees through
[1:57:09] swamps let me tell you by the fifth
[1:57:12] day I wanted to do
[1:57:16] this and wait for the Moose to come to
[1:57:19] me in the
[1:57:20] cabin we get tired don't we we get tired
[1:57:24] we get weary I was dehydrated I was
[1:57:27] sleep deprived I was dried out my eyes
[1:57:30] were bugging me again I did not want to
[1:57:32] go out I felt like the United States
[1:57:35] Postal Service cuz we got sleep we got
[1:57:38] rain we got snow and we got wind and
[1:57:40] what do what does their thing say
[1:57:41] neither slay sleep rain nor sleep nor
[1:57:43] snow nor hail I got almost all of it
[1:57:45] sitting out
[1:57:47] there but
[1:57:49] what something in me said the moose
[1:57:52] aren't going to come into the living
[1:57:54] room the resurrection is not coming to
[1:57:56] me if I'm sitting on a
[1:57:58] couch but something Rises up within us
[1:58:01] and says Get Up
[1:58:03] Soldier get up child of God kick those
[1:58:06] shackles off and keep walking again
[1:58:09] that's it that's it something keeps
[1:58:12] holding me I'm not holding it something
[1:58:14] keeps holding me the spirit of God
[1:58:16] raises up a standard and what is it
[1:58:19] brother Ram says he's pouring more of
[1:58:21] his spirit in
[1:58:23] that's my hope that's my rest that's my
[1:58:25] strength this
[1:58:29] morning it's not my discipline that gets
[1:58:31] me out in doing this Christian walk
[1:58:33] every day that's for sure barely gets me
[1:58:35] out for the
[1:58:40] Moose he says I tell you the old
[1:58:42] shackles begin to drop off what is that
[1:58:44] that's what a slave wears he says they
[1:58:47] begin to drop off and you start walking
[1:58:49] a new again I can do all things through
[1:58:52] Christ which strengthens
[1:58:54] me what does the scripture say a just
[1:58:56] man fth seven times and Rises up
[1:58:59] again it's not about the falling down
[1:59:01] it's about the getting up amen and
[1:59:03] that's what the spirit of God is doing
[1:59:04] this morning look at Rahab a prostitute
[1:59:08] can you imagine her life we don't know
[1:59:10] how old she was when Jericho finally
[1:59:12] fell but the word came her way and she
[1:59:15] accepted it and she married a captain in
[1:59:17] the Army and she went into the natural
[1:59:18] lineage of Jesus Christ changed in a
[1:59:21] moment
[1:59:22] that woman at the well five husbands
[1:59:25] common law with the
[1:59:26] six then meets the seventh the Son of
[1:59:29] God a son of man a prophet and she
[1:59:32] started changing she wasn't totally
[1:59:35] changed but light started working in her
[1:59:38] life and darkness started to go out she
[1:59:41] left her water pots she left her
[1:59:45] shame she left all the feelings of ostra
[1:59:48] being
[1:59:49] ostracized and she went in and she
[1:59:51] started started testifying she lost all
[1:59:54] her inhibitions from her choices and
[1:59:57] started testifying of the word and the
[2:00:00] church and the and the the people came
[2:00:02] out and I believe Jesus was there for
[2:00:03] two or three days and they said to they
[2:00:06] said now we we came out because of what
[2:00:09] you said but we stayed and we believed
[2:00:11] because of what he said what they got
[2:00:14] the same thing that she got and later on
[2:00:16] the disciples came back and led them all
[2:00:17] into what Total light the baptism of the
[2:00:20] Holy Ghost we're going to close with
[2:00:22] some quotes
[2:00:24] here he says it's God's promise he' pour
[2:00:28] out his spirit in the last days and
[2:00:30] that's what they would do notice they
[2:00:31] laid their hands on the sick everything
[2:00:33] that was in God's promise I shall pour
[2:00:36] out my spirit in the last days upon All
[2:00:38] Flesh your old men shall dream dreams
[2:00:40] your young men shall see visions and all
[2:00:43] these different promises he made
[2:00:44] everything is laying right there in
[2:00:46] God's promise Jesus redeemed it to us
[2:00:49] and if we are ordained on that ground if
[2:00:52] we are ordained to be on that ground
[2:00:55] it's like the eagle walking in the
[2:00:56] chicken's Nest he says if you're
[2:00:58] ordained on that ground the holy spirit
[2:01:01] is here to find you and when it finds
[2:01:04] you you recognize its call you know the
[2:01:07] hour you're living you know that these
[2:01:09] things are supposed to happen he says
[2:01:11] and quickly you're raptured up to meet
[2:01:16] it
[2:01:18] oh anybody here raptured this morning
[2:01:22] you were raptured then you recognize
[2:01:25] your place you recognize your position
[2:01:27] you recognize who you were the Rapture
[2:01:30] happened then but it's a process of
[2:01:33] time it's a done deal
[2:01:36] there but you've got to go through the
[2:01:38] process of the Rapture now he says
[2:01:41] quickly you're raptured up to meet it
[2:01:43] and now you're setting in Heavenly
[2:01:45] places in Christ Jesus Oh What A Promise
[2:01:47] what a heavenly father who would give us
[2:01:49] these things the spirit quickens their
[2:01:52] fellowship with God so that they call
[2:01:54] the dead back to life in that day they
[2:01:56] laid their bodies upon the dead and they
[2:01:57] came to life he says listen closely they
[2:02:00] did the same things that Jesus did
[2:02:02] because the same spirit that was upon
[2:02:03] him was upon them and if one spirit
[2:02:06] makes a man act this way it makes the
[2:02:08] other one act that way he says then how
[2:02:12] can this come upon how can this come
[2:02:14] upon and say he's got the spirit of God
[2:02:17] and deny the works of God it can't do it
[2:02:19] notice God's life which is in the Greek
[2:02:21] called Zoe moved through them and in
[2:02:23] them it quickened their minds to his
[2:02:26] word he says now let me say it real
[2:02:29] quietly now the spirit of God that moves
[2:02:33] among the people quickens the mind of
[2:02:35] the person to the promise of God see it
[2:02:38] does it look and then he says now see
[2:02:41] I'm trying to show you and just let you
[2:02:43] realize now of the I'm speaking now of
[2:02:47] the
[2:02:48] Church of the church and also quick
[2:02:51] Quicken to life in him we have so many
[2:02:55] people that believe the Book of
[2:02:58] Acts for the day of the book of Acts but
[2:03:01] they don't believe it today but BR say
[2:03:04] I'm trying to get you to realize if the
[2:03:06] Same Spirit did that in them and it's in
[2:03:08] you today then the same spirit will do
[2:03:10] the same thing in you today it'll cause
[2:03:13] you to fulfill the word for your
[2:03:15] day he says although they only were his
[2:03:19] attributes to begin with
[2:03:22] only his attributes what an
[2:03:24] understatement you're only an attribute
[2:03:26] of god sister
[2:03:28] Lydia you're only an attribute of
[2:03:31] God
[2:03:33] hallelujah you're only an attribute of
[2:03:35] God I'd look at it the other way that's
[2:03:37] all I am there's nothing else why
[2:03:40] because light separates from Darkness
[2:03:42] the only thing that's in me in the
[2:03:44] reality of God's word is his attribute
[2:03:48] and everything else is being
[2:03:50] separated under the hearing of the word
[2:03:52] by the Holy Spirit he says but if God
[2:03:54] said in this day back in the beginning
[2:03:56] John Doe will be my servant millions of
[2:03:59] years ago now John Doe is born in sin
[2:04:02] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[2:04:04] speaking lies because he's Immortal but
[2:04:06] maybe he gets a little religious feeling
[2:04:08] he'll go join a church maybe he'll join
[2:04:10] a Pentecostal church he might join
[2:04:12] anything but let him get under the
[2:04:14] atmosphere of God once Amen brother
[2:04:17] Grant you can be in a Pentecostal church
[2:04:19] and get under the real atmosphere under
[2:04:21] the the real word and he says what one
[2:04:24] see John Doe is bound to recognize who
[2:04:27] his father is he's not a church
[2:04:30] member we're not message Believers we're
[2:04:33] children of God otherwise we're just
[2:04:36] another
[2:04:39] denomination he's let him get under the
[2:04:41] atmosphere of God once see John do is
[2:04:43] bound to recognize who his father is
[2:04:45] just as that eagle recognized who the
[2:04:47] mother was it's God to realize it see
[2:04:49] only that John Doe is God's attribute
[2:04:52] that's become a word spoken and then the
[2:04:55] Holy Spirit seeks that word
[2:04:58] out here it is he says he calls him
[2:05:02] gives him everlasting life and brings
[2:05:04] him into the presence of God God's word
[2:05:08] God had the same when he saw Jesus it
[2:05:10] was the finished work that God finished
[2:05:11] with Jesus when he said it's finished
[2:05:13] all the plan was finished and when the
[2:05:16] spirit of God comes upon you and you
[2:05:18] truly are one of God's attributes that
[2:05:20] he spoke of he says now if you're not
[2:05:22] you'll wonder and frustrate and run here
[2:05:25] and there and everything else and never
[2:05:28] come to the knowledge of the
[2:05:30] truth I don't want to be that he says
[2:05:34] but if you're one of those the old
[2:05:37] things pass away right quick and you
[2:05:39] become new and the Plan of Salvation is
[2:05:43] finished hallelujah praise the Lord he
[2:05:45] says you're ready to obey every word
[2:05:47] that God ever spoke of you for you to do
[2:05:50] you're submissive to to his word the
[2:05:53] abstract to the contract the title deed
[2:05:55] belongs to you the debts are all paid
[2:05:57] it's all struck off as it was at the day
[2:06:01] of Pentecost amen God bless you let's
[2:06:03] stand this
[2:06:05] morning amen I've taken my
[2:06:08] time amen but I believe God's been in it
