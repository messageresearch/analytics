[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:05] Jesus
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:07] [Music]
[1:18:19] a minute that's our confession let's
[1:18:23] just bow our heads and talk to him this
[1:18:25] evening
[1:18:27] Heavenly Father Lord we've gathered in
[1:18:29] your name Lord we've sung your praises
[1:18:35] though we've lifted up our voices and
[1:18:37] made a sacrifice and the Lord your
[1:18:40] presence is here we all know it with all
[1:18:43] we pray now that you have moved forward
[1:18:44] in the the ministering of the word
[1:18:46] Heavenly Father Lord not just in word
[1:18:49] Lord but in spirit and in power Lord
[1:18:51] Jesus that you would touch the lives and
[1:18:53] hearts of each one that's gathered in
[1:18:55] Lord some from far some from near Lord
[1:18:57] Jesus but or we believe that it will not
[1:19:00] be in vain tonight but that you can
[1:19:02] touch each heart and soul that's here
[1:19:03] Lord that you can heal the sick Lord
[1:19:05] that you can lure redeem those that are
[1:19:08] lost Lord that you can deliver those
[1:19:10] that are afflicted or just have your way
[1:19:13] with your people tonight we surrender
[1:19:14] ourselves to you and Jesus Christ's name
[1:19:17] we ask you amen amen if you'll open your
[1:19:21] your Bibles this morning to or this
[1:19:23] evening to first Peter it's tough coming
[1:19:27] out here because you are all warmed up
[1:19:29] and I'm not they almost need to need to
[1:19:31] put a treadmill in there so that the
[1:19:33] preacher can almost get up to speed you
[1:19:35] know what you'd almost be fooled I think
[1:19:38] you guys came for church tonight or
[1:19:39] something you know so praise the Lord
[1:19:42] for that it's nice to come out and just
[1:19:43] feel relaxed and and not under stress
[1:19:45] and just able to sit back and just let
[1:19:48] the Lord have his wonderful way men I
[1:19:51] bring greetings from my wife I know she
[1:19:53] streaming now watching but she wished
[1:19:55] she could be here but with the kids in
[1:19:56] school and birthdays and all that not
[1:19:59] really gonna happen this time but I know
[1:20:01] she's watching and really wishes she
[1:20:03] could be here so she's here as best she
[1:20:04] can be and that's online so you know
[1:20:07] it's hard to come back we had a
[1:20:08] wonderful time last time and it's hard
[1:20:10] to come back because everybody's kind of
[1:20:11] got an expectation and Aaron McGarry had
[1:20:15] a similar experience here a while back
[1:20:17] at the Cloverdale Church and they just
[1:20:19] had tremendous services and he came back
[1:20:20] and he said I don't know how we're going
[1:20:22] to
[1:20:23] this again and he was worried because
[1:20:25] the expectation is we're gonna have the
[1:20:26] exact same thing but better right and
[1:20:29] that should be our expectation but it's
[1:20:31] how the Lord will move that's what we
[1:20:33] want but he said in the end he says what
[1:20:35] are you gonna do he says keep doing what
[1:20:37] you're doing what you did last time
[1:20:38] worked so just keep doing it now right
[1:20:41] and then the Lord will move and he'll
[1:20:42] have his way and whatever is supposed to
[1:20:43] happen will happen and whether it's the
[1:20:45] shouting and the dancing and the and the
[1:20:47] praising or whether it's the quietness
[1:20:49] and and the tears and the repentance
[1:20:51] whatever it may be right he's gonna have
[1:20:53] his way this evening so turn into first
[1:20:55] Peter and we'll start at chapter 1 verse
[1:20:58] 5 first Peter 1 verse 5 it says who are
[1:21:04] kept by the power of God through faith
[1:21:05] unto salvation ready to be revealed in
[1:21:09] the last time this is the last time
[1:21:11] we're in you greatly rejoice though now
[1:21:13] for a season if need be we are in
[1:21:16] heaviness through manifold temptations
[1:21:17] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:21:20] more precious than of gold that
[1:21:22] perisheth don't be tried with fire might
[1:21:25] be found unto praise and honor and glory
[1:21:27] at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:29] you can have your seats this evening I
[1:21:31] want to sort of set a bit of a
[1:21:33] foundation and teach a little bit before
[1:21:35] we move into the rest of the service but
[1:21:37] as I was just praying on this the
[1:21:39] thought came to me and kind of what kept
[1:21:41] coming over and over was this idea of
[1:21:42] pure gold and so for a topic tonight for
[1:21:45] a title I want to call it more precious
[1:21:48] than gold amen and gold was everything
[1:21:50] back when the scripture was written if
[1:21:52] you had gold then your life was set gold
[1:21:54] was money gold was your access to to
[1:21:57] wealth and fame and all the pleasures of
[1:21:58] life and food and the necessities of
[1:22:01] life as well and when Peter starts
[1:22:03] talking about something that's more
[1:22:04] precious than gold he's saying this is
[1:22:06] more precious than anything you can get
[1:22:07] in this world this is more precious than
[1:22:09] anything that can be used to get
[1:22:11] anything in this world he's saying this
[1:22:13] is the lottery if you will for the
[1:22:14] believer these these trials of your
[1:22:17] faith are more precious than any of
[1:22:18] those things and I actually looked into
[1:22:20] how much gold they bring in and Solomon
[1:22:22] would get about 1.6 billion dollars in
[1:22:25] gold 25 tons a year was what Solomon had
[1:22:28] and it was so yet so much he had an
[1:22:31] ivory throne and he overlaid it
[1:22:33] completely with gold he had golden cups
[1:22:35] he had golden plates everything he had
[1:22:37] was covered in gold you know and Solomon
[1:22:39] was a you know he was a type of the of
[1:22:42] the millennium and these different
[1:22:43] things and whatnot and it was defined by
[1:22:45] his wealth but then Peter comes along
[1:22:49] and he says this is worth more than
[1:22:51] everything that Solomon had this is more
[1:22:53] valuable than all the gold that you can
[1:22:56] have and all the Ferraris and big houses
[1:22:58] and all these different things you could
[1:22:59] get he says this is worth more than all
[1:23:01] of those things put together you take
[1:23:03] everything in the world he says this
[1:23:05] what you have is more precious than
[1:23:07] anything else that you could ever get in
[1:23:09] this world amen so let's start again but
[1:23:11] let's start at verse 3 this time I like
[1:23:13] to keep the opening scripture short and
[1:23:14] we'll start to dig into it a little bit
[1:23:15] but again just trying to set a
[1:23:17] foundation here so if you'll bear with
[1:23:18] me for 15 or 20 minutes well this won't
[1:23:21] be new to you but then we'll maybe move
[1:23:22] into some things that are a little
[1:23:24] different so first Peter 1 verse 3 says
[1:23:26] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:23:28] Lord Jesus Christ which according to his
[1:23:30] abundant mercy has begotten us on to a
[1:23:32] lively hope that's a Living Hope and at
[1:23:35] the amplify says it's a hope that
[1:23:37] doesn't fade away or in he says by what
[1:23:39] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:23:41] the dead and what is this hope he says
[1:23:44] it's an inheritance incorruptible and
[1:23:46] undefiled and that fadeth not away
[1:23:48] reserved in heaven for you so this is
[1:23:51] not something that could be bought with
[1:23:52] gold because gold perish it than
[1:23:53] anything that is bought with gold can
[1:23:55] perish but he says this hope that you
[1:23:57] have is incorruptible and undefiled and
[1:24:00] he says what who are kept what the ones
[1:24:02] that are called now to this inheritance
[1:24:04] he says they are kept by what the power
[1:24:07] of God through faith unto salvation
[1:24:10] ready to be revealed in the last time so
[1:24:12] again we're in the last times now so
[1:24:14] this is specifically an endtime message
[1:24:16] if you will an endtime scripture for us
[1:24:19] is that there's a particular purity of
[1:24:21] this gold that's going to be at the end
[1:24:22] time amen he says now in here
[1:24:25] wherein ye greatly rejoice so you
[1:24:28] rejoice in the incorruptible and her
[1:24:30] inheritance
[1:24:31] though now for a season so he says your
[1:24:33] rejoicing and what's coming you rejoice
[1:24:35] and what's given to you but he says
[1:24:37] though if now for a season if need be ye
[1:24:40] are in heaviness through manifold
[1:24:42] temptations so he says for now you're
[1:24:44] gonna have to go through tough times but
[1:24:46] your your join in this year your
[1:24:48] rejoicing in this because you know
[1:24:50] coming because of what's happening to
[1:24:52] you amen so he's saying you're looking
[1:24:53] to what's there but you're gonna not
[1:24:55] have a great time in the meantime you
[1:24:57] know so he says what you're in heaviness
[1:25:00] to manifold temptations that the trial
[1:25:02] of your faith being much more precious
[1:25:03] than of gold that perisheth don't be
[1:25:06] tried with fires so the purest gold is
[1:25:08] the gold that's tried in the fire it's
[1:25:10] the gold that's beaten over and over and
[1:25:12] over again and we're very familiar where
[1:25:14] it talks about they what they beat the
[1:25:16] gold until they can see their reflection
[1:25:18] in it so the gold that has passed
[1:25:19] through fire that is tried with fire is
[1:25:21] the purest gold and it is the only gold
[1:25:24] that will show a pure reflection of the
[1:25:25] one that's beating it amen so he says
[1:25:27] what the trial of your faith being more
[1:25:29] precious than of gold that perishes
[1:25:31] might be found to three - these three
[1:25:34] things the praise the honor and the
[1:25:36] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:25:39] so he says this is all going to be for
[1:25:41] the praise and honor of glory when
[1:25:42] Christ is revealed now people look at
[1:25:45] that scripture oft times and they think
[1:25:46] well that's going to be when we go in a
[1:25:48] rapture right when Christ is revealed
[1:25:50] but we know that in a bride there is a
[1:25:54] revealing of Christ that happens right
[1:25:55] here and that's what he's talking about
[1:25:57] this is a compound scripture where he
[1:25:58] says yes it's going to be a wonderful
[1:26:00] thing when you see him when you go up in
[1:26:02] the air but it's an even more wonderful
[1:26:03] thing when you see him down here because
[1:26:06] you don't need to be beaten when you're
[1:26:07] going up there it's down here that
[1:26:09] things have to be refined amen so he's
[1:26:11] saying there's gonna be praise and honor
[1:26:13] and glory in these trials right here
[1:26:15] right now you don't have to wait till
[1:26:17] then to rejoice over what's happening
[1:26:19] amen there's something that's going on
[1:26:20] here that's worthy of lifting up and
[1:26:23] glorifying God amen so when we hear that
[1:26:27] phrase more precious than gold
[1:26:28] most of us would pick up our our ears a
[1:26:30] little bit you know and then we hear
[1:26:32] it's the trial of our faith and then we
[1:26:34] kind of just deflate a little bit
[1:26:35] because we're all lifted up oh yeah more
[1:26:38] precious than gold give me that and then
[1:26:39] trial of your faith uh-huh
[1:26:41] you know and then and then a visiting
[1:26:43] minister comes and says let's preach on
[1:26:45] the trial of your faith and everyone
[1:26:46] kind of drops a little bit as well right
[1:26:48] right there's lots of blood in the seats
[1:26:50] already why is he doing this right
[1:26:51] brother Gerald anyways what my hope is
[1:26:55] to lift us up above the idea of just the
[1:26:58] struggles and the trials and get down
[1:26:59] into what's happening when that happens
[1:27:01] and really see not we
[1:27:03] and the purpose in our head we all
[1:27:05] understand the purpose in her head but I
[1:27:07] guarantee nobody is in here saying Lord
[1:27:09] give me more trials nobody say nah I
[1:27:13] understand how value but they are Lord
[1:27:15] can you give me a trial today anybody
[1:27:17] asks for a trial lately not directly but
[1:27:20] what do we do we say Lord give me more
[1:27:22] peace
[1:27:22] give me more patience give me more love
[1:27:25] give me more grace and what does he do
[1:27:28] he sends you a trial to show you that
[1:27:31] either you have it or he gives you a
[1:27:33] trial so that you'll live up to what you
[1:27:36] need and he'll build it up in you and
[1:27:38] he'll keep putting that one in front of
[1:27:39] you until you pass it right so we don't
[1:27:41] ask for the trials but we ask for God we
[1:27:43] ask for more of him in our lives and
[1:27:45] what does he do he gives us a trial and
[1:27:47] he gives us a temptation so that what we
[1:27:49] can we can actually manifest it or else
[1:27:51] we can go and we fall down and we trip
[1:27:53] up and then we say Lord I don't have
[1:27:54] what I need
[1:27:55] can you fill me up with that and then he
[1:27:58] says well I need room I need room to put
[1:28:00] it in you're all full up so what are you
[1:28:01] gonna let me take away right and then
[1:28:03] it's a cycle that goes over and over and
[1:28:05] over again so like I said I'm hoping
[1:28:08] we'll approach trials a little bit more
[1:28:10] differently and when you're in them
[1:28:11] you'll approach them differently and
[1:28:12] you'll be looking for a different thing
[1:28:14] rather than just to get out of them
[1:28:15] because as humans were we're all about
[1:28:18] pain relief right we don't want to go
[1:28:20] through something that's uncomfortable
[1:28:21] for any longer than we have to so off
[1:28:23] times when we're going through trials
[1:28:25] we're just about can we just get to the
[1:28:26] end here and really it's what's in the
[1:28:29] middle that's most valuable to us we're
[1:28:31] looking for the victory but it's what's
[1:28:32] happening between the promise and the
[1:28:34] result and you know when the fulfilling
[1:28:35] of that promise or the battle and the
[1:28:37] victory this is where all of our growth
[1:28:39] happens is in the middle amen
[1:28:42] so we we know there's a very familiar
[1:28:44] scripture in revelation 3 that says you
[1:28:47] know that he's talking about the
[1:28:48] Laodicean Church age and he says you
[1:28:50] need gold tried in the fire now we're
[1:28:52] not in the Laodicean Church age the
[1:28:54] bride can't be in the Laodicean Church
[1:28:56] age if you look in there it says he's
[1:28:57] what he's standing outside the church
[1:28:59] knocking and whosoever opens with him
[1:29:02] he'll come in and sup so we know that
[1:29:04] that cannot be the bride the bride is
[1:29:06] not in that Laodicean Church age because
[1:29:08] she's the one that opens the door amen
[1:29:10] so when he's saying this gold tried in
[1:29:11] the fire that is what happens to those
[1:29:13] that hear the angel messenger right you
[1:29:15] have to listen to the Holy Spirit that
[1:29:17] speaks to that angel messenger and says
[1:29:18] this is how you overcome in this age and
[1:29:21] the first thing he jumps on is he says I
[1:29:23] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:29:25] the fire that thou may us be rich so the
[1:29:29] one that has the most gold tried in the
[1:29:30] fire is rich but if we heard that the
[1:29:32] trial of your faith is more precious
[1:29:34] than gold then it stands too
[1:29:36] stands to reason that the one that has
[1:29:38] the most trials is the richest amongst
[1:29:40] us right because God's trying to do more
[1:29:43] now maybe you have more because you're
[1:29:44] not listening and you're not growing so
[1:29:45] maybe you're not the risk yours always
[1:29:47] but brother Branham jumps right on this
[1:29:50] and he says there is a gold of God and
[1:29:52] he takes us back to first Peter that we
[1:29:54] just read
[1:29:54] he says the gold of God is a christ-like
[1:29:57] character and the whole church blows up
[1:29:59] and says amen praise the Lord and then
[1:30:01] he says produced in the fiery furnace of
[1:30:04] affliction and everybody lowers their
[1:30:07] hand right he says this is not something
[1:30:09] that happens easily we think we can kind
[1:30:11] of just pray about it and then God gives
[1:30:13] it to us but he says no no it is through
[1:30:15] trials and temptations afflictions
[1:30:17] difficulties it's not only to give it to
[1:30:20] you but it's to prove that it's there
[1:30:21] and so that you'll grab an experience
[1:30:23] with God in the manifestation of God in
[1:30:26] your life that can never be challenged
[1:30:28] by somebody because there's always going
[1:30:30] to be somebody that's smarter than you
[1:30:31] there's always going to be somebody that
[1:30:33] can tie you in circles with the
[1:30:34] scripture and with the message and all
[1:30:35] these different things but when you have
[1:30:37] an experience with God that has stood
[1:30:39] the test of time over and over and over
[1:30:41] again somebody who come to tell you this
[1:30:43] isn't real and you're saying it's too
[1:30:45] late it's already real in me right and
[1:30:48] so now they're they're trying to fight
[1:30:49] your testimony as opposed to your
[1:30:51] intellectual knowledge amen
[1:30:53] you man you can't have one without the
[1:30:56] other he says the gold of God is a
[1:30:57] christ-like character he says but it has
[1:31:00] to be produced in the fiery furnace of
[1:31:02] affliction the brand said this in the in
[1:31:05] the the Smyrna and church age he says
[1:31:07] why does he stand by speaking of when
[1:31:09] you know things are going bad he says
[1:31:11] why does he stand by he said their
[1:31:12] reason is in Romans 8 he says and if we
[1:31:15] are children then heirs heirs of God and
[1:31:17] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:31:19] suffer with him that we also may be
[1:31:21] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:31:23] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:31:25] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:31:27] which shall be revealed in us then he
[1:31:29] says unless we suffer with
[1:31:31] we cannot reign with him you have to
[1:31:33] suffer terrain the reason for that is
[1:31:35] that character simply is never made
[1:31:37] without suffering right and you'll find
[1:31:40] that it if you you ever meet a child
[1:31:42] from a wealthy home that's been given
[1:31:44] everything that they they want they
[1:31:46] never have character because they have
[1:31:48] everything but they didn't go through
[1:31:49] anything they didn't earn it there they
[1:31:51] don't have any blood sweat and tears
[1:31:52] they have no investment in it they just
[1:31:54] have it so he says you can't have this
[1:31:56] without suffering because why character
[1:31:59] is a victory not a gift and then a very
[1:32:02] familiar familiar quote he says a man
[1:32:04] without character count rain because
[1:32:06] power apart from character is satanic
[1:32:08] but power with characters fit to rule
[1:32:11] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:32:13] throne on the same basis that he
[1:32:15] overcame and is set down in his Father's
[1:32:17] throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:32:20] with him he says that is what Peter said
[1:32:22] is it strange that God wants us to
[1:32:24] develop a christ-like character that
[1:32:26] comes through suffering
[1:32:27] no sir he says and we all have trials so
[1:32:31] this this we don't suffer for no reason
[1:32:34] right God doesn't sometimes we sit think
[1:32:36] that God's up there just letting things
[1:32:38] happen for for any reason the the for a
[1:32:41] believer the suffering and the trials
[1:32:43] that we face are always for a purpose
[1:32:45] now if you're sinning then you reap what
[1:32:48] you sow when you're you're really going
[1:32:50] through trials and temptations and these
[1:32:52] things unnecessarily right because the
[1:32:54] word has to happen so what a man souls
[1:32:56] that's what he reaps so if you're out
[1:32:58] there doing things you shouldn't be
[1:32:59] doing you're not suffering righteously
[1:33:02] you're suffering because of your
[1:33:03] decisions but if you are doing
[1:33:05] righteously if you are seeking God if
[1:33:07] your heart is committed to God if you
[1:33:08] have the Holy Spirit then your
[1:33:10] sufferings are always therefore from God
[1:33:13] and he has a purpose and a reason behind
[1:33:15] it so if things are going difficult it's
[1:33:17] because God is trying to do something in
[1:33:19] your life for the true believer and only
[1:33:21] the true believer can say that right
[1:33:23] because that's the only one that he said
[1:33:25] he says if you're if you're not going
[1:33:26] through corrections in these different
[1:33:28] things he says then you're bastards
[1:33:29] right now you have no lineage to me
[1:33:32] there's no relationship there you're
[1:33:34] just somebody that's out out there you
[1:33:36] have no no connection to me right but
[1:33:39] what is it it's - it's to bring us to
[1:33:41] spiritual maturity right so often we're
[1:33:44] looking at these
[1:33:45] and we think well it's about how good I
[1:33:47] act but it's never been about how you
[1:33:49] act and we'll get into that maybe a
[1:33:51] little more tomorrow Lord willing but
[1:33:52] it's about what bringing you to a place
[1:33:54] where you have the character of Christ
[1:33:56] it's not about a spotless sinless walk
[1:33:58] that's why we have the atonement right
[1:34:00] that's all we have the the cross of
[1:34:02] Calvary in the shed blood is to cover
[1:34:03] that you'll never have a sinless
[1:34:05] spotless life in and of your life here
[1:34:07] on earth and the actions that you do
[1:34:09] you're not going to have it and if
[1:34:10] you're looking for it you're gonna be
[1:34:11] doomed to failure and disappointment the
[1:34:13] rest of your life amen brother brother
[1:34:17] Brown continues this in the church age
[1:34:19] book he says as job said he put strength
[1:34:21] in us you see he himself suffered he
[1:34:23] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:34:25] suffered he was actually made perfect by
[1:34:28] the things that he suffered he says
[1:34:31] Hebrews 5:8 2:9 he says though he were a
[1:34:33] son yet learned he obedience by the
[1:34:35] things which he suffered and being made
[1:34:37] perfect he became the author of eternal
[1:34:39] salvation unto them that obey Him he
[1:34:42] says in plain language the very
[1:34:43] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:34:46] suffering and according to Paul he has
[1:34:48] left his church a measure of suffering
[1:34:50] that they too by their faith in God
[1:34:53] while suffering for him will come to a
[1:34:55] place of perfection he says why did he
[1:34:57] want this James 1:2 2:4 says my brother
[1:34:59] encounted all joy when you fall into
[1:35:01] divers temptations knowing this that the
[1:35:03] trying of your faith worketh patience
[1:35:05] but let patience have her partial work
[1:35:10] in complete work he says her perfect
[1:35:14] work patience have her perfect work
[1:35:16] what patience as you're going through
[1:35:18] the trials that ye may be perfect and
[1:35:21] entire wanting nothing so the trial of
[1:35:23] your faith is what brings you to be a
[1:35:25] part of the bride that is perfect and
[1:35:27] entire wanting nothing this is a
[1:35:29] complete bride this is a bride that is
[1:35:31] final she's done she's complete he says
[1:35:34] this is only through the trial of your
[1:35:36] faith they meant so he's talking about
[1:35:38] what the character of Christ and so
[1:35:41] often when we start talking about
[1:35:42] character we think of good morals and
[1:35:44] standing up for what you believe in
[1:35:46] these different things but you can look
[1:35:48] around the world and see a ton of people
[1:35:49] even people that aren't Christians that
[1:35:52] live a life of good moral character that
[1:35:54] have good values right that stand up
[1:35:56] their charitable they aren't mean to
[1:35:58] people
[1:35:58] these different things and brother
[1:36:00] Brahim even said some of them will put
[1:36:01] true believers to shame right so that is
[1:36:04] not just the character that that has to
[1:36:06] be there and we'll cover that a little
[1:36:08] bit here speaking of Jesus Christ
[1:36:10] brother Bram said this he says let's
[1:36:11] watch the type of person he was
[1:36:13] let's look at his character and watch
[1:36:15] his ministry as he worked then he works
[1:36:18] now and as he was then he is now and
[1:36:22] will be forever so he says look at how
[1:36:23] it worked with him it'll work the same
[1:36:25] thing in you and the effects that it had
[1:36:26] in him will be the same effects it has
[1:36:28] in you he says just what he did in them
[1:36:31] days he'll do it today he'll be just the
[1:36:33] same forever he's the same Jesus
[1:36:35] yesterday today and forever the same
[1:36:37] type of character a man that professes
[1:36:39] to be a Christian must have a
[1:36:41] christ-like nature if it isn't there's
[1:36:44] another nature there he says an it isn't
[1:36:46] christ-like gay men so character for a
[1:36:49] Christian means to have a christ-like
[1:36:51] nature not just good morals and good
[1:36:54] beliefs and standing up for things and
[1:36:55] having integrity and whatnot it means
[1:36:57] that we have to be more than just people
[1:36:59] with good attitudes and nice character
[1:37:01] it's to have a christ-like character
[1:37:03] which is a whole different you know
[1:37:05] kettle of fish than just being a good
[1:37:07] person Amen brother branham takes us to
[1:37:10] a way higher level than that when he
[1:37:13] talks about this christ-like nature and
[1:37:14] listen to this quote as he kind of sets
[1:37:17] a the thing of this because he starts to
[1:37:19] take it beyond just your actions now he
[1:37:21] starts to take it back to your nature he
[1:37:23] takes it back to how you think and how
[1:37:25] you approach situations and your
[1:37:27] attitude because sometimes we're so
[1:37:29] stuck on did I do the right thing and
[1:37:31] he's looking beyond it to say did you
[1:37:33] think the right thing what was your
[1:37:35] first inclination had a couple
[1:37:36] situations in the last few weeks where I
[1:37:38] didn't like my inclination my actions
[1:37:40] were perfect if I could put it that way
[1:37:42] I did the right thing but in the back of
[1:37:44] my mind things were gonna hurt right
[1:37:47] let's be honest right
[1:37:49] sometimes we pat ourselves on the back
[1:37:51] because we did the right thing and we're
[1:37:52] sitting there stewing inside and we
[1:37:53] really crucified the person even though
[1:37:55] we treated him right in our head we beat
[1:37:57] him up didn't we
[1:37:58] and brother branham takes us back to
[1:38:00] this and he says this is what we're
[1:38:02] looking for now is in the nature it's a
[1:38:04] nature change that happens when you get
[1:38:06] the Holy Ghost and with that now Dan the
[1:38:09] rest of it comes out the christ-like
[1:38:10] character him
[1:38:11] he says we've got to take the entire
[1:38:13] full gospel we must and now being that
[1:38:16] we have identified ourselves as full
[1:38:18] gospel people let's mold our character
[1:38:20] he says were invited to be molded in His
[1:38:23] image that we might reflect what his
[1:38:25] presence reflect his presence so you've
[1:38:29] got to have what his presence there -
[1:38:31] what reflecting you and bring out what
[1:38:34] Christ would do in that situation right
[1:38:36] you've got you're looking for the
[1:38:37] baptism of the Holy Spirit in your life
[1:38:39] not just a one-time event to say you're
[1:38:41] sealed to the day of your Redemption but
[1:38:43] this is a day by day by day what
[1:38:46] reflection of him right there as you
[1:38:48] think so you will act and he's wanting
[1:38:50] to bring that whole mindset of Christ
[1:38:52] there right so he says in the works that
[1:38:54] I do shall you do also the life that I
[1:38:56] live so shall you he says were invited
[1:38:59] by God to take him as an example and let
[1:39:01] our character be molded like his he says
[1:39:03] what a thing my and then when we let his
[1:39:06] character be in us then we have become
[1:39:08] sons by having the mind of Christ so
[1:39:12] we've gone from the trial of your faith
[1:39:14] be more precious than gold to having
[1:39:16] character to having a christ-like nature
[1:39:20] which is character and now he's taking
[1:39:22] that all the way down and saying well
[1:39:23] that's the mind of Christ he says by
[1:39:26] having the mind of Christ he says mind
[1:39:27] which is his character your mind makes
[1:39:30] your character let the mind Paul said of
[1:39:32] Christ that mind that was in Christ
[1:39:34] being you let that mind of Christ be in
[1:39:36] you it molds the character of a son of
[1:39:39] God so now we're going from you look
[1:39:43] good on the outside to going all the way
[1:39:44] down to the deepest depths of your soul
[1:39:46] to where the very intentions and purpose
[1:39:49] of God are now flowing back out through
[1:39:51] you and that's what's driving your life
[1:39:54] so if that's what our trial is them what
[1:39:57] is the trial the trial is - what have
[1:39:59] the mind of Christ and submit yourself
[1:40:01] to it so that the whole chain from there
[1:40:03] is Christ from the inside out amen
[1:40:05] not just the right actions because so
[1:40:07] often like I said we pat ourselves on
[1:40:09] the back because we did the right thing
[1:40:10] but our attitude internally was
[1:40:12] completely wrong amen
[1:40:14] how does that look well if he said that
[1:40:17] what Christ did is what we should do
[1:40:19] then we should be able to go and find
[1:40:21] that example with Christ and I won't
[1:40:24] have you turn to it just for the same
[1:40:25] of time this evening but it's when he's
[1:40:26] in the garden of gethsemane Matthew 26
[1:40:29] verse 38 it says then saith he unto them
[1:40:31] to his disciples my soul is exceeding
[1:40:34] sorrowful even unto death Terry you here
[1:40:36] and watch this so Jesus has already been
[1:40:38] through all of these things he's now
[1:40:40] there he knows his time is coming up and
[1:40:42] he's already worn out he's already tired
[1:40:45] he's you know his Bloods pumping and all
[1:40:47] this he knows something bad is coming
[1:40:49] his way and he knows it's gonna be tough
[1:40:51] he knows I mean this is this is God in
[1:40:54] flesh he knows what's coming right he
[1:40:57] says and he went a little further and
[1:40:59] fell on his face and prayed saying O my
[1:41:01] father if it be possible let this cup
[1:41:03] pass from me nevertheless not as I will
[1:41:05] but as thou will so he's saying I don't
[1:41:08] want to do this my Christ is saying I
[1:41:10] don't want to do this I don't want to go
[1:41:12] to the whipping post I don't want to be
[1:41:13] punched they don't want to be spit on I
[1:41:14] don't want to have the thorns driven
[1:41:16] into me I definitely don't want to be
[1:41:17] crucified and I'd really not die if it's
[1:41:19] okay with you right this is not a fun
[1:41:22] three days he's gonna have in front of
[1:41:23] him
[1:41:23] and he's saying can you take it away
[1:41:26] there's nothing wrong with asking God to
[1:41:28] take things away but watch what Jesus
[1:41:31] does he says any when a game away again
[1:41:34] the second time verse 42 and prayed
[1:41:37] saying O my father if this cup may not
[1:41:39] pass away for me except I drink it thy
[1:41:42] will be done so he goes from saying can
[1:41:44] I please not go through this - what he
[1:41:47] says I'll drink it you haven't told me I
[1:41:51] can't get it you know I can't get away
[1:41:53] with this so I've got to do it so he
[1:41:54] says okay I'll drink it so he goes now
[1:41:56] from asking do I not have to go through
[1:41:57] it to say I'm willing
[1:41:59] there's no grudging this here right
[1:42:02] he knows it's gonna be tough but he says
[1:42:04] what if that's your will then I'll do it
[1:42:06] and he's not fighting it anymore it says
[1:42:09] and he left them verse 44 and went away
[1:42:11] again and prayed the third time saying
[1:42:13] the same word so he goes back and he
[1:42:15] says father I'm willing to drink the cup
[1:42:17] I'll drink the cup right so he goes in
[1:42:20] there and then he comes to his disciples
[1:42:22] and says unto them sleep on now and take
[1:42:23] your rest behold the hours at hand the
[1:42:25] Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of
[1:42:27] sinners so he goes all the way from
[1:42:29] saying I don't want to do it - willful
[1:42:32] and ungrudgingly insan' he steps right
[1:42:34] into the perfect will of God
[1:42:35] right that's the mind of Christ when you
[1:42:39] see it in front of you you're allowed to
[1:42:41] say can we do this a different way but
[1:42:43] there's gonna be some time where he says
[1:42:45] sorry because why it's his chosen way to
[1:42:47] bring out his character in you
[1:42:49] it's his chosen way to manifest Christ
[1:42:51] in you so if you keep asking to not go
[1:42:53] through it then what are you gonna have
[1:42:55] you're gonna have a stunted growth
[1:42:56] you're gonna be a weak Christian because
[1:42:58] you've got nothing of him in you he
[1:43:00] doesn't just drop it in like this it's
[1:43:01] the way he channels things is through
[1:43:03] the molding of temptation and trials
[1:43:05] amen so therefore what is the character
[1:43:08] of mind of Christ if that's what ours is
[1:43:10] supposed to be if we're supposed to have
[1:43:12] the mind of Christ it's to do what is to
[1:43:14] seek the will and purpose of God in
[1:43:15] every situation no matter how hard it is
[1:43:19] no matter how difficult it is no matter
[1:43:20] what we have to give up no matter who
[1:43:22] we're going to offend what is it Lord
[1:43:26] what is your will and if that's your
[1:43:28] will I'll drink the cup each and every
[1:43:31] time amen
[1:43:32] the Bram says this and the message
[1:43:34] identification he says we want to make
[1:43:36] this Bible our looking-glass and let
[1:43:38] ourselves be molded by his character
[1:43:40] having his character his mind letting
[1:43:43] the mind that was in Christ being us
[1:43:44] what was his mind to do the mind that
[1:43:46] was in Christ he says always to stay
[1:43:49] with the father's word I meant so we've
[1:43:52] been given a word and you're not gonna
[1:43:54] cross this you can never cross this and
[1:43:56] say you're in the will of God you can't
[1:43:58] do it there's no exceptions there's no
[1:44:00] you know it's not like the Catholic
[1:44:01] Church where they give you an indulgence
[1:44:03] God doesn't give indulgences right there
[1:44:05] was a time to wink at ignorance this is
[1:44:07] not that time
[1:44:08] amen so if it's in here then that's the
[1:44:11] will of God and you can't go around it
[1:44:12] but not all of us have to go through
[1:44:14] certain things not all of us have to go
[1:44:15] through maybe a particular marriage
[1:44:17] problem or a health problem or an
[1:44:19] employment problem or all these things
[1:44:21] we look around and you have friends that
[1:44:22] are and families in the churches and
[1:44:24] ones going through this and the other
[1:44:25] ones going through that it's up to God
[1:44:27] to choose those things and bring you
[1:44:28] into those those areas of your life that
[1:44:30] he feels need refining but we don't all
[1:44:32] go through it but if it's here you don't
[1:44:35] get to go around it if he calls you to
[1:44:37] walk through it right you don't get to
[1:44:38] go against this to excuse yourself from
[1:44:40] the will and plan of God amen amen so it
[1:44:45] brings us now to what the character of
[1:44:48] the character that we're supposed to
[1:44:50] have is the mind of Christ which is
[1:44:52] always to see
[1:44:53] the will and purpose of God and it's
[1:44:56] going to happen through trials okay so
[1:44:58] we've set that foundation but then we've
[1:45:01] got to step in to the other side of it
[1:45:02] which is again two very familiar
[1:45:04] scriptures Psalms 37 23 says the steps
[1:45:07] of a good man now that doesn't mean man
[1:45:09] that means person so the sisters are
[1:45:11] included in this the steps of a good
[1:45:12] sister a woman are allowed as well steps
[1:45:15] of a good man are ordered by the Lord
[1:45:16] and he delighteth in his way
[1:45:18] now doesn't say the steps of a good man
[1:45:20] are ordered by the Lord and he
[1:45:21] understands everything that's going on
[1:45:22] or that he knows that it's the will of
[1:45:24] God and that he's got a revelation that
[1:45:26] it's the will of God no no it just says
[1:45:28] they're ordered of the Lord doesn't say
[1:45:30] you're going to understand it every time
[1:45:32] sometimes we think that God owes us an
[1:45:34] explanation so it's got joven the
[1:45:36] trouble wasn't it job thought that he
[1:45:38] was owed an explanation and he didn't
[1:45:40] get it until what he humbled himself
[1:45:42] before God amen and then again Romans
[1:45:45] 8:28 we can quote this by by rote it
[1:45:47] says and we know that all things work
[1:45:49] together for good all things for who to
[1:45:54] them that love God and to them who are
[1:45:56] the called according to his purpose
[1:45:59] so the footsteps of a righteous person
[1:46:01] or order of the Lord and all things are
[1:46:03] for our good if you are a child of God
[1:46:05] then what are we worried about right why
[1:46:08] are we sitting here saying why is this
[1:46:10] happening to me why am I having to go
[1:46:12] through this and why are we fighting
[1:46:13] this for so long and why am I going
[1:46:15] through this trial and why are things so
[1:46:16] difficult in this area in that area who
[1:46:19] cares
[1:46:20] but that's something that's easy to say
[1:46:23] up here right that's easy for the
[1:46:25] preacher to say it in a service and it's
[1:46:26] easy for us to say Amen in the service
[1:46:28] but when Monday hits and you're having
[1:46:30] to go through it again it's not so easy
[1:46:32] to say who cares right because you're in
[1:46:36] the thick of it you're in the thick of
[1:46:38] it and you're fighting and your flesh is
[1:46:39] fighting in these different things right
[1:46:41] so you've got to go through these things
[1:46:42] and the mindset now has to be in you the
[1:46:45] mind of Christ where you're seeking Lord
[1:46:47] not just get me out of this but what are
[1:46:49] you trying to get me to learn here what
[1:46:50] are you trying to put into me and we
[1:46:53] start seeking the purpose of God in the
[1:46:54] trial as opposed to the relief of God in
[1:46:56] the trial and then there's a song that
[1:46:58] says sometimes he calms a storm and
[1:47:00] other time he caught other times he
[1:47:02] calms his child so often we're looking
[1:47:05] for him to calm the storm
[1:47:06] but what's a greater miracle that he
[1:47:09] comes a storm or that he lets you go
[1:47:10] through the storm without fear in your
[1:47:12] heart right where that you can go
[1:47:13] through the storm and have rest and be
[1:47:15] completely satisfied that God does all
[1:47:17] things well amen like I said sometimes
[1:47:20] the trials are to show you what you
[1:47:22] don't have and sometimes the trials are
[1:47:24] to show you what you do have I remember
[1:47:26] when I first moved to Edmonton I've been
[1:47:27] in a bad car wreck and oh-6 and I hadn't
[1:47:29] worked out for quite some time so we
[1:47:31] paid a bunch of money to a trainer to
[1:47:33] kind of get me built back up again and
[1:47:34] make sure I didn't hurt myself and
[1:47:35] trainers push you hard that's what
[1:47:38] they're paid to do their trade to put
[1:47:39] there they're paid to push you harder
[1:47:41] than you would ever push yourself and he
[1:47:43] put weights down sometimes and I would
[1:47:44] think there's no way I can do that and
[1:47:46] sometimes I couldn't do it but I found
[1:47:48] as I trained more and more and more the
[1:47:50] trainer knew more than I did how much I
[1:47:52] was capable of pushing or pressing and
[1:47:54] he put weight down and I'd say I
[1:47:55] couldn't do it I didn't think I could do
[1:47:57] it once and I'd do it seven times why
[1:48:00] because he had seen the growth of me he
[1:48:02] had seen the strength going up in me but
[1:48:04] because I'm looking in the mirror every
[1:48:05] day I don't see it the way that he does
[1:48:07] right but he knows he should be at this
[1:48:09] level if he's been working out with me
[1:48:11] for three months he should be up 30% 40%
[1:48:13] so let's put 40% more on the bar and see
[1:48:16] what he does and all of a sudden the bar
[1:48:17] moves that's what God is doing sometimes
[1:48:19] is you don't realize what he's been
[1:48:20] doing all this time and then all of a
[1:48:22] sudden he puts a big weight in front of
[1:48:24] you and you kind of just go and it moves
[1:48:28] out of your way why because he's put you
[1:48:30] through something you've got the
[1:48:31] strength you've got the faith you have
[1:48:32] the character now and you cruise right
[1:48:34] through that trial as if it was nothing
[1:48:35] and that just means you're ready for the
[1:48:38] next one
[1:48:38] right yeah all right this is not going
[1:48:41] to be an encouraging sermon tonight but
[1:48:45] that's what it is is sometimes you need
[1:48:46] the trainer there to put a pad something
[1:48:49] in your path and you couldn't beat
[1:48:50] before and then you go right through it
[1:48:52] because God's been doing a work in your
[1:48:53] life sometimes I think that's one of the
[1:48:55] greatest values of having good friends
[1:48:57] and good fellowship is that people will
[1:48:59] let you know when they see a change in
[1:49:01] you because they'll see it because
[1:49:02] they're not looking at you every day
[1:49:03] they'll see it over weeks or you go see
[1:49:05] somebody after your year they say my how
[1:49:07] you've changed right what is it they can
[1:49:11] give you that feedback they can say
[1:49:12] you're growing you don't realize it but
[1:49:13] look at where you wet look at the way
[1:49:15] you talk look at the way you act
[1:49:16] remember you used to talk to me about
[1:49:18] this all the time and now you don't what
[1:49:20] happen I don't know sometimes we're
[1:49:23] looking for this and it's gone and God
[1:49:28] will take it away over six months and
[1:49:29] you don't even realize you've lost it
[1:49:31] until it comes across your path and
[1:49:33] you're like I don't even want to do that
[1:49:34] anymore I don't even like that anymore
[1:49:36] somebody comes across that used to just
[1:49:38] drive you nuts and you've all of a
[1:49:39] sudden got grace for them where'd that
[1:49:41] come from
[1:49:41] most times it's not a moment right it's
[1:49:44] over time he's building you up right
[1:49:46] he's shaping you he's molding you you
[1:49:48] always talk about the the sculptors and
[1:49:49] these different things they don't just
[1:49:51] you know but it done it's slow and easy
[1:49:54] right sometimes there's big chunks and
[1:49:55] then as they get down there's more
[1:49:56] refining and whatnot amen
[1:50:00] we've set the foundation we're gonna
[1:50:02] take two different two different people
[1:50:05] or groups here to kind of build this
[1:50:07] into us a little bit so turn the first
[1:50:08] Samuel Chapter one if you would for
[1:50:10] Samuel Chapter one we're gonna talk
[1:50:12] about Hannah for a little bit because
[1:50:17] when we look at at these trials of our
[1:50:20] faith so often again we're looking at
[1:50:22] the end result the character of Christ
[1:50:24] and these different things but we
[1:50:25] actually end up missing what's going on
[1:50:27] in the middle there and Hannah's a great
[1:50:29] example of kind of the the impact that
[1:50:32] it has on your relationship with God as
[1:50:33] you're going through these things so
[1:50:36] First Samuel Chapter one let me know
[1:50:39] when you're there okay we're good First
[1:50:42] Samuel Chapter one says now there was a
[1:50:43] certain man of a place I can't pronounce
[1:50:45] mount ephraim and his name was al cana
[1:50:48] the son of jerome the son of allah who
[1:50:49] the son of Tohu the son is if an F
[1:50:52] recite and he had two wives in the name
[1:50:54] of one was Hanna in the name of the
[1:50:55] other was pnina and pnina had children
[1:50:58] but hannah had no children and this man
[1:51:01] went out of his City yearly to worship
[1:51:04] so they went to special services every
[1:51:05] year you could say two and two
[1:51:07] sacrificed unto the Lord of hosts and
[1:51:09] Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hophni
[1:51:11] and Phinehas the priests of the Lord
[1:51:14] were there and when the time was that al
[1:51:16] cana offered he gave to pnina his wife
[1:51:18] and to all her sons and her daughters
[1:51:20] portions but unto hannah he gave a
[1:51:22] worthy portion he gave a greater portion
[1:51:24] to her for he loved hannah but listen to
[1:51:27] this
[1:51:28] but the lord had shut up her womb so
[1:51:32] hannah is the favored wife
[1:51:35] so for the sake of the children here a
[1:51:37] favorite wife is going to see her
[1:51:39] husband more gonna spend more time with
[1:51:41] her husband the chances of a pregnancy
[1:51:43] are much higher with a favored wife and
[1:51:44] yet she's not producing any children and
[1:51:47] then we see that the Lord had shut up
[1:51:49] her womb what had Hannah done why is her
[1:51:55] womb shut up had Hannah sinned was there
[1:51:59] something in her background that was
[1:52:00] keeping her from this was the Lord
[1:52:02] withholding a promise because it was a
[1:52:04] promise to Abram seed right he said he'd
[1:52:05] make a great nation and he said what the
[1:52:07] proof of that was in the the ones the
[1:52:10] wombs of the women producing so many
[1:52:11] children that was a huge blessing and it
[1:52:14] was a sign of spiritual favor in those
[1:52:15] days of God's blessing was to have
[1:52:17] children if you didn't have children
[1:52:18] there was a reproach and Hannah has done
[1:52:20] nothing and yet she's under reproach she
[1:52:25] doesn't deserve this
[1:52:26] right there's nothing here that would
[1:52:29] suggest that Hannah was in any way wrong
[1:52:30] and yet the Lord it says the Lord had
[1:52:34] shut up her womb amen and then we see
[1:52:37] the next scripture there in verse 6 it
[1:52:39] says and her adversary her wife or her
[1:52:41] the other wife also provoked her sore
[1:52:43] for to make her fret because the Lord
[1:52:46] had shut up her womb
[1:52:47] amen isn't that just like Satan to make
[1:52:50] you fret when you're not exhibiting what
[1:52:53] somebody else in the congregation has
[1:52:54] all whether it's a gift right whether
[1:52:57] it's a certain personality trait whether
[1:52:59] it's a character trait what is it you
[1:53:01] look at them and say why don't I have
[1:53:02] that we do it right we get jealous and
[1:53:06] then you get one that's maybe needs a
[1:53:09] little growth in that area maybe they
[1:53:10] they rub it in your face a little bit
[1:53:11] siblings are great at this right
[1:53:13] siblings you ever have a sibling that
[1:53:16] just rubs your face into something that
[1:53:18] they have all right amen Paul it's true
[1:53:23] though isn't it sometimes the ones
[1:53:24] closest to you are the ones that cause
[1:53:25] you to fret the most amen well what is
[1:53:28] it that is not the Holy Ghost doing that
[1:53:30] I can tell you that for sure it's the
[1:53:31] oppressor says her adversary is the one
[1:53:34] that caused her to Fredi men there was
[1:53:36] work that had to happen on both their
[1:53:37] sides but what's she trying to do she's
[1:53:39] trying to get her off the idea that
[1:53:40] there is a promise for what children to
[1:53:43] a seed of Abraham and so year after year
[1:53:46] as she went up to the house of the Lord
[1:53:48] you provoked her so every time there's
[1:53:50] special meetings the other wife is
[1:53:53] poking at her so every time the visiting
[1:53:56] minister comes in they're poking at her
[1:53:58] ah you still don't have the promise you
[1:54:00] still don't have the promise you still
[1:54:01] don't have the promise you still don't
[1:54:02] have children yeah he loves you but I'm
[1:54:04] the one that's blessed God favors me
[1:54:06] every time she goes to church special
[1:54:09] services the devil's poking her amen
[1:54:12] it says and therefore she wept and did
[1:54:15] not eat so it's physically taking a toll
[1:54:17] on Hanna and this is year after year
[1:54:20] after year in a time when she should
[1:54:22] have been the most spiritually blessed
[1:54:24] there should have been joy we're going
[1:54:25] to the house of the Lord we're
[1:54:26] sacrificing everything's gonna be under
[1:54:28] the blood this is when they should be
[1:54:29] rejoicing and all hannah has his
[1:54:31] reproach there's a stigma over her life
[1:54:34] and she doesn't understand Church is a
[1:54:36] time of bitterness for Hannah can you
[1:54:39] imagine every year special services and
[1:54:42] you don't look forward to it because
[1:54:43] that's the worst time of the year rather
[1:54:44] than the best time of the year that's
[1:54:46] how bad it was and then Elkanah her
[1:54:48] husband typical man says Hannah why
[1:54:50] weepest thou and why eat us now not and
[1:54:52] why is thy heart grieved am I not better
[1:54:54] to thee than 10 sons right I'm a good
[1:54:57] husband why are you looking for other
[1:54:59] boys I'm the man you know I should be
[1:55:02] enough for you right and that's not
[1:55:05] enough cuz Hannah's looking at what she
[1:55:06] says no the fruit of our relationship is
[1:55:08] a child we need to have a child this is
[1:55:10] a proof of our relationship and it's a
[1:55:12] proof of God's blessing in her side of
[1:55:13] things amen
[1:55:15] so verse 9 Hannah rose up after they'd
[1:55:17] eaten and Shiloh and after they had
[1:55:18] drunk now Eli the priest set upon a seat
[1:55:21] by the post of the temple of the Lord
[1:55:22] and she was in bitterness of soul and
[1:55:25] prayed unto the Lord and wept wept sore
[1:55:28] Hannah's not in a good place here and
[1:55:30] it's of no it's it's of no fault of hers
[1:55:34] but she's in bitterness why because
[1:55:36] she's looking at this she's saying I
[1:55:37] want I want I want what God has offered
[1:55:39] what God has promised that's for me and
[1:55:42] I'm sick and tired of him not giving me
[1:55:44] what he promised he would give me right
[1:55:46] again she'd done nothing to deserve this
[1:55:50] but watch what happens it says and she
[1:55:52] vowed a vow and said O Lord of Hosts if
[1:55:55] thou wilt indeed look on the affliction
[1:55:57] of thine handmaid and remember me and
[1:55:58] forget not thine handmaid
[1:56:00] but we'll give unto thine handmaid a
[1:56:03] man-child then I will give him unto the
[1:56:06] Lord all the days of his life and there
[1:56:08] shall no razor come upon his head
[1:56:09] so hand is in this trial and all of a
[1:56:12] sudden what does she do she's praying
[1:56:13] more and more and more and more and what
[1:56:17] happens is she taps into God's purpose
[1:56:20] for this whole thing and this may have
[1:56:22] been decades we don't know how old
[1:56:23] Hannah was brother Graham says she was
[1:56:25] maybe 40 50 60 okay but guessing she
[1:56:28] married maybe around 20 ish or so that's
[1:56:30] at least 20 years of barrenness 30 years
[1:56:33] of barrenness 40 years of bareness and
[1:56:35] all of the sudden she says the right
[1:56:37] thing because what God needs a prophet
[1:56:40] on the scene the ministry has been
[1:56:41] tainted right Eli's not keeping his sons
[1:56:44] in there they're sleeping with women in
[1:56:46] the in the in the tabernacle they're
[1:56:48] taking more than they were promised
[1:56:50] right they don't want the the flesh has
[1:56:51] dipped in the water they wanted it baked
[1:56:53] and all these things they were
[1:56:54] completely transgressing the law of God
[1:56:55] and that the ministry was filthy and he
[1:56:58] needed to clean it out he had to do a
[1:57:00] clean sweep and he said I'm gonna bring
[1:57:01] in a prophet but he wanted a willing
[1:57:04] vessel to do it because nobody's just
[1:57:06] going to give their child away because
[1:57:07] Samuel now has to go through a process
[1:57:08] to see what that ministry is like and
[1:57:11] then God's gonna call him and move him
[1:57:13] forward amen but he's looking for
[1:57:15] someone that will give him a child and
[1:57:16] so after 20 30 40 years Hannah finally
[1:57:19] says the right thing but it's taken her
[1:57:21] years and years and years of prayer and
[1:57:23] she's developed a prayer life and in
[1:57:26] that bitterness now she says the right
[1:57:27] thing and says look just take away my
[1:57:29] reproach and I'll give it back to you
[1:57:31] the blessing that takes away my reproach
[1:57:33] will be given right back to God
[1:57:34] completely right
[1:57:38] moving on to the next scripture but the
[1:57:42] bram says this before we do that Hannah
[1:57:45] does what she says God I'm gonna give it
[1:57:48] back to you I'm gonna give the blessing
[1:57:49] back to you I'm gonna give the glory
[1:57:51] back to you I'm gonna lose my reproach
[1:57:54] but everything else that you give me I'm
[1:57:55] just gonna give it right back to you
[1:57:56] right so she's surrendering now insane I
[1:57:59] need something out of this but
[1:58:00] everything else it's yours right brother
[1:58:04] Bram said this and victory day said and
[1:58:05] each one of us is born for something we
[1:58:07] weren't just put here for nothing
[1:58:09] everything is for his purpose it's got
[1:58:11] to serve and we are here for a purpose
[1:58:12] in Hannah what she found her
[1:58:15] that was to bring forth a profit that
[1:58:18] was all that Hanna was put on the earth
[1:58:19] to do was to bring forth a profit and as
[1:58:22] soon as she found that everything starts
[1:58:24] to move into into its place verse 12 it
[1:58:26] says and it came to pass as she
[1:58:28] continued praying before the Lord that
[1:58:30] Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she
[1:58:32] spake in her heart you know the
[1:58:33] scripture talks about the Spirit is
[1:58:35] within us giving it with groanings that
[1:58:37] cannot be uttered I believe that's the
[1:58:38] place that Hannah came to well she was
[1:58:40] so burdened in her spirit she couldn't
[1:58:42] even talk about it out loud anymore but
[1:58:44] it was just coming out of her and it
[1:58:46] says her lips moved but her voice was
[1:58:48] not heard therefore Eli thought she had
[1:58:50] been drunken right this is so affected
[1:58:53] her now she can't even talk about it but
[1:58:55] she's just sitting there and it's just
[1:58:57] it's just inside of her she can't even
[1:58:59] express it and he'll I said to her how
[1:59:01] long wilt thou be drunken drunken put
[1:59:03] away thy wine from thee and Hannah
[1:59:06] answered and said no my lord but I'm a
[1:59:07] woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk
[1:59:10] neither wine nor strong drink but have
[1:59:12] poured out my soul before the Lord so
[1:59:14] Hannah's come to a place where she is so
[1:59:16] dedicated to this this purpose to this
[1:59:19] need she says I'm not doing anything
[1:59:21] except coming to the Lord I'm fully
[1:59:24] committed to getting him to answer my
[1:59:26] prayer a many and she says so count out
[1:59:29] that handmaid for a daughter Belial she
[1:59:30] says don't think I'm one of those loose
[1:59:32] women that your sons are sleeping with
[1:59:33] it was a rebuke to Eli almost you know I
[1:59:36] know what's going on in here but don't
[1:59:38] think I'm one of them
[1:59:39] I'm not one of them she says for out of
[1:59:41] the abundance of my complaint and grief
[1:59:43] have I spoken hitherto daniil I answered
[1:59:46] and said go in peace and the God of
[1:59:48] Israel grant thee thy petition that thou
[1:59:50] has asked of him Eli doesn't know what
[1:59:51] she asked but he says God give it to you
[1:59:54] right he's rebuked and he says no God
[1:59:56] God give it to you she said and so she
[1:59:58] said let thine hand meant by grace in
[2:00:00] thy sight so the woman went her way and
[2:00:03] did eat and her countenance was no more
[2:00:06] sad amen she's found the mind of God
[2:00:09] let's read verse 19 before we continue
[2:00:11] and they rose up in the early morning
[2:00:12] and worship before the Lord and returned
[2:00:15] and came to their house to Rama and
[2:00:16] elkanah knew Hannah his wife and the
[2:00:19] Lord remembered her but look at Hannah's
[2:00:21] change in verse 18 it says she went her
[2:00:24] way she ate and she was no more sad what
[2:00:26] is it she'd gotten the promise
[2:00:28] that she was going to be blessed she
[2:00:30] took that minister that priest at his
[2:00:32] word when he said the Lord looked kindly
[2:00:34] upon thee and she says that's it I'm
[2:00:36] taking what he said that's for me amen
[2:00:40] for the RAM said this in the
[2:00:41] resurrection of Lazarus nineteen fifty
[2:00:43] said she went up with something in her
[2:00:44] heart she wanted to talk to God and she
[2:00:47] prayed in such deep sincerity till the
[2:00:49] priest misunderstood her like today
[2:00:51] sometimes were called finatus because we
[2:00:53] pray and cry out to God people don't
[2:00:56] understand what it is when we're in a
[2:00:58] service and our hands are up and we're
[2:00:59] shouting or our heads down and we're
[2:01:01] crying out to God they don't understand
[2:01:03] what that is but what is the Holy Spirit
[2:01:05] in us trying to draw out something that
[2:01:07] God has planned for us amen he says
[2:01:09] we're not fanatics were misunderstood
[2:01:11] that's all he thought she was drunk
[2:01:12] listen to what he says they did the same
[2:01:15] thing on Pentecost they do the same
[2:01:17] today when the Holy Spirit is moving
[2:01:19] when the Spirit of God is moving on the
[2:01:20] people people think you're crazy
[2:01:22] right you don't act normal under the
[2:01:25] influence of the Spirit he says he takes
[2:01:27] it back to Pentecost he ties what she
[2:01:29] did there to the new birth he says she
[2:01:32] said she was not drunk but she was
[2:01:34] praying God to take away her reproach he
[2:01:37] blessed her and as soon as she received
[2:01:39] the blessing from the priest he said
[2:01:42] notice she didn't wait now God could
[2:01:44] have put the baby in her arms right then
[2:01:46] but she went home happy knowing that in
[2:01:49] due season God would bring it to pass
[2:01:51] amen so she's there and she takes that
[2:01:54] promise and she says it's as good as
[2:01:55] mine it's like brother Brown talked
[2:01:57] about you know when you could buy bread
[2:01:58] for a quarter whatever he says if I've
[2:02:00] got court the quarter I can praise God
[2:02:02] for the bread because I know I've got
[2:02:03] what's required to get the bread so as
[2:02:05] long as there's bread in the store I'm
[2:02:06] gonna have bread tonight amen he says
[2:02:08] that's the kind of people we need today
[2:02:10] taking God at His Word all she did was
[2:02:13] say man she took what the minister said
[2:02:15] and said that's for me I've got the
[2:02:17] blessing I'm gonna have a baby and she
[2:02:19] praised God before she ever had the
[2:02:21] blessing and then but what he says she
[2:02:24] understood that in due season God would
[2:02:26] bring it to pass so there's a time and
[2:02:28] there's a season for every single thing
[2:02:30] that's going to happen in our life and
[2:02:31] you can say all day long the promises in
[2:02:33] the word the promises in the word the
[2:02:35] promises in the word but it's up to God
[2:02:37] to decide when that promise is going to
[2:02:39] be fulfilled in your life
[2:02:40] and everything in your life whether it's
[2:02:42] in your marriage in your job in your
[2:02:44] church ministries all of these things it
[2:02:46] is in God's time in God's time alone and
[2:02:48] you've got to be able to rest and say he
[2:02:50] does all things well they men and then
[2:02:55] talks about embracing it
[2:02:56] that's what Sarah Abraham answered it
[2:02:58] says they embraced the promise they held
[2:03:00] on to it that was their comfort was that
[2:03:02] promise even after 24 years before the
[2:03:05] he came and visited them individually
[2:03:07] amen
[2:03:08] Hannah's brother Branham says faith
[2:03:10] cometh by hearing you said Hammond said
[2:03:12] looky here if Sarah be nearly a hundred
[2:03:14] could receive seed he says Hannah was
[2:03:16] probably around oh maybe 40 50 60
[2:03:18] somewhere along in there she said so can
[2:03:20] I so if you can look in the scripture
[2:03:22] and find the same situation for somebody
[2:03:24] else there's no reason you can't go in
[2:03:26] there and say that's for me as well
[2:03:27] that's what he's saying here don't just
[2:03:29] look at it about having children we
[2:03:31] don't seem to have a problem with
[2:03:32] children in this church but maybe
[2:03:34] there's something else that's that were
[2:03:35] we feel is missing or lacking and we're
[2:03:37] saying but the promise is there for this
[2:03:39] he says don't worry about that if
[2:03:42] somebody else got it you'll get it too
[2:03:44] and maybe it takes 25 years and maybe it
[2:03:46] takes 25 seconds but it's up to God to
[2:03:49] determine those two things right he says
[2:03:51] so faith cometh by hearing then he or
[2:03:53] she goes to the temple she's going up
[2:03:55] there to worship God she didn't pay any
[2:03:57] attention to what anyone else said some
[2:03:59] of them was going along talking about
[2:04:00] this that or the other she said she went
[2:04:02] for one alternative that was to get her
[2:04:04] prayer answered if that's the way you're
[2:04:07] here tonight you're going right back
[2:04:09] with the same kind of blessing that
[2:04:10] Hannah's had with thus saith the Lord
[2:04:13] Eli didn't say thus saith the Lord the
[2:04:16] minister spoke and she took it and said
[2:04:18] that's good enough for me
[2:04:19] that was thus saith the Lord was she
[2:04:20] felt that that minister was anointed
[2:04:22] that he had spoken from the Lord she
[2:04:24] said that's mine that's it's that simple
[2:04:26] that's mine and she went home
[2:04:28] and she was happy and joyful without
[2:04:30] having received the blessing yet but she
[2:04:32] praised as if she had already done it
[2:04:33] but we see what happens in Hannah's life
[2:04:36] the next chapter Samuel 1st Samuel
[2:04:38] chapter 2 it says because remember she
[2:04:42] gives him away she gives away her
[2:04:46] blessing now most of us would be
[2:04:47] heartbroken at that and she'd only get
[2:04:49] to see him once a year and she brings
[2:04:50] him a new coat every time right so after
[2:04:53] a few years she has no blessed
[2:04:54] but look at Hannah's response now so
[2:04:57] look at the change that this trial is
[2:04:58] brought through her for maybe twenty
[2:05:00] thirty forty years of bitterness look
[2:05:02] what it's brought in Hanna and first
[2:05:03] time into verse 2 it says and Hannah
[2:05:06] prayed and said my heart rejoices in the
[2:05:09] Lord
[2:05:09] mine horn is exalted in the Lord my
[2:05:12] mouth is enlarged over mine enemies
[2:05:13] she's speaking of that adversarial other
[2:05:16] wife she says I
[2:05:17] she can't shut me down now I can talk
[2:05:20] about the blessings of Lord and she
[2:05:21] can't shut me down because I have what
[2:05:23] he promised now they can't drown me out
[2:05:25] anymore I can testify of what he's done
[2:05:28] Amen why she says because I rejoice in
[2:05:31] thy salvation there is none holy as the
[2:05:34] Lord there is none beside thee neither
[2:05:36] is there any rock like our God amen
[2:05:39] she's had an experience in this trial
[2:05:41] and she doesn't nothing matters anymore
[2:05:43] she's just sitting there and she's just
[2:05:44] praising God over and over after twenty
[2:05:47] thirty forty years of bitterness Hannah
[2:05:49] is praising she's lost her son she's
[2:05:51] giving him back to the Lord and she's
[2:05:53] sitting there and she can't stop
[2:05:54] praising she says talk no more and
[2:05:56] exceedingly proudly let not Erickson see
[2:05:58] come out of your mouth she's not just
[2:06:00] talking to that lady heard that other
[2:06:02] wife right she's saying don't tell god
[2:06:05] what to do
[2:06:06] you hold on to the promise and let him
[2:06:08] bring it to pass and his time in his way
[2:06:10] see sometimes our arrogance is not that
[2:06:12] we're claiming the promise poorly it's
[2:06:14] that we're saying Lord here's the
[2:06:15] promise and here's how you have to do it
[2:06:17] right
[2:06:18] I want this in my life I want this in
[2:06:20] the church I want this in my marriage
[2:06:21] and we're sitting there we're telling
[2:06:23] him what to do and how to do it that's
[2:06:25] not up to us to do we say here's the
[2:06:26] promise I believe and then how he brings
[2:06:30] it is up to him that's what she's saying
[2:06:32] let not arrogance II come out of your
[2:06:34] mouth
[2:06:34] I'm not gonna tell him and you can't
[2:06:36] tell him either right and you can put me
[2:06:38] down because he hasn't given it that's
[2:06:40] what she's saying right trust him to
[2:06:42] meet your need and I don't care what you
[2:06:44] say about me now cuz he's already met it
[2:06:45] he says for the Lord she said for the
[2:06:48] Lord is a God of knowledge and by him
[2:06:49] all actions are weighed the boughs of
[2:06:51] the mighty men are broken and they that
[2:06:53] stumbled are girded with strength all of
[2:06:55] a sudden those that were you know the
[2:06:57] other the other wife was talking so much
[2:06:59] in that and she says hey you've got
[2:07:00] nothing now you got nothing on me I'm
[2:07:02] the favored wife and I have the child
[2:07:04] what are you gonna come against me with
[2:07:05] and we'll see that she gets blessed even
[2:07:07] more beyond the
[2:07:08] and they that stumbled are girded with
[2:07:10] strength I didn't have anything and now
[2:07:11] I have more I have more than enough to
[2:07:14] meet the need a men and they that were
[2:07:16] full have hired themselves out for bread
[2:07:18] the ones that had all the money now they
[2:07:19] could have to work just to eat and they
[2:07:22] that were hungry ceased so that the
[2:07:23] Baron had borne seven and she that had
[2:07:26] many children as wax feeble the Lord
[2:07:28] killeth and maketh alive he bring it
[2:07:30] down to the grave and he bringeth up the
[2:07:32] Lord and he raiseth up the poor or Lord
[2:07:35] maketh poor and maketh rich he bring it
[2:07:37] low and lifteth up she says up and down
[2:07:39] in or out east or west doesn't matter
[2:07:42] it's all the Lord no matter the
[2:07:44] situation no matter what's going on in
[2:07:46] my life it's all the Lord he raiseth up
[2:07:48] the poor out of the dust and lifteth up
[2:07:50] the beggar from the dunghill to set them
[2:07:52] among princes and to make them inherit
[2:07:54] the throne of glory for The Pillars of
[2:07:55] the Earth are the lords and he has set
[2:07:57] the world upon them he will keep the
[2:08:00] feet of his Saints and the wicked shall
[2:08:02] be silent in darkness for by strength
[2:08:04] shall no man prevail now let me look at
[2:08:07] that two ways you have this you will not
[2:08:09] prevail by your strength you are not
[2:08:12] going to have the the character of
[2:08:13] Christ by your strength but no other
[2:08:16] person is going to succeed against you
[2:08:18] with their strength either amen when the
[2:08:20] Lord is on your side no one can touch
[2:08:22] you Amen except the Lord allow it Amen
[2:08:25] for by strength shall no man prevail
[2:08:28] Amen God's gonna bring the change in the
[2:08:30] victory the adversaries of the Lord
[2:08:32] shall be broken to pieces out of heaven
[2:08:34] shall he thunder upon them the Lord
[2:08:36] shall judge the ends of the earth and he
[2:08:38] shall give strength unto his king and
[2:08:39] exalt the Horn of the anointed of his
[2:08:42] anointed look at the difference between
[2:08:45] I can't stand going to church I can't
[2:08:47] stand special services I can't stand the
[2:08:49] family I mean I can't stand the
[2:08:51] circumstances I'm in - everything is in
[2:08:54] the Lord's hands whatever he does is
[2:08:56] good he lifts up he raises down he
[2:08:58] blesses he doesn't bless it's all him
[2:09:00] and if you lift yourself up because you
[2:09:02] have everything he's going to bring you
[2:09:04] down and if you have nothing he's more
[2:09:05] than capable of bringing you up and
[2:09:07] having more than anybody else does amen
[2:09:09] what is it God has it in control she's
[2:09:11] completely overwhelmed by the by the
[2:09:14] answer to her prayer and that's all she
[2:09:17] wanted and hannah's now set for life you
[2:09:19] see this revelation here that's
[2:09:20] something that the gates of hell
[2:09:22] can never prevail against she's
[2:09:23] worshiping and she's praising God even
[2:09:25] though she's lost that blessing and had
[2:09:27] to give it away but now we look at verse
[2:09:29] 19
[2:09:30] speaking of Samuel says moreover his
[2:09:32] mother made him a little code and
[2:09:34] brought it to him from year to year when
[2:09:36] she came up up with her husband to offer
[2:09:38] the yearly sacrifice an Eli blessed
[2:09:44] Elkanah and his wife and said the Lord
[2:09:45] give the seed of this woman for the loan
[2:09:47] which is set Lent to the Lord and they
[2:09:50] went into their own home and the Lord
[2:09:52] visited Hannah so that she conceived and
[2:09:53] bare three sons and two daughters so god
[2:09:56] holds back all this time and then he
[2:09:59] drops five on her when she's an old
[2:10:00] woman not sure if that's a blessing or
[2:10:02] not but things were different back then
[2:10:05] that's for sure right so she gives the
[2:10:07] blessing back to God her approach is
[2:10:08] taken away and then he gives her five
[2:10:10] more children on top of that I've always
[2:10:13] wondered because she said earlier if you
[2:10:15] know she said they were so that the
[2:10:19] barren had born seven she bore six
[2:10:20] sometimes wonder if handed it Hannah
[2:10:22] didn't look at herself and say that was
[2:10:24] the other birth you know that was the
[2:10:26] change was her that the Lord had renewed
[2:10:28] and brought life to something else you
[2:10:29] know that it brought something that was
[2:10:31] barren that was lifeless and brought it
[2:10:33] back to its full its full health you
[2:10:36] know so what do we get out of this with
[2:10:38] Hannah for look at this remember we're
[2:10:41] talking about the mind of Christ the
[2:10:42] character of Christ what do we see in
[2:10:45] this with Hannah one it changed her
[2:10:46] approach to God after this Hannah
[2:10:49] doesn't look at that and say I don't
[2:10:50] have this and I don't have that and I'm
[2:10:52] Way away when I went the bitterness is
[2:10:54] gone now because she hasn't
[2:10:55] understanding that God does all things
[2:10:56] well so her approach now is no longer
[2:10:58] why don't I have it it's Lord what is
[2:11:01] your will in your way and then whatever
[2:11:03] you would do I'm happy with it
[2:11:05] I'm satisfied with it right so she's now
[2:11:08] looking not only for her own benefit but
[2:11:09] she's looking for the kingdom purpose in
[2:11:11] her life amen gave her a revelation of
[2:11:15] what the sovereignty of God like she
[2:11:18] said he raises up some he brings others
[2:11:20] down he blesses one this way he blesses
[2:11:22] the other one that way it's all in God's
[2:11:24] hands and she gets a revelation that hey
[2:11:26] if he decides that this is the way it's
[2:11:28] supposed to be for my life then I'm okay
[2:11:31] with that
[2:11:31] amen the third thing
[2:11:34] is it taught her to praise God Anna had
[2:11:36] a bitter hurt right she gotten sick and
[2:11:38] tired of being sick and tired and she
[2:11:40] was bitter and bitter and bitter but it
[2:11:42] drove her to her knees and in that she
[2:11:44] learned how to praise God even before
[2:11:46] the promise came and then once it came
[2:11:48] and things changed and maybe weren't
[2:11:49] quite as as the way she might have
[2:11:51] envisioned it yet she continued to
[2:11:53] praise and God blesses her and she gets
[2:11:55] five children after that amen sometimes
[2:11:58] we're waiting for the promise to
[2:11:59] manifest to start to praise and if
[2:12:01] you're sitting here and you're looking
[2:12:02] for something and you don't have it yet
[2:12:04] you can praise because the promise has
[2:12:06] been given if you can take it back to
[2:12:07] the word and say I have a promise for
[2:12:09] this then you can start praising him
[2:12:12] today because it's only a matter of time
[2:12:14] we look at it you know we're creatures
[2:12:16] of time but God's not a creature of time
[2:12:18] he's a creature of attorney so when he
[2:12:19] says it in his eyes it's done but we're
[2:12:22] sitting in that little that little
[2:12:23] pimple on the circle of time and we've
[2:12:25] got to wait and that's our struggle is
[2:12:27] that waiting time but in God's eyes it's
[2:12:29] done
[2:12:30] so you might as well if it's a finished
[2:12:32] work if it's in his word and he said
[2:12:34] he's gonna do it praise him now right
[2:12:37] that's the quarter that's the quarter
[2:12:39] and you just have to wait for the bread
[2:12:40] to come to the door right and you're
[2:12:41] gonna have money to pay for it when it
[2:12:43] comes a man it's that time in between
[2:12:45] the promise given and the promise
[2:12:47] received right he was just waiting for
[2:12:49] Hannah to say or do the right thing
[2:12:51] sometimes he's he's conditional that way
[2:12:53] he's got something he's waiting on us to
[2:12:55] say or do and then he'll give us the
[2:12:57] blessing and sometimes it's Lord I'll
[2:12:59] give it back to you sometimes you know
[2:13:01] so often brother Branham talked about
[2:13:03] different things whether it's singing or
[2:13:05] ministry and but also making money in
[2:13:07] these things he says what if God makes a
[2:13:09] man wealthy and he's got the Holy Ghost
[2:13:11] it's not so that the man can go out and
[2:13:13] have a well you know a fabulous life
[2:13:15] it's for a kingdom purpose right
[2:13:17] so if God's giving you a gift to sing
[2:13:19] and it's a wonderful thing in this
[2:13:20] church we've got people that will come
[2:13:21] up and sing constantly why because it's
[2:13:24] a sacrifice back to God right and then
[2:13:26] the different things whether it's a song
[2:13:28] writing the ministry all these different
[2:13:29] things you have all these gifts and
[2:13:31] God's just looking for you to what find
[2:13:32] the kingdom purpose for it and then all
[2:13:34] of a sudden you find that the carnal
[2:13:35] reflection of that starts to grow as
[2:13:37] well it can't it can't help with that
[2:13:39] right because God's blessing your life
[2:13:40] you're giving him that tithe you're
[2:13:42] giving him that commitment from you and
[2:13:43] he says I'll bless the whole thing now
[2:13:45] but when we hold it tight and we're
[2:13:47] trying to just
[2:13:48] right in the way we want he says no
[2:13:49] that's not gonna work and then he just
[2:13:51] pulls it away off times you know and
[2:13:54] then we all talk about these mountaintop
[2:13:56] experiences and we all want to be on the
[2:13:57] mountaintop but you can't survive on the
[2:14:00] mountain if you haven't walked up if you
[2:14:02] try going up they can apparently they
[2:14:04] can get to the top of of Everest now but
[2:14:06] if you get dropped off up there you
[2:14:08] can't survive you have to work your way
[2:14:11] up bit by bit to that mountain there are
[2:14:13] some that can go up there even without
[2:14:14] an oxygen tank
[2:14:16] you know the Sherpas and whatnot but if
[2:14:18] you don't do that three or four-month
[2:14:20] acclimation process you'll die on top of
[2:14:22] that you can't even sit up that's how
[2:14:24] weak you are from oxygen deprivation
[2:14:25] your body has to be developed as it's
[2:14:28] going up there and gods the same way
[2:14:30] he's building you up through these
[2:14:31] trials so that you get up there you can
[2:14:33] survive up there and then he takes you
[2:14:35] down or he just continues on to the next
[2:14:36] peak you know but we don't the growth is
[2:14:39] always happening in that climb you start
[2:14:41] in the valley and you're going up that's
[2:14:42] where the growth is and then he'll let
[2:14:44] you rest for a bit and then he says
[2:14:45] let's go a little bit higher right line
[2:14:47] upon line precept upon precept amen you
[2:14:50] don't find a single person in the
[2:14:52] scripture that is anointed by God that
[2:14:54] doesn't have to go through this process
[2:14:55] there's not a single one and the more
[2:14:57] he's called you for the more he's gonna
[2:14:58] put you through and guess what we're all
[2:15:01] going in a rapture so get used to it get
[2:15:04] used to it because you are the elite of
[2:15:06] the elite you are the best of the best
[2:15:08] not because of what you do but because
[2:15:10] he has said you are the best of the best
[2:15:11] you are my elect bride you are the
[2:15:14] spotless bride right you are the called
[2:15:17] according to his purpose so this is the
[2:15:20] best of the best but he says we're gonna
[2:15:23] be doing some building here you know it
[2:15:25] talks about it except it'd be a quick
[2:15:27] short work and I think sometimes that's
[2:15:28] the way it's going to happen as things
[2:15:30] are gonna start tumbling very very
[2:15:31] quickly and if you look at what's going
[2:15:33] on in the world around its crumbling
[2:15:35] very very quickly right the protections
[2:15:38] that we've enjoyed as believers they're
[2:15:39] falling away fast the laws are on the
[2:15:41] books we were talking about it today the
[2:15:43] laws are on the books that could shut
[2:15:44] this down this church down today
[2:15:46] they'd have no problem doing it under
[2:15:47] under current laws right what there's
[2:15:50] going to be that pressure and as that
[2:15:51] pressures applied that character starts
[2:15:53] coming out more and more and more and I
[2:15:55] don't believe it'll be a surprise when
[2:15:57] that day happens and we just walk out of
[2:15:59] here
[2:16:00] amen Psalms 34 verse 19 says many are
[2:16:03] the afflictions of the righteous but the
[2:16:05] Lord delivereth him out of them all amen
[2:16:08] David was twenty two years in the making
[2:16:10] twenty two years from the time he was
[2:16:12] anointed to the time that he was king of
[2:16:14] Israel and Judah right
[2:16:16] Abraham was 25 years from the day God
[2:16:18] gave the promise to the day it came
[2:16:20] right Paul spent three years on the
[2:16:23] backside of the desert after being
[2:16:24] filled with the Holy Ghost to be what
[2:16:26] the prophet of the age you're not gonna
[2:16:28] get away by just walking waltzing around
[2:16:30] this earth and God just dropping things
[2:16:32] in he's gonna do a testing work amen
[2:16:34] amen we okay all right Daniel chapter
[2:16:40] three so be our second story and our
[2:16:45] last one very familiar Scripture Daniel
[2:16:48] chapter three is the three Hebrew
[2:16:49] children Daniel chapter 3 and verse 1
[2:16:56] says Nebuchadnezzar the King made an
[2:17:01] image of gold whose height was
[2:17:02] threescore cubits and the breadth
[2:17:04] thereof six cubits he said it in the
[2:17:06] plain of Dura and the provinces of
[2:17:07] Babylon the Nebuchadnezzar the king sent
[2:17:09] to gather together the princes the
[2:17:11] governors the captains the judges the
[2:17:12] treasurers the counselors the sheriffs
[2:17:14] and all the rulers of the provinces to
[2:17:16] come to the dedication of the image
[2:17:18] which Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up
[2:17:19] now I want you to notice something here
[2:17:21] I'm for the sake of time I haven't I'm
[2:17:23] not going to go too deep into this but
[2:17:25] remember that they chose the best of the
[2:17:27] best out of Israel and brought them as
[2:17:28] captives to Nebuchadnezzar so when he's
[2:17:31] talking about all these important people
[2:17:32] I want you to recognize that that group
[2:17:34] is sprinkled with Hebrews right
[2:17:36] supposedly true believers that whole
[2:17:38] group there's going to be a bunch of
[2:17:39] them in there because he brought the
[2:17:40] best of the best to mingle them in with
[2:17:42] the Babylonian traditions and knowledge
[2:17:44] to try and come up with even more than
[2:17:46] Babylon hat right so he wanted to blend
[2:17:48] them in then on verse 3 says then all
[2:17:50] the important people were gathered
[2:17:52] together unto the dedication of the
[2:17:53] image that Nebuchadnezzar the King had
[2:17:54] set up and they stood before the image
[2:17:56] that he'd set up then an Herald cried
[2:17:58] and said to you it is commanded o people
[2:18:01] nations and languages at what time you
[2:18:03] hear the sound of all these different
[2:18:04] instruments fall down and worship the
[2:18:06] golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
[2:18:08] King had set up and whoso falleth not
[2:18:10] down in worship it shall the same hour
[2:18:12] be cast in the
[2:18:13] the midst of a burning fiery furnace so
[2:18:16] for if you're a Hebrew there he's
[2:18:18] telling you to do what break the first
[2:18:20] and second commandments how he's telling
[2:18:22] you to serve it it you know there's
[2:18:23] another God before you and you're bowing
[2:18:25] to an idol so he's saying any Hebrews
[2:18:27] here you've got to break the
[2:18:28] commandments if you want to live that's
[2:18:30] what you have to do you have to go
[2:18:31] against the word amen
[2:18:32] lose your life or you can you can go
[2:18:36] against God very simple right but this
[2:18:39] isn't in church now right this is in
[2:18:41] real life this is at their jobs this is
[2:18:44] when they're walking around with friends
[2:18:45] and whatnot so often we're in the church
[2:18:47] and everything's rah rah rah we've got
[2:18:49] our hands raised and we're full of faith
[2:18:50] but now they're called out and they who
[2:18:52] knows what they thought when they're
[2:18:54] being called out and the invitations
[2:18:56] given and you've got to be here for this
[2:18:58] then they walk out and see this I don't
[2:19:01] think maybe them we're thinking we're
[2:19:02] gonna be told to bow down today right
[2:19:04] maybe they thought they're gonna see a
[2:19:05] ceremony or something you know or you
[2:19:08] know just whatever you know
[2:19:10] ribbon-cutting ceremony for the the new
[2:19:12] god of of Babylon but they get there and
[2:19:15] they're immediately confronted with
[2:19:17] their beliefs and they're saying either
[2:19:19] it's you take what you believe and you
[2:19:21] live by it or you're gonna die by it at
[2:19:23] our hand right simple choice choose now
[2:19:27] right there's no let's have a vote you
[2:19:30] know what do you guys think about this
[2:19:32] do you think we should all work no it's
[2:19:33] here's what you're gonna do and if you
[2:19:35] don't do it you die right very simple
[2:19:37] and in your face amen we know what they
[2:19:39] decide to do they stood their ground and
[2:19:42] it says verse 8 wherefore at that time
[2:19:43] certain Chaldeans came near and accused
[2:19:45] the Jews and said in verse 12 that there
[2:19:48] are certain Jews whom thou has set over
[2:19:50] the affairs of the province of Babylon
[2:19:51] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego these men
[2:19:53] O king have not regarded thee they serve
[2:19:55] not thy God's nor worship the golden
[2:19:57] image which thou has set up they only
[2:20:00] mentioned three Hebrew children there
[2:20:03] were others there I believe they were
[2:20:05] there but you know when they fell they
[2:20:08] fell in the first and second chapter of
[2:20:10] Daniel when what they gave him food that
[2:20:12] was prepared for idols they ate of the
[2:20:14] king's table amen I I spoke on this
[2:20:17] somewhat to the young people back home
[2:20:19] and I said if you know you hear about
[2:20:21] these miracle diets all right I said
[2:20:23] take the Daniel 10 day diet eat only
[2:20:26] that which is good
[2:20:27] for ten days and see what see how you
[2:20:29] compare to those around you right
[2:20:31] because what happened is the the the
[2:20:33] other Hebrews set up we're not gonna
[2:20:34] stand against the king it's the Kings
[2:20:35] commandment we're gonna eat whatever he
[2:20:37] sends our way and it was offered before
[2:20:39] idols and it was unclean flesh and all
[2:20:41] these different things
[2:20:42] I remember brother Mark preaching on
[2:20:43] their teaching on this in Sunday school
[2:20:45] and he talked about dried pulse you know
[2:20:47] and YUM I remember you physically doing
[2:20:49] that brother mark as one of my favorite
[2:20:51] memories of Sunday school and dried
[2:20:54] pulses is legumes and beans and stuff
[2:20:57] dried ones right
[2:20:59] horrible horrible right that's why I
[2:21:03] wasn't born in that age I couldn't
[2:21:04] survive on it but that's what they lived
[2:21:07] on and and they drank water they said no
[2:21:09] wine no juices no anything like that
[2:21:11] they Dre they a dried pulse and they
[2:21:14] drank water and after ten days they were
[2:21:18] obviously the scripture says obviously
[2:21:20] better than all of the ones around them
[2:21:22] and then after three years they were ten
[2:21:24] times better than anybody else in the
[2:21:26] kingdom not just the ones that were
[2:21:28] brought in but ten times better than all
[2:21:29] of the wise men of Babylon that's what a
[2:21:32] good diet will do for you amen
[2:21:34] we're not talking about our bodies we're
[2:21:36] talking about our spiritual food now so
[2:21:38] the the other Hebrew children they'd
[2:21:39] fallen long ago and we see the effect of
[2:21:41] that that's slowly just letting the
[2:21:43] guard down letting things in have what
[2:21:46] it brought them to the place where when
[2:21:47] now the devil comes up and he punches
[2:21:48] them in the face
[2:21:49] they're not ready for it they just
[2:21:50] pulled over right they're not a believer
[2:21:52] they're make believer and I'm sure they
[2:21:54] went home and patted each other on the
[2:21:55] back and said you know we're here where
[2:21:57] slaves we're not supposed to stand up
[2:21:58] for ourselves and everything but there
[2:22:00] were some that did and we see the effect
[2:22:03] of that later as we go on amen and then
[2:22:05] we know the true believer stands for God
[2:22:06] no matter where she is
[2:22:07] we're in kingdoms right we walk around
[2:22:10] in our jobs us men especially you're
[2:22:12] gonna be faced with situations where you
[2:22:14] have to say yeah I don't do that I'm
[2:22:16] sorry or I won't do that I remember mom
[2:22:18] talking about when she worked for the
[2:22:20] the accountant here and he asked her to
[2:22:22] tell the client that she'd sent out
[2:22:23] paperwork and she knew she had said it
[2:22:25] they hadn't sent it and she had to go to
[2:22:27] him and say I'm sorry she said I'll tell
[2:22:31] him we're sending it out now and then
[2:22:32] I'll go send it but I can't tell him
[2:22:34] we've sent it because they'd missed a
[2:22:35] deadline and the guy was trying to pass
[2:22:37] it off she said I can't do it
[2:22:39] right there's no time to sit and get
[2:22:41] prayed up when that happens you've got
[2:22:43] to be instant in season ready to go this
[2:22:45] is what I believe and I'm standing for
[2:22:46] it even if it cost me my job
[2:22:48] because now it made him look bad right
[2:22:50] her boss is saying so I told you what to
[2:22:53] do and you won't do it and you're
[2:22:54] basically calling me a liar yeah yep
[2:22:59] right and she stayed with mr. pitcher
[2:23:01] for years and was blessed in it you know
[2:23:03] but you've got to be ready for that and
[2:23:06] it's only by the only way you're gonna
[2:23:07] do that is if you're eating right that's
[2:23:08] what we see with the three Hebrew
[2:23:09] children and Daniel was they were eating
[2:23:11] right the whole time they kept their
[2:23:12] standard all along amen
[2:23:14] verse 13 says then Nebuchadnezzar and
[2:23:17] his rage and fury commanded to bring
[2:23:19] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego then they
[2:23:21] brought these men before the king
[2:23:22] Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar spake and
[2:23:25] said unto them is it true or Shadrach
[2:23:26] Meshach and Abednego do not you serve my
[2:23:29] God's nor worship the golden image which
[2:23:31] I have set up now if ye be ready at what
[2:23:33] time you hear the sound of all these
[2:23:35] different instruments fall down and
[2:23:37] worship the image which I have made well
[2:23:39] but if you worship not you shall be cast
[2:23:41] the same hour into the midst of a fire
[2:23:43] burning fiery furnace now listen to what
[2:23:45] he says here and who is that God that
[2:23:47] shall deliver you out of my hands
[2:23:49] so he's not just challenging their
[2:23:51] beliefs he says your God can't do
[2:23:53] anything about it right nobody can stop
[2:23:57] me I'm the king this is going to happen
[2:23:58] I've told you it's gonna happen you're
[2:24:00] gonna die and there's no God can stop me
[2:24:02] he's never run up against a God that
[2:24:03] could stop him right what God can
[2:24:08] deliver you out of my hands does anybody
[2:24:10] had that happen recently a situation
[2:24:13] that says who can deliver you from this
[2:24:15] we've had it in our family Atlanta gets
[2:24:18] cancer right what is it that's Satan
[2:24:20] standing up and saying can your job
[2:24:22] deliver you from this what God can do
[2:24:24] this everybody else dies you're weak
[2:24:25] you're light weight you're never gonna
[2:24:27] make it through this what God can save
[2:24:29] you right then we look at ones with
[2:24:31] chronic conditions and these different
[2:24:32] things and they say there's no cure
[2:24:34] right
[2:24:35] Blanka when she got pregnant with Selena
[2:24:38] she had the gall bladder trouble right
[2:24:40] and that plagued her for months and
[2:24:41] months and months there's no cure for
[2:24:43] that we know that you can basically
[2:24:45] mitigate it with diet or you can cut
[2:24:48] your your-your-your gall bladder out
[2:24:52] right
[2:24:52] you can't do anything about there's no
[2:24:54] healing for gallbladder disease those
[2:24:56] issues and yet in one moment in a
[2:24:58] service dog came down boom and healed
[2:25:00] her completely she was eating almost
[2:25:02] nothing there was oh so little that she
[2:25:03] could eat and because of that condition
[2:25:05] and Selena was completely colicky if you
[2:25:08] remember and in one service God came
[2:25:11] down they pray for her and boom
[2:25:13] completely healed and we went out for
[2:25:15] ice cream after that which was the worst
[2:25:17] thing possible for her to be eating and
[2:25:19] Selena was never colicky again after
[2:25:21] that in one moment Satan went from who
[2:25:24] can deliver you from this to out the
[2:25:27] door and enjoy an ice-cream it at the
[2:25:29] same time right right Satan comes down
[2:25:31] he says all these things nobody can be
[2:25:32] healed of this this is a chronic
[2:25:34] condition
[2:25:34] nobody's ever beat this there are
[2:25:37] certain things that people in the
[2:25:39] message are scared of sorry it's true
[2:25:42] it's true and what is it saying saying
[2:25:43] who can deliver you from this take
[2:25:46] courage from these and say what did they
[2:25:49] say they said an answer to the king
[2:25:51] verse 16 okay old Nebuchadnezzar we are
[2:25:53] not careful to answer thee in this
[2:25:54] matter we don't have to sit around and
[2:25:56] take a vote what are we going to do we
[2:25:57] don't have to guard our words if it be
[2:26:00] so our God whom we serve is able to
[2:26:03] deliver us from the burning fiery
[2:26:04] furnace and he will deliver us out of
[2:26:06] thine hand O king so he says God's keep
[2:26:09] our God is capable of anything he can
[2:26:11] deliver us out of this but verse 18 if
[2:26:14] not be it known unto thee O king we will
[2:26:17] not serve thy God's nor worship the
[2:26:18] golden image which I was set up he says
[2:26:21] our God can you want to know a god that
[2:26:23] can I serve a God that can a man where
[2:26:25] is the God of Elijah that's the God that
[2:26:27] we serve in this age is the God of
[2:26:29] Elijah that has proven himself in signs
[2:26:30] and wonders and he has not changed since
[2:26:32] brother Branham left the scene Amen
[2:26:35] there's nothing different the presence
[2:26:36] of the Holy Spirit is what heals I mean
[2:26:38] it's not a prophet that heals it's that
[2:26:40] angel standing there that touches the
[2:26:42] person they meant what God can deliver
[2:26:46] you out of our hand they say ours can
[2:26:48] but if he doesn't we're not changing
[2:26:49] we're not going to change anything amen
[2:26:51] if he doesn't deliver us doesn't matter
[2:26:53] we're not going to bow now we see things
[2:26:56] get hurt get bad in a hurry verse 19
[2:26:58] says then was Nebuchadnezzar full of
[2:27:00] fury and the form of his visit was
[2:27:02] changed against Shadrach Meshach and
[2:27:04] Abednego so he was kind of like I'll
[2:27:05] give you a check
[2:27:06] I think he knew about them you know if
[2:27:08] they were so good at things he probably
[2:27:09] heard about them it was kinda like I'll
[2:27:11] give you another chance I know about you
[2:27:12] guys I know that you're a benefit to the
[2:27:14] kingdom you're smarter than all the rest
[2:27:15] in these things I'll give you a second
[2:27:17] chance okay just don't make me look bad
[2:27:19] just go bow but it says that changes now
[2:27:22] and he just he's so furious and what to
[2:27:25] do he says therefore he spake and
[2:27:26] commanded that they should heat the
[2:27:28] furnace one seven times more than it was
[2:27:30] want to be heated engineers would say he
[2:27:32] exceeded the operational limits of the
[2:27:34] furnace cranked it up right
[2:27:36] he's mad seven times hotter than it was
[2:27:39] supposed to be in because it says then
[2:27:41] it was want to be hit as he did so what
[2:27:43] then it was supposed to be heated and
[2:27:45] how it was normally heated seven times
[2:27:47] more and listen to this verse 20 it says
[2:27:49] and he commanded the most mighty men
[2:27:51] that were in his army to bind Shadrach
[2:27:53] Meshach and Abednego and to cast him
[2:27:55] into the burning fiery furnace in order
[2:27:56] of the wimps he brought the champions
[2:27:59] out he brought the big hairy mean dudes
[2:28:02] right he brought the goliaths in his
[2:28:05] army and said you're the ones that are
[2:28:06] gonna take them over there
[2:28:07] because he knew what he knew that it was
[2:28:09] going to be tough just to get them there
[2:28:11] it's so hot
[2:28:12] he knew you're gonna need the biggest
[2:28:14] the best the strongest the meanest the
[2:28:16] baddest amen verse 21 says then these
[2:28:20] men were bound in their coats their
[2:28:22] hosing and their hats and their other
[2:28:23] garments if you know anything about
[2:28:24] babylonian garments that's a bad thing
[2:28:26] in a fire all right lots of frilly
[2:28:28] things and everything you're gonna go up
[2:28:29] like a like a roman candle right and
[2:28:31] they were cast into the midst of the
[2:28:33] burning fiery furnace but listen to this
[2:28:35] it says therefore because the king's
[2:28:36] commandment was urgent and the furnace
[2:28:38] exceeding hot the flames of the fire
[2:28:41] slew those men that took up Shadrach
[2:28:43] Meshach and Abednego so they're going
[2:28:45] and walking into the flames and their
[2:28:49] captors died the most mighty thing that
[2:28:53] Satan could bring against them dies
[2:28:55] before they can even be consumed so the
[2:28:58] weakest Christian if you want to say
[2:29:00] that walking into that trial can survive
[2:29:03] where the mightiest of Satan's army
[2:29:04] cannot amen
[2:29:06] that ought to give us some courage this
[2:29:08] evening when we think about this as when
[2:29:09] you're walking into the fire and
[2:29:11] everyone around you is falling down you
[2:29:13] ought to recognize there's something
[2:29:15] special going on amen
[2:29:17] but look at that these mighty men were
[2:29:19] so committed to that King that they gave
[2:29:21] their lives to throw somebody else into
[2:29:23] the fire this isn't you know mortal
[2:29:26] combat this is not a fair fight this is
[2:29:28] willingly walking your way until you die
[2:29:31] of heat Satan has no logic right if
[2:29:35] you're looking at what's happening
[2:29:36] against you if you're facing
[2:29:37] persecutions troubles trials sickness
[2:29:39] there's no logic to it right it's all
[2:29:42] about destroying you and they will
[2:29:44] destroy themselves The Situation's I
[2:29:46] faced at work with my previous employer
[2:29:48] they were cutting their own throats by
[2:29:49] the things they were doing to me and
[2:29:51] they didn't care they were just focused
[2:29:53] on getting me out of there it was
[2:29:55] amazing it was amazing what was
[2:29:57] happening there was no logic to it but
[2:29:59] what it was Satan coming against me I
[2:30:01] firmly believe that because it made no
[2:30:02] sense otherwise you know listen to what
[2:30:06] brother branham says in victory day
[2:30:07] talking about this he says God has
[2:30:10] counted you worthy when you have a test
[2:30:11] so test shows worthiness of the believer
[2:30:14] he says now don't fail this to get this
[2:30:17] when you have a trial or a test
[2:30:19] it shows the grace of God has found you
[2:30:24] you have found favor with God and God
[2:30:28] believes you'll stand the test I'm gonna
[2:30:31] read that again it says it shows the
[2:30:32] grace of God how many of us are looking
[2:30:35] at those trials and saying thank you
[2:30:36] Lord this is your grace that you believe
[2:30:39] that I can make it through you have
[2:30:41] found favor with God we think of Mary
[2:30:43] that's finding favor right be done to me
[2:30:46] according to thy word but that's what
[2:30:48] he's doing he's saying what's going to
[2:30:50] happen is what the word said is gonna
[2:30:51] happen so get ready for this is my grace
[2:30:53] to you and God believes that you'll
[2:30:55] stand the test
[2:30:57] amen hallelujah verse 23 it says in
[2:31:01] these three men Shadrach Meshach and
[2:31:03] Abednego fell down bound into the midst
[2:31:05] of the burning fiery furnace then
[2:31:07] Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished
[2:31:09] and rose up in haste and spake and said
[2:31:10] unto his counselors did not we cast
[2:31:12] three men into the midst of the fire the
[2:31:15] answered and said unto the king true O
[2:31:16] king he answered and said lo I see four
[2:31:18] men loose walking in the midst of the
[2:31:20] fire and they have no hurt and the form
[2:31:23] of the fourth is like the Son of God now
[2:31:27] that's a really quick sequence so I want
[2:31:28] to break this down because you got a
[2:31:30] recognize that those three Hebrew
[2:31:32] children knew something was happening
[2:31:35] okay let's make that the fire so they're
[2:31:39] there and they're bound right they can't
[2:31:41] run and they've got the mighty men and
[2:31:43] they're walking them slowly towards the
[2:31:45] fire and I'm sure it was a ways away
[2:31:46] right this wasn't a 30-second walk
[2:31:49] because otherwise it would have you know
[2:31:51] the heat would have been destroyed ever
[2:31:52] so they're probably walking for five or
[2:31:54] ten minutes to get over there you know
[2:31:55] and so they've got this slow walk
[2:31:57] towards sudden death and the heat should
[2:32:01] be building and building and building
[2:32:03] and what they notice is the things the
[2:32:06] people that are holding them that are
[2:32:08] pushing them forward aren't pushing as
[2:32:10] hard as they used to right so they're
[2:32:12] going forward and they're kind of
[2:32:14] looking back and they're noticing the
[2:32:16] sweat rolling off of the guys that are
[2:32:18] behind them the big muscular burly
[2:32:20] warriors are struggling to just push
[2:32:23] them into the fire and they're getting
[2:32:25] closer and closer and abednego he's
[2:32:27] looking at me shocked he's saying
[2:32:28] Meshach how are you doing he says I'm
[2:32:30] good how are you doing look good so far
[2:32:33] let's keep walking and meanwhile the
[2:32:35] guys behind them are going slower and
[2:32:37] slower and they're slumping to the
[2:32:39] ground and the last thing they can do
[2:32:41] before they die is push them in there
[2:32:43] but by the time they get to here and
[2:32:45] they're close to the fire what's
[2:32:46] happening to Abednego and Meshach and
[2:32:48] and Shadrach they're saying I don't feel
[2:32:51] anything I'm walking into the fire and
[2:32:53] I'm okay right they know that something
[2:32:57] is happening and so they keep walking
[2:33:00] and they get pushed in but I believe
[2:33:01] they would have just walked in anyways
[2:33:03] because what's killing everyone around
[2:33:05] them has no effect on them right as
[2:33:08] they're sitting there and this cooling
[2:33:10] breeze blows over what is is the mighty
[2:33:12] presence of God coming down and he's
[2:33:14] Fanning the flames to kill everybody
[2:33:16] around them to burn off their bindings
[2:33:19] the things that held them and then they
[2:33:21] fall into the flames and they're happy
[2:33:24] to stay there right right they're
[2:33:28] looking for marshmallows all right we're
[2:33:31] in the fire and we're okay they're in
[2:33:33] the trial and there is nothing that is
[2:33:35] asking them to get out there's nothing
[2:33:37] in them that says I need to get out of
[2:33:38] this trial right now or something bad is
[2:33:40] going to happen they're standing in the
[2:33:42] flames and
[2:33:44] happy to walk around and talk to God in
[2:33:46] the trial you can't tell me that
[2:33:48] something wasn't happening as I started
[2:33:50] to walk closer and closer to that fire
[2:33:52] and they say he's here he's here he's
[2:33:55] here our God is able
[2:33:56] amen they start to recognize the very
[2:33:59] presence of the God that they believed
[2:34:00] and they walk into that fire and all of
[2:34:02] a sudden they have an experience with
[2:34:04] God that they could never have imagined
[2:34:06] and it took a slow walk into a seven
[2:34:09] times hotter fire that killed everybody
[2:34:11] else around them for them to experience
[2:34:13] God in a way that nobody else has ever
[2:34:14] experienced of what spiritual muscles
[2:34:18] they must have had after that right to
[2:34:20] where they're walking around and they
[2:34:22] don't come out until the King says come
[2:34:25] out they're happy to stay in the trial
[2:34:28] and experience the presence of God until
[2:34:30] the King commands them to come out
[2:34:33] experience let me say again experience
[2:34:35] the presence of God in the fire until
[2:34:38] somebody tells them to come out there's
[2:34:41] a they had an absolute experience there
[2:34:44] that is unmatched in scripture unmatched
[2:34:47] in scripture who ever heard of walking
[2:34:49] around in a fire in comfort and the only
[2:34:51] thing that's burned off is the very
[2:34:53] things that were holding them and killed
[2:34:55] all the enemies that have pushed them in
[2:34:56] there in the first place and converted
[2:34:58] that King to a degree right amazing
[2:35:02] where the brown said this in the message
[2:35:04] Shalom he says oh yes he permits crosses
[2:35:06] and crossroads and junctions he always
[2:35:08] does that in order to perfect us for a
[2:35:10] service he permits those things to
[2:35:12] happen can you understand that he says
[2:35:15] he does that so that he can perfect you
[2:35:17] for the calling he has called you for
[2:35:20] that's you're growing pains he did
[2:35:22] Daniel that way you know he says he did
[2:35:23] the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace
[2:35:25] what did the fiery furnace do the fiery
[2:35:27] first only broke the bands that had them
[2:35:29] bound that's all the furnace did just
[2:35:31] burnt loose the band's sometimes that
[2:35:34] trial is to burn off those things it's
[2:35:35] to bring them out so that they can be
[2:35:37] burned off amen amen
[2:35:40] standing for God and so comfortable in
[2:35:41] the trial that they wouldn't leave it
[2:35:43] The effect of it was better the effect
[2:35:46] of God was better than anything else
[2:35:47] they'd rather stay there amen now
[2:35:53] gone through that but I want you to
[2:35:54] recognize I'm gonna read what brother
[2:35:56] Bram says and it's a page and a half so
[2:35:58] bear with me but he does it in such a
[2:35:59] wonderful way because so often we think
[2:36:02] we're alone in the trial and we think
[2:36:05] God's holding off and why is he holding
[2:36:06] off in these different things but watch
[2:36:08] her brother branham says about this he's
[2:36:09] talking about the soldiers he says those
[2:36:11] fellows pushing them holding their heads
[2:36:13] back they get right up just one more
[2:36:15] step now and away they go down into the
[2:36:16] fiery furnace to be consumed why the men
[2:36:19] that was standing plumb behind them died
[2:36:20] of the intense heat he said goes to show
[2:36:23] that God was right with them on the
[2:36:25] march right the fear starts to drop away
[2:36:29] as they're getting closer he says he'll
[2:36:31] be right with you from this night on
[2:36:33] when you just take him just stand on his
[2:36:35] word and believe he's in his word and in
[2:36:37] his son he says here they go marching
[2:36:39] right on right up to the edge watch one
[2:36:41] more step and in there they go and
[2:36:43] that's the toughest isn't it when you're
[2:36:45] you're like this is it we're going in he
[2:36:50] says our picture looks pretty bright
[2:36:51] pretty dark right now for believers
[2:36:53] doesn't it he says let's just turn our
[2:36:55] camera or binoculars and look up you
[2:36:57] know all the time there's something
[2:36:58] going on in earth there's something
[2:37:00] going on in heaven I can see them let's
[2:37:02] look at him a moment I can see him
[2:37:03] sitting on his throne his priestly robes
[2:37:05] all around him
[2:37:06] I can see coming to his right a noise
[2:37:07] what is it let's call it Gabriel the
[2:37:09] great Archangel Rob to the side of him
[2:37:11] pulled a sword and said master have you
[2:37:14] looked down in Babylon three true
[2:37:16] believers are meeting their end he says
[2:37:20] have you beheld them he says I've obeyed
[2:37:22] you since you created me let me go down
[2:37:25] I'll change the scene just in a few
[2:37:26] moments I believe he could don't you
[2:37:28] brother Bram says I believe he could
[2:37:30] Gabriel he says that big sore pulled and
[2:37:33] David seen him with the Joshua seen him
[2:37:35] when he crossed the river then when he
[2:37:36] said I'm the captain of the hosts of the
[2:37:37] Lord I've seen that horrid sword drawn
[2:37:39] and he said Lord let me go down I can
[2:37:41] hear him say Gabriel you've been a good
[2:37:44] angel since the day I created you you
[2:37:45] have obeyed me but I just can't let you
[2:37:48] go I can see Gabriel put his sword back
[2:37:51] into the sheath stand attention at his
[2:37:53] side he says oh my everything in heaven
[2:37:55] obeyed him that's right all but the
[2:37:57] heart of men they don't want to obey Him
[2:37:58] they don't want to believe him says look
[2:38:01] coming to the left here comes another
[2:38:03] angel look at him he says God has
[2:38:05] ministering spirits angel
[2:38:07] that's often what we're looking for
[2:38:09] isn't it a ministering spirit to come he
[2:38:11] said I believe that this one right here
[2:38:13] now not fire and he stood what was his
[2:38:15] name wormwood bitter waters I hear him
[2:38:18] say Oh master have you looked down into
[2:38:19] Babylon let me go down there this
[2:38:21] morning you gave me the keys to the
[2:38:22] antediluvian destruction I poured the
[2:38:25] waters over the earth
[2:38:26] he said worm word has it controls of all
[2:38:28] the waters of the earth the Bible says
[2:38:30] and there he says I'll go down and wash
[2:38:32] Babylon off the face of the earth I
[2:38:33] believe he could have done it don't you
[2:38:35] yes sir he said old master looked down
[2:38:37] there he says and I can hear him say
[2:38:39] what worm you've been a good angel you
[2:38:41] obeyed me and brought up the springs of
[2:38:43] the deep and so forth and destroyed the
[2:38:44] world in the days of Noah but I just
[2:38:47] can't let you go I can see wormwood
[2:38:49] taking his place again and stand at
[2:38:51] attention
[2:38:51] have you considered another angel said
[2:38:54] he said yes I've been watching them all
[2:38:57] along he says old brother if he
[2:38:59] considered three he's considering about
[2:39:01] three thousand here tonight - he's in a
[2:39:02] big service you know he says his eyes on
[2:39:05] the sparrow he knows right now what do
[2:39:07] you have need of he knows why you've
[2:39:09] come to this meeting tonight but I can
[2:39:12] hear him say I can't let you go you
[2:39:13] fellows because I'm going myself he says
[2:39:18] oh my I can see him rise he says you
[2:39:20] think I'm crazy don't you you're gonna
[2:39:22] call me a Holy Roller anyhow so you
[2:39:23] might as well do it he says he noticed I
[2:39:25] love him I hold my life wrapped in him I
[2:39:27] see nothing but him and I can see him
[2:39:29] rise from his throne his garments drop
[2:39:31] around him gets out there and way back
[2:39:33] over in the North Country I see a big
[2:39:35] Thunder head I can hear him say come
[2:39:37] here oh my I can hear him say east wind
[2:39:39] west north and south come here
[2:39:41] everything mines him that's right I can
[2:39:43] hear him say go over there and get under
[2:39:46] that Thunder head and roll it over here
[2:39:47] here comes the north east south and west
[2:39:49] winds going to this big Thunder head and
[2:39:51] here it comes turning up to the side of
[2:39:53] the throne I can see him step on that
[2:39:55] and say winds I'm gonna drive you like
[2:39:58] horses this morning I'm going down to
[2:40:01] Babylon he says I can see him reach up
[2:40:03] and get ahold of his zigzag lightning
[2:40:05] with his hands past by the tree of life
[2:40:07] and pick off a branch and they made
[2:40:09] their last step trusting God's Word and
[2:40:11] about that time they stepped in there
[2:40:13] was one like the son of man standing by
[2:40:17] their side he says hallelujah yes sir
[2:40:19] with a palm from the
[2:40:20] life Fanning away even with the hot
[2:40:23] breezes down there talking with them
[2:40:26] there's some things God says no I don't
[2:40:29] send an angel for this one says I'm
[2:40:32] gonna come down and do it myself and
[2:40:34] then there's a reason why there's
[2:40:36] silence for a space of about half an
[2:40:37] hour under that seventh seal amen
[2:40:40] he's down here he says I'm not going to
[2:40:42] just send somebody else to do with this
[2:40:43] this is something that I'm gonna do in
[2:40:45] this bride a man there's this deity this
[2:40:48] gold character of God says I'm gonna do
[2:40:50] that and I'm gonna be there with them to
[2:40:52] bring them through it in person amen
[2:40:53] what they experienced there was a
[2:40:55] difference between knowing about it
[2:40:57] and knowing it that's really what this
[2:41:00] was about for them was that this didn't
[2:41:01] just come now from a God that gave
[2:41:03] Daniel dreams right this wasn't one that
[2:41:06] gave Daniel visions this was now a
[2:41:08] personal experience with God that proved
[2:41:11] a beyond a shadow of a doubt his reality
[2:41:13] and his care and consideration for them
[2:41:16] wasn't just that he was real but that he
[2:41:18] had accepted their belief that he
[2:41:20] accepted their sacrifice that he had
[2:41:22] stood by them and that he would stand by
[2:41:24] them forever amen amen they were not
[2:41:28] rescued until they were literally in the
[2:41:29] fire and sometimes that's what we're
[2:41:31] waiting for we're saying I believe I
[2:41:32] believe I believe and he'll let you walk
[2:41:34] right into it before he takes you up
[2:41:36] amen listen over brother Branham said
[2:41:39] the message how I can how can I overcome
[2:41:40] though he's talking about the confidence
[2:41:43] that comes with these trials
[2:41:44] he says Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[2:41:46] had so much victory until the fire
[2:41:49] couldn't burn them so much victory until
[2:41:51] the fire can burn them you know victory
[2:41:53] is a hard thing to burn out or eat up or
[2:41:55] anything he said see so they had it
[2:41:57] because what character is a victory and
[2:42:00] character is all that's left when the
[2:42:02] burning is done and then that's all
[2:42:04] that's left that's the only thing that
[2:42:05] can stand the fire is that godly
[2:42:07] character amen but what did it what cost
[2:42:10] was it to them what cost was it to the
[2:42:14] three Hebrew children it was all or
[2:42:16] nothing
[2:42:17] there was no halfway right there is no
[2:42:19] let's go until it starts to get
[2:42:21] uncomfortable until the heat gets bad
[2:42:23] right until the clothes start to kind of
[2:42:25] crinkle and you know and our hats catch
[2:42:27] on fire no it was all the way or nothing
[2:42:30] and that was what the cost of them was
[2:42:32] they had to say I'm in it
[2:42:34] the long haul I'm in it until we die or
[2:42:37] until he rescues us and that's it there
[2:42:39] is no other way about it right so we
[2:42:43] look at those two stories hand in those
[2:42:45] Hebrew children right seeking the will
[2:42:47] and purpose of God that's always
[2:42:49] surrender the key to that is always
[2:42:51] surrender you can't have your plans your
[2:42:54] thoughts your ideas your intellect your
[2:42:55] training your experience it has got to
[2:42:57] be him and him alone amen
[2:42:58] waiting on the Lord and trusting his
[2:43:00] timing you'll see it in the scripture
[2:43:01] time and time again trusting him to do
[2:43:04] it in his way amen how many times did
[2:43:07] they bring victory through different
[2:43:09] means in the in the in the Old Testament
[2:43:11] especially right sometimes he's got
[2:43:14] Gideon out there he turns the enemy on
[2:43:16] themselves and then Gideon goes in with
[2:43:17] some pitchers with fire inside of it and
[2:43:19] destroys 120,000 people right other
[2:43:22] times he takes the priests and leads
[2:43:23] them in worship
[2:43:24] sometimes our victory is through worship
[2:43:26] right sometimes it's with what a prophet
[2:43:28] a minister of the Lord comes in right
[2:43:31] and sometimes it's that they turn their
[2:43:32] face to the wall and they pray until God
[2:43:34] answers right there's so many different
[2:43:36] ways that God can move in our lives and
[2:43:38] it's just to sit back and say Lord I'll
[2:43:40] trust you and your timing in whichever
[2:43:41] way you want to do it amen amen stand on
[2:43:44] what you believe no matter the
[2:43:45] opposition that's what the Hebrew
[2:43:46] children did and when you do that when
[2:43:49] you stand we're so insured these days
[2:43:51] have you noticed that I think sometimes
[2:43:53] God has to hammer us so hard because
[2:43:55] we've got so many protections built in
[2:43:57] financially with our health with our
[2:43:58] jobs with our pensions and everything
[2:44:00] and we're so insured to the hilt
[2:44:03] that he almost has to kill us to get our
[2:44:04] attention sometimes because we can shrug
[2:44:06] off almost anything right the doctors
[2:44:08] are so good the technology is so good
[2:44:10] blah-blah-blah-blah-blah that he's
[2:44:12] almost got to murder us to get our
[2:44:14] attention sometimes you know but when
[2:44:16] you're all or nothing you're saying lord
[2:44:18] it's your word and I'm not gonna put an
[2:44:20] insurance plan in the backup that's what
[2:44:22] well oftentimes our issue is is that we
[2:44:24] say we believe the word but we've got a
[2:44:26] back-up plan just in case right if we're
[2:44:29] honest that's the way it is a lot of
[2:44:31] times especially I think the older folks
[2:44:33] maybe not so much but us younger folks
[2:44:34] and and you know the the 40 and under
[2:44:37] group it's true isn't it we say if it
[2:44:41] doesn't happen then we'll just do this
[2:44:42] right or we can do this or we can
[2:44:45] mitigate with this or we can kind of
[2:44:46] just smooth it over with that No
[2:44:48] all or nothing right if there's gonna be
[2:44:51] victory let it be real victory let it
[2:44:52] not be a half victory right and let it
[2:44:55] not be a half commitment let it not be a
[2:44:57] half purpose and let it not be a half
[2:44:58] ministry but let it be all the way a men
[2:45:00] and then what like Hannah prays God
[2:45:03] through it all alright
[2:45:05] those three Hebrew children I guarantee
[2:45:07] you they were having a jubilee time in
[2:45:09] that fire when God Himself comes down
[2:45:11] and stands next to you and I'm pretty
[2:45:13] sure he was saying guys you're amazing
[2:45:17] you are amazing like whoa wasn't sure
[2:45:21] you know not many people could do that
[2:45:23] you are amazing east I imagine he was
[2:45:25] there encouraging them and just
[2:45:27] expressing his pride that they had stood
[2:45:29] the test that's a test that's a test
[2:45:31] when you say my life is in your hands
[2:45:34] he says you stood the time and I'm so
[2:45:36] proud of you for that you know but as we
[2:45:40] look at these trials there's one thing
[2:45:41] and as we start to close that we've got
[2:45:44] to recognize and it goes back to the
[2:45:47] principle at the beginning and that's
[2:45:48] that if God brings a trial your way it
[2:45:51] has a purpose and when the purpose has
[2:45:54] been a tree achieved the trial has to
[2:45:57] cease right
[2:45:59] they sing that song it didn't come to
[2:46:01] stay it came to pass and sometimes we
[2:46:04] get into this place where we think this
[2:46:05] is just a never-ending trial that is my
[2:46:07] lot in life but when the purpose has
[2:46:09] been served remember God doesn't put
[2:46:11] suffering on us without a reason so when
[2:46:13] the reason has been met this suffering
[2:46:15] has to go away the trial has to cease
[2:46:17] amen so sometimes it's you know marital
[2:46:20] issues sometimes it's financial issues
[2:46:21] sometimes it's health issues I mean how
[2:46:23] many times do you hear somebody that
[2:46:25] says something like well maybe I'm meant
[2:46:26] to have this sickness on my life right
[2:46:28] they've got a chronic condition and
[2:46:30] they're saying well this is just my lot
[2:46:31] in life there isn't a single scripture
[2:46:35] in the New Testament and I say the New
[2:46:37] Testament because that's when Jesus gave
[2:46:38] us the New Covenant and that's when he
[2:46:40] said in my hand you know if they what
[2:46:42] follows the believers is what they lay
[2:46:43] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[2:46:45] right after that there is no place in
[2:46:48] scripture where you will find somebody
[2:46:50] that is made sick to stay sick I'm going
[2:46:54] to read you four scriptures Luke
[2:46:56] thirteen thirteen listen to this it's
[2:46:57] always for the glory and praise of God
[2:46:59] Luke thirteen thirteen says and he laid
[2:47:01] his hands on her
[2:47:02] immediately she was made straight and
[2:47:03] glorified God Luke 1715 says and one of
[2:47:07] them when he saw that he was healed
[2:47:08] turned back and with a loud voice
[2:47:09] glorified God Luke 23 47 says and when
[2:47:13] the Centurion saw what was done he
[2:47:15] glorified God saying certainly this was
[2:47:17] a righteous man John 11 forces when
[2:47:21] Jesus heard that he said this sickness
[2:47:22] is not unto death but for the glory of
[2:47:24] God that the Son of God might be
[2:47:26] glorified there by John 9 verse 2 and
[2:47:29] his disciples said asked him say master
[2:47:32] who did sin this man or his parents that
[2:47:33] he was born blind chronic condition
[2:47:36] jesus answered and said neither had this
[2:47:38] man sinned nor his parents but that the
[2:47:40] works of God should be made manifest in
[2:47:42] him amen
[2:47:45] listen to what brother Branham says
[2:47:46] beginning and ending of the Gentile
[2:47:48] dispensation he says now before you can
[2:47:50] have a victory there has to be a battle
[2:47:51] and if there's no battles there's no
[2:47:53] victories so we ought to be thankful for
[2:47:55] the battles and the trains and it's God
[2:47:57] giving us the opportunity to have
[2:47:59] victories so there's got to come a
[2:48:01] victory at the end of the trial right
[2:48:03] there's got to be a reason for the
[2:48:04] battle and the battle has to be is only
[2:48:05] over when the victories won amen he says
[2:48:08] all my doesn't that make you a little
[2:48:10] bit better now see the battle come along
[2:48:13] somebody say something bad about you
[2:48:14] sickness come on to you maybe God give
[2:48:16] you those light afflictions that he
[2:48:19] might heal you and show his favor to you
[2:48:21] let you see what he means by it and he
[2:48:25] says he loves you amen every trial was
[2:48:30] made to overcome for the Bram says this
[2:48:32] and the message experienced he says yes
[2:48:34] I believe the Word of God teaches
[2:48:35] healing for the body and the soul but
[2:48:39] not only that but God confirms the words
[2:48:41] with signed him signs and wonders
[2:48:42] following he says I will admit that God
[2:48:45] permits Satan sometimes to chastise us
[2:48:47] that's true but when that chastisement
[2:48:49] is through you come back to God God your
[2:48:52] father will heal you he says that's
[2:48:54] right
[2:48:55] there's nothing given to us that is
[2:48:57] meant to hold us for this life now I
[2:49:00] know somebody's saying what about Paul
[2:49:02] write that scripture it says Paul prayed
[2:49:05] and they asked God to take it away and
[2:49:06] he prayed three times and God said my
[2:49:08] grace is sufficient for you I'm glad you
[2:49:10] asked us brother branham answered it in
[2:49:12] the very next paragraph but let's read
[2:49:14] the scripture first and I'll read it
[2:49:15] again for the
[2:49:16] of time second Corinthians chapter 12
[2:49:18] verse 7 it says this is Paul speaking
[2:49:20] says unless I should be exalted above
[2:49:22] measure through the abundance of the
[2:49:23] revelations so Paul remembers gone out
[2:49:26] in the desert he's come back after three
[2:49:27] years and he says nobody can match me
[2:49:29] for what I know like nobody can teach me
[2:49:31] anything what God has given me is
[2:49:33] greater than as good or greater than
[2:49:35] anything out there he says he says the
[2:49:37] reason I have this issue is so that I
[2:49:39] don't get exalted Paul had an issue with
[2:49:41] humility you could say raid says and he
[2:49:44] says because of this I was get there was
[2:49:46] given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[2:49:48] messenger of Satan debuff at me lest I
[2:49:51] should be exalted above measure so God
[2:49:52] is allowed Satan to buff it Paul to keep
[2:49:57] him humble listen to this it says for
[2:50:00] this thing I besought the Lord thrice
[2:50:01] three times st. that it might depart
[2:50:04] from me and he said unto me my grace is
[2:50:06] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[2:50:08] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[2:50:10] therefore will I glory in my infirmities
[2:50:11] that the power of Christ may rest upon
[2:50:14] me that Paul says therefore I take
[2:50:16] pleasure in infirmities and reproaches
[2:50:17] and necessities and persecutions in
[2:50:19] distresses for Christ's sake for when I
[2:50:21] am weak then am i strong so people look
[2:50:24] at that and say well Paul was
[2:50:25] perpetually sick already had a none
[2:50:27] curable disease of some sort brother
[2:50:30] branham said this he said I will admit
[2:50:33] there's a sickness unto death he said
[2:50:35] and that's why prophetic gifts are in
[2:50:36] the church to know these things so what
[2:50:38] he's saying is if you're gonna die from
[2:50:39] it God will let you know that this is
[2:50:40] your time to go right and if he doesn't
[2:50:43] tell you it's your time to go then it's
[2:50:45] not yours to hold on to that's the
[2:50:48] bottom line he says but to say that our
[2:50:50] Father that a man that had rheumatism or
[2:50:53] arthritis say yes Lord I'm just glad to
[2:50:55] have it glad you gave it to me I embrace
[2:50:57] it I love it my glory and tribulation he
[2:51:00] said Paul's thorn in the flesh that was
[2:51:02] no more disease than nothing else he
[2:51:04] says if it wasn't healing he got well
[2:51:06] and he said the messenger of the devil
[2:51:08] will buff at me he said what does that
[2:51:09] word buff it mean blow after blow like a
[2:51:12] boxer just hitting him over and over and
[2:51:14] over again he says see then he healed
[2:51:16] him he got will well then he healed him
[2:51:18] again he got sick he healed him he got
[2:51:20] sick blow after blow he says he was
[2:51:21] healed got sick healed got sick heal got
[2:51:23] sick it was his back and forth thing and
[2:51:25] it was drove Paul nuts because he's like
[2:51:27] where's the healing
[2:51:28] he says I'll heal you
[2:51:29] then you're gonna be sick again and it's
[2:51:32] just gonna be back and forth back and
[2:51:33] forth you look at brother branham with
[2:51:35] his stomach trouble right so brother
[2:51:37] branham when he took the Lord at his
[2:51:39] word it took a year for his disease to
[2:51:41] go away and to where he could eat
[2:51:43] anything but he still had a weakness in
[2:51:46] his stomach if you remember all the way
[2:51:48] until he had that that time I believe it
[2:51:51] was in Sabino Canyon and then he saw the
[2:51:54] squirrel remember and if it had been
[2:51:55] killed and it said thy enemy is dead all
[2:51:58] right and he's and that was it that was
[2:52:00] his stomach trouble was done forever he
[2:52:01] talks about how his stomach lining had
[2:52:03] been all chewed up and everything and
[2:52:04] and so many issues but he said that was
[2:52:06] it and that was his healing right then
[2:52:08] and there so he the Lord had healed him
[2:52:10] of the initial issue but he had a
[2:52:11] weakness in his body much like Paul did
[2:52:13] for the rest of his life and there was
[2:52:14] just grace to cover that but then he
[2:52:16] said boom it was done and this is Jenna
[2:52:18] I was nineteen sixty five or sixty I
[2:52:20] think was 65 so it's right at the end
[2:52:22] but God still said you're not you're not
[2:52:25] going you're not going to the grave with
[2:52:27] this all right I'm gonna heal you of it
[2:52:29] right
[2:52:30] brother Brian continues this he's
[2:52:31] speaking of a minister not an you know a
[2:52:34] nominal minister said he says he's
[2:52:36] twisted it to say sickness was of God
[2:52:38] that we should welcome them
[2:52:39] he says if God gives it to us just
[2:52:41] testify and spit dust in the devil's
[2:52:43] face and say I can stand it and bear it
[2:52:45] for God put it upon us for his glory
[2:52:47] brother Graham says who I can't see that
[2:52:50] he says that's not the gospel of my Lord
[2:52:52] Jesus Christ he said God is not the
[2:52:54] author of sickness you can't pin that on
[2:52:57] my father he came to heal us the devil
[2:53:00] is the one who makes us sick he says
[2:53:01] absolutely if we're going through these
[2:53:05] trials for victory the character of
[2:53:08] Christ then when you've got it whatever
[2:53:11] else is left has to flee and then it has
[2:53:13] to go before the word of God nothing can
[2:53:16] stand before him when you're where you
[2:53:18] need to be amen there has to be an end
[2:53:19] to that situation each and every time
[2:53:22] LeBron said this the musicians can come
[2:53:26] he says you told us how it's done
[2:53:28] speaking of Christ he says you didn't
[2:53:30] only tell us but you showed us how it
[2:53:31] was done
[2:53:32] you led us you showed us how to do it
[2:53:34] receive the word inside of us and be
[2:53:37] sure to hold to that word it is written
[2:53:39] in every temptation he says but be
[2:53:41] humble walk humbly
[2:53:43] then we have conquered through you
[2:53:45] through your power which has already
[2:53:47] conquered our enemy and the only thing
[2:53:49] we have to do is just walk humble with
[2:53:50] faith believing that and our badge of
[2:53:53] identification of the Holy Ghost he says
[2:53:55] and Satan has to move and then when
[2:53:59] Christ is revealed in you the trial is
[2:54:00] over remember what we talked about at
[2:54:02] the revealing of Jesus Christ when
[2:54:04] that's revealed that trials over and you
[2:54:06] get to move on to the next one in the
[2:54:07] next one I'm gonna read what brother
[2:54:09] Branham quoted there earlier in first
[2:54:11] Peter 4 it says beloved think it not
[2:54:14] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[2:54:16] is to try you as though some strange
[2:54:17] thing had happened to you but rejoice in
[2:54:20] as much as ye are partakers of Christ's
[2:54:22] sufferings that when his glory shall be
[2:54:24] revealed
[2:54:25] where in you when his glory shall be
[2:54:28] revealed that ye may be glad also with
[2:54:31] exceeding joy amen let's just stand
[2:54:35] together I can honestly say in the past
[2:54:38] three years I've probably grown more in
[2:54:41] the previous 15 with what God's been
[2:54:43] putting me through in different
[2:54:44] situations and and whatnot but I'll tell
[2:54:49] you when you go through it and you start
[2:54:50] to step out in faith and you start to
[2:54:52] recognize what he's doing it gives you a
[2:54:54] faith to move on to the next challenge
[2:54:56] because you start to see that he's
[2:54:58] moving and he's working and he's got a
[2:55:00] plan and he has a purpose and all of a
[2:55:03] sudden you almost get worried when
[2:55:04] things aren't going badly you know it's
[2:55:07] kind of messed up in a way but in he's
[2:55:10] not pushing you you're almost like we
[2:55:12] got a rapture to make we need to get
[2:55:14] back to the battle you know I'm thankful
[2:55:16] for the trip for that for the downtime
[2:55:18] don't get me wrong but it's almost like
[2:55:20] things are cranking up more and more and
[2:55:22] more and it's just one thing after
[2:55:24] another after another but I take heart
[2:55:26] in that because if your heart is clean
[2:55:27] if your heart is clear your conscience
[2:55:29] is clear then you know that it's all
[2:55:31] working out for your good and so you
[2:55:33] have to look in - he's got a plan he's
[2:55:36] got a purpose he's got something he's
[2:55:37] trying to work out in this situation and
[2:55:39] so you just pull your hands off and you
[2:55:40] say Lord it's in your hands show me what
[2:55:42] you want me to learn show me what your
[2:55:44] purpose is show me what your plan is and
[2:55:46] I'll rejoice in the meantime and then
[2:55:48] that's where we want to be is where we
[2:55:49] can say Lord whatever you're doing
[2:55:51] you're doing it well and I'm gonna trust
[2:55:54] you and then
[2:55:56] and then more precious than gold is when
[2:55:58] we can say Lord I value what you have
[2:56:00] for me more than what I think it should
[2:56:02] be amen
[2:56:03] when we put him his way of doing things
[2:56:05] his thinking above our own and we see
[2:56:08] that mind of Christ and we just say I
[2:56:10] have no thought coming there's a quote
[2:56:13] that I meant to read in our service the
[2:56:15] other night at home but where the Brad
[2:56:17] talked about the church he said and he
[2:56:19] said you know it's a latest see an age
[2:56:20] of rights he says you have no rights you
[2:56:23] have nothing says you have to surrender
[2:56:25] it to Christ and let him do the work and
[2:56:27] that's where we want to be tonight amen
[2:56:28] in this trial of our faith it's precious
[2:56:30] when we say and we can surrender and say
[2:56:33] Lord this one's all up to you you're not
[2:56:35] going to get to heaven on your own
[2:56:36] merits you're not gonna figure out your
[2:56:38] way into a rapture I mean that's gonna
[2:56:39] be a move of grace exactly brother Joel
[2:56:42] it's gonna be grace from start to finish
[2:56:43] amen it says grace so his brother Ram
[2:56:46] said it shows that he favors us when he
[2:56:48] gives us these things amen let's just
[2:56:50] bow our heads together
[2:56:52] Heavenly Father Lord we are thankful for
[2:56:54] your presence tonight we're thankful for
[2:56:56] a people Lord that will pull on the word
[2:56:58] that will Lord listen or not just listen
[2:57:01] but apply it to their lives Lord Jesus
[2:57:02] Lord we pray now that your spirit would
[2:57:05] just have control lord over each heart
[2:57:07] and soul Lord that you would just move
[2:57:09] on the different ones that are here Lord
[2:57:10] that you administer to their lives Lord
[2:57:13] as they've heard and listen Lord Lord as
[2:57:15] our hearts have been pricked or maybe
[2:57:16] their faith has been challenged maybe
[2:57:18] it's been lifted up Lord may you just
[2:57:20] move in each heart and soul and confirm
[2:57:21] yourself to them individually Lord God
[2:57:24] Lord just bless your people now as we
[2:57:26] worship you for a while but may your
[2:57:28] spirit just be so sweet and wonderful or
[2:57:31] maybe we just so thankful to be here and
[2:57:33] to know that you are a real God Lord in
[2:57:35] to have an experience that confirms it
[2:57:37] in our hearts and our lives no god bless
[2:57:39] your people now we pray in Jesus
[2:57:41] Christ's name we ask any men we know
[2:57:46] that some through it all through it all
[2:57:47] I've learned to trust in Jesus
[2:57:53] through it all
[2:57:59] through it all trust in Jesus I learned
[2:58:11] to trust me

[3:06:59] Lord
[3:06:59] wonderful joint award tonight I was
[3:07:03] wonderful wonderful amen
[3:07:05] you know and I loved it I loved the
[3:07:07] story I loved the story about the three
[3:07:10] Hebrew children I think so I think it's
[3:07:13] just a great story but what came out one
[3:07:15] of the things that came out to me
[3:07:16] tonight was it was this that while those
[3:07:19] soldiers brother John was describing
[3:07:21] we're trying to bring two Hebrew
[3:07:23] children into the litter fire they were
[3:07:26] falling they were they were they were
[3:07:28] dying and all approach to me is that
[3:07:32] Satan is a defeated enemy all right
[3:07:36] he's already defeated that's what it
[3:07:38] means right so a lot of times we just
[3:07:40] don't we don't think about that a lot of
[3:07:43] ministries say the same we preach the
[3:07:45] same thing that I've heard over the
[3:07:46] years Satan is a defeated enemy
[3:07:49] praise the Lord that's why it's going
[3:07:50] around as a roaring life but greater is
[3:07:53] He that's it right
[3:07:55] greater is he right pray some of we're a
[3:07:58] privileged people we just forget that
[3:08:00] sometimes
[3:08:00] amen amen this same twelve hundred and
[3:08:04] ten I think it is refiners fire praise
[3:08:09] the Lord
[3:08:12] you're
[3:08:13] [Music]
