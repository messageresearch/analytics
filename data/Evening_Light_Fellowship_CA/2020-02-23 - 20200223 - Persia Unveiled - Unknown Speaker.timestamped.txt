[26:53] and what he'll sing it again all
[26:58] forever
[27:01] praise the Lord
[27:13] [Music]
[27:25] hey Matt praise the Lord we worship Him
[27:29] and him only amen he is the Lord of our
[27:32] lives
[27:33] he is our leadership by the grace of God
[27:36] our Lord Jesus Christ
[27:37] I trust my grace we still feel toward
[27:40] him as they did 2,000 years ago the
[27:43] disciples did or if they did it fifty
[27:45] years ago and a hundred years ago that
[27:47] we still feel that that love for the
[27:49] Lord Jesus Christ
[27:50] a man is getting to a place in the world
[27:53] there's more and more emphasis on the
[27:54] natural and less than the spiritual a
[27:57] man brother our faith in Jesus is being
[28:00] challenged and the power of God to say
[28:03] it's going to go on to that amen
[28:05] due to your faith in God not just Jesus
[28:07] but God do you believe God do you
[28:10] believe in God and so on so we're living
[28:13] in a world that doesn't we're living in
[28:15] a world that's under the control of
[28:16] another God and that was the sermon that
[28:18] I want to do but some messages on but we
[28:22] don't want someone once started not
[28:23] today and it is the god of this evil age
[28:26] and brother it is it is tremendous I
[28:29] pray God help us to catch the revelation
[28:32] of what we're facing in this hour we're
[28:34] not going to get caught up with the God
[28:36] of this evil aids just get caught up
[28:37] with the god of righteousness a man with
[28:40] the God as it is in the word in the
[28:42] beginning was the word and the Word was
[28:45] with God and the Word was God
[28:47] a man and the Word was made flesh amen
[28:51] to redeem us but brother we're hearing
[28:54] more less than less and less about Jesus
[28:56] that's right because the god of this
[28:58] world is getting the attention of the
[29:00] world
[29:00] amen and the things of the world so god
[29:03] help us is my prayer
[29:05] amen so the Lord willing
[29:09] instead of ministering on these these
[29:11] thoughts here and God your God of this
[29:13] evil age and also another message after
[29:16] this was Satan's Eden
[29:17] so are we really aware of what's going
[29:21] on in the world today not just saying I
[29:24] believe the message but are you aware
[29:25] what's going on over there
[29:27] and the deceit that's going on and
[29:30] knowing that it's also affecting many
[29:32] so-called believers that under that
[29:34] spirit they're under the anointing of
[29:36] the God on this evil age there is Satan
[29:38] see not Godsey a man so I pray the grace
[29:42] of God to be able to be on our guard by
[29:46] grace amen
[29:48] and again like I said there's tremendous
[29:50] and it struck me when I was going
[29:52] through it yesterday again on the
[29:55] message godless evil age Oh Laurie oh my
[29:59] I still don't help me the things that
[30:01] the public was saying and what he was
[30:04] correcting the people and and again it
[30:07] is in his own church but I'm tired when
[30:09] I get he's laying it in laying it in
[30:12] laid it in and judging thin amen
[30:15] so brother I pray God that we're going
[30:17] to judge ourselves by the word not not
[30:21] religion not in our hate somebody in our
[30:23] hearts and he brings that out in this
[30:25] message and he's remember he said the
[30:27] outside man is physical and he's in the
[30:29] inside man is spiritual a man but he
[30:32] said let's not lean you on the physical
[30:33] things but listen let's focus on the
[30:35] spiritual
[30:37] Germany are still caught up with the
[30:39] natural things of life and really their
[30:41] only living for this world they're just
[30:43] living for themselves deliver for family
[30:46] deliver who's living for Jesus who is
[30:49] living for God who is living for for the
[30:52] world to come who's living for the
[30:54] rapture and who's looking for the
[30:56] resurrection a man oh well brother Brown
[30:59] said you know if I knew he was coming in
[31:01] the morning I go and I got a glutton do
[31:03] finally not go out and do it yes but you
[31:05] work with the with the consciousness
[31:06] that the raptures and the resurrection
[31:08] is that he or you can never believe you
[31:11] got the Holy Ghost you won't forget it
[31:13] you got the Holy Ghost and keep your
[31:15] mindful of it
[31:15] oh yeah no way are you are easy gonna
[31:18] let you go a day without thinking about
[31:21] the resurrection without thinking about
[31:22] the rapture no no he's gonna be
[31:24] constantly bringing you the revelation
[31:26] of the word a man to make us more and
[31:29] more conscious of the resurrection
[31:31] you got listen if you want it you've got
[31:33] to be conscious of it it's not just
[31:35] where they waited your own way through
[31:37] this this happens that happens then all
[31:38] of a sudden God's going to do this yes
[31:40] he is but it's going to it's going to
[31:42] affect and influence those there are
[31:44] conscious of it amen
[31:46] they're walking in the spirit living in
[31:49] the spirit and rather they can't go a
[31:51] day without thinking about the rapture
[31:52] they can't go a day without thinking
[31:54] about the resurrection why because they
[31:57] want to get out of here
[31:58] and you're happy here you're contending
[32:01] this world something wrong brother
[32:04] you're not part of the bride revival a

[32:18] serious more sobering amen and we've
[32:22] been instructed that way if we are
[32:24] children of the day none of the night we
[32:25] got to be sober and we will be we are
[32:27] sober that shows that we're children of
[32:30] the day and we see what's going on hey

[33:25] yesterday afternoon she knew us she knew
[33:30] me she knew Betty but she doesn't know
[33:33] everything that's going on hey man so we
[33:37] just said some little fellowship with
[33:38] her not much because she's not able to
[33:41] communicate with family or friends she
[33:45] suggests her mind is not with it and
[33:47] that she has expressed to her daughter
[33:49] that she wants to die so maybe she will
[33:54] because she is suffering from pneumonia
[33:58] cancer and a broken hip and that's why
[34:03] she ended up in the hospitals now he's
[34:05] because last week she fell down and
[34:08] broke her hip or either that as they as
[34:11] we've been informed that many people
[34:13] don't fall and break their hip when it
[34:16] comes to senior citizens they break
[34:17] their hip and fall a man it's just just
[34:20] the nature of the body at the time of
[34:22] age and so Jessie she fell and she broke
[34:26] her hip and I appreciate the fact that
[34:28] what she's done for us over the years
[34:30] she's appreciate she's respected us
[34:33] respected our faith and she she's helped
[34:36] so many people
[34:37] but it's amazing grace that's right
[34:41] she's experienced the death of so many
[34:43] family members it's absolutely amazing
[34:47] none of us had that experience that she
[34:50] experienced when it comes to the death
[34:52] not just of her mother but some of her
[34:55] brothers sisters sons daughters or she's
[34:58] experienced death she's dealt with it
[35:00] for many years

[35:04] looked after her daughter for a number
[35:07] of years the daughter that has suffered
[35:09] a stroke and a funny and when she was in
[35:13] her early 40s
[35:14] the daughter died yeah she looked after
[35:16] sister Betty's Aunt Betty

[37:54] every day a man you hear the news every
[37:57] day but somebody would have gone
[37:58] somebody killed this one somebody killed
[37:59] that one or somebody did this or that
[38:01] because the world is insane it is grace
[38:06] of God her brother and we take our stand
[38:09] the more we take our stand the more
[38:11] they're going to oppose this grace and
[38:14] having stone Paul they drew him out of
[38:17] the city supposing he had been dead
[38:21] howbeit as the disciples stood round
[38:23] about him he rose up and came into the
[38:26] city and the next day a man he didn't go
[38:31] home he kept on going in the gospel a
[38:35] man and it says he went into the city
[38:38] and next day he departed with Barnabas
[38:40] and derbe and when they had preached the
[38:43] gospel in that city and had taught many
[38:46] they returned again to Lystra and to
[38:49] Iconium and Antioch
[38:52] confirming the souls of the disciples a
[38:55] mayor and exhorting them to continue in
[38:58] the faith so Paul kept on preaching with
[39:02] the other Brethren encouraged him to
[39:04] stay with it don't let what happened to
[39:06] him discourage you don't let what
[39:08] happened to William Branham discourage
[39:10] us there's not think old because they
[39:12] rejected him well maybe the the word is
[39:15] not true the word is true as I say that
[39:17] they they even did it online the
[39:20] Internet and they said how can we
[39:22] reconcile William Branham signs and
[39:24] wonders and miracles with the what he's
[39:26] preaching and what he's teaching yeah
[39:28] they couldn't reconcile that what do you
[39:30] think have you seen what they saw and it
[39:33] was not a man it was God in the man
[39:35] doing it and hearing what they heard you
[39:37] think if the signs and wonders was God
[39:40] the Word was God a man there's pressure
[39:43] the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ
[39:45] but they turned it down
[39:48] many a breacher and just ignored it
[39:51] because why got there well first aid
[39:54] they wanted william branham william
[39:55] branham widow brown because of his signs
[39:57] and wonders but when he began to put
[39:59] more and more emphasis on the word they
[40:01] began to withdraw from Windham Bridal
[40:03] yeah
[40:04] even certain preachers that I could
[40:05] mention and they're gone on now and they
[40:09] were they wanted to go brother round
[40:11] there but after they didn't want we
[40:13] didn't brand him no no because of what
[40:15] he was teaching that was the other
[40:17] evangelist and brother branham of course
[40:20] highlighted the fact that there's coming
[40:23] false prophets he still show sighing
[40:26] great signs and wonders and he said to
[40:28] deceive the people they see the very
[40:29] elect if possible but they want to seed
[40:32] the elect but they are to see and have
[40:34] deceived a lot of people so the grace of
[40:36] God to the bride to stay with the word
[40:39] amen but it's just the disciples here
[40:42] including Paul was confirming the souls
[40:44] of the disciples and exhorting them to
[40:47] continue in the faith and that we must
[40:50] we must through much tribulation enter
[40:54] into the kingdom of God amen
[40:58] or you can choose it or not you can say
[41:01] yes I'm going to continue with the word
[41:03] knowing that it's going to what it's
[41:04] going to bring to you knowing the
[41:06] opposition you're going to get a man but
[41:09] we must through much tribulation enter
[41:11] into the kingdom by the grace of God a
[41:14] man so brother that we're going to take
[41:16] our stain for the truth we're gonna take
[41:18] our stain for the word in this day and
[41:20] in this hour brother regardless of the
[41:23] opposition that will face and again as
[41:26] the power of God I warned us he said the
[41:28] hour is coming he said when you we won't
[41:29] be allowed to preach this and he's you
[41:32] won't be allowed easy to even pray for
[41:34] the sick no well yeah cool that's on us
[41:39] now god help us we're seeing so little
[41:42] spiritual moves there's a lot of
[41:45] religious a lot of religion but not much
[41:48] spiritual that's why I don't feel the
[41:53] anointing like I did
[41:56] back in the days of our cottage meetings
[41:59] yeah no it's not there why because the
[42:03] spirited was drawing from the earth and
[42:05] if he's worth drawing I trust we're
[42:07] withdrawing amen if he's if he's going
[42:10] out we're going out
[42:12] praise the Lord that's that's the
[42:13] evidence we're on our way out not not
[42:16] just settle here and well we're not
[42:17] going yet we're not going yes well we're
[42:19] going we're on our way that's why we're
[42:22] here
[42:22] pressing on by the grace of God the
[42:25] upward way amen
[42:28] so it is tremendous so I pray grace that
[42:31] we'll have the same faith that they did
[42:32] here in the first stage the same faith
[42:34] in Luther had Wesley had the pentacle
[42:36] early Pentecostals a man there
[42:38] regardless of opposition regardless of
[42:41] persecution we're gonna stay with it
[42:43] exactly oh yeah I mean you're going to
[42:49] pass the test yeah just think of it you
[42:54] won't be allowed to do this you won't be
[42:55] allowed to do that and now a that that
[42:58] did those that don't exactly believe
[43:01] what you believe they're gonna be
[43:03] challenged don't you get involved with
[43:05] that brother or that sister this person
[43:07] or that person because of what they
[43:09] really oh yeah you may have people there
[43:13] now oh yeah that's good they they show
[43:16] me a favor yeah but the diet the day is
[43:17] coming when they won't be allowed to
[43:19] show your favor
[43:20] amen as it was in the days of Jesus as
[43:24] it was in the days of Paul they weren't
[43:25] allowed to express their public
[43:28] agreement with Paul a public agreement
[43:31] with with Peter no no no they got to the
[43:35] place where they said we're concerning
[43:37] the disciples they said don't preach in
[43:39] the name of Jesus yeah
[43:42] don't you do that don't mention Jesus
[43:44] don't do this when when Peter and and
[43:46] all the other disciples were arrested
[43:48] and and brought before the government
[43:49] and the council and so on and brothers
[43:51] same things going to happen ear don't
[43:54] preach this don't preach that don't go
[43:55] mentioning those things you can preach
[43:57] just basic Christianity oh Jesus Jesus
[44:00] died for us yeah that's it yeah you
[44:03] could take it or leave it
[44:04] no there's more to it than that
[44:09] so that it's the the ministry went to
[44:12] confirm the souls of the disciples and
[44:15] exhorting them to continue in the faith
[44:18] how many are continuing into the faith
[44:20] of the revealed Word not many they
[44:23] settled into an organized religion it's
[44:26] a denomination to them but how many are
[44:28] continuing in it so that it controls you
[44:30] more and more you're a prisoner to the
[44:32] word amen not many because few are going
[44:39] to find it
[44:40] few are going into rapture the prophet
[44:43] of God warned us and just saying well it
[44:45] might be 500 well that's a that's that's
[44:49] not many there could be even 2,000
[44:51] around the world and where'd they all
[44:54] come from brother as we go into this
[44:57] film
[44:58] concerning the the true story of our
[45:03] believers who suffer persecution and the
[45:06] threat of death in the country of Iran
[45:10] he said but they escaped God brought him
[45:12] out I've been thinking about believers
[45:15] I've been praying for believers in Iran
[45:17] I said lord I said I don't know what's
[45:19] going on I said but I said you do so I
[45:22] pray your grace brother we think we
[45:24] think what are we suffering compared to
[45:27] what others are suffering in Iran in
[45:29] those in some European countries some
[45:31] Asian countries and so on whether God
[45:33] have mercy on us if we go going for
[45:36] Nadia and and not to consider our
[45:38] brothers and sisters in other countries
[45:41] amen
[45:42] there are brothers and sisters that are
[45:44] risking their lives yeah they can't they
[45:48] can't have education they can't do work
[45:49] they can't do this they can't do that
[45:51] why because their stand for the word God
[45:53] Elfa grace
[46:00] so brother we must through much
[46:03] tribulation enter into the kingdom of
[46:06] God amen turn with me to second Timothy
[46:10] chapter 2 we try not to be too long
[46:15] because of the business part that we
[46:17] want at the end of the services amen
[46:21] but I can go as long as the business
[46:23] meeting I guess let me see how long our
[46:27] brother Mark will take 2nd Timothy 3 and
[46:39] this concerns the day of the hour that
[46:41] we're living in this know also that in
[46:44] the last days perilous times shall come
[46:48] and there here for men shall be lovers
[46:51] of their own selves and they are
[46:54] covetous very covetous world and they
[46:58] are boasters they're proud they're
[47:01] blasphemers their disobedient to parents
[47:03] unthankful unholy we're living in that
[47:07] world god help us to be spiritual
[47:11] without natural affection that natural
[47:16] love of men is wax cold is that that
[47:20] care and concern for one another is not
[47:22] there anymore
[47:22] not like it used to be no no one-time
[47:26] believers live for believers oh yeah
[47:28] don't mean living for the living brother
[47:30] they're brothers sisters in Christ and
[47:32] the Bible tells us that in the book of
[47:34] Acts Oh after after the baptism of the
[47:36] Holy Ghost amen and God will started
[47:39] that revival
[47:39] oh the Saints just went from house to
[47:41] house to house to house house believers
[47:43] yeah they're there to help believers
[47:46] they're there to bless believers they're
[47:48] there to encourage believers there to
[47:50] pray for believers but now the world is
[47:54] without natural affection and they are
[47:56] trucebreakers they are false accusers
[47:59] and they are incontinent fierce and
[48:03] despisers of those that are good that's
[48:08] the truth even believers got that
[48:09] attitude some professing believers they
[48:12] displace those that are
[48:13] good those are really there with the
[48:15] right attitude and the right spirit all
[48:17] right you look down at him ah don't
[48:20] bother them well Christ bother crisis
[48:24] with them and brothers not them it's
[48:26] Christ in them amen they're despisers of
[48:31] those that are good the religious people
[48:33] are despising those that are spiritual
[48:35] and it says traitors Eddie I minded
[48:41] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[48:44] God that's the truth there were two give
[48:48] more time to the pleasures of this world
[48:49] than they are to God and to worship this
[48:54] Wright brothers getting less and less
[48:55] and less you talk about a form of
[48:59] godliness that's what it leads to
[49:03] and it says mothers are pleasure more
[49:07] than lovers of god having a form of
[49:10] godliness but denying the power thereof
[49:16] see brothers come down to the word not
[49:20] feelings but it's the faith the
[49:22] revelation of the word what drawled what
[49:26] pulled a lot of people back years ago
[49:28] was feeling the anointing was there they
[49:31] wanted this they wanted that but it's
[49:33] all moving away a man and now it's just
[49:35] just the word now feelings is the word
[49:39] faith without faith it is impossible to
[49:44] please him grace having a form of
[49:50] godliness yeah
[49:52] even around the message but denying the
[49:55] power thereof from such turn away a
[49:59] greater and a greater separation is
[50:01] coming for this
[50:06] are they which crypt into houses and led
[50:09] captive silly women laden with sins led
[50:12] away with divers lusts ever learning
[50:15] never able to come to the knowledge of
[50:18] the truth there ever learning the
[50:19] message but they're not coming to the
[50:21] truth the rapture the resurrection the
[50:25] coming of the Lord the marriage supper
[50:27] of the Lamb now as Janice and Jambres
[50:30] withstood Moses so do these also resist
[50:33] the truth and you're under the anointing
[50:35] of the God of this evil age amazing God
[50:42] help us to be on our guard thank God for
[50:46] the revelation has given us a man that
[50:50] he's restored our sight spiritually
[50:55] their men are corrupt Minds reprobate
[50:58] concerning the faith but they shall
[51:01] proceed no further for their folly shall
[51:03] be manifest unto all men as theirs also
[51:06] was but there was fully known my
[51:08] doctrine man of light purpose faith
[51:12] long-suffering charity patience a man
[51:17] so do we understand one another's manner
[51:19] of life purpose understand one another's
[51:22] faith long-suffering charity patience
[51:26] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[51:31] me at Antioch and Iconium at Lystra
[51:33] which persecutions I endured god help us
[51:37] to endure when the pressure increases
[51:41] will endure but out of them all the Lord
[51:45] delivered me God's with you to bring you
[51:49] through it yay and all that will live
[51:54] godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[51:57] persecution if you're not living godly
[52:00] in christ you won't experience it if
[52:02] you're living godly in Christ Jesus you
[52:04] will suffer persecution that's the word
[52:10] evil men and seducers shall wax worse
[52:12] and worse deceiving and being to see
[52:16] what a wall will live in in but continue
[52:19] thou in the things which thou has
[52:20] learned and has been assured of knowing
[52:22] of whom thou hast learned them and that
[52:26] from a child there has known the Holy
[52:29] Scriptures which are able to make thee
[52:31] wise unto salvation through faith which
[52:35] is in Christ Jesus amen
[52:39] god bless our hearts his word amen as we
[52:42] go in to consider what believers in
[52:47] other countries are enduring what they
[52:50] have suffered oh my I get the email on a
[52:55] regular basis from those that are that
[53:00] are considering believers around the
[53:03] world paying a price for their faith
[53:06] brothers not so much in Canada not so
[53:09] much in America not yet but it will come
[53:11] it'll come on our doorstep it definitely
[53:14] will but brother this persecution for
[53:18] other believers in other countries and
[53:20] I'm not surprised
[53:22] of course none of us surprised regarding
[53:23] Iran and what's going on there but again
[53:27] it's in a number of Asian countries and
[53:28] European countries a man that this
[53:31] persecution of believers is going on and
[53:34] it says that this is the story of God's
[53:37] supernatural work and it says bringing
[53:39] Iranian Muslims to the faith in Christ
[53:43] praise the name of the Lord all the
[53:46] father's give me will come he won't lose
[53:47] none amen
[53:50] so here the message of the hour now
[53:52] thrives in the country of Turkey where
[53:54] these refugees live and serve the Lord
[53:57] persecution beatings captivity are only
[54:01] a few of the many orders those
[54:03] Christians have faced amen we haven't
[54:08] faced it but they are they have and they
[54:11] are and there's other believers around
[54:13] the world now in that I've noted too
[54:15] that there's even teenagers have laid
[54:18] down their life for Jesus
[54:21] what to our young people to identify
[54:24] with that to know that that they got
[54:27] freedom here do you can do this you can
[54:30] do that but there are other teenagers in
[54:32] other parts of the world that have
[54:34] recently been killed

[55:03] man be persecuted not allowed to have a
[55:06] were ever job not allowed to do this not

[55:08] yeah but they're more than willing to
[55:12] endure that persecution and that
[55:13] tribulation and they're more than
[55:16] willing to become a martyr for Jesus
[55:19] even in these last days there are
[55:22] believers that are laying down their
[55:24] lives physically for Jesus god help us
[55:28] we'll make greater and greater
[55:30] sacrifices for the Lord amen
[55:41] he said God will judge you by what kind
[55:45] of a spirit you got in you and he should
[55:51] not judge you by your body but by your
[55:55] spirit the inner main or you can be like

[1:01:14] their forgiveness that's where it trust
[1:01:17] us that's where he got the holy spirit
[1:01:20] when somebody says something evil
[1:01:22] against someone sometimes it claims I
[1:01:25] have to always burn how I get even with
[1:01:27] her if it takes me my last day
[1:01:30] now there's where you check about your
[1:01:33] whole sphere
[1:01:33] [Music]
[1:01:36] blessed are you when man shall say all
[1:01:38] manner of evil against she falls it for

[1:02:05] Oh

[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:26] unlike what people think is not living
[1:02:30] in deserts and riding camels that's for
[1:02:32] sure here gives a modern country if you
[1:02:37] go to Tehran you will see many luxury
[1:02:42] commerce industry like variety is no
[1:02:44] Maseratis is it's not strange to see
[1:02:47] that especially noir terror and that's a
[1:02:51] kind of life salt onions half
[1:02:58] [Music]
[1:03:01] but being a Christian living in Iran is
[1:03:03] quite different when you're a Christian
[1:03:07] and government finds out about your
[1:03:09] belief and faith your earmarked so you
[1:03:14] have to always look over your shoulder
[1:03:17] they will mark you you cannot get a job
[1:03:20] any government related agencies work for
[1:03:23] God on a roll that's for sure and even
[1:03:25] when you apply for business certificate
[1:03:28] or any kind of permission and they will
[1:03:31] give me a hard time and they'll make
[1:03:34] make your life miserable
[1:03:36] as much as they can
[1:03:42] in my experience working in Turkey with
[1:03:45] Iranian refugees I've come to the
[1:03:49] understanding that there's not many
[1:03:51] nations in the world that are more
[1:03:54] hostile to the gospel than the nation of
[1:03:57] Iran believers there are facing constant
[1:04:01] persecution and they're in constant
[1:04:03] danger because of their faith both
[1:04:05] danger from the government and from
[1:04:08] regular citizens throughout Society
[1:04:11] [Music]
[1:04:21] Iran historically speaking was a sour
[1:04:24] Austrian country they followed that
[1:04:28] religion they had their own priestly
[1:04:30] class they had their own scriptures
[1:04:34] called Avista and you know it's about
[1:04:37] love and doing good works and don't
[1:04:41] those kind of things and it's belief in
[1:04:43] one God but they have many idolatrous
[1:04:47] act actions within that but historically
[1:04:50] they were Zoroastrian acero Austrians
[1:04:52] and then as time went on the gospel
[1:04:55] actually went to Iran with the Apostles
[1:04:59] and it spread greatly there around the
[1:05:03] Year 500 there was a huge persecution
[1:05:06] that took place in Iran because those
[1:05:09] are Austrians were being overcome by the
[1:05:12] Christian faith and so five hundred
[1:05:15] thousand Iranian Christians were
[1:05:17] persecuted and killed during that time
[1:05:21] period and so it wasn't more than 150
[1:05:23] years later that Islam came and went
[1:05:28] through and conquered the the lands of
[1:05:31] Persia a would would have been the
[1:05:33] sassanid empire that would have covered
[1:05:35] Mesopotamia Persia into India
[1:05:38] Afghanistan Pakistan and so forth so
[1:05:42] these countries were eventually
[1:05:44] conquered by the Arab Muslims and Persia
[1:05:47] fell with a great persecution I mean
[1:05:50] literally they had lines of people lined
[1:05:52] up to come forward and say will you
[1:05:54] convert to Islam and if the answer is no
[1:05:57] they behead them right there and so this
[1:06:00] was a this is the way that they forced
[1:06:02] Iran ian's to become
[1:06:04] Muslims and there's a resentment between
[1:06:08] Persians and Arabs to this day you know
[1:06:12] we think well aren't aren't they all
[1:06:14] Arabs do not ever say an Iranian is an
[1:06:18] Arab the Iranians hate Arabs Arabs hate
[1:06:21] Iranians we see this in the world today
[1:06:24] with our president going to the Middle
[1:06:27] East and he's gathering all the Arabs
[1:06:29] together and and they're all speaking
[1:06:31] terrible about how bad ear on is and if
[1:06:34] you want to talk if you want to unite
[1:06:36] the Arabs together just talk about how
[1:06:38] bad Iran is

[1:11:49] that's it I came across New Testament
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:12:22] apostasy means leaving the faith so in
[1:12:28] in in Islam someone who is born as a
[1:12:33] Muslim or converts to Islam if they
[1:12:36] choose to leave Islam for for no
[1:12:40] religion or for another religion
[1:12:43] they say they're in a pot they've
[1:12:45] committed apostasy and so if they if
[1:12:48] they were born a Muslim were converted
[1:12:50] to Islam and they leave Islam they're an
[1:12:52] apostate and it says apostates are
[1:12:55] worthy of the death penalty
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:12:59] the first day that I went to the church
[1:13:02] as a newcomer was a day it was a Friday
[1:13:06] then I remembered the night before we
[1:13:09] were already errors at my pastor and it
[1:13:13] was a harassment wave around around the
[1:13:17] country brother Xiang he was a resident
[1:13:19] Petrus was arrested and many other
[1:13:22] people were arrested by the time that
[1:13:24] was the first day that I go to the
[1:13:25] church as a Christian and the webblock
[1:13:28] Asians were standing outside the door
[1:13:29] taking pictures who comes up with those
[1:13:32] so it was my first experience in church
[1:13:35] so years after that I knew what's going
[1:13:41] on I was a close friend of my pastor we
[1:13:44] used to walk together so I knew things
[1:13:47] that other people didn't know what's
[1:13:50] going on what pressure of Ibaka's Brina
[1:13:53] to the church so another thing that they
[1:13:56] did before my pastor goes to report to
[1:13:59] their to the office in Shiraz he asked
[1:14:03] us to disappear if he got arrested and
[1:14:07] said nobody will judge you just
[1:14:08] disappear and it's important for you
[1:14:13] guys to be out and minister to people I
[1:14:16] don't want you to imprison and so forth
[1:14:19] and he was arrested and we knew that
[1:14:24] we're gonna be next so I had a meeting
[1:14:27] in one place was me and two other
[1:14:30] brothers I said no this is what the
[1:14:33] pastor said but it's honestly like no
[1:14:38] matter where we go here in this country
[1:14:40] and we gonna arrest I'll be in the
[1:14:44] church and you're more than welcome to
[1:14:46] leave and there's no hard feeling nobody
[1:14:49] would judge you and I'll take full
[1:14:52] responsibility
[1:14:53] [Music]
[1:14:55] so have really came to agreement
[1:14:58] accomplished we started the service
[1:15:01] knowing that what went through my head
[1:15:14] believe me or not cover it was the most
[1:15:16] beautiful moment the only thing that I
[1:15:20] was thinking was how can I predict the
[1:15:24] congregation how can I make sure they're
[1:15:27] going home with a big heart
[1:15:29] there were four different teams
[1:15:32] - four of us were places every team was

[1:18:57] they do they'll be found out by the by
[1:18:59] Vivek and Vivek will investigate arrest

[1:21:02] there's a piece of paper on it the whole
[1:21:04] room is empty no one comes and faces you
[1:21:06] they stand behind you and ask you
[1:21:08] questions you you can't turn and look
[1:21:11] many times they just have a blindfold on

[1:27:08] let's take a right
[1:27:18] there is this moment of truth neither
[1:27:22] one can't your faith we die right here
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:27] now we have no problem with that because
[1:27:30] we are doing commandments of God
[1:27:31] we'll have a good night's sleep tonight
[1:27:34] okay and I just do it inside like this I
[1:27:41] was scared I cannot deny that our school
[1:27:48] when I was there a noose around my neck
[1:27:51] and they were putting pressure on me
[1:27:52] just you either guy here you walk and so
[1:27:56] forth this came to my mind and I said
[1:28:00] okay you're asking me to deny my faith
[1:28:04] in order to save my life
[1:28:06] what if I died in a car accident and see
[1:28:09] Lord Jesus and he just shows his hat to
[1:28:11] me one day I have to say they'd rather
[1:28:14] die right here how am I scared of course
[1:28:17] I am a human being but I know what I'm
[1:28:20] going is that for me
[1:28:23] after actually they started to play
[1:28:26] good-cop bad-cop
[1:28:27] the good cup you know this is not very
[1:28:31] fighting to judge yet and we can't do it
[1:28:33] later bringing down taking back to so
[1:28:35] and it will be back to yourself
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:29:01] you
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:06] we grow up in a society that believes in
[1:29:11] freedom of religion and so culturally
[1:29:16] that's ingrained within within our our
[1:29:19] minds and our hearts that's what we see
[1:29:21] all around us so we don't we don't
[1:29:27] believe in cursive cutey is looking for
[1:29:30] for their faith even if we strongly
[1:29:32] disagree with them we believe that they
[1:29:35] should have the right to practice their
[1:29:36] religion the First Amendment gives us
[1:29:39] the right to freedom of speech we have
[1:29:42] the right to freedom of religion these
[1:29:44] are things that are just as conservative
[1:29:48] the Christians we just we live and
[1:29:52] breathe them so it's we don't think of
[1:29:55] it that way
[1:29:56] just let me draw you a picture you see a
[1:29:59] person who's in Christ for years and
[1:30:03] when you talk to him you want to give a
[1:30:06] scriptural reference to him
[1:30:09] you'll see he is staring at you and you
[1:30:12] ask him why doesn't he have his Bible on
[1:30:15] him and he says I never had one
[1:30:20] it breaks your heart
[1:30:22] before walking we got without having
[1:30:24] Bible
[1:30:28] so how can they search the scripture how
[1:30:32] can they verify and recognize through
[1:30:37] the front line but if they don't have a
[1:30:40] Bible in it if they don't have a New
[1:30:43] Testament read for themselves if they
[1:30:45] don't have brother branham's material
[1:30:48] printed in their hands in your own
[1:30:50] language so they can read what the
[1:30:52] Prophet is generation brought for us and
[1:30:56] just not take my word for that
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:08] Jesus told us in Matthew 24 that this
[1:31:11] gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[1:31:14] in all nations and then the end shall
[1:31:16] come so we know that we've got to bring
[1:31:18] this message to every nation and so that
[1:31:22] means all the nations of the Middle East
[1:31:24] it's been our vision from the beginning
[1:31:28] that these believers here from Iran that
[1:31:31] have been persecuted that fled the
[1:31:33] country can also reach to the other
[1:31:36] nations throughout the Middle East who
[1:31:39] better to reach Muslims than former
[1:31:43] Muslims they know they know the
[1:31:44] background they know the history the
[1:31:47] culture
[1:31:50] when I left the country came to Turkey I
[1:31:54] had a scripture that says whatever I
[1:31:58] send you you would go out whatever I put
[1:32:00] in your mouth you will tell so that's my
[1:32:03] vision following the same thing wherever
[1:32:05] God sends me wherever God wants me to be
[1:32:07] I'll be there and whatever he puts in my
[1:32:09] mouth I will tell but specifically about
[1:32:14] Turkey and ministering to fail all
[1:32:17] Iranians my vision is to provide them
[1:32:22] with more broad materials of Branum as
[1:32:25] much as possible provide them with
[1:32:29] Bibles New Testaments and audio
[1:32:32] translations with the doctrines and with
[1:32:34] the materials so I can put them in their
[1:32:36] hands so they can read for themselves
[1:32:38] they can search the scripture they can
[1:32:40] search for a brand those messages to see
[1:32:43] if for a ministry in according to what
[1:32:46] for an upset so that's my vision to be
[1:32:50] able first make sure that I still have
[1:32:54] the leading of the Lord for here and be
[1:32:57] humble to their leading be obedience to
[1:33:00] his will
[1:33:02] the field as much as I can and do the
[1:33:06] best I can do
[1:33:08] assume them I trusted is the Sabre than
[1:33:11] that fall other brothers
[1:33:18] that's funny alright three two one
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:49] you
[1:34:07] you
[1:34:14] amen pray the grace of God to the 1500
[1:34:21] believers in Iran oh I've wondered about
[1:34:26] it many times that wonder not how many
[1:34:27] believers are there I thought there
[1:34:29] might be a few with 1500 we pray the
[1:34:33] grace of God to them as they take their
[1:34:34] stand for the truth if they take their
[1:34:37] stand for the message a man so we thank
[1:34:40] the Lord for the witness of our brother
[1:34:44] and of course our brother Stephen coffee
[1:34:46] as well
[1:34:47] concerning believers in those countries
[1:34:50] please that we're not going to vote here
[1:34:53] ignorant of what's going on among the
[1:34:56] Brethren the brothers and sisters in
[1:34:58] Turkey we're not going to go out and be
[1:35:00] ignorant of what's going on with the
[1:35:01] brothers and sisters in Iran and there's
[1:35:04] other countries as well so brother I
[1:35:06] pray the grace of God to them amen
[1:35:09] so do what we can for them is to is to
[1:35:12] pray for them that the Lord would Lord
[1:35:14] is there to meet their needs and as that
[1:35:17] was highlighted there concerning certain
[1:35:20] things in Iran that if you took your
[1:35:22] stand for the word to curse and for the
[1:35:24] message you took your stand for Christ
[1:35:26] that you're not allowed to get a job
[1:35:28] they're not allowed to do this you're
[1:35:30] not allowed to do that on others in that
[1:35:32] country are not allowed to do anything
[1:35:33] for you to help you so you're really in
[1:35:37] you're really going by faith really
[1:35:40] taking God at His Word you're really
[1:35:42] going to trust the Lord and brother you
[1:35:45] know do we have that faith to trust God
[1:35:48] you know you know oh my we're in a world
[1:35:52] that's very prosperous yes we are
[1:35:55] yeah Newfoundland is prosperous Canada's
[1:35:58] prosperous the Americas prosperous or
[1:36:01] the people wouldn't be living like
[1:36:02] they're living and have what they have
[1:36:04] you know but again they're not sort of
[1:36:06] not so prosperous in those countries and
[1:36:09] they are brothers and sisters really
[1:36:11] truly in need you know they really truly
[1:36:16] have needs so does our hearts go out to
[1:36:19] them have we praying for them not just
[1:36:21] casually saying a prayer but really
[1:36:24] hungry in a thirsting in our hearts Lord
[1:36:26] please Lord for
[1:36:28] brothers and sisters in Iran for our
[1:36:29] brothers citrus and Turkey for our
[1:36:31] brothers and sisters in in in some of
[1:36:33] these other countries Lord that opposed
[1:36:36] Christianity that opposed the word that
[1:36:38] opposed a message in the name of Jesus
[1:36:40] have mercy on Lord please whatever you
[1:36:43] want me to do Lord to encourage that
[1:36:45] help me to do it so Lord as they as they
[1:36:48] are laying down their lives for the word
[1:36:50] yeah they're taking they're taking the
[1:36:53] data that that opportunity there to
[1:36:56] preach the word but under under the
[1:36:59] condition that they might be arrested on
[1:37:01] the condition that they might end up in
[1:37:03] jail amen well as I said what's going on
[1:37:08] there be on our doorstep one day please
[1:37:11] in the name of Jesus let's take it
[1:37:13] serious amen because it's concerning the
[1:37:18] end he mentioned their mountain in
[1:37:19] Matthew chapter 24
[1:37:21] concerning what's going to go on in the
[1:37:23] last days and live well it's gonna get
[1:37:25] so bad in the last days he said it'd be
[1:37:27] no flesh saved if he did in short in
[1:37:31] time now I wonder brethren did highlight
[1:37:33] the fact that not we're not talking
[1:37:34] about no souls saved but no flesh saved
[1:37:37] it's going to get that bad for those
[1:37:39] that are going to take their stand for
[1:37:41] what's right so I pray great grace that
[1:37:43] we're going to keep on moving forward
[1:37:45] let them in let their faith encourage us
[1:37:48] in our faith as they take their stand
[1:37:51] and having to maybe suffer this and
[1:37:54] suffer that that by the grace of God
[1:37:56] Lord we'll take our stand here for sure
[1:37:58] a man so and pray for them so the grace
[1:38:04] of God to them the grace of God to us we
[1:38:06] know as to brother Branham when it comes
[1:38:08] to I think a brother Jack more mention
[1:38:12] it when it comes to the giving them
[1:38:16] financial help and so on financially in
[1:38:20] each spiritual help more than the
[1:38:22] financial help but and who is the
[1:38:25] brother that gave brother Branham that
[1:38:27] $500 check you know for for for this the
[1:38:33] levers are for Christians in a certain
[1:38:35] country there I want to say what the
[1:38:37] country was
[1:38:38] and brother Brown tore the check out and
[1:38:42] yeah I think it was more than $500 he
[1:38:45] tore it off and the brother was shocked
[1:38:48] no custody what why would he do that you
[1:38:53] know tear that check up and brother
[1:38:55] Brown he said brother he said just take
[1:38:57] it to a forgot knows your brother
[1:38:58] their faith is tested one way and our
[1:39:01] faith is tested another way that's true
[1:39:03] but again as we pray for them we pray
[1:39:06] grace that they're praying for us just
[1:39:08] think what they're enduring what they're
[1:39:10] going through that they still have they
[1:39:12] got the Holy Ghost
[1:39:13] Debbie praying for us oh yeah where
[1:39:16] they're taking their stand for this take
[1:39:17] their stand for that oh my they're
[1:39:19] really their faith is really being
[1:39:20] tested and they got to pray for the pray
[1:39:22] for those into more prosperous countries
[1:39:24] oh yeah well we need to pray for them
[1:39:27] because oh they got to maybe lay down
[1:39:28] their physical lives yes for the gospel
[1:39:31] but again maybe they're concerned over
[1:39:34] the believers here in these countries
[1:39:35] that are better caught up with
[1:39:37] prosperity they're caught up with this
[1:39:39] and kind of with the Oh Lord help help
[1:39:41] our brothers and sisters in America
[1:39:43] how about brothers and sisters in Canada
[1:39:44] Lord don't let them get caught up with
[1:39:46] the natural things of life Lord Lord
[1:39:48] that they'll they'll be more than
[1:39:49] willing to lay down their lives as we
[1:39:51] are here amen see so I pray the grace of
[1:39:56] God for them that the Lord gave them
[1:39:58] more strength and encouragement to keep
[1:40:00] on preaching keep on taking understand
[1:40:02] for the word and they know when they go
[1:40:05] to church that they might be arrested
[1:40:06] and especially if they're gonna preach
[1:40:09] they might be arrested they'll end up in
[1:40:11] jail and so on
[1:40:12] so but they amen if they got the Holy
[1:40:15] Ghost maybe they're considering us and
[1:40:18] saying Lord oh we think they need prayer
[1:40:22] more than us maybe they feel that we
[1:40:24] need prayer more than them why because
[1:40:27] of what we're tested by what we're
[1:40:29] tempted by especially as an engineer 2nd
[1:40:32] Timothy chapter 3 you know what's going
[1:40:35] to happen maybe you'll see less and less
[1:40:37] of that among believers in those
[1:40:39] countries but you see more and more and
[1:40:41] more of it among believers in the in
[1:40:43] so-called free countries oh yeah so we
[1:40:47] need to be on our guard to there they're
[1:40:49] laid out of their lives
[1:40:50] so yeah Lord if we've got a
[1:40:52] died for you will die for you we're
[1:40:54] gonna die for the word we'll die for the
[1:40:55] word amen because why because they're
[1:40:57] going to go into eternal life but lord
[1:41:00] we pray for our brothers and sisters in
[1:41:02] America we pray for our brothers sisters
[1:41:04] in Canada Lord they might get deceived
[1:41:06] so don't Lord don't let him get to see
[1:41:08] don't then we turned our life over to
[1:41:10] this turned their life over that let him
[1:41:11] stay with the word Amen God hidden and
[1:41:14] God revealed and simplicity Amen thank
[1:41:17] the Lord for that revelation to God be
[1:41:20] the glory
[1:41:20] a man so bleep please in the name of the
[1:41:23] Lord let listen let's be on our guards -
[1:41:26] oh yeah
[1:41:27] alright god bless them in Iran god bless
[1:41:31] them in Turkey no other countries and
[1:41:32] yes lord have mercy on us in in these
[1:41:35] countries a man because sometimes
[1:41:38] natural freedom oh yeah you can take
[1:41:42] away and make us make us a little bit to
[1:41:45] relax when it comes to spiritually Oh
[1:41:47] most definitely
[1:41:48] oh yeah I don't have to worry about this
[1:41:51] I read word with that the brother
[1:41:52] where's over there God is trying and
[1:41:55] testing their faith in every area of
[1:41:57] their lives here oh well I don't have to
[1:42:01] trust the Lord for this don't need that
[1:42:02] sorry Lord you've done this you've done
[1:42:04] that you've done that I got this I got
[1:42:06] that yeah and we put less and less faith
[1:42:10] in God for it because we take it for
[1:42:13] granted
[1:42:14] amen so God be with us and God help us
[1:42:17] is my prayer brother again that will as
[1:42:23] the Bible says that was holding on my
[1:42:27] doctrine manner of life purpose faith
[1:42:31] long-suffering charity patience and
[1:42:36] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[1:42:40] me and so on he said and he said what
[1:42:43] persecutions I endured but out of them
[1:42:46] all the Lord delivered me yeah because
[1:42:50] he was enduring it he wasn't going to
[1:42:52] compromise so he had less persecution he
[1:42:56] wasn't gonna compromise so they have
[1:42:58] less afflictions and so on no no he kept
[1:43:00] on going even after he was stoned
[1:43:03] someday was dead he got up and kept on
[1:43:06] going just thinking what he endured he
[1:43:09] experienced it they thought he was dead
[1:43:12] he was stoned to that extent a man but
[1:43:15] when he kept when he came back and he
[1:43:18] got his health and strength again he
[1:43:19] just kept on going in the name of the
[1:43:21] Lord he wasn't going to slow down he
[1:43:22] wasn't gonna stop no hope all your gonna
[1:43:26] keep doing this yes well it's just my
[1:43:29] just my nature it was his only ghost
[1:43:32] nature to keep on doing it a man he just
[1:43:35] went on and on and on and on by the
[1:43:37] grace of Almighty God a man and he
[1:43:40] endured as I said much affliction and he
[1:43:42] endured much persecution a man and
[1:43:45] brother and we take our stand and more
[1:43:48] and more and more emphasis on the gospel
[1:43:51] Ananda on the word brother the hours
[1:43:54] coming would I trust my grace that we're
[1:43:59] going to endure when they come to try to
[1:44:02] put but put us to an end because listen
[1:44:05] as I said before there's thousands and
[1:44:08] thousands and thousands of nonprofit
[1:44:10] charter organizations in Canada and they
[1:44:13] want to cut that back they do they want
[1:44:17] to cut it back and that's why eventually
[1:44:18] they're going to force you to try it
[1:44:20] unite with with with this larger
[1:44:23] organization this larger group this
[1:44:25] larger group yeah and we'll lose our
[1:44:28] registration and so on many believing
[1:44:31] churches were losing as I know that some
[1:44:36] have already lost it in Canada
[1:44:38] why it's because of what their faith
[1:44:42] because of what they preached yeah but
[1:44:46] the thing of it is as I've a certain
[1:44:48] church was their deacons was advised to
[1:44:52] consult me this they were wondering what
[1:44:55] to do how to do it and so on comes to
[1:44:58] comes to their what they believed and
[1:45:00] the church registered with the
[1:45:01] government so a brother said contact
[1:45:04] brother Gerald in Newfoundland and he
[1:45:07] said he'll give you the advice so I gave
[1:45:10] him the advice and
[1:45:11] and I told him what they should not do
[1:45:14] and he said brother you're right they
[1:45:16] said they said we're aware that just
[1:45:19] just recently a church lost his for
[1:45:22] registration and they now now they had
[1:45:25] no more rights as a nonprofit
[1:45:27] organization with the with the federal
[1:45:30] government why because of a certain
[1:45:33] thing they did they shouldn't have done
[1:45:34] it that way
[1:45:35] third thing they said they shouldn't
[1:45:37] have said it that way
[1:45:38] and so I expressed it again to another
[1:45:41] church their eyes to make sure if you
[1:45:43] say it the right way
[1:45:44] I said don't don't be too bold with it I
[1:45:47] said just do it this way this way this
[1:45:49] way and okay so do we understand so that
[1:45:54] so there's there's a number of churches
[1:45:56] that have lost their registration why
[1:45:58] because of what they said when they said
[1:46:01] how they said it and so on see it's like
[1:46:03] the in a certain country in Europe and
[1:46:07] her brother was preaching and he got up
[1:46:10] he read a scripture here at a certain
[1:46:14] scripture now he didn't say anything he
[1:46:15] just read the scripture and went on to
[1:46:17] preach the word and but there was
[1:46:19] somebody in the audience that heard and
[1:46:21] read a certain scripture about a certain
[1:46:23] thing in condemning this and condemning
[1:46:25] that it was Scripture and that person
[1:46:28] went out and reported it and that pastor
[1:46:31] ended up in jail for six months for
[1:46:34] highlighting that Scripture he did yeah
[1:46:37] he did that wasn't that long ago and I'm
[1:46:41] not sure exactly what country it was but
[1:46:43] is it serious it is serious so it we got
[1:46:47] to take a serious and God wants us to
[1:46:49] take it serious
[1:46:50] by grace so that we truly take our stand
[1:46:53] for the truth the whole truth nothing
[1:46:54] but the truth
[1:46:56] amen so god bless us and god bless to
[1:46:59] our hearts the what we have seen may we
[1:47:02] not forget it but maybe keep constantly
[1:47:05] keep them in prayer not only in Iran
[1:47:07] just think fifteen hundred believers I
[1:47:10] never thought that God bless him and God
[1:47:15] be with him and may the Lord continue to
[1:47:17] strengthen them and encourage them and
[1:47:19] give them what they need a man was they
[1:47:22] need you just need stronger stronger
[1:47:24] stronger faith
[1:47:25] they keep standing for the truth we need
[1:47:28] stronger stronger faith to stay with the
[1:47:30] word don't compromise
[1:47:32] it's a devilís the god of this age the
[1:47:36] god of this evil age is doing anything

[1:52:48] thing the annual report for 2019 and

[1:52:56] numbers are for that and then after this
[1:53:01] and it's not gonna be long and then the
[1:53:06] Joseph is going to come up and conduct
[1:53:09] the just ease of voting for the officers
[1:53:13] of the church he's just going to talk
[1:53:15] about that and then we'll have the
[1:53:17] voting in the countin and they'll be
[1:53:19] it'll be
[1:53:20] it's for today you'll be dismissed so
[1:53:23] it's a annual thing that we have to do
[1:53:25] so you know according under the
[1:53:28] registration and things but something we
[1:53:30] should do anyway just to take a bit of
[1:53:32] time to talk about the other side is
[1:53:34] that's the most important side well it's
[1:53:35] just something that you know we have
[1:53:37] responsibility to do and be responsible
[1:53:39] for you know the money we take in and
[1:53:41] the money we spend so in so we've
[1:53:44] already had a meeting here in January
[1:53:48] with the brothers and they have the
[1:53:50] information on all of this so I'm just
[1:53:52] gonna flick through this today and then
[1:53:54] because we've already gone into detail
[1:53:56] and I'm gonna just talk about certain
[1:53:57] things and then I'll send this out to
[1:54:00] all those on the list here in the PDF
[1:54:02] file so you can just review in more
[1:54:04] detail if you want because there is some
[1:54:05] detail on the slides here and you got
[1:54:07] any questions you can just just respond
[1:54:11] back to me on the email or anything or
[1:54:12] if you have one that goes through the
[1:54:14] whole thing I'll sit down with you and
[1:54:15] go through the whole thing but I don't
[1:54:18] think you'll find it it's pretty basic
[1:54:19] money and money out you know what have
[1:54:22] we said what have we wanted what did we
[1:54:24] plan to do did we do that and what did
[1:54:27] we do was there anything else was that
[1:54:29] it and you know how it all turned on me
[1:54:32] and you know so all of this you know
[1:54:35] it's it's uh you know basically the
[1:54:37] money that comes in we use it for the
[1:54:40] things that you know the church you know
[1:54:43] is is forum to do whatever it is you
[1:54:48] know the government to look at it and
[1:54:49] they say what is it you're here for and
[1:54:51] if you're we're here for church or her
[1:54:52] or you know whatever that's what we
[1:54:55] that's what we spent the money on if we
[1:54:56] don't spend it on that then dead they'll
[1:54:59] ask a question and say well what you
[1:55:01] spent on this form you know so and they
[1:55:03] were looking for those things so so we
[1:55:05] just want to make sure that while we're
[1:55:06] here for and the money would collect
[1:55:08] from the people and that we spend it on
[1:55:11] the things that were where we said we're
[1:55:13] gonna spend it up okay so I got a I got
[1:55:18] a Geiger I do just
[1:55:37] okay so I just everyone should be see
[1:55:46] that so this is the
[1:55:56] you know some people care about it some
[1:56:01] people it's up to you how much you want
[1:56:13] to know about this the best part
[1:56:16] completing your money or your tides that
[1:56:19] you're offering to that that's someone
[1:56:21] else have a look you know take care of
[1:56:22] it so in 2019 the first thing in the
[1:56:28] morning we did pay off that we doing for
[1:56:42] me
[1:56:58] next time so in terms of visiting
[1:57:08] ministers you see what happened six
[1:57:15] visits to both of them and came through
[1:57:19] this year so we see over here that the
[1:57:22] offerings that were collected for the
[1:57:23] ministers so every time a minister comes
[1:57:27] I was not a note to say if you want to
[1:57:30] you know put an offering in and that
[1:57:34] amounted to $12,000 and change and it
[1:57:38] was 63 percent of the total cost which
[1:57:40] was 19 thousand points of me for the
[1:57:43] minister's mo says travel travel
[1:57:45] expenses and stress you with us and then
[1:57:48] in the tides it was seven to nine seven
[1:57:50] thirty seven percent which makes of the
[1:57:51] hundred percent so so that's how the
[1:57:54] ministers are funded and this year was
[1:57:57] new which is the tuition expense in use
[1:57:59] you see for the Baptist school also for
[1:58:04] a home school and how much was the
[1:58:07] contribution breakdown sort of church
[1:58:09] the from the tides offering really it
[1:58:12] was four thousand six hundred fifty
[1:58:13] eight and upstream donated five thousand
[1:58:16] and the balance was from the offerings
[1:58:18] that was just a make up to told house to
[1:58:20] fourteen thousand five hundred fifty six
[1:58:22] that's what the total cost was and then
[1:58:25] brother Matt and brother Chad had a
[1:58:28] portion to pay and the church paid their
[1:58:31] portion which amounted to ten thousand
[1:58:33] so church pay ten thousand they told us
[1:58:35] fourteen thousand and the balance there
[1:58:37] four thousand and some was paid by the
[1:58:40] two brothers the two families okay and
[1:58:43] that's going to continue this year so
[1:58:45] these are some of the things that we did
[1:58:46] that we support during the year so you
[1:58:50] know what there are things like church
[1:58:51] equipment and missions and church to
[1:58:53] website was developed by Pope Paul and
[1:58:55] people this year didn't one soul at that
[1:58:58] you know was a cost to those things and
[1:59:00] there's
[1:59:00] some coordination and planning and
[1:59:02] execution to do those things Sunday
[1:59:05] school programs which carried on the
[1:59:07] youth events the church picnic the
[1:59:09] camping trip all is it was funds from
[1:59:11] the treasury camping trip to fellowships
[1:59:15] the tuition program the church address
[1:59:17] changed and the notification sent out
[1:59:20] for that I was a post office box changed
[1:59:23] deacons and trustees positions fully
[1:59:26] established full implementation of the
[1:59:28] treasurer position they will come for
[1:59:30] building funds donation slips or were
[1:59:33] issued an honorarium tax forms to be and
[1:59:36] there also to be issued W issued this
[1:59:38] week so if you did get if you did get
[1:59:42] some money from the church we're
[1:59:44] required to send out a t4a or a t-4 and
[1:59:47] iron form to the US so this but just
[1:59:50] come to if you say buy something and you
[1:59:53] give it an invoice and you get money to
[1:59:55] do so tax obligation for that but say
[1:59:58] for a minister coming in say if you give
[2:00:00] them $1,500 let's call an honorarium and
[2:00:04] then you're given a slip so they have to
[2:00:06] put it on their income tax and they
[2:00:08] should anyway they don't need us but as
[2:00:09] you put it on anyway it's other angle so
[2:00:13] that's what that is about
[2:00:14] just some tax things on that we have to
[2:00:16] look after this is the money page so you
[2:00:22] know when I send it out you can have a
[2:00:23] look at this so here's here's a
[2:00:26] breakdown of all of the costs in
[2:00:29] categories here and you see the
[2:00:31] percentage of those things you know like
[2:00:33] the pastor expenses all the expenses is
[2:00:35] probably half the money that comes in
[2:00:37] and here's the other things busying
[2:00:39] ministers Mormon Church church
[2:00:41] operations and things here's the money
[2:00:44] that does come in here here's the bank
[2:00:47] balances at the end of the year these
[2:00:50] are the expenses that what the money was
[2:00:52] spent on and this was just some of the
[2:00:55] larger disbursements through the year
[2:00:58] like paying off the mortgage for the
[2:01:01] visiting ministers at tuition and the
[2:01:03] building pumps is just big globs you can
[2:01:05] see I just added him so you can look at
[2:01:07] that and it's just a note there was a
[2:01:10] six thousand dollar loan that was
[2:01:13] ahead for to pay off the mortgage just a
[2:01:15] little bit early just to finish it off
[2:01:17] so we did that in the first part of 19
[2:01:21] so that's 19 so this is this now we're
[2:01:24] into to 2020 so 2020 you'll see this is
[2:01:30] the tuition program again we're gonna
[2:01:32] carry it out it crosses over 20 and 21
[2:01:34] so there's no money really goes out now
[2:01:37] until September 4 and basically we're at
[2:01:41] this point we're just gonna do basically
[2:01:43] the same thing so you see is the same
[2:01:46] same amounts as last year's this year
[2:01:48] and we have to wait to see what what the
[2:01:51] cost will be coming from the back to
[2:01:53] school if they increase our costs for
[2:01:54] decrease or say someone low to
[2:01:56] kindergarten grade one is more money and
[2:01:58] all that so there would be some change
[2:02:00] to that which we can adapt to but
[2:02:02] basically what we're saying in the plan
[2:02:04] today and voting on and signing off is
[2:02:07] that we will go ahead with the tuition
[2:02:08] program like we did last year which i
[2:02:11] think was a good thing it was a this is
[2:02:17] the building program now and I'm just I
[2:02:19] I go circle back to 2012 and 2013 when
[2:02:23] it when we decided to buy this building
[2:02:26] and there was there was five phases at
[2:02:31] the time phase 1 and 2 was the to get
[2:02:35] the to actually acquire the building
[2:02:38] that all had to be done with permits and
[2:02:40] surveys and assessments and appraisals
[2:02:44] and all of that and that we had to do
[2:02:46] and it was a cost of that of three
[2:02:48] thousand nine hundred seventy eight
[2:02:49] dollars that we had to pay just for
[2:02:52] different things to get it set up so
[2:02:55] that we could buy it and start working
[2:02:57] on it phase three was the actual
[2:02:59] construction we had to change the
[2:03:01] building to a church that's what we did
[2:03:03] and basically and buy the building so
[2:03:07] the only money we borrow was really the
[2:03:10] mortgage and it amounted to around a
[2:03:13] hundred and sixty four thousand dollars
[2:03:15] which we paid off in five and a half
[2:03:17] years which was good
[2:03:19] praise God for that and to do the
[2:03:23] construction cost us forty four thousand
[2:03:26] six hundred and sixty one dollars
[2:03:28] rounded off and there was no loan for
[2:03:32] that or anything it was just our own
[2:03:34] money that we collected there was two
[2:03:37] people that donated money to us you know
[2:03:39] from other churches and that's that's
[2:03:41] how that was paid for the construction
[2:03:43] it was mostly labor free we spent very
[2:03:46] little on labor it was mostly the church
[2:03:48] people and most of that was equipment
[2:03:53] you know things we had to purchase like
[2:03:56] you know with building materials and
[2:04:00] also like he pumping air conditioners
[2:04:04] and heaters and whatever we had to buy
[2:04:07] that that included in that forty four
[2:04:10] thousand six hundred and sixty one
[2:04:12] dollars rounded up so then we had phase
[2:04:16] five this will react today now never
[2:04:18] suggest background so phase five phase 4
[2:04:22] I should say faith for there were some
[2:04:24] things that we were going to do once the
[2:04:25] church was built which was we had the
[2:04:27] old pulpit first you remember we were
[2:04:29] gonna get a new pulpit and was your one
[2:04:31] of the altar and at the end I think I
[2:04:35] got there there was pews brother Joseph
[2:04:40] ended up finding two pews and we brought
[2:04:42] him back in from Nova Scotia which was
[2:04:44] good and pulpit the bathroom right there
[2:04:47] the third bathroom the cross outside now
[2:04:50] it's an old rugged cross and now and a
[2:04:54] piano we wanted to get a new piano this
[2:04:57] morning into paying for it and anyway
[2:04:59] and we were going to get this to
[2:05:01] deciding outside which we didn't do we
[2:05:04] never that's the only thing we didn't do
[2:05:05] and that was six thousand dollars so
[2:05:08] that we said we'd we didn't have to do
[2:05:10] that right away
[2:05:10] and once we were in the church then we
[2:05:14] spent the money on those things and it
[2:05:16] was just our own money again so it was
[2:05:18] good it was as planned
[2:05:20] we didn't need it at the time we just
[2:05:22] everything was tight
[2:05:23] so we wanted to make sure that we just
[2:05:26] waited till that the other stuff was
[2:05:29] paid for and everything and then we
[2:05:31] could do that so that was good and so
[2:05:35] now we're into that was all done in in
[2:05:37] in 12 and 13 and now in 2020 we're here
[2:05:44] again now at phase 5 that we were going
[2:05:46] to do because we you know the foyer
[2:05:49] there was tight and we kind of knew that
[2:05:52] you know especially in the winter
[2:05:54] because she couldn't stand out so
[2:05:56] everyone was tight there and we wanted
[2:05:59] to do something with that the pastor's
[2:06:01] office was small we wanted to do
[2:06:03] something with that and have a bathroom
[2:06:05] joined with it
[2:06:06] especially especially got busy ministers
[2:06:08] from something they got a quote side and
[2:06:10] stuff outside to go to the bathroom and
[2:06:13] thank you then the nursery you know
[2:06:23] small but and also whatever about the
[2:06:27] sanctuary but and also there was
[2:06:30] programs going on like Sunday school
[2:06:33] programs but the nursery was needed at
[2:06:35] the time because she had new babies now
[2:06:37] coming and you know you the mothers with
[2:06:40] babies can't go into nursery after
[2:06:42] Sunday school going on in there and the
[2:06:44] only he got those poems so we have a
[2:06:46] tight on space is only 800 some square
[2:06:48] feet in all of this so we know Enders
[2:06:51] functional areas that you need so that's
[2:06:54] that was the plan back then that we
[2:06:56] we're gonna have to deal with that and
[2:06:58] we said we deal with it when the
[2:06:59] mortgage was paid we would deal with
[2:07:02] that in otherwise we just you know go
[2:07:04] along and do it right so so I could say
[2:07:09] just here this is just the church funded
[2:07:11] this this amount is fifty four thousand
[2:07:14] five hundred fifty one for phase one two
[2:07:18] and the construction and four and then
[2:07:21] there was a loan there so okay that's
[2:07:24] just a little background so in it so
[2:07:27] this year's billing program the goal was
[2:07:30] to provide adequate space for the
[2:07:32] connotation the office do tell
[2:07:34] these two parking the stories programs a
[2:07:36] nursery so we just anything to anything
[2:07:39] that was needed for the conducting the
[2:07:41] church programs and services you know
[2:07:44] service that's what we needed to make
[2:07:47] sure that we had in the building program
[2:07:49] so the issues we had now was you know
[2:07:51] the things driving the drivers day I say
[2:07:54] issues the drivers you know having more
[2:07:56] people is not an issue the drivers would
[2:07:59] be the growth of the assembly percent
[2:08:01] see growth with that so you just need
[2:08:04] more room especially around the
[2:08:05] functional rooms that I mentioned the
[2:08:07] Sunday school space and also storage you
[2:08:09] know just having that adequate you know
[2:08:11] to do what we need to do and then faith
[2:08:14] five was the issue that a toy a which is
[2:08:16] small we'd like to expand it the
[2:08:18] pastor's office bathroom so what we're
[2:08:19] thinking about is you know doing just
[2:08:21] looking at in another building program
[2:08:23] at this time and we've talked about it
[2:08:25] opinion especially both Paul has done
[2:08:27] some work with the town Town Council and
[2:08:33] talking back or what we can do first so
[2:08:36] we looked at the options of heaven
[2:08:38] extending out to the sides to extend in
[2:08:43] the front extend that partner you know
[2:08:45] just take away the bank and go out there
[2:08:48] that way we could go to the back but we
[2:08:51] know we need a land that was but that we
[2:08:54] could get you know at some point from
[2:08:57] the Curly's there if we could get that
[2:09:01] to expand up that way which would be the
[2:09:03] best option or we could extend up and
[2:09:05] put another story on or purchase another
[2:09:08] building or do nothing you know that was
[2:09:11] the options that we have right so
[2:09:13] extending up this way was was not option
[2:09:17] at all and then we found out we couldn't
[2:09:20] extend out this way because right now we
[2:09:23] we're not back from the road as far as
[2:09:26] we should be anyway so they're not going
[2:09:28] to let you go this way towards it and so
[2:09:33] that that's not an option
[2:09:35] extend up you know that's easy
[2:09:40] in some ways but it would be definitely
[2:09:42] disruptive here you know we don't to be
[2:09:44] happy an extension too disruptive where
[2:09:47] you have to stop services I can't use
[2:09:48] this building and find another place so
[2:09:50] we do this is best one thing we'd have
[2:09:52] to look at purchaser billing you know
[2:09:54] that was that was an option of a van or
[2:09:58] a mortgage in that if we wanted to write
[2:10:00] do things I got a and had to sell this
[2:10:02] building in and you know selling it's
[2:10:04] just I really see these days so so the
[2:10:10] first thing was the best thing was to go
[2:10:12] to an extension in the back we'd had to
[2:10:13] figure out if they would sell us the
[2:10:15] land if too careless they said she said
[2:10:18] to me you know that you know with if she
[2:10:21] was gonna sell a house she would give us
[2:10:23] first crack so on someone lost the land
[2:10:26] part the the back part of our property
[2:10:28] did squares off with this property if
[2:10:31] the Curie's all in all that it's at one
[2:10:32] time they only this house that land that
[2:10:35] they owned you know this part and all
[2:10:37] that so so we were trying to find trust
[2:10:41] trying to catch her at the top on the
[2:10:42] scene if maybe you're not gonna sell on
[2:10:44] but maybe you you sell off that land now
[2:10:46] before we make a decision on which way
[2:10:49] we would go with the extension and going
[2:10:51] out that way would be a really good way
[2:10:53] of doing it you know that would be the
[2:10:54] best best option for sure it the easiest
[2:10:56] and fits right into the council side of
[2:10:59] it and that land there you know it's you
[2:11:02] know it's not gonna they're not gonna
[2:11:03] sell it to anyone else because there's
[2:11:05] no access to it weird only ones have
[2:11:07] access to it
[2:11:09] sorry indeed the in the end after if we
[2:11:12] didn't get that option it would be to
[2:11:14] move it would be to extend out this side
[2:11:17] so you leave this wall here and you
[2:11:19] extend out that side and then have a
[2:11:21] have a Fourier of it that way you know
[2:11:24] and then you would dig down on that side
[2:11:26] and put in a couple of rooms for Sunday
[2:11:28] school or night and then extend out here
[2:11:30] the bathrooms in the nursery a little
[2:11:34] more so that you'd have more room and
[2:11:35] the pastor's office would go on the
[2:11:37] extension on this corner Daniel would
[2:11:40] take down this this these rooms and this
[2:11:43] room and
[2:11:44] make it for platform I moved to piano up
[2:11:48] here and the exit would be on through
[2:11:50] the pastor's office so you'd have bigger
[2:11:53] area here for the musicians and things
[2:11:56] and then you know so to be more room
[2:12:00] that way and you can have a little more
[2:12:02] room if you did expand up here with some
[2:12:05] more pews you know so it'll give you
[2:12:07] some time you know and that you wouldn't
[2:12:09] have to wait and then when the land came
[2:12:12] you would then go go start thinking
[2:12:15] about you know putting a building in
[2:12:18] there
[2:12:18] and maybe making this part of fellowship
[2:12:20] hall that would connect this would be a
[2:12:22] nice nice size for a fellowship hall is
[2:12:25] gonna be here right because this is 24
[2:12:28] by 24 right here in this breaking if
[2:12:30] we'd all here 24 by 24 and if you look
[2:12:34] at our place is 18 by 18 our house our
[2:12:37] extension so 24 by 24 would be nice for
[2:12:39] our church you know me being a nice size
[2:12:42] right then you have a look at probably a
[2:12:44] little kitchen a little kitchen in there
[2:12:46] I need so had the bathrooms and that and
[2:12:49] then to be a hall going out then to the
[2:12:51] church here with a door and you could
[2:12:53] just carry on into the church if you had
[2:12:55] to write them to be them the day's seven
[2:13:01] so so here's the review of the things
[2:13:06] really consult with CBS engineers and
[2:13:09] we're pretty clear Paul spend a good a
[2:13:11] time on the due diligence of that so
[2:13:13] we're pretty good to go and do it do
[2:13:15] that side extension and just make just
[2:13:18] work on the foyer entrance and dig down
[2:13:20] the big part is to dig down deep and to
[2:13:23] make that so we can go out there's 13
[2:13:26] feet and then we go down a full eight
[2:13:28] feet on the other side it's just a
[2:13:30] little Gaby little careful just going
[2:13:33] down where the building is just on the
[2:13:37] post right but it's not not undoable and
[2:13:40] then not real expensive you know we
[2:13:43] could we could get by on a building fund
[2:13:45] doing it right so then we would look at
[2:13:49] look at these things immediately the
[2:13:52] front of the building needs repair to
[2:13:53] shoot around the front of the building
[2:13:55] down the sign is off Thank You Matthew
[2:13:56] and that's Dallin and we had to clean up
[2:13:59] this cedar that's on the frontier that
[2:14:01] was there in the beginning we had put
[2:14:03] some on there but it's it's so wearing
[2:14:06] fast that basement cleanup and a new
[2:14:08] vacuum for the church and that's already
[2:14:11] done of course that's there now so we
[2:14:14] were really on the start of the due
[2:14:16] diligence so I didn't know was any
[2:14:19] questions or anything and that but you
[2:14:20] get to ask later or whatever but we've
[2:14:22] kind of gone through gone through it a
[2:14:24] bit before with the brothers so and
[2:14:27] we're still working through some of the
[2:14:28] details but that's the high level plan
[2:14:29] there that's the drivers I see options
[2:14:32] so we just got a language we want to go
[2:14:35] right and the visiting administers this
[2:14:39] was last year this is just some of the
[2:14:40] names we threw up when week to a Karen
[2:14:42] Mills of course brother general has
[2:14:45] announced already for April so there was
[2:14:49] some of the other names and your Glover
[2:14:51] came up but I put butter Macondo there I
[2:14:53] was talking on the phone I said would be
[2:14:55] coming down maybe over summer if you did
[2:14:57] you know be nice to have him preach you
[2:14:59] know it'll be good wait a couple years
[2:15:01] ago anything and if sister mercy came
[2:15:04] down last year but he didn't come back
[2:15:06] and I may see brother Matthew Watkins
[2:15:08] but a George Schmitt mentioned that he
[2:15:10] would like to come again and I think
[2:15:12] Andre had me I think he was catered for
[2:15:14] bishops anyway road this year I thought
[2:15:17] that we were talking to
[2:15:19] sis China and she thought he was
[2:15:21] supposed to be come they're still
[2:15:22] funding him she said so you know support
[2:15:25] them they're in the mission so you know
[2:15:29] so those are what we put out there and
[2:15:32] we'll continue support these programs
[2:15:35] that we did last year you know the youth
[2:15:38] events and the picnics and the camping I
[2:15:41] guess and doing those things again this
[2:15:43] year which everyone enjoyed and this is
[2:15:48] the budget just you know the high level
[2:15:51] budget for to 2020 so you can you can
[2:15:54] have a look at that I'll send it up to
[2:15:56] father everybody and the summary to
[2:15:59] church building project which be a big
[2:16:01] one this year to start in on that
[2:16:03] proceed with the church to school
[2:16:06] tuition funding the visiting ministers
[2:16:08] implement the building changes we're
[2:16:11] going to 2020 election today to that and
[2:16:14] an agree in sign off on a proposed 2020
[2:16:18] budget programs who would just sign off
[2:16:19] on this plan for this year so for the
[2:16:21] government more than me you know so they
[2:16:23] take you say okay you did this here's
[2:16:25] what you said you were gonna do
[2:16:26] here's your money okay where did you
[2:16:29] spend it did you spend it on what you
[2:16:30] said you were gonna do okay you know
[2:16:32] that's what we go through with that and
[2:16:36] and I think that's it unless there's any
[2:16:38] questions I'll pass it over to get this
[2:16:45] up to everyone today on the mailing list
[2:16:47] and I don't know if I got I think I got
[2:16:50] everyone
[2:17:08] just add one thing to what Dad said
[2:17:11] correct me if I'm wrong but my
[2:17:12] understanding is that with the due
[2:17:15] diligence and the funding and the
[2:17:17] planning and so forth the plan is to put
[2:17:19] all that together and then bring that to
[2:17:21] the church to explain that the options
[2:17:24] of how we would do that and that would
[2:17:27] be voted on yea or nay yes there's still
[2:17:37] a pending pending project so real quick
[2:17:44] just just to go over what we're about to
[2:17:47] do next we've done I think is our third
[2:17:49] vote now we've done so every one I think
[2:17:52] is pretty pretty used to the process and
[2:17:59] so I was asked just to quickly go over
[2:18:01] it again and just to remind everyone of
[2:18:04] the process so the the vote is is it's
[2:18:11] part of our bylaws is to have an annual
[2:18:14] vote and all of these positions pastor
[2:18:18] right on down are all elected by the
[2:18:21] church and all those positions are are
[2:18:25] intended to be positions of service
[2:18:27] we're here to serve the body and so the
[2:18:32] church ultimately you know by the
[2:18:34] parameter that is the in a sense the
[2:18:36] Holy Ghost you know the church boat and
[2:18:38] the decisions that are made through
[2:18:39] those votes these the leadership of the
[2:18:42] Lord we believe that so each year
[2:18:46] there's an opportunity for each of us to
[2:18:48] have a say in you know who the different
[2:18:51] positions are and who fills them we're
[2:18:53] not voting on the pastor alright we just
[2:18:57] done 40 years so we we trust him by now
[2:19:03] yeah it's got tenure so once you put 40
[2:19:06] years in a position you're you're taking
[2:19:08] off the ballot so you got a ways to go
[2:19:14] so we won't be voting on the pastor but
[2:19:17] we will be voting on the trustee and the
[2:19:19] Deacons Sunday School Superintendent
[2:19:21] Sunday school teachers and there are
[2:19:26] there is a criteria for voting and real
[2:19:29] quick it's you have to been regularly
[2:19:32] attending this church for a minimum of
[2:19:35] six months okay so you started coming
[2:19:39] three months ago you know you have to
[2:19:41] wait till next year
[2:19:43] about you you meet the other
[2:19:44] requirements so we're not going that we
[2:19:47] haven't you know we don't have a list
[2:19:49] here if we're gonna get a ballot - we're
[2:19:51] just gonna hand them down the aisles and
[2:19:53] you'll have to do your own assessment of
[2:19:55] whether or not you're qualified to vote
[2:19:58] another requirement is that you have to
[2:20:01] be paying tithes to be an active tithe
[2:20:04] payer to this church and the two
[2:20:06] exceptions are if you're a stay-at-home
[2:20:08] mother and your spouse works and of
[2:20:11] course you you just fall on their owner
[2:20:14] Neath him and of course the sisters are
[2:20:17] allowed to vote if you're a student do
[2:20:22] not have a job that pays a salary then
[2:20:24] you would also be able to vote as long
[2:20:25] as you meet the rest of the requirements
[2:20:27] you have to be 18 years of age today or
[2:20:31] older and you have to be baptized in the
[2:20:34] name the Lord Jesus Christ so those are
[2:20:36] the those are the four requirements
[2:20:39] so again just you have to do your own
[2:20:43] assessment and if if you don't meet one
[2:20:46] or more all of those I'm sorry if you
[2:20:48] don't meet all of those criteria then
[2:20:50] just just don't think about this is a
[2:20:55] silent vote so nobody's needs to know
[2:20:58] what you voted so try to do that
[2:21:01] privately it's best you can just make it
[2:21:04] fill out each of the the
[2:21:06] the squares that are there for each of
[2:21:09] the positions each ballot has yes and no
[2:21:13] just put a checkmark in the box
[2:21:15] yes if you want that person to stay in
[2:21:17] that position there's no new people
[2:21:20] being nominated here is everybody is an
[2:21:23] incumbent and then check know if if you
[2:21:26] do not agree and do not want that
[2:21:28] particular person to serve in that in
[2:21:30] that role and if nothing is checked if
[2:21:33] there's a box that's left empty then
[2:21:35] it'll be treated as as an abstain vote
[2:21:37] and not count brother David and the mark
[2:21:42] will be counting the votes after it's
[2:21:45] done and last by the mark just to let us
[2:21:48] know what the results are please fill
[2:21:51] out your ballot completely just to make
[2:21:57] that straightforward if you don't want
[2:22:00] to vote which is also an option just
[2:22:03] just hand your your ballot back or don't
[2:22:05] take one to begin with so that's that's
[2:22:13] that there any questions about that okay
[2:22:18] just a quick quote here as from the key
[2:22:21] to the door 1962 well the brown said the
[2:22:24] church is sovereign and what the church
[2:22:26] says that's that's what or where that's
[2:22:29] that you could say trustees or nobody
[2:22:31] else
[2:22:32] the trustees each one is one vote
[2:22:35] capacitor is just one vote it's the
[2:22:38] church it's a democracy of the church to
[2:22:40] sovereignty the church the church in
[2:22:42] whole speaks and that's all and we like
[2:22:47] that because we have no bishops or
[2:22:48] hierarchies or overseers and so forth to
[2:22:50] tell us this or that or the other
[2:22:51] there's no headquarters you know except
[2:22:54] above it's the Holy Spirit in the church
[2:22:56] does the speaking and by the brand said
[2:22:59] I like that rule and it's very fine
[2:23:03] so with that I guess so the brothers
[2:23:06] will hand out the ballots and
[2:23:09] vote
[2:25:32] okay well the accounting has taken place
[2:25:36] that's
[2:25:38] this is the interlude against you know
[2:25:40] realness we'll just have a song here
[2:25:45] what we're saying I have been blessed
[2:25:50] times we stand for a change of position
[2:25:53] it's 1229 up there so that's just saying
[2:25:57] that you might note on this that I've
[2:26:01] inserted an extra verse which was given
[2:26:07] to me by brother Faisal and it was a
[2:26:09] blessing so I will get into the third
[2:26:13] position and you'll see it but we've got
[2:26:16] a lot to be thankful for
[2:26:19] [Music]
[2:26:21] you know and it really strikes home when
[2:26:23] we see that it was on a video you know
[2:26:27] we've been blessed beyond measure in
[2:26:29] better general would put earlier we're
[2:26:33] rich and we're blessed and we need to
[2:26:37] demonstrate our thanks to God for what
[2:26:39] he's done for us but you know sometimes
[2:26:42] a question who's the most blessed us or
[2:26:44] them oh that are being persecuted let's
[2:26:48] just think about it but give God the
[2:26:51] glory for what he's doing for us when he
[2:26:55] wants so much all that he does
[2:27:02] [Music]
[2:27:16] even
[2:27:29] not so good to me

[2:39:54] Lord I never thought I'd see the day
[2:39:59] where Christian churches would be
[2:40:01] persecuted and have the clothes down I
[2:40:03] never thought that that would be my day
