amen we want to have faith that we can make it no matter what comes against us amen no matter what we're facing no matter the trials The Temptations the difficulties the lack of people in the service it doesn't matter amen there's nothing going to stop the bride of Christ from making it over to the other side amen thank you musicians that'll be it this morning amen if you would turn in your scriptures to Second Peter chapter 1 this morning certainly didn't expect to be up here this morning but trusting that God has given us a message for the people this morning and that he's leading us and guiding us and that it'll be a blessing here this morning amen amen God bless you each one this morning wherever you're gathered just praying that God will be there with you as he is here with us in the service amen second Peter chapter 1 says Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kind kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen we'll just bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're trusting you this morning once again Lord we're trusting your Holy Spirit to anoint the speaker to anoint the hearer Lord to go into each home to go into each heart and soul lord to deal with us this morning Lord just grant us Grace to give it Grace to receive it Heavenly Father Lord meet the needs Lord you know what's in each life what's in each Heart Lord what each desire is and we pray that you would just Minister this morning Lord set me aside Lord and may you speak from this Pulpit this morning we ask Lord we're trusting you we're trusting the shed blood Lord to cover every mistake Lord every little thing every big thing we've done Lord we're claiming it this morning Lord we're saying we're sorry for where we've fallen short Lord and we're asking once again that you would strengthen us for battle Lord that you would make us fit for Kingdom Service in your name we ask and pray amen amen you can have your seats this morning we want to continue again on the Royal seed series I'm going to continue on the final Harvest and I've studied and I've prayed and just dwelt on things for so long on this and I'm I'm really struggling to close it out because as I was telling brother Paul before the service when we talk about the Royal seed we're talking about a predestinated mature bride and just about everything in the scriptures can be tied into that for us you know so I am going to try and bring it to a close not today but certainly soon but um anyways we'll see where the Lord takes us and and what he lays on my heart but we are going to continue this for just a little bit more this is a bit of a different scripture perhaps to take in second Peter 1 this is the statue of a perfect Man chapter and uh maybe not something you'd expect when we talk about the final Harvest but uh we want to so often we're talking about you know an Endtime bride and we're talking about signs and wonders and great Miracles and these things and we should be expecting those and we have seen those things amen we've seen those things not just in brother bram's Ministry but we've seen it in a worldwide Ministry and even in our own church where God has come down and done things sovereignly and miraculously in our lives but we don't want to just leave it there because remember we've read the scripture where they said they'll come in that day and say hey we did all these wonderful things in your name he says get away I never knew you right and it reminds me of where he talked to the Pharisees and they he says you know you tithe all the way down to your mint and your cumin but you forget you neglect the weightier matters of the law and what is he talking about he's talking about the day-to-day life he's talking about the application of the word not just the literal law that they were doing amen so this morning we're going to get down to the day today we're going to get down to where the rubber meets the road and literally I had something where the rubber meets the road happened last week I was driving and a certain incident happened and right after that incident uh God just kind of stepped into the car and dwelt with me for a little bit to to deal with me on some things and so I'm going to share that with you this morning what happened and kind of what God was was opening up in my life but I want to be very careful when I as I preached this morning that the sermon is based on what I experienced that day and it's based on what God's working with me on and whenever God deals with you on something it's always very raw it's always pure it's always bright and there's no getting away from it and so I would expect that as I share with you what he's doing with me it's probably going to have a similar effect in your life and I'm hoping that it'll have the similar effect in your life because God when he does these things it's a supernatural event and nothing is hidden from God we know that amen he sees all things so as I'm speaking this morning as I'm bringing this this message to you this morning I don't want you to fight it amen I don't want you to think well brother John knows about this or brother John knows about that I'm preaching to myself this morning I'm not looking at a certain situation or certain people or anything like that we've all got needs we've all got issues in our lives amen but I'm preaching to myself this morning and I'm letting the word go out and do what it needs to do in your life amen sister Morin shared this with this this scripture with me a couple years ago and it's stuck with me ever since and it's Ephesians 5:13 I just wrote it here on my notes it says but all things that are reproved are made manifest by by the light for whatsoever do make manifest is light what it's saying is whatever reveals something is light in Darkness Darkness doesn't reveal Darkness amen Darkness doesn't reveal what's hidden there but light is what reveals what's been hidden and it's what makes it obvious what makes manifest what is actually in the room what's in your life and these things amen so in this service I'm not looking at anyone and I don't want you to look at anyone else amen let's look at ourselves let's look in the mirror of God's word and let's say Lord what would you have for me this morning amen again nothing targeted I'm looking at my life it's a big enough challenge to deal with myself I don't want to be dealing with other people as well you know let's just let the word of God have its effect in our own lives and trust him to work in the person next to us as well amen I've been dwelling a lot on the fruits of the spirit in my own mind and in my own study you know we're talking about the final Harvest and we as we talked last time it's the Fruit Harvest amen it's the richness of everything it's the juiciness it's it's the good harvest it's the best tasting Harvest it's it's the best for your senses and these different different things it's where the new wine comes from and all these different things and I've been dwelling a lot on that and we're going to focus on just one area of that maybe this morning and we opened up with that scripture in second Peter 1 and brother Bram says this is the statue of a perfect man scripture but he's referring back to Ephesians 4 and I'll put it up here real quick it says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers amen so this is the five-fold ministry and this is critical for the believer you have to have all five of these in the believer's body amen he says and what's it given for verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ amen so we'll see the purpose and effect of the fivefold ministry because it's made apparent here and that's that it brings maturity which is perfection and edification which is growth and a positive impact amen scriptural and spiritual it's going to have a scriptural effect meaning what the word says they're going to do it's going to happen in the people's life and it's going to have a spiritual effect and that it will raise and it will Elevate the people to another plane another level in their walk with Christ amen if this is not what's coming out of the ministry then they are not a true Minister literally it's that simple if that is not the effect of their Ministry if a church is stagnant if the people aren't growing then there's a problem and it's not just the people it's going to mean the ministry is not effective and needs to be moved right that's what you got we're talking about real ministers now and then we're talking about men with calls in their lives from the foundations of the world not put there because somebody voted them in not put there because they thought this or that but because the proof of their Ministry is in the people that's the only proof of their Ministry is in the people when we're talking five-fold it's got to be seen in the body of Christ verse 13 says till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so there is also an ending to this fivefold ministry and by that I mean there is coming an end to the effect of them because the scripture says they're given for this purpose until we all come into the unity of Faith what's that Unity of the faith it's a Rapture so trusting that every real Minister will go in that Rapture amen but there is a short season at the end where we are done and brother Bram alludes to this multiple times where he says there comes an end where all you're doing is you're casting your Pearls Before Swine you're literally preaching only to the lost because everybody's done it's a finished work and there's a quick short work that's done and when that's done now you're just resting in the presence of the son and those ministers they'll keep preaching the word because that's the that's the unction in their life amen that's the drive of the holy spirit in them but there comes a point where it's everything's done right the bride's sealed everybody's in and then there's that quick short work at the end and even you think about when the dead rise first and they spend that bit of time with us nobody's coming in after that brothers and sisters that's it that is the culmination for the Gentile and so you're going to have those 30 to 40 days that brother Braham talked about pointing back to what happened with Jesus day where those Saints dwelt for a while and then they were caught up with Christ and they were gone amen there's a time where this is going to end where it's not going to have an effect they'll still keep preaching but there is an ending to this natural Ministry amen but it also points us to a time where there is a season for a mature bride right A Perfect Bride that Perfection does not speak of a lack of uh flaws or or sinlessness but rather it speaks of maturity amen because we're still in sinful flesh and so we can never get rid of that amen but when it's all said and done when we come to the unity of the faith just before that rapture is the bride going to have she's going to have a revelation of who she is what she has and what to do with it and me that's what we're looking for here that's the maturity of a bride is when she knows who she is amen my wife knows who she is and her name is Blanca klette amen it's not Blanca neis anymore it's who she is she's attached to me she knows what she is she knows she's my wife and she knows what she has everything that's mine is hers and everything's as hers as hers right no sorry what she has access to everything that that's mine amen she knows who she is she knows what she is and she knows what she's supposed to do with it because I've authorized her I've given her power to use what I have for the benefit of the family that we've made together amen so Paul points ahead to this time and then Peter now as we read in the first in the in the first scripture that we read he pulls up the old tablet and he starts writing down what this stature of a perfect man looks like and this is what brother brandham said so we're going to walk through it here a little bit this morning and just drive some things home to set a foundation so he said Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness now that's not just life as we walk through this world but that is the life amen that's all things that pertain to the life of a Believer and godliness through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and virtue I mean what a beautiful reminder we see that he says he has given us all things so when you say I have lack it's not because it's not there it's because you haven't taken advantage of it amen that you haven't laid hold of it but he says he's given us everything that we have need of as it pertains to the Christian walk and to Godliness as in the requirement of us to live life a certain way brother Braham says this he says and that's the way a Christian is we are planted together in Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life we're planted in Christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything we have need of for the Earthly Journey Divine Healing the power of God and all these other things is in every individual in here is in every individual in here that's receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost for you are planted in Christ he says hallelujah the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need of for this life's journey even the Rapture is right in you then amen Divine Healing the power of God he says even the Rapture is within you right now why or how by the baptism of the Holy Spirit so you say brother Jonathan we need to pray we have need for this we have need for that no we have it all already right we've covered this in in in great detail in the last few weeks of what we have within us when you have the Holy Ghost everything is within you and the Holy Ghost is there to Quicken you to God's word so it's not that we don't have that we need it it's that we have to take hold of it amen we have to step into God's Armory we have to step into God's refrigerator we have to step step into God's pharmacy we have to step into God's surgical room to take care of the things we're facing and sometimes it's Inward and sometimes it's outward but everything we have need of is within us and it's within the word that is quickened by what is within us in the first place amen that's right what do we pray for we pray to find the will of God we pray to align with the word of God and then we step forward in faith when we find it the the the effect of prayer is to give us Faith to do what God wants us to do right it's not to ask permission we should be asking Lord what do you want us to do what do you want us to do I'm not saying that but rather to step into the place where we know what he wants done and move forward in faith and that's what prayer is is getting us into the mind and purpose of God each one continuing now in in 2 Peter 1:4 says whereby are given unto us great and precious promises these are given for a reason it's that the by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen the greatest challenge for us is to keep pressing forward with those with those great and precious promises do you know what the greatest challenge is for an army greatest challenge for an army is not to blow up the other guys is to keep the supplies coming so that they can continue to press forward amen that's what I was talking about when I say we have everything we have need of you look at great battle plans and the the battle is not can we beat the other guys it's can we keep our guys supplied long enough to hold what they've taken and to keep them moving forward when you look at in Iraq how many hundreds of thousands and millions of liters and and barrels of gasoline that they needed just to keep pushing through in Iraq it's insane absolutely incredible and basically for every tank you had you needed 10 trucks to supply that tank so when you got a thousand tanks what do you need a lot of trucks back and forth back and forth back and forth to keep these things supplied but we have what we need right within us that's the beauty of it is we carry with us everything that we have need when you have the word you have the sword of the word by your side and you have the Holy Spirit In Your Heart everything you have need of is right there amen you look at brother Bram he emphasized the the Gentile way of believe of accepting the word of God is Not by laying on of hands it's to accept the word and move forward amen so we don't have to have that happen it's still there for us amen we can still have people come up and be prayed for but if you've got the word and you've got faith activated you need nobody else that's it right every believer is authorized to take this and step forward and use it in their life amen so we want to have faith to do that and and Peter says here he says we've been given exceeding great and precious promises that you could be what partakers of the divine nature we covered this in another service already but it's to allow us to have the nature of God that's what the promises are for is to give us the very nature of God and it's not to build up kingdoms or to rule over people or to Lord over things but rather it's to tear down kingdoms it's to serve people and it's to surrender our will and that's how we have the divine nature of God Amen he says verse five and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue so faith is the starting point and then add to that virtue which is strength to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen so we said before it always starts with faith it always starts with faith but now Peter says it doesn't just start with faith but now it ends with love starts with faith ends in love amen you got to start with faith towards or faith for the Holy Ghost Faith towards God transforms into the faith of God and it takes you all the way to the peak the Pinnacle which is love right amen it starts with faith and you have to move past the faith point you have to move past belief and it has to step into action me it has to step into a life that's lived and then from there God starts refining that faith and using that Faith now to develop himself to develop his very own nature in you amen and the culmination of that it brings you to a place where you act based on who you are not based on who other people are right it's based on what you are not what they are amen and the problem we get into is when we start trying to do things our way when we see the issues and we start trying to resolve them with our thinking and our thoughts and our preferences and what's easiest for us rather than doing it the way that God does Amen because the minute you do it your own way you've missed the boat and it always leads to two things failure and death amen when God leaves it's a denomination all over when they kick the holy spirit out when they rejected Christ what happened they went after man's ways and man's thinking and all it's led to is death death Death Amen brother Bram said this he said God hates powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity and sincerity will bring power sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine power worship to know that you've passed from Death To Life am me there's got to be a revelation behind that worship is what he's saying you don't just worship because that's what you do when you come into church amen you you worship with purpose you worship for a reason he says here's what happened God wants to perform by the Holy Ghost and vindicate his word so the performance of the Holy Ghost in your life the acting of or the working of the Holy Ghost in our life is supposed to do one thing and that's vindicate the word he says but the church wants to perform period they just want to perform they want to put on a show what do they want to do they want to vindicate themselves right I I have to say there's that song that we we've heard before and it says I've got to prove one in I'm one in a million I got to prove I'm not like Satan Eden these things have you guys heard that song it's a message song I'm getting many shakes here but it it's never struck me right because I'm not here to prove me right I'm here to prove the word amen and it's not anything that I'm going to do that's going to do it anyway so why would I point to myself but brother Bram says the holy spirit is here to perform to vindicate the word that's what brother Bram did he always said that it was never him it was always Christ that did the healing he always pointed to the word he pointed to the promise he pointed to the Vindication of the word and said I'm just the one he's using and he left himself with that and me that's what we want to do is we want to say Lord vindicate your word this isn't about me this is about your word but when we become a part of him by the Holy Spirit then that's where the word is in us anyway so it becomes this full circle and we're just part of that that economy of God Amen but he says what vindicate the word that's the purpose of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen and Paul's talking or Peter's talking he says charity all the things you add everything up and when you add everything up then charity is the final thing that you get to and as I said this is it this is the peak this is the apex of the stature of a perfect man is love Yeah and we're going to get into a little bit of what that is man he says charity and charity means love and I'll use love instead of Charity because it's the more common word it's the more recognized word these days amen but this isn't just any kind of love when you look at what that word is it's agapo and that's God's love is what he's talking about here so you don't want to get it misconstrued with what the world calls love these days or you don't want to get misconstrued maybe with the love you have for a friend or even a spouse or these different things but rather you want to step into the tress of God's love amen we see and he just before it's interesting that right before Love Comes brotherly kindness because brotherly kindness kind of matches up more like with what the world says is love today if you think about it because the world says especially when they're talking about immorality or or unfortunate situations or the alternate Lifestyles and whatnot what do they say put yourselves in their shoes how do you think they feel right brother Braham said this about brotherly kindness he says when we get to that brotherly kindness he says put yourself in his place on the matter brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see no see be kind to him right the world twist that says put yourself in their shoes and he's saying the same thing put yourself in there but he's saying that doesn't make him right yeah he's saying understand where he's coming from recognize where he's coming from and that'll help you as you start to deal with this brother he said now listen to what he puts it on himself now in his situation he says somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God and Oneness and all the rest he said brother brandham you're preaching things that they don't even accept they don't believe in those churches and yet you keep going back to them and you preach it over and over again he said then put see brotherly kindness hoping someday see patient with him see temperent enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself strength in yourself that means to let it go out with kindness and meekness to him he's saying there's strength in you to give it in a way that he might be able to receive it rather than punching him between the eyes with your Doctrine that's brotherly kindness he's saying I have to have strength to give it to him in the way that he can receive it hopefully rather than stand in a position of I'm higher you're lower and I've got to really show you it right he's saying let's be temperate let's be kind and meek to him having faith that someday God will bring him in see that's brotherly kindness that's true love is that you would hold your position but you would be in kindness and meekness to them sharing what God has done sharing what God has offered to that person so that hopefully they'll step up into a higher plane amen but that's still not pure love and the thing is we struggle with this part we struggle to do this sometimes Amen to hold our attitude in check when we're dealing with somebody and we have such high expectations for them and they're not responding the way we do do we continue in meekness Temperance and love or do we step up and say well I'm right and you're wrong and I'm not going to have anything to do with you right but the Braham says building this Monument the building this statue see it starts off with the foundation stone Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brother kindliness now what does it do it says then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love and he controls and he is the strength of every one of those things so what he's saying here is you can literally have all of this but you still don't have it he says until you get to this you don't have this he says because God is working through all those things but it's not God they're attributes of God but it's yet not God until you get to the Capstone he says amen amen so as we spoke last service remember we went through the the feasts and the seven days and it started with rest and it ended with rest and whatnot we have here again we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven attributes of God so remember we had seven days of the feast and then we had the eth day now we have seven attributes of God and then we have the eighth attribute now what did we say the eighth was the eth day was what eternity it was that rest and what is that that is God himself amen you are in the Holy Spirit is our rest we talk about it was rest for our soul and so this is the same thing the Eighth Day the eighth attribute is God himself it is eternity and brother Bram says it's the Holy Spirit itself and that is God's love that's God's life within you I'll read it to you right here he says so when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living Tabernacle you say brother Jonathan I have all of these things yes but he says until you're there you don't have it all yet he says it it what it pours through you in these virtues and then you're a living Tabernacle then people look out and say that's a manful of virtue knowledge he believes the word Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they talking about you've never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier person you're sealed a seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the seal just the same there you are see when a man or woman possesses this then the Capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost he says if you'd come seeking the Holy Spirit and let him the faith that you got in him add to that virtue and to that brotherly kindness until you're built in the full statue of Christ then the last thing is love which God the Holy Spirit seals you to your destination so this love of God has a sealing effect Amen brother brand ties this scripture to Ephesians 4:30 which we've read so many times now we'll read it again and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption so he saying look you've got to have this all sealed this is all him but this is what makes it him amen this is all a part of him but this is what does it and here's the thing if you take this back to the very nature of the body of the bride of Christ what is it is we are the body and he is the head and he's saying it's no different for you and your life you can have all these things but you got to have him you've got to have love you've got to have God himself in there before these things can truly become subject and give out the very nature and purpose of God in your life amen cuz otherwise what have we seen we've seen people that will do all of this and you can find them in inations today they live a Wonderful Life Wonderful Life and they've got all this but they haven't done this because they rejected the word but they can still do this in sincerity and in truth as best they know it amen they live their lives according to the word as they know it and they'll do all of this but they can't come to hear and what happens eventually is they fall right and you've seen it in the message and you see it outside the message is there comes a point where they have to fall because they don't have the very nature yet they've got everything pointing to it but they don't have it yet brother brah said even when he talked about Pentecost he said what they had the gifts but they didn't accept the giver that's where they ended up amen that Holy Spirit is what glues those things together what ties them together what completes this and until you get that this is not a complete work amen you're believing unto something but you don't have it let's take it back to the scriptures we're going to Anchor this tightly this morning very familiar chapter 1 Corinthians 13 says though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol that doesn't mean much to us here because we don't have drums in here we don't have anything else that resembles it but in other words it says though I speak in tongues or interpret them if I don't have love I'm like a noisy symbol or a Gong now I don't know about you but a noisy symbol or a Gong is just plain annoying right it's just a big and it just it drives you nuts if somebody were to sit there all day and just hit a Gong next to your desk CU you're working what would you think right somebody's playing a lovely harp a nice classical guitar maybe a soothing saxophone okay gong nobody wants to sit next to a Gong all day long amen that's what he says if you don't have love even if you're doing tongues and interpretation you're like a Gong you become annoying after a while maybe immediately and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing what's he saying you can have great gifts tremendous gifts spiritual gifts right all of those things you can do Supernatural things but without love you're nothing and Paul could do all of these things so he's not speaking from a a theory here now because Paul said I speak more in tongues than any of you he says I thank God that I do and he has Faith to do all these things he's a prophet he has all these gifts in his life and he says without love I'm nothing so he's speaking from a place of possession now and he still says even all these things even though I possess them it's nothing without that love and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing right all your good works add up to nothing without the love am because there's going to be a lot of people with good works come up in the end and it may not be enough that's right brother Braham says' look at 1 Corinthians 13 He says how would you interpret it as love for though I have all these fine gifts Paul said though I give my body to be burned a sacrifice for the Lord Jesus Christ though I give all my goods to feed the poor and everything isn't that love Mother Teresa look at Mother Teresa gives everything these nuns and these people that go over to Africa and all these different places and the jungles and they they step away from all the Comforts of life he says though I give my body to do it though I give everything I have without this I'm nothing he says isn't that love but that's not Bible love see he says you're talking about natural affection instead of divine revelation of the will of God so he's saying love is a divine revelation of the will of God doing what God would have you to do rather than doing things just because they're good we should do good things no matter what but he's saying when you focus your efforts Let It Be according to the will of God and not according to your own will amen you see an element of this right this this ability to go through great trials and great suffering and Jesus own last few days amen he's going through the trials he's going through the whipping he's standing there being falsely accused and he opens up not his mouth he takes the beating he takes the spitting he takes the crown of thorns he takes the cross itself in the end and he opens up his mouth he doesn't open up his mouth does he he stands there and lets them do their worst why because of a divine revelation of the will of God for him so you can go through great things you can give your body as a sacrifice you can give up all things and it can be in the will of God but don't do that and then say because of that I'm going to heaven he's saying you no you got to find the will of God for your life to do this amen amen what was it Jesus was accountable to the word of God and what he went through he went through because the word said he had to go through it and that's the only reason why otherwise as we know many times in his life they went to Stone him and he just walked right through the crowds he disappeared why wasn't God's time but when the time came he went through it and that's only the time that we're looking for amen we don't want to suffer for no good reason brother Braham continues he says though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice and have not love I'm nothing though I give all my goods to feed the poor I'm still nothing I have faith to move mountains I'm still nothing I speak with tongues as men and angels and I'm still nothing see it's that still Small Voice that speaks down in your heart that changes every attitude makes the nature different and you become a new creature in Christ amen we've covered this again a lot in the last few days where the holy spirit inside of you brings a change in your nature brings a change in your attitude brings your senses subject to the word of God and then from there Christ can live through you amen continuing the Scripture it says charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up brother Braham said an arrogant spirit is never the holy spirit amen end of story verse five says do not behave itself unseemly that means it's not conceited seeketh not her own means it doesn't insist on your rights not just isn't selfish but doesn't insist on your own rights is not easily provoked so it's not touchy or resentful thinketh no evil that means it doesn't pay attention when it is wronged how often do we do that this is rubber meets the road folks thinketh no evil means it doesn't pay attention when it is wronged it moves past it verse six rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth it means it doesn't rejoice in Injustice but rather rejoices when truth and right Prevail amen it beareth all things that means it can handle anything charity God's love the love of God agapo love can hand handle anything anything it believes all things that means it believes the best for every person and situation hopeth all things endureth all things it means it endures all things without weakening charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail now that doesn't mean they'll be wrong it means they'll come to a pass pass and end right there's a finishing to a time of Prophecy we've got everything we need for the for the bride right now amen there's no other Prophet coming prophecy has come to an end doesn't mean that prophecy the gift of Prophecy isn't still in the church but rather it's a done deal amen it's sealed right the the plan for the Gentiles is over God's revealed to us what he's going to do and there's a time for that to enden the gifts can stay there but prophecy has ended the prophet has spoken in our age and that's it it's done there's no adding to it anymore whether there be tongues they'll cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part now Paul says we don't know everything at his time he says we don't know everything so we only speak the little bit that God gives us the little bit that God shows us is what we share with you amen so Paul's listed a bunch of things here right he's talked about prophecy he's talked about moving mountains he's talked about giving this and doing that and everything and if you went to a lot of churches today they'd say if we didn't have that in our services if we didn't have tongues interpretation if we didn't have this ministry or that one or this thing or that thing happening we'd say God has left us but Paul points to all of this which Paul had by the way and says we know in part and we prophesy in part this is all just a temporary thing this is not it this is just a part that's leading us up to something amen verse 10 though says but when that that which is perfect is come then that which is part shall be done away so he says when the fullness comes when the maturity comes when the full creation is done then that which is in part is it's put to the side so Paul's pointing again to a things where those things end or ra rather they have no effect they've they've gone past their due date amen there's no need for them anymore because something has happened because something has occurred and you don't need them anymore the fullness is there in the Amplified it says but when the complete and perfect total comes the incomplete and imperfect will vanish away become Antiquated void and superseded it's pointing to a day where things pass away and we become a new creature amen where we have everything that God has promised for us Amen brother Bram said this he said for where there's tongues they'll cease where there's prophecies it shall fail where there is all these other things will fail but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with see that perfect what is perfect love what is love God lay it let us lay aside all these little dead works and ordinances and go on to Perfection he says you see it we are perfected through Christ and how do we get into it by Holy Spirit baptism am like I said earlier we saw that happen in Pentecostal in the early 1900s was they came to a place God was moving he had the isua Street Revival and they got the Holy Ghost people that receive the Holy Ghost and those are a part of the Bride they were recognizing the word for their day they were recognizing the moving of God for their day but there came a point where they stayed there and did not move on into the Perfection of the opening of the word there was a time where that was accepted but then there was a time where ignorance was pulled away at the revealing of the word and they said we don't want anything to do with it and that's where they sealed themselves into damnation amen that's right but what do we have we had a Prophet come in and he was pulling people now out of those denominations to form a multi-member bride from every tongue and every nation every denomination pulled them from anywhere and everywhere to make them into what the word of God for their day brother Braham says this in questions and answers he said First Corinthians says this when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all those other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things he says amen I go to preaching and then I don't get to these other things so brother Braham says look we are at that place today and he point points back and he says we have the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication why because God brought the word right he brings the opening of the seals he ties up all these loose knots all these and pulls things apart that have been scrambled up by men through all the different ages he pulls it apart reassembles it into Perfection right gives us an understanding sets us up with a proper structure of the word and then he comes behind it with every sign and wonder that you could ever ask every sign of Wonder you could ever ask we're talking about eyes being created in a person's empty sockets we're talking about limbs being restored we're talking about the dead being healed we're talking about uh uh discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart without touching anyone without looking at them even every Vindication you could expect and he says that which is perfect is here now because God has given it and Vindicated it and then after this he says it'd be a sin to disbelieve right that's where we're at he says the perfect is here right now and there's nothing left but the Rapture amen when that which just perfect is here then we see as we are we are known as we are known amen there's a time where we recognize who and what we are and then the Rapture takes us away continue the Scripture it says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things amen so what he's saying is all these things are considered childish compared to the Perfection of a divinely inspired word a fully revealed word he says all of this is fine but it's childish compared to the Perfection that's here already for now we see through a glass Darkly but then when that which is perfect is come we will be face to face now I know in part but then when that which is perfect is come shall I know even as also I am known and he finishes he says and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity and again that word in the Greek is ad agapo that is God's love and you can only have that if you have God himself amen it's a it's a higher it's higher than the than the the OS the sensual love it's higher than the filio the the the natural love that we have for you know a spouse and our children these different things and brother Braham says that love is the holy spirit it's got to be the holy spirit amen the only way you can have this kind of maturity the only way you can have the kind of perfection he's talking about is if you have the Holy Spirit and you can't impersonate it you can impersonate it but you can't impersonate it successfully because it's going to make its fruit known that's what we're talking about the final Harvest when push comes to shove you'll fall because you don't have it or you'll stand because you do have it and Christ will be living through you and and bringing himself out in the way that is required in this end time age brother BR says agapo Love Is The Love that's God's love filio love is the love that you have for your wife or your friend now many times the church gets that mixed up and they try to apply filio love which means friendship to be like aapo love but here's the difference here's a challenge Brothers if you love your wife as you should and some man would insult your wife you'd kill him because you'd be jealous of her killing's a little harsh maybe but what would filio love lead to that's what filio love would lead to but agapo love will make you pray for his lost soul that's the difference so somebody does something wrong to somebody you love and he says the reaction of agapo love is to pray for that person that's the difference that's a tough standard isn't it I'd rather to have somebody insult me than insult my wife most of us would or your children you know situations like that or your mom or your dad you'd rather they came at you than go after those that you love you can maybe absorb it a little easier but we don't tend to do very well when somebody's working on somebody else that we love amen that's right I think many times we'd punch him out and then pray for his lost soul wouldn't we wouldn't we yeah but we're talking about supernatural love now we're talking about a higher plane of love we're talking about some something that's greater than you could ever imagine before you got the Holy Ghost amen so that's all to set the foundation this morning now I want to share the story of what happened and why we been what we've been building up to and then we'll take it all the way to its its conclusion so I was driving down Cherry Lane the other day now Cherry Lane is the road the main road that leads down to our house if you've driven it you know that there's a couple things about it that can make it a little bit dangerous it's very windy it has up and down so you have hidden traffic coming and going you have people walking on there's no shoulders and there's no sidewalks and now with the snow on it there's sections or there were sections until the warmer weather came where the snow's built up so you can't even see around the corners and so you don't know who's coming you don't know where they are you don't know what's awaiting you right so there's a lot of blind spots in there and I've learned to Drive slowly on the road because of that I've seen what can happen when you drive quickly on that road and it's never going to be a good situation amen so as I came to literally the first curve I slowed down and I had my head way to the left trying to see around it to see if there's anybody waiting for me and as I got to that curve an old lady zoomed right through the middle of the curve didn't stay on her side just came right through the middle of the Cur and I slammed on my brakes and she zipped past and continued on her Merry way all right so I was able to stop I kept all the way over on the right hand side real tight and she just zipped past the front of my bumper and and that was that you know and if she continued driving like that I think I kind of feel like I was one of job servants and I alone am alive you know to tell you what happened here but she just she didn't even blink she just continued on right just completely oblivious to what happened amen now I'm an experienced driver I'm not always a mature driver and typically in a situation like that I'd probably mutter something or yell something in my car towards that person that was highly uncomplimentary of their driving skills right that's the natural way to do it let me stop here and say this one I didn't do it I just shook my head and continued on but I want to stop here and say one thing and that's that if an accident had occurred it was not my fault I did nothing wrong there she was in my Lane she was driving too fast she was cutting the corner she wasn't driving according to the road conditions it was all on her if an accident happened it was going to absolutely be her fault legally okay but as soon as that happened the Holy Spirit dropped down into that car and it's was like he lit a fire in that car at that exact moment and he started talking to me about what just happened and he said the accident didn't happen and it's not because she did anything right he said the accident was avoided because you were an experienced driver you've been down this road before you knew the pitfalls of the road you knew the attitudes of drivers there You' experienced this sort of thing before so you prepared for it you were expecting it and because you knew all these things because you were experienced in this road that you're on that's the reason that this didn't happen amen I was on that road with an understanding that I was not just going home but that I could potentially be faced with somebody that was going to wreck my car and on that basis I went down that road with a full knowledge that something could happen and I needed to be aware for it I need to be driving defensively to make sure that something didn't happen to the best of my ability amen so when the near accident happened I was ready for it I was driving slowly I was tight in my Lane I was looking around the corner I was ready with the brakes and so as soon as that thing started to happen what happened I reacted and the Holy Spirit said this is what a mature believer does every day of his life this is what you're going to face day in and day out week in and week out year in and year out and I wrote down exactly what he said here he said maturity is using your strengths knowledge gifts and experience to make up for the lack of those things in somebody else so I got home and I had to study that out because you never know what could be telling you things sometimes you know I can have lots of emotions and lots of feelings and these different things but I had to study it out amen but he said that maturity is using your strengths knowledge gifts and experience to make up for the lack of those things in somebody else and we've been talking a lot about love this morning and this is what it is amen so I went home and I read about charity in first Corinthians 13 how it doesn't rise up how it doesn't react maliciously how it looks for the best in people how it endures and I knew that that was God speaking to me and then he started to say to me he starts opening up different situations and he says are you acting like a mature believer like I just told you right are you using your maturity to compensate for the weakness of somebody else are you using your maturity to allow somebody else to live another day and grow a little more how often are you the enduring one or are you insisting on your rights are you insisting on talking about that person are you talking about their problem rather than using your gift or your strength to make up the difference is your pride rising up instead of conquering love that was a real challenge for me amen sometimes what are we doing we're standing on our high horse of maturity and we're looking down our noses at people that don't have the thing that we have and what is it we say I know they have the Holy Ghost so I should be able to expect this reaction I should be able to expect this sort of uh of life from them and I'm not getting it so I get to hold them up to the word and say that they're lacking but that's not what we've been reading all about in the scriptures right doesn't mean that we hold them up brother Bram says if you see somebody do something wrong what do you do you pray for them right but in the meantime it says charity endures all things it endures all things without weakness without failing amen so the question now became not with what do you have because so often when we're looking at this topic of the final Harvest and the Royal seed and a Rapture Ready bride we're looking at ourselves and we're saying I've got it or we're saying what do I have but now it comes down to not just what do you have but how are you using it amen what is God using it for in the body to support those that don't have the very thing that you have because here's the thing we're not all the same every one of us is not the same we have the Holy Ghost but we're not built the same way we don't have the same Outlook we don't have the same preference we don't have the same spouses we don't have the same way of going about our lives we don't have the same jobs we don't have the same intellect we don't have the same physical features none of these things we're very different amen and each one of us is given for a purpose and so when you look at something like this happening we have these high expectations and we say I should be able to get more out of them than I'm getting but the point is God's given you a strength to make up for their weakness right God's given you a way of doing things that covers that up for them that supports them and they may never be that strong in that area because they're not called to you're strong in that area because you're that part of the body am man if you're going to lift something you need strong legs and a strong back you don't care too much about how good your ears are when you're lifting something heavy so when you're dealing with an ear in a heavy lifting situation don't expect it to be super strong it's not meant for that it's meant for hearing right but sometimes we look at someone and because we're so strong there we say they need to be as strong as me that's not what the scripture says we'll get into it we'll get right into it in the word here we'll lock it down amen we're supposed to be helping to make them a better Christian amen we've got to give them space to become a new creature in Christ to grow more into the stature of a perfect man James 5:116 says confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much the scripture doesn't say confess the other person's faults to them or others go to Joe and say brother Joe you're too impulsive let me tell you about how impulsive you are right why his strength is that spontaneity that ability to work with people quickly and get into things same thing that gets them into trouble my wife said my greatest strength is that I never change my greatest weakness is that I never change right remember when we were at our house we were talking about the different attributes of the people in the room and we kind of were trying to sum it up in one word and the one they picked for me was unwavering which is great if you're if you're wondering about where I'm going to stand when the word comes up not so good when you're talking about paint in the house if I don't like it I'm not going to change am I you don't want to be unwavering in all things that strength is also your weakness and so you've got to balance that out and if you look at your spouse most often they're balancing out where you're weak that's why God gave them to you is they bolster you where you're weak and they bolster you you bolster them or their weak as well amen so we don't go around confessing another person's faults to them or others but rather it says pray for one another you go in a spirit of humility and you share your weaknesses and where you have what growth where you need growth in your life and you talk that over with somebody and then all of a sudden now an honest conversation happens because they know that you're not there to attack you're not there to put them down you're not on some high horse and now all of a sudden you start to get into fellowship and it turns into a prayer meeting that's what James says turns into a prayer meeting and says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much it means it does a lot it's very effective amen amen when you're in the Ivory Tower of your of your own righteousness you're pretty much useless to the body you know what and you're fixing for a tumble that's what's going to happen amen like me in my car it would do me no good to be sitting there in my wrecked car that got smashed by an old lady that didn't know how to drive saying I'm right but yet that's where we stand so many times as we stand there and say according to the word I am right and there's a wreck that's happening all around us and we're so happy to be right that we're not worried about the damage that's being caused right rather than trying to stop the damage we're trying to stay in the I'm right place right I much rather say I avoided that and my car is in one piece then sit there and say yeah we had a wreck but she came on my territory and I stood my place and she hit me and she wrecked my car I'd rather my car just stay the way it is now you know amen we want to get to a place where our initial reaction is what Grace not judgment and not fault finding amen let's clinch this down as we continue now first Peter 4 says and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves fervent charity hot boiling right this is not just a little campfire this is a white hot torch of love he says for charity shall cover the multitude of sins it says use Hospitality one to another without grudging what's Hospitality that's when you have somebody else over isn't it that's where you serve that's where you give of your goodness and what God has blessed you with for their betterment you're serving rather than receiving your giving what you have to others right this is not just natural this is spiritual now verse 10 says as every man ha received the gift even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God and says there that that love covers a multitude of sins how many times they ask Jesus how many times do we forgive my brother how many times do I forgive brother Bob 70 time 7 that's 490 chances are you're not going to count to 490 and his point was do it until you can't even remember how many times it's been done keep doing it keep doing it keep doing it why because charity covers love covers a multitude of sins right and it endureth all things and it never fails the Amplified for verse eight says above all things have intense and unfailing love one for another for love covers a multip multitude of sins in other words it forgives and disregards the offenses of others amen the last verse verse 10 says that we have received gifts and because we have received the gifts of God in many ways and it's all Grace to us we're told to employ them in the same Grace now to those that are around us amplifi verse 10 says as each of you has received a gift which is a particular spiritual Talent a gracious Divine endowment employ it for one another as befits good Trustees of God's many sighted Grace as faithful stewards of the extremely diverse gifts and powers granted to Christians because you warranted it no by unmerited favor amen you have a gift he's saying use it for the betterment of the body he's saying apply it use it hospitably amen share it with those be a giver not a taker right if you've got a gift of patience the very people you should be patient with most are going to be Believers amen use it in the body to play the long game enduring holding on to situations keeping people in prayer when you see shortness you know in their walk with God when a situation doesn't go the way you want to say Lord I'm holding them up in prayer I'm not going to get offended I'm going to hold them in prayer and I'm going to be strong until they come around and that also keeps you in a place of humility so that if you need to do some coming around then God will work on that that way as well amen am then you have a gift of perception and you know how people react and what triggers them in these different things what do you do you use that not to push people's buttons but rather you use it to avoid those buttons so that you can be a goet so that you can be a help so that you can have the hard conversations so that you can have real Fellowship without causing them an offense in doing so amen because what we'll have is we'll have P perceivers standing here and they can see all the things that are happening or the potential troubles but they're in a place of self-righteousness and so all they do is they go and tell people you're doing this wrong you're doing this wrong you're doing this wrong but they don't have the attitude of Grace to go with it to make it easy to receive they end up offending that person rather than helping them amen so what is he saying don't stand on your gift and Lord over people but rather use it to support them and grow them in Christ amen share it with them put it to good use remember the the parable of the of the servants and he gave one of them 10 and one of them five and one of them one or two and one of them went and he doubled it right five went to 10 I think two went to five but the one that had one he bar it in a nap he put it in a napkin and buried it in the ground he didn't use what God gave him right and that's the one that got cast into outer Darkness wasn't it God's given so many gifts to us here so many gifts I can't believe how many gifts we have in a small church but the thing that comes up with those gift off times is that it causes friction with somebody that doesn't have the same gift because you can't escape it in a smaller Church you can't escape these things we're so close together and that's great when it's great but it's not so great when it's not so great you know it's like it I mean look at it look at your own marriages look at your own family we're in a a lockdown here and so we're stuck in a house with our whole families 24/7 there's no breaks from each other is there unless you go outside for a walk or something like that we're with each other 24/7 and what does that do it highlights the differences and it brings friction and what Paul's saying here is it should be highlighting the love that God has given us in our hearts and souls and that's what should be reaching out in these situations not frustration right not disappoint right we're not supposed to be highlighting those things but rather we're supposed to be supporting the weakness of the other and bringing Christ through it all amen so when your strength meets their weakness what should it do it's always a support and never a weapon right if they're going to use a weapon use it on the ones outside of the body amen not the ones inside of the body brother Bram says this now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at this is from the message straight As the gate he says and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind hard to do when you've got a complex right that's why we need Supernatural love remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's in wrong see just pray for them and love one another and then without that you're still a child in God's eyes that's what Paul was saying remember when I was a child I spake as a child and did all these things as a child but when this came I put away childish things right you have nothing until you have this love 1 John 4 says we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth us not hereby know we are the spirit of Truth and the spirit of error beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in is love not that we love God but that he loved us see it's the other one doing the loving right it was was the one that brought us to him not we didn't go to him he brought us to him that's what the love of God does is it brings the one that's maybe outside that's weaker that's lost that's that's not as strong it brings you to them right you draw them to you you don't push them away because of their weakness it says and he sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we also ought to love one another no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us he says no man seen God but if you love each other then they will see God in you verse 16 says and we have known and believed the love that God had to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world as Christ was so are we supposed to be there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear had torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love right so often that's what we're reacting to right so we have fear we have fear of rejection we have fear of embarrassment Joe and I were talked about this yesterday about a situation you know with Ravi Zacharias many options were given to him many many times he was given the option to come clean and he didn't why fear fear of the embarrassment fear of loss of influence fear of loss of uh uh employment and income and and these different things fear falling in the people's eyes and that was worth more to him in the end than coming clean and getting delivered from something like that amen that's what we don't want and perfect love will push us through that to get us to do the harder work yes share a bit of that in the end verse 35 or 19 sorry we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he ha seen how can he love God whom he he had not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also man brother Braham tells a story of going story of going beyond the curtain of time you know where he saw his first wife hope and his daughter and these different people and just listen to how he finishes this story he says and I heard a voice that spoke to me that was in the room and said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost we're talked about on the other side on the beyond the curtain of time in eternity this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there was no jealousy there was no tiredness there was no death sickness could never enter in there mortality could never make you old they could not even cry it was just one joy and that's what waiting for us on the other side we talked in the last service about that rest amen the the final feast and it started with rest and it ended with eternal rest didn't it and this is what brother br's poting to this is the final portion of that rest and this is what it's going to look like in eternity Beyond this Veil Amen brother Bram says oh my precious friends my beloved my darlings of the Gospel my begotten children unto God listen to me your pastor he's speaking to his bride the bride of Christ now I wish there was some way I could explain it to you there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last last breath is the most glorious thing that you ever there is no way to explain it there's no way I just can't do it but whatever you do friend lay aside everything else till you get perfect love get to a spot where you can love everybody every enemy everything else I mean I don't have it here I wrote it briefly in my notes or Brea they asked Jesus what was the greatest commandment he said the first and great commandment was love the Lord thy God with all thy heart soul and mind then he said and the second one is love thy neighbor as thyself and he says everything you've been taught hangs on those two Commandments love God first and love your neighbor as yourself amen that's it it's literally that simple amen what a challenge to us I had a challenging week I woke up to a challenge this morning I had an email waiting for me that I was not expecting didn't enjoy it and that was a it was literally a direct challenge of what I do what I what I'm talking about here this morning not from any in this church you're all good it was waiting for me and it was like a slap in the face it was like a slap in the face and I and I sat there and I struggled and I said Lord what's this all about until I got to the place where I was praying right because it's not easy to do it's not easy to do but if you can hold yourself in check right wait pray ask the Lord how you'd have him how he'd want you to respond now you can move on with something something right but literally just this morning just this morning you don't get to preach this kind of thing and not get it challenged in your life amen you don't get up here and get a free pass God's going to require it of me the same as the hearer amen none of us gets by amen but we want to get to a place where what where that Holy Spirit would so fill us to that reaction is Grace Grace Grace every time where we Overlook to where we endure where it's unfailing in our life that somebody can go over and over and again make the same mistake bother us the same way offend us the same way disappoint us the same way and we forgive forget forgive forget support support support and pray pray pray until they break through into the victory Amen brother Bram said this as we close he says I'm more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy I want to ask what would you hold on to here that would make you want to miss that right what situation what problem what relationship what position of your own righteousness would you hold on to that would go to that would keep you from going to a place where there's no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only Supreme Beauty and joy when you put whatever you're dealing with in front of that it pales in comparison I can guarantee you whatever you do he said lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter matter if the plan's rocking the Lightning's flashing or The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love if you are not saved except Jesus Christ as your savior now if you have not been baptized in water be baptized now if you have not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit receive it now press on to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time I mean I'm reminded of that remember that that that uh tongues interpretation that went for in brother br's meeting there was a translator from the UN there that that translated it do you remember and it said because thou Hast chosen the harder way it was of your own choosing a great portion of Heaven awaits for you and he says this is your victory in the love divine man we've got to have that same Victory we've got to choose to take the harder way what's the harder way way not self-righteousness it's to be supportive it's to be humble it's to work with people Amen to have Grace for people to take rest and joy in who we are not in how people are reacting at times amen what is it that's our victory in the love divine when the Holy Spirit has a fullness and it has the effect in our lives that Christ would want for us through his word amen amen if the musicians would come this morning this was a I'm thankful for God's grace this morning you know I got a call 3:15 yesterday said you're up tomorrow if you can take it I said I'll take it and I had 15 pages of notes on something else I felt to go in this direction and knocked it out in three hours by God's grace so you know what God is always looking out he's ever watchful and that has nothing to do with me that's just God puts a burden on you and it just flows out and you come into church and you try and unload the same thing amen so very thankful for that very thankful for his presence very thankful that he's still working on me amen that's right do we know that song He's still
