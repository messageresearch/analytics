Grace after Grace Lord Your Love surrounds us every single day Lord and we can't do a thing to deserve it Lord but what we can do is appreciate it Lord and we want to say this evening We Appreciate You Lord we love you Lord we're so glad that we can call you our father Lord that you've given us a revelation of where we come from Lord and with that Revelation comes the knowledge of where we're going Lord I pray You' just speak again tonight Lord that you would Minister to us Lord raise our sights a little higher raise our lives a little higher raise our faith a little higher Lord draw us into the realm of the Eternal tonight we pray Lord Lord just touch us each one we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 2 good to see each one here good to have Selena back with us as well after a long and eventful and not on time trip but trust God's in it always amen like we said before all things work together in isolation they may not seem like much but God's always got a purpose and a plan for these things amen Acts chapter 2 verse1 very familiar scripture says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come and they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening we're going W right back to our series on the Holy Ghost on the token life and the the last service we took on this we preached on how do I receive the Holy Ghost then I want to go to the next obvious question and that's how do I know I have received received the Holy Ghost amen this is the biggest question you need to answer in your life today we want certainty in this world everybody's looking for certainty everyone if they they're going to invest money they want it to be certain they're going to get a return on it if they're going to take a job they want certainty it's going to work out if they get married they want a certainty that their spouse is going to stay with them and things are going to go well but I'll tell you one thing we need certainty in our walk with God we need to know that our Eternal destination is secure and it's the right one amen some people have an eternal destination and it's it's the wrong one but I don't want to come down to the end of this age and then find out I didn't have the Holy Ghost amen I don't want to be standing in front of the white Throne judgment I don't want to see this world tumbling into tribulation and realize oh my goodness I missed it I want to make certain today I want to make certain now I want to make certain tonight before I leave this building that I know where I'm standing that I've made my calling and my election sure amen as children of God that be that ought to be the one thing that settled is that my soul has been sealed with the Holy Ghost and if it hasn't how do I get it Lord don't let me leave here tonight without it amen because there's going to come a time and it's not going to be the tribulation I'll tell you this Satan is trying to knock us off the Revelation that we are children of God and as things come up in life we need a certainty to know that I am a child of God when sickness comes when hard times comes when struggles come when we don't know what's going on that's not the time to figure out you're a child of God you want to come into that knowing your a child of God so that Satan can't knock you off of it otherwise what happens is we get into the trial and we're weak upfront and he can do just about anything with us but before we go so far on this question really we're not going to know we're not going to answer this question today because first we have to answer another question and I open with Acts 2 and we read that verse four it said they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and to most people that is the answer how do I know I've received the Holy Spirit I've spoken in tongues but the thing is what they they haven't realized is that the Holy Ghost was given for a reason and we have to go back and ask ourselves what was the Holy Ghost given for and if we know what it was given for then that will tell us what the evidence is if I if I go to the store and they tell me that this tool will do a certain thing and I go home and it won't do a certain thing then guess what the purpose that they've told me of that tool is wrong or I'm using it the wrong way so if God has given us something and he says this is the purpose of it then the evidence for him giving it it and US receiving it will be that it does what it's purposed to do and so if we take it back to the scripture we'll find out why the Holy Spirit was set in the first place you go to a a Baptist Church and they'll tell you that that the evidence of receiving the holy spirit is that you believed on Jesus Christ you go to a Pentecostal church and they'll tell you that because you've spoken in tongues then you've received the Holy Ghost you'll go to certain message churches and they'll tell you if you believe this Doctrine or that Doctrine you've clearly received the Holy Spirit because only a child of God can receive that but we want to hear what the word has to say listen denominations change Ministries change churches change opinions change doctrines change but the word is the only thing that stands alone and unchanging so we've got to take our answer back to the word and so if we go back to the promise of the coming of the spirit of God in our lives we've read this many times but for sake of completeness we'll read it again tonight in Ezekiel 36 he says for I will take you this is God speaking for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you and a new heart also will I give unto you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of Flesh so if we look up to verse 26 what do we see if we're looking at this person's life we see the first two works of Grace we see justification justification it's going to be one of those nights justification what is it you didn't do it in the first place your sins are covered amen they're separated from you there's that's one divorce we believe in is my sin from my person when Christ died at Calvary if I put my sins and I leave them under the blood then they're divorced for me and they can't be attributed to me amen and then we see after that he says I'm going to clean you up we see a Sanctified life so this is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit but it is a work of the Holy Spirit God's working on you God's doing something in your life notice through all these scriptures he keeps saying I will I will I will I will it's all his work it's not what I'm doing it's what he's doing in my life it's what the spirit of God is doing but this is not the baptism or the infilling or the sealing of the holy spirit it's merely the work of the Holy Spirit and what it's doing is it's preparing us for 27 verse 27 which is the holy spirit himself see he's preparing you for himself and that means it's got to meet his standard not my standard and when he says we're ready that's when he'll come in so that's what he's trying to do so I can't sit here today and say I don't drink I don't smoke I don't fornicate I don't go out to bars and therefore I have the Holy Spirit no I can say the holy spirit's done a work in my life and I believe you can say that today as well but that doesn't mean I've received the Holy SP Spirit it might mean it but it doesn't definitely mean it but then we come to verse 27 and he says God says I will put my spirit within you that's the baptism of the Holy Spirit and then what happens when the Holy Spirit comes in it will cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them notice what happens Hallelujah this is so beautiful he does the final work and then we finally start doing something we can do nothing to please him we can do nothing to satisfy him but as soon as his work's done in 27 now we come out and we start to do something we start to live by his statutes we start to keep his judgments what's that that's the word of God once he's finished his work we line up with the word of God and our life starts to match what his word tells us to do that's what the work of the holy spirit is amen the purpose of the holy spirit is not just so we can hear it with our ears and speak it with our mouth but it's so that we can live it out through our life amen it's bringing us and the word into Unity it's making us one and the same thing that's why the Holy Spirit was given its purpose is not to make us speaked in speak in tongues we'll talk about that later not this service its purpose is not to give us visions and dreams its purpose is not to give us signs and wonders those are all just effects and blessings you can go through your life and not see a single one of those things and still have the Holy Spirit because the proof is that it's done something to you amen but his purpose is to get us in unity with the word of God to make God's thoughts my thoughts to make God's words my words God's responses my responses God's actions my actions God's life my life that's the purpose of the spirit it's to get me out of the way to get me good and dead so that God can come in and rest control from my dead hands and start driving my life to take over the steering wheel but why is God even talking about this why is God going through such detail to say I'm going to get you to live by my word because that's what Israel could never do they could never live by the word time and time again they come back to God and they fall away they come back to God and they fall away and so we see here God saying the remedy you need if you keep trying and never making it is to get my spirit the new birth is what will resolve the trying and the failing cuz it'll be his work then instead of my work I can stop trying and start let him do I can surrender myself to him and he can start to do something listen if we look at Israel a prophet won't change us signs and wonders won't change us the pillar of fire in our midst won't change us it takes the pillar of fire inside of us to change us that's the only thing that's going to work amen great victories won't change us great revivals won't change us great promises won't change us it takes the receiving of the promise of the spirit of God inside of us to change us I think that's one of the biggest frustrations for a professing Christian is when you can talk it but you can't walk it and as much as we try and tell other people we're living it in our heart of hearts we know we're not there yet and yet we want to be there's a sincere desire amen we do everything right we try everything right we go to church we're under the hearing of the word and there's nothing we can point to in our lives that tells us that we're wrong but yet we know we're not completely in we're not where we ought to be we're not in the victory that we ought to be we're not overcoming we're not serving our our our surrender just isn't there and we're good for a while and then we fall away again and we're good for a while and we fall away again and it just beats us up it just beats us up you can't ever seem to win the battle once or for all but if you're there tonight and maybe some of us are tonight I'm not here to beat you up I'm not here to tear you down I'm here to say you've got a work of the Holy Spirit don't throw that away don't throw away the desire in your life for the things of God you're believing you're trying you're seeking God but don't stop short of The Full Experience amen don't stop until you come into a place of rest a place of assurance a place where you know the work is finished in your soul the work never stops until we get out of here but your soul is sealed all the way to Eternity to Eternity amen you've come to a place of overcoming power brother Brown would say this he says you find them people who seem to be very religious seem to have such a deep desire and daily they search and hunt and seek for God and never come to any settlement of any kind to where they could ever be settled or Anchored In Christ and this I have learned to be an experience he says that this is intellectual people now there are two different types of Christianity I'll say two different phases would be a better word to use not two types but two phases the same Christianity but two phases of it see he's not taken away from what you have we never want to do that that has broken so many Believers when they said they've been told you don't have the Holy Ghost with no encouragement but God's doing a work you're here because there's a desire you're here because there's a call God's doing something in your life brother Braham doesn't say that he says there's two phases to it if you're in the first part that's okay but make sure you get to the the second part he says now one of them is an intellectual or a mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge and the other is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart the one intellectually is hungry he's feasting on God but his Feast doesn't hold out the other one seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing that bothers them they're just as solid and anchored as they can be no trials no storms bother them at all but they seem to have something about them that people who are Christians and trying to live for God admire that type of Christian so if I could maybe rephrase it another way that is one Christian that's in and the other one is out because the holy spirit is really the dividing line of our Christian walk really it's everything leading up to the baptism of the Holy Spirit and then it's everything that's after that but once you get the Holy Spirit your whole life changes I know I've been there I've done that you think you've got it but when you get it you realize W it is different there is more to this amen so there's a difference in the thing is they're on the same walk brother BR says they're in two phases they're on the same walk but one has reached the point of no return and crossed over the other is still potentially going back and forth he's not saying they're not both children of God he's just saying one has come all the way into eternal life and the other one hasn't I'm not saying that one hasn't isn't going to get to eternal life they just haven't received it in the form of the Holy Spirit they're just at different places in their in their walk and now brother Brandon would go from here and and he would take a type and he would start talking about the Mana in the wilderness and he would take it then into the the into the Tabernacle the the meeting place that God had designed there and he would talk about in that Tabernacle you've got three sections and you have the outer Court which is where you can see here we've got the Altar and we've got the the the Basin for washing and then you have the whole the holy place which is just inside the building and then you have the holy of holies which is on the innermost part of the inside amen so you could take that Mana remember what that Mana was it was angel food it was God's provided Feast it was God's provided food amen but that Mana would only last today out in the regular World out even into the outer court that Mana would only last a day and really what we're seeing here is a type of the Flesh of the spirit and of the soul and you take what God provides you take the word of God you take the provision of God in your soul and you can go into the outer court and you can offer your sacrifice this body needs a lot of cleaning you can go in there and you can clean yourself up but it doesn't resolve anything you have to go in every single day to do it and in the outer Court you're subject to circumstances you're subject to weather you're in natural sunlight there the wind and the rain and darkness can come there and you can't do anything about it brother B would continue and he says this he says see your faith anchors you in Christ that's intellectual you believe it you accept it you say that it's right you recognize it to be the truth and you're a Christian you're on the campgrounds man is falling and you're eating it he says but did you notice a strange thing there was a mixed multitude eating the same man people who are sinners who do not accept the Lord Jesus can still enjoy seeing the moving of the miracle of God Healing The Sick can rejoice in people doing right can open their hearts and rejoice in a sermon that's preached under the anointing we've seen it we've seen it even in our very midst where people come in and they hear anointed preaching and they come out and they're Amazed by it and they don't know how to deal with it and they just can't understand how God could come into their lives and speak that way and then walk away unchanged but in the moment they enjoyed it they didn't understand it but they enjoyed it he says that's the same type of Mana that the Christian and is eating so he's saying they're sitting under the same blessings they sitting under the same experience and it's not that these people are unaware of God quite the contrary they just haven't come in to a place where it's a daily experience rather than an occasional event amen we ought to be Christians all the time not just in church not just when we're around Believers amen the reality of God ought to be a daily thing not just a church thing not just when we're around certain people otherwise Church we're playing at our Christianity that's for sure brother B continues he says now I met people who would stand in the church and just rejoice and see them go outside the church and maybe Monday or Tuesday one just living Unbecoming to a Christian and the man or woman whoever it may be will turn again and shake your hand and say I don't want to do those things you feel sorry for them what is it the desire is there the knowledge is there but something hasn't occurred that will take them to the place of living it so they go and they're eating Mana in the outer court but you could take now that mana and go into the next realm which was the Holy place and now you're into the spirit realm and remember under the work of Grace and sanctification and just ification he says I'll give you a new spirit hey the flesh is completely unconverted the spirit at least is new from him it's not his but it's new from him it's something that can get along with God so inside here now we're in something that's from God but it's not God so it's better but it's not the best and inside this place you can take that Mana now and you can move into the inner Court the holy place and the Mana though is still the same but the conditions have changed now you've got the Candlestick in there now you've got showbread that will last for seven days showbread out in the open won't last that long but you put it in a place where it's kept out of the elements and stuff it'll last for 7 days but that Mana still won't do it and the light is not affected by what's going on outside you don't get your hair all messed up in the Holy place the wind can't affect you the rain the darkness circumstances are shut out in the Holy place but you're still depending on your works because the light that's there is the light from a candle that you have to supply the oil you've got to keep it lit and the thing is eventually if we stayed here for billions of years we'd run out of oil and we wouldn't have enough to keep that lamp lit and it would go out and we would go back into darkness amen so it's a better place the rain doesn't soak you the night doesn't scare you the wind doesn't mess up your hair sisters but the light's still artificial and it doesn't do anything for the Mana but when you come into the holy of holies it's a whole different experience because in the holy of holies there is no artificial light there is no ups and downs it's the pillar of fire amen it's the presence of God himself and in the holy of holies you don't have to do any work to stay alive you ever realize that in the holy of holies you're in the presence of eternal life in that presence nothing fails nothing dies nothing gets sick rather the opposite is that which is dead becomes alive that's why I said you don't have to do anything in there in there is where the shikina glory of God dwelt and there's only a few things in there there's the revealed word there's the blood of the lamb and there's the presence of God it's a perfect type of the new birth it's a perfect type of the True Believer in this age amen when you got into the holy of holies now he was you weren't preserving yourself he was preserving serving you in that presence in there the presence of God brought eternal life that's why they could only go in for a little bit one day a week because that was literally the Tree of Life in there that was the presence of God that was eternal life in there in there the almonds never stopped budding on Aaron's rod in there the Mana stayed fresh why not because of me because of him he's preserving it he's keeping it fresh and it never runs out it's eternal life it's the word that keeps coming and coming and coming so in that presence if it brings out the original life then what would it do to a child of God it would bring out eternal life we couldn't stay in there that's why the veil was was was kept there until Christ died and then as soon as it's open now it's what it's eternal life is now available to all of us brother Bram says this he says now we notice that this Mana when it fell God sending it down to provide life for the children of Israel in their Journey then God told Moses and Aaron to go make a great golden pot and to fill it full of mana and put it in the holiest of holy places by the ark that Mana was to be set by the ark and there it never failed it never got old it never lost its sweetness it was always good inside there why it was in the presence of God he says did you ever meet a person that's been in there and has tasted and living on this Mana you can meet him on M Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday or Sunday cloudy day Bright Day gloomy day things going right or wrong he is always sweet always full of love never to talk or do anything wrong he's living under the glory of God he never gets hungry he never has to go to church to get built up he is just always full of God now can I stop here and give us a dose of honesty and reality I have never in my life met a person that is always like this I've met people that are almost always like this but the simple fact is we are still in a body that's 2/3 unredeemed and so we have moments at at at best we have moments where we fail where we fall where we drop down amen we have emotions we have feelings that can play with our mind we have sickness that can knock us down we get tired we don't get enough sleep these different things but the point he's trying to make here is this is a person that knows where to go to get it back brother Ram's not trying to pretend that we're all perfect we sin every single day every single one of us from the oldest to the youngest from the ministry through the lady it matters not we all make mistakes every single day but I look around this church and I look at some of the elders here all of the elders we'll include you too brother David tonight and yes your public Christianity your public Christian walk is a wonderful thing and many people would say Flawless or near Flawless but yet talking to you on a personal level and you share your struggles with me and I know it ain't perfect I know how you've had to go before God when your attitude's not right and say God my attitude doesn't match your attitude can I please have your attitude where people have crossed us up have done us wrong have falsely accused us have have cast slurs at us have ripped into our families and this flesh wants to rise up but what have we done Church we've gone from the outer Court through the holy place and into his presence and when we walk out the person that comes out is not the person that went in amen we haven't changed but what we've gone is we've taken ourselves out of the Flesh and out of the spirit and into the soul realm where there is something anchored that we can go to I have a sort of strength amen I have a meeting place where I can go before almighty God and he can take my desires that would hurt and tear down and break and respond and fight and put it aside and I can walk out and say like Christ father forgive them they don't know what they're doing even when it hurts my family even when it hurts my reputation even when they walk away say Lord Jesus forgive them that's what he's talking about a person that can go to a place where they can walk out and they're full of God again listen we don't lose the soul the sealing of the soul but we lose the feeling of our joy of our Salvation that's what David lost and it takes us going back into the presence amen of God to get back into that Soul realm I'm not saying we're one person one moment and then another person another moment I'm saying we've got to get to the place where we're letting the soul the control tower where Christ is in our life that's the one that would have the place amen where we've gone from our fleshly senses we've gone through the emotions of our spirit and we've come into that Center place of our soul where almighty God resides and there's where the change is made that's where the power is that's where the overcoming is that's where the victory is fought in one amen what happens is when we dwell on God and the things of God we get get centered again and it tells us what's important and let me tell you tonight Church our feelings aren't important our emotions aren't important our finances aren't important what matters to him is the kingdom of heaven and everything else has to be put aside everything else has to be put aside he says people go to church and they'll shake your hand in church and laugh and call you a brother and outside the church they pull a little business deal that wouldn't be just EX exctly straight for personal gain least little thing will bring that old temper back again that selfishness open up an ear to hear gossip or do something to that type that person has never entered into this pot in here they're outside this is some straight preaching tonight he says they're truly eating the same kind of mana and that Mana that they eat is the same Mana this man eats here he's saying the problem is not what they're eating he says they both have the same Pastor they both read the same Bible but one constantly stays true and humble and the other one has got his ups and downs going like this in and out both of them are eating the same Mana but one has entered in and the other one is still out he says both of them are believers unto eternal life but one is baptized with the Holy Spirit in the kingdom of God and the other one is outside eating the same Mana he says and the people have been telling us that you have to shout you have to get in here you have to speak with tongues to get in here you you have to do all these things but we find out that those things don't work I've seen people shout that lived any kind of a life I've seen people dance in the spirit up and down their halls and come back out and living horrible I've seen both men and women do that I've seen men and women dance in the spirit and speak with tongues and Shout that had a temper like I don't know what he says there is something wrong and yet they enjoy the blessings of God they believe in it they have faith in it but it's only in this outer Court it has never come to the inner Court he says they've never got from here the Mind down here to the soul that's what's the matter with the churches today so we see this distinction here and I know we're familiar with the idea that you can be around God you can be in the atmosphere of God you can be in the blessings and provision of God and yet you can be outside of Christ you can be Anointed with but not have it in you can be associated with it and not have it now that's a hard thing for people to understand but again if we go back to the original type which is Israel they had every benefit of the presence of God they had food every day they had water they had shelter their clothes didn't wear out they had the pillar of fire they had a prophet they had the word they had signs and wonders they had protection but only two of that original generation went in they had every aspect of the benefits and attributes of the presence of God and yet only two of them were true children of God that went in you've got Moses and Aaron as well that died beforehand but you've got people there that literally were under the anointing the personal presence of God over that entire camp with every blessing that it could offer and they were not children of God remember association with it won't get you in the foolish virgins were with the wise virgins they didn't get in they were around a lot of oil but they didn't go in remember the promise was that it would be in us not just around us God had been around them an awful long time but it was getting in them that was going to be the promise amen he says the heart is the Abode of God and in the Old Testament God dwelt in his glory over the ark and the Ark is the heart God dwells not in the head but in the heart he's not known by theology or by mental conception he's known by an oldfashioned Sanctified Born Again experience that's in the human heart he says yet men and women live a good life and love God by mental conception but the real hiding place is in the heart hidden with Christ and when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in you catch this with your temperament and he is living his own life in his own will through you Hallelujah he says so yielded you are that Christ speaks the kind of words he would speak he thinks the kind of thoughts he would think through you he does the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting he says what a beautiful picture of a consecrated consecrated Christian yielded Christ working through see it's him that's working it's not you that's working you're resting and yielded you've ceased from your dead Works Paul said and we've come into a place of rest now I'm not trying to pretend church it's not a daily struggle that's not what we're talking about but the soul is settled there's an assurance there that we pass from Death unto life he says Paul said to me to live is Christ and to die is gain it's not me that liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in me Christ Living in the individual so surrendered when Christ speaks through the lips and thinks through the mind and sees through the eye and acts through the temperament than the things of the world have passed away he says how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the time Christ has got control amen you see it that's what it is it's Christ in you well you see he says you say I believe that to be the truth now this is perfection being spoken here that's what's available whether we live there is really a choice every day every day we have a choice are we going to feed our Christian walk or are we going to feed this flesh or are we going to feed our spirit some people are great at keeping the things of the flesh out but they've got so many mind gains going on and they're so caught up in emotions and drama that God is has no place there we can look down at the people that are home watching movies and then we're sitting here caught up in drama every single day guess what we're both pushing away the presence there's no difference we've got to push through to the holy of holies we've got to get into the soul realm amen he says you well you see you say I believe that to be the truth he says that's right it's in here he says but has it come here if it is your whole makeup is Christ your attitude your desire your appetite your everything is Christ yielded resting everything perfect no matter how dull it looks or how black it looks still it's the same Christ is in you he speaks to The Sinner in the voice that he would speak to him in he speaks to the prostitute in the voice that he would speak to them in he thinks through your mind the very thoughts that he speaks through your heart the very way that he would if he was here on Earth and you are no more your own but you're surrendered so we're kind of jumping ahead a little bit but he's talking talking about people that have come to a place of Rest In Christ and he's saying the purpose of the Holy Spirit and therefore the evidence of it will be when Christ is living through you if he's doing what he did before then you know that he's in you amen that's the purpose of the holy spirit is to make the Living Word come out to take the written word to take the spoken word and make it a Living Word and take our lives and put them into God's hands to bring us to a place where we're surrendered to him but I want to just drop something in here because we can look at this and we can think it's just a plan but church it's not just a plan of God there's a there's a much bigger sermon here but just as I was studying I had a great conversation with brother Garfield on on Sunday and it it just it really brought something out but this isn't just a plan of God but rather it's to produce what is already in eternity see we're here and we're we're in a place of an image we're in 2D or in 3D but he's wanting to bring us into four-dimensional he's wanting to bring us into the fullness of the reality of God and that can only be experienced in eternity in time it's limited in so many ways but Paul would say this in Ephesians 1 he said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us where in who him when before the foundation of the world so before we ever came into existence here we were in Christ that's our that's our origin that we should be he's chosen us to be in Christ that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so Paul says in verse three there that we right now present tense are blessed with all all spiritual blessings what are spiritual blessings you have the the the gifts of the Spirit and you have the benefits of a child of God so you have everything from prophecy to speaking in tongues you have the gift of Divine Healing you have a word of knowledge you have the gifts of helps all these different things these are all spiritual blessings but let me ask you today do we have all spiritual blessings right here right now so you can give me two answers you can give me a faith answer or you can give me the reality answer the faith answer says yes we have it but the answer really is it's available because there is no prophecy going on right now you have the preaching of the word that's a form of Prophecy I guess but we don't have prophecy going on right now we don't have Divine Healing going on right now we don't have speaking in tongues going on right now we don't well we have the gift of helps going on with the people managing the systems but the point is that we are in time and God sovereignly decides when and how those gifts are operated and used in the body so everything is available but it's not in use all the time that's not the way that it works amen what it is is we're in we're creatures in time well look at Christ you look at Christ when he walked on this Earth was anything held back from him in terms of power or authority or gift he did it all but was Christ always prophesying no was Christ always healing no was he always doing signs and wonders no but every spiritual blessing was in him but it wasn't always in operation and it's the same thing for us it's there it's available but it's not always something that we're actively using and the reality is is that they are perfect and full in eternity but when they come into time time is a filter and what it does is it breaks it down from the fullness into an image and so what we get is just a portion of the fullness in time that's what we are right now if you think about it we are a portion of the fullness in time amen so what that does is time takes the Eternal perfect and full thing and it breaks it down into an image a representation a portion of what is really there in eternity rather than the thing itself so in eternity they don't have healing they have eternal life they don't have sorrow they have joy on speakable amen they don't have pain they have pleasure at his right hands are Pleasures forever more they don't have hunger they have satisfaction they don't have comfort they have perfect rest see all of these things remember you go in the Book of Revelation says that he will wipe away all tears from our eyes and there'll be no more sorrow or death or pain why because those things are sin are the cause of sin but the things we had to s satisfy them have Blended from the image into the reality of it the fullness of it amen so what we get here is just a taste of those things we have a portion of it because we're creatures bound up in time in a body that's 2third unredeemed so in in eternity healing for our bodies isn't needed why we are in a perfect glorified body amen we're in perfect restoration before God so what's the Holy Spirit here to do it's here to take us in this time into the image but it's not going to stop at the image but it's going to transform us into the reality of what's already in eternity waiting for us the fullness of God Amen healing is just the image of a glorified body healing is a representation of the resurrection and the Rapture that's coming right it's just representing what's waiting for us which is a glorified body it's not Perfection healing is not not Perfection but it's representing the Perfection that's already over there Comfort is temporary here but it's pointing to the Eternal rest that waits for us over there amen so the holy the holy spirit's here to draw us back to the fullness of the Eternal and it of the Eternal and it's the enforcer of bringing us into that reality amen into the reality of perfection of Eternity of perfect love and all those attributes it's here to take us from The Taste to the full meal if I could put it that way amen remember what Paul said I think uh 1 Corinthians uh 13 He says here we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect comes everything else goes away right he says here we see darkly we see a little bit but we don't see the whole thing we don't experience the whole thing you ever go to a place where they give you a sampler platter what's a sampler platter it's a taste of something you can order a whole meal of but it's a chance for you to try some a bunch of little things to see what you like and then you can order the full-size thing here on Earth that's what the holy spirit's doing is it's giving us a taste of what awaits Us in eternity amen it's here to give us a sampler platter of the word and what happens is we take a little taste of it and we might be a sinner we might be completely outside of God but what happens is somehow the word of God comes our way and it gives us a sample and we taste it and we say wow that's better than anything this world has offered me can I have some more please and what do we do we go in and we take the full word we take more and more of it and even when it hurts there's something about it that keeps drawing us back to it's like chocolate even when it hurts us we still keep coming back to it it's the only thing that'll satisfy a Believer you know my wife and I we were headed out one time for a uh an anniversary getaway and my dad called as we were leaving Edmonton just two of us in the sports car having a wonderful time trying to get through snow in a car with this much clearance dad says what are you doing I said well we're just driving down the highway trying not to die he says where are you going I said we're going to B for an anniversary weekend he says here's what I want you to do he says go to the nicest restaurant you can find and have an anniversary meal and send me the bill and we said Hallelujah and so what we did is we went to a restaurant called the Bison Terrace in B and there we had the most wonderful meal of our life everything was prepared by a highquality chef and you didn't get to choose your sides you didn't get to choose what came with it you ordered the meal and you ate it as as they provided it and I ate things there and tried things I would never have liked and you know what when it's made by a chef it's perfect they know how to blend it in they know how to contrast the tastes and the textures my wife got a dessert that came with a drink who who serves a a dessert with a drink but the drink was necessary to make the dessert perfect and it was it was perfect we had never eaten food like that before probably never never since it was a very expensive meal and I I'm so glad my dad did that so we could see it amen but this is what the holy spirit's doing is day by day it's giving us a taste of what's really waiting for us and it's that taste that makes us know there's more to come and there's better things to come and there's greater things to come and we keep coming back to the word for more of a taste amen but why do we receive the holy ghost in the first place cuz we have representation in eternity amen Paul said said we were chosen before the foundation of the world in him remember he said if we if if this if this body passes away we have another one already waiting for us listen God has a closet if you want to believe it with a glorified body or a theophany body for every single child of God there's no spares there's no extras cuz why he knows every single one that's coming and it's prepared just for us and if we pass away from this Earth we step right into that that theophany that's our representation that's our representation before God and it's waiting for us to move from a time of tasting to a time of being where the full realization we won't just look through a mirror Darkly as as Paul said but we'll see him because we'll we'll be like him we'll be in the fullness of the word exactly as he is remember what Paul said in Galatians he says and because ye are Sons because ye are Sons God God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father brother brah says this he says and when was your name put on the book of life before we ever had a world you were chosen to receive the Holy Ghost in This age praise the Lord so yes we're in a plan of God but it's not just a reactive plan of God it's just not just God coming up with something to do with time this is the the God has a a representation he has a reality in his mind and we came from there and now we're here in time and he sends the Holy Spirit to us to draw us back into the reality that was in his mind in the first place amen it's taking the word to do it and it takes us and it makes that word live through us and it produces the very thing that was in his mind because that's what the word is the thoughts of God Paul says this having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times when the times right he Des it he says he might gather together in one all things in Christ remember what he said you were predestinated you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world now when it's all done he brings us right back to where we are why we have representation our names are on the book we have a theophonic Earth even in him so you can't be a part of God if you never were a part of God you had to be there in the beginning we've always been his family we aren't just his family now when we were born but we always were his family and he's Gathering us back to him and we'll see as we go through this series that the Holy Ghost is the resurrection and the Rapture that's exactly what it is it's the power of God to transform not just our nature and not just this flesh but it's to take this very body and our spirit and our soul and bring them together with that theop and give us a glorified body so we can be exactly the way Christ is amen he's Gathering us back to the great Unity of the word that's what he's doing he's bringing us back not to an existence of the letter not to the existence of a Doctrine not to the existence of an idea but back to the reality of the Eternal Living Word that's what's happening with the Holy Spirit in our lives and then we cheapen it and say it's here to make us speak in tongues it's not here just to make us speak in tongues that's it's okay it's not just here to overcome it's here to transform it's here to take the taste and bring us into the fullness of the reality take this image into the reality you know we love lots of different things for boys we might have pictures of cars on our wall listen there's a picture of a Lamborghini and that Lamborghini looks really good but somewhere there's a real Lamborghini and here what we have is we have a picture we have an image of the reality of God but some there someplace there's the reality of God and that's what it's trying to bring us back to we sing that old song You Know joy unspeakable and it says the half has never yet been told we go to the scripture brother Joe shared this this morning with the with with some people on WhatsApp and the scripture says but as it is written I had not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him well you can say well brother John we have the word that tells us it tells us but it's limited by our English language or whatever language we happen to read it in it's limited by this little tiny peab brain I have it's limited by what I think is beautiful and good and wonderful it's limited by what I think is pleasurable it's limited by me my understanding can only go as far as I've experienced something but Paul's saying listen what is waiting for you is so far beyond what you've heard what you've seen what you've thought about what you've imag imagined regardless of whether or not you have the Holy Spirit what's there is so much much further beyond what you've ever experienced here how wonderful is that going to be and we've experienced the presence of God we've experienced his love we've experienced the unity of the Brethren we've experienced healing and all these things but what will it be over there church if what we have is so wonderful as a taste what will the fullness be like but the holy spirit's here to break a break me out of the mold of what my eyes have seen and what my ears have heard because that's what limits my faith that's what limits my expectation is when I'm limited by what I can come up with rather than saying Lord let you do it your way and blow my mind with what you're able to do the holy spirit's here to get us to hear to see to accept what God has for us and lay aside everything that this mind can come up with and so the evidence of the Holy Spirit has to be tied to what it was sent for we know the effect of it we've seen it in our service we know what happens when the when the presence of God comes down in this this building or wherever it might be it has a different effect on all of us some of us shout some of us scream some of us cry some of us sit quietly some of us stand up and can't sit still some of us raise our hands some of us can't do anything just sit there limp in the presence of God that's the effect of the atmosphere but we're looking for the evidence of the indwelling spirit amen and it's a life-changing experience it's not temporary it's not occasional it's a day in day out 24/7 365 experience of God Amen we can't go out that church today and leave it here out those doors we can't leave it when we go to the gym we can't leave it when we go to school we can't leave it when we go to work it's with us it's in us we cannot separate ourselves from it otherwise we're playing around with our Christianity amen if it's not in us it's just on us and that means it can come and go but when the soul is sealed that means it's with us all the day to our full Redemption amen now we know the spirit of God the holy spirit is only for a child of God it is not for whosoever will Paul makes it abundantly clear because ye are Sons the spirit comes to you that's who it's for amen we read where Paul said that and so it's not by our choosing but it's by his choosing Before Time began remember Jesus said no man can come to the me except the father draw him first he says and I'll raise him up at the last day how by The Same Spirit we'll set ourselves up for the next service before we close this evening then we'll move on to the next part on Sunday Jesus says this he says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me have everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life now we have to be so careful here because you'll hear so many people people preach that if you believe that Jesus Christ died for your sins and you accept that you have eternal life that isn't what we see Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost that's not what we see Paul preaching we see him preach that Christ died for your sins that your sins can be forgiven but where did they always go to point to eternal life the Holy Spirit they preached you must receive the holy spirit that is What mattered that was eternal life eternal life is not believing eternal life is receiving your belief has to become sight it has to become a reality amen and so Paul would even warn of those that have tasted of the Holy Spirit it wasn't in their soul it wasn't a ceiling but they had it on them they had it around them they had gifts they had experiences they had all of the benefits without the indwelling of the spirit he says but they fall away and they can't renew themselves to repentance why they never were a child of God they never were sealed in their soul but yet they believed his word they accepted his sacrifice they did all sorts of things lived a religious even lived a Christian life but in the end they fell away they couldn't go all the way so Jesus words here are not what people take them to be because if you hear his word and you believe his word it'll have an effect brother brah said if you believe it you do it amen so if you believe his word then you'll accept his word then you'll obey his word and then you'll apply his word and then you'll receive the effect of his word that's the way it works amen you can't hear and believe it truly if you don't obey it and apply it they're all tied together so the true Christian experience is to receive the full word to get the full effect of the word right I've talked about this before and it was just a footnote in a service not too long past but in the New Testament the word here me obey it was implicit in the meaning was if you hear a word if you hear an instruction you didn't hear it unless you obeyed it why because you can't say you truly heard it and accepted it and understood it if you didn't do what you heard and it's only when you come into the New Testament that Christ separates hearing and obeying because they're under a New Covenant coming in and he's differentiating you can't just say I'm a child of Abraham we're looking for children of God CU they were resting on their on their their natural lineage amen but in in in the way they were taught in the Old Testament it was implied that if you heard something it meant you obeyed it and you did what you were told to do look at John 8 Jesus is talking to the priests here he says Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word did they hear his word church oh they heard it cuz it offended them they heard it with their ears they heard it with their mind but they could not understand it they could not accept it they could not apply it much less obey it and Jesus said if you can't accept it then you'll never obey it and if you never obey it you're never going to get the benefit of it and so these men would never have the Holy Ghost cuz they couldn't hear the word that would give them the Holy Ghost he says ye are of your father the devil you can't change fathers we don't pick our fathers he says you're of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth ye believe me not he says which of you convinces me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he says he that is of god so in other words if you're a child of God that word of means if you're born of God if you come from God if God is your father then he that is of God heareth God's words not just here he hears obeys applies accepts expects receives he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God so Jesus is giving us here the evidence of who is and is not a child of God so if you are a child of God you will receive the Holy Spirit you have to it's a etal life You' got to be on that other end you've got to be there so you've got to recognize the evidence of a child of God so you can recognize what the Holy Spirit evidence is as well and Jesus says those that will receive the word of God truly in their hearts those are children of God now that doesn't mean they'll accept it the first time or the second time or the 10th time we are creatures of time we're in a battle God has a time appointed brother Braham said a Son of God can go long time before he realizes he's a Son of God he says in fact most of them are like that little chicken that was hatched among the or that little Eagle that was hatched among the chickens it took him a while to realize he wasn't one of them and you can be raised in a message home in a Christian home pick your pick your place and not realize that you're different because sometimes we fit in so well with the world in certain ways our skills our athleticism our wit our intellectuality whatever it might be our humor whatever it is we fit in real well in some cases and it takes a while for us to realize this isn't really working and it takes the word to do that and then we realize I'm a child of God and we can step out of those things but he says he that is of God heareth God's words and this is common to us all this is how I this is just me okay when you have somebody that Hears A Hard sermon and they can walk out and say that was just for me I say praise the lord we got a child of God here I cringe sometimes at the words I say over this Pulpit I'll be honest cuz I know it hurts sometimes we get a spiritual punch between the eyes and you know what a child of God does that's me Lord amen and then they move on with God I've got to keep my attitude right I've got to keep my motive and objective right I've got to be led of the spirit in those things but we've seen it many times in our midst I've been punched Between the Eyes by ministers in this church by the word they're speaking and and a child of God says thank you Lord for letting me know rather than oh my goodness don't let anybody find this out we open ourselves to the word rather than shielding ourselves from the word that's how you know you're a child of God as you will receive it regardless of how it impacts your life your emotions your pride your ego whatever it might be why because we are ordained to receive the word and God will get it through to us one way or the other Hey listen we might flare up sometimes and duck away and say no I'm not going to hear it that's not for me la la la la la I can't hear you but he'll get through because we are ordained to eternal life we're ordained to the character of the bride of Christ amen because we're children of God but Braham says now I've often spoke and believe this great faith or fundamental truth that Jesus Christ said he that heareth my word and believeth on me that sent on him that ha sent me ha everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death unto life he says you see it he that heareth my word oh I wish I could sink it into every heart that's his word what do you have to do believe hear Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God he says and believing and applying and resting what's he saying he's saying if you receive the word if you truly receive the word it automatically means you will believe it you will apply it and it will have a resting effect on the believer amen these are all coming from the message why are people so tossed about he says you see it the word says so hear it your heart says so believe it and your whole being rests in it it's finished Jesus said the word he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me of eternal life never ending always existing life he says isn't it marvelous ever existing life and shall never perish but had already passed from Death unto life has passed from Separation on to Everlasting presence amen he says already when you are an alien from God you cease from being an alien now you are a child he says from Death unto life from Darkness unto day from Mortal to Immortal from corruption to incorruption from weary unto Joy from Death unto life and resting fully upon thus saith the Lord what did we say earlier the holy spirit's here to take us out of the image into the fullness of the reality right you know when you look at TV in the early days everything I mean they had black and white and you couldn't hear anything but they went to cartoons and cartoons are two-dimensional but now they have everything is drawn in 3D and you can see full shapes and shadows and these different things and now we've gone to 40 where you can immerse yourself in it and it can wrap around you in all of these different things that's what we're trying to do is move from just a portion a little bit a flat representation limited by our carnality and our Humanity into the great Eternal fullness of God Amen he says it's not upon feelings mental emotions Theory upon some unknown something that somebody has said to you that has no basis upon someone saying well you come and join our church it'll be finished God help us if we get to that place church if the fact that somebody's attending means they're saved a life Chang Changed by the word he says but upon the word of God the human soul rests solid God said so that settles it and makes it real amen God bless you let's stand together if we would where is our soul resting is it resting because we had a shouting singing dancing running hollering crying service does it rest on how often we raise our hands or fall to our knees does it rest on how I'm feeling close to God today does it rest on how close I'm feeling to my brothers and sisters has nothing to do with it our soul rests on one place God said it I've received it that settles it amen I want to say one thing before we close tonight you know we read about that original Church in the book of Acts and we're going to read a whole lot more about that book of Acts Church as we go through this but everything I'm seeing today not in the message but everything outside of us in Christianity is saying you cannot have an experience with God like they had you know why because none of them have it and they have stated that because we don't have it it is not available I'm here to tell you tonight if you don't have it it's available every as ask aspect of it I know of a person that had never spoken in tongues and they wanted to speak in tongues it has nothing to do with Salvation Church it has nothing to do with their Eternal destination but the Bible says you could have it and they said I want it and you know what God did God allowed them to speak in tongues and speak in tongues with the purpose of interpretation it's not held back we hold back we don't expect we don't ask my faith is not resting on the signs and wonders and the blessings of God and those different things my soul is settled because I've had a personal experience with Jesus Christ where he made himself real to me and called me and settled my soul but I have experienced many things not everything yet but I believe it's available and if we seek after it Paul said seek the best gifts but but he says but I show you a better way that was charity that was the agapo love the very presence of God in our lives but that doesn't mean we have to throw away everything else with it I'm not looking to turn us into some sort of a particular church with signs and wonders and and shouting all the time or prophecy or tongues and interpretation but I say Lord if you have a need for it give it and let us receive it let us be willing vessels for it amen but one thing's for sure you don't have to go through life without the Holy Ghost you don't have to live a cold formal message Doctrine life you can have a satisfied Assurance in your soul that you passed from Death unto life and you've got a Wellspring of Life bubbling out of you that on your worst day you still can't quench it why because it's Christ in you amen God bless you Heavenly Father Lord I love the promise of your word Lord our great security our hope our rest our trust is that you do not lie Lord that you have said it you will do it and if we are a child of God every promise in the book is mine Lord God set our eyes on the things of God set our hearts Lord on the Promises of your word Lord let us walk away from these things that so easily beset us Lord that we could have a taste of those things that are so much greater so much higher so much beyond the things that this world tries to satisfy our souls with Lord let us go out of a place of in andout and up and down lord a place of being controlled by circumstances Lord a place controlled by emotions and feelings and hurts and offenses and Rights and Wrongs Lord and come into a place where your shakina glor Glory sits us at rest Lord with your revealed word and the covering of your blood Lord we can sit a while Lord and listen and learn and be saturated Lord with the goodness of God lord I pray you fill us a new if we've received your spirit Lord I pray you pour it out Lord and if there's anyone here this night Lord that is sitting in a place of coldness a place where they have not yet reached that Assurance Lord I pray they'd seek you until they find you Lord that they would open up their hearts their soul lord that they would rest that you have offered it to your children and it is available to all that will accept it Lord your Prophet said you're wanting to give it more than we want it Lord I pray you raise a desire in our heart for more of you in Jesus Christ's name we ask it this day amen let's just sing that song More of You More Of You More Of You more of you oh

now [Music] and Hallelujah the Lord hallelujah oh that's loud um I thought I shared with you real quick um I was studying the book of Galatians today and so tied to the message that John was preaching interestingly chapter one spoke about how you um your old self comes in place of your spirituality how you're let me say I'm a Nigerian right how I want to serve God but instead of serving God based on his word I want to serve God as a Nigerian and that impacts my spiritual journey and there's an interesting thing I found in chapter 3 it says we've been introduced to God now it's our responsibility to Ure we get to know him imagine being introduced to brother brandham at this a day and age you would have series of questions you want to know how is his journey you want to ask you want to talk to him you just want that conversation so you've been introduced to God it's now your responsibility to get to know him to ask him those questions and say hey let me know more about you there's so much I you know I need to uning about you I just want to know more about you it's really our responsibility and then he ended in chapter 6 talking about how interestingly he said when you start any work your focus should be to do the job right it's not to be complimented it's not to receive praise your focus to finish it so we're trying to get to know God our focus is to get to know God it's not to be complimented and it's to say oh you're doing well we like how you sing and how you pray and all that but your focus is to do it well but he also ended with something very funny which is he said you still cannot get to know God without God you did so that would be the basis of my prayer tonight and if any of you would like to pray for me tomorrow don't worry I'm not a fan of gifts um I'll be older tomorrow just pray for me and uh pray that I I'm able to yield as well cuz I'm a control freak all right let us pray in Jesus name our heavenly father we've heard your word and it's stood in into our heart it's reassuring because it's giving us Clarity on our journey it's making us desire you more is making us cling to you more and more we thank you for using your servant to speak to us and to open our eyes to the reality of your word and building the love and the desire and that peace and joy and comfort of knowing that we have a father who loves us and who truly desire the best for us who has planned our life from the before we were even born or to the end of our journey and he is strategically being in places where we want him to be in times when we are down lord you were there in times when we are smiling you made it happen for us and for this oh Lord we ask that you give us this desire and the spirit to yield to you to your word and to your will don't let any part of us the old self the old self that keeps coming out that's logic that's morals that is that thing that will makes us think that that's the best way to serve you which is not but we all be want to hold on to you just the way you want us to we want to come to a point where none of our none of us exist but basically it's you living through us until we come to that point Lord don't let us go we ask this in the fullness of joy in our hearts and we pray for every other member of the church that are not here today we your peace be with them and that your mercy be with them as we go home Lord we also pray that your peace and your mercy go with us let the joy of our Salvation envelop us every day of our lives in Jesus name we pray amen amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] l [Music] oh [Music] go oh [Music] [Music] I [Music] [Music] oh [Music] all [Music] oh [Music] I [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] I [Music] [Music] all [Music] for [Music] Jesus I am [Music] sa the [Music] Jesus in the my soul in the [Music] the [Music] I my in [Music] the the [Music] all the I [Music]
