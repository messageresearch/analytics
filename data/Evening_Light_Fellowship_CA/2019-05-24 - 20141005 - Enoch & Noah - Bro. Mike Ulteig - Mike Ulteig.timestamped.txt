[42:46] amen something that we again is not just
[42:49] listening to something that they are
[42:51] singing but rather it's identifying with
[42:54] what's written here it's got to be a
[42:56] personal say yes you got to identify
[42:59] with the woman at the well and it's it's
[43:02] you again as our brother preached last
[43:05] night on Enoch and you and uh so and he
[43:09] was putting the emphasis on you because
[43:12] Enoch has come and Enoch is gone so uh
[43:15] now it's your your turn it's the same
[43:18] with the the little by little God works
[43:21] on us and as our brother brought out
[43:23] about Enoch last night you know in the
[43:25] 300 years after after methusa was born
[43:29] and he walked with God little by little
[43:31] by little to F to finally well brother
[43:35] something struck down on the inside of
[43:38] the inside something struck that that
[43:41] Soul right down there that Spirit right
[43:45] down there and uh he was no more he was
[43:49] gone and uh a brother brought out about
[43:53] and they couldn't find him so they must
[43:55] have been looking for him but couldn't
[43:57] find him because little by little by
[44:00] little the Revelation increased because
[44:03] you remember again that water that the
[44:07] brothers sisters saying about you you
[44:10] keep drinking that water all of the
[44:12] revealed word amen you got to drink this
[44:16] drink this but some will drink that but
[44:18] not this you know that because they they
[44:21] don't like the taste of it or it some
[44:24] might have a good you know effect on
[44:27] their lives and and and to drink
[44:30] something else may not feel so good it
[44:32] might it might taste a little bitter but
[44:35] still You' got to drink it amen so you
[44:39] got to he said are you able to drink of
[44:41] the cup that I
[44:43] drink and he said You shall indeed drink
[44:45] of it amen so thank God for his word and
[44:49] the Lord willing this morning we're
[44:51] going to dedicate uh the third child of
[44:54] our sister Priscilla and uh
[44:58] uh I don't know when the fourth one will
[45:03] be we'll leave that with the Lord amen
[45:07] and the will of God be done and maybe
[45:10] they're praying no Lord and maybe the
[45:12] Lord is praying yes my brother and
[45:14] sister my son and daughter but we're
[45:17] going to dwell on the third one and uh
[45:21] the third is is perfection but as I as I
[45:26] uh did speak to a couple in the United
[45:30] States a few years ago when they had
[45:32] their fifth
[45:33] child and uh I said true I said fifth is
[45:37] Grace but I said seven is
[45:42] completion so but it's a revelation They
[45:46] didn't
[45:47] accept and they and they came back and
[45:49] said well we we'll be we'll we're
[45:52] content with
[45:55] Grace so that's as many children as they
[45:58] had was
[45:59] five
[46:01] and and uh and they they didn't go on to
[46:04] completion when it comes to the family
[46:07] so but again uh I can say that I'm from
[46:11] a family of that went beyond completion
[46:15] and added to the body more when I from a
[46:19] family of eight boys and one girl no
[46:23] offense to the girls here but eight boys
[46:26] and one girl
[46:27] and that's what my mother had to deal
[46:29] with that's what my mother had to raise
[46:32] and uh and had to had to train and I
[46:36] must say that uh they had control
[46:40] parents had control and I pray God give
[46:43] our young parents here the control that
[46:47] our parents had amen governed and again
[46:52] for my experience I was my parents were
[46:55] governed by a again of Faith their faith
[46:58] in God they went to church we were
[47:01] raised in church we went to Sunday
[47:04] school and uh and so on and but again
[47:08] now the anointing back then was quite
[47:10] different from the anointing now and uh
[47:14] back then when the power of God was more
[47:17] present there was more of the Holy Ghost
[47:19] and now there's less of the Holy Ghost
[47:22] in the Earth the prophet of God did say
[47:26] when he was praying
[47:28] for our brother Perry
[47:30] green and his ministry ordaining him as
[47:34] it were into the ministry and he said
[47:37] Lord we know the holy spirit is leaving
[47:39] the Earth is going to leave the Earth
[47:42] and he said when he does we want to go
[47:43] with him and so there's less and less of
[47:46] the spirit in the earth now because
[47:49] those in whom he dwelt is
[47:52] gone they've been called home so there's
[47:56] fewer and fewer people with the holy
[47:59] spirit so we pray the grace of God that
[48:03] we have the Holy
[48:04] Ghost without it you're dead spiritually
[48:08] dead we need more of the Holy Ghost and
[48:12] he did say we've been reminded in this
[48:16] hour that it's going to take a double
[48:17] portion of the Holy Ghost to get us off
[48:19] the Earth
[48:21] amen Satan is here preparing his bride
[48:25] Christ is here getting his bride ready
[48:28] and he said it will take a double
[48:29] portion to get us out of here so brother
[48:32] we need to get put ourselves more and
[48:34] more into
[48:35] it the things of God the word of God we
[48:39] need to start dwelling on it thinking on
[48:41] it praying without ceasing meditating on
[48:44] it redeeming more time for God cuz I
[48:47] tell you the devil is there to get us to
[48:49] redeem more time for the world and the
[48:51] Natural Things of life and less for God
[48:55] and again I we have gone through it
[48:57] before what is the devil's
[49:00] plan the devil's plan is keep us
[49:03] busy too busy for God so I pray Grace
[49:07] help us Lord to walk in the spirit God
[49:10] grace to help us live in the spirit by
[49:13] the grace of God and brothers the only
[49:16] ones that are going into a Rapture are
[49:17] those that are in the spirit and the
[49:19] spirit in them by the grace of God in
[49:23] control not you in control but by the
[49:26] letter of the word by the Holy Ghost in
[49:29] control by the spirit of the word the
[49:32] life of the word so we pray that Grace
[49:34] in in our young parents here today with
[49:38] the young children boys and girls to
[49:42] raise them up in the nurture and
[49:44] admonition of the Lord by the grace of
[49:47] God and I was trained in such a way that
[49:50] every Sunday of course we went to church
[49:53] uh as children as young people we went
[49:55] to church three times a day and that was
[49:58] Sunday morning and again we had to be
[50:01] there at 2:00 for uh for Sunday school
[50:06] and then we had to be back again at 7:00
[50:08] for the Sunday evening service so that
[50:11] was three times a day for the young
[50:13] people so brother and now of course we
[50:16] see that people are giving less and less
[50:18] time to
[50:19] God and uh whether it's it the sermons
[50:23] that I preach or whether it's the
[50:25] worship whether it's Church whether it's
[50:28] in our homes less and less time to God
[50:31] and the thing becomes a form of
[50:33] godliness and no power we need the power
[50:38] God help us this is serious it is it is
[50:41] Heaven or Hell brother I tell you that
[50:43] it's either eternal life or Eternal
[50:46] damnation we're going to lift up our
[50:49] eyes in torment or you're going to lift
[50:51] up your eyes in the bosom of Abraham in
[50:54] that sixth Dimension and uh
[50:57] worshiping and fellowshipping with the
[50:59] saints that have gone on by the grace of
[51:01] God so God help us is my prayer amen so
[51:06] the Lord bless you as we prepare for the
[51:09] dedication of our sister Elsa Carol June
[51:15] coffee uh she should have had another
[51:18] name but that's all right for names is
[51:21] four is is
[51:24] Deliverance praise the Lord so we pray
[51:27] God to bless our our young sister today
[51:32] and it's a not exactly the world we
[51:35] would like for her to welcome her into
[51:38] but we pray the grace of God to be with
[51:40] her and the grace of God to be with the
[51:42] parents and of course also the
[51:45] grandparents also have a
[51:47] responsibility amen our brother and
[51:50] sister beg here and our brother uh Mark
[51:53] sister Moren you know they're they're
[51:55] the grandparents they think well it's
[51:57] all in the hands of mom and dad you know
[52:01] yeah but again you have a responsibility
[52:04] and that responsibility might be to pray
[52:07] that responsibility might be to plead
[52:09] the token
[52:11] constantly for them realizing because
[52:13] you realize how difficult it is to raise
[52:17] the child in the nurture and admonition
[52:19] of the Lord not the way that the world
[52:21] raises them but the way that God wants
[52:24] them rais amen the way that God wants
[52:28] you to raise them up the way that God
[52:30] raises his children amen so I pray the
[52:33] grace of God to be with our brother and
[52:36] sister be and we certainly welcome them
[52:37] from
[52:38] Tucson and U pray the grace of God to
[52:41] brother Mark sister
[52:43] Moren and uh as well as to our brother
[52:45] Joseph and sister
[52:49] Priscilla it's a
[52:53] test and I guess that uh
[52:57] I thought it's unusual that some of from
[53:00] Tucson would marry a
[53:02] newlander where were maybe somebody from
[53:05] Ohio we marry a new finlander and have
[53:09] to move further north that's good we're
[53:12] getting closer to the North Star
[53:16] amen and all everybody and all down
[53:19] Through the Ages is the North Stars
[53:21] govern the the those in the ships so
[53:24] they they look for the North Star and
[53:26] then they set there they set their
[53:28] course you know depending on which
[53:31] direction the North Star was in amen so
[53:33] God put it there for a reason amen amen
[53:37] so we're we're all there for a reason so
[53:41] God bless you and I want you to turn
[53:43] with me to St Luke's gospel chapter
[53:47] 2 St Luke's gospel chapter
[53:55] 2 that the dedication of a child is
[54:01] scriptural in the
[54:03] scriptures we find that the greater
[54:06] emphasis was put on the dedication of a
[54:09] boy a man
[54:12] child not the dedication of a of a
[54:17] girl or a woman child but in the New
[54:22] Testament there is neither male nor
[54:25] female
[54:26] to make a difference there's neither a
[54:28] Jew nor
[54:29] Gentile but we're all the same in the
[54:32] eyes of God and we all require his grace
[54:37] amen and God looks down
[54:40] to to see in us whether is male or
[54:43] female his own life and his anointing
[54:46] and his
[54:47] Blessing and we know of
[54:51] a we don't have Aquilla but we got
[54:55] Priscilla
[54:58] we know of his scriptures and as the
[55:00] Aquilla and
[55:01] Priscilla and there are sisters in the
[55:03] scriptures that God has
[55:05] used and when it comes to the word to be
[55:08] a witness of the word not a preacher not
[55:10] a teacher but you can still be a witness
[55:13] of the word you have a testimony to give
[55:15] even as a sister
[55:17] amen and we find that God has used them
[55:21] in the
[55:22] scriptures God has used them in the Old
[55:25] Testament God has used to in the New
[55:27] Testament but not not into positions
[55:31] that he had ordained for a man only so
[55:34] the grace of God to be with our sister
[55:37] Elsa
[55:39] today and we find in the St Luke's
[55:42] gospel chapter
[55:45] 2 and beginning to read at verse
[55:53] 21 in the birth of Jesus there was the
[55:56] Adoration of course of the
[56:00] Shepherds that
[56:03] came to witness as it were the birth of
[56:06] the of the Lord Jesus Christ two years
[56:12] later the wise men came to
[56:16] worship and to give their
[56:19] gifts to the
[56:22] king they had a revelation that he was
[56:24] the king
[56:29] and in Luke Chapter 2 when Mary and
[56:32] Joseph brought Jesus
[56:35] to the temple for circumcision and
[56:40] dedication they are following the rules
[56:43] that God had laid out in his
[56:46] word they were going by the letter of
[56:49] the word but we're going by the spirit
[56:51] of the
[56:52] word because we want God's blessing on
[56:55] our children
[56:57] we want God's blessing on
[57:01] us so we put forth the
[57:04] effort to bring them into the presence
[57:08] of the
[57:09] Saints praying the grace of the presence
[57:12] of God to come
[57:14] down and to anoint the
[57:18] [Music]
[57:19] child and in Luke 2 and verse
[57:23] 21 and when 8 days were accompl
[57:26] lished for the circumcising of the
[57:30] child his name was called
[57:36] Jesus which was so named of the Angel
[57:39] before he was conceived in the
[57:42] womb and when the days of her
[57:44] purification according to the law of
[57:47] Moses were
[57:49] accomplished they brought him to
[57:51] Jerusalem to present him to the
[57:55] Lord
[57:57] as it is written in the law of the Lord
[58:00] every male that openeth the womb Shall
[58:02] be Called holy to the
[58:04] Lord and to offer a sacrifice according
[58:08] to that which is said in the law of the
[58:10] Lord a pair of turtle dos or two young
[58:14] pigeons and under
[58:16] the New
[58:20] Covenant it's just not every male that
[58:22] openeth the womb should be called holy
[58:25] but sometimes it's see it's a
[58:28] female it's a little girl
[58:31] am that can be called holy to the
[58:35] Lord that you can have children you can
[58:38] have a male it could be serpent
[58:41] seed you can have a
[58:46] female and it could be the seat of
[58:49] God we have been reminded by the
[58:55] messenger that Christian parents can
[58:57] give birth to serpent
[59:01] seed and that serpent seed parents can
[59:04] get
[59:08] birth to the seat of
[59:11] God because it's not what's in the flesh
[59:14] it's what's in the
[59:16] soul
[59:17] right and then God makes it
[59:21] manifest by sending his Messengers with
[59:24] the word in every
[59:27] age and the thr out the seed of the
[59:32] word and the seat of God is going to
[59:35] respond to that
[59:38] word not serpent
[59:41] seat
[59:44] amen so whether it be a male or female
[59:49] it can be holy unto the
[59:53] Lord and we're praying of course great
[59:56] that the children that we have dedicated
[59:58] the children that you have had are the
[1:00:00] seed of God and you will train them and
[1:00:04] nurture them as the children of God you
[1:00:08] have a tremendous
[1:00:13] responsibility and he said to offer
[1:00:15] sacrifice according to that which is
[1:00:17] said in the law of the Lord a pair of
[1:00:20] turtle does or two young
[1:00:23] pigeons and behold there was a man in
[1:00:26] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[1:00:29] same man was just and devout waiting for
[1:00:32] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[1:00:35] Ghost was upon Him Praise the
[1:00:38] Lord and it was revealed unto him by the
[1:00:41] holy ghost that he should not see death
[1:00:46] before he had seen the Lord's Christ and
[1:00:49] he came by the spirit into the
[1:00:54] temple and when the parents brought in
[1:00:57] the Child
[1:00:58] Jesus to do for him after the custom of
[1:01:02] the
[1:01:04] law then took he up in him in his arms
[1:01:08] and blessed
[1:01:11] God and said Lord now let us thy servant
[1:01:16] depart in peace according to Thy
[1:01:20] word for mine eyes have seen thy
[1:01:24] salvation
[1:01:29] May the salvation of God be in our
[1:01:31] sister Elsa
[1:01:34] today and may our birth be a blessing to
[1:01:37] our brother Joseph and sister
[1:01:40] Priscilla that there is a purpose in
[1:01:44] her
[1:01:47] birth he said which thou has prepared
[1:01:50] before the face of all people I light to
[1:01:53] lighten the Gentiles and the glory of
[1:01:56] thy People Israel and Joseph and his
[1:01:58] mother Marvel at those
[1:02:01] things which were spoken of
[1:02:05] him and Simeon blessed them and said
[1:02:09] unto Mary's mother behold this child is
[1:02:11] set for the fall and Rising again of
[1:02:13] many in Israel and for a sign which
[1:02:17] shall be spoken
[1:02:21] against and may God bless sister
[1:02:24] Elsa to be his testimony and his
[1:02:28] witness yay ass sure it shall appear
[1:02:31] through thine own soul that the thoughts
[1:02:34] of many hearts may be
[1:02:37] revealed and verse 36 to 38 and there
[1:02:41] was one Anna a
[1:02:44] prophetess a female that God had used he
[1:02:47] used the male and he used the
[1:02:50] female to Bless the
[1:02:54] Child the daughter of Fel the tribe of
[1:02:57] Aer and she was of a great age and had
[1:03:02] lived with an husband seven years from

[1:03:27] totally devoted to the
[1:03:30] Lord and to serve the Lord and she
[1:03:34] coming in that instant gave thanks
[1:03:37] likewise unto the Lord and spake of him
[1:03:41] and to all them that look for
[1:03:44] redemption in Israel
[1:03:49] amen God has
[1:03:51] ordained that in the birth of a
[1:03:54] child it is to be brought into the
[1:03:57] presence of the ministry and the
[1:04:01] Saints to ask God's blessing on it
[1:04:05] amen the Lord bless

[1:19:00] having a fourth uh not right
[1:19:04] away it struck me this morning that we
[1:19:07] we may have to because if if you notice

[1:19:11] visited Zachariah and to tell him that
[1:19:14] Elizabeth was going to have

[1:19:57] going to T that long we don't know but
[1:20:01] you

[1:20:04] know sisters was a Sarah Ro Sharon and
[1:20:08] Sharon brother Brown's first
[1:20:13] daughter died a
[1:20:17] child but just shortly after when he
[1:20:20] went beyond the curtain of time and saw
[1:20:22] her she was a young woman huah
[1:20:25] that's right and yet people were taught
[1:20:28] back then oh yeah people were taught
[1:20:31] back then in the Evangelical world that
[1:20:33] if a child died it went into a certain
[1:20:36] Dimension and it was trained and and to
[1:20:39] grow
[1:20:41] up yeah there was a certain sister said
[1:20:44] she had a vision and that was the vision
[1:20:47] you know she saw the child going and
[1:20:49] went to this area and that Tri was was
[1:20:51] growing in this area where it had to be
[1:20:53] in time
[1:20:55] it had to be in time growing in this
[1:20:57] area and then after a while you know we
[1:21:00] get a certain get up to a certain height
[1:21:02] and age and responsibility then it would
[1:21:04] go on into another
[1:21:05] dimension but the prophet of God when
[1:21:09] his child
[1:21:10] died and he went beyond the curtain of
[1:21:12] time and he was walking down the the the
[1:21:16] road and he was singing the wheel on the
[1:21:19] wagon is broken sign on the ranch for a
[1:21:22] sale and then he heard that you heard
[1:21:24] that voice hello
[1:21:28] Daddy God allowed her that way for a
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:32] reason and he said I not old enough to
[1:21:35] be your
[1:21:36] dad why because she was a young
[1:21:40] woman and she told him who she
[1:21:43] was and she said mom is over there
[1:21:45] waiting for
[1:21:47] you

[1:21:51] Lord there's no babies in
[1:21:53] heaven amen so God's grace that when

[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:14] amen
[1:29:16] hallelujah amen
[1:29:19] amen praise the Lord
[1:29:23] amen
[1:29:24] you know the closest that man comes to
[1:29:27] creation is having
[1:29:30] children
[1:29:32] amen because that child wasn't even here
[1:29:35] it part was in its mama and part was in
[1:29:37] its daddy amen and neither part was a
[1:29:41] person it was potentially a person but
[1:29:43] it wasn't a
[1:29:45] person and through the through the union
[1:29:48] of a man and a woman comes a
[1:29:52] conception and I guess the old older I
[1:29:54] get and the more I think about it how
[1:29:57] that that little seed once it's
[1:29:59] conceived it becomes life and you almost
[1:30:01] have to look at it through a little
[1:30:03] microscope
[1:30:05] yeah and so science tells us that that
[1:30:08] little
[1:30:09] seed has a blueprint in
[1:30:12] there but the blueprint isn't on paper
[1:30:14] the blueprint is a is life it's called a
[1:30:19] DNA and from that one little cell comes
[1:30:22] eyeballs eyelash es
[1:30:26] hair skin cells backbone blood system
[1:30:30] nervous
[1:30:31] system out of that out of that one
[1:30:34] little
[1:30:35] seed comes comes a little
[1:30:39] child it wasn't nothing there and now
[1:30:42] it's a person that's the closest that we
[1:30:44] come to
[1:30:47] creation and yet it's become so cheap in
[1:30:51] this day of abortions and
[1:30:54] giv jilling her way and and yet it's the
[1:30:58] greatest thing that God's given man
[1:31:01] outside of
[1:31:02] Salvation is to have children amen it's
[1:31:06] a it's a great miracle look at yourself
[1:31:09] you know once you weren't here at all
[1:31:12] there was a part in your mom and a part
[1:31:14] in your daddy and now you're living a
[1:31:16] life all your own unconnected thinking
[1:31:19] talking making your own
[1:31:21] decisions praise the Lord it's a great
[1:31:25] it's a great
[1:31:26] miracle and and man in this day is
[1:31:29] trying to escape
[1:31:32] responsibilities to where they don't
[1:31:33] want to get married they don't want to
[1:31:35] have
[1:31:36] children so it's a great challenge for a
[1:31:40] man and woman to come into holy
[1:31:44] matrimony and it's a great challenge to
[1:31:47] have children
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:51] and you know to have have great
[1:31:55] children with the knowledge of
[1:31:58] responsibility that god holds us
[1:32:00] accountable yes for raising
[1:32:03] them it's not a it's not an
[1:32:06] insignificant thing with God it's not a
[1:32:10] it's not just a cheap thing it's just
[1:32:12] not a reproduction of animal life no but
[1:32:16] it's bringing life in there and then he
[1:32:19] takes a part of
[1:32:21] himself and places in that little to
[1:32:24] Tabernacle that he might come in the
[1:32:27] fullness of time with that child and
[1:32:29] place his own life in
[1:32:32] there it's a it's a great thing yes amen
[1:32:36] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:32:39] for for parents you
[1:32:45] know if we can
[1:32:48] if if we can turn there just so much
[1:32:51] that comes into your mind you just have
[1:32:53] to push it back I'd like to turn to
[1:32:55] Matthew 25 and I know that we've been
[1:32:58] here probably an hour and a half so I
[1:33:01] just pray the Lord give me
[1:33:03] wisdom
[1:33:05] uh I guess I just got a lot on my plate
[1:33:08] this morning we want to speak of
[1:33:11] Noah and
[1:33:13] our our intentions this
[1:33:16] morning is not to spend a lot of time I
[1:33:19] don't want to go into depth as much on
[1:33:23] Noah as I did
[1:33:25] Enoch because there was so many things
[1:33:27] in Enoch and probably still is in and by
[1:33:32] the grace of God your pastor will bring
[1:33:34] more things out because our identity is
[1:33:37] actually in in Enoch amen and and
[1:33:41] brother brandham when he would refer to
[1:33:42] Noah and Enoch he said in Noah you know
[1:33:46] it was it was uh it was uh eight out of
[1:33:51] that
[1:33:52] generation but he said he wasn't the
[1:33:54] type of the Rapture the bride it was one
[1:33:56] man showing the showing
[1:33:59] the uh I guess the numerical difference
[1:34:03] but there was times that brother
[1:34:05] brandham used Noah as a type of the
[1:34:07] church or the bride and he also used
[1:34:10] Noah as the type of the 144,000 we know
[1:34:14] that but we're using it tonight we've
[1:34:16] just or this morning we're we're trying
[1:34:19] to what my purpose is is to connect the
[1:34:22] ministry of enan
[1:34:24] with the ministry of Noah because
[1:34:27] remember it was Noah and lot and brother
[1:34:29] brandham said they were both preaching
[1:34:32] they were actually preaching to the
[1:34:33] totally lost at the time of
[1:34:36] Destruction so Enoch was actually taken
[1:34:39] before that
[1:34:41] time he wasn't actually in the time when
[1:34:44] it was it was already seal shut but
[1:34:48] there's a Ministry that connects those
[1:34:50] two things together yes and that's what
[1:34:53] we're looking at is the third pull so
[1:34:56] what I want to do is I want to bring in
[1:34:58] Noah tie in some things here but then I
[1:35:01] want to move on to to take this picture
[1:35:05] that we have in our mind and bring it
[1:35:08] down to the third pole amen and and I
[1:35:11] know it's going to be a lot of
[1:35:12] information and I don't want you to
[1:35:13] worry over it I don't want you to try to
[1:35:17] take a bunch of notes and things but we
[1:35:20] want we're on a journey this morning and
[1:35:23] and you know when you when you go to a
[1:35:25] place and maybe it' be the Grand Canyon
[1:35:28] or whatever it be out
[1:35:30] here and and you're traveling along
[1:35:33] there's so much and so what do you do
[1:35:35] you take
[1:35:36] photographs and then when you go home
[1:35:39] all you see things you done forgot about
[1:35:42] and it brings that that that visit it
[1:35:45] brings that little holiday back and you
[1:35:47] can live it again through the pictures
[1:35:50] not live it in life but oh yeah I forgot
[1:35:52] about that oh look at here you know I
[1:35:55] didn't even notice that was behind me
[1:35:57] when you took that picture you know so
[1:36:00] our pictures this morning is is going to
[1:36:02] put on a a CD or a
[1:36:05] DVD so we can go back so I just want you
[1:36:08] to relax this morning and listen I'm
[1:36:11] going to move probably rather fast a lot
[1:36:14] of information but don't let it
[1:36:16] overwhelm you I just want you to kind of
[1:36:18] look at the scenery some things may be
[1:36:21] thought-provoking to you so I want you
[1:36:23] to have your thinking caps on and I I
[1:36:27] really want the Lord to give me wisdom
[1:36:29] because I don't want to worry you out
[1:36:31] and as I say ride this horse into the
[1:36:34] ground but but we do have something on
[1:36:36] our heart that I feel that God has sent
[1:36:38] us here to to share with you and and I
[1:36:41] don't want to be limited by time but I
[1:36:43] don't want to take advantage of your
[1:36:46] hospitality so we we want to have we're
[1:36:49] still in these bodies amen and and I
[1:36:52] know some sometimes how tired I get my
[1:36:55] wife gets and you get
[1:36:57] uncomfortable and but but we do want to
[1:37:00] share something with you this morning
[1:37:02] and and if and if you know I might have
[1:37:05] an objective in my mind and God might
[1:37:07] have something different in his mind and
[1:37:10] I don't want to control his mind I want
[1:37:12] him to control my mind amen he said when
[1:37:15] we pray we need to pray Lord change my
[1:37:18] will to match your will amen but many
[1:37:22] times we're trying to pray to get get
[1:37:23] God to think like we think or his will
[1:37:25] to be with our will but but we need to
[1:37:28] be in a fluid place that he can take our
[1:37:31] will to bring it subject to his will and
[1:37:34] that's what we want and and and praying
[1:37:37] for that is like praying for
[1:37:40] patience because we know when you pray
[1:37:43] for patience here comes the tribulation
[1:37:45] right amen and and when you pray for
[1:37:49] humility here comes the crushing because
[1:37:52] humility comes through crushing and
[1:37:54] trials and he doesn't just hand it out
[1:37:57] and make you polite and
[1:38:00] timid but humility has
[1:38:03] power prise the Lord humility has
[1:38:06] boldness but humility doesn't speak of
[1:38:10] itself it doesn't do for
[1:38:14] itself I remember years and years ago I
[1:38:17] heard I had was getting some tapes from
[1:38:19] Brother Perry green he said humility is
[1:38:22] to have the power to do something and
[1:38:24] don't do it he had the power to call a
[1:38:26] legion of angels but he didn't do it
[1:38:29] amen Paul had the power to cast that
[1:38:31] demon out of that girl but he didn't do
[1:38:34] it so humility is waiting on God and
[1:38:37] being in the will of God and your will
[1:38:40] being subject to his will amen and to me
[1:38:43] that's Rapture in faith prise he said
[1:38:45] the bride will have the word and she'll
[1:38:48] know what he wants done with that
[1:38:50] word and she won't move unless she has
[1:38:52] thus sayith Lord amen so that's what we
[1:38:56] want to look at a little bit this
[1:38:57] morning so I'm going to take this
[1:38:59] parable of the foolish virgin and the
[1:39:01] wise and we know it by heart but just to
[1:39:04] take a platform and we're going to start
[1:39:06] from here in Matthew chapter
[1:39:10] 25 and we'll just
[1:39:12] read verses 1 through1 13 if we can then
[1:39:16] shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened
[1:39:18] on the 10 virgins which took their lamps
[1:39:21] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[1:39:24] five of them were wise and five were
[1:39:26] foolish they that were foolish took
[1:39:28] their lamps and and took no oil with
[1:39:32] them but the wise took oil in their
[1:39:35] vessels with their lamps while a
[1:39:38] bridegroom carried they slumbered and
[1:39:40] slept and at midnight there was a cry
[1:39:43] made Behold a bridegroom cometh go ye
[1:39:46] out to meet
[1:39:48] him then all those virgins arose and
[1:39:51] trimmed their lamps and the foolish said
[1:39:54] onto the wise give us on give us of your
[1:39:58] oil for our lamps are gone out but the
[1:40:01] wise answered saying not so lest there
[1:40:04] be not enough for us and you but go ye
[1:40:08] rather to them that sell and buy for
[1:40:11] yourselves and while they went to buy
[1:40:14] the bridegroom came and they that were
[1:40:17] ready went in with him to the
[1:40:20] marriage and the and the door was was
[1:40:24] shut afterward came also other virgins
[1:40:27] saying Lord Lord open to
[1:40:30] us but he answered and said verily I say
[1:40:34] unto you I know you
[1:40:37] not watch therefore for you know neither
[1:40:40] the day nor the hour wherein the son of
[1:40:45] man cometh amen may we bear our heads
[1:40:48] Heavenly
[1:40:50] Father we know that that in our our
[1:40:53] Bibles it says the
[1:40:56] parable of the 10
[1:40:59] virgins but we look at it
[1:41:03] Lord not just as a parable but a
[1:41:07] prophecy
[1:41:09] amen and we are living in the day of
[1:41:11] this
[1:41:13] prophecy and Lord that when any man
[1:41:16] lived in the day of the prophetical
[1:41:19] word you always
[1:41:22] came and Open the Eyes of the
[1:41:25] understanding of your elect for that day
[1:41:27] to understand that
[1:41:30] prophecy and father we we have a
[1:41:33] knowledge but we want it quickened to us
[1:41:36] Lord that it becomes
[1:41:39] reality for where there is
[1:41:41] darkness and prophecy
[1:41:44] comes then
[1:41:47] prophecy is a light that shines in
[1:41:50] darkness to reveal that what is hidden
[1:41:54] by ignorance of man and by the lack of
[1:41:57] the wisdom of God in man but when
[1:42:00] prophecy comes and prophecy is revealed
[1:42:05] to the people yes it becomes an
[1:42:08] illumination that lightens up
[1:42:11] that which was not seen amen so father
[1:42:15] may you
[1:42:17] come for without you we can do nothing
[1:42:21] amen we're the Vine
[1:42:23] you're the vine we're the
[1:42:26] branches and without you we can do
[1:42:30] nothing may you come yes as you've
[1:42:34] already presented yourself Lord your
[1:42:37] your presence Lord through song and
[1:42:40] worship and and Lord even
[1:42:45] prophetically in the dedication of this
[1:42:47] child praise the Lord
[1:42:50] amen a bride
[1:42:53] for we're living in a bright age yes
[1:42:56] amen praise the
[1:42:59] Lord and Lord you dedicated a Manchild
[1:43:03] Jesus
[1:43:05] Christ now we have the
[1:43:09] dedication of a child of woman the bride
[1:43:12] of Christ amen so Lord may it be
[1:43:15] prophetical this morning yes Jesus as we
[1:43:18] speak upon your
[1:43:20] word May the light of Illumination come
[1:43:23] come upon each and every one of us and
[1:43:26] may you lead us to Higher Ground and
[1:43:29] deeper depths amen may you grant to me
[1:43:31] the wisdom Lord we're still creatures of
[1:43:35] time may we not be bound by
[1:43:39] time but may you grant to me Lord the
[1:43:42] wisdom yes Jesus Lord with your people
[1:43:46] prise for Lord I'd rather speak four
[1:43:48] words that they would
[1:43:50] understand than to speak 10 thousand
[1:43:53] Lord that their mind could not
[1:43:57] comprehend so father help us this
[1:44:00] morning bring us the Mana in due season
[1:44:03] for this day amen and we ask it in the
[1:44:06] precious name of thy son Hallelujah
[1:44:09] Jesus Christ amen amen you may be
[1:44:13] seated there's a lot we can say about
[1:44:16] this Parable every
[1:44:19] scripture uh sometimes you know you can
[1:44:23] uh with a minister or with me it
[1:44:27] sometimes you know you can you can
[1:44:29] already have your your what you want to
[1:44:31] minister on and you got your notes and
[1:44:34] and you have your scripture and and I've
[1:44:37] had this happen it's not all the time
[1:44:39] that happens but you'll start reading a
[1:44:41] scripture and and my thing just start
[1:44:44] busting open while you're reading that
[1:44:46] and almost makes you want to stop and
[1:44:49] and say well I never saw that before and
[1:44:52] it wouldn't be under that anointing or
[1:44:54] that inspiration and it just opens up
[1:44:56] just like a we were talking the other
[1:44:58] night about a Roman candle and well or a
[1:45:02] Chinese candle I guess but to us over in
[1:45:06] America it's the Roman Candle you know
[1:45:08] oh Rome and and uh and their great light
[1:45:11] that they put out which is a false light
[1:45:13] but but anyway it just breaks open and
[1:45:17] and I've seen you know I've read some
[1:45:19] places where brother Brown said okay
[1:45:21] well I just don't really have any
[1:45:23] anything this morning let's just uh oh
[1:45:25] let's just read right here and we'll
[1:45:27] just see what happens oh if that
[1:45:29] happened to me I'd be up here i' I'd
[1:45:31] probably have to take something for an
[1:45:32] uler or something you know I'd be a
[1:45:34] nervous
[1:45:35] wreck but he he just he he was just uh
[1:45:39] we're all built different you know and
[1:45:42] Pentecost they call that the anointing
[1:45:44] you know if if they see you come out
[1:45:46] with notes like this they'd say Church
[1:45:49] intellectual you know God just deals by
[1:45:52] inspiration
[1:45:53] and and that's true I've seen men just
[1:45:56] read their notes but that's the way God
[1:45:59] uses them he sits under the inspiration
[1:46:02] and he writes it he comes with that same
[1:46:04] inspiration and reads it if he wants to
[1:46:06] sit and preach or stand and preach or if
[1:46:09] he just wants to stand there and read it
[1:46:11] or if he runs all over the place uh each
[1:46:14] man is different in his in his ministry
[1:46:18] but the thing we want to watch is what
[1:46:20] does he
[1:46:21] say not not how he says it but what he
[1:46:24] says amen not how you feel when he says
[1:46:27] it but what he says it's got to be
[1:46:30] according to the word of God or I don't
[1:46:33] care how it comes or how it makes you
[1:46:35] feel if it's not according to the word
[1:46:38] it doesn't come from God that's right
[1:46:41] and so that's that's where we want to be
[1:46:44] this morning but we don't want to be
[1:46:46] Church of Ephesus you know uh they could
[1:46:49] judge that word they knew if people were
[1:46:51] preaching the word they knew if they was
[1:46:53] Apostles but they done drifted from the
[1:46:56] from the warmth and the love and the
[1:46:59] manifestation of the Holy
[1:47:01] Ghost and and they became
[1:47:04] deceived amen not by the
[1:47:07] intellect but they had walked away from
[1:47:09] Christ like Mary and Joseph and didn't
[1:47:11] even realize they left him behind so we
[1:47:15] don't want to leave him behind and we
[1:47:17] don't want to reject anything that he
[1:47:19] has for us so in this parable
[1:47:25] what we're what we're noticing
[1:47:28] here uh that after the Rapture takes
[1:47:32] place now we know that this is a a
[1:47:35] parable that includes the church ages
[1:47:37] because we see that there is a there is
[1:47:41] a uh calling forth of these
[1:47:44] virgins like it was with uh
[1:47:48] Esther that the King was looking for a
[1:47:52] wife so they went all over the the
[1:47:56] kingdom and there was he wanted a woman
[1:47:59] he didn't want a man that was before
[1:48:01] this day you
[1:48:03] know he he was he was he was a he was
[1:48:06] will say not that he was normal because
[1:48:10] today normal is not what normal was back
[1:48:12] there then because it's so perverted but
[1:48:15] anyway they so then they went out to
[1:48:18] find a a wife a woman for him and they
[1:48:22] searched all all over but now uh out of
[1:48:25] those women they had to find women that
[1:48:27] were undefiled and they had to find
[1:48:30] virgins amen so then out of the
[1:48:32] multitude of the women that there was a
[1:48:35] calling for
[1:48:37] virgins and so they called The Virgins
[1:48:39] out and so now we had two groups those
[1:48:42] that were called and those that weren't
[1:48:44] called because those that were called
[1:48:46] were
[1:48:47] virgins but in there there had to be a
[1:48:49] woman that would be selected from that
[1:48:52] group
[1:48:53] that would be wife to the
[1:48:56] king and we know that that was Esther so
[1:48:58] she was elevated from the
[1:49:01] women in the in the group with the
[1:49:03] virgins and then she was elevated from
[1:49:06] that to be wife to the king yes and so
[1:49:10] here we have the the foolish virgins
[1:49:14] which were called by the gospel and they
[1:49:17] all came
[1:49:18] out and and now they were preparing uh
[1:49:23] for that wedding and if you know the old
[1:49:25] traditions of that day and I'm sure that
[1:49:27] it's been ministered here that when that
[1:49:30] girl was was consecrated or dedicated
[1:49:33] when that vow was taken she went home he
[1:49:35] went to build a little Hut for the
[1:49:37] honeymoon and she went home and started
[1:49:39] preparing her things and in that
[1:49:41] Preparatory time she had this lamp and
[1:49:44] she would sit that lamp which was an oil
[1:49:46] lamp in those days up in the window and
[1:49:50] when the bridegroom came back and it was
[1:49:53] usually at midnight according to the
[1:49:55] Eastern custom at that day that uh he
[1:49:59] would come and that lamp would be
[1:50:02] lit now if that lamp went
[1:50:05] out then that then that was
[1:50:08] disan he he didn't take her because that
[1:50:12] lamp represented her love and her
[1:50:16] Readiness and her expectation of the
[1:50:20] coming of that bridegroom Hallelujah her
[1:50:22] all her whole life that was connected to
[1:50:26] the bridegroom was represented in that
[1:50:30] lamp because when he came and that lamp
[1:50:33] wasn't lit it disen knowed that
[1:50:36] engagement that was it
[1:50:38] amen so that's what this lamp represents
[1:50:42] and so down through the church ages
[1:50:44] there was a calling forth of a bride but
[1:50:47] we also had the foolish and the
[1:50:50] wise and and the way that some people
[1:50:53] preach the foolish virgin they they take
[1:50:55] it just like the word foolish and just
[1:50:58] make them stupid dumb and and just not
[1:51:00] worth anything but but remember they
[1:51:03] were
[1:51:03] virgins amen and a and a virgin
[1:51:07] represents a woman that's
[1:51:10] undefiled and and and if you've ever
[1:51:12] read that that book that's a sequel to
[1:51:15] the to the prince of the House of David
[1:51:18] the the uh the Throne of David the way
[1:51:22] that that author brings forth Jonathan
[1:51:24] you begin to realize that
[1:51:27] Jonathan was just as a spiritual man and
[1:51:30] just the same a man as David was he
[1:51:33] loved God he loved his father he was
[1:51:37] loyal to his father and he loved
[1:51:40] David and he accepted the Throne of
[1:51:43] David that his father couldn't do his
[1:51:45] father could not
[1:51:47] accept the choice of God for David to be
[1:51:50] king but Jonathan submitted himself to
[1:51:54] the kingship of David before David ever
[1:51:56] came to his throne amen he said when you
[1:51:59] come to your
[1:52:00] throne remember my
[1:52:02] children so he was able to submit
[1:52:05] himself to his father but he was also
[1:52:08] able to submit himself to the word of
[1:52:10] God to God's will in his own life he was
[1:52:14] actually the heir parent from the way
[1:52:17] man looked at things Saul and then his
[1:52:19] son would be the prince would be the
[1:52:21] next king
[1:52:23] but because of
[1:52:25] Saul Jonathan lost that
[1:52:29] kingship he didn't do anything wrong it
[1:52:32] was his daddy amen it wasn't that you
[1:52:35] did anything wrong it was
[1:52:37] Adam but when Adam fell amen from his
[1:52:41] throne all of his children fell that's
[1:52:44] right and Jonathan didn't do anything
[1:52:47] bad he was a good man he had Faith he
[1:52:49] believed God right he was able to
[1:52:53] to protect
[1:52:55] David and he was able to be loyal to his
[1:52:59] daddy he was able to stand between David
[1:53:03] and his
[1:53:04] daddy and yet he was able to stand with
[1:53:07] his daddy and battle and die with
[1:53:09] him he was a man of Great
[1:53:13] Character and when the enemy had to had
[1:53:16] the armies of Israel at Bay he went out
[1:53:19] with his armor Bearer he said
[1:53:24] he said if God if that man hollers at us
[1:53:26] and says come up here we'll know that
[1:53:29] that's the voice of God speaking through
[1:53:31] that man and we're going to go up
[1:53:34] there but if he doesn't then we know
[1:53:36] that God ain't with us and we're going
[1:53:38] to stay right down here about that time
[1:53:41] that man hey come up here we'll show you
[1:53:44] a thing or two he says that's it that's
[1:53:47] the voice of God Amen and he put himself
[1:53:51] into an unwi position militarily because
[1:53:54] in order to crawl up there they had to
[1:53:57] they had to crawl hands and feet up
[1:54:00] there and you know that's a bad position
[1:54:02] to be when there's a man standing up
[1:54:04] there with a sword waiting on you it's
[1:54:06] hard to defend yourself when you're
[1:54:08] working your way but by faith he went up
[1:54:12] there and conquered the
[1:54:16] enemy Hallelujah but the problem
[1:54:21] was that he was of The Tribe of
[1:54:25] Benjamin and The Tribe of Benjamin was
[1:54:28] not given the kingship it was a tribe of
[1:54:31] Judah amen so Jonathan wasn't in the
[1:54:35] election but David
[1:54:38] was so the foolish was not in the
[1:54:42] election
[1:54:44] yes but you know Noah preached and he
[1:54:47] was a preacher of
[1:54:49] righteousness he was not a defiled man
[1:54:52] and he walked with
[1:54:54] God and yet he was the type of the
[1:54:57] foolish virgin so that's one thing to
[1:54:59] keep in mind that this foolish virgin
[1:55:02] she's
[1:55:04] 100% as far as what God releases to her
[1:55:07] in
[1:55:08] Revelation but she never comes up to the
[1:55:11] place that the bride the very elect is
[1:55:14] she had oil but she didn't have enough
[1:55:16] oil to take her
[1:55:17] through but the bride the the true bride
[1:55:21] the the five
[1:55:23] virgins that were wise they had oil with
[1:55:26] them and took them all the way in to
[1:55:28] what we know as the Rapture amen at
[1:55:31] midnight The Voice goes out the Lord
[1:55:33] shall descend with a shout and brother
[1:55:36] Brown said the the bridegroom call comes
[1:55:39] right through the son of man
[1:55:41] Ministry so we find that there's even
[1:55:44] foolish virgin that responds to the
[1:55:46] bridegroom
[1:55:48] call but she just does not have the
[1:55:51] inspiration
[1:55:52] the light to take her all the way into
[1:55:55] the
[1:55:56] Rapture so she's Justified she's
[1:55:59] Sanctified but she doesn't have
[1:56:02] rapturing faith
[1:56:05] amen and when she comes up to that door
[1:56:09] the bride has already gone into the
[1:56:11] Rapture but now there's a voice that
[1:56:14] speaks to her and says it's too
[1:56:19] late now to me that expresses a message
[1:56:23] that's going to be spoken to that
[1:56:25] foolish
[1:56:27] virgin because that foolish virgin
[1:56:31] according to the prophet according to
[1:56:33] the
[1:56:34] seals the six
[1:56:36] seal she has to give her life during
[1:56:39] that tribulation period yes but the
[1:56:42] scripture says let the righteous remain
[1:56:45] righteous the wicked remain Wicked the
[1:56:49] ungodly
[1:56:50] Etc so we know that she is
[1:56:53] righteous but she did not have the
[1:56:57] Revelation to take her
[1:56:59] in to that Rapture amen so then she has
[1:57:03] to give her life during that tribulation
[1:57:07] period and come up at the white Throne
[1:57:10] judgment and be granted eternal
[1:57:13] life because she doesn't sit with him
[1:57:16] during that Millennial Reign
[1:57:19] amen so then she gives her life
[1:57:23] now my thought is
[1:57:24] this it's not going to be somebody
[1:57:27] coming up and just holding a gun and
[1:57:28] saying you're going to have to deny
[1:57:31] Christ I believe she's going to have to
[1:57:33] recognize she's in the tribulation
[1:57:36] period yes she's going to have to know
[1:57:40] and recognize and have the discernment
[1:57:42] to know the the Beast the the name the
[1:57:45] number the mark of the beast because
[1:57:48] she's going to have to know the
[1:57:50] Antichrist and it's spirit and that
[1:57:53] she's in that tribulation period because
[1:57:56] to give her life when I look at at at
[1:57:58] Hebrews 11 they all gave their life and
[1:58:02] died in faith so for her to give her
[1:58:05] life her being the Virgin she'll give
[1:58:08] her life for the word in other words
[1:58:11] she'll have to give her life dying in
[1:58:13] faith not just ignorance amen and so
[1:58:17] what I'm trying to do this morning is to
[1:58:20] tie the ministry of Enoch with the
[1:58:22] ministry of Noah and showing you that
[1:58:25] there's a link between
[1:58:29] that so then let's go let's go to the
[1:58:32] Book of Genesis if we
[1:58:34] will and I want to try to take this and
[1:58:37] like I said maybe we won't get get
[1:58:39] through with it it's important to me but
[1:58:41] it may not be important to God and and
[1:58:45] and so then I just don't want to wear
[1:58:46] you out and I'm just going to try to
[1:58:49] keep track of this in Genesis
[1:58:54] and uh I want to start in chapter
[1:58:57] 6
[1:58:58] and and maybe uh just go to to verse 8
[1:59:02] of Genesis chapter
[1:59:05] 6 but Noah found Grace in the eyes of
[1:59:09] the
[1:59:10] Lord and these are the
[1:59:13] generations of
[1:59:15] Noah Noah was a just man amen now I want
[1:59:19] you to notice that he was a just man
[1:59:23] speaks of
[1:59:25] justification that doesn't mean that he
[1:59:27] was a man that was out here and he he
[1:59:30] was a he he he he was fair with
[1:59:34] everybody but I believe it speaks of he
[1:59:36] was a just man because it said job was a
[1:59:39] just man upright before God perfect now
[1:59:43] we find this same description here of
[1:59:46] Noah and remember that job was a prophet
[1:59:50] and he received his rightous nness
[1:59:53] through a revelation that God had given
[1:59:55] him it was not the sacrifice it was the
[1:59:58] Revelation the sacrifice only testified
[2:00:01] of the revelation God gave him so his
[2:00:04] sacrifice like Abel testified of his
[2:00:07] righteousness so the first thing we see
[2:00:10] here Noah was a just man and perfect in
[2:00:14] his generation now you take that and try
[2:00:16] that with what God said about
[2:00:19] job and Noah walked with
[2:00:24] God so these are the only two people in
[2:00:27] the Old Testament that the Bible said
[2:00:29] that they walked with God Enoch and Noah
[2:00:32] Noah type of the
[2:00:34] foolish and walked with God not some
[2:00:38] trash
[2:00:39] people not some people that are just
[2:00:42] dirty and all stupid foolish
[2:00:45] virgin Noah walked with God and Enoch
[2:00:48] walked with God
[2:00:50] Amen
[2:00:55] so keep that in your mind when you think
[2:00:57] a foolish
[2:00:59] virgin but you cannot decide to be a
[2:01:02] foolish
[2:01:04] virgin you cannot decide to be
[2:01:07] bride you cannot decide to be
[2:01:10] saved that lays within the election of
[2:01:14] God that foolish virgin is 100% all out
[2:01:17] she's living all the word that she
[2:01:20] knows she is not somebody that comes in
[2:01:22] the message and says well I don't want
[2:01:24] to live like that but I I'll believe
[2:01:26] brother brandom and I'll stay in the
[2:01:28] message I'll just be foolish virgin
[2:01:30] foolish virgin would decide to be bride
[2:01:33] she would not decide to be
[2:01:37] foolish amen she would decide to be
[2:01:40] chosen not just one of the virgins that
[2:01:43] wasn't chosen that's right because in
[2:01:45] her heart she wants to be
[2:01:48] bride but she just wasn't
[2:01:50] predestinated
[2:01:53] but the wise virgin was
[2:01:57] predestinated and she wants to be the
[2:01:59] wife of that bridegroom amen she doesn't
[2:02:02] want to go back into the group that's
[2:02:04] just going to be out here in the uh
[2:02:06] amongst the other women that never come
[2:02:09] into association with the King she wants
[2:02:12] to be she wants to be his
[2:02:15] wife she just doesn't want to live down
[2:02:18] there in the castle with him and not
[2:02:19] have nothing to do with him she wants to
[2:02:22] be married to him and bear children
[2:02:24] fruit onto that
[2:02:28] marriage amen so true bride could never
[2:02:32] say I just want to be
[2:02:36] foolish because that's contrary to to
[2:02:40] the bride
[2:02:45] Revelation
[2:02:49] amen Noah walked with God
[2:02:52] God the Lord and Noah begat Three
[2:02:56] Sons Shem ham and
[2:02:59] japheth now here's something that I
[2:03:02] found to be
[2:03:07] interesting that if I go back to Genesis
[2:03:10] 5 and verse
[2:03:13] 6 and Seth lived a 100 years and five
[2:03:16] years and begat
[2:03:18] enus and in verse n
[2:03:22] enus lived 90 years and begat
[2:03:26] Cain verse 12 and Canaan lived 70 years
[2:03:31] and begat
[2:03:34] Mahalia verse 15 and mahale lived 60
[2:03:38] and5 years and begat
[2:03:41] Jared and then Verse 18 and Jared lived
[2:03:45] 160 and two years and begat
[2:03:48] Enoch verse 21 and Enoch Liv Liv 60 and5
[2:03:52] years and begat
[2:03:54] methusa verse
[2:03:56] 25 and Methuselah
[2:03:59] lived 80 and7 years and begat
[2:04:02] lmch verse
[2:04:04] 28 and lmch lived 180 years 80 and two
[2:04:09] years and begat begat a son and he
[2:04:13] called his name
[2:04:16] Noah now verse
[2:04:18] 32 and Noah was 500 years old and Noah
[2:04:22] begat sham Hamond
[2:04:25] japheth that's a little different isn't
[2:04:28] it they were
[2:04:32] triplets do you ever see that I never
[2:04:35] saw
[2:04:37] that he was 500 years
[2:04:40] old and he had he had three
[2:04:45] sons he was 500 years old and he begat
[2:04:47] Shem ham and
[2:04:49] japheth it didn't say that
[2:04:52] that he had Shem and then he had Sons
[2:04:54] and
[2:04:56] Daughters it says he was 500 years old
[2:04:59] when he had these three
[2:05:01] boys they were
[2:05:03] triplets
[2:05:05] am and you know the Bible said we're all
[2:05:09] of One blood and brother Brown said the
[2:05:12] whole world is populated through these
[2:05:14] three sons they represented the the Jews
[2:05:16] Samaritans and
[2:05:18] Gentiles and they were triplets
[2:05:22] no room for hybridization
[2:05:28] there that's interesting isn't it
[2:05:32] amen it's something that you can go back
[2:05:35] and look at and Noah begat three sons
[2:05:38] shemam and
[2:05:39] japheth and the Earth was and the Earth
[2:05:43] also was corrupted before
[2:05:45] God and the Earth was filled with
[2:05:48] violence and God looked upon the Earth
[2:05:51] and behold it was corrupt for All Flesh
[2:05:55] had corrupted his way upon the
[2:05:58] Earth and God said unto
[2:06:02] Noah the end of All Flesh has come
[2:06:05] before me for the Earth is filled with
[2:06:07] violence through them and behold I will
[2:06:11] destroy them with the
[2:06:14] Earth make an ark of gopherwood room
[2:06:19] shall thou make within make in the Ark
[2:06:22] and shall pitch it within and without
[2:06:24] with
[2:06:26] pitch so as I was reading this I noticed
[2:06:29] that when I was reading about Enoch it
[2:06:31] said that Enoch was 65 years old and he
[2:06:34] had Methuselah and after that he had
[2:06:36] methusa he walked with God so we seen
[2:06:39] there was a period of time that he
[2:06:41] didn't walk with God and we went back
[2:06:43] and looked and said there had to be a
[2:06:45] Reconciliation and so we see that that
[2:06:48] methusa is a is a Time marker between
[2:06:50] when he didn't walk with God and when he
[2:06:52] did walk with God am and the Bible made
[2:06:54] it explicit because it said after he had
[2:06:57] methus Le walked with God so then we
[2:07:00] begin to look at the Revelation that God
[2:07:02] had and and righteousness through faith
[2:07:05] and begin to tie those together that God
[2:07:07] had come to him his thirst for God what
[2:07:10] he had received through Adam's Ministry
[2:07:13] the which was the word of God to him
[2:07:15] testimony at that time and then God
[2:07:17] quickened that he began to seek God and
[2:07:20] God met him and he revealed to him what
[2:07:22] he'd been looking at because under the
[2:07:25] ministry you know he listened to what
[2:07:27] Adam was saying and then through that
[2:07:29] Revelation that he received from Adam
[2:07:31] when he walked in the garden he was
[2:07:32] looking at the church and the condition
[2:07:34] and his eyes was being open now to the
[2:07:37] ungodliness and to the backsliding and
[2:07:40] in him was a fire to to and perhaps he
[2:07:43] had even the same experience that uh
[2:07:45] Adam did when he began to talk about
[2:07:47] what was revealed to him in the message
[2:07:49] of Adam they said oh yeah yeah yeah
[2:07:52] because you see he was the seventh
[2:07:54] Church age and that was the lukewarm
[2:07:55] Church age so it identified the the
[2:08:00] characteristic of the church and yet
[2:08:02] we're not saying that these firstborn
[2:08:05] was lost but they represented the True
[2:08:07] Vine so when you begin to study the when
[2:08:10] the flood came every one of these
[2:08:13] firstborn had died off and methusa was
[2:08:16] the last one to die Before the Flood
[2:08:18] came so none of these first Bo Di in the
[2:08:21] judgments of God in the
[2:08:23] flood they were taken up before the
[2:08:26] judgments or taken out before the
[2:08:28] Judgment come amen but each one of them
[2:08:32] after they had CH after they had a son
[2:08:35] then they had sons and daughters so
[2:08:37] there was many children in that
[2:08:40] lineage and I believe that it was in
[2:08:42] those Sons not the
[2:08:44] firstborn not the original vine it was
[2:08:47] in there that man be the sons of God
[2:08:50] began to look upon upon the daughters of
[2:08:54] men amen so it was in these children
[2:08:58] that were begotten by these men that we
[2:09:00] see the hybridization
[2:09:04] beginning but in this first born which
[2:09:06] is
[2:09:08] representation they were taken out
[2:09:10] before the Judgment come not one of them
[2:09:13] died in the flood they all died before
[2:09:16] that flood
[2:09:18] come so then when I began to read about
[2:09:21] Noah I notice that it said and Noah
[2:09:25] found Grace in the eyes of
[2:09:27] God these are the generations of Noah
[2:09:31] Noah was a just man and perfect in his
[2:09:36] generation and these words refer to
[2:09:41] righteousness
[2:09:43] justification because then it goes on
[2:09:45] and ties in with that and says and he
[2:09:47] walked with God he could not walk with
[2:09:50] God
[2:09:51] without being reconciled to God he had
[2:09:55] to have word supplied to him by God in
[2:10:00] order to have faith that God would
[2:10:02] Inspire him to that word amen and then
[2:10:06] as I read down and I got down here to
[2:10:09] verse 13 and it says and God
[2:10:12] said unto Noah I said now according to
[2:10:17] the scripture and the way it's
[2:10:20] written that God was walking with Noah
[2:10:24] before he spoke to
[2:10:25] him where did that righteousness come
[2:10:29] from and that's why we were looking at
[2:10:32] lot where does his righteousness come
[2:10:34] from we looked at Matthew 10 that he
[2:10:37] that receives a prophet in the name of a
[2:10:39] prophet receives a prophet's reward what
[2:10:42] is it
[2:10:44] righteousness by being inspired to the
[2:10:47] message of the prophet and becomes
[2:10:50] righteous before God by the inspiration
[2:10:53] on the word of the Prophet bringing
[2:10:57] Faith so now if I if I look here at
[2:11:01] Noah I want to show you or I won't be
[2:11:05] able to show you but if I uh if I don't
[2:11:08] get excited here and and do something
[2:11:10] wrong on this little
[2:11:13] thing you know I can I can be at the
[2:11:15] house doing just fine I get up here and
[2:11:17] this thing just does not want to mind me
[2:11:20] I got and then I get
[2:11:24] nervous let me give you a little bit of
[2:11:27] timeline and we're not we're just going
[2:11:28] to go from Enoch to Noah and and some of
[2:11:32] you probably already studied these
[2:11:33] things but i' never really connected
[2:11:36] these things before and I don't have
[2:11:38] charts like some people do so I just had
[2:11:40] to do this with my own figuring but
[2:11:43] Enoch was 65 years old when he had
[2:11:48] methusa and then it was 300 years years
[2:11:51] before he was
[2:11:53] translated so then
[2:11:55] methusa actually sat under his daddy's
[2:11:59] Ministry for that 300
[2:12:03] years so he sat under the administration
[2:12:07] of Enoch the building of the
[2:12:11] pyramid because it was after that that
[2:12:15] he had Methuselah that he walked with
[2:12:17] God so I believe it was in that period
[2:12:20] of time that the Revelation came of the
[2:12:22] pyramid when he was walking with
[2:12:24] God so he witnessed the building of the
[2:12:27] pyramid he witnessed he witnessed the
[2:12:30] the prophetical message that went out
[2:12:33] listened to it for 300 years sat in
[2:12:35] church with his
[2:12:38] daddy and then also he was a sign child
[2:12:42] and he knew that his name according to
[2:12:44] his daddy's preaching had something to
[2:12:47] do with the coming judgments that his
[2:12:49] daddy was preaching about yes
[2:12:52] and then he had a son and his son's name
[2:12:54] was
[2:12:55] lmch and and M methusa was7 years old
[2:13:01] when he had
[2:13:02] limi and so then limi he lived 113 years
[2:13:08] under the administration of Enoch before
[2:13:10] he was
[2:13:13] translated so now we got methusa he sits
[2:13:16] 300 years under that that
[2:13:19] Ministry and now we've got limi his son
[2:13:24] that sits 113 years under that
[2:13:29] Ministry and these are
[2:13:32] believers but yet we find that in this
[2:13:36] even though the methusa is a sign child
[2:13:38] and Lim also is the grandchild of Enoch
[2:13:43] there's a lack of inspiration here
[2:13:45] because that they don't have the same
[2:13:49] relationship that Noah has with God so
[2:13:52] they believe the
[2:13:54] message but it's not inspired to
[2:13:58] them it's not inspired to them even
[2:14:02] though they believe it they said under
[2:14:05] that Ministry I believe what my daddy
[2:14:09] taught but methusa wasn't raptured and
[2:14:12] methusa died before the flood and
[2:14:15] methusa never walked with God even
[2:14:17] though that he was Enoch's son
[2:14:20] right
[2:14:21] but he believed that
[2:14:23] message and he preached the same message
[2:14:25] that his daddy
[2:14:27] preached amen he preached it to his son
[2:14:31] and to those that listen to him we know
[2:14:33] by limi that he had listened to Adam and
[2:14:36] he knew the ground was cursed and we
[2:14:39] knew that he was prophetical limi was
[2:14:42] because he he prophesied of the of the
[2:14:45] ministry of his son Noah by expressing
[2:14:48] that he he would be a rest to the people
[2:14:51] and connecting it to the labor with the
[2:14:53] cursing of the earth and we find that
[2:14:56] when Noah walked out of the Ark then God
[2:14:59] said I won't curse the Earth anymore so
[2:15:01] he had a prophetical Ministry that he
[2:15:03] could see that his son was going to have
[2:15:06] a Ministry for the people to bring rest
[2:15:09] but he didn't know exactly what it was
[2:15:11] he just had that prophecy amen now 69
[2:15:16] years after Enoch is is taken up then we
[2:15:21] find that Noah is
[2:15:23] born so that Noah his daddy is
[2:15:27] limi and limic said 113 years under that
[2:15:32] under that
[2:15:34] message and we know that any daddy
[2:15:37] that's spiritual and believes in God
[2:15:39] he's going to raise his child in the
[2:15:41] admonition of God Amen that scripture is
[2:15:43] just not for today it goes all the way
[2:15:46] back to the beginning any Scripture is
[2:15:48] the same yesterday today and forever God
[2:15:51] don't have different Revelations and
[2:15:53] different standards but he does have
[2:15:55] different elevations of
[2:15:58] Revelation so Lim methusa bringing his
[2:16:02] child up and they actually sat together
[2:16:04] in church and listened to Lim's Grandpa
[2:16:08] and and meth and and Methuselah's
[2:16:11] Daddy and they were Believers because
[2:16:13] they were firstborn firstborn lineage
[2:16:17] amen they weren't
[2:16:19] unbelievers and and so here comes Noah
[2:16:22] 69 years
[2:16:24] after after that Enoch is is taken
[2:16:28] out and now his
[2:16:31] grandpa and his
[2:16:34] daddy is still preaching the message
[2:16:36] that Enoch
[2:16:39] preached just like Adam was telling them
[2:16:41] about what happened in the
[2:16:44] garden and they Poss they all believed
[2:16:47] it but Enoch was inspired to that by God
[2:16:50] God used that word through a Adam to
[2:16:53] create a thirst in Enoch and that thirst
[2:16:57] brought him to the presence of God it
[2:17:00] was all God's doing Enoch was just the
[2:17:02] vessel that God was inspiring and
[2:17:05] motivating him by
[2:17:07] inspiration and not being born again but
[2:17:10] having representation of seed in
[2:17:13] him and now Noah finds Grace why does he
[2:17:16] find Grace Because he believes that
[2:17:19] message that his grandpa and his daddy's
[2:17:21] telling him and he's inspired to that
[2:17:25] message amen and he looks out and he
[2:17:28] sees the same thing that Enoch saw
[2:17:31] through the same eye that Enoch was
[2:17:33] looking through because he's inspired to
[2:17:36] the prophecy of
[2:17:39] Enoch and he looks out and he sees the
[2:17:42] ungodliness that's been accumulating
[2:17:44] since Cain walked out of the presence of
[2:17:47] God and now there's an intermingling of
[2:17:50] the churches
[2:17:52] and he sees the church here that
[2:17:54] believes but they're lacking a reality
[2:17:57] of
[2:17:58] God and yet he's inspired to that
[2:18:04] word and God imputes that to him for
[2:18:09] righteousness because he's just and he's
[2:18:12] perfect in his
[2:18:15] generation and he's walking with
[2:18:18] God and remember he's foolish virgin
[2:18:24] but he's even though he's inspired to
[2:18:26] that word he's not
[2:18:29] translated but now there's a
[2:18:32] problem he knows that there's a common
[2:18:36] delusion he knows the prophecy
[2:18:38] concerning methusa his
[2:18:41] name and he begins to look at him and he
[2:18:44] says now when he dies the delusion is
[2:18:49] coming right
[2:18:52] he didn't know how it was coming he just
[2:18:54] knew it was coming he believed that
[2:18:57] amen and it was imputed to him for
[2:18:59] righteousness and he was
[2:19:01] perfect and he was a just man and he
[2:19:04] walked with God but he needed
[2:19:08] something to take him through the
[2:19:11] Judgment he didn't know how to get
[2:19:13] through it he just now he knew according
[2:19:15] to the message of Enoch it was coming
[2:19:17] and he saw the condition of the church
[2:19:19] he looked out
[2:19:21] you know there's foolish virgin that
[2:19:22] looks out and sees the condition of the
[2:19:24] world they see the signs of the
[2:19:27] time but they don't have Rapture in
[2:19:30] faith and God didn't Rapture Noah but he
[2:19:34] came to him and he says you know what
[2:19:38] you believe is exactly thus sayith the
[2:19:40] Lord he confirms the message to him that
[2:19:45] it is thus saith the Lord he says I've
[2:19:48] looked out and judgment come up before
[2:19:52] me all of the violence and everything he
[2:19:54] actually is
[2:19:57] rehearsing what Noah has already
[2:19:59] believed and heard through the prophet
[2:20:01] Enoch through his son and through his
[2:20:04] grandson his grandpa and
[2:20:09] daddy but now he doesn't know what to do
[2:20:12] when methusa
[2:20:13] dies he just knows the judgment's coming
[2:20:16] so then God goes on and he says no
[2:20:21] build an
[2:20:22] ark and it doesn't take him in a
[2:20:25] Rapture but it takes him into that
[2:20:30] tribulation and in Noah day it took him
[2:20:32] through the
[2:20:33] tribulation and when the ground wasn't
[2:20:35] cursed
[2:20:37] anymore
[2:20:39] amen there's a second burning after the
[2:20:42] Millennium there's another burning yes
[2:20:45] sir
[2:20:47] sir and the ground was justified it
[2:20:49] wasn't it wasn't cursed
[2:20:52] anymore but the foolish that we're
[2:20:55] looking at they give their lives but
[2:20:57] they've got to be on the ark when they
[2:20:59] give their lives they've got to have
[2:21:03] faith and the voice spoke to the foolish
[2:21:07] and said it's too
[2:21:09] late I believe that there is a message
[2:21:11] to the
[2:21:12] foolish yes because not only did the
[2:21:16] fool not only did no receive the message
[2:21:18] of of Enoch but he didn't have Rapture
[2:21:21] in
[2:21:23] faith but God revealed to him how to go
[2:21:26] through that
[2:21:27] tribulation amen so they receive a
[2:21:30] message Noah received a message from God
[2:21:33] but I want you to notice over in in
[2:21:36] second
[2:21:37] Peter and again I'm going to try to stay
[2:21:40] inside of your
[2:21:41] Bibles we're going to Second Peter
[2:21:44] chapter
[2:21:46] two and we just look at verse verse five
[2:21:51] second Peter
[2:21:53] 2:5 and spared not the old
[2:21:56] world but saved Noah the eth
[2:22:00] person a preacher of
[2:22:04] righteousness amen it doesn't really
[2:22:06] call him a
[2:22:07] prophet because he didn't prophesy of
[2:22:10] the coming judgment he believed and by
[2:22:13] inspiration he preached the prophet's
[2:22:15] message which was God's voice to that
[2:22:19] generation
[2:22:21] so it was noted by Peter he calls him a
[2:22:24] preacher of righteousness he doesn't
[2:22:26] refer to it as a
[2:22:35] prophecy and then if I look at Hebrews
[2:22:37] 11 while we're on this end of the Bible
[2:22:40] here Hebrews 11 and verse 7 pertaining
[2:22:44] to
[2:22:48] Noah by faith
[2:22:52] by
[2:22:53] Revelation Noah being warned of God of
[2:22:57] things not seen as yet moved with
[2:23:01] fear and that word of course we know it
[2:23:04] means reverence it's not talking about
[2:23:06] being afraid it's talking about Godly
[2:23:10] reverence and godly
[2:23:13] fear of God's prophetical word in other
[2:23:16] words he believed it being warned of God
[2:23:20] had things not
[2:23:22] seen so we find that he had that
[2:23:26] faith that he looked to the
[2:23:31] Unseen he looked at that which had not
[2:23:33] come but yet God said was
[2:23:35] coming amen that there will come a
[2:23:38] resurrection and we shall be changed in
[2:23:41] a moment in a twinkling of an eye so
[2:23:44] Faith looks to the Unseen so he already
[2:23:47] saw the Judgment he already saw the rain
[2:23:50] coming
[2:23:51] down because looking to the
[2:23:53] Unseen he moved with fear and he built
[2:23:56] the ark which God told him to
[2:24:00] build and then notice here and
[2:24:04] became heir of the
[2:24:07] righteousness which is by
[2:24:10] faith so he was an heir of the
[2:24:15] righteousness which come by faith look
[2:24:18] at Romans 4 real quick uh Romans
[2:24:22] 4
[2:24:25] and in Romans 4 and I want you to look
[2:24:28] at verse 13 of Romans the 4th chapter
[2:24:32] for the promise that he should be heir
[2:24:34] of the
[2:24:35] world was not to Abraham or his seed
[2:24:39] through the
[2:24:40] law but through the righteousness of
[2:24:44] Faith so then the being heir of the
[2:24:48] world is not through OB obedience it's
[2:24:51] through election that we're the sons of
[2:24:54] God that we will inherit the whole world
[2:24:57] back to Adam in the
[2:25:01] beginning so then he becomes an
[2:25:04] heir of the
[2:25:07] righteousness which is of Faith amen he
[2:25:10] believed the message yes and he was a
[2:25:13] man of righteousness because he believed
[2:25:15] the prophet's message he received a
[2:25:17] prophet's
[2:25:18] reward amen
[2:25:21] and he was a preacher of righteousness
[2:25:23] and Heirs of
[2:25:27] righteousness at the resurrection when
[2:25:30] Christ identified himself amongst the
[2:25:34] disciples upwards of 500 people one
[2:25:39] time and there were many witnesses of
[2:25:42] that
[2:25:44] Resurrection there was witnesses that
[2:25:47] not only saw him but saw the resurrected
[2:25:49] SA
[2:25:50] sa because they spoke to people on the
[2:25:55] streets they were Witnesses of that
[2:26:01] Resurrection but they were not HS to
[2:26:04] that
[2:26:08] Resurrection you can sit in a courtroom
[2:26:11] and and somebody's passed away and
[2:26:13] they're reading out the will and they
[2:26:15] says okay uh I'll just use my own name
[2:26:19] Michael
[2:26:20] uh he's left you all of his bank
[2:26:24] accounts and his property in the car
[2:26:27] everybody oh look what he inherited but
[2:26:30] nobody else in the courtroom inherited
[2:26:31] only I benefited from that
[2:26:34] will because I was the
[2:26:37] heir of what was left to me in that will
[2:26:41] and we are heires of the righteousness
[2:26:44] which is of Faith so in righteousness we
[2:26:47] have an
[2:26:48] inheritance we're hirs through
[2:26:52] righteousness so 120 went to the upper
[2:26:56] room they were HS and they drew benefits
[2:27:00] from that
[2:27:02] Resurrection but the witnesses didn't
[2:27:04] draw any benefit they were witnesses to
[2:27:07] an event but they were not hirs to that
[2:27:11] event Hallelujah that's right and the
[2:27:13] Lord descended with a shout and there
[2:27:16] was many witnesses Amen on but the elect
[2:27:20] was the benefactor huah they said all
[2:27:23] heard the ministry of Moses but not
[2:27:27] all profited by it not all were Heirs of
[2:27:31] that Ministry but Joshua and Caleb being
[2:27:35] the air of the righteousness of God by
[2:27:43] faith
[2:27:47] amen look what it says in verse 16 I
[2:27:50] really like this
[2:27:53] verse I just hope I'm not taking too
[2:27:55] much
[2:27:56] time uh there was a my my sister and my
[2:28:01] brother-in-law living out in the
[2:28:04] west they were friends to a to a real
[2:28:07] estate man and he was kind of neglected
[2:28:10] by his family they never did visit him
[2:28:12] and things and and so they they took up
[2:28:14] a friendship and they became very
[2:28:17] close so the man was approaching death
[2:28:19] and he was a
[2:28:21] multi-millionaire so he he he got his
[2:28:24] his lawyer the best lawyers that he
[2:28:26] could get and he drew up a
[2:28:28] will what we call an ironclad you know a
[2:28:32] whe that's that's roten Stone and
[2:28:35] surrounded by Steel and you know through
[2:28:38] the intelligence and the intellect of
[2:28:41] all that his lawyers had and he had left
[2:28:44] everything to my sister and my
[2:28:46] brother-in-law but he left a little bit
[2:28:48] to his family that was shattered around
[2:28:51] and they were all wealthy people
[2:28:54] too so when it come time to the reading
[2:28:57] of the will that was Ironclad he wanted
[2:29:00] to be
[2:29:02] sure that these two people got this
[2:29:05] inheritance because he loved
[2:29:08] them and so he did everything legally to
[2:29:11] tie that thing and make it Ironclad that
[2:29:13] they would get what he was going to give
[2:29:15] them because he wasn't going to be here
[2:29:17] to give it to
[2:29:18] them if he give it to him and be alive
[2:29:22] then he would be sure they'd get it he'd
[2:29:24] find said this is what I
[2:29:27] decree but they contested it in
[2:29:30] court and because they had money it went
[2:29:33] on for three four or five
[2:29:35] years so my sister said I'm tired of
[2:29:38] this thing me and my
[2:29:40] husband and so they just let them have
[2:29:42] half of everything course they wanted
[2:29:44] all the money and it involved property
[2:29:46] and things so they liquidated and gave
[2:29:47] it to
[2:29:49] them
[2:29:51] God has left you and I an
[2:29:55] inheritance we lost that inheritance
[2:29:58] through Adam but he has promised to give
[2:30:02] it back in the end time to restore all
[2:30:06] of Adam's elected
[2:30:09] children Jacob not Esau Isaac not ishma
[2:30:14] amen is that right so then he had
[2:30:17] elected children that he was going to
[2:30:21] restore or
[2:30:23] redeem back to the Lost Throne they had
[2:30:26] in the Garden of
[2:30:28] Eden where he could express himself
[2:30:30] through true sunship and have sons and
[2:30:33] daughters on the earth with the power of
[2:30:35] creation because that's the
[2:30:38] identification of the fullness of deity
[2:30:41] hallel is the Satan cannot create if he
[2:30:46] could create there wouldn't have been no
[2:30:48] serpent seed he would would have created
[2:30:50] his children and created a soul and then
[2:30:53] he would have come and lived in that
[2:30:56] child because only in the soul can he
[2:30:59] place his life and have children amen he
[2:31:02] can enter into animals but he cannot
[2:31:04] have
[2:31:05] children and he could not enter in to
[2:31:08] those Souls that belong to God because
[2:31:10] they were sealed by
[2:31:13] election
[2:31:15] hallelujah hallelujah so look what God
[2:31:17] says here in Romans 4 and verse
[2:31:21] 16
[2:31:24] therefore it is of
[2:31:27] faith that it might be by Grace now
[2:31:31] Ephesians is
[2:31:32] same he writes we're saved by grace and
[2:31:36] that through
[2:31:38] faith but here now notice that he's
[2:31:41] making the
[2:31:42] emphasis on how God is going to save you
[2:31:47] and why that he's going to to use this
[2:31:51] particular
[2:31:53] Avenue to give you
[2:31:56] inheritance in other words election
[2:31:59] tells me why I got
[2:32:02] saved Grace speaks of the election of
[2:32:06] God the unmar
[2:32:09] favor and Faith tells me how I got
[2:32:15] saved because it's through faith that I
[2:32:19] came to to my
[2:32:20] salvation that I walked out of my
[2:32:24] Amnesia and recognized myself to be a
[2:32:27] Son of God and under the opening of the
[2:32:31] word we found it just wasn't according
[2:32:33] to our free moral agent but it was our
[2:32:36] free moral agent that was motivated by
[2:32:40] election by a seed that laid in you and
[2:32:43] I
[2:32:45] Hallelujah so watch what he says now he
[2:32:48] says therefore
[2:32:50] for it is of
[2:32:54] faith that it might be by Grace Amen in
[2:32:58] other words God controls
[2:33:03] Revelation so then God chose the avenue
[2:33:06] on this rock I'll build my
[2:33:09] church and from the beginning Abel by
[2:33:13] faith offered up a more excellent
[2:33:16] sacrifice that was God's Avenue to
[2:33:20] connect with his children and to provide
[2:33:22] the righteousness of that dispensation
[2:33:26] to come into His
[2:33:28] presence but he controls it ever present
[2:33:32] water from the
[2:33:33] rock if you're born again you got the
[2:33:36] Holy Ghost the life of God is in you you
[2:33:38] have enough power in you now to create a
[2:33:42] world and go live on it but he said
[2:33:44] there's a law that controls that there's
[2:33:47] a restriction that keeps you from doing
[2:33:49] that it's in you but you can't do it you
[2:33:51] try it Lord let there come an elk and
[2:33:55] let it have a big
[2:33:58] rack it didn't
[2:34:00] work Lord let that car be
[2:34:04] mine it didn't work we Tred it a lot
[2:34:07] because it's in
[2:34:09] us but God holds the key to that amen
[2:34:14] and the key to that power is
[2:34:17] Faith and then he goes on to say
[2:34:21] whatever God leads your soul to
[2:34:26] believe that's how much faith that you
[2:34:30] have so God controls the amount of
[2:34:33] Revelation you have this
[2:34:36] morning and he says however much faith
[2:34:39] that you have that's how much power is
[2:34:42] released in your
[2:34:44] life
[2:34:46] amen so the power for the Rapture the
[2:34:49] revelation that we're waiting on is in
[2:34:50] us now but we're waiting for God to
[2:34:54] Quicken it to make it a realization
[2:34:57] Hallelujah because the many it hasn't
[2:34:59] been quickened yet and there's an
[2:35:01] element that God has not quickened to us
[2:35:04] because it's not time hallu and then he
[2:35:09] goes on to say he says we don't need to
[2:35:12] pray for more
[2:35:14] power he says what you need to
[2:35:17] do is live a Godly life
[2:35:21] now he's bringing it back to character
[2:35:24] because power without character is
[2:35:26] satanic amen so David had to go through
[2:35:30] his
[2:35:32] pre-thinning of the Prophet to the
[2:35:35] anointing at Hein but he had to go
[2:35:38] through a preparatory
[2:35:40] time until all the flesh
[2:35:45] died I cut off a little bit of of Saul's
[2:35:49] here and I'm going to show them who's
[2:35:51] got
[2:35:52] control I can't believe I did that it's
[2:35:55] not me it's
[2:35:57] God that was the Flesh in David to cut
[2:36:00] that little bit of a corner off and he
[2:36:02] repented for doing that just to show
[2:36:05] that he had power over Saul he was
[2:36:07] coming to True
[2:36:09] humility
[2:36:11] amen his pre thrr days was caves and
[2:36:14] running and
[2:36:17] hiding that he could come to the place
[2:36:19] to have character to rule over the
[2:36:21] people of God Preparatory
[2:36:24] time Preparatory time for
[2:36:28] Moses Preparatory time makes a man ready
[2:36:31] for a Ministry but it doesn't make him
[2:36:33] perfect he smoked that
[2:36:36] rock but he did what he was sent to
[2:36:41] accomplish he accomplished what he was
[2:36:43] sent to
[2:36:45] do so now he
[2:36:48] says therefore or it is of Grace that it
[2:36:52] might be by grace in other words by
[2:36:55] God's
[2:36:56] control to the end that means this is
[2:37:00] why he chose this this is why we're
[2:37:03] saved by grace and that through faith
[2:37:06] that's why he chose faith that he could
[2:37:08] make it of Grace of his own
[2:37:10] choosing to the end the promise might be
[2:37:15] made
[2:37:16] sure
[2:37:18] absolute to all seed that they would
[2:37:21] inherit their promise Hallelujah you
[2:37:23] inherited your promise today not by
[2:37:25] accident that's but God made sure that
[2:37:29] you were going to inherit This Promise
[2:37:32] of rapturing faith that come through a
[2:37:38] message he wasn't going to leave it up
[2:37:40] to some
[2:37:42] preacher he wasn't going to lead it up
[2:37:44] to Mom and
[2:37:46] Dad he wasn't going to he wasn't going
[2:37:49] to leave it up to some Prophet or
[2:37:52] anything they were all avenues that he
[2:37:55] used but he controlled it yes he
[2:37:59] inspired you to the
[2:38:03] word to be
[2:38:06] sure that you draw benefits from your
[2:38:12] inheritance there ain't no loopholes in
[2:38:15] God's in God's
[2:38:17] plan there ain't no questions in God's
[2:38:19] plan who's going to get saved and who
[2:38:21] ain't which of his children are going to
[2:38:24] be redeemed and not
[2:38:26] redeemed he made it what we call
[2:38:31] airtight but yet it's a mystery to man
[2:38:34] because it's still up to your free moral
[2:38:36] agent he said he you know when I first
[2:38:38] came in the message you're predestinated
[2:38:41] so in calvinistic mind I said huh that
[2:38:45] simple I didn't have nothing to do with
[2:38:46] it he he he saved me he got me saved
[2:38:50] oh here's another
[2:38:52] message and God placed you here as he
[2:38:55] placed Adam and Eve a free moral agent
[2:38:58] to choose there a window wait a minute
[2:39:01] wait a minute now wait a minute that's
[2:39:04] Armenian ISM isn't it it's just up to me
[2:39:07] what I decide to do oh but when you
[2:39:10] blend them together in the harmony of
[2:39:12] the word he's left it up to
[2:39:15] you but he placed a part of himself to
[2:39:19] influence your choice
[2:39:22] hallelujah hallelujah though did it not
[2:39:25] have life it's part of
[2:39:30] God and that part of God is eternal but
[2:39:34] it's not eternal
[2:39:36] life that seed that's in your daddy that
[2:39:39] that germ that's in your
[2:39:42] mama it's it's living and it's part of
[2:39:45] the human race but it ain't a
[2:39:48] person but when they come together we've
[2:39:50] got a person and that Soul that's in you
[2:39:54] is part of God from the beginnings of
[2:39:56] the world but it doesn't have life but
[2:39:58] it is living it's not
[2:40:00] dead but when God comes with the Holy
[2:40:04] Spirit through the election of Grace and
[2:40:07] by the free moral agent and as the as
[2:40:10] nabal was killed and now that that uh
[2:40:14] Abigail was
[2:40:16] free and when our first husband died
[2:40:19] into repentance and justification and
[2:40:22] sanctification we were free to choose
[2:40:25] when he came to proposed to us as David
[2:40:28] sent his Messengers to Abigail and she
[2:40:32] said I'll go huah and he sent his
[2:40:34] Messengers to you and I and through the
[2:40:36] gospel we were Justified
[2:40:39] Sanctified and because there was a seed
[2:40:42] in us we chose to be United with him
[2:40:47] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:40:56] amen prise the Lord thank
[2:41:01] you so we find that now that
[2:41:05] Noah through the ministry of of
[2:41:08] Enoch and by the inspiration of
[2:41:12] God was walking with
[2:41:15] God and now he had the instructions of
[2:41:18] what to do
[2:41:20] so now I want to I want to move move
[2:41:25] ahead and we recognize that in this
[2:41:28] third
[2:41:30] pull let me see if I can uh work this
[2:41:32] thing a
[2:41:42] minute and I know you're familiar with
[2:41:44] this this a Look Away to
[2:41:48] Jesus
[2:41:51] he and I'm going to read pieces of it
[2:41:52] because I know you've read it and had it
[2:41:54] read he
[2:41:57] says so now I'm going to say something
[2:42:00] to you
[2:42:02] now I haven't said all along and that is
[2:42:06] the thing that we've looked forward to
[2:42:08] for so long for at least many years four
[2:42:12] or five maybe
[2:42:15] longer the third
[2:42:17] pull has now been
[2:42:21] Vindicated and I'm sure you all know
[2:42:23] what it
[2:42:24] is now
[2:42:26] remember there will never be an
[2:42:28] impersonation of that because it can't
[2:42:32] be see it cannot
[2:42:35] be now it's in existence so the first
[2:42:39] point I want to make
[2:42:41] is that you know when I begin to think
[2:42:44] about this third pull I was thinking
[2:42:46] about the opening of the word the third
[2:42:49] pool and and then I noticed that when
[2:42:52] brother brandham goes back and relates
[2:42:54] to the times that we saw the third pool
[2:42:56] come in the manifestation it reached all
[2:42:59] the way back to Hatty Wright all the way
[2:43:01] back actually a little bit before Hatty
[2:43:03] Wright when he spoke the squirrels
[2:43:05] that's when it
[2:43:06] began and then it evolved from H from
[2:43:09] the squirrels to hadti Wright and on
[2:43:11] through his own wife and the and the
[2:43:14] candy and the different the five times
[2:43:16] that he refers to expressly so this this
[2:43:19] is the point I want to
[2:43:20] make you and I are waiting for the
[2:43:23] adoption of the sons of
[2:43:26] God but we're not waiting on sons of God
[2:43:29] we're not waiting to become sons of God
[2:43:31] we're waiting for the
[2:43:33] adoption so we are not waiting for the
[2:43:36] third pull it's already here it's
[2:43:40] already in existence so it's not looking
[2:43:44] for something that's to come it's
[2:43:45] already right here Among Us he says it's
[2:43:48] in existence it's been Vindicated it's
[2:43:52] here and then we realize this is
[2:43:55] different but as a result of the third
[2:43:58] pool in the prophet's
[2:44:01] Ministry because the two are connected
[2:44:04] because the third pool of the prophet's
[2:44:07] Ministry brings that same power to the
[2:44:10] church the Bride come on because we know
[2:44:15] that the opening of the word
[2:44:17] 1963 was the beginning or the third pull
[2:44:21] he identifies that amen he talks about
[2:44:24] the sword he talks about the cloud he
[2:44:26] talks about the the room the shoe and
[2:44:29] all that he says this is what you've
[2:44:32] been looking at the seven seal was the
[2:44:35] mystery of the coming of Christ that
[2:44:37] even Jesus didn't know the Angels didn't
[2:44:40] know amen amen yes sir but it wasn't the
[2:44:44] coming the Lord shall descend and we
[2:44:47] shall rise to meet him him but it was
[2:44:51] the dissension according to Revelation
[2:44:54] 10:1 and According to second first
[2:44:56] Thessalonians 4 the Lord shall descend
[2:44:59] with a shout amen that was the coming
[2:45:02] what we call the appearing amen because
[2:45:06] he said he is now appearing in flesh
[2:45:09] amen this is the day of his appearing
[2:45:11] but it's part of his coming he said
[2:45:14] there's a there's the appearing and
[2:45:16] there's the coming he said the coming is
[2:45:19] is always when we meet him in that
[2:45:20] Corporal body and we are the Corporal
[2:45:24] body but this is not the body that hung
[2:45:27] at Calvary this is the body that was in
[2:45:29] the body of
[2:45:31] [Music]
[2:45:31] [Applause]
[2:45:36] Calvary amen so we are the Corporal body
[2:45:39] on Earth there is a tabernacle on Earth
[2:45:43] amen but there's a true Tabernacle in
[2:45:46] heaven and there still is John sought
[2:45:49] Revelation 4
[2:45:50] [Applause]
[2:45:52] amen but on Earth it's a
[2:45:55] bride but it reflects that which is in
[2:46:01] heaven amen praise the
[2:46:12] Lord but when that time
[2:46:17] comes when the squeeze comes
[2:46:20] down then you'll see what you've seen
[2:46:25] temporarily will be manifested in the
[2:46:28] fullness of its
[2:46:30] power now
[2:46:33] in and you forgive me if I'm taking this
[2:46:37] time but I want you to understand what
[2:46:39] we're listening to am and if I feel if I
[2:46:43] feel that we're just wearing out and
[2:46:45] wearing down we'll just
[2:46:47] stop
[2:46:50] amen amen but in
[2:46:52] 62 the spoken word The Original
[2:46:57] Seed he
[2:46:59] says the entire seed word has struck the
[2:47:02] Earth first he says a
[2:47:05] denominational seed has struck under uh
[2:47:08] Billy
[2:47:09] Graham the Pentecostal seed has struck
[2:47:13] under oil Roberts amen but he said the
[2:47:16] entire seed word
[2:47:19] has struck the
[2:47:22] Earth in other words first pull second
[2:47:25] pull the teaching
[2:47:29] Reign the entire but he said and yet
[2:47:32] Malachi
[2:47:34] 4 hasn't been fulfilled yet come on
[2:47:38] it'll come now I'm going to paraphrase
[2:47:40] this now with this so that we can relate
[2:47:42] to
[2:47:43] this when it when when Malachi 4 comes
[2:47:47] to its fullness
[2:47:49] then what we've seen in temporary power
[2:47:52] will be manifested in the fullness of
[2:47:54] its power and that's connected to the
[2:47:57] purpose of Malachi 4 AM and the purpose
[2:48:01] of Malachi 4 is to turn the hearts of
[2:48:04] the children back to the apostolic faith
[2:48:08] and that could not be accomplished
[2:48:10] without the opening of the word and the
[2:48:12] revealing of the son of
[2:48:14] man so in
[2:48:17] 1963 God is opening up a door A Door of
[2:48:22] rapturing Faith by the opening of the
[2:48:24] word just like he did with Peter he
[2:48:27] opened the door of grace to the Gentiles
[2:48:30] he opened the door of grace to the
[2:48:32] Samaritans he opened up the door of
[2:48:35] grace to the Jews and all three races
[2:48:38] the whole world the door was open he had
[2:48:42] the keys he had the message to bring
[2:48:45] Salvation to the world and he wasn't
[2:48:48] needed after that then Paul then Phillip
[2:48:51] then all the rest of them could preach
[2:48:53] cuz now the door was open and God could
[2:48:55] pour it out
[2:48:57] hallu Malachi 4 had to open the door for
[2:49:00] rapturing Faith for a translation not a
[2:49:04] resurrection we're not pointing at first
[2:49:08] fruits first fruits is Pentecost first
[2:49:10] fruits is church ages
[2:49:13] amen this message is to bring us to the
[2:49:16] fullness
[2:49:17] am
[2:49:19] Hallelujah so in 63 yes sir at the
[2:49:23] opening of the
[2:49:25] word Malachi 4 was fulfilled amen it
[2:49:29] came to its full power of the opening or
[2:49:32] revealing of the word that would bring
[2:49:34] Rapture in faith that was the prophet's
[2:49:38] third pull in his
[2:49:41] ministry
[2:49:44] amen which is not to be separated from
[2:49:46] this third pole
[2:49:50] Noah had a third
[2:49:52] pole Jesus had a third pole amen what
[2:49:56] about
[2:49:57] you amen what about the bride yes ours
[2:50:02] may not be as prevalent in the first and
[2:50:04] second
[2:50:05] pull probably there's those that could
[2:50:07] bring that type out but the third
[2:50:11] pull we have a third pull that now
[2:50:14] brother brandom is identifying that this
[2:50:17] when it comes to its full power will
[2:50:20] come at the time of the squeeze you read
[2:50:23] this anywhere you read that he always
[2:50:24] ties those two things together he puts a
[2:50:26] time element in there
[2:50:29] amen but it won't come by
[2:50:32] observation yes sir it'll have to come
[2:50:34] by inspiration to recognize
[2:50:37] it it won't be jail houses and bars
[2:50:40] maybe like we thinking it might be who
[2:50:43] knows but one thing for sure when it
[2:50:46] comes you're going to
[2:50:47] know
[2:50:50] amen let me go on down now this is in
[2:50:52] the
[2:50:54] same it it in in this it's it's
[2:51:00] um paragraph
[2:51:02] 38 to
[2:51:04] 49 I'm going to jump down here to the
[2:51:07] bottom of it it's
[2:51:10] tightening and then when the time
[2:51:13] comes and the Press comes to a
[2:51:16] place to where you you're pressed out
[2:51:19] then watch what I'm fixing to tell you
[2:51:22] in a few
[2:51:23] minutes watch that third pull then see
[2:51:28] It'll be
[2:51:30] absolutely to the total
[2:51:32] lost but it will be for the
[2:51:36] bride and the church amen so I didn't
[2:51:40] recognize that for a long time but it's
[2:51:42] actually three grp three groups that
[2:51:43] it's involved
[2:51:46] with it'll be two the two the totally
[2:51:52] lost now let me let me see if I can
[2:51:56] uh you have to forgive me but I'm I
[2:51:58] don't use this thing that much I wish I
[2:52:00] could use it more because it makes
[2:52:02] things more
[2:52:04] convenient Souls that are in prison
[2:52:07] now and this
[2:52:09] is it's it's paragraph
[2:52:12] 206 there will be a
[2:52:15] Ministry that will show great wonders
[2:52:19] Joel said so so he's referring to
[2:52:22] prophecy and there will be no time for
[2:52:27] Redemption so at the time of the
[2:52:31] manifestation of this ministry which is
[2:52:33] spoken of Joel there won't be no time
[2:52:37] for
[2:52:39] Redemption and that's that's very
[2:52:41] important it's all
[2:52:43] over the lamb has done took his book and
[2:52:47] his redeemed his
[2:52:49] over and Jesus first preached and was
[2:52:52] rejected and then went and haunted those
[2:52:54] that were in in there preach to them
[2:52:57] that were in
[2:52:58] prison could not repent no time for
[2:53:02] salvation that same
[2:53:04] ministry will have to repeat again amen
[2:53:09] what if that could be the third pull to
[2:53:12] the Eternal
[2:53:14] lost what if it is
[2:53:16] there I hope it's not
[2:53:19] but what if it is think of it just a
[2:53:22] moment minute now what if it is God
[2:53:25] forbid I got children
[2:53:28] see but it sure looks pretty close to
[2:53:30] that amen so the prophet's
[2:53:34] Ministry was in in in in the major
[2:53:38] impact of the first and second
[2:53:41] pull to me was to the denominational
[2:53:45] world what I saw was the climax of the
[2:53:48] ministry of the Holy Ghost a Capstone to
[2:53:51] the ministry of the Holy Ghost through
[2:53:53] the son of man Ministry Christ
[2:53:56] identifying himself not the Holy Ghost
[2:53:59] but Christ the Capstone of the Holy
[2:54:01] Ghost expressing the fullness of that
[2:54:04] power through a prophet revealing the
[2:54:07] son of man a son of man revealing the
[2:54:10] son of man so it brought Pentecost not
[2:54:13] just to a first fruit but actually to
[2:54:15] the discernment of the heart God work
[2:54:19] himself amen and it was it was in
[2:54:23] majority to the denominational World l a
[2:54:26] sea so it could fulfill the scriptures
[2:54:30] that they put him out by their
[2:54:32] worldliness so they put him out and
[2:54:35] crucified him the word but praise God
[2:54:38] when they killed him there had to be a
[2:54:41] resurrection cuz you cannot kill a word
[2:54:44] and the word returned in a resurrection
[2:54:47] in 19 1863 the son of man and the same
[2:54:52] experience they re they they received on
[2:54:54] the day of
[2:54:55] Pentecost which was God killed son of
[2:54:58] man and returned back Son of God we
[2:55:02] reive the same experience of
[2:55:03] dispensational change and a quickening
[2:55:07] of God upon this age from Son of God to
[2:55:10] son of
[2:55:12] man amen so we see him preaching to the
[2:55:16] totally
[2:55:17] lost in relationship to the Church of
[2:55:25] Leia amen that's not to say he didn't
[2:55:27] preach to the individual I'm not saying
[2:55:33] that but this third pull he
[2:55:36] says will come at the time of the
[2:55:39] squeeze and according to what we read
[2:55:42] here it'll be
[2:55:45] after Redemption has been finished for
[2:55:47] the Gentiles
[2:55:52] now
[2:55:57] watch if I don't get afraid of this
[2:56:10] thing all
[2:56:12] right this here is is is questions and
[2:56:15] answers this is back in 54
[2:56:19] he's talking about
[2:56:20] Paul he's talking him about out there on
[2:56:23] the on the island and that snake bites
[2:56:26] him and he talks about him being so full
[2:56:29] of the Holy Ghost that poison couldn't
[2:56:30] kill him amen like we were saying the
[2:56:33] other night I believe it was here it's
[2:56:36] coming a time of diseases what you need
[2:56:38] is the inoculation not small pox that's
[2:56:41] all right not your flu shot that's fine
[2:56:44] but the true inoculation is the Holy
[2:56:46] Ghost amen
[2:56:48] so he was so full of the inoculation of
[2:56:50] the Holy Ghost the poison of that of
[2:56:53] that serpent couldn't kill him amen
[2:56:55] that's right watch what he says and he
[2:56:57] goes on to talk about that and then he
[2:56:59] says religious people put him in Chains
[2:57:02] talking about Paul it was the religious
[2:57:05] people that had him on that
[2:57:08] boat religious people put him in Chains
[2:57:12] the very finest of the churches that day
[2:57:15] was what put him in
[2:57:17] Chains if it just wasn't for the
[2:57:19] Constitution of the United
[2:57:23] States and I guess
[2:57:33] Newland they do the same thing
[2:57:36] today that's
[2:57:38] right just
[2:57:40] wait till
[2:57:42] she's till she's broke a little more
[2:57:46] amen now he's tying to national
[2:57:50] debt in with with his third
[2:57:57] pull I don't know how many more
[2:57:59] trillions China can
[2:58:05] lend but when people need money they'll
[2:58:07] do
[2:58:08] anything amen they'll even sell out to
[2:58:13] the Catholic
[2:58:15] church if they got somebody to go their
[2:58:17] bond they'll do anything to get out of
[2:58:23] jail and he goes on this is in the same
[2:58:26] this is now this is questions and
[2:58:28] answers
[2:58:30] 54 January the
[2:58:33] 3r and so we're reading like paragraph
[2:58:38] 145 to 199 and now it's paragraph 202
[2:58:42] and I'm just saying this so it be on
[2:58:43] tape in case you want to go back and
[2:58:44] look at
[2:58:46] it so he goes on to say oh brother give
[2:58:49] me a
[2:58:50] church full of the Holy Ghost God will
[2:58:53] do in one year what all theologies fail
[2:58:57] to do in 2,000
[2:58:59] years you wait till the
[2:59:02] anointing of the church really strikes
[2:59:05] home to that Faithful Little
[2:59:08] Remnant after the doors of the
[2:59:11] Gentiles is
[2:59:14] closed oh God will anoint his church
[2:59:18] then he who's filthy let him be
[2:59:22] filthy he who's righteous let him be
[2:59:25] righteous so we see now he's tying this
[2:59:28] thing
[2:59:30] in to that shutting of the
[2:59:33] door and the last voice we hear in
[2:59:36] revelation 22 let him come quickly at
[2:59:39] the time of the Rapture at the last
[2:59:43] Feast the Feast of
[2:59:45] Tabernacles because it was at the feast
[2:59:48] of Tabernacles when they had taken a a a
[2:59:52] special vessel and they were they went
[2:59:55] down and they drew water from The Well
[2:59:57] of
[2:59:59] salom and then they they came back up
[3:00:02] and they and they and they poured that
[3:00:04] water into the Brazen
[3:00:06] Altar and while they were pray pouring
[3:00:09] that water Jesus says if any man thirst
[3:00:14] let him come and
[3:00:16] drink amen H last Feast the Bible says
[3:00:21] and he says let him come for I Am The
[3:00:25] Living Waters hallelujah amen now under
[3:00:29] ordinary circumstances the
[3:00:31] deacons or the priests that were the
[3:00:34] guards of the
[3:00:35] temple because he was out of order they
[3:00:38] would have grabbed him and hauled him
[3:00:40] out but they were afraid to touch
[3:00:44] him they didn't
[3:00:46] move now the same voice for she is
[3:00:53] him speaks and says let him that is
[3:00:57] thirst let him come Hallelujah last
[3:01:01] Feast last
[3:01:03] call amen for she is the final
[3:01:07] voice to the final
[3:01:13] age let me read one more
[3:01:16] here
[3:01:19] true sign Overlook paragraph
[3:01:24] 191 let the
[3:01:27] people let let that little flock that
[3:01:31] little
[3:01:32] Remnant that God will give
[3:01:35] him let that little Remnant go to
[3:01:38] calling out to God and watch what
[3:01:41] happens there will be a national
[3:01:44] Showdown there will be a power
[3:01:48] that they never seen
[3:01:51] before trouble of it
[3:01:54] is this time it's going to be too late
[3:01:57] for
[3:01:58] them the doors will be
[3:02:03] closed now I had other
[3:02:05] scriptures because I wanted to bring
[3:02:07] into
[3:02:08] this the adoption so if you you you can
[3:02:12] take these scriptures down or I'm not
[3:02:15] going to go to them because I don't want
[3:02:16] to take that much time
[3:02:21] Ephesians 1 and:
[3:02:24] 3-5 we are predestinated onto the
[3:02:28] adoption of children he said the mystery
[3:02:30] of his
[3:02:32] will and so you and I are
[3:02:35] predestinated onto the adoption so our
[3:02:38] whole life our whole calling all of what
[3:02:41] we are the sons of God all of Grace all
[3:02:44] of faith is to bring us to the adoption
[3:02:47] and remember the adoption is not
[3:02:50] adopting us into the family but the
[3:02:52] adoption comes to the son of the king
[3:02:56] and the son of the king is equal to the
[3:02:58] servant and no more powerful than the
[3:03:01] servant David and Jonathan were the same
[3:03:05] but in David Flo Royal Blood in Jonathan
[3:03:08] it was not
[3:03:14] amen so in the very elect flows the
[3:03:17] royal
[3:03:20] blood and only the son he rises he is
[3:03:23] equal in in subversion submission to the
[3:03:27] servant because the servant has been
[3:03:30] given authority over the
[3:03:34] son but there's a problem the servant
[3:03:37] can never raise above that position of
[3:03:40] being servant over all the servants but
[3:03:44] the king can raise to a position that
[3:03:47] the servant cannot be elevated to to sit
[3:03:51] on the throne
[3:03:54] amen but before he's recognized his
[3:03:57] King The King identifies the son as the
[3:04:04] heir and he changes his robe in a public
[3:04:08] place basba
[3:04:11] said
[3:04:12] David Solomon's supposed to be the next
[3:04:15] king but now you got another son over
[3:04:18] here by another woman that's older than
[3:04:19] him and he's claiming he's going to be
[3:04:22] King David I want you to place Solomon
[3:04:25] as
[3:04:26] king to be
[3:04:29] sure that there's not a rebellion or a
[3:04:34] vot they might get the wrong
[3:04:41] Pastor so David
[3:04:44] says take my mule
[3:04:48] nobody rides that mule but David if they
[3:04:51] caught somebody just trying it out and
[3:04:53] say boy this thing sits really nice he
[3:04:55] was a dead
[3:04:59] man you take him and you you put Solomon
[3:05:03] on
[3:05:04] there and you put the robes on him and
[3:05:07] you give him don't know if his a scepter
[3:05:09] or what and you take him and ride him
[3:05:11] all the way through the public streets
[3:05:13] and announce him as a
[3:05:16] king and he made
[3:05:19] sure that Solomon was going to be the
[3:05:21] next king
[3:05:23] [Music]
[3:05:25] amen and so he takes his son to a public
[3:05:29] place and changes the
[3:05:32] robes and gives him the Ring Of The
[3:05:35] Authority the Seal of a
[3:05:38] king and now he sits in the throne King
[3:05:42] not as king
[3:05:45] king that's the adoption
[3:05:49] brother Brandon preached that message
[3:05:50] over and over
[3:05:54] amen so the predestinated to the
[3:05:57] adoption is to be predestinated to our
[3:06:01] throne but it's not going to be the
[3:06:04] Throne of God Christ is sitting on God's
[3:06:07] Throne
[3:06:09] Spirit but his own Throne is on the
[3:06:12] earth Hallelujah that's right and we sit
[3:06:14] on that Throne not up there in the
[3:06:16] heaven with the angel angs where Adam
[3:06:19] was made to sit on the throne in the
[3:06:21] Garden of Eden you and I sit with him in
[3:06:24] his throne Earthly vessels in a
[3:06:26] glorified body but all the godhead in US
[3:06:30] of
[3:06:34] Creation in Romans he says you're pre
[3:06:36] you're predestinated to be conformed to
[3:06:39] the image of Christ of his
[3:06:46] son the Ephesians 1 we'll read
[3:06:53] it and I think we're starting to wear
[3:06:56] down a little bit so I think we're going
[3:06:57] to try to bring this thing we got
[3:07:01] enough presented here I'm going to
[3:07:05] Ephesians chapter
[3:07:08] 1 let me find my
[3:07:12] notes we read we quoted 3 through
[3:07:16] five where you talked about chosen in
[3:07:19] him we should be holy Without
[3:07:22] Blame talking about being
[3:07:25] predestinated having predestinated us
[3:07:27] verse verse five having predestinated us
[3:07:31] onto the
[3:07:32] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[3:07:36] himself according to his good
[3:07:39] pleasure now verse
[3:07:41] 11 chapter 1 verse 11 of Ephesians in
[3:07:46] whom we
[3:07:47] we
[3:07:48] have and whom we have
[3:07:52] obtained not going
[3:07:55] to but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:07:58] by the new birth and through the
[3:08:00] righteousness of
[3:08:02] faith we have obtained an
[3:08:08] inheritance being predestinated
[3:08:11] according to the purpose of him who
[3:08:13] worketh all things after the counsel of
[3:08:15] his own will that we should be to the
[3:08:19] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[3:08:25] Christ in whom ye also trusted after
[3:08:30] that you heard the word of truth and the
[3:08:33] gospel of your
[3:08:35] salvation in whom
[3:08:37] also that ye have
[3:08:39] believed ye were you were
[3:08:43] sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[3:08:46] promise
[3:08:49] and which is the
[3:08:53] earnest of our
[3:08:56] inheritance
[3:08:58] until the Redemption of the purchased
[3:09:02] possession unto the praise of his
[3:09:10] glory so how did you get the Holy
[3:09:14] Ghost well from what I'm reading here
[3:09:18] the holy spirit is part of your
[3:09:20] inheritance that's what I just
[3:09:23] read because it said I have
[3:09:26] obtained an
[3:09:29] inheritance and the Holy Ghost is the
[3:09:32] earnest of the complete inheritance that
[3:09:35] I
[3:09:37] have so then if the Holy Ghost is part
[3:09:40] of my
[3:09:42] inheritance how did you get your
[3:09:45] inheritance you were
[3:09:48] predestinated
[3:09:49] amen so you didn't get the Holy Ghost by
[3:09:52] your efforts or by
[3:09:55] accident you were predestinated before
[3:09:57] you were born to receive the Holy
[3:10:01] Ghost because that's part of your
[3:10:05] inheritance what's it going to do it's
[3:10:07] going to bring
[3:10:08] you to your full Redemption until
[3:10:11] everything that was paid for in
[3:10:13] Redemption is redeemed yes not just your
[3:10:16] soul
[3:10:17] but the body that goes with the
[3:10:20] soul a glorified body that's the
[3:10:23] fullness of our Redemption that's when
[3:10:25] death is put under
[3:10:28] fooot and we're
[3:10:30] sealed unto the day of redemption when
[3:10:33] that book is open the prophet said and
[3:10:36] Redemption comes and the fullness of
[3:10:39] redemption is the fullness of the
[3:10:42] Redemption of this Triune
[3:10:45] being and I have have the earnest of
[3:10:48] that which is the Holy Ghost amen which
[3:10:52] I was predestinated to receive but I
[3:10:55] still had to come through justification
[3:10:57] and
[3:10:58] sanctification as Peter said through the
[3:11:00] sanctification of the spirit so we had
[3:11:04] to be born through the process of God's
[3:11:06] birth that he reflected in the natural
[3:11:12] birth now go to Romans
[3:11:15] 8 same author
[3:11:17] just a different
[3:11:19] letter Romans
[3:11:21] 8 Romans
[3:11:25] 811 but if the spirit of him that raised
[3:11:28] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he
[3:11:32] that raised up Christ now that he must
[3:11:34] be God
[3:11:35] himself from the dead shall also Quicken
[3:11:39] or make alive your mortal bodies now
[3:11:41] he's not talking about your soul he's
[3:11:43] talking about your
[3:11:45] body by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[3:11:49] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[3:11:52] the flesh to live after the flesh but if
[3:11:55] we live after the flesh we shall die but
[3:11:57] if we through the through the spirit do
[3:12:00] mortify or put to death the Deeds of the
[3:12:02] body ye shall live for as many as are
[3:12:06] led by the spirit of God they are the
[3:12:09] sons of God for ye have not received the
[3:12:13] spirit of bondage again that old nature
[3:12:16] of the world at first
[3:12:19] husband you don't have to worry about
[3:12:21] nabal coming back to life he's
[3:12:25] dead amen you know I know he's not
[3:12:27] coming back to
[3:12:29] life because it said we're dead so I
[3:12:33] don't care if he comes back to life or
[3:12:35] not we're dead in Hidden Christ the lord
[3:12:38] what are we hid from the law our first
[3:12:42] husband you don't have to worry about
[3:12:44] him coming back to life if he does
[3:12:46] that's fine but you're dead and that
[3:12:48] broke that marriage vow
[3:12:53] amen you don't have to re we have not
[3:12:56] received the spirit of bondage again to
[3:12:58] fear but ye have received the spirit of
[3:13:01] adoption whereby we cry ABA father so we
[3:13:04] have received the Holy Ghost the spirit
[3:13:07] of adoption that spirit that is in you
[3:13:11] that's going to bring you to
[3:13:13] adoption and the Way Up Is Down
[3:13:17] the way to the throne was through caves
[3:13:21] and being hunted and persecuted by Saul
[3:13:25] the way to the throne was through
[3:13:27] Calvary amen because after Calvary he
[3:13:31] was exalted into heaven and all power
[3:13:36] was given to
[3:13:39] him oh we have to come through Calvary
[3:13:42] and we have to have a spirit that will
[3:13:45] give us strength amen am but not like
[3:13:49] Samson like the branch drawing from the
[3:13:52] vine strength drawing from
[3:13:55] elot Ab the father drawing
[3:13:59] Revelation from that rock that word to
[3:14:02] give you strength and
[3:14:04] Manner and it will lead you down down
[3:14:10] not under the foot of America or Newland
[3:14:13] but under the will of God submitting
[3:14:15] your will to him
[3:14:17] and going down coming
[3:14:23] up and without that Spirit you'll never
[3:14:27] come to
[3:14:29] adoption because pride and self-will
[3:14:32] will keep you from
[3:14:33] it your first
[3:14:36] husband she could not she could have
[3:14:39] nothing to do with
[3:14:41] David as long as that first husband was
[3:14:46] alive
[3:14:47] Paul said as long as that first
[3:14:49] husband's
[3:14:50] alive then that woman can't
[3:14:53] marry but what
[3:14:55] happens said we are dead in
[3:14:59] Christ so we died in him he taken that
[3:15:03] first
[3:15:04] marriage and he nailed it up there on
[3:15:07] that
[3:15:08] cross and we are HID in him from the law
[3:15:12] it can't touch us we're in him married
[3:15:15] to him
[3:15:17] and the law the penalty has been removed
[3:15:21] because we're innocent not forgiven but
[3:15:35] Justified where did we get
[3:15:38] to okay now if we just drop down a
[3:15:40] little bit verse
[3:15:43] 22 for we know
[3:15:47] I guess we know this because Paul said
[3:15:50] we
[3:15:51] know for we know at the whole creation
[3:15:57] granth and travaileth in pain together
[3:16:00] until
[3:16:02] now and not only
[3:16:04] they but ourselves
[3:16:08] also which have which have the first
[3:16:10] fruit or the earnest of our inheritance
[3:16:13] we could
[3:16:14] say until the fullness of the that which
[3:16:17] is purchased is
[3:16:19] received the first fruits of the spirit
[3:16:22] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[3:16:25] waiting for the
[3:16:27] adoption to wit or to
[3:16:30] include the Redemption of our
[3:16:33] bodies amen so then according to this
[3:16:36] scripture the fullness of our adoption
[3:16:40] is to include the the Redemption of our
[3:16:43] body so the fullness are being placed
[3:16:46] upon the throne is tied to the changing
[3:16:49] of the
[3:16:53] body
[3:16:54] fullness of our
[3:16:57] adoption the adoption to
[3:16:59] include that which was purchased we only
[3:17:02] have a portion of it we have a portion
[3:17:05] of the power of God through the baptism
[3:17:06] of the Holy Ghost through gifts and
[3:17:08] through
[3:17:10] Revelation but there will become a
[3:17:14] day that we set upon the Earth
[3:17:17] thrown and Adam lost the power of the
[3:17:21] spoken word to have
[3:17:24] children and to move trees and to
[3:17:27] fulfill the commission that he
[3:17:29] had without the spoken word he could not
[3:17:33] fulfill the commission nor could he be
[3:17:36] the fullness of the image of God on
[3:17:39] Earth in
[3:17:40] man amen but when we come to our
[3:17:44] position of restored Sons to include the
[3:17:47] body that was identified with a fallen
[3:17:50] Throne we'll receive a restored Throne
[3:17:54] that which was lost and he that holds
[3:17:56] that Throne amen do you know who holds
[3:17:59] the title deed to
[3:18:02] Israel it ain't
[3:18:05] Israel it's
[3:18:07] God he only gave it to them as an
[3:18:12] inheritance you got a grandson or a son
[3:18:15] and you're going to give them your
[3:18:17] car but you know that sometimes they get
[3:18:20] kind of in a fix for money and he might
[3:18:24] take this $5,000 $10,000 car that you
[3:18:28] give him and he'll probably sell it for
[3:18:30] a couple thousand but you don't want him
[3:18:33] to do that but you want them to have the
[3:18:35] benefit of the car so you said I'm going
[3:18:39] to give you the
[3:18:40] car and and you can get the tag and the
[3:18:43] insurance and your name but I'm holding
[3:18:45] the title cuz I don't want you to sell
[3:18:48] that thing amen so the boy goes out and

[3:18:53] to the title P or I'm going to sell it
[3:18:57] so he's at work and this this guy says

[3:19:36] title and his daddy wants that car back

[3:19:44] title dead to that land amen
[3:19:47] and god holds a title deed to your soul
[3:19:51] amen thank you Lord people try to sell
[3:19:55] their soul to Saint to get what they
[3:19:56] want but you know you can't sell

[3:20:53] resurrection Christ
[3:20:55] dies he goes down into into
[3:20:58] hell and the first part of his third
[3:21:01] pole
[3:21:02] Ministry is to preach to the souls that
[3:21:04] are in
[3:21:07] prison but he has another Ministry and
[3:21:10] that's the empty out
[3:21:13] paradise so he goes down and he preaches
[3:21:16] to the the souls that are in prison then
[3:21:17] he goes over to paradise and he gets
[3:21:19] them and he says come on let's
[3:21:21] go and that's the first
[3:21:24] fruit that's a whole bundle bundled
[3:21:27] together with the resurrection of Christ
[3:21:29] he brings forth those dead and brother
[3:21:32] brandham actually says they were in
[3:21:34] their glorified bodies walking on the
[3:21:36] streets we don't know if it was all
[3:21:38] portion whatever it was it doesn't make
[3:21:39] any difference if it was
[3:21:42] one so then first part preaching to the
[3:21:45] souls in prison second second part he
[3:21:48] takes those out of
[3:21:49] paradise now he comes up and he's he's
[3:21:53] meeting with the
[3:21:55] disciples and his whole purpose of
[3:21:57] coming to his disciples is to prove to
[3:22:01] them or manifest to them that the
[3:22:03] resurrection is
[3:22:05] on and to open up the message that he
[3:22:09] already gave him
[3:22:11] before he
[3:22:14] died because he said I've told you this
[3:22:17] before
[3:22:19] amen so he walks with him on a road to
[3:22:23] emus and they don't know who he
[3:22:27] is and he's talking to them but now it's
[3:22:31] different they heard these messages
[3:22:35] before but now it's time for the
[3:22:38] quickening power on this
[3:22:40] message so he is now bringing it forth
[3:22:44] in his in his glorified body in the
[3:22:48] dimension that it was meant to have the
[3:22:51] fullness of its power can I say amen and
[3:22:55] so he's telling them the scriptures and
[3:22:57] he's talking about quotes if he was a
[3:22:59] message believer and he's tying these
[3:23:02] things together and of course the people
[3:23:04] are walking in it's a gloomy time it's
[3:23:07] about like it was with Abraham when he
[3:23:09] went out and sat under the oak tree that
[3:23:10] day and it looked like everything was
[3:23:12] going wrong he couldn't have children
[3:23:14] she couldn't have children still he hold
[3:23:16] the promise in his hand he was looking
[3:23:17] to the Unseen but every time he looked
[3:23:20] into the mirror there was a
[3:23:22] problem amen that problem was him it was
[3:23:24] his
[3:23:25] body but he believed what he was looking
[3:23:27] at in the mirror didn't have anything to
[3:23:28] do with the power of God God didn't have
[3:23:31] a problem with it Abraham might have the
[3:23:33] doctor might have had the neighbors
[3:23:35] might have had but God didn't and
[3:23:37] Abraham in faith didn't he didn't even
[3:23:39] consider
[3:23:40] it he didn't he didn't put his head in
[3:23:43] the sand and ignored it but he believed
[3:23:45] that God's power was great than a dead
[3:23:48] body and he went out and sat under the
[3:23:50] tree and brother Bron said it looked
[3:23:51] like everything was going wrong so
[3:23:54] here's the disciples walking down and
[3:23:57] they're just kicking cans and rocks you
[3:23:59] know I'm just oh man I just thought we
[3:24:00] was really I thought that climax was
[3:24:03] coming and he's gone I just don't
[3:24:05] understand you know and here comes this
[3:24:07] guy and I had one brother who was
[3:24:08] preaching this was years ago and I
[3:24:10] always thought it was true you know I
[3:24:12] think it is today they walking down
[3:24:14] there and they're going well you
[3:24:16] remember what he said yeah so they're
[3:24:18] going over the quotes and scriptures and
[3:24:20] things and they just so here comes up
[3:24:22] this man and he's smiling you know and
[3:24:25] so they've been through this crucifixion
[3:24:26] in all this turmoil in Jerusalem and
[3:24:28] everybody you know ain't nobody really
[3:24:30] too happy because the Pharisees and them
[3:24:33] they ain't happy because they can't find
[3:24:34] jesus' body and they're looking for it
[3:24:36] and you know I mean the whole place
[3:24:38] stirred up so here comes this guy and
[3:24:39] he's said hey what's going on Brothers
[3:24:42] uh you been having a good day and they
[3:24:43] said oh we say you're a stranger around
[3:24:45] here
[3:24:47] because he was
[3:24:50] smiling you know sometimes you come to
[3:24:52] church and you can tell the visitors CU
[3:24:54] they're smiling and everybody else
[3:24:59] said it's nice to get visitors once in a
[3:25:02] while so anyway he begins to open the
[3:25:05] word to them under the
[3:25:07] anointing and they're being inspired
[3:25:10] while the inspired word is coming to
[3:25:12] him yeah that's right oh yeah yeah I can
[3:25:18] see it now and he creates a vision
[3:25:21] through words of the resurrection of the
[3:25:23] crucifixion and what had taken place in
[3:25:25] the
[3:25:26] scriptures oh by the time they get to
[3:25:28] the house they're in
[3:25:31] Revival because the bride's Revival has
[3:25:33] come now and they're in Revival and and
[3:25:36] he that brought the Revival said all
[3:25:38] right we'll see you guys at the next uh
[3:25:40] maybe next prayer meeting or something
[3:25:42] let's see you say oh no oh
[3:25:44] no don't go 45 minutes ain't
[3:25:48] enough oh no oh no don't go one hour
[3:25:52] ain't
[3:25:54] enough oh no oh no he's dead pray for
[3:25:57] him bring him back up don't let that
[3:25:59] stop the
[3:26:01] service don't go now come on you oh I
[3:26:04] hear some more we're hungry but go on
[3:26:06] preaching while we
[3:26:09] eat you know the preacher he goes out he
[3:26:11] preaches a sermon there he preaches one
[3:26:13] there he gets over there and he preaches
[3:26:14] and he never does stop preaching
[3:26:18] I was raised with a bunch of preachers
[3:26:19] that when you come together and you was
[3:26:21] talking you didn't raise your hand cuz
[3:26:24] you wouldn't ever get to sayen nothing
[3:26:26] you just had to butt
[3:26:28] in and then one brother says you know
[3:26:30] there's one thing I hate is for somebody
[3:26:32] to butt in after I've already butted
[3:26:40] inah so they're walking along there and
[3:26:42] now they're
[3:26:43] rejoicing come in so he comes in they
[3:26:46] don't know who he is it's not because
[3:26:49] they didn't know him when he was 24
[3:26:50] years old it's because the scripture
[3:26:52] that it was withholden from
[3:26:55] him so he sits down he says okay let's
[3:26:58] eat and they said would you ask the
[3:26:59] blessing said
[3:27:00] sure he takes the
[3:27:03] bread and He blesses
[3:27:05] it and he says the same blessing that he
[3:27:08] said in the F the
[3:27:13] Passover and they said you know
[3:27:17] Jesus did that same thing he did
[3:27:20] something that was done before the
[3:27:23] crucifixion now he's doing it after that
[3:27:27] and that particular thing identifies to
[3:27:29] them who he
[3:27:31] is and her eyes was
[3:27:34] open and her understanding was open amen
[3:27:38] and then he gave them a
[3:27:41] message he said go to
[3:27:44] Jerusalem and wait
[3:27:48] now the resurrection was on but they
[3:27:49] needed a message to tell them what to do
[3:27:52] amen and the message said go to
[3:27:55] Jerusalem and wait until the promise of
[3:27:57] the father
[3:28:00] comes so now if if that pattern would
[3:28:06] hold when I begin in this message
[3:28:10] several years ago I began to ponder I
[3:28:12] thought I heard people say well the
[3:28:14] third poll when we're being 100
[3:28:16] persecuted we'll just speak food on the
[3:28:18] table you know and I thought well that
[3:28:21] that's nice then other said well you
[3:28:24] know we'll speak Limbs and we'll speak
[3:28:25] our glorified bodies and we'll speak
[3:28:27] that I said well that's nice because how
[3:28:30] would I know if Malachi 4 has been
[3:28:34] fulfilled or not if I don't know what it
[3:28:35] was to
[3:28:36] do I would have to know the purpose of
[3:28:39] Malachi 4 to even know that it had been
[3:28:42] fulfilled amen now what we've seen in
[3:28:46] portion we're not waiting for the third
[3:28:48] pool so we can hear people testify said
[3:28:51] oh you know I I had to third pull
[3:28:54] manifests for me I I said this this
[3:28:56] happened I don't that don't surprise
[3:29:00] me because it's here he said it's
[3:29:03] identified so that means that if anybody
[3:29:06] comes to that Faith they can manifest it
[3:29:08] but now to the fullness of its power or
[3:29:11] to the purpose that it was sent to what
[3:29:14] is the purpose of the third poll
[3:29:16] if it's not speaking our
[3:29:18] bodies and it's not going to be for
[3:29:20] rapturing Faith that's in the
[3:29:23] message so I'm not going to be speaking
[3:29:25] rapturing Faith to us rapturing faith is
[3:29:28] what brings us to the third pole amen
[3:29:31] amen the message is what brings us to
[3:29:34] the third
[3:29:36] pole so what's the purpose of it God
[3:29:40] ain't no
[3:29:42] clown and it's going to be to the
[3:29:44] totally lost it's going to be for the
[3:29:46] bride and for the church the
[3:29:50] foolish now how's it going to be for me
[3:29:52] if you're not do anything for me it's
[3:29:55] going to manifest the fullness when you
[3:29:58] got the Holy Ghost there was things that
[3:29:59] manifested in your life that you knew
[3:30:01] you had the Holy Ghost not by what the
[3:30:04] Pentecostal the Baptist told you what
[3:30:05] the word told you
[3:30:10] amen so the so the Rapture of the
[3:30:14] Resurrection takes place
[3:30:17] and the body change takes
[3:30:20] place and brother
[3:30:23] Gerald now is in his glorified
[3:30:28] body but I'm foolish
[3:30:33] virgin I'm still looking for the
[3:30:36] Rapture I'm still looking for the
[3:30:39] squeeze I'm still looking for
[3:30:41] things so brother Gerald comes up to me
[3:30:45] says how you doing
[3:30:47] brother oh how you doing you a Believer
[3:30:51] yeah oh how you doing brother I don't
[3:30:54] know who he
[3:30:55] is and he says
[3:30:58] uh brother
[3:31:01] Mike you know the resurrection's already
[3:31:03] taken
[3:31:04] place and the body change has already
[3:31:07] come and you're in Tribulation
[3:31:11] period
[3:31:13] oh is that right now I guess you you're
[3:31:16] in your glorified body yes I
[3:31:18] am yeah well I hav heard that I've heard
[3:31:20] that for about 10 years they preaching
[3:31:23] that all kinds of places you know
[3:31:25] they're in their glorified body and the
[3:31:26] Rapture and you know what Paul said he
[3:31:29] said but brother
[3:31:31] Mike and he starts going over the
[3:31:34] scriptures and he starts going over the
[3:31:38] quotes but Neil he's not in a he's not
[3:31:41] in a position of partial
[3:31:44] revelation he's in the fullness of that
[3:31:47] Revelation not the knowledge of it the
[3:31:50] actual alley and there's something
[3:31:51] different when a man has the Holy Ghost
[3:31:53] and preaches about the Holy Ghost and a
[3:31:56] man that doesn't have the Holy Ghost and
[3:31:57] preaches about the Holy
[3:32:02] Ghost so he starts going over the
[3:32:04] scripture I say yeah you know that's
[3:32:06] right you're right yeah and man I just
[3:32:09] seeing things I ever saw before and I'm
[3:32:11] just kind of in Revival now what could
[3:32:14] he do
[3:32:17] what could he
[3:32:18] do to prove to
[3:32:23] me that he was in the fullness of his
[3:32:25] adoption that he was in his glorified
[3:32:27] body and that I was in
[3:32:30] Tribulation what would happen if he
[3:32:32] spoke something into
[3:32:34] existence he broke the bread he would
[3:32:37] have to do something before and after
[3:32:39] that would identify
[3:32:42] him so now it gave a
[3:32:44] purpose it would Express the fullness of
[3:32:47] the
[3:32:48] sunship poor brother
[3:32:50] Gerald but it would also be for me
[3:32:53] because now I'm going to give my
[3:32:56] life but how can I give my life without
[3:33:00] faith how can I give my life without
[3:33:02] recognizing the
[3:33:04] Beast how can I give my life without
[3:33:07] recognizing who God is and that I'm in
[3:33:09] Tribulation because I have to give my
[3:33:11] life in faith I have to have a
[3:33:14] revelation I die for that Revelation
[3:33:19] amen and so then he gives me the
[3:33:22] Revelation that now I can die
[3:33:25] for build an
[3:33:28] ark and then I go because lot had a
[3:33:33] Ministry and Noah had a Ministry and I
[3:33:35] go and start preaching to those that are
[3:33:37] elected foolish
[3:33:41] virgin and it and it sweeps the world
[3:33:44] not just one man but
[3:33:46] and I'm not saying it just going to
[3:33:47] start with with message Believers but
[3:33:50] they have that word that they can spread
[3:33:52] to the other foolish that never had the
[3:33:54] opportunity to hear
[3:33:57] it and
[3:34:00] anoch walked with God and Noah not
[3:34:03] walked with
[3:34:05] God through the message of Enoch and I
[3:34:08] believe the fullness of the ministry
[3:34:10] there's a ministry that's going on but
[3:34:12] the fullness of that Ministry the third
[3:34:14] pull then it won't be for show it won't
[3:34:17] be for de demonstration but it'll be for
[3:34:19] a confirmation it'll be for something
[3:34:20] that God uses in
[3:34:24] Redemption amen prise the Lord
[3:34:27] hallelujah as we bow our
[3:34:30] heads Heavenly
[3:34:32] Father Lord we don't know what all
[3:34:37] holds and your Prophet said the time
[3:34:39] that we've got things figured out we may
[3:34:42] not have them figured out and I'm not
[3:34:45] trying to to figure things out Lord amen
[3:34:48] but I'm trying to look into your word
[3:34:50] that you brought to us and I'm not dug
[3:34:52] into this and demanded Revelation but
[3:34:55] little by little it's accumulated
[3:34:59] amen and father however you choose to do
[3:35:02] to do this let us be ready when you
[3:35:06] come as you told Brother Gerald one day
[3:35:10] when he asked you when are you coming he
[3:35:12] said well when are you
[3:35:14] going I had whatever it was that you
[3:35:16] spoke to him yes Lord so may we be ready
[3:35:21] may we not put a period behind anything
[3:35:23] that we feel that we understand because
[3:35:26] we only understand in
[3:35:28] portion but Lord at least it can open up
[3:35:31] the map to us for those that don't know
[3:35:35] that Elijah has come they're still
[3:35:37] looking for an
[3:35:38] Elijah those that have or don't have the
[3:35:41] Holy Ghost are seeking a Holy Ghost and
[3:35:43] for those that have it they seeking
[3:35:45] another
[3:35:46] spirit so father we don't want to be
[3:35:50] deceived and you said
[3:35:52] prophecy
[3:35:54] revealed is light Into Darkness amen so
[3:35:58] may we Ponder these things into our
[3:36:03] hearts yes
[3:36:06] Jesus may you bless these people this
[3:36:08] morning your children for their patience
[3:36:11] for their
[3:36:12] endurance for their
[3:36:14] longsuffering
[3:36:16] and forgive me your servant if I've
[3:36:18] taken too much time with your
[3:36:21] children but may you inspire that which
[3:36:24] what you have
[3:36:25] given for you can take one word and do
[3:36:28] much with that amen where man takes many
[3:36:32] words and does
[3:36:33] little so without your inspiration
[3:36:36] without your life upon and in the word
[3:36:40] it will profit us
[3:36:41] nothing and any Revelation that you give
[3:36:44] us
[3:36:46] we know one thing that it will
[3:36:49] do it will change and transform our
[3:36:53] character yes
[3:36:55] Lord into the very image of thy son
[3:36:59] Christ so these things are not given to
[3:37:02] bring knowledge and
[3:37:05] pride but it's to bring love and
[3:37:08] experience amen and knowledge is Jesus
[3:37:12] had that he had that total sec security
[3:37:15] and was not
[3:37:18] insecure may you comfort your people
[3:37:20] Lord with your word yes J for I ask it
[3:37:24] in the precious name Hallelujah of thy
[3:37:26] son Jesus Christ amen amen Amen brother
[3:37:32] Gerald if you
[3:37:44] come
[3:37:46] God bless you brother God bless you
[3:37:49] brother and uh you could have went
[3:37:55] on so I'll pick up where he left
[3:37:59] off all
[3:38:01] right bring it to
[3:38:03] completion not
[3:38:05] five amen we have eight it's a new
[3:38:08] beginning that's right it's a holy
[3:38:13] convocation so we sng of going want to
[3:38:15] eight
[3:38:17] children but this is a generation that
[3:38:19] doesn't want it amen but but again we
[3:38:22] want to thank God for the
[3:38:25] word and
[3:38:27] again brought it back to me when when he
[3:38:30] made just made a remark concerning Jesus
[3:38:32] and the railroad to emus and I said well
[3:38:35] amen I said I said what Jesus did is
[3:38:39] doing and what was that that was to
[3:38:42] bring the word to their attention right
[3:38:45] to bring them back to the word right
[3:38:48] because whatever happens or is happening
[3:38:50] and will happen for the Christian you
[3:38:53] want to know where it is in the word
[3:38:55] that's right and th this is Faith amen
[3:38:58] by the grace of God and uh he was he was
[3:39:02] Jesus he said was happy and laughing why
[3:39:05] because Jesus knew that it was the
[3:39:08] scriptures fulfilled Hallelujah and but
[3:39:11] for them that they they were lacking the
[3:39:13] Revelation that's right now they had
[3:39:15] knowledge because Jesus told them he
[3:39:18] said I'm going to Jerusalem I'm going to
[3:39:20] be betrayed into the hands of sinful men
[3:39:23] they going to be crucified and so on and
[3:39:25] he knew all of that and they knew that
[3:39:28] yeah but again they lack revelation of
[3:39:31] it and people can have a re a knowledge
[3:39:34] rather of of the message a knowledge of
[3:39:37] the Rapture a knowledge of the
[3:39:39] Resurrection knowledge of the of the
[3:39:41] change of our bodies the coming of the
[3:39:43] Lord but still not have the revelation
[3:39:46] of it and what is the Revelation it is
[3:39:49] the reality it is it is the spiritual
[3:39:53] reality of what God's doing that you
[3:39:54] can't you don't see what you're
[3:39:56] naturalized but you see what you're
[3:39:58] spiritualized amen it is it is it is uh
[3:40:02] it is your faith as it were is becoming
[3:40:04] sight is becoming more and more in into
[3:40:08] reality and I said Lord I said that's it
[3:40:11] I said what I said the brother was doing
[3:40:13] I said preaching the word the word word
[3:40:15] the word the word I said that's what
[3:40:17] Jesus did and I said the Bible says it
[3:40:20] began at Moses and he went right on
[3:40:22] through to the scriptures and he
[3:40:24] expounded to them that the Messiah had
[3:40:27] to come and what the Messiah had to do
[3:40:30] and and and then still still they did
[3:40:33] not recognize him as the Messiah right
[3:40:36] until he got into their homes right
[3:40:38] let's get more personal amen let's come
[3:40:43] into the secret place of the most high
[3:40:46] amen and there and let God reveal to you
[3:40:49] what you need to know about you and him
[3:40:52] amen it's it becomes a very God makes it
[3:40:55] personal that's right it's not really
[3:40:58] impersonal like a religion out there you
[3:41:00] know going into the church and sing and
[3:41:03] and uh and and you know you put your
[3:41:05] money in or whatever and or somebody
[3:41:07] prays you listen to the preacher and
[3:41:09] then everybody goes home and so on no no
[3:41:12] no no it's it's you're coming here for a
[3:41:14] reason purpose why because there's a
[3:41:17] personal relationship between you and
[3:41:20] God you know and and again I'll be
[3:41:23] honest to most of the churches are there
[3:41:27] and even to even churches around the
[3:41:29] message that God is just an idol is no
[3:41:33] more than an object of worship it is you
[3:41:35] know it's it's just a book right it's
[3:41:38] just this book or a spoken word book
[3:41:42] or you know it could be this right here
[3:41:45] or this right here it's just all
[3:41:48] physical it's all knowledge it's all
[3:41:51] intellectual it's all by the letter of
[3:41:53] the word but there's no spiritual
[3:41:56] reality to it that's right amen and and
[3:41:59] you can believe again you you know you
[3:42:01] can believe the cloud and and you can
[3:42:03] believe the billar of fire you can
[3:42:05] believe the altar of fire and all of
[3:42:07] these things but again it's knowledge
[3:42:10] but but in order for it to for God to do
[3:42:12] something in your life or for it to
[3:42:15] something in you and bring you closer to
[3:42:17] God you got to have
[3:42:19] Revelation you got to have the spiritual
[3:42:22] Holy Ghost revelation of it you got to
[3:42:24] have faith it's not it's not just going
[3:42:27] by what somebody told you no see again I
[3:42:30] preached that in Virginia in
[3:42:33] 1984 and in brother fer Church
[3:42:37] secondhand religion right and and and
[3:42:41] the prophet of God said he said what did
[3:42:43] pilate have he had a second hand
[3:42:45] religion he said what do you mean
[3:42:48] because he said to Jesus he you know he
[3:42:50] said are you the Christ yeah are you the
[3:42:54] Son of God are you this and that and
[3:42:56] what did Jesus say Jesus said did he
[3:42:59] said did you say that of
[3:43:01] yourself or is it did somebody else tell
[3:43:03] it to you about me do that is that a
[3:43:07] revelation that God gave you and you're
[3:43:09] saying it of yourself or is it you're
[3:43:12] you're going be what somebody else said
[3:43:14] he said pilot was going by what somebody
[3:43:16] else said he had a secondhand religion
[3:43:19] right amen it wasn't a spiritual
[3:43:21] Revelation to him and the same thing
[3:43:24] with the message of the hour it's not a
[3:43:26] spiritual Revelation to everybody and to
[3:43:28] many it's a secondhand religion oh I
[3:43:32] ain't going by what brother Mike said I
[3:43:35] ain't going by what brother jural said I
[3:43:36] ain't going by what brother green said I
[3:43:38] ain't going by by what William brandom
[3:43:40] said that's right and it's just a second
[3:43:42] and God looks down that's a secondhand
[3:43:45] religion right amen but where's the life
[3:43:49] yeah where is the life again we're
[3:43:52] coming back down to the to the again
[3:43:54] three kinds of Believers right we can
[3:43:57] narrow down to the foolish virgin and
[3:43:58] the wise virgin but then there are the
[3:44:00] others out there right they're not even
[3:44:02] virgins right amen but religious but but
[3:44:07] they're not virgins right so what but
[3:44:09] again there's there's Adam again he
[3:44:11] talked about Adam and Enoch and the the
[3:44:13] foolish virgins and the wife
[3:44:16] virgins and one is going into a
[3:44:18] tribulation and the other is going to
[3:44:19] going into a Rapture one is going to
[3:44:21] Bear witness of the of God in the
[3:44:24] Rapture and the resurrection and the
[3:44:26] other one's going to Bear witness of God
[3:44:27] in Tribulation that's right they are
[3:44:30] God's got a witness no matter where it
[3:44:32] is no matter what's going on no matter
[3:44:34] what he's doing the devil is there but
[3:44:36] God's there too that's right amen
[3:44:40] and well no no no no God's not going to
[3:44:43] have his children going to tribulation
[3:44:46] but again our brother brought it out
[3:44:48] through the word there was an Enoch that
[3:44:51] walked with God and he was
[3:44:53] gone and and and and he didn't have to
[3:44:56] experience death right he didn't have to
[3:44:58] go through sorrow he didn't have to go
[3:45:00] through all these things but there is
[3:45:02] Adam look what he went through look what
[3:45:04] he had to
[3:45:07] endure not ad Noah look what he had to
[3:45:11] endure and look what he had to go
[3:45:13] through and he brought it out listen to
[3:45:16] something else too when he he he was
[3:45:17] bringing at all the
[3:45:19] families how many how many of no of
[3:45:22] those families died in the flood yeah
[3:45:26] how many cousins and aunts and uncles
[3:45:28] and and nephews and nieces died in the
[3:45:31] flood right and was there was their
[3:45:34] Uncle no Uncle Noah there and preaching
[3:45:38] but you know they didn't want to be
[3:45:40] identified with him because he was crazy
[3:45:42] to the world right you know bill because
[3:45:45] they building a boat on dry land right
[3:45:48] and not only that you you're talking
[3:45:50] about raining and what what do you mean
[3:45:53] rain that's we never had rain before you
[3:45:57] know where where's that going to come
[3:45:58] from you know and so it's crazy to the
[3:46:01] world it's crazy to the make Believers
[3:46:04] and so on but again too late it was too
[3:46:10] late when uh brother Barry preached it
[3:46:13] here one time and uh
[3:46:15] and he said you know maybe they were
[3:46:18] having a coming up making fun of no
[3:46:21] something about with with
[3:46:23] umbrellas and saying well Noah where's
[3:46:27] where's the rain where's the rain oh
[3:46:29] it's there he believed it and and and
[3:46:32] even KN went into went into the ark for
[3:46:34] seven
[3:46:35] days nothing seven days maybe the Sun
[3:46:39] was shining maybe it was the best
[3:46:41] weather they ever
[3:46:43] had but anden the prophet of God brought
[3:46:46] says oh well the family went over and
[3:46:48] says well Dad are you sure yes he said
[3:46:51] I'm
[3:46:52] sure I am sure God told me and we I
[3:46:56] didn't spend all this time building this
[3:46:58] Ark you know and for nothing I know that
[3:47:02] it's the word of the Lord he believed
[3:47:05] Enoch he believed what God had said
[3:47:08] through Enoch he believed the prophecy
[3:47:10] that our brother brought out concerning
[3:47:12] Enoch's son Methuselah after his going
[3:47:15] the
[3:47:16] delus the delus so he he he he saw these
[3:47:20] things whereas the rest of the world
[3:47:21] didn't didn't pay any attention to it so
[3:47:23] we're seeing things that the rest of the
[3:47:25] world is not paying any attention to
[3:47:27] them we're seeing things there in the
[3:47:30] Gentile realm in the Jewish realm all
[3:47:32] over the world we see these things
[3:47:34] coming to coming to to pass and and the
[3:47:37] world is just going on in their religion
[3:47:40] going on in their form of godliness or
[3:47:42] going on in their unbelief but the
[3:47:46] bride is lifting up her head of
[3:47:51] understanding lifting up her head head
[3:47:53] of understanding and what and entering
[3:47:56] into the Promised word for for the
[3:48:00] bride
[3:48:02] listen he talked about the foolish
[3:48:04] virgin and the wise virgin do you know
[3:48:06] what that extra oil
[3:48:11] was that was the revelation of his
[3:48:13] coming
[3:48:15] for the
[3:48:18] bride oh that was just more power more
[3:48:20] anointing it was
[3:48:25] Revelation
[3:48:28] yeah they took that extra oil with them
[3:48:31] because the scripture says prophesied it
[3:48:34] they wanted to be ready for it yeah
[3:48:36] that's and the and the and the messenger
[3:48:38] said they add the extra oil of

[3:49:07] Archangel the the last Trump because she
[3:49:10] got the extra oil of Revelation
[3:49:13] right and and that's why that's why
[3:49:15] we're getting ready that's why we're
[3:49:16] acting different and that's why we're
[3:49:18] giving God
[3:49:21] preeminence the foolish virgin knows
[3:49:24] there's something to
[3:49:26] it they know there's something to
[3:49:29] it the prophet of God said he said
[3:49:33] listen he said the hour is
[3:49:35] coming when he said in the tribulation

[3:49:40] standing for now that's right why
[3:49:43] because they're and he said he said he

[3:50:24] they're going to say oh what they were
[3:50:26] what they were saying is the
[3:50:29] truth as again our brother brought this
[3:50:31] morning what what Noah was saying what
[3:50:34] what he KN say was the
[3:50:37] truth what he said about his son was the
[3:50:40] truth it was a revelation from God and
[3:50:44] and the prise of God in this hour said
[3:50:46] he said the in the tribulation those
[3:50:48] foolish virgins they're going to they're
[3:50:50] it's going to all come back when they
[3:50:51] see this they see that they see
[3:50:53] something else that's going to come back
[3:50:55] to them and they're going to say Amen
[3:50:57] look what they were preaching was the
[3:50:58] truth right and they're going to lay
[3:51:01] down their lives for it that's right he
[3:51:03] said they'll die for what you and I are

[3:51:11] putting us into into another dimension
[3:51:13] into eternity it's good thank God for

[3:51:29] preaching
[3:51:30] word he's not just preaching well God

[3:51:35] prophet and here's the cloud of angels
[3:51:38] and here's the pillar of fire and all
[3:51:40] these things yeah
[3:51:42] what the devil sees it
[3:51:45] devil believes it the devil knows it's
[3:51:48] God but he ain't going to in no
[3:51:52] Rapture what's all that
[3:51:55] for to bring us back to what's going to
[3:51:57] give us the faith that pleases God to
[3:52:00] get us out of
[3:52:02] here that's like when he preached he
[3:52:04] preaches a rap
[3:52:08] listen where's brother
[3:52:13] R oh he there no he's
[3:52:16] not no he's not he's right
[3:52:24] there he said listen he said I am above
[3:52:29] the congregation looking down on you
[3:52:34] right he said you see me there behind
[3:52:36] the pulpit he said I'm not there he said
[3:52:39] I'm up
[3:52:41] there and he said I'm looking down on
[3:52:43] the congregation
[3:52:45] he was in another
[3:52:46] dimension
[3:52:49] brother it is the it is the word the
[3:52:52] revelation of the word that has taken us
[3:52:54] into that Dimension and making that
[3:52:56] Dimension more cons making us more
[3:52:58] conscious of that Dimension right see
[3:53:01] and you can you can see him
[3:53:04] there and again this flower was only
[3:53:08] Tiny But Revel it's only a few words
[3:53:12] there but it's a big Revel in the
[3:53:16] heart
[3:53:18] amen so people can look at that and just
[3:53:21] identify with a picture yeah yeah yeah
[3:53:24] yeah of course they're denying it now a
[3:53:25] lot of people
[3:53:27] yeah but again you've got to you've got
[3:53:31] to recognize what that's for and get
[3:53:33] back to the
[3:53:34] word as like when he preached the
[3:53:36] Rapture
[3:53:41] message if most preachers today if they
[3:53:43] preach the capure what would the text to
[3:53:47] use 1 Thessalonians
[3:53:51] 4 he didn't use that text no he did and
[3:53:55] has surprised me but he he read it and
[3:53:59] the text and then he went on went on to
[3:54:01] say now he said I'm going I'm going to
[3:54:03] say things maybe he said he said that
[3:54:05] that he said in such a way of the
[3:54:07] Rapture he said that that you wouldn't
[3:54:09] say it this
[3:54:10] way you don't believe it this
[3:54:12] way cuz they believe the Rapture this
[3:54:15] way the Rapture that way but brother

[3:54:26] right what yeah in that tent vision is
[3:54:31] the resurrection in that t vision is the
[3:54:33] rapture in that t vision is the change

[3:54:41] come out they couldn't explain anything
[3:54:43] right

[3:55:33] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[3:55:36] life and he said to behold the beauty of
[3:55:39] the Lord and to inquire in his
[3:55:43] Temple for understanding for
[3:55:47] Revelation for he said in the time of

[4:00:42] building
[4:00:44] spiritual Amnesia and there was a
[4:00:46] visitor that came in he said what that
[4:00:48] brother Jo preach on and one of your
[4:00:50] brethren told him something use a a
[4:00:53] certain word for it and I said well I
[4:00:56] said when you get the Holy Ghost you get
[4:00:58] your memory
[4:01:00] back I said who you are where you come
[4:01:03] from job got his memory
[4:01:05] back you know eventually he said I know
[4:01:09] my redeemer liveth but God came down to
[4:01:11] check his spiritual memory where were
[4:01:13] you when I I laid the foundations of the
[4:01:15] Earth where were you when I when they
[4:01:17] when this these sang and these worship
[4:01:20] and so on so job was back there too amen
[4:01:26] so brother I tell you when you get the
[4:01:27] Holy Ghost I said you get your memory
[4:01:29] back whereby we cry
[4:01:32] oh Father right
[4:01:36] father father right oh you're my
[4:01:41] father it gives us our memories back as
[4:01:43] to who we are and where we come from and
[4:01:46] who our father is who our brothers and
[4:01:49] sisters are that's right it's not the
[4:01:52] ones that my siblings In the Flesh right
[4:01:55] no no it's my brothers and sisters in
[4:02:00] Christ have you got your memory back or
[4:02:02] do you still have
[4:02:06] amnesia you know when you feel that
[4:02:08] you've been in this place before you've
[4:02:10] experienced this before you've seen this
[4:02:12] before you've heard that before well why
[4:02:14] because that's where you come from we're
[4:02:16] going back to where we come
[4:02:23] from make sure you got the Holy Ghost
[4:02:27] your
[4:02:29] memory of who you are and who your
[4:02:32] father is if you got amnesia you don't
[4:02:35] know who your mother or father is
[4:02:37] brothers sisters anybody like that you
[4:02:38] don't
[4:02:39] know but you get the Holy Ghost it all
[4:02:42] comes back
[4:02:47] I don't know what the word is but one of
[4:02:48] the Brethren there did tell that brother
[4:02:50] to use a certain scientific term that
[4:02:53] that I was preaching
[4:02:55] on about being there before I've been
[4:02:58] here
[4:03:00] before de Vu that was it oh yeah he said
[4:03:04] he preached on deu I didn't use that
[4:03:06] term but but that was their
[4:03:08] understanding of it when I
[4:03:10] finish it's like you've been there
[4:03:12] before
[4:03:15] yeah because now you're not going by
[4:03:18] this natural memory you're going by the
[4:03:20] Holy Ghost
[4:03:21] memory
[4:03:25] Hallelujah he brings those things to
[4:03:28] your
[4:03:29] remembrance
[4:03:34] Hallelujah and our brother brought in
[4:03:36] about the preparation for the
[4:03:38] ministry it's
[4:03:42] good and but
[4:03:45] Abraham he had to leave home family and
[4:03:47] friends right even when he got his son
[4:03:51] God asked to sacrifice his
[4:03:55] son then there was Moses he had to run
[4:03:58] from
[4:03:59] Egypt
[4:04:01] right because of murder
[4:04:05] right when I became a firer a Shepherd
[4:04:10] right met God in the mountain in a
[4:04:12] pillar of Fire
[4:04:15] right on his way down he had got into a
[4:04:18] fight with his wife and a battle there
[4:04:20] concerning the circum of his son
[4:04:23] right
[4:04:26] amen God Was preparing him that's right
[4:04:29] for the ministry right what he was to do
[4:04:32] in
[4:04:35] Egypt then I thought about David or
[4:04:38] rather our brother brought out a David
[4:04:40] and it's me I never I I did bring out I
[4:04:43] always bring out another one I'll
[4:04:44] mention in a minute but it brought he
[4:04:48] brought it to my remembrance when he
[4:04:50] said B about
[4:04:51] David
[4:04:53] David he had the throne by a promise of
[4:04:56] God that's right but he had to fight his
[4:04:58] way all the way to the throne
[4:05:07] right I like that he had to be in the
[4:05:11] caves hiding in the mountains right he
[4:05:14] even went into the the philisa there
[4:05:17] somewhere somewhere another country
[4:05:19] hiding you know and uh just just
[4:05:23] pretending he was somebody else and oh
[4:05:26] brother and yet he was a Shepherd he
[4:05:31] killed the lion he killed the bear he
[4:05:33] went out there and killed the Goliath
[4:05:36] and and and here he is a prophet
[4:05:38] anointed him as the
[4:05:41] king thus sayeth the Lord
[4:05:44] where's the
[4:05:45] throne right it's yours but you got to
[4:05:47] fight your way through you got to fight
[4:05:50] all the way to the
[4:05:51] throne you talk about preparation for
[4:05:54] the ministry and I said Lord praise the
[4:05:57] Lord I said that that's a Vindication
[4:05:59] again I get I said what he's saying is a
[4:06:01] Vindication of what I was ministering on
[4:06:03] a number of times yeah what was it and I
[4:06:07] ministered on
[4:06:09] Joseph I said he had to go he had to go
[4:06:13] to the the throne right but I said where
[4:06:15] did he start I said he started in the
[4:06:17] pit yeah that's
[4:06:19] right he started in the pit his brothers
[4:06:22] threw him in a
[4:06:23] pit and then they sold him as a slave
[4:06:27] then he got falsely accused and ended up
[4:06:29] in
[4:06:29] prison
[4:06:31] right
[4:06:33] what surely God's not with that
[4:06:36] man God
[4:06:38] was and we think you know this happens
[4:06:41] to this man or this woman oh God's not
[4:06:43] with them if God was with them that
[4:06:45] wouldn't happen this wouldn't happen
[4:06:47] it's God preparing them watch out yes
[4:06:50] better watch out Amen brother that's
[4:06:54] it so don't think because you're a child
[4:06:57] of God everything's going to go good no
[4:07:00] God's going to work on you according to
[4:07:02] the need to get you in his will to line
[4:07:04] you up with his word to get you in the
[4:07:06] middle of the road and stay
[4:07:09] there Lord oh that always struck me but
[4:07:13] now now there's more after hearing the
[4:07:14] word this morning yeah that's right
[4:07:18] there's more to it it's not just it's
[4:07:19] not just
[4:07:21] Joseph no no no
[4:07:23] no look what our our Lord went
[4:07:30] through brother you got to go from the
[4:07:32] pit to the throne that's
[4:07:34] right and yet it was
[4:07:37] God all the others never experienced it
[4:07:40] no they were enjoying life right they
[4:07:43] wrot they're having you know their
[4:07:45] families and their farming and their
[4:07:47] cattle and everything else and oh they
[4:07:49] were prosperous and it was and and and
[4:07:52] they were the like the foolish virgins
[4:07:54] and there was Joseph
[4:07:56] there going through all of that that's
[4:07:59] right and he was the chosen of God here
[4:08:02] was David there going through all of
[4:08:04] that and he was he was anointed king of
[4:08:06] it of of of
[4:08:08] Israel here was Moses look what he had
[4:08:11] doing do her
[4:08:15] what Abra and you could go on with
[4:08:18] others in the scriptures
[4:08:24] amazing
[4:08:31] brother the
[4:08:33] bride is in the
[4:08:36] tent the bride is in the Resurrection
[4:08:38] The Bride is in the
[4:08:41] Rapture it's just what we got to do now
[4:08:44] is we're going to move on with the word
[4:08:46] believe the word to get this flesh out
[4:08:48] of the
[4:08:50] way that's all I
[4:08:54] pray that the other dimension is more
[4:08:56] real than this
[4:08:58] one we got to be if you got the Holy
[4:09:00] Ghost you will be more sensitive to the
[4:09:02] other dimension than this
[4:09:09] one I am
[4:09:12] Alpha and and Omega that's right the
[4:09:15] bridegroom was the
[4:09:17] alpha the bride is the
[4:09:21] Omega that's what the messenger
[4:09:26] said the alpha the Omega he started it
[4:09:30] now he's in the bride finishing it
[4:09:32] that's
[4:09:34] right to the
[4:09:37] Gentiles I am Alpha and
[4:09:41] Omega the beginning and the end the
[4:09:44] first and the last blessed are they that
[4:09:47] do his
[4:09:49] Commandments that they may have right to
[4:09:52] the tree of life and may enter in
[4:09:54] through the gates into the
[4:09:59] city for without our
[4:10:03] dogs and Sorcerers and arm mongers
[4:10:07] murderers
[4:10:09] idolators and whosoever loveth and
[4:10:12] maketh a lie I Jesus have sent my angel
[4:10:15] to testify unto you these things in the
[4:10:20] churches
[4:10:24] amazing I have sent mine Angel to
[4:10:28] testify unto you these things in the
[4:10:31] churches I am the root and offspring of
[4:10:35] David and the braid and morning
[4:10:38] star and the spirit and the
[4:10:42] bride
[4:10:44] oh just the
[4:10:46] spirit no the spirit and the
[4:10:52] bride what a position she's
[4:10:56] in the spirit and the bride say
[4:11:00] come I believe this is the scripture our
[4:11:03] brother was referencing when he said
[4:11:05] come drink of the
[4:11:08] waters and he said the spirit and the
[4:11:11] bride say come
[4:11:17] not just the spirit amen but the
[4:11:22] bride and let him that heareth say
[4:11:26] come right and let him that is a thirst
[4:11:31] come and whosoever will let him take the
[4:11:34] Water of Life freely
[4:11:39] amen and the foolish virgin takes it
[4:11:44] but the warning is given right right
[4:11:47] don't add to it right and don't take
[4:11:49] away from it
[4:11:51] right or your name will be taken out of
[4:11:54] the book of life right amen that's
[4:11:59] right and you're a part out of the city
[4:12:02] and so
[4:12:06] on no wonder John said even so come Lord
[4:12:12] Jesus
[4:12:14] why when the bride has come to this spot
[4:12:16] and has got to endure all of
[4:12:18] this even so come
[4:12:22] even he said even so come Lord Jesus and
[4:12:26] he said he finished with this the grace
[4:12:29] of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all
[4:12:33] amen amen why Abraham needed the grace
[4:12:38] of God that's right Moses David
[4:12:43] Joseph needed the grace of God and you
[4:12:46] and I need Grace if you're going to
[4:12:48] stand for the
[4:12:49] truth you need
[4:12:52] Grace to preach what our brother Mike
[4:12:54] Michael is preaching needs
[4:12:57] Grace to take that stand you need Grace
[4:13:01] to stay with the word you need Grace
[4:13:04] that's right without adding to it and
[4:13:05] taking from it you need Grace that's
[4:13:08] right it's going to be difficult and
[4:13:11] hard and even more harder for the
[4:13:12] ministry that's true yeah that's true
[4:13:16] why to stay with the truth that's right
[4:13:19] and not be influenced
[4:13:22] to compromise just to keep people in the
[4:13:27] church or just to have a bigger
[4:13:30] Church
[4:13:32] no
[4:13:34] no Jesus let it all
[4:13:39] go by his
[4:13:41] grace by by the grace of God to let it
[4:13:44] all
