morning god bless you thank you turn your eyes upon Jesus and look phone to this wonderful face amen and the things of Earth will grow strangely dim the strange thing will take place everything start fading away he said you forget about the beans cooking on the stove you forget about this forget about that he said what is that he said the word is beginning to materialize before you so that's what we want this morning is for God's Word to materialize before us and everything will strangely just grow dim around us amen just haven't really enjoyed my time here and fellowship and and just really felt the delivered in your ministry and just you know when you have the Liberty what happens is when a minister is ministering and there's a genuine fool the net always maybe the congregation knows because it's not always a lot of noise and things going on but when there's a true divine pull and and I believe that comes from the people were in a unity and you know when brother Branham was on the scene there was a certain unity amongst the people because everybody was looking at him when he passed off the scene then there was a disunity everybody jockeying for position and different things taking place so then when he begins to manifest himself in a congregation through worship and in preparation for the word there becomes a certain unity not just looking to the minister that's ministering we're looking for Christ to come and reveal something to us and when you have a true unity brother Brown said that there's nothing but what the Holy Ghost can't do if we are in a true unity right and that's not all trying to think the same thought but turning our eyes to him this morning looking past these veils of flesh and then a strange thing happens that while the minister is ministering things start coming forth he never thought of before or oh I'll preach sometimes the subject at home and then I'll go someplace else and preach it and while I'm preaching it other things begin to open up on the thing that I preached at home I go home and I preach it again because it it unfolds under that inspiration so I'm as much as in anticipation as you are because I need revelation just like you do and sometimes it comes from my own mouth I'll be up preaching and I'll say something and you know and I'll be thinking while I'm preaching and I think that was that was good that was pretty good you know just and that's what we want this morning is we got the things laid out we got our notes but without here we can do nothing new notes coming from a man can be a lecture and I can go out and be received in an academic way but what we want this morning is his inspiration he said we've accepted the very truths of the Bible he said the scripture says we had become the very righteousness of God not imputed to become the righteousness of God he said but to many it's not real he said because it's not inspired so there's much of the message this morning that we've accepted and we believe it with our hearts but there's something that strangely it hasn't caused the the world to grow strangely dim in the light of the glory of his presence because that's what his face is when he turns his face towards someone that's his that's his presence unveiling himself to that individual so we want this morning as a further unveiling a greater realization you know I go out I Love New Mexico that's where I'm from and I'll go out there and I'll stand oh you can you can see for a hundred miles down there in Carolina the beauty is like a woman it's trees it's a softness to go out west and those Rockies it's like the ruggedness of the man and I just love the shield' of wind blowing and I'll go out there and I know I've got to come back to Carolina I try to soak it I tried to absorb it I try to do everything I can but you know when I go back home it's like I've never been there because he can't take it with but I've been there I know what it's like and I can tell you about it and I can create a vision in you but if you haven't been there you really don't know what it's like and some of you go there or no now stand there with you on a mountain I said isn't this just wonderful and you be seeing rocks and cactus and lizards and snakes and no tree within 100 miles just say I say isn't this beautiful you say what a waste as a beauty isn't I have the beholder this branch shall be beautiful in that day but not to all people it will be a beauty to behold but not to all people so may unfold himself this morning and may he inspires or to thy word just pray for me it just seems like when you come to the close of a service you're trying to bring everything to a summarization and to a climax and so that we can we can leave you with something that will take you further down the road and it's not our desire to confuse you or to leave you in a bewildered state but to leave something of his word in your heart to bring a greater clarity in the day that we live and so just pray for me that we can I was trying to explain to brother Marcus morning coming I just the more I try to condemn something the more it gets scattered out but I know he can do all things my desires that you know there's things I would like to say but there's things that he wants to say so if I can channel myself and just let him speak what he wants to speak this morning then that would be all that we need God can do much with a little Peter just a 15 or 20 minute message and 3,000 people were converted brother branham went over to the two end you know I think it wasn't missionary been over ten years and he had what one convert to show for all that and in fifteen minutes thirty thousand blanketed natives if he comes on the scene he can do much a little they might to fish five loads he can do much with little and man he does little with much so may he come the song that and do much with what little that we have in our hearts and minds I'd like to maybe this morning I kind of do not changing directions but I my notes a little bit different man sitting here in the study but I'd like to if we can I'd like to read two verses of Scripture let you be seated and then read some more I'd like to turn the Psalms 103 and verse seven and David riding here in the Psalms Psalms 103 in verse 7 he made known his ways on to Moses his acts on to the children of Israel so now David writing here and her inspiration that there's a difference to know his ways and his acts you know people can be in church and they can see God do a lot of things they can see sick people heal I could see miracles they could see much but there's a difference in seeing the acts of God and the ways of God as we was talking that he said I have not given you a heart to perceive and yet they'd seen things they'd heard things they'd witnessed things they'd actually been partakers of those things they've eaten at those things they drink of those things but yet they only knew according to the scriptures they only knew the acts of God but there was something different in Moses and we also know when Joshua and Caleb that they had a heart to perceive and what was God trying to reveal to them in the wilderness he said that you might know that I am the Lord your God and then we taken from the scripture he said to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and that means to whom is the power of God made known so in if you turn over to Psalms 95 and verse 10 we also read this remember that he said over there in Deuteronomy 29 I've led you these 40 years but I've not given you a heart to perceive or a heart to understand when I led you all these years you've seen these things you've heard these things to particularly things but I'm not giving you a heart to perceive or to understand and the whole purpose was that he would reveal himself his great power to the people that when they came to Kadish Bardia they would trust in him and his power and stand in the power of god and not her own verse 10 Psalms 95 40 years long was I grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do err in their heart then they have and they have not known my ways and that and that word error there it actually means to go straight and I want you to turn to Hebrews I said two scriptures but I got I had that one marked out in Hebrews chapter 3 I want to read this same thing verse 7 of Hebrews 3 we're for as the holy ghost death today if you will hear his voice harden not your heart as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me saw my mighty saw my works forty years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart that means again to go astray and they have not known my ways now remember Israel didn't know the acts of God there was a portion of God that was revealed to them that they experienced but yet he hadn't given them a heart to perceive and here he says nor my ways of this heart to perceive or to understand actually has to do with knowing God and knowing his ways and that's what they lacked and that's why they failed because the power of God had not been revealed to them when they came to Katie's Bardia now if we look over here in chapter 4 of Hebrews verse two for unto us was the gospel preached as well as on to them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and I looked at word up one time it's the same word mixed means like married becoming one mixed mixed with faith and them that heard it so this heart to perceive what they lacked was faith or a revelation because this is all speaking of the same thing using a little different words but it's the same it's the same picture for we have the four we which have believed do enter into rest and they were just barrier hips Heavenly Father faced Lord we thank you for your mercies and graces mornings and through your people your children that's gathered themselves together and I ask that you'd bless each one that's come and you bless our gathering together may you bless the reading of your word and Lord as those that stood that day and the enemy was around about them far they laid their petition before you they declared your majesty in your power they declared their relationship to you as the seed of Abraham and then they stood and they said our eyes are upon you and Lord as they had said that and they stood waiting upon you then you inspired a man and you spoke to them and said the battle is not yours this is mine so father we gathered ourselves together this morning to worship you and to praise you and for the hearing of your word no father their eyes of our hearts are upon you this morning may you reveal yourself to each and every one of us and unfold yourself in the path and in the way that we're at the level of where we're at the corner where we're at the crossroads where we're at may you supplied to us the revelation Lord to take us through the trials that surround us the enemy that desires to destroy us for our eyes are upon you destroy ya so father we commit these things into thy hands that's the best as we can as your children and as human beings we take our hands off of this Lord and let you guide us this morning for a moment in time that may turn into eternity we ask in Jesus name Amen amen he may be seated so we're trying to follow this thought of prophecy preeminence imperfection and so we've we've just been looking at this aspect especially of prophecy David says you know in the Psalms 42 he said the god of my life he's talking about how he he thirsts for God and not for God but a living God and he was he was so thirsting for God and said I've been to church and I worship there at the house of God the temple and the yet there's tears in my eyes why because he longed for the presence of God and he identifies him in that Psalm as the psalm of our the god of my life and then the next Psalm he comes down and he declares the God of my strength he talked about the god of his strength so this morning we're looking for strength we're looking for Revelation we don't stand in the in our power but we're wanting to spend in the power of his might not not looking upon our strength before Goliath but looking to that God that has delivered us from the world that has called us out of this on for generation this generation of darkness and ignorance and he's called you into the kingdom of his son into the kingdom of light and now he has taken us from the power of darkness and set us into his kingdom and so as we were we're looking at prophecy being unfolded being revealed but too many they can walk in this prophecy and it can be made known to them they can realize the prophecy as we looked at Israel in a in two groups we had one one group of people and they they all come out together it was a mixed multitude we know and they they all was delivered from the enemy they all came out from under the blood they had all applied that blood over the lentil in the doorpost and all protec another of the lamb they'd come out together they was baptized on the Moses and and they they were affected by the prophecy being fulfilled they danced up and down but now it comes here to Deuteronomy and Deuteronomy I understand it means two laws but it doesn't mean two different covenants or two different laws but when God brought them out of Egypt and brought them to Mount Sinai he gave them his word Moses brought the Ten Commandments brought the law of Moses all of that was called the law the civil all the moral law all those things he gave him the commandments he set before them the way of life and the way of death the way of life obedience the way of death rejection so now he's come down there standing in the fields of Moab standing right there to Jordan getting ready to cross over now and they're going to go in and take possession adoption so they're there now right at at the final stage just before circumcision and Moses is speaking to them so the messenger that gave that that original word as we would not say on the day of Pentecost or back there in the book of Acts now he's given what he had given they're the same messenger what he gave to them at Mount Sinai now he's bringing it again so it's not two different laws but we find it's that original message being given to them by that messenger could we say that under the first and second pull we're getting that word that was brought on the day of Pentecost is actually being brought under that first and second pool and he's restoring back that which was lost down through the church ages because Paul said there has to come a falling away they're going to give heed to seducing spirits and and and doctrines of the devil expressly in the last days not just down because he cannot come until the man of sin be revealed the one that's caused us falling away so there has to be in the even time your largest shall restore all things so there had to come a message of restoration so as Moses now is standing there he's standing on the edge of a dispensational change because they've come out but they've got to go in so they come out they haven't gone in yet and so now he's restoring to them this generation that was born in the way they didn't have that Mount Sinai visitation or experience so now God has given them that same experience through Moses the same messenger is now the son of God now is still bringing this message in that dispensation but it's fixing to change from from Moses to Joshua it's fixing the change from the Son of God the Son of man because under the Son of God ministry he met the pillar of fire and the same pillar of fire he met they met but now Joshua doesn't meet them at pillar fire he meets a man the captain of the host so we're at a we're at a dispensational change Katie's bar dia there they they forfeited their rights not even seeing the enemy but being intimidated by fear and because that the arm of the Lord had not been revealed to them because they they had not recognized the Lord their God he doubt been recently seen the acts of him but Moses knew his ways and we know that Joshua and Caleb they also knew his ways because when it came and they looked at the same challenge of the hour they had the strength to face the challenge of the enemy just as David's stood there and face the challenge of Goliath why not his ability but his eyes was looking away to Jesus he was looking to God because he had had an experience with him and while he was in the wilderness backer keeping the Sheep the mighty God unveiled himself to David and David knew his ways but salt knew his acts to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed to them that's heard the report and believed the report and to them it opens up the avenue and channel of Revelation to recognize prophecy being fulfilled and because that prophecy has been fulfilled and they've been given a heart to believe or perceiver to understand when they come to Katie's Barnea the word has a preeminence in her heart because they said the defense the the enemy's defense is gone from them God has given us the land so they had come to actually that the word had a preeminence and they came to perfection and perfect faith yeah man tries to bring these things but you can't do that God has to do that and the time that God speaks like on the telephone there's a preconceived theology that takes place but man must wait on God to reveal his word and to interpret it and unfold it so then then Jesus he speaking to Peter he says it's coming to time Peter you won't be able to go where where do you want to go but there's going to be a man he's gonna come and he's gonna bind you speaking of his death and he says well what about him the one that laid his head on your bosom what what about him what's gonna happen in the world what is it chief he should tarry till I come and all of a sudden they heard the voice and they built a body around that voice they they heard the prophecy they heard the word of God and they said how'd you hear what he said he ain't gonna die Ethan I didn't say that they said that so we find that when God speaks many times behold a virgin shall conceive many heard that they they had preconceived theology but preconceived as something that you concede before it actually comes to pass or it's revealed and they had some certain preconceived ideas but when they came to Kadish Bardia they knew the acts of God but they didn't know them the way of God and it says they did err in her heart and that means go astray in other words to go astray means you no longer following the leadership you go astray you go back in the edge if you go back into the denomination's you err in your heart you go astray what caused them to go astray because in their hearts they didn't know his way they knew the acts of God but not his wife many people in this message they know the acts of God they loved the Prophet they many things but now they're going into error because why they're going astray because the power God has not been revealed here he's coming to the seals he's coming to he's stepping into his ministry there's a there's a changing of dispensations from son of God the Son of Man why because the son of God has come to what I believe was the capstone of the Son of God ministry which was which was a the maasai excite amongst them Messiah kind didn't call the bride but it brought both all that those ages of gifts of the Spirit and prophecy now the giver of the gift had come not brother Branham but Christ and the Messiah kind revealing the secrets of the heart so to me I see the capstone other of the restoration of the word and the Holy Spirit unveiling himself in a way that he'd never unveiled himself before since the days of Jesus Christ but it had to come a sign to the Gentiles because they never had that sign but it didn't call a bride it caught her attention but those are the things that many people major on sign in the hand the Messiah time to know the secrets of the heart but when it came to that there was a rejection a rejection of the unveiling of God in that day the stumbling stone it wasn't really the doctrine it was the unveiling of prophecy they stumbled at the stone but to us it was a precious stone they rejected the word what did it say in the beginning was the word and word was with god and it came as a light to lighten all man send thy light and truth to give me strength to lead me tonight Tabernacle that I might worship you in truth and spirit give me a heart to perceive because we can know as acts and we can draw benefits from it we can change the way we act and dress but the center of that must be the life of Christ and you and me and when they come to cater smarty attend and go astray but that was really a mental battle they never physically met the enemy they were only told about the enemy and so they began to draw a picture of these enemies well we're like grasshoppers oh my they started in their imagination there they were probably bigger than they really were they thought about that little grasshopper and I thought mine these men must be like mountains but they couldn't trust God you know there's a lot of people that came right up to this message so you got to be rebaptised in the name of Jesus Christ but they said well I was already baptized and Father Son and Holy Ghost and I was thinking about Jesus when I went in the water are you new women you know you ever done anything wrong before you married your husband and and you didn't tell him you got to confess that you know there was a lot of things and and they they couldn't face those giants it was too much for him like the rich ruler but now here they was they was actually that generation died off a new generation is born and they're fixing the cross Jordan into the adoption and here's Moses now delivering again rehearse and rehearse in the church ages all the things they've been through and rehearsing the promise that perfect step into so here they are standing right now Jordan well how did the enemy meet him Baylin thousand fell the world in this church natural oh we believe the same message come on over let's watch the movies on TV and I had any nothing wrong going a little swimming and bathing your knowing it who likes to go on your clothes let's just really get in the spirit of this swimming let's put on our swimsuits oh you men you know there's nothing wrong wearing these shorts you know the army wears shorts by these ain't no women's underneath clothes they got over there to debayle yard anything and those women those false doctrines those harlots they entice them and they fell he said the major sin of the day the major sin were leanness what did we see creeping in other churches now let's not only been in this message than 73 I don't understand what's taking place the fashions of the world are coming in is everything sensuality is coming back in men masculinity I just I don't like to go into it just leave it alone people are going astray they don't believe in holiness and holiness don't get you to heaven that's what the Pentecostal Holiness thought long sleeves long dresses cover everything up well that's what they did they covered everything up they covered the evil spirits up temper to fight like a buzz on gossip and oh I outside they look good remind me of others AIDS virus you know the bird flu it are this bird virus it it attacks the respiratory system and and the word said he breathed into them and they became a living soul so it takes the breath of life what is that it it's the inspiration but but what does the AIDS virus do it attacks the immune system and in the body what is it it's a it's the white blood cells that's your immune system and they say that this virus is a highly intelligent virus remember that virus belongs to the kingdom of Satan and I find there's there's much of a parallel between the way he works in the religious room as he works in the in the physical rim through infectious diseases and so this this AIDS virus from what I understand that it attacks the white blood cell now it just don't gather around it and destroy it it infiltrates it like an osmosis it it actually places its life in the white blood cell and it destroys it from the inside 300 years of persecution of the church and they grew stronger they went down in catacombs and they hid and they were killing them they were hiding him down but it kept the church pure because to be a believer you had to be rugged knows days but then chant but then Satan changes in morphe he became the champion of Christianity Constantine and what he couldn't do under under 300 years of persecution and trying to trying to kill a church now he he injected his own life into that and he became the champion of Christianity became respected became the national religion in just a few years he destroyed it through worldliness and paganism and it evolved into the great Catholic Church and so they say that the throne I understand that this this AIDS virus is white blood cells it's actually got two divisions you have a command center in your white blood cells and then you have the soldiers in the white blood cells now this memory system of the white blood cells it has a longer longevity it it it lasts longer it lives longer and it's the part of the white blood cells that remembers things it remembers the infections it discerns that when there's an enemy comes into the body and so then it it has a way to the intelligence of our body and through our immune system it sends it out it sends the soldiers out and you get a little infection and all that pus and all that it's those white blood cells giving their life and they're fighting that that that infection and so they were trying to find the control center of this of this this viruses AIDS virus and you know where it hit itself right in the memory system and they couldn't attack that memory system with with the they couldn't kill it because if they killed it they would kill a new system and what kills that person is because that the immune system is neutralized then they can be killed by just common diseases that our body normally that are normally rejects but there's another thing they said that what what the medical community was was concerned about is that these people with the AIDS virus because they didn't have a on a new system they became a betting ground for new diseases and so they were a betting ground for diseases that would come out and attack the normal person and that disease that the body didn't have an immune system to that disease but if something new like polygamy and did in return ministry and get on talking about so you used to be able to walk through those through those communities and people look like zombies you could tell he's got a virus yeah stay away from him but then they come up with this antidote it didn't heal him it would it only had a way of putting this AIDS virus kinda in in remission so you could take this this whatever it was is concoction and you know what after a few years you could walk into these communities and they look just as healthy as you and me women didn't cut their hair I mean didn't wear shorts why because they knew then they didn't go down and playing golf in their little shorts and things and and they didn't go out here mix bathing why because they highly intelligent you know but yet on the inside there was spirits of adultery fornication they they looked fine but now they said that because they look fine and they felt good you know you can be running a fever and feeling just all kind of achy all over and take about two or three aspirin or Advil whatever you take and the symptoms go away and you feel fine you go hug your brother and you're all drinking out think up but you need well yeah you feel good and so the AIDS virus has spread in three times faster than what it was and the AIDS virus starting a community of homosexuals and now we've legalized this and so they say that that now that we're standing on the edge of the pre penicillin age there are so many antibiotics I don't know what is I just pick a number I'll just say twelve twelve no more worship but I'll just say twelve and so with each passing age that there's a war taking place between infectious diseases and antibiotics there's a war taking place and they say each time that this this this disease or whatever it is overcomes it's antibiotic then they pass it on somehow genetically to the next virus and now that these antibiotics don't have an effect and and so we're coming to the place now that we're we're to the last two or three antibiotics and once and once that that last antibiotic is rendered neutral as far as being able to take care of these these sicknesses then we're back into pre penicillin age in other words would be back where it was before God allowed man to break into his laboratory of healing and discovered by accident penicillin and so now we've come to the end of the age and Satan the Antichrist the man of sin has been attacking our immune system and our immune system is the Holy Spirit and the Word of God and the control center is the fivefold ministry that keep us from going into amnesia and forgetting who the enemy is so he is infiltrated the pulpit to neutralize the church so God is sent an antibiotic the Lord himself shall descend with a challenge and if this antibiotic is rejected you're back in the pre gospel age no more salvation no more redemption for the Gentiles we're really at the end of civilization in time and we can see the effects of this upon the people spiritually that once the whole world knew that all the Christian world knew that that Rome was the great [ __ ] you never heard him preach too much on the on the daughters we hear a lot of people preaching about the great [ __ ] Luther about the great [ __ ] but Luther never talked about daughters but we not only talk about the great [ __ ] we talk about daughters because we know who they are so now we find that the problem was was in their heart and David after he had been with Bathsheba and Nathan met him and his sin was exposed he knew it was there it's kind of like the man that brother Brandon was talking to was homosexual he was going to kill himself you remember the story brother Bisco tells it on this on his own witness that that boy no he was a homosexual he had a wife he had he had children but he was in such a disparity that he he despised and yet it was something couldn't get it was a spirit that had gone with him and he could not get delivered from that spirit he was subject to that thing and yet he hated it like drugs or alcohol or whatever and he had a wife that he loved and his children that he loved or else he wouldn't been thinking about taking his own life and there was that profit just to preach in the way and he stops he said soldier boy cries out to them what happens that friend of his he catches him right on the edge of the wilderness just a few minutes later he had been gone out there and they wouldn't have known where he was they couldn't track him they didn't have the GPS a little smartphone right but there was somebody else it was leading them that arranged a time like the woman at the well it takes him out to him the walk takes his hat off presence of the Lord tells him what's wrong with him prayed for him he comes back he said I'm free he's a saint I might not be able to take you down but he can take you down this morning and he can talk to you and you can be free he won't tell you something you don't already know but with that he'll bring with the exposure he'll bring deliverance and so Davidson was exposed and he wanted to serve God but you knew he knew that the problem laid down in his heart he was a man after God's own heart not something was there he said create in me a clean heart for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he out of the heart comes the issues of life he said create in me a clean heart restore unto me the joy of my salvation see when man gets caught in sin it needs to go down to the heart and only the word can go to the heart and it can clean that heart if you allow them to come in and invite his presence the love of the truth and let him clean you now I want to start over again over here in Matthew 24 and we're trying to remember what we've been bringing coming through and Matthew 24 one through three and we'll just take this as far as we can and then we'll just we'll just we'll just put it on pause and then God sent another ministries raise up your pastor brother lush and the journal he can he can just it's the Holy Ghost that's his message it's not money so if anything is incomplete he's the one that's going to complete it Matthew 24 in the first three verses and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see and not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world so now I want to drop down to verse 36 but of that day and hour no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only so no man knows he said he himself didn't know and the angels in heaven didn't know but only his father so this was a this was a secret this was a mystery that God held within himself it was a mystery he wasn't Jesus's mystery it wasn't the Angels mystery it was God's mystery the mystery of the time when he would return his return is not a mystery the rapture is not a mystery the Second Coming is not a mystery the time is a mystery it was not a mystery that Israel was going to go in captivity 400 years and it wasn't because of the chronology of time and what God had given out it wasn't as much of a mystery as Wynand he was going to come but then living for hundred years you know 400 years is a long time it don't sound like much in the Bible when we think about a thousand years two thousand six thousand we think four hundred years but the United States has been a nation just a little over two hundred years and you look at our grass roots when we started look at the women where we started look at the churches where we started look at the faith where we started look at the patriarchs the father's when we started now look at it can you imagine the condition of 400 years when America would look like if it would go that long look at look at denominations Baptist Pentecostal look how they've evolved in just just a few years not even a hundred years they don't even hold the same image they had when they started corrupted infiltrated by Satan you said they've infiltrated us ministers crept in other words infiltrated to get inside to kill it from the inside - to destroy us when man was telling me about a article he read about that and he said science calls the AIDS virus a beautiful virus he's a beautiful well it's beautiful because of its intelligence and the way that it operates not because it does good things that great [ __ ] was beautiful john looked at her and wondered hee hee hee my what a beautiful thing and he said they put that aids virus on a slide with an antibiotic and and what I understand what he told me was that that AIDS virus didn't attack that antibiotic it surrounded it and it studied it and when it studied it it attacked it and neutralized it oh you say that men can't wear shorts hmm and well I see right here it's it's just in your heart too what counts this isn't women underwear he didn't already with Tomba you say it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair oh but it gives you headaches don't it and then right here it says in this word it says it's a value it's not your hair you know they study it serpent seed I don't know and they circle it and they study it and then they inject her preconceived see ology the doctrine of the devil and they neutralize it is that I don't know if they do that Jesus said because that you've taught the commandments of men for the commandments of God and the tradition of man as the Word of God you neutralized the effect of the word you made the word not affect they didn't do away with the word they neutralized the effect of the gospel because they didn't have the right prescription to put the antidote together that would kill it the disease they said well I think that's just a little bit too much of that that's not that you know sometimes when you cook there's a recipe but a real cook they just I just picture this and adapt of that and a handful of this well can you give us a recipe oh yeah two pinches of this and one dab of that and throw in a little bit of this and but you can't do that with God's Word you can't throw in a pinch of this and a dab of that and come to this and stir it up and it's gonna come out gods god of water he's a got a precision and st. wants to neutralize that word so now we have Christ speaking of his coming because I say tell us when these things shall be what shall be the sign of thy coming so somehow they knew that there was a coming somewhere along the line they knew that there was a coming he says I don't know he gave him the sign for the parable of the fig tree but he said I don't know the day or the hour he said the angels in heaven don't know only my father all right st. John 14 we're just going to read some really familiar Scripture with you in st. John 14 and first three verses let not your heart be troubled he believed in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not saw I would not I would have if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself and where I am there may you be also so now the church has been looking from the day of Pentecost has been looking for Christ to return in what we call the rapture or the resurrection and the change of the body and rising to meet him in the air this is not a mystery to most of the church there's part of Christianity that denies this what they call prima Linnaeus and Postman Linnaeus and all this other kind of stuff and and so they've been waiting for his return Peter speaks of it Paul speaks of it they're looking for the return so now I can't come until after the falling away and this and this virus this man has since been exposed to nickel ad and Antichrist spirit this this horseman that went down with identity until until the fourth fourth seal and then he was identified and his name was called out his name was death and hell followed him he was identified same man but he didn't have an identity until the last seal of the four seals the church age so he says I go to prepare a place for you and I'll come again so I understand there's a I forget what church it is what denomination it is but they believe that on the day of Pentecost that's when he when he came back you know there was many comings of Christ Christ came to Paul there's many comings of Christ but this coming he says I'm gonna come and receive you unto myself he didn't do that when he come to to Paul he didn't do that on the day of Pentecost so we're looking for the time that he comes to receive us onto himself and we meet him in the air that corporal body won't touch the earth but we'll meet him in the air so we've been looking for that the Ezreal was looking for God to deliver them with a mighty hand they were waiting for that prophecy to be fulfilled here come Moses here come Aaron signs and wonders vindicated the message they were said of God to deliver them but you know in their preconceived ideas that didn't happen just as lexing like they thought it would second service they didn't even hear him they wouldn't even listen to him why because there was so much going on in their lives they were so distracted by the taskmasters and the burden of the of the bricks they became impatient with the ministry and you know and Jesus said all when he tarries there's going to be those they're gonna start beating people and just you know but in patience you possess your soul and you can't have that kind of patience unless you know God's Way so now we find that he's coming again that's what the church has been waiting on let's go to Romans 8 I just want to read these just kind of because we want to say something here but we've got to simply say sometimes get all on the same page we just want to get a flow of something here and we pray it's just a continuation of what we started Friday with the basic that we've got to we've we've got to have the inspiration to give us a heart to understand that we might the power of God would be revealed to us more than just a Pentecostal way Romans 8 chapter 16 I mean verse 16 the spirit itself bears witness unto our spirit that we are the children of God and if the children then heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified first comes humility and then comes exaltation so sir first comes offering an in glorification so we're not waiting for the sons of God to come the sons of God have already been here John says now are we the sons of God Paul says now are we the children of God but we're waiting for something we're waiting for our inheritance verse 19 for the expec for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god so all creation is waiting for this unveiling of the sons of God they're not waiting for the sons of God we're waiting for the unveiling or the manifestation of the sons of God verse 22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain birth pains together until now why why are they waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God that would you told us verse 23 and not only and not only they but ourselves also I just want more of the Holy Ghost I just feel me every fiber I want to walk closer to you groaning and travailing what is it it's the soul calling for revelation inspiration not information not knowledge it comes through the womb first it's got to come through the womb but the conception takes but the life takes place down in the heart the soul who has believed our report who has accepted it into the womb of the mind to whom is the arm of the Lord been revealed as inspiration struck that is it a concede life down here or is it only in the womb and then rejected because this is a female ovulate since she's not with a male what is it then her body rejects that but if there's a conception there's no rejection you understand what I'm talking about and then in that rejection because there's no conception before that she can enter into the congregation's you have to go for purification Chindi nothing wrong but if life takes place and no rejection she enters into the congregation verse 23 not only that but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption now what are they waiting for the manifestation the unveiling the revealing of the sons of God in other words they are already here but they haven't come to the fullness of the expression of God creation because only God can create and it's only given to his children to create Satan would like to create if Satan could create there never would have been a Serpent's Eden but because he did not have the power of creation he used the power of injection that he can inject his own life as God was going to do he wanted to have a son and how about having a Sun God injected his own life into the human race this morning and Satan wanted to do the same thing and he had to have a soul because God injects himself into the human race by the new birth in that soul Satan he didn't want a dog he didn't want the serpent he wanted a human soul that he could put his life into but he could not unite with those souls it was in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world that's why some people can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of their life even on their soul but if there's nothing there to quicken he said only in the seed can be quickened that's why when you was out in the trinitarian organizations and and out in the world no matter how much st. Ninoy did that soul it could not bring life but when the Holy Spirit came and anointed it there was a conception and God seal the wound but I'll tell you it was sealed before that because it's God protected sir he protected you he placed the law in you that no seed could penetrate that soul but his own and he put an entity between the woman and the serpent no longer will that seed mix because st. now had an open door the manifestation of the sons of God and we groan and travail as all the creation were waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God were waiting for the adoption to include the change of the body that's what we're waiting for and we know that comes after resurrection and the translation now let's go a little further Ephesians 1 now we're talking about prophecy not what Israel's looking for but what but what the bride is looking for seasons 1 verse 13 and 14 in whom also in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that she believed you know the gospel is a pretty simple thing it's received it's rejected but did you know that the scripture says that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to them that believe not everybody faith cometh by the hearing of the word but not everybody that hears the word has faith and the gospel doesn't save everybody that hears it but him that it's inspired by God that has a heart to perceive and grabbed a hold of it it becomes the power of God unto salvation he were sealed with that holy spirit of promise because it first fruits and here he calls it the earnest of the promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession onto the praise of his glory so now we're sealed onto a to a goal a capstone we're sealing to a destiny until we come and receive our inheritance that's reserved for us in heaven it's incorruptible and where the thief can't come in it was it was through faith that it might be by grace God chose the avenue of faith that it could be by grace you're saved by grace and through faith but he said it was through faith that it could be by grace in other words it's the sovereignty of God to reveal whom to ever so he will he'll give a heart to perceive to whoever so he will but how does he choose how'd he pick you how'd he take you why didn't he take that one well it's just the way the Bible was spun and the way it ended up nor wasn't you were in him he's one of the foundation of the world his children he knew they'd be stolen and so he provided Redemption and he put you in that book of redemption and he predestinated you to make sure that you received your inheritance he didn't leave it to a lawyer he didn't leave it to a preacher he hauls it in himself that you are predestinated to receive your inheritance verse or chapter 4 verse 30 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption we now are redeemed but we're waiting for the fullness of our attention to include the change in this body which is the manifestation or the adoption of the children of God were replaced upon the throne of power and it's no longer that's a it's the Lord all the prophets before Jesus yes saith the Lord all the prophets after Jesus just say at the Lord Jesus didn't say thus saith the Lord he said I tell to you your sins are forgiven there will come a time that your children will stand in the throne but it won't be to throne as a father it'll be the throne of Christ an earthly ministry and they'll have a power creation you potentially have it now the third poll has been identified it's among us but it hasn't come to the fullest of the power of the purpose that have sent for now that I was on the earth per second and pull but the third pull he stepped into the power what he was called to do to call abroad to turn the hearts he could not do that through the restored word first second Pole he could not do it to the massage time first Thessalonians and we know that now we know the path were on 1st Thessalonians 4 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend with heaven not just with a voice but with a shout a shout in other words he's not going to come and say something but a shout to us we could say he hollers something no there it's a shout he comes with a shout and brother answer that's a message together the people he said father sanctify them through thy truth you know what that word sanctify means it means to set apart call them out set them apart father sanctify them through thy word and I were at not that truth is word so how is he going to call him and and and and separate him from the world heard the word all in her divorce wasn't separated but those that was inspired and by faith faith you're separated from the rest of the world in faith you're in another dimension yet in this world Abraham was separated by his faith they admired in me they looked at his strength as prosperity but when he gave us testimony David said I'm for peace but when I opened my mouth their war all right let's go a little further let's go to Hebrews nine he ruled I'm I'm yeah he was 9 verse 24 for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of Christ for the world No for us who's us the children of God those is born again like I said for loozer for Wesley for down through the church ages partial revelation but he was interceding for them why because they had blood applied because they had accepted the gospel and they were walking in the light of the age and for that sin that they had he was interceding for their ignorance but when he comes and the fools of the word comes he cannot go longer intercedes regrets to be caught in the wrong court to be caught in the denomination there will be no appeal for that so now what's happened is the Ministry of intercession that was in Christ down through the church ages what's happened it's coming to the bride through the fullest of the word and now she is interceding to the fullest of the word because this is not the age of ignorance how can he how can you intercede on ignorant when he's opened up the entire word [Applause] cuz of Oh what's the significance of milk isn't it because the high-priest only can go into the holiest of holies and Melchizedek and we are of the order not of Aaron we are of the order of Melchizedek so as Aaron was a high priest and those that in his tribe was part of that Aaronic priesthood we are part of the Melchizedek Priesthood we are kings and priests so we become intercessors we are the victors of Christ on earth he said that's a bad word for the Catholic Church where the true Catholic Church not Roman Catholic Church but the universal body of Christ he said how can we be vicars he said Moses you're going to be gone Pharaoh because I'm going to speak through you and so you're going to become God to him but he never became an object of worship but he was God's mouthpiece in other words he was God's vicar on earth so now where's the Vicar the representative where's God failed where's the last voice to the last generation and ain't going to come up there it's going to come out of here out of you you are the voice of God [Applause] we're the true thicker not to be worshipped but to point people to Christ through the gospel repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins that brings you to a resurrection but now the message of Malachi for the prophecy unveil brings you to a translation so we're preaching the dual message we're preaching to a resurrection and we're preaching to a translation this is the first generation has ever had that message because the Lord Himself descended with that key the key to the translation not the resurrection but the key to the resurrection is the gospel repent me baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and the gift of the Holy Ghost their earnest will be given to you and it's going to seal you the grave won't have power your hell won't have power over you but it's going to see you into that sixth dimension until one day God releases you and you come and pick that glorified body up first and they would remain alive she'll be changed he said we need rapture in faith faith for healing won't do it you can have faith to move mountains and that won't do that it'll take a faith that's born in the heart of the believer it'll have to be a heart to proceed what's he saying so Christ was once offered to bear this verse 28 so Christ was once offered to bear sins of many it didn't say all and on to them that looked for him now for the for him for them for them that looked for him you know what that word means it doesn't mean get up in the morning I don't there's the Sun no wonder if it's going to rain today or you know but it means an eager anticipation those that are eagerly looking for why are they eagerly looking for him because something has been spoken to them that now they are an expectation and they're eagerly looking for him to them will he appear the second time not to everybody but to those that have been made aware that the train is in the block and they've dropped their sandwiches they've left the restaurant and they're getting over to the boarding dog because they've heard the whistle the training haven't seen the train but they know it's on the block because the whistle said it was for those that are eagerly waiting for those that look for him eagerly waiting anticipating shall he appear the second time without sin on the salvation that means not pertaining to sin he's not coming to offer another sacrifice he's coming to claim what he had sacrificed for because that's what Ephesians said he's coming to take possession when boy has left the gate he went to take possession when he came with that book and there he was descending from heaven he'd come to take possession revelation 10 revelation 10 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven prophecy Hebrews 9 prophecy first Thessalonians prophecy st. John 14 prophecy Matthew prophecy but it's all the same prophecy more information on the prophecy emergent shall conceive but his name shall be counsellor Prince of Peace mighty God all night Rose of Sharon half omega lily of the valley more information born in Bethlehem more information same revelation more information more color to the coloring book now the picture is coming together I've seen a little squares I could figure out the ducts and things all but when the color comes in there I don't have to I don't have to try to look now if they're coloring it in more information and another mighty angel another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud y covenant rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as a pillar of fire not corporal coming it's an angelic coming it's the angel of the Lord and angelic visitation this is not a corporal man but it is the Christ coming in it in an angelic visitation not two feet on the earth but it's the same one but in another form and what's he coming to fulfill a covenant what covenant I will return and receive you unto myself and he's coming prophecy and he had in his hand a little book open not the whole book because this isn't to Israel it's not even to the earth it's not to the foolish who's it to the very elect the bride the Lord showed his sin with a little book not for the whole book but the message for the bride to prepare her heart for the second coming of Christ it's her message and the ark the word is coming to his place we're in the belly of John in the bride becoming one the word made flesh watch what it says verse three and he cried with a loud voice what a shout he didn't just speak with a voice he cried with a loud voice I shout the Lord Himself you did sin with a shout and here he's coming and he cried with a loud voice as a lion horse and seven thunders uttered horses the Lord she listened with a shout here comes his angel he cries with a loud voice prophecy world looks forward they got different theologies on them but what if this prophecy like down in Egypt what would happen if this prophecy was fulfilled go over to the Book of Luke look of Luke chapter 24 verse 30 and 31 Luke 24 verse 30 and 31 and it came to pass as he said it meet with him he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him they recognized him their eyes were open they were already open but now they were open to the supernatural like Elijah said Lord let my servant see he said he didn't create the angels he only changed his eyesight to see those angels and cherubs and those chariots all around him and he said wow there's more us than there are them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight verse 44 and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you not a new message but now enlightenment comes with the message inspiration comes he didn't have to bring a new message Deuteronomy he didn't bring a new law these things are the words which I spake on to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures then wouldn't he do the same he's the same yesterday today and forever did he not do it for for Moses did he not do it for Joshua and Caleb and not the rest they were participators in the opening of that prophetic time they drew benefits from the power of that prophetic time but there was something that they lacked they did not recognize the mighty God among them nor his power to deliver so when it came to Katie's marnya they knew the acts of God but not the way of God they knew about the tree of life but not the way of the Tree of Life the way of God the way of Christ Christ revealed and he is prophecy revealed or maintenance [Music] let me tell you this real quick I don't want to drag this out real quick job 32 [Music] is a little bit warm in here is it just me it's a little bit warm some say yeah I'm something no in my church we got those that's going and then right next to and we got the one with the shawl it just felt a little stuffy more than it is just just cold or warm job 32 verse 7 I said they should speak and multitude of years to teach wisdom but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth him understanding great men are not always wise neither to understand judgment now they were trying to discern something here what was going on in a spiritual rim and trying to equate it with natural events but they could not come to a discernment to know what it was so they just accused him anyway but now here comes Elly you and he said why I thought two people been in the message the longest they would know these things or maybe the great and the important men the top 10 but not always the top ten knows these things remember wisdom wisdom has to do with the inspiration of the Word of God because Paul says I preach the wisdom of God had the princes of this world had this wisdom they wouldn't have killed me here's understanding here's wisdom let him that have understanding count the number the Beast wisdom has to do with spiritual inspiration he said I thought I thought these people had been reading their Bibles all our life well this man's been in the message for 40 years I just come in 10 years but then the flip side is that well that old fogey you've been in this message all along and I know more than him we're not talking about men start talking about ability we're talking about the inspiration of the almighty giveth him understanding you know what that word in my Bible says inspiration means breath the breath of God brings life he breathed into Adam he became a living soul he said oh man son of man prophesy Knievel's live ISA down knows he said prophesy lets new let's wish let it come upon them and then call the winds to come and let it breathe and that word breathing means breath of life then he goes on down he says son of man this is Israel and I will cause her first renew our bone to come to bone and sinew and flesh and I will call breath to come into her and then he says and I will put my spirit in her breath of life to know to have wisdom 144,000 - prophets what do they do they bring him out of Jewish traditions out of the law of Moses and bring them to the gospel and he breathed in them the both alive I put my spirit in them it finishes the drag racing and sin and then they recognize him they accept him and they're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and he puts his life in them and seals him in the forehead with the name of their God Lord Jesus Christ and then he comes and I said who are you Wow where do you get those scars how's my friends and only recognize I wonder if he's gonna do it again he did it on the day of Pentecost didn't it he stood there Jehovah God and he breathed on to the disciples and said receive you the Holy Ghost receive you eternal life the breath of life the life to give you the mind of Christ to know a heart to perceive and on the day of Pentecost there is a rushing mighty wind and it's Hill the house where they were out and pillars of fire came down and the prophet said he's gonna do it again in the evening time the same pouring out of his spirit is gonna happen in the evening time but he said what they thought on the Xu's the street was that original outpouring he said it wasn't then what is it how do you know what it is if you don't know what happened on the day of Pentecost how are you gonna know if it's fulfilled of anything how are you gonna know if you got the Holy Ghost if you don't know who he is and how he acts and what is to do you don't know the purpose of the Holy Ghost you'll never know if you got him he has to be identified in his characteristics so what happened on the day of Pentecost there was a change of dispensations glad was changing as he morphe glad was changing from Son of Man the Son of God that's what happened on the day of Pentecost and it had the effect on them and they came out they said this is what Joel said prophecy revealed identified they know they didn't know what those thunders what they didn't know what the promise of the Father was they just knew the thunders they just knew what the promise of God was it was coming and when the promise come they were filled with the Holy Ghost and when the thunders come we either bribed we tried gods either called a bride or ain't called a bride either got the Holy Ghost you don't have the Holy Ghost and those that you got to hold a ghost st. want you to believe you ain't got the Holy Ghost where you go seeking another spirit seven thunders he said it'll take those seven thunders to call the bride either we're called and we're not called yeah but I don't know what those certain well it doesn't make a difference but it does it doesn't make a difference in effect because it was sent to the scene but it does for you to know where you stand so you're not insecure that you're like Christ you know where you come from you know who you are you know what God has done and you know you're part of what he has done now you stand in the enemy it challenges you let him challenge you I know where I come from and I know where I'm going hell where's the power to hold me grave where's the power to hold me you can put a seal on it but all the seals of Satan and all the seals of the denomination's can't hold me in that grave because it couldn't hold him so Israel received the breath of life and we're to have another outpouring what it's going to be there's going to have to be a crucifixion or a rejection and that's the rejection of the Son of God they didn't reject the Son of Man they rejected to my understanding the way I look at it that it came to this the capstone of the demonstration of the Holy Spirit by them aside son the sign of Jesus Christ among us discern in the heart well your name is your addresses reason why you're here before you left the house your husband said pray if you get in the prayer line I haven't prayed for me he was in the doctor's office 20 years ago and the doctor looked at you and said you got cancer he was wearing a great suit you had a pink dress on and this is what he said this is what you said and the nurse walked in and this is what she said this what happened made on the hook so what was it that was to waking us he said it was a third pool so there had to come a crucifixion there had to come a rejection so there was a crucifixion and a rejection he always turns back to the time that where those those ministers had come to trap him he always points back to that when Peter where did Peter point he pointed back to Calvary but there had already been a resurrection and there already been a new dispensation but now he's packed pointing back to the old to say this is why the new came because now he was crucified to son of man but he's returned in a resurrection i quickened in power as the son of God he said the same thing is going to happen in the evening time my spirit I'm gonna breathe into a group of people actually only my children and as I breathed in the atom as I breathe into Israel I'll breathe into her the breath of life just as I did on the day of Pentecost so a prophet comes and he preaches the seals and he starts out with God in simplicity it's at all what's the trouble with man he's always looking for the great things that God is going to do and he points back to how that God did things in such a simplicity but he doesn't recognize when it comes right around him why because there were sea urchins and Pentecostals and they had preconceived ideas of what was going to happen when these seals was preached it's like I said but when I got baptized I thought when I came out of the water here is gonna be angelic beings that old son was going to be glimmering all this I went down I come up and I said what happened but something that happened in here but I was looking out here for some time and they come out and I said ha I knew that I thought we was going to really get something he said now be careful who's believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord now who's believed our report who has God inspired to believe the voice of the shepherd that it might allow him to have the authority to step into the court and become a son of God not born a man not born a clergy not born of a church but born of God not flesh not the will a man but God that shows mercy to whom that I reveal myself we got we ain't got time for all this and I know that that brother lushes probably but I just want to go over a couple things and I'm not really prepared for this because now we know in God in simplicity he says never dawned on me to something till long late we hours last night in prayer I began to see something now you can follow these quotes all the way down through the message now if you're wide awake you'll see something see I hope I don't have to hold it in my hand to show you and then it and then it begins to talk about the constellation of angels he was troubled by that he preserves this is the time is this the time service but that thing is still troubling him he goes that the Arizona in it that thing just won't leave him it's troubling him so he goes up in the mountain and this is why he goes up in the mountain he wants the axle or what is this constellation of angel what's this all about so he goes that there's his lord what is this all about what's this constellation agent what what's this vision what's it mean as a sword he said that's the king so what was that it was an answer to the question of what the constellation of Angels was he said that's the Kings sword he said don't be afraid of it that's a third pool so the sword the constellation angels he's telling us it's only the interpretation of what the constellation of Angels was and so then he comes and he's caught up into that constellation that actually materializes and so he's going over this in the breach because he's trying to point the people to something the third pole of his ministry the third pull of john's ministry behold the lamb of god that was his third pole because he stepped into what he was called to do mother brown's third pole was what to turn the hearts of the children back he said he could only do that through those seven thunders which he said is he opening another word so now he's in here and he's preaching and he's coming down through these seals our Heavenly Father here comes the great night this is the seventh seal the great hour that went great when when a great thing has happened not going to happen he said have happened it's been all around the people and father I pray that tonight that will be made known beyond a shadow of a doubt to the people's hearts and mind our heart to perceive prophecy being fulfilled to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed the power of God that you can stand on the day of Katy smart here that you can stand on the banks of Moab looking at Jordan but not looking at the worldly Church they're looking at the inheritance keeping your eyes on Christ nothing's loophole lawyers that call himself teachers we ain't looking for no loophole lawyer we're looking for Christ [Applause] chat up a debt the people's hearts and mind that they know that God is still in the on the throne and that he still loves his people and it's the hour the hour that it that the world is longed to see it's now approaching for it cries for redemption what is it the whole world groans and travails it's time for redemption he says the hours come all that they can recognize it [Music] now why let us prove it why it is the secret that no one knows about Daniel saw and he's that seal up the vision Daniel he said Daniel heard the same thing that John her seal it up he said it's the secret it's the mystery that no man knows not even Christ not even the Angels what could it be the time of his appearing it's a secret that no one knows about John was forbidden to write about it even even write a symbol about it why why this is why there was no activity in heaven it might give away the secrets you see it's so it's so great it must mean it must be included because it's got to happen but when the seven thunders seen one Thunder and he really emphasizes his first seal and this one thunder and then he alludes back to that blast in those seven angels one blast he says one thunder seven seals seven thunders so he's trying to ties in with this constellation and this sword and with this first seal offender he's tying the two together [Applause] [Music] what secret Matthew 24:36 forbidden the right what the seven thunders seven thunders a second coming to Christ these are these are my notes seven got perfect number seven just write down a roll seven thunders uttered or uttered straight together like they were spelling out something notice at that time John started right he said don't write it Jesus never spoke of it John couldn't write it angel didn't know nothing he's telling us that what what these seven thunders are that they couldn't write is the same thing that Jesus couldn't tell him the day in the hour he said no man knows I don't know no angel only my father knows but now this mystery is being revealed it's not being talked listen when Moses come down it wasn't being talked the prophecy was unfolding he tried to point them to the prophecy but they wouldn't hurt him because they had preconceived ideas oh they were they they heard the message they knew the acts of God but they erred they went astray in their hearts because they didn't know the way of God they didn't have an intimate relationship they didn't have a heart to perceive they didn't have the breath of life breathed into them that's one thing jesus said even in angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it he didn't know it himself that only God would know it but he told us when we begin to see these signs coming now you're getting somewhere alright notice we can see these signs coming this thing could get a hold of it and he goes on down I'm just trying to pick these things out and it's hard for me because when you get up here you go blind you'd be looking for a note to be right friend can't find it and you get back in the study so whatever it is it was there all the time I'm just trying to he talks about the constellation he says so he says now now I don't know what I don't know the next step here this is where actually the tape stopped and and then he has a record but now they've picked it back up now I don't know what I know the next step I know the next step there but I don't know what how to interpret that it won't be long I've got it wrote down here when it happened if you see here stop go no further that's right here now I'm not prone to be a fanatic I'm just I'm just telling the truth but you remember the little shoe now he's going back to what the tenth vision the little shoe you're gonna find that all these things is one again the little shoe the tenth the seventh seal all these things he talks about the dream that that Jackson had where he went west took the trip to cap off the pyramid he talks about it no riding in there angel didn't know what was that it was the coming of Christ to receive his bride prophecy David said send thy light and truth God of my strength he breathed into him to give him strength daniel said he put strength in me how by revealing the prophecy but you remember the little shoe that I always tried to explain how that that soul laid next to so-and-so in the inter conscience and all that kind of stuff which it only made a big bunch of impersonations started that start after it now you'd have to take up the hand now huh now how you'd have to take up the hand and and hold the people and have vibration everybody had vibration in her hand but remember when he took me up there and said this is the third poem no one will know it do you remember that visions never fail they're perfectly true notice remember the vision of the constellation Charlie I hear you are something going on I told you this week that you I've been all around its men all around you but I wonder if you noticed it remember the constellation of the vision of angels when I left here to go to Arizona you remember what time is it sir do you remember the dream the pyramid cap going west notice there was only one great burst of thunder seven angels appeared that right one burst of thunder seven angels appeared one Thunder first sealed one Thunder constellation see he's trying to tie all these things together and he says this thing's been going on around here he stands in one place and he says he said this is what you've been looking at so what does st. an attacking the cloud but it's not the cloud it's Christ a heart to perceive they can't know the acts of God everything was open and they seals they're looking for a tent he said this is a fulfillment he said that's what you've been looking at shut-in with God in a secret place it's to give you strength to what Satan tried to do he's trying to take away your immune system he's trying to take away your breath he's trying to take away your food he wants to starve you to death you don't need to go to church you don't need a pass through all those brothers and sisters they don't understand and you know I'm a farmer they're city people we don't get along do get it anyway you know what Paul said said you're sick you're spiritually sick for something long Satan has gotten into your life and he's trying to separate you from the body and he wouldn't he does that he you're gonna die you're gonna die spiritually you don't need a hierarchical system here you need God's system to bring it to perfection listen you can try all you want to give him the preeminence the only way he's going to have the preeminence in your life is by inspiration of the revelation of the prophecy and when that's revealed to you the word takes preeminence and when it takes preeminence to brings you to perfection he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a Prophet's reward what is it it's righteousness can you see where we're at but we're waiting for the dynamics to strike the mechanics so we're just gonna keep we're gonna keep walking with him in the light of this word he's gonna reveal it to you little by little anything that you have need of you need some spinach he's going to give it to you you need celery he's going to give it to you you need meat he's going to give it to you but it's not going to come in different forms it's going to come in the manner because everything you have need of is in the manner and that man is going to come out of the Bible how this message all these people these paranoid fantasy thinking people trying to discern the people all this old cloud that was a missile and had nothing to do with it and he made these mistakes he did that he did that and nothing but an AIDS virus in a different form on the people to neutralize to neutralize your immune system the Holy Spirit and the word it takes the Holy Spirit and the word we're alone ain't gonna do it but it'll take this word and the Holy Spirit at the entrance of thy word at the entrance not at the approach not to look at it not to hold it but at the entrance to eat the book at the entrance of thy word by the Holy Spirit it brings light walk in the light as he is life open their eyes of their heart Lord open my eyes open my understanding that when I opened the scriptures when I listened to the preaching when I look at the message open my understanding that I can understand because I'm your child and this this message is Bible there's my inheritance because the secret things belong to God and he revealeth at them to his children that they might fully obey his word his Commandments so he reveals it to us not to obey the voice of brother Branham don't wear pants sisters well that's part of it but why was Cornelius baptized to fulfill all righteousness if you're seeing what the Holy Ghost you can go out where all the pants you want to instill go in the rapture you know but he said you seal them to the day of your Redemption that's an unconditional covenant now you take a sister that she says well I can't wear pants because I know the word and the message says don't wear pants and if I wear pants I know one thing for sure I'm gonna I'm going to either go to hell or I can't go on the rapture so I'm gonna quit wearing pants you never quit wearing pants but now if you found out you could wear pants and still go on the rapture and choose not to wear pants now you quit wearing pants my son he had a nervous condition and and it's just nervous and anxious and sometimes he'd get in situations and when he try to eat the throat would would tighten up and it couldn't he couldn't swallow just nerves you know and and so he was taking the doctor giving him some valium so he got into this well now if I take medicine I haven't got any faith you know and I'm gonna show God I got faith daddy if I if I take that that sin I said mark if you take that that's not sin he said you gotta have faith okay dump them in the toilet okay now I got faith walks out of the house he says oh I better go get another prescription as I said mark that's not sin just take him if you need them we're not talking about abusing them just take him as you need it and then pray God for deliverance so he comes up maybe a month later he said daddy he said I just got a revelation I said what's that he said I can take those values and it ain't sin I said now you don't bend the toilet you understand he's working out on a job and I found out he's a Christian and because of the way that he structured he just tries to do everything so right and you know when you work out in construction that's basically with the government they got all these rules and regulations and Lord if you followed every rule and regulation you wouldn't be able to do nothing so here's Mark trying to follow every rule in every resident regulation and when he does you know you get a little cut he's working out there's a new killer pen he a little cut you got to report it you know that's what they do on the video right so he gets a little cut he goes and reports that everybody makes fun of him he just trying to do everything just it's right so he comes to me he's a daddy I'm quitting I'm moving out to New Mexico I've been I've instilled that in her heart that's where utopia is they all love it they are all born in Carolina or Georgia but they but they love it anyway so I've transferred that vision into their heart they said I'm gonna quit I'm gonna go to New Mexico go to work I said why you quit these people are just making fun of me and I just I just can't take it anymore now I'm quittin I said well Mart I said if you quit and go out there you're gonna face the same thing yeah I said I'll tell you what you do you work out there and you pray until that doesn't bother you anymore and when it comes to the time I don't bother you anymore quit you understand the principle we're not doing these things to be righteous or to go to heaven or be bribed we're doing it because we are bribed Jesus didn't need to be baptized but he did it to fulfill all righteousness the word because the sacrifice had to be washed the high priest had to be washed by the Prophet he said but to fulfill but the church watch him go down whoa you know the comforters he's got some sin he's going down there to get baptized you know he didn't even need to get baptized but he wasn't we didn't go down there it's like now Church I already been baptized in the titles I'm already saved the only reason why I'm getting baptized because the message says I got to and he wasn't trying to explain nothing because he didn't have any insecurities he knew who he was he knew why he was going down there and he didn't have to explain it to nobody he didn't have to apologize from nothing John being a province that I have need to be baptized v's and that's true but to fulfill to fulfill the work to fulfill all righteousness why do you live the way you are because of who you are because prophecy revealed inspired in the heart brings preeminence of the word the life of Christ anew that brings you to perfection not going out here not making no mistakes he don't need a man with no eraser because that's a man that doesn't need any blood some mark he tries not to make any mistakes and I said and I don't mean to say this this mark is a good boy he does her sound and I told him I said the things that you suffer you had to suffer because you are God's gift to me because when I came in this message I came in it at the college level you nursing I'm saying Seals Church ages but I was an atheist and I didn't know nothing about justification I didn't know nothing about sanctification and so I wasn't intimidated to preach to a crowd like this I thought I knew something but they didn't know nothing man that thinks he knows something then he looks out on people that don't know as much as he knows but when a man knows that he knows nothing then he looks up to other people because he knows it's Christ and so I was intimidated by going down into South America into the Amazon I thought well what do you do if you come to a person that's never seen a Bible they have never heard the name of Jesus Christ now you know you just think about this in your mind this person has nothing to know about the gospel just a raw even now you're going to bring them the salvation that's intimidating to me what are you going to relate to at least have they've been vag alized by the Catholic Church so you know about Jesus they know about the Bible they know about God they know something so you got certain to start with but if you don't know nothing but just an idol just a just a fire how you gonna relate to him and so and so God allowed my son to be in this condition and here by your same old thing would come up well I'm a son of God no I mean Jesus I have something I'm saying I'm not non well I it forced me to dig into this word to try to help my son I said mark you've had to suffer this in your life that God can use it to bring my ministry to a place that I can help people you had to suffer but if I didn't love my son it wouldn't have done a bit of good I said I haven't told you all I know usually I can get somebody else to help you but because I loved me it made me reach down into righteousness and justification sometimes God allows things into our lives and we may look at somebody and because we don't have the love for them to dig down into Christ to find what it would take to help them we can come no further in him is we by our heads Heavenly Father lord I thank you for this people I thank you for salvation and the Holy Spirit I thank you for my my children and my wife prayed it to be within the day Lord and they've suffered many things Lord because of man for me Lord that I might in turn what I've gained and benefited from their suffering Lord did I might do something to help them what we must suffer with you very people that you as crucified very soldiers that hated you was the very ones that you are dying for Lord teach this teach us to live teach us to care teach us to pray all God may we allow you to have a freedom in our lives may you bless this people for their patience and Lord for their long-suffering you know in the Lord in these services and Lord I've probably done very little trying to use very much but God you can take one word one thought our wall is to one individual and you can open up the fountain of life in their heart go out you can do much with little your create all Holy Spirit breathe upon your people breathe upon me open the eyes of our heart Lord and we might see thee father I ask it in the precious name that I son Jesus Christ amen brother lush if you come god bless you my brother amen the Lord bless you I trust that we have heard the word with the understanding that it is not a man intellectually expounding what's written in this book but it was God Himself a man he was the Lord Himself assigned the prophecies of this book it was the Lord Himself teaching us to what is to bring preeminence in our hearts to what's written in the book to give us understanding to bring us to perfection by the grace of God so I trusted we have not put the emphasis on our brother monk all jig today but we put the emphasis on Jesus amen but thanking God for our brother thanking God for the ministry and again he is sitting in the church for the perfecting of the Saints and for them and for what it is to expound and to do that you have to expound the prophecy you got to be taught to give preeminence to the prophecy to bring us to perfection by the grace of God so it's there for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the unity of the body of Christ to mature us by the grace of God so were not tossed about with every wind of doctrine a man because this is an hour when they wind it when we're when we are experiencing every wind of doctrine all around us but brother Dwight I trust you've heard the word and then it god has put it in your heart forever settled in your heart so that you're not gonna be tossed around you know where you're standing Amen you know what you believe please I beg of you in the name of the Lord receive the word of the Lord a man not just another sermon not just another thought not just another idea but it is God Himself getting us established in the present truth a man as her brother was ministering on the prophecy on preeminence and on perfection in order to come to perfection you've got to give preeminence to the prophecy a man by the grace of God and to do that you've got you've got a you've got a starter a baby see you got to repent you got to be baptized you got and God has got to recognize your faith they give you the Holy Ghost save man the bottle God said the first two steps are yours he says the third one is gods but he said God's not going to give you the Holy Ghost unless he recognizes your faith amen honest he deserves it receives your faith and he gives you the Holy Ghost and I need the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost and amen what for because he's a certain teen of God to take us on into the deeper things of God higher heed to the things of God on to perfection by the grace of God amen so if it's the Holy Ghost I've been moving again today the Holy Ghost in the ministry and it's the Holy Ghost in the believer the Alleluia it's the Holy Ghost in the ministry giving the word it is the Holy Ghost in the belabour receiving the word a man believing the word acting on the word point out and manifesting the word hallelujah you said the word he is made flashing you by the grace of God bringing us into a oneness with the word Amen right front and again not let us I appreciated what he ministered nominee was here before and it's bad I'll never forget that the justification and inside he product the revelation that it is past tense paper hand and I said well that's wonderful oh we are justified we are sanctified we are filled with the Holy Ghost in and again he brought it he expounded it in this this series concerning predestination it was God God predestinated by in store knowledge to you to me and remember the Bible says that in the in the mind of God is all finished in the mind of God is all over with but he's got it he's got this ministry here brother man he's got the other ministries to bring us into the reality of it how do you know yet so that it's not just words in a book it is reality in our souls a man by the grace of God and I trust that those that heard those that message of those messages that you'll never forget it this is where our faith is established that is finished amen Christ was finished in the mind of God he was finished the grace of God justified amen I are not going looking for justification I'm justified and I'm going to work for sanctification I'm sanctified I'm not gonna work for this because there's already am I in the mind of God how do I know you what God is asking us to do you bring the Ministry and you lay it out in here lay it out well for honey the sons and daughters of God you're receiving it well praise the Lord that's who I am oh thank you mrs. bill what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God and we can quick and cry fathers this abba father father father father father and as I preached her a while ago we got our memories back maybe maybe with Jesus of how the God said jesus knew who he was he knew where he come from he knew why he was here knew where he was going hey man that's why he said I got power to lay my life down and power to pick it up again hey man but why because they brother father said he never bypasses theophany he said you and I by pastor at the hominy because of seeing and so God had a plan to bring us to bring our memories back hallelujah I Know Who I am I know where I come from I know why I'm here I know where I'm going amen and I recognize that I recognize that what we've heard preached in these last three services and then it was the word it was God speaking to his sons and daughters it was God giving us the greater faith and more faith and more faith of more feet and onto a order under what the pop of the gods have we got to come to and that is perfect faith amen perfect faith these have we got to come to this rub up the make-believe and he needs to see we come to this perfect faith to believe for the change of our bodies to believe Who I am where are you where I'm going by the grace of God so we got our memories back hallelujah so God was bringing again to our remembrance the Word of God oh yeah I know what you're talking about praise the Lord Amen I know it Lord that's that's that's on the inside of the inside it's in my soul praise the name of the Lord so brother I pray grace grace then we're understanding the prophecy giving preeminence of the prophecy being perfected by the word amen by receiving the word into our souls by the grace of Almighty God amen thank God for our brother Mike and thank God with the Ministry of the word thank God for taking us on higher in the Lord Brenna's and listen Saints it comes to a place it's the end of the road we say in the middle of the road but then it comes to the place you got to keep your eyes right there because that's the end of the road and we're gonna and there's a change coming amen brother it's nothing that never saw in Luther's day Wesley's day and but yet they were seeing more of it in the Pentecostal age but they refused the further revelation of it of how to get from here to eternity remember Pentecost believed that they were for running the second coming of Christ but they refused the messenger that was to introduce Christ so the grace of God to us thank God for the prophecy thank God for the for the power and anointing of the Holy Ghost in the ministry to leading us to get preeminence to the prophecy taking us on to perfection by the Word of God be perfect even as your father Nevin is perfect man oh well no no no no no I don't live that kind of life they've got nothing to do with that old flesh URI you know what it is be perfect be mature as your father in heaven is mature hey man in the word believe in the word amen and yet people that lead people ministries lead people to think oh you're not you can't you you won't make no mistakes you won't do this and do that and you know you're marina you're in a sinful body it's like we heard a preacher preach one time and he said you know he said people go there and preach and he said they tasted like he said God got you hanging over hell by your thread and the first mistake you make God cut to threaten your guy that's not the word thank God that there's grapes or that friend there's a revelation of Jesus Christ that's red that's what hose was a man that's where those all of his children all of us elect is his sons and daughters praise the name of the Lord when you and David and our brother brought out a number of it a number of these things and one day we went out and did what he did God didn't cut this right hey mad because ain't mad because they went back before the foundation of the world the lands the foundation of the world hey man good God knew that why in this lecture we will need it amen predict all praise God praise God brother forever settled in heaven guaranteed guaranteed by the grace of God listen her brother talked about prophecy and the monomers notice that he is in his message he mentioned Katie's party a number of times the judgment seat well the ground priests not it okay Katie's friend Ian we are at Katie's friend Ian amen and the you not only that you're in God's judgment all mother wrap said you come in here to be judged by the word a man judge by the word to his Katie's Barnea brother and God it moves them right over here but then the world goes on into judgment a man god it's is the Austrian judgment on the world and the church is like our brother asked brother branham somewhere in the state somewhere he said brother Brad what do you see in the future for the church and he said brother he say after 1977 I see nothing but total darkness after 1977 we don't have time to get into those things but brother you've heard enough of the word to know what God has done and what God is doing and what God's going to do we're another the word to know that we're in the end amen and it's the us reading of the final elected predestinated seat such as our sister Justine and it's the ushering in of judgment on the world amen this lookup I like it he mentioned about looking up how people are are looking for the coming and so on good that that brings out that picture we have out there says how are you looking for the rapture hey man I wonder how many of us thought about that when our brother mentioned that how are you looking for the rapture what's in the picture most of us have seen it so those are you not seeing it there's two brothers and one what is looking at the window with a pair of binoculars looking for the rapture looking for the coming of the Lord and the other brother is sitting in his chair with his Bible he was looking for the coming of the Lord the rapture hey man and God was bringing more and more of that revelation to us through our brother Mike these last three services amen I trust you're getting the revelation that's upon us look up lift up your heads of understanding a man by the grace of God and see what the world does not see a man to the world it's all a mystery to some believers it's all fake but to the bride this prophecy fulfilled and because the bright recognizes as thus saith the Lord it is the word full-fare but bride is gonna give preeminence man to the voice Atlanta our brother brought out the shout a man their Brides given Prima's to that and that takes rod to absolute perfection and the change of our bodies this Billy yeah by the grace of God brother you know if this was a spice ship or whatever then that's my ship but a spaceship whatever I said well I said it I said told one brother I said well I said I said God God can use the spaceship I said - I said to reveal himself he could use anything well we know we believe that it was the angels of God a man that had come down and so on and so forth and and the pillar of fire and again the altar of fire amazing the spaceship was this any man this come from eternity it wasn't in time it came from be turns the power of God sir where did where did they come from he said eternity he said where did they go he said they went to return hallelujah praise them it's tremendous it's wonderful our brother was talking about the AIDS virus and what was coming to my mind was what the Prophet said concerning the germ warfare we better recognize the prophecy God preeminence and that perfect faith our brother George the sister Rebekah did an article on it some years ago in there believers international magazine concerning the germ warfare and they said it's not the new virus new viruses and so on because you're gonna have to worry about that's what Satan is using why to make way for the old viruses to come back amen so your body won't be able to fight it off because of the AIDS virus your body won't be able to fight off so as you watch you watch the increase of the old the old diseases that that man fought and then used antibiotics for and he was right but the antibiotics were they had so many number of them maybe eight or nine or ten or twelve of them now they're down to two or three that really really worked and it's getting less and less and less but the problem of God said there's coming a germ warfare upon the earth about all without the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the only inoculation it's gonna work [Music] who are you gonna believe man or God we better know the our were living all the vitamins in the world is not going to work all the good food in the world is not going to work not just the Holy Ghost eMac hey man it's like that Ezekiel 9 bread nice this funny that don't sound right to me and people think because oh that's Ezekiel 9s Bible oh that's good bread and I said no I got a funny spirit about it [Music] and I went back nice read the scripture and I said yellow that's right that's right [Music] and just because it's Bible you'll find millions of Christians of walking by but stop and consider what was in it all those in it was only two good things wheat and barley all the rest was animal food let's head to the animals they just think God wanted him God wanted him to cook it bake it I'm with human John but you gotta cut it you gotta stop and consider and the rest of it was it was animal food you got to stop and consider why God told is equal to do it do to consider what Ezekiel was doing he was promising he was outside the gates he was lying on one side for so many days ain't on the other side were so many days and so he was probably saying even the lady Israel know what was coming the Jews know what was sorry if they didn't line up with the word they were going to get the best bread in the world they're gonna get the worst now they got this sort of Bible product and that by-product they're just desperate to make money it's not your health they're interested in it's your money so don't go by that stuff there's a type of the judgment of God amen so remember that no don't don't get deceived or fooled by it there's many many men musters must bet deception up there when it comes to religion should I pray the grace of God help us so brother just make sure you got the spirit of the word that was preached this morning make sure you got the Holy Ghost that's the inoculation the only inoculation is going to work in the last days you stop you go before the Lord and go into his judgment all see Lord do I have the Holy Ghost have you inoculated me against sin the world the flesh the devil we need that inoculation don't be deceived by the foolishness is out there let's say he is the god of this world and our brother did make mention of it that he is even worshipped as God the scripture says in the temple of God being worshipped as God make sure you're worshiping Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ amen so god bless our brother Mike Rock continue to bless his ministry God continue to use it to build up the body in the most holy faith [Music] I'm just gonna read a few verses that I did mention to our brother last night to come to the brethren [Applause] and it's in Psalms 106 and our brother started with praise ye the Lord it's good o give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever he said in verse 3 blessed are they that keep good that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times remember me Oh Lord with the favor that thou bear'st unto thy people or visit me with I salvation that I may see the good of thy chosen that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that I make glory with thine inheritance for Israel for us as being part of the bride we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly our fathers understood not they wonders in Egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the Red Sea even at the Red Sea nevertheless he saved them for his namesake that he might make his mighty power to be known God has her predestinated purpose again our brother brought it out in the life of his son and the effect that would have in him and his relationship with the Lord but he said they say them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known and he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that aided them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy and the waters covered their enemies and there was not one of them left then believe these words they sang his praise but notice verse 13 this is what happened out through the ages in the denominations the prophet of God said all messengers lived to see the decline of their own message in the beginning of their messages their ministries as says they believed his words they sing his praise but then they soon forgot his works and they waited not for his counsel they did what was right in their own eyes and they waited not for his counsel and now we're witnessing the same around the message amen but they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert and he gave them their requests but said leanness into their soul because they were desiring natural things not spiritual it says verse 21 they forgot God their Savior which had done great things in Egypt therefore it said he would destroy them and not Moses as chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them but he did destroy them eventually they came to that hour at that time the Bible says again [Applause] I will therefore put you in remembrance though he once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not amen that is God's pattern that is God's way grace to us brother that were numbered with those Joshua and Caleb that go in to possess the land not with those that are destroyed a man by the world and the things of the world god bless you let's take a man [Music]

God is heading to it God is bringing it all to perfection so we we need the revelation of justification st. the vacation the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts are the spirit and God crowns at all with the revealed word to give us rap freeing faith the prophet of God said I have no message like Luther like mastered like Pentecost he said my ministry is ordained son of God he said to take it all and tie it together to show us the mystery of God to reveal the mystery of God to give us a faintly need for the resurrection and the rapture he said what I ministering on they have touched on and touched on and touched on down through the ages but now God's going to explain explain it and God's going to expound it and God's gonna tie it all together so that now we look back and we understand the plan of God and the pattern of God down through the ages now we know that it's the Lord not just another move not just another revival but it's God finishing his plan according day's pattern Amen
