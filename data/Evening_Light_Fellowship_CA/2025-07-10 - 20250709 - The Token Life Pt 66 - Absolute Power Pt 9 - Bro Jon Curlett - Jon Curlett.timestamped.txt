[38:59] Lord Jesus.
[39:01] Lord, that we have a place of rest this
[39:03] evening.
[39:06] Lord, that when all comes falling down
[39:08] around our ears,
[39:10] everything seems out of control,
[39:13] Lord. When our strength fails, our will
[39:15] fails, our discipline goes away. Lord,
[39:18] when we can see no way through, Lord, we
[39:20] can trust in you, Lord. the everpresent
[39:23] one, the great I am, the mighty
[39:25] conqueror,
[39:26] our deliverer, our shield, our buckler,
[39:30] Lord, our helmet, our sword.
[39:33] Lord, you are our everything. You all
[39:35] are. You are all that we have need of
[39:37] this evening, heavenly father. Lord, how
[39:39] we thank you for it, Lord. Pray that you
[39:42] would just take this service once again,
[39:43] Lord. We give it into your hands, Lord.
[39:46] Not seeking to control or constrain or
[39:48] conform, Lord, but to just let your
[39:51] spirit have liberty this evening to
[39:52] speak into our lives, each one, Lord. We
[39:55] give it into your hands, trusting you in
[39:57] all these things. In Jesus Christ's name
[40:00] we pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[40:03] Turn if you would to Colossians chapter
[40:05] 1. Appreciate that with the musicians.
[40:08] Amen. You can see we've got some changes
[40:10] that have been happening over time and
[40:13] you've seen brother Joe's been up here
[40:15] song leading now for the last few months
[40:17] and then sister Priscilla taking the
[40:19] service and so what we're seeing here is
[40:21] a slow transition and just just to make
[40:24] it clear to the church that these are
[40:26] these transitions have come up because
[40:28] the musician and the song leader have
[40:30] come to me. I haven't come to Sister
[40:32] Moren and said Moren that's it. We've
[40:34] had enough of all your mistakes.
[40:39] We've recognized them as much as you do
[40:40] now and it's too many. We haven't said
[40:42] that. And brother Bob, I haven't gone to
[40:44] them and said, "Brother Bob, you're just
[40:46] too old. You serve too long." They
[40:50] haven't done anything like that. They
[40:51] have come to me and they have said,
[40:52] "Brother John, I'm ready to start laying
[40:54] some things down." And so, we want to
[40:55] respect them. We want to honor them.
[40:58] We want to thank you both.
[41:00] You're not gone yet,
[41:02] but we thank you.
[41:04] It's very special to see 43, sorry, 40
[41:09] 40 45 years from brother Bob and 12
[41:12] years of Sister Moren. Maybe not so
[41:15] grand, but it's been grand. Amen. And
[41:17] Sister Moren certainly has has done more
[41:19] than just play the piano. She's had a
[41:21] real spirit of worship as well, and we
[41:23] know that. But I thank you both from the
[41:24] bottom of my heart. You're not done.
[41:26] You're not gone. And we're not pushing
[41:27] you out. But we just want to recognize
[41:28] them as we see this transition
[41:30] happening. how much we appreciate them
[41:32] and their spouses that have helped us
[41:34] support. Brother Mark sitting back there
[41:36] by himself so lonely and afraid so many
[41:38] times and and she's not there to help
[41:40] them and sister Brenda sitting there
[41:41] alone many times and you know it's it's
[41:43] a it's a time that's lost. It takes time
[41:46] to study. It takes time to pray and
[41:48] practice and all these things. So
[41:50] there's a real sacrifice that goes with
[41:51] that. So, God bless you both in that.
[41:53] And God bless Brother Joe and Sister
[41:55] Priscilla as they transition into this.
[41:58] And and with all things, they are not
[42:00] tied to it. We do not hold them to it.
[42:02] It is of their own free will that they
[42:03] do it. And we're trusting the Lord to
[42:05] bless it. And if somehow God would
[42:07] provide us with another one. I know
[42:08] Brother Joe would perhaps love to go
[42:10] back to the base. And maybe Sister
[42:11] Priscil would love to sit back there and
[42:13] just be able to raise those big hands of
[42:15] those big long arms of hers and just
[42:16] praise the Lord as she would desire. But
[42:18] we'll see what the Lord would have. But
[42:20] for now, that's the way it's
[42:21] transitioning. And so, we trust the Lord
[42:23] in that. But that's not the end. If the
[42:24] Lord would Terry, we've got other
[42:26] musicians coming up behind him. We've
[42:27] got Sister Elsa on the strings, and
[42:29] we've got Levi on the guitar, and Jensen
[42:31] on the guitar, and we've got Sister
[42:32] Lydia, not to well, she's ahead really,
[42:34] I guess, on the on the piano, and these
[42:36] different things, and and Gabriel on the
[42:38] drums, if we could ever get up courage
[42:39] to have drums in the church. We have
[42:42] people coming and the Lord provides as
[42:45] we have need of. So, we're trusting that
[42:46] he has met the need we have now. And
[42:48] we'll see what he would have as we move
[42:50] into the future. Amen. We want him, we
[42:52] want the spirit of God to have freedom
[42:54] here, the Holy Spirit to have freedom in
[42:56] the church. And he places in the body
[42:58] those that we have need of. And so we
[43:00] thank him for that which we have. Amen.
[43:02] It's not about a big show anyways. It's
[43:04] about the simplicity of humble obedience
[43:06] to the spirit and to take your gifts and
[43:08] put them into his hands. So appreciate
[43:10] each one that's doing that. Amen. Have
[43:12] patience for our new song leader. Have
[43:14] patience for our new piano player. They
[43:17] will not be as polished as brother Bob
[43:19] and sister Moren. That's just the way it
[43:21] is. Amen. But we've got to have patience
[43:23] and grace for them. Amen. So, God bless
[43:25] you all and let's certainly encourage
[43:27] them as they go along that that that we
[43:29] appreciate their their sacrifice and
[43:30] their effort. Amen. Want to also say
[43:33] that Sister Amanda is leaving tomorrow
[43:34] to go back to BC. We wanted to thank her
[43:37] for coming our way. We've had a
[43:38] wonderful time. Uh I would give her a
[43:40] five-star review. I think I've gained
[43:42] three lbs in the seven days she's six
[43:43] days she's been here because she brings
[43:45] donuts and pastries and and cookies and
[43:48] cake and all these things. She knows how
[43:50] to make herself welcome. She knows how
[43:51] to be a blessing and get a blessing at
[43:53] the same time. So, we thank the Lord for
[43:55] that. God bless you. Sister Amanda,
[43:56] please take our greetings back to uh
[43:58] your family and to the church there.
[44:00] Brother Joshua Moy is the pastor. I've
[44:02] only met him once, but just pass on our
[44:04] greetings to him and our friends we have
[44:06] there as well. Amen. I've got a
[44:08] testimony this evening if that's okay.
[44:10] as I've shared over the pulpit at that
[44:11] time uh in February where I backed into
[44:14] a a vehicle in the snowstorm and it was
[44:16] just a dumb thing and it shouldn't have
[44:18] happened and a you know a bad weather
[44:20] conditions and these things and I was
[44:21] really kicking myself but it was an
[44:23] opportunity that came out of that to to
[44:24] testify about why I I went and I
[44:27] followed up and I searched that woman
[44:28] down until I got her and I and I paid
[44:31] obviously the insurance ended up paying
[44:32] for her car and it so changed her. She
[44:35] was on social media trying to figure out
[44:37] who did this. it was going to cost her
[44:38] $2,000 out of pocket, money she didn't
[44:40] have, single mom, these different
[44:42] things. And so when I reached out to the
[44:44] police to say, "Hey, I haven't heard
[44:45] from this person. Has there been a
[44:46] report? Can you put me in contact?" They
[44:48] passed it on. And she was so thankful
[44:50] for that. But deep down in my heart, the
[44:52] the the uh fiscal responsibility that is
[44:55] inside me was saying, "This one's going
[44:57] to hurt because you know the way things
[44:59] are today. If they can raise your rates
[45:00] for anything, they'll raise it." And I
[45:02] knew my renewal was coming up. And so I
[45:04] I I was cringing and I didn't want to
[45:06] look at at my renewal rates. And I went
[45:08] on yesterday or the day before and I
[45:10] found they were down 10%.
[45:12] Which doesn't happen at all. But what it
[45:15] is is that I had never before put on
[45:18] accident forgiveness and last year was
[45:20] the first time I put it on for some
[45:22] reason. And so it didn't cost me a
[45:24] penny. In fact, my rates went down by
[45:25] 10% for being a continuing customer. So
[45:27] praise the Lord for that. I say that in
[45:29] the end I got to be a testimony to show
[45:31] what a Christian does when they do
[45:33] something that's going to hurt them and
[45:34] yet they still do the right thing.
[45:36] Testify to this lady that I was a
[45:37] pastor. She knows about the church and
[45:39] these different things. The Lord knows
[45:40] if she'll ever walk through those doors.
[45:42] But I say, Lord, I'm thankful that you
[45:44] covered me and you allowed me to go
[45:45] through that without taking a hit. So I
[45:47] say, God bless God. I thank God for his
[45:50] grace. Amen.
[45:52] All right. Colossians chapter 1. This
[45:54] evening, we read this last service.
[45:56] We're going to continue this thought. It
[45:57] says, "And he," speaking of Christ as
[45:59] the head of the body, the church who is
[46:01] the beginning, the firstborn from the
[46:03] dead, that in all things he might have
[46:06] the preeminence. Amen. God bless you.
[46:08] You can have your seats again this
[46:09] evening. We're continuing our thought on
[46:11] on the token life. And we're speaking
[46:13] again about absolute power. And really
[46:15] what we're talking about now is
[46:16] headship. And uh we'll focus on that
[46:18] more throughout the service. We won't so
[46:19] much get into the mind of Christ just
[46:21] yet. But we have to realize that
[46:23] headship is realizing you can't lead
[46:24] yourself and get heavenly results. Amen.
[46:27] We can lead ourselves and we can get
[46:29] results, but we can't get the kind of
[46:30] results that we're looking for and
[46:32] believing for. Amen. We're incapable of
[46:34] doing that. And we finished with this
[46:35] quote last time where brother said,
[46:37] "See, what the world calls great, God
[46:39] calls foolish. And what the world calls
[46:42] foolish, God calls great." He says,
[46:44] "That's right. So don't mind to be
[46:46] called foolish." He says, "Because
[46:48] remember, you can't have the mind of
[46:50] Christ and the mind of the world at the
[46:53] same time." He says, "You can't be in
[46:55] your way and God's way at the same time.
[46:58] You have to get out of your own way to
[47:00] let God have his way." Now, that is a
[47:03] conscious choice. He didn't say God has
[47:06] to move you out of your way. He says
[47:08] you've got to get yourself out of your
[47:10] way. You've got to buckle up and say,
[47:12] "Lord, I am stepping aside so that you
[47:15] can have the free reign in my life."
[47:17] That's a conscious decision. Amen. You
[47:19] have to get out of your own way to let
[47:21] God have his way. He says, "And that's
[47:23] the only way you're ever going to do
[47:25] anything. You've got to get away from
[47:27] your own thoughts and your own reasons."
[47:29] He says, "Don't try to reason. Just
[47:31] believe." He's saying to get out of your
[47:32] way, you've got to lay down everything
[47:34] you know and just step into the word and
[47:36] say, "I believe by faith." And that's
[47:38] it. Don't try to explain it. It's not
[47:40] going to be explainable. If you've ever
[47:42] had God do something in your life, you
[47:44] realize so many times you can't explain
[47:46] how it all worked out and it just worked
[47:47] out. And that's what he's asking us to
[47:49] do. Amen. And I want to take this this
[47:52] this thought forward this morning
[47:53] because I want a life that reflects what
[47:55] he's talking about here. Amen. This is
[47:57] the kind of life I want where I can get
[47:59] out of my way and when I get out of my
[48:00] way, I get out of God's way and then God
[48:02] can start to work in my life. Amen.
[48:04] Would you say that's your heart's desire
[48:06] this evening? That the Lord would have
[48:07] his way in your life this evening. Well,
[48:10] I'll tell you, if he says there's a way,
[48:11] then we've got to have a way. Amen.
[48:13] We've got to know that there's a way.
[48:14] And God doesn't leave us helpless in
[48:16] these situations. And Paul would talk
[48:18] about the heroes of the faith in the
[48:20] book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter. And
[48:22] he would say of Moses, he said, "By
[48:24] faith, Moses when he was come to years,
[48:27] refused to be called the son of
[48:29] Pharaoh's daughter." Choosing,
[48:32] this was a choice.
[48:34] Wasn't happen stance. It just happened
[48:36] to be. It says, "Choosing rather to
[48:39] suffer affliction with the people of God
[48:41] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for
[48:44] how long? A season." See, it's always
[48:47] temporary.
[48:49] Sin is always temporary. If I can say it
[48:51] this way, you understand what I mean.
[48:52] It's good for a while, but in the end,
[48:55] it's not very good, and it's only going
[48:57] to take you to a certain point. Amen.
[48:59] But notice here, Paul says that Moses
[49:01] chose, he made a conscious decision.
[49:04] Amen. He laid down his opportunity to be
[49:06] great in Pharaoh's court. He was
[49:08] Pharaoh's grandson. Amen. He could have
[49:10] been a great man in Egypt. He had a
[49:12] natural advantage by being adopted into
[49:14] the family of Pharaoh. But he took a
[49:17] harder road.
[49:19] He took a harder road. Why? Because
[49:22] something had changed his values.
[49:24] Something had changed his thinking, his
[49:26] approach. And it said this, esteeming
[49:28] the reproach of Christ greater riches
[49:32] than the treasures in Egypt. Reproach is
[49:35] greater than all the treasures of Egypt.
[49:37] That makes no sense, does it? But watch
[49:39] why he saw it as riches. It says, "For
[49:41] he had respect under the recompense of
[49:44] the reward." Putting that into plain
[49:45] language, it means that he was looking
[49:47] forward to what he was going to gain
[49:50] rather than the hardships before the
[49:52] gain. In other words, what came after
[49:54] the hardship was worth the hardship.
[49:57] And what he could take to avoid the
[49:59] hardship would never exceed that what he
[50:01] was going to get if he would go the
[50:02] harder road. Remember, brother Brandham
[50:04] had that that interpretation in tongues
[50:06] that was given by the UN interpreter.
[50:08] And remember what the angel of the Lord
[50:10] said. He says, "Because thou hast
[50:13] chosen chosen the harder way." There's
[50:16] something that has changed the way you
[50:18] think, the way you approach things, and
[50:20] it takes you down the harder road. But
[50:22] the harder road has a greater reward at
[50:24] the end. And Moses saw that at the end.
[50:26] Amen. And yet, even with this mindset,
[50:28] church, Moses still had to be stripped
[50:29] down. He still had to be broken down.
[50:31] God had to take him, break down all the
[50:34] pieces, disassemble him, and put them
[50:36] all back together again.
[50:38] There's a whole process that's going on
[50:40] through these things. And Moses came to
[50:41] the place where he thought there was
[50:43] nothing in him worth talking about.
[50:45] Bringing to the table, raising up,
[50:48] somehow using in God. And that wasn't
[50:50] just happen stance, church. God knows
[50:52] how to bring things about in our life.
[50:54] Amen. For a son or a daughter of God, we
[50:57] don't just get to be the way we are. God
[50:59] is working in our lives. It's a
[51:01] sovereign hand of God to bring us to a
[51:03] place where he can mold us and shape us
[51:05] and then use us exactly as he wants to
[51:07] by his word. So don't look at your
[51:10] hardships as, well, look, look at me. I
[51:12] just I I deal with so much and everybody
[51:14] else seems to have it so much easier.
[51:16] No, they just don't necessarily have it
[51:18] so obviously heard. We've all got
[51:20] struggles. We've all got trials. We've
[51:22] all got things we wish we weren't
[51:23] dealing with. But it's all the tender
[51:25] hand of Jehovah to try and bring you to
[51:27] a place where you can step into the
[51:29] almighty hand of God. And he can use you
[51:31] not just for his benefit, but it'll be
[51:33] for your eternal benefit as well. And
[51:35] when God finished with Moses, all Moses
[51:37] would could say was, "Who am I? Who am
[51:40] I?" Moses started out saying, "Look at
[51:43] me." And now he's saying, "Who am I?"
[51:44] He's saying, "Why would I have anything
[51:45] to do with this? I can't even talk, God.
[51:48] That's a really wonderful place, Lord. I
[51:50] don't have anything to bring to the
[51:51] table." Perfect. Now, I can use you.
[51:53] That's what God's looking for. Amen.
[51:55] Because this human nature, it likes to
[51:57] talk. It likes to produce. It likes to
[51:59] pump itself up. It likes to discern. It
[52:02] likes to think. It likes to project
[52:03] itself into things. And that's nowhere
[52:06] that God wants us to be. God wants us
[52:08] completely out of it so that he can fill
[52:10] it up. Amen. God's looking for empty
[52:12] vessels to fill, not filled vessels to
[52:14] use.
[52:16] If we're full of oursel, there's no
[52:17] point in God coming in. That's why we
[52:20] have to be emptied out. Why we have to
[52:21] die out so that he can fill us with
[52:23] himself and then he can use us. Because
[52:25] remember, the body can't have two heads.
[52:28] And if it's me plus Jesus, that ain't
[52:30] going to work.
[52:32] A body with two heads is a freak of
[52:34] nature. You've seen them, they have
[52:35] co-joined twins, right? and you see him
[52:37] and it's a single body, but it's got two
[52:40] heads off of there and it's not normal.
[52:42] It's not natural and it doesn't work
[52:44] very well. It doesn't work very well.
[52:47] Amen. He's the only head that we can
[52:49] have. Now, brother Brand, we in this
[52:51] message of prisoner, he's speaking of
[52:53] Joseph and Moses and Paul and he says
[52:55] they were trained in one way, God
[52:58] changed them to another. He says they
[53:01] had to become a complete prisoner to not
[53:03] act in the way that they wanted to act,
[53:06] but to act in the way that God wanted
[53:08] them to act. And he says he's the same
[53:10] yesterday, today, and forever. What that
[53:12] means is that he's got to get us to the
[53:14] place where we'll stop acting like we
[53:16] want to and that he can get us to the
[53:19] place where we act the way he wants us
[53:20] to. And the way that he wants us to act
[53:22] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[53:24] today, and forever. It's the same thing
[53:27] over and over and over again. You I'm
[53:29] reminded of when a baby's born and and
[53:31] when a baby's born, they have a head and
[53:33] they have a body and they're joined
[53:35] together. But if you ever notice, they
[53:37] can't control anything. They don't know
[53:39] how to really do anything. Amen. And and
[53:41] I've noticed with ours especially, our
[53:42] our babies tend to have these these
[53:44] these skin issues and so they get they
[53:46] get itchy and if you leave them to
[53:48] theirelves, they make a mess of things
[53:50] because they can't control their hands
[53:51] and so they end up just scratching all
[53:53] over the place. And with our youngest in
[53:55] particular, we had to put socks on his
[53:57] hands because if we left him to himself,
[54:01] he'd scratch himself all over and he
[54:04] would be even more miserable if we left
[54:06] him to his own means.
[54:10] Are you catching what I'm laying down?
[54:12] If he if we left him to his own means,
[54:14] he's got all the parts. But he didn't
[54:16] have yet the intelligence, the training
[54:19] to teach his hands, his digits, whatever
[54:22] to go where they needed to go to do the
[54:24] work that needed to be done without
[54:26] damaging himself.
[54:28] See what I'm catching? It's not It's not
[54:31] that he couldn't scratch the the itch.
[54:32] It's that he would scratch everything
[54:34] that wasn't the itch and cause himself
[54:36] to turn into a scarf face.
[54:38] So, we had to protect him by himself by
[54:40] putting his hands in something soft so
[54:42] that when he scratched, he could relieve
[54:44] the itch, but he wouldn't destroy his
[54:46] skin.
[54:47] As he matured though, he started getting
[54:50] better and better at it. And pretty
[54:51] soon, what could we do? We could take
[54:53] the gloves off, the the socks off
[54:55] because now he could itch exactly where
[54:57] he needed to and then move away without
[55:00] any danger to himself. Amen. But if not,
[55:03] he'd be a scarface today.
[55:05] If we let him listen, if he could talk
[55:08] at that time, he'd probably be saying,
[55:09] "Listen, I know where I itch. Just let
[55:12] me scratch the itch." But his
[55:14] capabilities were way below his
[55:16] confession. And so, we had to save him
[55:18] from his own confession.
[55:20] Amen.
[55:20] Amen. We had to save him from his own
[55:23] his own idea of what he could do by
[55:24] putting those socks on his hands so that
[55:26] he could practice
[55:29] without hurting himself.
[55:31] It's the same thing with the believer
[55:32] tonight. Amen. We closed that last
[55:34] service with h with the scripture of
[55:36] Christ being the head of the church, his
[55:38] bride. And that means that the bride is
[55:40] the body and he is the head. Amen. Now,
[55:42] there's a whole lot wrapped in that and
[55:44] we'll unpack some of it this service and
[55:46] in the coming services. But remember,
[55:47] the head knows what it wants. My
[55:50] youngest knew what he wanted. He knew he
[55:53] wanted to itch, but the body could not
[55:55] respond the way the head was telling it
[55:57] to respond.
[55:59] Now, in his case, he had an immature
[56:01] mind and an immature body. But when we
[56:03] come down to a bride now, what do we
[56:05] have? We have a mature head with a
[56:08] relatively immature body. And we're
[56:10] trying to put those two together. And
[56:12] that's a hard thing to do. It's kind of
[56:15] the opposite today where we've got young
[56:16] people with an immature head and a
[56:17] mature body. That's what's getting them
[56:19] into trouble is their body can do all
[56:20] sorts of things and they don't have a
[56:22] head to control it. But it's the other
[56:24] way for the bride. Amen. We've got to
[56:26] have a we have a mature head. Amen. We
[56:28] have the the ancient of days with all
[56:31] knowledge and all truth. And then he's
[56:33] he's he's attached himself. He's joined
[56:35] himself to a bride body. And she's got
[56:38] to learn to do what the head tells her
[56:40] to do. And so our goal is to what? Is to
[56:44] listen and obey,
[56:47] not to try and lead the way. Amen.
[56:49] Otherwise, what happens? We end up with
[56:50] scars. If you've ever noticed, and maybe
[56:54] you're going through this now, I don't
[56:55] know. If you keep coming up to the same
[56:58] situation, if you keep coming up to the
[57:00] same problem, if you keep circling
[57:02] around and around, the problem is
[57:03] usually because you're trying to do it
[57:05] yourself rather than let the head teach
[57:07] you what to do in those situations.
[57:10] There are people I know and I watch from
[57:11] a distance and I think I'm right in it.
[57:14] I see them going around and around those
[57:15] mountains time and time again. And it's
[57:17] because they won't yield to Christ. They
[57:19] keep trying to scratch the itch
[57:21] themselves. and all they're doing is
[57:22] developing scars, not just on them, but
[57:24] on the people that are around them as
[57:25] well. It's a hard life to live. Amen. We
[57:28] don't need to just as soon as we're
[57:29] joined to Christ, go into action. That's
[57:31] the last thing we need to do. What we
[57:33] need to do is sit still and know that he
[57:35] is God. Amen. Sit still and figure out
[57:37] who's going to lead this train and who's
[57:39] going to be the caboose. He's got to be
[57:41] the engine. We got to be the caboose.
[57:43] He's got to lead. We've got to follow.
[57:44] He's got to pull and we've got to be
[57:46] drawn along. It's got to be him that's
[57:48] doing the work. Amen. And and this is
[57:50] that's what the adoption process is all
[57:52] about. It's a process of learning to
[57:54] lean on him, learning to obey, learning
[57:58] to trust, learning to walk. And when he
[58:00] finally sees that we're doing it exactly
[58:02] the way he taught us, now he can give us
[58:04] some responsibility. Now he can put us
[58:06] into situations. Now he can start to use
[58:08] us to do his work. Brother would make
[58:11] this and he's talking about there was a
[58:12] movement going around called manifested
[58:14] sons back in the 60s and he said people
[58:17] are told out on on the west coast now oh
[58:19] we've got the immortal baptism we
[58:21] baptize you in water you turn right back
[58:23] to a young man there a young woman yes
[58:25] sir he said they have Elijah's garments
[58:27] they have manifested sons of gods he
[58:29] says they'll say yes sir brother god is
[58:31] manifested uh god is getting manifested
[58:34] sons right now manifesting tell them all
[58:36] about this tonight you're a sinner
[58:38] tomorrow you're manifested sons of God.
[58:41] He says, "Nonsense." Where do you get
[58:43] that in the word, babies are not born
[58:46] men. They're born babies and they grow
[58:49] to men. And so, we come into this idea
[58:52] that when we're born again by the
[58:54] spirit, we should automatically go into
[58:56] action. No, you've got to be trained
[58:57] first. You got to learn to sit still
[59:00] before you can learn to move. You got to
[59:02] learn to be controlled before you can go
[59:04] into a place where you need to be under
[59:07] that control. Amen. We're an immature
[59:09] body with a mature head. Amen. And
[59:11] that's something that we've got to
[59:13] remember day by day. He knows the way.
[59:16] Remember when Joshua was going to lead
[59:17] the children of Israel over and he says,
[59:19] "Listen, put the word first because
[59:21] you've not gone this way before."
[59:23] Church, let me tell you, nobody's gone
[59:25] in a rapture in this age. Nobody's gone
[59:28] ahead. Nobody knows the way. And so,
[59:30] we've got to let the word lead the way.
[59:32] And it takes the spirit quickening the
[59:34] word for us to step into the word for
[59:35] our day because we know it. does not
[59:38] mean we should go do it. That is not it.
[59:41] We're going to get into some quotes
[59:42] maybe in the next service where where
[59:43] brother was talking about Joshua and he
[59:45] says the people were saying Joshua
[59:47] listen you have Moses commission. You
[59:49] know where we're going. You can see the
[59:51] land. You've got the word. Let's go. He
[59:53] says and God could not trust those
[59:55] people. He says but he could trust
[59:58] Joshua because Joshua would wait on him
[1:00:02] and go in his time. And when he went in
[1:00:04] his time, it worked out perfectly every
[1:00:06] single time. It's not just knowing the
[1:00:08] word, it's knowing more than that. And
[1:00:10] we'll come back to this. Amen. We're
[1:00:12] tied to that ancient of days. And that's
[1:00:14] our saving grace is that he knows
[1:00:16] everything we don't know. And everything
[1:00:18] we think we know, we don't really know.
[1:00:20] So, we got to rely on him. But remember,
[1:00:22] we read this quote a little while ago
[1:00:24] that said this. It says, "The anointing
[1:00:25] is not emotion. The anointing is supreme
[1:00:28] power in control, knowing exactly
[1:00:31] exactly what and how. He says, "And
[1:00:34] that's what's here." Now, that's just a
[1:00:37] quote. Let's take it back to the
[1:00:38] scriptures. Amen. And we go into the
[1:00:41] book of Ephesians. Now, remember,
[1:00:42] Ephesians is the same book as Joshua to
[1:00:45] the believer, to to the New Testament
[1:00:47] believer. It is for the overcomer. It is
[1:00:49] for the elect. It is not for the foolish
[1:00:52] virgin. It is not for the professing
[1:00:53] Christian. It is for the spiritfilled
[1:00:56] sons and daughters of God. Okay? So this
[1:00:58] is our book if I could put it that way.
[1:01:00] Ephesians is only for the true believer.
[1:01:03] And Paul says that the God of our Lord
[1:01:05] Jesus Christ, the father of glory, may
[1:01:08] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:01:11] revelation in the knowledge of him.
[1:01:13] Notice he didn't say give you wisdom. He
[1:01:15] says he'll give you the spirit of
[1:01:16] wisdom. Remember what Jesus said. He the
[1:01:19] spirit of truth. He gives you the spirit
[1:01:22] that has the wisdom, that has the word,
[1:01:24] that has all knowledge. He doesn't give
[1:01:25] us all knowledge. He gives us that which
[1:01:27] has all knowledge
[1:01:29] because we can't hold it all. We can't
[1:01:32] contain it all. We can't fathom it all.
[1:01:34] But what we have is a spirit that will
[1:01:36] give us what we have need of when we
[1:01:38] need it. So we know exactly what and
[1:01:41] how. A spirit of wisdom, notice, and
[1:01:44] revelation. It is spiritual insight. It
[1:01:46] is not carnally based. that is not
[1:01:48] natural knowledge or education or
[1:01:50] experience, but it is coming from
[1:01:52] eternity dropping down into the natural
[1:01:54] to produce eternity in us. That's what's
[1:01:57] going on when the spirit of God works in
[1:01:59] us. Amen. It's the opening of the word
[1:02:01] to each of us personally. And it can
[1:02:03] only happen by the Holy Spirit. It can
[1:02:05] only happen by the Holy Spirit living in
[1:02:08] your soul. He says that the eyes of your
[1:02:10] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:02:12] may know what is the hope of his calling
[1:02:14] and what the riches of the glory of his
[1:02:17] inheritance to the saints. Remember we
[1:02:19] led read last service that Paul says
[1:02:21] these things we we we we teach those
[1:02:24] things that are freely given to us by
[1:02:26] the spirit of God. And he's coming back
[1:02:28] and he's reinforcing that and saying
[1:02:29] listen the spirit of God is given to you
[1:02:31] so that you can see what belongs to you,
[1:02:34] what your purpose is, what your plan is,
[1:02:36] what God is trying to do in your life.
[1:02:38] Amen. Our our our message that we
[1:02:40] receive by the spirit points us to the
[1:02:42] inheritance of Christ in the word for
[1:02:44] each and every one of us. But watch now
[1:02:47] what comes with that message because he
[1:02:50] says and with that he says know what is
[1:02:53] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:02:57] usward who believe according to the
[1:03:00] working of his mighty power. This is why
[1:03:02] Ephesians is to the true believer
[1:03:05] to those of us who believe. But notice
[1:03:07] now it is his power, his mighty power
[1:03:10] and it's directed he says to usward.
[1:03:12] That phrase to us word means into
[1:03:15] towards in other and among us. In other
[1:03:17] words, it's a participation event. This
[1:03:20] is not an observation event. This is a
[1:03:23] participation event. You're a part of
[1:03:25] it. It is not just power over us or
[1:03:27] power around us, but it is power that
[1:03:29] comes into us and amongst us to make us
[1:03:31] produce this word. Amen. This isn't us
[1:03:34] sitting on the sidelines watching a
[1:03:36] game, but this is one where we involved
[1:03:38] not of our own power, but by the power
[1:03:40] of the spirit of God working in us to
[1:03:42] quicken his word. I want to ask you
[1:03:45] tonight, what kind of power is that? His
[1:03:48] power, his mighty power. What is it that
[1:03:50] you receive when you got the baptism of
[1:03:52] the Holy Ghost in your soul?
[1:03:55] Is it just the sealing power?
[1:03:58] Is it just a talking power? Is it just
[1:04:00] the receiving power? No, it's proven
[1:04:03] power. It's so much greater than just a
[1:04:06] seal. It is something that's alive and
[1:04:08] well inside each and every one of our
[1:04:09] souls when we've received it. Paul said
[1:04:12] which he wrought. Speaking of the power,
[1:04:14] this power he wrought in Christ. That
[1:04:16] word wrought means that he worked it. He
[1:04:18] showed it. He proved it to be effective.
[1:04:20] He accomplished it in Christ when he
[1:04:23] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:04:25] his own right hand in the heavenly
[1:04:27] places. far above all principality and
[1:04:30] power and might and dominion and every
[1:04:33] name that is named not only in the world
[1:04:35] but also in that which is to come. What
[1:04:38] kind of power is it church? It's
[1:04:40] resurrection power. It's overcoming
[1:04:42] power. It's dominating power. It's
[1:04:45] ruling power. It's delivering power.
[1:04:48] It's teaching power. It's comforting
[1:04:50] power. It's resting power. And it was
[1:04:52] proved in Christ when he rested on the
[1:04:54] word. And the word produced what it said
[1:04:56] he was resting on.
[1:04:58] That's the kind of power we're talking
[1:04:59] about this morning. Amen. It's proven
[1:05:02] power and he proved it in Christ. Bram
[1:05:05] would say this. He said, "He is our
[1:05:06] absolute because we have the assurance
[1:05:09] of the resurrection because he is raised
[1:05:12] in us." He says, "How do we know?" He
[1:05:15] says, "He lives. He does exactly here
[1:05:18] what he did when he was here on earth."
[1:05:21] He's the same pillar of fire. He says,
[1:05:23] "We have the picture there. He's the
[1:05:25] same one in the church. He's here today
[1:05:28] and where in this body he performs and
[1:05:32] acts exactly like he did then. But
[1:05:36] people don't realize it. Remember what
[1:05:38] Jesus said? They'll say, "Behold, he's
[1:05:40] in the desert. Behold, he's in the
[1:05:41] secret chambers." He says, "But believe
[1:05:43] it not." Why? Because he's in a
[1:05:45] multimember body. He's everywhere. But
[1:05:48] people don't realize it because it's a
[1:05:50] little bit here and a little bit there,
[1:05:51] a little piece here, a little bit there,
[1:05:53] an attribute here, an attribute there.
[1:05:56] It's Christ in a multimember body. And
[1:05:59] he says they'll be gathered in one place
[1:06:00] and that's where the food is, the
[1:06:03] revealed word. That's where these people
[1:06:05] will be gathered together. And there's a
[1:06:07] reason we believe that Christ is alive
[1:06:09] today. And there are many layers to
[1:06:11] that. Amen. But notice what the prophet
[1:06:13] says there. He says he does exactly what
[1:06:15] he did when he was on the earth. And he
[1:06:18] points to a photo that was that was
[1:06:20] confirmed by an examiner that the FBI
[1:06:23] uses for photographs that looked at that
[1:06:25] and said the light absolutely hit the
[1:06:27] lens. It was not a manipulation. It was
[1:06:30] an actual light that hung over that
[1:06:32] man's head. And he says, "See, he lives,
[1:06:35] but not just because we see him." Amen.
[1:06:37] He doesn't just live to exist, but he
[1:06:39] lives to prove his word. He's here to
[1:06:43] show himself real. Amen. That's what he
[1:06:45] was doing. And not since the days of
[1:06:47] Christ was there a ministry that so
[1:06:49] completely matched up to that of Christ
[1:06:52] where he raised the dead, he healed the
[1:06:53] sick, he discerned the thoughts and
[1:06:55] intents of the heart. He delivered from
[1:06:57] torment to the point that some people
[1:06:59] thought he was Jesus Christ. And he said
[1:07:01] they're closer to the truth than those
[1:07:03] that say I'm not. Not because he was
[1:07:05] trying to put anything on himself, but
[1:07:06] because when Christ lives in the man
[1:07:08] than there is Christ there,
[1:07:10] it's a re it's a revealing of Christ all
[1:07:12] over again. It's not the Christ, but
[1:07:14] it's Christ. Amen. What was that prophet
[1:07:16] doing in his ministry? He was proving
[1:07:18] that Christ is alive and well. That's
[1:07:20] what he was doing. Amen. After
[1:07:22] centuries, maybe millennia of
[1:07:23] denominations and dead religion. Amen.
[1:07:26] Finally, there came a ministry that so
[1:07:28] matched up to Christ that people started
[1:07:30] to actually believe it again. rather
[1:07:32] than just going to church and having a
[1:07:34] religious experience or a spiritual
[1:07:36] experience or dancing or shouting or
[1:07:38] maybe just sitting there dead as a lump
[1:07:40] on a log. But what they saw was the
[1:07:42] scripture came alive and this ministry
[1:07:44] folded itself into the very pages of our
[1:07:47] Bible. And they said, "Look, it's him
[1:07:49] all over again." That's why we believe.
[1:07:52] Amen. And what was it? He came with a
[1:07:54] message. It was a shout that said, "The
[1:07:55] bridegroom is coming. Get ready. Get
[1:07:58] ready. Get ready." And some people woke
[1:08:00] up and they made themselves ready. And
[1:08:02] that's what's happening here tonight
[1:08:03] under the opening of the word is there's
[1:08:04] a people getting ready. She's wrapped
[1:08:06] herself in his righteousness. She's
[1:08:08] robed herself in the wedding garment of
[1:08:10] his word. That's what's happening. Amen.
[1:08:13] After decades of dead religion, we
[1:08:15] finally have proof that Jesus Christ is
[1:08:17] alive and well.
[1:08:19] Amen. Not that he was and not that he
[1:08:21] will be, but that he is still the I am.
[1:08:23] Amen. And there's a power. And that's
[1:08:25] what the prophet brought was he brought
[1:08:27] us back to the faith of those
[1:08:28] Pentecostal fathers where we could
[1:08:30] believe in the word and the word would
[1:08:32] do the work. That's all he was trying to
[1:08:34] get us to do. He didn't want us to
[1:08:35] believe him. He wanted us to believe the
[1:08:37] word cuz he knew he was going to go
[1:08:39] eventually. But if we could believe the
[1:08:41] word, it would keep producing what it
[1:08:42] was supposed to produce. And what was he
[1:08:44] doing, church? He was inviting us into
[1:08:45] the very same ministry. Not the specific
[1:08:48] ministry of a prophet, but the bride
[1:08:50] ministry that would continue speaking by
[1:08:52] the spirit after he was gone. Amen. It
[1:08:55] didn't end with Brother Brandham.
[1:08:56] There's a five-fold ministry still
[1:08:58] preaching the word and there's a bride
[1:08:59] ministry that's living it out every
[1:09:00] single day. How? By the same spirit.
[1:09:03] God's not dead. He didn't die with
[1:09:05] brother Brandham. He's still here alive
[1:09:07] and well. Now watch what this power
[1:09:10] does.
[1:09:12] Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] He says, speaking of the body, he says,
[1:09:16] "And he hath put all things under his
[1:09:18] feet and gave him to be the head over
[1:09:22] all things to the church." Now let's
[1:09:24] stop for a second here. If he is the
[1:09:26] head and he is the body
[1:09:30] then who are the feet?
[1:09:34] Blanca's the foot. She says where are
[1:09:37] the feet? Listen, you might say tonight,
[1:09:40] I am the lowest of the low in this
[1:09:43] church. Maybe you wouldn't.
[1:09:47] But wherever you are, if you're the
[1:09:49] lowest of the low, if you're the weakest
[1:09:51] in faith, you think I I if if you're a
[1:09:55] nobody in this church,
[1:09:57] yet you are a part of the body of Christ
[1:10:00] by the indwelling spirit, then your
[1:10:02] feet, he says, are over all things.
[1:10:06] In other words, Mr. or Mrs. Nobody,
[1:10:08] brother nobody, sister nobody, every
[1:10:11] demon in hell is still beneath you.
[1:10:13] Every power, every torment, every
[1:10:15] sickness, every problem, every
[1:10:17] circumstance is still under your feet if
[1:10:20] you are a part of the body of Christ.
[1:10:22] Church, I say we need to start reading
[1:10:24] our Bible, looking at it through the
[1:10:26] eyes of Christ and our position in him.
[1:10:28] That everything we face is under us
[1:10:31] because we're attached to him. Not
[1:10:34] because of any strength or goodness in
[1:10:36] ourselves, but because he's united us
[1:10:38] with him. Everything is beneath us.
[1:10:41] Amen.
[1:10:41] If you're the dead skin on the bottom of
[1:10:43] the big toe of the body of Christ, every
[1:10:46] demon in hell is below you this evening.
[1:10:48] That's where you're standing.
[1:10:51] Everything is beneath you. They have to
[1:10:55] look up to torment you.
[1:10:58] Hallelujah.
[1:10:59] Amen.
[1:10:59] They've got to bend their necks
[1:11:02] to get a glimpse of the bride of Christ.
[1:11:05] That's where you're standing tonight.
[1:11:08] Don't put yourself lower than he puts
[1:11:10] you. If you're the bottom of the feet,
[1:11:13] you're still greater than anything in
[1:11:14] hell, greater than anything in this
[1:11:16] world. He says it's over all things, all
[1:11:20] dominion, all powers.
[1:11:22] It's all under our feet. We need to
[1:11:25] start talking about how we're in a
[1:11:27] position of overcoming.
[1:11:29] Not just a position of fighting, but a
[1:11:31] position of overcoming.
[1:11:33] Speaking of the church, he says, "Which
[1:11:34] is his body," Paul said, "Ye ye are not
[1:11:38] your own. You are bought with a price.
[1:11:40] Therefore, glorify God." He says, "Which
[1:11:43] is his body, the fullness of him that
[1:11:46] fleth all in all." Now, that word
[1:11:48] fullness
[1:11:49] means the fulfillment or the completion.
[1:11:53] Amen. We are not the filling. We are
[1:11:55] that which has been filled.
[1:11:58] Amen. If we're a Boston cream donut,
[1:12:01] he's the cream. We're the donut. He's
[1:12:04] what makes us good.
[1:12:06] I had one today. That's why I'm
[1:12:08] preaching on donuts. Courtesies of
[1:12:10] Sister Amanda.
[1:12:12] Amen.
[1:12:14] We're not the filling. We're the thing
[1:12:16] that's filled. Amen. And it's Christ in
[1:12:18] us that makes us the fulfillment.
[1:12:20] Remember, Christ is what? The fullness
[1:12:22] of the Godhead bodily. And we are the
[1:12:25] fullness of Christ bodily. Amen. All
[1:12:28] that Christ was, he poured. All that God
[1:12:31] was, he poured into Christ. And all that
[1:12:33] Christ was, he poured into the church.
[1:12:36] Amen. That's where we're standing. We
[1:12:39] are the recipients today of his power,
[1:12:43] of his plan, of his person, of his life.
[1:12:46] He is the fullness of God and we are the
[1:12:47] fullness of him expressed in flesh
[1:12:49] today. We're the expression of Christ
[1:12:52] today. I want you to say that with me. I
[1:12:55] am the expression of Christ. I am the
[1:12:58] expression of Christ. Write that on your
[1:13:00] Write that on your on your fridge when
[1:13:02] you go home. I am the expression of
[1:13:04] Christ. I many of us have seen the the
[1:13:06] the Veggie Tales thing where the the
[1:13:08] worm is listening in on the boat with
[1:13:09] Jonah and he's listening to the tape and
[1:13:11] it it's a uh oh what are they called?
[1:13:13] It's a motivational Thank you, brother
[1:13:15] Joe. A motivational tape and and he's
[1:13:18] listening to it and he's a little worm
[1:13:19] and it's saying you are a skilled motor
[1:13:21] metal worker. And he says I am a skilled
[1:13:23] metal worker. He says, "I did not know
[1:13:25] this."
[1:13:27] I'm asking you to say, "I am the
[1:13:29] fulfillment of Christ.
[1:13:31] I did not know this." But he's trying to
[1:13:34] get us to see that. Trying to get us to
[1:13:36] see that. And it comes by reading about
[1:13:38] yourself in the word. Amen. We got to
[1:13:40] start reading it like it's a not it's
[1:13:43] about not that it's for somebody, but
[1:13:44] it's for me. Amen. It'll encourage us a
[1:13:47] whole lot more if we can see ourselves
[1:13:48] in it. Brother Brandon would say this.
[1:13:51] He says, "Now Jesus can't come here in a
[1:13:53] corporal body. For when he comes in a
[1:13:55] corporal body, then the second coming of
[1:13:57] Christ will be when every eye shall see
[1:13:59] him and every knee bow and every tongue
[1:14:01] confess." He says, "But his holy spirit,
[1:14:03] which is called the comforter in the
[1:14:05] Bible, was to come and do the same works
[1:14:08] that he did because it's Christ in
[1:14:10] spirit." Christ said, "I came from God.
[1:14:13] I go to God a little while in the
[1:14:15] world." He says, "That's the people will
[1:14:17] see me no more." The worldly order. He
[1:14:19] says, "Yet you will see me." He says,
[1:14:20] "That's the church, for I'll be with you
[1:14:22] to the end of the world, even be in
[1:14:24] you." And he said, "The works that I do
[1:14:27] shall you do also." Now, if you look at
[1:14:30] the pattern in the New Testament,
[1:14:31] remember when Peter and John went in and
[1:14:33] it says that they saw that they were
[1:14:35] ignorant and unlearned, but they knew
[1:14:37] that they had been with Jesus. Amen. And
[1:14:40] that's the testimony of the believer
[1:14:41] today. We may be ignorant. We may be
[1:14:43] unlearned. They may not be as wise as
[1:14:46] this world, but people can look at us
[1:14:48] and say they've been with Jesus. That's
[1:14:50] what we're supposed to be. It's the word
[1:14:52] made flesh. They can't understand it.
[1:14:54] They can't explain it. They may not
[1:14:56] agree with it, but there's something
[1:14:57] about us that says he's been with Jesus.
[1:15:00] She's been with Jesus, and something has
[1:15:01] changed. Amen. Now, you know, there's a
[1:15:04] difference between what we are and what
[1:15:06] we used to be. No matter how we were
[1:15:08] raised, there's a difference between who
[1:15:10] I was and who I am today. by God's grace
[1:15:12] and it is only by his grace. But you
[1:15:14] know we have people that go through this
[1:15:16] in life. Amen. And and we see that that
[1:15:19] uh people that that used to be a certain
[1:15:22] way and they've become a new way. And
[1:15:23] the easiest way to see this would be in
[1:15:25] somebody that's had a lot of weight on
[1:15:27] before. And if somebody was to see that
[1:15:30] guy on the right today and that's all
[1:15:32] they knew him that like was that way,
[1:15:34] they'd say, "Oh, okay. He's a good guy.
[1:15:36] He's nice guy boy. He's careful about
[1:15:37] what he eats." But those that knew him
[1:15:39] when he was 300 lb, they'd say, "Boy,
[1:15:41] you've changed.
[1:15:43] You eat different. You exercise. You
[1:15:46] have different discipline. You have
[1:15:48] different priorities.
[1:15:50] You've changed your way of thinking.
[1:15:53] You're conditioned different now." But
[1:15:55] the person that only knows him as a
[1:15:57] skinny guy, they just say, "Well, he's
[1:15:59] just very disciplined." No, he's been
[1:16:02] reconditioned. He's been he's had his
[1:16:03] thinking changed so that he can live a
[1:16:06] different life, a life that's better
[1:16:07] than he used to live. Amen.
[1:16:11] These people are conditioned to eat a
[1:16:13] particular way, to live a particular
[1:16:15] lifestyle, and in everything they do
[1:16:17] because they know the darker side of
[1:16:19] what happens when you don't, cuz they've
[1:16:21] been there and done that. Amen. They've
[1:16:24] learned what it takes to live a
[1:16:26] healthier lifestyle. and they've been
[1:16:28] conditioned now to exercising and eating
[1:16:31] correctly and they're living a better
[1:16:33] way of life.
[1:16:35] Now, some of us have a testimony of
[1:16:36] never really going bad. I would say it
[1:16:39] this way. We've gone spiritually fat,
[1:16:41] but some of us have. Some of us came
[1:16:44] from a darker place, if I could put it,
[1:16:46] than others, naturally speaking. Some of
[1:16:47] us got into habits and situations and
[1:16:50] relationships and and whatnot. And it's
[1:16:51] a darker place. Amen. But there's one
[1:16:54] thing that we hold in common afterwards.
[1:16:56] Amen. And that is that we're conditioned
[1:16:58] to live a certain way. And it's to be
[1:16:59] conditioned to live according to the
[1:17:01] word of God.
[1:17:03] That's one thing. It doesn't matter if
[1:17:04] we're skinny or we're fat spiritually
[1:17:07] before or after. When it's all said and
[1:17:09] done, we're all feeding and eating the
[1:17:10] same way. And it's by the word of God.
[1:17:13] Amen. Paul would say it this way
[1:17:17] because we're conditioned to live our
[1:17:19] lives
[1:17:21] and it's something that has changed.
[1:17:24] We've been transformed. I would say that
[1:17:27] guy went through a transformation
[1:17:28] myself, but we've got a transformation
[1:17:30] that we go through as well. And Paul
[1:17:33] would say this. He says, "For in him we
[1:17:35] live, we move, and we have our being, as
[1:17:39] certain also of your own poets have
[1:17:41] said, for we are also his offspring."
[1:17:43] We're going to preach on this from a way
[1:17:44] different angle in a future service, but
[1:17:46] notice he says, "For in him, in who? In
[1:17:49] Christ we live." Now, that word means
[1:17:52] quickened or made alive. In other words,
[1:17:54] we were dead, but now we're really
[1:17:57] alive. Amen. We were alive and yet dead
[1:17:59] in our trespasses and sins, Paul said.
[1:18:02] But now we're quickened. Our life is in
[1:18:04] him. We're made really alive. We're
[1:18:06] really living because it's eternal life
[1:18:07] now that's coming out of us. Not just
[1:18:09] the natural life that's going to fade
[1:18:10] away. Our life is in him. Well, the
[1:18:13] Bible would say, "He's my absolute. He's
[1:18:15] my all. Anything outside of that,
[1:18:18] nothing in my arms I bring. I know.
[1:18:20] Nothing else besides Christ and him
[1:18:22] crucified. He says, "I don't want to
[1:18:24] hear anything else but Christ and him
[1:18:25] crucified." My heart says amen to every
[1:18:28] one of his promises. That's why I know
[1:18:30] his holy spirit is a compass. It guides
[1:18:33] me to the word. He says he is my son. He
[1:18:36] is my life. He's my typost, my north
[1:18:38] star. He's all that I could ever think
[1:18:41] to be. He is that to me. He says he's my
[1:18:45] life. Amen. Is that our testimony this
[1:18:48] evening?
[1:18:50] If it is our mouth testimony, then it
[1:18:52] ought to be our life testimony as well.
[1:18:54] That every move we make, every place we
[1:18:56] go, everything we do, we're subjecting
[1:18:59] ourselves to the word and the spirit of
[1:19:01] God. I say, "God, help me." Cuz it's a
[1:19:03] testimony of my mouth, but I would say
[1:19:05] my life still needs some work.
[1:19:07] Amen. When I'm waking up these mornings,
[1:19:10] my prayers have changed to a more
[1:19:12] earnest form of Lord, let me be you
[1:19:15] today. Lord, in whatever simple way it
[1:19:18] might be, let me have an impact that you
[1:19:20] would have if you were here yourself.
[1:19:23] Why? Because I want him to be my life. I
[1:19:27] met up with a It was absolutely
[1:19:29] wonderful. My My wife and sister Amanda
[1:19:31] and the two youngest went on a whale
[1:19:33] watching tour today and while they were
[1:19:35] on there, she saw the back of a man's
[1:19:36] jacket and it had my old employer's name
[1:19:38] on it from Edmonton. And I really like
[1:19:40] that employer until they made some late
[1:19:42] changes. and he was a and so she said to
[1:19:45] him, she says, "Hey, did you used to
[1:19:47] work for this company and he turned
[1:19:48] around and it was it was somebody we
[1:19:50] both knew because she knew his wife and
[1:19:51] and whatnot." And so they started
[1:19:54] talking and so she sent me his card and
[1:19:56] I texted him. So I went and I talked to
[1:19:58] him. But but notice the intersection
[1:20:00] there that he was here for work, had
[1:20:02] brought his wife and son and just at one
[1:20:05] moment they crossed paths of all places
[1:20:08] on a whale watching tour. And so I was
[1:20:10] able to reach out and connect with him
[1:20:13] and we had a nice talk for a little over
[1:20:14] an hour, hour and 15 minutes with him
[1:20:16] and his wife and and he was asking
[1:20:18] about, you know, why did you come here
[1:20:20] and how did you get a job and what's
[1:20:22] going on in this? And I said, well, you
[1:20:24] know, I got a job. I took the the the
[1:20:26] place of of my best friend's my growing
[1:20:28] up best friend's father. I says, he got
[1:20:31] my resume. He he showed it to his boss
[1:20:33] and his boss liked it. I met him for
[1:20:35] coffee and nine months later there I
[1:20:36] was. They said, "But the reason I came
[1:20:38] back was was to support and help the
[1:20:40] church that I grew up in, my home
[1:20:42] church." And that was very interesting
[1:20:44] to him, but his wife really latched on
[1:20:45] to that. She said, "You know, how do you
[1:20:47] like it? And and why did you do that?
[1:20:49] And how's it going? And what kind of
[1:20:50] church is it? What is it?" Because I
[1:20:54] said, "Listen, there were hardships in
[1:20:56] coming here. It wasn't the same. It took
[1:20:58] me a while to get back to the same
[1:20:59] financial capacity. It took me a while
[1:21:01] to get resettled. It cost money to move
[1:21:03] here." She said, "Yes, but I'll bet it
[1:21:05] was worth that I said it's more than
[1:21:06] worth it because we have reached a point
[1:21:08] where nothing else mattered.
[1:21:10] And that's a wonderful place to be where
[1:21:12] the only thing you want is what he wants
[1:21:14] for you. And that is more satisfying
[1:21:16] with all of its hardship. I mean, you
[1:21:18] guys know how a hard church you are.
[1:21:24] No, but there's a hardship. There's a
[1:21:26] burden. There's a there's a strain that
[1:21:28] comes with it. But I said it's so
[1:21:30] fulfilling to do something that really
[1:21:32] matters now. I said, 'It's not wrong to
[1:21:34] work and and and push in your career and
[1:21:36] that cuz her husband's sitting there and
[1:21:39] he's just got a career, but he's not a
[1:21:41] Holy Ghost filled son of God. I'd say
[1:21:43] keep doing what you're doing. That's a
[1:21:44] good thing to do. Work an honest day,
[1:21:46] get an honest living, and support your
[1:21:48] family. He's a wonderful, wonderful man.
[1:21:50] I really, really like him. But for me,
[1:21:52] I'm called to into a different thing.
[1:21:54] And we're called to a different thing.
[1:21:56] Amen. Why? Because we've got a different
[1:21:58] life inside of us. and it won't be
[1:22:00] satisfied with the day-to-day
[1:22:02] of this world. Do you remember, Blanca,
[1:22:04] the way it was when we were in Edmonton
[1:22:05] and we were sitting there and saying,
[1:22:07] "There's got to be more to this walk
[1:22:08] than what we're doing." Why? Because
[1:22:10] there was something in us, a life that
[1:22:12] was unsatisfied because it was calling
[1:22:14] us into his word and into his plan. What
[1:22:17] a wonderful thing to have a call. And
[1:22:19] all you can say is, "Lord, I don't know
[1:22:20] what the call is, but I just want it.
[1:22:22] Lord, I don't know what you have for me,
[1:22:24] but I know there's more." Because
[1:22:25] there's a deep calling to the deep.
[1:22:27] There's a greater faith we've got to
[1:22:28] walk in. There's a different thing we've
[1:22:30] got to do with our life because there
[1:22:31] isn't a satisfaction here even though
[1:22:33] we're doing what your word says. He had
[1:22:35] a different place for us to go, a
[1:22:37] different thing for us to do. And when
[1:22:39] we stepped into it, hallelujah. Praise
[1:22:41] the Lord. It's wonderful. Even the
[1:22:44] strain, even with the strain that comes
[1:22:46] with it, it's wonderful. And I'm so
[1:22:48] thankful for his grace that he could get
[1:22:50] me to a place where I would obey him and
[1:22:51] do those things.
[1:22:53] He says, "In him we live." Then he says,
[1:22:55] "In him we move." This is an interesting
[1:22:57] one because it means to wag, to provoke,
[1:23:00] to stir up, to cause, to go, to set in
[1:23:02] motion. We could say he's the he's the
[1:23:04] head and we're the tail. And in this
[1:23:06] case, the tail does not wag the dog. The
[1:23:08] dog wags the tail. I'm not comparing God
[1:23:10] to a dog, but you know what I'm saying.
[1:23:12] In other words, we don't control what
[1:23:14] happens. We don't get provoked. We don't
[1:23:16] get stirred up. Sometimes religious
[1:23:19] indignation is the worst thing we can
[1:23:21] have because it's not righteous, it's
[1:23:23] religious. Remember Paul had that that
[1:23:26] that girl with a familiar spirit
[1:23:28] following him for days, but he didn't
[1:23:30] get provoked until the spirit of God
[1:23:32] said enough is enough. Paul was okay
[1:23:34] with it. We've got to let him provoke
[1:23:37] us. Let him stir us up. Let's not go
[1:23:41] fight a battle we're not called to
[1:23:43] fight. Let's settle down and let him
[1:23:45] move us. Amen. He's the one giving us
[1:23:46] the commands, telling us when to go,
[1:23:48] when to stop, when to speak, when to be
[1:23:50] quiet. What kind of reaction to have if
[1:23:52] any if any I love this quote this was
[1:23:56] such a beautiful quote he says the Holy
[1:23:59] Ghost is the action in you. He says it's
[1:24:03] a life not an emotion not some sort of a
[1:24:07] fleshly evidence. He says but it is a
[1:24:09] person Jesus Christ the word of God
[1:24:12] established in your heart to quicken
[1:24:14] every word of this age. Notice its
[1:24:16] purpose to quicken every word of this
[1:24:18] age. We're going to get into this.
[1:24:19] There's so much beautiful stuff sitting
[1:24:20] here. We may preach on absolute power
[1:24:22] for a couple of months yet. Just keeps
[1:24:25] opening up. He says, "Now watch the Holy
[1:24:28] Ghost in action." Now, what would we say
[1:24:30] is the Holy Ghost in action? Don't read.
[1:24:32] Don't read. Okay. What would we say is
[1:24:34] the Holy Ghost in action? Oh, we'd say
[1:24:36] it's casting out demons, healing
[1:24:38] sicknesses, raising the dead, discerning
[1:24:41] thoughts and intents of the heart. And
[1:24:43] that's not wrong. He says, "Watch it
[1:24:45] now." He says, "Watch the Holy Ghost in
[1:24:47] action." Not so much in demonstrations.
[1:24:51] He says, "But in action, what it does
[1:24:55] according to the word." In other word,
[1:24:57] the Holy Spirit in action is not about
[1:24:59] proving you. It's about proving the
[1:25:01] word. There's a huge difference there.
[1:25:03] See, now when you guys come up for
[1:25:05] prayer, see, I can come down and I can
[1:25:07] make it about me or I can make it about
[1:25:09] the word because I can say, "Lord, your
[1:25:11] scripture says that that if we lay hands
[1:25:14] on the sick, they shall recover." Okay,
[1:25:16] this is about proving me. And I'm not a
[1:25:18] real pastor if people don't get healed
[1:25:19] when I touch when I lay hands on them.
[1:25:22] See, that's making it about me. He's not
[1:25:25] here to prove me, church. He's here to
[1:25:26] prove his word. And so when I come down,
[1:25:28] my motive has to be Lord, it's your
[1:25:31] word. Lord, it's your son. Lord, it's
[1:25:33] your daughter. I'm just connecting the
[1:25:34] two.
[1:25:35] I'm just connecting the two. I'm turning
[1:25:37] you back to him and trying to raise your
[1:25:39] faith so that you can take the word
[1:25:40] yourself.
[1:25:42] That's what we're trying to get to a
[1:25:43] place where you don't need an elder to
[1:25:44] lay hands on you. You don't need your
[1:25:45] pastor to lay hands on you. You can just
[1:25:47] lay hold of the word.
[1:25:49] Why? Because you've met the person of
[1:25:50] the word and he's living inside of you.
[1:25:53] Amen.
[1:25:54] In him we live. We move. And then he
[1:25:56] says in him we have our being. Now this
[1:25:58] is a in the in the English I love that
[1:26:01] phrase have our being. But in the
[1:26:03] original word it is a in the original
[1:26:04] language it is a single word and it
[1:26:06] means in him we are.
[1:26:10] In him we exist. And I think that's the
[1:26:12] most beautiful thing that we could ever
[1:26:14] achieve. Amen. We are because he is. We
[1:26:17] are. We will be because he is. And we
[1:26:21] were because he is. Everything is
[1:26:23] because of him. Amen. We're tied to the
[1:26:26] eternal. We are everpresent. It says in
[1:26:29] him we have our being. In him we are.
[1:26:31] Not in him we will be or in him we were.
[1:26:35] But it's always in him we are. It's
[1:26:37] everpresent open-ended. There is no end
[1:26:40] to it. In him we live and move and have
[1:26:43] our being. Amen. It's from before time
[1:26:46] till after time. It's the whole thing.
[1:26:48] Brother says it this way. He says, "Now
[1:26:50] by grace I am tied to him that said I am
[1:26:53] not I was." He says, "I am ever present,
[1:26:56] omnisient, omnipotent, infinite, that he
[1:27:00] is not I was." He says, "I am." He is
[1:27:02] still the resurrection. He is still the
[1:27:05] north star. He is still everything to
[1:27:08] me. Paul's saying he is our life. He is
[1:27:10] our motivation. He is our purpose.
[1:27:13] He's our intelligence.
[1:27:16] He's what gets us up in the morning and
[1:27:18] what lays us down in bed at night. From
[1:27:20] start to finish, it's him. Amen. Paul.
[1:27:23] Oh, Paul, what an amazing man. I mean,
[1:27:25] it's the spirit speaking. He would say,
[1:27:27] "And ye are complete in him which is the
[1:27:31] head of all principality and power." Can
[1:27:33] you say it any better than that? You are
[1:27:35] complete in him. He completes you. When
[1:27:38] you have him, you have everything you
[1:27:40] have need of. Abraham says, "And now you
[1:27:42] are his." He says, "Oh, because he is,
[1:27:46] we have the right to all that he has
[1:27:48] purchased for us." Not that he was or
[1:27:50] not that he will be. He says, "It's the
[1:27:52] everpresent because he is ever present.
[1:27:54] We have a right that all to all he's
[1:27:55] purchased for us. Every promise in the
[1:27:58] Bible is yours.
[1:28:00] It belongs to you." He says, "When this
[1:28:02] token is upon you and God has sealed
[1:28:04] you," he says, "Now we want to check
[1:28:06] ourselves for just a moment. When God
[1:28:09] has given you the true baptism of the
[1:28:11] Holy Spirit, are we checking up this
[1:28:13] evening? Has he given you the baptism of
[1:28:14] the Holy Spirit?" Check it off. He says,
[1:28:17] "Then the life of Jesus Christ is within
[1:28:20] you." He says, "Now that's true." And
[1:28:22] every theologian will have to admit that
[1:28:24] to be, "Yes, sir. It's the new birth.
[1:28:26] You are born a new of the Holy Ghost."
[1:28:28] He says, "And because that God has done
[1:28:30] this and you know you're no good in
[1:28:32] yourself and you accept what God has
[1:28:35] done, then he seals you into his kingdom
[1:28:37] by the Holy Spirit." He says these
[1:28:39] wonderful words and everything that
[1:28:42] Jesus purchased and promised you in the
[1:28:45] Bible is yours. He says it's your
[1:28:47] property because it's paid for. Life is
[1:28:50] mine. He paid for it. Life is yours. He
[1:28:52] paid for it. Healing is mine. He paid
[1:28:54] for it. He Healing is yours. He paid for
[1:28:57] it. Freedom is mine. He paid for it.
[1:28:59] Heaven is mine. He paid for it. He has
[1:29:00] paid the price. Everything he purchased
[1:29:03] belongs to the man that holds the token.
[1:29:06] See, we can sit here and we can divide
[1:29:08] God up into little pieces.
[1:29:11] And we can say, "Well, I have Christ,
[1:29:12] but I don't have healing. I have Christ,
[1:29:15] but I don't have freedom or or liberty.
[1:29:17] I have Christ, but I don't have
[1:29:18] deliverance." We can put ourselves by
[1:29:20] saying we're into Christ right into
[1:29:22] eternity. And yet we can be outside of
[1:29:24] our inheritance because we say, "But I
[1:29:26] don't have this or that or the other
[1:29:28] thing." Amen. All in the same sentence.
[1:29:30] I have Christ, but I'm not healed.
[1:29:33] That's a contradiction. It doesn't make
[1:29:35] any sense. Amen. We can take Christ and
[1:29:37] yet when we say that, we take Christ and
[1:29:40] yet we don't even experience all that he
[1:29:42] is. We say, "I I have Christ, but I need
[1:29:45] healing. I have Christ, but I need
[1:29:48] deliverance." No, it's not Christ plus
[1:29:50] healing. It's Christ is healing. It's
[1:29:52] not Christ plus deliverance, it's Christ
[1:29:53] is deliverance. It's all one in the same
[1:29:56] thing. Those are the very attributes and
[1:29:58] nature of God. And when you receive his
[1:30:00] spirit, you receive all of those things
[1:30:02] with it. You don't have to go looking
[1:30:04] for it. It's already there. His his very
[1:30:07] names. You look at the the the the seven
[1:30:10] names of God and he's Jehovah Rafa. God
[1:30:15] is my healer. It's intrinsic to him.
[1:30:17] Healing is God. It's not just from him.
[1:30:21] It's not just a gift, but it is God
[1:30:24] manifested in your body. That's what
[1:30:27] healing is. Jehovah Gyra, the God who
[1:30:30] sees my need and pro makes a provision
[1:30:32] for Jehovah Shama, God who is with me,
[1:30:35] his person, his presence in me. Jehovah
[1:30:39] Shalom, God our peace. He did not say
[1:30:43] that he would just give us peace, but
[1:30:45] rather Paul said he is our peace.
[1:30:49] He is the literal peace. Amen. He does
[1:30:52] give us peace, but his peace is himself.
[1:30:54] I believe he said in John, "Peace I
[1:30:56] leave with you. Peace I give unto you.
[1:30:58] Not as the world giveth, I give unto
[1:31:00] you." He said, "But let not your heart
[1:31:02] be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
[1:31:04] You've heard how I said unto you, I go
[1:31:07] away." See, your peace goes away. But
[1:31:09] then he says, "And come again unto you."
[1:31:12] It is Christ the person that is your
[1:31:14] peace.
[1:31:15] So when the the spirit of God resides
[1:31:18] within you, you don't have to wait for
[1:31:20] God to send peace, peace is already
[1:31:22] there. You just have to recognize it.
[1:31:24] You just have to look for it. Amen.
[1:31:26] Abraham says this. He says, "Pass my
[1:31:28] token on that day of judgment and I'll
[1:31:31] pass over you." He says, "Holding it
[1:31:33] in." He says, "Holding your confession
[1:31:35] in the word that Jesus Christ has died
[1:31:37] for you." And when he does it, he
[1:31:39] displays himself through you.
[1:31:42] He says, "Amen." Yes. Now what's the
[1:31:45] requirement? He says when you recognize
[1:31:48] the token, the life that it took for the
[1:31:51] blood to speak. Let me preach to you
[1:31:53] church. What is healing?
[1:31:55] Is healing a gift? Is g is healing an
[1:31:58] event? Is is healing a time? Amen. You
[1:32:00] say, "I'm waiting for my healing."
[1:32:04] But what are we really doing? Amen. Is
[1:32:06] it something that comes and goes? Is it
[1:32:08] a package that arrives on our doors by
[1:32:11] on our body's door and we open it up and
[1:32:13] take it in? See, we separate that
[1:32:15] healing from God and we say, "I have
[1:32:17] God." And then we say, "I have need of
[1:32:19] healing." No, you got it all when you
[1:32:21] got the Holy Ghost. And all he's waiting
[1:32:24] for you to do is recognize what that
[1:32:26] meant when you got the Holy Ghost. That
[1:32:28] is a token for every single promise in
[1:32:31] the book that he died so that you could
[1:32:32] have it.
[1:32:33] And so what do you do? He says, "You
[1:32:35] hold that token. And with that token,
[1:32:38] you make the confession. The price has
[1:32:40] been paid. This belongs to me. And then
[1:32:42] you say, "God, let your attribute take
[1:32:45] over my body." Because when you're in
[1:32:47] the house, sickness has to leave cuz
[1:32:49] life is there. Torment has to leave
[1:32:52] because peace is there. Wisdom has to be
[1:32:55] there because Christ is there. It's
[1:32:58] already there. You've just got to
[1:33:00] recognize what he gave you when he gave
[1:33:02] you himself. That's what he's trying to
[1:33:04] get us to.
[1:33:06] We say, "Lord, you're healing your
[1:33:07] life." And then we move forward and
[1:33:10] confess nothing else. Amen. We have
[1:33:11] faith confessing the word.
[1:33:14] We talked about people that have lost a
[1:33:16] lot of weight and like that man in the
[1:33:18] before after picture. Amen. And we've
[1:33:21] been conditioned and we're being
[1:33:22] conditioned to live by the word of God.
[1:33:24] Why? Because we're believers. We believe
[1:33:27] it. We believe it's for us. We trust
[1:33:29] it's the truth. We've seen it work.
[1:33:31] We've seen it have eternal consequences.
[1:33:33] We've seen it have natural consequences.
[1:33:36] We've seen it have relational
[1:33:37] consequences. Amen. We're convinced. And
[1:33:40] that's why we can come to God and say,
[1:33:41] "God, I'm trusting you to keep working
[1:33:44] cuz we've seen it work." And if you
[1:33:46] haven't seen it work, it's time to put
[1:33:47] your faith into action and say, "Lord,
[1:33:49] I'm ready to see you work."
[1:33:51] Amen. We've had some some interesting
[1:33:53] moments in our house when we have our
[1:33:54] family devotions and we always pray and
[1:33:57] we have a time of praise and then we
[1:33:58] have a time of prayer requests. And it
[1:34:00] was it was so interesting because as
[1:34:03] some of you know, Biscuit was having
[1:34:04] some issues in the house and and so it
[1:34:07] was to the point where we said, "Listen,
[1:34:08] we're going to have to send Biscuit
[1:34:09] back." But we said, "Let's pray about
[1:34:11] it." And since then, he's been a good
[1:34:13] dog.
[1:34:16] It's simple.
[1:34:18] It's not all about big thunderous
[1:34:20] moments. It's about simple faith where
[1:34:23] you say, "Lord, we've got a desire to
[1:34:26] see you move."
[1:34:29] And then we say, "Would you move?"
[1:34:31] That's all.
[1:34:33] I I I didn't pray some big flowery
[1:34:36] prayer. I didn't take us up into the
[1:34:38] heavens with great resounding words of
[1:34:41] faith.
[1:34:43] Lord, save Biscuit. Keep him from
[1:34:46] himself. Lord, he's just a No. I said,
[1:34:50] Lord,
[1:34:52] you see what's going on. You know what
[1:34:54] the problem is. Would you help Biscuit?
[1:34:58] And guess what? God has helped Biscuit.
[1:35:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:04] If he cares about Biscuit, does he care
[1:35:07] about you? Come on now. If he cares
[1:35:11] about Biscuit, does he care about you?
[1:35:13] You know why he cares about Biscuit,
[1:35:14] church? Because biscuit matters to me.
[1:35:18] Biscuit matters to you. Sometimes other
[1:35:21] people don't have access to this God
[1:35:22] because they're unbelievers. But they've
[1:35:24] got a believer that cares about them.
[1:35:26] And if it matters to you, it matters to
[1:35:27] the master. Amen. Because there's
[1:35:29] something in your heart that's drawing
[1:35:30] you towards him. Amen. We're convinced
[1:35:33] of this. And that's why, like Paul said,
[1:35:34] we can say in him, we live, we move, we
[1:35:38] have our being. And if we go a day where
[1:35:41] we don't talk to him, we start to
[1:35:42] wonder, why am I feeling a little empty?
[1:35:45] Why are things not go quite the way I
[1:35:47] felt today? Why wasn't I so resilient?
[1:35:50] Why did I act that way? And it's because
[1:35:52] we forgot. In him, we live and move and
[1:35:55] have our being.
[1:35:57] He's our victory. Amen. He's our
[1:35:58] overcoming power.
[1:36:01] My prayer every day is Lord, let me get
[1:36:04] to that place where people can look at
[1:36:05] me and say, "He's been with Jesus."
[1:36:08] I may not have met Jesus, but if there's
[1:36:09] anybody's met Jesus, it's brother John
[1:36:11] Kurlet or John Kurlet as the case may
[1:36:13] be. Brother Brown would say this. He
[1:36:15] says, "The true church of Christ, the
[1:36:18] bride is so sold out to him and his
[1:36:21] promised word till the very mind that's
[1:36:24] in Christ is in you." What a difference.
[1:36:27] We sing that song. Can't you see why I'm
[1:36:31] so happy I've accepted the word of the
[1:36:34] Lord? The revealed word that was spoken
[1:36:37] by a prophet of Malachi 4. Amen. God
[1:36:40] reached down out of eternity
[1:36:43] with a message to call a bride out of
[1:36:45] this fallen, forsaken age.
[1:36:48] And what did it do? It turned her heart
[1:36:50] back to him. And she sold herself out.
[1:36:54] And again, I've talked about this
[1:36:56] before, but our older ones here that
[1:36:57] have turned away from family, turned
[1:36:59] away from relationship, what made them
[1:37:02] do it?
[1:37:03] They're sold out. And it only took a
[1:37:06] moment, didn't it? And you can't go
[1:37:09] back. There's no going back. You've got
[1:37:12] a different love now. You've got a
[1:37:14] different head. You got a different
[1:37:15] anchor for your soul. And that's what
[1:37:18] made you walk away. Amen. And that
[1:37:20] ministry called that bride out of
[1:37:22] religion, out of this dead world, out of
[1:37:25] her own rights, out of all the things
[1:37:28] that this world said was good and fun a
[1:37:31] and beneficial and all these things. And
[1:37:33] it called them right out into the
[1:37:34] realities of a living God. And that's
[1:37:36] why we're here today. Behold, I send
[1:37:39] you. Elijah the prophet was his promise.
[1:37:41] Behold, I send you. Amen. Before we ever
[1:37:44] came into natural existence, he said,
[1:37:46] "Behold, I send you." And it was a love
[1:37:49] letter to us.
[1:37:51] And it wasn't a a love letter that a
[1:37:53] prophet wrote. It was a love letter that
[1:37:55] God wrote before the foundation of the
[1:37:57] earth. And what did it do? It called out
[1:37:59] a bride. It caught the attention of a
[1:38:00] bride and she sold herself out to it. We
[1:38:04] look at what everybody else is selling
[1:38:05] out to today. It's scary what people are
[1:38:08] selling themselves out to. A reprobate
[1:38:10] mind. That's what they're sold out to.
[1:38:13] And it leads them into all sorts of
[1:38:15] nastiness.
[1:38:16] All sorts of nastiness. Amen. But we had
[1:38:19] a message that came from beyond time and
[1:38:21] it pointed us back to a life that
[1:38:24] belonged to us before we ever came into
[1:38:26] this world and it'll be there long after
[1:38:28] we leave it. Amen. Brother Bram says we
[1:38:31] were sinners alienated without God in
[1:38:34] the world in that muck of mud and God
[1:38:36] came down to us. He says God sought you.
[1:38:39] You never sought God. No man can come to
[1:38:41] me except the father draws him first.
[1:38:44] And God came down in that muck.
[1:38:46] Hallelujah. God came down in that muck.
[1:38:49] This is muck. And it was in the muck and
[1:38:51] it was covered in muck. Raised in a
[1:38:53] message church and it's still covered in
[1:38:55] muck. Church, he says God came down in
[1:38:58] that muck, what you were, and sought you
[1:39:01] out and brought you out. He says that
[1:39:03] ought to create a perfect love. Look
[1:39:05] what you were and look what you are. He
[1:39:08] says, "What did that?" He said, "It's
[1:39:10] somebody that loves you." Can't you have
[1:39:12] faith in what he's promised you? Then he
[1:39:14] says real genuine love will create a
[1:39:17] confidence in his word. See church once
[1:39:20] you realize he loves you. Nothing else
[1:39:23] matters because you say, "Listen, it
[1:39:25] seems like there's a lie in here
[1:39:27] somewhere. He'll never lie to me though
[1:39:29] cuz he loves me. Seems he's forsaken me.
[1:39:31] No, he'll never forsake me because he
[1:39:32] loves me. Hey, he's going to leave me
[1:39:34] out. He's left me out on a limb. I'm
[1:39:36] hanging out here all on my own." No, he
[1:39:38] loves me. He would never do that. See
[1:39:40] the love is what anchors us when you
[1:39:43] can't see the actions behind that love.
[1:39:45] He says this ought to ought to produce a
[1:39:47] real co a real confidence in his word.
[1:39:50] Our walking, our talking, our living,
[1:39:52] our daily life ought to reflect that
[1:39:55] faith in our decisions, in our
[1:39:57] conversations. Amen. That's what God's
[1:40:00] looking for. And that's where the mind
[1:40:01] of Christ comes in that we could have
[1:40:02] faith in his word. Now, I read this
[1:40:05] quote a few sermons ago and I just want
[1:40:06] to read a short portion of it. He says,
[1:40:08] "Faith is designed to see what God wills
[1:40:11] and wants." See, faith is not designed
[1:40:13] to get you what you want.
[1:40:16] See, too often we're asking to have
[1:40:17] faith for what I want. No, no, no. I
[1:40:19] need to find the faith for what he wants
[1:40:22] because that's where perfect faith is
[1:40:24] when it's what he wants, his will, his
[1:40:26] way, his time, his season, all those
[1:40:27] things. That's when it's going to
[1:40:28] produce. He says there is no knowledge
[1:40:30] that can do that. Faith alone is
[1:40:32] designed and given to the human race to
[1:40:34] find out what the will of God is. Amen.
[1:40:38] We're talking about absolute power.
[1:40:40] Absolute power requires faith. And that
[1:40:43] faith requires knowing and finding the
[1:40:45] will of God. When you find that, that's
[1:40:47] when it's going to flow. We're going to
[1:40:49] close with this scripture and a quote.
[1:40:51] We're speaking now of a change, a
[1:40:53] difference, a before after comparison of
[1:40:56] when God's worked in our lives. And Paul
[1:40:57] would say in Romans, "There's therefore
[1:40:59] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:41:01] Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
[1:41:03] flesh, but after the spirit. For the law
[1:41:06] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:41:08] has made me free from the law of sin and
[1:41:09] death. For what the law could not do and
[1:41:12] that it was weak through the flesh, God
[1:41:14] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:41:16] sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in
[1:41:19] the flesh. He says that the
[1:41:21] righteousness of the law might be
[1:41:23] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:41:26] flesh but after the spirit. Now this is
[1:41:28] our before after. Okay, before we walked
[1:41:31] in what? The flesh.
[1:41:34] But he says, "Now we walk in the
[1:41:35] spirit." Our before was doing things
[1:41:38] that our body wants. Now we're doing
[1:41:39] what the spirit of God wants. That's our
[1:41:41] before after. That's our weight loss
[1:41:44] before after picture right there. Amen.
[1:41:46] We used to walk in the flesh. Now we
[1:41:47] walk in the spirit. He says, "For they
[1:41:49] that are of after the flesh do mind the
[1:41:52] things of the flesh, but they that are
[1:41:54] after the spirit, the things of the
[1:41:56] spirit." Brother Bam reads this in a man
[1:41:58] running from the presence of God. It's a
[1:42:00] closing prayer. And we're going to close
[1:42:02] with this as well. He says, "And we pray
[1:42:04] that your grace and mercy will be with
[1:42:06] us, Lord, and tender our hearts." Amen.
[1:42:10] We need our hearts kept tender day by
[1:42:12] day. You know, I've had moments
[1:42:16] I have moments, I should say, where
[1:42:18] things will harden unexpectedly and I'm
[1:42:20] like, "Where did that come from? A
[1:42:23] reaction to somebody that has no reason
[1:42:25] for being that way. I have no reason to
[1:42:27] be hardened towards that person." And
[1:42:29] something will harden.
[1:42:31] you know, somebody wants to get in on
[1:42:32] the road and I'm like, "No, I'm not
[1:42:33] letting you in today." Why? Why would I
[1:42:35] not allow somebody in on the road? My
[1:42:37] heart would harden towards them. And I
[1:42:38] say, "Lord, that ain't the spirit of
[1:42:40] Christ. That's definitely the old spirit
[1:42:42] of John Kurlet trying to creep in.
[1:42:43] That's the flesh trying to creep in. I
[1:42:45] got to get where I'm going. You made a
[1:42:46] late change. You should have, you know,
[1:42:49] put it all on them." No, I need a spirit
[1:42:51] of Christ. Soften me. Tenderize me. Not
[1:42:54] just towards people on the road, people
[1:42:55] in the congregation, my brothers and
[1:42:58] sisters. Brother Bram lost his love for
[1:43:00] the people. You know that. Remember he
[1:43:02] talks about that he lost his love for
[1:43:04] the people, his consideration for the
[1:43:05] people. It can be so easy to get born in
[1:43:08] the burden and forget that you're there
[1:43:10] to love and help people. Amen. We need
[1:43:13] to be tender. He says, "Move back all
[1:43:16] the shucks, the thorns, the thistles.
[1:43:19] Let the blessed sunshine of God fall in
[1:43:21] among the word, Lord. And may we have
[1:43:23] such a great meeting till there not be
[1:43:25] an unsaved person among us, and all the
[1:43:27] children will be in the kingdom of God.
[1:43:29] He says, "Those without the baptism of
[1:43:31] the spirit, may they receive it,
[1:43:32] Father." I say, "Amen. Let none go out
[1:43:35] without the spirit of God tonight." Now,
[1:43:37] catch this. He is, it's so beautiful. He
[1:43:40] says, "May all the great mysteries that
[1:43:43] we are supposed to know at this age,
[1:43:45] Lord, be unveiled to us."
[1:43:47] He says, "And we'll see the plainness of
[1:43:51] God."
[1:43:54] There's a there's a saying I've heard
[1:43:56] that when it comes to mystery preachers,
[1:43:58] you know, they're a mystery preacher
[1:43:59] because they preach the mystery and it's
[1:44:00] still a mystery when they're done
[1:44:01] preaching. I say, "Lord, let it be
[1:44:04] plain. Let it be simple." That works for
[1:44:06] me. That's the way I try and bring my
[1:44:08] preaching is to make it plain. Make it
[1:44:10] simple. Make it so you can't miss.
[1:44:13] He says, "We'll see the plainness of
[1:44:15] God." What will the plainness of God do,
[1:44:17] church? Will it lift us up into the
[1:44:19] heavenlies so we can explain all of the
[1:44:21] seven seals?
[1:44:25] He says, "So that we'll know how to
[1:44:28] behave ourselves and act."
[1:44:32] Can we say amen to that?
[1:44:35] Watch. Correcting ourselves.
[1:44:40] That's that's such wonderful advice.
[1:44:43] That's a wonderful effect. When I can
[1:44:45] correct myself and you can correct
[1:44:47] yourself,
[1:44:50] that'll be a wonderful thing.
[1:44:53] That's what we're supposed to do when we
[1:44:54] have communion. Remember, not just at
[1:44:56] communion, but it's supposed to be a
[1:44:59] reflection on where we're at and what
[1:45:00] we're doing, who's winning the battles,
[1:45:03] who's leading the fight, who's got their
[1:45:06] hands on the steering wheel. He says,
[1:45:08] "Correcting ourselves and bringing the
[1:45:10] members of our body into discipline to
[1:45:14] the word."
[1:45:16] That's the plainness of God, church.
[1:45:19] See, we're moving now towards the mind
[1:45:21] of Christ, which is to know what God
[1:45:23] wants done and to simply do it.
[1:45:27] Not to build up a big program, not to
[1:45:29] come up with some big beautiful thing we
[1:45:31] can do, but simply to do what God wants
[1:45:34] us to do and leave the rest behind.
[1:45:38] He says, "And bringing the members of
[1:45:40] our body into discipline to the word
[1:45:42] that we might know how to live in this
[1:45:44] present day at the approaching of the
[1:45:47] Lord Jesus." Amen. God bless you. Let's
[1:45:49] stand together.
[1:45:51] Amen. This was the last year, 1965,
[1:45:55] 10 months almost before he died, and
[1:45:57] he's still praying that the bride of
[1:45:58] Christ will know how to live day by day.
[1:46:01] You know what that tells me, church? It
[1:46:03] matters how we live day by day. Not just
[1:46:05] what we say we know. Not just the
[1:46:07] doctrines we confess, not just the
[1:46:08] theology that we hold. Amen. But how to
[1:46:11] ha behave, how to act, how to be
[1:46:13] corrected,
[1:46:15] to be able to be corrected, church, that
[1:46:17] is a hallmark for a true child of God.
[1:46:19] They can be corrected by the word. They
[1:46:22] don't take it personally, but they take
[1:46:23] it personally. In other words, they're
[1:46:25] not offended by it, but they say,
[1:46:26] "Praise the Lord. He's still talking to
[1:46:28] me." The most wonderful thing we can
[1:46:30] ever experience is when the word
[1:46:32] corrects us, because it means God still
[1:46:33] cares about us. He's still working on
[1:46:35] us. He still wants us to come under that
[1:46:37] discipline and headship of the word. I
[1:46:39] just finished listening to the choosing
[1:46:41] of a bride. And in that message, he's
[1:46:43] talking about the church, the different
[1:46:45] churches. He says he saw the different
[1:46:47] churches going down. He saw the Asian
[1:46:49] one and the one from Switzerland and
[1:46:50] these different ones. He says, "And they
[1:46:52] were all going down to hell." But then
[1:46:54] he said, "I saw the bride." He says,
[1:46:57] "And she was marching to that that that
[1:46:59] song on were Christian soldiers." He
[1:47:02] says, and he says, "Oh, she was the
[1:47:04] word." He says, "Long hair down, flowing
[1:47:07] dresses, beautiful." He says, "But just
[1:47:10] at the end," he says, "they started to
[1:47:13] get out of line." Now, church, we're at
[1:47:16] the end. That means what he saw is our
[1:47:19] age,
[1:47:21] getting out of shape. And he says these
[1:47:24] words, he says, "She started trying."
[1:47:29] That's what got her bent out of shape.
[1:47:30] That's what got her out of line. She
[1:47:32] started trying. He says, "Getting out of
[1:47:36] line." See, that's where we mess up.
[1:47:39] When I start trying to do it, when I
[1:47:41] start trying to control, when I start
[1:47:43] trying to make it happen, when I start
[1:47:46] trying to produce the word and instead
[1:47:49] of just letting it come out the way and
[1:47:51] time God wants it. Amen.
[1:47:54] What is it? We're prone to wander.
[1:47:58] Prone to find our own way. Prone to
[1:48:00] finding a better way. And it never
[1:48:03] works. Amen.
[1:48:06] He wants us to just say, "Lord, this is
[1:48:08] your work.
[1:48:10] You do it. You do it." And just say,
[1:48:14] "I'm taking my hands off, and I'm just
[1:48:15] going to keep walking as you lead, and
[1:48:17] trusting we'll get over the finish line
[1:48:19] together." That's all he wants us to do,
[1:48:21] church. Give up, let go, and follow him
[1:48:25] day by day. Surrender ourselves on a
[1:48:28] daily basis. Amen. Recommmit ourselves
[1:48:30] on a daily basis. Say, "Lord,
[1:48:32] yesterday's yesterday. Today's a new
[1:48:35] day. Your mercies are new every morning.
[1:48:38] Lord, I trust you can use me today." And
[1:48:40] just put ourselves and be ready to be
[1:48:41] used by him. Amen. Day by day. Let's bow
[1:48:44] our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:48:49] Lord, to overcome means to stand the
[1:48:51] test,
[1:48:53] Lord. And we want to be overcomers that
[1:48:54] can stand the test of this Leodysian
[1:48:56] age, Lord. When all that's around us is
[1:48:59] telling us to take matters into our own
[1:49:01] hands, Lord, but your prophet saw a
[1:49:03] bride that started trying instead of
[1:49:05] just doing, Lord, by your spirit. And it
[1:49:08] got her out of line, Lord. She stepped
[1:49:10] back in and we know that. And we're
[1:49:12] trusting you to keep us in line,
[1:49:14] heavenly father. But I pray Lord you
[1:49:15] help us Lord to be able to hear your
[1:49:17] word to be corrected Lord to be able to
[1:49:20] lay down our thoughts and our ideas Lord
[1:49:23] that every day we could take that day
[1:49:25] and just hand it over to you and say
[1:49:27] Lord it's in your hands Lord use me
[1:49:32] hold me direct me guide me
[1:49:35] Lord help us to speak as you would speak
[1:49:38] be silent as you be silent act and react
[1:49:41] as you would heavenly father Lord we
[1:49:44] want people to see that we've been with
[1:49:45] Jesus. Not just been with him, but we're
[1:49:48] still with him. Lord, that we are a part
[1:49:49] of the great I am worthy manifested
[1:49:52] word, Lord. Epistle seen and read of all
[1:49:54] men. Lord, I pray you grant us grace to
[1:49:57] see ourselves in that light. Lord, to
[1:49:59] lift our heads up to recognize that
[1:50:01] everything is under our feet, Lord,
[1:50:04] because we're a part of your body, Lord.
[1:50:06] that when trials come, and they will,
[1:50:08] Lord, hard times come and they will,
[1:50:11] Lord. And this flesh wants to rise up,
[1:50:12] Lord, may we recognize it's under that
[1:50:14] foot as well, Lord. You've given us
[1:50:16] power. You've given us victory, Lord. It
[1:50:19] just takes a surrender heart to let it
[1:50:21] do its job. Lord, I pray you keep us in
[1:50:23] your word. Lord, keep us under your
[1:50:26] anointing. Lord, give us victory day by
[1:50:28] day. I pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:50:31] ask it. Amen. Can we do Jehovah Gyra, my
[1:50:35] provider, 7:22

[1:55:46] I found it all. 1182
[1:56:01] I found it all
[1:56:06] when I lost
[1:56:09] everything and gave my life
[1:56:15] to serve a ris
[1:56:18] king. I found the truth
[1:56:23] that I've been searching
[1:56:27] for. I found it all.
[1:56:32] When I found the Lord,
[1:56:36] I found it all.
[1:56:41] when I lost everything
[1:56:45] and gave my life.
[1:56:48] Hallelujah.
[1:56:49] To serve a rising
[1:56:53] king. I found the truth
[1:56:58] that I've been searching
[1:57:02] for. I found it all.
[1:57:07] When I found the Lord,
[1:57:12] I found it all.
[1:57:16] And I lost everything
[1:57:20] and gave my life
[1:57:25] to serve a rising
[1:57:28] king. I found the truth
[1:57:33] that I've been searching
[1:57:37] for. I found it all.
[1:57:42] When I found the Lord,
[1:57:47] I will praise the mighty name of Jesus.
[1:57:50] 1236.
[1:57:54] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:57] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:57:59] Thank you, Lord.

[1:58:15] My trbled soul,
[1:58:20] why so weigh down?
[1:58:25] Oh, you were not made to bear this heavy
[1:58:30] load.
[1:58:32] [Music]
[1:58:33] So cast all your burdens
[1:58:36] [Music]
[1:58:38] upon the Lord.
[1:58:42] Jesus cares.
[1:58:46] He cares for you.
[1:58:50] And Jesus cares.

[1:58:59] And all your worry won't help you make
[1:59:04] it through.
[1:59:07] So cast all your burdens
[1:59:12] upon the Lord.
[1:59:16] Trust again
[1:59:19] in the promise of his love.
[1:59:24] And I will praise
[1:59:27] the mighty
[1:59:30] name
[1:59:31] of Jesus.

[1:59:42] Praise the rock of my
[1:59:48] salvation.
[1:59:52] My days are in his faithful hands
[1:59:59] and by anxious heart.
[2:00:04] Why so upset?
[2:00:08] When trials come, how you so easily
[2:00:13] forget
[2:00:16] to cast your burdens
[2:00:21] upon the Lord.
[2:00:25] Oh, Jesus cares.
[2:00:29] He cares for you.
[2:00:33] And Jesus cares.
[2:00:36] cares. He cares for you.
[2:00:42] And all your woring won't help you make
[2:00:46] it through.

[2:03:24] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:25] Jesus.
[2:03:26] Praise your name. Hallelujah.
[2:03:28] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank
[2:03:31] you, Lord, for your goodness, Lord, that
[2:03:33] when we fall, you lift us up, heavenly
[2:03:36] father. Lord, that you can let us see
[2:03:38] that all things are under our feet.
[2:03:40] Lord, what a great God you are this
[2:03:42] evening, Lord. How we thank you for your
[2:03:44] goodness, Lord, for your deliverance,
[2:03:47] Lord, for raising us up out of that very
[2:03:49] muck that we couldn't get ourselves out
[2:03:51] of. Lord, we praise you this evening. We
[2:03:53] thank you, Lord, for your goodness to
[2:03:55] us, each one heavenly father.
[2:03:58] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[2:04:00] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:04:02] Hallelujah.
[2:04:03] Amen.
[2:04:04] Amen.
[2:04:07] Before we go, we're going to sing that
[2:04:08] song. and you deserve the glory. 10:25.
[2:04:12] Amen. Was it Brother Vichel that opened
[2:04:14] up in prayer?
[2:04:16] Yes. Okay.
[2:04:20] Uh, Brother Chad, we're going to have
[2:04:21] you close in prayer again if that would
[2:04:23] be okay. Amen. Remember the needs.
[2:04:27] Amen. Some not here today. I'm not sure
[2:04:29] why some of them, but we want God's
[2:04:31] grace to be with them. Each one be with
[2:04:33] Sister Amanda. She travels back. Brother
[2:04:35] Bob, Sister Joe Hansen are coming back
[2:04:37] to our place again tomorrow, traveling
[2:04:39] over the road, playing praying God's
[2:04:41] grace to them. Amen to each one. You
[2:04:43] know your life situations. You know what
[2:04:46] others are dealing with many times.
[2:04:47] Let's just keep each other in prayer
[2:04:49] through the coming week. Amen. God bless
[2:04:51] you. I've also booked travel away for
[2:04:53] October 2nd through the 7th to go to BC.
[2:04:56] They're doing a family reunion as a
[2:04:57] memorial for my grandmother. That was
[2:04:59] the last grandparent we had on mom and
[2:05:01] dad's side. So, we're going to go out
[2:05:03] there for a little bit. Um, Lord
[2:05:05] willing, I'll bring in a a minister for
[2:05:06] that weekend, the Sunday, and we'll see
[2:05:09] how the Lord leads. But, uh, we just
[2:05:11] want him to have his way. Amen. We need
[2:05:14] to start praying about camp as well.
[2:05:15] We've got that coming up. And, Brother
[2:05:17] Paul and Sister Kimberly put a lot of
[2:05:19] time and effort in. We've got a big
[2:05:20] crowd. We could have over 90 this year.
[2:05:23] So, we've really uh, we're going to need
[2:05:25] every hand on deck. And I know we'll be
[2:05:27] there, but keep them in prayer as they
[2:05:28] lock down the details and sort that out.
[2:05:31] and also as brother Aaron Oglesby will
[2:05:33] come up to minister for us again. Keep
[2:05:34] them in prayer just that the Lord would
[2:05:36] have his way. We've got people outside
[2:05:37] of this church. We've got visitors.
[2:05:39] We've got all sorts of people coming.
[2:05:41] So, we just want the Lord to just do a
[2:05:43] wonderful work. Amen. We need to get out
[2:05:45] of here. Amen. That means we need to get
[2:05:47] the last ones in. And I say, Lord, seal
[2:05:49] each one that needs it with the Holy
[2:05:50] Ghost so we can leave. Amen. Amen. We'll
[2:05:53] sing this as we close and Brother Chad
[2:05:55] will come and close in prayer.

[2:10:16] Oh father, you created us for this very
[2:10:19] purpose to praise, love, honor, and
[2:10:22] glorify your magnificent name. Lord,
[2:10:25] thank you, Lord, for what you're doing
[2:10:27] for us, Lord. What you continue to do,
[2:10:29] Lord. I thank you for that tenderness
[2:10:32] that Brother John was talking about.
[2:10:34] Lord, when I see it in my own children,
[2:10:37] Lord, I I'm extremely proud. I can only
[2:10:39] imagine, Father, how much it makes you
[2:10:41] proud when we show that same kindness
[2:10:43] and love towards others. Lord,
[2:10:46] I pray, Father, I pray a special
[2:10:48] blessing for this church. Lord, help us
[2:10:51] get out of the way, Lord, that you could
[2:10:53] do what you intended for the purpose of
[2:10:55] this very church in Newfaland. Lord,
[2:10:59] I pray a special blessing for brother
[2:11:00] John. Lord, pray pray that you continue
[2:11:03] to shelter him, Lord, and in in your
[2:11:06] arms, Lord, and guide him and and help
[2:11:09] him, Father God, and give him wisdom,
[2:11:12] protect his family, Lord.
[2:11:14] I pray, Lord, for Sister Mana as she
[2:11:17] travels, Lord. Give her safe traveling,
[2:11:19] Lord, and keep her safe. And all the
[2:11:21] other prayer requests, Lord, that we put
[2:11:23] before you. We thank you for
[2:11:27] victory in all these matters, Lord.
[2:11:29] Thank you. So as we go now Lord let us
[2:11:32] wake up tomorrow one thing in mind that
[2:11:34] is to please you to serve you to honor
[2:11:36] you and trust you in Jesus Christ's holy
[2:11:40] name. Amen.
