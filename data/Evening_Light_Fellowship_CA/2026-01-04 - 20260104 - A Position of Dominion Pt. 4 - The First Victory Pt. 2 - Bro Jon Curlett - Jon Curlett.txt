And the word says if we were to thank him from the rising of the sun instead of going down the same we wouldn't sufficiently thank him. Amen. But we try. 11:39 Jesus you're the sweetest name of all. Let's stand. Jesus, you're the sweetest [singing] name of all. [music] Jesus, you [music and singing] always hear me when I call. Jesus, [music] you lift me up each time I fall. You're the sweetest. [music] Amen. Name along. Hallelujah. Jesus, [music] you're the sweetest name of all. [music] Jesus, you always hear me when I call. [music] Praise the Lord.

Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus, you always [singing] hear me when I call. [music] Jesus, you lift [singing] me up each time I fall. You're the sweetest, the sweetest [music and singing] name of all. Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, you are our resting place this morning. Lord, we're not resting in our discipline or our works or our good nature, Lord. We're not resting in our rightness, Lord. We're resting in your grace, Lord. We're resting in the fact that you've called us and we have answered, Lord, that you have a purpose and a plan for our life, Lord. And that plan cannot be uh frustrated, Lord. cannot be stopped, Lord, because you've declared it by your word. So, Lord, we're standing on your word this morning, not on anything we've done, Lord. We're living by your grace this morning, Lord, by the life that you've given us by your Holy Spirit dwelling in us, Lord. That's our rest. That's our comfort. That's our peace, our security this morning, Lord God. Lord, and I'm asking for your spirit once again, Lord, to speak to your bride that's gathered here, Lord, this flock, Lord, that you would minister to our lives and our souls, Lord, our bodies, Lord, our minds, whatever we have need of this morning, Lord. You know where the need is, Lord. I pray that your word would be directed to the need this morning. Lord, speak to your sheep, Lord. We pray. Lord, bless [music] the people now. We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would to the Gospel of John, the first chapter. Amen. Good to be here this morning. Just to reconfirm, I believe Brother Bob mentioned we'll have the church votes for the different offices on January 5th. That's Sunday. The Thursday before, we'll have a business meeting and all uh eligible voters are able to come to that business meeting. Brother Mark, our treasurer, will go through the finances of the last year in detail. you can ask your questions there and then he'll do a very short uh well maybe not but it'll be a shorter synopsis on the Sunday after we have the vote. Um and so he'll kind of give some updates there. So we want to remember those in prayer. We've got special meetings coming up next weekend with brother Aaron Oglesby. So, no service on Wednesday, but we'll have service on Friday, Saturday, Sunday with a breakfast on Saturday morning and a fellowship Sunday afternoon in the fellowship hall with food for those that are able to make it as well. So, keep them in prayer. Trust that he'll finally get here. Third, third try is the charm. Amen. He's had trouble getting here in the last two times, so we're trusting that now is the time and that the Lord will bless those things. Amen. It's good to have Sister Justine back. Amen. God bless you and welcome our visitor here this morning. God bless you, sir. Amen. John chapter 1, let's read the first uh we actually read a little more than I have here this morning. And he says, "In the beginning was the word. The word was with God, and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not." Let's go down to verse 9, if you would. He said that was the true light. Speaking of Christ, which lightth every man that cometh into the world, he was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. There are people that accepted him and their birth was not because daddy and mommy decided it. It was that they were ordained by God to do it to to be here to receive his word. It says now in verse 14, "And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory." The glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of two things, grace and truth. Grace because we didn't deserve it and truth because that's what would take us back into him. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. I want to continue this series that we've been preaching on our Sunday mornings called a position of dominion. And I want to take a second service on this thought of the first victory. And it's been a couple of weeks since I preached this first part since we've had the Christmas program and different things going on and some services missed and whatnot. So I I I want to just recap that quickly for those that weren't here or maybe for those that have forgotten what we preached on. But the the last time we preached on this thought of the first victory, we preached out of Genesis 1 and uh where God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. But I want us to step back a bit this morning because we need to recognize what happened there because the first victory we see in the scripture is that God said something that was contrary to what was happening on this earth. He spoke something that was completely different than what the world was like at that time. When God spoke, it was to change the status quo. It had been that way for a long time. I mean, I want you to look into your life. There are some things we're dealing with this morning, and it's the status quo. It hasn't changed in forever. Brother Grant's with me already. There are things that need to be changed that haven't changed. And God in his time and in his season, remember the scripture starts with, "And the earth was without form and void. It was in chaos. It had no no order to it. Things were just the way they were completely covered up." The whole earth was covered in water. But God came down and God said, "Let there be light." And what he spoke was completely contrary to the natural state of this earth. Why? because he had a different purpose, a different condition that was intended for the earth than what it was in at that moment. God had a plan for it. God had a place for it. God had a time for it. God wanted it to produce something. And he started it out by saying, "Let there be light." Because it was complete darkness. There was no light whatsoever. Amen. And when we see that he spoke, he did not just speak words so he could hear them to in his ears. He wasn't just talking to himself. But God spoke a creative word that would change the status quo of this earth. He was going to change the way it had always been into the way that he had ordained it to be. Hallelujah. Can you catch it this morning? Amen. That's a very powerful thought to understand this morning. Because if you can put yourself in the creative word of God, then you'll understand that the status quo means nothing in the big picture. When we look into the eternal, when we see the thoughts of God, the plans of God, they're for our good thoughts of peace. Amen. If we can see what he has said about us, then we do not look at the way it is. We look at the way that he said it's going to be. And we can take thought, we can take we can take comfort from that. We can take rest from that. We can take peace from that because no matter what it is now, it has to be what he says because the creative word of God cannot return to him. Boy, the scripture says, "Amen." Church, if you are a child of God, predestinated from before the foundation of the world to be here, you cannot lose. &gt;&gt; You cannot lose. Amen. You may lose a battle, but you cannot lose the war. Why? Because the unfailing creative word of God has to produce what he said it was going to produce. Amen. We have setbacks. We have days where we feel like a Christian. We have days where we feel like we're not a Christian. We have ups and downs. We have ins and outs. That doesn't matter from the eternal. That doesn't matter. What matters is the finished product. What happens all the way in the end when God has to do with it. What we see today has nothing to do with eternity. It is just a process to get us where God wants us to be. Amen. God's already made a way for you by his creative word to get you to an expected end. That's what the scripture says. The thoughts of God are towards us to bring us to an expected end. That first victory that we see in the scripture was light was created. And remember that light was not the sun and the moon and the stars. Those were created and positioned on the fourth day. Amen. The first light that was created was the light of God. It was the dwelling place of God. We preached on it many times. I won't preach on it again, but that light was the dwelling place of God. And God took all that he was and he poured it into the attribute of light. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He poured it into what we would call the shikina glory, the pillar of fire. And we see this in our scripture that we read at the beginning where it says in the beginning was the word. Remember the scripture says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path." The word spoken by God is the light. He says the word was with God, the word was God. It came out of God and then God stepped into it &gt;&gt; and the word became God. He says the same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him. What? The light. The life of God dwelling in light. He says and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was one thing life. And the life was the light of man. And the light shineth in darkness, present tense. And the darkness, it says, comprehended it not. We look in the in the scriptures in Genesis where it says that the spirit of God moved over the earth and then it spoke. Okay, that was the great eternal spirit of God. Jeho or the the Elohim, the self-existing one and he was without form in the beginning as well. He wasn't he existed but he wasn't visible but when he said let there be light, the first thing he did was make something visible and then he attached himself to that light because that was his attribute. Amen. So that attribute to to make things visible is the attribute of God. And it's what we call light. And it says that light was life because once it came out, life followed that life. That light. When that light was created, then life came forth. The scripture says all things were created by him that were created. Amen. In that form, in that pillar of fire. And so in him was life. And so light of God brings out life. Light of God produces life. Light carries life, we could say, when we're talking about the light of God. Amen. But we look at this first and greatest attribute of God in verse five and look what's happening because it's the most powerful thing for us to recognize is the victory that comes from the presence of God in your life. Amen. Listen to this. Remember verse 5 says, "The light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended not." If you go deeper into it, look at what the amplified says. It says the light shines on in the darkness. It does not stop shining for the darkness has never overpowered it. It has never overcome it. Amen. Darkness has never overpowered light. It doesn't matter how much darkness you have. You can take a little bit of light and it will conquer the greatest darkness. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take much light to conquer darkness. It just takes a light. That's all you got to have a spark. The littlest light is most effective in the greatest darkness. Hallelujah. We might be little lights this morning in this great darkness of this world, but that's what makes us so much more powerful today. When there's lots of light, a little light does no good. But when there's only darkness, little lights are all that's needed. Amen. The only way that darkness can win is for light to cease to exist. Amen. That's hard for us to contemplate. But as children of God, the light that's here is us. Amen. And once we go, all that's left is darkness. There's no light left. We're at the end of the gentile plan of God, the redemptive plan for the Gentiles of God. And once he takes his bride away, all that's left is darkness. And this world will go into tribulation because there's no light anymore. We're so close to the end. And we can see darkness pressing in, can't we? We look around this world and everything this world is doing is darkness. And as a Christian, we can see what they're doing. And it makes no sense what they're doing because it's pressing into immorality that makes no sense. Immorality that is self-destructive policies, politics, society, church, nothing is sacred anymore. Nothing is right. Nothing is righteous. Nothing is good. And we look at it and we say, "How can you not see this?" But what is it? It is darkness pressing in. Why? Because they've rejected the light. That's the unfortunate truth is they've rejected the light. And so everyone's relying on change and hope to change things to make things better. But the problem is this. Our natural condition is selfish and selfishness is always destructive. And so the hope that we have is that we can change our nature because we'll never change this world. We're never going to fix this world. That's why it has to be destroyed. That's what tribulation's about. That's what the fire of God is for is to change this old world back and he'll restore it again. But what he can do is change this nature. And that's what helps us overcome the world. We'll never change the world. We'll overcome the world. That's the requirement for the believer. But you know, I was speaking to someone after I I preached this first service and they said, "I don't really get where you're going with this because what? We're dealing with real issues, aren't we? we're dealing with real issues. It's hard to say uh the light will conquer when young men are dealing with lust. When we've got a mind battle going on, when our attitude is so poor that we can't be around anybody, when our jobs are stressing us out. When things company our company aren't going so good, whatever it might be. And brother John's up there preaching about life. What's that going to do for me? But you've got to understand the process that God uses to bring victory. You've got to understand what he's trying to do. But it can seem a bit academic when we're talking about light. Amen. But you have to see that the battle you face every time is the same. It is light against darkness. It is life against death. It is the word against reason. It's the same thing every time. And what God's trying to do is get us to see what the battle is and how we can overcome it. Amen. Look what Paul said about his conversion experience. The Apostle Paul wrote most of the New Testament. He says, and he's talking about when he was on the road to Damascus and remember a light knocked him off of his horse. And he's laying on the ground looking up and he says, I said, "Who art thou, Lord?" He says that to the light. And the light said, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest." He says, "But rise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of these things in in the which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom I now send thee." Now catch this. He says to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. Says I'm going to do three things it seems like or maybe two. Open their eyes, turn their eyes from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God. But when you look at the original language, it doesn't say and it says that. So in other words, it would look like this. To open their eyes that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God. So no matter what you're dealing with in your life, it's always the same battle. It's light versus darkness. It's the word versus everything else. It's Satan versus God. There's no there's no difference between those battles. They're all going to be exactly the same thing. So deliverance comes by sight. It comes by light. You can't see without light. I don't know if you've noticed this. You can't see in a dark room, but it takes light for you to see. Amen. So, sight comes from light. Faith comes by hearing. And hearing what? By the word. It's going to take light to take us out of the power of Satan into the power of God. And you'll never see things clearly until you see it by the word. How many of you had a situation and we were looking externally the whole time and then God opens his word up to us and all of a sudden we realize, hey, I'm the problem. I remember I was at work and we were doing some leadership training. Funnest thing in the world, leadership training. And they were talking about resolving conflicts and they said, you know, when somebody has a conflict with you, how do you approach it? And people gave a bunch of answers and and and finally I said I said I look and see if maybe I'm the problem. Now that's a big step for a curlet because I don't know if you know the kurletes for those that don't know me my last name is kurlet. Kurletes automatically assume we're right. It's built into us. That's just our nature. Germans we always think we're right. But over time, God has worked on me to the point where I have to realize sometimes I make mistakes. Sometimes John's the problem. And it was funny because at that time I was dealing with a massive issue with a guy at my work whose whose responsibilities they had assigned to me because he was in a conflict of interest and he hated me for it. He was constantly going after me and I was kept trying to to to make things better and do things better and it nothing seemed to work. But I was I was in prayer about it and I said, "Lord, is there anything I'm doing that is making this worse? Is there anything I need to clean up?" So when they were talking to me about leadership and resolving conflict, I said, "The first thing I look at is, am I the part of the problem?" And the person looked at me and they said, "I've never heard anybody ever say that to me." But what does it take? It takes the word to come in and I've got to open up my life so that he can come in and shine the light cuz maybe I've got an attitude problem. Maybe I've got a pride problem. Maybe I've got some issues I need to work through as well. And so it takes him to do that. So the the deliverance that we need comes from the light of the word of God. Young man, you're dealing with lust. What's the answer? Let the word shine into your life. When you got a bad attitude, what's the answer? Let the word shine into your life. When you're struggling with your marriage, what's the answer? Let the word shine into your life. Let it show you the path. Let it show you the truth about the situation. Let it show you the truth about you. I've noticed one thing. If we won't let the word show us the truth about us, it rarely shows us the truth about anybody else. Because if we can't accept it for oursel, then chances are we've got a different filter on when we're looking at our brother or sister. That's the way it works. I preached by experience this morning. Amen. If we won't let it do a work in us, then guess what? He's not going to allow us to to He's not going to use us for a work in somebody else's life either. That's not the way that he's going to do. Amen. When we're dealing with hard times, what's the answer? Let the word show you what's going on. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's the simplicity of it. Amen. In other words, let the word do the work instead of sitting there beating our brains out trying to make everybody else change or trying to figure out what's going on. Jesus put it this way. He says, "I am come a light into the world." That whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. The natural condition of humanity is darkness. The god of this evil age is Satan. He's the one that controls this world, the political parts of it. You know, these different things. We we know these things. But Jesus says you don't have to stay there. Abiding means to to to to continue or endure to remain to dwell. So Jesus came to take us into light into life out of what we were in which means if we're not in light and life then we must be in darkness and death. If he's trying to take us into something then we can't be in there right now. That can't be our starting position. So, whatever situation we're facing this morning, there's only one answer. Come into the light of God's word. And let the truth set you free. Let the truth set you free. Amen. Let the word be the discerner. Let the word be the healer. Let the word settle your heart. Let the word give you peace. Because remember, you're looking to the creative power of God's word that he cannot lie. That what he says he must do. And you're saying, "Lord, let your word happen, not just what I think about it." Amen. Let the word do what you can't do on your own. Isn't that what we're all trying to do? We've got a place we're trying to go. We've got a hell to shun. We've got a heaven to gain, as the song says. We're looking to go in a rapture. How are we going to get there? Not by the works that I'm doing. That's for sure. Jesus would come along. He say, "Listen, without me, you're going to stay in darkness. That's your natural condition. That's your natural place as a human. We're all born in sin. Amen. He says, "And you'll stay in darkness and you'll try and work and you'll work and you'll struggle and you'll try and you'll do this route and that route and up and down and in and out. And in the end, what you're going to do is you're going to go down and you're going to sit down and say, "You know what? Everything I've done hasn't worked. So, I might as well just sit here." Because if you don't have light, you can't see where you're going. You can you have no confidence no confidence in where you're going. So you're just going to end up sitting here and saying, "I've tried everything that I can think to try except one thing. Turn on the lights." And there's only one man can turn on the lights and that's Christ the word. Amen. What we need is Christ the Word, the living light. Amen. Residing in us to overcome these things. That's the only way it's ever going to work. I love what Jesus said and it was a fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah. And he says, "The people which sat in darkness, the people that had given up, the people that know they can't go anywhere, he says they saw a great light." If you're stuck this morning, if you're sitting down, tired of being tired, sick of being sick, he says, "There's a great light." And to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death, light is sprung up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've got something that'll get us out this morning. We've got something that'll take us forward. Amen. Now, what caused this to be fulfilled? Jesus is preaching it in in Matthew 4:16. He's saying this is what's happening. What changed? Isaiah spoke it. Jesus fulfilled it. Calling Jesus on the scene is what brought them into light. Bringing him on the scene is what took them there. It was light coming to the people and separating them out of darkness. It was life coming and taking people out of death. The scripture says there's a way that seems right to a man and the ways thereof are the ways of death. In other words, what we think is the right thing to do is always death as our human. That's it. He says, "I came to get you out of that." Listen to what he said because this was he was speaking this to the Jews. It applies to the Gentiles. But if we look in Isaiah 42, we see something that's specific to the Gentiles. We're Gentiles here this morning. We're not Jews. Anyone that's not a Jew is a Gentile. So that would apply to us this morning. And look at what God said in Isaiah. He said, "Thus sayeth the God, God the Lord, he that created the heavens and stretched them out. He that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it, he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles." This is the great mystery that was hidden was that God had a people. Well, God had a bride that was hidden amongst the Gentiles. And how is he going to bring them out? Light. It was light. Watch what that light would do. That light would open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. So listen, he just said to the Jews, I'm fulfilling the those that sit in darkness. But look, I've got another people coming and guess what? I'm going to take them out of prison as well. I'm going to take them out of darkness and they'll receive what you wouldn't receive. And they'll get the benefit that you wouldn't receive. That's us this morning. Listen to this. He says in Isaiah the 42nd chapter, great light has come. Light, the greatest light that ever shone was shining in that humble little Nazarene. A man with no beauty that we should desire him. A man without education, worldly speaking. A man that knew not the rituals and things of this world, but he could tie demons, raise the dead, and devils tremble. Church, let's put on our spiritual thinking caps this morning. If that's the way he came then, how is he going to come today? &gt;&gt; If that's the way he worked then, what's he going to work in today? A simple, humble people by worldly standards. Not too much to look at perhaps, but that's the way he works. Look at the power expressed through simplicity. He says, "And God recognized him from heaven and spoke back. This is my beloved son, not before the bureaucrats, but before who? A selected group that he had called." He says, "Great light." Why? A greater light was shining from his word. What was the word Christ? He was what? The word brought to life. Now remember, we preached this a couple services ago, but remember what makes demons tremble is not this. &gt;&gt; Those words were written 400, 500, 600, 700 years, a thousand years before Christ came and demons didn't tremble. But what made demons tremble was when those words stepped into flesh. That's what makes demons tremble is when the life of the word comes into reality. That's what made them tremble. Amen. It was the word living in flesh. When God indwells us by the spirit, that's what makes demons tremble because what? Light and darkness cannot coexist. They've got to go. They've got to go. He says, "And the word brought to life gave a greater light than he did when he said, "Let there be light." In Genesis 1, he says that was the light of a creation, a mortal creation, which must fall. But his word was life eternal and light eternal. And when a man believed that, he had eternal light. Okay? I'm going to read something to you this morning. And I'm reading this for the bride. This is for sons and daughters of God. Okay? This is for the elect. This is not for everybody. This is for the children of God. And I want you to hear what Peter said about you by the Holy Spirit. Amen. He says, "You are a chosen generation. You are a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and a peculiar people." But let me say it this way. You didn't know that until one thing came your way. Light. That's it. When light came your way, all of a sudden, you realize he chose me. &gt;&gt; Cuz here's the thing. You didn't find him. He found you. So who did the choosing? It was almighty God. It wasn't me. I've said many times when I was 17, I was looking to leave church. I was looking to leave my family. I was looking for a life of my own choosing. But he came and called my name when I wanted to walk away. So who choose who? &gt;&gt; Did I choose Christ or did Christ choose me? Before we were born, we were a chosen generation. Hallelujah. And what happened? I realized I had more in common with the word of God than with the world. As much as I desired the world, there was something in my soul, in my heart that says I want what the word says. Why? Because light came my way by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's what happened. &gt;&gt; So then I realized I'm chosen. Then what does he say? You're a royal priesthood. You didn't know you were part of the king's family until the king came and said, "My son, my daughter." Not only that, he chose you to intercede for other people. He interceded for you so you can intercede for other people. So all of a sudden, you realize, I've got purpose. I've got a place. I've got something to do. Church, let me tell you this. We're going to vote on offices in a couple weeks. You don't have to have an office to be effective in this church, in this world. You are an intercessor. A priest is always first and foremost an intercessor for those that are around. &gt;&gt; That's your role this morning. Amen. Then he says, "You're a holy nation." Hallelujah. A holy nation. How many of us would stand up and declare, "I'm holy this morning." You don't need to cuz he declared you're holy. And how do you know you're holy? Because he dwells within you. And he cannot dwell in a place that's not holy. He he came down and he justifies you. Says you didn't sin in the first place. It's under the blood of Christ. He sanctifies you. He cleans you up. And then he fills you with his spirit. That's what makes us holy. Not our works, not our discipline. What? It's Christ in me that makes me holy. What a peculiar people. You know what, folks? We're different. We're weird. And we embrace it. We embrace it because we don't want to be like the rest of the world. Cuz they're in darkness. We've come into light. How do you know you're different? Because the word came and said, "You're different." Because you come from me. You come from God. He says, "Why?" That you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you where? out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy. So what's the process? What's the method of calling us into position? Because that's what Peter's just described as people that are called into position. Called into adoption. Called into the placing of sons and daughters of God. How does he do it? Light. &gt;&gt; By his word. Amen. That's what Peter told us. What happened is we came into position. We came into realization. We came into the eternal reality of what God said about us rather than the kernel lie that Satan gave us by our natural birth and by our natural parents and by our natural condition. We saw the eternal and we said, "I'm going to step back into the eternal rather than live by the temporal." &gt;&gt; That's what he was doing for us. Amen. We weren't living the reality of the word. But once we got a revelation, the reality followed. &gt;&gt; Because that's what revelation does is it reveals. It produces itself. Amen. Parents, you don't need to convince your children into Christ. You can't convince your children into Christ. It won't work. Amen. You can't force them to be a Christian. You can't put pressure on them to do it. You can't spiritualize their religious nature or their desire to please you either. That won't work. You know what that does? It builds hypocrites because you're you're endorsing the life without the life. You're endorsing the action without the life behind it. Church, we want our children to be obedient. We want them to be good citizens. But to be a Christian, you need Christ. &gt;&gt; It has to be the person inside of you. Amen. All it does is it produces a a a facade, a shell of religion and spirituality without Christ. And it leads to a life of frustration and hidden lives and not the good kind of hidden life. Amen. Church, when your children become a Christian, they'll start trying to convince others. You won't have to convince them. They'll start convincing others. That's when you know your children have had a new birth. You don't have to convince them of anything. Oh, we still teach, we still train, we still mentor, we still all these things. We're here for their benefit. But what happens is when it starts to come out of them rather than us having to push it in. Amen. That's what we do. That's that that's the only thing we can do as believers. We can only share. We can only offer. We can only shine. And what we trust is that the light will draw light. Children of light, that's it. I'm not here to convert anyone. I'm here to offer life by the word of God and it's up to God to make it work. Amen. Now, here's the hook and I want you to catch this this morning. If you can catch this, you'll catch the message I'm bringing. Too many times we look at this scripture in Peter and the problem is we put it back to a past or single event. We put it back to our new birth. We put it back to our salvational experience. We put it back to when we received Christ, when we got baptized. One of those things, we put it back there. We place the experience of eternal life of light and we put it in a single moment. Now there is a truth to that because when we receive the spirit of God inside of us that seals our soul for eternity. There's an eternal work that's done there and that can never be undone. Your soul is sealed for eternity. Doesn't matter what happens after that. You're going to make it. But there's so much more that comes behind that. Amen. The Holy Spirit confirms us as a child of God. But let me tell you, what happened there is not a one-time event. It's got to be an everyday event cuz I don't need victory yesterday. I need victory today. I don't need peace yesterday. I need peace today. I don't need hope yesterday. I need hope today. I don't need love yesterday. I need love today. I need a present day God. I need a present day experience. And that can only come as we walk in the light with Christ. A daily experience. Amen. I don't want to be effective yesterday. I want to be effective today. And that takes him to walk with us day by day. My victory yesterday tells me there's victory for today, but I want the victory today, not just yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not living yesterday. I'm living today. So, we want to take those things and we don't want to put them back to that moment. We want it every day to be a moment. We want every day to be an experience. Amen. I'm in the present, so I need an everpresent God. And the beautiful thing is that's exactly what he is. He says I am. Not I was, not I will be. He says I am. I'm always there. I'm always present. [snorts] Look at what Paul would say about our battles. We're going to preach on this in far more depth at a different time. But Paul says, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." We we we think about our struggle so many times, and this whole series is on overcoming. It's on it's on it's on overcoming the flesh and the lusts a and the mind battles and the sickness and the situations and the attitudes and the worries and all these different things that are in our life. But to overcome, first we've got to recognize what the battle really is and who and what we're fighting and what defines them. That's how we're going to get the victory. Amen. Paul says, "We're not fighting people. We're not fighting flesh and blood." Amen. We're not fighting worry. We're not fighting stress. We're not fighting hardship. We're fighting principalities and powers. It's a supernatural spiritual battle that is being pushed down into the flesh. That's where the source of our problems. Amen. And so it's a battle that started in heaven with Lucifer that rebelled and God kicked him out with a third of the angels. And now Lucifer comes down here and what's he doing? He's getting us to rebel against God. And that's the battle today is to take that rebellion and turn it into redemption. That's what's trying to happen in our lives. Amen. And and so Satan himself is controlling things on this earth. We're not in the kingdom of heaven on this earth politically, uh naturally, any of these things. The world is in a fallen condition. Amen. We're only in the kingdom of heaven in our souls. Everything else is still subject to Satan's whims. Amen. This body in this earth will pass away. But the soul is eternal with God. Amen. And when this is all said and done, then we go back to our theophies, our heavenly bodies, and we rule and reign with Christ back here on the earth. Now listen to this. He says, "Now this great contest has been going on for many years. It started in heaven and Satan was kicked out into the earth and then he became an enemy to God's people. And since then, he's used all of his strength and his strategy to try and pull God's people into his fires. He's trying to get us worked up. He's trying to get us frustrated. He's trying to break us. He's trying to get us to react to the heat, the pressures of time, of society, of expectations, whatever it might be. He's trying to crank up the heat so that we'll walk away from the light. Walk away from our trust in the word. He says, "And we know who has the most power." Do we know that this morning? You better. We know who has the most power. God does. He says, "And God, when he gave his people the best thing that he could to combat Satan with, it was his word." Because the word is God. And who's stronger than God? He says, "So the word's God and the word becomes our strength." God in the church becomes its strength to pull Satan to his own fires that he has made. He said, "And the tug goes on." But Jesus said in Mark 16, "In my name, they shall cast out devils." What becomes our strength? The word. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. That's what gives us strength. Amen. The exposure of what is real and what is not. Now remember a prophet of God would say he says what is in the heavenly dimension is more real than I can touch with my five senses. Okay? You know I'm an engineer. I was listening to one of the best the the greatest physicists ever yesterday and he was talking about what we think is real and he said, "You know, you take your hand and you put it down on a table." He says, "Now, you say that table is extremely solid." He said, "Did you know you have never touched anything in your life?" You say, "No, no, no. I I touched it. I touched here. I'm knocking on it." You never physically touch it. There's more air in this. There's more gaps in this than there is solidity. But when your hand comes down, you have electrons, you have electromagnetic forces that are all around your hand. This has the same thing. And as you come down to touch, those forces start to push back at each other. So when I knock, I am knocking on electrons repelling each other. There's no touch there. And so we sit here and we say, "This is real, church. You haven't felt anything." And he, the guy made the famous statement. He said, "Judge, I never punched that man and I can prove it by science." He says, "I never touched that man." He says, "And I can prove it by science." Cuz he says, "You can't touch anything because the electromagnetic forces never allow you to actually close that gap to nothing." And there's there's a complex explanation for it. Nature nature abhores a vacuum. If you close it completely, then you would create a vacuum. It would cause all sorts of issues and and whatnot. But you don't actually touch what you think you're touching. So if that isn't real, what's keeping us all together? [laughter] We're sitting here and we're we're we're trusting when we go home that that car is not going to fall apart on us. That we're not going to be hurtling down the road at 60 km an hour and then everything just break apart. What's keeping it together? Unseen forces. And that's just the the electromechanical nature of this world. But he says, "Listen, when you're a when you're a believer, you've got to recognize that what you touch, feel, taste, see, hear is not what you're fighting. There are greater forces that are going on. And that's what you've got to focus on." Amen. That's what's going on here this morning. That's what the real We've got to see when the light of the word comes, it shows us what the real problem is. It shows us what we're really battling. Amen. And we look at Abraham. We preached on this uh last service. Amen. How his strength was not in the evidence of his five senses. &gt;&gt; His strength was not there. His faith was not in circumstances, but rather his faith was in the unfailing word of God to him personally. And the Bible said he was strong in faith giving glory to God. Why was he strong in faith giving glory to God? Because Abraham wasn't trusting his performance. We highlighted all of his failures last service. Abraham wasn't saying, "I'm doing good. God. So, I'm going to give you praise today. In the good times, praise his name. In the bad times, do the same. Cuz it's not about what I'm doing. It's about what he said he's going to do in my life. That's where our rest is. Amen. And the scripture says Abraham was fully persuaded that God was able to perform what he had promised. And day by day, Abraham's getting older and older. God says, "You're going to have a son." 99 years old. And God says, "Abraham, now you're going to have a son. I can't even have intimate relations with my wife, Lord. You're going to have a son in the next year. And he did. Why? Because we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Circumstances are not what matters. You know, I was sharing with some brothers at the New Year's fellowship how that as a minister what we want, this is this is what Satan can use to beat us up at times. We want results. I don't want to preach a year and see no growth in the congregation. I don't want to preach a year and not see people receive the the Holy Ghost. I don't want to preach a year and not see souls saved. I don't want to preach a year and not see people healed. But you know what? That's not my job. My job is to preach the word. &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Listen, one plants, one waters, but it's God that gives the increase. I can't make you a child of God if you're not a child of God. I can't make you obey. I can't make you change your decisions. I can't make you change your mindset. I can't heal you. But he can. And he does. And that's where the trust is. Amen. That goes for every single one of us. We've got to stay in our lane and do what God has ordained us to do. Mothers and wives, where's your lane? Stay in your home. Keep a godly atmosphere. And take care of the home. brothers, what's our godly lane? Provide for and lead our families. That's our lane. That's that's our first ministry. That's our our first requirement. And so often as brothers, as men, we we focus so much on the provision because that's the simpler part. That's the regular expected part. But we've got to lead as much as we've got to provide. We've got to be present in that home. Amen. We've got to to to be able to to take decisions to God and come back with an answer for our family and stand on our own two feet about those decisions. Provision's the easy part. Leadership's the hard part. We've got to be the example for our entire family of what a godly life looks like. Yes, our wife, we rely on them and they are to be an example. They're the sixth go the fifth gospel. But brothers, we've got an obligation to lead our family by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we're spiritual leaders, that we're feeding them by the word of God. Amen. And then life comes not from our efforts. It comes from his presence. We've got to sew the seed. I'm not letting us off the hook, but the results come from him. But we've got to make sure we're sewing seeds. You know, my family and I were having a conversation about creation. a few days ago and you know we talked you know I had somebody was asking me you know was it a literal six days or or was it you know a longer time frame and they had some scientific questions and these different things and a and the question was well if it's literal days then how did how did the the earth bring forth everything to produce food for the animals that would come just a few days later and and it's not really about was it six days or 6,000 years but it was interesting because we we're discussing these things. But when you look back at the scripture, I want you to catch something. Because when he created the grass and the trees and the herbs and these different things, there was no light on the earth. Did you know that? Go back and read it. Because the light comes on the fourth day, the sun, moon, and stars. The third day is when the grasses and the herbs were created. And the earth, it says, brought forth those things without natural light. So what produced them? There was only one light there, church. That was the shakina glory of Almighty God in the pillar of fire moving across the earth. And that brought light up in however many days it was. All we know is it worked. Amen. That light brought life. That life was light. We can put it whichever way you want. But a day later, my wife was listening to the message, a hidden life, and she shared this thought with me and it it really emphasized. She was saying the difference between how we see things and the way we think of things and the way God is. Cuz we put up all these barriers and how can this happen and how could this be and this that and the other thing. God just said if only you knew. If only you knew what I could do. Amen. See, we look at at something as simple as this and we look at the seasons and we look at okay well winter everything's dead. So we'd say they started in winter then spring things came up and and it takes a while. You know you got to have lots of sunlight and warmth and it comes through then it's got to grow. Then it's got to grow. Then it's got to bud and spring forth and then it's got to mature and it's got to dry out and then we harvest it. Then it takes anywhere from from 2 to 6 months. How's that going to happen? But see, here's the thing, church. That's what happens under a natural light. We're not being redeemed back to nature. We're redeemed back to supernature, the supernatural. So we want to look at the supernatural effect, not the natural effect. See, too often that's what we're doing is we're trying to apply a natural effect and get supernatural results. Doesn't work that way. But we go and we look in Numbers chapter 17 to where God is proving to Israel who he's chosen to be the priest for the temple. Are you hearing me? A royal priesthood. And remember what happened is and Kora had rebelled against Moses and Aaron. They said, "Listen, we're as spiritual as you are. And God works with us the way he works with you. So why do you take everything on yourselves?" And the simple answer was because God chose us. &gt;&gt; Moses didn't choose himself. Moses was happy being a shepherd. Aaron certainly wasn't cho wasn't choosing himself. But what happened is Kora rebelled and God came down and he destroyed them. But then God says, "Listen, I want to make a point here. I want to show you who I've chosen." So what he did is he told Moses, he said, "Listen, I want you to go to every tribe and I want you to take a rod, a wooden rod from them, a wooden staff, whatever you want to call it. Each one of them a leader would have that. He says, "And I want you to take those wooden rods and bring them into the holy of holies in the temple where the shikina glory of God was." Okay? In other words, he told them to put Moses to put them in the original light. They've been sitting in natural light for who knows how long and nothing had ever happened to him. But he says to Moses, he said, "Moses, bring those rods into my presence, one for each tribe. 12 rods laid out in front of him, wooden rods. Now, every one of those rods was exactly the same, church. They're made from the same material. They're made from an almond tree. They were dried out. They were completely dead. They were separated from their original source. They were separated from light. They were separated from life. They were separated from water. They had no way to draw nutrients. Dead. Dead. Dead. That's what they were. Okay? They were completely separated from their life source. You could try and tell those rods to produce almonds all day long. You could preach till you were blue in the face and they weren't going to produce almonds. Why? Because they were dead. Okay? It would only the preaching would only confirm that's dead, right? But watch what one night in the presence of God would do. He says, "And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness. He takes him and he places him in the shakina of glory." Remember there's a the Holy of Holies. They had a special veil real thick that crossed in front and in there God would come down and he would dwell. It says, "And it came to pass that on the moral," so in less than 24 hours the next day, Moses went into the tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, brought forth buds, bloom blossoms, and yielded almonds. Church, what does dead mean? Dead means life is absent. That's how you define death. Absence of life. How do you define darkness? Absence of light. The definition of those two things which are both satanic is the absence of something. You cannot produce darkness. You can only extinguish light. You cannot produce death. You can only extinguish life. You can't have a flash dark. I can't shine a flash dark and put darkness here. I can only shine a flashlight. Right? You can't produce darkness. You can only extinguish something. And that's how you get it. Okay? So, when we're dead, what's the only recourse? Life. When we're in darkness, what's the only recourse? Light. Okay, that's the only thing that's going to take us out. Why? Because God is the only source of those things. Light and life are the two original attributes of God. So, we're asking God to come on the scene. And God says, "Moses, bring these dead things into my presence." And watch what happens. In a single night, what the scripture says is that Aaron's rod that was made from an almond tree, it sprouted, it budded, it blossom flowers, and it produced whole ripe almonds overnight. If it was a six day creation, church, that's how you know how it came up. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was it, church? It was never connected to a water source. It was never connected to the ground. It was never connected to a tree. Moses didn't graft it in. What it was was it was connected to the original light and life of Almighty God. That's what it took. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that was going to work. It lay in the presence of Almighty God overnight. And in a night, it produced what it was supposed to be. &gt;&gt; It produced what was inside of it all the time. What it was meant to produce in the presence of God, it produced it right then and there. Church, some of you are struggling to produce things this morning. I only have one answer for you. Get in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Get quiet. Set yourself aside. If you got to walk out of the house, if you got to send the kids to somebody, no matter what you got to do, get in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's the only place there's life. &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that's going to produce it. Amen. Lay everything aside and say, "Lord, I need you. I need you more than anything else. That's the only way it's going to work. Stop trying to produce fruit in your dried out dead condition. Stop trying to produce a results based on your discipline or your works and say, "Lord, I need your life to do what your word says you would do. &gt;&gt; That's the only way we can do it." Amen. You don't need what everyone else is trying to do. You don't need their path, their thoughts, their ideas, their solutions. You need to get in the presence of God. You need the light of the living word to produce the word of God in you. That's the only thing I've got for you this morning. You need a revelation of what it takes to live a Christian life. And that is Christ in you, the hope of glory. It's the only thing. Amen. Why? Cuz when he comes in, the battle's over. Because life conquers death. Light casts out darkness. That's it. It's over. Game over. As soon as he does that. Amen. You know, we play that game rock paper scissors, don't we? We go one, two, three, boom. Scissors, paper, rock. But for every one of those things, there's something that defeats them. Paper covers rock, right? Rock breaks scissors and scissors cut paper. But there's nothing defeats light. And there's nothing that defeats life. That's our champion. That's our answer. Is Christ the living word. Amen. When we're tied into eternal life, you don't have to be where everybody is to produce. And what you'll produce will last. And it's a work of his doing, not a work of your doing. Listen to this. He says he put Aaron's rod in there, an old dead almond tree. He says, "But as it went under the shikina glory, everything it was was restored again." See, too often what we're going back to is the death we came out of instead of the life we came out of. When my mom and dad came together and produced me, that was not life. That was death. If it was life, I would keep living forever. But it is what? It's broken. I can't go back to brokenness for solutions. But there is a deeper thing inside of me. There's a seed of God inside me as a child of God. And I've got to go back to what I was. And the only way I can do that is to come into the presence of the one that produced me in the first place, which is Christ the Word. That's the only way it's going to happen. He says that's the way a sinner is when he goes under the shikina glory of the Holy Spirit. The veil drops behind him and everything he ought to have been a son of God blooms out in him. Again, what old things are passed away? All things are become new. That's the new birth experience. Amen. It's the spirit of God coming in and making you a new creation. He says, remember overnight it budded, blossomed, and grew almonds on it. The fruit of the spirit, love, joy, longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, patience. That's what we need to get in the third step over into the shina glory where that little sacred light was hanging over the mercy seat. Mercy there was great and grace was free. &gt;&gt; Pardon there was multiplied to me. &gt;&gt; There my burden soul found liberty. Where? At the mercy seat. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says that's the place to stay where the pot of mana is set down by the ark. That's the place to live. He says the curtains are dropped behind you. Now remember we preach out of types and shadows in the Old Testament. It's never perfect, but it's close. But we come into the New Testament and we can see something just like this. Absolutely, we can see it. Now, we can see something as simple as we preached before on Mary Magdalene. Seven demons in her and Jesus cast them out and she was a new woman from that point. But I love to go back to the woman at the well because she was messed up. She was broken. She had had five marriages with five divorces. She was living common law. Her life was a train wreck. She's living in the muck of her own consistently bad choices. And that didn't matter at all. Church, dead is dead. Whether you're covered in muck or laying on the ground in Hawaii, dead's dead. It doesn't matter. We're all dead in our natural condition. What matters is will you get in the presence of life and stay there. I love to talk about her because she's a perfect example of what happens when light comes your way. Remember Jesus talks to her. She says, "You're not like other Jews. You you talk to me a Samaritan. You guys don't talk to me." He says, "If you knew who I was talking you, who you were talking to, you'd understand." And he says, "Listen, if you drink what I gave you," he says, "you'd never thirst again." See, she was thirsting for life, church. She was thirsting for life. And she'd been expressing it in every way except life. It was death. And so, he comes to her and he talks to her. He says, "Now watch that woman. Watch these Pharisees and the trained up-ups." You see, they said, "This man is Beelzebub. He's a devil. Look, when that light flashed across that little predestinated seed there, when it struck that real seed of God that before the foundation of the world, her name was put on the lamb's look of life." When it struck that, she quick, he says, quickly she recognized it. But I want you to catch the last bit. in her condition. She recognized it. The condition of your of your your your physical body of your life matters not at all. What matters is there's something on the inside to recognize to receive that light as it crosses your path. And that's what matters more than anything. He says, "Brother, I say that woman knew more about God right then than half the people in the United States." Why? Certainly not because of her good works. Certainly not because of her theology. Because she was ordained before the foundation of the world. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This morning. Amen. That woman we know was well taught in her day. That woman had good spiritual questions. That woman knew her Bible. That woman went to church. Maybe that woman had a good pastor. I don't know. She was raised around the word of God. But that didn't hold her. Parents, are you listening? What's holding our kids is not that they're coming to church. It's good. Keep doing it. But what's going to hold them for eternity is when they come in contact with the life of that word. That's the only way it's going to happen. She knew what was right. She knew what she was supposed to do. She knew the life that she was supposed to be living, but she couldn't live it, church. But I'll tell you one thing. She knew what to expect. Her only hope, her only hope was Messiah. And she was looking for Messiah cuz she said, "When he comes, he'll tell us what you're telling me." What happened? The light shone on her life. And it showed her what her problem was. It showed her the symptom. The symptom was you keep going back to men. The problem was you've got a thirst. The problem was you've got a thirst. See, we're trying to fix the women and the men and the relationships and the lust and the this and the that. That's just a symptom. You've got a thirst that you haven't satiated yet. He says, "If you drink what I'm giving to you, you'll never thirst again. You'll never thirst again." She knew the letter of the word. But church, remember, the letter on its own kills because we can't live it. And so it leads to a life of frustration and condemnation. And we end up sitting in darkness saying, "I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it." And you're exactly right. We can't do it. But under the blood of Christ by the Holy Spirit, see, the letter kleth, but the spirit quickenth. And what happened? What made all the difference? When the spirit came her way, when the living word stood before her, when light flashed across her path, something came to life. She started drinking from a different well. And that thirst was quenched. And all of a sudden, she's doing the convincing rather than being convinced. Just a moment. Amen. She was trying to satisfy her thirst with men, with relationships, with validation. intimacy, all those different things. But that one moment in in the presence of Christ, she realized, I'm a child. I'm a daughter of God, and I don't have to live like this anymore. I don't want to live like this anymore. I won't live like this anymore. Too many times we're doing what that woman's doing, seeking natural solutions to a supernatural thirst. Absolutely. Been there, done that, and if we're honest, probably still doing it in areas of our life. Sure. But it will never satiate. It will never satisfy. And you'll stop you'll you'll finish your drink of whatever that is, and you'll still have something that you're longing for. Why? Because you're thirsting for life. Not entertainment, not validation, not intimacy. No, you're looking for something from the eternities. That's what's the desire in your heart. Amen. The root issue is so many times we're fighting death with more death. [clears throat] Isn't that the truth? You need life to take care of death. You need light to take care of darkness. We're fighting darkness with more darkness. That will never work. It'll never work. It'll just take you into a further and further spiral. And like I said, you'll be sitting on the sidelines in darkness saying, "Where is my God?" You need light. You need life. Amen. We can't do what everyone else in this world does. Let me say it this way. You don't need to do what the brother or sister next to you in the pew is doing. God leads them. Let him lead you. Let him feed you. We've all got different thirsts inside of us. Sure we do. Because we look around, we see where our little mistakes are. Your thirsts are different than mine. But there's something that satisfies those. And it's an eternal life. Amen. It's a It's the word. It's the water of the word. Amen. We're closing here. And I just want to throw this thought out here before we close this morning. Light can be scary. Light can be scary. You know there are some things hate light. Cockroaches hate light. You know what hates light? Unbelief. Our human nature, pride, our genetics. You want some evidence of that? Go look at your social media feed sometime. People only put up the best pictures of the best moments of the this, the that, and the other thing, and they present the best of their life. for everyone to feed on. I've got people post pictures and I don't even recognize them. They've applied so many filters to take away their skin issues and their hair issues and their teeth issues and their nose issues and their weight issues. Why? Because they want people to see them the way they want to be rather than what they are. My wife shared something. She said, "You know, I noticed it's no one in this church. I notic so and so. She'd always post this." I said, ' That's because she wants everyone else to appreciate her, not just her husband. She put all that work into getting pretty to go on a date, and she wants everyone else to see how good she looks. What is it? She's seeking validation. If all we can do is share the best, there's a problem there. Cuz light manifests, it reveals all things. And the simple fact is if we just take a picture, people are going to see the scar. They're going to see the pimple. They're going to see the weight. They're going to see the tiredness, the bags under the eyes. And that's what light reveals. If you put a harsh light on somebody in photography, you know, I do photography. Nobody wants harsh light because harsh light shows every fault and flaw and bad feature. But light is the only answer. Light's the only answer that we've got. If you approach everything trying to hide and not letting the light in, you'll only deal with symptoms instead of roots. You've got to let the light take you into the full depth of it. Jesus said the Holy Spirit would do a number of things, but one of them is that he said he'd lead you into all truth. And if you're a born again child of God, there's one thing you know. The Holy Spirit will tell the truth. He'll tell the truth about you. will tell you the truth about your situations. And too many times we blame things on our our our church history, our genetics, our traditions, our family, our this and that and the other thing. But the simple thing is we need to be able to yield to God's will and word for us to get the results that he's looking for in our lives. Amen. We've got to see the truth of our situations, our lives, our bodies, our health, our relationships, our ministries. all these things through the filter of one thing, the full light of God's word. Church, it's all going to be revealed in the end no matter what. [laughter] I'd rather deal with it now. God help me to have that attitude tomorrow when I he wants to deal with me on something, but I'd rather deal with it now rather than deal with it in front of the entire world. Because the things that were done in secret are going to be revealed. The things that were done in darkness are going to be shown. It's going to come out one way or the other. But the purpose of that light shining on us, so often it feels embarrassing, but it's not meant to embarrass. It's meant to bring life. It's meant to bring us higher. God's got to let us see our real condition, naturally speaking, so he can take us into our original condition. Spiritually speaking, redemption means you got to realize I'm coming out of something and going into something. And if all we say is, I don't need to come out of anything, how can redemption work? It's a process of time. It's an everyday thing that's going on. Amen. You know, too often we can spiritualize things. A name comes to mind even now. People that will spiritualize issues they have and they'll never address it because they made it spiritual and they've tied their spiritual identity to it. instead of just saying, "You know what? I've got some things the Lord needs to take care of in my life." When we can get to that level of honesty, that's when we'll start to see changes. The word is a mirror, not a rifle. It's not to shoot everybody else. It's to look at yourself and say, "Lord, I'm seeing one thing, but when I look in the mirror, I'm seeing something else." When I look in the light of the word, Lord, I'm seeing some gaps. I'm seeing some flaws, seeing some pimples. Lord, help me. I want to read this quote before we close this morning. He says, "We've adopted every kind of an idea, all kinds of schools and theologies and everything when the Holy Ghost ought to be leading us." Now, that's the reason why the church is in the condition it is today. It's being man-led and not spiritled. Sons and daughters of God are led by one thing, the spirit of God. The spirit of God is to lead the church. He says, "Now men might say anything, but the Holy Spirit will tell the truth on you. See, we say the Holy Spirit will tell us the truth, but sometimes he's got to tell us the truth on us. You know, the hardest thing to do is tell somebody you like and admire, "You got a problem." I've had friends come to me and say, "Can I talk to you about something?" And I respect them for that because that's the hardest thing to do is to accept correction. But I believe that's the Holy Spirit in a person's life that can help them help me. But here's the thing. By God's grace, we don't have to have people come tell us if we'll just lay on us and let the Holy Spirit do the telling on us. That's why we come to church. It's a house of correction. It's a house of teaching us what is right. And where we are in error, we just say, "Lord, let your word have its truth. Let your word be right. I don't have that, but Lord, let your word be right. Just like Mary, be it unto me according to your word. That's what the light's here to do. And when that light comes, life always follows. And it's lasting. And it's fruit of the spirit. It's not just temporary works, but it's something that holds. And it keeps producing and keeps producing and keeps producing. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand this morning. [snorts] You know, I've had some rough times in my life where the Holy Spirit told the truth on me. I've had special meetings where it seems like the only person there was me. That's rough. Maybe I'm the only one ever experienced that where it seems like the preacher knew everything that you had going on in the last six months. But I'll tell you one thing, in those moments and in those times, because usually it's not just a moment, it's extended. I had no time to raise my hand and raise my head and look around and say, "Well, sister so and so sure needs some help." Well, brother so and so is sure sliding fast these days. Why? Cuz he's working on me. And if I'm honest, that's probably the best way we can be is is Lord, let's keep the focus on me for when it comes to change when it comes to growth. But the the the beautiful thing about God is that he doesn't because those are humbling moments. He doesn't humble us to keep us down. He humbles us so he can raise us to the position that we have in him that he's ordained for us. But he's got to take everything of us out so he can add all of himself back in. And God's redemptive work is to undo what Satan's been trying to pile on us since the day we were born. And some of us are carrying a lot of things he's piled on us. I'll tell you this, God's here to set us free from prison, to scatter the darkness, to bring life where death used to be. Churches, as I said before, when the Holy Spirit comes into the situation, it's game over. It's game over. The battle's over. The result is guaranteed. Doesn't mean there's not a span of time. But when the light of God's word enters your situation by revelation, that's it. That's it. And the gates of hell can't prevail against it. Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads if we would. Heavenly Father, Lord, I'm asking for your light this morning. Lord, as I've ministered this message you laid on my heart, Lord, I pray that we would just open up our hearts and our souls and our lives and our minds, Lord, and we'd let light shine, Lord. that your Holy Spirit would tell the truth on us this morning. Lord, to go to the root of the issue, the root of the problem, the root of the attitude, the root of our health, the root of our marriage, the root of our jobs, careers, Lord, whatever it might be, Lord, whatever the circumstances are, may your light shine and give us your truth, heavenly father. Lord, and whatever it shows, Lord, I pray you'd help us to accept it. Lord, that we would just look to you to trust your word, your process, your way, your time, Lord, to lay aside everything else that would rise against it, Lord, that life would come forth, Lord. We need you every single day, Lord. And I want us to invite this morning you into every situation of our lives, Lord. You see where our prayers are, Lord. You see where our children are. You see where our jobs and companies are, Lord. You see where our marriages are. You see where our health is, Lord. You see all of these things, Lord. But what I'm asking in all of those things is that your truth would prevail, Lord. That you would expose Satan, Lord, where he has taken hold in our life, Lord. where we are living below our privileges, Lord, where we're struggling and trying and stumbling in the dark, Lord. I pray you bring light this morning, Lord, for when you do, life will follow. Strengthen your people this morning, heavenly father. Minister to them, each one we pray, Lord God, Jesus name we ask and pray. Amen. Pour your spirit out on me. 12:21 Lord, I seek you. Help me find you. How I need your touch.

The people all were weeping. [music] They just laughed at Jesus when he said she's only sleeping. As he took her by the [music] hand, she began to live again. Some began to [music and singing] praise the Lord. And some began to say, [music] "He's [singing] in the house. Death has to flee." [music] Now there is light where [singing] darkness used to be. [music] Now there is hope. There's [music] no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his [music and singing] name. He's in the house. We were like that little girl dead all our sins. [music] So Jesus touched this [singing] heart of mine [music] and gave me life again. I am just a [music] house of faith. But ever since that [singing] blessed day, there's a light that shines in me [music] for all the world to see in the [music and singing] house. Death has to flee.

He's in [singing] the house. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We were like that little girl dead in all our [music] sins. But Jesus touched this [singing] heart of mine and [music] gave me life again. Thank you, Lord. And I am just a [singing] house of plague. [music] But ever since that blessed day, there's a light that shines in me [music] for all the world to [singing] see. He's in the house.
