[47:59] i'll be
[48:04] saying
[48:10] [Music]
[48:15] amen praise the lord trust him we are a
[48:18] sanctuary a man
[48:20] and that he dwells within us it's the
[48:22] only way he's going to get there if
[48:23] you're a predestinated sanctuary
[48:26] through the power knight of the holy
[48:28] ghost so we trust by
[48:30] grace that god saw it and god brought it
[48:32] to pass amen
[48:34] god made it made it a reality by the
[48:37] grace of god
[48:38] so lord bless us to be in prayer for the
[48:40] going forth of the word
[48:42] and surely we're not going to be able to
[48:44] get all that i want to say
[48:46] and when it comes to the scriptures and
[48:49] some of the thoughts and the quotes by
[48:50] brother branham
[48:51] so i want really what are you going to
[48:54] talk on
[48:55] well i'm going to try to bring us some
[48:56] thoughts on whether we're religious
[48:59] or spiritual amen and again
[49:03] there's lots of religion but how much
[49:05] says they're
[49:06] spiritual in our lives or in the world
[49:09] and where we're living there we get a
[49:11] lot of people sometimes we meet a lot of
[49:13] people in our lifetime
[49:14] they're very religious but not very
[49:16] spiritual so we pray the grace of god
[49:18] that we're going beyond religion
[49:20] to be spiritual and the problem of god
[49:23] delilah
[49:23] he said the church is religious and the
[49:26] church is religious
[49:27] but he said they're not spiritual and
[49:29] lord willing we'll try to give you some
[49:31] thoughts on that as well
[49:32] concerning what the prophet has said and
[49:34] he did preach
[49:35] on adoption and he was bringing out
[49:37] those things in in that series
[49:39] concerning the church
[49:40] versus people the church versus the seed
[49:44] of god
[49:45] amen and he did say again he said that
[49:47] the church is religious
[49:49] and i'll tell you this it's unfortunate
[49:51] that uh that too many believers around
[49:53] this message
[49:54] have gone from being spiritual to
[49:56] religious oh yeah they're very they can
[49:58] be very religious
[49:59] but not very spiritual in their
[50:01] understanding not very spiritual in the
[50:03] leadership they have in their lives
[50:05] so we pray the grace of god to give us
[50:07] the understanding that
[50:08] that assures us that we are spiritual
[50:11] amen
[50:12] we're spiritual in our in our hearts and
[50:14] our souls and if we are
[50:15] we'll be spiritual in our thoughts words
[50:17] and deeds amen
[50:19] so god be with us and help us that we
[50:22] will be
[50:23] and get more and more spiritual the
[50:25] closer we get to the rapture
[50:27] and the resurrection that means you're
[50:29] getting more spiritual amen
[50:31] it's as it was in jesus day he was
[50:33] dealing with a lot of religious people
[50:35] you know the jews and so on
[50:38] but there were not many very spiritual i
[50:41] want to share with you there's a lot of
[50:42] scriptures and i thought well i
[50:44] maybe i'll i'll meet uh brother jonathan
[50:46] garlett's
[50:48] uh thoughts and ideas and maybe i'll be
[50:50] i'll be like him because he
[50:52] was bringing out a lot of scripture and
[50:53] that was good amen
[50:55] read this scripture read that scripture
[50:56] that's good amen because faith comes by
[50:59] hearing the word
[51:00] amen so we appreciate our brother's
[51:02] ministry
[51:03] amen putting the emphasis on on the word
[51:06] of god
[51:07] amen and whatever he thought he's going
[51:09] to minister on and as ministered on you
[51:11] want to prove it by the word
[51:13] amen there's one thing there's one thing
[51:15] to to know about
[51:16] what god is saying in the message of the
[51:18] hour again
[51:20] like these here and so on or the prophet
[51:22] said the prophet said
[51:23] but we better find it here amen because
[51:27] his ministry was ordained to get us back
[51:29] to the word
[51:30] amen and in the word we're going to get
[51:32] the faith that god wants us to have in
[51:34] this hour
[51:36] oh brother it's not just back to
[51:37] theology and doctrines and this teaching
[51:40] of that teaching no
[51:41] it's back to the word that's ordained of
[51:44] god to give us the faith
[51:45] for the resurrection and the faith for
[51:47] the rapture
[51:48] amen so to god be the glory we
[51:50] appreciated our brother jonathan's
[51:52] ministry
[51:53] and there was a lot of word word word
[51:55] word
[51:56] a lot of scriptures and i said well lord
[51:58] i guess i'll have to
[51:59] share share the a lot of scriptures with
[52:02] the people
[52:03] amen and i saw continue on i said
[52:06] from where our brother jonathan started
[52:09] amen
[52:10] and i don't think he'll ever be finished
[52:11] here it'll be finished in eternity
[52:14] amen but in our brother's ministry i
[52:16] really appreciated
[52:17] the reading of the scriptures coming to
[52:19] the scriptures coming to the scriptures
[52:21] and then brother yes it's good that we
[52:23] can get back to the quotes
[52:25] amen showing that god a man through the
[52:28] prophet amen
[52:29] preach what was needed to get us back to
[52:31] the word oh yeah he preached what was
[52:33] needed
[52:34] to get to give us what to give us
[52:36] resurrection and rapturing faith
[52:39] to preach what was needed to give us the
[52:41] faith that pleases god
[52:43] brother not not even wesley pentecost
[52:45] and all the others
[52:46] no no but it's the brideage amen
[52:49] god did that for luther that for wesley
[52:52] that for the pentecostals and many
[52:53] others out there
[52:54] but what's he doing for us brother
[52:56] whatever whatever is next in line
[52:59] amen he said i will restore so he
[53:01] restored this restored that restored
[53:03] this restored that
[53:04] now what's he restoring amen in you and
[53:07] in me
[53:08] amen i trust that our lives are going to
[53:10] be a reflection
[53:11] amen not a religion but of spirituality
[53:15] amen a reflection of the power knowing
[53:17] of the holy ghost
[53:19] taking control of the bride amen praise
[53:22] the lord
[53:23] so the lord bless us as we go into the
[53:26] word but
[53:27] also want to just express my
[53:28] appreciation for brother jonathan and
[53:30] the ministry
[53:32] that he shared with us amen to god be
[53:35] the glory
[53:36] and as i said let me say it again that i
[53:38] really appreciated his emphasis on the
[53:40] scripture
[53:41] amen and leading us from to the to the
[53:44] word leading us to the word the written
[53:45] word
[53:46] and uh well yes then then he would go
[53:48] and point us to the revealed word
[53:50] amen so god bless our brother and we
[53:53] certainly would appreciate again
[53:55] aaron our brother's ministry so we thank
[53:57] the lord for that
[53:59] amen and uh god bless
[54:02] oh god sister selena
[54:06] uh oh anyway i appreciate it
[54:09] or singing and i believe god was in it
[54:11] amen oh yeah because it went from her
[54:14] to you amen the anointing praise the
[54:16] name of the lord
[54:18] so also just to uh bring you greetings
[54:21] from our brother carr
[54:22] and it was uh almost two weeks ago now
[54:25] that he called me
[54:26] and i spoke with him and he was
[54:29] explaining the
[54:30] what they're dealing with concerning
[54:31] colbert 19 and
[54:33] at the time i don't think they're having
[54:35] much when it comes to the
[54:37] services in the church and because of
[54:40] the issue there and we know that it has
[54:41] increased since then
[54:43] and in new brunswick so we pray the
[54:45] grace of god
[54:47] to our brother carr and sister carmen
[54:49] because
[54:50] other sister but brother carmen because
[54:52] they
[54:54] brother as i said by the car ministers
[54:56] on sunday
[54:57] but by the carmen ministers on wednesday
[54:59] so we pray the grace of god to them
[55:01] today
[55:01] and what they're doing exactly i'm not
[55:03] sure maybe they're not even in church
[55:05] today
[55:06] because things are sort of getting worse
[55:08] in new brunswick
[55:10] so we pray the grace of god to our
[55:12] brother carl
[55:13] and to the saints in new brunswick amen
[55:16] and also uh to
[55:20] remind you uh concerning
[55:24] you see brother after i finish
[55:26] ministering here
[55:27] i did offer him the possibility of
[55:29] ministering
[55:30] or not coming to minister but just to
[55:32] come before i preached
[55:34] but then we change the two after i
[55:36] preach amen brother paul
[55:39] after i finish the message brother paul
[55:41] is going to take a few minutes to
[55:43] explain to you concerning
[55:44] some things regarding the business
[55:46] meeting on monday night
[55:48] amen so he wants to share that with you
[55:51] and that's good
[55:52] you can take maybe i said you can take
[55:54] an hour
[55:55] before i get up amen
[55:58] so he can take as long as he wants he
[56:00] said five minutes well
[56:03] that that's almost impossible for a
[56:05] believer
[56:08] you know to get up and just just give a
[56:09] five minute testimony
[56:11] no no what we thank god that he's given
[56:14] us the grace and the wisdom to know what
[56:16] to say when to say it
[56:18] because again as i spoke with him last
[56:20] night and
[56:21] to a point of time either before me or
[56:24] after me
[56:25] and i said yeah i said i've been in
[56:27] churches i said if you're going too long
[56:29] maybe we'll sing you down
[56:31] and because i've been in churches and
[56:34] and
[56:34] in testimony meetings oh yeah and i've
[56:37] experienced that
[56:38] in in the church i was raised in in the
[56:41] church i went to pentecost
[56:42] and the salvation army and i've
[56:44] experienced it even in a message church
[56:47] and where many got up and testified and
[56:49] they all preached
[56:51] yeah they were sit standing there but
[56:52] they were preaching
[56:54] and brother in in the denominational
[56:56] churches i was in i do remember
[56:58] the experience of somebody in in the
[57:00] congregation
[57:01] doing what you're going to sing them
[57:02] down oh yeah
[57:04] whether it's salvation army or pentecost
[57:07] and they preached
[57:08] they testified testified testified then
[57:10] all of a sudden some brothers sitting
[57:12] in the in the church we start singing
[57:16] amen amen praise the lord so
[57:19] we won't do that to brother paul
[57:22] no yeah so so thank god for the for the
[57:26] grace
[57:26] and the patience that amen yeah he said
[57:29] you have need of patience
[57:31] and i guess the churches have sung down
[57:32] the testimonies they never had the
[57:34] patience
[57:35] amen so thank god and again i know i can
[57:38] remember it now
[57:40] i was in a church and and a
[57:43] denominational church
[57:44] and her brother got up and testified
[57:46] testified testified
[57:47] and then he sat down and the pastor got
[57:49] up the preacher got up
[57:51] and he said praise god he said well
[57:54] a double he used his gun he said a
[57:56] double barrel
[57:57] and he said double a double shot he said
[58:00] he had he didn't shoot once he shot
[58:02] twice
[58:02] he said he had to go that long in his in
[58:04] his testimony
[58:06] amen so but again again like i said i've
[58:09] heard it being sung down
[58:10] and uh and there are again i guess
[58:13] believers that would sing down
[58:15] they're going for the word and they feel
[58:18] it's that's enough
[58:19] so they'll they'll sing down to preacher
[58:22] but i haven't i haven't seen that in the
[58:23] message
[58:24] thank the lord maybe i'll be the first
[58:26] one
[58:28] amen so the lord bless us let's stand
[58:33] so and now we are being prayed for

[1:07:50] seated turn with me to
[1:07:52] to third john
[1:07:56] third john and we'll read the first four
[1:07:59] verses
[1:08:01] amen
[1:08:07] praise the lord
[1:08:11] amen god make it more and more real to
[1:08:14] us
[1:08:14] concerning the resurrection amen that's
[1:08:17] that's that's what's ordained to take us
[1:08:19] out of here
[1:08:20] amen and the rapture so i pray god amen
[1:08:23] as as
[1:08:24] much as luther focused on justification
[1:08:27] and the pentecost and the gifts and the
[1:08:28] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:30] let us focus on the resurrection and the
[1:08:32] rapture amen
[1:08:34] and the invisible union of the heavenly
[1:08:36] bridegroom
[1:08:37] and the earthly bride amen god make it
[1:08:40] real to us
[1:08:42] and in third john and verse 1 the elder
[1:08:45] unto the well-beloved gaiest whom i love
[1:08:48] in truth beloved
[1:08:52] i wish above all things that thou mayest
[1:08:55] prosper
[1:08:57] and be in elf even
[1:09:00] as thy soul prosper amen
[1:09:05] what we're experiencing naturally will
[1:09:07] be a reflection of what we have
[1:09:09] spiritually for i rejoice greatly when
[1:09:12] the brethren came and testified of the
[1:09:15] truth
[1:09:16] that is in thee even as thou walkest
[1:09:19] in the truth amen what a testimony
[1:09:23] and he said i have no greater joy than
[1:09:26] to hear that my children
[1:09:28] walk in truth amen and the truth
[1:09:31] is the revealed word amen god bless you
[1:09:34] may be seated
[1:09:37] and turn with me to colossians chapter 1
[1:09:46] amen
[1:09:49] colossians chapter 1.
[1:09:54] and i want to read the first few verses
[1:09:56] and i was thinking maybe that
[1:09:59] brother had referenced to maybe verse 9
[1:10:03] we'll see we start with verse 1
[1:10:07] and i have a number of scriptures here
[1:10:09] that i want to share with you about
[1:10:10] concerning being spiritual amen
[1:10:14] not religious but spiritual as the
[1:10:17] prophet of god said he said the church
[1:10:19] is spiritual
[1:10:20] and not spiritual he said the church is
[1:10:22] religious
[1:10:23] but the bride is spiritual amen so be in
[1:10:27] prayer as we go through the scriptures
[1:10:29] and i'm not sure we'll get into the
[1:10:30] messages on spiritual amnesia
[1:10:33] or the spiritual food in due season
[1:10:35] we'll see as the lord leads us
[1:10:37] amen but brother we pray in the grace of
[1:10:41] god
[1:10:41] that we are spiritual not religious
[1:10:45] religious when it comes to being
[1:10:46] religious all you're going to all you're
[1:10:48] going to walk in
[1:10:48] is is what's going to happen on a
[1:10:50] wednesday night or on a sunday
[1:10:52] oh yeah we go to church on wednesday we
[1:10:54] do this we do that
[1:10:55] and we go to church on sunday you're
[1:10:57] just being religious
[1:10:58] but if we're spiritual we got a hunger
[1:11:00] and a thirst for fellowship
[1:11:02] if we're spiritual we want to hunger and
[1:11:03] thirst we want to go to church we want
[1:11:05] to be
[1:11:06] in church as the proud of god he was
[1:11:08] noticing the difference
[1:11:10] and now that was moving away from the
[1:11:12] people he said there was a time he said
[1:11:14] when we would
[1:11:15] leave the service he said on a sunday or
[1:11:17] whatever and he said
[1:11:18] he remembers seeing the believers out
[1:11:20] there outside the church and they were
[1:11:22] and they were hugging one another and
[1:11:23] they were crying
[1:11:24] and so oh my i won't see you no more now
[1:11:27] until sunday
[1:11:28] i won't see you no more until wednesday
[1:11:30] oh and why because they wish that they
[1:11:32] could see
[1:11:33] and fellowship with another more and
[1:11:35] more and more and brother if we got the
[1:11:37] holy ghost
[1:11:38] i'll tell you it's a hunger for for
[1:11:40] jesus it's a hunger for god it's a
[1:11:42] hunger for his word
[1:11:43] and it's a hunger for fellowship amen
[1:11:45] that you want to fellowship with your
[1:11:47] brothers and sisters
[1:11:48] in the faith amen so i pray the grace of
[1:11:51] god that will not lose that kind of
[1:11:53] anointing in our hearts
[1:11:55] and in our souls that we're not going to
[1:11:57] move from the realm of being
[1:11:59] being spiritual to the realm of just
[1:12:01] being religious
[1:12:02] amen and religious only oh you can be
[1:12:05] religious
[1:12:06] and you can talk about this doctrine and
[1:12:07] that doctor another doctrine
[1:12:09] but i tell you this it's going to take
[1:12:10] being spiritual to get into
[1:12:13] into why god has revealed all these
[1:12:15] things
[1:12:16] amen it's not just for the sake of
[1:12:17] doctrine it's not just the sake of this
[1:12:19] and that
[1:12:20] for the for the ministry oh yeah yeah no
[1:12:22] it is to give us faith
[1:12:23] because faith comes by hearing the word
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:26] it's like i mentioned a number of times
[1:12:29] that that's what god gave luther
[1:12:31] and to give him the faith and the
[1:12:33] revelation of justification
[1:12:35] because again he thought it was
[1:12:37] something that he had to do
[1:12:39] but then god brought into the word to
[1:12:41] show that jesus already did it
[1:12:43] amen praise the name of the lord and
[1:12:46] same thing in in wesley's age same thing
[1:12:48] in the pentecostal age jesus
[1:12:50] already did it amen but he's moving us
[1:12:53] on to a greater
[1:12:54] revelation amen by the grace of almighty
[1:12:56] god
[1:12:57] amen so i pray god by grace is moving us
[1:13:00] on to the revelation that we need
[1:13:03] amen brother we we thank god for the
[1:13:06] revelation of this doctrine that
[1:13:07] doctrine
[1:13:08] but again what is god working on in this
[1:13:11] hour what is god working on in this age
[1:13:13] amen what was god working on in the
[1:13:15] ministry of william branham
[1:13:17] and just just to think that there i
[1:13:20] don't remember i don't think i don't
[1:13:21] know of any other minister saying
[1:13:23] well i only got three polls to my
[1:13:25] ministry i
[1:13:26] i i got to do this i got to do that and
[1:13:29] i just waiting on the lord to see what
[1:13:31] he wants me to do
[1:13:32] because i know that other evangelists
[1:13:34] are there and brother rem was
[1:13:36] doing evangelistic work but any and he
[1:13:39] went on to a certain
[1:13:40] certain time evangelist evangelist event
[1:13:43] then he
[1:13:44] left evangelism and went into the
[1:13:45] revelation of the word a prophetic
[1:13:47] ministry
[1:13:48] but then after god was finished with a
[1:13:50] prophetic ministry
[1:13:51] amen it was it may be december 1963 or
[1:13:55] 64.
[1:13:56] the problem of god said now he said here
[1:13:58] i go he said back into evangelism
[1:14:01] amen he went and he did the first poll
[1:14:03] the second bull
[1:14:04] and amen his ministry changed in the
[1:14:06] third part
[1:14:07] in the revelation of the word the
[1:14:09] mystery of god amen
[1:14:11] and then after the mystery of god he
[1:14:13] went on he said to evangelism again
[1:14:15] amen but brother amen but brother god's
[1:14:18] not looking for a change in you and me
[1:14:20] like that no ways that we're looking for
[1:14:22] an evangelistic ministry
[1:14:24] we're looking for this kind of a
[1:14:25] ministry that kind of amen no no the
[1:14:27] bride don't need that
[1:14:28] we need we need the teaching a teacher's
[1:14:31] ministry we need a pastor's ministry
[1:14:33] and so on what for amen though all the
[1:14:35] other
[1:14:36] ministries have done what god wanted
[1:14:37] them to do now he wants us
[1:14:39] that ministry to come on us to teach us
[1:14:42] amen what we need
[1:14:43] amen a brother that came down and gave
[1:14:46] luther what he needed wesley what he
[1:14:47] needed the pentecost was what they
[1:14:49] needed amen
[1:14:50] so what do we need now because
[1:14:52] hallelujah god said i'm going to restore
[1:14:54] i'm going to do this i'm going to do
[1:14:55] that amen
[1:14:56] if he's done that brother move on amen
[1:14:59] that's another step
[1:15:01] as an you know move forward keep your
[1:15:03] eyes on the door
[1:15:04] amen as i said he said he openly opened
[1:15:06] the revelation
[1:15:07] so that we can we can say in the glory
[1:15:09] we can see into eternity we can see
[1:15:11] into the kingdom of god so don't don't
[1:15:13] go aside this way that way no stay
[1:15:16] in line amen by the grace of almighty
[1:15:19] god
[1:15:20] amen now again it's like brother had
[1:15:23] division concerning that
[1:15:24] that sister or you know brother brown
[1:15:26] was standing at the three steps
[1:15:28] he had three pulls to his ministry and

[1:16:09] light amen

[1:17:19] so we'll go off into that we'll go off
[1:17:21] into that and become the denomination
[1:17:23] oh yeah there are many denominations
[1:17:24] around the message amen
[1:17:26] and they have this and they have that as
[1:17:28] i said and it's coming to that
[1:17:30] place now where where they said oh the

[1:17:34] the founder of our religion was this
[1:17:36] brother and that brother in pentecost
[1:17:37] and and i said yeah it's getting to that
[1:17:39] place around the message amen
[1:17:41] oh this is our religion
[1:17:44] and the founder was william branham
[1:17:47] brother
[1:17:48] brother god never sent him to give us a
[1:17:50] religion amen god sent him to give us
[1:17:53] the spiritual revelation

[1:18:47] wednesday whatever no
[1:18:49] it's you that god's working on amen and
[1:18:52] coming into the church in the ministry
[1:18:54] is god ministering to you more and more
[1:18:56] and more of what he requires of you
[1:18:58] amen he's ministering to you more and
[1:19:01] more what you need
[1:19:02] amen you got to recognize what you need
[1:19:05] and brother we got to go beyond natural
[1:19:07] needs and physical needs to our
[1:19:08] spiritual needs
[1:19:11] because too many are still focusing on
[1:19:12] the natural oh lord lord if
[1:19:15] we do this you do this you do this we'll
[1:19:17] do this and so on
[1:19:18] brother god wants you to focus on what
[1:19:20] he's doing and what he will
[1:19:22] do because why because he wants to use
[1:19:25] you to do it amen he wanted to use
[1:19:28] martin luther to do it he wanted to use
[1:19:29] john wesley
[1:19:30] go and preach it and live it amen bring
[1:19:33] into the pentecostas go
[1:19:35] preach it and live it amen and move on
[1:19:38] move on move on
[1:19:39] but unfortunately that third or fourth
[1:19:41] generation that settled down
[1:19:42] and went into denomination they were oh
[1:19:44] yeah they just felt that
[1:19:46] we're worth we believe that thank you
[1:19:47] lord amen we believe what luther said
[1:19:50] and that was it but they never realized
[1:19:51] god was moving on
[1:19:53] amen they thought god was going to stay
[1:19:55] with them
[1:19:56] no no god was going to move on and god
[1:19:59] wanted them to stay with him
[1:20:01] amen not god stay with them and keep
[1:20:03] blessing him and there's
[1:20:05] the time when god has done that but
[1:20:07] brother there's also a seed that he's
[1:20:08] moving on
[1:20:09] amen amen so there there were some
[1:20:12] lutherans that did move on to wesley
[1:20:14] and there were some where wesley people
[1:20:17] meant
[1:20:18] bride revival you're not right but
[1:20:20] wesley revival
[1:20:21] individuals have moved on to the
[1:20:23] pentecost and as i said let me say it
[1:20:25] again
[1:20:25] praise the lord just to show that god
[1:20:27] was in control not man
[1:20:29] brother when you consider that william
[1:20:31] booth and and
[1:20:33] and even his wife when she preached they
[1:20:35] both preached amen
[1:20:36] what did they do they fought they
[1:20:38] focused they were pointing us to
[1:20:40] pentecost oh yeah they not
[1:20:43] did not there was no recognition of a
[1:20:45] pentecostal church then
[1:20:46] but they were showing what we needed was
[1:20:49] what they had on the day of pentecost
[1:20:52] amen well brother thank god he gave it
[1:20:54] to us
[1:20:55] he gave it to he gave us justification
[1:20:57] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:20:59] ghost
[1:20:59] amen but now he's given us more
[1:21:02] hallelujah
[1:21:03] oh yeah they took that the faith of that
[1:21:06] and they moved on moved on moved on
[1:21:08] giving god the glory
[1:21:09] amen amen and now brother
[1:21:12] are we moving on moving on giving god
[1:21:14] the glory for what he's revealed to us
[1:21:17] amen brother god oh my we can be
[1:21:19] faithful in justification
[1:21:21] you're gone amen
[1:21:24] brother just think no doubt there's many
[1:21:26] he says they're going to fall under
[1:21:28] fall and says to the mountains fall on
[1:21:30] us
[1:21:32] fall in us and hide us from the face of
[1:21:34] him that sits
[1:21:35] on the throne amen because they knew
[1:21:38] they didn't follow his teaching
[1:21:40] they knew that they they didn't follow
[1:21:41] and acknowledge his presence
[1:21:43] in luther or wesley or or pentecost and
[1:21:46] they haven't acknowledged his presence
[1:21:48] in the bride in these last days amen and
[1:21:52] now
[1:21:52] and again brother the importance is to
[1:21:54] what is to recognize what
[1:21:56] he is doing amen brother
[1:21:59] luther cut the revelation what he did
[1:22:00] what he was doing in luther's age
[1:22:02] wesley's age
[1:22:03] the pentecostal age amen they were
[1:22:05] caught up with what god did
[1:22:07] and was doing but now i trust that the
[1:22:10] bright
[1:22:10] is caught up with what god has done and
[1:22:12] is doing
[1:22:13] amen brother we got we got what the all
[1:22:16] the others had and we're moving on
[1:22:18] we got what they had we're moving on
[1:22:20] we're going amen
[1:22:22] amen you might as well say goodbye
[1:22:25] because any time now you could be gone
[1:22:28] amen but anytime now you gotta you gotta
[1:22:30] look up keep looking up
[1:22:32] and i'll tell you that's the only ones
[1:22:33] that are going we should not all sleep
[1:22:36] but we should all be changed and the
[1:22:37] only ones are those who are looking up
[1:22:39] and they're looking for it amen they
[1:22:42] can't get it out of their hearts they
[1:22:44] can't get if you've got it in your heart
[1:22:45] you won't get it out of your mind you
[1:22:47] got it in your heart you're spiritual in
[1:22:49] your heart
[1:22:49] you'll be spiritual in what you're doing
[1:22:51] and you're in your actions reactions
[1:22:54] and your thoughts words and deeds amen
[1:22:57] brother so that the revelation controls
[1:22:59] you amen the revelation controlled
[1:23:02] william branham amen because after they
[1:23:05] owe me the seals
[1:23:06] he preached this he preached this and he
[1:23:08] preached that and he said this is just
[1:23:10] another revelation of the seals
[1:23:12] amen the mystery amen so that to the
[1:23:16] right is no longer a mystery
[1:23:18] no no brother we ought we ought to be
[1:23:21] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:23:22] light
[1:23:23] and if we are walking in the light as he
[1:23:25] is today brother
[1:23:26] then there's nothing going on in there
[1:23:28] that's a mystery to us we know
[1:23:30] amen because amen because what god has
[1:23:33] done what god has revealed
[1:23:34] amen is the omega of the alpha
[1:23:38] oh yeah god god revealed the alpha
[1:23:41] now in our our time he has revealed the
[1:23:44] omega
[1:23:44] ministry of our lord the omega
[1:23:46] revelation of our lord
[1:23:48] amen brother let's get caught up in that
[1:23:51] revelation
[1:23:52] amen and we're we're losing contact with
[1:23:55] the world
[1:23:56] amen definitely you're not interested in
[1:23:58] what the world's doing and what's going
[1:24:00] on in the world
[1:24:01] you just committed all to the lord move
[1:24:02] on amen by grace
[1:24:05] that's why that's why god sent the
[1:24:07] prophet down into hebrew and
[1:24:09] he had to get them to focus on god focus
[1:24:11] on on the promise
[1:24:12] amen and brother and god did signs and
[1:24:16] wonders and
[1:24:17] did this did that to get him out of
[1:24:19] egypt amen
[1:24:20] don't look back amen remember
[1:24:24] lot's wife amen
[1:24:27] brother i pray the grace of listen
[1:24:29] abraham was spiritual but
[1:24:31] but a lot was religious amen
[1:24:35] and lord's wife was religious amen
[1:24:38] because they weren't going to take the
[1:24:40] stand for the word of god for god
[1:24:42] that abram was taking that's right that
[1:24:45] is the absolute truth
[1:24:46] amen because why they were focusing on
[1:24:49] the natural things of life
[1:24:51] and whatever makes my life a natural
[1:24:53] whatever makes that life better
[1:24:55] i want that thank you lord thank you if
[1:24:57] that's all you want that's what he'll
[1:24:58] give you
[1:24:59] yeah and they'll take you to hell amen
[1:25:02] because you're not focusing on him and
[1:25:04] what he wants
[1:25:05] amen they're focusing on god so also god
[1:25:08] will bless my natural life got to do
[1:25:10] this and got to do that
[1:25:11] brother i'll tell you this your
[1:25:13] spiritual life is
[1:25:15] i thought about it i've been on my heart
[1:25:17] to to minister on it this
[1:25:18] spiritual walk amen oh my brother sister
[1:25:22] it's not easy
[1:25:23] amen no wonder paul said you have need
[1:25:26] of patience
[1:25:28] amen because you're going to go through
[1:25:30] tribulation you're going to go through
[1:25:31] this you're going to go through that
[1:25:32] you're going to you're going to have to
[1:25:33] endure this and you endure that amen
[1:25:36] if you stay with god and i'll tell you
[1:25:37] it's going to get worse and worse and
[1:25:39] worse it's gonna get more
[1:25:40] amen well god requires you're gonna get
[1:25:42] greater and greater
[1:25:44] amen the closer we get to the rapture
[1:25:46] why
[1:25:47] why is god allowing that because he
[1:25:49] wants us to look hope
[1:25:51] amen why is god allowing that because he
[1:25:53] knows
[1:25:54] that we need it to get us to focus on
[1:25:56] glory to focus on the word of god
[1:25:58] to focus on the resurrection to focus on
[1:26:00] the rapture amen
[1:26:02] grace of god that is not a fairy tale
[1:26:05] brother i tell you because if you become
[1:26:07] religious it becomes a fairy tale
[1:26:10] if you become religious it's just a
[1:26:11] doctrine oh yeah
[1:26:13] but brother god has taken us away from
[1:26:16] the religion
[1:26:17] to a spiritual walk with him why so that
[1:26:20] we know
[1:26:20] what's going on we know that the rapture
[1:26:22] is not up there the rapture is here
[1:26:25] probably god said rapture is going on
[1:26:26] all the time amen
[1:26:28] and the resurrection is going on we're
[1:26:30] just waiting for the hour when they'll
[1:26:32] appear to us and we'll seal
[1:26:34] amen praise the lord because as the
[1:26:36] prophet said they're only right there in
[1:26:37] that dimension
[1:26:38] amen so we need a faith to break through
[1:26:41] that dimension
[1:26:43] yeah but and to have a faith that'll
[1:26:45] break from from this dimension to that
[1:26:47] one amen
[1:26:48] we've got we got to really really really
[1:26:50] be turned over to the lord
[1:26:52] under his control amen so that again and
[1:26:56] again and again
[1:26:57] it's not me or you that lives is christ
[1:26:59] living in you
[1:27:01] amen and believing that oh yeah brother
[1:27:04] jonathan corlett he didn't minister to
[1:27:05] us
[1:27:06] it was christ ministering to us amen it
[1:27:08] was christ
[1:27:09] in the ministry ministering to you amen
[1:27:12] you can read that in the scripture
[1:27:14] concerning the faithful ministry amen
[1:27:16] that god has said in the church
[1:27:18] and if god's sitting in the church god
[1:27:20] is in it god is controlling it
[1:27:23] amen praise the name of the lord god
[1:27:26] help us
[1:27:26] that we're going to focus sincerely on
[1:27:28] the word we're going to really hunger
[1:27:30] and thirst from more of the word
[1:27:32] we're really going to feed on the word
[1:27:35] amen amen
[1:27:36] not brother not religion but spiritual
[1:27:39] the holy ghost
[1:27:41] let us be spiritual and not religious
[1:27:44] amen the scribes and pharisees and so on
[1:27:47] they were religious
[1:27:48] jesus was spiritual that's why jesus
[1:27:51] told them is to do what they say but
[1:27:53] don't do what they do
[1:27:55] you know take the word but don't take
[1:27:56] them amen
[1:27:59] because why because the spiritual walk
[1:28:01] became a religious walk
[1:28:03] oh it's all religion amen that and
[1:28:06] they're entering religion
[1:28:08] that they oh yeah you know what they
[1:28:09] were believing oh god's going to bless
[1:28:11] this god is going to do this god's going
[1:28:12] to do that
[1:28:13] but they never took in what god really
[1:28:15] wanted to do
[1:28:17] amen why because they never recognized
[1:28:20] their name
[1:28:20] they didn't recognize them the messiah
[1:28:22] coming to redeem them like jesus did
[1:28:25] oh yeah they they're looking for the
[1:28:27] messiah but they're looking for a
[1:28:29] messiah to come and deliver them
[1:28:30] out of the control of the romans amen
[1:28:33] that's right that's what that's what
[1:28:34] they were looking for
[1:28:35] oh if he's the messiah he'll do this if
[1:28:37] he's the messiah he'll do that
[1:28:38] no well jesus went on and preached and
[1:28:41] preached some preach
[1:28:42] till they did what he was to do amen
[1:28:45] and he let go lord not my will thyme be
[1:28:48] done
[1:28:49] amen why because if it was the will of
[1:28:52] jesus physically speaking
[1:28:54] oh yeah he'd have deliverance he'd have
[1:28:56] a great ministry and he have a great
[1:28:58] church and they have greatness amen yeah
[1:29:00] but it was great was god in simplicity
[1:29:03] amen they never recognized god in
[1:29:06] simplicity
[1:29:06] and really even the disciples didn't
[1:29:08] recognize it until after
[1:29:11] he rose from the dead amen
[1:29:14] praise the name of the lord well they
[1:29:16] were they believe you messiah and he
[1:29:18] would do this and he would
[1:29:19] perform signs and wonders and oh my give
[1:29:22] them this give them that
[1:29:23] but he had to do it by laying down his
[1:29:26] life
[1:29:27] and pick it up again he had to let down
[1:29:30] for them
[1:29:31] he had to lay it down for us so he could
[1:29:32] pick it up and share it with us
[1:29:34] amen oh no he couldn't share with us
[1:29:37] unless he laid it down and picked it up
[1:29:39] again
[1:29:40] and what manifesting the power over the
[1:29:43] world the flesh the devil
[1:29:45] manifesting the power over death and the
[1:29:47] grave
[1:29:48] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:29:52] you like a song i was airing a sermon
[1:29:54] some sisters and a couple brothers

[1:30:32] gentleman one time where they were
[1:30:33] digging a grave
[1:30:36] and and they dug it right next to
[1:30:37] another one and oh
[1:30:39] the coffin was rotted but they could
[1:30:41] still they could still see
[1:30:44] the form of a body there and then he
[1:30:46] said we're doing this
[1:30:47] all of a sudden he said that that body
[1:30:50] went down
[1:30:51] and he said down into the dust oh yeah
[1:30:54] i said dust there are to the dust shall
[1:30:56] root thou return amen
[1:30:57] so where was that person if he was right

[1:31:03] age
[1:31:04] oh yeah the prophetesses say they will

[1:31:36] ministry of the seals
[1:31:37] what's he doing what's the result of
[1:31:40] those seals
[1:31:41] amen is to get the attention of the
[1:31:43] bride
[1:31:44] for the rapture and the resurrection
[1:31:47] amen
[1:31:49] brother what a faith that god requires
[1:31:51] of us

[1:31:55] of luther
[1:31:57] furby earned whether he required a
[1:31:59] wesley or the pentecostals just think
[1:32:04] but there's too many i'm religious
[1:32:08] i i believe there's going to be a
[1:32:09] resurrection yeah there's many believers
[1:32:11] there's going to be a resurrection but
[1:32:12] that's right because they're the ones
[1:32:13] that are going to say oh after they see
[1:32:16] something else out there
[1:32:17] it besides colbit 19 after they see
[1:32:20] other things going on
[1:32:22] oh where's the rapture i thought there

[1:33:02] on
[1:33:03] to another dimension if they're going to
[1:33:06] be part of the rapture
[1:33:07] if they're going to be part of the
[1:33:08] resurrection during fellowship with the
[1:33:11] saints

[1:33:16] and i believe and again i believe that
[1:33:18] most of those most of believers i
[1:33:19] believe
[1:33:20] they're gone on those that are going to
[1:33:22] be part of what god has done in this
[1:33:24] hour in this age
[1:33:25] those that are going to be part of the
[1:33:26] resurrection rapture they're going on
[1:33:29] this is getting fewer and fewer and
[1:33:31] fewer i'll share i want to share some of
[1:33:33] those thoughts with you

[1:33:39] concerning what's coming that should put
[1:33:41] us on our guard

[1:33:50] and and we know god sent the prophet and
[1:33:51] he did this and he did that
[1:33:53] oh yeah but then the prophet preached to
[1:33:55] his own church
[1:33:58] three kinds of believers he preached his
[1:34:01] own church
[1:34:03] there's only going to be a few going
[1:34:04] into rapture

[1:34:10] leave
[1:34:11] he would go before and knowing that in
[1:34:14] his generation
[1:34:15] he said to our brother lee vale he said
[1:34:17] brother
[1:34:18] he said most of the old folks around
[1:34:20] this message will die
[1:34:23] before the rapture before the
[1:34:24] resurrection
[1:34:27] he said because they won't have that
[1:34:29] faith
[1:34:31] he said for the rapture they won't have
[1:34:33] that faith for the resurrection
[1:34:35] he said god is going to take them before
[1:34:37] that time
[1:34:39] this that's grace amen

[1:38:33] to the to the earth
[1:38:36] dust to dust yeah by the grace of god
[1:38:39] never realized that but now
[1:38:42] i thought and i said lord i said they

[1:48:02] do not cease to pray for you amen
[1:48:05] and to desire that ye might be filled
[1:48:08] with the knowledge or the
[1:48:10] full knowledge of his will
[1:48:13] not a part of it the full knowledge amen
[1:48:18] in all wisdom and notice and spiritual
[1:48:22] understanding
[1:48:26] so do you you got an intellectual
[1:48:28] understanding
[1:48:30] based on the mechanics of the word what
[1:48:33] about a
[1:48:35] spiritual understanding based on the
[1:48:38] dynamics
[1:48:40] amen is it the is the mechanical
[1:48:43] anointing on you that's receiving the
[1:48:45] word or is it a dynamic
[1:48:47] anointing on you acknowledging the word
[1:48:51] amen so brother
[1:48:55] let me read that again i'm not sure i
[1:48:57] believe brother jonathan might have
[1:48:58] referenced this scripture
[1:49:00] verse 9 for this cause also we also
[1:49:04] sense the day we heard it
[1:49:06] do not cease to pray for you and the
[1:49:08] desire that ye
[1:49:09] might be filled with the full knowledge
[1:49:12] amen
[1:49:12] of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:49:16] understanding brother we that's what we
[1:49:19] need
[1:49:21] when it comes to knowing what god is
[1:49:23] doing what god
[1:49:24] will do we need a spiritual
[1:49:26] understanding not intellectual knowledge
[1:49:28] of the message
[1:49:29] not the mechanics but the dynamics
[1:49:32] that's what we need brother
[1:49:36] whether it's your your pastor whether
[1:49:38] it's our brother jonathan here i'm
[1:49:39] registering the word
[1:49:40] regardless whether somebody could be
[1:49:42] testifying to you
[1:49:44] amen brother we we we need
[1:49:47] to be filled with the knowledge of his
[1:49:50] will
[1:49:51] in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:49:53] understanding
[1:49:55] you need the wisdom of god and the
[1:49:56] spiritual understanding of god to catch
[1:49:58] the word lord are you talking to me lord
[1:50:02] is that for me to pay attention to
[1:50:05] lord help me to see me see myself in the
[1:50:07] word
[1:50:08] help me to see lord

[1:50:19] just love me when love is corrected
[1:50:23] if you love a child you correct the
[1:50:24] child
[1:50:26] amen why because love is corrected
[1:50:29] amen so again this is what struck me i
[1:50:33] think the other night and i'm not sure
[1:50:34] if brother jonathan
[1:50:36] mentioned this scripture but
[1:50:40] i had it underlined in my bible but in
[1:50:42] blue so i went and got a red
[1:50:44] pen to underline it in red
[1:50:48] amen that it says that ye might be
[1:50:51] filled are you filled with the full
[1:50:54] knowledge
[1:50:56] of god are you filled with the full
[1:50:59] knowledge of his will

[1:52:01] increasing
[1:52:02] in the knowledge of god praise the name
[1:52:06] of the lord

[1:55:31] perfected our love so that we love him
[1:55:33] back with the same love
[1:55:35] grace
[1:55:38] verse 10 but god hath revealed them
[1:55:42] unto us by his spirit for the spirit
[1:55:46] search at all things yea the deep things
[1:55:49] of god
[1:55:50] amen for what man knoweth the sins of a
[1:55:54] man
[1:55:55] save the spirit of man which is in him
[1:55:58] even so the things of god
[1:56:00] knoweth no man but the spirit of god
[1:56:04] amen so we need the holy ghost to know
[1:56:07] the things of god
[1:56:08] we need the holy ghost to really
[1:56:11] know god amen we need the holy ghost to
[1:56:15] really have a fellowship with god
[1:56:18] and experience with him oil
[1:56:23] grace in the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:56:26] amen is christ coming in to take control
[1:56:29] of you
[1:56:30] so that you can truly say oh yeah as the
[1:56:33] bible says
[1:56:34] sons and daughters of god are led by the
[1:56:36] spirit of god
[1:56:38] amen so are you led by the spirit
[1:56:42] you control what you do when you do
[1:56:43] where you do it how you do it
[1:56:45] god help us amen no wonder he said
[1:56:49] straight is the gate narrows the way
[1:56:51] and few there be that find it
[1:56:54] straight is the gate narrow
[1:56:57] is the way and now
[1:57:01] again it's like that woman that went up
[1:57:02] those three steps
[1:57:05] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:57:07] of the holy ghost
[1:57:08] yeah and she started to walk oh
[1:57:12] she figured oh yeah i can walk there's
[1:57:13] no problem there
[1:57:15] the step was you know and the path was
[1:57:17] so so wide
[1:57:19] but she started to walk and walk
[1:57:22] and finally she noticed that this that
[1:57:25] it was getting
[1:57:26] more narrow not that it looked narrow
[1:57:29] it was narrow and that the more she
[1:57:32] walked and walked the mark the narrower
[1:57:34] the path came until i got to the place
[1:57:36] where
[1:57:37] should she oh my just so narrow she
[1:57:39] could barely walk walk and stay there
[1:57:41] and down below was fire
[1:57:45] yeah and she kept on walking but lost
[1:57:49] her balance
[1:57:52] fell into the fire god help us
[1:57:55] amen because it started wide
[1:57:58] maybe with luther or wesley and
[1:58:01] pentecost
[1:58:02] is getting more narrow now with this
[1:58:04] revealed word it's even more now
[1:58:07] god help us amen
[1:58:11] to be led by the spirit
[1:58:15] again verse 10 god hath revealed them to
[1:58:18] unto us by his spirit for the spirit
[1:58:20] search at all things
[1:58:23] yea the deep things of god amen
[1:58:26] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:58:30] save the spirit of man which is in him
[1:58:32] even so the spirit of god
[1:58:34] knoweth no man but this
[1:58:37] but the spirit of god the things of god
[1:58:41] i'm sorry
[1:58:42] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:58:46] but the spirit of god amen
[1:58:50] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:58:52] the world
[1:58:53] but the spirit which is
[1:58:56] of god amen god help us
[1:59:02] do you have the holy ghost
[1:59:06] amen did the holy ghost control your
[1:59:09] living
[1:59:10] the holy ghost control what you do when
[1:59:12] you do it how you do it
[1:59:15] are you really in constant fellowship
[1:59:17] with god
[1:59:18] and he's there to counsel you he's there
[1:59:20] to advise you he's there to encourage
[1:59:23] you
[1:59:23] there to give you this understanding of
[1:59:25] his will
[1:59:27] grace we're coming that hour now
[1:59:31] not my will father but thine be done
[1:59:35] and again i heard on some
[1:59:39] article concerning what's going on in
[1:59:41] the world right now
[1:59:43] and there was a an article came out and
[1:59:45] they were saying this this and this was
[1:59:47] taking place
[1:59:48] in certain parts of the world i said oh
[1:59:52] i said lord we are really closer to the
[1:59:55] end than what we think
[1:59:58] because as i said you might go to go to
[2:00:00] bed tonight with money in the bank and
[2:00:02] wake up tomorrow with nothing
[2:00:06] and there was some article that i heard
[2:00:08] or seen or read
[2:00:10] and oh my i said they're going to do
[2:00:13] that to a certain area of the world
[2:00:15] right now
[2:00:16] and a couple of countries that were
[2:00:17] planning on doing this because when it
[2:00:19] comes to money
[2:00:21] and a lot of emphasis is on money right
[2:00:23] now that's why the
[2:00:25] our federal government was promising to
[2:00:27] to send
[2:00:28] payments for this payments for that
[2:00:29] pencil to help help the people that are
[2:00:31] suffering financially
[2:00:33] in their needs because of covert 19 and
[2:00:36] there's a lot
[2:00:38] oh i said lord it's not just the
[2:00:42] the seriousness of what went on out
[2:00:43] there i said in colburn 19
[2:00:45] when it comes to the germ warfare but i
[2:00:47] said now i said it's getting right down
[2:00:48] to even to the money
[2:00:54] rather i trust it's not you that lives
[2:00:55] as christ living in you
[2:00:57] so he's going to have the right attitude
[2:00:58] and right spirit but brother i tell you
[2:01:00] this
[2:01:02] out there they're taking control
[2:01:08] it's later than you think
[2:01:12] amen don't make plans for great plans
[2:01:15] for our lives here
[2:01:17] brothers coming to an end
[2:01:21] and and that brother if all that's gone
[2:01:23] on now and is going on in the world
[2:01:25] i trust by grace and you see you
[2:01:27] understand
[2:01:28] that what we have preached for years is
[2:01:31] now coming to pass
[2:01:35] definitely
[2:01:39] it struck struck me when i was hearing
[2:01:41] that and i said what
[2:01:43] i said lord i said there's more
[2:01:44] happening now than what we think
[2:01:47] there's more prophecy being fulfilled
[2:01:49] than what we think yes
[2:01:52] brother we better keep our eyes on the
[2:01:53] lord
[2:01:55] amen i pray we want joy it's not money
[2:02:00] you want joy it's not your worldly
[2:02:01] concessions it's the lord
[2:02:05] it's yours today it's theirs tomorrow
[2:02:08] it might be might be theirs already but
[2:02:11] they haven't
[2:02:12] that's right but they haven't moved to
[2:02:14] to do this do that
[2:02:16] grace to us amen
[2:02:21] and again verse 11 what man knoweth the
[2:02:25] things of a man save the spirit of man
[2:02:28] which is in him
[2:02:29] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[2:02:32] but the spirit of god
[2:02:34] and to know the things of god you need
[2:02:35] the spirit of god
[2:02:38] now we have received not the spirit of
[2:02:40] the world
[2:02:41] but the spirit which is of god that we
[2:02:44] might know the things
[2:02:46] that are freely given to us of god
[2:02:50] amen and it says which things also we
[2:02:54] speak
[2:02:55] not in the words which man's wisdom
[2:02:57] teacheth but which the holy ghost
[2:02:59] teacheth
[2:03:00] amen comparing spiritual things with
[2:03:03] spiritual amen i trust we have that
[2:03:07] anointing of the holy ghost to compare
[2:03:09] spiritual things with spiritual
[2:03:13] but the natural man receiveth not the
[2:03:15] things of the spirit of god
[2:03:17] that's true for they are foolishness
[2:03:19] unto him
[2:03:20] and neither can he know them because
[2:03:22] they are spiritually discerned
[2:03:24] amen if you don't have the holy ghost in
[2:03:27] your soul you're not
[2:03:28] going to discern what's going on in the
[2:03:29] world
[2:03:31] amen you might see this and oh yeah this
[2:03:33] is happening that's happening
[2:03:34] but yet there's the more important
[2:03:36] things that's going to have a greater
[2:03:38] influence
[2:03:39] on you amen maybe you're not seeing that
[2:03:43] oh lord that's doing they're doing this
[2:03:44] they're doing that yeah yeah what are
[2:03:46] they doing to you
[2:03:49] god help us it's going to be so
[2:03:51] deceiving
[2:03:54] god have mercy on us amen
[2:04:01] excuse me
[2:04:07] yeah again verse 14 the natural man
[2:04:09] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[2:04:11] of god
[2:04:15] now let's go back to verse 13 which says
[2:04:17] also we speak
[2:04:19] not in the words which man's wisdom
[2:04:20] teacheth but which the holy ghost
[2:04:22] teacheth
[2:04:23] what's he teaching you comparing
[2:04:25] spiritual things
[2:04:26] with spiritual but the natural man
[2:04:29] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[2:04:31] of god
[2:04:32] for they are foolishness unto him and
[2:04:34] neither can he know them
[2:04:35] because they are spiritually discerned
[2:04:38] if you don't have the holy ghost there's
[2:04:40] a lot going to happen and come to pass
[2:04:42] prophecy be fulfilled and you won't see
[2:04:43] it you won't recognize it
[2:04:46] but if you've got the holy ghost it'll
[2:04:47] put you on your garden on your toes
[2:04:50] but he that is spiritual judget all
[2:04:53] things
[2:04:54] amen yet he himself is judged of no man
[2:04:58] for who hath born who hath known the
[2:05:01] mind of the lord
[2:05:02] that he may instruct him but we have the
[2:05:05] mind
[2:05:06] of christ amen pray in that grace that
[2:05:09] you have the mind of christ
[2:05:11] you're going to see it as christ see
[2:05:12] that you're going to act as christ acted

[2:05:18] that thus amen in these temptations

[2:05:40] amen stay with the word
[2:05:44] we have the mind of christ and i tell
[2:05:46] you
[2:05:47] a lot of believers don't oh yeah

[2:05:55] is that kind of mind that people see in

[2:06:05] the mind is it the result of the mind of
[2:06:07] christ well if the mind of christ is in
[2:06:09] you you can't think your own thoughts
[2:06:12] it's going to christ thinking in you and
[2:06:14] you're going to react with christ in you
[2:06:16] you'll do this you'll do this
[2:06:18] yeah it's not you it's christ in you
[2:06:22] thank god amen this is serious
[2:06:25] i'm reading these scriptures because
[2:06:27] it's serious too often we just take it

[2:06:32] granted oh yeah
[2:06:34] they read it and go on they read it and
[2:06:36] go on no you need to read it and let
[2:06:38] if it's god in you and he's trying to
[2:06:41] convict you
[2:06:42] ask the lord to correct it ask the lord
[2:06:46] to make the word flesh in you
[2:06:49] amen and chapter three
[2:06:52] bear with me we'll have to bring it to a
[2:06:56] close
[2:06:59] and verse 1 and i brethren could not
[2:07:02] speak unto you as unto spiritual
[2:07:05] but as unto carnal even as
[2:07:08] unto babes in christ do we have the
[2:07:12] maturity of sons and daughters
[2:07:15] to think and act like sons and daughters
[2:07:16] to talk like sons and daughters amen
[2:07:19] are we still babes
[2:07:22] there's a lot of believers there's still
[2:07:24] babes oh yeah
[2:07:27] he said i have fed you with milk and not
[2:07:29] with meat
[2:07:31] for other two we were not able to bear
[2:07:33] it neither yet now
[2:07:34] are ye able that's the truth they can't
[2:07:37] bear the word
[2:07:38] not the bright can
[2:07:42] for ye are yet colonel for whereas there
[2:07:44] is among you
[2:07:46] envying strife and divisions
[2:07:49] are ye not carnal and walk as men
[2:07:52] hallelujah oh lord grace
[2:07:56] give us the holy ghost that we rise
[2:07:57] above all of this amen
[2:07:59] amen so that the nature of my mom and
[2:08:02] dad is not in me
[2:08:04] in control it's the nature of amen
[2:08:08] it's the nature of jesus amen
[2:08:11] but too many are still going and they're
[2:08:13] walking living and talking
[2:08:14] like their mom and dad they're still
[2:08:17] still reflecting
[2:08:18] that nature oh yeah
[2:08:22] but if you're born again that nature is
[2:08:24] put down and the new nature takes over
[2:08:26] well that new nature is still there but
[2:08:29] you got a holy ghost nature that
[2:08:30] controls it
[2:08:31] amen amen amen thank god amen
[2:08:36] oh who do you turn after you turn after
[2:08:39] mom dad grandma grandpa who do you turn
[2:08:43] after
[2:08:44] i turn after jesus
[2:08:47] amen how many of us can have that can
[2:08:49] have that
[2:08:50] testimony that you that you're that
[2:08:53] oh yeah you're born of god
[2:08:57] whether you're born of god god's in you
[2:08:59] amen listen
[2:09:00] see why because when you're if you're
[2:09:02] truly born again the old nature is put
[2:09:04] out
[2:09:05] the new nature comes in amen and jesus
[2:09:08] is sitting in your heart in control
[2:09:10] and as i said and what there's a battle
[2:09:12] going on between the
[2:09:13] between your brain and and the soul
[2:09:15] between the brain and the soul
[2:09:17] the devil's in the brain doing this and
[2:09:19] god is in your heart jesus is in your
[2:09:21] heart
[2:09:21] oh yeah when the devil says this jesus
[2:09:23] brings up the word
[2:09:25] amen the devil says this again oh
[2:09:28] and again jesus comes up with the word
[2:09:30] amen praise the lord
[2:09:33] hallelujah and i think brother john said
[2:09:36] don't fight the devil
[2:09:38] just rebuke him with the word yeah
[2:09:41] it is written it is written amen if you
[2:09:44] want to fight him you'll never stop
[2:09:47] amen but if you give him the word you
[2:09:50] walk away
[2:09:51] and he's troubled but not you amen
[2:09:55] you got the peace of god that fasted all
[2:09:57] understanding
[2:09:58] amen praise the lord hallelujah so
[2:10:01] brother let's go and reflect jesus
[2:10:04] it was christ it liveth in me oh so oh
[2:10:07] if he's living in you
[2:10:08] you act like him you talk like him you
[2:10:10] react like him oh it's wonderful praise
[2:10:12] the lord that's why
[2:10:13] i that's why i think you're i've noticed
[2:10:16] that you
[2:10:16] you're a christian well by the grace of
[2:10:19] god
[2:10:20] amen praise the lord hallelujah
[2:10:24] so for ye are not for ye are yet colonel
[2:10:27] he's talking to the corinthians
[2:10:30] and paul dealing with the corinthians
[2:10:31] were dealing with a lot of carnality
[2:10:33] they were religious but they weren't
[2:10:36] spiritual
[2:10:37] amen and so paul through his testimony
[2:10:40] and through the
[2:10:42] ministry of the word that he was given
[2:10:43] he was trying to get them to move away
[2:10:45] from the carnality and put god in
[2:10:46] control
[2:10:48] amen not man
[2:10:52] and that's why he said ye are yet
[2:10:53] colonel for whereas there is among you
[2:10:57] envying strife divisions
[2:11:00] are ye not carnal and walk as men yeah
[2:11:04] you're still still got the attitude
[2:11:06] nature of us of a sinner
[2:11:08] yeah grace of god
[2:11:12] for while one saith i am a paul another
[2:11:15] i am of apollos
[2:11:17] are ye not carnal oh i'm a brother
[2:11:20] branham no
[2:11:21] he wouldn't want that he rebuked that
[2:11:24] for sure
[2:11:25] well i'm a brother son so i'm a brother
[2:11:27] so-and-so yeah
[2:11:28] and i've done over the years i've
[2:11:30] noticed you know i've been fellowship
[2:11:32] with this one fellowship with them
[2:11:33] fellowship with you
[2:11:34] oh lord i think they're under this
[2:11:37] brother's teaching
[2:11:38] none of that brother's teaching oh yeah
[2:11:41] god
[2:11:42] god have mercy on us that we're going to
[2:11:44] be under the holy ghost teaching
[2:11:47] amen brother brown would not want us to
[2:11:50] put him up
[2:11:52] he would not want us to exalt him
[2:11:55] no no he wanted us to exalt christ
[2:11:58] the word
[2:12:01] so who then is paul
[2:12:05] who is apollos but ministers by whom ye
[2:12:08] believed
[2:12:09] even as the lord gave to every man i
[2:12:12] have planted a polish water
[2:12:13] but god gave the increase amen
[2:12:17] that were the result of god
[2:12:21] not of man amen
[2:12:24] by the grace of god to repeat first
[2:12:27] corinthians chapter 10
[2:12:28] and i'll finish with this portion here
[2:12:31] and we have this three others but we'll
[2:12:33] leave that for
[2:12:34] wednesday the lord willing first
[2:12:37] corinthians chapter 10 and verse 1
[2:12:42] moreover brethren i would not that ye
[2:12:45] should be
[2:12:47] now that all our fathers were under the
[2:12:50] cloud
[2:12:51] and all pass through the sea
[2:12:55] and we're all baptized unto moses
[2:12:59] in the cloud and in the sea
[2:13:02] and did all eat the same spiritual
[2:13:06] meat and did all
[2:13:09] drink the same spiritual drink
[2:13:12] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[2:13:14] that followed them
[2:13:16] and that rock was christ
[2:13:19] but with many of them god was not well
[2:13:22] pleased
[2:13:23] god knew their spirit god knew their
[2:13:25] attitude
[2:13:28] amen and for they were
[2:13:34] overthrown in the wilderness
[2:13:37] and there's many believers being
[2:13:39] overthrown
[2:13:41] in the world oh yes today around the
[2:13:43] world are being overthrown
[2:13:47] by false false teachers false prophets
[2:13:51] false ministries or that or the natural
[2:13:53] things of life that are being overthrown
[2:13:56] let god in you control
[2:13:59] your life amen
[2:14:03] now these things were our examples
[2:14:07] to the intent we should not lust after
[2:14:09] evil things
[2:14:10] as they also lusted amen
[2:14:14] and they wanted wanted that which the
[2:14:17] physically
[2:14:17] they they desired to the point there
[2:14:20] they got to says well
[2:14:21] moses why don't you take it back to
[2:14:23] egypt because they felt like their
[2:14:25] egyptian life
[2:14:26] was better than what they have in the
[2:14:27] wilderness
[2:14:29] that's what they thought and brother
[2:14:32] grace unto us
[2:14:33] that will not stay in the message and
[2:14:35] then be entertained by the world
[2:14:39] no we got to walk a complete walk
[2:14:41] separation onto the lord
[2:14:43] amen and just understand all that came
[2:14:47] out
[2:14:47] were all baptized that all eat spiritual
[2:14:50] meat and they all drank the spiritual
[2:14:53] drink and so
[2:14:54] on but with many of them god was not
[2:14:57] well pleased
[2:15:00] many of them around the message did this
[2:15:02] did this did this did that yeah
[2:15:04] but with many of them god's not well
[2:15:06] pleased by their attitude
[2:15:08] their spirit their motives their
[2:15:09] objectives
[2:15:11] how many are truly dead to the world and
[2:15:14] alive to jesus
[2:15:20] amen
[2:15:23] now these things were our examples to
[2:15:24] the intent that we should not lust after
[2:15:26] evil things
[2:15:28] as they also indeed lusted rather
[2:15:32] neither be idolaters as were some of
[2:15:34] them
[2:15:35] as it is written the people sat down to
[2:15:37] eat and drink and rose up to play
[2:15:40] amen
[2:15:43] grace grace grace that we sit down
[2:15:46] during
[2:15:47] eating drink we'll rise up to worship
[2:15:50] amen and give the glory to jesus
[2:15:52] amen so that we become more and more
[2:15:55] spiritual
[2:15:57] and less and less religious by the grace
[2:16:00] of god
[2:16:03] remember
[2:16:06] that by the grace of god the closer that
[2:16:08] we get
[2:16:09] to the resurrection rapture the

[2:22:09] [Music]
[2:22:11] [Applause]
[2:22:13] [Music]
[2:22:18] all right everyone can be seated but
[2:22:19] this will again only take five minutes
[2:22:22] um so at the last business meeting that
[2:22:25] happened about a week ago
[2:22:28] we had a question for one brother that
[2:22:30] we thought was a good one
[2:22:31] it was about what was the proper
[2:22:34] approach
[2:22:34] to voting in terms of prayer
[2:22:37] and seeking the lord's will in terms of
[2:22:39] how you should vote
[2:22:40] this is not um you know our
[2:22:43] annual elections are not political
[2:22:45] elections we don't campaign we don't
[2:22:47] you know get funding we don't have
[2:22:49] campaign managers
[2:22:51] and it's uh you do it in a in a godly
[2:22:54] and sincere way so
[2:22:56] the whole point of today is just to
[2:22:58] bring everyone to the same
[2:23:00] onto the same page because we have a
[2:23:01] younger generation coming up we also
[2:23:03] have new people in the church
[2:23:05] from last year and it's also good to
[2:23:07] kind of reinforce
[2:23:08] why we do what we do otherwise they
[2:23:10] become traditions
[2:23:11] and we don't want traditions because
[2:23:13] traditions is we do this and we have no
[2:23:15] idea why
[2:23:16] so we want to eliminate that entirely
[2:23:18] it's the same reason why
[2:23:20] uh say with the kids like we've gone
[2:23:21] through tithing we've gone through
[2:23:22] communion foot washing all these things
[2:23:24] is because they may be ordinances but
[2:23:27] they're
[2:23:28] from the bible and there's a specific
[2:23:30] reason for them
[2:23:31] and typically it's for our protection
[2:23:32] for our good and it's good for us to
[2:23:34] kind of refresh ourselves
[2:23:36] in this area so this is going to be
[2:23:39] essentially
[2:23:40] that we're just going to go through why
[2:23:42] we do the annual election who's
[2:23:44] on the ballot we're not going to go
[2:23:46] obviously through specific people but
[2:23:47] the roles
[2:23:48] who isn't on the ballot and then what
[2:23:49] their proper approach is
[2:23:51] towards praying how you should feel led
[2:23:53] to vote and whatever so let's turn to
[2:23:55] acts six
[2:24:00] and verse one
[2:24:14] verse one and in those days when in
[2:24:15] those days when the number of disciples
[2:24:17] was multiplied there arose a murmuring
[2:24:19] of the grecians against the hebrews
[2:24:20] because their widows were neglected in a
[2:24:22] daily administration
[2:24:24] then the 12 called the multitude of the
[2:24:25] disciples unto them and said it is not
[2:24:27] reason that we should leave the word of
[2:24:28] god and serve tables
[2:24:30] wherefore brethren look ye out among you
[2:24:31] seven men of honest report full of the
[2:24:33] holy ghost and wisdom whom you whom
[2:24:35] we may appoint over this business okay
[2:24:38] so
[2:24:39] within the church we have deacons
[2:24:40] trustees sunday school superintendent
[2:24:43] treasurer pastor and then there's
[2:24:45] various positions underneath all those
[2:24:47] such as
[2:24:48] song leader you know musicians we also
[2:24:50] have sunday school teachers
[2:24:51] but there's also multiple
[2:24:53] administrations helps people who are
[2:24:55] just
[2:24:56] you know we talk about the sisters
[2:24:57] cleaning the church this is just as
[2:24:58] important as any other position
[2:25:00] so in god's view you know deacons
[2:25:02] trustees these are not gifts and
[2:25:03] callings these are simply
[2:25:05] a appointments which you know we're not
[2:25:08] predestinated for before the foundation
[2:25:10] of the world to be a deacon
[2:25:12] but there is uh character that god
[2:25:15] brings
[2:25:15] to certain people to become those
[2:25:17] positions so
[2:25:19] it's important for us to realize that in
[2:25:21] god's eyes
[2:25:22] just because you have a position doesn't
[2:25:24] mean we have an elevated uh
[2:25:26] position over a regular church member in
[2:25:29] god's eyes we're all equal we're all
[2:25:30] sons and daughters of god
[2:25:32] and if anyone has an attitude that
[2:25:33] they're better than someone because of
[2:25:35] their position
[2:25:36] they shouldn't be in that position so uh
[2:25:39] so in essence the annual election for us
[2:25:42] is is an
[2:25:42] important uh means of keeping everyone
[2:25:45] accountable
[2:25:46] it's a means for the holy ghost to keep
[2:25:49] things in their proper order
[2:25:51] and it's a means for everyone to kind of
[2:25:53] realize that
[2:25:55] i need to be a servant to the people not
[2:25:57] a tyrant
[2:25:58] and it's to ensure that each and every
[2:26:00] person who's in their position will be
[2:26:02] mindful of who they're serving and how
[2:26:05] they should serve
[2:26:06] and you know you know whatever it may be
[2:26:10] so anything we do we should realize how
[2:26:12] important it is with the annual vote
[2:26:14] every year it's realizing that the holy
[2:26:16] ghost to the people
[2:26:17] is setting the church in order okay so
[2:26:19] in terms of
[2:26:21] who we vote on every year we vote on the
[2:26:24] deacons
[2:26:24] so the deacons will take care of people
[2:26:27] the trustees take care of things so the
[2:26:30] trustee takes care of the financial
[2:26:33] burden of the church they you know they
[2:26:35] balance the books
[2:26:36] they take care of the needs in terms of
[2:26:38] doing ebooks do we need
[2:26:40] you know equipment or whatever they they
[2:26:42] take care of the vision of the church
[2:26:44] from a natural point of view taking care
[2:26:45] of the lot taking care of the gardens
[2:26:47] all that stuff that is the duty of the
[2:26:49] trustee so the pastor doesn't have to
[2:26:51] worry about it
[2:26:52] okay this is all in order to lessen the
[2:26:54] burden on the pastor
[2:26:56] in terms of the deacons the deacons is
[2:26:57] there to to maintain order in the church
[2:27:00] they're there to take care of the needs
[2:27:01] of the people like we just read there
[2:27:04] and
[2:27:04] acts their job is to serve tables take
[2:27:07] care of the widows take care of the
[2:27:08] needy
[2:27:09] and you'll be there to help whenever it
[2:27:11] needs to happen
[2:27:13] so there is a great quote that actually
[2:27:15] brother john sent me
[2:27:17] about this in 1962 the key to the door
[2:27:19] the church is sovereign what the church
[2:27:21] says that's what the trustees is just a
[2:27:23] vote
[2:27:24] the pastor is just one vote it's a
[2:27:25] democracy of the church
[2:27:27] the sovereignty of the church the church
[2:27:29] in whole speaks that's all
[2:27:31] and we like that because we have no
[2:27:32] bishops or hierarchies or overseers or
[2:27:34] so
[2:27:34] forced to tell us this that or the other
[2:27:37] it's the holy spirit in the church that
[2:27:38] does the speaking
[2:27:40] i like that rule and it's very fine so
[2:27:43] if a major prophet can say that so
[2:27:46] should we
[2:27:47] so when it comes to the administration
[2:27:50] of the church
[2:27:51] the holy ghost will bring things into
[2:27:53] order and to it
[2:27:55] we want to ensure that the voice of the
[2:27:57] people is heard
[2:27:59] especially in these uh types of things
[2:28:03] so uh this year uh in terms of who's
[2:28:06] eligible for vote for
[2:28:07] uh voting the deacons so the three
[2:28:10] deacons uh myself joe
[2:28:12] and uh brother matt will be uh
[2:28:15] on the voting docket as for the trustees
[2:28:17] it will be brother chad
[2:28:19] from eric and brother bob um
[2:28:22] as we know every year we don't put
[2:28:24] brother gerald on there because
[2:28:26] when we began doing annual elections we
[2:28:28] decided we're not going to have brother
[2:28:29] journal on there
[2:28:30] after 40 years of service he has our
[2:28:33] confidence
[2:28:34] and you know i think he's past that so
[2:28:38] um so the treasure also is on the docket
[2:28:42] which is
[2:28:42] brother mark and the sunny school
[2:28:45] superintendent which is also
[2:28:46] brother mark um brother mark has a lot
[2:28:49] of hats
[2:28:50] so in terms of who we don't vote for we
[2:28:51] don't vote for the songwriter because
[2:28:53] that is on the jurisdiction
[2:28:54] of the pastor the pastor oversees the
[2:28:55] music which goes through the song leader
[2:28:58] and the songwriter matches you know the
[2:29:00] musician's musical superintendent
[2:29:02] which is a relief to sister kimberly so
[2:29:04] we won't be
[2:29:05] she never did like it so uh we won't
[2:29:08] have the sunday school teachers on it
[2:29:09] because the sunny school superintendent
[2:29:11] appoints the teachers
[2:29:13] it does it doesn't it won't come to the
[2:29:15] church for a vote if
[2:29:16] dad decides to go with say brother joe
[2:29:18] for a teacher it's
[2:29:20] it's up to the superintendent for that
[2:29:23] so the most important function is
[2:29:25] obviously how do we approach the vote
[2:29:27] in terms of the actual day so that will
[2:29:29] be next week next sunday we'll be having
[2:29:32] the annual vote so when we go to prayer
[2:29:36] about voting
[2:29:37] it's we again is not political okay
[2:29:40] church and politics should not be
[2:29:42] together we don't look at personalities
[2:29:44] we don't look at friendships
[2:29:46] we don't look at family ties especially
[2:29:48] in the church
[2:29:50] um but it's good because you know more
[2:29:53] often not we can kind of get into
[2:29:56] a routine and we can you know they're i
[2:29:59] guess they're there we guess we should
[2:30:00] just vote for them
[2:30:01] no the whole point is that each
[2:30:04] and every year we take this sincerely
[2:30:08] we take it seriously and we pray about
[2:30:10] it
[2:30:11] and the most important thing is that you
[2:30:12] get neutral because
[2:30:14] you know god forbids one of us has to be
[2:30:17] voted out
[2:30:18] that's going to be a hard thing but the
[2:30:20] thing is is that we got to follow the
[2:30:21] leadership of the holy spirit
[2:30:22] because we have to be obedient to his
[2:30:26] following to his leading
[2:30:27] and it's not up because for me it i
[2:30:30] because the way i
[2:30:31] approach it is that i can't think
[2:30:33] someone's not doing a good job of
[2:30:34] something
[2:30:35] which i don't think that but if i think
[2:30:37] that someone's doing a bad job
[2:30:39] i gotta trust that god has them there
[2:30:42] for a reason and that
[2:30:43] his motive and his objective is pure so
[2:30:46] that's why when we come to the annual
[2:30:49] election every year
[2:30:50] we got to take it prayerfully we got to
[2:30:52] pray through and we have to be neutral
[2:30:54] being neutral is really critical here
[2:30:56] because we got to realize
[2:30:58] that god wants to point each person in
[2:31:01] their position
[2:31:02] for the need at that time and each year
[2:31:05] that could change
[2:31:06] and it's not a bad thing so you know it
[2:31:09] we just have to approach her prayerfully
[2:31:11] sincerely and we just got to do the best
[2:31:14] that we can
[2:31:14] so it's not looking at the outward it's
[2:31:17] trying to find the heart of god for the
[2:31:19] matter at the time
[2:31:21] okay so in terms of you know when you're
[2:31:23] praying is that the most question
[2:31:24] most important questions are how does
[2:31:26] the holy spirit want to lead you in your
[2:31:28] vote
[2:31:29] it's really not your decision we're
[2:31:31] empty vessels
[2:31:33] and we need to allow the holy spirit to
[2:31:34] move through you to make the right vote
[2:31:37] are the people in question doing the job
[2:31:40] that they're required to do in this
[2:31:41] assembly
[2:31:42] okay and that speaks for itself look at
[2:31:44] the last
[2:31:45] year and ask do i like where the church
[2:31:47] has gone
[2:31:48] again are the trustees doing a good job
[2:31:52] managing the assets and the finances of
[2:31:53] the church
[2:31:54] are you being informed and updated what
[2:31:56] about what is happening in the church or
[2:31:59] you know is it this big mystery and
[2:32:01] there's no transparency and there's big
[2:32:03] conspiracy no no we don't want that are
[2:32:06] the
[2:32:06] children learning what they should learn
[2:32:07] in sunny school do you have faith in the
[2:32:09] direction the superintendent is taking
[2:32:10] things
[2:32:11] so these are just some some small
[2:32:13] questions just to keep
[2:32:14] in mind you know there could be a
[2:32:17] thousand more
[2:32:18] but it just the whole point is just to
[2:32:20] stop
[2:32:22] and pause and consider rather than just
[2:32:24] going through the motions that's what we
[2:32:25] want to avoid here uh if you agree with
[2:32:29] what they have done then you vote to
[2:32:30] continue to do
[2:32:31] the same thing in the coming year if you
[2:32:33] vote for each of these men
[2:32:35] that is you saying i will give you my
[2:32:36] support in the coming year
[2:32:38] and the other thing too is that once the
[2:32:40] the church body
[2:32:41] has spoken the renovation he didn't
[2:32:44] think they should do it
[2:32:45] they voted yes and he said okay let's
[2:32:47] move and that shows humility
[2:32:49] from brother brown in order to go in
[2:32:51] that direction rather than saying no no
[2:32:52] no i don't want it because i'm profit he
[2:32:54] didn't do that
[2:32:55] so we should follow his example then
[2:32:57] once the church is voted then
[2:32:58] it it is it is for each one of us now to
[2:33:01] support
[2:33:02] those voted in these offices this is you
[2:33:04] committing to say i will support these
[2:33:05] men
[2:33:06] as long as they stay with the word in
[2:33:07] the coming year it's not just a simple
[2:33:09] vote
[2:33:10] we are saying this is the direction we
[2:33:12] want the church to go in and these are
[2:33:13] the people we want us to take in that
[2:33:15] direction this year
[2:33:17] so the church has the authority but
[2:33:19] we're taking the this authority and
[2:33:21] divesting the control of finances over
[2:33:23] to the trustees and also the maintenance
[2:33:25] of the building
[2:33:25] and all the different assets that we
[2:33:27] have and it's also divesting control of
[2:33:29] what happens inside the church building
[2:33:31] to the deacons
[2:33:32] and also in terms of their different
[2:33:34] functions
[2:33:35] you're taking your authority and handing
[2:33:37] it over to them and and you're saying
[2:33:38] by the leadership of the holy ghost i'm
[2:33:40] interested and spiritually follow the
[2:33:42] leading of the holy ghost
[2:33:44] prayerfully consider where you want this
[2:33:45] church to go then make your vote
[2:33:48] so this is not meant to scare you but
[2:33:50] it's just to kind of refresh your minds
[2:33:52] and to realize that with each year the
[2:33:56] holy ghost wants to speak through us
[2:33:58] and it's god's way of keeping every all
[2:34:00] the checks and balances in place
[2:34:02] because that's the difference between us
[2:34:04] and other churches
[2:34:05] it's it's the the the the leadership
[2:34:09] conquering the lady and we don't want
[2:34:10] that here what we want is to follow the
[2:34:13] apostolic
[2:34:14] first church order that was put in place
[2:34:17] where
[2:34:17] the body is managing the body there's no
[2:34:21] big eyes there's no big
[2:34:22] you know leaders or whatever it's the
[2:34:25] holy spirit in the people keeping
[2:34:26] everything in simplicity
[2:34:28] and in his proper balance and order so
[2:34:31] when you approach the vote next sunday
[2:34:34] just try to keep these in mind
[2:34:35] pray about it and just follow the
[2:34:37] leadership of the lord of
[2:34:39] how you should feel you should vote and
[2:34:41] wherever you decide then we go from
[2:34:42] there
[2:34:43] so that's about it for the bobby if you
[2:34:44] want to come come up
[2:34:47] i am done
[2:34:58] it wasn't five minutes
