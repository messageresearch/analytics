[33:18] the grace and the strength to just keep
[33:22] pressing
[33:24] on.

[45:22] Sweet
[45:25] land.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord Jesus.
[45:31] Lord, surely if there's one thing that's
[45:33] becoming more clear every day, it's that
[45:35] this is not our home. Lord, as a song
[45:37] says, we're just a passing through.
[45:39] We're pilgrims and strangers. Lord, we
[45:42] don't fit in.
[45:44] Lord, we're looking for a city whose
[45:46] builder and maker is God.
[45:48] And Lord, we're coming in tonight, Lord,
[45:51] just to draw us one step higher, one
[45:53] step closer to that day, Lord, when
[45:55] these bodies will be changed, Lord. When
[45:57] our spirit will be fully united with
[45:59] you, Lord, to go to a city, Lord, to go
[46:02] to a place, Lord, a marriage supper of
[46:04] the lamb, Lord, and dwell with you,
[46:07] Lord, in peace and rest. And you'll wipe
[46:08] away every tear,
[46:10] Lord. You'll take away every hurt and
[46:12] pain that we've gone through here, Lord.
[46:14] It'll be worth it all then. But Lord,
[46:16] we've got to separate ourselves here
[46:18] tonight today. Lord, we've got to set
[46:20] our eyes a little higher. Lord, lift up
[46:23] our eyes, Lord, for our redemption is
[46:24] drawing nigh. So Lord, we pray you help
[46:27] us to get our eyes centered on you once
[46:29] again tonight. Lord, may we just feast
[46:31] on your word, Lord. May it place us in
[46:33] our proper position. Lord, may it build
[46:36] us up. May it strengthen us, encourage
[46:38] us, Lord. Correct us where we have need
[46:39] of it tonight, Lord. Pray that we'd be
[46:41] able to see ourselves through your eyes,
[46:43] through your word, Lord, in what's
[46:45] coming tonight. We pray. Lord, bless
[46:47] your people now. We ask in Jesus
[46:49] Christ's name we pray it. Amen. Amen.
[46:53] God bless you. Turn if you would to
[46:54] Psalms the 132nd chapter, Psalms 132.
[46:58] And it's what a switch we have here
[47:00] tonight. We had so many people missing
[47:02] and the right side was the strong side
[47:04] and we only had five on the left side
[47:06] and then today we've got almost all the
[47:08] pews full on the left side and the right
[47:09] side is failing us again. So, but amen.
[47:12] We're glad to see each one that's here.
[47:14] Good to have brother Matt, sister Amber
[47:16] and the family back looking refreshed
[47:18] and happy and satisfied. Amen. Good to
[47:21] have them back. And then we've got
[47:23] Brother Jim Douly and the whole family
[47:25] there. Amen. Good to see each one of you
[47:27] there. Sister Florence, that was very
[47:29] Your special was special. Now I can show
[47:31] you written hard printed on my notes
[47:34] from yesterday the song I'm going to
[47:36] make it in the key of F number 1263.
[47:41] Now I'll tell you this.
[47:43] God does all things for purpose.
[47:46] Children of God, sons of God are led by
[47:48] the spirit of God. You know, I was just
[47:49] reading in I can read it for you here
[47:52] this right now. I was reading in 1
[47:54] Chronicles and it's talking about the
[47:57] priests and it says now in 2 or 1
[48:02] Chronicles 25 it says moreover David and
[48:04] the captains of the host separated to
[48:05] the service of the sons of Asaf and
[48:07] He-Man and Jedithan who should prophesy
[48:10] with harps and sultteries and symbols.
[48:14] In other words, there were there were
[48:15] people set aside to prophesy through
[48:18] music.
[48:21] You that sing, you that play, you are
[48:23] not just musicians.
[48:25] You're a part of the ministry.
[48:28] Not women preachers. I never said that.
[48:31] But you are a part of the ministry that
[48:33] God has placed to edify the people.
[48:37] Amen. So, God bless you, Sister
[48:38] Florence, Sister Patricia for doing that
[48:40] tonight. There are no things done just
[48:43] by happen stance or I like this song or
[48:45] maybe the people will like it. It's the
[48:47] spirit of God that's leading us to do
[48:48] it. And I had never heard those verses
[48:50] before. It was just beautiful. Amen. So,
[48:52] I wanted to say how much I appreciate
[48:54] that. God bless you. And it just fit
[48:55] right into the scriptures I've been
[48:57] reading even this very morning and the
[48:58] the one of the songs I plan to sing at
[49:00] the end of service. So, very thankful
[49:03] for that. Amen. God bless you each one.
[49:04] Good to see you with us. Good to see
[49:06] brother Kingsley back with us as well.
[49:08] Amen. Wanted to mention that of course
[49:10] as you all know our camp meeting our our
[49:13] our family camp has been cancelled
[49:14] because the camp has uh firefighters
[49:17] staying there and I guess they've
[49:18] decided that preserving all of our homes
[49:20] is more important than us getting
[49:22] spiritual food in due season. So we're
[49:24] going to transition to having just
[49:26] regular uh special meetings this next
[49:28] weekend. So we'll have no service next
[49:30] Wednesday, but we'll have services
[49:32] Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday
[49:34] morning. We'll definitely have the
[49:36] fellowship on Sunday afternoon. And I
[49:37] think we may have the brunch on Saturday
[49:39] morning as well. Brother Aaron Oglesby
[49:41] will be here of course to preach for us.
[49:43] So just remember those in prayer. We
[49:45] will still have some visitors coming
[49:47] from New Brunswick and PEI in these
[49:49] different places. Um so let's just come
[49:51] prepared. Amen. For fellowship to hear
[49:53] the preaching of the word to see the
[49:55] spirit of God move in our midst. Amen.
[49:58] Amen. God bless you. Psalms 132 and
[50:01] verse 13 says this. For the Lord had
[50:04] chosen Zion. He had desired it for his
[50:07] habitation. This is my rest forever.
[50:10] Here will I dwell for I have desired it.
[50:14] Amen. God bless you. You can have your
[50:16] seats. And we're in the closing
[50:18] stretches of our series. We've been
[50:19] preaching this series on the Holy Ghost,
[50:21] the token life. And I want to start what
[50:23] I think is going to be the last stretch
[50:25] or the last thought of this series. And
[50:27] it's I want to take a title this evening
[50:29] of the mystery finished. Amen. and we're
[50:32] starting to develop uh the the final
[50:34] thoughts on what the the the Holy Ghost
[50:37] life is, what the purpose of the Holy
[50:38] Spirit is in our life. And I want to
[50:40] start at the very beginning of the
[50:42] scriptures to develop this thought this
[50:44] evening. We'll build it up today as a a
[50:46] foundation, and we'll flesh it out
[50:48] through the coming weeks, the Lord
[50:49] willing, as we close out this series.
[50:51] And I hope it's been a blessing to you.
[50:52] We've been 76 uh services on this. Amen.
[50:56] Trusting we've learned something. We've
[50:57] grown. We've seen God do more things in
[50:59] our life than we've seen before. Amen.
[51:02] But I want to take us back to the
[51:03] beginning. Remember, Genesis is the seed
[51:05] chapter and then Revelation is the
[51:07] harvest chapter. So, we're going to see
[51:08] it in Genesis. So, we can see it in
[51:10] Revelation. We won't get to Revelation
[51:12] tonight. It'll take us a few services to
[51:14] get there, but I want us to see what
[51:16] we're preaching about here on this
[51:18] finished mystery. The mystery finished
[51:20] from the book of Genesis. And it says,
[51:21] "And the Lord God caused to sleep a deep
[51:24] sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept.
[51:27] And he took one of his ribs and closed
[51:29] up the flesh instead thereof. And the
[51:32] rib which the Lord God had taken from
[51:34] man, made he a woman, and brought her
[51:37] unto the man. And Adam said, "This is
[51:40] now bone of my bones and flesh of my
[51:43] flesh. She shall be called woman because
[51:46] she was taken out of man." He says,
[51:49] "Therefore shall a man leave his mother,
[51:52] his father, and his mother, and shall
[51:54] cleave unto his wife, and they shall be
[51:57] one flesh." So, the reason I'm reading
[51:59] this this evening is to set the
[52:00] principle, and that's that the woman
[52:02] comes from the man. Amen. She is not a
[52:05] separate creature. She's not a separate
[52:07] species, but she was a part of him. She
[52:09] was taken from him. She was built from
[52:12] the same things he's made of. She's got
[52:14] the same building blocks that he has.
[52:16] Yes, she looks different. She's got a
[52:19] different body. Her manifestation is
[52:21] different than his. Okay, let's put our
[52:24] spiritual thinking caps on this evening.
[52:26] Let's wake up. She looks different than
[52:28] he is, but yet she's made of the exact
[52:30] same things that he's made of. Her body
[52:32] looks different. Her voice is different.
[52:35] There are things and ways that she does
[52:37] that maybe don't match up to the way the
[52:39] man does, but yet she is still him.
[52:41] Amen. She's still a part of him. She's
[52:44] an expression of him in the original
[52:46] creation that was perfect. Amen. You see
[52:50] where we're going tonight? Now, catch
[52:51] this, church. She was always there.
[52:55] She was always in him. She was always a
[52:57] part of him. But she didn't always know
[52:59] it. She had no awareness. She had no
[53:02] idea. Amen. She was not aware of the the
[53:06] fact that she was a part of him, the
[53:07] elements of him because she did not have
[53:10] a body or the breath of life to give her
[53:12] that awareness. Amen. She didn't have a
[53:15] body with that mind. Amen. But she was
[53:17] always a part of him, but she was not
[53:19] manifested in a way that gave her that
[53:22] consciousness. She was built into him to
[53:24] start and then she was taken out of him
[53:27] as a secondary expression of that man.
[53:30] And Adam says she will be called woman.
[53:33] She doesn't get a name of her own. Amen.
[53:35] She doesn't get a de an identity of her
[53:38] own. She gets a definition.
[53:41] She gets a definition. Her very identity
[53:44] is tied to her origin. Her very defining
[53:48] attributes are tied to who she came
[53:50] from. She has no identity except through
[53:54] the person she came out of. Amen. He was
[53:57] Adam. She was Mrs. Adam. She was not
[54:02] Eve. church. Now, you'll see the prophet
[54:04] time to he'll call him Adam and Eve
[54:06] because afterwards she got a name. After
[54:08] the fall, she got a name of her own, but
[54:11] under her original condition, under
[54:13] perfect creation, she had no identity
[54:17] except for his name. Amen. Can you catch
[54:20] that this evening? His name was her
[54:22] name. And that's the principle that's
[54:24] been set forth now in Genesis. And it's
[54:26] a perfect type of Christ and the bride.
[54:28] Adam was made in the image of God. So
[54:31] what God did with Adam, what God took
[54:33] out of Adam is the same as what God did
[54:35] with and through Christ. And God said it
[54:38] was not good for Adam to dwell alone.
[54:41] And that was a reflection of God's own
[54:44] desire. See, what wasn't good for Adam
[54:46] wasn't good for God. And therefore, what
[54:49] was good for Adam was good for God
[54:51] because Adam is in the image of God.
[54:53] He's the son of God. Amen. And so God
[54:56] says, Adam needs somebody. Why? Adam
[54:59] needs fellowship. Adam needs
[55:00] companionship. Adam needs family. Why?
[55:02] Because that's what God wanted. It's the
[55:05] reflection of God inside of Adam. Amen.
[55:07] We know that because that's what God
[55:09] produced. God produced his own desire
[55:11] through Adam. That was the expression.
[55:14] Amen. Brother Bram says this. He says,
[55:15] "God wanted fellowship." Now, when God
[55:18] made man in the beginning to fellowship
[55:20] with him, then this man was in perfect
[55:22] fellowship in the Garden of Eden. He was
[55:24] in perfect fellowship with God. And how
[55:26] it must have been on that day when God
[55:28] would come down in the cool of the
[55:30] evening and call Adam and he and Eve
[55:32] would come up. They would worship God.
[55:34] They would fellowship and commune one
[55:36] with the other. He says that's the very
[55:39] thing that calls us together like this
[55:41] sitting together in heavenly places in
[55:43] Christ Jesus fellowshipping in the Holy
[55:46] Spirit. He says there's no difference in
[55:48] us.
[55:49] You're drawing nigh to the one that is
[55:51] just like you. There's no big eyes and
[55:54] little 's. There's no ministry in
[55:56] everyone else. We're all one. Amen.
[55:58] We're all built from the same DNA. We've
[56:00] got the same building blocks. We've got
[56:02] the same origin. He says there's no
[56:04] difference in us. We are all one in
[56:06] Christ Jesus in that perfect harmony of
[56:08] fellowship. He says, "There's nothing
[56:10] like it I've ever found on earth is to
[56:13] come together in heavenly places and
[56:15] have communion, fellowship with God and
[56:17] with each other." He says, "Now, that's
[56:19] what God intended in the Garden of
[56:22] Eden." Isn't that the most wonderful
[56:24] thing? When you get real fellowship with
[56:26] brothers and sisters of Christ, that's
[56:27] the most wonderful thing. Under the
[56:29] preaching of the word, when you have
[56:30] special meetings, when everybody's
[56:32] sitting together and eating food
[56:33] afterwards, there's no other people I'd
[56:35] rather be than the people of God. I
[56:37] mean, that's the greatest time that you
[56:38] can have. Why? Because we're cut from
[56:40] the same cloth. We identify with each
[56:43] other. We might have different shapes
[56:44] and voices and these different things,
[56:46] but we recognize in each other. We come
[56:48] from the same place. That's our unifying
[56:50] factor. I don't like brother Jim because
[56:53] he's a good guy. I like brother Jim
[56:55] because he's a son of God.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. He happens to be a good guy and
[56:58] I'm glad for that. But our identity, our
[57:01] unity with each other is because we come
[57:03] from the same source.
[57:05] And that means when things get tough,
[57:06] that's the things that keep us together
[57:08] anyways. Is we recognize that's a child
[57:10] of God that's walking this road beside
[57:12] us. Amen. But we see this mystery that's
[57:15] been shown there in Eden, but it didn't
[57:17] really get to a place where it could
[57:18] show the full breadth of God's master
[57:21] plan and intention because sin came down
[57:23] and it separated mankind from God and it
[57:26] cut the whole thing short. If mankind
[57:28] hadn't sinned there, it would have just
[57:30] moved on and on and it would have
[57:32] produced children of God, one big family
[57:34] of God, united under the word of God,
[57:36] and we would have had the perfect time.
[57:38] It would have been the perfection that
[57:40] we're going to see at the end of all
[57:41] this. Amen. That was the ultimate goal
[57:43] of God was a family like that that was
[57:46] just like him. But when sin broke that,
[57:49] then things went downhill in a hurry.
[57:51] Amen. And we saw that the the the the
[57:53] sons of God looked on the daughters of
[57:55] men and saw how good-looking they were
[57:57] and they married into them and it
[57:58] created a completely messed up race. And
[58:00] that's where we are today. Amen. We
[58:02] might think we come from great families
[58:04] or great homes or great Christian
[58:06] heritage, but there's nothing special in
[58:08] this flesh church. in the in in the in
[58:11] the flesh. We're all serpent seed. We
[58:13] all come from a mixed race. Amen. But
[58:16] we're all exactly the same. We're
[58:17] broken, fallen creatures of time. That's
[58:21] what this flesh is here. Amen. And
[58:23] that's just a reflection of 6,000 years
[58:25] of this world of sin. What we see here
[58:28] tonight, the good, the bad, and the
[58:30] ugly, that's just a reflection of sin.
[58:32] This is Satan's design that we're seeing
[58:34] here now today. That's what we see is
[58:37] the brokenness of what Satan did when he
[58:39] mixed in that with what God had
[58:41] intended. But church, it hasn't stopped
[58:43] God. It hasn't stopped God. Amen.
[58:45] Because his word is still working to
[58:47] produce exactly what he intended, what
[58:49] he thought, what he declared before time
[58:51] began. Now, we spoke last service about
[58:54] this great mystery revealing. And that's
[58:56] really what we're going to focus on for
[58:57] these next few services. And when we
[59:00] roll through 4,000 years of from Eden to
[59:03] Christ, we see people that were called
[59:04] by God. We see people that were used by
[59:06] God, protected by God, given great
[59:08] ministries and signs and wonders. But
[59:11] then we come to the word made flesh in
[59:13] Christ Jesus. And he would say these
[59:15] beautiful words that we read last
[59:16] service. He says, "If you abide in me
[59:20] and my words abide in you," that's a
[59:23] condition. If and then he says, "Then
[59:27] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[59:30] be done unto you." Church, I don't know
[59:31] if there's a more beautiful promise to
[59:33] the human race than this, that if you
[59:36] abide in me and my words abide in you,
[59:38] you can ask anything you want and you'll
[59:40] get it. But you have to understand what
[59:42] all of this means together. Amen.
[59:45] Because we read in Genesis 2 that a man
[59:47] was supposed to leave what he had and
[59:50] cleave unto his wife. And in doing so,
[59:52] they would become one flesh. And that
[59:54] phrase one flesh means one body. They
[59:57] would become one body. Together they
[1:00:00] would reveal the name, the attributes,
[1:00:02] the preferences, the nature, the
[1:00:04] character of the man. That's under the
[1:00:06] perfect union. Amen. The woman gave a
[1:00:09] further revelation of who Adam was.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Absolutely she did. She was a further
[1:00:15] revelation of Adam. See, Adam can't have
[1:00:17] a a female voice and a male voice
[1:00:19] simultaneously. And today, if a man has
[1:00:22] a female voice in a male body, what do
[1:00:23] we say? He's light in his loafers.
[1:00:25] Something's wrong there. He's not meant
[1:00:27] to be that. But she could be feminine
[1:00:29] and soft and swoopy and beautiful and
[1:00:32] all these different things that he
[1:00:34] couldn't express simultaneously.
[1:00:37] So, she was a greater she was a she was
[1:00:39] an extended revelation of that man.
[1:00:42] Amen. And so, when that woman was
[1:00:45] produced, then she was showing something
[1:00:47] that couldn't be seen before.
[1:00:50] It was something that couldn't be
[1:00:51] revealed before. Now she was with him in
[1:00:53] spirit. Remember what the scripture
[1:00:55] says. It says in the image of God
[1:00:57] created he him.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So she was with him in spirit. There she
[1:01:02] was in him in his original body. Amen.
[1:01:05] And then she was made flesh. She was
[1:01:07] expressed in a body of her own. The
[1:01:09] scripture says in the image of God
[1:01:11] create he him. Male and female created
[1:01:14] he them. She was an outside expression
[1:01:16] of what was inside of him. Now brothers,
[1:01:19] whether we like it or not, today our
[1:01:21] wives are an expression of ourselves.
[1:01:24] Amen. My wife and I are Mr. and Mrs.
[1:01:27] Jonathan Kurlet. That's the identity
[1:01:30] that we have. She was born with another
[1:01:33] name. Amen. She was born seemingly in a
[1:01:38] different heritage. But when she married
[1:01:40] me, she realized who she really was.
[1:01:45] She thought she was a navis.
[1:01:47] She thought she had Mexican heritage.
[1:01:49] She thought she was an American. All
[1:01:52] come to realize she was a white German
[1:01:55] Canadian.
[1:01:57] That was her origin.
[1:01:59] Now, we're speaking in type because the
[1:02:02] thing is this flesh is all messed up.
[1:02:04] But spiritually, that's what she is. She
[1:02:06] is a part of me. And she didn't know it.
[1:02:09] And I didn't know it. Amen. Now, notice
[1:02:12] this. She's not all of me, but
[1:02:15] everything she is is me. Let me say that
[1:02:19] again. She's not all of me, but
[1:02:21] everything that she is is me. Why?
[1:02:24] Because she came out of me. She's not
[1:02:26] everything I am, but everything she is
[1:02:28] came from me. Therefore, everything she
[1:02:30] is is me. Amen. That's the spiritual
[1:02:33] view of our marriage. That's what God
[1:02:34] thinks of our marriage. Remember what
[1:02:36] Jesus said, what God had joined, let no
[1:02:38] man put us under. Why? Because it's a
[1:02:41] it's a it's a spiritual union. It's not
[1:02:43] just flesh. It's something that God has
[1:02:46] ordained for each of us. Amen. This
[1:02:48] flesh part is all messed up. Hers and
[1:02:50] mine both. That's why she could be
[1:02:53] Mexican and I can be German and we can
[1:02:55] still be in union. That part's all
[1:02:56] messed up. That's why we need a new body
[1:02:59] is cuz that's messed up. But
[1:03:00] spiritually, in a soul realm, in a
[1:03:02] spiritual realm, we are compatible. We
[1:03:04] come from the same source. She is me and
[1:03:07] I am her in those sense. Amen. But what
[1:03:09] is it in this life? It takes a bit of
[1:03:11] time for us to realize who we belong to,
[1:03:13] who we're a part of in this life. That's
[1:03:15] why Paul said we have to love our wives
[1:03:17] as our own bodies. He said, "He who
[1:03:19] loves his wife loves
[1:03:22] himself."
[1:03:24] Amen. That's about as clear as you can
[1:03:26] make it, church brothers. If we're
[1:03:27] unhappy with our wives, it's because we
[1:03:30] aren't loving them as much as we love
[1:03:31] ourselves.
[1:03:33] We're not giving them the same time, the
[1:03:35] same attention maybe that we allow for
[1:03:37] ourselves. We'll do so much to make
[1:03:39] ourselves feel good and be good and have
[1:03:41] success and accomplish things, but what
[1:03:43] about our wives?
[1:03:45] If she doesn't do it, we're
[1:03:46] disappointed.
[1:03:47] But are we giving her all the time and
[1:03:49] attention and money and focus that we
[1:03:51] give ourselves to be successful?
[1:03:54] Remember, if we're unhappy with her,
[1:03:55] it's a reflection of our failure because
[1:03:58] we lead, we help, we we we drive these
[1:04:02] things in our lives. Amen. We're
[1:04:04] supposed to see their success as our
[1:04:05] own. That means we're also supposed to
[1:04:07] see their failure as our own. Are we
[1:04:11] willing to do that as husbands tonight?
[1:04:13] To say when she fails, I failed
[1:04:16] because I'm here to make sure she
[1:04:18] doesn't. It means I failed someplace.
[1:04:20] Amen. That's a that's a a perspective
[1:04:22] that will shift our response. Shift our
[1:04:25] response when things don't quite go the
[1:04:26] way we think, won't it? Is that when she
[1:04:29] fails, I failed because she's under my
[1:04:32] headship. She's under my direction.
[1:04:36] But now Jesus Christ comes along, the
[1:04:37] second Adam, the image of God, the
[1:04:39] fullness of God. Everything of God is in
[1:04:42] him. And he's God revealed in flesh. And
[1:04:43] he says these words. He says, "If you
[1:04:45] abide in me,"
[1:04:47] he says, "And my words abide in you. You
[1:04:50] shall ask what you will and it'll be
[1:04:52] done unto you." That word abide there
[1:04:54] means if you continue, if you dwell, if
[1:04:57] you endure, if you remain, if you stay,
[1:05:01] if you tarry, I want us to see something
[1:05:03] here. He says we've got to stay with
[1:05:05] him. We've got to abide with him. We've
[1:05:08] got to be where he is. That means we
[1:05:10] don't go in and come out and go in and
[1:05:12] come out. It means we go in and we stay
[1:05:14] in. He's a tiepost to us. Where he is,
[1:05:18] we are. Amen. That's what abiding is.
[1:05:21] That's that's what the new birth is,
[1:05:23] church, is abiding with Christ. 1
[1:05:25] Corinthians 12, by one spirit we're
[1:05:27] baptized into the body. That means once
[1:05:29] we're in, we don't come out.
[1:05:32] Church, baptism doesn't allow us to go
[1:05:34] back to the old life. The real baptism
[1:05:37] doesn't allow us to do it. That one's
[1:05:38] dead. You can't go back to that which is
[1:05:40] dead. So, when you're baptized into the
[1:05:42] body, you can't go back to the old life.
[1:05:44] It's dead. You're into a new body.
[1:05:46] You're in it, and you can't go out of
[1:05:47] it. Amen. We're there forever. But he
[1:05:50] says, "You got to abide in me." But then
[1:05:52] he says, not only that, but my words
[1:05:54] have to abide in you. The word has to be
[1:05:56] in residence in our life. Amen. This
[1:05:59] isn't just something where we would
[1:06:00] reference it from time to time. Do you
[1:06:02] catch what I'm saying?
[1:06:04] This is not just a a little thing we
[1:06:06] look up now and again when we can't
[1:06:08] resolve something. This is supposed to
[1:06:10] be in resonance in our mind, not
[1:06:12] something that's flitting through our
[1:06:13] mind occasionally.
[1:06:15] The word is called the bread of life for
[1:06:18] a reason. You're supposed to eat it and
[1:06:22] eat it and eat it and eat it. And the
[1:06:25] goal is to get you so full of the word
[1:06:27] that when something else comes your way,
[1:06:29] you say, "I can't eat that. I'm full."
[1:06:31] Not only that, but I've got a taste.
[1:06:33] I've got a holy man's taste now. And
[1:06:35] that doesn't attract me. I'm full, but
[1:06:37] I've got a different taste that's been
[1:06:38] developed based on the food than I've
[1:06:40] been eating. Amen.
[1:06:43] We have to abide in Christ, but the word
[1:06:45] has to abide in us as well. Remember
[1:06:47] what Jesus said, John 14. He says, "Yet
[1:06:50] a little while, and the world seeth me
[1:06:52] no more, but you see me. And because I
[1:06:54] live, you shall live also. And at that
[1:06:57] day you shall know that I am in my
[1:06:59] father and you are in me and I in you.
[1:07:02] Church, here's the revelation here. The
[1:07:04] word was with God. Amen. It was in God's
[1:07:07] mind. The word was God. The God stepped
[1:07:10] into his word being revealed as Jesus
[1:07:12] Christ. And now he shows us that we were
[1:07:14] in Christ as well. I'm in him. He's in
[1:07:18] me. And you're in me as well. There's
[1:07:21] all of us in there. Amen. What reveals
[1:07:23] this mystery? What's going to show them
[1:07:26] what that looks like? He says, "At that
[1:07:29] day, you shall know what that's when
[1:07:32] they'd realize he'd come back to them."
[1:07:34] He's pointing ahead to the day of
[1:07:35] Pentecost when the spirit of God would
[1:07:37] be poured out and they'd recognize it's
[1:07:39] Jesus Christ come down again. Why?
[1:07:41] Because he would reveal himself the same
[1:07:43] way he did when he was with them. Amen.
[1:07:46] That's the confirmation that he was
[1:07:48] coming back. But what's the reality of
[1:07:51] that event? What does that look like
[1:07:53] daytoday? Verse 21 says, "He that hath
[1:07:56] my commandments,
[1:07:58] those that have his word, those that
[1:08:00] have his will." He says, "It's he that
[1:08:03] hath my commandments and keepeth them."
[1:08:05] Amen. We're not just hearers only, but
[1:08:07] we're doers of the word. He says, "He it
[1:08:10] is that loveth me, and he that loveth me
[1:08:12] shall be loved of my father, and I will
[1:08:15] love him, and will manifest myself to
[1:08:17] him." The reality of Christ is the
[1:08:19] baptism of the Holy Spirit in his
[1:08:22] people. And in doing so, they will have
[1:08:25] his commandments. They'll have his word.
[1:08:27] And the spirit of God in them will help
[1:08:28] them to keep his word. That's the only
[1:08:31] way you can do it is by the spirit of
[1:08:33] God living inside of you. Amen. That's
[1:08:35] the proof of their love for him is that
[1:08:37] they receive his word and they keep his
[1:08:40] word. And then what happens after that?
[1:08:43] He says, "If you do that, I will love
[1:08:45] you and I will manifest myself to you."
[1:08:49] Now, that's a pretty big thought for us
[1:08:50] to grasp on a Wednesday evening when
[1:08:52] we've worked and we've drove and we've
[1:08:54] had fires all around us and all these
[1:08:55] things going on for us to sit here and
[1:08:57] grasp that Christ is going to manifest
[1:08:59] himself to us.
[1:09:02] But that's what we're preaching. That's
[1:09:04] what the Holy Ghost is, is the
[1:09:05] manifestation of Christ in you. Amen.
[1:09:08] But we consider this whole picture. We
[1:09:10] must abide in him. We've got to live
[1:09:13] with him. We've got to be with him. We
[1:09:15] must be where he is. We must be united
[1:09:17] with him. And his word must abide in us.
[1:09:20] It has to, church. These are not
[1:09:22] negotiable.
[1:09:23] You can't have one and not the other.
[1:09:26] They both have to be together. It's
[1:09:28] spirit and truth. That's the only way it
[1:09:30] works is spirit and truth together. Now,
[1:09:33] the first part, if I was to say this,
[1:09:35] the first part, we must abide in him.
[1:09:37] That's the kicker.
[1:09:39] Because sometimes we feel like we come
[1:09:41] and go. I do. I don't know. I don't
[1:09:45] always feel like the great overcomer, do
[1:09:47] I? I don't think you do either. There's
[1:09:49] days where you feel less like a
[1:09:51] Christian, and there's days where you
[1:09:52] feel more like a Christian. And you say,
[1:09:54] "Well, was I abiding in Christ more
[1:09:56] today when I was feeling great about it
[1:09:58] than yesterday when I wasn't? Am I
[1:10:01] closer? Am I farther? Am I in? Am I
[1:10:03] out?"
[1:10:04] That's the kicker for the believers to
[1:10:06] recognize when you're in Christ, it has
[1:10:08] nothing to do with how you're feeling
[1:10:09] that day. But I want us to step back.
[1:10:12] Amen. Because to abide with Christ, to
[1:10:14] be in the same residence, to be in unity
[1:10:16] according to the scriptural principles
[1:10:19] requires that we're in a marriage.
[1:10:22] You can't stay in a house with another
[1:10:24] man unless you've got a marriage
[1:10:25] certificate.
[1:10:27] That's what the holy union is. That's
[1:10:29] the only way biblically that you can do
[1:10:31] that. Biblical unity is only through
[1:10:33] marriage. The two have to become one.
[1:10:36] And that's under the sanctity of the
[1:10:37] marriage covenant that was given us in
[1:10:39] Genesis 2. That's the original type that
[1:10:41] we read about. But let's look at this
[1:10:43] from the eternal perspective tonight
[1:10:45] because that's what'll settle our
[1:10:47] hearts. If we can see it from the
[1:10:48] eternal, then time doesn't matter. If
[1:10:50] it's settled in eternity, then what
[1:10:52] happens today and tomorrow doesn't
[1:10:54] really c it really doesn't come into the
[1:10:56] equation because the eternal is what
[1:10:58] really matters. Church, remember, when a
[1:11:00] young woman gets married, she realizes
[1:11:03] how special she is. And I'm trying to
[1:11:05] get you to see tonight how special you
[1:11:06] all are. Listen,
[1:11:10] if Sister Justine
[1:11:12] were to get married in the next year and
[1:11:15] she has a young man and he is handsome,
[1:11:19] he's tall. He's fit. He's got a house.
[1:11:24] He's got a car for her and a car for
[1:11:26] him. He's got a good job. He's got a
[1:11:29] good church. He's got a good reputation.
[1:11:32] He's spiritual. He's got the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:35] How would she be feeling about herself?
[1:11:39] Would she be over in a chair? I want you
[1:11:42] to I want you to picture that young man.
[1:11:45] She's doing it right now. I can see the
[1:11:46] smile on her face. You get a man like
[1:11:48] that, would she be over in the corner
[1:11:50] saying, "Oh my goodness,
[1:11:53] I am such a loser."
[1:11:59] What do you think?
[1:12:02] What would you think of that, Sister
[1:12:04] Becky? What would you think if you had a
[1:12:05] man like that come your way?
[1:12:08] You know what you'd think?
[1:12:10] You'd think you were the greatest ever.
[1:12:12] Cuz you're looking at who picked you and
[1:12:16] you say, "Great men don't pick bad
[1:12:17] women."
[1:12:19] Great men pick great women
[1:12:23] cuz they can. Cuz they won't settle for
[1:12:26] less. Amen. When a great man says, "Will
[1:12:30] you marry me?" You're a reflection of
[1:12:33] the greatness he sees in himself.
[1:12:37] Great men only marry great women. Great
[1:12:40] men don't marry bad women, church.
[1:12:43] Otherwise, they're not great men. So,
[1:12:45] when a woman is asked to be married by a
[1:12:48] man that has everything that she could
[1:12:50] ever imagine, that ought to tell her how
[1:12:52] special she is.
[1:12:55] that to tell her how much he thinks of
[1:12:57] her, how much he regards her. How great
[1:12:59] are the attributes that she has
[1:13:01] regardless of what she thinks of
[1:13:02] herself. She might think she's got a big
[1:13:04] nose or fat ankles or thin hair,
[1:13:08] whatever it might be. But to her, to
[1:13:10] him, he says, "She is the only one that
[1:13:12] I can see that I want." Amen.
[1:13:17] Listen to this. This is our opening
[1:13:18] scripture. For the Lord hath chosen
[1:13:22] Zion. He had desired it for his
[1:13:25] habitation. This is my rest forever.
[1:13:29] Here will I dwell. He says, for I have
[1:13:32] desired it. Now remember in the
[1:13:34] scripture, Zion always represents who?
[1:13:37] The bride. It's always the bride. But I
[1:13:40] want you to take a look at how Zion
[1:13:43] started out. Do you remember what Zion
[1:13:46] was before it was Zion?
[1:13:48] Zion was Jibus.
[1:13:52] Jibus was a city on a hill, a fortress
[1:13:55] on a hill filled with Jebusites. It was
[1:13:59] never conquered in the days of Joshua.
[1:14:01] Joshua left it for the people of that
[1:14:03] area to conquer and they never conquered
[1:14:06] it. So, it's filled with Canaanites.
[1:14:09] It's filled with the world. It's filled
[1:14:12] with idolatry. It's filled with all
[1:14:14] sorts of filth. But then what happens is
[1:14:17] King David comes along
[1:14:19] and there's this fortress in there that
[1:14:21] nobody can take. And they say, "Listen,
[1:14:23] we could put the the people in the
[1:14:25] wheelchairs and the people on crutches
[1:14:26] on our on our on our city uh walls and
[1:14:30] you still couldn't take it." And David
[1:14:32] said, "Watch me." He says, "Whoever can
[1:14:34] open this place up for me," he says,
[1:14:36] "you'll command my armies." And what
[1:14:37] happened is Joab went in and he climbed
[1:14:39] up the water shaft and he went in, he
[1:14:42] opened the gates and they went in, they
[1:14:43] conquered it. That's how they got in
[1:14:45] there. Amen. David built outward from
[1:14:48] that city, from Zion. And today, that
[1:14:52] city is Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem
[1:14:55] started out as Jibus, which became the
[1:14:57] city of David, which is Zion. It was a
[1:14:59] fortress on a hill. But then they built
[1:15:01] outwards and outwards from that and
[1:15:03] eventually built an outer wall from it.
[1:15:05] Amen. They become one today. Zion and
[1:15:07] Jerusalem are the same thing today. But
[1:15:09] in God's eyes, they are different. Zion
[1:15:11] is the bride and Jerusalem is the Jewish
[1:15:13] remnant. Okay? So, there's a distinction
[1:15:16] in God's eyes. God didn't say Jerusalem.
[1:15:19] He says Zion. Now, we're going to see
[1:15:21] new Jerusalem, which is what? The
[1:15:23] original Zion. That's what comes back a
[1:15:25] little bit later. But, amen. The
[1:15:27] scripture says God has chosen Zion.
[1:15:30] Let's put it in. The Lord had chosen his
[1:15:33] bride. He had desired it for his
[1:15:36] habitation. He wants to live with her.
[1:15:38] He wants to rest with her forever. He
[1:15:42] says, "And here I'm going to dwell."
[1:15:43] Why? Because I have desired it. But
[1:15:47] church, you've got to realize the woman
[1:15:49] that he desires, when we look at her
[1:15:51] today, we might say she's full of
[1:15:53] idolatry. She's full of worldliness.
[1:15:56] She's filthy. She's dirty. She's messing
[1:15:58] around in this. She's messing around
[1:16:00] with that. That does not matter. Why?
[1:16:02] Because I have chosen Zion.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You got to see a church
[1:16:07] through his eyes. Not through your eyes.
[1:16:10] Through eternity. Before you did right,
[1:16:13] before you did wrong, before you looked
[1:16:15] to him, before you rejected him, before
[1:16:17] you did anything, I have chosen Zion.
[1:16:22] That's what we're preaching tonight. He
[1:16:25] chose us. Amen. In other words, church,
[1:16:30] God's going to get what he wants.
[1:16:33] Hallelujah. when you're what he wants.
[1:16:35] That's the most wonderful scripture you
[1:16:37] can read. He had desired me. Guess
[1:16:39] what's he going to get me? He's going to
[1:16:41] get me. Come hell or high water. He's
[1:16:43] going to get me and he's going to live
[1:16:45] with me and he's going to dwell with me
[1:16:46] and he's going to rest with me forever.
[1:16:49] Amen. So, we look here and we see that
[1:16:51] the bride is a reflection of one thing
[1:16:53] and one thing alone. He chose her. He
[1:16:58] chose her. Amen. The only way we get to
[1:17:00] abide with him is because he chooses us
[1:17:03] first. The only way we can dwell with
[1:17:05] him is that he decides that he wants us
[1:17:07] to be his dwelling place. We don't
[1:17:09] choose him. He chooses us. Just a few
[1:17:12] verses later in John 15 where we already
[1:17:14] read, he says, "You have not chosen me,
[1:17:17] but I have chosen you." Now, here's the
[1:17:20] problem. They thought he chose him then.
[1:17:24] He chose them way before then.
[1:17:27] And we'll see the proof of it later. He
[1:17:29] says, "And I've ordained you that you
[1:17:31] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[1:17:33] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[1:17:36] you shall ask of the father in my name,
[1:17:39] he may give it to you, church." In other
[1:17:41] words, our choice has already been made.
[1:17:43] We are the only people in the world that
[1:17:45] don't get to make a choice. He already
[1:17:48] made the choice for us. And he's for us,
[1:17:51] not against us. Amen. We've already been
[1:17:53] established in our position. were
[1:17:55] ordained to our position way before we
[1:17:57] didn't way before we knew it. Consider
[1:18:00] this. Eve came into consciousness having
[1:18:02] no idea who she was.
[1:18:05] One minute she wasn't the minute she was
[1:18:08] there. Now, she did not wake up next to
[1:18:11] Adam. The scriptur is very clear. God
[1:18:13] brought her to Adam. So, there was a
[1:18:15] period of time where Eve did not know
[1:18:18] who she was.
[1:18:20] She was in form. She was in body. She
[1:18:23] was in shape. She had a voice. She had a
[1:18:25] mind. She had awareness. But she did not
[1:18:27] know who she was. But when God brought
[1:18:30] her to Adam, when she was brought to her
[1:18:33] husband, that's when she realized who
[1:18:35] she was. Why? Cuz he told her, "You came
[1:18:38] out of me. You belong to me. You and I
[1:18:41] were one. We're the same thing just
[1:18:43] expressed differently." And all of a
[1:18:45] sudden, she had this warm, restful
[1:18:47] feeling because all of a sudden, she
[1:18:48] understood where she fit into things.
[1:18:51] That may have been a few seconds. It may
[1:18:52] have been a few minutes. It may have
[1:18:53] been a half hour, may have been a couple
[1:18:55] hours. We don't know how long it took
[1:18:56] between her creation and her
[1:18:58] introduction to her husband. But in
[1:19:00] those times, church, she had no
[1:19:01] identity. She didn't know who she was.
[1:19:03] But when she came into his presence and
[1:19:05] he spoke to her, all of a sudden, she
[1:19:07] understood who she was. Amen. And what
[1:19:09] did he do, church? He identified her
[1:19:12] with him. She was tied to him. Amen. It
[1:19:15] was a revelation of her origin and it
[1:19:17] introduced her to her proper to her
[1:19:19] original position. Listen to what Paul
[1:19:21] would say. He says, "Blessed be the God
[1:19:23] and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
[1:19:25] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[1:19:28] blessings in heavenly places in Christ,
[1:19:31] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:19:35] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:19:38] we should be holy and without blame
[1:19:41] before him in love." Church, let me
[1:19:44] preach it to you tonight. He didn't say
[1:19:46] we are holy.
[1:19:48] He said we would be holy. He chose that
[1:19:51] we would be holy. We didn't be holy and
[1:19:54] then he chose us. He chose us that we
[1:19:56] should be that we would become holy.
[1:19:59] What that means is your condition
[1:20:01] tonight doesn't matter.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; What your condition yesterday was
[1:20:04] doesn't matter. What your condition
[1:20:06] tomorrow does doesn't matter because by
[1:20:08] his own choosing, his own word, his own
[1:20:11] plan, he has chosen us to be holy and
[1:20:15] without blame before him in love that he
[1:20:18] has for us. That's where we're standing,
[1:20:20] man. How are we going to abide with
[1:20:22] Christ? By his choosing. How are we made
[1:20:25] acceptable to him? By his choosing.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Church, there's a lot of women. Talk to
[1:20:30] me. But there's only one that goes home
[1:20:33] and abides with me, and that's my wife.
[1:20:35] Why? Because I chose her. Cuz I chose
[1:20:38] her. Listen to what Brother Brandon
[1:20:40] would say. He says, "Now Jesus said, and
[1:20:42] we wouldn't argue with him, no man can
[1:20:44] come to me except my father draws him
[1:20:46] first." He says, "Then it was God
[1:20:48] knocking at your heart, not you seeking
[1:20:50] God. It was God seeking you." So you
[1:20:53] see, he says, "The covenant is to you."
[1:20:56] Also, a grace covenant because it's
[1:20:58] God's grace calling you. You never chose
[1:21:01] him. He chose you. You've got a covenant
[1:21:06] sitting there that you didn't even know
[1:21:07] about. You didn't sign it. You didn't
[1:21:09] read it. You didn't agree to the terms
[1:21:10] and conditions. He chose you and you're
[1:21:13] bound to him.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; That's it. He says, "Out of the millions
[1:21:18] in the world today, we spoke teasingly
[1:21:20] of Sister Justine or Sister Becky
[1:21:22] getting married to the man among all
[1:21:24] men,
[1:21:26] one in 8 billion
[1:21:28] that would get the greatest of men as a
[1:21:30] husband. May God grant it, sisters,
[1:21:33] if that's your desire, if that's his
[1:21:34] desire." But he says, "Out of the
[1:21:37] millions in the world today, he reached
[1:21:40] down and chose you because he put your
[1:21:43] name on the lamb's book of life before
[1:21:45] the foundation of the world." He says
[1:21:47] that's what the Bible said before there
[1:21:49] was a world. Jesus was the lamb slain
[1:21:51] from the foundation of the world because
[1:21:54] he says when God speaks anything, it's
[1:21:57] so perfect. It has to take place and
[1:22:00] it's as good as done when God speaks it.
[1:22:05] He chose us to be holy. He did not
[1:22:08] choose us because we were holy. He chose
[1:22:11] us to become holy, to become blameless,
[1:22:14] to become the recipients of his love.
[1:22:16] Amen. We're a part, brother saying here,
[1:22:19] of the perfection of his word. If you're
[1:22:23] a part of it, you're perfect.
[1:22:27] That'll stick in your throat.
[1:22:29] If he spoke of you, you're perfect
[1:22:31] because you're a part of his word. Amen.
[1:22:34] We're a part of the purity, the
[1:22:35] reflection, the holiness of God being
[1:22:38] expressed. Brother Bam says it this way.
[1:22:40] He says, "That's the reason you're
[1:22:41] holy." This afternoon, not because you
[1:22:43] deserve it, but because he chose you to
[1:22:47] be that way. Not because you are that
[1:22:49] way. He didn't choose you because you're
[1:22:51] holy. He chose you to become holy.
[1:22:53] You're only holy because he chose you.
[1:22:56] That's the only ones that can be holy.
[1:22:58] He says, "When before the foundation of
[1:23:00] the world," listen to this. He says,
[1:23:01] "First of all, we know most assuredly
[1:23:03] that the purpose of God stands in
[1:23:05] election. It was purposed in himself. It
[1:23:10] was God's purpose to bring forth a
[1:23:11] people like unto himself that would be a
[1:23:13] word bride. She was chosen before the
[1:23:16] foundation of the world in him. She was
[1:23:19] fornown and beloved before she ever
[1:23:23] brought forth during the ages upon the
[1:23:25] earth. She was redeemed by his blood and
[1:23:29] can never come into condemnation.
[1:23:33] Church, can you accept that tonight?
[1:23:35] Before you did good, before you did
[1:23:37] evil, before you cursed, before you
[1:23:39] looked at things you shouldn't, before
[1:23:40] you messed your life up, you were chosen
[1:23:43] by him, that you were fornown and you
[1:23:46] were beloved before you made a choice.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; That's one in a million. That's one in a
[1:23:52] billion.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about tonight.
[1:23:55] Amen. You were loved before you ever
[1:23:56] came to him, before you surrendered to
[1:23:58] him, before you were baptized in his
[1:23:59] name. Amen. You were accepted and loved
[1:24:02] before you had any attribute worth
[1:24:03] loving.
[1:24:06] He says, "She can never be in the
[1:24:08] judgment because sin cannot be imputed
[1:24:12] unto her." Romans 4:8 says, "Blessed is
[1:24:15] the man to whom the Lord will not impute
[1:24:18] sin." Church, you can't be sin and
[1:24:20] sinless at the same time. You can't be
[1:24:22] hated and loved at the same time. You're
[1:24:25] either one or you're the other. God
[1:24:26] hates sin, but he loves his bride.
[1:24:28] Therefore, you can't have any sin in
[1:24:30] you. He can't impute it to you because
[1:24:33] you're a part of his word. He cannot do
[1:24:35] that. So, he's got to make a way to go
[1:24:37] through that. His love is showing here
[1:24:39] is that he is it is elective. Amen. It's
[1:24:41] not based on our personal works or our
[1:24:44] condition or how we do today or how
[1:24:46] we're going to do tomorrow. It's based
[1:24:48] on the fact that he chose us. He says,
[1:24:50] "But indeed she will be with him in his
[1:24:52] throne of judgment, judging the world
[1:24:54] and even angels. Her name, each of her
[1:24:57] members, was written in a section of the
[1:24:59] Lamb's book of life before the
[1:25:01] foundation of the world." Church, that's
[1:25:03] a mystery I want to explore. That's a
[1:25:06] mystery I'm willing to dig into. Amen.
[1:25:08] that you and I are captured under the
[1:25:10] perfection of God through his spoken
[1:25:13] word, his holiness, his very thoughts
[1:25:16] expressed. Not choosing us by our
[1:25:19] holiness, choosing us to receive his
[1:25:22] holiness. Amen. We're receivers.
[1:25:26] We're receivers of his grace and his
[1:25:28] mercy. Amen. He chose us to go through
[1:25:30] the washing of water by the word. He
[1:25:31] chose to cover us with his blood by
[1:25:33] Jesus Christ. Amen. And that process
[1:25:35] makes us holy and acceptable. Watch this
[1:25:38] now. Watch Isaiah 4. He says, "In that
[1:25:41] day shall the branch of the Lord be
[1:25:44] beautiful and glorious. And the fruit of
[1:25:47] the earth shall be excellent and comely
[1:25:49] for them that are escaped of Israel." He
[1:25:52] says, "And it shall come to pass that he
[1:25:54] that is left in Zion, and he that
[1:25:56] remainth in Jerusalem shall be called
[1:25:58] holy, even everyone that is written
[1:26:01] among the living in Jerusalem." He says,
[1:26:03] "When the Lord shall have washed away
[1:26:06] the
[1:26:07] filth,"
[1:26:09] oh, we identify so easily with that
[1:26:11] sometimes if we're honest, "Shall have
[1:26:14] washed away the filth of the daughters
[1:26:16] of Zion, and shall have purged the blood
[1:26:19] of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by
[1:26:21] the spirit of judgment and by the spirit
[1:26:23] of burning." Church, according to the
[1:26:25] word, we don't come to him clean. We
[1:26:27] come filthy, filthy, filthy. Amen.
[1:26:31] Whether we're raised in a Christian
[1:26:32] home, whether we're raised in a godless
[1:26:34] home, whether we go to church every week
[1:26:36] of our life, whether we're lost in sin
[1:26:38] and alcohol and drugs and traps of the
[1:26:41] devil and messed up relationships and
[1:26:43] all those things, it matters not. Paul
[1:26:45] said, "We've all sinned and come short
[1:26:46] of the glory of God." We're all filthy.
[1:26:49] We all have to go through this process.
[1:26:51] You know, I've noticed one thing in
[1:26:53] Jesus day. You know who turned him down?
[1:26:56] Those that had a big opinion of
[1:26:58] themselves.
[1:27:00] Absolutely. 100%. That's what turned him
[1:27:02] down was those that said, "We are
[1:27:05] Abraham's seed."
[1:27:07] Let me bring it home. We believe the
[1:27:09] message of the hour. Yeah. Have you
[1:27:10] become the message yet? Have you
[1:27:13] received it into your soul rather than
[1:27:14] just your mind? Have you become what you
[1:27:17] believe yet? That's what we're looking
[1:27:19] for in this life. Amen. This this
[1:27:21] inflated opinion of oneself is not
[1:27:23] conducive to eternal life. It's an
[1:27:25] arrogant spirit. It's a religious spirit
[1:27:27] that'll keep you out of the bride every
[1:27:29] single time. But how's he going to clean
[1:27:31] us up? He says, "The Lord will have
[1:27:33] washed away the filth of the daughters
[1:27:35] of Zion." Jesus would say, "Now ye are
[1:27:38] clean through what? The word which I
[1:27:41] have spoken unto you."
[1:27:43] You're clean through the word. What I
[1:27:46] have, you have not chosen me. I have
[1:27:48] chosen you.
[1:27:50] Church, was every one of them clean?
[1:27:55] He just said they're clean.
[1:27:58] You that shook your head, you're you're
[1:28:00] disagreeing with Jesus. He said they're
[1:28:01] clean.
[1:28:04] Were they clean? You go out to John 13,
[1:28:06] he says, "You are clean except one,
[1:28:09] Judas." But Judas by ver by chapter 15,
[1:28:13] he's gone to betray the word. And so
[1:28:15] Jesus looks around the room and he says,
[1:28:16] "You're all clean.
[1:28:21] I want you to see yourself tonight.
[1:28:23] Amen.
[1:28:26] He's saying this to men that would run
[1:28:28] away from him. To men that would deny
[1:28:31] him. To men that would curse. To men
[1:28:33] that would leave him to face judgment
[1:28:35] all on his own. To men that would run
[1:28:38] away and hide him themselves. To men
[1:28:40] that would not believe he was risen from
[1:28:42] the dead. And yet he's saying to them,
[1:28:45] "You are clean through the word which I
[1:28:46] have spoken unto you." What did he say,
[1:28:48] church? You didn't choose me. I chose
[1:28:50] you. That's what's going to clean you
[1:28:52] up. Not what you do, not what you think,
[1:28:55] not the way you act. What's going to
[1:28:57] clean you up is the word that's gone
[1:28:58] forth already that declared you to be
[1:29:01] holy and blameless before me in love.
[1:29:03] That's the only thing that's going to
[1:29:05] work. He says, you're clean through the
[1:29:06] word.
[1:29:09] Why am I saying this? You've got to see
[1:29:11] the cleanliness of your life, not
[1:29:13] through your performance,
[1:29:15] but through his word. through the filter
[1:29:17] of his eyes. Amen. What he says, not
[1:29:20] what we see,
[1:29:23] church. Until the day we get out of
[1:29:24] here, this flesh is still going to be
[1:29:26] sticky.
[1:29:27] It's still going to be fallen. I don't
[1:29:30] care. We're going to be rapture ready.
[1:29:31] This flesh is still going to be sinful.
[1:29:33] It's still going to like what it likes
[1:29:35] and want what it wants.
[1:29:37] So, your cleanliness is never going to
[1:29:39] be as you want it to appear. You're
[1:29:42] still going to have impure thoughts,
[1:29:43] men, sisters. You're going to still be
[1:29:45] catty at times. in your mind, you're
[1:29:48] going to want those this and that and
[1:29:49] the other thing. Lust of the eyes, lust
[1:29:51] of the flesh. We're all going to be
[1:29:52] dealing with it until the day we step
[1:29:54] out of this flesh. So, we can't look at
[1:29:57] what we see. We got to look at what he
[1:29:58] says. That's what matters. Amen. Our
[1:30:02] cleanliness comes by the unchanging word
[1:30:03] of God through the blood of Jesus
[1:30:05] Christ. Amen. They were clean because
[1:30:08] they were in the word that he had
[1:30:09] preached already. It had already been
[1:30:12] said. It had already been spoken,
[1:30:13] church. They didn't understand it all.
[1:30:15] They didn't know it all. They couldn't
[1:30:17] preach it all. They didn't have it all.
[1:30:19] They didn't believe it all.
[1:30:22] But they were still clean by the word.
[1:30:25] Because when the word goes out, remember
[1:30:27] we've talked about it before. It's like
[1:30:28] an Energizer Bunny. It never stops. It
[1:30:31] goes and it goes and it goes until it
[1:30:33] produces what he said. His word can't
[1:30:35] return to him. Boy. And his word said,
[1:30:37] "You're holy and blameless before me in
[1:30:39] love." That's why he could say, "You're
[1:30:40] all clean." Because the word's going to
[1:30:42] do the work and it won't stop until you
[1:30:44] are what it said you are. It will never
[1:30:47] finish until you're finished. Amen.
[1:30:50] Paul would put it this way later in
[1:30:52] Ephesians. He says, "Husbands, love your
[1:30:54] wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:30:56] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:30:58] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:31:01] washing of water by the word. that he
[1:31:05] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:31:07] church, not having spot or wrinkle or
[1:31:10] any such thing, but that it should be
[1:31:12] holy and without blemish. You know, we
[1:31:14] take our garments to a dry cleaners. We
[1:31:16] can't clean it. Who do we take it to?
[1:31:17] The dry cleaners. The specialists,
[1:31:19] right?
[1:31:21] You spill ketchup on that suit. It ain't
[1:31:23] coming out. Who do you take it to? The
[1:31:25] dry cleaners. They'll get it out. What's
[1:31:28] he saying here? What'll get it out,
[1:31:29] church? What'll work? The word. You got
[1:31:32] a problem? Go to the word. You're
[1:31:35] feeling filthy, go to the word. You
[1:31:38] can't resolve it, go to the word. You
[1:31:40] can't see it, go to the word. You don't
[1:31:43] feel it, go to the word. The word will
[1:31:45] do the work. It'll bring you out to what
[1:31:48] he told you you are. It'll bring you out
[1:31:50] to what he promised. He says, "Be
[1:31:52] therefore perfect even as your heavenly
[1:31:55] father is perfect." He says, "How can
[1:31:58] you be?" When he says, "It's not my
[1:32:00] perfection. It's not your perfection."
[1:32:02] He says it's his perfection of his word.
[1:32:08] What does that mean, brother John? That
[1:32:10] he chose you and you never chose him and
[1:32:13] he brought you into Christ. He says
[1:32:16] you're secured with Christ and just as
[1:32:17] perfect as Christ was before God. He
[1:32:20] says, "For you're not standing with your
[1:32:21] own. You're standing in him with one
[1:32:23] thing. I believe God." He says, "Amen.
[1:32:26] Oh, how I love him on the other side of
[1:32:28] Eden. What a wonderful time it'll be
[1:32:30] someday when you look back down and say,
[1:32:31] "Why did I fear? Look at the joy I
[1:32:34] missed." Church, when I read that, it
[1:32:37] makes me want to run around the church
[1:32:38] that he chose me by the perfection of
[1:32:42] his word.
[1:32:44] He's not looking at me. He's looking at
[1:32:47] his word. And he's just asking me to do
[1:32:50] the same thing. Look at my word. Trust
[1:32:53] in my word. Feed on my word. Believe on
[1:32:55] my word. and it'll do the work it's
[1:32:57] trying to do.
[1:32:59] We're going to read a quote later. I
[1:33:00] don't know if it's in my notes here or
[1:33:01] not. It'll be maybe in the next service
[1:33:03] where he says that that spirit of God is
[1:33:05] brooding over his unchanging word
[1:33:10] trying to do something for you.
[1:33:14] What? Get you to believe that it's for
[1:33:17] you. It's about you. It's to you. And
[1:33:21] it'll work for you. What he's done for
[1:33:24] others, he'll do for you. That's what
[1:33:26] he's trying to get us to believe. What
[1:33:28] does this mean? It means we are in his
[1:33:29] thoughts. It means we are in his mind.
[1:33:31] And we came from his thoughts and his
[1:33:33] mind to his mouth. And he spoke it. And
[1:33:35] because he's God, because he's holy,
[1:33:37] everything that comes out of his mouth
[1:33:39] is perfect. It's holy. It's acceptable.
[1:33:43] It's beloved.
[1:33:45] Why? Because it's a part of him.
[1:33:48] Nobody hates themselves.
[1:33:51] Nobody hates themselves.
[1:33:54] We might dislike elements of ourselves,
[1:33:56] but we don't treat ourselves like we
[1:33:58] hate ourselves. We might wish we could
[1:34:00] change some things, but we love
[1:34:01] ourselves. When God speaks out of his
[1:34:04] perfection, what comes out can only be
[1:34:05] his own perfection. That's the only
[1:34:07] thing that comes out of him. Amen. And
[1:34:09] it showed the choosing of God that you
[1:34:12] could be perfect today. Amen. The
[1:34:15] choosing of God is what makes you
[1:34:16] perfect. Church, that means you're not
[1:34:18] going to start perfect.
[1:34:20] Can I get an amen? We don't start
[1:34:22] perfect, but we're going to end perfect.
[1:34:24] You don't start holy, you're going to
[1:34:26] end holy. You might not feel like a
[1:34:28] child of God, but you're going to be a
[1:34:30] child of God. Why? By his the perfection
[1:34:33] of his choosing by his word. Amen. He's
[1:34:35] going to end up. You're going to end up
[1:34:37] the way you are. Not the way you feel,
[1:34:40] not the way you think, not the way you
[1:34:42] see. Why? Because what you are is what
[1:34:44] he said way before you ever came into
[1:34:46] this little mess. That's what he's
[1:34:48] turning us into. Is what we already are.
[1:34:51] Don't look at your condition today,
[1:34:53] church. Don't look at your condition.
[1:34:55] Say, "Am I in his word?" Because if I'm
[1:34:58] in his word, that's going to make the
[1:34:59] difference. It's the only thing that
[1:35:00] makes the difference in our lives.
[1:35:02] Brother puts it this way. He says, "Can
[1:35:04] you see it? Healing is yours. Salvation
[1:35:07] is yours. It's a free gift of God that
[1:35:10] God gave you and called you and chose
[1:35:12] you before the foundation of the world."
[1:35:14] He says, "You're his air." Why? He says,
[1:35:16] this is the quote I was talking about.
[1:35:18] He watches over you day and night trying
[1:35:21] to get to you to do something for you.
[1:35:25] Why? Because his word can't return to
[1:35:26] him void. He says, "You say, "But I made
[1:35:28] a mistake last week or last month."
[1:35:30] Church, I wish I could say I made a m
[1:35:32] one mistake last week or last month.
[1:35:37] I would be so happy if I could say I
[1:35:39] only made one mistake last week or last
[1:35:41] month. What about you, Brother Jim? I
[1:35:43] would take that one mistake a week. I
[1:35:46] would say I'm rapture bound.
[1:35:49] But what he's saying is it doesn't
[1:35:50] matter. The mistake whether it's one or
[1:35:54] whether it's a million doesn't matter.
[1:35:58] He says I don't care how many mistakes
[1:36:02] you make. Hallelujah. I don't care how
[1:36:05] many mistakes you make. You know who
[1:36:07] cares? You do.
[1:36:10] God doesn't. can't see him under the
[1:36:13] blood, cleansed by the word.
[1:36:17] He says, "We've all sinned and come
[1:36:19] short of the glory." He says, "If you're
[1:36:21] a child of Abraham, you're ready to
[1:36:23] recognize that as sin and come back to
[1:36:25] God again, and God's mercy still hangs
[1:36:27] to you." He says, "Look at Abraham,
[1:36:30] church." I'm reminded of the woman at
[1:36:31] the well. She had five husbands, married
[1:36:34] and divorced.
[1:36:36] She's living with a six-man, common law,
[1:36:39] not even her husband. church. She was
[1:36:40] searching for a husband. She was
[1:36:43] searching for something that would
[1:36:44] stick. She was looking for something
[1:36:45] that would hold. She was looking for
[1:36:47] something that would fulfill. And even
[1:36:49] in her sixth relationship, she still
[1:36:51] wasn't satisfied.
[1:36:54] In all her searching, all of her
[1:36:55] attempts, in all of her relationships,
[1:36:57] she never found what she was looking
[1:36:59] for. Why? She hadn't met the man.
[1:37:03] Sisters, isn't that what you're looking
[1:37:04] for? Not a man, the man. If you're going
[1:37:09] to be married, you only need one. But
[1:37:10] he's got to be the right one. He's got
[1:37:12] to be the right one. Amen. She's looking
[1:37:15] for the man. She met a lot of men.
[1:37:18] Had a lot of experiences,
[1:37:21] a lot of feelings, a lot of emotions, a
[1:37:22] lot of visions, a lot of dreams of what
[1:37:24] was going to be. And in the end of it
[1:37:27] all, church, what did she have?
[1:37:29] Brokenness,
[1:37:30] failure.
[1:37:33] Listen, we can go to every camp. We can
[1:37:36] sit under every ministry. We can feel
[1:37:38] every move of the spirit of God, but
[1:37:41] until he comes in, church, we're never
[1:37:43] going to be satisfied.
[1:37:45] We're going to keep looking. We're going
[1:37:46] to be like that woman at the well. But
[1:37:49] one day, she met a man that touched
[1:37:52] something that had never been touched
[1:37:53] before. He touched her soul. Why,
[1:37:56] church? Cuz he spoke from eternity.
[1:38:00] He spoke from eternity. He said, "I must
[1:38:02] needs go by Samaria."
[1:38:05] Why? Cuz she chose him. She didn't even
[1:38:08] know him, church. She didn't even know
[1:38:10] him. But he says, "I've got to go by
[1:38:11] Samaria." And he starts talking to this
[1:38:13] woman, and what's he showing her? Hey, I
[1:38:16] know you. You don't know me, but I know
[1:38:18] you. You know why I know you? You came
[1:38:21] from me. And you've been looking for me
[1:38:23] all along, and I came from eternity to
[1:38:26] this moment to let you know you belong
[1:38:29] to me. You belong to me. He says, "I'm
[1:38:33] going to show you where you're from, and
[1:38:35] I'm going to show you where you're
[1:38:36] going, and you'll never be the same
[1:38:38] again." And when he was done, what did
[1:38:40] she do? She threw away her reproach. She
[1:38:43] threw away her water pots in the middle
[1:38:44] of the day, and she ran in, and she
[1:38:46] says, "Is this not the very Messiah?"
[1:38:49] Why? She finally met the man. Amen.
[1:38:56] What was it that made her respond?
[1:38:58] church, broken, hurt, wrecked life and
[1:39:02] embarrassment,
[1:39:03] a woman of poor and bad reputation.
[1:39:07] And yet the Messiah comes and she can
[1:39:09] respond that way. Why? She was a chosen
[1:39:12] bride. It's the only reason. She was
[1:39:15] chosen. She was not holy.
[1:39:19] She was not blameless.
[1:39:22] She was filthy.
[1:39:24] rejected a man, a mess.
[1:39:29] But what responded, church? The choosing
[1:39:32] of God before the foundation of the
[1:39:34] world put something in her soul that
[1:39:37] would recognize Christ when he came,
[1:39:40] that would recognize her bridegroom.
[1:39:41] Amen. And what did it do? It set her on
[1:39:43] a path to the Holy Spirit. And Philip
[1:39:46] would go down. He preached to Samaria.
[1:39:48] And then Peter and John would go down.
[1:39:49] They'd lay hands on them. They'd all
[1:39:50] receive the Holy Ghost. She was one of
[1:39:53] them.
[1:39:55] Not deserving,
[1:39:57] chosen.
[1:39:59] Chosen. That's what makes the
[1:40:01] difference.
[1:40:04] Paul continues. He says, "Having
[1:40:06] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:40:08] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:40:10] according to the good pleasure of what
[1:40:12] we want."
[1:40:14] No.
[1:40:17] Doesn't matter what we think. The good
[1:40:19] pleasure of his will. And church. God
[1:40:22] gets his will. God gets his way. Abraham
[1:40:25] says, "Predestinated." There's the
[1:40:27] mystery. He before Christ or anything
[1:40:29] else was ever on earth, you see his
[1:40:32] great mystery that he chose the bride
[1:40:36] knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving
[1:40:37] the word, knowing she would fall. He
[1:40:39] says, "But he chose a bride that would
[1:40:42] not fall, that would hold to the word
[1:40:45] regardless of what all the rest of the
[1:40:47] world had to say about it." Church, I
[1:40:50] don't want you to read it the way most
[1:40:52] people do. He did not choose her because
[1:40:54] she would hold.
[1:40:57] She would hold because he chose her.
[1:41:01] Come on now.
[1:41:04] She would hold because he chose her. The
[1:41:07] thing that holds us is not us. It's him.
[1:41:10] It's his choosing. It's his
[1:41:12] predestination. It's his ordaining that
[1:41:14] holds us, not ourselves. Amen. I hope
[1:41:17] you catch that tonight. We stand because
[1:41:19] he chose that we would not fall. He says
[1:41:23] they would hold to that word and he
[1:41:25] confirms it. They are predestinated to
[1:41:27] stand there. Predestinated to stand. In
[1:41:32] other words, destined by God to stand.
[1:41:36] Not chosen by God because they will
[1:41:38] stand, but destined by God to stand. He
[1:41:42] says, "The adoption of children by Jesus
[1:41:44] Christ predestinated the church to that
[1:41:47] great glorious stand." He says, "I can
[1:41:51] see eternity break, come down into time
[1:41:54] since Eden, and when it did, there come
[1:41:55] a line of blood." We're preaching on the
[1:41:57] token life all the way up under Calvary,
[1:41:59] and from Calvary tied with this line and
[1:42:02] goes on to the tide post Jesus. He says,
[1:42:04] "And someday when he comes to claim his
[1:42:06] own, everyone that's tied to that
[1:42:09] ultimate will be raised up into
[1:42:10] eternity." He says why? They have been
[1:42:13] in eternity all the time. They were
[1:42:17] predestinated in eternity. They are part
[1:42:20] of God. They were in his thinking at the
[1:42:25] beginning.
[1:42:27] Doesn't that just take the the pressure
[1:42:29] off?
[1:42:31] I'm going to make it.
[1:42:33] I'm going to make it. Why? Because he
[1:42:36] said I'm going to make it. Not cuz I've
[1:42:38] got strength. Not because I've got
[1:42:40] power, not because I've got authority,
[1:42:42] not because I'm any great thing, because
[1:42:44] he chose me. I was a part of him.
[1:42:52] He says, "And when that big rope is
[1:42:53] pulled of the line of the blood, that
[1:42:56] token I was speaking of, what is it?
[1:42:59] Those that are truly born again, not
[1:43:02] hearers only, but doers also." He says
[1:43:05] when it comes up from the earth,
[1:43:06] everyone that was included in that blood
[1:43:08] will be dropped right up into eternity
[1:43:10] again. But the only way it'll be will be
[1:43:12] tied to that absolute Jesus Christ. It's
[1:43:15] absolute, not an achievement of man, but
[1:43:17] God raised him up from the dead and he
[1:43:19] is an absolute. He says we know he's
[1:43:21] alive because he's here with us in the
[1:43:23] power of his resurrection doing the same
[1:43:25] thing he did when he was on here here on
[1:43:28] earth. That woman in the well, what was
[1:43:30] she?
[1:43:32] See, if we look at the outer church,
[1:43:34] we're never going to see what we are.
[1:43:37] If she looked at herself, she would say
[1:43:38] broken, messed up, a failure, polluted,
[1:43:42] filthy,
[1:43:44] rejected.
[1:43:46] But what was she?
[1:43:49] She was a predestinated seed of God.
[1:43:52] Couldn't see it. Church, remember, Jesus
[1:43:55] didn't look like Zion, but it was still
[1:43:58] Zion in God's eyes. And God had a way of
[1:44:01] getting to turn Jibus into Zion. And
[1:44:04] he's got a way of turning a prostitute
[1:44:06] woman into a bride of Christ. It's not
[1:44:10] based on our conditions. It's based on
[1:44:12] the word that he's already given. She
[1:44:14] was ordained to see it. Filthy,
[1:44:17] rejected, messed up, and yet ordained to
[1:44:19] see it. Church, don't ever look down
[1:44:21] your nose at somebody that's not where
[1:44:22] you are tonight. It's by his grace we
[1:44:25] are as far as we are. And it's his grace
[1:44:27] that's going to keep us going. We don't
[1:44:29] know who's in. We don't know who's out.
[1:44:32] We treat them all as if they're going
[1:44:33] in. Amen.
[1:44:36] What drove that woman to be able to see
[1:44:39] Christ?
[1:44:41] The pleasure of his goodwill,
[1:44:45] church, you I don't know if we realize
[1:44:47] how blessed we are tonight. To see it is
[1:44:50] the pleasure of his the good pleasure of
[1:44:54] his will. That's the only reason we can
[1:44:56] say I see it tonight is because of his
[1:44:59] will. The fact that in her condition she
[1:45:02] saw it, she recognized it, she believed
[1:45:06] it, she accepted it, and she acted on it
[1:45:09] only pointed to one thing. There was
[1:45:12] something about her that had nothing to
[1:45:13] do with her. And it was the good
[1:45:15] pleasure of his will. Amen. It had
[1:45:18] nothing to do with her present life, her
[1:45:19] present condition or present issues or
[1:45:21] present situation, faults, failures or
[1:45:24] message. She was a seed waiting for the
[1:45:26] light to strike. That's all she was. And
[1:45:29] until the light strikes, until the
[1:45:31] warmth of the spirit comes, the seed can
[1:45:34] never come to life. But when it comes to
[1:45:35] life, what does it cause? Everything to
[1:45:37] do rot away that the real life can come
[1:45:39] out. And we start to see what is inside
[1:45:41] that. Remember when I preached on the
[1:45:42] nature of a seed and I showed all those
[1:45:44] seeds up there and some of them are
[1:45:45] spiky,
[1:45:47] some of them are beautiful, some of them
[1:45:50] are very plain.
[1:45:52] But guess guess what, church? I don't
[1:45:53] care what kind of seed you are, you
[1:45:55] still got to rot. They've all got a rot
[1:45:57] that the life that's inside him can come
[1:45:59] forth. All her life was leading her to
[1:46:02] that one moment.
[1:46:05] One moment where the word would come her
[1:46:07] way and she'd see it and recognize it
[1:46:08] and she'd never be the same again.
[1:46:12] She was never the same. Brother Ram
[1:46:14] says, "You get into Christ. If you're in
[1:46:16] Christ, there's not a word written in
[1:46:17] here but what you believe it." He says,
[1:46:19] "I don't care what anybody else said."
[1:46:21] And then God makes that thing manifested
[1:46:25] cuz you when he pours the spirit upon
[1:46:27] the word, what happens? He says it's
[1:46:29] just like putting water on any other
[1:46:31] seed, it'll live and it'll bring forth
[1:46:34] of its kind. That's what sets us aside
[1:46:37] from every other person in this world is
[1:46:39] when the word comes our way, it has an
[1:46:41] effect.
[1:46:43] Lots of people can be moved by the
[1:46:45] spirit. Lots of people can enjoy the
[1:46:47] presence of the Lord. Lots of people can
[1:46:49] enjoy the intellectual stimulation of
[1:46:51] the word, but there's only one seed
[1:46:54] that'll produce it, and that's the
[1:46:55] eternal seed of God inside of you.
[1:46:57] That's the only thing that'll ever do
[1:46:58] it.
[1:47:02] Church, can I say it this way? If you
[1:47:05] feel like you're up and down,
[1:47:07] if you feel like you're in and out, I've
[1:47:08] only got one solution for you. Get in
[1:47:11] Christ. That's the only thing I've got.
[1:47:14] I was counseling a man there not well
[1:47:17] last year sometime. And he said, "I'm
[1:47:19] just I'm in darkness. I don't know what
[1:47:22] to do." And I said, "I've only got one
[1:47:24] answer for you. Christ. I don't have a
[1:47:28] five-step program. I don't have wise
[1:47:30] words of wisdom.
[1:47:33] I can't give you any decision except let
[1:47:34] Christ into your life." It's the only
[1:47:37] thing that'll change you.
[1:47:39] And it's not just Lord, I want you in my
[1:47:41] life. You got to mean it. You got to get
[1:47:44] down and act like it. Amen. Get into
[1:47:46] Christ. Get down on your knees and seek
[1:47:47] the Holy Ghost until you know beyond a
[1:47:49] shadow of a doubt that you've been
[1:47:51] changed. Your desires have been changed.
[1:47:54] Your mind has been changed. Your focus
[1:47:56] has been changed. Your desires have been
[1:47:57] changed. Your outlook has been changed
[1:48:00] until you know that you're different
[1:48:02] than when you got down. And if it
[1:48:04] doesn't happen in an hour, give them
[1:48:05] two. If it doesn't happen in two, give
[1:48:08] them three. If it doesn't happen in
[1:48:09] three, give them four. and you keep
[1:48:11] going until you get it. That's the only
[1:48:13] answer I've got for you. The word of
[1:48:16] this message won't do it. You've got to
[1:48:18] have the life of it.
[1:48:20] I preach the word, but the spirit's got
[1:48:22] to be in you to receive it. That's the
[1:48:24] only thing that'll make it live. Amen.
[1:48:26] Don't look at yourself. Look at the
[1:48:28] word. For it's unto you and your
[1:48:31] children, and as many as the Lord your
[1:48:33] God shall call. Say, "Lord, I'm one of
[1:48:34] the children. I want your spirit. I want
[1:48:37] Christ inside of me."
[1:48:39] Don't think it's not for you because you
[1:48:41] can't live the life. It's for you
[1:48:43] because you need to live the life. You
[1:48:45] want to live the life. There's something
[1:48:47] in you that's calling for you to live
[1:48:48] the life. But what do you need? You need
[1:48:50] the quickening power of the spirit of
[1:48:52] God to drop into your soul. That's the
[1:48:54] only thing that'll make you live it.
[1:48:55] That's the only thing that'll give you
[1:48:56] the peace and rest you're looking for.
[1:48:58] You You remember way back when we were
[1:49:01] kids, we didn't have a TV, but sometimes
[1:49:03] we go to our friends and watch TV. They
[1:49:05] had Transformers. You remember the
[1:49:07] Transformers and they could turn into
[1:49:08] cars and jets and they had a their theme
[1:49:10] was more than meets the eye. You
[1:49:12] remember that? Anybody? Me and Sister
[1:49:15] Flo and my wife and Joe. There you go.
[1:49:17] The four that ran around watching TV at
[1:49:19] our neighbors houses. That was before
[1:49:21] the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:23] More than meets the eye. That's what I'm
[1:49:26] trying to tell you tonight, church.
[1:49:28] There's more to you than meets the eye.
[1:49:31] Listen, it's not obvious.
[1:49:34] Remember what Paul says? We look through
[1:49:36] a mirror darkly. We don't see everything
[1:49:39] that's going on. We don't see everything
[1:49:41] that we are. We don't see all of what
[1:49:43] God has. Amen. But that really matches
[1:49:45] up with what God used in the past. Look
[1:49:47] at Gideon. He was a nobody from a family
[1:49:50] of nobodies.
[1:49:51] Don't look to be some great thing. Look
[1:49:54] to be humble to the word. David was a
[1:49:56] little shepherd boy. The youngest of a
[1:49:59] family of big men.
[1:50:02] Solomon was a womanizer.
[1:50:05] Jesus came from a bad town with a bad
[1:50:08] background.
[1:50:10] Amen.
[1:50:12] Moses was an outcast and a criminal.
[1:50:14] Rahab was a prostitute. Ruth was an
[1:50:16] idoltor.
[1:50:18] Don't look at the outside church and
[1:50:20] expect that to confirm that you're a
[1:50:21] child of God.
[1:50:23] In the end, the outside will change. But
[1:50:26] you got to get started on the inside. If
[1:50:28] we work on the outside, we're whited at
[1:50:29] seplicers, full of dead men's bones. I
[1:50:32] just read in my devotions this morning,
[1:50:34] if we're trying to fix the outside,
[1:50:37] we've got to get the inside straightened
[1:50:38] out first. Amen. You've got to abide in
[1:50:41] him and his word's got to abide in you.
[1:50:44] That's what's going to do the job. Amen.
[1:50:46] But when the word comes to you, that's
[1:50:48] what makes the difference is that to the
[1:50:50] child of God, when the word comes to
[1:50:51] them, it has an effect. It has a lasting
[1:50:54] effect. It has a real effect. Remember
[1:50:57] Jesus preached the parable of the sewer
[1:50:59] and for some it goes out and it's just
[1:51:01] hauled away. They're in service, they go
[1:51:02] out, they don't get anything. Some come
[1:51:05] in service, they raise their hand, they
[1:51:06] receive it with joy, but there's no root
[1:51:11] and so it goes away and in a week or two
[1:51:13] they're back where they started. The
[1:51:14] other ones, the cares of life, oh, it
[1:51:16] starts to grow a little bit and the
[1:51:18] cares of life choke it out. But there's
[1:51:20] a group that receives it and it's
[1:51:22] watered and it's in the presence of the
[1:51:25] sun. It's in the warmth of the sun and
[1:51:27] it produces 30fold and 60fold and
[1:51:29] 100fold. That's the children of God. The
[1:51:32] word has an effect. It comes all the way
[1:51:34] back to what it was in the beginning.
[1:51:35] Amen.
[1:51:38] You'll take it when nobody else will.
[1:51:39] You'll sit when Brother John is
[1:51:41] preaching a hard series and come back
[1:51:43] and say, "Brother John, keep preaching
[1:51:44] it. We like it. It's helping us. It's
[1:51:46] doing a work in our lives." That's the
[1:51:49] kind of people we're talking about.
[1:51:51] Everyone else not dismissing or
[1:51:53] criticizing me, but that's what they'll
[1:51:54] do. The world will dismiss it. The
[1:51:56] unbeliever will dismiss it. The
[1:51:58] makebeliever will dismiss it. I was
[1:52:01] reading again in my devotions this
[1:52:02] morning where Jesus was talking. I'm
[1:52:04] paraphrasing. He's saying, "You'll
[1:52:06] change the word so that it doesn't apply
[1:52:08] to you." So you can say, "I'm in line
[1:52:10] with the word." That's not what the
[1:52:12] word's there to do. You're supposed to
[1:52:14] be shaped to the word, not the word
[1:52:16] shaped to you. The child of God is
[1:52:18] shaped by the word, not trying to shape
[1:52:20] the word. They let it come. It lets this
[1:52:22] two-edged sword do its work in their
[1:52:24] life. Amen.
[1:52:26] Why? Why can we do that? Why can you
[1:52:29] have a hard service and say, "Praise the
[1:52:31] Lord."
[1:52:34] Why can you have the minister speak
[1:52:35] directly into your life and thank God
[1:52:38] for it even though it hurts?
[1:52:41] Why can you be corrected
[1:52:45] and yet say, "I want more of that." Why
[1:52:47] is it? Are we suckers for punishment?
[1:52:52] I hope not. But why do we do it?
[1:52:56] Because there's a word that's been
[1:52:57] spoken about you. You can't fail. You
[1:53:00] can't fall. You can't miss it. You can't
[1:53:03] be broken.
[1:53:05] That's the reason why. There's something
[1:53:07] inside of you that has nothing to do
[1:53:09] with you and it just keeps coming back
[1:53:11] for more. Why? The word feeds on the
[1:53:14] word.
[1:53:16] And whether it feels good matters not.
[1:53:20] It only feeds on one thing. The word
[1:53:22] keeps coming back to the word of God.
[1:53:25] Listen to this. Speaking of Zion, the
[1:53:28] bride, he says, "They that trust in the
[1:53:30] Lord shall be as mount Zion, which
[1:53:33] cannot be removed, but abideth forever."
[1:53:44] We do bad things, make bad decisions,
[1:53:48] mess things up, get our hands on the
[1:53:50] steering wheel instead of lot God doing
[1:53:52] things,
[1:53:55] get involved in areas we shouldn't get
[1:53:57] involved with,
[1:53:59] look at things, buy things, want things
[1:54:01] we shouldn't, get our priorities mixed
[1:54:04] up, wrong relationships, wrong
[1:54:06] ministries, all these different things
[1:54:10] and God comes behind says Zion cannot be
[1:54:13] removed. You can't undo what's already
[1:54:16] done. When the word goes out, it's
[1:54:18] already done. It's as if it's already
[1:54:20] complete. He says the bride cannot be
[1:54:23] removed, but she abides forever. Why?
[1:54:28] Ephesians 1 1 and5 says, "Having
[1:54:30] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:54:33] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:54:35] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:54:37] will." Predestination, his choosing, not
[1:54:39] mine. That's why we can't be removed is
[1:54:42] because he's chosen us already. He set
[1:54:43] us on a path that we cannot deviate
[1:54:45] from. Why or how? To the praise of the
[1:54:48] glory of his grace wherein he hath made
[1:54:51] us accepted in the beloved.
[1:54:54] So church, what we do is only out of
[1:54:56] thankfulness.
[1:54:58] It's not performance-based.
[1:55:01] Why do we live the lives we do? Why do
[1:55:03] we give God of our time and our energy
[1:55:05] and our focus and our gifts in these
[1:55:07] things? That's not getting us in. We're
[1:55:09] already in.
[1:55:12] Remember what Paul would talk about? He
[1:55:13] says, "Every man's work is going to be
[1:55:14] tried by fire. There's going to be
[1:55:15] people there that have nothing to take
[1:55:17] with them but their soul. But they've
[1:55:18] got their soul." Why? Because he
[1:55:20] predestinated them.
[1:55:22] Why do we give? We give out of love. We
[1:55:25] give it out of appreciation.
[1:55:28] We give it to thank him for what he's
[1:55:30] already done for us.
[1:55:32] It's to the praise of his glory, of his
[1:55:34] grace. Not to make something of
[1:55:36] ourselves, not to make a name for
[1:55:37] ourselves, but to raise him up, to let
[1:55:39] it all go back to him. Amen. He's
[1:55:42] already done the work. We just have to
[1:55:44] accept it. He says, "In whom we have
[1:55:46] redemption through his blood, the
[1:55:48] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:55:50] riches of his grace." In other words,
[1:55:53] church, don't worry about your messes,
[1:55:56] your mistakes, your failures, your
[1:55:58] faults, your flaws.
[1:56:01] It's already a way made through it.
[1:56:03] Washing of water by the word in the
[1:56:05] blood of Jesus Christ. You don't have to
[1:56:07] worry about it. You don't have to worry
[1:56:09] about it. We've already got our
[1:56:10] redemption. We're already redeemed. The
[1:56:12] names are already there. And he's just
[1:56:14] reading them off the book, letting us
[1:56:16] know who we are today. That's all that's
[1:56:18] going on. It's all the riches of the
[1:56:19] grace of God. He says, "Wherein he hath
[1:56:22] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:56:25] prudence." That word abounded is a
[1:56:26] wonderful word. It means he's lavished
[1:56:29] on us.
[1:56:31] We'd say today, "We're some spoiled."
[1:56:36] Don't you hate spoiled kids?
[1:56:39] Answer carefully.
[1:56:42] Because we're his spoiled bride. He's
[1:56:45] pouring out on us.
[1:56:48] What have we done to deserve it? failed
[1:56:50] him. Disappoint. This is our This is our
[1:56:53] view. We failed him. We've disappointed
[1:56:55] him. We've disobeyed him. We've walked
[1:56:57] away from him. Gone in, come out, up,
[1:57:00] down, disbelieve, believed. That's our
[1:57:03] view. What does God see?
[1:57:07] All he sees is somebody that's worthy of
[1:57:10] lavishing wisdom and prudence, wisdom
[1:57:13] and understanding on
[1:57:15] church. I'm telling you, we've got it
[1:57:17] made. How about we start acting like it?
[1:57:20] How about we start walking through our
[1:57:22] day saying he has abounded towards me.
[1:57:25] He is lavishing me. So if I'm missing
[1:57:28] something, it's not because it's not
[1:57:31] there. It's because I haven't availed of
[1:57:33] what he's already given to me. Amen.
[1:57:38] We came dirty, messed up, filthy, and
[1:57:42] God says, "Don't worry about that. I'm
[1:57:44] just going to pour out my wisdom and my
[1:57:45] understanding on you.
[1:57:47] I've made a way. I've redeemed you. He
[1:57:50] doesn't do it sparingly. God's not
[1:57:52] saving up for a rainy day. You know,
[1:57:54] most of us, I hope, we have a savings
[1:57:56] account for when we need a new roof on
[1:57:58] the house, when the car blows up, when
[1:58:01] we lose a job or something. We've got
[1:58:02] something to fall back on. Church, God's
[1:58:04] not holding back anything. The only
[1:58:06] thing holding God back is how much we'll
[1:58:08] let him in, how much we'll accept, how
[1:58:11] much we'll believe. That's the only
[1:58:12] thing that's holding him back. And it
[1:58:14] won't hold him back indefinitely. He's
[1:58:15] going to make a way through even those
[1:58:17] things. He says, "Having made known unto
[1:58:19] us the mystery of his will according to
[1:58:22] his good pleasure which he had purpose
[1:58:25] purposed in himself."
[1:58:28] His pleasure his purpose irrevocable.
[1:58:33] That's it. He can't break his own word.
[1:58:35] He's decided and that's it, church. It's
[1:58:37] a finished work. You can't undo what he
[1:58:39] said.
[1:58:41] Don't test him
[1:58:43] because you'll get spanked.
[1:58:46] But you can't undo it. It's a finished
[1:58:48] work. He says that in the dispensation
[1:58:50] of the fullness of times, he might
[1:58:53] gather gather together in one. One what?
[1:58:56] One flesh, one body, in a union, in a
[1:59:00] marriage, the bride and the Christ. He
[1:59:03] says that he might gather gather
[1:59:04] together in one all things in Christ,
[1:59:07] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:59:10] on earth, even in him. That's the great
[1:59:14] mystery being finished. Christ in you,
[1:59:16] the hope of glory. That which has been
[1:59:18] hidden through all the ages. Christ
[1:59:21] trying to reveal himself through a bride
[1:59:23] all over again. And that's the season
[1:59:24] we're in. That's what this message came
[1:59:26] to do was show us the season we're in.
[1:59:28] Show us who we are. Show us that Christ
[1:59:31] is alive and well and wanting to reveal
[1:59:33] himself in and through his bride.
[1:59:36] Brother Bram said, "My message is to
[1:59:38] declare him. He's here. Jesus Christ the
[1:59:40] same yesterday, today, and forever. How
[1:59:43] do people see him? Through you. Through
[1:59:46] you. You're the mystery that's being
[1:59:48] finished. And that's where we're going
[1:59:49] to go in the next service. Amen. God
[1:59:51] bless you. Let's stand together this
[1:59:53] evening.
[1:59:55] I'm excited, church.
[1:59:59] Like I said, we've had some some pretty
[2:00:01] hard services in the not too distant
[2:00:03] past. Amen. But I'm excited. Now I'm
[2:00:05] getting to preach the really good stuff.
[2:00:09] We preached the checkups. We've pre
[2:00:10] preached it looking at ourselves. We've
[2:00:12] preached at checking yourself up with
[2:00:14] the word of God.
[2:00:17] We preached on the thermometer to check
[2:00:19] where your spirituality is at. But now
[2:00:21] I'm excited. I'm excited by what's
[2:00:24] happening around us.
[2:00:26] I was say talking to someone recently.
[2:00:28] I've said over the pulpit, Israel's down
[2:00:30] to one ally. She's a time piece of God
[2:00:33] and she's down to one ally and that's
[2:00:36] the United States led by a man who can't
[2:00:39] make up his mind. We're that close,
[2:00:42] church, to her having nobody. Canada's
[2:00:45] forsaken her. The UK and France, they're
[2:00:47] going to recognize Palestine. They're
[2:00:48] going to try and force Israel to
[2:00:50] recognize that state in a country that
[2:00:52] belongs to them. They've only got one
[2:00:54] ally.
[2:00:56] I'm talking to people and all I hear is
[2:01:00] fear and doom and gloom.
[2:01:04] Everybody thinks we're going to hell in
[2:01:05] a hand basket or we're already there.
[2:01:07] We're too far behind. We can't recover.
[2:01:09] We can't fix it.
[2:01:12] But I'll tell you what, church, there's
[2:01:13] a bride that's looking up. Cuz Jesus
[2:01:15] said, "When these things happen, look
[2:01:17] up. Your redemption draws nigh." I don't
[2:01:20] see everything that's happening, but I
[2:01:21] see enough to tell me he's coming soon.
[2:01:24] Amen. We're going soon. We're going
[2:01:27] soon. Amen. I don't have to see
[2:01:28] everything, but I have to see enough to
[2:01:30] show me where I am at. And all I'm
[2:01:32] saying is, Lord, help me see who I am in
[2:01:33] all of this. Don't let me fall behind.
[2:01:37] Don't let me get slack.
[2:01:39] Don't let me take things for granted.
[2:01:41] Don't let the fires burn down. Lord,
[2:01:44] keep me in your word. I'll tell you, I'm
[2:01:47] enjoying my devotions more and more
[2:01:48] every day because what I read is jumping
[2:01:51] out of the page because I see what's
[2:01:53] going on around there. But not only
[2:01:55] that, church, but I see what's going on
[2:01:56] in here. And you'll be there and you're
[2:01:59] in prayer and you're thinking about
[2:02:00] things. And then you'll go to the word
[2:02:02] and you'll read the very thing that you
[2:02:03] are looking that that the things that
[2:02:05] you are thinking about, these thoughts
[2:02:06] that come to your mind. When we dwell on
[2:02:08] him, what does he do? He puts his word
[2:02:10] in us. And then we go and we find it and
[2:02:11] we say, "Praise the Lord. He's still
[2:02:14] working on me. He's still talking. He's
[2:02:16] not dead. He's still working in his sons
[2:02:19] and daughters in this earth." Amen. And
[2:02:22] I'll tell you what, it's just a bunch of
[2:02:23] humble little nobies.
[2:02:26] Nobody's going to look at us and think
[2:02:27] we're some great big body.
[2:02:31] At the very end, they may see that final
[2:02:33] manifestation in a way that hasn't been
[2:02:35] seen. But for now, we're just a bunch of
[2:02:37] nobodies living by the word, trusting
[2:02:41] him to do what he said he was going to
[2:02:43] do. Why? Because he chose me.
[2:02:46] And then I recognized him and I said,
[2:02:48] "I'll take you." That's it. It's his
[2:02:50] grace, church. It's his grace covenant
[2:02:52] that we could even respond to him the
[2:02:54] way that we do. I say, "Praise the Lord
[2:02:56] tonight." I'm excited. He's coming soon.
[2:02:59] He's coming soon. We're getting out of
[2:03:00] here soon. Amen. And I trust we're all
[2:03:03] going to be there. Amen. Let's bow our
[2:03:05] heads, each one. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:03:08] with joy in our hearts, we say thank you
[2:03:10] tonight, Lord. Thank you for your
[2:03:12] choosing. Thank you for your
[2:03:13] predestination. Lord, thank you that you
[2:03:15] have a perfect word, Lord, that says we
[2:03:18] will be holy and blameless. we will be
[2:03:20] acceptable in the beloved. Lord, this is
[2:03:23] your work. It's your people. It's your
[2:03:25] promise, Lord. It's your spirit, Lord.
[2:03:28] It's your washing process that's going
[2:03:29] to get us through, Lord. And we've just
[2:03:31] got to sit still and let you do it,
[2:03:33] Lord. We've got to take this by faith,
[2:03:35] Lord, in our mouth and in our mind and
[2:03:37] in our lives and say, Lord, be it unto
[2:03:39] me according to thy word.
[2:03:42] Lord, I pray you raise our faith. Lord,
[2:03:44] raise our expectations. Lord, I pray you
[2:03:46] help us to feed more and more on your
[2:03:48] word, on this end time message you've
[2:03:50] given us, heavenly father. It's here to
[2:03:52] give us rapturing faith. Lord, it's here
[2:03:54] to set us on a path of eternal life
[2:03:56] that'll result in a body change in that
[2:03:58] full adoption. Lord, I pray you help us
[2:04:02] day by day, Lord. Keep our eyes on you,
[2:04:04] Lord, not to let these things going on
[2:04:06] around us get us down, Lord. But may
[2:04:08] they lift us up. May they show us how
[2:04:10] close we are, Lord. May it set our souls
[2:04:12] on fire. may have put a burning inside
[2:04:14] of us, Lord, to draw closer and closer
[2:04:16] to you. We pray, Lord, I pray you bless
[2:04:19] your people, Lord. Be with us. Be with
[2:04:21] those that aren't here tonight, Lord.
[2:04:23] Those that are away, traveling, Lord,
[2:04:25] remembering the Collins family with the
[2:04:26] loss of an aunt, Lord, praying your
[2:04:28] mercy and grace to them for, Lord,
[2:04:30] Sister Freda Snow and the family of
[2:04:32] Brother Albert, Lord, praying your
[2:04:33] continued comfort, Lord, remembering
[2:04:35] these fires that all around us, Lord. We
[2:04:37] pray you send rain, Lord. Pray that you
[2:04:40] give us deliverance from it. But Lord,
[2:04:42] in the meantime, we thank you for your
[2:04:43] grace, Lord, that's kept us safe thus
[2:04:45] far. Lord, be with us now. Bless us,
[2:04:48] Lord, in your presence, we pray. In
[2:04:50] Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[2:04:55] Something keeps holding me. 7:51.
[2:05:03] The trials of this life
[2:05:07] were getting stronger.
[2:05:13] The pull I felt was more than I could
[2:05:18] bear.
[2:05:22] And I was on the verge
[2:05:26] of giving over.
[2:05:32] The strength within myself
[2:05:35] just wasn't there.
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:40] But something keeps holding me.
[2:05:45] Every day I see
[2:05:49] it's helping me faithfully
[2:05:53] to overcome my trials.
[2:05:58] He's guiding me constantly,
[2:06:03] giving me victory.
[2:06:08] It's a reality.
[2:06:11] But something keeps holding me.
[2:06:18] Now Satan lay before me his temptation
[2:06:27] of his desire to steal away my faith.
[2:06:35] But I found within my soul a revelation
[2:06:45] of God's desire to keep me in his grace.
[2:06:53] Something keeps holding me.
[2:06:58] Every day I see
[2:07:02] it's helping me faithfully
[2:07:06] to overcome my trials,

[2:07:21] It's a reality.
[2:07:24] Something keeps holding me.

[2:08:36] cuz something keeps holding me and

[2:20:49] us love.
[2:20:50] You revealed your mystery to us.

[2:20:56] to you. You continue to impact us with
[2:21:00] your word. And you've continued to grow
[2:21:02] us in spirit.
[2:21:04] We are perfect because you have chosen
[2:21:06] us,
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; not because of our work or our will.
[2:21:10] It's all you, Lord. And we thank you,
[2:21:12] Lord, for your desire in us, Lord. We
[2:21:16] thank you for the word that we've heard
[2:21:18] through your servant. We ask that you
[2:21:19] continue to pour into him that he may

[2:21:33] no one can
[2:21:35] get to the depth of it but we know that
[2:21:37] you will fill us Lord with your word
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; and it will give us joy and satisfaction
[2:21:43] Lord Father we pray for all the needs
[2:21:46] here today the callings
[2:21:48] It snows
[2:21:50] our visiting family. We ask that you be
[2:21:53] with them. Comfort them.
[2:21:56] Show them love and mercy. Let your favor
[2:21:58] and grace continue to abide with them.
[2:22:01] Father, the crisis around us.
[2:22:04] It's only there for us to give testimony
[2:22:07] that we have a God that reigns. We have
[2:22:09] a God that we serve and we have a God we
[2:22:11] believe in.

[2:22:16] rain, but there is nothing you cannot
[2:22:18] do. Lord, we stand in faith and we
[2:22:21] continue to hope in faith that you will
[2:22:23] come to our mercy and you will change
[2:22:26] this
[2:22:29] happenings around us.

[2:22:34] homes and that you show them mercy. Help
[2:22:37] them to go through these difficult
[2:22:39] times. Summer is supposed to be a joyful
[2:22:42] and happy time like we all say in

[2:22:46] difficulties, Lord. But we know that you
[2:22:49] have a solution and let them see you see
[2:22:52] that you are touching their lives and
[2:22:54] you're there for them in these moments,
[2:22:55] Lord, in the name of Jesus.
[2:22:59] But as we go back home, we ask for your
[2:23:01] grace. We ask for protection. Guide us
[2:23:03] home. And let this word that we have
[2:23:06] taken today not be one of those words
[2:23:08] that stimulate us intellectually but let
[2:23:11] it cause a quickening and a changing in
[2:23:13] us. Let it be a reflection of this word
[2:23:16] in our outward appearance more so in our
[2:23:19] inward. Thank you Lord for the grace and
[2:23:22] the opportunity to always come to your
[2:23:23] presence and to hear your word and to
[2:23:26] pray to you. To you be all the glory and
[2:23:30] all the honor now and forever more. for
[2:23:34] in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
