[49:11] revelation of the alpha oh yeah that was
[49:13] god yes but what about the omega because
[49:16] it's the same god revealing himself
[49:18] amen it's the same god he caught he was
[49:21] with him then he's with us now praise
[49:23] the lord hallelujah because he said i'll
[49:26] never leave you and never forsake you
[49:29] amen he kept that promise to israel he's
[49:32] keeping that promise to israel and he's
[49:34] kept that promise for his bride gentile
[49:36] bride and he's keeping it now oh yeah he
[49:39] was there brother when he went he just
[49:41] moved off on the on the day of pentecost
[49:43] there and he went out and preached it to
[49:44] this preacher that the gentiles amen
[49:47] praise the lord and he said he still
[49:49] never left them amen right on down
[49:51] through he had that gentile seed many
[49:53] are called amen not saying all the calls
[49:56] are lost but the truth chosen is the
[49:59] right
[50:00] or let's let's get the right revelation
[50:02] brother
[50:03] god and just thank god you know
[50:05] sometimes brother with certain
[50:07] revelation we think god god got an awful
[50:09] attitude we think god got an awful
[50:10] spirit now for this no brother is not
[50:13] amen so we pray the grace of god we're
[50:15] going to have the right revelation of
[50:17] god amen because brother what he is
[50:20] and how he is that's the way the
[50:22] brightest
[50:23] amen this amen the spirit that he
[50:26] reveals and manifests amen that's the
[50:29] spirit the bride is going to have
[50:31] amen oh yeah you got to have a right
[50:33] spirit and the right attitude

[50:37] god that he had to even exhort the
[50:39] prophet concerning it amen oh yes keep

[50:50] and angel don't you do that
[50:52] he said that some of them are my
[50:53] children
[50:54] amen because over the years i've seen
[50:56] so-called believers condemn everybody
[50:58] outside the message don't do that amen
[51:01] because the blood they call you the
[51:03] message is that it's for the bride amen
[51:06] but brother still as i said they are the
[51:08] ones who are going to live in the city
[51:10] what about the ones outside the city
[51:12] amen as the power of god warned us he
[51:15] said you're going to be surprised he
[51:16] said who made it
[51:18] amen you'll be surprised you didn't make
[51:20] it oh yeah is that right oh yes i
[51:22] believe that amen we're getting down to
[51:25] really true believers
[51:27] amen the brother is coming to that place
[51:30] and our faith is being absolutely tested
[51:33] absolutely
[51:34] oh well we believe the message brother
[51:36] it's going to come down to a greater
[51:38] test of your faith than that do you
[51:40] believe god
[51:41] when it comes to saying believe the
[51:42] message but i'll tell you this what what
[51:45] what will happen and what's going on
[51:47] it's going to challenge your faith in
[51:48] god
[51:49] do you believe god
[51:50] oh lord if you you really exist this
[51:53] this wouldn't be like this this would oh
[51:55] yes it will amen see that doesn't prove
[51:58] god's wrong that proves the devil
[52:01] amen that shows you there's a devil that
[52:03] he's warned us about amen so brother
[52:06] they had to deal with him in in eternity
[52:08] oh yeah
[52:09] yeah before before the the creation in
[52:12] genesis 1 1. amen still dealing with the
[52:14] devil he said you walked up and down in
[52:16] the coast of fire they say amen human
[52:20] even in eden he said the garden of god
[52:21] and so on amen oh brother sister giving
[52:25] us the revelation beyond our guard stay
[52:27] with the truth stay with the word amen
[52:31] the whole truth nothing but the truth
[52:33] the grace of god be with us and if
[52:35] there's ever an hour we need to get into
[52:37] that position it's these last days amen

[52:46] revelation we need the faith we need the
[52:48] revelation amen praise the lord to move

[54:14] given him in his heart just think he
[54:17] didn't write no preachers there
[54:19] as i said god was the
[54:21] god god was an evangelist the devil was

[55:08] but
[55:10] he wants to add his butts
[55:12] whether the butt says again
[55:14] we so thankful we won't forget brother
[55:16] folks amen then when he ministered here
[55:18] years ago amen he said the butts are for
[55:21] the goats
[55:22] he said the goat's butt amen
[55:25] oh brother sister grace to us and you

[1:05:49] spiritual
[1:05:51] by the grace of god it's exactly as the
[1:05:53] prophet of god said
[1:05:55] one time to his own natural family his
[1:05:57] his sibling brothers
[1:06:00] and maybe sisters
[1:06:02] and they met for the last time i believe
[1:06:05] it was at
[1:06:07] their mother's funeral
[1:06:10] and brother brown told him
[1:06:12] well he said when they separated and so
[1:06:14] on et cetera i guess you understand now
[1:06:16] you know he said we're not going to see
[1:06:18] each other very much anymore
[1:06:20] he said we've only seen each other
[1:06:21] because we come to meet
[1:06:23] we come to see mom he said and he said
[1:06:25] we we meet one another
[1:06:27] but he said now that she's gone he said
[1:06:29] we won't be back
[1:06:31] so we won't see another brother
[1:06:33] i trust grace that we're going to put
[1:06:35] the spiritual family ahead of the
[1:06:36] natural
[1:06:38] right of this there's still too many
[1:06:40] so-called believers they've got more

[1:14:58] more of a challenge to us in in in our
[1:15:00] physical beings oh yes the enemy is
[1:15:03] there
[1:15:04] brother he was there in the beginning
[1:15:05] challenging yeah the spiritual
[1:15:07] revelation amen oh you just believe just
[1:15:10] believe this believe that but he didn't
[1:15:12] want us to to go forth and apply it and
[1:15:14] brother but god wants us to apply it
[1:15:17] god oh yeah god's desire to apply it in
[1:15:19] our everyday lives amen to it is a
[1:15:22] witness to the world by the grace of god
[1:15:26] the witness to the world what god has
[1:15:27] done as a witness to the world what
[1:15:29] god's doing
[1:15:31] oh yeah
[1:15:32] so i i would would god be able to raise
[1:15:34] you up
[1:15:35] amen because the the prophet of god said
[1:15:37] oh yeah he said oh
[1:15:39] the devil was there and the unbelievers
[1:15:41] were there they didn't believe this
[1:15:42] didn't believe this but god said i did
[1:15:44] this i did that and he said he'll call
[1:15:46] you on the scene but he said do and what
[1:15:48] he'll do is you're short in the sky and
[1:15:51] oh yeah
[1:15:52] like we said a video
[1:15:54] he said and then you'll see a short oh

[1:15:58] living jesus there's you manifesting the
[1:16:00] word there's you doing this doing that

[1:16:08] be condemned
[1:16:10] by the witness that you're with you're
[1:16:12] doing by the life you're living
[1:16:14] oh yeah by your spirit and your attitude
[1:16:16] because when they come before god and
[1:16:18] deny this and deny that
[1:16:20] the prophet of god said he'll open it up
[1:16:22] and he said oh there's you
[1:16:24] he said you're you're manifesting
[1:16:26] what what they are denying
[1:16:29] god said oh yeah i was a witness look
[1:16:31] there's me he was in you he was in the
[1:16:33] brothers in the sisters in his sons in
[1:16:35] his daughters amen
[1:16:37] so brother
[1:16:38] can god use your life as a testimony as
[1:16:40] a witness
[1:16:41] of the word
[1:16:43] amen and by it he will judge the world
[1:16:46] praise the lord amen not just this
[1:16:50] but it's you and me
[1:16:51] the word in us
[1:16:53] because he made it flesh he made it real
[1:16:56] amen oh yeah this is the word here but i
[1:16:58] said i want to show it to you over there
[1:17:00] in this in this brother in this sister
[1:17:02] and this son in this daughter amen
[1:17:05] praise god
[1:17:06] god have mercy on us
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:10] in 1st timothy chapter 6
[1:17:13] and verse
[1:17:14] 6. but godliness with contentment
[1:17:19] is great gain
[1:17:21] oh my
[1:17:22] brother considering
[1:17:25] the separation unto the lord that comes
[1:17:27] with this word
[1:17:28] are we are we willing to stay separated
[1:17:31] oh
[1:17:32] just think
[1:17:34] are you willing in the resurrection
[1:17:35] rapture are you are you just willing to
[1:17:37] even looking forward to just going going
[1:17:39] into in the glory going into eternity
[1:17:41] getting into a glorified body amen and
[1:17:44] oh
[1:17:45] but there's family friends neighbors
[1:17:48] that you'll never see again
[1:17:52] unfortunately there's too many
[1:17:54] believers that are putting too much
[1:17:56] emphasis on their relationship with
[1:17:57] natural family
[1:17:59] and not the spiritual
[1:18:02] god help us
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:06] he said but godliness with contentment
[1:18:08] is great gain
[1:18:09] for we brought nothing into this world
[1:18:12] and it is certain we can carry nothing
[1:18:15] out
[1:18:17] and having food and raiment let us be
[1:18:20] there with content but they that will be
[1:18:22] rich
[1:18:23] fall into temptation and a snare
[1:18:26] amen
[1:18:27] and into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[1:18:31] which drown men in destruction and
[1:18:34] perdition
[1:18:36] for the love of money is the root of all
[1:18:40] evil
[1:18:42] which while some coveted after they have
[1:18:45] erred from the faith
[1:18:47] and pierced themselves through
[1:18:49] with many sorrows amen
[1:18:53] but thou o man of god
[1:18:55] flee these things and follow after
[1:18:58] righteousness amen
[1:19:00] god help us every day follow after
[1:19:02] righteousness the word made flesh in you
[1:19:06] and follow after righteousness and
[1:19:08] godliness faith
[1:19:11] love
[1:19:12] patience
[1:19:14] meekness
[1:19:17] fight the good fight of faith
[1:19:20] lay hold on eternal life where unto thou
[1:19:23] art also called
[1:19:24] and has professed a good profession
[1:19:28] before
[1:19:29] many witnesses
[1:19:31] amen god bless you maybe it's heated
[1:19:33] fight the good fight of faith turn with
[1:19:35] me to ii timothy chapter 4.
[1:19:44] in verse 7.
[1:19:51] let's see
[1:19:57] in verse 5 he said watch thou in all
[1:19:59] things
[1:20:01] amen
[1:20:02] endure afflictions
[1:20:05] do the work of an evangelist
[1:20:08] make full proof of thy ministry
[1:20:11] amen make full proof of the life the
[1:20:14] christian life you profess
[1:20:16] amen for i am now ready to be offered
[1:20:21] and the time of my departure
[1:20:24] is at hand
[1:20:27] i have fought a good fight
[1:20:29] i have finished my course
[1:20:32] i have kept the faith
[1:20:35] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:20:37] crown of righteousness which the lord
[1:20:40] the righteous judge
[1:20:42] shall give me at that day
[1:20:44] oh thank god for such faith
[1:20:47] amen
[1:20:49] and not to me only but unto all them
[1:20:52] also that love is appearing
[1:20:58] and he said do thy diligence to come
[1:21:00] shortly unto me
[1:21:01] for demeth has forsaken me having loved
[1:21:04] his this present world
[1:21:06] he handles too many believers that love
[1:21:08] they got more love for the present world
[1:21:10] than they do for the world to come
[1:21:12] amen
[1:21:13] brother if we got a love for the world
[1:21:15] to come we'll have a greater hunger and
[1:21:17] thirst for that for that world than for
[1:21:19] this one
[1:21:20] amen
[1:21:23] and it says having loved this present
[1:21:26] world
[1:21:27] i pray grace
[1:21:29] that we don't love it
[1:21:32] surely how in the world would you love
[1:21:34] it as i said our grandparents and the
[1:21:36] old generation to come back they
[1:21:37] wouldn't want to stay
[1:21:40] amen if they're a christian amen their
[1:21:42] faith in god
[1:21:44] they want to get out of here
[1:21:46] they wouldn't they wouldn't want to go
[1:21:48] out into that world no more
[1:21:50] what about us do we want to get out
[1:21:52] i pray god we do
[1:21:56] amen
[1:21:57] and he said is departed unto
[1:21:59] thessalonica
[1:22:00] he's a crescent to galatia titus under
[1:22:04] de la media and only luke is with me
[1:22:07] take mark and bring him with thee for he
[1:22:10] is profitable for to me for the ministry
[1:22:13] amen god bless his word amen
[1:22:17] so i want to share with you some
[1:22:19] thoughts
[1:22:20] and some quotes of the prophet
[1:22:22] concerning spiritual warfare
[1:22:27] i believe that abel he was involved in a
[1:22:29] spiritual warfare
[1:22:30] i believe all those that stood for god
[1:22:32] and believed god and believed his word
[1:22:34] and stayed with his word brother they
[1:22:36] were in a spiritual warfare
[1:22:38] because the amen the enemy was there to
[1:22:40] challenge their faith he was there to
[1:22:42] challenge abel's faith he's there to
[1:22:44] challenge at noah's faith and he's there
[1:22:46] to challenge the faith of the prophets
[1:22:48] the faith of the of the true sincere
[1:22:50] jews all the way down through the ages
[1:22:52] he's there to challenge jesus faith amen
[1:22:55] that's exactly the truth and brother
[1:22:57] he's there to challenge the faith of the
[1:22:59] bride and brother so much so that i
[1:23:01] believe there was something like so 60
[1:23:03] odd million christians that were laid
[1:23:06] down their lives amen what for it was
[1:23:09] for their faith
[1:23:10] they were challenged even there was a
[1:23:12] time when there was a certain sister and
[1:23:14] they they she had a child there and they
[1:23:16] were going to kill the child and they
[1:23:18] they challenged the sister and they said
[1:23:20] all right they said if you if you don't
[1:23:22] deny what you what you say you believe
[1:23:24] they say we're gonna we're gonna kill
[1:23:26] this child
[1:23:27] and they said if but if you deny it then
[1:23:29] we'll let the child live and she said
[1:23:31] let the child die
[1:23:33] what
[1:23:34] would you take that stand
[1:23:36] as a mother as a father will you take
[1:23:38] that stand to let the child die to let
[1:23:40] let some other member of your family die
[1:23:42] amen would you have that faith in god
[1:23:46] amen and then and she was challenging
[1:23:49] their ideas she was telling me what they
[1:23:50] were thinking and they said you mean to
[1:23:52] tell me that you're going to let us kill
[1:23:54] the kill this son it's your son
[1:23:56] she said let him go she said she said
[1:23:58] we'll meet in glory
[1:23:59] amen
[1:24:00] she said if you kill him you kill me she
[1:24:03] said i'm going to meet him amen why
[1:24:05] because hallelujah he was going to get
[1:24:07] out of that body and into a glorified
[1:24:08] body amen so brother she had a
[1:24:11] tremendous faith and 68 million
[1:24:13] believers 68 million christians down
[1:24:16] through the ages lay down their lives
[1:24:18] for the gospel laid down their lives for
[1:24:20] the testimony that they were professing
[1:24:22] concerning jesus amen so brother how
[1:24:25] much are we going to lay down how much
[1:24:27] are we going to sacrifice amen for what
[1:24:29] we believe and because we believe this
[1:24:31] because we believe that and brother i
[1:24:33] tell you that more and more is going to
[1:24:35] happen in the world to challenge our
[1:24:37] faith
[1:24:38] they're challenging it right now
[1:24:39] concerning how we get together and how
[1:24:41] we worship amen that you can only have
[1:24:44] 50 of a church
[1:24:46] allowed to go in into a church and when
[1:24:48] you get into the church you got to sit

[1:32:51] sitting absolutely centers and living
[1:32:53] sinful they came up and got the water
[1:32:55] and went on and then the others would go
[1:32:57] get the water but jesus went to get
[1:33:00] water when she was there

[1:33:05] he knew what she was guilty of
[1:33:07] he knew what she had done amen oh but

[1:33:17] criticize and condemn him amen
[1:33:20] god help us brother oh yes i've seen oh
[1:33:23] yes indeed
[1:33:25] i've seen even many believers keep a
[1:33:27] wrong attitude and wrong spirit towards

[1:33:47] as i said i've seen i've seen many a
[1:33:49] believer take that attitude in that

[1:36:39] a right attitude
[1:36:42] no matter who you meet
[1:36:44] by the grace of god
[1:36:47] probably god said he said now we thank
[1:36:49] thee that in this great hour that when
[1:36:51] all hopes of mortal life has finished
[1:36:55] he said atomic bombs are laying in
[1:36:56] hangars
[1:36:57] he said hydrogen bombs sickness disease
[1:37:00] and germ warfare he said oh he said
[1:37:02] everything the way they it is
[1:37:05] knowing that the bible said that man
[1:37:07] would actually rot in their flesh
[1:37:10] and he said amen
[1:37:11] but that angel was given commission
[1:37:14] don't you touch any of those do not come
[1:37:17] near those that had the wine and the oil
[1:37:19] don't touch those who have the seal of
[1:37:22] god upon their forage amen brother
[1:37:26] as it was then so it is now
[1:37:28] god is there to defend them god's dear
[1:37:30] defend us

[1:37:34] truth if we have the anointing the holy
[1:37:36] ghost and the life of god with us amen
[1:37:39] he's there to defend us
[1:37:41] amen he's there to defend you
[1:37:43] now i know that i gave this quote to a
[1:37:46] certain brother one time and
[1:37:48] oh
[1:37:48] it's just within hours that it when he
[1:37:51] preached he he condemned it not
[1:37:53] condemned the quote he condemned me for
[1:37:55] for applying it the way that i did
[1:37:56] because he felt he said that's just the
[1:37:58] jews no no because i said this was in
[1:38:01] 1960. the prophet mentioned in 1954 the
[1:38:04] prophet quoted again in 1964 amen and he
[1:38:07] and he and and it got bigger and bigger
[1:38:09] and bigger amen not just for the jews
[1:38:13] but he but for the gentiles amen as well
[1:38:17] boy he warned about the german warfare
[1:38:20] he said coming up on all without the
[1:38:22] holy ghost
[1:38:24] he warned of that and i got that quote
[1:38:26] here right here
[1:38:29] in 1954 and he said what is a cancer
[1:38:33] what is a disease he said we'll deal on
[1:38:36] that for the next five minutes now and
[1:38:38] he said what caused that thing
[1:38:41] he said
[1:38:42] or anything you wish to take he said
[1:38:46] tuberculosis pneumonia whatever you wish
[1:38:49] any disease is a diseases or germs
[1:38:53] and let me pass something here quickly
[1:38:55] and he said listen he said did you know
[1:38:58] the bible predicts that in the last days
[1:39:00] that there will be a germ warfare
[1:39:03] and he said that disease will break out
[1:39:05] upon the people and will fall on
[1:39:08] everyone without the baptism of the holy
[1:39:11] spirit
[1:39:12] amen
[1:39:15] oh yeah that preacher went online
[1:39:18] and preached and
[1:39:20] quoted it
[1:39:21] and he said
[1:39:23] but he said that
[1:39:24] he said he's only talking about the jews
[1:39:26] not the gentiles
[1:39:29] but
[1:39:30] he not only probably applied it to the
[1:39:31] jews he applied to the gentiles
[1:39:34] he applied it to all
[1:39:35] amen what the
[1:39:37] german warfare
[1:39:39] brother he's not jews are going to have
[1:39:41] germ warfare we're all dealing with the
[1:39:43] german warfare
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:47] and so he said listen it'll come upon
[1:39:49] all without the baptism of the holy
[1:39:51] spirit but with the angel or a church
[1:39:54] over these plagues was given orders to
[1:39:57] touch no one on whom the mark was amen
[1:40:01] praise the lord he said why he said how
[1:40:03] much kind of teachers have we got to
[1:40:05] he's a to be brethren to get the church
[1:40:08] in order to be in that condition
[1:40:12] church
[1:40:13] he quoted explain it to the church
[1:40:16] amen
[1:40:18] he said immune he said my arms are sore
[1:40:20] now from where the doctors had punched
[1:40:22] needles in to try and inoculate me said
[1:40:25] from yellow fever and he said and so
[1:40:28] forth and i told them i didn't need it
[1:40:30] but they wouldn't listen to me but i'll
[1:40:32] tell you what god's going to do
[1:40:34] god's got to share them and it's called
[1:40:36] the holy ghost
[1:40:38] amen praise the lord hallelujah brother
[1:40:41] yes you get the holy ghost but at the
[1:40:43] same time if if if the required of a man
[1:40:45] wants you to take this take that will
[1:40:47] you you got to do it for a certain
[1:40:48] reason go do it and go on
[1:40:50] you're still trusting the lord
[1:40:52] oh yes you've still got faith in god
[1:40:55] amen amen
[1:40:58] so he said god's got a serum and it's
[1:41:00] called the holy ghost and when that

[1:41:22] it is knowing that the bible said that
[1:41:24] man would actually rot in their flesh
[1:41:28] amen but the angel was given the
[1:41:30] commission
[1:41:32] he said don't touch those who as the
[1:41:35] seal of god upon their forehead and we
[1:41:39] realize that the baptism of the holy
[1:41:41] ghost is the seal of god
[1:41:44] amen and brother that's the that's to
[1:41:47] guard us from the germ warfare
[1:41:50] amen that's to keep us from the german
[1:41:52] warfare god help us

[1:42:08] and god will judge those who through
[1:42:09] fear
[1:42:10] pay more attention to the health and
[1:42:13] well-being of their physical bodies
[1:42:15] amen then the health of their souls
[1:42:20] yeah
[1:42:21] they're very concerned over their
[1:42:22] physical health
[1:42:24] and they're going to do this they're
[1:42:25] going to do this they're going to do
[1:42:26] that i'm going to do this i'm going to
[1:42:27] take this and take this home
[1:42:30] that's fine
[1:42:31] but even if you do that you're still
[1:42:32] going to have faith in god
[1:42:34] that it's going to work
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:39] brother
[1:42:39] you've still got to have faith in god
[1:42:41] that whatever you're going to take well

[1:42:44] if you even if you went to a doctor
[1:42:46] still trust the lord
[1:42:48] your faith is in god not the doctor
[1:42:50] your faith is in god not the medicine

[1:43:17] physical health and financial prosperity
[1:43:21] but god will destroy both and if they
[1:43:23] kept their souls healthy with more and
[1:43:25] more of the presence of god he would
[1:43:27] give health
[1:43:28] and strength to the body as it pleases
[1:43:31] him
[1:43:32] amen we need more of the baptism of the

[1:43:52] of jesus that your vitamin is going to

[1:45:35] brother
[1:45:37] more and more
[1:45:39] man is trusting man
[1:45:41] that's right that's why they're going to
[1:45:42] come under the antichrist
[1:45:45] why because their their greater faith is
[1:45:47] going to be in man
[1:45:49] not in god
[1:45:51] amen the enemy knows that the devil
[1:45:53] knows that
[1:45:57] he said listen he said that russia ever
[1:46:00] comes to the united states
[1:46:04] he said which is one of the leading
[1:46:05] nations of the western world he said
[1:46:07] they wouldn't want to blow it up and
[1:46:09] they could do it if they wanted to right
[1:46:11] now or they could blow that up but
[1:46:13] they'll never do it because they would
[1:46:15] destroy everything and they want the
[1:46:18] wealth of the nation
[1:46:20] and it says so therefore they'll try to
[1:46:22] put them to
[1:46:24] sleep they're not going to try they're
[1:46:27] not going to go out and and russia is
[1:46:28] not going to go and claim this nation
[1:46:30] that nation by
[1:46:31] bombs and bombs no they want the nation
[1:46:35] and they and they want the wealth of the
[1:46:36] nation they want this and that
[1:46:38] amen so that they've got all their plans
[1:46:42] oh yeah
[1:46:42] to control
[1:46:44] those nations
[1:46:46] are there plans to control america
[1:46:48] definitely
[1:46:53] he said one thing i do not think the war
[1:46:55] will be missile warfare but i think
[1:46:57] it'll be a spiritual warfare
[1:47:00] amen brother we're in a spiritual
[1:47:02] warfare
[1:47:04] yeah
[1:47:05] to get out of time and into eternity
[1:47:08] amen
[1:47:09] and brother
[1:47:11] the world's in a spirit in a in a
[1:47:12] warfare
[1:47:14] yeah but it's a political warfare amen
[1:47:17] a spiritual warfare because it was
[1:47:19] satan's influence
[1:47:22] you know using this nation to overcome
[1:47:24] this nation this nation to conquer that
[1:47:26] nation god help us
[1:47:31] brother
[1:47:32] we're not going to change what's going
[1:47:33] on out there
[1:47:35] i pray grace that we'll change what's
[1:47:36] going on here
[1:47:42] we can't change that we're not going to
[1:47:43] stop that but brothers anything we need
[1:47:45] to do is to be conscious of the
[1:47:47] spiritual warfare that we're we're into
[1:47:50] that we're fighting the enemy
[1:47:52] and how are we fighting the enemy
[1:47:54] amen brothers only on the weapon that
[1:47:56] god has given us is his word
[1:47:58] and the enemy is there to challenge the
[1:48:00] word
[1:48:01] oh yeah
[1:48:02] challenging what you believe
[1:48:05] yea god said but
[1:48:08] forget his butts
[1:48:10] stay with what god said
[1:48:13] amen
[1:48:18] again he said 1961 he said there is
[1:48:21] nothing really in the world that we can
[1:48:23] build our hopes on
[1:48:26] upon any achievement that we could give
[1:48:28] in this world because there aren't any
[1:48:30] hopes for it there is only one hope and
[1:48:33] that is christ
[1:48:35] amen and that's true amen
[1:48:38] in 1962 and he said we see that the
[1:48:41] astronomers are predicting sometime he
[1:48:44] said in this early part of the first
[1:48:46] part of the month they're beginning on
[1:48:48] the second
[1:48:50] somewhere along this month the indian
[1:48:52] astronomers are predicting the world to
[1:48:54] blow to pieces
[1:48:56] the american newspapers make fun of it i
[1:48:59] do not believe the world is going to
[1:49:01] blow to pieces but i do say
[1:49:03] it's wrong to make fun of it
[1:49:08] because something is fixing to happen
[1:49:10] one of these days and something similar
[1:49:12] to that he said when the five planets
[1:49:15] mars jupiter venus and so forth comes
[1:49:18] into their constellation
[1:49:19] he said they never have done it but oh
[1:49:22] my they claimed maybe 25 000 years ago
[1:49:26] but who was back there to know it
[1:49:28] he said i predict
[1:49:30] he says that this as a spiritual
[1:49:32] application
[1:49:34] amen man is applying it physically we're
[1:49:37] applying it spiritually
[1:49:39] amen
[1:49:40] he said i believe it's the coming
[1:49:44] in the issue of god
[1:49:46] and he said that great revelation of the
[1:49:48] word will be opened during this time
[1:49:51] amen remember they claim it was three
[1:49:54] stars coming into the orbit when jesus
[1:49:56] was born and this is five and five is
[1:49:59] grace amen
[1:50:02] five is the number of grace
[1:50:05] and he said remember is god sends
[1:50:07] god's grace sent it and god sends
[1:50:10] anything to us it'll be his grace and
[1:50:12] not our marriage
[1:50:15] oh no
[1:50:16] brothers
[1:50:18] by grace through faith we're saved
[1:50:21] we didn't none of us deserved it
[1:50:25] no it's about grace prevail to give it
[1:50:28] to us
[1:50:30] amen
[1:50:32] he said it may mean nothing i predict
[1:50:34] that there will be a change and i don't
[1:50:36] know what it'll be but i believe it is
[1:50:38] fixing to happen
[1:50:40] and we write on the eve of it right now
[1:50:43] oh my what would he say now
[1:50:47] what would he say now
[1:50:50] and if we knew god knew this great
[1:50:52] warfare was coming on between right and
[1:50:54] wrong and he knew what the enemy was
[1:50:57] going to do he knew just exactly how to
[1:50:59] equip his people and if we noticed the
[1:51:02] very first thing that god equipped his
[1:51:04] children he said being infinite he knew
[1:51:06] what it took to defeat satan any time
[1:51:09] amen
[1:51:10] on any condition
[1:51:12] now he wouldn't say i will give them
[1:51:14] something here and then a few years
[1:51:16] later i may study out something better
[1:51:19] to give them and then after a few years
[1:51:21] later something else
[1:51:22] he said like we in the military force he
[1:51:25] said the old bull and arrow
[1:51:28] then a sledge rock hammer
[1:51:31] after the bow and arrow came the musket
[1:51:33] after the musket came the springfield
[1:51:35] and now now the atomic weapons
[1:51:38] see we keep going more but god at the
[1:51:41] beginning gave his children the atomic
[1:51:42] weapon because he is the infinite god
[1:51:46] god goes he goes on to explain that god
[1:51:48] has given us his word
[1:51:50] yeah
[1:51:51] to defeat the enemy amen
[1:51:54] the word that they needed in abel's day
[1:51:55] he hated the word in the in the days of
[1:51:58] the prophets and the jews and the
[1:52:00] gentiles amen the church ages he gave
[1:52:02] them the word
[1:52:04] they needed they needed this word to
[1:52:06] defeat the enemy they needed that word
[1:52:08] that revelation and amen and he got
[1:52:10] bigger and bigger and bigger amen praise
[1:52:13] the lord unto finally the mystery of god
[1:52:16] was revealed
[1:52:17] oh hallelujah
[1:52:19] hallelujah the mystery of god
[1:52:21] revealed to the bride to give her the
[1:52:23] power over all the power of the enemy
[1:52:27] by the mystery of god
[1:52:32] praise the lord see you've got a greater
[1:52:34] revelation of the god you serve
[1:52:36] and that gives you more and more power
[1:52:38] over the devil
[1:52:41] amen
[1:52:44] and he said we knew god knew this great
[1:52:46] warfare was coming on between right and
[1:52:48] wrong
[1:52:49] he knew that the enemy was going to do
[1:52:51] what the enemy was going to do and he
[1:52:54] knew just exactly how to equip his
[1:52:56] people amen he knew what it took to
[1:52:59] defeat satan any time
[1:53:01] amen
[1:53:03] and he said now he said he wouldn't say
[1:53:05] i will give them something here and then
[1:53:07] a few years later i may study out
[1:53:08] something better to give them
[1:53:10] and then he said after a few years later
[1:53:12] something else and he said like we in
[1:53:14] military force
[1:53:16] the old bow and arrow and so on he said
[1:53:19] on to the atomic weapons
[1:53:22] and now he said we see growing more
[1:53:25] but god at the beginning gave his
[1:53:26] children the atomic weapon because he is
[1:53:29] the infinite god
[1:53:31] amen
[1:53:32] why brother the weapon he gave him in
[1:53:34] the beginning the weapon he gave us now
[1:53:36] is his word
[1:53:40] amen
[1:53:41] and seeing there was going to be a
[1:53:43] conflict and there was going to be a
[1:53:44] battle god equipped his children with
[1:53:46] the right kind of ammunition
[1:53:49] and he said the right kind of attack the
[1:53:50] right kind of everything that they
[1:53:52] needed
[1:53:53] that would sweep them all the way from
[1:53:56] eden
[1:53:57] listen
[1:53:59] god give us what we need
[1:54:01] to sweep us all the way from
[1:54:03] eden
[1:54:04] to
[1:54:05] the rapture
[1:54:09] the devil is there to stop this stop
[1:54:11] this stop that stop that blessing that
[1:54:13] blessing and brother he's there to stop
[1:54:15] the rapture
[1:54:17] amen
[1:54:20] but god has given us what we need
[1:54:22] taking us from the eden to the rapture
[1:54:26] and he said what was it that god gave
[1:54:28] them
[1:54:30] he said it was his
[1:54:34] word where's our faith it's the word
[1:54:40] how many of us really are
[1:54:42] using the weapon as a word of the word
[1:54:45] against the enemy
[1:54:47] when the enemy comes in how many of us
[1:54:50] respond satan
[1:54:53] it is written
[1:54:55] satan it is written
[1:54:57] yeah well that's how jesus responded
[1:55:02] he was the example for us
[1:55:05] now you don't have to fight the devil
[1:55:07] just say the devil is there to fight you
[1:55:09] the devil's there to bring us down and
[1:55:11] god is there to bring us up now
[1:55:13] by the word
[1:55:14] oh satan it's written
[1:55:18] is written
[1:55:19] that's the weapon that god has given us
[1:55:21] against the enemy
[1:55:23] brother god help us
[1:55:25] please
[1:55:26] let's put more and more answers on the
[1:55:28] word of god
[1:55:30] by the grace of god on just two just too
[1:55:33] much champions i believe sometimes it's
[1:55:34] just on oh this doctrine this doctrine
[1:55:37] that doctrine
[1:55:38] oh my but brother we need to overcome
[1:55:41] the enemy
[1:55:43] that's there to fight us and there to
[1:55:45] discourage us he's there to weaken us
[1:55:49] amen we believe this we want to believe
[1:55:51] that we're believing this believe god
[1:55:53] god is doing this god's doing that
[1:55:56] and the enemy is getting that getting us
[1:55:57] trying to get us there to question it
[1:55:59] brother you better know the word
[1:56:02] then wonder he said thy word have i hid
[1:56:04] in my heart
[1:56:06] that i might not sin against thee
[1:56:08] amen
[1:56:10] what a sin against god
[1:56:12] yeah unbelief
[1:56:14] it's the greatest sin
[1:56:16] oh well they did this they did that yeah
[1:56:18] but
[1:56:19] the end result the result of that is
[1:56:21] unbelief
[1:56:23] brother
[1:56:24] god thy word have i hid in my heart
[1:56:27] that we won't sin against god we want
[1:56:28] disbelieve god we'll believe his word
[1:56:31] amen
[1:56:33] it is written
[1:56:35] amen
[1:56:36] and he said you know in this warfare
[1:56:39] between nations there's a great warfare
[1:56:41] going on beyond that and he said that's
[1:56:43] the warfare between god and satan
[1:56:46] a great warfare and that was the first
[1:56:49] warfare and it is still raging
[1:56:52] and oh i'm so glad it'll soon come to an
[1:56:55] end
[1:56:56] hallelujah and he says satan has his
[1:56:59] agents out everywhere watching spying he
[1:57:02] said on god's people and god moves and
[1:57:05] he said the enemy is sitting everywhere
[1:57:07] watching to see what he can do and god's
[1:57:10] got some
[1:57:11] out
[1:57:13] there too
[1:57:15] he said we're thankful
[1:57:16] for what god's done
[1:57:21] and again in 1962 he said he said if the
[1:57:24] infinite god a god full of love to
[1:57:26] misconstrue his word
[1:57:29] just don't believe
[1:57:30] or they'll say just don't believe all of
[1:57:32] it just believe part of it know all of
[1:57:34] it he said well let all this happen
[1:57:37] because of just misbelieving a little
[1:57:39] bit of it i believe we're going to have
[1:57:41] to take every bit of it back again
[1:57:45] amen
[1:57:46] and we're going to take every bit to get
[1:57:48] back again
[1:57:49] praise the lord
[1:57:51] we must keep it that way that he said it
[1:57:54] and we're going to find out satan had to
[1:57:57] get attention
[1:57:59] amen
[1:58:02] remember we're in a warfare with god
[1:58:05] the men and women
[1:58:08] is his children and so he's in warfare
[1:58:11] with satan
[1:58:12] so satan comes down to use a tactic to
[1:58:15] try to counteract god's warfare
[1:58:18] amen
[1:58:19] listen
[1:58:21] he's trying to find something that he
[1:58:23] can a better weapon than the word
[1:58:26] so there is no better weapon that he
[1:58:28] could find so then the only tactic that
[1:58:31] he could use would be
[1:58:34] reasoning
[1:58:40] you don't reason
[1:58:42] it is written
[1:58:44] without
[1:58:46] reasoning amen thus saith the lord no
[1:58:50] reasoning
[1:58:52] amen
[1:58:53] no no there's still too many so-called
[1:58:55] believers reasoning they reason with the
[1:58:58] devil
[1:58:58] they're reasoning with
[1:59:01] with these feelings and these thoughts
[1:59:03] and this oh well this is just this this

[2:02:30] luther any but he claimed the promise of
[2:02:33] the word
[2:02:34] that jesus justified him
[2:02:37] wesley claimed the promise that jesus
[2:02:38] sanctified him the pentecostals claimed
[2:02:41] the promise of the baptism of the holy
[2:02:42] ghost the gifts of the spirit because it
[2:02:44] jesus promised it and jesus did it amen
[2:02:48] but now are we claiming the promise of
[2:02:50] the resurrection rapture
[2:02:52] god help us

[2:03:13] for the rapture
[2:03:15] faith for the healing of the body going
[2:03:18] on to the faith for the change of the
[2:03:19] body
[2:03:21] grace
[2:03:23] amen
[2:03:28] listen
[2:03:29] 1962 again
[2:03:32] the message putting on the whole armor
[2:03:34] of god
[2:03:35] and he said we find that this great
[2:03:36] enemy of god thought as long as that
[2:03:39] little family in eden keeps behind that
[2:03:41] word
[2:03:42] i can never touch them
[2:03:44] and neither can he today he'll still be
[2:03:47] still blocked off
[2:03:50] but he said if i can use some real good
[2:03:52] a strategy and he said just reason out
[2:03:56] and i give them some human reasoning
[2:03:59] amen because she's human and if i can
[2:04:02] just give him human reasoning then we'll
[2:04:04] win the battle
[2:04:06] satan and his angels and then eve give
[2:04:09] away to it
[2:04:10] and therefore we know our enemy by his
[2:04:12] attacks may maybe you didn't get it just
[2:04:15] to write the way i said it he said when
[2:04:18] anyone any spirit any person tries to
[2:04:21] disagree with god's word remember that's
[2:04:23] your enemy
[2:04:25] and we know his old attack he said
[2:04:28] that's the way he broke the human race
[2:04:30] down and that's the way he breaks them
[2:04:32] down today amen and that's the way he
[2:04:34] gets you away from god to disbelieve his
[2:04:38] word
[2:04:39] and the only way that you can ever stay
[2:04:42] in fellowship with god talk to him in
[2:04:44] the cool of the evening and he said is
[2:04:46] stay fortified in the word
[2:04:54] it's not feelings
[2:04:56] it's faith
[2:04:57] that faith
[2:04:59] again is not feeling it's the word
[2:05:03] thus saith the lord
[2:05:07] this is faith faith comes by hearing
[2:05:10] hearing by the word
[2:05:12] amen
[2:05:14] it is the gift of god
[2:05:16] amen and without faith it is impossible
[2:05:19] to please god
[2:05:23] so are you pleasing god tonight
[2:05:26] whether here or online are you pleasing
[2:05:28] god tonight
[2:05:31] what kind of faith is in control is it
[2:05:34] faith in control or religion
[2:05:38] i pray the grace of god that is faith in
[2:05:40] control
[2:05:42] amen and faith is governed by the word
[2:05:46] amen
[2:05:48] again there's too many
[2:05:50] that it's religion
[2:05:52] but it's not paid
[2:05:54] and not only that
[2:05:55] again the quote there's another quote
[2:05:57] somewhere where the prophet of god said
[2:05:59] you're in the message
[2:06:00] but the message is not in you
[2:06:04] he knew that
[2:06:11] so you're in the message
[2:06:13] is the message in you
[2:06:15] if the message is in you
[2:06:16] the message controls you
[2:06:19] the word of god controls you
[2:06:21] the life you live your attitude your
[2:06:23] spirit your actions reactions is all a
[2:06:25] reflection of the message
[2:06:28] it's just automatic you don't have it's
[2:06:30] not it's not well i got to do this i got
[2:06:32] no no
[2:06:33] because of the baptism the holy ghost
[2:06:34] you and the word is one and you just
[2:06:36] quote and just it's automatic
[2:06:40] god help us
[2:06:46] he said we know our enemy by his attacks
[2:06:51] maybe you didn't just get it
[2:06:53] again he said the way i said it be
[2:06:54] repeated
[2:06:59] he deceived eve
[2:07:01] but he used the word
[2:07:04] but he added to it
[2:07:05] god help us
[2:07:09] and sometimes the devil will use
[2:07:11] intellectual knowledge
[2:07:13] the devil will use intellectual
[2:07:16] reasoning
[2:07:17] he will use the influence of family
[2:07:20] friends and co-workers
[2:07:22] yes
[2:07:24] jobs material possessions what for to
[2:07:27] get us away from god's leadership
[2:07:30] what a compromise on the word
[2:07:32] god help us
[2:07:34] brother
[2:07:36] don't be deceived
[2:07:38] by intellectual knowledge don't be
[2:07:40] deceived by reasoning don't be deceived
[2:07:43] by the influence of family friends
[2:07:45] co-workers
[2:07:46] or jobs
[2:07:48] no no
[2:07:49] stay with the word
[2:07:52] if you're a seed of god sons and
[2:07:54] daughters of god
[2:07:57] the only thing that matters to you is
[2:07:59] the word
[2:08:02] you love the word you love love god you
[2:08:05] love his word
[2:08:07] oh yeah
[2:08:08] it's just automatic
[2:08:10] as i said because of your not natural
[2:08:12] birth
[2:08:13] there was a time when you would go out
[2:08:14] and you just naturally do what your mom
[2:08:17] would do do what your mo paul would do
[2:08:19] your grandma grandpa because you had
[2:08:21] that nature
[2:08:22] in control physically in your body but
[2:08:25] when you're born again
[2:08:27] from the inside out amen the pound the
[2:08:30] anointing is the soul controlling your
[2:08:32] human spirit and controlling your
[2:08:34] thoughts amen
[2:08:37] so it's not you that lives no more is
[2:08:39] christ living in you
[2:08:42] hallelujah
[2:08:45] yes
[2:08:48] a spiritual warfare brings you to christ
[2:08:50] and when you get to christ the spiritual
[2:08:52] warfare will keep you with him amen keep
[2:08:55] you in the word amen staying with the
[2:08:58] word by the grace of god
[2:09:00] the warfare is there to get you to
[2:09:03] doubt the word
[2:09:05] challenge your faith in the word
[2:09:08] oh yeah i believe but i believe but no
[2:09:11] we believe absolutely
[2:09:13] no buts
[2:09:14] get thee behind me satan
[2:09:17] amen
[2:09:21] so brother don't let the enemy use
[2:09:23] intellectual knowledge reasoning
[2:09:25] family influence friends or co-workers
[2:09:28] jobs
[2:09:30] material possessions don't let the enemy
[2:09:32] use any of that to get you to doubt the
[2:09:34] word
[2:09:35] amen
[2:09:39] every christian fights a battle
[2:09:41] every day
[2:09:43] we're in a warfare right now and we are
[2:09:46] going on constantly within us
[2:09:50] he said there is a battle between right
[2:09:52] and wrong
[2:09:53] shall we receive it what shall we do
[2:09:56] shall we bow to the world and shall we
[2:09:59] give up this thought that we got
[2:10:03] satan is challenging our faith
[2:10:06] amen
[2:10:09] bear with me
[2:10:11] just a couple quotes
[2:10:15] 1965 a thinking man's filter
[2:10:19] as i stood there looking at it thinking
[2:10:21] of how deceitful it was the question
[2:10:23] came to me
[2:10:25] and just seemed like something said to
[2:10:26] me but the slogan is all right
[2:10:30] a thinking man's filter is a smoking
[2:10:33] man's taste
[2:10:35] and it came to me that that
[2:10:36] deceitfulness
[2:10:38] in the natural realm
[2:10:39] there in the tobacco is something on the
[2:10:42] order of the churches today
[2:10:45] deceitfulness
[2:10:46] oh yeah
[2:10:48] that advertising
[2:10:49] was deceiving
[2:10:51] and he said we deal with the same thing
[2:10:53] concerning the bible the word of god for
[2:10:55] the for the day
[2:10:58] the enemy is here to deceive us
[2:11:01] he said it's come till the whole world
[2:11:03] has become a great deception of what is
[2:11:06] really true and what is right
[2:11:08] even in politics social affairs schools
[2:11:12] in everything
[2:11:15] we're witnessing and experiencing
[2:11:18] deceitfulness
[2:11:19] amen
[2:11:23] and he said that
[2:11:24] 1965 the message of satan's eden
[2:11:28] and he said that deceitfulness of the
[2:11:30] church of today
[2:11:32] amen
[2:11:34] he said see the son of perdition the
[2:11:37] devil
[2:11:38] and he said then people worshipping
[2:11:40] satan in this day and they think they're
[2:11:43] worshiping god
[2:11:46] it's serious
[2:11:50] you'd have to make your calling election
[2:11:52] sure
[2:11:53] make sure you're worshiping the right
[2:11:55] one
[2:11:59] they're worshiping the devil
[2:12:01] thinking they are worshiping god
[2:12:05] amen
[2:12:07] and maybe responding to the devil's
[2:12:09] ideas and thoughts thinking they're
[2:12:12] responding to god's idea
[2:12:15] thinking they're responding to god's
[2:12:16] leadership
[2:12:19] oh my
[2:12:20] make your calling election sure amen
[2:12:24] make your make sure that you have that
[2:12:27] right spirit that right anointing amen
[2:12:29] make sure it's the truth the whole truth
[2:12:31] and nothing but the truth oh yeah
[2:12:35] remember
[2:12:37] it is 99
[2:12:39] truth
[2:12:41] 1
[2:12:44] a lie
[2:12:47] oh yeah he had one word
[2:12:50] yea
[2:12:52] well what he told eve he just added one
[2:12:54] word
[2:12:56] he said yet god said
[2:12:58] but
[2:13:00] forget the butts
[2:13:03] amen
[2:13:08] yeah
[2:13:09] that is the deception the church is
[2:13:11] experiencing today yeah
[2:13:13] no matter how much the word of god
[2:13:15] promised of this day is preached and
[2:13:17] vindicated they still won't believe it
[2:13:20] and he said oh sure you will not die but
[2:13:23] let me give you the reason why god said
[2:13:25] this
[2:13:26] and he quote he quoted this truth
[2:13:28] and he said it'll open your eyes and
[2:13:31] it'll make you no good and wrong and
[2:13:33] you'll be like god then
[2:13:35] if you can do it
[2:13:37] he said that's just what he wants to do
[2:13:39] and that's just the same thing same
[2:13:42] since the very beginning of eden and has
[2:13:44] been ever since
[2:13:46] he said in adam's time it was a deceit
[2:13:49] in noah's time it was deceit in jesus
[2:13:52] time
[2:13:54] it was the same and now it's the same
[2:13:57] today
[2:13:58] it is religious deceitfulness
[2:14:01] but
[2:14:02] he says stay with the word of god
[2:14:04] the whole truth and nothing but the
[2:14:07] truth
[2:14:08] amen
[2:14:10] remember
[2:14:15] the trail of the serpent
[2:14:18] deception
[2:14:20] and just watch how cunning
[2:14:23] is
[2:14:25] he said well they're just like judas and
[2:14:28] jesus there
[2:14:29] both brothers in their tribe just like
[2:14:31] esau and jacob and like the crow and the
[2:14:34] dove sitting on the same roost and
[2:14:36] everything in is a twin
[2:14:38] is this great warfare that we are in
[2:14:41] amen
[2:14:43] that's how deceiving it is
[2:14:48] he said the enemy uses deception
[2:14:51] like he did to eve
[2:14:53] oh god has said surely surely
[2:14:56] amen see trying to reason it beyond what
[2:15:00] beyond what god said originally
[2:15:03] amen
[2:15:04] and he said yea god has said but see
[2:15:08] that spray over it
[2:15:10] what god has said
[2:15:12] god keeps
[2:15:13] he don't need any help from satan he
[2:15:15] keeps it so don't ever be deceived by
[2:15:19] that
[2:15:20] amen praise the name of the lord oh
[2:15:27] i'll finish with these quotes
[2:15:32] the message is the token
[2:15:35] listen
[2:15:36] you say i believe yes
[2:15:39] i believe the message
[2:15:41] that's all right that's good but you
[2:15:43] must have the token
[2:15:45] he said do you hear brenham tabernacle
[2:15:47] you must have the token displayed
[2:15:50] amen
[2:15:52] without it all you're believing is in
[2:15:54] vain
[2:15:55] and you'll have you'll live a good life
[2:15:58] yeah
[2:15:59] you listen to what the word says you go
[2:16:01] to church
[2:16:02] you try to live right that's fine but
[2:16:04] that's not it
[2:16:05] he said i'm talking about the applied
[2:16:08] token
[2:16:09] and the token agrees with every word
[2:16:12] amen it's got to because it is the word
[2:16:15] it's the life that was in the word he
[2:16:18] said my words are spiritual they are
[2:16:20] life said jesus amen my friends
[2:16:23] i don't want to hurt your feelings but
[2:16:26] he said i am responsible for a message
[2:16:29] and that message has come out of this
[2:16:31] mess
[2:16:33] and if i ask you to come out where am i
[2:16:35] going to take you he said would i take
[2:16:37] you to the brenham tabernacle he said
[2:16:40] it's as much fault as any of the rest of
[2:16:43] them
[2:16:48] there's many a message church better be
[2:16:50] careful
[2:16:53] because
[2:16:55] why
[2:16:56] because just think the enemy the enemy
[2:16:59] recognizes the word there so he's going
[2:17:00] to get in and try to influence it
[2:17:04] yeah and in message churches there's
[2:17:06] many there's there's influence
[2:17:10] even this message church the enemy is
[2:17:12] going to be there to try to get you to
[2:17:13] think this way think that way say this

[2:17:26] the church because we're staying with
[2:17:28] the word
[2:17:29] but be on your guard
[2:17:31] amen by the grace of god
[2:17:34] and just think
[2:17:35] when he said would i take you to brenham
[2:17:37] tabernacle
[2:17:39] he said it's as much fault as any of the
[2:17:41] rest of them
[2:17:44] but there's one place i can take you you
[2:17:47] see where you're safe and protect
[2:17:49] protected from death and that is in
[2:17:52] jesus christ
[2:17:55] amen

[2:17:58] emphasize and put the emphasis on your
[2:18:01] personal relationship with jesus
[2:18:04] so there's not you living it's jesus
[2:18:06] living in you
[2:18:08] amen and he said that's the place i'm
[2:18:11] introducing to you tonight he said where
[2:18:13] god put his name and where he promised
[2:18:15] that he would meet every person that
[2:18:17] come in there he would worship with him
[2:18:19] and feast with him in christ
