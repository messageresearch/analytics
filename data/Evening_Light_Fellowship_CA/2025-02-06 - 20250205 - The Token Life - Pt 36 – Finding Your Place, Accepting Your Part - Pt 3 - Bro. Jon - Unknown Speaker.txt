Lord that it would just bring us closer to you Lord and that we' walk out closer to you than we walked in we pray strengthen your people Lord Lord encourage them tonight I pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to James chapter 1 James chapter 1 amen it's good to be here good to see each one that's made it out tonight want to wish brother Matt coffee a happy birthday I think he's 44 but I'm not sure 44 he's a year behind me amen God bless brother Matt he sure does a lot or in the body of Christ here and we're thankful to have him trusting God has G him a good day and then remember Selena as well she's home tonight she's better but she's not great she's still a little weak she wasn't at work on Monday she went and did a partial day on Tuesday and today was her full full first full day but she's still under the weather so we pray God's grace to her also just to let the church know my family and I will be away February 18th through the 21st so that's a Tuesday through a Friday we're going to go to the West Coast again and do a little family vacation there we hopefully see some of the Saints along the way so there'll be one service where I'm not here so I'll uh make arrangements for for whoever will take that it might be brother Grant or it might be haven't talked to brother Mark about it might be him or we'll see how that goes but we'll make sure there's uh someone to take the service for that amen James chapter 1 and verse 17 very familiar scripture it says every every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning and of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures amen God bless you you can have your seats tonight we're preaching as you imagine on the Holy Ghost and we're going to take a third service on this this thought of finding your place and accepting your part and I feel like we've covered a lot of ground in the last two services and I know it's been very pastoral at times and it'll be pastoral again tonight but I believe this is pastoral preaching where we take the word of God and yes we preach it in the theory and the Theology and these things but we've got to remember the purpose of the word is to come and live in US amen it's supposed to produce itself inside of us and one of the greatest elements that you'll find in having a Christian walk that's satisfying is that you find your place that you find out what God wants you to do and then you stay there and I don't care what part of a body you are tonight if you're not there the body's not going to operate the way it's supposed to if you take one little thing in your body tonight and you make it go wrong you take it away then it's not going to work right and you're going to feel a little weird and you're going to feel a little funny and you may have some pains in these things I remember there was a brother in in Edmonton that told me you know he was doing a certain exercise I said what are you what are you doing that for and he told me and it was that he had a particular set of muscles that weren't active in his body they were there but he couldn't seem to the the term there is fire them he couldn't get the muscles to Fire and so he went to the doctor with these aches and his pains and the doctor said well you've got a problem your muscles aren't firing they're there but you don't know how to work them and so he had to do some rather hilarious exercises that I won't describe in a church environment tonight to get those muscles fired up so that his body could operate properly and then once that happened then all of the aches and the pains went away but he had to do some pretty funny things in order to get it going and it's very much the same way in our body sometimes we don't realize why things aren't quite going the way that they ought to be going in the local body and it's because somebody may not be in their position or if they're there they're not working they're not they're not doing their portion I'm not doing that to put people down tonight I'm saying sometimes we're not exactly firing the way we ought to be firing but then we talked about gifts and we talked about people and we talked about administrations and offices and helps and all these different things and then we talked about creation gifts and that's really what I want to talk to you about tonight because we're preaching on the Holy Spirit and we want to see what happens when he comes into your life because he doesn't just come in and seal you and then that's it that's not the way it works brother Braham says when you get the Holy Spirit that's when the fighting starts that's when the real battle starts and let me tell you this the first thing he has to conquer is this amen he's got to conquer me before he can conquer anything else and so when we talk about the creation gifts the idea is that he's going to come in and start to use those you know we talk about people that are gifted and if you to look around this congregation tonight I'm sure we could see some of these things we we we we we talk about so many gifts and we talk about spiritual gifts and maybe it be a minister or maybe it be a deacon or or something like that but we also when we talk of gifted people we think of social gifts people that can get along with everybody and and they're outgoing and they're charismatic or they're great speakers or they're great teachers and they can explain things we can think of people that have Financial gifts there are people that seem to be able to make money no matter where they go and no matter what they do just seems to have money coming out of their life everywhere that they go you have people that are very smart very intelligent they can understand complex things and break them down so that other people can understand them we have people that have mechanical gifts people that can work with their hands people that can fix things and install things and and manage these sorts of things and then we have people that are influential people that have leadership skills to be able to help people come in together and be in unity to get something done then we've got people that are good-looking we got people that have great physiques or we have people that are very athletic and every single thing I've talked about here is a gift from God we may not think it that way but I'm going to show you by the scriptures how those things are so many times what happens is is that we take something that God that is in our body and because it's natural we think that that's all it is but it's a gift from God as we read in our opening scripture James said every good gift every good gift and every perfect every mature gift is from God and he gives it to us for purpose everything that we have that can make our life better that can give us opportunity that can give us advantage over the person next to us is a gift from God and God has given it to you God has placed it in your life God has made you that way for a purpose if you're a child of God Amen he does these things and like I said last time we looked at brother Matt's three daughters in the front row and we looked at those three girls coming from the same Source the same parents the same genetics and yet they come out so different why is that because God has given them advantages for his purpose he's made them a particular way amen but you take those young women and you compare them to the rest of the young people in this church and guess what not a single one of them is the same we can look at brother Joe's kids or my kids or brother Chad's kids or whoever might be here and we look at them and we see some of them can play instruments and sing some of them can only sing some of them can only play some of them are very athletic some of them are very charismatic some of them are entrepreneurial some are very artistic some are very uh intellectual some make friends really easily some are loners not a single one of them is the same amen but what am I getting at every single one of them has been designed designed now we want to catch that they are designed with purpose by God for a place in the body of Christ just like their parents are each and every one but I want to take us into the scripture for this because we can get so focused on spirituality and and looking at the big thing and the big pictures that we forget that the purpose of God and his word is to come down and use what he has given given us in these lives and in these bodies that we have amen it's supposed to be present in our day-to-day lives the word is supposed to be alive in you and I this this evening amen it's great that we read the word it's great that we pray it's great that we spend time in church but the purpose of the holy spirit is to take what God has written about and what God has said and plop it right into your life so that you can live and breathe that word that's where we're supposed to be this morning it's the living breathing word of God and if my spirituality is so high that I can't interact with other people and I can't interact with someone in the world that I can't get outside of my Christian bubble then guess what I'm of no use to the kingdom of God Jesus said we are a city on a hill that cannot be hid that means people outside the city have to be able to see the city that we have to be a witness we have to be a testimony amen some of us have more of an outside experience some of us have less of a role in those things but we're certainly not meant to sit in our Christian castles and just be spiritual we don't just get the Holy Ghost and say that's it I'm saved I'm just going to sit in my house I've said it before the holy spirit is not given to us so we can sit on the couch and be smugged that we're going into a Rapture and a resurrection if we're a mechanic we need to be a Godly mechanic if we're a business owner brother Joe brother Chad they need to be a business a Godly business owner so that other people can see the difference between a mechanic and a Godly mechanic see the difference between a child of this world and a child of God that's what you're there therefore for amen if you're a mother this evening then they you are there to show people what it's like to be a holy ghost filled mother not just a mother amen and wherever you go whether it's a with The Homeschool Group whether it's getting your groceries so somebody can think you are an angel whatever it is you have an opportunity listen my wife has had opportunities to witness in Costco she's had a witness a witness opportunity on the playground at The Homeschool Group wherever we go we are supposed to be a light we are supposed to be a representation of the Living Word of this day amen that's what he's supposed to do but watch this whether you're a man a woman a wife a father single married this evening it doesn't matter every single one of us is being placed into God's hand for him to use brother Ram says it this way he says nobody can take your place but they says these words no matter how little church who makes things little God doesn't make them little we make them little We rise up things and we lower things we make one thing better than another we make one thing spiritual one thing not listen if you're in God's hands the Supernatural is there the power of God is there to do it he says you say I'm just a housewife and he comes right back around and he says nobody can take your place God in his great economy has so set so the body of Christ excuse me in order till there is no one can take your place see we all have a place some of us are evangelists some of us prophets teachers pastors whatever we are and you say well where am I then he says some Housewives some mechanics some Farmers but whatever it is God has set you in your place see the thing is we have natural gifts and because we think we've had them before we got saved before we got the Holy Ghost because they've been there all of our life or they've been developed in our life we think they are not of God they are of God what they aren't is Godly see the difference see you can have them and they are of God but they aren't Godly until you surrender them for God to use but they are absolutely of God from start to finish they are from God but until they're surrendered they're not going to reflect what he means to reflect there doesn't mean you can't use them for yourself as you've said as we've said before you can use them to make a living you can use them to make friends you can use them to gain influence but in the end God has given his children those gifts in their bodies and in their intellect and their personality and these things whatever it might be for his purpose for the kingdom of God every single one of us but I want you to see tonight and this is really where we're focusing I want you to see that your your natural gifts have the same potential as the spiritual ones in the church now that sounds counterintuitive because everything we relate to the super Supernatural is always spiritual but you'll see as we go through here tonight by the scriptures that we yes we have spiritual gifts we have spiritual offices but we also have practical gifts and practical offices and in the body of Christ none is greater than the other they are all placed by God they're a part of the body they're necessary there's no great ones Among Us except him that's it so it's us that make things little and it's us that make things big but God says you're all one in my eyes you're all the same catch this thought now we're going to take it into the scriptures we're talking about the the supernatural ability inside of a natural gift it says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying see I have called by name we're going to talk about this man bezel he says I have called him by name this is not somebody that just happened to be here I have set him I know who he is but watch how he knows who he is he says I have called by name bezel the son of Yuri the son of her of the tribe of Judah and I have filled him with the spirit of God this is in the wilderness this is when they're they're walking away from Egypt and he says I have filled them with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship now stop here because we we tend to focus on things that are very high and very spiritual and we look at wisdom we look at understanding and knowledge and we'd say praise the Lord there's those are great Supernatural gifts that is something that we can really say that is of god but look at what that finishes with it says now that he has what all manner of workmanship what does that mean that word means craftsmanship in other words bezel is a blue collar worker that's good with his hands and what he can do is he can take Precious things well let's look what it says he says I filled him with the spirit of God now this is not the filling that we have today okay this is not the baptism of the holy spirit this is not the sealing of his soul this is an anointing on him it's like a blanket it's like a covering it's something that can come and go but God says I have wrapped bezel in my own spirit for a particular purpose why has God put his Spirit on bezo why is this man in existence what is his purpose what is the manifestation of the holy spirit in this man great signs and wonders a Healing Ministry a great warrior great victories verse four says to devise cunning Works to work in gold and in silver and in brass it says to Divi to divide Divine devise artistic works with his hands it says and in cutting of stones and to set them and in carving of Timber to work in all manner of worksmanship this guy is the world's greatest Craftsman if he was here today he'd be the guy making the pect Philip watches these great watches a million million and a half dollars with 73 movements that can track the movements of the Sun and all the planets inside of a mechanical watch this guy knows how to take materials precious stones and turn them into beautiful things why cuz the spirit of the Lord is upon them see how we can miss out because we're looking for something up here and God's saying if you'll just let me work with you right here I'll do a wonderful thing in your life he says and behold I have given him a holab the son of a hisat of the tribe of Dan so God has appointed God has arranged God has ordained now a holab to be his helper to be his second in command to be a support bezel is the primary a holab the backup and then he says and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted that word wise-hearted means all that are skilled I have put wisdom where did that skill come from oh my dad was a my dad was a carpenter so I'm a carpenter no he says I have put that wisdom in them I have put the skill in them to do what they do what's their purpose church end of verse 6 says that they may make all that I have commanded Thee the Tabernacle of the congregation and the Ark of the testimony and of The Mercy Seat that is thereup and all the furniture of the Tabernacle and the table and his furniture and the pure Candlestick with all his furniture and the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture and the labor and his foot and the cloths of service and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his Sons to minister in the priest's office and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy Place according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do so God laid out this plan for a tabernacle and guess what they've never built one he's laid out this beautiful plan with all of these beautiful instruments and beautiful pieces made of gold and silver and and with precious stones and all these things fine artwork and Moses sitting there saying God it's a great plan how am I going to do it and God says I've already prepared I've given you gifts in the body to do this work and everything they've learned to this point is not to make money it's to make the Tabernacle it's to make the manifestation of what I have in my mind it's to take what's on paper and bring it into reality amen what makes those gifts suited for God Church the spirit of the Lord is upon them it gives them the attitude it gives them the approach it gives them the willingness it gives them the dedication the commitment and it gives them the skill as well it's a working of the spirit from start to finish you know I've been listening to that message of spoken World The Original Seed all at 6 hours and 17 minutes of it and I just started the second half of it and brother Bram said something that answered a question I've talked about over this Pulpit many times just in the past few weeks I know and I thought it applied to what we're talking about today he says this he says but when you really empty out and say Lord Jesus no more of me but you from this time on he says see then it's going to bring forth a h hundredfold I was saying what's the difference between 30-fold 60-fold and 100-fold church I have my answer this evening ask and you shall receive amen what's the difference the more that I Surrender the more that comes out of him the more that I let go the more that comes out of him the more I lay myself down the more of him that comes out it's surrender surrender surrender the more that we surrender the more fruit that's going to come out of our Lives amen bezo was a great Craftsman but his greatest achievement was when he fulfilled the word of the Lord using his gift listen bezo when he came to the end of his life and they said to him bezel what is it that makes you a great believer how many people have you converted converted how many people have you laid hands on and healed how many miracles have you performed how many sermons have you preached none none none beia what did you do I built the Tabernacle with my gift that was all he had to do his purpose his reason to exist was to build everything that was in that Tabernacle he was the head Craftsman for the entire Tabernacle amen his idea his gift was to take the the the thought of God and turn it into perfect Reality by a natural gift we'd say a bluecollar worker it's so simple church so this is not rocket science you take what you have and you say Lord no more me but you listen we still got to make a living we still got to put a roof over our heads these different things we know these things but I'm trying to get you to see the supernatural potential of the gifts that God has given you see we bring the potential but he's got to bring the Supernatural Part see the potential is there but the potential is not in what I have without his Supernatural ability to make it into something I can do great things with the gifts God has given me but I can do greater things Greater Works if I'll let him use it amen bezel could have lived a Wonderful Life and maybe he did I don't know creating beautiful things beautiful jewelry beautiful uh furniture and these things but God anointed him with his spirit and that was what made the difference and that's what allowed the Tabernacle of God to come into existence and God was pleased with bez's work and he dwelt in that Tabernacle that's how we know God's pleased he comes to dwell in it he lives inside the things that we do he's there present in it but notice it wasn't just bezel yes he has a holy but they he says every other person with skill they're there to help you out that's the reason why the pastor doesn't do everything in this church amen that's why we have deacons that's why we have trustees that's why we have these different people amen many people come in to help and the purpose is to share the load but it's also to express the gifts it's not just making my life easier it's actually making your life better whether you realize it or not to live without purpose is to be miserable you'll be miserable just just going from day one to day two making money paying bills what a miserable life we're here with purpose we've got a reason for being here look at Moses Moses tried doing it all I love Moses Moses is is an amazing character what a tremendous anointing what a tremendous relationship he had with God and yet we see Moses trying to do too much and he's failing and he's failing he was burnt out he was overwhelmed and he didn't know what to do then Jethro came along his father-in-law came along and he said Moses listen you're in the tent of uh of judgment all day and the people are standing in the hot sun all day and you're worn out because they're coming to you day in and day out all day every day asking for your wisdom and your leadership and your direction and meanwhile they're getting burnt out in the sun he says Moses you got to change this and watch what he says here says and Moses father-in-law said unto him the thing that thou doest is is not good church can you imagine saying that to the anointed prophet of God this man is God to the people and his father law comes in and says what you're doing is not good you know what that tells me it tells me not a one of us is above correction for our own good amen every single one of us is not above correction for our own good he says Thou wi surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee he says you're going to burn out and you're going to burn out the Good Will of the people as well for this thing is too heavy for thee thou are not able to perform it thyself alone you say brother John I've got a gift I can handle it listen you might have a gift but sometimes we have what's called scope creep brother Paul knows about this don't you brother Vel probably a little bit brother Mark probably in his past as well brother Joe definitely scope creep is when they say we're going to do this but while we're in there somebody says well why don't we do this and this and then while we're there we might as well do this I see I see sister Leah smiling as well business owners know about scope creep you're contracted to do one thing and you go in and you do 13 things you weren't contracted to do either because they expect it or out the Goodwill of your heart and then you realize I'm losing money on this job I'm losing my time I'm losing my family I'm losing my marriage I'm losing my relationship what is it scope creep B based on duty we think we have to do these things we can add to our own burdens because we're in a position to do it not because we're the only ones that can do it that's something that as Leaders we have to watch out for sure we have to be careful we're not taking on too much because you'd be surprised how much other people can do if you let them use their gifts I'm obviously not an advocate of church splits but one thing I've seen is that out of every Church split you realize there was more people that had gifts than you ever realized in a church because guess what you got a whole Cadre of musicians you got song leaders you didn't know were there you got deacons you didn't know were there people that can teach Sunday school there are gifts there if we're willing to use them that's one thing I've certainly learned through management is I've learned that I don't have to do everything that's why you have good people around you is so they can support the load and everybody's happier because of it Jethro says verse 19 hearken now unto my voice I will give thee counsel and God shall be with thee be thou for the people to God word that thou May bring the courses the the causes unto God so you say Moses you're the only one that has a lipto ear relationship with God Moses you're the only one that can go into the presence of God and come out and tell us exactly what God wants done nobody else can do this Moses only you can do it so he says you do that you be you you do the only thing that you can do and nobody else can then he says and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws and thou shalt show them the way therein they must walk and the work that they must do he says moreover Thou shalt Prov divide out of all the people able men such as are such as fear God men of Truth hating covetousness now watch this now he's saying Moses you've got to go pick people that are able but that know how to stay in their position he's saying they don't want to be you Moses see he says that hateth covetousness Church does your reputation matter your reputation matters because people that want Authority rarely have the character to handle Authority he says you've got to have people that are satisfied with where you put them and don't try and usurp your Authority or undercut you cuz he knows you undercut a prophet of God nothing goes well doesn't go well he's saying they've got to be able to hold their position he says and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of 50s and rulers of tens so there's varying levels of responsibility based on their natural gifts and their reputations he says and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee so the big things it would kind of go through a court process so you'd start at the lower level I'll go into it in a second actually he says if Thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so see I love Jethro he says listen don't just take my word for it you got to lift your relationship go ask God if this is the right thing to do I've got I think a good idea but go get God to confirm it and then he says if God's with you then Thou shalt be able to endure Moses you'll be able to Bear the burden that's on you you're obviously not doing you say brother John I've been called for this position yes but if you cannot bear it then something's wrong cuz God will never put a burden on you that you can't bear and if we're failing then something's wrong somewhere he says then Thou shalt be able to endure and all his people shall also go to their place in peace you'll be happy and they'll be happy he says so Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said and Moses chose Abel man out of all Israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of 50s and rulers of tens and they judged the people at all seasons and the hard causes they brought unto Moses but every small matter they judged themselves so church let me ask you where is God in this where is God in this now we know God is in approval of it because Moses did it Moses checks with God God says absolutely Moses go do that but God is in the gifts God is in the men that are able that have the right attitude and that are able to stay in their Lane and not usur Moses but rather take a burden off of his shoulders these are men that are secure in who they are that don't need to go higher that are satisfied to serve where they are church it's it's when we covet that we get into problems but when we're satisfied with how God made us then he can raise us up and guess what he'll also take us down if we're not ready amen but there is nothing obviously Supernatural in this series right here th this conversation with Jethro there's nothing Supernatural in it and yet this is God working in the body this is God's will now these men are Judges that's what it says there they decide what's right and wrong so they had this escalating system where every the lowest man on the totem pole we would say had 10 they said over 10 people 10 families rulers of 10 families and then from there it goes up to the to the 50 families then hundreds of families then over thousands of families and these men in their natural wisdom and and understanding would hear cases so this is a a it's not a spiritual leadership but it's a practical leadership it's a it's a a governmental leadership of sorts if we could put it that way it's Israel's court system and Moses is essentially the federal Supreme Court but you got to work to get to them and only the really difficult cases that nobody else can figure out would get to Moses level and that meant that people could get quick and efficient decisions that they didn't have to sit out all day because when you've only got 10 families then you should be able to get through that pretty easily I'm sure 10 people 10 families can't be that bad I don't know but it shouldn't be too bad but if it's worse than that then you go to the guy that's got 50 and you escalate it to him and then from there it will move its way up amen but what is it doing it's allowing these gifted men to use their gifts and I'll tell you what church when you allow a gift to be used what happens is it takes away a critical spirit because what happens is when we're not working we have time to criticize but I'll tell you what a busy person doesn't have a whole lot of time to criticize CU they're too busy doing their job amen and it's only when you get in your their Lane that they start to criticize because hey that's my job I'm doing it leave it alone but if we're working we aren't so critical I find that's why we need to spread the load sometimes is to get people working so they understand the burden as well they understand what it's like to be in a leadership position to take responsibility to be in the public eye to realize that we're not perfect and people have to be okay with those things so Moses he he gets this break from this and so now only the biggest things come to him and the biggest things come to him because he's got access directly to God so it's a it's a Judicial thing but then we come to numbers 11 and this legal system is working great and it's reduced Mo Moses burden significantly but there's still problems and Watch What Happens here in numbers 11 it says and the mixed multitude was among them that was among them fell austing and the children of Israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat now watch this situation as it starts the snowball who starts the complaining session the mixed multitude the the the the phrase there the literal original word is the rabble the rabble rousers what is it these are people that are not Jews that are not Believers that attach them themselves to the working of God they're there for the supernatural food they're there for the blessings they're there for the community they're there for God taking care of them but they are not a part of the promise they're not there for the promise they're just there to they're leeches they're leeches okay so they come along and they start lusting for what they used to have what they never had church was slavery these are people that didn't get delivered the way Israel did did they didn't have an appreciation for the work that had gone in this far that what God had done but they started focusing on what they couldn't get and then that trickles over to the real family of God if we could put it that way certainly by bloodline and now the Israelites have the same Spirit as the rabble and they start to get together and now the the Israelites are Weeping and moaning and lamenting and B bemoaning their fate now listen to their words we remember the fish that we did eat in fre Egypt free the Cucumbers do you remember those cucumbers those cucumbers were so good right the melons we haven't had melons in so long I can just taste them I can see the melons and the leaks and the onions and the garlic oh what I would give for something Savory but now is our soul dried away we might giggle a little bit really your soul is dried away because of your food now we've got some Foodies in here brother Vel I'm looking at you a few others yeah I wasn't going to say my wife but she gave herself away but really can you imagine somebody saying my soul is dried away because I eat the same food day in and day out see that's fine by me I do just okay with that but it's like are you are you bleeding are you dying from this is it literally going to kill you but my my soul is dried away right and there is nothing at all besides the Mana before our eyes I can't take this Supernatural food that keeps coming down out of Heaven I can't take any more of this Supernatural food that God's been giving our way how quickly church we forget the goodness of the provision of God amen he says then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his tent discontent spreads far more quickly than praise and worship church I'll tell you that why because our nature leans that way he says and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly and Moses also was displeased and Moses said unto the Lord wherefore hast thou Afflicted thy Serv he saying why' you put this on me and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight that thou layest the burd and of all this people upon me have I conceived all this people have I begotten them that they should have say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking child unto the lamb which thou swearest unto their fathers Moses saying are these my kids did I produce them they never grow up why am I the one that has to take all this burden Lord why are you putting this on me he says when should I have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may ate he says I can't give them what they want God this is your work this is your people and yet I'm carrying all the weight and the burden of this and they keep complaining by the way he says I am not able to Bear all this people alone because it is too heavy for me now Moses starting to feel the pressure listen the best of us can feel the pressure we can get weighed Down Under the burdens that we're carrying day by day I I I am amazed at Moses because Moses stood in the Gap time and time time again for those people he offered his life for theirs God said listen Moses I'll just kill them all and I'll start a new family with you and Moses said Lord don't do it don't do it he stood in the gap for those people but church we can hit the ends of our natural patience of our natural strength of our natural Grace and longsuffering and Moses has hit the end of his Road here there's a h there's a limit to what we can handle on our own absolutely absolutely amen but there's also a limit to what God wants us to handle that's the other side that's the thing we have to understand sometimes we take on a duty that isn't of God it's of ourselves and we lose an opportunity for somebody else to spread their wings and start doing something he says Moses says and if thou deal thus with me kill me I pray thee out of hand if I have found favor in thy sight and let me not see my righteousness this this is what I say nobody likes me everybody hates me might as well eat worms and kill me while you're at it Moses is acting like a child he's saying if I have found favor he says if you're going to keep doing this to me kill me I pray thee if I found favor Lord if you if you would do anything good for me kill me Moses has lost it he's been pushed over the edge sometimes we can get so stuck in our duty that we forget he's got to be in it that he's got to be the one that carries the load Jesus said my yoke is easy and my burden is light if we can't stand it we've forgotten there's another one that's helping us with the load so many times we are never given a burden we cannot bear I can get that way sometimes I'm very Duty driven but it's been good for me in this role pastoral role to just let go and let people do their jobs and it works beautifully it works beautifully and it gives me so much more relaxation and allows me to focus on the things that only I can do and let other men and sisters as a case may be do the things that I can now watch what happens now the Lord said unto Moses verse 16 gather unto me 70 men of the Elders of Israel whom thou knowest to be Elders of the people these are spiritual men now these are not just naturally gifted men these are men of leadership in spiritual roles we have Elders in this church they can be a deacon like brother Joel and brother Matt it can be our older brothers like brother Bob and brother Mark or Brother David or brother Gerald these are men that have a spiritual quality to them not just a natural gift okay he says and officers over them and bring them under the Tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with thee he says and I will come down and talk with thee there and I will take of the spirit which is upon on thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou beare not thyself alone it says and the Lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the 70 elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied and did not cease now we don't know who these men were except for two amen but they may have been taken out of the the original group the judges we don't really know but we see here what God did here because these are gifted men These Are Spiritual men these are leaders in their own right but that wasn't enough to Bear the burden of moses' spiritual leadership God had to do a work in their life and the difference here is that they had to come under a new leadership what was it the spirit of God upon them you can't help a prophet under your own leadership you can't help a pastor under your own leadership you deacons you can't help me if you're under your own leadership a different leadership if I could say it that way same with the trustees same with the treasur same with everyone in this congregation you cannot help unless we're under the same anointing and that anointing brings us into unity and it shares the load and it gives us purpose in the body of Christ remember that gift is something that God can anoint that's what a gift is is something that God can anoint and God poured out his Spirit on these men in a measure of what was in Moses Moses had the greatest anointing of all of them but they got a portion of these things and it was the same prophetic spirit that spoke frogs into existence that spoke uh lice into existence that turned the the water into blood and these different things it was the same anointing the same power the same Authority that Moses had in leading them out and because Moses now has the legal side covered with all those other judges now God says I'm going to let you have the support on the spiritual side but it's going to take my spirit to do it and he fills those men with the spirit it says the spirit rested upon them and they prophesied and did not cease these men were not speaking now out of wisdom they were speaking out of thus saith the Lord they were speaking with the same Authority that Moses did because they were under the same anointing these men were absolutes to the people just like Moses they did not replace him not a one of them had the measure that he had but they could speak now as thus sayeth the Lord just as Moses did they didn't replace him they supported him they took the burden off of the shoulders of the the spiritual head of the house it's no different today in the local body that's what you have you have a pastor that serves as the spiritual lead the holy spirit's the leader it's got to be the leader but under that he has placed men but under that man he has placed other men and they are there to share that burden and that's one of the greatest Revelations I believe a pastor can have is that God gives you people to help you not just to try you you're here to help not to make my life difficult but to make our lives better and easier and more efficient in the kingdom of God it really it really appeals to the engineering side of me why do with one what you can do with 50 everybody works a lot better if we all carry just a little bit rather than one or two carrying the heavy loads we talked about natural things we talk about athleticism and these different things we talked about looks and you know we don't really look at looks as a gift from God what about Esther Esther was a babe Esther was gorgeous was she beautiful just to be beautiful no Esther was one of the most beautiful women in the Kingdom maybe she was the most beautiful but you'll notice with Esther it's not just her looks that got her in but it got her foot in the door they didn't know what kind of person Esther was when she showed up but they saw saw she was beautiful and that got her in the door but when she got in the Door Church what gave her favor that she was a daughter of God and she had the character and the attitude to match her looks that's the thing that made her U such a special person amen we we've talked about before brother Bram says power without character is satanic let me tell you a gift without character is going to cause you problems absolutely amen you ever you ever meet somebody that's good-looking and they know it and they act it nobody wants to be around them but those that are gracious and kind and humble boy that people will do anything for a humble good-look person I'll tell you is it this is driven by data that people that are goodlucky make more money and it's not cuz they're all jerks there's an advantage that comes with those things they receive favor because they're looks or match with their attitudes Esther's looks are what made her eligible to step into the King's house but it was the work of God in her life that gave her grace and favor above and beyond her looks listen as as as sisters in this church and in the body of Christ your looks will never match what this world has in terms of perfection because they can cover every blemish they can prop they can pull they can push they can pluck they can add they can color they can do everything to make themselves perfect but what they will never match is the honest raw beauty of a daughter of God not even close I'll tell you I I've seen you know after 20 years and 25 years working going to school you can see somebody that's beautiful one day and then they run into class and they didn't have time to wash their hair and they didn't have time to put their makeup on and you wonder what truck ran them over because what they need that to be beautiful but your beauty is not skin it's that Meek and humble spirit that you have do you know that's what men are looking for these days they have completely lost it on powerful authoritative driven women because what does it do it brings a clash in the home and they're looking for genuine women real women and you know where they find them the Christian Community because they're not so caught on looks they're beautiful sisters you're beautiful but your beauty goes Way Beyond what we see with our eyes it goes to the character of your hearts and your souls but gester comes in and she finds this favor and remember what happens she comes in and the and the the unic the chief unic he gives her favor he gives her he puts her to the front of the queue he he favors her and her servants and when it comes time to go before the king she doesn't say here's what I like she says what does the king like and she wears and sets herself up the way the king's like and and he falls in love with her and he takes her and he makes her his Queen but what is Esther's purpose what is the reason for Esther's looks is it for powers is it for Authority is is it for fame is it for the ability to get whatever she wants no that's not why God made Esther beautiful God made Esther beautiful for one reason alone just one reason look what look what Mori says to her he he remember what happened is he said listen you got to go to the king and you got to tell him that we're in danger and you got to lay yourself on the line and you got to lay the you got to you got to go and and beg for your people's lives she says no I can't go in he might kill me cuz remember you had to be called into the king's presence otherwise if you went of your own accord he could either extend the scepter of Grace or if he withheld it they killed you right there without Mercy she says I can't go in and he hasn't called for me in a month he says listen if you hold your peace we're going to die and you don't know but that you're going to die down the road as well he says for if thou alt together holdest thy peace at this time then shall there be enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place he says God's going to take care of us one way or the other he says but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed but who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this why is Esther beautiful church for such a time as this she probably got a lot of attention throughout her life beautiful young woman single and then she meets the king and he makes her his Queen and he puts her in power church he offers her twice up to half of his kingdom remember what we said those gifts need to be matured with character she could have taken that half his kingdom and just waltzed into a beautiful life wealth Fame riches every single luxury she could ever want but when it came down to the time where he says what do you want she says I want my life and those of my people she was there for them not just for herself her beauty put her in a place to intercede for others do looks matter no can God use them yep he did for Esther David was a handsome man Saul was a handsome man Saul thought too much of himself see God can use it but we can also suppress it with a an arrogance about the things that he gives us God's looking for Witnesses everywhere you might be an athlete you might be very charismatic listen you need to be a witness wherever God places you you know brother Jason Watkins said something a very long time ago and I'm I'm going to paraphrase he says if you're an athlete be a Christian athlete if you're a CEO be a Christian CEO because God needs Witnesses in the locker room and God needs Witnesses in the boardroom as well I'm not advocating professional athleticism I don't think brother Jason was either but he's saying as far as you go as far as God will take you as far as your life will allow you be a witness and the purpose is not to be athletic the purpose is to be a Christian and we've got to be able to be honest with ourselves is this taking is this success taking me beyond my Christianity because if the locker room is having a more of an effect on you than the Christianity is having on the locker room guess what time to go if they're changing me instead of me changing them if they're affecting me instead of me affecting them then I can't be where I am I've got to be able to say I've got to lay it down I've got to Let It Go do I think you can be a CEO today and be a Christian Daniel was Joseph was Joseph was the head over all of all of the finances and the the princes of Egypt but let me tell you you won't get there without a test of character first God's going to prove you and if he's in it he'll absolutely prove you listen what David said about Joseph he says he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant you want to become a CEO listen to this whose feet they hurt with feeds and he was laid in Iron until the time that his word came see Joseph was living under a promise and he says until the time of the promise came the word of the Lord did one thing it Tried Him it tested him it prepared him it molded him it shaped him it got him to the place where when he came into Power he would use it for salvation rather than for Revenge he says the king then sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free he made him Lord of his house and ruler of all his substance to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his Senators wisdom if you're going to become a CEO let me put it this way you're not going to get there on the path that everyone else does you know why cu the path to a CEO in this modern day world is out of balance most CEOs are on their second or third marriage and are usually divorced because they cannot live a life of balance they have to sacrifice something and so they sacrific their marriage they have affairs they're always going they're never at home they can't raise their children horrible track record of a family but they've got everything on the business side of things so can you be a CEO today and be a Christian sure if God makes you one but let me tell you he'll test you every bit of the way or he'll give you your own company like brother Chad and brother Joe they call themselves presidents I think but God can give you something like that but I'll tell you one thing along the way and I've seen this in my own career as I've moved is God says are you going to prioritize me are you going to prioritize your promotion your money your business and those different things because God wants to have the preeminence and if I'm willing to put something else in preeminence you know what's going to happen I'm going to slide into coldness formality religion because I put something else ahead of God and that's the only thing that's left God's going to prove what matters most to us every single time he's going to do that he'll see where our priorities are listen J Joseph was a nobody when he showed up to Egypt he was a slave an Israelite slave he was a nobody with a gift and God turned him into a somebody and it was through feds of iron and it was through prison time and it was through falling falling falling and God molded that man into a place where he could literally save the world these are great people we've talked about tonight we call them Heroes of the faith people with tremendous relationships with God you think of Moses a man that could literally walk into the presence of God and have a conversation what would you give for that gift tonight that when you have a question you could say God tell me and he would give you his literal answer by his own voice amazing people I want to take us over to Hebrews 11 tonight as we start to close and there Paul would mention he'd talk about Abel and Noah and Abraham and Sarah and Moses and Jacob and Joseph and these are big people with big interactions and big moments with God and big conversations and big expressions of Faith but I want to share something again that brother Jason Watkins had talked about a while ago because thinking of Abraham you think of Abraham and you say I can't be like Abraham Abraham is greater than I am but what did Abraham do Abraham left what he had for the promise of God he left his family he left his opportunity he left his religion he left everything behind based on a SLE a simple conversation with the word you say I can't be like him look at what you've done we have people that literally did that walked away from family walked away from religion walked away from opportunity we have people in here that have turned down jobs turned down promotions turned down careers to be in a certain place to do something in the body of Christ is it any less Faith than Abraham had no you responded to the word it's the same Faith it's the same Faith you are children of the faithful Abraham the faith that he had is the faith that we have do you did you know any more than Abraham did when you left sister Brenda you didn't you took a simple message and you said that's for me and you walked out and yes you have pains and yes you have hurts and yes you have offenses and it's maybe been a rocky road at times but the promise is still there and you're walking Faithfully in the things but listen to what Paul says near the end of this chapter now he says he's talked about all these and he says what shall I more say what more is left to say he says for time would fail me I don't have enough time to tell of Gideon and barck and Samson and Jeep of David also and Samuel and of the prophets look at that list look at Gideon Gideon a great Soldier and a judge of Israel Samson a man of great strength a judge for 20 years the strongest man to ever live on this Earth when the spirit of God was on him David The Greatest Warrior warrior in Israel's history the greatest King in terms of Victories a man after God's Own Heart Giant Slayer Samuel one of the greatest prophets in the scripture a man perfect in his walk we have no actual uh place that shows where Samuel made a mistake not that we believe he was sinless but his walk with God was perfect he never held back what God told him to say he was perfectly a microphone for God a a tremendous Prophet that led Israel so perfectly for so long but you notice I skipped a couple people there who was baric baric was a nobody baric was a nobody that God chose we have no prior information about baric until he's called out and what happens is a woman a propheus Deborah comes to him and says baric God told me to come to you tell you to take 10,000 soldiers and go to such and such a place and I'm going to lead the enemy to you and you can fight them and you'll win he says not on your life I'm not going unless you're going to go he says I don't trust you unless you're going to put your life on the line as well she says good I'll come along I'll be there with you she said but just realize this the battle won't belong to you the battle's going to go to a woman so this is a man who's going to go fight a battle and the women are going to get all the glory baric a nobody he's just a pawn in God's hand he's a one- hit wonder we never hear anything of baric he he he goes in he fights they win the battle CIS flees the woman jail takes him puts a temp peg in his in his ear Temple kills him and then baric sings a song with Deborah and then that's it we hear that's all we ever hear baric he's a nobody but let me tell you who's even less of a no even more of a nobody maybe we put it anybody know much about jeepa jeepa he's a piece of trash jeepa is the son of a prostitute Jeep's dad went playing around where he wasn't supposed to play around got a prostitute pregnant she had a child he took him into his own family but when he had legitimate children by his own wife those Brothers took him and kicked him out he was kicked out of his family home he was kicked out of his City he was kicked out of the Tabernacle he was a bastard he was not allowed to come into the Tabernacle and worship God so they said you can't be here you might be the firstborn but you're illegitimate you have no inheritance with us get out so jeeta leaves and he has nothing to he has he has nothing to live by he has nothing to support himself and so jeeta becomes a warrior because everything he gets he's got to get by the strength of his arm he has to fight to get get everything he does and he goes into a different part of the land and there he sets up and he gets a band of men together and he becomes The Greatest Warrior in the area and he makes a reputation for his fighting skill that's the only thing he knows how to do is fight but then Israel gets in trouble and they they get an army that starts to invade and so sheepishly they say to jeepa uh can you come back now the the one that they hated before the one that they put out the one they had no time for the one that they wouldn't allow to worship with them they said' do you mind coming over and saving us and jeffa says sure if you let me become the leader again give me back the home in Gilead let me come and be the head of the household they said okay we'll let you do it so he comes in and Watch What Happens here it says then jeffa has everything he's a he's a he's a he's a nobody he's scum he's filth not worthy to be seen in the company of it says then the spirit of the Lord Came Upon jeepa and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh and passed over m of Gilead and from mispah of Gilead he passed over under the children of Ammon that's the F the the the army that had come in he says so jeepa passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them and the Lord delivered them into His Hands Church this man had nothing going for him he was an outcast he was the kind of thing you scrape off the bottom of your Che he's a nobody you know what he is though he's a child of God he's a child of God and the spirit of God comes on him and that man that is a warrior now becomes a warrior that can deliver he's not just fighting for himself now yes he's got selfish motives we would say but he's there and he does a victory that he couldn't do before why the spirit of the Lord comes on him God turned the son of a prostitute into a judge of Israel that's what he became after this he became a judge a man that was rejected it seemed of God and man became a judge of Israel Saul the first king of Israel he had a gift of leadership but he didn't think he had it and God said listen I'm going to come on you I'm going to give you a new heart and I'm going to put my spirit on you and that'll make you into a King Saul that's when Saul went to the to the the school of the prophets and he prophesied there and Saul for the first while was a tremendous King you know why he was humble and he was obedient you want to succeed in life as a Believer you want to succeed in life be humble and be obedient to the spirit of God but what happened is Saul started to get caught up in his success see the the the the army of Israel was so humble that only Saul and Jonathan had swords and yet they would win Victory after Victory after Victory against fully armored fully weaponized foes you'd think that would kind of drive into you a little bit this ain't me this is God but Saul got worked up and he he started to think more of himself and he started to worry about holding on to his kingship rather than serving the god that placed him in kingship and by choice Saul started to turn away the word of God and the leadership of God and eventually what happened is God took that spirit away and he put it on David and Saul was left with his original leadership skills and guess what that always leads us into selfishness every single time it might be a gift of God but if he doesn't anoint it it takes us down a path of self uh self- privilege of doing what's best for ourselves and when that happened God couldn't do anything with Saul God wouldn't do anything with Saul remember Saul when he comes to the end of his life and he goes to the witch of Endor he says listen God doesn't talk to me the ephod doesn't talk to me dreams Visions are gone God doesn't speak to me anymore you know why he chose to ignore what God had told him but as long as that Spirit was on him and he obeyed it he was okay every single one of these people that we've talked about had an anointing on them they had a gift that God could anoint but it was always a temporary thing we look in the scriptures and we see how they fell we see how Moses fell we see how David Fell we saw the faults of these different ones even Joseph had his moments they misst they abused that gift or that anointing that was there and yet God would use them wonderfully and supernaturally time and time again what can you do today you have the Holy Spirit dwelling inside of you you don't just have an anointing that's wrapped around you you have the personal presence of God inside your soul tonight you have an opportunity for your gifts to be used in a way that that that would surpass anything that's written in scripture because you have an indwelling Spirit not just a cloak of an anointing if he could do that with them what can he do with us tonight amen let's stand if we would you know when I'm talk thinking of gifts and these things for whatever reason my mind always goes to the sisters because I think too often sisters you forget how great a role you play and how great a gift you have as a mother remember brother Bram said even if you're just a housewife he says nobody can replace you do you know you might be a good mother you want to be a great mother let the Holy Spirit step into your motherhood put the books down put your prayer time in start saying to God God I want to step out of what I can do and start start to see what you can do you might be a great mother you want to be the greatest mother let go and let God have his way you might not be a good mother you know motherhood doesn't come naturally to every woman absolutely not there are elements there where most most women will have areas where they do pretty good and they'll have areas where they're not so good and you can look at yourself and say why am I not a good mother this way why can't I do this why isn't this ful in why isn't this natural you know why cuz you're meant to let the Holy Spirit do a work in you other women that don't know the Lord all they're left with is help books and talking to friends and maybe you can try this and maybe you can try that but you know what I found in the scriptures is that mothers that prayed always seemed to somehow make it through that God could give them the right words to say he could put the right desire on their hearts he could give them wisdom that they didn't have before not just for mothers for fathers as well I'll speak to you tonight what happens when we lay ourselves Before the Throne of God and say God I need more than what I've naturally got that's the opportunity for God to step in and anoint a gift in your life that you may not have even realized you had he'll give you the right words he'll give you the right attitude he'll give you the right response he'll give you the right silence he'll give you the patience he'll give you the love he'll give you the rest he'll give you Clarity in a time where it seems like you don't know what to do there are situations I'm praying about and I say Lord I don't have a clue how to work through this one you're going to run into that as a spouse as a mother as a father certainly our brothers in their roles in the church you're going to run into situations you've never been before and you say how do I do it by the spirit according to the word of God Amen what is it it's God now stepping out of that Soul not stepping out but diffusing from that from that Command Center inside and he's starting now not to take control but we yield control and he starts to step in and now you're a supernatural mother you're a supernatural father you're a supernatural Deacon you're you're a supernatural young woman you're a supernatural young brother you're a supernatural student you're a supernatural mechanic whatever it might be it's God stepping now out of the soul and into the spirit and the flesh revealing himself one more time before he takes us away we're going to look at what's possible when God steps in we're going to talk about the third poll where deity speaks again and the word is fulfilled in this final age that's what he's here to do the holy spirit is here to make the word be fulfilled in our lives in the Simplicity of motherhood fatherhood a spouse a minister a church office musicians whatever it might be that's what he's here to do is to show you what's possible when you take what he's given you and you give it back to him and say Lord have your way amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord we're getting down to where we live that's for sure Lord and you see this wonderful group of people that stands here this evening Lord you had a a template for each one and after you created them Lord you burn that template because there's not another one like them Lord and you built into them gifts you built into them a nature you built into them strengths you built into them a advantages Lord and it's meant to be for your glory Lord we're asking that we would learn a little more to surrender them to you Lord for what we need in this day is a body that is surrendered to the Head Lord that you would have the absolute preeminence in our life Lord that we would have a day-by-day relationship with you Lord where we can go into your presence and we can can come out with a supernatural response Lord I believe we've been given a supernatural word a rapturing word Lord but that Rapture is a promise a process of turning us into the image that you had Lord I pray you mature our gifts I pray you mature our Natures that you mature the blessings that you've given us in these natural bodies Lord I believe there are spiritual gifts here unexpressed but I believe there are natural gifts that that are not perfectly expressed as well Lord in my own life and in those around Lord I pray you help us to seek you to surrender to you Lord and to find your leading on our day Lord bless these people bless them for their service Lord bless them for their commitment for their patience Lord and give us Grace one for another Lord that we could be in unity under your spirit in your word in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen let's sing that song have your way I don't know the number just came to me as I was speaking there have your way have your way ohly Spirit fill our hearts and have your

that um the deacons have advised me that uh the front door was left open when there was nobody here was left unlocked um I think it happened one time before a long time ago um but it's critical that the last person out makes sure that all the doors are locked usually it's one of the trustees one of the deacons that leaves last after service but if you're here during the week or something like that please be sure to lock that door I've come by and seen the children from the school pulling out the door handles so if the door hadn't to be unlocked when somebody came along and you had kids from the school in here so it's really important uh so we we'd appreciate that the other announcement that I had is Matt's birthday today just thought I'd passed that on under threat of a lot of pain so uh I just thought I'd mention that sorry man praise the Lord but I will say this I've been bad at this but H if you uh want your birthday announc because I don't know everybody's birthday so uh I
