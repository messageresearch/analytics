[44:16] this song is low
[44:17] so i'm gonna have to keep this thing
[44:18] close
[44:19] um when i heard this song uh this
[44:22] scripture came to me it's a song that's
[44:24] um it's a it's a scripture rather that's
[44:26] uh
[44:28] it's in second peter one and it's kind
[44:31] of in between all the
[44:33] the traits of the statue of a perfect
[44:34] man
[44:35] and then just below it is to make your
[44:38] calling and election sure
[44:40] and the scripture is second peter 1 9
[44:42] and it says but he that lacks these
[44:44] things is blind
[44:46] and has forgotten that he was purged
[44:48] from his old sins the song has called me
[44:51] we never forget
[44:56] i just got to say when i read the
[44:57] scripture every time i read the
[44:59] scripture
[45:00] you know like in psalms where it says is
[45:02] it sila or how are you saying
[45:05] you know it always stops me

[45:11] time
[45:12] anyways call me we never forget
[45:15] [Music]
[45:19] the story's so
[45:23] familiar
[45:26] we've heard it all
[45:29] before
[45:33] some days it seems like
[45:36] nothing's sacred
[45:39] anymore
[45:41] [Music]
[45:44] despite the best intentions
[45:48] [Music]
[45:51] somewhere along
[45:53] the road
[45:56] we sometimes take for granted
[46:00] this truth that we know
[46:06] may we never forget
[46:10] the cross and the blood
[46:13] the price that was paid so that we might
[46:17] live
[46:18] may we never forget
[46:22] the cost of this love

[47:28] [Music]
[47:30] may we never forget
[47:33] the grace of our god
[47:36] [Music]
[47:48] if we ever forget
[47:51] the cross and the blood
[47:54] the price that was paid so that we
[47:58] might live

[48:03] the cost of this love he'll never
[48:07] forsake us he'll always forgive may we
[48:12] never
[48:13] forget
[48:17] and so help us lord right here

[51:41] our brother adam meister and his wife
[51:43] sister sandy
[51:45] amen
[51:46] and also our brother dale uh
[51:50] watchlighter
[51:53] so we say it right
[51:55] it's not it's not a normal newfinay
[51:59] not by any means but we pray the lord
[52:01] bless him amen and bless our brothers
[52:04] and sister emma meister amen for their
[52:06] during their ministry here so and also
[52:08] to thank everybody for coming and ask
[52:11] you to remember of course sister betty
[52:12] in prayer that she wasn't feeling well
[52:15] she wasn't able to come tonight
[52:17] and also to
[52:19] give greetings to the saints from
[52:21] brother ed cater
[52:23] he called
[52:25] maybe
[52:26] just before suppertime
[52:28] from grand falls
[52:30] and greetings to brother ed and we just
[52:32] keep our brother in prayer amen because
[52:35] of course there's uh
[52:37] issues out there when it comes to
[52:38] trying to get believers together and uh
[52:42] to maintain
[52:43] ministries and right now of course
[52:46] i don't think there's any pastor there
[52:48] right now uh not sure
[52:50] but uh
[52:51] and then there's only one church and
[52:53] there are very few in the church right

[55:45] that there would come a messenger with a
[55:46] message amen praise the lord they didn't
[55:49] recognize the messenger they didn't
[55:51] recognize the message amen but god has
[55:54] got a bride
[55:55] to hear the message to hear the
[55:57] messenger amen and it's predestinated
[56:00] it's ordained to give us resurrection
[56:03] and rapturing faith
[56:05] hallelujah what jesus did mrs jesus is
[56:08] going to do
[56:09] amen he laid down his life picked it up

[1:00:44] just want to say it's good to be here
[1:00:46] and uh
[1:00:48] it's uh
[1:00:50] been many years i think it's uh
[1:00:52] 1986 so by my calculations about 30 30
[1:00:56] 35 almost 36 years and i want to greet
[1:00:59] brother gerald
[1:01:00] and i'm sorry your wife isn't here but
[1:01:03] brother harold hildebrand is our senior
[1:01:06] pastor at our church and he wanted to
[1:01:08] greet you brother gerald
[1:01:10] and he also want to greet the church and
[1:01:12] the assembly so
[1:01:14] we want to
[1:01:16] thank god for him he's 80 he'll be 80
[1:01:18] next about a week and a half from now
[1:01:21] and we're having a celebration for him
[1:01:23] next weekend and
[1:01:24] he's been in decline he's had
[1:01:26] parkinson's for 12 years and he's been
[1:01:29] limited by that along with his age so he
[1:01:31] hasn't ministered for a number of years
[1:01:33] but
[1:01:34] we're thankful for the grace that he's
[1:01:35] given to to pass on i i was one of those
[1:01:39] that was with him in his original house
[1:01:40] meetings and i i joke i was a 12 year
[1:01:43] old kid i wasn't saved and i looked for
[1:01:44] the corner of the room in the living
[1:01:46] room that i could lean my head against
[1:01:48] the wall during the service
[1:01:49] so i said i wasn't a lot of inspiration
[1:01:51] to him back then but
[1:01:53] thank god that god got a hold of me and
[1:01:55] and uh and when we do that so we we do
[1:01:58] thank god for you brother gerald for men
[1:02:01] like brother harold for those pioneers
[1:02:03] that have labored
[1:02:04] and brought us to where we are we didn't
[1:02:06] get where we were on our own but it took
[1:02:09] rugged men and so we're thankful for
[1:02:11] that
[1:02:12] i'm also thankful for my my good friend
[1:02:14] brother jonathan curlette
[1:02:16] and his family
[1:02:18] they've been a blessing to me and
[1:02:21] i only wish i could have been
[1:02:24] at my age where jonathan is right now
[1:02:27] because i'd be a lot further ahead right
[1:02:28] now but uh
[1:02:30] he's he's um
[1:02:32] he's very knowledgeable he's sharp he's
[1:02:34] quick and
[1:02:35] he's also gone through a few knocks and
[1:02:37] it's developed some maturity but we
[1:02:39] appreciate his family it's been
[1:02:42] uh the only place i'm not envious of is
[1:02:44] is
[1:02:45] uh the four kids that he's got so um
[1:02:49] we've been through that stage but
[1:02:52] we woke up and and there's a little
[1:02:53] pitter-patter of feet running back and
[1:02:55] forth and
[1:02:56] and no it wasn't uh sister selena it was
[1:03:00] the boys so just to clarify that
[1:03:04] anyway
[1:03:05] yesterday we we met up with brother bob
[1:03:07] and sister brenda it was nice to be
[1:03:09] together and uh
[1:03:11] and many people know brother berry
[1:03:13] coffee but i always turned that on
[1:03:15] brother berry coffee and i said brother
[1:03:17] barry aren't you the brother of bob and
[1:03:20] mark
[1:03:20] [Laughter]
[1:03:22] they all they'll go the other way so
[1:03:25] anyway it was uh it was good to be with
[1:03:28] them and then to see brother mark and
[1:03:30] sister maureen i mean i don't know if
[1:03:32] you remember i had a tough time
[1:03:33] remembering you you both had darker hair
[1:03:35] back then and
[1:03:37] i was a little a little lighter back
[1:03:39] then a little skinnier too but
[1:03:41] you know i like to think all these
[1:03:43] people are changing and i just stay the
[1:03:44] same right in my eyes
[1:03:46] it's that way but
[1:03:48] i had come here some 35 years ago on a
[1:03:51] red-eye flight it was a tuesday and i
[1:03:54] arrived here early in the morning took a
[1:03:56] cab with three other locals and i
[1:03:58] realized
[1:03:59] this is not a part of canada i've ever
[1:04:01] heard like this before as they started
[1:04:03] talking and
[1:04:05] and um i walked around town for the day
[1:04:07] and then in the evening when my brother
[1:04:09] mark got off work we went over there and
[1:04:11] we went directly to church that night so
[1:04:14] i
[1:04:15] had a tough time staying with it after
[1:04:18] all of that but uh any rate it was it
[1:04:21] was a blessing and and we had some
[1:04:22] wonderful time and
[1:04:24] and
[1:04:25] one of the greatest things i took with
[1:04:27] me from that trip was um
[1:04:29] a little cassette tape that
[1:04:31] sister maureen had made i think brother
[1:04:32] mark you were playing the guitar and
[1:04:34] sister marine was just playing
[1:04:36] and i think i wore that thing out
[1:04:38] that was a blessing that that soothed my
[1:04:40] soul
[1:04:41] many a time and and just listening to
[1:04:43] you play again that was just a blessing
[1:04:45] and so it's good to see you again and as
[1:04:48] i said i maybe you've changed a little
[1:04:50] maybe i've changed a little bit too and
[1:04:53] and uh put on a few extra pounds i the
[1:04:56] beginning of the year i had a
[1:04:58] you know i had lost some weight and then
[1:05:00] i gained a little bit back and so i
[1:05:02] determined i'm gonna lose 20 pounds this
[1:05:04] year
[1:05:06] and somebody asked me other day how are
[1:05:07] you doing with that i said really good
[1:05:09] i've only got 25 more to go
[1:05:13] so
[1:05:15] any rate that's that's just the way it
[1:05:17] is it's
[1:05:18] part of the blame for that goes to my
[1:05:20] wife she's
[1:05:21] i i can't say she's the best cook east
[1:05:24] of the rockies because newfoundland is
[1:05:25] here so i'd put it overshadow some of
[1:05:28] you but she sure surely is on the
[1:05:29] prairies and
[1:05:31] she's been a blessing to me and
[1:05:33] we have three children i have a daughter
[1:05:35] anna she's 26 and two boys at home caleb
[1:05:38] and ethan 23 and 19.
[1:05:40] so pray for us those two boys at home
[1:05:42] have really
[1:05:43] been very judged but
[1:05:46] they love the lord and they're serving
[1:05:47] god and we're thankful so many greetings
[1:05:49] to all of you i mentioned brother harold
[1:05:51] but also brother alan dole and sister
[1:05:52] shelly they wanted to greet you all and
[1:05:56] we also have a young man who was in our
[1:05:58] church from kenya he had made a stop
[1:06:00] over here brother bernard
[1:06:02] and he wanted to make sure
[1:06:04] greet them all and and he he you must
[1:06:07] have had a memorable impression he said
[1:06:09] brother ed remember one thing
[1:06:11] winter doesn't start or winter doesn't
[1:06:13] stop till the end of may in newfoundland
[1:06:17] i said okay we'll we'll do that but he
[1:06:20] said that and then also brother jim
[1:06:22] dooley i was just talking to him the
[1:06:24] other day and i told him hey i'm going
[1:06:25] to newfoundland so he said oh make sure
[1:06:27] you greet the people and
[1:06:29] if you know that but when i was a young
[1:06:30] man as the age of 20 at just 23 and i
[1:06:34] was in 1983 84 when god was dealing with
[1:06:37] me but brother jim dooley was the one
[1:06:39] that baptized me
[1:06:40] so
[1:06:41] there's a lot of connections to
[1:06:42] newfoundland so
[1:06:44] any rate and then i don't know where's
[1:06:46] where's brother joe is he here somewhere
[1:06:48] am i
[1:06:49] there he is oh my brother joe
[1:06:52] uh we we co-emceed a wedding together
[1:06:55] and we actually i can't say we co-emceed
[1:06:58] i
[1:06:58] i laid the platform for him is what i
[1:07:01] did so and then he's he's a hard act to
[1:07:04] follow and and and
[1:07:05] so i'm glad he came after me because it
[1:07:08] just is that but
[1:07:10] good to see you again brother joe and
[1:07:13] many many years so we've had we've had
[1:07:15] all of this but we also have our good
[1:07:17] friend brother dale i have a greatest
[1:07:19] respect for brother dale as a single
[1:07:22] father he raised
[1:07:23] two wonderful girls i think he's going
[1:07:25] to have a great testimony in heaven and
[1:07:27] his girls one is a
[1:07:29] wife of a deacon one's the wife of a
[1:07:32] one of our song leaders and
[1:07:34] but uh he's a blessing too about to us
[1:07:37] and

[1:11:16] hearer
[1:11:18] lord may it bring forth life in us may
[1:11:20] we begin to see more clearly who we are
[1:11:24] may we see our place in this world lord
[1:11:27] father we pray from the youngest to the
[1:11:29] oldest that you would minister to us
[1:11:32] father we commit ourselves to you now
[1:11:34] and we invite you
[1:11:36] ask your blessing in jesus name amen
[1:11:39] amen
[1:11:40] amen
[1:11:42] if you can turn to your bibles thank you
[1:11:44] to the musicians i sure enjoyed the
[1:11:46] singing back in the office there
[1:11:48] and uh that was a blessing and and so we
[1:11:51] we thank god for that colossians chapter
[1:11:55] 1
[1:11:58] colossians chapter 1
[1:12:01] we we often use the phrase we should all
[1:12:04] be familiar with this scripture in the
[1:12:05] bible this every scripture we'd be
[1:12:08] familiar with so the other day i opened
[1:12:09] to the book of philemon i said we should
[1:12:11] all be familiar with this and people
[1:12:13] kind of looked at me and said yeah well
[1:12:15] it's part of the bible too but there's
[1:12:17] certain scriptures we refer to more this
[1:12:19] is one of them
[1:12:20] colossians 1 verse 15
[1:12:24] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:12:27] the firstborn of every creature
[1:12:29] for by him were all things created
[1:12:33] that are in heaven
[1:12:34] that are in earth
[1:12:36] visible
[1:12:38] and invisible
[1:12:40] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[1:12:42] principalities or powers
[1:12:45] all things were created by him
[1:12:48] and for him
[1:12:50] and he is before all things
[1:12:53] and by him
[1:12:54] all things consist
[1:12:57] and he is the head of the body and the
[1:13:00] church who is the beginning
[1:13:03] the firstborn from the dead
[1:13:05] that in all things he might have
[1:13:08] the preeminence
[1:13:10] for it please the father that in him
[1:13:13] should all
[1:13:14] fullness
[1:13:15] dwell
[1:13:16] and i'll just invite you to go back to
[1:13:18] first corinthians
[1:13:20] first corinthians chapter 15.
[1:13:30] and i'll just take two verses there
[1:13:34] verse 27
[1:13:37] for he hath put all things
[1:13:39] under his feet
[1:13:41] and when he has said all things are put
[1:13:43] under him
[1:13:44] it is manifest that he is accepted
[1:13:47] which did put all things under him
[1:13:50] and when all things shall be subdued
[1:13:53] unto him
[1:13:54] then shall the son himself be subject
[1:13:58] unto him that put all things under him
[1:14:01] that god may be all
[1:14:04] in all
[1:14:06] god bless his word you may have your
[1:14:07] seats
[1:14:12] i'm going to um
[1:14:16] i have to be myself wherever i go i i
[1:14:19] don't i'm at home and i sometimes have
[1:14:21] been comfortable preaching at home
[1:14:23] lately what you don't pick up in one
[1:14:25] service you go to the next when you come
[1:14:27] somewhere then there's all of these
[1:14:29] thoughts that come to you and you try to
[1:14:31] condense them and i don't think i always
[1:14:32] do a good job but
[1:14:34] you know i'm not i'm not going to be the
[1:14:35] fiery evangelist i'm not going to be the
[1:14:37] stoic teacher i'm not going to try to be
[1:14:40] a missionary even though i told people i
[1:14:42] was going overseas i i'm not going to do
[1:14:44] that and so
[1:14:46] i i and i'm not going to try and be the
[1:14:49] pastor you've got pastor here and and
[1:14:51] brothers that do that so i'm just going
[1:14:53] to try to add
[1:14:54] to it and and uh we had a brother at
[1:14:56] home and they they referred to him as
[1:14:58] the helicopter preacher like he just got
[1:15:00] in open the scripture and just started
[1:15:02] blasting and
[1:15:03] and then they they referred to me as the
[1:15:05] 747 preacher because they said i needed
[1:15:07] a bit of a runway to to get going so
[1:15:10] i'll i'll get to where i want to get to
[1:15:12] slowly but
[1:15:13] we will do it i as a subject or a theme
[1:15:16] maybe this this weekend i want to speak
[1:15:19] on the all in all
[1:15:21] but for tonight i'd like to just take a
[1:15:23] subject of
[1:15:25] a seed passing through time
[1:15:27] and
[1:15:28] i'm going to just address a little bit
[1:15:30] on our natural man and then our spirit
[1:15:33] man and
[1:15:34] and that that refers to it but and a lot
[1:15:36] of this is on our outlook or our vision
[1:15:39] on what we see
[1:15:41] and how
[1:15:42] the the book that we believe is opened
[1:15:44] it's
[1:15:45] not necessarily a book somewhere in a
[1:15:47] certain place that's open but
[1:15:49] it's open to our eyes and we are walking
[1:15:52] in the unfolding of it and we're seeing
[1:15:56] more clearly than we've ever seen before
[1:15:59] so we are living in a tremendous hour
[1:16:01] and those of us who have been in the
[1:16:03] path for a long time we're we're seeing
[1:16:06] the unfolding of the events and it seems
[1:16:09] that there's a quickening and they're
[1:16:11] happening
[1:16:12] faster and faster and it seems that that
[1:16:16] as as they're happening and i'll refer
[1:16:18] to worldwide events around us but as
[1:16:20] they're happening it just seems like the
[1:16:23] dominoes are beginning to fall and what
[1:16:26] looked like
[1:16:27] quotations that we looked like and they
[1:16:29] looked like they were a long ways off
[1:16:31] all of a sudden they're at our doorstep
[1:16:34] they're they're here they're not not way
[1:16:36] way off so we're seeing things that that
[1:16:39] maybe we heard with our natural ears
[1:16:42] things which we believe yeah and but yet
[1:16:44] we couldn't understand how but we just
[1:16:46] stayed with them but now we're seeing
[1:16:48] them
[1:16:49] clearly and unfolding and more manifest
[1:16:51] in a greater manifestation
[1:16:53] and and i i use it this way and i i just
[1:16:56] shared this actually a church at home
[1:16:58] last week but in 19
[1:17:00] uh i the lord did called me in 1983 and
[1:17:02] i think it was in 1989 i i took a trip
[1:17:05] to europe and i was still a single man
[1:17:07] at that time and and i as i traveled to
[1:17:10] europe and it was prior to
[1:17:12] the the uh
[1:17:14] fall of east germany and so as as i was
[1:17:17] there
[1:17:18] and and i was there in may of 1989 i i
[1:17:21] traveled and i actually went from west
[1:17:22] germany to east germany and as i'm i'm
[1:17:25] crossing i remember all of these visions
[1:17:28] that we had okay that's the iron curtain
[1:17:30] and and germany was part of that iron
[1:17:32] curtain and you're you're cultured into
[1:17:34] believing it so you know i remember i
[1:17:36] had to get my visa right i'm gonna go
[1:17:38] see people over there and i made sure my
[1:17:40] visa was right it wasn't easy to get a
[1:17:41] visa at that time and i remember in the
[1:17:43] middle of the train and and and russian
[1:17:46] soldiers just woke us up in the middle
[1:17:48] of the night i'm in the train and they
[1:17:50] demanded to see it they're not kind and
[1:17:52] you know so they intimidate you and
[1:17:53] there's all this thing and i'm crossing
[1:17:55] this line and that's a part that i could
[1:17:58] see and feel i'd been inbred into me to
[1:18:00] see it and as i crossed the line i went
[1:18:03] across this place they called checkpoint
[1:18:05] charlie and i went across to see
[1:18:06] believers and and it was
[1:18:09] you know what what i saw in may but by
[1:18:11] november of that year there began to be
[1:18:13] the fall of the eastern bloc hungary
[1:18:16] allowed russian
[1:18:17] immigrants into it they kind of went to
[1:18:19] europe and and in november i woke up one
[1:18:22] morning to hear that the berlin wall was
[1:18:24] coming down
[1:18:25] and that was amazing to me because i
[1:18:26] just remember how it was
[1:18:28] but there was this little thing in the
[1:18:31] message of the hour that we have and and
[1:18:34] and and i'll refer to it and it's in the
[1:18:36] message the end times see sign seed or
[1:18:38] end time seed sign and it's right after
[1:18:41] brother branham speaks spoken word
[1:18:43] is the original seed and he goes right
[1:18:45] into this and he said there's been a
[1:18:47] national teaching reign and then there's
[1:18:49] been a communism sold amongst the people
[1:18:51] there's been a roman revival and he
[1:18:53] drops these words and he said do you
[1:18:55] know if they ever give back the eastern
[1:18:58] part of berlin
[1:19:00] that means that puts
[1:19:02] the roman empire exactly like it was on
[1:19:05] the old
[1:19:06] circle of jesus so the world was
[1:19:09] conditioned to thinking this is a good
[1:19:11] thing communism is breaking down but a
[1:19:14] prophet with eyesight can see and he
[1:19:16] says no this is actually opening the
[1:19:19] doors for romanism to take a greater
[1:19:22] foothold and all of a sudden that became
[1:19:25] like like if you had been feeding on the
[1:19:27] message that became like something that
[1:19:30] you know be just began to alarm you and
[1:19:33] it began to open you but your
[1:19:35] conditioned by what you feed on and as
[1:19:37] you're feeding down the message and
[1:19:39] different things happen you know we can
[1:19:41] we can hear events in israel and and we
[1:19:44] can see current events in russia and we
[1:19:46] can hear about an earthquake in in in
[1:19:49] los angeles and different things and
[1:19:51] immediately gets our attention
[1:19:54] because we're conditioned to look and
[1:19:57] see for different things than the
[1:19:59] world's looking at and when we see the
[1:20:02] the the control of governments and and
[1:20:05] we begin to see because we really
[1:20:07] believe
[1:20:08] you know and i'm
[1:20:09] i'm i'm just gonna allow the lord to
[1:20:11] just just take it the way he wants but
[1:20:13] you know as we begin to see because we
[1:20:16] know we're living in the manifestation
[1:20:17] of the pale horse rider and it's the
[1:20:21] coming together of three powers it's the
[1:20:23] coming together of demon powers it's the
[1:20:26] coming together of political powers it
[1:20:29] it's the coming together
[1:20:30] of religious powers and we see even
[1:20:34] political powers in the last two years
[1:20:37] how every nation whether they were of an
[1:20:39] eastern bloc and whether they were
[1:20:41] aligned with china or russia all were
[1:20:43] put into the same boat
[1:20:45] because of covet and and it and it and
[1:20:47] it forced the whole world into a unified
[1:20:50] state
[1:20:51] and then we see it and then again it
[1:20:53] goes further and now you see all of
[1:20:55] these things happening and it's it's not
[1:20:58] the pale horse ride yet but it's the
[1:21:00] coming together of all these powers and
[1:21:04] here we are in the middle of things
[1:21:06] watching them unfold
[1:21:08] so it's it's a tremendous hour to be
[1:21:10] living in and i'm i'm not going to dwell
[1:21:12] on on the whole world view of things
[1:21:14] because we can easily get caught up in
[1:21:17] that but there's another part that's
[1:21:19] unfolding and it's happening amongst us
[1:21:22] because while that's happening
[1:21:25] god's got his eye on a people god's got
[1:21:28] his eye on a people the wheel in the
[1:21:30] middle of the wheel that which ezekiel
[1:21:33] saw you know here's the big wheel that's
[1:21:35] turning but in the middle of it there's
[1:21:37] a little hub a little wheel in the
[1:21:39] middle that's where god's eye is
[1:21:42] and just like it was in the time of
[1:21:44] jesus and as this quotation i read where
[1:21:47] it was at the time of jesus the roman
[1:21:49] empire just like it was in that time
[1:21:52] here had to be a king named herod here
[1:21:54] had to be a ruler named pilate here had
[1:21:57] to come a taxation that forced the whole
[1:21:59] world and yet it was right in the plan
[1:22:02] of god it was working right into the way
[1:22:04] that god had said so here is god's god
[1:22:08] sees all those things and i don't think
[1:22:10] joseph and mary were very happy that
[1:22:13] they had to go all the way to jerusalem
[1:22:16] right at the time when she was expecting
[1:22:18] but it would had to be the fulfillment
[1:22:20] of scripture and that's exactly where we
[1:22:23] are and we're living in a time of the
[1:22:25] fulfillment of scripture and we all of
[1:22:27] these things have to be
[1:22:30] so so we we see these things unfolding
[1:22:32] this way now
[1:22:33] i'm going to just just read
[1:22:36] i want you just to go with me
[1:22:38] to this for a moment second
[1:22:41] second corinthians chapter six
[1:22:43] and uh the this is really a paradigm or
[1:22:48] a paradox of
[1:22:50] of uh
[1:22:51] where the believer
[1:22:53] is at and i i want to read this because
[1:22:56] sometimes we can make these statements
[1:22:58] way out there and say well how does that
[1:22:59] affect me when i go to work tomorrow how
[1:23:02] does that affect me when i got to go to
[1:23:03] school and raise children and do things
[1:23:05] so i don't want to make it just the way
[1:23:07] out there but everything's working
[1:23:08] together so let's just read second
[1:23:10] corinthians chapter 6 verse 4.
[1:23:13] now paul is really talking about the
[1:23:16] ministry but i think this is applicable
[1:23:17] to all of us he says in verse 4 but in
[1:23:19] all things approving ourselves as
[1:23:21] ministers of god
[1:23:23] and and you minister in your home you do
[1:23:25] many things in much patience in
[1:23:27] afflictions
[1:23:28] in necessities in distresses in stripes
[1:23:32] in imprisonments in tumults in labor in
[1:23:36] labors in watchings in fasting so if i
[1:23:39] just stop there you go wow brother ed
[1:23:41] that's not very encouraging
[1:23:44] wow thanks a lot thanks for coming
[1:23:47] you know and so
[1:23:48] you know but it's a reality it's where
[1:23:50] we live right
[1:23:51] so and then he says in verse 6
[1:23:53] by pureness
[1:23:55] by knowledge
[1:23:56] by longsuffering
[1:23:58] by kindness
[1:23:59] by the holy ghost by love unfeign so
[1:24:03] in the middle of these conditions
[1:24:06] this is expected
[1:24:09] yet it's not expected of ourselves it's
[1:24:11] going to be god that brings that out
[1:24:15] and then we could take it how you know a
[1:24:17] diamond is formed in the blackness of
[1:24:20] coal with pressure and with all of these
[1:24:22] things and you get what's called a
[1:24:24] diamond out of that
[1:24:25] but here we are in our in our humanity
[1:24:28] i i don't know about you but i i if i
[1:24:31] know it's island life and it's a little
[1:24:33] slower but i'll tell you what i've
[1:24:35] watched people
[1:24:37] literally you don't know what's cooking
[1:24:39] inside of them
[1:24:41] under the pressure of this age
[1:24:43] they'll be just fine and then they'll
[1:24:45] just go off just on one little thing
[1:24:47] will will get them off that's the
[1:24:49] pressure of the age we're living in
[1:24:52] and so in the middle of that you've got
[1:24:54] to have a place to let off the pressure
[1:24:56] so it's got to be by god so here he says
[1:24:59] in verse 7 by the word of truth by the
[1:25:01] power of god by the armor of
[1:25:03] righteousness on the right hand on the
[1:25:05] left
[1:25:06] by honor and dishonor
[1:25:08] by evil report and good report
[1:25:11] as deceivers and yet true
[1:25:14] as unknown and yet well known
[1:25:16] as dying and behold we live as chastened
[1:25:20] and not killed
[1:25:21] as sorrowful
[1:25:23] yet always
[1:25:24] rejoicing as poor yet making many rich
[1:25:29] as having nothing and yet possessing all
[1:25:31] things
[1:25:33] now i could stop at every one of these
[1:25:35] but i'm just laying a groundwork a
[1:25:38] little bit for where we're at so
[1:25:40] as we look in the world and and the
[1:25:43] influences that are around us and and i
[1:25:46] love the way that the prophet would
[1:25:47] sometimes make things so so real
[1:25:51] in the way he would discuss it this is
[1:25:53] in a message
[1:25:54] the guide or a guide in 1962
[1:25:58] he makes the statement this way
[1:26:00] they see the hour is closing in
[1:26:03] a fog is coming over the earth
[1:26:07] great creeds and things are uniting
[1:26:10] together
[1:26:12] churches are confederating coming
[1:26:14] together
[1:26:16] and then he uh miss a
[1:26:19] a sentence or two and all things that
[1:26:21] they're threatening it's not new to us
[1:26:25] the gate great guide has showed us that
[1:26:29] in the path of the word and he makes
[1:26:32] this statement we're just passing
[1:26:36] through that part of it
[1:26:38] now so the important thing is not to see
[1:26:41] ourselves i i was
[1:26:44] as i made mention i came out in 1983
[1:26:47] and when i came out the call of god to
[1:26:50] me it was like
[1:26:52] i i i'd grown up in a message home it
[1:26:54] was a broken home my mom believed one
[1:26:56] thing my dad another i i'd come out of
[1:26:58] all of these things but when god began
[1:27:01] to deal with me and as a young man and
[1:27:05] and and i began it was like
[1:27:08] it became i couldn't understand it but
[1:27:10] it was like there wasn't much time left
[1:27:14] this this was the call this was my
[1:27:16] moment this was my time
[1:27:18] and and god knows he has a time for
[1:27:20] every one of us
[1:27:22] you know i i thought well god had to
[1:27:24] call me back then because i'm slow and i
[1:27:25] can't you know it takes me a long time
[1:27:27] to get going and i thought well you know
[1:27:30] what god probably had to call
[1:27:32] the snail into the ark earlier than he
[1:27:35] had to call the gazelle
[1:27:36] and i thought so i'm the snail but
[1:27:39] once i heard the call i had to go
[1:27:42] once the gazelle heard it they had to go
[1:27:44] so whatever way whatever time season
[1:27:46] you've been called we're all going to
[1:27:48] make it just in time
[1:27:50] so that's why i said brother jonathan
[1:27:52] god bless you i wish i had what you had
[1:27:54] at your age when i was there but you
[1:27:55] know what i'm here and it's part of the
[1:27:57] age as part of the quickening it's part
[1:28:00] of where we're at so
[1:28:01] and when i came in my view was oh thank
[1:28:04] god i'm saved and yet really what i
[1:28:07] wasn't seeing the reality was that
[1:28:10] somewhere in the book somewhere in the
[1:28:11] mind of god my name was written and
[1:28:14] nothing could happen until my name came
[1:28:17] there i couldn't see that part then and
[1:28:20] all i could see is how am i ever lucky
[1:28:22] i'm out of this and and you know i i
[1:28:24] grew up in the era of of you know i
[1:28:26] don't want you to look at the pictures
[1:28:28] of when i was out in the world and i was
[1:28:29] young because you you'd look at it and
[1:28:31] think wow you came out of that era
[1:28:33] brotherhood yes i came out of that era
[1:28:34] plaid suits and then and i wouldn't want
[1:28:37] to show you the things i wore in my
[1:28:38] casual attire because that would even be
[1:28:40] worse but i just say man i came out of
[1:28:43] that and that was the culture that was
[1:28:45] all i knew
[1:28:46] but if i look at it now here i am all
[1:28:48] these years that's faded that's nothing
[1:28:51] the part that i always really was was
[1:28:54] never there that was just what i came
[1:28:56] into but when god called that seed that
[1:28:59] there had to be something quick and
[1:29:01] there had to be something arise and and
[1:29:04] and and i i always grew up as a young
[1:29:06] child and i thought oh man why did i was
[1:29:08] i born in this family they go to church
[1:29:10] you know and it's twice on sunday and
[1:29:12] it's on wednesday that's what happens to
[1:29:14] the unregenerate mind and i think why
[1:29:16] was i in this family now i look back and
[1:29:19] say oh god thank you that i was born in
[1:29:22] this family
[1:29:23] thank you for for for you know as a
[1:29:26] teenager you know teenagers they you
[1:29:28] know when kids kids are like seven eight
[1:29:30] nine they love to be with mom and dad
[1:29:32] when they're like like uh you know start
[1:29:34] 12 13 and they're out driving in their
[1:29:37] friends and then they duck in the back
[1:29:38] seat and there's this you know i don't
[1:29:40] know oh my friends are gone yeah so it
[1:29:42] changes
[1:29:43] that's to the unregenerate but
[1:29:46] thank god like i was born in this family
[1:29:49] and and and i remember my friends used
[1:29:51] to ask me oh you your family does that
[1:29:52] no that's kind of strange and you grow
[1:29:54] up through these complexes but
[1:29:56] you you look at how god calls and
[1:29:58] wherever you're at and i'm i'm going to
[1:30:00] use a little bit of identification here
[1:30:03] um let's just go to hebrews chapter 11.
[1:30:06] i could use different ones
[1:30:08] i could use abraham i could use i'm
[1:30:09] going to use moses here for just a
[1:30:10] little bit
[1:30:12] hebrews chapter 11.
[1:30:15] and so this is this is dealing with with
[1:30:17] moses but
[1:30:18] you know it's like abraham
[1:30:21] i i we had a a brother that passed away
[1:30:24] and uh
[1:30:26] and uh
[1:30:28] and i remarked
[1:30:29] on his life
[1:30:31] because he may not have walked in the
[1:30:33] fullness of the unfolding
[1:30:35] in this last age but somewhere in his
[1:30:37] life god dealt with him and i said
[1:30:40] think about abraham he lived 175 years
[1:30:44] the first 75 years
[1:30:47] was nothing to write home about
[1:30:48] there was nothing no inkling that there
[1:30:51] was a seed of god there much less the
[1:30:53] father of the faith
[1:30:55] then at age 75 he calls him and abraham
[1:30:58] starts a walk
[1:30:59] abraham has no idea what's in front of
[1:31:01] him god knew what was in abraham but he
[1:31:03] also wanted abraham to know what was in
[1:31:06] him
[1:31:06] and that's why he allowed them to go
[1:31:08] through all the schooling and everything
[1:31:10] that he did so from from the age of 75
[1:31:13] to 99 until the time of the fulfillment
[1:31:16] of the promise then there's a little
[1:31:18] interval where isaac comes into play and
[1:31:20] abraham's still there in the death of
[1:31:21] sarah and and abraham then marries
[1:31:24] katira and and that was it at the age of
[1:31:26] i think 137 you don't hear much of
[1:31:28] abraham now until 175. so in that little
[1:31:32] span
[1:31:33] god saw this little piece of time out of
[1:31:36] abraham's whole life and he said that's
[1:31:38] what matters that's the part i'm going
[1:31:41] to focus on and if we can recognize
[1:31:43] there's a part of our lives that's
[1:31:45] written the same as it was with abraham
[1:31:47] and you're walking through time just the
[1:31:50] same way and if you could recognize you
[1:31:52] were born for this time you were born
[1:31:55] for this hour you were born to live at
[1:31:58] this time and express god to this
[1:32:01] generation
[1:32:03] somebody's got to declare him
[1:32:05] somewhere there's got to be a young
[1:32:07] person that's going to be raised up for
[1:32:09] a testimony
[1:32:10] and raised up and say this is a young
[1:32:12] person that stood in a school system
[1:32:14] this is a young child that was obedient
[1:32:17] to his parents this is this is a mother
[1:32:20] in her in her home in her environment
[1:32:23] and and everywhere god's gonna have a
[1:32:24] witness he's never left the world
[1:32:27] without a witness so let's let's just
[1:32:28] look at abre let's look at moses for a
[1:32:30] moment
[1:32:32] exit or sorry hebrews
[1:32:34] 11 23
[1:32:37] by faith moses when he was born
[1:32:40] he was hid three months of his parents
[1:32:44] now by faith moses when he was born his
[1:32:46] parents hid him by faith
[1:32:48] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:32:53] and this next verse and they were not
[1:32:55] afraid of the king's commandment
[1:32:58] so by faith they they knew the the law
[1:33:00] was to kill all the children under the
[1:33:03] age of two
[1:33:04] but they were not afraid and and
[1:33:07] furthermore they defied the king
[1:33:10] and by faith they they threw him out on
[1:33:12] the river
[1:33:13] and and yet you know it's one of the
[1:33:14] greatest story god always pulls the wool
[1:33:16] over the devil's eyes
[1:33:18] you know here's the god the devil
[1:33:19] anoints pharaoh just kill all the babies
[1:33:22] in the meantime there's a little ark
[1:33:24] that goes out lands right in pharaoh's
[1:33:26] backyard and and you know talk about the
[1:33:28] greatest government funding program ever
[1:33:30] there was he raises up moses in his own
[1:33:33] court
[1:33:34] he says i'm going to train him up i'm
[1:33:36] going to give him all all that we can't
[1:33:38] just to protect them all these years and
[1:33:40] and and
[1:33:41] and just pull the wool over their eyes
[1:33:43] now that wasn't enough that was his
[1:33:45] parents acting it was god's plan but now
[1:33:48] in verse 24 here it says
[1:33:51] by faith moses when he was come to year
[1:33:53] so
[1:33:55] the first 40 years of moses life was was
[1:33:57] something but now he comes to years
[1:34:00] you could take this phrase and you can
[1:34:02] go into the book of genesis where god
[1:34:04] comes and visits
[1:34:06] abraham
[1:34:07] and and it's elohim in in genesis
[1:34:10] chapter 2 in chapters 18 and he says i
[1:34:13] will return to you
[1:34:16] according to the time of life
[1:34:18] there was a life cycle that abraham had
[1:34:21] and it wasn't just the cyclical nature
[1:34:24] of the human
[1:34:25] human anatomy and sarah and all of that
[1:34:27] things but it was according to god
[1:34:30] season
[1:34:31] now all that i've invested is going to
[1:34:33] come to fruition there's there's
[1:34:35] something i've got there's a seed i've
[1:34:38] planted in the earth there's an abraham
[1:34:40] i i've i've not worked under the adam
[1:34:43] covenant i'm working under under the the
[1:34:45] grace covenant and i'm going to take a
[1:34:47] man that's a heathen and i'm going to
[1:34:49] pick him and it's my righteousness
[1:34:51] that's going to pick him and it's he's
[1:34:53] going to receive my righteousness and
[1:34:55] when those two come together it will
[1:34:58] produce exactly what i wanted to produce
[1:35:01] and even when he in his own nature and
[1:35:04] his own in his own natural being he
[1:35:06] makes mistakes and he stumbles and he
[1:35:08] falls
[1:35:09] you know i love i love the vision
[1:35:12] of the bible that it gives the old
[1:35:13] testament
[1:35:15] there's no no book like it it tells all
[1:35:17] the
[1:35:18] the faults you see all the faults of
[1:35:20] abraham
[1:35:22] you see all of those things but then
[1:35:24] paul
[1:35:25] looking now through the atonement
[1:35:27] looking through the eyes of god in the
[1:35:28] old testament he sees abraham and he
[1:35:30] says there was no fault in him he was
[1:35:33] perfect god looking and seeing him so it
[1:35:36] was god they
[1:35:38] what man sees but what god sees is a
[1:35:40] different thing
[1:35:43] so we want to be found under that
[1:35:46] so here he is now he says
[1:35:48] and and and and uh
[1:35:50] brother bannerman says in the message
[1:35:52] why christ speak i think it's wonderful
[1:35:53] i'm going to touch on this later in the
[1:35:55] week but he says
[1:35:56] now in our own way of looking it seems
[1:35:59] very hard but the all-wise god knows
[1:36:02] what he's doing he knows how to do
[1:36:04] things how to deal with man he knows
[1:36:07] what's in man
[1:36:09] he knows him we don't we only know from
[1:36:13] the intellectual side but he knows
[1:36:16] what's really in man amen
[1:36:19] as i think on my life and
[1:36:22] i remember different steps i used to
[1:36:24] take and
[1:36:25] i was a i was out i had a friend of mine
[1:36:28] a very close friend of mine
[1:36:29] and and you know the years that i was
[1:36:31] running in the world we'd gone out to a
[1:36:33] nightclub
[1:36:35] and we wouldn't stay and drink because
[1:36:36] it was too costly we go out to the car
[1:36:38] and drink in the car and it was we're
[1:36:39] sitting out there we're looking in the
[1:36:41] darkness
[1:36:42] and and he says to me one night he was
[1:36:44] an orthodox catholic
[1:36:46] and he says ed do you ever wonder what's
[1:36:48] out there so what do you mean out where
[1:36:50] it's just like out there i said dark out
[1:36:52] there he says no no like beyond that
[1:36:56] like you ever think there's a being
[1:36:57] somewhere and i'm going why now
[1:37:00] you know because and and he's he's going
[1:37:02] yeah like and in his own world he says
[1:37:05] you know do you ever think about the
[1:37:06] pope like do you think he ever hears a
[1:37:08] voice
[1:37:09] i'm sure he does hear a voice
[1:37:12] i don't know which one but you know i'm
[1:37:14] just and i'm there
[1:37:15] and i'm just being convicted i'm getting
[1:37:17] agitated
[1:37:19] why are you spoiling my good time
[1:37:22] and
[1:37:23] and and he's like he's he's going on
[1:37:25] this path and i'm going
[1:37:27] just have another drink you know and and
[1:37:29] i
[1:37:30] so here it is now seven years later this
[1:37:33] was my best friend he wants me to be the
[1:37:35] best man at his wedding god has spoke to
[1:37:37] me i've separated from all my friends i
[1:37:39] couldn't figure it out i couldn't
[1:37:40] understand it and he invites me to the
[1:37:42] best man and i said and i'm trying to
[1:37:44] explain to him i said do you remember
[1:37:45] that night you know when you spoke about
[1:37:47] this and this and this i knew exactly
[1:37:49] what you were talking about
[1:37:52] he said i don't remember that
[1:37:54] it wasn't for him it was for me it was
[1:37:57] the grace of god extended to me and i
[1:37:59] knew it was there all the time it wasn't
[1:38:02] that i was i suddenly became seed how do
[1:38:05] we become
[1:38:06] a son of god is it is it do we come we
[1:38:09] become seed no because we were seed
[1:38:12] therefore we can be reborn again it's
[1:38:15] always there it's always been in us but
[1:38:18] we're just a seed passing through time
[1:38:21] and now i look back and i see it i
[1:38:22] thought oh thank god that was there and
[1:38:25] then you could look at other things you
[1:38:26] all could have similar testimonies i
[1:38:29] remember here i was a young man and i'm
[1:38:30] wanting to do the right thing before god
[1:38:33] i i'm i'm going to go buy this car and
[1:38:35] you know i to start to pay ties to start
[1:38:37] to do things and and and you know it
[1:38:39] wasn't easy but i knew this is god's
[1:38:42] word i'm going to subject myself to it i
[1:38:44] remember going to buy a car and i
[1:38:45] thought
[1:38:46] i looked at the car and i prayed about
[1:38:47] it and i said i believe this is what it
[1:38:49] just felt right it felt like this is my
[1:38:51] car
[1:38:52] so
[1:38:53] i just prayed and i said lord if this is
[1:38:55] really the car let let me buy it for so
[1:38:57] much
[1:38:58] okay
[1:38:59] i went in there and i i wasn't uh
[1:39:02] you know some of you might be sharper in
[1:39:04] this kind of stuff but i wasn't i really
[1:39:05] should have come in with a lowball offer
[1:39:07] but i came in right with the amount i
[1:39:08] prayed
[1:39:09] and i said let me have the car for this
[1:39:11] he said well we'll talk to our manager
[1:39:13] you know the usual sales thing
[1:39:15] we'll let you have it for uh
[1:39:17] 300 more i said no it has to be for this
[1:39:19] price
[1:39:20] and then he went back out of the room
[1:39:22] they called the manager and says listen
[1:39:24] we will give it to you for a hundred
[1:39:25] dollars more than than what you're
[1:39:27] asking for and i could see it i knew it
[1:39:29] was it felt right it was my car and just
[1:39:32] in that moment i just thought okay it's
[1:39:33] mine i'll do it and then my heart got
[1:39:35] condemned
[1:39:36] and i was supposed to go and just
[1:39:38] arrange the little bit of financing i
[1:39:39] had to do and and i i went back and i
[1:39:41] just prayed i couldn't pray i couldn't
[1:39:42] do it right i couldn't and finally after
[1:39:45] three days i went back in there i went
[1:39:46] to the sales guy and i said
[1:39:48] listen
[1:39:49] i
[1:39:50] made a mistake
[1:39:52] and i if i lose the car i lose the car
[1:39:55] but what was more important to me was
[1:39:57] the peace of god in my heart
[1:39:59] and i said if i lose the car i lose the
[1:40:00] car and the guy goes i mean i said i'm a
[1:40:02] christian i made a mistake and the guy's
[1:40:04] like roland's oh my goodness i've heard
[1:40:05] them all now you know just
[1:40:07] and he goes i'll get the manager the
[1:40:08] manager comes out and he goes what
[1:40:11] he stomps out of the room and he comes
[1:40:12] back in and he brings the bible down and
[1:40:14] flops on the desk if you're a christian
[1:40:17] you've got to keep your word i said
[1:40:18] that's the problem i didn't
[1:40:20] he said well christian doesn't renege on
[1:40:22] his deals
[1:40:23] and i said i'm sorry i made a mistake
[1:40:25] i'm i'm wrong i made the mistake
[1:40:27] he stomps out of the room at that moment
[1:40:30] the peace i had
[1:40:31] with that little decision
[1:40:33] i wouldn't trade it for nothing because
[1:40:35] i knew i'd surrender to god that was a
[1:40:38] baby step but i surrendered to god it
[1:40:41] wasn't my flesh i was a young man this
[1:40:43] was a nice car like i mean
[1:40:45] this this had some noise to it this had
[1:40:47] different things going on that would you
[1:40:49] know that would juice up the male
[1:40:50] testosterone a little bit like it it it
[1:40:53] did something so i'm there and i'm good
[1:40:55] but the peace i had you know that
[1:40:57] manager comes back in and he says
[1:41:00] well
[1:41:01] i believe god wants you to have that car
[1:41:02] because i'm going to give it to you for
[1:41:04] this price
[1:41:05] thank you lord
[1:41:07] but it was a lesson
[1:41:09] and i'm glad i went through it because
[1:41:11] it taught me that there's something
[1:41:13] inside of me that's greater than the
[1:41:14] outer man and i want to give place to
[1:41:17] that i want to allow that half the
[1:41:18] preeminence in my life i want that more
[1:41:22] than i want anything else
[1:41:24] it helped me many years down the road
[1:41:27] when i met my wife
[1:41:28] and i know
[1:41:30] that was god's choice for me and i know
[1:41:33] it was and i'll tell you many times i've
[1:41:35] come back and i've said lord and she can
[1:41:38] testify the same thing it was you that
[1:41:40] brought us together i know what i had
[1:41:42] surrendered to god i know what i had
[1:41:44] given him and to this day i've been
[1:41:46] blessed because of it
[1:41:47] so i thank god so i'm just using little
[1:41:50] steps back to moses
[1:41:52] moses
[1:41:53] he was
[1:41:55] we only know the intellectual side god
[1:41:58] knows what's in man moses was born in
[1:42:00] this world a gifted boy he was born to
[1:42:02] be a prophet a deliverer he was born
[1:42:05] with the equipment in him
[1:42:07] every man that comes into the world is
[1:42:10] born with this equipment and i firmly
[1:42:12] believe in the foreknowledge of god
[1:42:15] the predestination
[1:42:17] so brother madam now goes and says it
[1:42:19] this way he says
[1:42:20] these great qualities he was born for a
[1:42:24] certain thing
[1:42:26] god has a purpose
[1:42:28] of you being here
[1:42:30] see if you can only get to that place
[1:42:35] how much trouble you save god
[1:42:37] and yourself to
[1:42:40] but sometimes we take the road of jacob
[1:42:42] you know just no this is what i want and
[1:42:45] i'll i'll get it and i'll cheat a little
[1:42:47] along this way and i'll cheat this way
[1:42:48] and you know god let jacob go on a long
[1:42:52] road
[1:42:53] you know jacob means shyster who did who
[1:42:56] did god allow jacob to hook up with
[1:42:59] laban
[1:43:01] equally probably 10 times the shyster
[1:43:04] because that's how many times he changed
[1:43:06] his wages but he allowed all those
[1:43:08] things to happen and and and finally you
[1:43:10] know
[1:43:11] jacob sneaks away in the dead of night
[1:43:13] and he does all of these things but
[1:43:15] inside of jacob you know though the
[1:43:18] outward was not right and though esau
[1:43:20] was the better man and esau took care of
[1:43:23] his mom and esau did all of these things
[1:43:25] but inside of jacob was something that
[1:43:28] god saw and he desired and he loved it
[1:43:31] and when it came out in moments of
[1:43:33] crisis
[1:43:34] it was jacob that came out and he
[1:43:36] finally came to the river and he heard
[1:43:38] esau was coming and you know like any
[1:43:41] man that real man he sends his wives
[1:43:44] before him
[1:43:45] and and so he's he's just bringing him
[1:43:47] out there into two caps and then he
[1:43:49] stays back at the river but here he's
[1:43:52] now face to face with god
[1:43:55] and as he's face to face with god the
[1:43:57] key the angel keeps asking himself as
[1:43:59] he's wrestling what's your name
[1:44:03] what's your name you finally have to
[1:44:05] confess it jacob i'm a shyster
[1:44:08] and when that's all god wants to hear
[1:44:10] confess
[1:44:12] friends we we can't we can't work
[1:44:14] ourselves up to religion i'm no good we
[1:44:17] are no good in our flesh but the god
[1:44:20] that has called us
[1:44:22] that god
[1:44:23] what is it revelations
[1:44:25] 12 he says we overcome
[1:44:28] by the blood of the lamb
[1:44:30] that that that that's step one number
[1:44:33] two by the word of our testimony so it's
[1:44:36] never our righteousness and our
[1:44:38] testimony is
[1:44:40] testimony it's it's a test of i moani so
[1:44:43] it's it's i've got to be a part of it
[1:44:45] i've got to confess it
[1:44:47] by our testimony and then the last thing
[1:44:49] is and they love not their lives to
[1:44:51] death so
[1:44:52] our desires to the world become dead
[1:44:54] they
[1:44:55] they die out and we get to this place so
[1:44:58] he says now you had a purpose
[1:45:00] moses was born he said
[1:45:03] and i'm going to try and miss some of
[1:45:05] this you can read in the message why
[1:45:07] christ speak
[1:45:08] he said
[1:45:10] the seed was laying there with an
[1:45:12] intellectual conception
[1:45:14] with all the faith that he was born to
[1:45:16] deliver the people yet it never came to
[1:45:19] light
[1:45:20] until the light from the burning bush
[1:45:22] flashed across it he's seen it
[1:45:24] not something he read about
[1:45:27] not something he's seen with his eyes
[1:45:30] something that spoke to him
[1:45:33] and he spoke back to it
[1:45:36] oh
[1:45:37] how that brings life he says
[1:45:41] any woman any boy or girl with an
[1:45:44] intellectual conception of what the word
[1:45:46] is can never have a full foundation
[1:45:50] until they've met that light that brings
[1:45:54] the word to reality
[1:45:56] oh how we need to meet that
[1:45:59] oh we need to know him and meet him i
[1:46:02] believe we're living in our friends
[1:46:04] where it's not so much our lateral
[1:46:07] relationships who it is but it's our
[1:46:10] it's our relationship vertically with
[1:46:12] god that matters and and that daily
[1:46:15] connection with him that's the important
[1:46:17] thing
[1:46:18] no church in its practice no matter how
[1:46:21] intellectual and fundamental can thrive
[1:46:23] until the supernatural is made known
[1:46:26] among the people and they see it
[1:46:28] something they can talk to that talks
[1:46:30] back to them
[1:46:32] and and he says
[1:46:33] that's and that vindicates this written
[1:46:36] word i i love to see that
[1:46:39] you know we all have our orderly fashion
[1:46:41] we we all have these things but i'll
[1:46:43] tell you what just to to let go and let
[1:46:45] god
[1:46:46] we we have
[1:46:48] prayer meetings on a bi-weekly bi-weekly
[1:46:51] basis and we just had one the other just
[1:46:53] a few
[1:46:55] weeks ago brother dale you'd remember
[1:46:57] and we're there and we we just had
[1:46:59] situation sister laura one of them and
[1:47:01] other situations were praying about and
[1:47:04] and we're there and we just closed the
[1:47:06] service and you know hearts had
[1:47:07] expressed what it was and we just began
[1:47:10] to sing a song
[1:47:12] and you know you know
[1:47:13] the greatest thing you can do is you can
[1:47:15] turn your eyes on jesus
[1:47:17] sometimes we try to
[1:47:19] manufacture just an experience we we try
[1:47:23] to make it happen
[1:47:25] but all you need to do is focus on jesus
[1:47:27] and and i just got to this place and i
[1:47:29] said lord you're the one
[1:47:30] and i just began to raise my hands and
[1:47:33] and all of a sudden i don't even know
[1:47:35] how it happened but just something
[1:47:36] overtook me and just words of praise and
[1:47:40] glory and honor it was it was yielded to
[1:47:43] god when he's first
[1:47:46] friends then everything takes care of
[1:47:48] itself
[1:47:49] you if there's if there's anybody who
[1:47:52] who suffers depression the biggest thing
[1:47:54] you need to do is get yourself off of i
[1:47:56] and look to him if you ever want to
[1:47:58] overcome if there's ever a suicide
[1:48:00] spirit just look to him
[1:48:02] make him the center of your attention
[1:48:05] make him the center of everything and
[1:48:07] stop worrying about yourself that's what
[1:48:09] the world tells you to take care of
[1:48:11] yourself and do things but when it's on
[1:48:13] him that's when everything turns right
[1:48:16] that's when your movement is right
[1:48:18] that's when your words are right that's
[1:48:20] when your love is correct when your
[1:48:22] attention's on him
[1:48:25] oh he's everything he is all in all
[1:48:28] that's that's where we're going here
[1:48:30] and i believe i'll come to some
[1:48:31] scriptures in in the next services but
[1:48:33] i'm i he's all in all he extends far
[1:48:36] further than we think so here's moses
[1:48:38] and
[1:48:39] as as he's moving along and and he's
[1:48:42] he's passing through
[1:48:43] you know
[1:48:44] just heard that testimony of sister
[1:48:46] laura
[1:48:48] we had a sister in our church
[1:48:53] sister vera her last name was
[1:48:56] her husband lauren had passed away
[1:48:59] probably 10 years earlier she was in her
[1:49:01] 80s
[1:49:02] healthy just just wonderful but you'd
[1:49:04] looked in her eyes you could see
[1:49:06] she was tired and
[1:49:08] we had a few covet creases cases break
[1:49:11] out in our church and
[1:49:12] during that time we lost three people
[1:49:14] two to covert one as an elderly brother
[1:49:16] but all were elderly actually and all if
[1:49:19] i actually look at it
[1:49:20] they didn't want to stay anymore they'd
[1:49:22] lost their will they wanted to go home
[1:49:24] and you know when that desire goes and
[1:49:26] they go home she was just doing fine and
[1:49:29] and she was there at the meetings she
[1:49:31] went to the store she dropped in the
[1:49:32] middle of the store
[1:49:34] next thing she woke up in the hospital
[1:49:36] she has a daughter in the united states
[1:49:38] and
[1:49:39] and she's in the hospital seemingly
[1:49:40] doing okay not not a lot of issues
[1:49:43] and her daughter is just communicating
[1:49:45] with her regular and she says
[1:49:47] to her daughter she says
[1:49:49] ma she says to charlene i i'm gonna go
[1:49:52] home
[1:49:53] and charlene says no you can't go home
[1:49:55] she's you gotta wait till they discharge
[1:49:57] you and connect you she says i don't
[1:49:59] wanna go to the house
[1:50:01] i wanna go home and be with lauren
[1:50:04] and he says well mom yeah that's nice
[1:50:06] mom so that was the next day so the next
[1:50:08] day she calls and she says
[1:50:11] um
[1:50:11] charlene they're coming for me really
[1:50:13] soon now
[1:50:14] within three hours she was gone
[1:50:17] she had her heart's desire she she
[1:50:19] wasn't looking here anymore and and i
[1:50:22] and you can say you know i've watched
[1:50:24] the lifespan of of believers you know
[1:50:26] when they get to a certain time and it's
[1:50:28] almost like their theophany is calling
[1:50:31] and and just begin to
[1:50:33] you know i
[1:50:34] my mother is 89 i wouldn't be alive if
[1:50:37] it wasn't for my mother she prayed for
[1:50:39] me she's done things for me
[1:50:42] you know lately i just just
[1:50:44] she seems to she said to me the other
[1:50:46] day she said
[1:50:48] ed i don't know what it is
[1:50:50] i keep hearing the singing in the house
[1:50:53] and she says and i know i don't have the
[1:50:55] cassette player but it's really nice
[1:50:57] singing
[1:50:58] and i thought okay and then she's now
[1:51:00] said that a few times
[1:51:02] you know
[1:51:03] at the age my mom hit 70 and and she
[1:51:07] she she by the grace of god watched god
[1:51:10] changed me from a renegade to where i
[1:51:12] was at and i would say
[1:51:14] i remember all the times i was out till
[1:51:16] two in the morning
[1:51:18] and then i all of a sudden this wherever
[1:51:20] the function i was it was going strong
[1:51:22] and also and it just disbanded it all
[1:51:24] disappeared and i well there's nowhere
[1:51:26] to go i just better go home
[1:51:28] i go home and here's my mom on her knees
[1:51:29] praying she said i woke up half an hour
[1:51:31] ago
[1:51:32] and you weren't home and i started
[1:51:34] praying and now i knew what broke up the
[1:51:36] party
[1:51:38] you think that there's not power in
[1:51:40] prayer there is power in prayer
[1:51:43] she
[1:51:44] she could tell you
[1:51:45] my brother was in a serious accident and
[1:51:47] she said
[1:51:48] and she woke up with a start she says
[1:51:50] where were you last night
[1:51:52] the next morning she said to my brother
[1:51:54] i saw the wheel hanging off of a cliff
[1:51:57] where were you
[1:51:58] and he said it was close mom it was
[1:52:00] really close
[1:52:02] you don't think that god's in the
[1:52:04] there's a world there's a dimension that
[1:52:06] is so real
[1:52:08] and if we could just tap into it and
[1:52:10] live in it i believe it's happening
[1:52:12] around us
[1:52:14] you know i don't know how many of you
[1:52:15] remember brother dan williams it was a
[1:52:17] minister out of
[1:52:18] louisiana brother dan williams
[1:52:20] he passed on many years ago
[1:52:22] well brother
[1:52:24] homer longoria his wife had passed away
[1:52:26] or she was passing away the children
[1:52:29] come in the room
[1:52:30] and you know we all think
[1:52:33] you know as we read these scriptures
[1:52:34] about the natural man and the spiritual
[1:52:37] man
[1:52:38] god knows our nature he knows who we are
[1:52:40] he he gave us these characters you want
[1:52:42] to be yourself
[1:52:43] brother dan was always kind of like you
[1:52:45] know he was a fun guy to be around like
[1:52:47] he he he was just he relatable to
[1:52:50] everybody and and so here he here he
[1:52:53] comes
[1:52:54] here she comes and she's just at her
[1:52:55] time of passing and her children are in
[1:52:58] the room and she can she's talking now
[1:53:01] she's talking and she's going oh
[1:53:03] and and and it says mom what are you
[1:53:05] seeing
[1:53:06] i just saw brother dan
[1:53:09] do you know that he still got the sense
[1:53:10] of humor
[1:53:13] and i thought
[1:53:14] god knows these things
[1:53:16] god knows where we're at
[1:53:18] you know here's here's my mom you know
[1:53:20] she's she says it's age of 70. i'm ready
[1:53:22] to give my life to the lord
[1:53:25] if he wants to take me i'm ready to go
[1:53:28] and here here you know but yet we still
[1:53:30] live here and here she is in the middle
[1:53:32] we had a there's a flood in her basement
[1:53:33] you know and she came out of the war
[1:53:35] years and she had to do canning and all
[1:53:37] these things there was a flood she's got
[1:53:38] like memorabilia i call it but she
[1:53:40] thinks she can use it sometime of
[1:53:42] canning goods and and different things
[1:53:44] and hasn't been touched in 20 years or
[1:53:46] whatever and there's a flood and i'm
[1:53:48] starting to take things out she's going
[1:53:50] no no no don't take that don't just
[1:53:52] careful we might need that and here on
[1:53:54] one hand she's i'm ready to go here on
[1:53:56] the other hand watch out
[1:53:58] we're still in this flesh
[1:54:00] we're still here like we still have our
[1:54:02] humanity
[1:54:04] and and so we we got to recognize and
[1:54:06] begin to separate and say okay here's my
[1:54:09] natural man but there's a spiritual man
[1:54:11] inside there's a seed inside that's
[1:54:14] longing to go home
[1:54:15] you know i i love to go out and get on
[1:54:18] the water and get kayaking or solitude
[1:54:20] or or you know travel we used to love to
[1:54:22] travel and you know and and do different
[1:54:25] things and
[1:54:26] and as much as i enjoy those things i
[1:54:28] would say they don't have the the level
[1:54:31] of satisfaction they did anymore why
[1:54:33] we're in a season where it's time to
[1:54:35] come a little higher
[1:54:38] you know i i
[1:54:39] i don't want to go just to a lake and
[1:54:41] hear somebody park next to somebody or
[1:54:44] camp somebody and they turn the music on
[1:54:46] what good is that
[1:54:48] i want to go home and i think that that
[1:54:51] that that's rising up in us more and
[1:54:53] more so i think we need to just keep our
[1:54:56] eyes and focus let me keep going
[1:54:58] hebrews 11
[1:55:00] verse 25
[1:55:02] he refused to be called the son of
[1:55:03] pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:55:06] suffer affliction with the people of god
[1:55:09] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:55:12] season
[1:55:14] so
[1:55:15] he began to choose
[1:55:19] he began to look and as brother branham
[1:55:21] would say
[1:55:22] pharaoh looked out of the window and he
[1:55:24] saw these people and he said they're
[1:55:26] slaves
[1:55:27] they're mud daubers
[1:55:29] now
[1:55:30] moses was raised up in that court
[1:55:33] trained in all the ways
[1:55:35] but he began to look out of that court
[1:55:37] and when god the same window and he
[1:55:39] began to look and said no they're not
[1:55:41] slaves
[1:55:42] these are the people of god they're
[1:55:44] esteemed of god
[1:55:46] and i i
[1:55:48] there was times i wouldn't want to be
[1:55:50] seen with believers in the company my
[1:55:52] friends but i'll tell you what i'm proud
[1:55:54] to be with believers
[1:55:56] i'm proud to walk with my wife
[1:55:58] down
[1:55:59] the mall or or in the shopping we don't
[1:56:01] often go shopping together because as
[1:56:03] brother barry would say men go shopping
[1:56:05] women go shopping
[1:56:07] but but you know just
[1:56:09] it's it's like when we're on holidays or
[1:56:11] somewhere then we go together right and
[1:56:13] you know
[1:56:14] men are there for the quick strike
[1:56:15] approach you know which ex which
[1:56:17] entrance how do i get the store click
[1:56:18] and how would i go and you know and then
[1:56:20] my wife would spend two hours at the
[1:56:22] mall and say well what do you they
[1:56:24] didn't have anything you mean all the
[1:56:26] shelves were empty no no that's not what
[1:56:28] i meant but they didn't have what i what
[1:56:29] i was shopping for and so anyway i just
[1:56:32] say all of that you know my wife is to
[1:56:34] me the epitome of what i believe you
[1:56:37] know we we go somewhere and and and
[1:56:40] and this is this is the glory of what i
[1:56:43] believe i they might not believe my
[1:56:45] doctrine but watch my wife
[1:56:47] and and the woman is a reflection the
[1:56:49] bride is a reflection of who christ is
[1:56:52] so we begin to see
[1:56:54] we begin to look at things differently
[1:56:57] we don't we don't look with natural eyes
[1:56:59] we begin to look and and our vision has
[1:57:02] to change and so brother branham would
[1:57:04] talk about this with moses he said moses
[1:57:07] looked on this people and said they're
[1:57:09] god's blessed people
[1:57:11] and he says oh if christians today if
[1:57:14] you rely on
[1:57:15] their senses of what they can see what
[1:57:17] they understand instead of their faith
[1:57:20] then you look with your eye and the
[1:57:21] glamour you women he said you must let
[1:57:23] your hair grow you mustn't and you know
[1:57:25] you have to remember we're an unredeemed
[1:57:27] flesh
[1:57:29] so you you begin to look at these things
[1:57:31] and it begins to pull you to those
[1:57:33] things so we we need to always stay in
[1:57:36] the channel and allow our soul to be fed
[1:57:40] now i don't mean being super spiritual
[1:57:42] but just stay away from things that
[1:57:43] cause you trouble
[1:57:44] don't don't go down that road
[1:57:46] and and you know and brother ram says
[1:57:49] you i don't want to read everything for
[1:57:51] the sake of time but when you start
[1:57:53] looking at those things it paralyzes
[1:57:55] your faith
[1:57:56] you don't give your faith a chance to
[1:57:59] grow
[1:58:00] we find moses's faith led him to watch
[1:58:04] what would be not what was
[1:58:09] i was coming into a situation where i
[1:58:11] had to
[1:58:12] to deal with a certain individual
[1:58:14] and
[1:58:15] and it was even in a in a church realm
[1:58:18] and and i thought well what would this
[1:58:20] individual think if i did this and this
[1:58:24] and and i was just under great agony and
[1:58:26] stress and as i as i came to it the
[1:58:29] thought just started coming to me
[1:58:31] i'm not going to stand before this
[1:58:33] individual at the day of judgment i'm
[1:58:35] going to stand before god
[1:58:36] it says therefore lord i'm going to look
[1:58:38] to you and see what you want me to see
[1:58:41] not what this individual thinks i should
[1:58:44] be not what i think i should be in the
[1:58:46] eyes of that individual but we want to
[1:58:48] look through the eyes of god you know i
[1:58:51] always marvel about the spies that went
[1:58:53] across the the in into the ten the
[1:58:56] twelve spies that went into the into the
[1:58:59] promised land to search out the land you
[1:59:01] know 10 of them came back and i imagine
[1:59:03] if they had a powerpoint presentation i
[1:59:05] was i was imagining what would it be
[1:59:06] like you know and and so 10 of them you
[1:59:08] know they would focus and they'd have
[1:59:10] the powerpoint up there and and and in
[1:59:13] their in there and you actually read the
[1:59:15] bible it says
[1:59:17] in the eyes of them we looked like
[1:59:19] grasshoppers so they're not even looking
[1:59:21] through their own eyes they're looking
[1:59:22] through what they think
[1:59:25] them those giants are looking at well
[1:59:27] they look at us like grasshoppers so if
[1:59:29] that was their perspective that's what
[1:59:31] the powerpoint showed so no doubt as as
[1:59:34] you looked at the powerpoint they were
[1:59:36] looking up at the knees in the knobby
[1:59:38] knees they were looking up at these
[1:59:40] these giants that was that was the focus
[1:59:43] and maybe in the background out of focus
[1:59:45] there were some grapes there were some
[1:59:47] of the promises but they began to look
[1:59:50] by what their eyesight saw so
[1:59:53] faith
[1:59:54] gets you to see what god wants you to
[1:59:56] see
[1:59:57] so i'm not you know and so then i
[1:59:58] imagine here's joshua and kill hold and
[2:00:00] hold it that's the wrong power point let
[2:00:02] me show you the one look at this valley
[2:00:05] look at these things ah there's a few
[2:00:06] giants down there but they began to look
[2:00:08] at the right thing
[2:00:10] so so we need to i i believe we really
[2:00:13] need to bring this into play
[2:00:16] i i believe we don't just come to church
[2:00:19] you know slip into a routine and then
[2:00:22] say okay i got to think good thoughts
[2:00:24] i'm in church no i think
[2:00:25] we need to put it into practice the
[2:00:28] minute we step out the door the minute i
[2:00:30] walk out the door i'm a christian i'm
[2:00:32] going to think good thoughts i'm going
[2:00:34] to allow my mind this is a battleground
[2:00:36] but i'm not giving it to the devil i'm
[2:00:38] giving it to god i'm going to allow good
[2:00:41] things to to come into my mind
[2:00:44] and so it affects our vision it affects
[2:00:47] our our seeing so here's moses he said
[2:00:50] he began to see
[2:00:53] either your faith
[2:00:56] will paralyze the glamour or the glamour
[2:00:58] will terrorize your paralyze your faith
[2:01:02] now brother branham brings this down to
[2:01:04] now it's easy to look back at
[2:01:06] historical things but he brings it right
[2:01:08] to us
[2:01:11] he said now that's a hard thing for a
[2:01:12] man with a position
[2:01:15] that's a hard thing for the teenage girl
[2:01:17] that's pretty
[2:01:19] that's a hard thing for the teenage boy
[2:01:21] that's popular in school
[2:01:23] a star in basketball
[2:01:26] oh young fellow how god could use you
[2:01:29] young girl
[2:01:30] you and your fine pretty little queenish
[2:01:33] looks
[2:01:34] why don't you use that influence to the
[2:01:36] kingdom of god
[2:01:38] what god gave it to you for
[2:01:41] the virtue of womanhood
[2:01:43] use it that way you're bound to come out
[2:01:45] the right way but anyway other way
[2:01:47] you've got to fail you'll be a total
[2:01:50] total failure
[2:01:51] god made you
[2:01:52] nobody else can take your place
[2:01:55] nobody can feel that you must be that
[2:01:58] way let me finish in hebrews and i'm
[2:02:00] going to move on to something else here
[2:02:02] he says in verse 26 esteeming the
[2:02:04] reproach of christ
[2:02:07] greater riches than the treasures in
[2:02:09] egypt
[2:02:10] he had respect unto the recompense of
[2:02:12] the reward in other words
[2:02:14] he didn't look at the future he looked
[2:02:16] down the road
[2:02:18] and he says this by faith he forsake
[2:02:21] egypt not fearing the wrath of the king
[2:02:25] but he endured as seeing him
[2:02:28] who is
[2:02:30] invisible i think we need to begin to
[2:02:33] see
[2:02:35] the one thing i i marvel on
[2:02:38] you know i i watched the videos of
[2:02:41] luther and and what he fought and how
[2:02:43] catholicism brought in you know
[2:02:46] catholicism began to rule i'm just
[2:02:48] speaking a series at home on organized
[2:02:50] religion and taking it back to genesis
[2:02:53] and taking out how even we can slip into
[2:02:56] the same things right in the message
[2:02:58] we can bring our children up and and
[2:03:01] fear if you don't do this if you don't
[2:03:03] do that but god doesn't operate by fear
[2:03:06] the the catholic church was the one who
[2:03:08] put pictures of hell and stuff up and
[2:03:11] they began to bring purgatory and you
[2:03:13] know and we begin to get that way even
[2:03:15] around the message somebody's out in the
[2:03:16] world and they come in okay well just
[2:03:19] sit there you've got to pay your dues
[2:03:21] you no the minute they're saved and they
[2:03:23] actually repent they're on par with
[2:03:25] every one of us the blood of the lamb is
[2:03:27] that powerful
[2:03:29] and and so we we got to be careful that
[2:03:31] we don't allow these things to just slip
[2:03:33] in we want to we want to bring in the
[2:03:35] freedom and the liberty of god in into
[2:03:39] into into where we're going and and so
[2:03:41] it's important that we we we keep this
[2:03:44] vision before us the right way and we
[2:03:46] see we see christ now i i want to just
[2:03:50] let me let me finish this he says
[2:03:52] uh no
[2:03:54] i've read this already okay
[2:03:56] so so we have a place and god has a
[2:03:59] place for us
[2:04:01] and and we need to begin to see it that
[2:04:03] way and i i'm using this in my own
[2:04:06] testimony but
[2:04:08] when i first came out i never thought
[2:04:12] i thought oh if i could only scrape in
[2:04:15] when i never realized the heart of god
[2:04:17] was beating for me and he wanted me to
[2:04:20] come to a place and and he wanted me to
[2:04:22] be there more than i wanted it myself
[2:04:24] and it was the devil that was beating me
[2:04:26] down it was the devil that was bringing
[2:04:28] all of these things but but what was
[2:04:31] unfolding as we come in as we begin to
[2:04:33] see
[2:04:34] more and more of god
[2:04:36] and
[2:04:37] i i'm going to just only use like an
[2:04:39] example because we we often view
[2:04:42] you know i gotta escape as we're the
[2:04:44] little pee-wee but really things
[2:04:46] as i see them are beginning to rotate
[2:04:48] more and more
[2:04:50] around the bride i i was looking at a
[2:04:52] couple of the testimonies that brother
[2:04:53] berry had put up
[2:04:54] and uh
[2:04:55] about a sister who was riding the bus
[2:04:58] and she somehow on the bus in ukraine
[2:05:01] she got off a stop too early and as she
[2:05:03] got off a stop if this was brother barry
[2:05:04] or another brother i don't know
[2:05:06] she got off a stop too early
[2:05:08] and she she got out and she says
[2:05:11] what am i doing here how come i got off
[2:05:13] here
[2:05:13] and the bus went on another block and a
[2:05:16] bomb hit it and here she was
[2:05:19] that was luck no that was the ordination
[2:05:21] of god
[2:05:22] and and and god's program
[2:05:25] i i'm beginning to see more and more is
[2:05:28] it all revolves around us the bride
[2:05:32] my wife and i we just traveled you know
[2:05:34] even the circumstances of not having our
[2:05:36] trip right and everything we have a
[2:05:38] layover in toronto and we stop and we
[2:05:41] meet a young man
[2:05:43] who was
[2:05:44] uh
[2:05:45] in my my middle son's school from and
[2:05:48] was a friend of us for many years he's
[2:05:50] not a message believer he's a he's a
[2:05:52] good young man he's he's a big big kid
[2:05:55] and and we just saw him and we just met
[2:05:56] him and
[2:05:58] i remember my boy was in junior high he
[2:06:01] was going through
[2:06:02] he's he's he's a smaller
[2:06:04] smaller boy
[2:06:05] and and and something was changing in
[2:06:08] his behavior and i he left some books at
[2:06:10] school one night and i went after there
[2:06:12] and i i just felt so
[2:06:14] grieved something's wrong
[2:06:16] and i stopped and i prayed over his
[2:06:18] locker and i said
[2:06:20] lord i take charge of this school
[2:06:22] and all the influences for the sake of
[2:06:25] my son who is your son
[2:06:28] and i just prayed that prayer
[2:06:31] my son i didn't know it was the victim
[2:06:33] of bullying
[2:06:34] and he was walking with this
[2:06:36] man named thomas is the guy we saw at
[2:06:38] the airport he was walking with him down
[2:06:40] school and this bully had come
[2:06:42] and see my son and my son kind of went
[2:06:45] off the side and then
[2:06:46] this bigger
[2:06:47] he's a big farm kid
[2:06:49] thomas and and he must have been 12 13
[2:06:51] or something at the time but he was like
[2:06:53] six foot
[2:06:55] and he noticed he's a gentle gentle man
[2:06:57] you know and you notice caleb is just
[2:06:59] there and he says is that guy bothering
[2:07:01] you
[2:07:02] yeah he's bothering me
[2:07:04] and as that man comes he stops he pushes
[2:07:06] him up against the locker
[2:07:08] you don't touch him
[2:07:11] and he never bothered my son again
[2:07:13] and god had that boy there for a reason
[2:07:18] so if if we if we view oh i gotta
[2:07:20] safeguard my child no we've gotta we've
[2:07:22] gotta empower one thing that is the god
[2:07:25] in us
[2:07:26] over every situation
[2:07:29] and i we've seen it a number of times in
[2:07:31] in in things in our family and in our
[2:07:33] home different things that we've gone
[2:07:35] through and i remember our daughter we
[2:07:37] went to the to the school and it was a
[2:07:39] logos program was a christian based
[2:07:41] program but it was in the public system
[2:07:43] and our daughter he was very good
[2:07:45] academically and and we went and we
[2:07:48] brought her into the first day of junior
[2:07:49] high and we went there and we we met the
[2:07:51] principal and we just said listen our
[2:07:53] daughter will not be participating in
[2:07:55] physical education activities she won't
[2:07:57] be doing this and this and and she won't
[2:07:59] be doing halloween or there was no
[2:08:00] halloween but it was these are these
[2:08:02] things and their principles looking
[2:08:04] okay she's looking at us like we got
[2:08:05] three eyes or something right and and he
[2:08:08] said let me call the the phys ed teacher
[2:08:10] he called the phys ed teacher and he
[2:08:11] called him in and and and he he said
[2:08:14] okay yeah we'll do that we'll you know
[2:08:16] and so i wasn't dominating him i was
[2:08:18] just telling him this is what we stand
[2:08:20] for
[2:08:21] after three years my daughter had honors
[2:08:23] every year she volunteered my wife was
[2:08:26] there every day after three years we
[2:08:28] come to the final thing and the
[2:08:30] principal comes up to us and he's got
[2:08:32] tears in his eyes and he says
[2:08:34] i want to thank you your family
[2:08:36] has been a blessing in this school
[2:08:39] and your daughter
[2:08:40] and he had literally had tears in his
[2:08:42] eyes
[2:08:43] friends these things are ours they're
[2:08:45] our inheritance we don't have to to to
[2:08:48] just knuckle down no we we say we are
[2:08:51] the children of god
[2:08:53] and i think we can employ them with our
[2:08:55] families and with our children and
[2:08:57] wherever they go
[2:08:59] god's eyes are upon us
[2:09:01] and and we need to just be able to walk
[2:09:03] with those things
[2:09:06] all right let's return to the book of
[2:09:08] mark chapter eight for a well in a few
[2:09:10] moments
[2:09:11] that was a long time in hebrews just a
[2:09:12] quick scripture but i'm
[2:09:15] i i'm just i'm just sharing tonight i
[2:09:17] want to make this just pertinent and
[2:09:19] real i've got some other thoughts that i
[2:09:21] actually meant to do tonight but i as i
[2:09:24] was studying this afternoon i just said
[2:09:25] no just just push that off a little bit
[2:09:27] so i'm doing that
[2:09:28] and i'm doing this so mark chapter 8.
[2:09:34] we're going to read from verse 22.
[2:09:38] now
[2:09:41] and he came to bethsaida and they they
[2:09:43] were bringing a blind man unto him
[2:09:47] and they besought him to touch him
[2:09:50] and he took the blind man by the hand
[2:09:53] and he took him out of his town
[2:09:55] and when he had spit
[2:09:58] on his eyes man i'm sure there was glad
[2:10:00] there's no
[2:10:01] health inspectors there at that moment
[2:10:04] and when he had spit on his eyes and put
[2:10:07] his hands upon him he asked him
[2:10:11] if he saw ought
[2:10:14] and he looked up and he said i see men
[2:10:17] as trees walking
[2:10:20] now
[2:10:20] i i haven't gone into this and i
[2:10:23] probably should
[2:10:25] you know i won't do this to you
[2:10:26] sweetheart but my wife worked for an
[2:10:28] optometrist and i could get her come up
[2:10:30] here and explain but she'd be horrified
[2:10:31] if i did that so i'm not going to do
[2:10:33] that but
[2:10:34] they claim that most
[2:10:36] optometrists and
[2:10:38] and and surgeons that work with the eye
[2:10:40] are christians because
[2:10:42] they say there is no organism in the
[2:10:45] human body like the eye
[2:10:48] and they say there's no way a big bang
[2:10:50] theory created this they they say it's
[2:10:53] it's
[2:10:54] so complex and so
[2:10:57] so far-reaching
[2:10:59] so here we see jesus and and you know
[2:11:02] i'm not going to get into the retina and
[2:11:04] all of these things but there's a
[2:11:05] portion of the eye
[2:11:07] that that can see and so here jesus he
[2:11:10] he can see things
[2:11:12] but to bring a recognition or an
[2:11:14] understanding and the brain signals back
[2:11:17] so here he sees things and jesus says
[2:11:19] what do you see i see men as trees
[2:11:22] walking and after that he put his hands
[2:11:26] upon his again on his eyes and he made
[2:11:29] him look up and he was restored and he
[2:11:32] saw every man clearly so i i want to
[2:11:35] bring this just as an analogy any and
[2:11:39] you can look at something but you can't
[2:11:41] always understand it
[2:11:43] you can look and say yeah i see that but
[2:11:45] you can't see the intent of what that is
[2:11:48] to bring to your heart to your mind to
[2:11:50] your brain that that that takes a work
[2:11:53] of god
[2:11:54] and and to really make it real
[2:11:58] as i shared this
[2:12:00] little little quotation
[2:12:02] about brother branham speaking about the
[2:12:04] berlin wall
[2:12:05] my eyes saw the berlin wall the world
[2:12:08] saw that but when
[2:12:10] when my heart saw its place in the
[2:12:12] scripture i said yes lord that's you
[2:12:15] and and so there's there's things that
[2:12:17] god controls in our seeing that have to
[2:12:20] be made real to us that we ourselves
[2:12:23] don't see naturally it's a work of god
[2:12:25] it's not a work of of any physician or
[2:12:28] any eye but it's something god is doing
[2:12:30] and i i've just i've just marveled on on
[2:12:33] how god does things
[2:12:36] i i
[2:12:37] i may be going all over the place here
[2:12:40] if you look
[2:12:42] as god leads us up to something
[2:12:45] he points us to something he points us
[2:12:47] to something he points us to something
[2:12:50] but as we
[2:12:51] step into the vision or we walk in the
[2:12:54] vision
[2:12:55] now we're we're seeing it in real life
[2:12:58] and and i'll use these examples if you
[2:13:01] take
[2:13:02] the word atonement it's it's in the
[2:13:04] bible 70 times
[2:13:07] 69 times in the old testament
[2:13:10] so the old testament is projecting the
[2:13:13] atonement but the new testament is the
[2:13:15] atonement so now you're
[2:13:18] you're you're looking for an atonement
[2:13:20] not the blood of bulls and ghosts but
[2:13:21] now it's christ our atonement and you're
[2:13:24] walking in the atonement so you're not
[2:13:26] looking to the atonement anywhere but
[2:13:28] you're walking in it and you see clearly
[2:13:31] all the benefits around you
[2:13:34] you can go in the bible and you can take
[2:13:36] other places and and you can look at all
[2:13:38] the gospels
[2:13:40] and you'll find the word faith in
[2:13:42] matthew in mark and in luke but you will
[2:13:45] not find the word faith in the book of
[2:13:47] john
[2:13:49] so
[2:13:50] matthew and mark they're they're saying
[2:13:52] you've got to have faith you've got to
[2:13:52] do these things but john because the
[2:13:54] bible says faith worketh by love
[2:13:58] not not by by do's and don'ts and fear
[2:14:01] and forcing but by love now john was
[2:14:04] walking in faith he was living something
[2:14:06] out that the others never saw
[2:14:09] and we in this age are are walking out
[2:14:12] and living things that past ages never
[2:14:14] saw
[2:14:16] and even within the framework of the
[2:14:17] message we we would see things that
[2:14:20] you know we'd seen them afar off but now
[2:14:22] they're here
[2:14:23] and and i i just i just i can't help it
[2:14:26] and i wish i can explain this better but
[2:14:29] you know i used to look at a certain
[2:14:30] brother a certain way and i always
[2:14:32] thought he's always got that limp
[2:14:35] and he always claps his hands that way
[2:14:37] and he has this mannerism where he does
[2:14:39] this
[2:14:40] but over time
[2:14:43] over time you
[2:14:44] you kind of see
[2:14:45] that's just the outside
[2:14:48] this is the inside
[2:14:50] i actually have to do that right in my
[2:14:51] own home
[2:14:53] with my wife because she's got her ways
[2:14:55] about her
[2:14:56] i you know
[2:14:57] you she might find a couple of things
[2:14:59] about me but i don't know what they
[2:15:00] might be but
[2:15:02] if you go in our home
[2:15:04] and the male arrives
[2:15:06] and you you look at you know who opened
[2:15:09] the mail by the way it's open
[2:15:11] because i go over to the drawer
[2:15:13] i pull out a knife
[2:15:15] cut it off
[2:15:16] pull it out ah okay
[2:15:19] when she gets the mail
[2:15:20] rips the letter to shreds the envelope
[2:15:23] to shreds pulls it out ha ha
[2:15:25] i've got it that coupon
[2:15:27] for that fabric or whatever it is but
[2:15:30] but but you know so so she has her ways
[2:15:32] about her right
[2:15:34] but there was a way
[2:15:36] in the book of genesis
[2:15:38] that was hid to man
[2:15:40] and the bible says the cherubims blocked
[2:15:43] in the book of genesis they blocked
[2:15:45] the way of the tree of life
[2:15:48] so
[2:15:48] who that tree of life was that was
[2:15:50] christ
[2:15:51] that way began to be dark and obscure to
[2:15:55] man and and for for two thousand or four
[2:15:59] thousand years of history they they
[2:16:01] never could come to see what that way is
[2:16:04] because there's an anointing that
[2:16:05] wouldn't allow them to see it
[2:16:08] but now when christ came our atonement
[2:16:11] when he came he was the tree of life
[2:16:15] there was there was a covering they had
[2:16:16] a veil over the temple he was veiled in
[2:16:19] his flesh but but
[2:16:21] those with the seed gene and god of god
[2:16:24] in him they could see
[2:16:26] behind the veil they could see the
[2:16:28] nature of god the heart of god they
[2:16:31] weren't just looking at the peripheral
[2:16:33] yes that was him but behind the veil
[2:16:36] there was christ there was the nature of
[2:16:39] god
[2:16:40] that's why i think it's so important to
[2:16:41] listen to tapes when you listen to tapes
[2:16:43] you're not just
[2:16:45] picking quotes and this is this and this
[2:16:47] and this is but you begin to catch the
[2:16:49] nature of the spirit of god as it's
[2:16:52] working through the prophet and as you
[2:16:54] catch that nature you're actually
[2:16:56] becoming a partaker of that nature
[2:16:58] you're catching and seeing things that
[2:17:00] your intellect isn't seeing you're
[2:17:02] you're seeing a part of god no this is
[2:17:05] not how god works this is not what he
[2:17:07] desires
[2:17:09] we so often take our own nature and we
[2:17:13] want to apply it to the word that way
[2:17:16] but god wants us to take his nature and
[2:17:19] his spirit and he wants us to be an
[2:17:22] embodiment
[2:17:23] he wants to express himself and his
[2:17:26] nature through us
[2:17:30] i
[2:17:32] i i i try to bring the human part not
[2:17:35] that it's bad because like i said we all
[2:17:38] have our ways there's parts
[2:17:40] of myself that if i really consider
[2:17:43] i don't like
[2:17:45] parts of myself
[2:17:47] and how they are when i really examine
[2:17:49] it in the light of god
[2:17:51] but god allowed that to be there but i
[2:17:53] say lord
[2:17:54] you made me this way channel it and use
[2:17:57] it but let that inner man
[2:18:00] be governed by you
[2:18:02] and and when we begin to now walk in
[2:18:05] those things and you know i gave an
[2:18:07] example in the bible let me give you one
[2:18:08] in the message
[2:18:11] brother branham
[2:18:13] if you type in boaz
[2:18:15] you'll find it 73 times
[2:18:18] in the message
[2:18:20] 67 of those times are prior
[2:18:23] to 1963.
[2:18:25] during the seals he mentions boaz just a
[2:18:28] few times
[2:18:29] and then only once in 64 and once in 65
[2:18:32] and i'm just taking the type so there's
[2:18:34] a part of our seeing
[2:18:36] that even the prophet as he's walking in
[2:18:38] he's pointing to boaz he's our redeemer
[2:18:41] you know i i won't get into the whole
[2:18:43] story of ruth but you know there was
[2:18:45] ruth she had four different stages there
[2:18:48] was a time when she identified herself
[2:18:51] as just a moabite then there was a time
[2:18:53] when she identified herself as a gleaner
[2:18:55] then there was a time when she
[2:18:57] identified herself as a kinswoman
[2:18:59] and she began and then she took the
[2:19:01] final step where she says i i'm the one
[2:19:04] that's here for you i'm a part of you
[2:19:06] and and so these were steps she had to
[2:19:09] come to she had to leave behind the
[2:19:11] moabite she had to leave the gleaner
[2:19:14] behind to take on the next step
[2:19:16] and so the message itself
[2:19:18] you know
[2:19:19] it's bringing us to our boaz which is
[2:19:22] christ the all in all he's the one in us
[2:19:25] among us he's through every gift he's
[2:19:27] through every ministry it's him through
[2:19:30] the body that's the one we want to see
[2:19:33] and it's boaz he's our all in all now
[2:19:35] we're not just walking and pointing to
[2:19:37] boaz but boaz is here boaz ought to
[2:19:41] govern us he ought to be a part of us
[2:19:43] so we're not just looking at something
[2:19:45] far off anymore but it's among us
[2:19:48] [Music]
[2:19:50] that's the one that we look to i believe
[2:19:52] there's a part
[2:19:54] where the message not to be a partial
[2:19:56] realization
[2:19:57] but a full realization
[2:20:00] amen and and god is such a gentleman
[2:20:03] he's not gonna you know there's a part
[2:20:05] in the seals brotherhood says if satan
[2:20:07] could get a hold of this
[2:20:09] he would do great damage
[2:20:11] god only unfolds it to his bride
[2:20:14] he only whispers his love secrets
[2:20:17] to her
[2:20:18] so what do we want to see we're looking
[2:20:21] and seeing ourselves now
[2:20:24] how are we doing for time there's no
[2:20:25] clock
[2:20:26] oh my my clock here says
[2:20:29] 5 30
[2:20:34] and the service started at
[2:20:36] at 7. that's strange
[2:20:39] my what have you
[2:20:40] [Laughter]
[2:20:41] your pull
[2:20:43] is pushing the clock back
[2:20:45] [Laughter]
[2:20:50] no we won't do that we're gonna
[2:20:52] we're gonna do this
[2:20:56] brother branham would talk about
[2:20:59] the book
[2:21:01] and
[2:21:03] he would call it
[2:21:08] the book of life and then the lamb's
[2:21:10] book of life and i'm i won't go into
[2:21:12] detail on this
[2:21:15] but let me just say this there's a book
[2:21:18] now
[2:21:20] what you and i never saw when we had the
[2:21:22] call
[2:21:23] we didn't know the depth of the call
[2:21:27] we didn't know
[2:21:29] what god had purposed with the call
[2:21:32] but god has a a reason and a purpose now
[2:21:37] in in questions and answers on the seals
[2:21:39] he said
[2:21:40] only those whose names are on the lam's
[2:21:42] book of life
[2:21:44] will be saved the book holds the mystery
[2:21:47] the book is unfolding it now
[2:21:50] not each one's name
[2:21:53] but what the mystery of the book is
[2:21:55] while it's calling those names
[2:21:58] so it doesn't say lee vale will be saved
[2:22:01] in this
[2:22:01] church age or arm and neville no
[2:22:04] it doesn't it just shows the mystery or
[2:22:06] unfolds the mystery
[2:22:08] and there's something in our receiving
[2:22:10] set
[2:22:11] yeah this is this is this is what i've
[2:22:13] always longed for this is what i've
[2:22:14] looked for this is who i am and then
[2:22:16] it's not just i remember as god was
[2:22:18] calling me and we had this large
[2:22:20] pentecostal church in in the city and
[2:22:22] and just it was like it was coming on
[2:22:24] christmas time and they have christmas
[2:22:26] carols and you'd come around and they
[2:22:28] had this what they called the singing
[2:22:30] christmas tree and it was made up of
[2:22:31] singers like 20 rows deep up into this
[2:22:34] tree and i go this is kind of nice
[2:22:37] but you know the seed in me wouldn't
[2:22:38] stop there
[2:22:39] the seed went a little bit further
[2:22:42] the seed had to go to its fullness and
[2:22:44] and and i i'm just saying right now
[2:22:46] we're coming to a time where even
[2:22:49] even god has it so orchestrated
[2:22:52] that
[2:22:53] he'll stop world events for one seed
[2:22:56] now you i won't have time but you go to
[2:22:58] revelations chapter 7 and it says here's
[2:23:00] the angels and he told them hold back
[2:23:03] the winds hold back the winds he says
[2:23:06] you can't bring that persecution until
[2:23:10] all my elect are sealed
[2:23:13] now now brother branham he goes a little
[2:23:14] further and he talks it and he says
[2:23:17] we don't know right now where this
[2:23:19] revival is going on or it's not going on
[2:23:22] we don't see enthusiasm but maybe it's
[2:23:25] like this he says
[2:23:27] maybe there's a little boy or a little
[2:23:29] girl born in seattle washington the book
[2:23:32] holds their name he came to redeem those
[2:23:34] whose name was on the book and then the
[2:23:37] human race she fell she can't accept it
[2:23:40] now she's too young now one seed
[2:23:44] and he says so the church uses these
[2:23:46] words we'll slug right along
[2:23:50] play
[2:23:51] right along or play along have meetings
[2:23:54] and so forth until the last person is
[2:23:56] brought in
[2:23:57] then the book is closed there's no more
[2:24:00] added it's all over then
[2:24:03] now we don't know what that time what
[2:24:06] that hour is so look at the principle of
[2:24:08] god he's interested in his seed
[2:24:11] there there is so much going on right
[2:24:14] now
[2:24:15] in
[2:24:16] in the time we live in
[2:24:18] and i i came to this
[2:24:20] quotation and i hope i put it in i hear
[2:24:22] this
[2:24:24] and you know it's amazing how
[2:24:26] we went from
[2:24:28] all the attention being on kovid
[2:24:31] to being on the trucking industry in
[2:24:33] ottawa
[2:24:34] to being on
[2:24:36] a war
[2:24:37] with russia
[2:24:39] ukraine and russia
[2:24:41] and
[2:24:42] people you know you go into a coffee
[2:24:43] shop
[2:24:44] russia and russia and it's like it's
[2:24:47] it's written and so we ourselves look
[2:24:49] you know there's quotations when russia
[2:24:51] comes down for the oil and all of these
[2:24:52] things and
[2:24:54] and i came across this and will the
[2:24:55] church go through the tribulation
[2:24:58] and he says
[2:24:59] before one speck of fire
[2:25:02] could fall from heaven
[2:25:04] lot had to go out of sodom
[2:25:06] now if you read that story it was
[2:25:08] abraham who was interceding for lot in
[2:25:11] sodom
[2:25:12] and he negotiated from 50 to 45 to 30
[2:25:15] down down to 25 to 10 and he negotiated
[2:25:18] if there's five and the angel left off
[2:25:21] now you'd think did abraham get his
[2:25:23] negotiation you don't know but the next
[2:25:25] thing is the angels are literally
[2:25:27] pulling lot out of sodom
[2:25:31] and saying we can't do anything until
[2:25:34] you come out why because there's a
[2:25:36] prayer of a seed of god called abraham
[2:25:39] interceding for that man
[2:25:42] now we're no different today our prayers
[2:25:45] i believe our prayers we've seen our
[2:25:47] prayer meetings at home we've seen them
[2:25:49] change situations
[2:25:51] we've seen them change things in our own
[2:25:53] families we've seen things happen and we
[2:25:56] know it's just god but it's not not us
[2:25:59] in it but it's god using these vessels
[2:26:01] and he's changing things so it's not the
[2:26:04] way the wheels around us the great
[2:26:06] movements that we're just being tossed
[2:26:08] to and fro no we're in the center of
[2:26:09] this whole thing
[2:26:12] so he says this
[2:26:14] before the atom bomb can strike this
[2:26:16] nation the church will go in the rapture
[2:26:19] to meet the lord jesus
[2:26:21] i'll tell you what i rest in that
[2:26:23] there's not going to be one thing happen
[2:26:25] until i'm gone
[2:26:26] and i stand on that
[2:26:28] no matter how wild the dictators look
[2:26:30] and no matter what they do
[2:26:33] and brother branham would he listen to
[2:26:34] this picture he paints two sides to it
[2:26:36] he says
[2:26:37] there he says if the sputniks now that's
[2:26:40] not part of the american space program
[2:26:42] just you know that
[2:26:43] if the sputniks and the missiles are set
[2:26:46] and the hammers are pulled back
[2:26:48] he says now that's on earth but he says
[2:26:50] the angels are standing in order
[2:26:52] hallelujah the great quarters of heaven
[2:26:55] is crowded full the harps are in tune
[2:26:57] the great bands are practiced up there's
[2:27:00] a homecoming time pretty soon for the
[2:27:02] church of the living god that's been
[2:27:04] waiting for his coming he said
[2:27:06] everything's in order oh i'm so glad i'm
[2:27:08] so tired oh for that great hour and to
[2:27:12] think we have a part in this junction
[2:27:15] time he says remember so shall it be in
[2:27:18] the coming of the son of man when the
[2:27:20] son of man is revealed from heaven
[2:27:22] before the rain fell noah was in the ark
[2:27:25] before the fire fell lot was out of
[2:27:26] sodom for the angel said you i can't do
[2:27:29] nothing until you come hither and now
[2:27:31] listen the same angel says i g to think
[2:27:33] he says
[2:27:34] i've got my hand on a lever in my hand
[2:27:37] to pull and make fires fall from heaven
[2:27:41] and i think that's it exactly he says
[2:27:44] the angel of destruction is holding the
[2:27:48] hand of russia
[2:27:49] with the atomic bombs until the church
[2:27:53] comes together as one great body of
[2:27:56] christ i can't do nothing till you come
[2:27:59] hither who's holding it back the church
[2:28:02] that is here the seed of god that is
[2:28:04] here we've got to come together in one
[2:28:07] mind in one body in one heart it's
[2:28:10] christ the all in all
[2:28:13] yes sir
[2:28:15] he said here's that same angel oh if
[2:28:18] that isn't a blessed assurance
[2:28:20] we see everything set in order the going
[2:28:22] of the home the church of going home of
[2:28:24] the church is in order
[2:28:27] you know if we were to
[2:28:29] come in this church before we were saved
[2:28:32] i'll tell you what we wouldn't have
[2:28:32] hardly sat through the song service
[2:28:35] there would have been swearing or
[2:28:36] cussing there would have been all kinds
[2:28:38] of thoughts and
[2:28:39] things but what what what's brought us
[2:28:41] together to sit still
[2:28:43] all this time there's a common spirit
[2:28:45] it's growing
[2:28:47] it's coming together
[2:28:49] you know
[2:28:50] if we could see
[2:28:52] if we could see that the christ in us
[2:28:56] you know i i just see things happening
[2:28:59] that
[2:29:02] even even coming here brother jonathan
[2:29:04] the airlines are going to charge me like
[2:29:06] 500 bucks more ticket i go lord
[2:29:08] you can't do this like we had to change
[2:29:10] our ticket
[2:29:11] and i just said how am i and i went back
[2:29:13] later that night
[2:29:14] waiting on on hold i said i'll just try
[2:29:16] the computer one more time
[2:29:18] i go in it's all like zeroes it's all
[2:29:20] cleared
[2:29:20] off oh thank the lord
[2:29:23] and i thought oh
[2:29:24] i'm sorry it had to be that way if it
[2:29:26] wasn't that way i had little things at
[2:29:28] home
[2:29:29] that all of a sudden came up we had a
[2:29:31] brother pass away at the last minute if
[2:29:33] we wouldn't have been home i wouldn't
[2:29:35] have been there for that
[2:29:36] our church is having the funeral for
[2:29:38] sister laura collins tomorrow
[2:29:40] i i has helped the brothers arrange and
[2:29:42] do things
[2:29:43] and i think god you've got it so in
[2:29:45] order it's just so designed you know
[2:29:48] like everything's connected
[2:29:51] let me just share another testimony
[2:29:52] you've got just a few more minutes i'm
[2:29:54] not going to be much longer
[2:29:57] my wife and my daughter many years ago
[2:29:59] went to
[2:30:01] book tickets to go to the louisiana
[2:30:04] camp meetings
[2:30:06] and uh
[2:30:08] so you know we we were just busy i was
[2:30:11] going to stay home with the boys the
[2:30:13] boys were going to stay at grandma's
[2:30:14] house because dad doesn't cook very good
[2:30:16] breakfast so so they were going to do
[2:30:18] that but my wife was going with my
[2:30:20] daughter so she's flying from edmonton
[2:30:22] to calgary
[2:30:24] all the way to houston they're going to
[2:30:25] rent a car drive to louisiana it's
[2:30:28] another three hours or whatever three
[2:30:29] and a half hours and be part of the
[2:30:31] spring camp
[2:30:32] so anyway i dropped her off at the
[2:30:34] airport always leaving at 5 a.m in the
[2:30:36] morning or something like that so
[2:30:37] brother jonathan that's why these things
[2:30:39] happen but it would anyway
[2:30:41] left dropped her off we're going they
[2:30:43] landed in calgary and everything's good
[2:30:45] we're doing fine okay great good good
[2:30:47] good
[2:30:48] get a call a few hours later we're in
[2:30:49] houston everything is wrong so what's
[2:30:52] wrong do you lose your vanity or
[2:30:53] something or you know is it what's wrong
[2:30:56] and she says i went to go and
[2:30:58] rent the car and i don't have my credit
[2:31:00] card we'd pre-paid it before we left
[2:31:03] but they will not allow you to take the
[2:31:05] car to take the vehicle without the card
[2:31:08] and so oh my goodness i said well let me
[2:31:10] talk to them you know and i said can we
[2:31:12] pay here and you can accept it there no
[2:31:14] you can't do that we i was on the phone
[2:31:16] negotiating this is on a wednesday you
[2:31:18] know i've got to prepare for church that
[2:31:20] night and you know we're going my
[2:31:21] daughter's in tears because she wanted
[2:31:23] to stop shopping somewhere and she
[2:31:24] couldn't do it now and all kinds of
[2:31:26] things happening and you know how
[2:31:28] traumatic these things are anyway we're
[2:31:30] just like and i'm going there's got to
[2:31:32] be a way and then she she said okay
[2:31:34] we're going to try that we have a sears
[2:31:35] card so sure enough they took sears okay
[2:31:38] great they ran through and said oh this
[2:31:39] is sears canada no we don't take that
[2:31:41] here oh great i thought well maybe i'll
[2:31:44] i'll
[2:31:45] i'll fly a card down or you know we'll
[2:31:47] do something he says sir if it's if it's
[2:31:49] a legitimate card you can't fly it down
[2:31:51] you you
[2:31:52] you can't you can't have an active
[2:31:53] credit card in the mail system like oh
[2:31:55] my goodness i didn't know these rules
[2:31:57] we're just sitting there i'm thinking
[2:31:58] who do we know that would be there and
[2:32:01] we knew some believers but they were in
[2:32:02] other areas it was too far away
[2:32:04] and then i said well maybe you can ask
[2:32:06] someone or something
[2:32:08] and so my wife is there and my
[2:32:10] daughter's in tears and they they're
[2:32:12] everything they can't get the car rental
[2:32:14] and and and she sees a lady coming so
[2:32:16] she hangs up you know i says i gotta
[2:32:18] so she talked to this lady and this lady
[2:32:20] goes i'm not helping you out no way and
[2:32:22] and then another person walked by and
[2:32:24] then this guy comes by and he explains
[2:32:26] the predicament and he says
[2:32:28] i'll help you just wait a minute
[2:32:31] and uh
[2:32:32] so
[2:32:32] he he goes away and he comes back and
[2:32:34] sandy calls me this man's gonna help me
[2:32:36] he's he's such and such and and and okay
[2:32:40] so they went he came over my wife had
[2:32:42] cash with her says i'll pay you the cash
[2:32:45] for the car
[2:32:47] card and he's just gonna put his credit
[2:32:49] card down now
[2:32:50] hey she could have taken that car and
[2:32:53] gone across north america with it
[2:32:56] but he had to trust her so he comes up
[2:32:58] and she'd been to all the car agents and
[2:33:00] they all knew and they and so this man
[2:33:03] put his car down the car the lady at
[2:33:04] this desk says sir do you know what
[2:33:07] you're doing
[2:33:08] he says yeah i know what i'm doing
[2:33:10] this is a stranger in houston american
[2:33:13] city
[2:33:14] and my wife is there and
[2:33:16] he puts it down she gives him the cash
[2:33:18] it's on his card now the caveat is he
[2:33:21] has to go with her to the car
[2:33:24] drive it out and then she can take it so
[2:33:26] she goes down they're in the lot
[2:33:28] my wife and my daughter and all of a
[2:33:30] sudden my wife realizes
[2:33:32] this guy is six foot four 220 pounds
[2:33:35] and
[2:33:35] and he's in the car and i'm in the car
[2:33:38] with this guy oh no
[2:33:40] so my wife says do you mind if i just
[2:33:42] pray
[2:33:44] he says sure
[2:33:46] she prays and she says thank you for
[2:33:48] this man thank you for all these things
[2:33:49] and
[2:33:50] and he he bowed he was
[2:33:52] they drove out
[2:33:54] he gave her the car
[2:33:55] there's a whole part to this story i'm
[2:33:57] not going to tell you you can ask my
[2:33:58] wife about but there was like
[2:34:00] it was it was a thing anyway
[2:34:03] i talked to this guy and i said sir
[2:34:05] thank you for what you're doing
[2:34:07] if there's anything and he says no i'll
[2:34:09] take your number
[2:34:10] etc etc
[2:34:12] my wife gets in the car they drive they
[2:34:14] make it to louisiana with some incidents
[2:34:16] along the way but they made it there
[2:34:19] and then as as my wife is driving she's
[2:34:22] talking to me says
[2:34:23] that was like an angel like how big was
[2:34:25] the angel of the lord
[2:34:28] and i'm thinking about it so now it's
[2:34:30] like 5 30. i got to get ready for
[2:34:31] service and leave for church in an hour
[2:34:33] i didn't have anything ready i i just
[2:34:36] went to church and i i preached on
[2:34:38] stepping out in faith
[2:34:40] so out of this little incident i preach
[2:34:42] on stepping out in faith there was three
[2:34:44] brothers one had lost his job that way
[2:34:46] one had a marital situation one had
[2:34:48] another god so moved in the service they
[2:34:51] all said i'm stepping out in faith
[2:34:54] and they went home and situations
[2:34:55] changed in the meantime my wife gets
[2:34:57] there and and and then i get a call the
[2:35:00] next day it's coming up to easter and i
[2:35:02] get a voice message from this man did
[2:35:03] your wife make it okay is everything all
[2:35:06] right
[2:35:07] and and i said yeah she made it i can't
[2:35:08] thank you enough for what you did he
[2:35:10] says well when you get the final receipt
[2:35:12] let me know and if i owe you money i'll
[2:35:14] pay you and he says no and he said have
[2:35:16] a blessed day
[2:35:17] this is not a message believer this is
[2:35:19] not we don't know this guy from anybody
[2:35:22] the meetings were over my wife came back
[2:35:23] we got the bill she had overpaid him
[2:35:26] thirty dollars we sent him a note back
[2:35:27] and said listen we overpaid you thirty
[2:35:29] dollars but you keep it we don't need it
[2:35:31] thank you for all your help we can't
[2:35:33] thank you enough he says no i'll have
[2:35:35] none of it
[2:35:36] ten days later i get a letter in the
[2:35:38] mail
[2:35:39] with 30 dollars
[2:35:41] and he says
[2:35:42] i wouldn't have given this to you but i
[2:35:44] want you to know my story
[2:35:46] i'm a single parent
[2:35:49] i have three daughters
[2:35:51] one day they might need help
[2:35:54] i was able to help your wife
[2:35:57] maybe god will look down and help my
[2:35:59] children in their need
[2:36:02] friends that doesn't happen
[2:36:04] that doesn't happen
[2:36:07] but god is greater than all things
[2:36:12] we've prayed many times for that man
[2:36:15] said lord wherever he is and wherever
[2:36:17] his daughters are
[2:36:18] you watch over them
[2:36:20] maybe he's never a message believer
[2:36:23] maybe he's never but maybe on the day of
[2:36:25] judgment when everybody is down here and
[2:36:28] and and christ is up here and his bride
[2:36:31] is behind them maybe that man comes up
[2:36:33] one day and as he comes up one day and
[2:36:36] he says i'm so and so and he says what
[2:36:38] did you do and i did this i don't know
[2:36:39] if he's denominational i don't know if
[2:36:41] he's a trinitarian or whatever it is but
[2:36:43] he says okay and i'm going to pronounce
[2:36:45] judgment and he turns to his bride do
[2:36:46] you have anything to say my wife and i
[2:36:48] will stand up and say this man helped us
[2:36:51] in a time that we had need and jesus
[2:36:54] will turn to him and say you come on in
[2:36:57] friends that's how big our god is it's
[2:37:00] not us it's him in us he is all in all
[2:37:03] he's greater than everything
[2:37:05] [Music]
[2:37:07] i believe that if we can see it you know
[2:37:09] we preach a god we make him so
[2:37:11] narrow-minded we put him in a box he's a
[2:37:13] god of judgment if they don't see the
[2:37:15] message we've narrowed it down if they
[2:37:16] don't see it my way well they're not
[2:37:18] even in listen god is bigger than all of
[2:37:20] that
[2:37:21] god is a good god he's on your side he
[2:37:24] doesn't want anybody to perish
[2:37:26] he wants you to live blessed he wants
[2:37:28] you to be an overcomer
[2:37:30] we're passing through time but we make
[2:37:33] decisions that are eternal
[2:37:36] that have lasting implications for
[2:37:38] eternity they're not just to hear a
[2:37:40] little thing oh can i get a better job
[2:37:42] and can i have this and this that's part
[2:37:44] of it yes
[2:37:45] but i think we ought to live for more
[2:37:48] listen i'm i'm going to leave it with
[2:37:50] that today
[2:37:51] i've got more i'm going to take this a
[2:37:53] little further
[2:37:54] do you want to serve them more love them
[2:37:57] more
[2:37:58] do you want to
[2:37:59] be able to see as he sees let's have the
[2:38:01] musicians come
[2:38:04] i i believe we're living in a tremendous
[2:38:06] time
[2:38:07] when there's things that are happening
[2:38:10] i i i don't know about you friends but
[2:38:13] i can't see the message even the same
[2:38:15] anymore
[2:38:17] i i i i
[2:38:19] i look at people like if you're feeding
[2:38:21] on the word
[2:38:23] you know we talk about the gift of
[2:38:24] discernment the greatest discernment
[2:38:25] you'll have is by staying in the word
[2:38:28] it'll allow you to see things and
[2:38:30] and and understand and see situations
[2:38:34] friends we know him he he's the master
[2:38:37] of the wind
[2:38:38] he's our god he's with us everywhere and
[2:38:42] and i think if we can say
[2:38:44] even the people you meet in the world
[2:38:47] god brings them across our path
[2:38:48] sometimes
[2:38:49] if he brought a possum across the
[2:38:52] prophet's path
[2:38:54] you know are are we in the flesh do we
[2:38:56] suffer things do we all do we see these
[2:38:58] glories no
[2:39:00] i i marvel at how
[2:39:02] paul
[2:39:03] paul is the messenger the first
[2:39:06] messenger to the age
[2:39:07] and he's being sent to rome and as he
[2:39:10] goes to rome he's in the court of festus
[2:39:13] and festus is holding him there and as
[2:39:16] festus is holding him
[2:39:18] he holds him and he says no paul you
[2:39:20] just wait in prison you know how long he
[2:39:22] waited in prison the bible says two
[2:39:24] years
[2:39:25] the messenger to the age
[2:39:27] two years
[2:39:30] and then agrippa comes and paul comes
[2:39:32] out
[2:39:32] and he's released
[2:39:34] was that fun was that easy no it wasn't
[2:39:36] paul was in a prison we're in situations
[2:39:39] we think i don't like this i don't want
[2:39:41] this
[2:39:41] but that saint paul when he was on a
[2:39:43] journey
[2:39:45] an angel said you've got to come to rome
[2:39:47] he could look a storm in this face of
[2:39:49] his eye in the face of his face and say
[2:39:52] god promised i'm going to get to rome
[2:39:54] that's how you and i can look at russia
[2:39:56] and say
[2:39:57] the church has got to come together
[2:39:59] before that bomb will ever be released
[2:40:03] paul could a viper come on his hand he
[2:40:06] shook it off why
[2:40:08] i've got a purpose i got a destination
[2:40:10] i've got to fulfill it i'm called for a
[2:40:12] purpose
[2:40:15] you look at all the men in the bible i
[2:40:17] look at joseph joseph here's joseph he
[2:40:20] he interprets the dream surely i'll be
[2:40:22] in pharaoh's courthill they'll let me go
[2:40:24] they'll do this and he sits for two more
[2:40:26] years waiting
[2:40:28] joseph a type of christ
[2:40:30] here we sit waiting
[2:40:32] waiting
[2:40:33] the hour's coming
[2:40:34] the hour's coming
[2:40:36] you know i i marvel at brother branham
[2:40:38] you know the things he's sitting in in
[2:40:40] meetings and he's sitting he's sitting
[2:40:43] there and there's men behind him could
[2:40:44] you imagine the spiritual things they're
[2:40:46] hating what he's saying
[2:40:48] and yet he's just standing there
[2:40:51] one of the greatest messages the rapture
[2:40:53] and then things that are to be the
[2:40:55] rapture is held in a conference room and
[2:40:57] you hear him in the last 25 30 minutes

[2:50:37] product
[2:50:38] of a faith and the faith is a product of
[2:50:41] a seeing and
[2:50:42] the seeing is a product of a seed gene
[2:50:46] lord
[2:50:47] as we've just come to this part of the
[2:50:49] service as we're bowed together
[2:50:52] father we just come before you

[2:52:22] blessing be upon your people may it

[2:52:35] nothing can happen and lord because we
[2:52:37] have
[2:52:38] lord as the bible would say
[2:52:41] by my prophets
[2:52:43] lord by the things they declare
