[1:06:08] rafael david edward coffey amen well

[1:06:20] amen so we pray the grace of god to

[1:06:24] and to bless the child
[1:06:26] as we get into the dedication
[1:06:28] amen
[1:06:30] so in the book of luke chapter 2 and
[1:06:33] beginning to read at verse 21
[1:06:37] and when eight days were accomplished
[1:06:39] for the circumcising of the child
[1:06:42] his name was called jesus
[1:06:45] which was so named of the angel before
[1:06:48] he was conceived in the womb

[1:07:08] other children that we don't know but
[1:07:10] god knows yes amen and god's waiting on
[1:07:12] this one waiting on that one that's a
[1:07:14] problem god mentioned when he was
[1:07:16] preaching in florida concerning the end
[1:07:19] of
[1:07:19] everything and the coming of the lord
[1:07:21] always said maybe he said well this
[1:07:24] coming to receive christ and be borned
[1:07:26] again

[1:07:29] somewhere in in a church or somewhere
[1:07:31] she came to receive the lord was born
[1:07:33] again and he said maybe he said that's
[1:07:35] that's
[1:07:36] that's the next is the coming of the
[1:07:38] lord maybe he was waiting on her

[1:09:50] and there's no old man that has not
[1:09:52] fulfilled his days
[1:09:54] thank god

[1:10:02] get out of this nature into the
[1:10:06] heavenly nature

[1:10:18] another one there'll be another one well
[1:10:20] again we just wait and see maybe
[1:10:23] maybe
[1:10:25] uh rafael maybe this is going to be the
[1:10:28] last
[1:10:29] next could be the coming of the lord the
[1:10:31] next could be the resurrection
[1:10:32] next could be the rapture
[1:10:34] look up
[1:10:36] because our redemption draweth not
[1:10:39] brother
[1:10:40] look up because our redemption is here
[1:10:43] you could save back 2000 years ago oh
[1:10:46] look look here
[1:10:48] why else he said i am the resurrection
[1:10:50] of the light he was our redemption he
[1:10:52] was going to lay down his life and pick
[1:10:54] it up again
[1:10:55] amen well that's what the disciples
[1:10:57] didn't understand
[1:10:59] well they're going to kill you no stay
[1:11:01] away from jerusalem well brother
[1:11:03] we as he died we die
[1:11:05] as he laid down his life and picked it
[1:11:07] up again to a glorified body we're going
[1:11:09] to lay down our lives amen believing for
[1:11:12] a glorified body
[1:11:14] like his glorious body
[1:11:16] praise the name of the lord oh brother
[1:11:19] what faith do you have
[1:11:21] brother got to go beyond the faith oh
[1:11:23] god sent a prophet god did this and the
[1:11:26] seals were open and this was open that
[1:11:28] yes but why did god do that
[1:11:31] and is it the purpose that he had is he
[1:11:34] accomplishing that in you
[1:11:36] amen is he accomplishing that in me
[1:11:39] oh god had a reason for it yes oh well
[1:11:42] it was just prophecy being fulfilled god
[1:11:44] said he would do this he would do that
[1:11:45] yes but it was ordained to give us
[1:11:48] resurrection and rapturing faith
[1:11:51] amen the prophets
[1:11:53] highlighted that to us and he got to the
[1:11:55] place where he just left it and he said
[1:11:57] i'm going to move on you know and just
[1:11:59] not long after that god called the
[1:12:00] prophet home amen why because god had
[1:12:03] already through the ministry had done
[1:12:05] what he wanted to do and what we needed
[1:12:09] to give us the faith
[1:12:11] in this hour
[1:12:12] amen our brother highlighted it again
[1:12:15] concerning it went into total darkness
[1:12:17] but the proud of god did put that little
[1:12:19] bit of light there
[1:12:20] before to represent the bright age
[1:12:23] amen that's the truth
[1:12:26] because there's going to be a generation
[1:12:28] not very many but it's going to be a
[1:12:29] generation that's good that's ordained
[1:12:31] predestinated in this hour to receive
[1:12:34] the word and receive the faith that's in
[1:12:36] the word which is resurrection and
[1:12:38] rapture
[1:12:39] amen the faith that all the others end
[1:12:42] they just moved on moved on moved on
[1:12:44] moved on moved on until we're coming
[1:12:46] into the faith of divine love
[1:12:49] divine not just love divine love
[1:12:52] and as our brother was bringing out
[1:12:53] concerning love in the ministry remember
[1:12:55] again there's
[1:12:57] there's a filio love and there's an
[1:12:58] agape law
[1:13:00] there's a human law but there's a divine
[1:13:02] love
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:04] so brother i trust we got the anointing
[1:13:06] and the baptism of divine love
[1:13:09] by the grace of god
[1:13:11] oh you can be kind you can be nice you
[1:13:13] can be this but brother you've got to
[1:13:15] have more than that like jesus brother
[1:13:18] what caused jesus to lay down his life
[1:13:21] amen divine love
[1:13:23] praise the lord and that's why he was
[1:13:25] challenging peter love us thou me more
[1:13:28] than these
[1:13:30] and brother he said that he said this he
[1:13:32] said this he said this and he and he and
[1:13:34] he referenced the human law
[1:13:37] and that's what he's used but then he
[1:13:38] referenced divine love amen he was
[1:13:41] challenging peter's faith
[1:13:43] amen because peter was right there of
[1:13:46] all the other disciples we as i said
[1:13:48] it was we don't there was none that
[1:13:50] jesus had any trouble with any problems
[1:13:52] with just peter
[1:13:54] because peter was constantly challenging
[1:13:56] his faith
[1:13:58] what he did what he did and peter was
[1:14:00] saying no don't do this don't do that
[1:14:01] don't go to jerusalem they'll kill you

[1:14:59] joseph and sister priscilla's son
[1:15:02] let's read again luke chapter
[1:15:04] 2 and verse 21 and when eight days were
[1:15:08] accomplished for the circumcising of the
[1:15:10] child his name was called jesus
[1:15:13] which was so named of the angel before
[1:15:16] he was conceived in the womb
[1:15:18] and when the days of her purification
[1:15:21] according to the law moses were
[1:15:22] accomplished they brought unto them to
[1:15:25] jerusalem
[1:15:27] to present him to the lord
[1:15:29] as it is written in the law of the lord
[1:15:32] every male that openeth the womb shall
[1:15:35] be called holy to the lord
[1:15:38] and to offer a sacrifice according to
[1:15:41] that which is said in the law of the
[1:15:43] lord a pair of turtledoves or two young
[1:15:47] pigeons
[1:15:49] and behold there was a man in jerusalem
[1:15:51] whose name was simeon
[1:15:53] and the same man was just and devout
[1:15:57] waiting for the consolation of israel
[1:16:00] and the holy ghost was upon him and it
[1:16:03] was revealed unto him by the holy ghost
[1:16:06] that he
[1:16:07] should not see death
[1:16:09] before he had seen the lord's christ
[1:16:13] amen
[1:16:14] and he came by the spirit into the
[1:16:16] temple
[1:16:17] and when the parents brought in the
[1:16:19] child jesus to do for him
[1:16:22] after the custom of the law
[1:16:24] then took e.m up in his arms and blessed
[1:16:27] god
[1:16:28] amen and said
[1:16:30] lord now
[1:16:32] let us thy servant depart in peace
[1:16:35] according to the word
[1:16:36] for mine eyes have seen thy salvation
[1:16:41] which thou has prepared
[1:16:44] before the face of all people
[1:16:47] a light to lighten the gentiles amen
[1:16:51] and the glory of thy people israel
[1:16:55] amen and in this hour god what god is
[1:16:58] doing
[1:16:59] is to encourage us into the resurrection
[1:17:01] and rapture and believing that our

[1:34:20] doing in you folks here is amazing
[1:34:23] amen so keep up the battle
[1:34:26] amen we've been treated so kind and and
[1:34:28] fed so graciously amen i'm not going to
[1:34:31] lose one pound
[1:34:34] by being here praise the lord amen
[1:34:37] without further ado let's go to the
[1:34:38] scripture that's what we've come for i
[1:34:40] want to hear what god has to say and i
[1:34:42] hope that
[1:34:43] you just relax a little bit in his
[1:34:45] presence this morning
[1:34:47] as we praise the lord by his word
[1:34:49] amen let's turn to matthew's gospel
[1:34:51] matthew chapter 12
[1:34:53] and we're going to read verse 38
[1:34:56] amen i
[1:34:57] i was praying that the lord
[1:35:01] would give us something for the meetings
[1:35:02] here and
[1:35:04] i
[1:35:05] i preached this of course at home before
[1:35:07] i came because
[1:35:09] i wanted to be sure that i could dot all
[1:35:10] the eyes and cross all the teeth
[1:35:13] and i believe it was a blessing at home
[1:35:15] but really i in my heart
[1:35:17] i believe that the lord has had this for
[1:35:18] this service
[1:35:20] and so i trust that you'll pull that way
[1:35:22] knowing that
[1:35:23] it's for us today
[1:35:25] matthew chapter 12 and we're going to
[1:35:27] start at verse 38.
[1:35:30] then certain of the scribes and of the
[1:35:33] pharisees answered
[1:35:35] saying
[1:35:36] master
[1:35:37] we would
[1:35:38] we would see a sign from
[1:35:40] thee but he answered and said unto them
[1:35:43] an evil and adulterous generation
[1:35:46] seeketh after a sign
[1:35:48] and there shall no sign be given to it
[1:35:51] but the sign
[1:35:52] of the prophet jonas
[1:35:55] for as jonas was three days
[1:35:57] and three nights in in the whale's belly
[1:36:00] so shall the son of man be three days
[1:36:04] and three nights
[1:36:05] in the heart of the earth the lord
[1:36:08] blessed the reading of his word
[1:36:10] we can have our seats this morning
[1:36:15] uh before i start i just want to
[1:36:19] just give a little illustration and and
[1:36:21] just kind of relax and
[1:36:23] and you know there was a king one time
[1:36:27] uh a king one time who uh had uh desired
[1:36:30] to
[1:36:32] to do something for his his people his
[1:36:34] the people of his land
[1:36:36] and so you know he uh he he made a big
[1:36:39] great feast and
[1:36:41] he invited those to come that were his
[1:36:43] subjects to come and
[1:36:45] be part of the great feast but one of
[1:36:48] the conditions to come and be part of
[1:36:50] the great feast was they had to bring a
[1:36:53] vessel some sort of vessel and
[1:36:55] and they had to fill it with water for
[1:36:57] the king in his in his uh around his his
[1:37:00] courtyard his palace he had a had dug a
[1:37:03] moat and he needed the the moat to be
[1:37:06] filled with water
[1:37:07] and so he uh he invited his subjects to
[1:37:10] come and he said bring a vessel and fill
[1:37:13] it with water
[1:37:14] and when you come to the to the gate i
[1:37:16] want you to take that vessel that's
[1:37:17] filled with water and i want you to pour
[1:37:20] it out into the moat and then you're
[1:37:22] welcome to come in and we're going to
[1:37:23] have a feast together
[1:37:25] and you know i kind of thought about
[1:37:27] this illustration because we were over
[1:37:28] brother joe
[1:37:29] uh fellowship with you and you had that
[1:37:31] great big mug you know
[1:37:33] how how many seen that great big mug
[1:37:36] well you know something we all got
[1:37:37] little glasses like this but brother
[1:37:39] brother joe he pulled
[1:37:41] he pulled up this great big mug and
[1:37:43] filled it you know i think you filled it
[1:37:44] with ice or something similar and and i
[1:37:47] filled the juice and he offered well
[1:37:48] anybody wants something big but he had
[1:37:50] this great big this big and you know he
[1:37:52] told me it was you know it was dangerous
[1:37:54] for driving because we put it up to
[1:37:55] drink he couldn't see
[1:37:57] anyhow it's reminding me of this this
[1:37:59] illustration that i want to share with
[1:38:01] you this morning
[1:38:02] and so everybody came to the to the
[1:38:04] feast and
[1:38:06] you know some of them uh they came with
[1:38:07] a glass such as this
[1:38:10] some others came with a with a you know
[1:38:12] a smaller little bucket others had great
[1:38:15] big barrels one fella in fact he he was
[1:38:18] so inspired he
[1:38:20] he got his his carriage he was pulled
[1:38:23] with horses and he put he put a great
[1:38:25] big barrel on it and he filled it full
[1:38:27] of water he was
[1:38:28] enthusiastic and he came to the to the
[1:38:31] king's gate and he poured it in there
[1:38:33] and he went and had a feast and
[1:38:35] everybody was feasting together and at
[1:38:37] the end of the feast the king got up and
[1:38:39] he said
[1:38:40] subjects of the land people my people he
[1:38:44] says i've asked you today to bring a
[1:38:46] vessel
[1:38:47] i've asked you to bring any type of
[1:38:48] vessel and you could choose whatever you
[1:38:50] want and i you had a job to do all you
[1:38:52] need to do is bring some water bring
[1:38:54] some effort
[1:38:55] bring something to the kingdom and pour
[1:38:58] it into my moat
[1:39:00] he says today i have something for you
[1:39:03] because of your sacrifice and whatever
[1:39:05] sacrifice that you had according to your
[1:39:08] sacrifice you shall receive
[1:39:10] and at the time he instructed his p his
[1:39:12] his great men to open the great doors
[1:39:15] that were sitting before him inside of
[1:39:17] those that great area this a big banquet
[1:39:20] area was filled with all kinds of jewels
[1:39:23] and all kinds of tapestries all can you
[1:39:26] imagine that the king has had
[1:39:28] and now he said to his subjects whatever
[1:39:30] vessel you brought
[1:39:32] you can fill
[1:39:34] and i looked at that story today and i
[1:39:36] thought to myself
[1:39:38] the lord has called us to bring a
[1:39:40] sacrifice of praise to him
[1:39:43] and whatever we have given out
[1:39:47] the lord has promised to refill
[1:39:50] so i'm saying today
[1:39:52] if you've just brought a little shot
[1:39:54] glass that's all you're going to get
[1:39:57] but if you bring that vessel that was on
[1:39:59] that cart
[1:40:01] let me tell you you get like the prophet
[1:40:02] of god said you get exactly what you
[1:40:06] expect
[1:40:08] and so this morning well which is now
[1:40:10] afternoon we are going to come with our
[1:40:12] large vessels okay we're going to come
[1:40:15] with a brother joe sized glass all right
[1:40:18] and we are going to drink of what god
[1:40:20] has for us because i believe god has in
[1:40:23] store amazing things today
[1:40:26] we read in our scriptures in our in our
[1:40:28] beginnings of our scriptures and
[1:40:31] the scribes and the pharisees were
[1:40:33] asking and
[1:40:34] they wanted to see a sign now i want you
[1:40:36] to notice that
[1:40:37] that that israel was used to seeing a
[1:40:39] sign
[1:40:40] they were used to seeing the glories of
[1:40:43] god they they had moses and they they
[1:40:45] seen the great signs that happened in
[1:40:47] egypt and they were they were told about
[1:40:49] them so asking for sign or seeing signs
[1:40:52] and miracles and wonders wasn't an odd
[1:40:54] thing so for them to say jesus we want
[1:40:57] to see a sign was not a strange thing
[1:41:00] for them to ask
[1:41:02] but jesus he speaks and he says you know
[1:41:04] something the only sign that you're
[1:41:06] going to see
[1:41:07] is the sign of the prophet jonas and we
[1:41:10] understand that that sign of that three
[1:41:12] days and three nights in the
[1:41:15] in the belly of the whale and the
[1:41:17] reflection of the three days and nights
[1:41:19] of our lord jesus was death
[1:41:22] burial
[1:41:23] and resurrection
[1:41:24] and so i want you to notice today that
[1:41:27] that the sign that is given to you and i
[1:41:30] is speaking of the resurrection
[1:41:34] of our lord jesus christ
[1:41:36] we we are looking for the coming of the
[1:41:38] lord how many this morning is looking
[1:41:40] for the coming of the lord
[1:41:42] well friends if there's going to be a
[1:41:44] coming of the lord there's going to be
[1:41:45] have to be a quickening of our lives
[1:41:48] there's going to be having a change of
[1:41:50] our bodies there's going to have
[1:41:52] something in this natural being has got
[1:41:55] to change
[1:41:56] you know when abraham and sarah they
[1:41:57] were promised a child amen they were
[1:42:00] promised a child to come and and and
[1:42:02] friends they looked forward just like we
[1:42:04] are they looked forward to the promise
[1:42:07] of god but one day friends their body
[1:42:10] began to change

[1:42:14] where sarah could receive life and
[1:42:16] express that life and one day friends
[1:42:19] there's going to be a time though we've
[1:42:20] talked about it and we've rehearsed
[1:42:22] about it there's going to be a day
[1:42:25] an actual day when the coming of the
[1:42:27] lord is upon us and are we going to be
[1:42:30] ready
[1:42:31] brother branham says in this message it
[1:42:33] is the rising of the sun he said that's
[1:42:37] what easter proved
[1:42:39] he was not only the word but he
[1:42:42] was god himself
[1:42:44] the dynamics
[1:42:46] of the word
[1:42:48] now brother branham continues speaking
[1:42:50] on the dynamics he says that's made the
[1:42:53] body of jesus christ was cold and stiff
[1:42:56] and dead in the grave
[1:42:59] shaking to life and raise again
[1:43:02] and roll away the stone he said i am he
[1:43:05] that was dead
[1:43:07] so dead till the sun said he was dead
[1:43:10] how many remembers in the scripture the
[1:43:12] sun said he was dead the moon said that
[1:43:16] he was dead the stars said that he was
[1:43:19] dead all nature
[1:43:21] said that he was dead
[1:43:25] and now the whole world has to recognize
[1:43:29] hallelujah that he is
[1:43:32] alive again
[1:43:35] one day friends every knee shall bow and
[1:43:38] every tongue shall confess that jesus
[1:43:41] christ the whole world must confess that
[1:43:44] he is alive he was not only the
[1:43:48] mechanics god's word he was the dynamics
[1:43:53] to prove it hallelujah in the message
[1:43:56] elijah brother began running against the
[1:43:58] same let me tell you something right now

[1:44:06] is living in his church hallelujah he's
[1:44:09] living in his church today and we are
[1:44:13] his representatives this morning

[1:44:19] sheets to recognize that we are the
[1:44:22] representatives of jesus christ we are
[1:44:25] the ambassadors of jesus christ when we
[1:44:28] go to our workplaces people see jesus
[1:44:31] christ inside of us hallelujah brother
[1:44:35] branham begins to say again if jesus is
[1:44:38] here
[1:44:39] look in the meetings he's pointing to
[1:44:41] the meetings around him come to the
[1:44:43] campaigns once when the anointing of the
[1:44:45] holy ghost comes if it doesn't produce
[1:44:49] the very same life of jesus christ
[1:44:53] healing
[1:44:54] knowledge foretelling saying what will
[1:44:57] what will not watch if it's not true it
[1:45:01] was
[1:45:02] jesus isn't dead
[1:45:05] now i look at the very meanings that
[1:45:07] we've been part of right now and i
[1:45:09] believe not knowing a situation at all
[1:45:12] here at the church but i do believe in
[1:45:14] my heart when we speak the word of god
[1:45:17] god begins to discern our hearts
[1:45:20] god begins to do something there's
[1:45:22] questions something we wonder about
[1:45:24] situations in our families even
[1:45:26] situations in the church and god begins
[1:45:29] to foretell he begins to tell us of his
[1:45:32] will he begins to tell us watch and see
[1:45:36] and know that i am a god that's full and
[1:45:39] alive and full of dynamic full of power
[1:45:42] i mean my word and i have quickening
[1:45:44] life inside my word hallelujah this
[1:45:48] morning watch if it isn't true what is
[1:45:51] it it's jesus isn't dead he rose from

[1:46:08] even in you to the end of the world and
[1:46:11] i love those worlds where it's not just
[1:46:13] with you but i will be in you
[1:46:18] hallelujah
[1:46:20] in our text reading this morning in
[1:46:21] verse 42 we've continued to read and it
[1:46:24] says the queen of the south shall rise
[1:46:26] up in judgment with this generation and
[1:46:30] shall condemn it for she
[1:46:32] come from the utmost part of the earth
[1:46:34] to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold
[1:46:39] i'm greater than solomon is here and
[1:46:44] then i hear the voice of the prophet
[1:46:45] speak to us in this message greater than
[1:46:48] solomon is here he says to us behold a
[1:46:51] greater than all the prophets
[1:46:55] greater than all the prophets is here
[1:46:58] because we have heard the wisdom of
[1:47:01] solomon now i want you to know us when
[1:47:03] we see we hear that those words the
[1:47:06] wisdom of solomon who gave solomon the
[1:47:08] wisdom
[1:47:10] solomon was but a boy and he was growing
[1:47:13] and he said i can't lead these people
[1:47:15] lord i can't do this by myself lord
[1:47:18] would you give me some help when the
[1:47:20] lord said yes i'll give you what would
[1:47:22] you like and he said i would like to
[1:47:24] have wisdom he didn't say i'd like to
[1:47:27] have a new chariot i'd like to have more
[1:47:30] gold i'd like to be successful he said
[1:47:32] lord i would like to have your wisdom
[1:47:36] and i believe hearing the word of god
[1:47:39] understanding by the supernatural this
[1:47:42] morning is the wisdom of god to us
[1:47:47] if you have a need this morning say lord
[1:47:49] i'd like to have your wisdom i'd like to
[1:47:52] have your knowledge i'd like to have
[1:47:55] something this morning that's from you
[1:47:57] oh that's greater that's greater than
[1:48:00] all the prophets i desire to have you
[1:48:03] lord the wisdom of god
[1:48:06] and the leaders say in church age
[1:48:07] brother adam says says now notice again
[1:48:10] how jesus overcame the world systems of
[1:48:13] religion
[1:48:14] when he was repeatedly badgered by the
[1:48:17] theologians it was in his day he
[1:48:20] constantly applied the word he spake
[1:48:25] only what the father gave him to speak i
[1:48:28] want you to notice he applied wisdom he
[1:48:32] applied his own word when satan was
[1:48:34] tempting there what did jesus do he said
[1:48:37] it is written
[1:48:39] oh you can have bread no it is written
[1:48:42] you can have all the kingdoms of the
[1:48:44] world no it is written and when satan
[1:48:47] comes against his friends this morning
[1:48:50] we need to use the wisdom of the word we
[1:48:52] need to use the wisdom that god has
[1:48:55] given and apply the word and say to
[1:48:57] satan it is written oh you've stolen my
[1:49:01] health but didn't give it back because
[1:49:03] the word of god says it is written by
[1:49:08] your stripes this morning can you raise
[1:49:10] a hand if you're sick
[1:49:12] if you're sick this morning receive it
[1:49:14] in the name of the lord by your stripes
[1:49:17] the wisdom of god i am healed apply the
[1:49:21] word in our hearts this morning
[1:49:24] hallelujah thank you lord
[1:49:26] in the message of god brother branham
[1:49:28] says
[1:49:29] you had better stay
[1:49:31] with the word
[1:49:33] the word will lead you across because
[1:49:36] the word is christ and christ is god and
[1:49:41] god is the holy ghost we need to stay
[1:49:44] with the wisdom of the word
[1:49:47] and questions and answers on genesis he
[1:49:50] says now
[1:49:51] no one has seen god
[1:49:53] and now the next thing uh be in the
[1:49:57] beginning c by natural eyes we've got to
[1:50:00] look this by not natural but
[1:50:01] supernatural eyes he says looking we see
[1:50:05] a little white light i remember brother
[1:50:07] phantom talking about this we see a
[1:50:09] little white light formula there how do
[1:50:11] we see this by supernatural eyes
[1:50:15] natural eyes cannot see this
[1:50:17] many before us
[1:50:19] heard these words and speak this on
[1:50:20] logos again they heard about it but they
[1:50:23] could not see it because they did not
[1:50:25] have the supernatural eyesight to see
[1:50:28] the wisdom of god
[1:50:31] brother branham brings it forth he says
[1:50:33] now by eyes of the supernatural looking
[1:50:36] we see a little white light forming up
[1:50:38] there what is it that was called by the
[1:50:41] bible reader's logos or anointing or the
[1:50:44] anointing he
[1:50:45] that was the word of god
[1:50:49] came forth and showed himself even in
[1:50:52] this generation it was the word of god
[1:50:55] can you hear the wisdom of god
[1:50:57] for behold friends greater than all the
[1:51:00] prophets is here
[1:51:02] now i just want to i don't want to just
[1:51:04] limit it there to 1965 when now brother
[1:51:07] branham had left to see no it's right
[1:51:09] here today
[1:51:11] i want you to claim it by faith behold
[1:51:15] greater than all the prophets is right
[1:51:18] here
[1:51:19] in this tabernacle this morning the holy
[1:51:22] spirit was here through the singing of
[1:51:24] the songs the holy spirit was even in
[1:51:27] here pointing us in a a during a baby
[1:51:31] dedication to the coming of the lord
[1:51:34] you know friends you know you think oh
[1:51:36] it's a baby dedication but friends the
[1:51:38] lord is near
[1:51:40] and we pray that raphael be that last
[1:51:43] seed
[1:51:45] hallelujah if we can't find them out
[1:51:46] there let's bring that last seed and
[1:51:49] have them come forth about our wombs and
[1:51:52] our beings today
[1:51:54] oh
[1:51:55] greater than all the prophets is here
[1:51:57] this morning
[1:51:59] i want you to notice here in our text
[1:52:01] and that it expresses it says behold
[1:52:04] behold that word behold now that word of
[1:52:07] behold and you can look at the
[1:52:09] dictionary or and you could see that and
[1:52:11] it gives the impression of see behold
[1:52:14] see or it gives another uh impression of
[1:52:18] a witness
[1:52:19] somebody that has beheld
[1:52:21] behold and i want to speak to you behold
[1:52:24] as a witness have you seen the logos of
[1:52:28] god in your midst behold as a witness
[1:52:31] has you seen the word of god the
[1:52:34] thoughts of god be manifested right here
[1:52:37] in your midst before for god is here god
[1:52:41] is right before us in our midst and i
[1:52:43] see it as we spoke at this yes last
[1:52:45] night you are the thoughts of god you
[1:52:47] are the testimony of god so i could say
[1:52:50] this morning can i get a witness
[1:52:52] oh you can do better than that this
[1:52:54] morning if i've got to do all the
[1:52:56] preaching you're going to do all the
[1:52:57] pulling do i have the witness this
[1:52:59] morning hallelujah we are witnesses now
[1:53:02] let me go to the new testament for just
[1:53:04] a moment to get the witness of the glory
[1:53:07] of god i look at john and john says it
[1:53:10] lovely he says now the word was made
[1:53:13] flesh
[1:53:14] and it dwelt among us oh and i like
[1:53:16] these words and we beheld his glory
[1:53:20] the glory of the only begotten of the
[1:53:24] father full of grace and truth
[1:53:28] he was amongst them they tangibly held
[1:53:31] them held him he seen the signs and the
[1:53:34] wonders he heard them speak gracious
[1:53:36] words the beatitude on the mount he fed
[1:53:39] the five thousand he crossed the sea and
[1:53:41] went to a man called legion they seen
[1:53:44] they witnessed the glory of god
[1:53:47] and in john chapter 21 in verse 25 he
[1:53:50] says and there are also many other
[1:53:53] things
[1:53:54] which jesus did
[1:53:56] and which if we could we should be
[1:53:59] written every one of them i suppose that
[1:54:01] even the world itself
[1:54:03] could not contain the books that should
[1:54:06] be written he's telling us here i can't
[1:54:09] write everything jesus did it's
[1:54:11] impossible
[1:54:13] to do right down the worlds the world
[1:54:16] could not contain the volumes of what
[1:54:18] jesus did
[1:54:20] now this was a witness of his first
[1:54:23] coming that we itself the world would
[1:54:25] see the glory of god and the books the
[1:54:28] volumes could not contain the world
[1:54:30] could not tame contain what jesus did
[1:54:33] but i want you to notice that there was
[1:54:35] a witness of his second coming
[1:54:38] oh he's come the spirit of god has come
[1:54:41] oh as we said he's come but he's coming
[1:54:43] but in 63 we have seen god's coming and
[1:54:46] anointing of god coming and speaking to
[1:54:48] a people so can i get another witness
[1:54:52] and i say it from the prophet's message
[1:54:54] that he was a witness
[1:54:56] and he said in the message of token he
[1:54:57] said
[1:54:58] just what i've i've seen in my own
[1:55:01] ministry oh now let's get to it oh let
[1:55:04] me see what i've seen in my own ministry
[1:55:07] seen him done you couldn't pile
[1:55:10] the volumes on the platform here
[1:55:13] if i wrote it in detail what i've seen
[1:55:16] him do in my own ministry seen him do it
[1:55:19] he had more
[1:55:21] success
[1:55:22] in my ministry than he did of his own
[1:55:27] now can you imagine john said the world
[1:55:29] could not contain what jesus himself
[1:55:33] when he was manifest in a flesh here on
[1:55:35] earth dead can you imagine now brother
[1:55:36] branham is saying that he did more in
[1:55:39] brother branham's ministry than he did
[1:55:41] in his own come on
[1:55:43] oh now this was elijah ministry but i
[1:55:46] want you to point to yourself and see
[1:55:48] what the elite shout ministry was all
[1:55:50] about
[1:55:51] friends brother branham begins to say
[1:55:53] now remember now the more success now
[1:55:56] not me
[1:55:57] he had glory hallelujah he had more
[1:56:00] success in jeffersonville than he did in
[1:56:04] nazareth can you imagine
[1:56:06] why because greater
[1:56:10] greater than all the prophets
[1:56:14] greater than all the prophets is here
[1:56:18] oh when it came his first coming john
[1:56:21] chapter one says
[1:56:23] he came to his own
[1:56:26] and his own
[1:56:27] received him not now that is a sad
[1:56:30] picture
[1:56:32] oh
[1:56:33] hallelujah the word was made flesh
[1:56:36] they were looking for him but they could
[1:56:39] not receive him
[1:56:41] and so i thought my heart lord why is it
[1:56:44] they could not receive him you know the
[1:56:46] nation that he was born to he could not
[1:56:49] receive them why was it lord and i
[1:56:51] believe it's for the same reason that
[1:56:54] people cannot receive him today
[1:56:56] you say brother steve what is it i
[1:56:58] believe the crux of the matter is he
[1:57:00] came too simple that's right amen come
[1:57:03] on lord jesus came to simple he was born
[1:57:07] in a manger they were looking for a
[1:57:08] palace
[1:57:10] they were looking for something
[1:57:11] tremendous to happen they first were
[1:57:13] looking for john the baptist or or that
[1:57:16] elisha spirit to come back on a chariot
[1:57:18] he didn't come that way he came through
[1:57:20] a man that wore a
[1:57:22] camel's skin and he yelled and screamed
[1:57:25] and said repent and they weren't looking
[1:57:27] for that
[1:57:28] they were looking for something
[1:57:30] spectacular but jesus works in
[1:57:33] simplicity
[1:57:36] i want you to notice before the seals
[1:57:37] were broke what message did brother
[1:57:39] bradley preach
[1:57:40] god
[1:57:42] in simplicity
[1:57:44] we can't you know god doesn't want us to
[1:57:46] make things so difficult
[1:57:48] remember to god we are like an ant
[1:57:52] okay and and we think we're awfully
[1:57:54] smart sometimes
[1:57:55] we think we got it all figured out
[1:57:57] because we got an iphone
[1:57:59] oh hallelujah i got a i got an ipad or i
[1:58:02] got a tablet i i got some technology now
[1:58:05] we're just amazingly smart friends we've
[1:58:08] tapped into god's laboratory but god is
[1:58:10] more vast than that
[1:58:12] and friends we got to look at god in
[1:58:14] simplicity we got to come to a place
[1:58:16] where we humble ourselves and the people
[1:58:18] of jesus day they could not humble
[1:58:21] themselves
[1:58:23] because he didn't come to the mainstream
[1:58:26] now think of it for a moment nazareth
[1:58:28] where's nazareth man where is nazareth
[1:58:31] well you know i i think about myself is
[1:58:34] could any good thing come up saint john
[1:58:37] newfoundland
[1:58:40] honestly in a pile of rocks someplace
[1:58:42] don't you think god would be in toronto
[1:58:46] skyscrapers or ottawa
[1:58:48] or somebody amazing and i'm sure he's
[1:58:50] there too in the churches there don't
[1:58:51] get me wrong but let me say friends this
[1:58:54] morning you know when we think of where
[1:58:56] god could be people are not looking in a
[1:58:58] little building like this
[1:59:00] they're looking at large buildings on on
[1:59:02] the on the hill someplace that's got
[1:59:04] tapestries and gold and silver and
[1:59:07] they've got men that are stabbing just
[1:59:08] right not spitting everywhere they just
[1:59:11] got men that are just doing the
[1:59:13] sacraments and going forth that's where
[1:59:15] god should be
[1:59:16] but god chose simply to be amongst the
[1:59:20] people brother branham says god will
[1:59:22] hide himself in something so simple
[1:59:26] that will cause the wise to miss it a
[1:59:29] million miles and then turn right back
[1:59:32] around in that some little simple thing
[1:59:35] in some simplicity of his way of his
[1:59:38] working and reveal himself right out
[1:59:40] again
[1:59:44] something
[1:59:45] when i became a believer i shouted
[1:59:47] because you know something i i i'm not a
[1:59:50] great big theologian
[1:59:52] i'm just a simple guy
[1:59:54] that loves god
[1:59:56] and when he sees showed me that it comes
[1:59:58] simplicity as babes
[2:00:01] suffer the children to come unto me for
[2:00:03] such this friends come unto me he called
[2:00:06] us that those are willing to be simple
[2:00:09] and humble to come unto him and to
[2:00:12] receive of him
[2:00:14] brother branham then says a man is
[2:00:16] always giving god praise for what he
[2:00:19] what he did do and always looking
[2:00:22] forward to what he will do and ignore
[2:00:26] what he's doing
[2:00:28] i want to challenge you what is god
[2:00:30] doing right now in your life
[2:00:32] my jesus he's done so many good things
[2:00:35] for us he's revealed himself in so many
[2:00:38] ways oh brother steve i'm lacking yes
[2:00:40] we're lacking but he's giving us more
[2:00:44] oh bring your vessel friends
[2:00:46] oh no just bring a shot guys bring a
[2:00:49] great big barrel bring it to him say
[2:00:51] lord i'm simple i'm humble fill it up
[2:00:54] lord fill my cup and make me whole this
[2:00:57] morning
[2:00:58] amen oh brother branham says they look
[2:01:01] forward and seeing the great coming
[2:01:03] that's a a great thing coming and going
[2:01:06] to happen and 9 times out of 10 it's
[2:01:09] already happened right around them
[2:01:12] it's happening right here around you
[2:01:15] angels of god are here this morning
[2:01:18] amen they're driving back the spirits of
[2:01:20] the enemy so that we can see clearly the
[2:01:24] glory of the lord for greater this
[2:01:27] morning right in our midst greater this
[2:01:30] morning
[2:01:31] is that one that's greater than all the
[2:01:33] prophets
[2:01:34] he's here this morning
[2:01:36] it's already happening god working and
[2:01:38] moving right now if we can only see not
[2:01:41] by our natural eyes but lord i pray this
[2:01:44] morning in the name of jesus christ that
[2:01:46] we conceived by spiritual eyes this
[2:01:49] morning your glory
[2:01:50] that we could see by faith
[2:01:53] right in this moment praise the lord
[2:01:55] right here right here this morning we
[2:01:57] can see the moving of god in our midst
[2:01:59] and in our hearts
[2:02:02] so i want to encourage you this morning
[2:02:04] hallelujah to open your heart
[2:02:07] i wonder if you just close your eyes
[2:02:08] just for a moment
[2:02:10] oh this is interactive preaching but
[2:02:12] friends close your eyes this morning and
[2:02:14] say to the lord lord
[2:02:16] open my heart
[2:02:18] open the eyes of my heart lord
[2:02:21] that i might see your glory
[2:02:24] who for greater than all the prophets is
[2:02:27] here this morning
[2:02:29] hallelujah now that word faith the
[2:02:31] brother branham talks about faith he
[2:02:33] said faith
[2:02:35] is the key
[2:02:38] that unlocks the door
[2:02:40] and we heard by our pastor this morning
[2:02:42] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[2:02:45] word of god so if you want to have your
[2:02:48] faith increase for whatever it is in the
[2:02:51] knowledge of knowing that god is here
[2:02:52] with you you need to hear the word of
[2:02:55] god for faith is that key that will
[2:02:58] unlock the door and jesus said i
[2:03:02] am the dar
[2:03:04] you want to unlock christ in your life
[2:03:07] use the key of faith and it's by
[2:03:09] revelation by divine or supernatural
[2:03:13] disclosure to us the simplicity of god
[2:03:17] it's by the divine supernatural
[2:03:20] simplicity of god
[2:03:22] now if we look back in our text we see
[2:03:24] you know the jews as that time
[2:03:26] they were instructed by the scriptures
[2:03:29] they were well read by the scriptures
[2:03:31] paul himself was was trained under the
[2:03:34] feet of gamalia
[2:03:35] they knew the word the scribes the
[2:03:37] pharisees see they dealt in the word and
[2:03:40] the people went to the synagogue
[2:03:42] regularly to hear the readings of the
[2:03:44] scrolls so they were well trained to
[2:03:46] know the kind of character that was
[2:03:49] going to be in the messiah
[2:03:52] and one of the major scriptures that
[2:03:54] they honed down to they looked to and it
[2:03:56] said by moses in in deuteronomy chapter
[2:03:59] 18 verse 15 moses declaring what the the
[2:04:03] prophet or the messiah would be like and
[2:04:05] he said the lord god will raise up unto
[2:04:08] thee a prophet so they were looking for
[2:04:10] a prophet
[2:04:11] from the midst of them right amongst
[2:04:13] their people they weren't looking
[2:04:15] outside they were looking right for them
[2:04:17] amongst them and and he would be of
[2:04:18] their brethren like unto moses now
[2:04:21] they've seen signs and they've seen
[2:04:23] wonders out of what god had done in
[2:04:25] moses ministry so the people were
[2:04:27] looking for a prophet
[2:04:28] and they were looking for a prophet
[2:04:30] likely to moses there was they wanted to
[2:04:32] see signs out of out of jesus because
[2:04:35] maybe if they saw a sign they could
[2:04:37] start believing
[2:04:38] but it's not in the sign
[2:04:40] it's not in the wonders it's by the word
[2:04:45] that was brought
[2:04:47] you know as time progressed
[2:04:49] these words of prophecy we're in the
[2:04:52] minds of the people but not on the
[2:04:54] forefront of the people's minds
[2:04:57] and you say how does that work brother
[2:04:58] steve well i want to point back to noah
[2:05:01] for just a moment
[2:05:02] noah god asked him i want you to build
[2:05:05] this ark
[2:05:06] i want you to get it ready now the first
[2:05:09] few days and months and even years that
[2:05:11] moa moses
[2:05:13] noah would get up and he began to preach
[2:05:15] it's going to rain the people hearkened
[2:05:17] his words
[2:05:19] they listened to his words but as time
[2:05:21] progressed
[2:05:22] and you know distractions of life
[2:05:24] progress what happened their faith began
[2:05:27] to wane
[2:05:28] in what god really said now was it in
[2:05:30] their minds yes it was in the back part
[2:05:32] of their minds now i want you before
[2:05:34] fast forward to this what moses said
[2:05:36] about about a prophet they were looking
[2:05:38] for a prophet they desired to have the
[2:05:41] prophet but friends the preaching of the
[2:05:44] word according to hey there's going to
[2:05:46] be a prophet there's going to be there's
[2:05:48] going to be became dim in their ears
[2:05:52] it became common language
[2:05:56] oh they know the where the when the how
[2:06:01] they had it all together they could sit
[2:06:02] together they've heard it for a long
[2:06:04] time just like we have heard the message
[2:06:06] of the hour today
[2:06:09] but there is going to be a rapture
[2:06:11] all of what the prophet has preached to
[2:06:14] us and and share it to us and open the
[2:06:16] mystery so that we could believe friends
[2:06:19] the last episode the last thing to
[2:06:21] happen is that there's a change of our
[2:06:23] bodies
[2:06:24] hey there's nothing else to be fulfilled
[2:06:27] i trust that you believe that here this
[2:06:29] morning hallelujah there's only seven
[2:06:32] messengers in the hand of god
[2:06:34] and we've been led by that messenger and
[2:06:36] friends the scripture said in joshua
[2:06:38] times oh my servant moses is dead but
[2:06:40] the holy spirit joshua will lead you
[2:06:42] over we are led by the word of god this
[2:06:44] morning in the ministry of elisha the
[2:06:47] bride having a ministry we're not
[2:06:48] looking for another man to come
[2:06:51] we're not looking for another grouping
[2:06:52] of a man to give us the holy ghost
[2:06:54] christ himself
[2:06:56] greater then all the prophets is already
[2:07:00] here this morning and he's in our midst
[2:07:02] this morning
[2:07:03] so friends i want you to notice now that
[2:07:05] the time of israel you know before jesus
[2:07:08] came it was 400 years from malachi to
[2:07:10] jesus
[2:07:13] 400 years now you think 400 years well
[2:07:16] okay let me ask you a question
[2:07:18] to all those that are are are brilliant
[2:07:21] this morning who remembers that would
[2:07:23] happen in 19 or 16 21.
[2:07:28] i don't hear anybody
[2:07:30] what anybody knows 1721 1821 how about
[2:07:34] 1921. that's a long time ago friends
[2:07:38] right what happened there so when you
[2:07:40] think of 400 years that's a super super
[2:07:43] long time from malachi to jesus and yet
[2:07:47] it went past from family to family
[2:07:50] tradition to tradition about hey there's
[2:07:53] going to come a prophet
[2:07:55] now we've been hearing and hearing and
[2:07:57] hearing and hearing of the coming of the
[2:07:59] coming of the lord
[2:08:01] and friends it's come so simple through
[2:08:04] the voice of a seventh angel
[2:08:06] that the word of god has spoken to it
[2:08:08] and people have missed it the spiritual
[2:08:11] coming they have missed it a million
[2:08:13] miles why because it's too simple he
[2:08:17] came through a seventh grade educated
[2:08:19] man it came to somebody that had a a a
[2:08:22] peculiar birth and had a father that was
[2:08:24] a
[2:08:25] a murderer and he himself decided desire
[2:08:29] to commit suicide and it all taints
[2:08:31] everything that came forth but yet it
[2:08:33] was the word of god coming through that
[2:08:36] microphone
[2:08:37] amen we believe yes sir
[2:08:39] i want you to notice
[2:08:41] and we'll get into maybe in just a few
[2:08:43] minutes but friends we're not worshiping
[2:08:44] eliezer this morning
[2:08:47] come on
[2:08:49] eliezer was a microphone
[2:08:51] who were worshiping the god
[2:08:53] that one the rainbow above his head that
[2:08:55] came down and brought the word of god
[2:08:57] through a mouthpiece the voice
[2:09:00] we're praising god for that one who is
[2:09:02] coming the king of kings he is still
[2:09:04] here this morning he hasn't disappeared
[2:09:06] he didn't die in 1965. we're not going
[2:09:09] to a pyramid grave to see if he comes
[2:09:11] back out no he's alive he's in the
[2:09:14] mechanics and the dynamics and he's the
[2:09:16] same yesterday today and forever
[2:09:19] i'm glad you believed that this morning
[2:09:22] hallelujah amen so these modernized jews
[2:09:26] you know they
[2:09:28] jesus came they're blown off the scrolls
[2:09:30] and they were looking to see could this
[2:09:31] be him how this was and they were
[2:09:33] looking for a sign
[2:09:35] but i want you to notice they had
[2:09:36] forgotten that this prophet
[2:09:39] was going to be different than all other
[2:09:41] prophets
[2:09:43] they were not reading between the lines
[2:09:46] how many knows where the prophet of god
[2:09:48] said read between the lines
[2:09:49] they couldn't see that this was the
[2:09:52] prophet not just a prophet but was this
[2:09:55] was the prophet
[2:09:56] that was to come the messiah their eyes
[2:09:59] were not supernatural eyes but i want
[2:10:02] you to notice
[2:10:03] amongst a whole generation of people
[2:10:06] there was
[2:10:08] friends there were two
[2:10:10] that were amongst them that could see
[2:10:12] the glory of god and i was so glad
[2:10:14] brother gerald this morning you read
[2:10:16] that scripture
[2:10:18] because i want you to notice
[2:10:20] the scripture and i'm going to read it
[2:10:21] in a moment or speak about in a moment
[2:10:23] the scripture said these people they
[2:10:25] were led by the spirit of god
[2:10:30] you know this person he moved by faith

[2:15:33] and fourth hallelujah four 000 years had
[2:15:36] passed and every great man had looked

[2:15:49] watched the child be born and they were

[2:20:04] word he's going to tell you exactly and
[2:20:06] he's going to go and he's going to point
[2:20:07] you right to what the prophet said
[2:20:11] the question is are you going to take
[2:20:13] that word and are you going to place it
[2:20:15] in your heart
[2:20:16] amen oh when he says you ought to take
[2:20:18] the dynamic of the word and live it and
[2:20:21] you got a sick baby at home or you got a
[2:20:23] negative situation at work or
[2:20:25] something's going on can you speak the
[2:20:27] word with the authority by the word on
[2:20:30] your situation
[2:20:32] well the word says you can if you're an
[2:20:34] adopted son and daughter of god you
[2:20:36] carry all the possessions of the father
[2:20:40] you're placed in the governor intuited
[2:20:42] and at the point in time the father
[2:20:45] stood and he announced to all the people
[2:20:47] this is my son he's this is listen
[2:20:50] friends this is to you not just to jesus
[2:20:53] this is to you this is my son
[2:20:55] oh he's under a governor and a tutor and
[2:20:58] i will lead him continually but i want
[2:21:00] you to know
[2:21:01] that all the authority lays upon my son
[2:21:04] and my daughter
[2:21:06] all the authority they've tucked it in
[2:21:08] their heart they you know friends they
[2:21:10] spoke the word they had a toothache and
[2:21:12] they said in the name of jesus christ it
[2:21:14] starts by a toothache if you've got a
[2:21:16] cancer in your body that's way big but
[2:21:18] start with a toothache that's just
[2:21:20] gnawing yet giving you a headache speak
[2:21:22] to that and see god's word fulfilled
[2:21:25] you look at your bank account friends
[2:21:26] now listen god said he'd always feed us
[2:21:28] but look at your bank account if it's at
[2:21:30] a negative this morning and i'm not
[2:21:31] preaching prosper prosperity this
[2:21:33] morning i'm just giving you a thought of
[2:21:35] faith look at it and you can say in the
[2:21:37] name of jesus you can help me get out of
[2:21:39] this situation
[2:21:40] by your words as we preached already by
[2:21:43] your words is a testimony of what god
[2:21:45] has done by your words you can show the
[2:21:48] world yes sir
[2:21:50] greater than all the prophets is
[2:21:52] here amen
[2:21:53] glory hallelujah
[2:21:55] so jesus said no by no stretch of
[2:21:57] imagination was he just a prophet
[2:22:00] he was the prophet
[2:22:02] upon the earth and brother brown says
[2:22:04] god and providing healing he said to
[2:22:05] this generation he said
[2:22:07] every type
[2:22:09] in the old testament was met in him
[2:22:13] and he was and is god everlasting the
[2:22:17] provided sacrifice for sin and sickness
[2:22:21] in him
[2:22:22] dwelt the power to omit
[2:22:26] to forgive every sin that was ever
[2:22:30] committed
[2:22:32] in christ jesus in the life
[2:22:35] now remember back to the token brother
[2:22:37] brandon begins to talk about animal life
[2:22:39] and how animal life was just a covering
[2:22:41] they'd come year by year they would
[2:22:42] sacrifice and the blood would pour and
[2:22:44] that god would forgive their sins but it
[2:22:46] was just a covering for sin
[2:22:48] but the blood of jesus christ it was
[2:22:51] god's blood
[2:22:52] it was the blood of god created life
[2:22:55] there was life in that blood and it was
[2:22:57] the life that covered our sin and that's
[2:23:01] why brother branham says there was every
[2:23:03] power
[2:23:05] in that life
[2:23:06] was there to omit sin hallelujah
[2:23:10] oh friends that life
[2:23:12] that attribute of life is inside of you
[2:23:16] her lord jesus came in fullness but on
[2:23:18] the day of pentecost friends you receive
[2:23:20] that life
[2:23:21] that life is inside of you and when you
[2:23:24] speak the word that life comes forward
[2:23:28] oh brother branham says here hallelujah
[2:23:31] sin sickness came an attribute of sin
[2:23:33] and when sin was brought into the world
[2:23:36] sickness followed it death followed it
[2:23:39] and jesus come to make
[2:23:41] uh a riddance of sin and and when he
[2:23:43] read sin he ripped every attribute of
[2:23:47] that sin produces he destroyed it all
[2:23:51] you asked me why listen friends i can't
[2:23:54] contain myself in those songs this time
[2:23:56] my sins are gone the brothers said this
[2:23:58] morning that must be a deep sea well
[2:24:01] thank god
[2:24:02] because i don't want any of you go
[2:24:03] fishing in that sea for my sins
[2:24:06] oh there's a sign that brother brandon
[2:24:07] said there's no fission and satan you
[2:24:10] cannot fish there i'm a son and daughter
[2:24:12] of god so everything friendzoned he read
[2:24:15] every attribute of sin
[2:24:18] brother branham says i hope you see it
[2:24:19] tonight when he killed sin he killed
[2:24:22] everything that sin produces
[2:24:25] he killed worry oh my he killed temper
[2:24:30] he killed everything that produces sin
[2:24:33] so think in your life for just a moment
[2:24:36] that sin produces worry how many of us
[2:24:38] are worry words
[2:24:40] oh i worry about this
[2:24:42] and i worry about that
[2:24:44] and i i'm fearful about this and i'm
[2:24:46] fearful of that and oh all of a sudden
[2:24:49] when you're worried
[2:24:51] and you're fearful and it's consuming
[2:24:53] you all of a sudden temporarize
[2:24:57] come on
[2:24:59] and before you know it it says you just
[2:25:01] are angry and you're angry all the time
[2:25:04] but i want you to know god has come to
[2:25:06] omit all of that
[2:25:08] to change that that thing out of your
[2:25:10] life now let me tell you this the
[2:25:11] prophet god links different spirits
[2:25:13] together and when you've got worry and
[2:25:15] you've got fear and you've got temper
[2:25:17] when you're angry all the time brother
[2:25:18] branham says you invite cancer
[2:25:23] how many still want to be mad
[2:25:27] right we don't
[2:25:28] oh i don't want can't cancer away from
[2:25:30] it no no friends
[2:25:32] you
[2:25:33] are accepting these things
[2:25:35] satan only can get through to you by by
[2:25:38] by giving you a thought and you have to
[2:25:40] receive that thought and when it comes
[2:25:43] into your thought mental uh faculties
[2:25:46] then it begins to work on your spirit
[2:25:48] and all of a sudden reasoning comes
[2:25:52] and you begin to reason well
[2:25:54] i remember
[2:25:55] when i was sick and i had that little
[2:25:56] spa and now i have this spot and i
[2:25:58] remember that guy with no face
[2:26:00] i remember i first thought oh my
[2:26:02] goodness now now you start worrying
[2:26:04] oh my goodness the brother did it at
[2:26:06] breakfast oh my goodness i better shave
[2:26:07] my beard maybe i've got something
[2:26:08] underneath there you know you begin to
[2:26:10] worry you know everybody gets a fret
[2:26:12] hang on friends that is reasoning taking
[2:26:14] control
[2:26:16] look at that thing and say in the name
[2:26:18] of jesus christ i cursed you satan
[2:26:21] and then you need a little help from the
[2:26:22] doctor because it's kind of gory to cut
[2:26:24] it off yourself
[2:26:25] right who wants to have that rose butter
[2:26:27] yucky looking spot in your body it's
[2:26:28] offensive and nobody wants to see that
[2:26:30] to go to the doctor not because it's
[2:26:31] cancer
[2:26:32] there's no life in it
[2:26:34] as soon as you accept it it cuts life
[2:26:37] that's the words from the prophet
[2:26:39] as soon as you receive it it becomes a
[2:26:42] life
[2:26:43] and then you have to come and the elders
[2:26:44] of the church anoint you with oil and we
[2:26:46] curse the life and you have to believe
[2:26:48] the life is gone but symbolize the
[2:26:51] process okay make it simple look at the
[2:26:53] thing and say satan you're done go to
[2:26:55] the doctor get that silly thing cut off
[2:26:57] get the stitches and by god's grace you
[2:26:58] move along i don't care what it is
[2:27:01] believe the word of god first
[2:27:04] and then ask for the doctors the second
[2:27:07] because god's already who does the
[2:27:08] healing the brother says i can't do the
[2:27:10] healing the doctor says i can't do the
[2:27:12] healing it's god that's got to do the
[2:27:14] healing but you can stop the devil at
[2:27:17] the door
[2:27:18] stop worrying
[2:27:19] amen stop fearing
[2:27:22] stop with your temperance and your bad
[2:27:25] behaviors
[2:27:26] and realize that god through the blood
[2:27:29] through the life that was in the blood
[2:27:30] has already omitted sin for you
[2:27:34] oh an example of scripture this morning
[2:27:36] is the woman at the well
[2:27:39] in john chapter 4 you know that woman of
[2:27:40] the well came and jesus you know he
[2:27:42] needed to see her i'm gonna paraphrase
[2:27:45] in my own words i hope you can don't
[2:27:46] mind for that but here we go here comes
[2:27:49] a woman from the well she had to come a
[2:27:50] different time than any other women
[2:27:52] because she was not accepted
[2:27:54] and jesus he he knew he needed to meet
[2:27:56] this woman and he realized that
[2:27:57] disciples also would have a critical
[2:27:59] spirit
[2:28:00] so critical spirits and negativity
[2:28:02] around it doesn't work
[2:28:04] jesus god has got to disperse all of it
[2:28:06] remember that woman was laying sick he
[2:28:07] took everybody to leave the room and
[2:28:09] leave him alone with that sick person
[2:28:11] say negativity that's why when we pray
[2:28:12] for somebody in the house of god if
[2:28:14] you're negative if you're against the
[2:28:16] word of god please leave the building
[2:28:17] before we pray because we can't have no
[2:28:20] negatives present people need to get
[2:28:21] healed they need to get what they need
[2:28:23] from god and we can't have negative
[2:28:25] people in the building just as jesus
[2:28:26] couldn't do it and we see though so
[2:28:28] jesus sent all the disciples away and
[2:28:31] they begin to sit there and they begin
[2:28:32] to converse with this woman and you know
[2:28:34] the conversation and before the the you
[2:28:36] know it the woman begins to say you know
[2:28:38] we know the messiah should come which is
[2:28:41] also called christ and when he would
[2:28:42] come he will tell us all things
[2:28:44] and jesus he discerns their heart he
[2:28:47] says unto her well i i'm the god that's
[2:28:49] speaking to you
[2:28:52] really you're the guy yeah i'm the guy
[2:28:54] and all of a sudden when he told her her
[2:28:57] problems now jesus is telling your
[2:28:58] problems this morning
[2:29:00] he that is greater than all the prophets
[2:29:02] being here this morning
[2:29:04] that mighty angel
[2:29:05] with that rainbow above his head he's
[2:29:07] speaking to you this morning
[2:29:08] through the voice of the message
[2:29:10] and so she realized oh her eyes began
[2:29:13] spiritual
[2:29:14] he looked just like any other man
[2:29:15] sitting there
[2:29:16] he was a jew talking to samaritans jews
[2:29:18] samaritans didn't come together in fact
[2:29:21] she should have left her pot and took
[2:29:22] off
[2:29:23] but she was curious that something was
[2:29:24] speaking to her just like it speaks to
[2:29:26] ours and she came and she then began to
[2:29:28] he began to speak to her told her her
[2:29:30] needs and then what did she do her
[2:29:32] supernatural eyes were not her natural
[2:29:34] eyes
[2:29:35] her supernatural eyes came open and the
[2:29:38] scripture says the woman then left her
[2:29:40] water pot and went away to the city and
[2:29:43] saith unto them and she began to testify
[2:29:46] come and see come and see right but i
[2:29:50] want you to notice what she did this is
[2:29:52] powerful to me i hope it does the same
[2:29:53] to you
[2:29:54] i want you to realize that she knew
[2:29:56] herself that her sins were omitted
[2:29:59] do you know how that
[2:30:00] she left her water pot
[2:30:03] she left her own life behind
[2:30:06] she left it all she accepted the word
[2:30:10] for the time and her season
[2:30:12] and the word said she was cleansed the
[2:30:15] word said she was forgiven all those
[2:30:17] other husbands and all the things she'd
[2:30:19] ever done they were now under the under
[2:30:21] the under the atonement for sin and she
[2:30:24] went free why because the master
[2:30:28] because he that was greater than all the
[2:30:30] prophets he's the one who told her that
[2:30:33] you are free and she left her water pot
[2:30:35] and she began to testify
[2:30:38] that's why we testify
[2:30:40] that's why we give praise to god that's
[2:30:41] why we go to our places at work and say
[2:30:43] hey this is what jesus did for me and
[2:30:45] they say dude that's enough i don't want
[2:30:47] to hear your words now okay you don't
[2:30:48] hear my words but maybe somebody else
[2:30:50] wants to do it you know one of the
[2:30:51] hardest things in my life was i got this
[2:30:54] revelation in my heart that i i needed
[2:30:56] to do a little more sacrifice of praise
[2:30:58] for the lord
[2:30:59] you know i got a little caught up in my
[2:31:01] own self and
[2:31:03] you know something lordy he put it on my
[2:31:05] heart so in edmonton we have a main
[2:31:07] street you know and and on that main
[2:31:09] street has
[2:31:10] all kinds of pubs and
[2:31:13] godly places and so forth and it's kind
[2:31:15] of a vibey place it's where people go
[2:31:17] right and it's called white avenue and
[2:31:20] people love to go and they can get ice
[2:31:21] cream during the day and they can do
[2:31:22] their world things at night and so i
[2:31:24] called a group of brothers together
[2:31:26] because misery likes company and i
[2:31:28] had groups of brothers that said well
[2:31:29] you got to come at least i'm going to
[2:31:30] stand on the street now
[2:31:32] and sing and i i'm going to preach
[2:31:34] now that does not often get done in
[2:31:36] edmonton all right and the guys that
[2:31:38] have done it before ended up with black
[2:31:39] eyes so i'm quite sure that this was
[2:31:42] going to be a very test of my sacrifice
[2:31:44] of praise but i i needed to do it for
[2:31:46] the lord
[2:31:47] i wanted to tell the lord now this is my
[2:31:49] testimony but i wanted to tell the lord
[2:31:51] that i was not ashamed of him
[2:31:54] okay and now and not only this i worked
[2:31:55] in the hospital all right and the
[2:31:57] hospital was like four blocks away from
[2:31:58] where i was standing and i knew at any
[2:32:00] given moment there would be direct dos
[2:32:02] doctors
[2:32:03] and there'd be nurses coming down for
[2:32:04] ice cream and they'd be coming for lunch
[2:32:06] and there would be poor old boys steve
[2:32:09] wanted to be popular at work you know
[2:32:11] because getting on with the doctors well
[2:32:13] you know something he buys me a coffee
[2:32:15] and donuts and gets me special
[2:32:16] privileges but now the lord has spoke to
[2:32:18] my heart steve you've got to go there
[2:32:20] and give a sacrifice of praise
[2:32:23] oh well i stood up there and i was
[2:32:25] singing at first i listen i'm just like
[2:32:26] you
[2:32:28] thank you lord
[2:32:30] for saving this that wasn't enough
[2:32:34] praise me boy
[2:32:36] right thank you you know i obviously you
[2:32:39] know i can sing louder than that right
[2:32:41] pretty soon you know something so the
[2:32:43] lord invited another brother with me
[2:32:44] that was tone pitch man he could not
[2:32:47] sing to save his life
[2:32:48] i mean he made us cross out good
[2:32:51] and so the funny thing with the lord
[2:32:53] he's got a sense of humor
[2:32:54] so i invited this guy to come along and
[2:32:56] he sang at the top is his lungs because
[2:32:59] he ain't ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[2:33:01] christ and he had the awfulest voice
[2:33:04] and i thought to myself oh lord if he
[2:33:06] can do it here i go
[2:33:09] see how the lord does things right so i
[2:33:11] started singing we started praising the
[2:33:13] lord and i opened my bible and i started
[2:33:16] preaching and and again to low and quiet
[2:33:18] before you know i got boldness
[2:33:20] you know we had all kinds of people test
[2:33:22] my faith
[2:33:23] this was not a rose i had people that
[2:33:25] came and shouted in my face and people
[2:33:27] came and
[2:33:28] gave me an
[2:33:29] ungodly way and
[2:33:31] they did all kinds of things to me you
[2:33:33] know i felt very low in my spirit many
[2:33:36] times but you know something after a few
[2:33:38] weeks i i got
[2:33:41] into praising the lord and i'm telling
[2:33:42] you all of this for the moment
[2:33:45] there's one
[2:33:46] fella he came up and he was in poor
[2:33:50] shape
[2:33:51] he looked like a ragged bum you know he
[2:33:53] just oh a long beard clothes tattered
[2:33:56] and he smelled like cigarettes and
[2:33:58] alcohol he didn't smell i mean he didn't
[2:34:00] and i you know in my natural self i felt
[2:34:02] like saying hey move along
[2:34:05] okay i'm here to preach to the
[2:34:08] nicolaitans
[2:34:11] okay all the doctors and the lawyers
[2:34:13] that can't receive christ i'm here to
[2:34:14] preach to them not you dude
[2:34:18] yeah man
[2:34:19] you know
[2:34:21] this guy said but what are you saying
[2:34:23] so i opened my bible and i preached him
[2:34:26] and you know it wasn't the most
[2:34:28] exciting service because you know what i
[2:34:30] was like man you know i had every
[2:34:32] scripture to say i'm chris you know i'm
[2:34:34] casting pearls before swine really
[2:34:37] i i'm telling you how i felt everyone
[2:34:39] might do carnal
[2:34:41] that's just how it was
[2:34:43] yet i felt in my heart to go and preach
[2:34:45] the gospel on the street so anyways i
[2:34:46] laid out some scripture to me and i told
[2:34:48] him how sin could admit and what i'll
[2:34:50] say he could thank you very much and he
[2:34:52] stomp off so i said thank goodness i
[2:34:54] keep preaching you know i can preach
[2:34:55] with zeal
[2:34:57] on the streets and i'm preaching
[2:34:59] days and weeks go on
[2:35:01] and we stand on the street and i'm
[2:35:02] standing here now and you can probably
[2:35:03] figure the end of the story but i'm
[2:35:04] going to tell you anyways for the glory
[2:35:06] of the lord i'm standing there and i'm
[2:35:08] preaching again and here comes this nice
[2:35:10] looking fellow got a nice button-up
[2:35:11] shirt
[2:35:12] and shaved and combed and everything he
[2:35:14] comes up to me hi i just want to shake
[2:35:16] your hand i said oh well god bless you i
[2:35:19] said do you know the lord he said yep
[2:35:21] i said oh okay he said remember a few
[2:35:24] weeks ago
[2:35:25] do you remember that guy
[2:35:27] that came and asked you to
[2:35:29] to preach
[2:35:30] and tell me about what you're talking
[2:35:32] about the guy with the beard
[2:35:34] tattered clothes
[2:35:37] i was the guy
[2:35:40] you know what
[2:35:42] he left his own life i don't know where
[2:35:43] he is today
[2:35:46] but he heard the word of god
[2:35:48] even though i was so foolish and so
[2:35:51] reluctant
[2:35:53] i should have gone back to the message
[2:35:54] and read what the prophet said about
[2:35:56] giving the word of god to the the ones
[2:35:59] that were
[2:35:59] were trodden down and that weren't
[2:36:02] invited to the feast right i should have
[2:36:04] done that but you know i was just human
[2:36:06] but you know what the lord opened my
[2:36:07] eyes you know something everyone
[2:36:11] we are come across to preach the gospel
[2:36:13] because it's that life of the gospel
[2:36:16] it's he the greater than all the
[2:36:17] prophets is the one who's doing the
[2:36:19] speaking through our life that omits
[2:36:21] their sin and he's the one that causes
[2:36:23] us to leave our water pots
[2:36:27] and go and testify the one that saved me
[2:36:31] saved him the one that saved me saved
[2:36:33] you it's the same god i hope you're
[2:36:36] seeing what i'm saying today sin has
[2:36:38] killed
[2:36:39] everything that produces sin
[2:36:43] oh testify come and see
[2:36:45] is this not the christ
[2:36:48] isn't god in our midst
[2:36:53] oh he's in our midst okay i heard a
[2:36:55] testimony just now in your midst i don't
[2:36:57] believe the brother's here this morning
[2:36:58] but i think his name is brother vaishal
[2:37:01] right
[2:37:02] through a man's willing to give the
[2:37:04] gospel he seen a life he was thirsting
[2:37:06] out there i understand but with the
[2:37:08] desire in our heart is this your
[2:37:09] testimony he came into the house of god
[2:37:12] brother gerald heard the preaching the
[2:37:13] word and i believe that in his heart he
[2:37:15] went all the way back to india to tell
[2:37:17] his parents
[2:37:18] under the fear of persecution to tell
[2:37:20] him that jesus is alive and he's coming
[2:37:23] back and he's saying surely my eyes my
[2:37:26] supernatural eyes are open to see that
[2:37:29] greater than all the prophets is right
[2:37:30] here
[2:37:31] in saint john
[2:37:33] where the word of god is being preached
[2:37:35] by men of god come and see
[2:37:38] oh friends i want you to notice that was
[2:37:40] the time of jesus now i want you to

[2:42:10] why don't you find out the fulfillment
[2:42:12] of all of this
[2:42:14] not let's just point at a thing and say
[2:42:15] well i heard him the pastor kind of
[2:42:17] related something i kind of understand
[2:42:19] we got to have a guppy love and so no
[2:42:21] it's god to be part of you
[2:42:24] oh he you know he's kind of you know
[2:42:26] he's got you know people in prophet's
[2:42:28] day
[2:42:29] they came they're up all kinds of
[2:42:31] denomination
[2:42:33] and brother branham he he came amongst
[2:42:35] the people
[2:42:36] and god wanted to stir them now they see
[2:42:38] 1906 they had seen the power of god move
[2:42:41] but they weren't hadn't seen it yet how
[2:42:43] god was going to reveal it through this
[2:42:45] prophet
[2:42:46] so god had to rally
[2:42:48] the people up and what did he do
[2:42:50] the first thing he did he got their
[2:42:51] attention with brother brother and calls
[2:42:53] it the first pole how many knows what
[2:42:54] that is
[2:42:56] the first pole well well it was like the
[2:42:58] ministry of moses i remember when moses
[2:42:59] went to the burning bush and god said
[2:43:02] take off your shoes and through the
[2:43:03] whole thing and he said now put your
[2:43:04] hand in your your side
[2:43:06] moses put his hand in his side and when
[2:43:08] he pulled it out remember it was leprous
[2:43:10] and god spoke to him said now put it
[2:43:12] back in your hand again they put it in
[2:43:13] the side they came out clean and brother
[2:43:15] brandon began to teach us and tell us
[2:43:16] that full first pull ministry was that
[2:43:19] same kind of mystery god fulfilling
[2:43:20] himself he calm and he began to pray for
[2:43:22] the people and all of a sudden he began
[2:43:24] to see thrashes and signs and things
[2:43:26] that came on his hand and he began to
[2:43:28] tell the people he began to associate oh
[2:43:30] this kind of rash was with this and this
[2:43:32] was kind of like that and god began to
[2:43:34] and what did it do it began to pull
[2:43:36] together the little fish
[2:43:38] but god are just not god's not looking
[2:43:39] for immature people
[2:43:41] god's not looking for people that are
[2:43:43] just drinking milk and looking for
[2:43:44] little things
[2:43:46] god wants some people that are ready to
[2:43:48] receive
[2:43:49] all of him
[2:43:51] okay you can't take a little little
[2:43:53] bitty child which is a female and think
[2:43:56] that she's going to produce life it
[2:43:57] won't happen
[2:43:58] she's got to be a mature bride in order
[2:44:02] to produce life so then god began to
[2:44:04] work also in the ministry of brother
[2:44:06] branham and now he received the ministry
[2:44:08] of the second bull i remember that
[2:44:10] and the second point was that messiah
[2:44:12] sign just like jesus did to nathanael oh
[2:44:15] there's a man with no gow how did you
[2:44:17] know me before
[2:44:18] before philip called you i saw you under
[2:44:21] that tree and there be god begin to
[2:44:23] speak through that second poll natural
[2:44:25] words right through fishing man god is
[2:44:28] so simple
[2:44:29] you know i can imagine the theologians
[2:44:31] there that was studying the scriptures
[2:44:33] and they had their intellectual hat on
[2:44:35] uh here he goes again
[2:44:37] talking about fishing
[2:44:39] talking about hunting
[2:44:41] okay i know what they did they shut
[2:44:42] their ears off but there were some
[2:44:44] people that started to listen they saw
[2:44:46] what god did and all of a sudden now it
[2:44:48] was it happened with a hand well that's
[2:44:50] cool now all of a sudden their hearts
[2:44:52] were being discerned
[2:44:53] they come through the prayer line and he
[2:44:55] would stand there and say you know what
[2:44:56] listen here
[2:44:57] this is not me doing what god's doing
[2:45:01] and he's talking and talking which seems
[2:45:03] forever right and i feel like saying get
[2:45:05] on with it brother branham yeah
[2:45:07] come on rush it along but he said you
[2:45:09] know who i'm waiting for
[2:45:11] and he's sitting there and he's waiting
[2:45:13] and then the angel lord comes and then
[2:45:14] he says he's here
[2:45:16] and i'm testifying this morning of what
[2:45:17] god has done greater than solomon
[2:45:20] greater than all the prophets he's in
[2:45:22] the midst of the prophet and we see it
[2:45:24] on the on the prayer lines we see their
[2:45:26] god as i'm fulfilling his word and this
[2:45:29] messiah signs now your name is so-and-so
[2:45:32] martha and you live in this address no
[2:45:34] man could ever know what was it it was
[2:45:36] gathering together the little bigger
[2:45:38] fish
[2:45:40] they could see it they saw the smallies
[2:45:42] and he had the little biggers but that
[2:45:45] wasn't yet where it was at yeah and then
[2:45:47] brother adam says i was praying one day
[2:45:49] and the king's source struck my hand
[2:45:51] yeah
[2:45:52] now we're gonna get a message
[2:45:54] okay now it's just not the sign
[2:45:57] a sign because uh an evil an adulteress
[2:45:59] generation they just look for signs
[2:46:01] you see it people same today you know
[2:46:04] signs this is amazing people see signs
[2:46:06] and wonders and i love signs and wonders
[2:46:08] okay but they worship the sign
[2:46:10] so i driving down the road you know when
[2:46:11] you see a sign here's the sign and it's
[2:46:13] just go off over here to uh uh
[2:46:16] conception cove or whatever else here
[2:46:19] is that what it's called
[2:46:21] consensual you're driving right and you
[2:46:23] see turn left well people they stop and
[2:46:26] they say oh glory to god
[2:46:28] there's the sigh
[2:46:31] but the son is telling you to go
[2:46:32] somewhere
[2:46:34] isn't that right
[2:46:35] first poll the second poll it was a sign
[2:46:38] to tell us to go somewhere
[2:46:40] but you know people stop the car
[2:46:42] and they say glory to god for the sign
[2:46:44] hallelujah and they rally around the
[2:46:46] sign and they call their friends
[2:46:48] look at the sign look at the sign look
[2:46:50] at the wonders look at the gifts look so
[2:46:51] it's whatever happened
[2:46:52] god is pointing to us to somewhere else
[2:46:55] amen and then people there's another
[2:46:57] camp of people that say glory to god for
[2:46:58] eliezer well yes glory forgotten for
[2:47:01] eliza but not in the way they're saying
[2:47:02] it
[2:47:03] right how many remember brother random
[2:47:05] he said i had to shoot that serpent
[2:47:08] oh that servant was coming in and they
[2:47:09] were starting to worship me how do you

[2:47:13] he shot it and it was wounded and went
[2:47:14] into into the water into the people

[2:47:18] today come on we got to guard ourselves
[2:47:21] against we want him

[2:47:26] now the vessel the eliezer man what a
[2:47:28] mighty man that was we cannot have a
[2:47:30] message without pointing to the
[2:47:32] messenger we cannot do it
[2:47:34] so we honor the messenger
[2:47:36] but i want to remind you that i love
[2:47:38] this this story
[2:47:40] of eliezer going to find isaac a wife

[2:49:22] happiness
[2:49:24] in her heart to receive the
[2:49:26] understanding by a concrete evidence
[2:49:31] that that there was an isaac
[2:49:34] and i want you to notice now we don't
[2:49:36] count down on gifts

[2:49:51] rebecca's heart to get on the camel the
[2:49:53] power to get her to isaac
[2:49:55] those are long journeys
[2:49:57] she began to say well could you tell me

[2:50:29] the word oh eliezer can you tell me more
[2:50:32] and send in your words helias or give me
[2:50:35] more of god's word
[2:50:36] oh yeah that's right here it is here it
[2:50:38] is and begins to play it but i want you
[2:50:40] to notice some brother jarrah
[2:50:43] when she got there and she saw this man
[2:50:45] standing in the field
[2:50:47] and his back was turned her and he was
[2:50:50] by his mother's tent
[2:50:52] representing life
[2:50:54] she looked
[2:50:55] and she knew his front parts
[2:50:57] she knew his back parts she knew his
[2:51:00] side parts she knew all about him why
[2:51:02] because ali ager did a fantastic job
[2:51:05] amen
[2:51:07] alligator did an amazing job to describe
[2:51:10] to her what isaac looked at
[2:51:13] now i want you to notice she she didn't
[2:51:15] cry and lament that she was going to
[2:51:17] just pop off and go to isaac
[2:51:20] no no
[2:51:21] she said thank you sir
[2:51:23] i appreciate it sir but my eyes are on
[2:51:26] isaac
[2:51:27] do you think she brought uh lease or
[2:51:29] disrespect after they journeyed together
[2:51:30] with isaac aleeza after do you think she
[2:51:33] brought any disrespect to ellie easter
[2:51:34] the rest of the trip like oh you're
[2:51:36] nothing no
[2:51:37] she said eliezer was so good
[2:51:40] he told me all about you
[2:51:42] and what did she do she went together
[2:51:44] with isaac she went into his chamber and
[2:51:46] there became an invisible
[2:51:49] union
[2:51:50] of the bride
[2:51:52] what did happen what happened just right
[2:51:53] there she recognized who isaac was
[2:51:56] she recognized that right in her midst
[2:51:59] greater than all the prophets greater
[2:52:01] than anything any first pull any second
[2:52:04] paul that the third paul ministry was in
[2:52:06] her most bringing life
[2:52:09] the word brings life it's rapturing
[2:52:12] faith in the word of god
[2:52:14] it's life in human flesh today the
[2:52:17] thoughts of god
[2:52:19] that's what we see today in this hour i
[2:52:22] and you
[2:52:24] are the proof of the resurrection and
[2:52:27] the life
[2:52:28] we are proof that what happened in the
[2:52:31] first poll and the second poll was truth
[2:52:33] we are proof of today that there that
[2:52:36] the third paul ministry that life of
[2:52:38] jesus christ is in our hands we are the
[2:52:40] proof of who he is
[2:52:44] he's the alpha and omega but can your
[2:52:46] eyes be open to see
[2:52:49] can you see who he is
[2:52:51] those ones now i'm closing
[2:52:56] those that were on the road to emmaus i
[2:52:57] love this story
[2:52:59] they were walking and they were
[2:53:00] downtrodden because they felt that
[2:53:03] you know jesus had left them
[2:53:07] as they began to walk
[2:53:10] there was a stranger to them they
[2:53:12] thought
[2:53:13] join them
[2:53:14] and he walked them all along the way and
[2:53:16] they begin to
[2:53:18] speak about the truth and their the
[2:53:19] scripture said as he begin to speak to
[2:53:22] them
[2:53:23] their hearts burned within
[2:53:25] and now their hearts burned but they
[2:53:26] didn't know who he was yet
[2:53:28] that's right
[2:53:30] oh praise the land and they walked and
[2:53:32] they walked and he talked and he talked
[2:53:34] but i want you to notice he came to the
[2:53:36] end and they persuaded him please come
[2:53:39] and stay we enjoyed our conversation
[2:53:42] it's burning in us please stay
[2:53:44] spend a minute a few moments before you
[2:53:46] go
[2:53:48] and she and there that stranger said
[2:53:50] sure i'll come in and he sat down and i
[2:53:53] want you to notice
[2:53:56] where their eyes were open
[2:53:58] it wasn't about all the talk and the
[2:54:00] things that they understood
[2:54:02] intellectually
[2:54:03] it was when they had a supernatural
[2:54:05] moment with the stranger
[2:54:07] and what did he do
[2:54:09] he took the bread
[2:54:11] and he broke it
[2:54:13] jesus said i
[2:54:16] am the bread of life
[2:54:18] he broke his word friends don't be

[2:54:38] all at once he walked beside me
[2:54:42] like he'd been there all along
[2:54:46] not a stranger
[2:54:48] but a father
[2:54:50] who could sense when something's wrong
[2:54:54] and he answered all my questions
[2:54:57] and he understood my fears
[2:55:00] that somehow vanished now
[2:55:02] that he is
[2:55:04] near
[2:55:05] can you see

[2:55:23] morning greater than all the prophets

[2:55:44] bear for him to leave me
[2:55:47] so i begged him please to stay
[2:55:49] spend the evening a few moments
[2:55:52] before he went his way
[2:55:54] like a host he turned and blessed broke
[2:55:56] the bread just as he's doing and he's
[2:55:58] doing over again not just this meeting
[2:56:00] but continually through the voice that
[2:56:02] we hear on the tapes and the voice
[2:56:04] that's spoken through our pastors he's
[2:56:06] breaking the bread
[2:56:07] oh can't you see friends
