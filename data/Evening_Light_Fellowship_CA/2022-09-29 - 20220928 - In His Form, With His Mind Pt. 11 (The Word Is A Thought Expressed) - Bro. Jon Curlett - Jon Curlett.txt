what makes it a special services when you have your way when your word is spoken Lord impurity and simplicity Lord when it's given him faith and it's received in the same Lord that's a special service Lord and so Lord we're inviting you now speak to each heart and soul Lord to reach into our lives Lord to open those doors where maybe we haven't opened it before that we would humble ourselves before you Lord surrender to your word or that it could have its way in our lives Lord that we can bring forth fruit Lord that Lord reflects the the Fountain of Life that's out within us Heavenly Father Lord forgive us forgive me Lord for I fall short Norma may you set it aside under the blood once again this evening or that your people could be touched by your presence and your word we pray to offer we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen amen amen God bless you this evening just have your seats maybe if you would for for a moment certainly want to welcome back sister Maureen amen glad that the Lord has protected her from from the the house of pestilence over there amen and hopefully I talked to brother Mark and he's certainly doing much better I talked to brother Paul down in the states what a trip you go down for a funeral and you get coveted so anyways he says he is recovering very quickly so we thank the Lord for that happy to see brother Gerald back brother uh David back as well and happy to see our visitors amen from western Canada God bless you both it's good to see you amen I just wanted to give a quick update before we start the the preaching of the word this this evening and of course I shared last week about Brother David Nash the missionary that we've been supporting and uh later that evening on Sunday I believe maybe it was Monday he sent me this picture so they were in Panama and they went up into the mountains to the indigenous people and they preached up there and I shared those pictures last time well he said at the end of the services they had four people that wanted baptism so you know what we sent them about maybe two thousand dollars so it's five hundred dollars or so I'd say we got a pretty good deal right there amen so we praise the Lord for that that's what we're looking for we're looking for that last one to come in so we can get out of here but you see it's it's certainly no special place it's no great Cathedral that's waiting for them no amazing musicians but it's hardcore preaching amen this is where the rubber meets the road and uh anyways he's in there that's him in the in the in the in the far distance there on the the middle left hand side the little short white man there that's Brother David Nash in the middle of a a dirty River in the middle of nowhere baptizing four souls into the Kingdom so we certainly are thankful for that and certainly as we we can moving forward we'll continue to bless him but he wanted to to thank the church for their support and and give an account amen give an account for what he's doing with his time and with his energy over there so we thank the Lord for that amen if we just stand together as we read the word this evening we're going to turn to Romans chapter 10 Romans chapter 10. a very familiar scripture of course to the believer Romans chapter 10 and verse 8. amen Romans 10 and verse 8 says what but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved amen this is not just a word of confession but this is something that starts in the heart amen it says in verse 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed amen God bless his word you maybe have your seats this evening we want to continue in our our series of in his form and with his mind and we're down to the the last strokes and I know I've said that a couple of times but this is truly it and I want to start what's probably going to be maybe a three-part final portion of this with the the the title of the word is a thought expressed amen and we spoke last time of kind of the overarching theme as we finish this is the idea of a speaking bride amen we've talked about being in the form of God we've talked about taking on the mind of Christ we've talked about the emptying out of the believer and the surrender and letting the Holy Spirit come in and anoint us and use us and we said last service that if you have a voice or if you have a body and if you have a mind of God then you're going to speak like God Amen that if the if the word is inside of you then the word has to come outside of you as well it cannot just stay in there because the word is life and it is spirit and so it's going to have an effect in our lives but when we start talking about the word as a thought expressed and really we go back to a word before we go to the word and I looked up that that that that that word word and and the dictionary says it's a single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing so from a human side from a from a civilization side when we talk about word it's limited to speech and it's limited to what is written down amen but when we look into the word of God we see that word means so much more when we go into the scriptures in John 1 1 and this is a very familiar scripture to us I know it says in the beginning was the word so we are not just talking about a word because we can say a lot of words we can confess a lot of words but what we're interested in now this evening and over these next few services in particular is the word amen and there's a big difference and we'll get into that in a moment but it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him who the word and without him the word was not anything made that was made amen so it's the word the word the word it starts with the word and it's going to finish with the word we've talked about that we're supposed to be a word bride amen it is Alpha and Omega the start is the same as the finish so it's going to be a word bride that's represented exactly the way that he has it right here amen the word that was in the beginning is the word that's going to be expressed in the end it says in him who the word was life and the word the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not that word comprehend doesn't mean it didn't understand it it meant it could not overcome it amen that when the word comes in it brings light and the light cannot overcome that word or the darkness cannot overcome that word amen it cannot overcome the life or the light of that word for what is Darkness Darkness is merely the absence of life we don't have a flash dark we only have a flashlight if you don't turn the light on you have Darkness but as soon as light comes in darkness by definition disappears because it's the opposite of light so if light is there then Darkness can't live and it's the same thing for life if life is there death itself cannot live either I mean it cannot be present and so it says that when the word comes then Darkness goes away and life and light rain in its place then we jump down to verse 14 it says and the Word was made flesh so in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God it created all things and then it says the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen that's a very good attribute to know by whether something is the word or not that it's full of grace and is full of truth because it's the first thing we received was Grace and he followed right up behind it with truth didn't he amen that's what he came to us for with was to set us free and to give us that truth so we walked we to opened with a word but John takes us very quickly to the word and there's a difference because the human mind will limit what that word is but when we look into the scriptures we see that the word is the combined elements or attributes of God that are written that are spoken that are visible that are invisible that are living that are inanimate all of which express the nature and purpose of God so you can look around you that's why brother Brandon would say you don't even have to preach to people all they have to do is look around them and they will see the evidence of God they look up into the sky you go out into the Rocky Mountains sometime and you'll say there is a God Amen you see what happens on the sunshine on the sunsets I take all these pictures you know of of Nature and these sunsets and you look at one of those and you say there has to be a God Amen the beauty of it the the way the world works the way the earth works the way nature works the way that life comes forth all of it express a greater mind than this could ever come by chance amen so that the whole creation speaks that there is something greater than what we see amen and that is the word because before it ever existed the word was and the word will always continue to be even when this is is gone and burnt to ashes amen the prophet of God would say now the first place he's speaking of the scriptures and he says the first place we must realize that this is God's word okay that is our absolute right now amen he says this is the foundation this is the blueprint this is where God lives this is his word and this is God Amen if it disagrees with this then you are not talking to God he is not talking to you he is not inspiring you if you mess with this then God is not a part of it amen he cannot disagree with his word because this is him in written form if you want to know what God is then this is going to tell you I mean this is where we start brother Branham said if you want to get close to God he said read your Bible and pray notice he didn't just say pray because there's many spirits we'll answer you if you pray but if you read your Bible and pray you'll know the spirit that's responding to you amen amen in the beginning was the word and that word was ever before though a Bible existed right before God even existed in a visible form there was the word and that's what he was identified was was the word and then brother Brown talks of that light that he created and God stepped forth into that and he stepped out of what Elohim and he stepped into a body that we call the son of God Amen and it's the same God it's no different amen but so that we could understand it in a human way he called it his son because it was not the self-existing one now it was in a created body something that came out of him and the closest thing we can relate that to as a child so he says this is the Son of God but it's still the same God amen amen there's no difference between the two of them it's not another God it's not a second God it's just God stepping into a form and it was light in the beginning and then in the beginning was that great light that we talked about that God created and stepped into amen but it was an expression of God's power and God's purpose and God's form and God's nature even in that light because his very nature is light it brings what it brings things to light it it opens things up it allows us to see them that's his nature is to let us see things to understand things amen but then we read in verse 14 here and John says the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it doesn't say a portion of the word it says the word the fullness of God stepped into a body and that body had a name called Jesus Christ and that is the name of God to the believer amen he identified himself in that body as the word and the Word was expressed fully in that body as much as it could ever be in a body amen so we're speaking on this idea of the word is a thought expressed but we don't just want to limit ourselves to this or to what is said to the preaching of the word to the speaking of the word even to the confession of our mouth of the word but we want to recognize that the word is so much greater than all of that amen it cannot contradict itself but God is so much bigger than just that Bible amen then just the words that we say or or the things that we understand he's so much greater we can't even comprehend it amen but he gave us enough here to get us through to the end didn't he May brother Brandon would say this he says if we would think the very Earth that we're living on this morning is the word of God he says that tree is the word of God and you your body is the word of God God spoke it into existence like that made it from nothing which had nothing he made something out of nothing amen and that's not just a literal thing that's a that's a Transfiguration amen he made something out of nothing in my life but he says you are the word you're the very fact that you exist the very fact that you have a functioning body is the word and it's an expression he says of God's nature and God's purpose the trees the Earth the Rocks everything of nature it all declares the word because it's one big picture of what and who God is amen but it extends all the way to us it better extend to us amen we can't leave the word as just an external thing where we go and we say well this is only the word no the word is here too the word of God is neither even in thy mouth we are the Temple of the Living God Amen the word has to become something that we identify with right not just by belief but as experience amen that something inside of us says I'm the same thing as what I'm reading as what I'm looking at that the god that is out there is now inside me and he's having a purpose and a plan in my life and he's doing things through me amen talking about it is good we want to talk about the word we want to say the word amen it's better than not talking about it that's for sure amen but it has to go beyond that amen and we have to catch as we've been preaching on so much in this we have to catch the inspiration of God to know how to use that word to know how it's applied yeah amen Peter talks about this now Peter was a simple man Peter wasn't a well-trained well-educated man like Paul was but yet you show me a man that have more power than Peter amen it didn't keep him his Simplicity did not heat him keep him from the power and authority of the believer in his life of the power of the holy spirit in his life it meant great signs and wonders follow Peter wherever he went to the point where as he crossed people they would stand or sit in his shadow and they would be healed by it amen so we're not getting out of here because we have an understanding of the word amen that's not what's going to get us out of here we want to understand it but we want to understand in the context of what it's supposed to do in our lives and what God wants us to do with it just having an understanding of the doctrines of this message that have been revealed to us the Loose Ends that have been tied up that's not what's going to take us out that's right because the letter killeth and in the end doctrines are only letter but it's a spirit that giveth life amen and that's what we're talking about if he's got a body it's got to have a life and that life better be the Holy Spirit but Peter's talking about Paul because he struggled with Paul Peter had struggled to capture the things that Paul was talking about he says an account that the long-suffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you as also in all his Epistles speaking in them of these things he says in which are some things hard to be understood listen we're not all going to grasp the great mysteries of this message I don't believe in terms of the the understanding and the the mental manipulations that maybe have to happen in the the deeper things of God we don't all have to understand that Hattie Wright never understood the Seven Seals but yes she got what she asked for amen we're not going in just on understanding of Doctrine and Peter says there's some things that Paul talks about they're hard to understand now Watch What Happens though people take things that are hard to understand he says which they that are unlearned and unstable rest not rest as in are at peace but rest which means they forcibly pull it or manipulate it they try and make it work he says they're alarming and I'm stable they rest it as they do also the other scriptures it's all of it they're struggling to make happen it's all of it they're struggling to get to work the way they think it's supposed to and it says what it leads them onto their own destruction amen so you cannot get there by your own work you cannot get there by your own understanding amen Peter though A Simple Man knew what this meant and he knew what the power of God was and he knew what God wanted done with his word amen amen amen but he says people are getting caught up in these doctrines these things that Paul's talking about and they're trying to make it do what they think it should do and what happens he says it leads to their own destruction it leads to their downfall and I think that's what we've seen around the message so often is people have gotten so tight and and so deep into things and they've forgotten that it's only God that can give you Revelation and they get to the point where they get so so twisted up and they lead others astray and they lead themselves astray and all of a sudden you're wondering what happened to them what is it they tried to rest it they tried to manipulate they tried to wrestle it that's where the word wrestle comes from rest to try and force it into something that will work for them and it's not going to do it that way right it reminds me of the seven sons of Siva they said they tried to cast out demons by Jesus whom Paul preaches right you can't go up to Things based on the god that brother John or brother Gerald preaches or any other minister you got to be in contact with that God yourself amen otherwise what's it going to do it's going to kick you out amen it's going to overcome you because you're relying on something other than the spirit that is within you to overcome it amen amen what's the problem they don't have the mind of Christ right there they're wolves among sheep they're coming in to try and make something happen to try and prove themselves to try and get the benefit of the word without the surrender and the relationship that must follow amen it's got to be there and we'll get into that maybe in the next series we're going to go into amen are they sincere many are I believe they are sincere sincerity is not the that's not our goal though our goal is inspiration and Revelation amen because how many people are sincerely wrong today not just you know around maybe the circles of the message but but also in the world I mean they're sincerely wrong they think they're doing the right thing and they're doing the exact opposite thing amen the goal is to have truth not just a sincere opinion and man I've got lots of opinions and guess what they'll get me if I had them in 100 bucks I'd have 100 bucks that's what they're worth it's just an opinion this is a sincere opinion is not worth any more than an unsincere one is if it's wrong amen so we're seeking after truth and we we spoke about this in the last service where truth is what truth is the will of God for your life and your circumstances I don't need to know what it is for Ellie's life I need to know what it is for mine and for my family and those that are under my authority amen you need to know it for yours and I need to know it for mine amen the problem is is that what we found is that it's a world of ideology not a world of an absolute because what we have is an absolute and the thing that ideology is is it's a theory that's unproven right and it sounds great but the minute it starts to impact Our Lives all of a sudden we say well maybe I don't quite believe it that same way haven't we seen it with climate change and all all of the the expenses and the taxes that come with it and everybody wants to save the world save the world and we're going to die and we're going to die and then they spend third I have to spend 30 cents more on a liter of gasoline all of a sudden they say you know what I'm not too worried about the climate now because this is uncomfortable for me but when you're looking at an absolute if it brings you into something uncomfortable you say well this is the way it's got to go because this is proven this is truth this is life to me so I'll go the way of the of the hard few that are chosen amen and I'll stick with it no matter what happens we want to know the truth we read the scripture last service that said that we know all things and we saw how that meant that we know what we need to know for our lives we don't know everything I don't know everything for you and you don't know everything for me and I don't know everything there is to know but God has given us the holy spirit so that we know what to do and how to handle things in our life and to know what he wants done with his word more importantly if I could put it that way listen we're all bold when the crowd is behind us we're all bold when we're sitting in front of our phone or typing on our computer but the minute it steps into our life how many of us will stick with what we believe if you've got an absolute you're going to stick with it won't you if you've got an absolute if that is the only thing that you hold true you're going to stick with it but if it's an ideology what happens as soon as the trial or the pain comes then you bend and you let it Flex right it twists it allows you to get out of that that impact that it's having on your life right the truth doesn't change and an absolute does not change an absolute can only be the truth because truth doesn't change and it absolute never changes either if you're in quality control they always have an absolute they always have a fixture they always have something that's perfect as perfect as you can get they have something that is the the measuring stick they have something that is the perfect implementation or production that you're looking for and they compare everything to that that's what the absolute is that's what we're comparing to is the thing that doesn't change the thing that is perfect and for us that is the word of God Amen listen to what the prophet of God said this this quote it made me stand up he says now that's the reason where the church is in the condition it is tonight it's been man LED and not spirit-led he's talking about the nominal church I believe Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God the spirit of God is to lead the church he says now man might say anything but the holy spirit will tell the truth on you I like how he says he'll tell the truth on you not just to you he won't just give you the truth but he'll say Jonathan you're lacking in an area you're not Towing the line today you're slacking off a bit you need to move this out of your life you need to step up to a higher plane you've got a problem you've got an addiction you're tied down with this you need to break off here he'll tell the truth on you why because you're a child of his that's why he'll do it because the child is the only one that's chastised by the father amen the holy spirit will tell the truth on you he won't let you get away with thinking that you're okay when you're not I mean that's how you know when you're sitting on the truth is that it doesn't leave you where you are amen it's always moving you forward it's always taking you away from the world and closer to the word of God every single time amen that's life to us listen if we go out of a service and we say that didn't impact me then we've got a problem because he never leaves us in the same place brother Brown said if you're you're never standing still you're either going forward or you're backsliding there is no standing still so if you come out of a service you come out of a day and you say I didn't go forward and I didn't go backward then you're lying to yourself amen you got to go see whether you actually made up some ground or whether you lost some ground for that day amen John 6 63 says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profit of nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen this has to be life to us this word has to be life to us it's not just something that's outside of us but it's a life that's inside of us amen and it's pushing out it's pressing out it's flowing out like that Fountain of Life that we sing about amen we're still talking about a speaking bride in all of this and we hear that phrase speak the word and so often it's a rallying cry for believers you go to special meetings and they're they're saying Speak the word speak the word and we ought to speak the word amen but you will find that what we believe speaking the word is and what it actually is are usually two very different things amen amen and we'll get into that over the next couple of services but the problem is is that we speak the word and then it doesn't happen and we're disappointed or we're frustrated or we're hurt or we're offended or we're left wondering and we're down-hearted because it's supposed to come to pass we say I spoke the word I spoke the word and nothing happened but as we look at what that's going to mean we understand that the word is the expression of the thoughts and purpose of God it doesn't mean just say what the Bible says as we read last service sorry brother Bram says the bride knows what to do with the word right it's not just blindly repeating quotes and repeating scriptures as if that's suddenly going to do it but you've got to catch the mind of God and the will and purpose of God in your life so that when you speak the word you're not speaking just the word but you're catching the mind and the thought of God for the situation and that's what speaking the word is is that you're speaking his words that he's given you not just the random selection of words that you picked out of the Bible that morning amen does that make sense we want to speak it with inspiration which comes by Revelation which gives us faith that produces what we speak in the first place amen because it's from him it's not ours it's not our mind it's not us choosing to to step away from pain or discomfort but it's us saying Lord what do you want for me in this situation and you'll stay there as long as he wants you to stay there and then when it's time to be done with it guess what you'll speak the word and it'll move amen but we've got to be willing to stay the course until he gives us the inspiration to move on from it we open with the scripture last service in the service before in second Corinthians it says we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak and I want to point out three things here that this requires one thing a spirit and it requires a spirit of Faith amen and that can only be the Holy Spirit when it comes to the word of God Amen you have to have a spirit of Faith which is the holy spirit we have to believe what he says and we have to speak what he says amen amen and then you have to have the right Spirit you have to believe what the spirit gives to you and you have to speak what the spirit gives to you and there are different levels of this and there's different applications of it and I want to start with the most basic of that and that is to recognize the word in the first place if I could put it that way amen so in mark one it says there came a leper to him Jesus beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean and Jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him I will be thou clean and as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed now I want to ask you something was that leper full of the Holy Spirit no the Holy Spirit wasn't yet given was it was that leper a sinner in our probability yes he was a Jew but yet nonethelessly sinner amen was that leper you know a key member of his church not as far as they know he would have been an outcast from everybody amen this is a nobody that has nothing to offer and then he doesn't come to Jesus on the basis of who he is all he says is if you want to you can heal me so he's coming to Jesus not on the basis of who the leper is but he's coming on the basis of who he believes Jesus is why because he's read his Bible he remembers from when he's a boy when they're used to preach Psalms 103 and they would say bless the Lord who healeth all thy diseases and when he recognizes the Lord has come when the word is in his presence then he says that means that healing has to be available to me amen that he will remember Moses words in Exodus 15 that said I am the Lord that healeth thee amen and he saw the Lord standing before him he recognized the word made flesh and he says if that's the word made flesh if that is truly the Son of God then that means healing has to be available amen and all I've got to do is go up and ask him amen he's not sitting there saying I'm a great person I'm a faithful believer I've served you all my life and my family's in order and no no no he says if you want to you can heal me amen you can make me clean he doesn't have a big discussion about how hurt he's been and how her life has been because God has not moved by our emotions but he's moved by faith and revelation of who and what he is amen and that's the basis that this leper comes to him amen a sinful man nothing special comes to him and says if you want to you can heal me amen and what did Jesus say I will I want to heal you and he says what be thou clean and immediately immediately the leprosy left him amen so often as believers we come to him and what are we doing we're coming to him on the basis of Who We Are and we ought to I'm not saying that's wrong but we're at the most basic level of speaking the word here and what we're really saying is we've got to recognize the word before we can ever understand who we are we've got to understand who and what he is and what he came to do and what he's able to do in our lives amen and this leper is purely coming on the basis of who Jesus is and he's saying God you can do it you can do it if you want to do it you can do it and Jesus said I'll do it I want to do it I'm going to do it amen so often we're sitting there and we're saying and we're relying on who we are rather than saying Lord this is a work of Grace and I'm not coming because I'm worthy but I'm coming because you made me worthy to approach amen you said that I am your child you said I can come but regardless just on the basis of your nature of who you are you're able to meet this need no matter what condition I am no matter how high I am no matter how Fallen I am no matter what my life looks like right now Lord in your Sovereign mercy and Grace you can do the work in my life whatever I have need of Lord you can do it because of who you are amen it's the most basic thing to say Lord this is about you anyways amen we come to him because of who he is and then he tells us who and what we are then he tells us what the benefits are he gives us the good things of God but we approach him on the basis of him calling to us of who he is and letting us know what he wants to do in our lives amen Matthew 7 7 says ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you listen the Holy Ghost hasn't been given yet and he's still the same ask you have not because you ask not ask why because the one that will answer is here if you'll only recognize it we don't ever heal a priests being healed back then you know why because they didn't believe who he was you're telling me no priest back then had children that needed diseases healed that there were no infirmities amongst the Priestly ranks at that time of course they were but because they couldn't recognize the word they couldn't get the benefits of the word and yet we have people walking up nobodies absolute nobodies and they come up to him and they say Lord I recognize who you are will you give me the attributes that you are that's all they're asking him to do is display his attributes Amen to fulfill the word if the word is present they're saying then Lord would you give me that portion of the word that you promised would be here verse 8 says for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened for what man is there of you whom if his son has spread will he give him a stone or if you ask a fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven good good give good things to them that ask him Jesus healed a leper that had enough courage and Faith to come up and ask him and that's all it took that's all it took to ask him to say Lord I recognize who you are will you touch me and he says I will be thou clean amen then Jesus comes back and he says listen how do you treat your children when they come to ask you for something if you have the means to supply what they're asking for how many of you hold back that's where a fish do you give him a serpent if they're hungry for bread do you give them a rock no none of us do we give them whatever we have that can meet the need and he says look if you doing that being evil in your base nature he says how much more a God who is good a God who is great A God who is who is merciful a God who is gracious how much more is he going to do that and give the good things to those that ask him amen amen later on in John 16 he says hitherto have you asked nothing in my name in my name now he's saying there's a difference he says ask and you shall receive that your joy may be half full sometimes we stop at the halfway mark promise is not halfway the promise is not enough joy to just get you out of your bed in the morning the promise is not just to get you through your day it says that your joy may be full amen if it's not full it's not because he won't do it it's because you're not asking that you're not staying there that you're not trusting enough for him to give you the fullness that he promised of your joy amen but half full not part way he can do the full thing he can give you the full meal deal if you'll ask him amen I want to jump to a second story and I love this because it shows the Simplicity of faith brother Brandon would talk about this story so many times and it's in mark five it says behold there came one of the rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him now this is not we're not talking about Jairus now but I want you to catch something because brother Aaron Oglesby when he was here in in the summer he talked to me about this and he pointed out that Jesus is headed to Jairus house okay Jesus is on a mission Jesus is on the road he's moving he's not standing around he's not looking to do a prayer line he's not looking to to sit and have a conversation with everybody but he's looking to go to Jairus house to heal his daughter okay he's got a purpose he's got a plan he's on the Move amen he's striding down the road and as he's going there a crowd surrounds him but it jumped out of me as Aaron was talking to me about these things because it's so often the way it is with us is that we look around the service or we look at the needs in here and we're focused on you know brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so has a great need and so we're putting everything into there and we say that is the need for the service that is the need for the day that is the name we're going to focus on and we leave it at that amen so-and-so needs to be saved so-and-so needs to be filled with the Holy Ghost we need healing we need this we need that and we put everything into them we say and as soon as anything starts to happen in the service we say well that's for them and that's all we do is we focus on them that's not the way it has to be amen God's not limited to just the one great need in our congregation amen he's not limited just because one person has such a a great desire for him but this is something that all of us can tap into amen that he's here for every single one that's here amen it doesn't matter how big or small it is in comparison to the need that maybe you're thinking about you know we think so and so needs a real experience so they need to repent or they need to get baptized and that's greater than my need listen there is no big or small need right if you're his child then your needs matter to you I remember my wife was talking to me about this in the past week and she said when I was so young even before a teenager I would talk to God and I would ask him for little things and he would give them to me every time it doesn't matter the greatness or the smallness of it if it matters to you and you're sincere I believe it matters to him as well amen so don't limit him and don't limit yourself when he's in there when he's in your presence amen when you're around him when you know that he's in the building when you know that he's in the room don't just say well that's for somebody else let it be for you too because what what Watch What Happens here because of the people throwing around actually listen to this before we go there Luke 12. amen it says there are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them is forgotten before God the little tiny birds sparrows don't matter much in the world there's a bazillion of them you could kill a million today and it wouldn't even make a dent on the population they're everywhere he says every one of them won't be forgotten he says but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered now for some of us that's not many but he says no matter what all the hairs of your head are numbered right fear not there for ye are more value than many sparrows I mean don't be afraid to call on his name amen and don't stop because somebody else you feel has a greater need than you do amen don't ever let somebody's need stop you from approaching the Throne of God don't ever let them don't ever let that somehow overwhelm you to the point where you leave your needs unspoken when he's in the building and he's doing great things among us amen moral a part of his bride it's not just their moments It's Our Moment amen it's for all who will come it's all who are here he doesn't come in the building just for the one but he comes in for every single one that has a need but look what happens now he's on his road to Jairus house to heal his daughter and listen it says that a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years now listen she's had it 12 years she could have gone 12 years in a day you'd think right because he's on his way to heal a girl that's about to die that's a little more important maybe we would say near death is probably more important than a condition that hasn't killed her yet but yet she has no problem approaching Jesus it says she had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse now we're talking about her but let me take it to your life because there's many of us are dealing with things and we've had situations in our life and we've suffered many things and we continue to suffer many things despite many people trying to help us amen despite being to many doctors being under many Ministries going to many churches we've had 17 ministers pray for us we've tried books we've tried diets we've tried programs we've tried this we've tried that and nothing has helped us and in fact maybe we're worse than we started out does that stop her from approaching Jesus sometimes the problem is that we've been through it all and we haven't been to him yet we've been through every mediator we can think of we've been through every access point we can think of but it's always been through somebody rather than directly to him amen you've done everything you can you put your faith and trust in so many things and you've said none of it has worked and I'm worse than when I started I'm hoped it's hopeless there's no point to me even looking for it believing for it I've done everything I can and nothing's happened that's this woman verse 27. when she had heard of Jesus now when she heard a Brother John not when she heard of the disciples not when she heard of brother Gerald not when she heard a brother Branham when she heard of Jesus what did she do she came in the press behind him and she touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole this wasn't something she just thought scripture says she said if I can but touch his clothes I will be made whole what did she do she said what she was thinking she recognized the word striding down that road to jairus's house and she said if I can get a hold of the word made flesh it'll have an effect on me it'll do what it is supposed to do amen she said I don't need to have a conversation don't need to tell him my great need all I need to do is touch him and any of us might have said to her don't slow him down he's got a bigger need than yours she said I don't need to slow him down I just need to touch him as he's going by my wife has told the story many times to to different ones and I I'm sure I'm okay to say tonight we were in Texas and they're they're they they are called a prayer line and she was in the prayer line behind another sister and that sister was was being prayed for and they were laying hands on her and just uh just it was like a wind just swept through right up there on that that platform and that woman in front of her had a great need and that woman's need was met but as that breeze passed through which was the angel the presence of God in that very building my wife got exactly what she needed right then and she walked up to the minister and he asked her what she needed prayer for and she said I don't why because in the presence of the word she was healed without ever having to touch amen just the presence of the Angel of the Lord there healed her instantly gave her what she was looking for met her need without her ever having to be laid on by with hands from the preacher amen listen to this woman she said if I may but touch his clothes I'll be made whole verse 29 says and straightway the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague I want you to catch something here because in verse 30 he says and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto him thou seeest the multitude throng in thee and say a thou who touched me they said everybody's around you everybody's touching you what do you mean who touched me sometimes we're in service and then and they're they're screaming and they're shouting and there's dancing and there's praising and there's crying and we're looking around and we're saying everybody's touching Jesus how can I ever get through maybe they are maybe they aren't amen the rain falls on the just and the unjust but you'll see that Jesus knows when somebody touches him with faith rather than just touches him amen there's a difference to him so don't let the fact that other people are louder that other people are more expressive that other people seem to be getting something more than you are getting hold you back because all you got to do is touch him in the way that brings you what you need amen whatever your faith says you need to do say Lord that's all I need today I'll approach you in my way Lord and I believe you'll respond in the faith that I have for you you amen she didn't need him to lay hands she didn't need to hear a word she said if I can just touch him that'll do the work what is it the word made flesh would have the effect that she needed in her life amen but the woman fearing and trembling he looked around about to see who had done this thing sorry yes verse 32 and he looked around about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her already a finished work came and fell down before him and told him all the truth she gives him a testimony now she tells him why she came what she said in her heart and then she says I'm Healed and he said unto her daughter thy faith thy faith hath made the whole go in peace and behold of thy plague listen what's what faith did she have was it the faith of Jesus he said thy faith he said you decided what was going to have the effect you decided the way this was going you knew who I was and so you decided the path it was going to take and as soon as you touch me your faith made you whole who's power hers no her faith his power amen she recognized the word expressed in front of her and said that word in flesh has all the power I need if I can but touch him with faith it'll have the effect that I'm looking for amen didn't matter that she'd interrupted him didn't slow him down a bit didn't keep him from healing Jairus daughter did it but she touched him on the way and he was willing to stop and acknowledge that and say you're good to go don't ever have to worry about it Go in peace amen behold of thy plague and it ever bothered her again what was it she recognized Isaiah 61 that he came to heal the brokenhearted to set the captives free to break them out of prison she'd been in a prison for 12 years with no hope of ever breaking out of that disease in her life amen but what on the basis of who Jesus was not her worthiness not who she was related to not whose Ministry she sat under she said just because I know who he is if I can but touch him that's all I need to do and it'll be a finished work this is the lowest level there is and it's recognizing who he is sometimes I think we're trying to do it up here and we just have to do it down here you know because well we've read a message that that shows us a higher way a greater way and it is a greater way but it requires sometimes more faith than we have and so sometimes our faith has to come back to who he is rather than pretending that we've got all the faith to recognize who we are sometimes amen we don't always have it we don't always recognize who we are we don't always have the faith in who we are to come and lay claim but we can always go in the faith of who he is if we have a true revelation of what the word is amen I'm going to take one more as we start to close here this is Matthew 8 and it says and when Jesus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him now this one will make you stop and think about it a bit because the other ones were Jews there are of his lineage you know they were people of the faith they were the Seed of Abraham by the blood now he's got an occupier coming in now he's got a man with the authority of Rome behind him now he's got a man that controls part of that City in the name of a pagan emperor and now he comes up and he's asking for a favor what will we do because we look at that Centurion and say you're definitely not worthy you're an oppressor of my people you're an occupier in a land that's not yours you're holding them back amen you you force them to carry your stuff you steal from them you do things you ought not to do to them as a conqueror and yet this man comes up and it says he came beseeching begging for Jesus to help him if you look in the other versions of this in the Scripture it says that first he sends out the church Elders to talk to Jesus so this is a man with some character he was well thought of by the Jews because they came to Jesus and said he's a good guy I'm paraphrasing that's not in the scripture but they said this is a good man he's he's one that that they would say would be worthy of your time that he's been kind to us he's been good to us amen but yet he's still an occupier he's a pagan as far as we know he's a Roman but yet look at the approach he has here as he comes in and he doesn't come in with a sword he doesn't come in with all a hundred of us men behind him and grab up Jesus and say come in and heal my servant or else but he comes in beseeching he comes in pleading amen he's asking he comes in humility is what he does amen a soldier a man in command comes in in humility and that's what gets him into what he needs from God Amen that's the key brother Brown said humility is power with God and then we're going to read some quotes on it brother bam says you know people want power and really they don't know what power is see they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him he says that's real power you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogancy a church just a sweet Humble Church and I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it amen that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God letting God just work through us he says you don't have to make a lot of noise it amazes me when I'm listening to the message of the hour and brother branham's there and he's going through prayer lines I was listening to One in in hum or in um presuming and he he prays for about 45 minutes and you know what he's not shouting it down he's not lifting it up he's not screaming he's just calmly praying time and time and time again why because he knew who he was he knew what his commission was and he knew that God was there to back him up he didn't have to yell it out you didn't have to shout it out in fact we don't really see that in the scriptures we don't see them yelling and shouting to cast things out they look at it and they rebuke it and they say get out and it gets out just like that whether it's sickness whether it's demons whatever we want to talk about that simple word of authority doesn't have to scream and shout listen when our boss comes and tells us to do something does he have to scream and shout shouldn't have to why because he knows who he is or she is as the case may be amen same thing with Jesus and same thing with a real Christian Bill Graham says we find today that the church yet teaching its power and teaching the signs to follow the believer yet we find them puffed out big me little you and that it isn't like the early church you see they were humble and kind to one another and sweet understanding and it's so much different today and I wonder if a lot of this isn't hasn't sidetracked us from the real kernel of the message that we want to Humble ourselves he says the more humbler you can be the better God will use you hey man can you imagine if that Centurion walked up with a hundred of his soldiers and said you come or else what would Jesus have done laughed he did probably just ignored him right why Jesus didn't respond to that sort of thing he didn't flare up didn't need to but I guarantee you that guy's servant wouldn't have been healed because he came with a sword in his hand and tried to force Jesus to do it amen but why didn't he come that way because his faith was that Jesus was a part of the Supernatural and he may not have understood who and what he was but he believed that that man had power and he believed that that man had Authority and so he came to him asking because he himself didn't have that Authority he could command menk but he couldn't command diseases but he believed that Jesus had that Authority that he needed Matthew 8 says in verse 6 says insane so he came beseeching he's he's begging Jesus he says Lord Lord I was reading in my devotions this morning where it's talking about Jesus and Judas and when Judas comes to betray Jesus what does he call him master and in the in the footnote there it said that Judas never called Jesus Lord in Scripture why didn't recognize who he was and yet a a pagan Centurion comes to him and calls him Lord amen that tells you what he believed Jesus was he believed that he was more than a man that's for sure amen amen he says Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him it's so simple ask and you'll receive in humility Jesus says I'll come and heal him can you imagine if they had Twitter that day Jesus agree agrees to heal the servant of the oppressor right it it'll lit up Twitter it'll lit up Instagram and Facebook they'd have jumped all over him for helping the Centurion because he was an occupier that wasn't supposed to be there right I thought he was supposed to free us and now he's going to help them out what kind of Messiah is this says the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed we've talked about speak the word I want you to catch something before Jesus can speak the word the Centurion has to open the door he has to open the door for the supernatural doesn't he says look you don't have to come to my house why he said I'm not worthy he knew it could cause trouble for Jesus he didn't want to cause trouble with Jesus and his own people by going into what a Roman's house he says my house isn't clean it's not worthy it's not sanctified I'm not serving the god that you serve he says you don't don't come into my house I'm not worthy the house is not suited for you he says but what speak the word only in my servant shall be healed that's an amazing thing when he has as much consideration for that man as he does for his own servant where he says listen I don't want to cause trouble just say it and it'll happen I believe you brother Brahm says I like the attitude of this Centurion tonight that we've just read of he was a man that felt unworthy don't let unworthiness hold you back we're all unworthy scripture says Thou Art Worthy Amen to take the buck and loose the seals that are there on he says as long as you're feeling Unworthy of the blessing you're asking you're pretty apt to get it but when you get to a place where you think God just owes it to you that's when you're mistaken we're in debt to God not God in debt to us we're indebted to God and this Roman Italian whatever he was he said Lord I'm not worthy that you come under my roof and neither thought I thought I worthy to come to face you because remember he sent the elders first he didn't even consider himself worthy to even ask but when Jesus came close he said whoa I got to go keep him from coming to my house that's not going to be good for him in other words I send your church to meet you and to ask this question but I have faith I know that you're a man under Authority for I'm under Authority you don't have to come down to my house to put your hands on my servant you don't have to come here and say any prayer he says notice now be sure to get this he said I'm a man under Authority also and if I say to this man you go do it he will do it now if I say to this man you come here he'll come I'm under Authority and them who are under me has to obey me and he knew that was the son of God and that every sickness and every demon was under him sometimes we're sitting here and we doubt that it's under us go to the one that you know it's under then amen if you don't have faith in who you are go to the one that you have faith in that does heaven scripture says it's under our feet everything's under our feet amen but he's the head go to the head if you're not trusting your part amen because they're definitely under his feet he says and all he had to do is just speak the word not pray just speak the word that's all and it will be done because every demon would have to obey him do you believe that tonight he says every demon will obey God it has to everything obeys God but he closes out he says and it will obey you if you have faith we continue the Centurion says for I'm a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth into another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it now when Jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel Prophet God would say this is the perfect expression of Faith to the Gentile bride he says because the Jews required a laying out of hands he says but the Gentiles said speak the word but remember to speak the word was to Jesus not to the Centurion the Centurion just say didn't say let me speak and he said Lord you speak it and that's when I know what's going to happen but this is the perfect expression of faith in The Believer but yet we have Mark 16 these different ones that say if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover why because there's Faith to cover it no matter what there's Grace there's a way for everything that we need you don't have to always have high Faith you just have to come believing in whatever way that you want to go to God and he'll meet your need as long as it's according to the word amen he says I have not found Faith so great no not in Israel and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and as thou Hast what believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self-same hour as thou Hast believed wasn't all in his head was it because he said just speak the word only yeah and he'll be okay what he said he expressed what he believed Jesus was capable of doing and Jesus said you're right I can't and I will and then he did it and it happened exactly the way he wanted it to happen amen why he said I'm unworthy I'm unworthy he was unworthy I'm unworthy you're unworthy don't rest on your on your worthiness amen you're not always going to feel worthy when you have needs amen sometimes when we're feeling the least Worthy is when we have the greatest need isn't it whether it's in our spirit whether it's in our emotions in our relationships when things just don't seem to be going right and we sit there and we feel unworthy and yet that's when we need him the greatest listen if it didn't stop a centurion don't let it stop you amen amen that wasn't even a child of God as far as We Know as far as we know we don't ever hear anything of them chances are he just went on doing what he was always doing but yet God met his need how much more will he do it to a child of God that comes to him and is he going to heal the the the the the the servant of a centurion and leave your child or your family out there with no touch no Deliverance no healing no mercy no Grace no of course not he said if I'll do it if I'll take care of the sparrows then I'm certainly going to take care of my own children amen while he came that we might have life and more abundantly that our joy may be full as I said not half full full that there's a greater portion there's a greater measure if we'll only ask him for it if he'll only stay there and trust him to do it amen where his children and God expects more of us he does we know that and sometimes that's the thing that holds us back as we're sitting there we're saying but I'm not what I think I should be listen you're where God wants you to be and if you're not then he'll get you where he needs you to be so don't sit there saying I'm not wire ought to be listen he's your father he's given you the tutor of the Holy Spirit he's the one that's giving you the word he's the one that's giving you the ministry to perfect you you'll be where you need to be when you need to be it amen so don't sit there and say I'm not ready I'm not worthy and I can't go to him listen if your life is under the blood of Christ if you've repented of all things and your conscience is clear you can go to him with any need that you have today amen not on the basis of your worthiness but because you recognize who and what he is and that you're a part of his great plan that you're a part of the very word that you confess him to be amen amen Jesus said if thou can'tst believe all things are possible what brother Branham say was the theme of his ministry Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said my Ministry is to declare him that he's here amen he didn't say my Ministry is to declare you that you're worthy even though he did he says my Ministries to declare him that he's here and then what did he talk about the unrecognized presence of God amen how many walk by Jesus and never recognized who he was a good man a great man a prophet but they didn't recognize the word and flesh and they missed out on a blessing every time amen how much more are we out to be able to come to the throne of grace then amen if a leper can come if an unworthy Centurion can come then why can't a child of God come I mean if he's bid you come if he's told you to ask if he's told you to come that your joy may be full that you might have life more abundantly what would hold us back man what is it that would keep us from coming to him and asking for these things amen so much is when we're focused on Who We Are and we forget that this is about who he was who he is and that we're a part of him that we're identified with him remember he read there and maybe we didn't read it I read so many things these days I forget where I read them but brother Brown talked about he said when he was on the cross you were with the cross with him when he walked this Earth You you were with him when he was whipped on the post you were whipped with him he says you are identified with him all and your your worthiness was in him and then he took the shame and the reproach and everything on him and gave you his righteousness so that you could stand before him you're standing in front of him not because of your worthiness but because he made you worthy that he gave you his very own righteousness so that you could stand before him what the Spotless bride of Christ amen God bless you let's stand if you would this evening I want to read one more scripture just as the musicians are coming it's Hebrews 11 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to him to God Must Believe first that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him what holds us back so often is we think he's not going to answer that he's not going to listen that he's not going to hear that he's not going to give us what we have need of Jesus says you come like that it's not going to work you've got to believe that he is and then you've got to believe that he's going to reward those that diligently seek after him amen that woman you got to imagine the the woman with the issue of blood she's got a whole crowd standing around him guess what she didn't start right next to Jesus she had to fight her way through that crowd just to where she could just Touch the Hem of His Garment she had to fight her way there but she believed if she could get to him then he would meet the need amen amen how much more us you don't even have to fight we're here we're here at a time and in a place that's dedicated to his worship and to his praise you don't have to fight through anybody the only thing you've got to fight through is your own feelings about yourself your own thoughts about yourself the things that Satan tries to cast on us every single day to hold us back from the presence of God because if he can get you looking at yourself he's got you beat every single time but if he can get you looking at the perfect sacrifice that took your place if God can get you to do that nothing's going to hold you back because he's the one that's worthy and you're going to him because the word is the one that's declared him worthy and the one that's declared you worthy to approach the throne amen the scepters out the scepter is out amen the question is will you come forward and touch it and let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord It's a beautiful thing to look in your word or just to look in and see who and what you are Lord that when we recognize the word in our midst Lord then it means that every attribute that's within that word

lift them up this evening Lord and we lift up those that have come here Faithfully this evening Lord God Lord we pray that you would just move amongst us Heavenly Father Lord that those that have been held back by their own thoughts Lord by looking at themselves in the mirror Lord that looking at their lives would think they're unworthy this evening Lord there may be time has gone on and they've seen no change but Lord may they look to you the great author and finisher of our faith Lord the mighty healer amongst us the great deliverer Jehovah Jireh and Lord may they trust that the word is
