healthy and hail amen God bless you I know brother Chad's been working he said the last couple nights only had three hours of sleep with the snow clearing and whatnot so we want to remember him and then uh Mary Beth and and Jeremiah I think he said we're also not feeling well and there's a bug going through Canada apparently not just New Finland there's a lot of people that are having some issues so we want to remember them as well God bless you Colossians 1 verse 9 Paul says for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding what's the purpose of this prayer he says that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness amen God bless you you can have your seats again this evening we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost we're taking a a fifth service on how do I know I have received the Holy Holy Spirit and we've been talking about the evidence in last service we set a foundation on the fruit of the Holy Spirit and we took the words of Jesus where he says by their fruits you will know them and so we know who people are based on the fruit of their life and we compare that to what the word says about it amen we know the evidence of the receiving the holy spirit is that you would he he will lead you into all truth he'll lead you into the word and that's so that you can become the word it's not just so we can know the word it's not just so we can we can spew it back out and we can tell people what we know it's but but it's so that we can be the word amen that's what a True Believer is as they become one with the word but as we speak on this this evening and and to be honest we're not even going to get into the fruit of the spirit this evening that's just the way things go sometimes as you dig into it but I want to I want to take us all the way back to Genesis because when we talk about the fruit of the spirit it seems like it's really a new testament thing but when you start looking at being fruitful as Paul talked about in Colossians and fruit bearing if we could put it that way we go all the way back to Genesis and even into the first chapter and we see that being a fruit bearing person was the desire and the purpose of God even for us and so God when he's talking to Adam in in Genesis 1 we see this in Genesis 1:27 it says so God created Man In His Image in the image of God created he him and male and female created he them and God blessed them and said unto them these words be fruitful multiply replace the Earth and subdue it now we're we're preaching on the the fruit of the spirit but I want you to see here that God says I want you to be fruitful and what is that that sign of fruitfulness how do you know if you're fruitful the way God wants you to God saying being fruitful and multiply well what is Adam Adam's a Son of God God's saying produce more sons of God that's how Adam could be known to be successful by the word as if he produced more of God more people that were in the image of God and and then he said on top of that have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so we see the purpose of God here by his word the purpose of God was to produce a family on this Earth and that family on Earth would have dominion but it was not Dominion by force it was not Dominion by conquering it was Dominion by the word amen it was Dominion by the spirit of God working in Men We were supposed to rule because we were children of God not because because we had beaten up and destroyed anything that tried to come after us it was a kingdom of love and peace in the beginning our rulership was in that peace and rest not by strength of our arms or anything like that or weapons that we made it says and then God said behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the Earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there's life I have given every green herb for meat and it was so so God gave from the very beginning this is in perfect life perfect bodies sinless perfect human bodies God gave us food God gave us fruit and that fruit was intended to to benefit the body and I I I don't know exactly why God did it that way and I hate to admit it but the original diet was vegetarian but they enjoyed it so maybe when I'm truly sinless I'll enjoy vegetables and fruit alone because over there we're not going to do those things but but you look here that the fruit of the Earth was what provided for those that were on the earth and it was for the humans it was for the animals it was for every type of living creature and person the fruit that was produced was for their life it was for their body to to to have nutrients and these things Adam had eternal life his body would never have died if he had not fallen in sin amen if he hadn't chosen to sin and yet God had designed these bodies in their perfection to eat and I don't know why maybe it's for pleasure we certainly seem to enjoy eating but we see that even when we go the first thing we do when we leave this earth is do what eat the marriage supper of the lamb and it's not just a quick meal it's three and a half years of eating and in the Millennium we're planting and we're harvesting and we're eating and there are feasts and all of these things and then you go into the New Jerusalem and guess what it's got fruit over there too so fruit is there and it's God's way of doing something in our bodies and and and so in all of this God when he put us here it was to produce fruit it was to be fruitful if I could put it that way but I want you to see something that that fruit that Adam was going to plant and nurture and harvest was not eternal life it was for natural life but that was not eternal life because there was a tree of life that had fruit if we wanted to call it that and that tree was Christ and that is where eternal life came from there was something there for their natural bodies and then there was something there for their soul as well and that was the fruit that really mattered and as long as they were eating from that tree of life then they could always make it through but yet he had a job and that job was to sustain life on this Earth he had to sustain the animals he had to sustain cre by the planting of of the garden and these different things brother Bron would say and I don't have the quote here I just read it in my office he says we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word and to feed on the word he said that in the message who is this mzc so our feeding is not on the fruit that we produce it's to feed on the word it's to feed on Christ that was where eternal life was from but they had a natural body that was sustained by the fruit of the earth it was from the earth it was stained by the Earth if we could put it that way so God says to to to Adam he says you've got to be fruitful in your body you've got to produce more of me he says and you've got to subdue the Earth you have to have dominion over it but watch what the purpose of that Dominion is it says and the Lord took the man Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it so Adam's got a purpose and Adam's got a job so Adam's job is to manage the garden so that the plants are fruitful if it's to make sure that the conditions are right so that botney life can come forth amen so his life's purpose is to reproduce God in flesh and his day job is to make sure that life on Earth continues as it was meant to two different things he's got to feed the the spiritual and he's got to feed the natural if we could put it that way it says and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat God has something for us to eat and he says everything I've given you can eat he says but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so there was trees for food and then there was a tree you weren't allowed to touch we've already covered this in in great detail but the reason I'm going here is because we want to see what we're being redeemed back to if we see what it was in Genesis then we can see what the purpose of fruit is today what the purpose of God is in our lives and these different things and so we're talking about the fruit of the spirit but we want to see what it means to be Pro fruitful in God's eyes and in God's eyes being fruitful was to produce more Sons and Daughters of God that was his original purpose yes God wanted Adam to provide food for himself and for the animals and these different things but God said be per be fruitful in your person and then be fruitful in your labor there's two different things that are going on there and then we saw that Adam and Eve they fell by Disobedience and now their purpose Remains the Same but they've lost the power they've lost the Dominion amen then they they've got a Godly purpose but they've hybrid God's system and so now they've got to struggle in all of these things and it's a battle every day for Adam to produce his fruit amen he might do everything right but because he's lost his Dominion he has no guarantee of the results amen now he's subject to his environment rather than his environment is subject to him you'll see where we're going with this as we go through so he he's a he's a he's supposed to be producing fruit but now he's got storms he's got Sun he's got wind he's got rain and now that's controlling his fruit production in terms of botney life but then he also has circumstances in this fleshly body because he's awakened a carnal desire that he's not supposed to have and now he's what controlled by that as well listen remember we've said before Man Without a be Man without the Holy Ghost is a beast and when man fell from the word of God then the Beast Le nature came out and that's what we're dealing with today and so now Adam is subject to the desires of his body his wife is subject to the desires of her body as well and so Adam has lost a level of control now in order to try and do what God told him to do he's still supposed to be fruitful in every way but now he's struggling to do it he's lost control because he took control Adam didn't choose to take control Adam wasn't looking to take control but when he willingly went against the word of God in effect what he did was he took away the power of God and he had to put his own power in its place and that has led to every failure that we have today and so after the the the fall Adam is going to struggle to produce fruit he's going to struggle to survive he's going to struggle to control his domain and all day every day for the rest of his far shortened life he is going to struggle to produce fruit and if he fails people die if he fails his family's going to die that sounds Grim but that's literally the way it is you know we've we've lost the idea to even comprehend how somebody could die of starvation today because we listen we get we get apples in the middle of winter we can get bananas and blueberries in the middle of the winter we don't comprehend that if you didn't plant and harvest blueberries in the spring and the summer then you weren't going to get them in the winter and if you didn't raise your cows and plant your corn and and hunt and fish and do all these things you died but that's the way it used to be now we've lost that sort of thing amen but if Adam fails in his fruit producing his family dies and he dies with them and it's a serious thing now to not be fruitful and it can happen at the drop of a hat Adam could do everything right he could plant his crops he could weed the ground he could he could set up uh dikes to hold the water and these different things but all it took was just one big infestation of insects and he'd lose his crops he could have a hail stomm and it could wipe out everything that he had put all of his hard work into now he is subject to the conditions around him instead of the other way around and from that time you'll see that God ties His blessings to fruitfulness every time God says if you'll do what I tell you to do you will be fruitful and it was fruit of the uh of the loins it was the children that they would produce in those days if you had a lot of children you were blessed and it was a sign of God's blessing and if you didn't have children it was a sign of God's cursing and then if you had crops and things were going well with the farming and the ranching and these different things it was a sign of God's blessing and if you had no fruit it meant God wasn't with you that was literally the way that God set it up and so you can see as you go through Israel's times in particular they have the ups and the downs I was just reading in 2 Samuel there the other day where it says God sent a drought to Israel because of what they' done to the to the the giban ites I think it was they broke the Covenant with them and God sent a drought for 3 years because they transgressed something God withdrew the fruitfulness of them why because they were off of his word they done something that they they wouldn't but then we come to Jesus time and Jesus puts a real Focus now on being fruitful and we read this last service and remember he said you're going to produce fruit as children of God and they're going to produce fruit as not children of God and there's a difference in your fruit and in their fruit amen theirs might look a lot like yours and yours might look a lot like theirs but there's a difference and the difference is the same as it was supposed to be in the beginning which is your fruit will be my will by my word and theirs will be their will by their word it's going to look like the very same thing but it's not the same thing listen Eve had a Manchild didn't she and it looked just like a Son of God but it wasn't a Son of God one of them was and one of them wasn't but how did you find out who was who you had to look down the road when the fruit came when they brought their offering amen so it's the same as in the Garden of Eden today it's the same thing will you produce fruit by his will and his word or will you do it by your will and your word and remember we read this this is just setting us up this evening he says even so every good tree brings forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is heun down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them then he says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven my will my way that's the way God wants it he says many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I I never knew you depart from you you that work iniquity so they both produced fruit but what was the difference in their fruit the ones that were rejected yes it was fruit but it was completely outside the will of God and to a greater point they denied the will of God so they could do their own thing that was the difference in the two two fruits one was outside the will the word and the revelation of God completely outside the plan of God it was their fruit not God's fruit and then Jesus would come down on this thought on fruit in Matthew and he would preach the parable of the S and that's really where I want to want to spend my time here tonight if it's if it would be the leading of the Lord here because he would talk about a child of God producing out of their life and in Matthew 13 he says he spake many things unto them in Parables saying Behold a swer went forth to sow and when he sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and forth with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth you'll notice the fastest ones to spring up are not the ones that are going to live flash in the pan we used to call it he says and when the sun was up they were scorched because they had no root they withered away and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some 100 fold some 60 fold some 30 fold and then he says he who have ears let him hear now there's one thing that I that jumped out to me as I was reading this and that's that I don't want to be identified with anything before verse 8 I don't want to have anything to do with that those are the ones that don't make it those are the ones that have no purpose those are the ones that don't do any good even though they start in some cases they never finish the race they never come to their purpose amen I don't want to be eaten by birds I don't want to get scorched out I don't want to die because something chokes me out I think choking got to be about the most miserable way to die because you know you're dying and you can't do anything about it until things fade out but then I came to verse eight and you know what I don't want to be anything less than the H hundredfold does anybody here tonight say you know what brother John I'm okay if everybody else produces more fruit of the spirit than I do is anybody here saying you know what I'm okay with 30 I don't believe that ought to be the way that a Believer looks things I don't want to just slide into heaven barely making it with the bare minimum that a Christian can do I don't believe that's what we're supposed to be doing amen nobody truly wants to be last nobody wants to be the Lesser if God places Us in that position that's one thing but I don't think anybody sitting here saying I just want to be the last I don't want to be recognized as anything greater than anybody else I I don't want to have anything more than what I have we look at our life the question is does it scream hundredfold 60-fold or 30-fold though because remember what what Jesus said to the disciples he said the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak and when I look at my life see I can say here real easy it's real easy for me to say I want to be a h hundredfold Christian but when I look at my life then what do my decisions look like are they saying this is a man that wants to have a h hundredfold of the fruit of the spirit in his life or is he kind of middle of the pack 60-fold or is he barely scraping through with 30-fold in his life the desires are strong where's the will where's the power in these things because if we want a great harvest of hfold that means there's got to be something that goes into produce 100-fold that's different than what goes into the 30 that's different than goes into the 60 and I'm not putting this on ourselves this evening but there are things we can do and we'll see that as we go through it but remember what Moses would say he says Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might and then in Ecclesiastes it would say whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might in other words give it give her all you got don't just stand there and say I tried once don't just stand there and say well I've done enough for God don't just stand there and say I've done more than than him or her next to me he says whatever you got give it give him everything you got put everything you've got into it now church if I'm doing everything that I possibly can and I only produce 30 fold then so what I know I've given it my all but if I'm producing 30-fold and I'm barely bumping along guess what there's a problem with this man's attitude we ought not to be sitting here and saying I've done the bare minimum I'm okay with just seeing a little bit of God and so if there's anything I can do to take me from a 30-fold to a 60-fold or 100-fold I would say Lord help me to do that because I want to be a Christian that's serving you with all of my heart my soul and my mind and with all my strength amen but I'm here to tell you there are things that we can do and I'll give you the answer in the very end of this service if you'll stick with me I'll give you what we can do because there there are things we can do that will just absolutely magnify the effect of God inside of our life and it comes from being an understanding of what makes it fruitful but if we look at those verses uh 3 through 7 that we read there and then the verse eight what's the difference in verse eight are there Birds we don't know if there are birds or not all we know is they don't have an effect but we know there's no thorns and thistles there we know there's no rocks in there there's something different about the ground in verse 8 and it's because the scripture says it's good ground there's a difference between those things amen the ground that produces a harvest has been prepared and protected you'll see in those old days see when they when they put the the seed down they would put a net down as well and they put up uh scarecrows and they put up things that would would flash and tinkle and make sounds to scare away the birds but on the side of the road and where the ground isn't prepared they don't try and scare the birds away cuz that's not meant to produce the good ground it's not that it never had rocks it's that the rocks have been removed you go look in this world there ain't no place where the ground is perfect from the start you've got to do something to it amen it's not that the ground never had Thorns or thistles but those have been removed they've been plowed under good ground isn't always good ground but there's a work that's been done to make it good ground and that's the difference between those things a farmer that wants good ground has to do a lot of work before it becomes good ground you know here in newf land you know the best thing we grow rocks that's right sister Brenda the best thing we grow nobody grows rocks like we do in in New Finland and I remember when we used to live in killbride and sometimes we'd drive down into the gouls and you'd see the farmers there in the spring and what do they have there every spring theyve got a rock pile in the old day us to see the pictures they'd have a horse hooked up to a sledge and they'd be throwing the rocks that grew through the winter all it is it's just the Frost takes it and it pushes it up is what's happening okay they're not growing rocks we know this but what are they doing they're taking Rocky ground and they're turning it into good ground but it takes work it takes effort there's a lot of Sweat Equity that they have to put into this amen and then when those rocks are out now they can start using the real tools which is the plows because when the springtime comes you know if you've ever looked at your lawn anybody looked at their lawn right now doesn't have a lot of grass in it for most of us brother Bob's old La would still have grass and brother Marx would have grass mine is mostly moss and clover and some other ragged weeds but when you come to the spring the first thing that grows is not the grass is it church it's everything but the grass and so these farmers are no different in our lives are no different when you're getting ready to turn it into good ground there's going to be lots of stuff that will take away your nutrients and take away what you put into that ground if you don't flip it and so they'll come into these fields and they'll take a plow and what the plow does is it takes what's deep in the Earth where all the nutrients are where all of the rottenness was and all the everything is gathered there that's the good stuff and it brings it to the top and what it does is it takes the nasty stuff on top and it buries it down below where it can't live anymore and that's what turns the ground into good ground it's not that it never had the thorns and the briers and the and the weeds and these different things but they plow the field so that the bad stuff is buried and it's ready for the good stuff up on top but I want to take us back to what Jesus says about this ground in Matthew because he says these words he says for this people's heart he's talking about they said why do you talk in Parables why why don't you just tell them what they mean he said for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them he says but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear Church what's one thing we can't change who hears it and who doesn't just because you're born into a message family doesn't mean that you get to hear it it's that's the Sovereign predestination of God that you can hear the word you can understand it you can accept it and you can become it you can unify with it that's God's choosing that was chosen way before I ever took a breath of life and you as well he says for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them and so we're privileged this morning they were privileged then and we have been ever since that our experience in the Gospel of Jesus Christ the baptism of the Holy Spirit the the the coming of the New Covenant the New Testament is something that they were all looking forward to and never got one of the greatest men in the scriptures David David never got to see what you you see this morning if you've rece this evening if you've received the Holy Spirit if you're sitting under this New Covenant that's what David was looking for what you have is what David wanted what you have is what Samuel wanted what you have is what Moses was looking for what Joseph was looking for these great men and the other great Women of Faith Sarah and Rahab and Rebecca and all these different ones they were looking for this in Hebrews 11 says they received the promises but they didn't receive the full promise we're sitting under the Full Gospel the full promise of Christ they didn't receive it but we receive it and when we come into maturity it actually brings them into Perfection it brings the whole body of Christ together and we're joined into that body they're looking for what we have and so we're sitting here and Jesus says hear ye therefore the parable of the S when anyone heareth the word of the Kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which receive see by the way so this is a clear element of predestination those in verse 19 they are not predestinated to hear you can't make yourself good ground if you're on the Wayside you weren't chosen that's hard but it's true amen if you're of God you'd hear the word if you're of the devil you won't Jesus made that very clear it's not our choice it's his choice then in verse 20 says says but he that received the seed into Stony places the same as he that heareth the word and a nom with joy received it now this one's tricky because this is a person that seems to receive it but in time it's revealed that they didn't they love the word outwardly they love to hear it they love to say Amen but there's rocks all through their life and they've got things all over their life that hinder the growth and you'll notice it's the Rocks below the surface they can only grow down a little bit and then they hit something that they can't dig into he says yet he ha not root in himself but Urth he he lasts he endures for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by He Is offended remember Jesus talked about the Paul really talked about it being a rock of offense and a stumbling block and this is the person that loved the idea when they heard it it's like we see in Revelation 108 when John took the book it's sweet in the mouth but it's bitter in the belly and when it gets bitter in the belly what do they do they vomit it up they don't want any part of it they love the services but they can't live what they hear they love special meetings but they can't ever get the victory see they can rejoice in the moment but they can't last the journey they can't come to a harvest condition amen and so when things get hard when things get rough when offenses come when separation persecution whatever it might be criticism the cost of the gospel hits them they say sorry that's not for me and they they Bend and they break and they fall away he says then he also that receives seed among the Thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becomes unfruitful now notice he hears the word and this is the most deceiving of all of them amen what's holding back the fruit cuz he hears it and there is a life that grows here it grows up tall enough to be choked out it lives for a while and it says here what is it that that that chokes it out he says it's the cares of the world when you go back to the original language it says the anxieties and worries of this present age so in other words they've divided their focus between the word and the world remember what Jesus says you can't serve two masters and when you're divided like that you're a double-minded man you you're unstable in all your ways and what happens is you've got to pick one and in the end these types of people what happens is the world wins amen you can't serve two masters one's going to take it and these are ones that have a priority for the things of the world so these are ones that are overcome with the anxieties but then it also says the deceitfulness of riches they choke the word and he becomes unfruitful so so these are people on two different sides of the spectrum if we want to put it that way You' got one that's got so many needs that they can't remember they're a child of God and you got one that's got so many blessings that they've forgotten they're a child of God you got one that has so many needs and he's so wrapped up in himself that he's forgotten about Jehovah Gyra and then you've got one that's so blessed that he's forgotten I've got Jehovah Gyra they're on the the two extremes of of those things amen but this is one of those things and and I'm going to clarify this statement in just a moment if you'll grant me that Grace we can control where our anxieties are we can control where our cares are we can control where our time is we can control where our focus is we can control what our priority is absolutely as Believers because Satan can get us so wrapped up in what we need and what has to happen and we can get caught up in budgeting and the next thing and the next thing and the next thing and pretty soon we've completely forgotten that he's the man he's a God that owns the cattle on a thousand hills that the scripture says casting all your cares upon Him for he carth for you we're not meant to Bear those that way we're supposed to lay it on him and when we do that then we can produce fruit but if all we're trying to do is bear the load ourselves then what happens is we never produce the fruit but we can get caught up and this is really the danger in leoa I find is that we can have so much that we can declare like they did we're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and God is nowhere to be found in our life we are so easy in our life things are so simple I don't believe life's really easy but hey we're in North America we're in a in a tier one country we're a first world country compared to a lot of this world we've got it really easy you go to India you go to Africa you go to South America you see what those Believers have church you talk about anxieties and cares we don't have that here we don't have to have those things there amen but these are two sides that forget that they're children they should be children of God but I want to say it this way and this where the clarification is in verse 23 they are not children of God absolutely not we know that good ground is predestinated by God good ground represents a child of God and we're going to be mixing our metaphors a little bit here because we we are looking at the good ground and in this Parable the good ground is you and I it's people and out of our good ground out of our Lives comes something that produces a harvest amen but we know that that good ground is predestinated by God we look at the first one it was ground on the side of the road they never understood the word of God Jesus said if you were of your father you would hear my word and you'd understand it so they're not even in the plan of God then the Stony ground here's the word joyfully but it doesn't do anything tickles their fancy but it doesn't rest in their soul this is an emotional or an intellectual believer they're caught up in the feeling or the thought of it all but there's no strength or anchor there and then we go to the thorny ground and the thorny ground hears the word and starts to grow justification sanctification but when it comes to producing fruit that's when they fall and you can put somebody like Judas right there came all the way up but just couldn't come to the fruit park that's what it can look like but it can look like a Pharisee it can look like a pretended brother in these different things so it holds on to the word long enough but it can't produce the word and brother Brown would say the only thing that can't produce itself is something in a hybrid condition and so you've got something that's Blended in there and that's what's the hindrance is that in the end they weren't in there they there was no life in them to begin with but they can't produce fruit and it dies away because they become intain entangle with the word they can't come to maturity but then we come to our scripture in verse 23 it says but he that receives seed into the good ground is he so the good ground is us is he that heard the word now remember the thorny ground heard the word but it's he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some hundredfold some 60 and some 30 and we've already preached on this only one person can hear the word and that's a child of God that's why I say good ground is predestinated but it's also why I'm saying good ground requires a work it requires a work and if we look at at the good ground as our own lives then I believe we can see that there is a working of God and in church there's a working of us as well absolutely that's going to keep us in a place where we can produce it you know when the gospels emphasiz when Jesus is talking about here the as soon as he says this Parable the disciples don't understand it and it's only after he explains it that they sort of understand it but time and time again we see in the gospels that Jesus would say something and he would even tell them and they still wouldn't understand but yet it was given to them to understand but what was it going to take to make them understand it was going to take an upper room experience it was going to take the baptism of the Holy Spirit brother BR would say Peter became an inspired preacher on the day of Pentecost and now Peter can come and he can write these beautiful things that we've been reading Paul can come behind it and John and these different ones when the Holy Spirit comes he's now opening up their eyes of understanding and Revelation and that's when they start to produce fruit CU they can understand it they've been hearing it for three and a half years under Jesus direct Ministry but now they have to come into a place where there's a birth and they can start to produce these things it's leading them into all truth now we read this quote near the end of last service and I want to read it again as we push forward into the last half of this service this evening brother R says we are not of this world there is nothing about the way we live the way we function our priorities none of that is going to match up with what this world thinks we should do we are crazy but I'll tell you this there are people that are starting to wake up to the way that this craziness works but the thing is 99% of them will recognize it too late but I can't tell you how many times I've talked to people at work and clients and these different things and they know of course most of them do that I'm a Christian many of them know I'm a a minister and a pastor and these different things and they they just say how do you do this and how do you do that and how's it working out and how's it doing this and my kids are doing this and my kids are doing that are your kids doing this are your kids doing that and I say no we don't have any problems like that I have perfect children no I don't say that but I say no we don't have that issue we don't have that issue and I tell them what we do to keep from having that issue but they just can't comprehend it because they're so stuck on rights and their own morality and their own ideas and their own intellectuality I work with some pretty smart people you try and convince a smart person that everything they believed is wrong that's real hard but when they see the system not working when they see what they're doing not working that's when when you have a very small opening to say I know of a different way and you might think it's crazy but it's worked and it's been proven for thousands and thousands of years but it's a way that's called heresy unfortunately right you're going to have to stand out if you want different results you're going to have to do it different than everybody else that's not getting the results you like otherwise you're just part of the same system he says we are different from the world we live a different life a separated life we're never to live the life of the world and be a Christian we're to live an outstanding life a different life not in such social ranks but I mean we are to live a life of the genuine Holiness that the fruits of the spirit might be seen in US of meekness gentleness patience longsuffering Faith the fruit of the spirit so what is a life of Holiness a life of Holiness is a life that's cleaned up it's a life that's prepared for God it's good ground if we could put it that way amen so when we look through this Parable what we see are constant hindrances hindrances of birds hindrances of rocks hindrances of things that not to be there that come and choke out the life amen all of those things are there and some of them we can't help and some of them we can listen I can't stop the birds from existing but I can stop them from living in my house absolutely rocks as they come up I can either get rid of them or I can leave them and as we'll get into sometimes I'm the one that's walking over and I'm taking a rock off the side of the road and I'm dropping it right into my own field by my own choices every single day amen I've got the Holy Spirit and you've got the Holy Spirit to highlight when a hindrance hits your life so that you can see this ain't going to help me produce my 30-fold 60-fold or 100 fold and then once he highlights it once he shows it to me then I've got a choice do I really want to get rid of it or do I want to allow the hindrance to stay in my life look what Paul said to the Galatians you did run well you were growing great you were doing such a good job look how fast you are growing who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you it's not God that's doing this God is Not here to hinder growth I've repeated that thing that I got from Brother Eugene Braun and I I I truly appreciate it it's a principle that stuck with me and that's that God's love is based on spiritual growth that's what God wants out of us spiritual growth he doesn't care about our health if we're failing in our Christian walk he doesn't care about our finances if we're failing in our Christian walk he doesn't care about our career if we're failing in our Christian walk he will wipe everything out to get us to grow as a child of God but then Paul says this little phrase he says a little leaven lenth the whole lump that's a tongue twister sometimes we have to be honest and say this one ain't on Satan this one's on me we've got to have that honest conversation sometimes it's not that the hindrance is there it's that I'm either allowing it or even creating it in my own life listen we're all inclined to certain things we all have weaknesses we have areas that we need to keep covered up by prayer and sometimes we don't cover them up by prayer sometimes we get into situations and we've got to be able to see those things and recognize them for what they are but I'm wanting us to be aware even this evening that we can limit the power of those things in our life not me as a person that's the work of the Holy Spirit but I have that choice to decide am I going to go with him and go with the word or am I going to insist on allowing this hindrance in my life have you ever seen a picture of a field where they didn't get the rocks out sometimes they've got one big rock there and every Row in that field is straight to a point and then they come to this rock and they've got to go around it and you know what it does to every single row after that church it puts a kink in every single row this is what Paul says a little tiny hindrance has a ripple effect through your entire life I'm not a legalistic preacher but I'm preaching what Paul said here he's saying you got some problems and it's the little things that are causing the big things amen that little thing can spread out and affect your entire life so can I share something with you tonight I'm going to be open and honest not about you couple nervous faces there I'm going to be honest about me because if we can be honest about me then we ought to be able to be honest with you amen this is going out on the internet but can we start with this place and say I don't want a hindrance in my life would that be our desire this evening I don't want a hindrance in my life that's what my heart's desire is amen so my wife and I we purchased a new mattress in April of last year from Costco highly rated got a good deal on it and we put it in our house and for the first while it was wonderful absolutely wonderful great support we had great sleep but over time we started to not sleep so well our backs started to hurt these different things and then my wife said she says these things have they've got a dip in them I'm like no they don't they don't I they don't I refuse to believe it but sure enough she was right and eventually I saw the dips were there we flipped the mattress like we were supposed to do you know and didn't matter they veloped the new dip where we were sleeping and so what do you what are you going to do well we' got we're we're looking for a new mattress in the meantime but we haven't found one yet but downstairs we have our old mattress that we bought 23 years ago and it's still going strong great mattress but it's a queen and we have a king bed now so we can't just take that one upstairs and put it on our bed so sometimes if our backs are particularly bad my wife or I will go and sleep downstairs somebody needs to stay up just in case our young wakes up and so the other night she decided Samuel was sick and so she said well I'm going to stay up here and you go down and sleep on that bed if you want your back to feel better and so what I did is I picked up my iPad and I was going out the door and she said don't stay up late and I said I won't but I've been reading something and I wanted to finish what I was reading so I went downstairs and guess what I did I said stayed up late way late 11:38 p.m. okay I was only going to be 10 minutes the spirit's willing the iPad is weak no no the iPad's not weak John's weak and what happens I got sucked into the next thing and I look oh I got to check this what I started pulling on a thread and I followed it to the ends of the universe for the next hour I needed to go to bed I needed that sleep but I'm down there and what do I do now I go to bed late so when I wake up the next morning of course I'm feeling the best aren't I I'm well rested chipper no tired little bit grumpy a little bit angry at this guy for letting me down cuz it wasn't my intention to do it but now I wake up I don't get up when I should so now I'm late for my devotions so I cut my devotion short I'm I'm not feeling the best and so now that bleeds into my attitude bleeds into how I deal with my family deals how I deal with my clients I'm supposed to be studying the word of God and what is it I'm tired way before I need to be tired because what this guy who has no affiliation with me this guy decided that he wanted to pull on a thread until he found the end of the universe right it's not wrong it's a hindrance it's a hindrance right there's nothing wrong with me sitting on my iPad and to be fair most times when I'm on my iPad I have my wife in the room because she'll turn over and tell me when to go to bed it's a check it's a balance but when I'm down there nobody can tell me what to do right right and so what happens is this flesh tells me what to do so whose fault is it that I sleep in late that I shorten my devotions that I'm a little bit grumpy for the rest of that day that I've got to try and catch up on my sleep the next night that's not Satan's fault that's this guy's fault I picked up the iPad and gave it a preeminence in my life that night amen so what do I do from now on church if I'm going to go sleep downstairs where's the iPad going not with this guy not with this guy because he's proven he likes that hindrance and this my my life my Ministry my family can't afford that hindrance so the next time I go down the iPad stays upstairs because I'm not going to pick up the Rock and put it in the good ground that's a very simple example but it's a it's a example that can have a ripple effect now that's only one night but if I continue to do that what's going to happen I'm going to start to snap I'm going to get tired I'm going to get weary I'm not going to have the right attitude and I may actually hurt one of you not physically I may respond in the wrong way I might hurt my own family and I can't sit there and say that's Satan that did that I've got to be able to say I move that rock into my life amen I've got to be able to say John you don't handle that well leave it alone let it go let it go let somebody else figure it out like I said it's not that it's wrong it's that it's hindering me it's choking my sleep choking my rest which chokes my attitude which chokes my Effectiveness which can choke my Ministry if I keep doing it you'd end up noticing something up here are you with me this evening so often we're looking around and we're blaming Satan and you know what we need to blame this guy right here me and Matt that's the nice thing about sitting at the back you can raise your hand and be humble and nobody knows it amen God bless you brother Matt I see you and everybody knows now but we're so busy looking around how come I'm this way and how come I'm that way listen if I'm tired and grumpy that day that ain't Satan's fault that's my fault and I've got to accept that and I've got to be able to say you can take that stone out of your life you can take those thorns out of your life amen we have every tool every Appliance every luxury every Comfort to take away the work in our life and yet we struggle to find time with God you know what it ain't Satan it's the hindrances I'm adding in I'm allowing in I'm placing in in some cases amen Satan's not throwing the rocks in half the time we're inviting them in we're picking them up and carrying them into our life but here's the thing God prepares Our Lives God has made it so we can produce fruit if we'll use the ground we're planted in now we're switching the metaphor okay now we're not the good ground now we're going to talk about the trees that are planted in good ground okay I believe God plants Us in condition so we can grow in Christ so that we can produce the fruit of the spirit so that we can produce the word inside of our lives and I believe that because the Psalms say it the very first Psalm says blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord not on pulling threads on an iPad and in his law do he meditate day and night not on Instagram not on Facebook not on news media where's his Delight what's he dwell on the word of God this is a person whose life is defined and built around the word of God this isn't one verse a day Christian this isn't I read our daily strength Christian this isn't I go to church Wednesdays and Sundays Christian this is an everyday word feeding Christian you see the difference you see the difference 5 minutes a day ain't going to cut it church I envy some of you that talk to me about your devotion habits an hour and a half in the morning just of reading your Bible and a message wow now here's the thing I may not be able to get that I get about an hour in the mornings but I'll tell you this if I cut off my habits so that I go to bed at 10:00 I could wake up at 6:00 and still get seven and a half hours of sleep and I could get that hour and a half if I really wanted it but I don't why I'm not desperate enough yet I'm willing to do what I've got I'm willing to go with what I've got because I know I'm still going to spend 3 hours in the evening studying I can make up for it but we have an opportunity and we have choices to make whether or not we match up to verse two he says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper it's like I said at the beginning we're not going to even get into the fruits of the spirit but we're talking about the conditions that produce the Fruit of the Spirit and the Holy Spirit now speaking through David here he says that somebody who has heard the word somebody that dwells on the word somebody that receives the word somebody that lives by the word they can be compared to a tree that's planted in a particular set of conditions and environment and that person does not magically land in a good place it says it doesn't say that this person landed by the rivers of water it doesn't say this person happened by rivers of water it says this person was planted by rivers of water okay there's nothing of Self in this this is The Sovereign work of God to place us where we can grow this is an intentional event this is an intentional event you don't plant things halfhazard who who's who's got the Green Thumb here brother Mark's got a green thumb anybody else plant in here a lot brother Mark is it all right brother Mark we're talking to you in the spring do you walk out with all of those beautiful flower seeds and just go go forth and prosper does he walk out and just you know tossing the seeds around do you do that no he doesn't he's thinking about it this is a new high-speed delivery system that's not what you do is it brother Mark because he's got places for those plants to grow he's got places that he has prepared that will support them they'll look good and they'll produce exactly what they are and he goes through the work this man puts manure in his minivan church that's the kind of preparation he goes through to make sure that they've got what they need to grow this is what it's talking about in the scripture they're planted in a place where they can grow amen God plants us where we can grow to the best effect that means we can't blame the ground okay we're switching our metaphors we can't blame the ground churches can have a lot of criticism but let me tell you if what comes out of those churches is Christ the ground was good and God planted them there not everybody was meant to have brother Gerald as a pastor not everybody's meant to have me as a pastor and all these other men that are around this world that are pastoring but if God places you then God will grow you there that simple that simple and so that means we can't blame the ground church if we're not growing the problem is not the ground because we're planted in a place where we can grow amen don't blame the ground don't blame God say what is it that I'm doing that's hindering my growth because he's planted me where I ought to be growing am I feeding where God has planted me that's really the question where are we planted rivers of water water is always life to plants that's all that's all it means to a plant is life brother Bram says this water represents life we know that Moses in the wilderness he smot The Rock and it gave forth Waters of life to it perishing people and then he would start to talk now in the in this next message planting yeah it's the same message and he starts to talk about the woman at the well and he's really bringing to life what Jesus was talking about when he says I'll give you water that you'll never thirst again Watch how he says this now he it's he's relaying the conversation of the woman at the well and as Jesus says but if you knew he says other words like this if you knew how close you were to the Fountain of Life I'd give you water that you wouldn't come here to draw he says I'll transplant you you Samaritan I'll bring you you sinner see the planting sometimes it's the seed but sometimes it's a transplanting youve got to be moved from where you are cuz you're not growing to where you will grow he says that's the unbeliever and doesn't believe in it if you'll only let me pluck you up this morning he said I'll plant you by the rivers of water I'll put you in a position by the baptism of the holy spirit that you'll believe every word that I say is the truth hallelujah that's the place where you are planted this evening church if you are a child of God filled with the Holy Spirit he has placed you in a place where you can grow and receive and believe every word of God he says you'll just let me pluck you up this morning you'd be a good Branch you don't belong in that wild Vineyard he says You Belong over here so let me pluck you up and plant You in My Name by the side of the riv Rivers he says every tributary of God's word for every word of God is true every Divine promises the truth I'll plant you by the rivers of one water one God and you'll bring forth fruit in your season your leaves shall not wither and whatsoever you do shall prosper you'll stand when there's no other place to stand he says you'll stand anyhow knowing that God made the promise when you know that God has planted you when you know that God has placed you then you know that God will help you stand he says let me pluck you up he said and plant you over here by this water that you don't have to run to these Creed places and denominational places to find you can't find it there anyhow let me pluck you up by this old dry well here that you have to take Tim buckets and Rattle and fuss and drink a little and come back and drink a little I'll give you eternal life Joy just like a well bubbling up into everlasting life he says let me let me do that for you Christ said to the woman The Sinner she couldn't produce that fruit she couldn't produce that life but he says if you'll let me take you from where you are this morning if you'll let me take you from where you are this evening I'll bring you to what you've been looking for all along not in this flesh but in your soul there's a hunger in your heart there's a desire in your soul for something he says if you'll let me I'll take you there he says and he says the same thing to the church this morning you know there is a God you believe there's a God can we say Amen to that this evening do we believe that there is a God he says but in your affiliation something cut you off you're in a desert there's no spiritual Joy you'd like to feel like they did on the day of Pentecost wouldn't you love to have the joy that they had he's talking about you're a part of a denomination and so you're cut off because that's not a part of the True Vine but we can get cut off in our affiliation we can get cut off just by Church attendance we can get cut off by our association if we're not planted in Christ we need the life of the association not the association we have a message church we believe we have the the message of the hour we believe we've got a Vindicated word this evening but that is not enough if we're not feeding on the word if there's not a life inside of us that's doing that amen if we've stopped feeding from The Well of life we're in a desert there's no spiritual Joy we're dried out broken cracked religious formal amen we've been hindered in our walk and it's not a God's doing but if you're planted by rivers of water what's the effect what does water du to a tree it grows it it matures it it produces leaves and then it produces life Fruit amen if there's Life by the water the tree will produce fruit that's what it's built to do it's built to produce fruit watch how David says it he says now he'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season I want to stop there notice it says his fruit his season you've got your fruit I've got my fruit we've all got the nature of Christ but there are things that we produce more evident than maybe the one next to us you've got areas of your life you've got a Ministry you've got a fruit of the spirit listen not all of us are known for our joyfulness not all of us are known for our patience not all of us are known for our Mercy those that produce those in great amounts those are the ones that we know them for but every one of us ought to be merciful every one of us ought to be loving every one of us ought to be patient and kind and these different things but you've got your special fruit and I've got mine if I can put it that way unique to you that's what he's saying here you've got your fruit and not just your fruit but you've got your season he's planted you he's placed you he's made you and therefore you've got to produce something amen but it's an expression of Christ Living Through you see in the when we talk about seasons of fruit we have different fruits and every fruit has its own season early in the year we might have our strawberries then you have your blueberries and your raspberries and these different things oranges and apples don't necessarily ripen at the same time time not only that you may not produce as much as the one next to you if you're of a different kind of fruit or a different kind of tree if we could put it that way you might only produce a little bit if you're a certain type of plant certain type of tree you might only sing one special a year but if that's the fruit of Christ in your life that's okay and then there'll be some that'll sing six specials a year and that's the fruit of their life in their season but here's the thing if you're singing one and you're meant to produce six that's a problem I'm not pointing at you sister Amber but think of it this way if you go up to a blueberry bush and it only has one blueberry what would you say is that a healthy Bush no cuz blueberries are supposed to have tons right you know you've reached a place of good blueberries when you picking handfuls of blueberries right see I can sit here and say I'm a Christian I've got a blueberry but how many blueberries am I supposed to have but blueberries you go pick over a blueberry patch and come back a week later and guess what you got church blueberries all over again it's a wonderful thing it's a wonderful thing sister Amber you used to live by that blueberry patch and those things you could go up with raspberries and you could go up a week later and you'd have raspberries where there were no raspberries you picked them all and you come back and you got raspberries try doing that to an apple tree you pick all the apples and you come back a week later what do you have nothing you done pick them that's it you're not getting anymore there's a fruit and there's a season amen there are some fruits or some plants that only Blossom and produce once a year once every few years and you've got to believe that it's worth it to own a plant like that you got to believe it's worth it to to have a plant for 3 years just to see it bloom once and if you don't believe it's worth it you won't do it will you and those are some of the rarest and most expensive ones because it takes a real effort to get them to grow and produce and you have to be perfect for three years otherwise they just die off and you lose the blooms this is an N plant beautiful isn't it so detailed intricate takes 3 years to bloom church and then it's it it's done brother Braham said this God can train a man take him a hundred years for 30 minutes work God knows how to train you may preach just a few sermons a year but if that's what God has called you to do if that's the fruit of your life in that season that's all that's required I've been in places where I only preach maybe three times a year and God took a lot of time to develop those sermons hours and hours and hours and hours way more than I can spend now CU I have months in between preaching and God could take it and he could hone it to Perfection and by God's grace it hit the mark every single time I'm not boasting I'm saying that's the testimony of the the Believers but I had to be okay with just producing that kind of fruit three times a year as long as it's the right kind of fruit amen we're not here to compare that's what I'm that's what I'm trying to get out of all this is we're talking about the fruit of the spirit and we're talking about the character and the nature of Christ but when it comes to the fruit of our life we're not here for comparison we're here to do what we are made to do that's it we have our our song leader and our musicians in effect they're doing a special every single service in a certain way they're up here doing a work for God every single service so that can't compare to Sister Priscilla that sings her specials or sister Amber or the other sisters that do it occasionally it's a different type of service it's a different type of fruit but the question is is that your season and your fruit and if it is God bless you but if we're holding back because we're not doing what we ought to do and we'll get to it in a moment then it's us that's the problem it's not a lack it's not a lack of God's inspiration it's a lack of us taking in what we're supposed to take in he says his Leaf also shall not wither what does it mean when you look at a plant and the Leaf's with withered my wife famously travels on vacation and leaves me to care for her plants if she comes back and the leaves are withered which may hair may not have happened multiple times what does that tell my wife I can say it till I'm blue in the face I watered your plants but if the leaves have withered guess what I didn't or I didn't enough that's the other thing see I'm scared of drowning them it's not funny makes a mess cuz see I overfill one one time and it made a big mess and so I don't want to overfill them but the thing is if she comes back and the leaves are withered what does it mean there wasn't enough water but here's the thing if you're planted by rivers of water and the leaf Withers what's the problem church it's not the river it's this guy if the leaves start to wither that's right Michael if the leaves start to wither it's cuz I'm not drinking the problem's not the water the water's there I'm planted by rivers of water they never run dry it's a Well of life so if my leaves start to wither the problems in the Drinker not in the drink for feeding on the word of God every day meditating on it dwelling on it feeding on it he says your leaves won't wither before you have fruit you have leaves and when the fruit goes away the leaves still stick around for a while don't they see we have Seasons now but this is a chur this is a this is a tree that never goes through a loss of leaf it's always there we call it an evergreen except it has leaves instead of needles he says your Leaf NE never Withers if you're a person that's feeding yourself the way you're supposed to be fed if you're feeding where God has planted you your Leaf never never W never Withers might not be your time to produce fruit but let me tell you if you've got leaves on the tree it's a place of Refuge it's a place of shelter it's a place where people can cool off it still has a benefit and then he says and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper why because you're feeding on the Eternal Word of God not prospering by the sweat of your brow now see Adam was prospering in his fruitfulness by the word until he put the word aside and that's when he started to sweat but when you're a tree you don't have to sweat you just have to keep feeding that's it it's easy it's easy Church how come you're not greater Christians how come we're not greater Christians it's so easy but it is easy and by that I mean it's simple it's not hard to understand this is God speaking to Joshua he says' only be thou very strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee he said Joshua stay with the word turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest David said this this man that's planted by rivers of water he'll prosper in whatever you do God says to Joshua Joshua you stay with the word that my Prophet gave you you'll prosper and everything you do why cuz you're not going your way you're going my way you're not going by your will you're going by my will you're not going by your leadership you're going by my leadership you're staying with my promise and I'll come behind and I'll back that up last set of quotes he says and all you do with the little tree you just plant it and then you have to give it water and it just drinks and it has to drink more than it's a lotted portion I want you to catch that if that tree wants to grow it has to take more than it needs it has to eat based on what it wants to be not based on what it is you know they have this thing that I don't know if it's true anymore they say in your career dress for the position you want to have not the position you have what's he saying here drink feed to be what you want to be not based on where you're at right now he says and the more it drinks it begins to push out next service I promise you as far as I know Lord willing we're going to preach on the fruit of the spirit you say brother John how do I produce the fruit of the spirit the more it drinks it begins to push out and it pushes out leaves it pushes out branches we've all seen little trees grow right first thing comes up just a little sprig and then what does it do it has a little leaf and that turns into a branch and then off that comes more leaves and more branches and then out of those come more leaves and then eventually it says it pushes out oranges pushes out blossoms and pushes out oranges then it keeps drinking pushing out more oranges and leaves and Blossoms just drinks drinks drinks drinks I said at the end of this service we know how to produce the fruit of the spirit here's your answer drink drink drink drink before we came to church my head was really starting to ache I told my wife I said I'm dehydrated you know what I did I went and I drank a lot of water and I drank and I drank and I drank and I drank and what did it do it took away my dehydration you want to produce drink drink drink drink he says and when a Believer is placed in Christ Jesus you're planted in there in the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and the more you drink drink the more you push out what goes in must come out it's got to go somewhere and so he's saying the more you drink the more benefit you'll get that's right he says if you can't believe he says well I believe that Jesus saves me that's good then how about the Holy Ghost believe he give you the Holy Ghost he promised it to you about Divine Healing believe it he promised it to you he's saying if you're at a certain level and you want to go to the next level start drinking like you're at the next level you got to drink to grow you got to feed on the word to grow you've got to feed your faith because faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the word it's in the word that you're going to find what you need and you'll find this beautiful quote as we finish here tonight he says every Redemptive blessing belongs to you just drink and drink and push out how many here want a greater experience with God half of us by a show of hands how many here want a greater experience with God there we go all of us have you ever had a week where you just seemed to hit the marks every day you went to bed at the right time you got up at the right time you had your devotions you made it to every church service you got some fellowship anybody ever have a week like that I've had them I don't always have them but I've had them why because you're feeding on that which produced produces what you need and the thing is you skip a day here you skip a day there you sleep in here you stay up late there and what happens is you start to lose some of that momentum to produce that fruit see what happened is you pushed out the Blossom and the blossom is what smells the best you ever in a around the Orange Groves in that and the blossoms are there you can smell it but we're not here for blossoms we're here for fruit and what happens is we get to a certain place and we say that's pretty good and it's blossom season but we're trying to get the fruit season and we got to keep drinking and we got to keep drinking and we got to keep drinking That's Why th this is the way I find it I believe most people do when we come in and we have special meetings and we go Friday night Saturday night Sunday Morning by Sunday afternoon we might be beat out but don't we feel like we could destroy anybody body any weapon any army any demon any influence we feel like we're able to take the country every promise in the book is mine why because our Focus has been drinking drinking drinking and the thing is in those moments that's when we ought to strike cuz we're strong but the problem is we walk out and we don't drink and we don't drink and we don't drink and 3 weeks later we're right back to where we were we got to keep drinking got to keep feeding got to keep pressing got to keep pushing not to stay satisfied to grow amen he says every Redemptive blessing belongs to you just drink and drink and push out that's all everything you have need of is right in you oh wow we're talking about faith listen to this he says when you receive the Holy Ghost everything you've got need of between here and glory is right in you then hallelujah when you receed the Holy Ghost you are bound for eternity everything you have need of is right there with you it's in you he says it ain't Faith you need what we're asking God give me more faith give me more faith give me more faith he says you got faith if you've got the holy spirit for he is your your faith but what do you have to do drink drink drink drink maybe that should have been the title tonight drink drink drink drink it's simple it's not easy but it's simple amen God bless you let's stand what's the problem it's not the word it's not where we're planted it's what we're drinking it's whether we're drinking and then how much we're drinking amen that's what he's trying to get to the people he's saying where I think Pentecost failed what is you stopped at the part that you were satisfied with rather than going all the way into the promises of God cuz they did they stopped at the gifts and they didn't go all the way into the word they were happy to stay with the gifts we talked about it last service when El elazar came and and he brought uh you know he was looking for a bride for Isaac and when he comes and he finds Rebecca he gives her gifts and if she accepted those gifts they were hers she didn't have to go but she wanted to be with Isaac not just have the gifts that's where Pentecost failed they stopped at the blossoms and they didn't go on to the true fruit which is Christ himself and it's a lovely place when it all smells great and it looks great but if you never come to fruit you're dead you never had all you never had the fullness of life in you that's what he's saying to us as believers you can have the truth you can come to a message church you can sit under the hearing of the word you can believe every word of it but you've got to feed on what he's placed in front of you amen listen I'll say this Satan is a master at putting opportunity in front of us to take us away from the word we have every possible distraction to us listen if you've got a phone he doesn't need to give you anything else in your life that alone will distract you if you let it but then add to that we have our our businesses we have our jobs we have our family needs we have church needs and all these things and listen you can get so caught up in church that you forget the word absolutely absolutely that's why I need to have devotions not just study because God's got to have a place where he can deal with me personally directly for my life not that he doesn't in studying absolutely he does but I've got to have a place where I can go talk to him about my needs my family's needs and these different things not just church needs I can get so caught up in being a minister that I forget to be a Christian for sure get caught up in the duty and forget the life and if I do that you know what happens I get dry cracked brittle worn out and then I snap that's what we do we've got to drink from water the pure word every single day trees don't just drink a little bit they drink constantly if it's there they're constantly taking it and they're pulling it up and pushing it out they drink like they're not going to have a drink ever again that's what we're supposed to be amen God bless you this evening let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord a simple instruction here tonight drink scripture says those that are thirsty come and drink Lord the problem's not the fountain it's not the source Lord so often the hindrance is whether we'll come up and take that drink Lord I'm not preaching to a congregation I'm preaching to myself Lord every one of us can do better Lord I'm not here for legalism Lord I'm here for you Lord and I believe that you've given us an instruction tonight that if we would have more of you we've got to feed on More Of You Lord we've got to take the time to drink we've got to take the time to have a Pure Source that can produce the Life of Christ inside of us Heavenly Father Lord I pray you help us to set aside every little weight every little sin every little anxiety every little habit Lord that those stones that we would blame so often on others Lord let us look at our life and see have I placed that stone have I planted that set of of thorns in my life Lord have I placed a hindrance on your word Lord and if we have Lord I pray you forgive me forgive us Lord help us to root it out Lord and go feed on the things we ought to feed on Lord take away our excuses Lord help us to be humble before you now grant us Grace Lord we know the strength is there Lord the spirit's there it's the word that we limit I pray your grace to help us feed on those things heavenly father in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen more of you more of you I've had it all 759 more of [Music] you more of you [Music] I've
