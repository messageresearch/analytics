morning that you know there's a great banquet table that's been set and and regardless you know if you if you want bacon and eggs this morning or you know if you just want a smoothie and maybe maybe I want something different maybe I maybe I want potatoes and beans what you know we all have these little different appetites oh these little different Cravings in our lives and you know that's just how great God is now I'm just talking on a natural level but now let's just step down into our spiritual walk with the Lord your relationship with him you know we have these little little places in our lives that that we just need we need God to take that part of our life you know we we want to I believe the scripture says you know one of these days when we get there we're gonna we're gonna crown him Lord of Lord and King of Kings but I believe that we can do that right now I believe he wants to be the king of your life not just the Lord of your life he wants to be the king of your life not just a savior not just the Redeemer but he wants to be king in other words when you get up in the morning the first thing you think about is Lord what can I do to serve you you get out of bed the next thing you do is Lord what can I do to serve your children father where would you have me to go today Lord what can I do for you today I don't know about your Bible but mine says I've been bought with a price I become a love slave do not aching to the king tell you what there's no Greater Joy There's No Greater Joy that we have than to serve a living God I'm so thankful that he knows how just to walk through the doors of my life why don't you just take your seats for a moment and I'm sorry to keep you standing like that here I get all forgetful again and I just want to welcome you again to the house of the Lord and such been such a blessing to be here this weekend I I was just telling brother Jonathan excuse me [Music] I'll get it together laughs well they say real men don't cry but I'm

frame of Eternity but this table that's being set one of these days we're going to step up to the marriage supper we're not going to the wedding of the bride and we are being married now yeah we're going to end up at a wedding supper and there's a table that's been set there somewhere is along that table but Joe is got your name there's a chair with your name written on it remember Paul there's

I've had the privilege shake their hands to wrap my arms around them to appreciate them and I can the same spirit is right there that same spirit that pulled you out of the muck in the mirror of sin Same Spirit that's been calling you higher come up higher come up higher you know we're standing here this morning in Jacob's Ladder I don't know what rung you're at this morning on Jacob's Ladder maybe you're nearing the top and you can look down and say brother Dwayne you've got a long ways to go but keep coming brother keep coming and one thing about the saints of God they're they're they're not there stepping on the fingers of the brother that's below him trying to get him off they're standing the Son of God is standing at the top saying come on come on come make it come on keep climbing yeah brother Gerald I'm tired I'm tired son you can make it keep climbing keep climbing [Music] I believe that's why we're here this morning Lord I just want to climb just a little bit higher this is Glory we're climbing Mount Zion this morning we're climbing Mount Zion we're not we're not climbing Mount Everest we're climbing Mount Zion tell you what there is a city one of these days we're gonna the veil is going to break you know can you imagine in the twinkle in the twinkle of enough but you didn't even blink you just twinkled your eyes and a whole new world break someone in front of you sister Betty you're gonna look I haven't got a chance to meet you yet but God bless you it's so good to see you this morning you're gonna look and look down and you're gonna think first everything looks so everything looks so different I is so blue and grass is so green and I feel so good this morning and then you're gonna look down at your little hands there won't be a scar on your hands Brothers there won't be a wrinkle you look down at your feet and you begin to look I believe just like Abraham looked at his wife's hair honey the hump is coming out of your back listen what kind of Revelation was written what kind of mystery has been hidden in this book we look at it and we're looking at the revelation of the words that have been written and hidden for all these Generations all these years but I'm looking at I'm looking at the revelation of the flesh that God the mystery that God has been revealing how he could take something out of a sin cursed Earth breathe breath into it and it could bring forth the very life himself I'll tell you what is the greatest mystery ever been told I'm so thankful that we've been given eyes to see this morning so thankful we've been given years to hear what the angel spoken to the age it's done something for us church it's caught us up and I'm just so thankful again let me just thank you one more time just for the opportunity come and shake your hands and out of all these years here I am 54 years old traveled to different countries and never I missed out on The Treasure of Canada [Music] God bless you and if we never get a chance to meet this side of Heaven for the problem [Music] excuse me [Music] it's more real than this world is church [Music] if we can just break beyond our carnality just enter in [Music] to the spirit of Christ I need more of you Lord whatever it takes to make that rapture all don't you miss it Joe don't you let your work get in the way don't you miss it it's more valuable than that brother Dale you might have crossed the country coming to your favorite place but don't miss that place yeah we got a home to go to and this is not it we'll come back here and enjoy it later I promise you 'll take me 54 years to get here on the other side let's think about those brothers that are living on I don't know if it'll be counted or not anymore but those Brothers living over there I'll be right here travel like a thought never get tired never get weary there is a land beyond the river to that you ever been taking up all this time and talking I don't know why but you guys you guys just make me feel so at home and I just want to appreciate that this morning it's uh oh there goes all my little nervousnesses and you know why because the presence of God is here that's why so God bless you certainly do want to tell you we love you again bring you greetings for the Saints back at home and I'll be sure to take your love back home with me and I'll I'm going to go back and brag on on the newfoundlanders let me rephrase that the sons of God in Newfoundland I'm gonna go back and brag on them I suspect brother Dale some will end up like you I hope they don't come to live because I don't want to lose them anyhow I don't know if I can get started this morning but maybe I should you know brother Dale was giving me a hard time again last night he's like brother Dwayne you're only here one more service is it okay if we sing this morning is it honey why don't you come take the piano for me for a minute don't go away guys this is my new backup team while I'm in Nova Scotia Newfoundland Newfoundland just wanted to see how much I appreciated those specials all these young ladies moms yeah did I just say this you know I just believe that the church is a body you know I don't believe I've been to too many places and been you know too often gone and and I just don't believe that the churches is just elders and I don't believe the church is just middle-aged people and I don't believe the church is just young people but I have been to churches where it's only Elders that are left and I've been to churches where it's only young people and you know there's not there's not hardly even an elder around and I I just don't believe that was a God had in mind you know every generation has the value of that generation cannot go on it cannot go unnoticed it cannot go unappreciated uh and yet the Zeal of the young people coming up because God knows as we get my age and we start pushing the upper limits you know we want to go but her body doesn't want to keep up anymore and so when you see the young people coming on I think God how precious it is and then when I see moms God bless you sisters moms standing there singing with their children to tell you what it's that was precious to me it really was and I wanted to say God bless you whoever whoever went to all the effort of getting those kids to play like that oh my goodness bless your heart that would be a challenge this is a little song and uh I don't know the lord gave it to me years ago I'll take this one brother so the Lord the lord gave me this song many years ago I'll go through battles in life we all go to struggle no matter what stage we're at this journey that we're on is a battle and we're not promised you know a bed of ease while we're here but we are promised that if we'll fight the good fight that when we get there we can rest and so this this song Just is maybe a little bit like that just encourage you in your battle this morning foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] well seems so much greater I wonder Lord how King I stand and down on my knees at the foot of the altar gently he takes my and he lived me up just a little bit higher tells me that he's still in commands he says [Music] why so gloomy why why so sad or I'll finish soon what I am starting I've chosen you child go take the lane [Music] please if we Could Only See there's no such thing as failure why it's all just according to his play we'd stand up tall and confess our God is able he has promised your Heir too this land he said my child was so down Hardy why so gloomy why so sad or I'll finish whatever I have started I chose a new child go take the land he said my child my soul down hearty why so gloomy oh why so sad or I'll finish soon what I have started I've chosen your child go take the lane I've chosen you child go take the land [Music] Hallelujah I chosen you thank you Brothers God bless you have chosen you go take the land and I don't believe that I don't I believe this God knows just exactly what is in the elements he's the one that places it all together you know when he puts you together he knew just what you were made out of you say well brother Dwayne you just don't understand you don't know where I come from and I don't care God planted you where he planted you for his glory you know what you uh here I was and you know I was raised in a message home and I thank God every day uh for my parents and for the for the blessing that he it allowed me to be raised that way but regardless of what home you came out of and regardless of how dirty or or or or deep you were planted in the muck in the mirror of of the sin of this world you're here you're here look at when the sun comes up and and and and now I believe that there is Sun here in in Newfoundland you know I'll tell you what I love the water I just have to be honest and uh and I love to fish even though I don't get to do it very often and but I'll tell you what if it hadn't been Resurrection more than this morning I was itching I looked out at all that water and the waves were just you know they were they were Saskatchewan height waves you know they're maybe just like little ones not like those great big things that were crashing the other day I thought Lord I I mean it wasn't Resurrection I'd like to go fishing there's one boat out on the on the water and I thought that could be me but he said he would make us a fisher of a different kind of fishermen and I'm so thankful for that this morning I'm just taking up all sorts of time I I'm so sorry I no I'm not I got rebuked for that yesterday so I'll just be me and if you got your Bibles with you this morning and I hope you brought him anyhow you know this is a this is the most important book that you'll ever read you know what you know when we're young we're we're young men and we got this you know this these god-given inequalities inside of you you know you don't even understand them but you've got to be the Conqueror and you've got to be the provider and you've got God's wired you all this way and and so you know young men are just uh they're just they've got a they've got to do crazy things because they've got to prove to themselves they can do it and old men got to do crazy things you know I heard a little article the other day and here's a man 104 years old or something like that and he's still racing bikes pedal bikes every day he's out riding his pedal bike enters these races and he's saying I just got approve to myself I can do it still and I you know that's just the nature of a man and and you know then you take a little you take the girls and and you know so when we read books or you know we we would read the action books you know the ones where there's fighting and you know the old Louis l'amours you know where they're gonna you know how you know what I'm talking about brothers but then you take the girls and they're so different you know I was like I read these romance books and oh my look at the way he smiles at her and oh he gave her a letter and gave her flowers and oh guess where they got it from Brothers if you've got the fighter in you go back and read the Old Testament Great Men of God willing to die for this gospel sisters girls and your ladies and you're wired that way and you don't have to be ashamed of it but go back and read the stories of Esther go back and read the stories of Ruth go back these these Godly women if you got the fighter go read about JL great women these are the women to Aspire to be like these are the men who aspire to be like oh my here I am I'm Lord help me this morning please Revelations chapter seven if you got your Bibles why don't we stand together we'll just change your positions for a few minutes and Revelations chapter 7 and I myself have been I would guess I would say on a little journey the last couple years a couple years ago I started into the Book of Revelations and I got I don't know what it was about it but it so inspired me it so begin to throw my soul and maybe it was just the time for me and uh you know I just beginner this is the bride's book this is the bride's portion right here and we got the whole Bible as the bride's portion but when you get to the Book of Revelations you and I actually have a revelation and the rest of the world is still just grasping at it trying to oh we just don't understand it but you and I actually have an understanding and and we thank God for that this morning and so the Lord will help me I want to speak on Living Waters this morning Revelations chapter 7 starting at verse 9 it says and after this I beheld and Loa great multitude which no man could number of all Nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues to stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and Palms in their hands and of course we're not going to stop on all these because we would just be here for the next couple years and and it says and uh robes Palms in their hands and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell Before the Throne on their faces and worshiped God saying amen and blessing and glory and wisdom Thanksgiving honor and power and might be unto our God forever and forever amen and one of the elders answers saying unto me what are these which are raid in white robes and once Kim and once came they and I said unto him sir thou knowest and he said unto me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb ah somehow I believe I was standing there at that time you know this whole book is a book of Prophecy so John was already caught up into it into the into the eternities into an element of Revelation and I believe it's just for us now therefore are they Before the Throne of God and serve him day and night in his Temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them and they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore neither shall the sunlight on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living Fountains of water and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes can we bow our heads for a moment one more time Heavenly Father or we're so grateful for your word this morning Lord it is our life we ask father that the great spirit of God would come this morning Lord once again that you would show yourself real minister to the hearts of your children Lord break the bread of life to them personally or let them know you love them and you care in Jesus name we ask amen amen God bless you and take your seats again this morning and I just want to uh I want to I want to look into this scripture this morning just a little bit and I need to set a little background so if I trust that will be okay for a few moments here but when we get to looking at the Scripture it says you know for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and when if you were to you know if we were to mention that word throne we get to we get to thinking uh we we get a mental picture of what that should look like and and you know sometimes when we get our our mental pictures you know things books we've read and and and you know documentaries you've seen and and all these different things we get mental pictures in our mind but sometimes those pictures actually cause us trouble when we get to reading the scripture they begin we find something that conflicts it's not really what God even though it's a it's maybe a shadow or a type but it's not really what God is trying to say it's not really what God means and and so you know we we get this idea sometimes that you know that God being so great in him being a king and him being Lord of all and you forgive me if I if if I'm just a little bit off this morning but but you know you you would get to thinking uh uh that you know God somewhere is out in the eternities he's sitting on a great throne and you know he's sitting in in his Royal robes with his crown on his head and and he's sitting there in all of his glory and all of his majesty and you know he's got this huge you know how you know the chairs I'm talking about a great magnificent chairs it's all stately and kingly and we get that kind of a picture when we're reading the scripture and we see that word thrown you know we think well that's you know there he is he's it's the king of kings and look at him in his majesty and his plan and I don't say that he's probably not that way but but we need to we need to forget about him being somewhere else out in the eternities and so I I want to bring this down you know we we get to looking at a mode in another dimension and brother Brown would speak this way and sometimes when we're in prayer we find ourselves actually in subconsciously thinking you know you get to praying and and you get down in your knees or you get to talk in the Lord and you're praying to something like way out there you understand what I'm saying this morning we're praying to God that's like way out there in eternities but I know you hear me Lord even though I can't see you but some words he's way out there but but he's not even though he is he's not as a fact you know brother Brown would make this statement you know that you know when Jesus was praying and he was praying In The Garden of Gethsemane and he was wrestling it out and and you know somebody would say to him you know well you know he was praying to God the father and brother Brown would come and say no he was praying to the God that was in him the God that was in him and so I I need to break this this thinking this morning of of a God in all of his Splendor even though I believe he is all of that but I need to break that mental picture that that he's sitting somewhere in a great throne in eternity you know Jesus said I'll go to sit on my father's throne and we get this mental picture that that's what it is but I think sometimes we're missing the actual revelation of what God is doing and brother Brown would say this as I get started here this morning you say this heavenly father is in prayer right now he says we are approaching listen to this we are approaching the Great Mighty Throne of God as mortal beings in a natural body and yet our voices speaking out words that's coming into that great Throne somewhere in the other dimension where God sits so you see brother Brown actually the same way we do he was praying but there's a greater reality to this and I want to take God and bring him where he is this morning even though he's omniscient so he covers all space all time you know he's he's omnipresent he's just there he's God but but I want I want to bring it to a different spot we would you know because God didn't it was never God's purpose to remain the Unseen God or he never would have created this Earth he never would have created Angelic beings he would never would have created cherubims and seraphims you say well yes that's that's God I mean he needs worship but it was never his idea to remain unseen he was trying to express himself and the only way he could begin to express himself because he is a Heavenly creature he's not an earth-bound creature like we are he would have to start in his expression would have to start in the heavens and then he would begin to condescend right around would say this that he when he created man he created him for a purpose and that's because God himself was lonely and God wanted fellowship and God's not just this spirit that floats around out there but he is actually a being he is actually a being and and so we know that you know in the condescending of God God would come down and and he would find himself not find himself he would create himself a tabernacle of Flesh and he would come and step into that Tabernacle and so in Matthew 28 we would find out that we would read a scripture like this that says you know it says all power in Heaven and Earth Jesus would say has been given into my hands all the power in Heaven and Earth all the power in Earth has been given unto me all right and my brother I would say what was it man and God had United now what was Jesus I mean we could look at him and we immediately think well he was the Redeemer he was you know he was the he was the great Lamb of God and yeah he was all of that but what actually was he he was actually the first of a new creation of God he was the first of a new creation of God even though he was all flesh he was all God it was all you know it wasn't just God in the Yonder somewheres now God had literally been birthed out and a body had been you know he had eaten he had he he you know he had I I would say this he had sucked on his mama's on his mama's breast he had nursed his just like just like every one of us had been born he subjected he became us like us that we could become like him so when we get to looking at these things you know you know the reality was that God was God was no longer just out in the heaven somewhere else now he's here and I want to I want to drop this in brother Brown says man and God had United the logus had been made flesh and had been killed and rose again for our justification and was the and was then the anointed Emmanuel forever now listen to quotes God changed his Dwelling Place from a throne Yonder out in the spaces Yonder to the heart of his son Christ Jesus to live and to Reign forever so was was the Throne of God still out yonder when Jesus was on Earth no no now Jesus had become that God had changed where he left The Eternity that he dwelt in he'd stepped into a body of Flesh and now that body had become Throne of God why the throne because the throne is where the king sits and when a king sits what he's what if if the only way you can be a king is if you have a kingdom and if you have a kingdom that means that you have a Dominion if you're the king and so that Tabernacle of clay that you know I keep looking up because at home we have the picture of Christ over here so I keep looking for that and I see you've got it right where it belongs you know where everybody can see it but that was the Throne of God that was the Throne of God while it was on Earth listen he said God was in Christ he's the final resting place of the spirit the spirit stayed tabernacled uh the spirit stayed in a tabernacle one day he gets to talking about you know trying to show the shadow of it in the Old Testament about how that God would come down with the children of Israel and find himself not just in the outer court and you we all know this because you've been taught well not just in the inner court but in the holiest of holies God would come to dwell there why would he come to dwell in a Tabernacle in a tabernacle of of tents and and a box of wood why would he come to do that to show that God what he wanted to be with his children listen he was trying to express it he didn't want to just stay Yonder you know they would say they followed him out by a pillar of fire which he was at night in a cloud a cloud during the day which he was the expression of what he was but Jehovah God would come and he would dwell with his children right in the same you all remember the scriptures they had there they had all their camps and all four sides of the uh you know of the Tabernacle of God and it's all a great representation of what what God is trying to accomplish and we don't have time to go into this this morning but the reality was that that right in the center of it all God would take his Dwelling Place and the only ones there was only one man that was allotted to go Beyond the Veil then but since the veil has been wrenched since Christ has died and the veil has been rent you and I are obligated to go Beyond the Veil and to go into the holiest of holies listen now it's death to stay just just to stay out in the you know justification is a good thing and out in the out in the outer Court they had justification they they'd bring their lamb and and the sacrifice would be made for them and they'd walk away justified in the eyes of God and that was a great thing and sanctification was a great thing they'd go into the you know they go into the inner court and there they would take their position their lives were clean they were they were you know God had done a work in them and their you know there was the the show bread and there was the candlesticks and and there was all you know the priests would do the work from the inner court and that and we've been called to be Kings and Priests and that was a great thing but but that is not where God wanted his children God himself was beyond that he was in the Holy place and he was actually waiting to bring his children listen what would happen when everyone would go behind the veil listen even the dead rod would Bud overnight and if his walk wasn't just right when he got behind the veil they would have pulled him out they would have dragged him back out he would have been a dead man but he and he alone was welcome to come be behind the veil well that was just a shadow of you and I he was a high priest he was he was the one that was making it but here we are and we The Veil The Way has been made and we have been invited I'm getting way off my topic this morning again Lord help me this morning you know we've been invited to go Beyond the Veil to get it to find ourselves in the place where God dwells and and so we know that that Ark was you know the ark was made out of wood and oh such beautiful types in the scripture but the ark was made out of wood and that's a representation of you and I just our Humanity but the reality was is when the when when God showed Moses how to build it it was literally encased in gold and what does gold represent deity that means that that the Life of Christ is greater than your life when God's looking at it he's looking at his life he's not looking at at the at the mortality of you know the wood the humanity of man he's not looking at that he's looking at the Gold that has been beaten out and and it's made it's been made a precious work before him just like the candlesticks in the old you know how the candlesticks in the Old Testament Moses he he sees the type and a shadow and here I'm getting off my notes again Lord help me this morning but we see Moses when the when the Candlestick is was made when those candlesticks were made which was a which was a type of the seven Church ages that would be and not just the church ages but literally your life would be around your life would be wound up in those ages and brother Brown would say that when Moses saw the the Candlestick being made he saw a lump of pure gold and that Candlestick was formed out of one lump of pure gold and a prophet would come and tell us that that those candlesticks represented the church ages and the life that was in the ages and what's it made out of gold which is Christ in the ages remember he's the one that walked in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks it's Christ in the ages I'm so thankful he looks on us this way Lord help me this morning anyhow you know God said he was looking at uh you know he's he's looking at uh at the Tabernacles that they made for him and he said you know silver and gold I I I I I I I have it all I don't need any of that what I need is a body and he says a body hast thou prepared for me and we would say we look at Jesus Christ this morning and we know he was the body of he was the body of Emmanuel God he was he's the body of Jehovah God manifested in this world and and brother Brown would go on to say this he said listen he said uh there's there's going to come a day you know Jesus said is you know I I sit with my uh you will sit with me in my Throne as I sit with my father and his throne and he'd say just a minute there there is going to come a day that Jesus is literally going to sit on a throne on a physical Throne you and I will be there in that new kingdom he'll sit on the throne of David and he will be king of kings he will be Lord of lords just like he would have been all along and just like he is to us this morning but he'll actually be there you and I will be able to you know wrap our arms around we'll be able to get down and kiss his precious feet and he'll just be he'll be there for us and he'll reign in that kind of a in that kind of a situation or as that kind of a king but but now now it says now listen brother Brown says this and he that overcomes will sit with me in my Throne as I have overcome and sat on my father's Throne he's wanting to come back and he says now where is his Earthly Throne the Throne of David God said he'd give him the Throne of David in the millennium okay so now we're back to that picture in our minds about a throne he'll give him the Throne of David in the Millennium he'll sit on David's throne and we'll see him the great king of kings sitting there there he is he said now now he's setting on his father's throne in other words now he brings it right back home today now he's sitting on his father's throne in other words he's setting in God's power now let's get an understanding of the throne here he is he's setting in the power he actually has the authority as king he has Authority overall he's got dominion over all things listen brother Brown would say this that even Satan has to come and ask permission like he did job hey have you considered my servant joke and then and when God draws a line in the sand that is as far like we don't have to fear about our lives when God draws a line in the sound that is as far as say he might take you to the door of death but unless God has called your name to come up Beyond the Veil Satan cannot take your life he just can't do it and so God as king sits on he's sitting he said on my father's Throne he's sitting there in the reality he is a king right now all right he said he's sitting in God's power in his Spirit now but when he comes back he'll set in an Earthly body on David's Throne I'm just establishing something here this morning so we we see that there was there was a throne that God had he had a Dominion in heaven and now we see God has moved from the heavenlies down into an Earthly Tabernacle which was the god man The One and Only God man that there was at the time and the Dominion of God has come down from the heavens and now Jesus says I judge all things I judge all things now the very Throne of God is in the Tabernacle of Christ I'm talking about when he was here on Earth but Brett Brown would say this God has three Thrones he's got three Thrones we think well that's kind of strange but it's not if we understand what God is really trying to do what God's really trying to accomplish what was the threefold purpose of God brother Brown would speak to this I think in the spoken words Original Seed what's the threefold purpose of God the first thing was God wanted to be able to express himself to make himself known then he wanted to have preeminence he wanted to to show them that he was King then he wanted to have preeminence in a bride body and then he wanted to restore the kingdom all right so listen brother Brown says this the first Throne was in heaven now listen close he said the Shekinah Glory was raised from The Mercy Seat one day in the Tabernacle he said father judges no man but he's committed all judgment to the son God's judgment seat wow he says he says you speak to me it'll be forgiven you speak uh be forgiven you speak against me it'll be forgiven you uh speak against another one that's coming now listen what brother Brown says he says you speak against the son of man I'll forgive you but someday the Holy Spirit Will Come and dwell in the hearts of the people now watch mom my goodness you talk about the Judgment of God you know there's Jesus when he was he was on Earth there's Jesus when he was on Earth and they begin to call him Beelzebub and they call them all sorts of vowel names and he would be he would so much as say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing father forgive them that you know they had to do that for our sake he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and he would stand there and saying you say these things now and I'll forgive you for it but there's one coming the Judgment of God was was going to become more since it was going to become more severe because the one that's coming behind me Now isn't that just a good Trinity thing it's not just perfect for the Catholics there's God the Father there's Jesus and and he said when the Holy Spirit comes there's another so now we have three and that's such nonsense but the spirit of God when he begins to come again you speak against him now he's got a redeemed body you know I think the scripture would say this you know we go to the communion table and say yeah we read the scripture where we talk about you know that many are weak and sickly among you because you don't discern the body of the Lord and we think well that's just the broken bread and the wine and that has nothing to do with it that's just that that's those are just that's just the the you know what we take and what what we do is as what's been given to us but I'm looking at the body of the Lord I'm looking at the body of the lord we don't discern the body of the Lord and brother Brown would say this he goes back to scripture he says he says but the holy spirit will come and dwell in the hearts of the people and one word against it it will never be forgiven oh how careful are we to be how careful a hot way to be listen brother says it keeps getting more severe more severe all the time the Judgment because God is continually wearing his patients out trying to get Sinners to come to Christ to be reconciled first he was in the heavens above shining through the Stars second he was on the earth shining through the Shekinah Glory next he came and went and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he's still wearing his patience out then he redeemed Man by the blood and came into his church in the form of the Holy Ghost and speak against that and it's a finished thing it's done now you can see the shaking time that we're in where he says the people just don't realize people can't comprehend what it means now listen what he says the first Throne was in heaven the Judgment seat the second throne was in Christ the third throne is in man all right the third Throne is in man and brother Brown would go on to say this God chose man's heart for his con for his control tower the devil chose his head for his control tower see he makes him see things and look through his eyes but God it's God in his heart makes him believe things that he cannot see he said did he of course we would say amen he said see God is on his heart in the heart of man is the Throne of God oh well hold on now the big picture of the big ornate chair that the king I I think we're right about the time that the new king is going to be you know crowned here pretty soon and and I you know I just seen a little clip here when we were staying the other night man they got a golden Chariot what would you call that that Carriage whatever it was I mean it is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful and he's a sin-born unregenerated filthy dirty defiled I say well brother Dwayne don't say that about our King listen I don't care what kind of man he is God is not a respecter of person it takes the blood to cover it all you look at him been married divorced ran around and and all the filthiness in this world is going to count him King I'll tell you what I'm thankful for a king he didn't come in a chariot a splendor like that you know all the eyes of the world weren't on him he'd come in in humility brother Brown would say this he said God uh he said did you get it ma'am God made his throne in the heart of man so now I want I want to I want to just go back and read that scripture again I'm just going to read verse if we can just get on down to about verse 17. I want to read that scripture again if you got it says for the lamb and and maybe just take and leave it up there if that works all right verse 17 we'll go back to Revelations chapter 7 and verse 17 and now I want to take my text from here now that we've established this for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of water for the lamb which is in the midst for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne come on don't you go and put it off way into the Millennium somewheres don't you go wait till he's sitting on his throne and you know in the Millennium for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne where is the Throne of God in the heart of man for the lamb which is in the mid where does the Holy Ghost come to dwell in the heart of man what did the Holy Ghost promise to do to you I will lead you and guide you into all truth for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne will lead you and guide you what does it say will lead you unto living Fountains of water and they say well yeah but brother Dwayne it says and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes well I didn't do very good in school but those two little dots that's a correlation that all he will also do that but let's look at it the way it's look at the way it's written for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne that's the holy ghost that is sitting on the throne of your life right now shall lead you and shall feed you and Lead You unto living Fountains of water all right so I want to look at this little this little thought of of waters and and living Fountains of water and it's always been God's purpose you know brother Brown would say this if you get God on the inside then then everything that you begin the moral Gods you get on the inside the more you look around you you begin to see more of God on the outside I'll tell you what you get in love with the author of the book and he's gonna he's gonna show you he's going to reveal to you his little hidden secrets his little love letters here I am here I am in your midst listen not just in the midst of the congregation here but in your midst in this vessel right now here I am in your midst of if we could just recognize that God has come to to be crowned the king of my life I want to Crown Him King in my life I want him to have dominion in my life when you get the Holy Ghost in your life now he's promised to lead you and to guide you through life and where is he at is he is he out there he honor yes he is but he's in his word and he becomes the quickening spirit that literally quickens his word gives you dominion over sin gives you a dominion over your flesh gives you dominion over over the lust of the eye and the lust of the Flesh and all these things that Satan would use to drag you down now the god that's in you come on Church the god that's in you not just the god that's around you listen Peter and Paul and not Paul Peter and James and John and and all the disciples they had Jesus around them they they they were right there and and there he was in his ministry and they surrounded him and I tell you what he'd even gave him them power over over unclean spirits and over devils and and giving them the ability to you know to cast out devils in his name and preach the gospel and and but they have Jesus there around them and then one day he wasn't around them and they found this man that had epilepsy and and you know he he got you know that he went into a fit and and they began trying to cast these Devils out and the devil wouldn't leave and it wouldn't leave and it wouldn't leave it and finally Jesus came and said why couldn't we cast The Devil out and he looked right at him and said oh ye of little faith and not many days hence not long after that Jesus gets called to that little point in his life where he's got to be willing to die to death and Peter or that man that had sat there with him and said I'll go with you to the death I'll stand right beside you remember Jesus around them there's a difference here Jesus around them absolutely standing in a I want to say in a Sanctified condition and Jesus would look at him and say Peter before this day is over you're going to deny me three times not on your life Lord you know Peter just had that kind of a he was just bold like a lion and he said not on your life I'll go with you to the death and Jesus looked right at him and said not today you won't not today you want but Peter when you're converted strengthen your brother you know so many times we come to this place in our lives where where the spirit of God you know we we've got I'm gonna say we got the best of it all we got the full word of God being revealed to us and yet just knowing that God sent a prophet don't save you just knowing that there that a message has come to deliver us don't save let me rephrase that maybe it'll save you but God don't want you to stay there I'll tell you what every Israelite that came in could bring their lamb and they could be justified for their sins and sit in the congregation and enjoy the Fellowship of the brothers and and it felt so good but they would still go back out and fall to the same things over and over and over and over and bring their lamb back God forgive me again and over and over and bring their lamb back and God forgive me again and he did and he did he's God and he loves us but God wasn't Desiring for them to stay there in the outer Court God was desirous that they would that they would move from a state of justification to the state of sanctification here's here's the disciples standing in an absolutely Sanctified condition standing there you know you know Jesus says literally he's there with them but he knew he wasn't going to be with them forever the plan of God was listen I'm not going to be with you forever I'm going to come back though and I'm going to live in you and it's going to give you power to stand the test of time it's going to give you power against the enemy you're you're going to have what it takes because Jesus had that power he was that God he had the ability in him to withstand every test and overcome every enemy he could just stay he was that God and here's his disciples around him and they want to listen they want to be like Jesus and you and I sing that song over and over to be like Jesus to be like oh on Earth I long to be like him but do you really do I really because he had no home to go to you got a nice home I got a comfortable home Ed no place to lay his head but I can come here or I can go to Alberta or I can go to British Columbia or I can go across the ocean and there's Saints like you that would give me a place to lay my head but he had no place to call his own he was literally despised and rejected of all men well yeah but not his children oh let me let's back up a little bit Peter before this day is over you'll deny me three times no way Lord no way Lord you go back and read your Bible and literally when Peter is put on the spot and you know he's standing there in that court and Jesus has been taken in there he's standing there in the court and Peter's you know it's cold out and I'll tell you what you get away from God and you'll get cold you get cold real fast he's standing there by a fire trying to man-made fire trying to warm himself and and and and a woman says to him hey you look Vaguely Familiar are you one of them no no I don't know anything about those people and then they begin to communicate she says hey you talk like them people I'll tell you the bride the Bride of Jesus Christ talks different all right we have a different language we got a pure language a Heavenly language and Peter had been around Christ long enough that he caught the way he talked and hey you even sound like him the Bible says that Peter literally cursed can you imagine can you imagine brother Gerald what a testimony what a testimony Peter literally cursed I don't know him here's the good part you realize that Judas did the same thing sold them out for 30 pieces of silver and God said I'll never forgive it Son of Perdition he fulfilled his part Peter did the same thing walked away from me he didn't sell him out but walked away and cursed proclaimed I never knew him I had no part of him but the grace of God cause he was already elected to be a Son of God the grace of God covered it anyhow it's not precious ain't that precious man here I am off my notes again Mercy I don't know what you people do but you're doing something to me and that I got to get back to my notes because otherwise we're going to be here till lunch I want us to just jump back and look you know when we think about the the water I'll lead you to Living Waters Living Waters and you know if we just jump back to we could go back to the Book of Genesis and we could you know we could have a look at we begin to see God as he begins to unveil and express himself and what's the first thing that we that we find happening in Genesis after creation is all set up and you know the Garden of Eden is all set up and I'm going to jump into Genesis chapter 2 for a moment here and I'm just going to begin to read it because I want us to I want to catch us I want us to catch something here said in the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden this is verse 8. the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed now watch the wording and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the site and good for food now watch what he says the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil who was the Tree of Life who's absolutely Christ Jesus Christ who was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Satan what were the other trees in the garden then if one was a man and the other was a man what were the other trees in the garden just food for thought we'll go on I just want you to catch that this morning and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and a river went out of Eden to water the garden and a river went out of Eden to water the garden in other words God himself the great husband and planted a garden in this earth and it needed to be watered now we're just looking so many so often we look at these things and we just read them natural and we get these and they're they are as natural but listen does God is God not a husband man is he not the one that loves to tend the garden is he not the one that said he would prune the trees these branches that don't bring forth out for well hold on what's he talking about he's talking about people's lives he's talking about men that the great God of creation is beginning to express himself even in his creation he's coming down and he's beginning to express himself what is this great Garden of Eden we want to look at that spot and say well it was the paradise of God but the word would say that that every fruitful tree every good tree was there in the garden and that that kind of tree was good for it was good the ones that would sustain you and I trees that would sustain you and I just love it you know you begin to go through the scripture and you find trees that represent kingdoms and and trees that represent Nations and trees that represent Kings and what was it it's that God is trying to express himself he's trying to show a pattern there's trees there that literally are going to feed his children and can I say it this way God has still had trees all down even though this world has become sin cursed there is still trees that God fruit trees that God is using to feed his children and I'm looking at an old oak tree sitting in the back right now that God has used us to feed his children for the last 40 years he's given to you a weekend and week out he's been faithful he's he's literally been standing by the River of Life and sucking up the the moisture of God so that he could do what give out to you and every now and again you know maybe the season would change and and like we have a fall season and a winter and a spring and he'd call somebody else in and what was it it would be another tree of life that he would call in to do what to bring fruit so that you could eat you see God's God the patterns of God are the same he's trying to express himself in everything and out of the Garden of Eden goes what a river a river because without moisture we're nothing here's a great spirit of God going out here I'm just going to so we recognize brother Brown says this he says he prophesied that he would give them Living Waters and if a man drank he would never thirst again but would live eternally he showed himself as The Great I Am he is the bread of life now listen close he is the bread of life The Well of life the Eternal one the tree of life he was back there in the midst of the garden and even as he will be in the midst of the paradise of God now so we think of Paradise in one way but God thinks of it in a total different way God could like that he can create whatever he wants I believe I'm looking at the paradise of God I'm looking that what was what do we look at Eden and we say Oh Maya that's pear we all look for a paradise like that you know if you're like me man for years and years I you know I had one thing in my mind and I I believe God just gives us the desires of our hearts and you know as you see these little you go by the travel places and you see these little you know grass thatched huts and you know they got the grass on them and they're by these these just turquoise blue uh you know oceans and White Sands and it just looks like oh if I could just get there I could just relax I could just let off all the pressure it would just be so good don't you think so yeah right no it doesn't work like that it doesn't work like that because wherever you are you are uh you know many years ago I was over in New Zealand preaching an Easter meeting and at my sister-in-law lived in Fiji at the time it just worked that we could go there and she not unbeknownst uneven nothing said she just texted my wife and said hey I Connie we got we got a little getaway plan for you and and Dwayne and and when you get here this is what we want to do and I mean it was the very thing that I had looked for for all my life I thought oh we could just get there came off a week of meetings brother brother Gerald you know what I'm talking about I came off a week of meetings and you're so so caught in the spirit so wound up I got there and we had the place for three days and on the third day we were about to leave and my wife looks at me she goes oh welcome now we leave couldn't enjoy it I wanted to but I couldn't my spirit was in a different place and I was caught between these dimensions of trying to come back to earth and just enjoy life I'd wander around and look at the seed there's nothing really why because nothing on this world satisfies nothing it's all there it's all we will enjoy it all one day but in this flesh you have to actually be in the flesh to enjoy it and I got to be there for a while before I can enjoy it but but you see there's God is wanting rivers of Living Water he's wanting to feed us with the Waters of of Living Water and you know there's you know we look at Abraham the Great patriarch of the faith and and and and you know he had God had given him a a promise that you were going to have a son and I'm gonna I'm gonna raise up a lineage unto you uh you know people that that are Faith are our faith-based people they got my spirit in them and we know you know Abraham and he'd gone so many years and Sarah had gotten trouble about she'd heard the promise of God just I would say like the uh like like so often we get you know God's given us promise and and time goes on and if we're not careful we get to wondering God are you going to keep your word God are you going to keep your word Lord I I thought I heard you right are you really going to keep your word and you know Abraham it had become a revelation to him but it had not become Revelation to his wife Sarah even though they had lived together and they know they were their husband and wife and and but she was part of the promise because she was part of Abraham oh I hope you get that this morning church you are part of the promise because you're part of Christ you are part of the inheritance because you're part of him and here's you know here's Abraham and he's got this little wife and and Sarah finally gets to the place she says listen Abraham I'm getting too old I just can't go I don't know if God's gonna do this are you sure you misunderstood why don't you take my hands Maiden Hagar and you live with her and bring forth a child and and I'm sure that's what probably what God had in mind but that's not what God had in mind God don't want you taking some man-made idea God doesn't want you consuming yourself with some man-made thought he doesn't want you trying to bring his promises to uh to pass in your life he wants to bring him to pass and when he brings him listen you try to bring it to pass and you end up in the same boat that Hagar ended up in same boat Sarah and she wanted Abraham to have a son like God wanted Abraham to have a son she wanted to have a little boy running around just like any other woman wants a little boy running around but when she gave haggar to Abraham we find out what did it costs it caused nothing but trouble matters of fact when Hagar conceived and Hager started getting all this attention and you know I'm sure Abraham he was still his son either way listen haggar's son Ishmael was still Abraham was still his father to this day you go and talk to to the those people of those countries and they Proclaim Abraham is our father they just don't recognize Jesus as the Christ but they Proclaim Abraham is the muhammadans the Buddhists they operate I've known what the Buddhist but I know the Bahamas do for sure they believe Abraham is their father and he is can you go read the scriptures and you find out that that here's Sarah and also she sees haggar getting all this attention and this little boy come on church this is a little baby Abraham's waited for years to have a son and now he has a son just not a god-given son this one was conceived of a man's idea of a woman's idea and here's this little boy and this boy and Abraham starts paying attention and the Bible says and when Sarah looked at Hagar she resented her all of a sudden there's this conflict why because Sarah was promised a son but because that she had that she had to try and make it come to bed God said go ahead give her a rehearse desire but what did it cause conflict how about the time you start trying to make your own will happen by the time you start trying to think you know God I I believe you promised this and I believe you promised that and I just believe I'm just going to go get it and make it happen listen you leave those things up to God you leave your I think brother Jonathan I think you said something about your your you know your our positions in life and and what do you call that your occupation whatever you you had a nice word for it I don't have that but anyhow yeah you know what I'm saying your position in life and you know like I'm listen Joseph God exalted Joseph Joseph didn't have to exalt himself he didn't have to work day and night and day and night and try and please the boss I don't know why I'm on this right now but he didn't have to do that he found favor in the eyes of he was just Joseph he just did what he was doing and God blessed him because of it he found favor so when we go to try and making God's promises come to pass you're going to come you're going to find out you're going to find yourself in a terrible predicament one day you're going to stretch out and while brother Dwayne I live by faith so I'm going to buy the best and I'm going to have the best and I'm going to own the best and God's promise to take care of me no he didn't he said he'd provide your needs and you might find yourself like I talked about brother Corey the other you might find yourself in a box on the street someday When God says that's not my plan for your life it's best to say father thy will be done I thy kingdom come here I'm way off my notes again let's go back so we see you know we got haggers there anyhow and she's she's got this little baby and Sarah sends her out into the desert she says just get rid of her go on and Abraham says do what you want she's your hands made you know go on and we find out that that hagger gets out in the desert and here she is dying of thirst but here's the part that's blessed she's dying of thirst and somehow her eyes are open to a well of water that's out there in the wilderness and it's an angel that comes and talks to her says no hagger you're not going to die and the child's not going to die how can the child die it's Abraham's seed come on Church how can even though it was conceived in all the wrong ways it was still Abraham's seed it cannot die God has a promise God's going to raise up that seed just the same and here's little haggar and she she gets this you know you know the word from the angel that she's not going to die just go home it's going to be okay but what did God lead her to a fountain of water a fountain of water she was absolutely desolate dying she thought life was over there was no hope for me but God opened her eyes to a what Fountain of water matter of the fact she'd go ahead and call it I'm not even going to try Bell hello Lori or something like that some of you some of you brothers be able to pronounce that but I I don't but I know what it means it means The God Who lives sees me I might not be able to pronounce the name but the God who lives listen that was 4 000 or maybe six thousand five thousand years ago but the God who lives sees me this morning that same God sees you this morning where you're at he knows if you're empty he knows if you're dry and he knows how to show you where The Well of of water is The Well of life is how about Moses when they're out in the you know leading the children when they're out in the wilderness there the children got to complaining all of a sudden they found themselves you know without water and and you know they're coming down pretty hard on the pastor right now because because they were just feeling empty and we just don't feel like we've got hey you know we're just we're just hungry and we just don't feel like we're being fed anymore and Moses and Aaron go to before God and they begin to cry out and God says go and go and speak to the Rock and it'll bring forth his Waters why didn't he say it's Waters why didn't he say Moses just go go speak to the Rock it'll bring forth its Waters a rock isn't it it's just a uh you know a hard what do you call it I don't know just a hard piece of dirt I guess I don't know what they're even made out of stone I see how God does most ridiculous things go speak to the Rock why because the rock was not just a rock go read the chapter go read Corinthians what would Paul say he says The Rock was Christ go speak to the Rock and we know the story you know Abraham or Abraham Moses would go and because of the pressure of the people and he you know he already had a little issue with his temper and because of the pressure of people he'd take the same the Judgment Rod of God that led the children out of is out of Egypt and he'd take the same rod in his anger and he would instead of speaking to the Rock he would Smite The Rock but this is just the same The Rock still gave out its water you know brother Brown would bring this to reality to us just like the paintings that we see you know there's the Rock and Moses and the little stream trickling up we know we know that wasn't what it was it was there was two million people just besides all the animals and everything else we did that last night we just we touched on this little thing fill my cup Lord I asked that little sister right here how big was your cup this big and this morning I asked her and she said it was a barrel I brought a barrel bless her heart but listen The Rock was Christ it wasn't just a stone out in the wilderness matters in fact if you go and read the scriptures the Bible say the rock followed them through the wilderness I'll never leave you and I won't forsake you the rock followed them through the wilderness why because it was Living Waters I will sit on the throne the lamb that sits on the throne will lead you to Living Waters Fountains of Living Waters you know a prophet of God would come out in this generation he would look he would look at at the ministry of the of the age that we're living in and he'd come right down to the Pentecostal pastors and the Baptist pastors and you know the Methodist preachers and he would pull out a a little thought out of Jeremiah he says and you've hewed yourself cisterns you forsaken me the Living Word of God you forsaken me you forsaken me and you've hewed to yourself cisterns when I could have given you Living Waters and now because you polluted the water now you're going to die listen church we can say oh brother Dwayne you know that that that that was that was brother Branham speaking to the you know to the Pentecostal people and he was right at the LA at the last part of Lady of CN and he was rebuking them but I'll tell you what the same spirit of God could come down to you we don't we don't maybe have denominations around the message but you can become it'll never the message will never denominate but you can become denominational you can stop in your walk if the day you stop walking with the Lord remember this Our God the son is like the s-u-n it never stops IT continually comes up and it goes down it keeps moving and the moment you stop and say you know what I got it I understand it this is what I've got I know this is truth and I praise God I've just got it the moment you stop in your walk with the Lord I don't care if you're here for 15 years or if you've been here for brother Gerald forgive me for this but if you've been here for 42 years or 43 years it doesn't matter if we ever stop listen the spirit of God never stops moving it's always taking us higher always taking us higher and if we ever get hunkered down and stop what happens we now get a true now we become traditional and we start cueing out man-made tradition this is how you know I I so are you going to different churches and if we're not careful we could we become traditional too don't just look out at the Baptist and the Pentecost if we're not careful we become traditional we want to put God in a little box and say you know what Lord I'll let you move if you do it this way because that's what I've been raised and that's how I'm comfortable and God's going to say you know what that's fine but I'm not staying there if you want to come follow me follow me God is not interested in our little boxes church I preach this at home all the time we can become traditional and God bless you brother Gerald I want to take my spiritual hat off to you today brother Jonathan told me don't even think about the time brother Gerald has taught us better than that but I'll tell you what I've been in churches and I know this to be true I have been in churches ministering before them and at 10 minutes to 12. all of a sudden people start fidgeting they just get they just start fidgeting and you're thinking what's wrong like what's happening because their Pastor has closed at 12 o'clock on the dot for the last 20 years it programmed the people you know what you just did you created a tradition in your church you absolutely bucks got up and said at 12 o'clock Lord we are done here and we're going home this whether you've moved or not we're going home by then God forbid I don't believe for a minute God said I will lead you to rivers of live Fountains of Living Water and it might the fountain that might the gusher might not come forth to 12 15 12 35 quarter to one you don't know listen you and I we're we're sorry God forgive me for using this I think this is a mourner's mention we're not mourning this morning we're rejoicing but listen you go home and you you'll sit down in front of your little uh you know your little handheld tablet or your computer or whatever you got and you'll get onto YouTube and you'll start looking at something and you'll be scrolling and what up three hours later you'll look at the time and think where did the time go and then you'll pick up a message book and you'll read it for about 10 minutes and also you'll be drifting off you'll think oh Lord come on what kind of battles are we fighting this morning church what kind of battles are we fighting this morning we are contending earnestly for the faith of God Satan knows how to Captivate you it used to be a television and brother Brian would rebuke us and say shame on you you Pentecostal people you wouldn't go out to the movies and now he says you brought a television into your home but watch how slick he said Satan pulled one over on you and he said and he bought and he put one in your house and I believe we're children of God and we'd be careful what we watched anyhow about watch how shrewd he is in this last day he won't only put one in your house but now brother he'll put it right in your pocket and it's not just a television it is whatever you desire it is called YouTube because it's all about you if you like cars you can watch it there if you like building you can watch it there if you've got a problem with your truck brother and you don't know how to fix it you're going to go to YouTube and you're going to figure out how to fix your truck because it's there what is it it's all the wisdom it's all the knowledge it's all the understanding and not hardly any of it praise God brother Gerald my hat comes off to you again first website I just got just he was just telling me about that listen there was hardly for years there was nothing about God and now we're finally starting to see the spirit of the Living God can take Satan's Eden and use it for his own Glory but let me tell you something you can be as distracted as anything we waste more of our time in front of Satan's devices oh I'll tell you what would we be you know what brother Jonathan you said something we were talking about something you said you have to schedule it you know because some of us are just natured that way you got to schedule it I would just make a suggestion I'm so far off my notes right now I'll just make a suggestion to you this morning if you can't control you I suggest that you schedule in your time with the Lord and make it a priority in your life if you can't control you if you don't know how to just shut it off and walk away from it you know for years I would take and put my phone in a different room when I slept I would just shut it off as a pastor I can't shut it off but it's still in the other room I don't care about the beep I don't care about the buzz I don't care about the twinkle or whatever the little whatever little icon thing comes your way every time you get a message I don't care about any of that and I would just encourage you how many of you first thing in the morning you wake up and the first thing you reach for just check the time right in case you can sleep for 10 more minutes but I got all these messages Well that took me about 10 minutes and then huh I wonder what the news is that took me 30 minutes and got to fix my truck and now I gotta go to work and I haven't spent one minute with the Lord deception deception Lord help me let me just jump down I'm just going to skip a whole bunch of this this morning for time today I kept you so long this weekend I'm ashamed of myself all right you know we go back to the scripture and Jesus would our Peter would say to them and Paul would say to the Corinthians he'd say listen speaking about that rock he would say that rock was Christ that rock was Christ you know and isn't it true I mean when they smote it he didn't just give him a little bit Christ isn't here just to give you a little trickle the River of Life is flowing the River of Life is Flowing he came to bring you a stream not just a stream but a river he came to absolutely supply all your needs to quench the very thirst of God in your life he came to do that for you and you know you remember out in the wilderness when they were you know I think it was back in the days of uh not ahab's son jaharam or something like that do you remember when him and Jehoshaphat made a you know there's a great Warfare going on and johoram said Joshua I need you to come and stand by and stand by my side I I need somebody to fight with me and and Jehoshaphat said yeah sure I'll go I think there was like five Kings or I might be mixed up a little bit no there wasn't that was in a different time but you know they were going they went out into the Wilderness in the Bible say this that you know they went out seven days journey and then they found out hey we ran out of water we got nothing to feed our animals and we haven't even started this battle yet we've got nothing to sustain us and we we haven't even started our battle and now and now what do we do and Jehoshaphat as a godly man would look at jeharram and say hey isn't there a Prophet or something in this land isn't there somebody a God-fearing man some words that we could go talk to we got a Warfare coming on here and we haven't gone very far isn't there a God-fearing man oh yeah of course you know Elisha is there and we can we go talk to him and here comes isn't it funny how how Cycles repeat because wasn't it Ahab that had the same problem with Elijah and Elijah would look at him and say if it wasn't for Elisha I wouldn't even if it wasn't for Joshua I wouldn't even look at you and now here we have johoram's son ahab's son in the same predicament and Elijah should say hey if it wasn't for Elisha if it wasn't for uh Jehoshaphat this godly man I wouldn't even consider what you're talking about right now you know it actually frustrated actually made it made I'd say this it made Elisha spiritually angry that these two men would would somehow get together but God will not forsake his own even in your mistakes God will not forsake you here's Jehoshaphat absolutely married up in the wrong crowd and and now they go to the word of God the living word for that day and and Elisha would say listen listen I I ca there's no way I can I'm so angry about what you've done right now my spirit is so upset come on Daddy Come on Mommy come on preacher brother Jonathan let me talk to you for a minute there comes times that you're going to come into this building and you are going to be so frustrated because of what's happened at home and how the enemy just hey I I my wife married a preacher she knows what I'm talking about brother brother Gerald you understand sister Betty you know you're just trying to get the kids and you're trying to get to church and hell just breaks loose and I mean you just can't anybody that's got a Ministry in the church hell just breaks loose and they begin to fight and there's fights going on in the car and dad's trying to oh Lord how am I supposed to preach the gospel I I'm so uptight and I'm so nervous and what do you do what do you do you come in and the music is playing you set the atmosphere and what Elisha do bring me a menstrual bring me a Minstrel hey brothers this is the importance of Music in this congregation bring me a Minstrel bring me somebody that can bring the presence of God in the air in the more in in the in the ministry of music you know that your ministry can heal brother Brown literally says you can be healed by the music you can be healed by them by the worship Brothers you know that the songs you're singing sisters you know those specials you sing you might you you might there might be somebody here with a broken heart this morning and that's special will take the love of God will take and bind it back together again this is the body of Christ and so here we are and Elijah's just Jesus cranky he says I wouldn't even look at you I wouldn't even think about this this morning and they said bring me a Minstrel what's he doing just get mad get my spirit calmed down lord I need to I need to get in your presence I need to I need to get away with you or I need I need an answer from you Lord I need to know what to do here's these nations God one of these is your children and he's got himself mixed up in all this nonsense and God you can't just leave them like this he's yours and all of a sudden the music begins to play just real sweet and you know down at the cross where my savior died therefore cleansing for sin I cried and also in the spirit of God one down here's Elisha and all of a sudden that Spirit begins to move upon him he says go out and dig ditches what it's a desert go out into dig ditches huh some brothers sometimes when God speaks it ain't nothing about the way you think it's going to be but if you'll be obedient he will fulfill his word he will fulfill his word can you imagine the thinking behind or talking Mighty Men of Valor we're talking Warriors soldiers going out to fight a battle and now the Commanding Officer says hey guys listen I know we've run out of water but the thing that we're going to do is we're going to go out into the desert and we're just going to start digging ditches because there's water there somewheres you know your country is one thing in our country it's a little different we don't have water everywhere so you know what they do to dig a well these men walk sometimes with these sticks in their hands or these little wires in their hands and as they're walking along they call it witching as they're walking along if they hit a water vein underneath those wires will go like this and you'll know right there is where you drill your well it's a for real thing I tell you what kimi's can you see those men well let's get some branches and let's go figure out where where's the water in this desert I tell you what I want you troops going that way I want that troop going that way we got to figure out where the no no that's not what Elisha said at all don't try and figure it out just get in the desert and start digging dishes just get where just get in your Battle Zone and start digging out the trash and Brethren would say this he says they got to you know he says they they didn't know what they're going to do I I can hear the humanity I could I can just hear how we would be brother Mark we'd start digging and the sun's beating down on us and we think is our Superior is he crazy is he is who is this crazy man that gave this kind of a direction dig ditches they just dig in the desert what are we supposed to do dig in the desert and I can see you know you know I can see Jehoshaphat standing there and making sure he's telling the captains of the host saying Hey listen listen I don't want you digging little ditches I want those ditches wide I want those ditches deep I can hear men complain listen any time that that God wants to do something in your life Satan is going to be there to buff at you and you're not going to want to dig the ditch out but let me say this in the name of the Lord this morning dig the ditches of your life out watch brother Brown said as they begin to dig you know the word of God sometimes it gets sharp and and it gets it gets to a place in our lives where we don't like it it comes down so close and you don't run around and make a statement like this he said you know maybe your pastor gets a preaching on he'll get to preaching on tithing and offering and you you know you don't pay your time so it's like I don't like that I didn't enjoy that service I don't really want to hear that because because it convicts me we don't want to hear about that come on that's just as much part of the word of God as any other part of the word of God not just the fact that you're Son of God and that you've got power and you've got authority over the devil and and you can you can oh you could you can climb all the mountains and you can take your Mountain we love to hear those things but when it comes to our daily life and a pastor come and the spirit of God moves him he begins to talk about tithing and offering and and the importance of it and and how vital it is to you and you you know you know I've heard people say this further Dwayne I I heard a pastor tell me this one time and it just floored me I both fell out of my chair he said brother Dwayne he said my people are so poor he says I can't expect them to pay tithes and offerings I looked at him I said brother the reason they're poor is because they don't pay tithes and offerings I said the word says that if you would give God his portion I don't know how I got here this morning but if you would give God his portion he would open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing on you that you can't even contain yeah but brother Dwayne you don't understand no I do understand listen I know what it's like to have that little woman right there try and raise a family try and buy groceries for two hundred dollars a month for four kids how am I going to do it honey I don't know and you know how good her husband was about things next day church next Sunday at church somebody visited me there hey come on over for dinner never gave a second thought and she'd be like what am I gonna what am I going to serve them I don't know you'll figure it out you know men we just sometimes Jonathan's Blanca I'm sorry sis he said you can't afford not to pay your tithes brother Dwayne I'm going back many many years brother Gerald you don't know where I'm at I'm going back many years you know when a mortgage was 300 a month and it's dating isn't it yeah and your car payment was 200 a month and then all the kids and the gas and then insurance and everything else and your life your cost of living was twelve hundred dollars a month and you made a thousand what am I going to do now I'm going to be faithful I was so far off this morning I'm going to be faithful you know one day the Lord spoke to me about that because we all struggle with this because of the pressures of life that we live under as soon as we get down we see the bills getting too much we're like Lord you understand he says yes son I do what you're about to do is not good but Lord you understand I need this money I know I want you to have it but I want to be your provider remember the testimony I gave you last night about that needing my land payment God does that all the time if you serve him and if you give him Brothers I don't know what is going on Jonathan you can just ship me out and never have to call me back again but listen I'm just going to just preach because it's all my heart God requires the first fruit God requires the first fruit I remember when I caught this revelation you know the money you make God gave you ten percent more than you deserve to have period foreign I hardly have enough to pay my bills he gave you it's not your money to begin with he gave you the health he gave you the strength he gave you the position he opened the door he he actually put something on your employer's heart to pay you yeah but brother Dwayne my bills are so high and I listen he gave you ten percent more you know what God wanted to do about it you know what he want to do about it he wanted to see if I was willing to give it back so he lets the bills come in and I'm looking at it and my heart is a daddy because I am the provider I'm the provider of my home I'm the one that's going to make the ends meet I know what it's like when the truck breaks down you know it's not a quick trip to the store and 120 dollars later it's six thousand dollars it's ten thousand dollars and you're going I've got this credit card maxed out that one maxed out this one maxed out I don't know I can't handle one more thing you know what he likes to do I'll just be honest we're all we're all just Flesh and Blood living in ladies here come on we've all been through this brother Mark have we been through this maybe you haven't but I've been through this asked the wrong guy that time didn't I let's go it goes to show I don't know anybody here but listen you know the pressure just gets greater and it gets greater and it gets greater and you're doing all you can Sarah that little child who I'm talking about ishmael's child or Ishmael you're doing all you can to make sure that God keeps his word so swipe it or swipe it hey guess what brother Jonathan well this is the Bank of Nova Scotia calling and we've got a new credit limit for you [Applause] right now great and Satan's going and God's shaking his head saying don't do it but you don't understand I need the money right now no what you need to do is let God show himself as God you're still trying to make it happen we had some saints move into into our congregation here a little while ago I looked at him I said first thing I said when you come to our country I sat down and said the first thing do not a young family said do not allow them to trap you with a credit card it will kill you well brother Dwayne how do you even live without a credit card it's not the credit card but we all do the same thing nice shoes oh I'll take two pairs I need another Tikka gun is going to pay for it this is the world we're living in these are The Temptations we're under and we're sitting here today and God is saying but I want to be I want to prove to you that I am the god that provides all your needs I'm the one I'll even give you your heart's desire if you'll serve me one day became a revelation to me and I laid I I sat down at the table I said Lord here's my bills and here's my finances and you know them both and I can't even make them work but by faith and uh do you guys still do checks some by faith and I dropped it in the tithing box guess what bills got paid don't ask me how but they got paid the next month and the bills got paid the next month and the bills got paid and one day my old truck which had 400 plus thousand kilometers as I was beaten up and down the road preaching the gospel with and I was wondering Lord how long is this thing going to last I don't know I had a need but I didn't have the money I'm just I'm just telling them now if I'm Lord you know what's going on one day I get a phone call from a brother Dwayne he's like listen God's put something on my heart and I just need to talk to you about it can I just back up a little bit before I get the phone call I'm like a man like you we all have dreams we all have plans we you know if you're going to pick something if you're going to pick a different vehicle you already know kind of what you want and what it would be like and if you had your desire you know what you want I'm just same as everybody else you know we lived out in the back woods and so we had all these kids and so a Suburban was appropriate for us and and my wife asked her sister honey if you get a different vehicle what would you buy I said well we're just laying in bed chatting chatting father's not present he doesn't care we're just laying there chatting I said well if I could have my heart's desire I'm like well I think I'd like another Suburban but this one I want a diesel and I want to you know I want to make sure it has leather you know tan leather interior and I'm just dreaming got four kids and that's easy to wipe up and guess what I get a phone call from a brother maybe about I don't know a month after that three weeks from that a brother who owns a car lot he's like hey brother Dwayne a vehicle just came in he says and I haven't talked to anybody except that lady right there a vehicle comes in I think I think it would be a good one for you I'm like oh what is it this is a Suburban just like you got I said really yeah I said septic God is diesel in it I'm like really he says yeah you know the truck I'm like oh I do he goes yeah it was one of your customers I used to sell farm equipment this is one of your customers I'm like oh I knew it had lots of troubles too because I knew the man I thought well maybe he's got it all worked out and I'm like hey Warren just buy per chance what color is the interior I said great I said oh that's okay he's like what do you he said we need to talk about I said you know just give me a little bit of time to pray about it he's like okay yeah it's fair so I was maybe over the weekend praying or whatever or five days six days I don't remember anyhow I finally I thought yeah I'm gonna buy it I called him I said hey you still got that truck no he says I sold it now can I just talk like a man Josh could have talked like a man for a minute I was grumpy I was grumpy because I actually thought exactly what I wanted except it didn't have tan interior so I pouted like a typical man walked around and my lip on the ground and finally my wife looks at me and she goes what's your problem I'm like the truck she goes didn't you pray about that I said well of course I did you know grumpy me of course I did can't you take an answer power I'm like yes ma'am I'm sorry Lord not gonna tell you the rest a month later whatever it is I get a phone call from a brother says brother Dwayne he said you've been on my heart he says and I know you travel lots and I know some of the places you go to and I know your truck is getting tired this is not a pastor it's just an ordinary man says your truck is getting tired and I said oh it's all right brother I said it God's been good to us it still works just fine he said no he said um God put on my heart to buy you a vehicle I'm like oh no oh no you know what we can be pretty proud we can you know we can we're men we can do this ourselves you know we're not we're not Beggars I mean we I might be a preacher but I'm not a beggar you know I'm like oh no no no that's fine Brother no no he says God put on my heart to buy you a vehicle matters of fact if you drive into Prince Albert at the GM dealership you'll find it sitting on the lot right there I want you to go pick it up I'm like oh no no no no no no we're chatting he says well he says in case you might be wondering what it is it's a Suburban I said oh that's nice he said I really want you to stop and look at it I'm like no no brother my truck is good it's fine well later in the week we went to get groceries and guess what I mean it's right beside the highway it's hard not to so when you drive by you're like sure enough it was sitting there so I drove in to look at it what do you think it was a four-wheel drive Suburban what color was the interior tan leather it wasn't a fancy truck had low kilometers on it I told her I said well that is a nice truck I went home he called he said he said I bought that truck I said no thank you brother I appreciate it but no thank you you said brother Dwayne have you been to Prince Albert lately I'm like yeah he said did you stop and look at it at least I said yeah he said did you like it I said brother it's way more truck than I I can't even think about somebody buying me a truck I can't think about that he said I didn't ask you to think about it I just asked you to go pick it up those trucks would last one day they're so rare I left there for at least 10 days maybe two weeks and he would call me have you gone to pick up your truck have you gone to pick up your truck have you gone to pick up your truck what I'm saying is if you'll be faithful he promised to take care of our needs you say well brother Dwayne that wasn't neat I didn't need a truck like that but he knew the desire of my heart too I I I I'm okay to drive little old things I'm happy just driving I'm okay either way but he even wants to give you the desire of your heart I don't know why I'm on this but I'm going to close on this because I just think I should right now I'm so far free forgive me I'm so far away from my notes but I'm just going to commit it all to God and listen I I believe that the same spirit of God that's here this morning the same spirit of God that gave you life the same spirit of God that brought you here if he is not almighty God if he was if he's if the god that created the Earth and created every portion of this world and has for six thousand years kept everything in order it's not a great enough God to take care of your finances then why are you serving him he is he is of course you know I'm speaking like a pastor right now right I'm not supposed to be doing that but I am he cares he cares and all he wants you to just by faith I'm on the train anyhow so I'm just going to talk we've got a brother back home at church and for years I didn't know him he he used to Fellowship somewhere else I've known him all my life but I didn't know the kind of man he was and he used to Fellowship somewhere else he's a businessman and his pastor at the time had a men's meeting I don't maybe I'm stepping on toes this morning but Lord you know where we're at pastor had a men's meeting and he got talking about the importance of tithing and offerings he walked right up into the face of this man he said brother I bet you're the kind of man that never drops a dollar in the offering basket as it goes by his Pastor said that to him and I know this man so he would have been offended by that but this is his testimony not mine he said he was right brother Dwayne he said I have this opinion the church has lots they don't need mine you know his Pastor told him never moved he said I rather let me give you a little challenge he said no next time the basket gets you next time the basket goes around why don't you drop something in there he said before the end of the week God will probably restore to you ten times of course you have to know this brother he's a good German the basket came around kept his hands in his pockets next Sunday the basket goes around again kept his hands in his pockets about the third Sunday this little thought

Prosperity Gospel I'm talking about a God that cares listen when Hagar was at the well what was what was the well called a God that sees the Living God and he sees me he knows where you're at he knows what you have need of and this brother just happened to need a revelation of that and God was giving him one he goes and he throws it back in the bucket again another hundred dollars he said brother Dwayne before the end of the week he said the same thing happened he said I did it again the same thing happened he said I looked at my wife I said honey how much money do we need to live she said she rattled off the number he says he says at the beginning every month you write the check whether the money's there or not this is what we're going to pay for our tithing this is much we're paying for offering write the check he says brother Dwayne I've never thought about it since and God has blessed him and blessed him and blessed him and blessed him it was God giving him a revelation the very things that he'd thought about and wondered about and fought with and we all do this we've all got to grow through these things so that God can prove that I am I am Jehovah Jireh I am your provider I am your healer I am the one that's I am here to care for you I am listen this is my work you are my children and I'm going to see you all the way through it whether brother Dwayne ever gets to The Fountains of Living Waters or not I am the Fountain of Living Waters and if you need something drink and I'll fulfill your desire this is such a reality he said brother Dwayne after that I never ever thought about it he says I just write the check he says I just told my wife right we got a sister in our church let me I don't know why I'm on this this morning but I'm going to close this why don't you go take the piano so I do close I'll tell you what you guys just get to me talking and I don't want to get I don't something just it just keeps coming out rivers of Living Water livers of Living Water really that's what it boils down to church do you think God didn't give his church rivers of Living Water he literally said out of your belly will flow rivers of Living Water uh where is it from the Throne of God out of your belly will throw rivers of Living Water it's God doing the work and whether I'm on my notes or off my notes it just doesn't matter right now we've got a sister back at

she had breast cancer one day found out she was in four stage breast cancer now what Jonathan kind of kind of reminds me of your sister she was sitting back there in the audience music was playing she'd come to church anyhow doctors give her a death certificate fourth stage you got there's no hope sitting in the audience with her husband music begins to play song leader comes up he begins to lead the people to a place of worship and while the presence of God is there now this is not at home she was at a different church at the time while the presence of God is there the holy spirit says to her stand up worship me now she's a big lady so what would she think like I saw she becomes self-conscious everybody's going to see me Lord I don't want to make a spectacle a few minutes later the Holy Spirit come back and said stand up and worship me should big tumors hang him off the side she could feel him with her arms she sat there a little bit and the Holy Spirit said stand up she got up out of her seat and put both hands in the air just began to cry out to God just begin to worship Him she said brother Dwayne I felt something go from my head to my foot and in that moment I knew God healed me I knew God healed me should I sat down beside my husband and I put my arms down and the pain that would have been there was gone the tumors that were there were gone he said I looked at my husband I said they're gone God healed me obedience is better than sacrifice she got to a place in her life where finances got real real real tight touch you had four children and she's trying to raise him he said God I don't know how we're going to do this she got to thinking about you know if you give me my portion I'll open up the windows of heaven and I'll pour it a blessing you can't contain she looked at her bills and she began to tally him up she said Lord I'm making this right now but I need to make this to pay my bills so Lord I'm gonna pay you my tithing on what I need not

prayed for in that little Community one had a big goiter on her neck remember that the other one had an ulcerated stomach said there they were he said they come through the prayer line and God pronounced each one of them healed he says and they both walk back to their homes for the next three weeks or even more maybe it was even six weeks nothing happened that doesn't mean that he's not here that doesn't mean that he didn't hear nothing happened and then one day I said oh God the angel of the Lord because it was thus saith the Lord you're healed God would have to send an angel a Healing Ministry he would have to send it to their neighborhood to fulfill that word son there she is standing doing her dishes crying because I haven't been able to eat a good breakfast for years my
