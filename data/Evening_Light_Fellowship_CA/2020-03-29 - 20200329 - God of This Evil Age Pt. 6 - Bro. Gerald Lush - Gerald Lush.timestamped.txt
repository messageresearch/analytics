[46:35] the world doesn't have rest but the
[46:37] Bride of Christ has got the peace and
[46:39] rest of God amen thank God for that
[46:42] amen praise the Lord in Romans chapter 8
[46:46] and beginning to read at verse 14 for as
[46:53] many as are led by the Spirit of God
[46:56] they are the sons of God a man for ye
[47:02] have not received the spirit of bondage
[47:04] again to fear but you have received the
[47:07] spirit of adoption whoa praise the Lord
[47:11] whereby we cry Abba Father
[47:14] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[47:17] our spirit that we are the children of
[47:21] God oh I pray we got that confirmation
[47:24] Amen I pray we got that tokin a man of
[47:28] the anointing of the Holy Ghost in
[47:29] ourselves confirming that we are sons
[47:32] and daughters of God is a confirmation
[47:34] brother that we come from eternity into
[47:37] time and we're
[47:38] going back to eternity by the grace of
[47:40] God amen
[47:43] so again verse 16 the spirit itself
[47:46] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[47:49] are the children of God and if children
[47:52] then heirs and heirs of God and
[47:54] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[47:58] suffer with him that we may be also
[48:00] glorified together God bless his words
[48:04] you may be seated you can well imagine
[48:10] what its distress it is on the ministry
[48:13] to have to miss so many services a van
[48:17] so we miss as many sermons we miss
[48:19] that's as many sermons maybe I've got to
[48:21] preach today a man and it's going to be
[48:24] maybe a number of sermons but again it's
[48:27] on the same subject that we've been on
[48:28] and it's the god of this evil age and we
[48:32] could go on and on and on on it and I
[48:35] don't know again we're starting the
[48:36] scriptures that I want to read I don't
[48:38] know we're getting into the to finish
[48:40] the quotes on the message that the
[48:42] Prophet again preached in 1965 and again
[48:46] it is a revelation I feel that we really
[48:48] need as a revelation I feel that we
[48:51] really need to get understanding of amen
[48:53] so that we're not going to be deceived
[48:55] by the god of this evil age hey man so
[48:59] that we're going to be under the control
[49:00] and the influence and really God is an
[49:03] object of worship hey man it is an
[49:05] object of worship and so there is there
[49:08] is the god that's here for the right and
[49:10] there's a god that's here for the
[49:12] unbeliever there's a God this year
[49:14] trying to influence the world brother
[49:17] away from the world so we're praying the
[49:20] grace of God that were under the
[49:21] anointing of Elohim the self existing
[49:25] one amen not not the God of this evil
[49:28] age but the God of all creation the God
[49:30] of eternity a man the god of Redemption
[49:34] by the grace of God so brother and God
[49:36] is an object of worship and there are
[49:39] many as the prophet of God has art
[49:40] brought up we might do that quote again
[49:42] here in the message the god of this evil
[49:45] age and he said the devil is being
[49:47] worshipped he said by millions he said
[49:50] of billions yeah
[49:51] and he
[49:52] people don't realize they think they're
[49:54] worshiping Jehovah they think they're
[49:55] worshiping Elohim they think they're
[49:57] worshiping Jesus but they're worshipping
[49:59] the devil that's right that is the truth
[50:01] because why because he said he said I'm
[50:04] gonna do this I got as I try told you I
[50:06] preached on on the five I wills of the
[50:09] devil any man any near five I wheels
[50:12] there I believe in Ezekiel Isaiah and he
[50:14] said I will I will I will I will ascend
[50:17] above the most I a man and he would sit
[50:20] on the throne he said on this one that's
[50:22] on the thorn Oh brothers tremendous and
[50:24] the problem brings that out in the seven
[50:26] seals
[50:27] concerning the the the white horse rider
[50:30] then the red horse rider and then
[50:32] another horse rider and he said what is
[50:34] it he said it's the devil he said going
[50:36] from one phase to another one phase to
[50:39] another until he gets absolute control a
[50:42] man and again is there in the scriptures
[50:46] so I trust by the grace of God that were
[50:49] under the reign worship under the right
[50:50] anointing under the anointing of
[50:52] Almighty God and not the god of this
[50:55] evil age so the Lord be with us as we go
[50:58] into the scriptures and into the message
[51:00] and again concerning what's going on in
[51:05] the world that I allow me to say that I
[51:07] believe is for a purpose that God has
[51:10] allowed to allowed it God has permitted
[51:12] it a man for a purpose we say well this
[51:15] is the devil that's the devil but yet
[51:18] what did what the devil does God allows
[51:21] amen god is good god is good so he said
[51:24] so far shalt thou go and no further a
[51:26] man so we believe that what we're gonna
[51:29] so what's going on we know that God is
[51:31] permitting it and what what is God's
[51:34] reason for allowing this allowing these
[51:36] things to happen well is to bring out
[51:38] the spirit and the the attitude of the
[51:41] world a man but it's also to bring out
[51:44] the spirit and the attitude of the sons
[51:46] and daughters of God a man God God sees
[51:49] the world God sees what's going on over
[51:51] there God knows God knows that Amen
[51:54] because why because Satan is in control
[51:56] but God is looking for the actions and
[51:58] reactions of his sons and daughters the
[52:01] actions of the reactions of the seed of
[52:03] God by
[52:05] grace of God a man God knows that we're
[52:07] gonna stay with the word God knows we're
[52:10] not gonna cut off with what's going on
[52:12] in the world we're still gonna get
[52:13] caught up with the word a man a man the
[52:17] world is getting caught up with what's
[52:18] happening out there but we recognize
[52:21] that as scripture being fulfilled
[52:23] so we're caught up with the scriptures a
[52:25] man were caught up with a word and not
[52:27] not and we're not going to bypass the
[52:28] word and get a caught up with that when
[52:31] I'm going to bypass the word I love that
[52:33] to give us fear no no the fear of God
[52:36] keeps us in the word when we say fear is
[52:40] not to be afraid of God no no it's to
[52:43] respect God it's the honor God it's the
[52:46] reverence God that that's what it means
[52:47] to to have the fear of God amen others
[52:51] going to fear God over their wife
[52:53] because they're afraid of God a man
[52:55] brotherbrother I turned their sons and
[52:57] daughters were not afraid of him we
[52:58] appreciate him amen we love him as he
[53:01] loved us we love him so I pray God give
[53:04] us the right spirit and the right
[53:05] attitude and we'll keep the right spirit
[53:08] and keep the right attitude as we see
[53:10] more and more and more things happen out
[53:13] there in the world now we know according
[53:16] to the scriptures whether it's going to
[53:18] get worse according to the scriptures
[53:20] there's no me a lot of other things
[53:21] happen and not just in here just there
[53:23] some rascal me it's gonna be like it's
[53:25] like this virus is going to be around
[53:27] the world a man and concerning the virus
[53:30] again and I do believe that it's it's
[53:32] what the prophet of God referred to and
[53:35] I gave you that I gave you the quotes on
[53:37] it concerning the germ warfare and again
[53:41] he mentioned it in 1954 but he also
[53:44] mentioned again in 1960 yeah six years
[53:49] later he referred to the germ warfare
[53:52] and when again as you said what is
[53:56] cancer what is a disease and he said
[53:59] we'll deal on that in the next few
[54:00] minutes and he went on down and he said
[54:03] he said diseases are germs now he said
[54:05] listen listen he said he said did you
[54:09] know the Bible prediction but in the
[54:11] last days there be a germ warfare and
[54:14] the diseases will break out upon the
[54:16] people and will fall upon
[54:18] everyone without the baptism of the Holy
[54:21] Ghost amen the bachelors in what seals
[54:23] us in to the word a man and makes us one
[54:27] with the word whether we be Jew or
[54:29] Gentile Amen God's Word God's requiring
[54:33] obedience from us God's required
[54:35] obedience from Israel amen
[54:37] so brother I trust by the grace of God
[54:39] that the Lord he is recognizing in us
[54:43] what he said right here there what do we
[54:46] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he
[54:48] said but the germ warfare it will break
[54:50] out upon the people and will fall on
[54:53] everyone without the baptism of the Holy
[54:57] Spirit amen so I trust brother sister
[55:00] that we have the mention of the Holy
[55:01] Spirit and that's what keeps the devil
[55:03] away
[55:04] amen and was in 1960 that he referenced
[55:09] it again and he said how do we thank me
[55:13] that in this great hour that when all
[55:15] hopes of mortal life as finished a man
[55:19] he said atomic bombs he said are laying
[55:22] in Angers and he did say that Russia had
[55:25] won with it with it with the name of the
[55:27] United States on it and so on
[55:29] he said the nitrogen bombs he says
[55:31] sickness
[55:32] he's a diseases he said germ warfare
[55:36] again 90/60 and oh god he said
[55:40] everything the way it is knowing that
[55:41] the Bible said that man would actually
[55:44] rot in their flesh a man but we're going
[55:47] to experience the beginning but not the
[55:48] end amen
[55:50] so he said but the angel was given
[55:53] Commission don't touch any of those
[55:55] don't come near those who as the wine
[55:58] and oil a man don't touch those who has
[56:02] the seal of God upon their foreheads and
[56:06] he's referencing Ezekiel chapter 9
[56:08] concerning those that sigh and cry for
[56:11] the abominations that be done amen and
[56:14] he said the seal of God in their hearts
[56:17] and he said those who are wanting the
[56:19] seal of God kiss away every fear Lord
[56:22] seal them with the Holy Spirit in their
[56:24] hearts that they'll come forth as
[56:27] newborn
[56:28] maids a father he said granted Lord I
[56:31] committed to the in the name of Jesus
[56:34] and he did say again he said concerning
[56:37] he said don't touch any of those don't
[56:40] you come near those who has the wine and
[56:42] oil don't touch those who has the seal
[56:44] of God upon their foreheads and we
[56:47] realized that the batter of the Holy
[56:49] Ghost is the seal of God and grieve not
[56:52] the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are
[56:55] sealed unto the day of your Redemption a
[56:58] man so brother all those that are in
[57:01] context are experiencing and will

[57:08] so the devil can't break through that
[57:09] seal amen

[57:13] souls he can't break through it so let's

[1:02:17] going forward then it controls you it's
[1:02:18] a message amen you're reflecting the
[1:02:21] message of the hour you're reflecting

[1:02:25] why the world feels that your your your
[1:02:28] your fanatic oh yeah why because we
[1:02:31] because that is damn we're taking it's
[1:02:33] so different from the world so different

[1:02:40] their deeds amen we don't think the
[1:02:42] thoughts in their thinking hanging out
[1:02:44] there and well if we don't talk the way
[1:02:46] they talk over there
[1:02:47] amen because we're now our conversation
[1:02:50] is only goes to influence we may not be
[1:02:52] talking about the word itself but the
[1:02:55] word is reflecting itself in you and
[1:02:57] through you and it's the Holy Spirit if
[1:02:59] you're going to talk to somebody you're
[1:03:01] going to talk with the right spirit and
[1:03:02] a right
[1:03:03] attitude and it might end up talking
[1:03:05] about the word and it may not you may be
[1:03:07] talking about natural things but yet
[1:03:09] you're gonna be talking about it in a
[1:03:10] way that Jesus would talk about it
[1:03:12] amen hallelujah you're gonna have that
[1:03:15] anointing in your heart and your soul
[1:03:16] and it kind of control again and control
[1:03:19] your spirit and they control your the
[1:03:21] 5in instincts of your your flesh and
[1:03:25] remembering again that the instincts of
[1:03:27] your flesh is see what you're seeing
[1:03:30] you're gonna look at it through the eyes
[1:03:31] of God you're gonna see it the way Jesus
[1:03:34] sees it a man and again taste whatever
[1:03:40] it is you're going to taste and led the
[1:03:41] way that Jesus tasted a man let's let's
[1:03:44] get into the spiritual how does this
[1:03:46] taste a does that taste in your soul
[1:03:48] eggman brother we're gonna have the same
[1:03:52] sensitive taste as Jesus did or even he
[1:03:55] would know what was right and what was
[1:03:57] wrong a man come he said he eat of my
[1:04:00] flesh and drink of my blood
[1:04:01] Oh what are you tasting I pray we're not
[1:04:07] eating the devil Amen but we've eaten
[1:04:10] Jesus the revelation a man so the
[1:04:14] instincts of the flesh is see taste feel
[1:04:17] a lot of people go by their natural
[1:04:19] feelings but we got to be governed by a
[1:04:21] spiritual not the natural amen with the
[1:04:26] natural you'll cry with the spiritual
[1:04:28] you'll laugh yeah the National you'll
[1:04:31] cry with the spiritual you'll rejoice
[1:04:34] amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:04:37] oh my and again see taste feel smell and
[1:04:41] the fifth is to hear what are you
[1:04:43] hearing now you hear that as Jesus will
[1:04:46] hear it with that discernment a man
[1:04:50] without anointing praise the Lord God
[1:04:52] out of us that we're gonna hear it as
[1:04:54] God hears it we're gonna see it as God
[1:04:56] sees it and if you're in conversation
[1:04:58] with sometimes family friends or
[1:04:59] neighbors a man you're deserting a
[1:05:01] spirit a man and you're hearing all that
[1:05:03] they talk lead the world yeah whether
[1:05:06] they don't quite understand it see it's
[1:05:10] like but again we we if we got a right
[1:05:12] spirit we got to keep our spirit right
[1:05:14] there problem of God said or
[1:05:17] and I know there's a lot of believers
[1:05:19] and like I said I've had to preach it
[1:05:21] against that for over 50 years a lot of
[1:05:24] believers are just a bad message message
[1:05:26] message don't talk it go live it a man
[1:05:30] your life will have more influence in
[1:05:31] your words amen
[1:05:34] so brethren I've seen so much that they
[1:05:36] just want to talk about the doctor
[1:05:37] doctor doctor doctor as the truth and in
[1:05:41] their turn what they're doing is they're
[1:05:42] creating a wrong spirit in the people
[1:05:44] and that is the truth the prophet of God
[1:05:47] warned us against that and he said
[1:05:50] you're talking to somebody and he said
[1:05:52] you your tongue be the word and if you
[1:05:53] feel these two the resentment to it he
[1:05:55] said changed the conversation to go back
[1:05:57] talking about farming and after if
[1:05:59] they're selling cars go back talking
[1:06:00] about selling cars a man why you don't
[1:06:03] want God to condemn them no no you don't
[1:06:06] want to bring it you know what you don't
[1:06:07] want that to bring it that spirit in

[1:06:49] Holy Ghost amen
[1:06:51] though the enemy the enemy is there in
[1:06:54] your mind to control your these things
[1:06:56] of your flesh God is in the soul to
[1:06:58] control the instance of your spirit and

[1:08:11] end but we pray for those that are being
[1:08:14] influenced as brother Bob pray or the
[1:08:17] brother Joseph prayed praying for those

[1:08:23] germ warfare amen yes brother God is not
[1:08:27] willing that any should perish the Bible
[1:08:30] says that and yet there there are
[1:08:32] believers that couldn't care less

[1:10:06] judgment we know this is having no
[1:10:08] that's happening and because we have
[1:10:10] that revelation because we know what's

[1:10:14] out to somebody else amen
[1:10:17] by the grace of Almighty God amen
[1:10:20] consider Jesus on Calvary amen Father
[1:10:24] forgive them for they know not what they

[1:11:18] we'll go later on we'll go we'll go
[1:11:21] you're why because they're so caught up
[1:11:22] with the natural things of life they
[1:11:24] don't want to be interfered with that's
[1:11:27] the truth I've met a lot of so-called

[1:15:53] man and okay what you're in what you're
[1:15:55] doing
[1:15:56] let's be spiritual yeah and say like oh
[1:16:01] my I don't know about mentioned names

[1:16:08] politician and and I know you know it or
[1:16:10] not it was the father of our prime
[1:16:13] minister now it was it was a Trudeau and
[1:16:16] it was Pierre Pierre Elliott Trudeau a
[1:16:20] man and there they wanted to know
[1:16:22] whether you believe this he said listen
[1:16:23] I'm a Christian he saw I believe God hey
[1:16:28] man I said I I suppose Mays I was
[1:16:31] surprised so what yeah he was a
[1:16:33] Christian he said and he wouldn't

[1:16:51] and who didn't make it
[1:16:53] hey man oh that woman yeah they made it
[1:16:57] let's see what spirit they got see what
[1:17:01] attitude they got see what their actions
[1:17:04] are and their reactions and brother
[1:17:06] listen let's let it let it show that
[1:17:09] we're under the influence of Almighty
[1:17:11] God and not the devil and yet there are
[1:17:14] a lot of believers under the influence
[1:17:16] of the devil and they're worshiping the
[1:17:18] devil thinking they're worshiping God
[1:17:21] Road it's gonna be so close brother if
[1:17:24] it wasn't like that that close why would
[1:17:26] God permit it in the New Testament
[1:17:28] warning after warning after warning
[1:17:30] concerning being deceived amen and
[1:17:34] they'll show signs and wonders and
[1:17:36] they'll do this and they'll do that yeah
[1:17:38] he said make you believe this make you
[1:17:39] believe that you should be careful
[1:17:41] mister they're false prophets amen so
[1:17:45] let's make sure that our imagination
[1:17:47] conscience memory amen reason and
[1:17:53] affection is under the influence of the
[1:17:56] Holy Ghost in your soul the Holy Ghost
[1:17:59] with yourself why he would control your
[1:18:02] spirit and he would control a man your
[1:18:06] thoughts and the instincts of your flesh
[1:18:09] and the feelings of your flesh god help
[1:18:12] us brother he's my prayer didn't mean to
[1:18:14] get into this but again the grace of God
[1:18:17] okay man so let's pray that God is
[1:18:22] bringing out in us the Holy Ghost God is
[1:18:25] bringing out in yellow and he may more
[1:18:27] and more of the revelation of Christ
[1:18:29] amen
[1:18:30] and not by doctrine but by the life you
[1:18:33] live
[1:18:34] amen there's too many thing order to
[1:18:36] bringing out this doctrine this doctrine
[1:18:37] that day that's right but again it's got
[1:18:40] a cry seen you a man if not God will
[1:18:44] turn it away no matter how good you are
[1:18:45] and your doctor no worry I'll write you
[1:18:47] and your doctrine where's the life
[1:18:49] where's your spirit where's your
[1:18:50] attitude what about your actions you
[1:18:53] don't seem to everything on the inside
[1:18:55] again this time probably brought it in
[1:18:57] the seals not just say oh brother I
[1:18:59] believe the message no we should no live
[1:19:03] the message reflect the message amen
[1:19:08] not in word only but in your thoughts in
[1:19:11] your words and in your deeds by the
[1:19:13] grace of God amen praise the Lord and
[1:19:19] God is allowing what he is allowing to
[1:19:22] bring out the spirit of the unbeliever
[1:19:24] the mate believers and the believer
[1:19:27] again as under me remind you as that
[1:19:30] brothers a few years ago emailed me and
[1:19:34] said he said listen he said sir he said
[1:19:37] I read the Bible three times and he said
[1:19:39] I don't believe it
[1:19:40] he said what and he said because he said
[1:19:43] there are too many mistakes he's seen
[1:19:45] mistakes he was under the wrong
[1:19:48] anointing and so he said so he said sir
[1:19:51] he said I can't believe this I can't
[1:19:53] believe that and so because of all the
[1:19:56] mistakes of the Bible and that's why I
[1:19:58] explained to him that God rolled it in
[1:20:00] such a way you know always to is to do
[1:20:03] this do that do that I said remember
[1:20:05] it's for three different groups
[1:20:08] believers make believers and unbelievers
[1:20:11] I said he rolled it this way for the
[1:20:13] unbeliever and I say voted this way he
[1:20:16] allowed this to be pretty and now dead
[1:20:18] to happen what for
[1:20:19] make believers but I said the believers
[1:20:22] gonna believe it period so I said I said
[1:20:25] which one are you so I saw you a
[1:20:28] believer make believer or non-believer
[1:20:29] so as I said he'd never come back so I
[1:20:33] trust by the grace of God then he'll
[1:20:35] find himself a believer a man but again
[1:20:38] we're not willing that any should perish
[1:20:40] that's why we're praying and pleading
[1:20:42] the token for family friends and
[1:20:44] neighbors
[1:20:45] a man by the grace of God and also there
[1:20:50] was something that I wanted to express
[1:20:54] there was amazing that I was shocked
[1:20:59] when I brother Joseph mentioned in his
[1:21:01] prayer I said Lord what's going on what
[1:21:08] was the dimension but anybody know we do
[1:21:15] it would you be able to focus in on this
[1:21:18] one thing that our brother mentioned the
[1:21:21] significance of it the importance of it
[1:21:23] well brother Joseph mentioned his prayer
[1:21:29] brother Tim Pruett mentioned in a sermon
[1:21:31] Donnie Reigate mentioned in his sermon
[1:21:34] and then I heard brother Barry coffee
[1:21:36] mentioned in his sermon and then brother
[1:21:39] Chad lamb mentioned in his sermon then
[1:21:42] others mentioned it this will mention
[1:21:43] that one mission I said Lord I said this
[1:21:47] is amazing that at this hour and this
[1:21:49] time that they're all elated that it was
[1:21:56] Scripture and it was Psalms 91 and I
[1:22:03] received an email I think it was last
[1:22:06] week or a few days ago from brother
[1:22:08] Karsan
[1:22:08] and he said brother he said this is
[1:22:11] 9-1-1 he said for emergency they called
[1:22:16] 911 for our emergencies let's go to
[1:22:20] mountain 91 1 he says Psalms 91 verse 1
[1:22:24] Amen so I'm gonna ask you turn with me
[1:22:26] to Psalms 91 they may praise the Lord
[1:22:35] Psalms 91 this tremendous ISIL or
[1:22:42] discovery a reason somewhere that you're
[1:22:44] allowing the Brethren to bring this out
[1:22:46] a man why did our ministry and brethren
[1:22:51] I like this this reference a man and not
[1:22:56] only message believers message preachers
[1:22:58] but there's also other preachers that I
[1:23:00] heard they mentioned this they mentioned
[1:23:03] that so I said oh God I said where in
[1:23:08] this hour were in the end and I said
[1:23:11] you're bringing us all back to this
[1:23:12] scripture right here god help us and in
[1:23:18] Psalm 91 in verse 1 he that dwelleth in
[1:23:21] the secret place of the most I shall
[1:23:25] abide under the shadow of the Almighty
[1:23:28] amen our brother Donny Reagan was
[1:23:31] bringing it out highlighting even the
[1:23:34] first verse so brother you want to dial
[1:23:36] nine-one-one this is the one to die amen
[1:23:41] this this brings us deliverance this
[1:23:44] gives us rest and peace amen he that
[1:23:47] dwelleth you got to dwell
[1:23:50] Amen not go in and out but you got to
[1:23:53] live there he that dwelleth in the
[1:23:56] secret place of the most I shall abide
[1:24:00] under the shadow of the Almighty you

[1:24:08] presence

[1:24:36] shall cover thee with his feathers and
[1:24:38] under his wings shalt thou trust his
[1:24:43] truth shall be thy shield and buckler

[1:27:19] the message of the hour don't take
[1:27:21] anything out of context leave it the way

[1:27:29] than what it is don't make it smaller
[1:27:31] than what it is leave it he said the way
[1:27:32] that it is a man but many a believer
[1:27:36] many people - did he'll take this in the
[1:27:38] Bible there take that in the message and
[1:27:39] they'll make it bigger than what it is
[1:27:41] or smaller than one of these rather

[1:28:23] Angels praise the Lord
[1:28:25] well God is here but what would the
[1:28:27] angels are we conscious of the angels

[1:28:37] as a prophet said your siave about
[1:28:40] twelve feet from you at any given time
[1:28:45] that's right it's just our mistakes and
[1:28:48] wrong attitude wrong spirit whatever
[1:28:49] that'll cause him to move away but
[1:28:52] that's just a convict you and then when
[1:28:55] you repent so Lars forgive me and he
[1:28:57] comes back yeah it's like that brother
[1:29:01] that was preaching one time and brother
[1:29:04] branham was sitting on the platform
[1:29:06] behind it and when he was preaching that
[1:29:09] there were times and even he would turn
[1:29:11] around go back and shake brother baoshan
[1:29:13] and come back and preach again why he
[1:29:17] felt certain thing that the anointing
[1:29:18] was pulling away pulling away you go
[1:29:20] back shake the Prophet saying come
[1:29:22] preach oh yeah he did that a number of
[1:29:25] times yeah
[1:29:26] by the grace of God he was recognizing
[1:29:30] that there was a ninety now that man
[1:29:32] amen praise the Lord hallelujah he shall
[1:29:40] give his angels charge over thee to keep
[1:29:44] thee in all thy ways and they shall bear
[1:29:46] thee up in their hands lest thou dash
[1:29:49] thy foot against a stone god help us we
[1:29:53] need any more spiritual they were more
[1:29:56] spiritual with the more conscious of the
[1:29:58] spiritual things of God no no no wait
[1:30:02] till this happens and that happens then
[1:30:04] to drive us to the Lord no stay with the
[1:30:06] Lord you know I pray grace that you got
[1:30:10] the revelation of oneness in that day
[1:30:14] Jesus said you like you'll know though I
[1:30:15] mean the father the father me I in you
[1:30:17] and you and me what a oneness that is
[1:30:20] with God amazing what I pray grace that
[1:30:25] we are truly a man truly borned again so
[1:30:31] that's not me that lives this Christ
[1:30:32] that liveth in me but there's a lot of
[1:30:36] believers it's not Jesus in them
[1:30:41] you know no not Jesus they're just it's
[1:30:45] just a devil but it's a religious devil
[1:30:49] as the Prophet said the devil is
[1:30:51] religious yeah
[1:30:54] not necessary spiritual but he's
[1:30:56] religious yeah so brother I pray that
[1:30:59] our 19 is not the Satan's anointing but
[1:31:02] its gods of money it's the Holy Ghost
[1:31:04] anointing and men keeping what keeping
[1:31:07] our saw it's words indeed spiritual not
[1:31:10] religious wonderful
[1:31:14] thou should tread upon the lion and the
[1:31:16] adder the young lion and the dragon
[1:31:18] shall trample under feet grace because
[1:31:23] he s said his love upon me therefore
[1:31:25] will I deliver him and I will set him on
[1:31:28] high because he has known my name praise
[1:31:33] the Lord and he shall call upon me
[1:31:36] praise the Lord he had known my name but
[1:31:40] those that baptize in the name of the
[1:31:41] Father Son Holy Ghost they don't know
[1:31:43] the me he's amazing isn't it the same
[1:31:50] would influence them to do that and in
[1:31:52] the in the early church ages they did
[1:31:54] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:55] Christ because why they knew that was
[1:31:58] the name of the Father Son and Holy
[1:31:59] Ghost because this same Jesus has been
[1:32:02] made Lord and Christ
[1:32:04] a man so they knew that but yet Satan
[1:32:09] got in there and Satan whispered
[1:32:11] something oh yeah they threw his threw
[1:32:14] his false prophets on that they thought
[1:32:17] they were servants of God but they
[1:32:18] weren't and they changed it well just
[1:32:21] father son Holy Ghost and brother that's
[1:32:23] when they changed it in India trot
[1:32:25] around a year 300 AD that's when they
[1:32:29] say that's when they changed because
[1:32:33] that's when that deeds of the
[1:32:35] Nicolaitans and so on they became not
[1:32:38] just a doctrine it became a church that
[1:32:42] was the first denominational Church it
[1:32:44] was the Roman Catholic Church and their
[1:32:48] water baptism father son Holy Ghost
[1:32:51] Jesus was left behind as it were yeah
[1:32:55] the name oh yeah
[1:32:57] and they went onto the name that titles
[1:33:00] in the name of the church name of the

[1:36:03] Exodus 32
[1:36:09] Haizi
[1:36:14] Exodus chapter 32 I have to try to bring
[1:36:25] it to a conclusion and again I didn't
[1:36:29] intend to go this way when I come out I
[1:36:31] had it all planned do this do this do
[1:36:33] this but no I've got actually through it
[1:36:37] yet
[1:36:38] thank God amen so in Exodus chapter 32
[1:36:45] and let's begin to read at verse 15 and
[1:36:54] Moses turned and went down from the
[1:36:58] mount and the two tables of the
[1:37:01] testimony were in his hand the tables
[1:37:06] were written on their both sides both
[1:37:08] their sides on the one side and on the
[1:37:13] other were they written
[1:37:16] beginning and end no an Alpha and Omega
[1:37:20] and the tables were the work of God and
[1:37:24] the writing was the writing of God just
[1:37:27] think oh my believing that they open the
[1:37:31] seven seals was God a man not William
[1:37:37] Brennan and the writing was the writing
[1:37:40] of God graven upon the tables God help
[1:37:46] us pay attention to the word and when
[1:37:53] Joshua heard the noise of the people as
[1:37:55] they shouted he said unto Moses there is
[1:37:59] a noise of war in the camp and he said
[1:38:04] it is not the voice of them that shout
[1:38:07] for mastery
[1:38:08] neither is or the voice of them that cry
[1:38:10] for being overcome but the noise of them
[1:38:14] that sing do I hear okay was it right or
[1:38:20] wrong it was wrong and it came to pass
[1:38:26] as soon as he came nigh unto the camp
[1:38:29] that he saw the cat and the dancing and
[1:38:33] Moses anger waxed art you think oh well
[1:38:38] that sounds good they're shouting
[1:38:41] they're dancing they're singing no do
[1:38:45] you know he was right it wasn't Elohim
[1:38:51] they're under another anointing oh yeah
[1:38:56] just make sure his people get religious
[1:39:00] and then get over they sound good sound
[1:39:02] what this sounds good yeah make sure
[1:39:03] it's the right spirit make sure it's the
[1:39:06] right anointing but no Moses discerned
[1:39:09] there was something wrong and it came to
[1:39:14] pass as soon as he came nigh unto the
[1:39:16] camp they saw the calf and the dancing
[1:39:19] and Moses anger waxed lot and he cast
[1:39:23] the tables out of his hands and braked
[1:39:26] them beneath the mount the word
[1:39:29] just think it was the Word of God oh my
[1:39:34] but here's Moses that had received the
[1:39:37] Word of God on carved in those stones he
[1:39:39] took it and threw it down and smashed it
[1:39:41] and it broke out grace and he took the
[1:39:50] calf which they had made and burned it
[1:39:53] in the fire and ground it to powder and
[1:39:56] strawed it upon the water and made the
[1:39:58] children of israel drink the water
[1:40:03] yeah oh maybe they even want to do it
[1:40:06] but they had to you know because it was
[1:40:10] under the influence Joshua yeah Joshua
[1:40:14] or Aaron they influenced him what for to
[1:40:17] make a an image and he made the image he
[1:40:22] said this is the God that brought you
[1:40:23] out of Egypt
[1:40:25] no it wasn't he was he was with the
[1:40:29] Moses in the in the Mount Moses came
[1:40:32] down with his word yeah but they weren't
[1:40:37] in that spirit and that attitude to
[1:40:38] receive the word Moses smashed it yeah
[1:40:42] god help us and it says he took the calf
[1:40:48] and he burned it grind it to powder pour
[1:40:52] in the water made the term of Israel
[1:40:54] drink of it and Moses said unto Aaron
[1:40:56] what did this people unto thee that thou
[1:41:00] has brought so great as sin upon them
[1:41:04] yeah they're worshipping idols like
[1:41:09] those that worship brother Branham but
[1:41:12] the emphasis on brother Joseph oh yeah
[1:41:15] no no it's Jesus brother all that God
[1:41:20] did was to bring Jesus into the camp all
[1:41:24] that God did was to make Jesus give
[1:41:27] Jesus preeminence hey man
[1:41:30] why because he had come he has come down
[1:41:32] for his bride he came to redeem his
[1:41:34] bride now he's coming for his bride
[1:41:36] there's not with him Brendan not by any
[1:41:40] means and is not not brother Joseph
[1:41:43] all due respect god bless them a man no
[1:41:47] by any means brother God is looking for
[1:41:49] our worship amen
[1:41:54] Christ and he said and Aaron said let
[1:41:58] not the anger of my Lord wax art thou
[1:42:00] knowest the people they are set on
[1:42:03] mischief amazing they're born that way
[1:42:07] for they said unto me make us gods which
[1:42:12] shall go before us and as for as for
[1:42:15] this Moses the man that brought us up
[1:42:18] out of the land of Egypt we know not
[1:42:20] what has become of him and I said unto
[1:42:24] them whosoever have any gold let him
[1:42:27] break it off so they gave it me and then
[1:42:29] I cast it into the fire and there came
[1:42:31] out this calf amazing that Aaron would
[1:42:37] fall into that influence and again
[1:42:40] brother
[1:42:41] it wasn't they weren't serving the God
[1:42:43] of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of
[1:42:46] Jacob they're serving the devil they're
[1:42:50] worshipping the devil getting
[1:42:53] preeminence to the devil and when Moses
[1:42:59] saw that the people were naked for Aaron
[1:43:01] had made them naked on to their shame
[1:43:03] among their enemies and then Moses stood
[1:43:07] in the gate of the camp and said it was
[1:43:09] on the Lord's side let him come unto me
[1:43:12] and all the sons of Levi gathered
[1:43:16] themselves together unto Him and he said
[1:43:18] unto them thus saith the Lord God of
[1:43:20] Israel put and go in and out from gate
[1:43:23] to gate throughout the camp and slay
[1:43:25] every man his brother and every man his
[1:43:28] companion and every man his neighbor and
[1:43:30] the children and the Israel and the
[1:43:33] throne of Levi did according to the word
[1:43:35] of Moses and just think and there fell
[1:43:38] of the people that day about three
[1:43:40] thousand men yes and the same thing is
[1:43:47] happening now because there's many that
[1:43:50] are dying spiritually
[1:43:52] why because they make God's out of this
[1:43:55] and gods that have a doctrine gods that
[1:43:57] are out of them out of a man no god help
[1:44:00] us rather let's get the preeminence to
[1:44:03] Jesus a man and let's go to Exodus
[1:44:07] chapter 34 I'll have to bring it to a
[1:44:10] conclusion we've gone for about an hour
[1:44:19] Exodus 34 and beat this see
[1:44:38] verse eight and Moses made ace Bowser's
[1:44:46] head toward the earth and worshiped and
[1:44:49] he said if now I have found grace in thy
[1:44:52] sight O Lord let my lord I pray they go
[1:44:54] among us for it is a stiff-necked people
[1:44:56] and pardon our iniquity and our sin and
[1:45:00] take us for thine inheritance
[1:45:02] a man and the Moses at the second table
[1:45:05] of stones amen and he said behold I make
[1:45:13] a covenant before all thy people I will
[1:45:16] do marbles
[1:45:17] such as have not been done in all the
[1:45:19] earth nor in any nation and all the
[1:45:21] people among which thou art shall see
[1:45:24] the work of the Lord for it is a
[1:45:27] terrible thing that I will do with thee
[1:45:31] observe though that as which circum I
[1:45:34] command thee this day
[1:45:35] behold I Drive out before the the
[1:45:38] amorite the Canaanite the hittite the
[1:45:42] perizzite the hivite and the jebusite
[1:45:47] take heed to thyself lest I'll make a
[1:45:50] covenant with the inhabitants of the
[1:45:52] land whether thou goest let it be for a
[1:45:55] snare in the midst of thee rather we
[1:45:59] make no covenant with this whole world
[1:46:01] no we just do what we got to do in this
[1:46:04] world and we're moving on in the word
[1:46:06] and believing for the resurrection and
[1:46:08] rapture we're going out of this world as
[1:46:12] I said many just don't want to be don't
[1:46:14] want God to interfere with them Lord I
[1:46:16] got to do this I gotta do this I gotta
[1:46:18] do that know they're gonna be left here
[1:46:21] to do it but the bride's gonna go see
[1:46:25] Joshua Katie wasn't caught up with what
[1:46:27] was going on there in the wilderness
[1:46:29] they were still caught up with the
[1:46:31] revelation of the promised land and so
[1:46:35] you and I are caught up with the
[1:46:36] revelation of the promised land
[1:46:38] get out of here I don't want to stay oh
[1:46:41] I want to enjoy this I want to do this I
[1:46:43] want to no forget it but yet people are
[1:46:47] caught up with wanting to do the natural
[1:46:49] things of life they don't want anybody
[1:46:51] to interfere
[1:46:52] god help us and again verse 12 - he to
[1:47:01] thyself lest I make a covenant with I
[1:47:03] mean evidence of the land whither thou
[1:47:05] goest let it be for a snare in the midst
[1:47:08] of thee but ye shall destroy their
[1:47:10] altars break their images and cut down
[1:47:13] the growth by the grace of God amen
[1:47:17] you see not sure let's see for thou
[1:47:30] shalt worship no other God for the Lord
[1:47:33] whose name is jealous is a jealous God
[1:47:37] let's not make a covenant with the
[1:47:39] inhabitants of the land and they go
[1:47:41] whoring after their their gods and do
[1:47:44] sacrifice under their gods and one call

[1:49:01] reminder and he's speaking of the devil
[1:49:06] and the things that went on in a certain
[1:49:11] age he said how beautiful the scripture
[1:49:13] ties them together in every age and he
[1:49:16] said when the church he said would not
[1:49:18] have had to have the Word of God to rule
[1:49:20] over them they accepted a murderer
[1:49:22] Barabbas they didn't want Jesus they
[1:49:25] said give us Barabbas crucify Jesus oh
[1:49:29] my he said what did this do it exalted
[1:49:34] Satan the god of this evil age to a
[1:49:37] place that he always wanted he says now
[1:49:40] listen Satan is not spoke off as the god
[1:49:43] of any other age but this age he wasn't
[1:49:46] spoke of the God of Noah's age he's the
[1:49:50] God of the age of Moses - God of the age
[1:49:52] of Elijah but this evil age he said
[1:49:56] don't miss it
[1:49:57] he is the god of this evil age and
[1:49:59] worshiped oh my this is amazing he is
[1:50:06] worshipped by millions and billions of
[1:50:08] people and they don't know who are you
[1:50:13] worshiping make sure it's Jesus they met
[1:50:19] he said he's not called the God of any
[1:50:22] other age but this age it was his
[1:50:24] ambition to be like God from the very
[1:50:27] beginning
[1:50:28] Amen yeah he wanted to be exalted as God
[1:50:32] he is what he was working on and has
[1:50:35] been working on and now he's come to it
[1:50:36] and he is worshipped as God amen
[1:50:44] and he said he has not made the world a
[1:50:47] better to live in he has made the world
[1:50:50] better to sin in not living but to see
[1:50:55] because why he has legalized sin and he
[1:50:59] has everything is becoming legal now
