[51:47] [Music]
[52:08] father that's what we want to do tonight
[52:10] us have a response to your word have a
[52:13] response to the moving of your spirit
[52:15] Lord because father it's not good enough
[52:18] that your word goes forth it needs to
[52:21] find ground to receive it Lord and to
[52:24] bring forth father tonight we just asked
[52:27] and as your word goes forth that our
[52:28] hearts crys be it unto me Lord and Lord
[52:32] that we receive it lord whatever
[52:34] significance it has to the individual
[52:36] tonight lord I pray that your spirit
[52:39] would go to every life tonight Lord put
[52:41] your finger right on their lives Lord
[52:44] Jesus put your finger on my life Lord
[52:46] father if there's anything in us Lord
[52:48] that needs to change that Lord that
[52:51] needs to be put aside then father we
[52:53] just asked Lord and as uncomfortable as
[52:55] it may make us Lord as as much as we
[52:58] might squirm Lord when you do that but
[53:00] father it's so necessary and we just
[53:02] pray tonight Lord them whatever way that
[53:04] the word finds root in our lives may it
[53:07] be welcomed Lord and may we say be it
[53:10] unto me according to your word Lord
[53:12] father we just commit every part of the
[53:15] service into your hands and we just ask
[53:17] that you would come and speak Lord and
[53:19] you would have your perfect way though I
[53:21] let not a single bit of our flesh get in
[53:24] the way Lord but may we just be able to
[53:26] really give and freely receive tonight
[53:29] or we pray in Jesus
[53:33] and so the singing will do if we turn
[53:36] our Bibles to Exodus chapter 20 take a
[53:40] little subject on idol worship tonight
[53:45] hopefully nobody had any actual graven
[53:49] images that they said a little prayer to
[53:54] on before they set out this evening that
[53:57] would be a little strange we would say
[53:58] that would be pretty weird you know
[54:00] there's a lot of people that call itself
[54:02] Christians that do have those kinds of
[54:04] things but but I trust when we look at
[54:06] the Word of God tonight we find that
[54:08] it's more than having you know a little
[54:10] wooden Idol a little stone Idol that we
[54:13] pray to that but we can have idols of
[54:16] many different things and in the world
[54:19] that we live in is just giving you every
[54:22] opportunity to have an idol you know you
[54:25] don't have to work very hard to have one
[54:26] they'll you know the world will furnish
[54:28] you with any kind of ATO you're willing
[54:29] to accept and you know the devil doesn't
[54:32] care what it looks like you know what
[54:34] what that object of your attention is as
[54:37] long as it's not on God so we want to
[54:40] make sure that we don't have any of
[54:41] those things in our lives tonight and by
[54:44] God's grace recognize what it takes to
[54:46] to please him Exodus chapter 20 and
[54:49] verse 1 it says and God speak all these
[54:54] words saying I am THE LORD thy God which
[54:59] have brought thee out of the land of
[55:01] Egypt out of the house of bondage thou
[55:04] shall have no other gods before me thou
[55:07] shalt not make unto thee any graven
[55:08] image or any likeness of anything that
[55:11] is in heaven above or that is in the
[55:14] earth beneath or that is in the water
[55:15] under the earth thou shalt not bow down
[55:18] thyself to them nor serve them for I the
[55:21] LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting
[55:23] the iniquity of the father's upon the
[55:25] children unto the third and fourth
[55:27] generation of them that hate me and
[55:30] showing mercy unto thousands of them
[55:34] that love me and keep my Commandments
[55:37] you may be seated
[55:39] it's a real honor and privilege to be
[55:41] with you again tonight may the Lord
[55:44] bless you really nice time with the
[55:46] brothers have fishing this morning to
[55:50] reel in the first Cod that I have ever
[55:54] had so that's seeing God in that in a
[55:57] different form a creation just it was a
[56:02] real nice time and then we got nice and
[56:03] wet so that was real nice as well
[56:05] good to be refreshed you know salt water
[56:09] treatment was just great so just really
[56:14] enjoy the fellowship that we had today
[56:17] you know this scripture of course is is
[56:19] the first part of the ten commandments
[56:21] that Moses delivered to the children of
[56:22] Israel very familiar to us and and you
[56:27] know we should should be aware of them
[56:29] and and understand them and right here
[56:31] in the second verse God shows us that
[56:34] he's exercising his right over his
[56:36] chosen people and he tells them he's the
[56:39] one that delivered them from bondage
[56:41] he's the one that brought them out of
[56:42] Egypt he's their Lord and their God and
[56:45] all the following Commandments and laws
[56:48] is how he wants to be worshipped you
[56:51] know in the world that we live this is
[56:52] probably the hardest part to accept of
[56:55] all God's Word is that God is our Lord
[56:59] you know that so many people enjoy
[57:03] having God as you know a part of their
[57:06] life of God as you know a satisfying
[57:09] part of them a comfort to them strength
[57:12] to them you know encouragement in all of
[57:15] those things but most people don't
[57:17] really want to put themselves in a place
[57:19] where God is their Lord because if if
[57:22] they're under that lordship then you
[57:24] know their duty their lives is to give
[57:27] honor and praise to that lordship you
[57:30] know and so to really make God our Lord
[57:33] is is more than just to sing worship and
[57:36] praise you know sometimes people think
[57:38] that you know their their great
[57:40] responsibility to God is raising their
[57:42] hands in church while they're singing or
[57:44] you know is is you know giving God
[57:46] credit for the things in their lives but
[57:48] true lordship is that you never really
[57:51] your your service to the Lord doesn't
[57:54] end when you walk out the door on Sunday
[57:56] morning you know it doesn't end you know
[57:58] when when you
[58:00] finish your prayer before your food it
[58:02] doesn't doesn't end you know when you
[58:03] stake a little bit of time for devotion
[58:05] that the service to the Lord is all the
[58:07] time because he's our Lord all the time
[58:09] you know and so that's God's right
[58:12] because he's created all things he's
[58:15] made all things I took a service at home
[58:16] God's rights you know so often we talk
[58:18] about people's rights but God has rights
[58:21] and he has rights because he made
[58:23] everything without God the scripture
[58:25] tells us that he made everything that
[58:27] was made was made by him and so you know
[58:29] he has the right to say how he wants
[58:32] that creation to work you know and if
[58:34] you were an author and you sat down and
[58:36] wrote a book you know it's up to you as
[58:38] the author to decide what happens to the
[58:40] character you could you could kill off
[58:43] you know someone that the reader loves
[58:44] you know you can kill off you know your
[58:46] favorite character just why did you do
[58:49] that how he's just not variable doesn't
[58:51] matter I'm the author I could choose to
[58:52] do whatever I wanted those characters
[58:54] cuz I created them you know and and you
[58:57] know people get all offended sometimes
[58:59] you know what an author does this or
[59:01] does that and you know in a different
[59:02] thing but it's there right as the
[59:04] creator of that to say what happens to
[59:07] it you know and and you know if you were
[59:09] do you know make a movie or something
[59:12] like that you would have the right to do
[59:13] whatever you want with it you know
[59:14] people might not like it people might
[59:16] not pay to go see it but you'd have a
[59:18] right to make it however you want
[59:19] because you're the creator well God God
[59:22] has that same right
[59:23] you know he's created everything that
[59:26] was made and so he has the right to say
[59:27] how it should run he has the right to
[59:29] tell us how we should live he has the
[59:31] right to tell us how he wants to be
[59:32] worshipped he has the right to do all of
[59:35] those things and if we recognize that
[59:37] then we realize it's only it's only a
[59:40] small thing to actually give our lives
[59:43] back to him because he's given it all to
[59:45] us you know that but that's the hardest
[59:48] thing for people to accept you know they
[59:50] don't mind having God as a guiding light
[59:52] they don't mind having God as you know
[59:54] someone that will strengthen them
[59:55] encourage them but to be able to put
[59:57] their themselves in subjection to the
[1:00:00] Word of God is the hardest thing for
[1:00:02] people to do you know because people
[1:00:06] don't want to surrender control in their
[1:00:08] lives and people are people believe
[1:00:10] erroneously that that they have control
[1:00:13] over their
[1:00:13] you know people believe that well if I
[1:00:16] do you know the things that I you know I
[1:00:18] want to do I will accomplish my goal but
[1:00:20] you realize that you really don't have
[1:00:22] any control over that because you don't
[1:00:24] have any control over if you get sick
[1:00:26] you don't have any control over what
[1:00:28] happens to you when you walk out the
[1:00:29] door tonight and what's happening to
[1:00:31] everybody else on the road you don't you
[1:00:33] don't know any of those things and you
[1:00:34] don't have control over any of them and
[1:00:36] if God would remove his hand a blessing
[1:00:38] on up of our lives and allow the devil
[1:00:41] to have his way you know our life could
[1:00:43] end right this moment the breath that
[1:00:46] you just took could be your last breath
[1:00:47] if God would if God would permit that to
[1:00:50] be the case and so when we recognize
[1:00:52] that and we realize okay my idea of
[1:00:56] control my idea of having my way doesn't
[1:01:00] really exist you know there is no such
[1:01:03] thing as having your way you know really
[1:01:06] you say well no I do I can choose to
[1:01:07] live my life the way I want yeah you can
[1:01:10] choose to live your life one of two ways
[1:01:14] either serving God or following the
[1:01:16] influence of the devil because we know
[1:01:18] there's only really two powers in the
[1:01:20] world God's power and the devil's power
[1:01:22] so to refuse to subject ourselves to God
[1:01:25] isn't choosing our own way
[1:01:27] it's actually choosing to follow and
[1:01:29] subject ourselves to the devil's Kingdom
[1:01:31] instead you know when you think about it
[1:01:34] that way oh that's really the choice I'm
[1:01:36] making yeah that's really the choice
[1:01:37] we're making when we say you know what
[1:01:39] I'm not willing to follow that part of
[1:01:41] the Word of God and what we're really
[1:01:42] doing is embracing the devil's Kingdom
[1:01:48] you know it's really just another way of
[1:01:50] saying I want it my way is to really
[1:01:52] just say you know we're going to
[1:01:54] continue to live in our fallen sinful
[1:01:56] condition and refuse to subject
[1:01:58] ourselves to God it you know it's it's
[1:02:00] incredible how many companies tap into
[1:02:02] that desire to control your own life you
[1:02:05] know
[1:02:05] you know the Burger King have it your
[1:02:08] way you know just you know people appeal
[1:02:10] to that and it's so exciting to think
[1:02:11] that I can have it my way you know my
[1:02:13] life you know what the air whatever I
[1:02:15] want to make in my life I can have that
[1:02:17] you know because it sounds powerful and
[1:02:19] sounds very self satisfying but really
[1:02:22] we can't have it our way you know there
[1:02:24] there's powers beyond our control and in
[1:02:26] one way or the other
[1:02:27] gonna serve something so if you if you
[1:02:30] have it that choice you know and you
[1:02:33] recognize all that God's done giving us
[1:02:35] life and and the blessings he's given us
[1:02:37] and the position opportunity that we
[1:02:38] have and all of those things would you
[1:02:40] choose would you choose to subject
[1:02:42] yourself to the Lord or would you choose
[1:02:43] to accept yourself through the devil
[1:02:45] who's brought all the sickness and sin
[1:02:47] and strife and all of these things into
[1:02:49] our lives no I know where I'm gonna put
[1:02:51] my confidence and my services to the
[1:02:54] Lord Jesus Christ amen so you know what
[1:02:57] when we when we think of that you know
[1:03:00] the Lord our God must be lord over our
[1:03:02] lives he must have the final authority
[1:03:04] his word must be the last word in all
[1:03:07] parts of our lives and you know to me
[1:03:09] it's easier to understand an atheist who
[1:03:12] doesn't believe in God
[1:03:13] you know rejecting parts of the word or
[1:03:16] all of the word and living a life
[1:03:17] according to their own will because at
[1:03:20] least they're being true to their
[1:03:21] confession they're saying you know I
[1:03:22] don't believe in God I don't believe
[1:03:24] there's a god that exists and so I'm
[1:03:26] just gonna live my life however I see
[1:03:27] fit
[1:03:27] because I'm not acknowledging that
[1:03:29] there's anything else that I should
[1:03:30] submit you there's that there's anything
[1:03:32] else any other reason to do differently
[1:03:34] but you know what's hard to understand
[1:03:37] is people who call themselves Christians
[1:03:39] but don't follow the Word of God because
[1:03:42] a Christian who doesn't follow the Word
[1:03:44] of God is saying I believe in God and I
[1:03:46] believe that this is his word and I
[1:03:48] believe that the things in there are
[1:03:49] true but I'm still not going to subject
[1:03:51] myself to it you know that's the part
[1:03:53] that's hard to understand because surely
[1:03:55] they realize the consequences in it and
[1:03:57] the effect of doing that you know people
[1:03:59] have decided you know what part of the
[1:04:01] scripture they'll live by and which part
[1:04:02] they won't that's the part that's hard
[1:04:04] to understand because they know it's a
[1:04:07] book of two laws you know the book of
[1:04:09] Deuteronomy book of two laws to accept
[1:04:11] it was life and blessing and and grace
[1:04:13] and to reject it was judgment and it was
[1:04:15] a curse and so you know if we recognize
[1:04:18] that that's still true today to accept
[1:04:20] God's provided way brings life eternal
[1:04:22] life and to those that reject it it
[1:04:24] brings death it brings a curse today the
[1:04:27] same as always you know and so you know
[1:04:30] when people say that but they won't let
[1:04:32] god be lord over their lives all it is
[1:04:35] is just a self-deception it's just you
[1:04:37] know thinking that you know they're
[1:04:39] doing something that
[1:04:40] pleases God at the same time God looks
[1:04:42] at their lives and is very displeased
[1:04:44] with it you know that that's a deception
[1:04:46] indeed and and I trust that we would
[1:04:48] look at our lives tonight and not not be
[1:04:50] deceived and not be foolhardy enough to
[1:04:52] think that God will just ignore the
[1:04:56] parts of our lives that you know we
[1:04:58] don't feel like subjecting to you but
[1:05:01] God won't do that he sees everything in
[1:05:02] our lives and he's aware of those things
[1:05:04] so you know what what we see what Israel
[1:05:07] here is that God gives these
[1:05:09] Commandments to Israel through Moses and
[1:05:11] the first part of it there is
[1:05:12] establishing the rights and order of his
[1:05:15] kingdom you know we have free will to
[1:05:17] choose but in order to keep his
[1:05:18] Commandments and to please him and to
[1:05:20] receive His mercy we need to follow
[1:05:22] those Commandments and Jesus said if you
[1:05:24] love me you'll keep my Commandments you
[1:05:27] say oh I love Jesus I love Jesus but I
[1:05:29] don't really want to do that well it
[1:05:31] shows us how much we would love the Lord
[1:05:34] you know and I I thought of this you
[1:05:36] know idea that you know many times the
[1:05:38] things that we love of God are the
[1:05:39] things that God does for us you know we
[1:05:41] love to feel encouraged we love to feel
[1:05:43] blessed we love to experience all of the
[1:05:45] great things that God's done for us and
[1:05:47] so we what we really love is the stuff
[1:05:49] we don't necessarily love God we love
[1:05:51] the stuff that God does for us you know
[1:05:54] and if you think about your life you
[1:05:55] know and you think about is my
[1:05:56] experience a true love for the Lord is
[1:05:58] that a true love for the blessings of
[1:06:00] the Lord I believe when we think about
[1:06:02] it if there was no blessing if you
[1:06:04] didn't come to church and you know and
[1:06:06] receive just encouragement strength you
[1:06:08] know if you didn't feel the presence of
[1:06:10] the Lord you know if you if you went out
[1:06:12] and you were cursed with sickness and
[1:06:14] and despair and you know financial ruin
[1:06:16] and and you know bitterness and all
[1:06:19] those things could you still love God
[1:06:22] because God would still have the same
[1:06:24] right to your love that God would still
[1:06:27] have the same right to your worship but
[1:06:29] would you still be willing to give it
[1:06:31] that that's what shows us do we really
[1:06:34] love God or do we just love what God's
[1:06:37] done for us
[1:06:38] you know because brother Brown says if
[1:06:41] he sent me to hell I'll still love and
[1:06:45] that's an incredible thing because what
[1:06:46] you realize then is that you just love
[1:06:48] the Creator so much that if if he's made
[1:06:52] you a vessel of dishonor then you say
[1:06:54] lord
[1:06:54] that's what I want I want to be pleasing
[1:06:56] to you and you know I try to still bring
[1:06:59] you honor but you know if you send me to
[1:07:01] hell at the end of that then then you're
[1:07:03] the righteous judge now I won't curse
[1:07:05] your name I won't you know I won't you
[1:07:08] know call you unfair unjust I'll just
[1:07:10] accept it and say Lord if that's what
[1:07:12] you want then I'm willing to do that you
[1:07:14] know if you have a heart like that it
[1:07:16] shows there's no way you could be a
[1:07:17] vessel of dishonor because a life that's
[1:07:19] so willing to love even though it's not
[1:07:22] based on what you receive that shows us
[1:07:25] that it's a real hearts cry it's a real
[1:07:27] attribute of God calling back to the
[1:07:30] Father
[1:07:30] no deep responding to the deep as we say
[1:07:33] you know if you if you look at the
[1:07:38] commandments that God gave to the
[1:07:41] children of Israel there's a lot of them
[1:07:43] if you start flipping through you know
[1:07:45] 10 commandments is just the short form
[1:07:47] you start looking through Exodus and
[1:07:51] Leviticus and numbers in Deuteronomy
[1:07:53] there's just so many things that the
[1:07:55] children of Israel had to keep and and
[1:07:57] you know hundreds of different
[1:07:58] Commandments hundreds of different rules
[1:08:00] and regulations and and you know I'm
[1:08:03] sure that as they started to you know as
[1:08:07] Moses would continue to lay out the word
[1:08:08] okay this is the way this is going to
[1:08:10] work just the way sacrifice is going to
[1:08:11] work this is the way you know marriage
[1:08:13] is gonna work this is a way that they
[1:08:15] must be like wow this is gonna be really
[1:08:17] hard to follow there's so many things I
[1:08:19] got to be careful of so many things I
[1:08:21] got to offer sacrifices for so many
[1:08:22] things you know I've got to do to earn
[1:08:24] God's favor and you know no doubt as
[1:08:27] Christians sometimes we feel the same
[1:08:28] way you know young people growing up
[1:08:30] especially might think like oh man
[1:08:31] there's so many rules mom and dad won't
[1:08:32] let me do this they won't let me do that
[1:08:34] you know I'm I have to do you know I
[1:08:36] have to keep this way I have to wear
[1:08:37] these clothes I have to you know I'm not
[1:08:39] allowed to go here I'm not allowed to go
[1:08:40] there and it can seem like a lot of
[1:08:42] rules and regulations but Jesus actually
[1:08:44] gives us you know one major shortcut for
[1:08:47] keeping the laws of God and and it says
[1:08:49] in Matthew 22 verse 37 it says jesus
[1:08:53] said unto Him thou shalt love the Lord
[1:08:56] thy God with all thy heart with all thy
[1:08:58] soul and with all thy mind this is the
[1:09:02] first and Great Commandment how do we
[1:09:04] serve God in a way that pleases him
[1:09:06] simply allow him to be
[1:09:08] Lord of all your life and in everything
[1:09:11] you do put him first you know the ten
[1:09:14] commandments and all the commandments
[1:09:15] really are extensions of this one
[1:09:18] principle and also the second principle
[1:09:20] which Jesus said second is like unto it
[1:09:22] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:09:24] on these two Commandments hang all the
[1:09:27] law and the prophets you know so if you
[1:09:30] could say what does it take to please
[1:09:32] the Lord it takes two things love the
[1:09:34] Lord with all your heart and soul in
[1:09:36] mind and love your neighbor as yourself
[1:09:39] no that's the simple form of what it
[1:09:41] takes to please the Lord that's what
[1:09:42] what God's asked us to do is simply just
[1:09:45] those two things
[1:09:46] you take the Ten Commandments and you
[1:09:47] divide them up and into those two
[1:09:49] categories you find that those two
[1:09:50] things satisfy all of the commandments
[1:09:52] you know if you look at you know the
[1:09:54] first five Commandments and you find you
[1:09:56] know doesn't have no other gods before
[1:09:57] me no graven images you know all of
[1:10:00] those things
[1:10:00] remember the Sabbath and all of those
[1:10:04] are a reflection of that first
[1:10:06] commandment which is love the Lord God
[1:10:08] with all your heart and soul in mind you
[1:10:09] know if you do those things you'll have
[1:10:11] no other gods before it if you do those
[1:10:13] things you you know you won't have you
[1:10:16] know you won't have any graven images
[1:10:17] you won't have anything that gets first
[1:10:18] place over the Lord you know he'll he'll
[1:10:21] be the one that's your light and your
[1:10:22] and your salvation all the time because
[1:10:25] you put them first with all your heart
[1:10:27] and soul in mind you know then you turn
[1:10:29] and you look at all the other
[1:10:31] commandments you know
[1:10:32] do not kill don't steal don't commit
[1:10:34] adultery don't bear false witness all of
[1:10:36] those things well if you keep that
[1:10:37] second part that you love your neighbor
[1:10:39] as yourself well you won't do any of
[1:10:41] those things you know we don't like to
[1:10:43] experience those things happening to us
[1:10:45] and so we wouldn't do them you know to
[1:10:47] others we wouldn't we wouldn't steal we
[1:10:50] wouldn't kill we wouldn't lie we
[1:10:52] wouldn't you know covet we wouldn't do
[1:10:53] any of those things because what would
[1:10:55] be most important to us is that we love
[1:10:57] others the same way we would love
[1:10:59] ourselves so really that's the shortcut
[1:11:01] to all of those things is just simply to
[1:11:05] follow these two Commandments so it's
[1:11:08] easy right if there's only two
[1:11:09] Commandments it should be so simple to
[1:11:11] keep them except that Israel could never
[1:11:15] keep them they can never keep them
[1:11:18] there's only there's really only two
[1:11:19] things that they had to be mindful of
[1:11:21] all at all time
[1:11:22] and they could never do it you know and
[1:11:24] the truth is today we could never do it
[1:11:27] in our strength in our ability
[1:11:30] you know if even if every day we just
[1:11:31] ran every single thought through the
[1:11:33] same two Commandments said am I really
[1:11:36] am I doing that am i doing that am i
[1:11:37] doing that we wouldn't be able to do it
[1:11:39] because we have a fallen nature that's
[1:11:41] suffered you know there's a way about us
[1:11:43] no matter how much we try to be
[1:11:44] unselfish we're still selfish in our own
[1:11:46] selfishness and I think service at home
[1:11:49] and I called it unselfish selfishness
[1:11:50] you know is that you know no matter what
[1:11:52] we do even when we're being good to
[1:11:54] other people a lot of times they're
[1:11:55] still selfishness in that it makes us
[1:11:57] feel good you know we get a sense of
[1:11:59] gratification out of it with you know it
[1:12:01] makes us feel like oh we're doing right
[1:12:02] you know we're we're pleasing God and
[1:12:04] the benefit that we get out of that is
[1:12:05] what motivates us to do something for
[1:12:07] others a lot of times but because no
[1:12:09] matter what we're selfish people you
[1:12:11] know and that's the that's the fallen
[1:12:13] condition of man is really to be selfish
[1:12:16] you know in everything that we do and so
[1:12:18] we find that in order to ever have a
[1:12:21] chance of keeping these two Commandments
[1:12:24] there really has to be a nature change
[1:12:25] in us and you know we probably get tired
[1:12:28] at times especially if you haven't had a
[1:12:30] new birth of hearing that you need a new
[1:12:32] birth because you know it just sounds
[1:12:34] like won't you get off of that same
[1:12:35] topic it's just over and over again new
[1:12:38] birth new birth new birth but Jesus said
[1:12:40] unless you are born again you can't even
[1:12:42] see the kingdom of God so you know as
[1:12:45] much as you would want to have any you
[1:12:47] know Oh tell me something else okay you
[1:12:48] know get off of this new birth or there
[1:12:50] can we move on from the Holy Spirit no
[1:12:52] we never can because that's the thing
[1:12:54] that actually gives us the ability to
[1:12:56] keep these Commandments that God's given
[1:12:58] us you know without that without a
[1:13:00] without a new birth experience without a
[1:13:02] nature change without God's own life in
[1:13:04] us he's the only one that can keep his
[1:13:06] word and so the only chance we have of
[1:13:08] keeping his word is if our own lives are
[1:13:10] living his life so you know as much as
[1:13:13] as much as we make the gospel
[1:13:16] complicated with rules and things like
[1:13:18] that the real thing is get to God you
[1:13:20] know getting to Christ and when you get
[1:13:22] into Christ either
[1:13:24] you know the brother branham lays out
[1:13:26] for us that how our lives match the you
[1:13:29] know three courts or the three different
[1:13:30] places in the temple or tabernacle you
[1:13:33] know and we would say once we have the
[1:13:35] holy go
[1:13:36] that you know as brother tells us we
[1:13:37] have full access to the holiest of
[1:13:39] Holies at all times but we still have a
[1:13:41] choice to live in the outer court you
[1:13:44] know we still have a choice to not enter
[1:13:46] into that presence you know even once
[1:13:48] you have the Holy Ghost people think
[1:13:49] that oh you know there will never be
[1:13:50] another challenge and never be another
[1:13:51] difficult because I got the Holy Ghost
[1:13:53] now but you still have a choice to live
[1:13:55] in your flesh you still have a choice to
[1:13:57] live by your own thinking you know to
[1:13:59] just kind of put aside God's leadership
[1:14:02] and still have your own way and so as we
[1:14:04] said before you don't really have your
[1:14:05] own way so you know we have a choice
[1:14:08] still to push God away and follow the
[1:14:09] way of the world or follow the influence
[1:14:12] of evil so we want to make sure that our
[1:14:14] lives not only are born again but that
[1:14:17] we recognize hey I'm born again that
[1:14:19] still means I've got to enter in
[1:14:21] I've still got to subject myself daily
[1:14:23] in order that you know I might still
[1:14:25] find the will of God you know we look at
[1:14:28] Jesus life and brother BAM tells us in
[1:14:30] some places didn't have to pray like we
[1:14:31] have to pray because he wasn't you know
[1:14:34] asking for repentance he wasn't you know
[1:14:36] it wasn't his sin that was getting in
[1:14:37] the way of his contact with God but yet
[1:14:39] we find so many places in the scripture
[1:14:41] where it says that jesus prayed so he
[1:14:45] didn't need to pray the way we have to
[1:14:47] pray cuz he was sinless but at the same
[1:14:48] time he prayed all the time he prayed
[1:14:51] all the time because he wanted to make
[1:14:52] sure that his will and God's will were
[1:14:55] completely lined up you know that that
[1:14:57] he wasn't doing anything without the
[1:14:59] leadership of the Lord and so you know
[1:15:00] sometimes when we get spiritually you
[1:15:02] know we've progressed in the Lord we
[1:15:03] think that okay well that means now that
[1:15:05] I'm just you know super power and off I
[1:15:07] go doing things however I want because
[1:15:09] God will bless it God will leave me but
[1:15:10] no it takes a subjection of our will all
[1:15:13] the time so that God's will can be
[1:15:16] brought forth so when we look at Israel
[1:15:19] you know we think about them keeping
[1:15:22] these Commandments you know it's
[1:15:24] shocking to me the things that is real
[1:15:27] struggled with when you think about all
[1:15:29] that God did for them you know it's
[1:15:32] shocking because you know what what do
[1:15:34] people say when they have trouble
[1:15:35] serving the Lord as well well if only
[1:15:37] God was more real in my life if only you
[1:15:39] know only God would show me and speak to
[1:15:41] me you know give me some sign then I
[1:15:43] would know us from the Lord
[1:15:44] well Israel is the living proof of that
[1:15:46] that when God gives them supernatural
[1:15:48] signs old
[1:15:49] they still can't line up with it so the
[1:15:52] problem isn't that we don't have enough
[1:15:53] supernatural leadership the problem is
[1:15:55] that we can't subject ourselves to that
[1:15:57] leadership and so you know we look at
[1:15:59] Israel and if you start to think really
[1:16:01] about what what God did for them and all
[1:16:04] the things that he brought them through
[1:16:06] there should never have been a doubt in
[1:16:07] their minds that God would continue to
[1:16:09] lead them you think about the mighty
[1:16:11] supernatural things that happened while
[1:16:13] they were in Egypt and you know even
[1:16:15] before that you look at the life of
[1:16:16] Abraham and you look at the life of you
[1:16:18] know of him when God called him out and
[1:16:20] all of those things you know we see that
[1:16:22] in their lives Abraham had come from a
[1:16:26] life of idol worship Abraham had had
[1:16:29] come from a place where that was his
[1:16:30] family history you know they were Idol
[1:16:32] worshipers and and so Abraham was raised
[1:16:35] with graven images that he would pray to
[1:16:37] and in all of those things but when God
[1:16:39] speaks to Abraham it changes him and and
[1:16:43] there's a response that takes place he's
[1:16:44] heard from God directly you know we'd
[1:16:46] say oh wouldn't we all love to hear from
[1:16:48] God directly what do we all love to hear
[1:16:50] you know an audible voice or you know
[1:16:51] how have a physical manifestation of God
[1:16:53] right before you in your room you know
[1:16:55] you're trying to decide what do I need
[1:16:56] to do today what where do I look for a
[1:16:58] job where do I move toward it you know
[1:16:59] what church should I go to you know in
[1:17:01] God's right there in the flesh standing
[1:17:02] before you telling you where to go or
[1:17:03] what to do you know we'd be really
[1:17:05] excited about that and that's what
[1:17:08] happened to Abraham you know is that he
[1:17:10] came to this you know he heard the voice
[1:17:13] of God directly and it told him to go
[1:17:14] into the land that was separated from
[1:17:16] his family separated from his upbringing
[1:17:18] and all of those things and and Abraham
[1:17:20] does that he has a direct relationship
[1:17:21] with God you know a friend of God even
[1:17:23] the scripture calls him and so we see
[1:17:26] Abraham put aside the idols he put aside
[1:17:28] those things and we never find again
[1:17:30] that Israel's worshipping idols up until
[1:17:35] the time they come out of Egypt you know
[1:17:37] you can look through the scripture and
[1:17:38] it never says that Abraham goes to pray
[1:17:41] to his graven image it doesn't say that
[1:17:43] you know that Isaac had graven images it
[1:17:46] doesn't say that Jacob had them you know
[1:17:48] the only time that you really find idols
[1:17:50] from that time is that you find them
[1:17:52] when when Rachel took Laban idols when
[1:17:55] they left Layton's house and they they
[1:17:57] went back to Canaan you find that Rachel
[1:18:00] took all of laymen's idols but
[1:18:02] doesn't really tell us what her
[1:18:03] intention was in doing that and we never
[1:18:05] find anywhere that that they worship
[1:18:08] them or you know counted on them or any
[1:18:10] of those things so really from the time
[1:18:12] that God called Abraham until the time
[1:18:15] that Moses comes on the scene
[1:18:17] Israel's never been a group of
[1:18:19] idol-worshipping people they've always
[1:18:21] put their trust in Jehovah they've
[1:18:24] always had a special relationship and I
[1:18:26] remember seeing the Abraham movie years
[1:18:29] ago and you know God's calling Abraham
[1:18:32] and Abraham goes and he's meeting these
[1:18:34] different people in different lands you
[1:18:36] know and they're like oh you know let's
[1:18:37] you know let's go worship and he's like
[1:18:39] oh I can worship right here I just let
[1:18:40] me build a an altar to my god and
[1:18:42] they're there so stumbled by the idea
[1:18:44] that he doesn't need an image to direct
[1:18:47] his attention to he just you know serves
[1:18:49] the the one true God that reigns over
[1:18:52] his life and and so that's they that's
[1:18:54] the type of worship that Israel has you
[1:18:57] know they've never had a graven image
[1:18:58] they've never had an idol that they've
[1:19:00] directed their attention to and no doubt
[1:19:03] they've seen a lot of people worshipping
[1:19:06] idols in those years you know they've
[1:19:08] seen the way that the different Canaan
[1:19:10] Canaanite tribes would worship and they
[1:19:12] all had idols they they saw when they
[1:19:14] went to Egypt that the Egyptians had
[1:19:16] idols and you know temples to this God
[1:19:18] and Pharaoh himself is God and all of
[1:19:20] these different things that they had
[1:19:22] before them they had the opportunity to
[1:19:24] adopt idol worship but the scripture
[1:19:25] never tells us that they were
[1:19:27] worshipping idols
[1:19:29] yeah we're just worshiping Jehovah you
[1:19:31] know when they got into trouble they
[1:19:32] cried out for Jehovah you know it didn't
[1:19:34] cry out for bail or any of those other
[1:19:36] types of God but they were worshiping
[1:19:38] God they were worshiping God without an
[1:19:40] image so when you think about that and
[1:19:43] then you think about all of the things
[1:19:45] that that invisible God was able to do
[1:19:48] for them that no Idol had ever done you
[1:19:51] know no Idol that Egypt had ever done
[1:19:52] the mighty works that their God had done
[1:19:54] no no Idol of any other country had ever
[1:19:57] done the works that their God had done
[1:19:58] and they just see supernatural sign
[1:20:01] after supernatural sign bringing them
[1:20:02] out of Egypt and you know through the
[1:20:04] Red Sea no Idol had ever done that
[1:20:06] you know manna in the wilderness no no
[1:20:08] Idol had ever done that water from The
[1:20:10] Rock know i doäôt ever done that it's
[1:20:12] just super natural after supernatural
[1:20:14] for supernatural and they come to Mount
[1:20:16] Sinai
[1:20:16] and God wants to speak to them directly
[1:20:19] and he gives them an opportunity to hear
[1:20:22] from from him directly and so he they
[1:20:25] come to this place and and of course
[1:20:27] they prepare themselves and sanctify
[1:20:28] themselves and get ready and all of
[1:20:30] those things and you would think here
[1:20:32] that all this is going to be a real
[1:20:33] turning point for his rayul
[1:20:35] this is going to be an incredible thing
[1:20:37] that as a whole nation they're going to
[1:20:38] be ruled directly by God and it is a
[1:20:40] turning point for them but it's in the
[1:20:42] wrong direction you know because when
[1:20:45] they come to Mount Sinai and God's voice
[1:20:47] speaks out to them and makes them afraid
[1:20:49] makes them fearful and instead of
[1:20:52] subjecting themselves to that in fear
[1:20:55] and humility they said let let God speak
[1:20:57] through Moses instead and what they
[1:21:00] actually did is turn down God's direct
[1:21:02] leadership and put it on to somebody
[1:21:04] else and when they did that Israel
[1:21:09] became an utter worshiping country right
[1:21:11] after that you know I still had Jehovah
[1:21:13] but they were always turning to idols
[1:21:15] when they turned down that direct walk
[1:21:17] with God you know and that that's a
[1:21:19] warning to us as Christians because God
[1:21:22] once again wants to have a direct
[1:21:24] relationship with us but when we push
[1:21:26] that off onto somebody else it causes us
[1:21:29] to make substitute it causes us to
[1:21:32] substitute other things in God's place
[1:21:34] and the people who should be you know
[1:21:35] constantly in a connection at a direct
[1:21:38] relationship with God can become an auto
[1:21:40] worshiping people you know right at this
[1:21:43] time when they when they turn down God
[1:21:45] speaking directly to them
[1:21:46] of course God says okay Moses will speak
[1:21:49] for you and that'll be the pattern that
[1:21:51] I use to speak to my people from here on
[1:21:53] in and you know so they go on that way
[1:21:56] and and of course God gives them the Ten
[1:21:59] Commandments right on that time as well
[1:22:01] so they've heard don't make any graven
[1:22:03] images well that should be the easiest
[1:22:04] that should be the absolute easiest
[1:22:06] commandment for them to follow because
[1:22:08] they have no history for hundreds of
[1:22:11] years they've lived and they've never
[1:22:12] made any idols they've you know that
[1:22:14] should be the simplest thing for them to
[1:22:16] keep because it's it's not part of their
[1:22:19] culture it's not part of their life
[1:22:20] they've never depended on it it never
[1:22:22] depended on it when they were in Egypt
[1:22:24] you know in bondage they weren't turned
[1:22:26] into idols then but you know so this
[1:22:28] should be the simplest commandment that
[1:22:29] should be
[1:22:30] what's the next one what's what's the
[1:22:32] hard one you know that's an easy one but
[1:22:34] we find that the very first commandment
[1:22:36] that they broke was they made a graven
[1:22:39] image the very first commandment they
[1:22:42] broke this should have been the easiest
[1:22:44] one to keep and it was the first one
[1:22:46] that they broke you know and so it's a
[1:22:48] warning to us as Christians if we push
[1:22:52] off God and we we accept a secondhand
[1:22:55] experience with God whether that
[1:22:58] person's your spouse pastor preacher
[1:23:00] parent respected person whatever it is
[1:23:03] you know will will cause us to create
[1:23:06] substitutions in our lives that will
[1:23:08] actually put us outside of God's will
[1:23:10] will actually put us in a condition
[1:23:12] where we're we're idol worshipers before
[1:23:15] the Lord you know as soon as we stop
[1:23:17] experiencing Christ first hand and
[1:23:18] settle for someone else's experience
[1:23:20] we're finding a physical substitute for
[1:23:23] God you know Israel had such a mighty
[1:23:26] display of God's power and might but the
[1:23:30] first commandment broken like I said was
[1:23:31] to adopt an idol you know we find that
[1:23:33] in exodus 32 it says and when the people
[1:23:35] saw that Moses delayed to come down
[1:23:37] under the mount the people gathered
[1:23:39] themselves together unto Aaron and said
[1:23:40] unto Him up
[1:23:42] make us gods which shall go before us
[1:23:44] for us for this Moses the man that
[1:23:46] brought us up out of the land of Egypt
[1:23:48] we want not what has become of him and
[1:23:50] Aaron said unto them break off the
[1:23:52] golden earrings which are in the ears of
[1:23:53] your wives of your sons of your
[1:23:55] daughter's spirits never die again and
[1:23:57] bring them unto me and all the people
[1:24:00] break off the golden earrings which were
[1:24:02] in their ears and brought them unto
[1:24:03] Aaron and he received them at their hand
[1:24:05] and fashioned it with a graving tool
[1:24:07] after he had made it a molten calf and
[1:24:09] they said these be thy God's o Israel
[1:24:13] which brought thee up out of the land of
[1:24:16] Egypt what a slap in God's face you know
[1:24:20] a God that had done things that no Idol
[1:24:23] had ever done you know no Idol could
[1:24:25] ever have done and in the very first
[1:24:28] opportunity of they had have to reject
[1:24:30] him they put a calf in this place it's
[1:24:33] it's not even made in anything in the
[1:24:35] image of anything godly it's you know in
[1:24:37] the image of a calf you know of a dummy
[1:24:40] animal is what they made it in and so
[1:24:43] you know at least maybe
[1:24:43] they could have fashioned it in the
[1:24:45] shape of a pillar of fire would have
[1:24:46] sounded more spiritual or shaping in a
[1:24:49] cloud or shaping in you know something
[1:24:51] that represented you know something
[1:24:52] great and mighty a shape it as a star as
[1:24:54] a planet or what something but they
[1:24:56] shape it as a cow you know something
[1:24:58] that it's just so lowly and they say
[1:25:01] these be your gods Israel it this is
[1:25:04] where to put your confidence this is
[1:25:05] where to put your focus you know it's
[1:25:07] almost astonishing to the natural mind
[1:25:10] how they could how they could change so
[1:25:12] abruptly I believe to the spiritual mind
[1:25:15] we catch it because to have rejected
[1:25:17] that direct relationship with God and
[1:25:19] chosen a man to stand in the place of
[1:25:22] God their trust was on the physical
[1:25:24] their trust had been put on the physical
[1:25:27] thing and no longer could they simply
[1:25:29] walk by faith and you know we actually
[1:25:31] see that all the way to the time of
[1:25:32] jesus jesus' as a man he's constantly
[1:25:35] disappointed by the lack of faith in
[1:25:37] Israel every time he sees it he says you
[1:25:40] know do you still not understand you
[1:25:42] still not trust you you know show us the
[1:25:44] Palio suffice it would you know you've
[1:25:46] seen me you've seen the father he he's
[1:25:48] trying to direct their attention you
[1:25:50] know you you've got you should have
[1:25:51] faith don't you know believe if you
[1:25:53] can't believe me believe the works you
[1:25:54] know how faith in it but no they're
[1:25:56] always looking for something else look
[1:25:59] give me a little more give me a little
[1:26:01] more and yet you know a Gentile comes in
[1:26:04] you know who's got a sick servant at
[1:26:07] home and he says just speak the word she
[1:26:09] said I can come to your house and lay
[1:26:10] hands oh no no I don't either just speak
[1:26:13] the word you know why because he could
[1:26:16] accept God by faith and the Jews
[1:26:18] required something physical because they
[1:26:21] had pushed the side that walk by faith
[1:26:24] that pattern continues to repeat itself
[1:26:26] over and over again throughout the
[1:26:28] scripture Israel always chose a physical
[1:26:30] representation over a true relationship
[1:26:33] with God you know we're seeing that
[1:26:34] right now all throughout the world the
[1:26:36] world rejects God continually but
[1:26:39] doesn't go on without idols the world
[1:26:41] raises up idols all the time because
[1:26:43] there's something in us to worship the
[1:26:46] brother man tells us that there's
[1:26:47] something in human beings to worship and
[1:26:48] we will worship something with our lives
[1:26:51] and so we see that and the world doesn't
[1:26:53] even doesn't even play it coy or you
[1:26:55] know try to be deceitful about it they
[1:26:57] say no
[1:26:57] let's let's make a new TV show it's
[1:26:59] called American Idol we're gonna tell
[1:27:02] you right now that we're putting up
[1:27:04] idols before you and you know you're not
[1:27:06] going to be alarmed by this you're not
[1:27:08] gonna be bothered by this you're gonna
[1:27:09] tune in by the millions to watch it
[1:27:11] instead you know we're gonna call these
[1:27:14] sports stars idols and you're gonna say
[1:27:16] oh awesome let me buy his jersey and let
[1:27:19] me let me get a tickets and let me you
[1:27:20] know get an autograph card and let me do
[1:27:23] all these things you know and they're
[1:27:24] telling you we're making idols so in
[1:27:27] case you're wondering we're sewing idols
[1:27:28] over here you know you know we're gonna
[1:27:30] raise up some Hollywood stars we're
[1:27:32] gonna raise up some sports stars we're
[1:27:33] gonna raise up this before we do I will
[1:27:35] wave and I don't anybody you know I
[1:27:36] don't okay there's I got one for you
[1:27:38] what kind would you like what kind would
[1:27:42] you like you know you you want to auto a
[1:27:43] beauty oh well here's some great
[1:27:44] examples for you I've got a full catalog
[1:27:46] of selection uh oh you idolize
[1:27:48] strengthen and and concrete oh my I've
[1:27:51] got such idols over here you know
[1:27:52] whatever type of Auto you want the
[1:27:54] world's gonna display and they're not
[1:27:56] afraid to say that you know they're
[1:27:59] blaspheming but they don't even realize
[1:28:01] it doesn't even bother they're you know
[1:28:03] at home one of the most grieving things
[1:28:05] that I heard was we you know of course
[1:28:07] the winners just got the you know touted
[1:28:10] draft pick in the NFL Draft and and I
[1:28:15] saw a little interview with a guy who
[1:28:17] had brought his child to watch a
[1:28:19] practice or something about it and you
[1:28:22] know he said he said he had been calling
[1:28:23] him Conor makgeoli like that than most
[1:28:33] Christians would talk about their faith
[1:28:34] but why because he was proud he was
[1:28:38] proud to have an idol he was proud to
[1:28:40] you know to to worship fully in and
[1:28:44] completely and put all of his confidence
[1:28:46] in that you know but completely
[1:28:48] completely anti daughter you know and
[1:28:51] yet so many people are doing the same
[1:28:53] thing but you know maybe they're not as
[1:28:54] blatant in their in their worship but
[1:28:56] but they've put a substitute in that's
[1:28:59] their life that's their leadership you
[1:29:01] know that's that's what people are doing
[1:29:02] constantly with the clothes they wear
[1:29:05] and the haircut that they have and and
[1:29:06] all of these things is patterning
[1:29:08] themselves after idols that the world
[1:29:10] gives them
[1:29:11] substitutes for the for the lure you
[1:29:17] know so Israel the very first thing they
[1:29:19] do is turn to idol worship
[1:29:21] you know Paul brings that out in in the
[1:29:23] book of Romans and he says wherefore God
[1:29:26] gave them up to uncleanness through
[1:29:30] their lust through the lusts of their
[1:29:32] own hearts to dishonour their own bodies
[1:29:34] between themselves who changed the truth
[1:29:37] of God into a lie and worshipped and
[1:29:40] served the creature more than the
[1:29:43] Creator who is blessed forever so that's
[1:29:46] really the problem is that God set out a
[1:29:48] pattern in the very beginning that he's
[1:29:50] to be the Lord he's to be the one you
[1:29:52] know true object of our worship and yet
[1:29:56] any other gods before him breaks that
[1:29:59] commandment it breaks that type in our
[1:30:00] lives and it causes those substitutes to
[1:30:04] come forth in abundance
[1:30:05] now causes those things to come forth in
[1:30:07] abundance and anything else other than
[1:30:09] God is worshiping the creature the
[1:30:11] creation more than the Creator you know
[1:30:16] the scripture tells us that that the
[1:30:18] creation could never have more glory
[1:30:21] than the Creator because the creation is
[1:30:24] a product of the creator you know
[1:30:27] there's nothing you know the greatest
[1:30:28] human being is still absolutely pitiful
[1:30:30] compared to God you know the the
[1:30:32] greatest accomplishment man is still the
[1:30:34] you know the most minor and
[1:30:35] insignificant detail compared to God but
[1:30:38] that's not how it gets lifted up in this
[1:30:40] world you know so idol worship is a
[1:30:43] symptom of people that have refused to
[1:30:45] move on with God or refuse to accept
[1:30:47] God's will in their life we refuse to
[1:30:50] respond to the call of God you will
[1:30:52] worship something you know and I would
[1:30:55] say check your experience and check your
[1:30:57] life and I pray the Holy Spirit just
[1:30:58] speak to each one of us individually
[1:31:00] tonight that you know what really is the
[1:31:02] most important thing to you in your life
[1:31:05] right now is it family friends career
[1:31:11] education money popularity all of these
[1:31:17] things is that you know selfish nation
[1:31:19] what's the most important thing to you
[1:31:21] in your life because if it's anything
[1:31:24] than the Lord Jesus Christ there's an
[1:31:28] idol there might just be a little Idol
[1:31:30] but it's Dillon Otto might be a great
[1:31:31] big Idol but it's an idol and so we want
[1:31:34] to put those things await and I
[1:31:35] recognize them and put them away
[1:31:39] you know when Israel would sin by
[1:31:42] grumbling and complaining the Lord would
[1:31:43] send trouble their way as a way to judge
[1:31:46] their sin but also to try to bring them
[1:31:49] back to recognizing where their focus
[1:31:50] should be and one example that we find
[1:31:53] is when the Lord sends a fiery serpents
[1:31:55] among the people verse 6 of chapter 21
[1:31:58] of numbers it says and the Lord sent
[1:32:00] fiery serpents among the people and they
[1:32:02] bit the people and much people of Israel
[1:32:04] died therefore the people came to Moses
[1:32:06] and said we have sinned for we have
[1:32:07] spoken against the Lord and against thee
[1:32:09] pray unto the Lord that he take away the
[1:32:11] Serpent's from us and Moses prayed for
[1:32:13] the people and the Lord said unto Moses
[1:32:15] make the a fiery Serpent and set it up
[1:32:17] on a pole and it shall come to pass that
[1:32:19] every one that is bitten when he looketh
[1:32:21] upon it shall live and Moses made a
[1:32:24] serpent of brass and put it upon a pole
[1:32:26] and it came to pass that if a serpent
[1:32:28] had bitten any man when he beheld the
[1:32:30] serpent of breath he lived you know
[1:32:34] that's extraordinary that in the time
[1:32:36] that Israel is in a condition where they
[1:32:39] need God God actually gives them an
[1:32:41] image to look to it seems kind of
[1:32:45] strange in a way but God recognizes that
[1:32:48] Israel has placed their trust in the
[1:32:50] physical God realizes that Israel won't
[1:32:54] simply take him out his word he has to
[1:32:56] give them something tangible something
[1:32:58] physical to put their trust in and so he
[1:33:01] gives Moses a commandment to make this
[1:33:02] snake out of brass and of course brother
[1:33:04] Brown shows us that it symbolizes their
[1:33:06] sin judged and forgiven and if they'll
[1:33:09] look on the brass serpent they'll live
[1:33:10] look and live you know and God the
[1:33:13] incredible thing about God to me is that
[1:33:15] God will reach out to meet you at your
[1:33:17] level of faith he certainly doesn't need
[1:33:21] to he's already given his word he's
[1:33:23] already promised all of the things that
[1:33:25] we have nita but yet God will reach out
[1:33:27] to us at our level of faith you know of
[1:33:30] course the highest form of faith is
[1:33:31] simply to take God at His Word and
[1:33:33] receive his promises without anything up
[1:33:36] God said he's a healer
[1:33:38] further Browne I was listening to
[1:33:39] messages recently and brother branham
[1:33:42] says you know if you want a God to heal
[1:33:45] you he couldn't even do it right now
[1:33:46] because he's already done it he's he's
[1:33:49] already done it to the point where if
[1:33:51] you were to ask him right now he can't
[1:33:52] do anything more for you than what he's
[1:33:54] already done
[1:33:55] he's already healed you he's already
[1:33:57] saved you is already giving you need of
[1:33:59] everything that you have giving you
[1:34:01] everything you have need a brother and
[1:34:02] so you know there is nothing more that
[1:34:04] God needs to equip you with he's already
[1:34:06] done it but we still can't receive that
[1:34:09] simply by the word that's given a lot of
[1:34:11] time and so God reaches out to us to try
[1:34:14] to meet us at our level of faith you
[1:34:16] know and that's brother branham's
[1:34:18] ministry was like that first pole was
[1:34:20] there to help people have something
[1:34:22] tangible that would raise the level of
[1:34:24] their faith where they would you know
[1:34:25] reach out it and he would grab their
[1:34:27] hand and they would see that you know
[1:34:29] their disease reflected in the pattern
[1:34:31] of the bumps on his hand why it gave
[1:34:33] them something tangible to look at and
[1:34:35] when you know when he had prayed and
[1:34:37] when the disease was done they might not
[1:34:38] have felt it in their bodies but they
[1:34:39] looked at that hand and if it was fine
[1:34:41] if it wasn't if it was whole and if it
[1:34:43] was normal they had something to put
[1:34:45] their trust in that you know that God
[1:34:47] had healed them of their disease and so
[1:34:48] you know God reaches out to lift up
[1:34:51] people's level of faith by giving them
[1:34:53] something physical to depend upon but
[1:34:56] that's not the highest form of faith the
[1:34:57] highest form of faith is simply to take
[1:34:59] honor his work he said he healed me so
[1:35:01] god I'm accepting that healing for
[1:35:03] myself right now and I'm claiming it in
[1:35:05] Jesus name and then I'm just gonna keep
[1:35:06] walking and and whenever it takes place
[1:35:09] in me then it's gonna take place in me
[1:35:11] because your word says it's true well we
[1:35:12] have that kind of confidence we have
[1:35:14] that kind of faith that's the highest
[1:35:15] level of faith but God still reaches out
[1:35:20] to help us get to that level by boosting
[1:35:22] our faith giving us faith boosters but
[1:35:24] notice God gives Israel that so that
[1:35:28] they have a way of of being saved from
[1:35:30] these this condition of the serpent but
[1:35:33] they take that that very same image of
[1:35:38] deliverance and they turn it into an
[1:35:40] idol you know God's giving it to them to
[1:35:43] help their faith be lifted up to receive
[1:35:46] his word but they turn even that image
[1:35:49] of his word of his you know it's an
[1:35:51] image that God
[1:35:52] himself provided and they turn and they
[1:35:54] actually make that into an auto and the
[1:35:55] Bible is very clear on that second Kings
[1:35:57] chapter 18 it says now came to pass in
[1:35:59] the third year of Hoshea a son of Allah
[1:36:01] king of Israel that Hezekiah the son of
[1:36:03] Ahaz king of Judah began to reign twenty
[1:36:05] and five years old was he when he began
[1:36:07] to reign and he reigned twenty and nine
[1:36:08] years in Jerusalem his you know his
[1:36:10] mother's name it talks about he says and
[1:36:12] he did that which was right in in the
[1:36:14] side of the Lord according to all that
[1:36:15] David his father did he removed the high
[1:36:17] places and break the images and cut down
[1:36:19] the groves it's all wonderful things and
[1:36:21] break in pieces the brazen serpent that
[1:36:24] Moses had made for unto those days the
[1:36:29] children of Israel did burn incense to
[1:36:31] it think about this this is this is a
[1:36:35] couple hundred years after maybe three
[1:36:37] or four hundred years after God had
[1:36:40] given this image that was for a very
[1:36:43] specific time and a very specific
[1:36:45] circumstance that God gave them
[1:36:48] deliverance but they took that they took
[1:36:50] that image and they just kept on
[1:36:52] worshiping it there was no fiery
[1:36:55] serpents biting them anymore there was
[1:36:57] no there was no need of it any more but
[1:36:59] they just kept it as a tradition you
[1:37:01] know and so you know every time you know
[1:37:03] maybe they're coming to church or coming
[1:37:05] and coming to the synagogue or temple or
[1:37:07] and and you know they would have
[1:37:08] something they take a little time to you
[1:37:10] know offer some incense to the brass
[1:37:12] serpent and you know take a little time
[1:37:14] say a little prayer to the brass serpent
[1:37:15] then no it's just mind-boggling that
[1:37:18] they would do that but they took
[1:37:19] something that God provided to give them
[1:37:21] deliverance and turn that into an idol
[1:37:24] so amazing thing that you could take
[1:37:25] what God's giving you and make an idol
[1:37:27] of it that would take your attention off
[1:37:28] God but that's exactly what they did
[1:37:31] Satan loves to take the sacred things
[1:37:34] that God's given to help his people
[1:37:36] and turn those thing into into a weapon
[1:37:38] against God's elect
[1:37:39] you know the brass serpent gate was
[1:37:42] given by God to raise their faith and
[1:37:44] instead it became an idol that was an
[1:37:46] obstacle to their free you know bring
[1:37:49] that into the New Testament
[1:37:50] and we find the same pattern over and
[1:37:52] over again the same problem with
[1:37:53] humanity God gives gifts to raise the
[1:37:55] faith of his people and people turn
[1:37:57] those gifts into idols brother Branham
[1:38:00] says in the message in portable sin he
[1:38:02] said and you all get the baptism of the
[1:38:04] Holy Spirit
[1:38:05] let's be one big happy family then don't
[1:38:07] come in saying well I got the Holy Ghost
[1:38:09] glory to god I'm gonna have gifts now
[1:38:11] just let the gifts alone they'll take
[1:38:14] care of their self see God when he's
[1:38:16] when he sees he wants to use you for
[1:38:18] something he'll tell you what to do and
[1:38:19] go do it
[1:38:20] don't seek gifts seek the giver come in
[1:38:24] and receive the Holy Spirit
[1:38:25] you know bo brown points to the same
[1:38:27] kind of auto worship God gives many
[1:38:29] gifts to the church for the edifying of
[1:38:32] the body of Christ no but people see the
[1:38:35] gifts and it catches their attention and
[1:38:37] they what they start craving is the gift
[1:38:40] well if that person can speak in tongues
[1:38:42] can I speak in tongues you know it was
[1:38:44] given as a gift to edify the body not
[1:38:46] given us something to distract us from
[1:38:49] serving the Lord you know when we saw
[1:38:52] the way that tongues were operating and
[1:38:54] brother Browns time or even prophecies
[1:38:55] we were operating in brother branham's
[1:38:56] time you know it became to such a place
[1:38:58] it was just a distraction from the
[1:39:00] service you know God would come forth
[1:39:02] and speak to them you know and then
[1:39:03] somebody would get up and you know all
[1:39:04] the attention would turn to them you
[1:39:06] know to confirm what brother Brown was
[1:39:08] saying you know brother I didn't need
[1:39:10] any confirmation that what he was saying
[1:39:12] was true but they got so focused on the
[1:39:14] gifts that even when the word of God is
[1:39:16] coming directly to them even when you
[1:39:19] know it's being sought it's being full
[1:39:20] with discernment it's being followed
[1:39:21] with you know obvious demonstration you
[1:39:23] know healings and things taking place
[1:39:25] somebody still has to get up and tell
[1:39:28] them but that was the Lord speaking to
[1:39:30] you today why because it was their
[1:39:34] object of their worship was the gifts
[1:39:37] you see it even in the way that people
[1:39:40] would approach the services you know
[1:39:42] people would come to service and brother
[1:39:43] Brown announces taxing you know people
[1:39:45] would just roll their eyes and cross
[1:39:49] their arms and you know go to sleep you
[1:39:52] know wake me when to wake me when he
[1:39:54] closes and then we'll you know then
[1:39:56] we'll get to the good stuff you know
[1:39:58] ignoring all the preaching of the word
[1:39:59] ignoring what God's actually wanted to
[1:40:01] speak to them and just hanging on oh man
[1:40:04] oh man I saw a blind kid in the service
[1:40:07] today oh it could be a good one oh think
[1:40:09] of this story I'll have to tell oh my I
[1:40:11] get so excited you know you'd listen on
[1:40:13] the tapes many times the service is not
[1:40:16] that loud the people are not that loud
[1:40:18] there's not a lot
[1:40:19] maybe like tonight okay you know the the
[1:40:21] service is not that loud
[1:40:23] but then brother BAM calls out to some
[1:40:25] person and tells them what their
[1:40:26] situation is and everybody's rejoicing
[1:40:29] the place this erupts but gods just been
[1:40:33] telling them very personally what
[1:40:34] they've needed for the last hour and a
[1:40:36] half but when he mentions where somebody
[1:40:38] lives oh man everybody just goes crazy
[1:40:40] everybody just rejoices oh my oh wow
[1:40:43] that was so incredible and completely
[1:40:46] missing what God was trying to say to
[1:40:47] that because they've made an idol of the
[1:40:50] gifts you know people see the gifts it
[1:40:55] catches their attention and what they
[1:40:56] start craving that's what they're there
[1:41:00] for that's what you know that's what
[1:41:01] that's why they show up to church for is
[1:41:02] is the gifts you know you look around
[1:41:05] churches when we had the pleasure of
[1:41:08] going to a Ukrainian Orthodox Church to
[1:41:09] a funeral and and then is it an
[1:41:13] eye-opening experience to go in and see
[1:41:15] the way that some churches you know run
[1:41:17] thing idols everywhere you know just
[1:41:20] blatant idolatry everywhere you know
[1:41:23] right in the in the sanctuary you're
[1:41:25] looking around images to these Saints
[1:41:27] and images to this and images to that
[1:41:29] and you know there's pictures of you
[1:41:32] know this Saint and what they've done
[1:41:33] and you know all of these different
[1:41:35] things and and then you see the actual
[1:41:36] service and you know there's they carry
[1:41:40] around a cross on a golden cross on a
[1:41:43] stick
[1:41:43] every time they go near the dot cross
[1:41:45] they're gonna stop and give it you know
[1:41:47] bow to it and stop and make you know
[1:41:50] it's just an idol the cross of Jesus
[1:41:53] Christ is so important to us it's it's
[1:41:55] such a critical part of God's plan of
[1:41:57] redemption but in that way it's just an
[1:42:00] idol it's it's a stench to got it
[1:42:04] you know you'd be like you know it would
[1:42:06] be the way that you know your your wife
[1:42:09] or your husband you know who loves you
[1:42:10] dearly you know and you know you come
[1:42:13] home and and and they're just so excited
[1:42:15] to see you and instead of you know
[1:42:17] they're sitting there understand they're
[1:42:18] with their open arms ready to give you a
[1:42:19] hug and kiss and you walk by them and
[1:42:22] you pick up their picture off the wall
[1:42:31] just put that back on the shelf there
[1:42:36] just walk right on by them you know
[1:42:38] that's how ridiculous it is to take an
[1:42:41] image of God and put all our attention
[1:42:44] to all Maya's not wonderful oh my isn't
[1:42:46] that great and God Himself I'm the one
[1:42:52] in the picture you know I'm the one that
[1:42:53] you know I'm the one that gave you all
[1:42:55] these things and you just walked right
[1:42:57] on by that's what idol worship does and
[1:42:59] and what a crazy thing but that's really
[1:43:02] that's what people are doing when they
[1:43:04] substitute and you know we were there
[1:43:05] you know and people that you know didn't
[1:43:07] look like Christians by their dress by
[1:43:09] their you know makeup and their earrings
[1:43:11] and all of those things you know they
[1:43:12] would come at the end of the service to
[1:43:14] give him an opportunity and the priest
[1:43:16] stood there with the little Golden Cross
[1:43:17] and it was all shined up in Polish and
[1:43:19] really nice and gleaming you know just
[1:43:21] like the cross of Calvary of course was
[1:43:22] just a beautiful setting and everything
[1:43:24] just lovely and perfect and sweet and
[1:43:26] they would comment and all of these
[1:43:28] people would just take time you know
[1:43:29] lean in there and give a big kiss to
[1:43:31] that cross and then the next person
[1:43:33] would come lean in and give a kiss to
[1:43:35] that cross and oh what God looks at how
[1:43:39] much just break his heart to see people
[1:43:41] who claim to serve Him just you know
[1:43:45] kissing that picture off the mantle
[1:43:46] instead of instead of himself you know
[1:43:49] what what a thing what a horrible thing
[1:43:51] I would have you know everybody who is
[1:43:56] part of that church probably thought it
[1:43:57] was a great honor to bow and kiss that
[1:43:59] cross but they're actually giving their
[1:44:01] worship to an idol what I'm what a thing
[1:44:04] you know they're living contrary to the
[1:44:06] Word of God but show honor so they think
[1:44:08] they're pleasing God but at the same
[1:44:10] time they're worshipping idols but
[1:44:13] people did the same thing in brother
[1:44:14] Browns meetings like I said you know
[1:44:15] they they would oh they would you know
[1:44:17] they would sure brag him up and
[1:44:19] everything else but the things they were
[1:44:20] bragging him up for wasn't the reason
[1:44:22] that God sent him in the first place God
[1:44:25] sent him to be a messenger and they're
[1:44:26] like gears with this message and a
[1:44:28] crumble that up and and throw it aside
[1:44:30] but but did you see the packaging that
[1:44:32] came in Wow wasn't that incredible oh
[1:44:34] man he was addressed to me I was not
[1:44:36] exciting my name on it you know I sent
[1:44:38] you a letter and you just rejoiced it
[1:44:39] had your name on it but you but you
[1:44:41] never looked at the
[1:44:42] contents of the message you it seem like
[1:44:43] such a shame but that's exactly what
[1:44:45] they were doing to brother branham
[1:44:49] denying the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:44:52] worshiping idols of gifts of man
[1:44:54] you know people can sing with all their
[1:44:56] might praise God through song service
[1:44:58] but if you can't receive the word your
[1:45:01] singing is in vain
[1:45:02] you can worship the music without
[1:45:05] worshiping God that's an incredible
[1:45:07] thing that stumbles people because you
[1:45:09] think about what am i singing I'm saying
[1:45:10] oh how I love Jesus oh how I love Jesus
[1:45:13] you know how could you do that and not
[1:45:15] love Jesus well you can do that because
[1:45:16] you love that Monsieur work you love to
[1:45:19] to you know hear the instrument you love
[1:45:21] to hear the voices blend together you
[1:45:23] love all that you love the atmosphere
[1:45:25] they don't love God even though those
[1:45:27] words are coming out of your mouth what
[1:45:29] an incredible thing you can worship the
[1:45:32] traditions of church without worshiping
[1:45:34] God now I love to just get all dressed
[1:45:36] up and get all hair fixed in place
[1:45:38] everything else in just common you know
[1:45:40] it's a tradition and people have such
[1:45:43] confidence in it it's such strength and
[1:45:45] all children you better be just right in
[1:45:46] church better be just great but you know
[1:45:48] no care at all for the word being
[1:45:51] preached
[1:45:51] it's idol worship right amongst us again
[1:45:54] jesus said in matthew 15 he's quoting
[1:45:57] isaiah says the people this people draw
[1:45:59] nigh unto me with their mouth and
[1:46:01] honoureth me with their lips but their
[1:46:03] heart is far from me in vain do they
[1:46:07] worship Me teaching for doctrines the
[1:46:09] commandments of man this is incredible
[1:46:12] thing even our sermons can teach things
[1:46:15] that become idols in people's life where
[1:46:19] they worship the doctrine more than God
[1:46:23] some things are so important to people
[1:46:25] they won't have any fellowship with you
[1:46:27] unless you believe in a certain way or
[1:46:28] there and yet yet their own heart is far
[1:46:33] from God it's it's hardened to God it's
[1:46:35] become cool it's become lukewarm how is
[1:46:37] that possible but it is because the
[1:46:39] devil will give you any opportunity at
[1:46:42] all to make a little idol that's more
[1:46:44] important than God himself you know any
[1:46:46] opportunity at all just to twist your
[1:46:48] focus so your focus changes you know
[1:46:51] what's important that what's important
[1:46:53] is paying my tithes and coming to church
[1:46:54] that is important but
[1:46:56] the most important thing is meeting the
[1:46:58] God that put all those things in place
[1:47:00] if you come here tonight and all you
[1:47:02] accomplish with you you spent a couple
[1:47:04] hours your time and you know you're you
[1:47:06] you did your part you showed up
[1:47:08] everybody saw you on the video everybody
[1:47:10] you know check your name off on the list
[1:47:12] yep mother was faithful here again night
[1:47:13] sister was here again tonight praise the
[1:47:15] Lord
[1:47:15] you know it and that's it that's the
[1:47:17] extent and we didn't meet Jesus Christ
[1:47:19] tonight then it's all for nothing he
[1:47:21] says in vain do they worship you know
[1:47:24] Jesus told that the people that heard
[1:47:26] the Pharisee he said you can listen to
[1:47:28] what they say but don't do as they do
[1:47:30] you know the word is true but don't
[1:47:33] don't make idols like they have of the
[1:47:35] word don't don't make their education
[1:47:38] and their learning to be the thing
[1:47:39] that's most important actually find the
[1:47:41] Lord it can be so close to an authentic
[1:47:46] walk but if the focus and attention of
[1:47:49] the heart is not on God's Word and not
[1:47:51] on God's will then it's an idol you know
[1:47:55] and in the Book of Daniel Nebuchadnezzar
[1:47:58] the King he proves this concept over and
[1:48:01] over again because Nebuchadnezzar of
[1:48:02] course the Babylonians were Auto
[1:48:05] worshiping people but they come in
[1:48:07] contact with Jehovah and they come in
[1:48:09] contact with them in a mighty way over
[1:48:10] and over again that you know that defies
[1:48:13] all the idols that they have but you can
[1:48:15] tell by their heart that instead of
[1:48:18] receiving that receiving the God that
[1:48:21] can do that they would rather turn that
[1:48:23] God into an idol that they can have
[1:48:25] tangibly with them or see that in Daniel
[1:48:27] chapter 2 that says here then of course
[1:48:30] Daniel just interpreted a dream for
[1:48:32] Nebuchadnezzar and it says then the King
[1:48:33] Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and
[1:48:35] worship Daniel and commanded that they
[1:48:39] should offer an oblation and sweet
[1:48:40] odours unto Him the King answered unto
[1:48:43] Daniel and said ah the truth it is that
[1:48:46] your God is a God of gods and a Lord of
[1:48:49] Kings and a revealer of Secrets seeing
[1:48:52] now could us reveal us this secret but
[1:48:56] notice he doesn't worship that God of
[1:48:59] gods he worships Daniel
[1:49:02] what a strange thing he acknowledges
[1:49:06] that Daniels God is the god of God the
[1:49:09] Lord of Kings but he puts the attention
[1:49:12] on Daniel he says then the King made
[1:49:14] Daniel a great man and gave him many
[1:49:15] great gifts and made him ruler over the
[1:49:18] whole province of Babylon of the chief
[1:49:19] of the governors over all the wise men
[1:49:21] of Babylon
[1:49:22] then Daniel requested the king he said
[1:49:24] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego over the
[1:49:26] Affairs the provinces of the province of
[1:49:27] Babylon
[1:49:28] but Daniel sat in the gate of the king
[1:49:30] Daniel had his special place and it says
[1:49:32] and then in chapter 3 verse 1 it says
[1:49:34] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
[1:49:37] gold whose height was threescore cubits
[1:49:38] 75 feet and and the breadth thereof six
[1:49:42] cubits and he said it up in the plain of
[1:49:44] Dura and the province of Babylon then
[1:49:46] nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather
[1:49:48] together the princes the governors the
[1:49:50] captains the judges the treasurers the
[1:49:52] counselors the sheriffs all the rulers
[1:49:54] of the provinces to come to the
[1:49:56] dedication of the image which
[1:49:58] nebuchadnezzar the king had set up what
[1:50:01] an incredible thing you know if brother
[1:50:04] Branham picks it up and I'm astonished
[1:50:06] that more people just in denominations
[1:50:08] didn't catch this because it you know it
[1:50:11] follows very sequentially a pattern God
[1:50:14] does something Nebuchadnezzar
[1:50:17] responds to that by making an idol by by
[1:50:20] turning it into idol worship and so
[1:50:23] further my picks us up in the mark of
[1:50:24] the beast he says notice when king
[1:50:26] nebuchadnezzar in the beginning back
[1:50:27] yonder when the gentile age was issued
[1:50:30] in let's watch how it come in the way i
[1:50:32] come in you'll find it goes out the same
[1:50:33] way we're living at the time when it
[1:50:35] goes out so it's time to pay attention
[1:50:36] he says we know that there's a beginning
[1:50:38] of a time of grace for the gentiles in
[1:50:39] the ending time is that right now watch
[1:50:41] when king nebuchadnezzar when daniel was
[1:50:43] sent down there a smart prophet when all
[1:50:44] the rest of the jews had kind of humbled
[1:50:46] down and was bowing to the Babylonians
[1:50:47] but there was three four men you know
[1:50:50] three Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and
[1:50:52] and Daniel who purposed in their heart
[1:50:53] they'd serve God and when they throwed
[1:50:55] Shadrach so forth in Daniel had become a
[1:50:58] great man and before Nebuchadnezzar and
[1:51:00] Belshazzar and so forth when he become a
[1:51:02] great man now watch King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:51:04] made an image of gold and set it out in
[1:51:06] the field and said that everybody would
[1:51:07] have to bow to that image did you ever
[1:51:10] notice the innocence of it who that
[1:51:13] image was made of it was Daniel the
[1:51:15] image of
[1:51:16] man and he didn't say the spirits of the
[1:51:18] gods you know he then as they are today
[1:51:21] you know got three or four of them the
[1:51:22] spirits of the gods lived in him and
[1:51:23] they made an image to Daniel and he said
[1:51:26] all that won't make bow to that image
[1:51:28] will be throw it in the fiery furnace
[1:51:29] you noticed Daniels off the scene at
[1:51:31] this time get what I mean do we get what
[1:51:35] he means and ever who had not bowed to
[1:51:38] that image should be cut to pieces or
[1:51:40] throw it in the lion's den or burnt in
[1:51:41] the fiery furnace or something a
[1:51:43] punishment that's the way the Gentile
[1:51:45] dispensation begin with a pagan form of
[1:51:47] religious worship with a persecution to
[1:51:50] make them bow to it and the Bible
[1:51:51] predicts it will end the same way a holy
[1:51:53] man Jesus Christ an image to worship Him
[1:51:55] and so forth you know when you read the
[1:52:00] book of Daniel it stands out so clear
[1:52:02] they were idol worshipers and every time
[1:52:05] that Jehovah does something that no one
[1:52:07] else in the kingdom can do they praise
[1:52:10] the God of that person but then they
[1:52:12] turn and worship the person they turn in
[1:52:15] worship to create the creation more than
[1:52:18] the Creator
[1:52:19] you know Daniel does something
[1:52:21] supernatural so Nebuchadnezzar makes an
[1:52:22] idol of gold and the image of Daniel and
[1:52:24] makes a law that everyone has to bow to
[1:52:27] that image
[1:52:27] he keeps rejecting Jehovah even though
[1:52:31] he keeps saying that their God is
[1:52:33] greater than any other God you know it
[1:52:35] seems like such a paradox he said your
[1:52:36] God is greater than any other guy so let
[1:52:38] me make you another God there to
[1:52:39] distract you and focus your attention on
[1:52:41] something else it's just you know it's
[1:52:43] amazing but that's the way the devil
[1:52:44] works you know so after Shadrach Meshach
[1:52:46] and Abednego come from the furnace they
[1:52:49] you know he has the same kind of awe of
[1:52:51] their God but he still doesn't subject
[1:52:54] his life to that God know the Bible says
[1:52:56] that after Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:52:58] go through the fiery furnace you know it
[1:53:00] says that he made a decree to lift them
[1:53:02] up in the kingdom and promote them but
[1:53:06] he doesn't worship the God you know God
[1:53:10] can you know God just proved to him that
[1:53:15] making that Idol wasn't pleasing and
[1:53:18] that God was with his people that God
[1:53:21] was identified with his people as we
[1:53:22] thought of identification last night and
[1:53:24] so he identified himself as the fourth
[1:53:27] man in the fire with shadrach me check
[1:53:30] Bendigo and yet the first thing that he
[1:53:33] does is promote them in the kingdom and
[1:53:35] lift them up before the people just
[1:53:37] keeps on idol worship it just runs deep
[1:53:40] for them right he's rejecting the God
[1:53:43] but but making an image to that guy you
[1:53:46] know the very same thing has been done
[1:53:48] to brother Branham it's gonna go out the
[1:53:51] same way it came in he said well we're
[1:53:53] right at the end and people have done
[1:53:55] the same thing you know a God a work of
[1:53:58] God that they could not you know doubt
[1:54:00] they could not put you know they cannot
[1:54:02] point a fault at it but instead of
[1:54:04] putting that attention on God and
[1:54:06] serving God with all their heart they've
[1:54:07] now made it the focus of their lives his
[1:54:10] brother Brian the focus of their
[1:54:12] attention is brother Branham and that's
[1:54:14] just as wrong as making the idol to
[1:54:16] Daniel because it takes the worship off
[1:54:19] of God and puts it on to man you know it
[1:54:22] was you know son of man but not to be
[1:54:26] kept on the flesh it was to be kept on
[1:54:28] Christ God did the mighty works God gave
[1:54:33] the visions God gave the word brother
[1:54:35] Branham was simply the messenger for God
[1:54:37] but the attention is so many its focus
[1:54:40] on the messenger lift him up lift him up
[1:54:42] you know Oh for the members above the
[1:54:44] fivefold ministry birth as this you know
[1:54:45] but you know I'll just take his word for
[1:54:47] I'm gonna take a pastor's words I want
[1:54:48] to take by the band's word for well
[1:54:50] you're missing God's provided way then
[1:54:51] because God's Word said that he put
[1:54:53] pastors and evangelists and prophets and
[1:54:55] teachers and apostles all in the body
[1:54:57] why people will serve the image more
[1:55:00] than the Word of God you know just
[1:55:03] because the the man was holy doesn't
[1:55:06] mean that you can't make an idol of it
[1:55:07] you know people think idols are just of
[1:55:09] ugly things
[1:55:10] idols are just a demonic thing no idols
[1:55:12] can be completely godly things godly
[1:55:15] things made into an image that's not God
[1:55:18] himself
[1:55:20] the same way an object or idea can be
[1:55:23] made into idle a person even a god-given
[1:55:26] minister can become an idol you know how
[1:55:29] we need to examine our lives and see why
[1:55:31] the focus of our attention really is you
[1:55:34] know are we just keeping the message are
[1:55:36] we just claiming a profit or do we truly
[1:55:39] strive every day because that's the only
[1:55:44] thing that God really cares about he
[1:55:47] doesn't care how many times you
[1:55:48] mentioned his name he doesn't care if
[1:55:50] your heart's far from him none of those
[1:55:52] things matter to him he wants to see
[1:55:55] your life subjective daily to his will
[1:55:57] Lord what do you want me to do so many
[1:56:00] times we come to God and we tell him
[1:56:01] what we want him to do but how many
[1:56:04] times do we say god I want this but I I
[1:56:10] know that you might have something
[1:56:11] totally different in mine and so what
[1:56:13] I'm really asking Lord is what do you
[1:56:15] want for me what do you want from my
[1:56:18] life you know and so many times we pray
[1:56:20] just our will be done but that's not
[1:56:22] what that's not what Jesus taught us to
[1:56:24] pray he said thy will be done
[1:56:25] and that's that's the key of it right
[1:56:27] there is not finding other ways to get
[1:56:30] what we want out of it but Lord what do
[1:56:33] you want from my life Paul and the
[1:56:38] Corinthians he says but I fear lest by
[1:56:40] any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[1:56:42] through his subtlety so your minds
[1:56:44] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[1:56:46] that is in Christ it's not complicated
[1:56:49] people always want to make it really
[1:56:50] complicated what is to serve God how
[1:56:59] complicated is it just to to you know
[1:57:02] live peaceably and have a good
[1:57:04] relationship with your spouse it's not
[1:57:06] that complicated you know do things that
[1:57:08] they enjoy you know be be selfless you
[1:57:11] know you know don't be selfish you know
[1:57:15] and share your time and share your
[1:57:16] energy and share your attention you know
[1:57:18] and you'll have a good marriage it's not
[1:57:20] rocket science but a lot of people don't
[1:57:21] have it because not willing to subject
[1:57:23] the selfishness not willing to put aside
[1:57:25] their own will to allow that that's how
[1:57:27] simple it is serving God that's why when
[1:57:30] Paul talks about the relationship of
[1:57:32] Christ in the church
[1:57:33] it's it's so mixed together with the
[1:57:35] marriage of a husband and wife that you
[1:57:37] you know he has to keeps telling them
[1:57:38] I'm talking about Christ in the church
[1:57:40] but then he goes right back talking
[1:57:41] about the husband and wife you know it
[1:57:42] just it's so inseparable because it's
[1:57:44] the exact same thing you know I don't
[1:57:46] have to you know walk on my hands and
[1:57:48] knees broken glass down the driveway to
[1:57:50] please my wife where would you like to
[1:57:58] go for dinner what what would you like
[1:57:59] to do you know and just share that time
[1:58:01] and attention and that's satisfaction
[1:58:04] you know a lot of times I'm amazed that
[1:58:07] you know I said are you happy like what
[1:58:10] you know what do we need to do really
[1:58:19] hang up a couple pictures you'll be
[1:58:21] happy with me oh wow all right in a
[1:58:24] little bit when I'm gonna busy finish
[1:58:26] reading this article or you know I fish
[1:58:28] play his game yeah I'll be right there
[1:58:29] that's our attitude we slipped back into
[1:58:31] selfishness but but we realize it's just
[1:58:34] the little things of our attention and
[1:58:36] time that's what that's what pleases one
[1:58:40] another so when we spend that little bit
[1:58:42] of attention in time and that's what
[1:58:44] pleases God you know God's never gonna
[1:58:45] be disappointed in us if we're looking
[1:58:47] for his leadership if we're looking for
[1:58:49] his will because it's then up to him to
[1:58:51] show us his will to give us his way but
[1:58:55] Paul says here for if he that cometh
[1:58:57] preaches another jesus whom we have not
[1:58:58] preached or if you receive another
[1:59:00] spirit which you have not received or
[1:59:01] another gospel which you mana which you
[1:59:04] have not accepted you might well bear
[1:59:05] with him Paul saying it's possible to
[1:59:09] even make Jesus an idol just by changing
[1:59:15] the focus of Jesus into an image of
[1:59:18] Jesus what an incredible thing you could
[1:59:23] take God and make God into an idol that
[1:59:26] doesn't give glory to God that you know
[1:59:28] it sounds like such a paradox but you
[1:59:31] can do that you know people will take
[1:59:33] their one experience that they had with
[1:59:35] the Lord 20 years ago and that's their
[1:59:37] whole center of their life it's the the
[1:59:41] whole foundation of their experience
[1:59:42] everything is because twenty years ago
[1:59:44] God did something for them in their life
[1:59:46] you've taken the
[1:59:47] the works of God and you made that into
[1:59:49] an idol because there's a living God
[1:59:51] today that has the wants to have the
[1:59:53] same relationship that he had with you
[1:59:55] 20 years ago you know it's not supposed
[1:59:58] to become a historical thing it's a
[2:00:01] simple walk just subjecting your will in
[2:00:03] your life to God's will every day as we
[2:00:10] look the close here Paul tells us what
[2:00:14] communion is supposed to be like first
[2:00:16] Corinthians chapter 11
[2:00:17] communion scriptures and he says
[2:00:20] speaking of Jesus here and when he had
[2:00:22] given thanks he brake it and said take
[2:00:24] eat this is my body which is broken for
[2:00:26] you this do in remembrance of me after
[2:00:29] the same manner also he took the cup
[2:00:31] when he had supped and saying this cup
[2:00:33] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[2:00:35] ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance
[2:00:37] of me excuse me for as often as you eat
[2:00:40] this bread and drink this cup you do
[2:00:41] show the Lord's death till he come
[2:00:42] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[2:00:44] and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:00:46] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:00:47] and the blood of the Lord but let a man
[2:00:50] examine himself and so let him eat of
[2:00:53] that bread and drink of that Cup for he
[2:00:56] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[2:00:57] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[2:01:00] not discerning the Lord's body for this
[2:01:05] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[2:01:06] and many sleep for if we would judge
[2:01:09] ourselves we should not be judged you
[2:01:14] know that's an incredible thing because
[2:01:15] God gives his word to us and he actually
[2:01:17] equips us with the tools to check our
[2:01:20] own life he equips us with his word to
[2:01:23] take that word and apply to our own
[2:01:25] lives and say well where am I at lore am
[2:01:29] i discerning your body
[2:01:31] am i discerning your body or or am I am
[2:01:35] I focused on an idol here Lord what the
[2:01:37] communion is supposed to produce that
[2:01:40] inward walk that checks ourselves
[2:01:44] automatically you know if we would judge
[2:01:46] ourselves what's judging us the spirit
[2:01:48] that's inside of us that's what's
[2:01:50] judging us saying Lord is there
[2:01:51] something in me there's something to me
[2:01:53] that needs to change and when we do that
[2:01:55] he gives us the answer and then we move
[2:01:58] forward that we be not judged what we
[2:02:00] don't comment to judge
[2:02:01] we won't stand before the white throne
[2:02:03] judgment because our lives will have
[2:02:04] already been judged as the Spirit works
[2:02:07] in us to make us into God's own likeness
[2:02:09] the natural communion we take is not
[2:02:12] different than the spiritual community
[2:02:14] it's just natural types to spiritually
[2:02:16] we need the same life that Jesus had you
[2:02:20] know when I when I personally take
[2:02:22] communion I try to do that you know I
[2:02:24] don't just come and say all you know I
[2:02:25] just want go through the community
[2:02:26] service but you know I'm chewing that
[2:02:28] bread and I'm thinking Lord this is
[2:02:30] representing your word representing you
[2:02:33] you know I said that you know the Word
[2:02:34] was God the word is God and so you know
[2:02:38] Lord am I am i I jesting your word the
[2:02:41] same way that I'm eating this bread you
[2:02:43] know is is your word as sweet in my
[2:02:46] mother's you know is that life to me is
[2:02:48] that strength to me the same way that
[2:02:50] there's natural bread is you know this
[2:02:52] wine you know that burns my throat on
[2:02:54] the way down I don't know about you I
[2:02:55] don't really particularly enjoy the the
[2:02:57] wine and and effect of it I saw heard a
[2:02:59] lot of people say oh I just love it you
[2:03:00] know communion every day would be
[2:03:02] wonderful but but as it's burning down
[2:03:05] my throat I think Lord is your is your
[2:03:08] life burning in mind you know is is it
[2:03:12] actually producing a stimulation you
[2:03:15] know is it is it putting me on fire is
[2:03:16] it you know is it lifting me up is it
[2:03:18] stimulating me or is it just dull these
[2:03:23] are like drinking water you know is it
[2:03:25] you know you know some churches they
[2:03:27] drink grape juice instead of wine you
[2:03:29] know because it's but you know that it
[2:03:34] is your is your word is your life grape
[2:03:36] juice to me Lord or is there some
[2:03:38] stimulation to it is there some power to
[2:03:40] change my behavior you know you drink
[2:03:42] alcohol it changes your behavior you
[2:03:45] know you might think you're all in
[2:03:46] control and everything you have enough
[2:03:47] alcohol you've got no control at all
[2:03:49] that's that's really what taking in the
[2:03:51] Spirit of God is is that the control
[2:03:53] leave and we started to have a different
[2:03:55] behavior we need to examine ourselves
[2:04:01] regularly that was the commandment at
[2:04:03] communion time while communion supposed
[2:04:04] to happen every day so every day there's
[2:04:06] an examining there's an examining
[2:04:08] irregularity to see if there's anything
[2:04:10] that's breaking that communion not god
[2:04:12] am i doing anything wrong you're going
[2:04:13] to send me to hell no
[2:04:14] god am i doing anything wrong that's
[2:04:16] displeasing to you so that I can walk
[2:04:18] with you you know I don't know about you
[2:04:21] bring up the natural example of a
[2:04:23] husband and wife but if my wife's quiet
[2:04:26] she doesn't respond very much when I
[2:04:28] talk to her you know and it's just oh
[2:04:32] whatever
[2:04:33] what have I done what what's wrong I
[2:04:35] gotta fix that you know she should be
[2:04:36] happy she should be you know she should
[2:04:38] be pleased she should be you know
[2:04:39] communicating she should be entered
[2:04:42] enthusiastic and so when she's not at
[2:04:45] home honey what you know what's wrong
[2:04:47] did I do something to bother you is
[2:04:48] there something wrong is the kids
[2:04:50] whatever it is I you know you can't rest
[2:04:52] till she's feeling better again till you
[2:04:54] know that old if momma ain't happy
[2:04:55] nobody's happy so you know you but you
[2:04:57] just desire to see that happiness back
[2:04:59] and you do what it takes to bring it
[2:05:01] back you know sometimes you just kind of
[2:05:03] give you some time space I guess but but
[2:05:05] you know you want to restore that
[2:05:07] communion because it's important yeah
[2:05:09] but you know with God we can just be so
[2:05:12] distant we haven't heard from God in
[2:05:13] months years happily married just going
[2:05:19] on with the Lord yeah I'm not really
[2:05:21] sure what God is doing I'm not really
[2:05:22] sure what God wants for me I'm not
[2:05:23] really sure you know I'm not really sure
[2:05:25] but you know I'm just just content to
[2:05:27] keep on going no I should make us
[2:05:29] uncomfortable if we don't know that
[2:05:31] we're walking in the perfect will of God
[2:05:32] it should make us uncomfortable you know
[2:05:35] if we're making decisions and we
[2:05:36] realized you know what I never even
[2:05:37] thought about what God's will is for me
[2:05:39] I trust that all happens to some of us
[2:05:40] sometimes it but you know if we get into
[2:05:43] that position be like okay well I guess
[2:05:44] I'll try next time no it should be Oh
[2:05:46] Lord did I make the right decision you
[2:05:48] know let me come back to you and and
[2:05:50] realize that I didn't even consult you
[2:05:52] on this is this the right thing for my
[2:05:54] life it's just the right thing did I
[2:05:56] make the right choice here and you know
[2:05:58] and if we didn't make the right choice
[2:05:59] don't just you know make some convoluted
[2:06:00] explanation of you know oh this is
[2:06:02] really the purple of God let me explain
[2:06:04] it say know what I think I missed it you
[2:06:07] know brother Rama I appreciate so much
[2:06:09] about him is that he had the humility to
[2:06:10] say I missed the Lord here or outright
[2:06:13] disobeyed the Lord here I knew I
[2:06:16] shouldn't go but I still went I knew I
[2:06:18] shouldn't do this but I did it anyway
[2:06:20] you know and then say oh my lord what
[2:06:23] what do you want from me now Paul says
[2:06:26] if we judge ourselves we won't be
[2:06:28] judge if we take time to examine our own
[2:06:30] lives and see what is the true focus of
[2:06:32] our spiritual attention and then turn it
[2:06:34] back to Christ if it's straight then God
[2:06:37] blesses that God's pleased by that you
[2:06:40] know the rich young ruler looked like he
[2:06:43] was interested in the will of God and
[2:06:44] brother BAM using him an example over
[2:06:46] and over and over again because he was
[2:06:48] speaking to people that were living good
[2:06:50] lives you know he's speaking to people
[2:06:52] that wouldn't went to church people that
[2:06:53] you know dress right people that lived
[2:06:55] right people that you know believe the
[2:06:57] Bible and you know we could say the same
[2:06:59] thing about all of us tonight every
[2:07:00] single one of us you know a message
[2:07:02] believer we would call ourselves every
[2:07:03] single one of us you know believe the
[2:07:05] brother brown was a prophet every single
[2:07:06] one of us you know believe that Jesus
[2:07:07] Christ died for our sins though most of
[2:07:09] us would be baptized and would have our
[2:07:10] lives dedicated to him and yet we could
[2:07:12] say the same thing tonight if there's
[2:07:15] anything in your life that you wouldn't
[2:07:17] be willing to give up in order to walk
[2:07:19] with God and you've got the rich young
[2:07:23] ruler looked like a faithful Israelite
[2:07:25] serving Jehovah but he had an idol in
[2:07:27] his life and it was an idol of gold just
[2:07:30] like him just like the Babylonians head
[2:07:32] of Daniel it was an idol of gold he
[2:07:34] wouldn't give up that money he wouldn't
[2:07:37] give it up and so even though he's
[2:07:39] crying out to God and flesh he's
[2:07:41] actually his worship is through an idol
[2:07:43] and when he finds out that it would cost
[2:07:46] him his idol in order to obtain eternal
[2:07:48] life he sticks with the idol in our own
[2:07:52] lives is you know we we fit that example
[2:07:55] of the rich young ruler like I said
[2:07:56] we're in a place where we know the word
[2:07:58] we're not even coming here tonight
[2:08:00] unaware of where God is we know where
[2:08:02] God is gods in his word we know that you
[2:08:04] know our lives can't live apart from
[2:08:06] that word and be pleasing to the Lord so
[2:08:08] if there's something that we're not
[2:08:10] willing to sacrifice to follow God then
[2:08:12] we're guilty of the same thing you know
[2:08:16] the same Israel that would go on to sin
[2:08:18] they made a declaration to the Lord many
[2:08:22] times and said that they would serve the
[2:08:24] Lord and I just want to bring your
[2:08:25] attention to one of them here Joshua 24
[2:08:28] josh was explaining to them if they will
[2:08:31] serve the Lord then you will bless them
[2:08:32] and if they turn from the Lord then
[2:08:34] you'll bring them into judgment and turn
[2:08:37] them over to their enemies and verse 21
[2:08:39] over 24 it says and the people said unto
[2:08:41] Joshua
[2:08:41] nay but we will serve the Lord and
[2:08:44] Joshua said unto the people you are
[2:08:46] witnesses against yourself yourselves
[2:08:50] that you have chosen you the Lord to
[2:08:53] serve him and they said we are witnesses
[2:08:57] and he says now therefore put away said
[2:09:00] he the strange gods which are among you
[2:09:02] and incline your heart unto the Lord God
[2:09:05] of Israel
[2:09:06] you know when the words presented to us
[2:09:08] we say oh I'll follow that I'll follow
[2:09:10] that but he says now put away the
[2:09:13] strange God
[2:09:14] put away the idols put aside those
[2:09:16] things that are taking your focus away
[2:09:18] you know put aside anything else that's
[2:09:20] that's got your attention anything else
[2:09:22] that's exalting itself above the will of
[2:09:24] God and get your attention properly in
[2:09:27] place because you're a witness against
[2:09:29] yourself
[2:09:29] I'm following the Lord you know the the
[2:09:34] Bible tells us that Jesus said you know
[2:09:37] God would give sight to the blind but
[2:09:39] not to the Pharisee because they said
[2:09:41] that they could see he said you're blind
[2:09:43] but you said you could see therefore
[2:09:46] your sin remains on you you know the
[2:09:48] blind man that comes to Jesus gets his
[2:09:49] sight but the one that says I'm the
[2:09:51] blind I don't need you Lord well then
[2:09:54] your sin remains with you because you
[2:09:56] said you don't have any need of it the
[2:09:59] encouragement comes Paul here in Hebrews
[2:10:02] chapter 12 last Scripture wherefore
[2:10:04] seeing we also are compassed about with
[2:10:06] so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[2:10:10] aside every weight and the sin with us
[2:10:14] so easily beset us and let us run with
[2:10:17] patience the race that is set before us
[2:10:20] and then what does he do focuses our
[2:10:23] attention exactly where it needs to be
[2:10:25] looking unto Jesus the author and
[2:10:28] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[2:10:30] that was set before him endured the
[2:10:32] cross despising the shame and is set
[2:10:35] down at the right hand of the throne of
[2:10:38] God you know I often I talk about our
[2:10:41] place in the throne because I believe
[2:10:43] that's where our focus should be if our
[2:10:46] focus is on the throne we're looking
[2:10:48] right at Jesus because he's sitting in
[2:10:49] the throne
[2:10:50] we're looking at our position in the
[2:10:52] world and we're moving towards it you
[2:10:54] know try try looking somewhere else and
[2:10:57] walking in it looking at something and
[2:10:59] walking in a different direction it's
[2:11:00] really difficult to do you know because
[2:11:03] your body naturally wants to follow
[2:11:04] where you're looking and so you know
[2:11:07] when we look at the word if we're
[2:11:08] looking at the right thing our spiritual
[2:11:10] body starts to move in that direction as
[2:11:12] well you can't have your eyes on Christ
[2:11:14] properly and be off going in the
[2:11:16] opposite direction it doesn't work
[2:11:18] it tells us if we're finding ourselves
[2:11:19] constantly sidetracked
[2:11:21] it tells us that our attention is
[2:11:23] focused on things that are taking us in
[2:11:25] that direction
[2:11:26] I trust that helps you I I don't know
[2:11:28] your lives I don't I know my own life
[2:11:30] and I say god I see little idols
[2:11:32] cropping up from time to time and if I
[2:11:34] let them they become a bigger and bigger
[2:11:36] place in my life and I got to go through
[2:11:38] and sweep those things out of the way
[2:11:40] break them down you know looking at the
[2:11:42] kings of Israel many many times the
[2:11:46] scripture would give an account of all
[2:11:47] the different Kings you know this one
[2:11:49] was begotten and he raised up and it
[2:11:52] really only lists a couple of things if
[2:11:53] he did what was right on the side of the
[2:11:55] Lord and what he did with the idols you
[2:11:58] know and many of them had said he did
[2:12:01] what was right in the idols but he
[2:12:02] didn't cut down the groves and he didn't
[2:12:04] put away the strange guy you know the
[2:12:06] next one it'll say you know he he did
[2:12:08] wickedness you know he made more groves
[2:12:10] he made more idols he you know he made
[2:12:12] it greater than his father before him
[2:12:14] but you know it was the exception when a
[2:12:17] king would both do what was right on the
[2:12:19] side of the Lord and take all the idols
[2:12:21] there take all the high places down why
[2:12:23] because that's what we're driven to you
[2:12:26] is to find substitutes for God but I
[2:12:29] trust that God's bride he's not going to
[2:12:31] have an idol over here and God over here
[2:12:34] she's gonna put all those things away
[2:12:36] and concentrate her attention on here
[2:12:39] amen let's stand together
[2:12:49] I think I seem to some turn your eyes
[2:12:51] upon Jesus look full in his wonderful
[2:12:53] face it's so simple but I believe the
[2:12:59] Lord gives ministers this types of
[2:13:01] thoughts just to cause us to go through
[2:13:03] our lives you know go check and Israel
[2:13:05] had a time every year that they needed
[2:13:07] to go through the house and you know
[2:13:08] with a candle searching out every bit
[2:13:10] eleven why because things have a way of
[2:13:12] creeping in things have a way of warming
[2:13:14] their way into our lives and you know
[2:13:16] it's not up to the minister to come over
[2:13:17] your house with the checklist and say
[2:13:19] okay okay do I see any movies here okay
[2:13:23] do you see any music lessons you know
[2:13:25] it's not up to that it's up to you
[2:13:27] individually heads of home mothers
[2:13:30] fathers look at your life look at your
[2:13:33] home you know look at yourself and say
[2:13:35] God is there anything in me is there any
[2:13:37] 11 in here Lord because I know if there
[2:13:40] is it's just gonna continue to grow its
[2:13:42] just gonna leaven the whole lump but
[2:13:44] tear down those things lower take them
[2:13:46] away from me and and I know that if I
[2:13:48] keep my eyes on you I'm going to obtain
[2:13:56] [Music]
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:15:05] [Music]
[2:15:17] Jesus father it's your spirit that we
[2:15:22] claim to live by Lord it's your spirit
[2:15:24] that we we want working in our lives
[2:15:26] Lord father you put this thought on my
[2:15:29] heart and but I don't know if it affects
[2:15:32] a single person though but I know it it
[2:15:34] affects my life Lord the devil always
[2:15:37] given us an opportunity father to find
[2:15:39] substitutes for you Oh Lord that's not
[2:15:43] what I want Lord I want my life to be
[2:15:45] fully yielded to you each day each
[2:15:47] moment Lord each thought each feeling
[2:15:50] father I pray that your spirit would
[2:15:52] touch each life tonight Lord if we would
[2:15:55] say father is there something hindering
[2:15:57] my life Lord Lord may you show us what
[2:16:00] it is Lord show us what's holding us
[2:16:02] back
[2:16:02] showing what what's got our attention
[2:16:04] father put your finger on it and then
[2:16:08] Lord we ask you to give us the courage
[2:16:09] the boldness Lord to put away those
[2:16:13] strange guy I'll put away those things
[2:16:16] that are hindering us not just till
[2:16:19] tomorrow but break those things down we
[2:16:23] want our attention we want our focus on
[2:16:26] you and Lord we know that your focus is
[2:16:29] on us
[2:16:29] because Lord your desire is to bring us
[2:16:32] home and set us in your throne Lord like
[2:16:36] a husband would like a wife to share a
[2:16:38] life that Lord is full of love that's
[2:16:40] what you have in store for us father I
[2:16:42] pray that you would just speak to us
[2:16:45] Lord not we know you don't condemn us
[2:16:48] but you can evict us the order you on
[2:16:50] our hearts you show us where we have new
[2:16:52] change
[2:16:54] I pray it changes it would give us the
[2:16:57] humility and the courage to do those
[2:16:59] things whatever it might cost we know we
[2:17:02] all up to be an eternal life we just
[2:17:05] commit each saint to you tonight Lord
[2:17:07] and I pray that Odin you'd go with us
[2:17:10] let let's not forget quickly your word
[2:17:12] but no and maybe we just linger on it
[2:17:14] think about it
[2:17:15] daily father we want our whole life
[2:17:18] subject
[2:17:20] father have your way we pray in Jesus
[2:17:25] you guys seem to song change my heart O
[2:17:28] God change my heart
[2:17:35] [Music]
[2:17:45] [Applause]
[2:17:51] Hey
[2:17:52] [Applause]
[2:17:53] [Music]
[2:18:02] Oh
[2:18:04] [Music]
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:26] [Music]
[2:18:32] [Music]
[2:18:34] [Applause]
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:38] [Applause]
[2:18:46] [Music]
[2:18:48] [Applause]
[2:18:50] I like singing however you want I like
[2:18:57] to let me be like you because there was
[2:19:00] the way that Jesus early Christ spoke
[2:19:03] creation he said let there be you know
[2:19:06] and I believe it's not presumptuous to
[2:19:08] say Lord let me be like you let that
[2:19:11] same creative word that spoke you know
[2:19:14] worlds into existence let it produce in
[2:19:16] me the character that you have Lord the
[2:19:20] very life that you have you're not
[2:19:21] afraid to put that in me but you it's
[2:19:24] your desire Lord to put that in me so
[2:19:26] let me be like you in it

[2:20:26] [Applause]
[2:20:29] [Music]
[2:20:36] [Applause]
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:53] god bless you
[2:20:54] try not to mr. law but I thought about
[2:21:00] it last night again tonight I didn't
[2:21:02] mention last night that's it
[2:21:04] the difference in our brother Macondo
[2:21:06] and brother Brandon his brother makan
[2:21:12] that closes seven times and brother
[2:21:14] Brandon and only closes maybe three
[2:21:16] times and so but began we never close
[2:21:23] God never closes it we close it but God
[2:21:26] doesn't guy keeps on going with it
[2:21:29] through through the night and into the
[2:21:31] next day right on maybe through your
[2:21:33] through your entire life by grace he'll
[2:21:36] keep on going because it is is work and
[2:21:40] sometimes we would like maybe sometimes
[2:21:42] there the way our brother preach you
[2:21:45] know there's one attitude in your head
[2:21:47] to another attitude I trust in your
[2:21:49] heart and sometimes we wish they
[2:21:52] cottonwoods would stop this or stop that
[2:21:54] you know but know God's going to keep at
[2:21:57] it because you've got a you got a war
[2:22:00] going on here there's a war going on and
[2:22:03] it is God versus Satan and when you're
[2:22:06] born again he comes into God comes into
[2:22:09] the soul drives that old nature of the
[2:22:11] devil out and he takes control
[2:22:13] he becomes the lord of your life then a
[2:22:16] man now Satan has got a battle on his
[2:22:19] hands Satan is still going to work in
[2:22:21] your flesh amen so Satan's are still
[2:22:24] gonna work in the senses of your flesh
[2:22:26] and in your mind amen but God is going
[2:22:29] to control what your soul and your
[2:22:32] spirit and reaching out through your
[2:22:34] spirit to control you to keep you in
[2:22:37] line with or amen to keep us in the
[2:22:41] middle of the road by the grace of God
[2:22:43] because the enemy is going to be there
[2:22:46] to get us to to go aside the enemy is
[2:22:49] going to be there as our brother preach
[2:22:51] tonight
[2:22:52] to to make us idol worshipers and listen
[2:22:56] again o mine
[2:22:59] just think of how far that the enemy is
[2:23:03] going to drive the people how far that
[2:23:06] he's going to he's going to push them
[2:23:08] into idolatry in the sense said the
[2:23:11] Bible says he will be in the temple of
[2:23:13] God being worshipped as God Amen just
[2:23:17] think of that people will come in and
[2:23:19] they're going to worship and they're
[2:23:20] gonna sing our brother brought it all
[2:23:22] out and even the doctrines and all of
[2:23:25] these things and the teachings and maybe
[2:23:28] even a testimony all these things and
[2:23:31] they think that they're worshiping God
[2:23:33] when they're they're worshiping the
[2:23:35] devil a man that that's how deceiving
[2:23:37] that Satan is so again as I have said
[2:23:42] don't just say you believe the message
[2:23:44] because the devil believes it and it
[2:23:47] became in faith it ought to give the
[2:23:49] bride faith they may never give him the
[2:23:51] faith that come down and gives us the
[2:23:53] faith by the grace of God to go out but
[2:23:56] he is working in your life and in mine
[2:23:59] he's been working and I heart brother
[2:24:01] brought it out through the word from
[2:24:03] Genesis right up through you know Satan
[2:24:05] has been working to get us into idolatry
[2:24:07] a man and in he did it with Eve in the
[2:24:12] Garden of Eden and he didn't be Cain
[2:24:15] outside and he did with the others
[2:24:18] and rain is so Satan hasn't changed and
[2:24:21] when it comes to his motive and his
[2:24:23] objective no no no he said he remember
[2:24:26] again the sermon we preached some years
[2:24:28] ago the five I wills of the devil in in
[2:24:32] Isaiah Ezekiel there I will I will
[2:24:35] ascend above the heights of the clouds I
[2:24:37] will be like the Most High I will this
[2:24:41] so he's working on that but God's
[2:24:44] working on I will he said he said I
[2:24:47] really should do this I will do this to
[2:24:50] redeem us back to himself again
[2:24:52] and God's working on that and E God's
[2:24:55] good cods gonna succeed but the enemy is
[2:24:58] going to be there and he's going to let
[2:24:59] the enemy there you know it's like the
[2:25:02] Bible says well who's gonna go down and
[2:25:04] deceive a a man what you mean to tell me
[2:25:09] God's gonna let somebody let let
[2:25:11] somebody do that yeah but God Himself
[2:25:14] wouldn't do it because that's not innate
[2:25:15] God's nature no no no and none of the
[2:25:18] angels in heaven that's not their nature
[2:25:20] no no no but a lying spirit came up
[2:25:24] before God and he said I'll go down and
[2:25:28] he said I would be a lying spirit in the
[2:25:30] mouth of all of his prophets what not
[2:25:35] the witness for the Wizards know y'all
[2:25:38] be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of
[2:25:40] his prophets a man this is a closer it
[2:25:44] is a man this is how much like the real
[2:25:46] thing is you know and like I said he was
[2:25:49] the first evangelist and he was the
[2:25:52] first preached resident worryingly in
[2:25:56] the in the in the Garden of Eden and
[2:25:58] then he and he made a convert and it was
[2:26:02] he and look what he made a gave her an
[2:26:08] idol he gave her an idol and she
[2:26:11] worshipped it and it was good you know
[2:26:14] and so on so and these things that are
[2:26:16] right on down to this out right I know
[2:26:18] that this age it is still an idol it is
[2:26:21] still an idol so I and he makes anything
[2:26:25] and everything in your life that appeals
[2:26:27] to your senses of your flesh are you
[2:26:29] going to try to make it an idol so our
[2:26:32] brother got used with God and our
[2:26:34] brother again denied confirming the word
[2:26:38] Amen God in our brother getting
[2:26:40] confirming when you've been hearing from
[2:26:42] the Prophet God in our brother Brandon
[2:26:45] confirming again while you've been
[2:26:47] earrings or you're a pastor Amen over
[2:26:49] all these years there are definite
[2:26:51] earrings through our brother Macondo any
[2:26:53] man that other
[2:26:54] surely that in this pulpit a man and he
[2:26:58] touched on something tonight and he went
[2:26:59] into something tonight and I thought
[2:27:01] about the other brother we had here
[2:27:03] brother Michael T and so on mothers
[2:27:06] listen God God God save as they are you
[2:27:10] are in you and in me and in this brother
[2:27:14] in this sister he's going to say the
[2:27:15] same thing
[2:27:16] Amen by the grace of God the word he's
[2:27:20] going to stay with the whole word not
[2:27:22] just nine out of that and he won't want
[2:27:24] you to throw one no no the devil that
[2:27:27] get try to get you to change one but not
[2:27:30] God
[2:27:31] so I thank God with a word tonight so
[2:27:33] hear the word of the Lord and cast the
[2:27:36] idols out of your life casts the idols
[2:27:39] out of your home and I did I did maybe
[2:27:43] we have touched on today over the years
[2:27:45] but I the brothers come in and he has
[2:27:48] crown something I told you to do such a
[2:27:52] few weeks ago apply the token to your
[2:27:54] houses apply the token to your home but
[2:27:57] by the token to your light well as I
[2:28:00] said throw this out throw that out well
[2:28:02] he come and identifying what you had to
[2:28:04] throw out those idols so brother and
[2:28:08] I'll tell you this
[2:28:09] yeah your your looks can become an idol
[2:28:13] and he said your money can become an
[2:28:15] idol you're a house can become an idol
[2:28:17] your car can become an idol and I'll be
[2:28:20] honest the more spiritual yet I believe
[2:28:23] the more you hate all those things amen
[2:28:26] and the more you're going to want you're
[2:28:28] going to want that body like unto his
[2:28:31] glorious body amen
[2:28:33] that's the truth a glutton that world
[2:28:35] I'm sick of it you know and again and
[2:28:38] maybe the people would feel even
[2:28:40] believers would feel as I mentioned I
[2:28:42] believe last night where somebody has
[2:28:45] asked to the Prophet surely you don't
[2:28:48] believe you know you don't want the God
[2:28:50] to in the world now know that doesn't
[2:28:54] make sense for a
[2:28:55] do we even ask that kind of a question
[2:28:57] he said I sure do
[2:28:59] he said I want God to end it now right
[2:29:03] now he's just so I can go and I come
[2:29:05] back before the Lord Jesus Christ hey
[2:29:07] man so how many years into it in their
[2:29:10] souls and then he has got the M&E and I
[2:29:15] had this message right here and it's it
[2:29:18] must be born again
[2:29:20] amen you must be born again so Anthony
[2:29:23] has got God in their souls
[2:29:25] he's got God in your soldiers stay with
[2:29:28] the word the whole word the nothing but
[2:29:30] the work and as the Bible says walk in
[2:29:34] the light as he is in the light have
[2:29:35] fellowship one with another and the
[2:29:37] blood of cleanse blood blood is applied
[2:29:39] to you
[2:29:40] amen but when well that I got sister
[2:29:44] said to me one time when she said
[2:29:46] brother she said I believe the blood of
[2:29:48] Jesus Christ
[2:29:49] she sets homes for my sin she didn't
[2:29:51] believe this she didn't believe that she
[2:29:52] didn't believe I said wait a minute
[2:29:54] I said the Bible says here walking the
[2:29:56] light as he is in the light and I said
[2:29:59] in you have fellowship with the other
[2:30:01] believers the body of Christ then the
[2:30:04] blood I said atone for your sins
[2:30:06] I said he redeems the body amen he
[2:30:10] redeems the body hey man you got to be a
[2:30:12] part of that body it was him as the body
[2:30:15] of Christ that went down and came back
[2:30:18] praise the Lord conquering Dan hell
[2:30:20] degrade a man so that he could give you
[2:30:24] victory over the world the flesh and the
[2:30:26] devil
[2:30:27] he already added as I brother brought
[2:30:29] that out tonight concerning Jesus you
[2:30:31] know and he didn't have to do the whole
[2:30:34] prayer yeah he didn't have to do this
[2:30:36] but he did it because he was God amen he
[2:30:40] was on he was the Word of God made flesh
[2:30:42] and
[2:30:44] you talk about white rice speak all you
[2:30:47] do is speak the word and he knew that a
[2:30:49] man but he did it in Italy it was an
[2:30:53] example for you identifying with you
[2:30:55] identifying with me and so that we could
[2:30:57] follow his example if any if he did it
[2:30:59] we ought to do it
[2:31:01] amen and the thing of it is people are
[2:31:03] not praying enough that is the absolute
[2:31:07] truth you've got to pray when you're
[2:31:08] walking you got to pray when you're
[2:31:10] working you got to pray when you're
[2:31:11] talking you got to pray with you when
[2:31:13] you're even listening to our brother
[2:31:15] Brandon tonight
[2:31:16] you ought to been in prayer in your soul
[2:31:19] pray pray pray amen oh that's not
[2:31:23] possible that is possible with God all
[2:31:27] things are possible so I pray God
[2:31:30] tonight you weren't going to listen to
[2:31:31] the word and you're gonna go home
[2:31:33] tonight and again and every day because
[2:31:36] the enemy is slipping it in and that's
[2:31:38] items into your life and he's slipping
[2:31:41] items into your home amen until finally
[2:31:49] he becomes the idol and they worship in
[2:31:53] the church not the bride by the church
[2:31:58] and there are many Saints as I said well
[2:32:00] lay down their lives because they're not
[2:32:02] going to go along with that even though
[2:32:04] they identify with this and identify
[2:32:06] with that but they're they'll get out of
[2:32:08] it and that thing will kill us
[2:32:09] amen like those Christians are they
[2:32:12] killed in the in Egypt three or four
[2:32:14] months ago and the last words on their
[2:32:16] lips was the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:32:20] their faith was in the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:32:23] when they cut wind went as far as I know
[2:32:26] they were beheaded but they lay down
[2:32:28] their lives for Jesus are we gonna lay
[2:32:31] down our lives for Jesus brother every
[2:32:35] don't let don't let the devil make our
[2:32:37] prosperity idols so that I we're gonna
[2:32:40] focus on that dwell on that and morning
[2:32:43] noon and night
[2:32:44] we're just concerned over this and
[2:32:46] worried over that and thinking about
[2:32:48] this so thinking about of that forget it
[2:32:50] this too shall pass away you've heard
[2:32:57] the truth you've heard the say it the
[2:33:00] Lord yeah they're making idols I'd have
[2:33:08] one another they make idols that are
[2:33:10] their possessions and yes they made
[2:33:15] items out of the profit they made idols
[2:33:20] that in the cloud of angels they made
[2:33:26] items that of the pillar of fire they
[2:33:30] would make an idol and out of out of the
[2:33:32] altar of fire and remembering again the
[2:33:35] power of God said it if you look at that
[2:33:37] picture and you see anything he said
[2:33:40] other than that cloud that pillar of
[2:33:43] fire he said he says you're not seeing
[2:33:45] that issue should and it's idolatry
[2:33:48] it is it is idolatry because but he said
[2:33:52] he said he said you know what your
[2:33:54] problem is
[2:33:55] he said you don't know you you're not
[2:33:57] catching the revelation he said I am a
[2:34:00] son of man revealing the son of man but
[2:34:04] what are they mr. make mistake they
[2:34:07] called him the son of man and that
[2:34:10] brother that day that when he went when
[2:34:12] he went to the Pope at that time and he
[2:34:15] was preaching and on the revelation
[2:34:18] series the church changes I believe was
[2:34:20] and this brother punted this note in his
[2:34:23] pocket and he got up to the pulpit and
[2:34:26] opened up and said William Branham is my
[2:34:30] lord I know who the brother was and the
[2:34:36] prophet of God got up and rebuked it and
[2:34:37] he said he said you you he said you but
[2:34:40] you call me that he said that makes me
[2:34:41] Antichrist
[2:34:43] and he rebuked it but still even today
[2:34:47] they believe that when Ibrahim was the
[2:34:49] Lord they may be with him Branham was
[2:34:52] God he was God as you are God because he
[2:34:56] got he had God in him amen the baptism
[2:35:00] of the Holy Ghost but he was not as John
[2:35:03] 1:1 said in the beginning was the word
[2:35:05] and the Word was with God in the Word
[2:35:07] was God we were all with him but we were
[2:35:10] his we were we were his his sons and
[2:35:14] daughters in theophany form amen but but
[2:35:18] I bet the source of all power the source
[2:35:21] of all creation goes back to ethylene
[2:35:23] the self existing one praise the name of
[2:35:27] the Lord so again let's be warned let's
[2:35:32] reward
[2:35:33] don't let anything become an idol in
[2:35:34] your life you don't let your weight
[2:35:38] become an idol your husband make you
[2:35:40] become an idol your children become an
[2:35:42] island you don't let any of these things
[2:35:44] and today they make idols out of all of
[2:35:46] these things that's the truth brother
[2:35:49] amen
[2:35:50] whereas they allowed a man to what he's
[2:35:53] to what he was emphasizing tonight amen
[2:35:57] concerning idolatry as never before
[2:36:01] brother they never had it as as they got
[2:36:04] it in this I yes that's it we're trying
[2:36:08] to remember what about what about our
[2:36:10] brother said and the enemy is bringing
[2:36:13] all kinds of things into this world what
[2:36:15] for to give you an idol and to give this
[2:36:19] person Idol it's an idol to this one
[2:36:21] that's the night of that one that's a
[2:36:23] night on somebody else we're serving God
[2:36:26] come on God God is not going to overlook
[2:36:30] this and overlook that we think because
[2:36:32] we're good we're good answer God and God
[2:36:36] won't care this doesn't matter that it
[2:36:39] does matter because God knows the heart
[2:36:41] whether in the worth or not you really
[2:36:43] love
[2:36:43] whether or not you really want to serve
[2:36:45] Him a man God knows what's on the inside
[2:36:49] of the inside okay well you know if
[2:36:52] somebody can appear good outside but
[2:36:54] let's put them under the pressure and
[2:36:56] the stress of light of living for Jesus
[2:36:58] and see oh they're going to hack and
[2:36:59] react with that and somewhere some are
[2:37:03] gonna go home oh I can't take that I
[2:37:05] don't think I want me to take that to
[2:37:08] stand there I don't think God want me to
[2:37:09] go that way sure know what idiot nobody
[2:37:14] did
[2:37:15] I've not we end of it shows us that the
[2:37:20] scripture tells us to lay ourselves down
[2:37:22] as living sacrifices on the altar amen
[2:37:27] what I live worse that we live for Jesus
[2:37:30] amen and every live over Jesus is in the
[2:37:36] enemy is throwing all kinds of idols
[2:37:38] before us and he will make them appear
[2:37:41] to be all right they're fine and they'll
[2:37:43] serve this purpose they'll serve that
[2:37:45] purpose yeah like I talked about
[2:37:49] technology and I said I hate it yeah I
[2:37:55] hate it why because the more man gets
[2:37:58] into technology the further away from
[2:37:59] God he gets but we know that's where the
[2:38:03] prophet of God says science is taking
[2:38:05] them further with their knowledge than
[2:38:07] the churches with the word because God
[2:38:11] wants to get us away from that not to
[2:38:13] get me to put our attention on it
[2:38:14] don't fear people love it there are some
[2:38:17] people love it love it love it cast it
[2:38:22] into the fire and let it be burnt just
[2:38:26] listen when it comes to those things
[2:38:28] just get what you need nothing else just
[2:38:33] what you need now I want to keep up with
[2:38:36] this and keep up with that that's the
[2:38:38] devil
[2:38:40] amen the devil with his knowledge and
[2:38:45] all these things remember II said the
[2:38:47] brother God did say education and
[2:38:50] civilization is of the devil and it is
[2:38:55] because the more man gets caught up with
[2:38:57] that the further away from God he gets
[2:39:01] that's right because the enemy has got
[2:39:03] your attention God is there to get
[2:39:05] trying to get your attention
[2:39:08] hi brother Brendan brought out tonight
[2:39:10] he confirmed again
[2:39:12] what brother quotes are preached years
[2:39:14] or old there's a man in his 80s now and
[2:39:18] he ministered years ago I don't know
[2:39:21] where there or was on tape and he had no
[2:39:24] who was in it was in Tucson him brother
[2:39:28] greens assembly and he said he's talking
[2:39:32] about you got your hearing two voices
[2:39:34] calling your name and he said W if
[2:39:39] you're a Christian oh it's the voice of
[2:39:42] God I'll use David David David and you
[2:39:49] hear the voice of God but then the enemy
[2:39:51] comes around and learns your weaknesses
[2:39:53] and he'll say David but God says dead
[2:39:59] the enemy says David
[2:40:01] God says David and then if he says David
[2:40:07] he got your attention and you turned
[2:40:11] your back on God
[2:40:12] oh yeah
[2:40:16] grace no he said now one of the others
[2:40:19] gonna get your attention he said
[2:40:22] remember God never left you you left him
[2:40:30] and he's and the devil's out there and
[2:40:32] he's calling you get your checks into
[2:40:34] this get your attention to that did you
[2:40:36] tension something else
[2:40:38] it's the idols that our brothers
[2:40:42] ministered on tonight God give us the
[2:40:48] revelation so that we're going to do
[2:40:50] that the devil's voice is going to get
[2:40:52] lower and lower does get louder yes
[2:41:02] brother
[2:41:03] I agree we need a direct relationship
[2:41:08] with God
[2:41:13] and not a lot of the enemy to bring in
[2:41:16] the hydras of pleasure friends family
[2:41:21] job money no no dude many things
[2:41:26] everything out there whatever your
[2:41:29] weakness is you'll work on it to
[2:41:32] decrease your attention to the Lord and
[2:41:38] our brother again brought out the brass
[2:41:40] serpent became an idol ministers and
[2:41:46] Creed's become idols that's the truth
[2:41:51] ministers and doctrines they're making
[2:41:54] idols out of the doctrines gifts do
[2:41:59] become idols and that's why the angel of
[2:42:05] the Lord came down and told brother
[2:42:07] Branham he said brother Branham stop
[2:42:09] using those gifts he said because you're
[2:42:16] causing the people to lean on a signpost
[2:42:18] how true it was I could say amen brother
[2:42:23] Brendan and I tell you if you're
[2:42:27] listening to have listened to the tapes
[2:42:28] and you've heard them by the Holy Ghost
[2:42:30] you can say amen to what our brother
[2:42:33] said tonight that that's the truth that
[2:42:36] people got excited over nine today they
[2:42:39] were quiet when they're going to preach
[2:42:41] of the word but wonder when the signs
[2:42:45] and wonders begin to come into
[2:42:46] manifestation it wasn't quiet then but
[2:42:52] signs and wonders you can believe that
[2:42:54] and go to hell as you said you could be
[2:42:57] healed and go to hell that's right
[2:43:00] but you got to believe the word and be
[2:43:03] calmed or as he preached last night be
[2:43:08] the light be the light of God be the
[2:43:12] light of Christ in this world by the
[2:43:16] grace of God a man so grace to us that
[2:43:22] the word will find a resting place in
[2:43:24] our souls
[2:43:25] and the Holy Ghost will work on it to
[2:43:30] get us ready for the rapture and are
[2:43:33] going home to be with the Lord Jesus
[2:43:35] Christ amen
[2:43:37] and trusting as he finished with tonight
[2:43:41] that that we had come you I do believe
[2:43:54] in taking the natural communion some
[2:43:58] people don't but we do but it's a type
[2:44:03] of a spiritual communion oh yes the
[2:44:11] problem of God said the word the message
[2:44:14] he says going to throw us back to cut to
[2:44:17] Calvary and he said Calvary is going to
[2:44:20] throw us into the rapture so we want to
[2:44:23] take the communion but people sometimes
[2:44:28] will go to church take natural communion
[2:44:30] and that's it they're buying no no make
[2:44:33] sure that you will sit down and take the
[2:44:36] spiritual communion
[2:44:37] amen amen
[2:44:40] he eat the word the bread of the word of
[2:44:45] God and drink the wine of the simulation
[2:44:47] of the revelation by the grace of God
[2:44:51] heard not the oil or the wine the Holy
[2:44:56] Ghost bringing forth the word tonight
[2:44:57] and the wine to stimulate the revelation
[2:45:01] into your soul wonderful thank God for
[2:45:06] the word tonight hey man that was good
[2:45:11] idols stay away from idols also just
[2:45:20] before I finish sister Maureen that buys
[2:45:28] me that she had been talking to my email
[2:45:31] she had heard from sister Eileen reads
[2:45:35] in st. Lawrence and she expressed her
[2:45:41] desire to be here with us for all the
[2:45:43] fellowship but she's asked us to pray
[2:45:50] for her that she would have a closer
[2:45:55] walk with God good so I pray that you'll
[2:46:05] put it on your prayer list for our
[2:46:09] sister Eileen it's rare it's long long
[2:46:13] long time since he's being in here but
[2:46:18] we pray the grace of God to be with her
[2:46:20] and to help her pray the power of the
[2:46:23] Holy Ghost overshadow her give her the
[2:46:25] strength she needs a man to overcome
[2:46:29] well whether it's you know the influence
[2:46:33] a family or friends or might be some
[2:46:38] idols that our brother preached on
[2:46:40] tonight because there's none of us here
[2:46:42] there's not been influenced by idolatry
[2:46:46] in one form or another so the grace of
[2:46:50] God to be with us and help us and help
[2:46:52] the saints that are online and across
[2:46:54] the island and those that will hear this
[2:46:58] in in Africa and I don't know where else
[2:47:01] in the world that these DVDs will go so
[2:47:05] we pray the grace of God to each one we
[2:47:09] need to get closer to the Lord most
[2:47:12] definitely we got to get so close we
[2:47:15] become one with him and we gotta get so
[2:47:18] close that we have perfect faith to walk
[2:47:23] off the earth
[2:47:25] amen and God was taking us closer
[2:47:31] tonight by giving us the revelation of
[2:47:37] something that might have been holding
[2:47:40] some of us back trusting that we'll take
[2:47:45] it act on it and get closer to Christ
[2:47:49] also I have printed this before but I
[2:47:54] have printed it she just a few copies
[2:47:56] again outside and it is what Jesus
[2:48:00] thinks of the nuclear family what Jesus
[2:48:06] thinks not what you think
[2:48:08] now with us as human beings think not
[2:48:12] what the world thinks
[2:48:13] but what Jesus thinks of the nuclear
[2:48:16] family in this age what comes first in
[2:48:23] your life is it God or your family you
[2:48:27] can remember your family can become
[2:48:29] idols as well idolatry
[2:48:34] so I pray just if you got a copy home go
[2:48:38] back and read it again and some would
[2:48:43] maybe look at who wrote it and maybe
[2:48:45] wouldn't even consider reading it
[2:48:48] because they would say oh well he's not
[2:48:50] a he's not a believer he belongs to this
[2:48:54] church of that church well you never
[2:48:56] know he might be there God knows because
[2:49:01] he spoke the truth and this was an
[2:49:04] editorial in the magazine of the church
[2:49:07] that he belonged to I want my own one
[2:49:10] mention of those names but he wrote this
[2:49:13] as an editorial as a public witness he
[2:49:16] took his stand I pray God will take our
[2:49:20] state
[2:49:21] because if not he'll rise in judgment
[2:49:25] against us amen
[2:49:27] what Jesus thinks of the nuclear family
[2:49:31] god bless you amen
[2:49:34] I want to sing the song which the
[2:49:42] prophet of God said that we're going to
[2:49:44] hear him sing when we get to the other
[2:49:51] side
[2:49:52] he said you're here some man down there
[2:49:57] sitting under a tree it's the same
[2:50:01] Amazing Race he said you can say oh
[2:50:07] brother bet I made it he's gonna sing
[2:50:13] he said Amazing Grace and it is amazing
[2:50:17] grace if any one out of this generation
[2:50:21] in this age with all the idolatry around
[2:50:24] if anyone escapes and makes it into the
[2:50:27] rapture as a living Saint it's the grace
[2:50:31] of God our brother Branham told our
[2:50:38] brother Levi oh he's her brother most of
[2:50:42] the older folks around this message will
[2:50:44] go by way of the grade he said they
[2:50:49] won't be here for the rapture for the
[2:50:51] change they were not ordained or
[2:50:54] predestinated onto rapturing faith but
[2:50:57] there's a generation he said that would
[2:50:59] be predestinated ordained to rupturing
[2:51:01] paint and he said we got to come to a
[2:51:04] perfect faith for the rapture and then
[2:51:07] of course he said you young ministers he
[2:51:11] said you're ordained to take this
[2:51:13] message on to the coming of the Lord
[2:51:16] well I was quite young back then in my
[2:51:21] late teens
[2:51:24] brother Brendan I don't know I don't
[2:51:26] think he was born but again identified
[2:51:31] as a young minister with a tremendous
[2:51:35] responsibility to take them that take
[2:51:40] the message in such a way ministered in
[2:51:42] such a way to the people is to take us
[2:51:45] on to the rapture and the change by the
[2:51:49] grace of God remember what we're waiting
[2:51:53] to happen
[2:51:56] he explained that he said the dead in
[2:51:59] Christ is going to appear to us the
[2:52:02] living Saints were going to be changed
[2:52:04] instantly cut into that dimension with
[2:52:07] them and then he said after a space time
[2:52:13] we call the time will be an eternity he
[2:52:17] said we'll look up at that pillar of
[2:52:20] fire will have incarnated in the body
[2:52:24] called Jesus and he said he'll be
[2:52:27] descending in the cloud to receive us
[2:52:31] unto himself and will rise he said to
[2:52:37] meet Jesus so that he's not history
[2:52:44] he's our present reality not I was I am
[2:52:49] I pray God that Christ is not I was our
[2:52:55] loss or was he as I am and then let's
[2:53:03] same amazing grace that was manifested
[2:53:05] in Christ
[2:53:06] revealing Christ as now it's revealed in
[2:53:10] your life and mine by the grace of God
[2:53:12] wishing it and I'm going to turn it over
[2:53:15] to our brother Bob Amazing Grace
