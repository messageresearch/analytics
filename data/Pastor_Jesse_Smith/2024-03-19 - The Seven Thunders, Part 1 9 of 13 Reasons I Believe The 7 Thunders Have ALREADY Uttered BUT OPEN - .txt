TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] something happened the other day you read the or heard the tape the seven Thunders what time is it sir it happened the other day greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a question I was asked do I believe the seven Thunders have already been uttered or do I believe the seven Thunders will be revealed in the future my current understanding is that the seven Thunders have already uttered through the ministry of God's Prophet brother William brandham and each Thunder was a revelation of each of the Seven Seals so when brother Randon preached the revelation of the first seal that was the first Thunder and so forth all the way down to the seventh seal hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio we're coming up on our 18th year anniversary by the grace of God and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 and I defend brother bram's Godly Christian character I want to begin by saying I respect the people that believe the seven Thunders will be revealed in the future but my personal conviction is that the seven Thunders have already uttered their voices through the ministry of God's Prophet brother brandham so this video is to share my current understanding on the seven Thunders I'm not taking a stand against anyone I'm not bashing anyone who doesn't agree with me because I'm open to the Future possibility of God uttering the seven Thunders but it seems like to me based upon nine reasons that the seven Thunders have already uttered their voices and friends I'm probably up to 13 Reasons now that I believe the Thunders have already been uttered by God's grace of course I'm recording this portion of the video 3 days after I recorded this first part of the video so Lord willing there definitely be a part two on this topic of the seven Thunders I might even make a third part and just show all the reasons why the seven Thunders could be a future Revelation given to a prophet as brother Ram said in the church age book The Seven Thunders have to come through a Prophet by God's grace I preached on this subject questions and answers on the Thunders two days ago would have been March 17th 2024 so I'll leave a link to that in the description by God's grace so Lord willing there will be a part two the reason I respect the other side that believes the Thunders will be revealed in the future is because I found probably around 10 quotes where brother random says the Thunders will be revealed right at the time of the Rapture and there's also a vision related to it in the seventh seal sermon from March of 1963 brother R talks about a vision he had of the seventh seal there was three folds to it the first fold was the seven Thunders and then he didn't know the last two folds he said one was even in an unknown language so that's why I respect the side that I don't agree with because I believe the Thunders have already uttered but I do respect the other side so I have this conviction that the Thunders already utter their voices because of nine solid reasons and I know the other side says they have quotes and they have a vision about it but one important thing to know is that there's seven quotes after brother Randon preached the seventh seal that make me believe brother brandham believed that the seven Thunders had already been uttered and of course that's very convincing to me I've also told our church that I believe if the Thunders would be revealed in the future we would receive it because we're constantly hungry and thirsting after more righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ as brother Ram said we should pray for Revelation more than anything and I believe we do that when we pray for the will of God every day every day we pray let thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven forgive us our sins help us to forgive those who've sinned against us as we daily seek first the kingdom of God in his righteousness I believe the Lord would reveal those Thunders to us because we're seeking the Lord's face every day and of course I believe we're still waiting for the latter rain I do not believe the latter rain has fallen yet because brother brandom called the latter rain rapturing faith in the church age book and no one in the Gentile dispensation has been raptured yet so we're still waiting on the Rapture brother Brandon said thus sayith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride before the Rapture Joel 2: 23- 26 so our church and numerous other churches are looking for the latter rain or rapturing faith it is promised to us with thus sayith the Lord in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord it is thus saith the Lord for that is what Joel 2 23-26 says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten the cankerworms and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be [Music] ashamed and also in the church age book brother brand said the seven Thunders had to come by a prophet and brother Ram was using scriptures about his own Ministry Revelation 10:7 Malachi 45 and6 so if a prophet did rise up and gave the revelation of the seven Thunders we would recognize it because we already know how to recognize a prophet according to the Bible just like we recognize brother brandham as a genuine Prophet what was in those Thunders no one knows but we need to know and it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet the word always came by a prophet and always will so Lord willing I'm just going to make this video a little shorter I'm just going to go through the nine reasons I believe the Thunders have already uttered and of course they are the revelations of the Seven Seals Lord willing if people make comments on this video I'll make a part two and I can go through all the quotes brother brandom said about the seven Thunders here's a visual at this point I found 51 quotes that say seven Thunders there's one quote that says seven Thunder and there's 27 other quotes that say seven mysterious Thunders or have some other combination of the words seven and Thunders so it was basically about 70 quotes about the seven Thunders and of course there could be more by God's grace okay so reason number one brother brandom said seven times that the seven Thunders were already fulfilled revealed or history and all these quotes were after he preached the seventh seal sermon from March of 1963 and I'll briefly read these the first one was God hiding himself in Simplicity in Albuquerque he said you read or heard the tape the seven Thunders what time is it sir see it happened the other day so there he said it happened the other day let's listen to the quote something happened the other day you read the I heard the tape the seven Thunders what time is it sir it happened the other day know these things the time is at hand Church the time is at hand don't don't don't wait any longer see the second one was from the previous day the world is falling apart in Albuquerque brother Bram said in the Seven Seals were opened at the Tabernacle the other day so if the Seven Seals were opened and brother Ram said he gave us the revelation of them with thus say the Lord then that Revelation was the seven Thunders uttering their voices so this is a second quote let's listen to the quote what it goes we turn back the Seven Seals were opened at the Tabernacle the other day I seen people coming from standing there 3:00 in the morning and get a place to get into the auditorium and so forth see the hungry Hearts coming from everywhere I thought oh God we're bound to be at the end now remember the sounding of the seventh angel the mysteries of God was finished and there come an angel from heaven and swore with his hands raised from Heaven Revelations 10 1-7 the time would be no more exactly right the hour what church is he coming to Now The Vision Plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the Revelation the interpretation thereof is thus sayeth the Lord a third quote is from Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother BR said that he spoke of it here and showed those seven Thunders so brother Ram said the seven Thunders were showed let's listen to the quote but in the last days the reason that was such a tremendous thing that he spoke of ear and showed those seven Thunders and look life My Life magazine and packed that circle of of cloud and light there that they could not understand and don't know it yet but here telling go there and wait for these Mysteries to be revealed and he months before it happened and then it happened exactly the way he said it would do did you notice in that picture even that Rangel on the right when he's being materialized come the fourth quote is from the unveiling of God brother brand said them seven Thunders it's all revealed in there and the Seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was that's what it was see it's still in the word and notice he says that's what it was it was revealed it was opened all three of those are past tense let's listen to the quote and he said well then then seven Thunders you see said what them seven Thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation be given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was am see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and Open the Eyes of others it'll always do that the fifth quote is questions and answers part four 1964 brother BR was directly asked about the seven Thunders and he said they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about let's listen to the quote have the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the seven Thunders had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he's forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church age the fifth quote is from what is the attraction on the mountain July 25th 1965 evening brother Bram said what's happened upon Mount Sunset God fulfilling Revelation 10 1-7 so of course the Thunder verses are verses 10 3 and 4 and brother R said they were fulfilled he said said 3 years ago this was a mystery and a prophecy but now it's history it's past God fulfilling his word so brother Ram says Revelation 10 1-7 is fulfilled it's history it's ped let's listen to the quote what's happened up on Mount Sunset God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age St Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed and the god of Heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir but now it's history it's passed the promise is fulfilled what time is it Ser what's this attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever let us pray and then lastly in the church AG book brother Ram said the messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things he's going to turn the hearts according to Malachi 4 and second he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals let's listen to the quote now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so the second reason I believe the Thunders have already uttered is brother brandom never mentioned the seven seal Vision with the threefolds after he preached the seven seal sermon so this makes me think brother random realized the vision was already fulfilled and he knew that the Thunders were the revelations of the Seven Seals and if I'm wrong on that if there is another quote or more quotes on that seventh seal Vision please let me know by God's grace I'll correct my understanding on that the third reason I believe the Thunders are already uttered is when asked directly about it in 1964 questions and answers part for brother random said they were already revealed we've already heard that quote so I'm not going to spend any more time on that have the seven Thunder ERS which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about they was to reveal the seven Thunders that uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he's forbidden to write he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church age the fourth reason I believe the Thunder is already revealed is because brother brandham put that in print in the church age book that the Thunders were the revelations contained in the Seven Seals and brother brandom said on tape he read the book through a few times and then his daughter Rebecca said she read it to him numerous times as well so clearly if brother brandom read it through a few times and heard it himself a few times then he definitely knew the content in the book pretty well was pretty familiar with it he would not have been surprised about that chapter the L scene chapter chapter n because it was about him as being the messenger and lale of course would have known that brother Brandon was the messenger to the leene church age so brother Randon was probably most likely very familiar with that portion on the seventh thund ERS so let's listen to the quote where brother random said he read it through a few times now does anyone in here know Dr Le I don't think maybe not he is a Baptist preacher doctor of divinity and he got his degrees he was a high school teacher to begin with and he's a very fine scholarly man in my tapes of the seven Church ages I sent them to him to grammar IE them because my Kentucky hit ha and tote and carry and fetch that don't go good for people who read some books so he was going to grammar IE it for him and then after he got through sent it back a couple times for more statements which the book is going to press now after about 3 4 years he the fifth reason I believe the Thunders have already uttered is that if the Thunders aren't revealed then our hearts are not turn back to the apostolic fathers and of course I'm basing this on the quote from the church age book chapter n and friends if our hearts aren't turned to the fathers of the faith like Peter Paul James and John then where are our hearts turned to who have we turned our hearts to if our hearts are not towards Paul Peter James and John and it seems from the Bible you can only have your heart in one of two places or in one of two conditions you either have a Heart of Stone which would be a sinner's heart or you can have a heart of Flesh that the Holy Spirit can write his word upon the fleshly tables of our hearts so basically the fifth reason is I believe the Thunders have uttered because my heart is turned back to the Gospel of Jesus Christ that he gave to St Paul James John Peter and all the New Testament writers the sixth reason is from Revelation 6 verse1 it says a thunder sounded at the first seal and to me this proves each seal had a thunder even though Revelation 6 doesn't say each seal has a thunder but to me there had to be a thunder for each seal or else there were eight Thunders because there is one thunder in Revelation 61 and then there's seven more thunders in Revelation 10 verses 3 and 4 so I believe there's only seven Thunders and not eight Thunders so that means the first Thunder of Revelation 61 in the first seal was also one of the seven Thunders that was uttered in Revelation 10: 3 and 4 the seventh reason I believe the Thunders are already uttered is because there's no thus sayith the Lord's statement from Brother brandom on a future opening of the seven Thunders now I also understand there's no thus say the Lord for my current conviction as well so I just want to be humble and say neither side has a thus sayith the Lord so we just need to lean upon the holy ghost and draw as close to God as we possibly can to receive any further Revelation he'll give us before the Rapture by the grace of God and as I stated earlier yes I do understand there's a vision about the seventh seal and seven Thunders onefold of it but again brother Bram never mentioned this Vision after preaching the seventh seal sermon so to me it seems like it was revealed to him that the seven Thunders had already uttered when he preached the Seven Seals the eighth reason I believe the Thunders already uttered is because if the seven Thunders haven't uttered and there's still a mystery then Revelation 10:7 is not fulfilled the Bible said in Revelation 10:7 the seventh angel finishes all the mystery of God and remember friend brother random said Revelation 101:7 is history he said it's already fulfilled but if we say there's a mysterious seven Thunders to come then the mysteries of God are not finished and I believe that kind of belief opens up itself for a lot of false doctrines to come in such as then we still need a seventh angel messenger or we need brother brandom to physically return which I do not believe is going to happen so I believe the most logical explanation is that the revelation of the Seven Seals were the uttering of the seven Thunders and Ninth and finally the ninth reason I believe the Thunders have already uttered because of the order of Revelation 10 in verses 1 to 7 The Mighty Angel comes down has an open book Seven Thunders utter their voices and then the seventh angel finishes the mystery of God which I believe was brother bram's Ministry then in verses 8- 11 John eats the book and takes it to every gentile people and I believe that's exactly what what's happened since brother Randon went off the scene 59 years ago the real Holy Ghost filled Saints have eaten the revelations of the Bible and taking it around the world by God's grace in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by God's grace as I said one of the Saints asked me about my understanding on the seven Thunders and so I took time numerous hours these last few days and read through all the quotes I could find on the seven Thunders and I wanted to make a video to all our viewers to help them as well and of course help the individual who asked the question this is a great topic to study it's all about the rapture we all want to be ready for the rapture we want to be the wise virgin who's got oil ready we want to be the people with the wedding garment on the righteousness of Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost friends I told our church that I believe it's just like God to give us something to study and pray about what I mean by that is there's no thus say the Lord's statement about the Thunders whether they're already uttered or or they'll be in the future so it's as if God gave us something to pray about seek his face about and the Bible said it's the honor of Kings to search out of matter in the Book of Proverbs and it's shame and Folly for someone to answer matter before they hear all of it and of course remember the bans searched the Scriptures Daily because they were more noble so it's the desire of Holy Ghost filled Christians to have that spiritual nobility to search the scriptures every day by God's grace listen to the quotes from brother brandham and right divide the word of Truth by the Holy Ghost remember Deuteronomy 29:29 says these secret things belong to God and now they belong to us and our children that we might do all the words of the law of God and of course for us that's the law of the Holy Spirit here in the New Testament by the grace of God according to the Book of Romans chapter 8 so Lord willing we'll see if our viewers want a part two or not we can go through all the quotes maybe not all I mean but the most important quotes by God's grace out of those 70 quotes or so the majority of the quotes are in two sermons 13 of them are in s this the end time December 1962 and then eight of them are in the seventh seal from March of 1963 friends let's draw nigh to God and God will surely draw nigh to us no man knows the day or the hour of the Rapture but we want to be ready Jesus numerous times implored his people watch and be ready so we are the children of the day we're not the children of the night we won't be overtaken Aken by the Great Tribulation like a thief in the night we are the children of the day we have our eyes open we can spiritually see the movement of the Antichrist we can also see the empowering of the Holy Ghost in the bride and of course saints were promised a pardon from the wrath of God according to first Thessalonians chapter 5 if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
