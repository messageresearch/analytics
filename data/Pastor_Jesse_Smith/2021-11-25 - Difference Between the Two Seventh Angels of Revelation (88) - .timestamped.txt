[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the lord jesus christ
[0:10] recently i was asked a great question
[0:12] and i'd like to share both the question
[0:14] and answer with you what is the
[0:16] difference between the two seventh
[0:18] angels in the book of revelation the
[0:21] answer is one of the seventh angels
[0:23] has an earthly ministry and the other
[0:26] has a heavenly ministry
[0:28] the question of course refers to the
[0:30] seventh angel of revelation chapter 10
[0:32] verse 7 and the other seventh angel of
[0:36] revelation 11 15
[0:38] which is the same angel also in
[0:40] revelation 16 verse 17.
[0:43] here's the three scriptures in question
[0:46] the first angel is revelation 10 7 but
[0:48] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[0:50] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[0:52] mystery of god should be finished as he
[0:54] hath declared to his servants the
[0:55] prophets
[0:57] the second seventh angel is in both
[0:59] revelation 11 15 and 16 verse 17
[1:04] and the seventh angel sounded and there
[1:06] were great voices in heaven saying the
[1:08] kingdoms of this world are become the
[1:10] kingdoms of our lord and of his christ
[1:13] and he shall reign forever and ever
[1:15] revelation 16 verse 17 and the seventh
[1:18] angel poured out of his vile into the
[1:20] air and there came a great voice out of
[1:22] the temple of heaven from the throne
[1:25] saying it is done
[1:27] some might believe these two seventh
[1:29] angels are the same person
[1:31] an earthly preacher brother branham who
[1:34] first ministered on earth in revelation
[1:36] 10 verse 7 and then ministers for god in
[1:39] heaven
[1:40] in revelation 11 and chapter 16.
[1:43] while i agree revelation 10 7 was
[1:45] brother branham i can't see any biblical
[1:48] pattern of god using a saved soul in
[1:50] heaven to pour out his judgments upon
[1:53] earth
[1:54] but rather we see god using literal holy
[1:57] angels not save men's souls to fulfill
[2:00] his judgments such as in the days of
[2:02] david from the old testament and also
[2:04] herod in the new testament
[2:07] second samuel 24 verse 17 says and david
[2:10] spake unto the lord when he saw the
[2:12] angel that smote the people
[2:15] acts 12 verses 21 and 23 say and upon a
[2:18] set day herod arrayed in royal apparel
[2:21] sat upon his throne and made an oration
[2:23] unto them verse 23 and immediately the
[2:26] angel of the lord smote him because he
[2:28] gave not god the glory
[2:31] there is one quote from brother branham
[2:32] i found that agrees with my
[2:34] understanding of this subject
[2:36] in this quote brother branham says the
[2:38] seventh angel messenger is different
[2:40] from the seventh trumpet angel
[2:43] of course there could be more quotes on
[2:45] this subject that i haven't seen so
[2:47] please let me know if you found some i
[2:49] haven't seen but let's listen to the
[2:50] quote
[2:53] says the seventh angel's message
[2:57] that's right at the seven trumpets
[2:59] and there's seven angels going seven
[3:01] trumpets that's what we're coming to
[3:03] next but remember
[3:05] rare very specifically it said the
[3:08] angels not the seventh angels trumpet
[3:10] but the seventh angel's message empty
[3:14] not the trumpet angel the message angel
[3:17] they were the angel only son of the
[3:19] trumpet that seventh angel the trumpet
[3:21] angel but then said in the days of the
[3:23] message of the seventh angel name when
[3:25] his message is finished see that's the
[3:27] church age message and this time then he
[3:30] will
[3:40] the reason the two seventh angels are
[3:42] different
[3:43] there are two sets of seven angels in
[3:46] the book of revelation one group is
[3:48] earthly and the other is heavenly
[3:51] the scriptural context of both seventh
[3:54] angels prove one seventh angel is
[3:57] sounding on earth during the times of
[3:59] the gentiles that jesus defined in luke
[4:02] 21 24
[4:04] to finish the great commission
[4:06] while the second seventh angel is
[4:08] sounding in heaven during the great
[4:10] tribulation or the seventieth and final
[4:12] week of daniel's 70 weeks
[4:14] also known as jacob's trouble
[4:17] the first set of the earthly seven
[4:19] angels
[4:21] revelation chapters two and three
[4:23] mentions seven angels from seven gentile
[4:26] cities that jesus christ tells john to
[4:28] write to and share his divine messages
[4:31] with
[4:32] these seven angels are human messengers
[4:35] as i also taught in my 2021 book the 12
[4:38] new testament mysteries revealed on
[4:40] pages 409 and 410
[4:43] here's a summary of the five reasons the
[4:45] seven angels in revelation chapters two
[4:48] and three are human preachers
[4:51] the first proof is found in revelation
[4:53] two verse one
[4:54] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[4:56] wright
[4:58] why would jesus tell john to author a
[5:00] handwritten letter to a heavenly angel
[5:03] at ephesus
[5:04] god doesn't have to write letters to
[5:06] heavenly angels
[5:07] god just speaks directly to heavenly
[5:09] angels
[5:10] and sends them from his throne to
[5:13] minister to believers who shall be heirs
[5:15] of salvation
[5:17] the truth is jesus was assigning john to
[5:19] write to an earthly man at ephesus
[5:22] who would preserve the letter for
[5:24] upcoming generations to whom it would
[5:26] also apply to
[5:28] second the seven angels are symbolic of
[5:30] human preachers because men are
[5:32] sometimes referred to as angels in
[5:34] scripture
[5:35] the hebrew definition of angel is
[5:37] messenger and jesus appropriately calls
[5:39] john the baptist god's messenger in
[5:42] matthew 11 verse 12.
[5:44] the prophet david is twice called an
[5:46] angel of god in first samuel 29 verse 9
[5:50] and 2nd samuel 19 27
[5:52] paul says the galatians received him as
[5:54] an angel of god even as christ jesus in
[5:58] galatians 4 verse 14.
[6:00] a final witness is revelation 22 verses
[6:02] 8 and 9 as the angel sent to john to
[6:06] show him the prophecies was actually a
[6:08] fellow servant of his a prophet who kept
[6:11] the sayings of revelation
[6:13] a third fact is that god uses men to
[6:16] save men
[6:17] angels assist men but men are god's
[6:20] primary tool for sharing his way to
[6:22] salvation
[6:23] romans 10 verse 14 says how shall they
[6:25] hear without a preacher
[6:27] mark 16 verse 20 explains jesus's
[6:30] disciples preached everywhere the lord
[6:33] working with them and confirming the
[6:35] word with signs following
[6:37] so we see jesus used men to save men
[6:42] fourth notice the location of these
[6:43] stars or seven angels
[6:45] because revelation chapter 1 says these
[6:48] seven angels were in the hand of jesus
[6:50] christ
[6:52] both moses and jesus defined god's right
[6:54] hand as his power and authority and this
[6:57] power and authority is strictly reserved
[6:59] for christ
[7:00] and not angels according to hebrews 1
[7:02] verse 13.
[7:04] but jesus promised men would inherit
[7:06] god's power and authority to witness his
[7:08] resurrection in numerous scriptures
[7:12] lastly abraham's seed or faith-filled
[7:14] humans are referred to as stars in
[7:17] genesis 15 verse 5.
[7:20] daniel 12 3 likens the saved and soul
[7:23] winners to stars saying and they that be
[7:26] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[7:28] the firmament.
[7:30] and they that turn many to righteousness
[7:32] as the stars forever and ever
[7:35] john the baptist god's messenger is
[7:37] likened unto a star a burning light in
[7:40] john 5 35. he was a burning and a
[7:43] shining light and ye were willing for a
[7:46] season to rejoice in his light
[7:49] by god's grace the holy ghost has
[7:51] revealed the human identities of these
[7:53] seven earthly angels who are the
[7:55] messengers to the seven church ages
[7:58] paul irenaeus martin columba martin
[8:02] luther john wesley and william branham
[8:05] this would mean that the seventh angel
[8:06] of revelation 10 verse 7 is the same
[8:09] seventh angel to the church of laodicea
[8:12] in revelation 3 verse 14 who again was
[8:15] the late reverend william branham
[8:18] the context of revelation chapter 10.
[8:22] next the context of revelation 10 verse
[8:24] 7
[8:25] and verse 11 specifically shows the
[8:27] gentiles are still in need of prophecy
[8:30] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[8:32] again before many peoples and nations
[8:34] and tongues and kings
[8:37] notice how many peoples nations tongues
[8:40] and kings
[8:41] not few
[8:42] need to hear the revelations of the
[8:44] little book or the revelations of the
[8:46] seven seals as seen from revelation
[8:48] chapters 4 5 6 and 8.
[8:52] this means jesus's great commission to
[8:54] all nations or all gentile peoples is
[8:57] not yet fulfilled as matthew 28 verse 19
[9:01] and 20 declare
[9:02] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[9:04] baptizing them in the name of the father
[9:06] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[9:09] teaching them to observe all things
[9:10] whatsoever i commanded you and lo i am
[9:13] with you alway even unto the end of the
[9:15] earth amen
[9:18] so the context of revelation chapter 10
[9:20] shows god is still dealing with gentiles
[9:23] notice also that prophecy always
[9:26] prospers believers we see this in ezra 6
[9:30] 14
[9:31] and the elders of the jews builded and
[9:33] they prospered through the prophesying
[9:35] of haggai the prophet and zachariah the
[9:38] son of ido
[9:40] according to romans chapter 11 the jews
[9:42] are currently the branch broken off from
[9:44] god
[9:45] who likens himself to a holy tree
[9:48] please read the whole chapter of romans
[9:49] 11 for the full context
[9:52] but paul warns that god is going to
[9:54] graft israel back into god's promises
[9:57] just as a man would graft a branch back
[9:59] into a tree
[10:01] but this happens after god cuts off the
[10:03] gentiles or wild branch according to
[10:06] romans 11 verse 17 and verse 24
[10:10] when jesus christ raptures the holy
[10:12] ghost filled gentiles before the great
[10:14] tribulation the rest of the gentiles who
[10:16] rejected the holy ghost baptism are cut
[10:19] off
[10:20] so there is no more ministry no more
[10:22] grace and no more prophecy to the
[10:24] gentiles
[10:25] this is what revelation 22 verse 11
[10:28] declares
[10:29] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[10:32] still and he which is filthy let him be
[10:34] filthy still and he that is righteous
[10:36] let him be righteous still and he that
[10:38] is holy let him be holy still
[10:42] the time for all nations to receive the
[10:44] prophecy of the new testament in the
[10:46] great commission is what jesus called
[10:48] the time of the gentiles in luke 21 24
[10:52] and they shall fall by the edge of the
[10:53] sword and shall be led away captive into
[10:56] all nations and jerusalem shall be
[10:58] trodden down to the gentiles until the
[11:00] times of the gentiles be fulfilled
[11:04] the second set of the heavenly seven
[11:07] angels
[11:09] revelation chapters 8 9 11
[11:12] 15 16 and even two scriptures in
[11:15] revelation 17 and chapter 21
[11:18] mention the second set of heavenly
[11:21] angels
[11:22] it's my humble opinion the seven angels
[11:24] with the seven trumpets are the same
[11:26] heavenly angels who pour out the seven
[11:29] vows but i could be wrong on that and
[11:31] i'm open to correction
[11:33] the first mention of the heavenly
[11:35] seventh angel is revelation 11 15 and
[11:39] the context shows the jewish temple
[11:41] already built
[11:42] which means the times of the gentiles is
[11:44] over as the gentiles were cut off and
[11:47] the jewish branch was grafted back into
[11:49] the holy tree as previously explained in
[11:52] romans 11.
[11:53] the first woe is poured out in
[11:55] revelation 11
[11:56] so this cannot be the times of the
[11:58] gentiles the gentile bride is spared
[12:00] from the wrath of god
[12:02] according to first thessalonians 1 verse
[12:04] 10
[12:05] and 1st thessalonians 5 verse 9 and
[12:08] revelation 3 verse 11
[12:11] and to wait for a son from heaven whom
[12:13] he raised from the dead even jesus which
[12:15] delivered us from the wrath to come
[12:18] for god hath not appointed us to wrath
[12:21] but to obtain salvation by our lord
[12:23] jesus christ
[12:25] because thou hast kept the word of my
[12:26] patience i also will keep thee from the
[12:28] hour of temptation which will come upon
[12:31] all the world to try them that dwell
[12:33] upon the earth
[12:35] revelation 11 verse 15 shows the context
[12:38] of the sounding of the seventh angel is
[12:40] in heaven
[12:41] revelation 11 verse 18 shows it's the
[12:44] time of wrath not of grace mercy and
[12:47] prophecy to the gentiles
[12:49] moving to revelation chapter 16 verse 17
[12:52] the context is the pouring out of the
[12:54] seven vials in god's wrath
[12:57] this means the 144 000 jews are already
[13:00] sealed in their foreheads by the baptism
[13:02] of the holy ghost as seen in revelation
[13:05] 7 verses 1 through 8
[13:07] notice verse 3 in chapter 7 which says
[13:10] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[13:12] sea nor the trees to we have sealed the
[13:15] servants of our god in their foreheads
[13:18] did you notice the trees cannot be hurt
[13:21] until the 144 000 are sealed with the
[13:24] holy ghost baptism
[13:26] then read revelation 8 verse 7 and see
[13:29] how a third of the trees are burnt
[13:31] during the first trumpet so this proves
[13:34] the 144 thousand jews are sealed by
[13:36] christ's spirit before the wrath of the
[13:39] trumpets begins to sound
[13:42] revelation 8 verse 7 says the first
[13:44] angels sounded and their foul hail and
[13:46] fire mingle with blood
[13:48] and they were cast upon the earth and
[13:50] the third part of the trees was burned
[13:52] up and all green grass was burned up
[13:56] friends the great tribulation judgments
[13:59] start under the seven trumpets in
[14:01] revelation chapter eight
[14:03] this proves god is already done with the
[14:05] gentiles when these trumpets are blown
[14:07] as there's no more mercy for the
[14:08] gentiles and that he already filled the
[14:11] 144 000 jews with the holy ghost and now
[14:14] it's time for divine judgment and wrath
[14:17] upon the earth
[14:19] in closing
[14:20] i hope this video was a blessing and i
[14:22] hope by the grace of god you're now able
[14:24] to see the difference between the two
[14:26] seventh angels the one is earthly
[14:28] brother branham and the other is
[14:30] heavenly a literal angel
[14:33] if you have any questions concerns or
[14:35] testimonies about this video please
[14:37] contact me
[14:40] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[14:42] the desire of your heart
