[0:00] listen
[0:01] brother you're never saved by any
[0:05] sign you're never saved by any sensation
[0:09] you're saved when you meet God's
[0:12] condition of his word and nothing else
[0:15] are you saved
[0:17] by right God's word has made a way
[0:21] you're not saved because you feel like
[0:23] you're saved I'm not saved because I
[0:25] feel like I'm saved because a lot of
[0:27] times I don't feel that
[0:28] way but I'm saved because God gave the
[0:34] promise I met God's conditions enough on
[0:37] God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven
[0:41] days in a week and as many
[0:44] nights because it's God's word he that
[0:47] Hearth my word and believeth on him that
[0:50] sent me has everlasting life and shall
[0:52] not come to judgment but pass and death
[0:54] to
[0:55] life that's what the King of Kings said
[0:59] you believe it
[1:01] if you believe not if you shout not if
[1:03] you run them things are all right but
[1:06] you're trying to base to make a Doctrine
[1:09] out of it and even on Divine Healing
[1:11] you're making a Doctrine and Divine
[1:14] Healing is a minor how can the church
[1:17] ever major on a
[1:21] minor ask that question and than it over
[1:24] it's a mixed
[1:26] multitude it's a multitude that's the
[1:28] reason friends let me tell you you
[1:30] something two weeks ago there's man
[1:33] sitting here looking at me right now was
[1:34] in the meeting in Li Ohio where I had
[1:38] the Methodist the Baptist and the
[1:41] Presbyterian and some Nazarene Salvation
[1:44] Army all sponsor my meeting in a great
[1:47] big Auditorium they're standing on the
[1:51] word and proving by the word the Lord
[1:54] Jesus and the real gospel things that
[1:56] was to take place and night after night
[1:59] hundred of them walk down to the altar
[2:02] giving their hearts to Christ upon not a
[2:04] sensation upon the word let me tell you
[2:08] something brother now I want you to
[2:10] listen quiet and as I close on
[2:14] this I am firmly believing
[2:17] this and I say this not knowing whether
[2:20] I live to see daylight or
[2:22] not but there is a supernatural has been
[2:25] done that's true but you're going wild
[2:28] with it you're going on the deep end
[2:31] with it the devil's pushing you off with
[2:34] it you got come out of the Bible
[2:36] now I believe in the Supernatural I
[2:40] believe in Jesus Christ I believe he's
[2:42] the same yesterday today and forever and
[2:44] does the same things that he did
[2:46] yesterday and will forever that's right
[2:49] I believe
[2:53] that
