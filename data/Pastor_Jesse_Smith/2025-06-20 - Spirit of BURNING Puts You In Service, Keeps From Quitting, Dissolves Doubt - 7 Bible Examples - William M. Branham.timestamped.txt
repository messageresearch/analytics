[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] That's always God's judgment. When he
[0:05] makes his final judgment, calls you,
[0:06] justifies you, brings you to redemption,
[0:09] then his judgment breaks forth upon you,
[0:11] and the Holy Ghost and fire cleanses
[0:13] away the sin, then you're his. Same
[0:15] thing he does to the earth when he
[0:16] purges it with fire and by the spirit of
[0:21] burning and by the spirit of burning.
[0:26] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:30] this video is to show the spirit of
[0:32] burning throughout the Bible. It's a
[0:35] fresh revelation that came to me earlier
[0:37] this year and I preached about eight
[0:38] sermons about it and the people really
[0:42] enjoyed it by the grace of God. This
[0:44] series showed the cleansing, renewing
[0:47] and filling power of the Holy Ghost. So
[0:51] the origin of this series was I was just
[0:53] reading through the Bible as I always
[0:55] do. I was reading through the book of
[0:56] Isaiah 4:4 and I came upon this verse.
[1:00] It says, "When the Lord shall have
[1:01] washed away the filth of the daughters
[1:03] of Zion and shall have purged the blood
[1:05] of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by
[1:08] the spirit of judgment and by the spirit
[1:11] of burning."
[1:13] And when I read that, those words just
[1:15] stood out. The spirit of judgment and
[1:17] the spirit of burning. And then as I
[1:19] preached this series, I saw how the
[1:21] spirit of judgment is kind of like the
[1:22] first work of grace. We've got to judge
[1:24] ourselves that we're worthy of eternal
[1:26] life. The Bible said in the book of Acts
[1:29] that the Jews judge themselves unworthy
[1:32] of eternal life or everlasting life. And
[1:35] so we have to judge ourselves as we're
[1:37] unworthy and Jesus Christ is worthy. And
[1:40] then the spirit of burning comes upon
[1:42] us. It makes us a new creature in Christ
[1:45] Jesus. So the spirit of burning, the
[1:47] spirit of God is likened unto fire,
[1:49] which is the best cleansing agent. And
[1:51] then shortly after I read Isaiah chapter
[1:53] 4, I then read Isaiah 6, where Isaiah
[1:55] gets a coal from off the altar. And then
[1:58] I went and looked in the quotes of
[1:59] Brother Brandham about the spirit of
[2:01] burning. There's one quote where he says
[2:03] that. So we'll get to that. We'll just
[2:04] see the progression of the spirit of
[2:06] burning throughout the scripture. I
[2:08] think there's seven verses that I
[2:10] preached on that involve the spirit of
[2:12] burning and seven is the number of
[2:14] completion. I'm sure there could be more
[2:16] though by the grace of God. But I just
[2:17] thought I'd share this to encourage you
[2:19] as it was a great encouragement to the
[2:21] congregation by the grace of God. So
[2:23] start with Isaiah chapter 4 again. So
[2:26] the context is God going to wash and
[2:29] purge the daughters of Zion. Now if you
[2:31] remember chapter 3, these hotty,
[2:33] prideful daughters of Zion had 21
[2:36] accessories. So they were adorning the
[2:38] outward too much and not focused on the
[2:41] inward. And then God said the only way
[2:43] to cleanse that type of immoral pride is
[2:46] by the spirit of judgment and the spirit
[2:48] of burning. Now this might be a compound
[2:50] prophecy in Isaiah 4:4. But God promised
[2:54] to wash the filth out of Zion. So all
[2:56] that filthy pride. No doubt there was
[2:59] high heels spoken of because they made
[3:01] tinkling sounds as they walked. 21
[3:04] different accessories to try to make
[3:06] themselves look beautiful. And as
[3:07] brother Ram said, the more accessories
[3:09] you put on the outside of yourself, it
[3:10] shows the more empty you are on the
[3:13] inside. You're empty of God's spirit,
[3:15] the spirit of burning or the Holy Ghost.
[3:18] So in Isaiah 4, God promises to purge
[3:21] and cleanse all the filth out of Israel.
[3:24] And then in verse 5, Mount Zion was
[3:26] going to be a place where there was
[3:27] smoke by day and a shining of a flaming
[3:30] fire by night. So, not only was the fire
[3:32] going to purge and cleanse the sins of
[3:34] Israel, but it'd be a visible presence
[3:37] there on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. So,
[3:40] this is speaking of the millennium or
[3:43] perhaps the future home or both by the
[3:45] grace of God because we know Malachi
[3:48] says in the millennium we'll walk upon
[3:50] the ashes of the wicked. Ashes are the
[3:52] result of a fire. So, there's got to be
[3:54] a fire to cleanse the earth before the
[3:56] millennium. And then as we'll see later,
[3:58] brother Ram said Isaiah 4 is about the
[4:01] future home as well. So there might be
[4:02] another cleansing before the future home
[4:05] comes down. Or it could be the fire of
[4:07] Gog and Magog that comes down to burn up
[4:10] Satan and his evil army at the end of
[4:13] the millennium that he gathers from the
[4:14] four corners of the earth to come
[4:16] against the camp of God, the camp of the
[4:18] saints.
[4:20] So now let's go to Isaiah chapter 6. By
[4:22] God's grace, Isaiah sees a vision of the
[4:25] Lord in verses 1-5.
[4:28] He says he's a man of unclean lips. So,
[4:30] how does he become clean? An angel takes
[4:33] a coal, a live coal off the altar and
[4:35] puts it on his lips. And then his sin is
[4:38] purged. So, we see the same thing
[4:40] happening in Isaiah 6 that was spoken of
[4:43] in Isaiah chapter 4. The fire of God
[4:46] cleanses filth, cleanses sin, purges
[4:49] sin. And then Isaiah said, "Here I am.
[4:52] Send me Lord." So here we see the spirit
[4:55] of burning in Isaiah's life to put him
[4:57] into service. Brother Ram tells us that
[4:59] Uzziah was his mentor. Isaiah had great
[5:02] parents, godly parents, but he needed an
[5:04] experience from the Holy Ghost himself
[5:06] in order to be put into service. So this
[5:09] is an awesome verse that goes along with
[5:11] the quote. Brother Brandham said, "Every
[5:12] man who's a preacher or gets put into
[5:14] service must meet God on the back side
[5:16] of a desert somewhere." In other words,
[5:18] must have an experience with the Holy
[5:20] Ghost. So, here's Isaiah's spirit of
[5:22] burning experience with the Holy Ghost,
[5:25] and he's put into service. And remember,
[5:27] according to John 7:es 37-39, the Old
[5:30] Testament saints could not have the
[5:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul,
[5:34] but they could have the baptism of the
[5:35] Holy Ghost in their spirits or minds.
[5:37] So, they could have two works of grace
[5:39] in the Old Testament. So, Isaiah 6 is
[5:42] Isaiah's experience of the second work
[5:43] of grace. He's getting that
[5:45] sanctification experience in order to be
[5:47] put into service. But remember, in the
[5:50] New Testament, you need three works of
[5:51] grace to be put into service. And I have
[5:53] numerous videos about that if you'd like
[5:54] to watch those by the grace of God. So
[5:56] Isaiah is the first example. Uh Jeremiah
[5:59] is the second one. Jeremiah 20:9.
[6:02] Jeremiah was going through a lot of
[6:04] persecution. Chapter 20, he was in
[6:07] stocks and we know later he got thrown
[6:09] into pits. Jeremiah suffered much for
[6:12] the glory of God, for the word of God.
[6:14] He suffered a lot to be a prophet. And
[6:16] Jeremiah was about ready to quit in
[6:18] Jeremiah 20. He was in derision daily in
[6:22] verse 7. And it seems like the prophet
[6:24] even made a mistake in verse 7. He said,
[6:26] "Oh Lord, thou hast deceived me." Now
[6:29] friends, we know God doesn't deceive any
[6:30] man. But that's how Jeremiah felt
[6:32] because of all the persecution. Reminds
[6:34] us of John the Baptist because of being
[6:37] imprisoned. Brother Ram said his eagle
[6:39] eyes got filmed over and he wondered,
[6:41] "Is Jesus the Messiah or not?" And then
[6:44] in verse 9, he said, "I will not make
[6:46] mention of him, nor speak any more of
[6:48] his name." Jeremiah almost quits. He
[6:51] almost decides to quit. But his word was
[6:53] in mine heart as a burning fire shut up
[6:55] in my bones. So here we see the spirit
[6:58] of burning comes upon us when we feel
[7:00] like quitting. We feel like giving up
[7:02] preaching. We feel like giving up
[7:04] testifying.
[7:05] The Holy Ghost is faithful. Well, God is
[7:07] faithful to us in our darkest moments to
[7:10] come and give us a renewed experience
[7:13] and keep us from quitting. Praise God
[7:15] for that. And I think I preached that
[7:17] brother Brandham almost quit after the
[7:19] death of his first wife, Hope, and the
[7:22] baby girl, Sharon Rose. It was spoken of
[7:25] in the sermon, is your life worthy of
[7:27] the gospel? And brother Ram was
[7:29] listening to the devil cuz he felt like
[7:30] God had sent a black sheet down and God
[7:33] was not hearing brother Ram's prayer.
[7:35] And some of the things that the devil
[7:36] was saying was right in brother Ram's
[7:38] mind. He just pulled down the curtain as
[7:40] if say, "Shut up. I don't want to hear
[7:42] you at all. You wouldn't even talk to
[7:45] me."
[7:46] Then if he wouldn't talk to me, it was
[7:48] Satan's time. Then I begin to listen to
[7:50] him. That's reasoning. I thought,
[7:53] "That's right." Said, "He could you
[7:55] don't have to speak the word. Just look
[7:56] to your baby to live." I said, "That's
[7:58] right.
[8:00] And as much as you've done for him, and
[8:01] yet that's what he does for you." I
[8:03] said, "That's right.
[8:05] I begin to think, well, what? See,
[8:07] everything begin to break away when it
[8:09] come to reasonings.
[8:11] But when it come to that, that hung it
[8:14] stayed there. I was just about ready to
[8:17] say then I'll quit. But then he said,
[8:19] the anchor held. And he quoted Job.
[8:23] Those beautiful words, the Lord gives
[8:25] and the Lord takes away. Blessed be the
[8:27] name of the Lord. He said, where did I
[8:29] get my daughter anyway? Who am I to
[8:31] question the almighty God? I said,
[8:33] "Satan, get away from me." I went over,
[8:36] lay my hand on the baby. I said, "God
[8:38] bless you, sweetheart. In a minute,
[8:39] daddy will take you down, put you on
[8:41] mommy's arms. The angels will pack your
[8:43] little soul away and I'll meet you in
[8:44] that morning." I said, "Lord, you give
[8:47] her to me, you're taking her away and
[8:48] throw you slainy like Job said, yet I
[8:51] love you and I believe you. If you send
[8:53] me to hell, I love you anyhow. I can't
[8:55] get away from that." There you are.
[8:59] Just been intellectual. It all broke
[9:01] away.
[9:02] But you got to have personal
[9:04] relationship. You got to be born again.
[9:08] So we see the spirit of burning comes
[9:10] upon brother Brandham in order to keep
[9:13] him in service, to keep him from
[9:14] quitting. Praise the Lord for that. God
[9:16] is faithful to keep his prophets from
[9:18] quitting. I was just about ready to say
[9:21] then I'll quit.
[9:23] The next example is Psalm chapter 39
[9:25] with David. For context, it seems that
[9:28] he wrote this uh psalm while he was
[9:30] running from King Saul during those
[9:32] years of being exiled from Israel. Verse
[9:36] 13 said he didn't have much strength
[9:38] because he was asking God to spare him
[9:40] that he would recover his strength.
[9:42] Verse two said he was in sorrow. But
[9:45] notice when you're in sorrow and you're
[9:47] weak, God's spirit comes. The spirit of
[9:50] burning comes upon you in order to renew
[9:53] your strength and encourage you. Look at
[9:55] verse three. My heart was hot within me.
[9:57] While I was musing, the fire burned.
[9:59] Then spake I with my tongue. Lord, make
[10:02] me to know mine end and the measure of
[10:04] my days. So no doubt David was
[10:06] struggling. Am I going to live? How many
[10:08] more years do I have left? Is Saul going
[10:10] to kill me? And then finishing verse
[10:12] four, what it is, and that I may know
[10:14] how frail I am. So this tells us when
[10:17] we're at our lowest and we feel like
[10:19] life may be over, we're wondering how
[10:20] much time we have left. We meditate on
[10:23] God. We should muse on God. think about
[10:25] God and then God's spirit will come to
[10:27] encourage us. And the Bible said God
[10:29] gave David hope and no doubt God would
[10:31] give him hope. He was anointed to be
[10:32] king. He wasn't king yet, but the
[10:34] anointing, the spirit of burning came
[10:36] upon him to let him know you're going to
[10:37] be king. Verse 7 says, Lord, what wait I
[10:41] for? My hope is in thee. So God's spirit
[10:45] will come upon you when you're
[10:46] struggling, wondering about your future,
[10:49] how many more years you have left. God's
[10:50] spirit will come upon you to give you
[10:52] hope and renew your strength. Beautiful
[10:55] story there by the grace of God. The
[10:57] next one is Luke 24. Cleopus and his
[11:01] friend on the road to Emmas. The Bible
[11:03] said that they were sad. This is on
[11:06] resurrection day, resurrection Sunday.
[11:10] They're walking away from Jerusalem on
[11:12] the road to Emmas. Jesus comes out and
[11:14] talks to them. And the Bible said that
[11:17] Jesus started at Moses and preached all
[11:19] about himself. The preacher of preachers
[11:22] preaching about himself. Oh, I love this
[11:23] story. Jesus preaches to them during
[11:26] their walk and Jesus acts like he's
[11:28] going to leave them, but then they
[11:29] constrain him to stay and then he breaks
[11:31] the bread and they recognize his
[11:33] presence. He vanishes. Their eyes were
[11:35] open. They knew him and they said, "Did
[11:37] not our heart burn within us as he
[11:39] talked with us by the way while he
[11:42] opened to us the scriptures." There's so
[11:45] many applications of this. You know,
[11:46] this can happen in a service while we're
[11:48] listening to the word of God and we feel
[11:49] like the presence of God comes upon us
[11:52] and like God is talking directly to us.
[11:55] But here we see in this case the spirit
[11:57] of burning came upon them during the
[11:59] preaching of the word and gave them hope
[12:02] about their service and their future.
[12:03] Again, they're doubting was he the
[12:05] Messiah or not? I thought Jesus was this
[12:07] great prophet, but they killed him. Our
[12:09] Lord's been killed. He's been crucified.
[12:13] But the spirit of the Lord, the spirit
[12:14] of burning comes upon their hearts
[12:16] during the preaching of the word. This
[12:19] is something that happens to us quite
[12:20] often as message believers, as holy
[12:22] ghostfilled saints. In our times of
[12:24] doubt, in our times of frustration, our
[12:26] times of fear, the spirit of God will
[12:28] come upon us to encourage us. And they
[12:30] were so encouraged, they ran all the way
[12:33] back to Jerusalem. I think it was 6
[12:34] milesi if I'm not mistaken. And then
[12:36] later, Jesus appeared to all the
[12:38] apostles that same night. We get so many
[12:40] truths out of this passage. Like even
[12:42] when we're sad, even when when we're
[12:44] discouraged, we should talk about the
[12:45] Lord. And then as we talk about the
[12:47] Lord, the Lord will come and dwell
[12:50] amongst us. As what happened to Cleopus
[12:52] and his friend here in Luke chapter 24.
[12:54] So the spirit of burning puts you in
[12:56] service as Isaiah said. The spirit of
[12:59] burning keeps you from quitting service
[13:01] as Jeremiah experienced. The spirit of
[13:04] burning gives you hope about your future
[13:06] service as you meditate as David said in
[13:09] Psalm 39. And the spirit of burning
[13:12] dissolves your doubts, encouraging you,
[13:15] taking away your sadness as we see in
[13:17] Luke 24.
[13:19] And now we see the spirit of burning
[13:21] sealing you into the kingdom of God in
[13:23] Acts 2 3 and 4. They were in one place
[13:26] in one accord. And then cloven tongues
[13:29] like as under fire sat on each one of
[13:31] the 120 believers in the upper room. And
[13:34] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[13:36] and began to speak with other tongues as
[13:38] the spirit gave them utterance. So here
[13:40] we see the disciples and the apostles
[13:43] 120 received the promise of the father
[13:45] that Jesus called it in Acts chapter 1.
[13:47] Their souls were baptized with the Holy
[13:49] Ghost. Now they have power to be
[13:51] witnesses. Now they have the third work
[13:52] of grace that even Ezekiel prophesied.
[13:56] New heart, new spirit, my spirit. They
[13:59] have the seal of the Holy Ghost. They
[14:01] have the token of the baptism of the
[14:03] Holy Ghost putting them into full
[14:05] service by the complete three works of
[14:07] grace. So now we see the spirit of
[14:09] burning coming into the soul of the
[14:11] believer. The first time that could
[14:12] happen according again to John 7:37-39.
[14:16] And 7th and finally is second Peter 3 12
[14:20] and 13. Peter said looking for and
[14:23] hasting unto the coming of the day of
[14:24] God wherein the heavens being on fire
[14:27] shall be dissolved and the elements
[14:29] shall melt with fervent heat.
[14:30] Nevertheless, we according to his
[14:32] promise look for new heavens and a new
[14:34] earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[14:37] I'll read 14 as well. Beautiful.
[14:39] Beloved, seeing that you look for such
[14:41] things, be diligent that you may be
[14:42] found of him in peace, without spot, and
[14:46] blameless. So, this is speaking of the
[14:49] future home. And this is the scripture
[14:51] that Brother Ram uses for his sermon on
[14:53] the future home. It's from the future
[14:55] home, August 2nd, 1964.
[14:58] Brother Ram's going to read Isaiah 4,
[15:01] verse 4. And he compares it to the three
[15:03] works of grace. So, we know the earth is
[15:05] redeemed in three steps. the water of
[15:07] Noah's flood. The second step is the
[15:09] blood of Jesus Christ poured upon the
[15:11] earth, water, blood, and then spirit or
[15:14] fire. This fervent heat preaches and
[15:17] speaks of here. He prophesies of it.
[15:19] Let's listen to the quote from God's
[15:20] prophet, brother Brandon. That's always
[15:22] God's judgment. When he makes his final
[15:24] judgment, calls you, justifies you,
[15:27] brings you to redemption, then his
[15:28] judgment breaks forth upon you and the
[15:31] Holy Ghost and fire cleanses away the
[15:33] sin. Then you're his. same thing he does
[15:35] to the earth when he purges it with fire
[15:39] and by the spirit of burning.
[15:42] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[15:44] a blessing again by the grace of God.
[15:46] So, I think this sermon series showed me
[15:49] and showed our congregation that the
[15:50] Holy Ghost is here no matter what we
[15:53] need. Whether we need to be put into
[15:54] service, whether we need encouragement
[15:57] to keep from quitting, whether we're
[16:00] wondering about our future and we need
[16:01] strength to continue on, it helps
[16:04] dissolve our doubts about our service.
[16:06] And the spirit of burning will prepare
[16:08] for us a future home. Hallelujah to the
[16:11] lamb of God. The Holy Ghost is here to
[16:13] heal us, strengthen us, keep us from
[16:14] quitting, baptize our souls with the
[16:17] fire of Almighty God. So, no matter
[16:20] where you're at in your walk with God,
[16:21] just meditate on the Lord. Talk about
[16:23] the Lord. I was even reading in Psalm
[16:25] recently, and I believe the Bible said,
[16:26] "Let the believers continually say,"The
[16:29] Lord be magnified." And I've been trying
[16:30] to remember to do that just throughout
[16:32] the day, the Lord be magnified. Praise
[16:34] God. God is great. God is so mighty. God
[16:36] is so awesome. Just continually talking
[16:38] about the Lord. And then the spirit of
[16:40] God comes upon us to help us, to
[16:42] strengthen us, to encourage us. May God
[16:45] encourage you today with the spirit of
[16:47] burning.
[16:49] If you have any questions, concerns or
[16:51] testimonies about this video, please
[16:52] contact me. God bless you and may Jesus
[16:56] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[16:59] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[17:01] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[17:04] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[17:07] good news that Jesus raised from the
[17:09] dead, living among man today, his
[17:11] church. The same Jesus that was
[17:14] yesterday will be today and forever.
[17:17] is never fail.
