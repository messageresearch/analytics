TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the third pull and the speaking the word it seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored placed entirely ready for the Rapture in the resurrection th son of man this is so or is it not and you would do this if properly pressed upon would you not Escape all these things things that's got a little there escaped all these things and stand before the son of man Luke 2136 now my my dear friend now I think here that you you got to you got a good statement yes sir yes sir now that would be so he said brother Brandon in other words here's what I'm I don't think it's I can I believe I not polishing up what you said but I believe I can make it a little clearer to people see you are believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you here Witnesses squirrels and all these other things that's been done but did you notice that was sovereignly given I never asked him Lord let me do this speak these things in like that do these things there I never asked him that he by his own Divine will came to me and said you go do this see I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses never asked to go down in Egypt but it was God that sent him down to Egypt see now I believe if the Holy Spirit would come to me and say in a vision go tell certain certain person that they are not uh they're trying to overcome a certain thing and they cannot do it they're smoking they're drinking they're lying stealing or committing adultery whatever it might be or they got lustful spirit and you just go where their are and say thou Spirit come out of there I set this captive free would it take place absolutely yes indeed it absolutely would it take place but now upon my own presuming now presume is means to Adventure without Authority see I go down there to help this person I'm just presuming that it'll be all right see then I don't know I can call the name of the Lord over him I can pray for him do whatever I wish to if I had my own way this morning I I just had an interview with this little lady sitting here in this wheelchair to come to this meeting today they had had a fire department take her out of her house in Chicago and people live across the street don't come to the meeting see what would I do if it was in my power it is in I have the authority to do it but I have to wait for orders to do it see I have the authority from God to do it but now when he gives the orders she go back home well see I know that is the truth I just be as willing to die this morning on that as I I'd be an any see that's the truth but first you see it's all that no one even Jesus himself said the son can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father do that doeth the son likewise you know that St John 5:19 all right the son does nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that the son will do likewise all right
