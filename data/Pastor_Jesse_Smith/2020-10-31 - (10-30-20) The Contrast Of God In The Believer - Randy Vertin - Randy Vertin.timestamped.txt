[17:58] is
[18:00] [Music]
[18:08] [Music]
[18:22] uh just a few announcements uh you guys
[18:25] didn't know um
[18:27] dr jesse he did go and get the test and
[18:30] he came back positive
[18:31] but i just got off the phone call with
[18:33] him an hour ago and he said he's been
[18:34] really good
[18:35] so we believe that it's just probably
[18:38] like a false positive
[18:39] so he's gonna go back and get retested
[18:41] again but he said he's feeling really
[18:43] good
[18:43] so um we'll just keep praying for him
[18:46] and keep praying for
[18:48] the the test that he's going to retake
[18:50] that'll come back negative
[18:54] so um with that being said if
[18:58] if that doesn't come back um
[19:02] if it comes back positive again then
[19:04] you'll have to quarantine for
[19:06] i think 10 days 10 or 14 days so um
[19:10] we'll let you guys know what we'll do
[19:11] with uh next week first service first
[19:14] for sunday and um

[40:22] there's
[40:26] [Music]
[40:30] let's get right into the word and
[40:34] i'll turn to the book of hebrews chapter
[40:36] 5 verse 14.
[40:47] [Music]
[41:01] certainly keep everybody in prayer
[41:03] that's battling and
[41:04] going through the different things we're
[41:06] all going through but uh
[41:08] you know we're just grateful that the
[41:10] lord gives us a way that we can
[41:12] even still fellowship even in those hard
[41:14] times amen being able to do a live
[41:16] stream and those different things
[41:18] lord knows we'd prefer to you know see
[41:20] each other in the flesh but we're
[41:22] certainly grateful for
[41:23] the spirit of the lord that's here is
[41:25] able to minister to everyone that has
[41:27] need wherever they might be we're not
[41:28] bound by
[41:30] time or we're not bound by time or space
[41:32] or any of those things but
[41:33] the lord jesus is uh he's with his
[41:36] people
[41:38] and we're just gonna just read the
[41:43] we'll start at verse 11 and i'll just
[41:45] read to the end of the chapter here
[41:49] of whom we have many things to say and
[41:51] heart to be uttered seeing your goal of
[41:52] hearing
[41:54] for when for the time you ought to be
[41:56] teachers you have need that one teach
[41:57] you again
[41:59] which be the first principle of the
[42:00] oracles of god that are become such as
[42:02] have need of milk and not of strong meat
[42:04] for everyone that uses milk is
[42:06] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[42:07] for he is a babe
[42:09] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[42:10] are of full age even
[42:12] those who by reason of use have their
[42:15] senses exercised
[42:16] to discern both good and evil
[42:19] amen let's just bow our heads in the
[42:20] word of prayer heavenly father lord
[42:22] we just come humbly before you this
[42:24] evening lord jesus we just
[42:26] come to receive from you what we would
[42:28] have need of lord no doubt each one of
[42:30] us would have desires in our heart lord
[42:31] and
[42:32] lord our greatest desire lord is just to
[42:34] draw closer to you to live
[42:36] more closely to your lord every day and
[42:39] every single minute every single hour
[42:41] lord that
[42:41] we could just be more pleasing to you
[42:44] lord to just pray right now in the name
[42:45] of the lord jesus that you would
[42:46] come and anoint the service lord for
[42:48] your purpose lord we just want to lift
[42:50] up your name get glory unto thyself lord
[42:52] jesus
[42:53] and we just ask that your perfect will
[42:54] be done this evening lord and
[42:56] guide us and direct us in thy precious
[42:57] name we pray the lord jesus christ amen
[43:00] amen amen you may be seated
[43:03] oh thank you
[43:08] and then so last evening
[43:12] we just kind of spoke a little bit on
[43:14] the the contrasting
[43:15] attributes of god and forgetting to take
[43:17] this off it's pretty warm in here
[43:21] and just spoke last evening a little bit
[43:25] on the contrasting
[43:26] attributes of god in this age and how
[43:30] you know he's called each and every one
[43:32] of us oh thank you brother
[43:35] thanks for the thing uh he's called he's
[43:38] called us
[43:39] to be a contrast to the things that are
[43:41] going on in the world in this day and
[43:45] no doubt as as believers we are a
[43:47] contrasting
[43:49] uh contrasting force for the darkness in
[43:51] the world this the
[43:52] the light shining in the darkness and
[43:55] maybe this
[43:55] this evening we just want to speak maybe
[43:58] a little bit on
[43:58] on you know so many times the devil
[44:02] as we spoke about last night the devil
[44:04] is his goal is to hinder the work of god
[44:07] we know by the grace of the lord as
[44:09] believers we know that he can't stop the
[44:10] work of god
[44:12] amen the the lord says the word has gone
[44:14] forth from his mouth and it won't return
[44:16] to him void
[44:17] the lord has spoken good things
[44:19] concerning the pride of jesus christ in
[44:21] this day he says i know i know the
[44:22] thoughts i have towards you
[44:24] thoughts of peace and not of evil i'm
[44:25] going to give you an expected end
[44:27] and we know what our expected end in
[44:29] this age is and that's to
[44:31] that's to receive a rapture that's the
[44:33] that's to leave this place
[44:35] be joined with our bridegroom by the
[44:36] grace of god and we know that those
[44:38] things have been spoken about us and we
[44:40] see
[44:41] that the word is is desiring
[44:44] something of us in this hour to manifest
[44:47] the lord jesus
[44:48] to the world even though they may not
[44:50] see it they may not understand it
[44:52] they don't you know jesus when he was on
[44:55] earth
[44:56] according to the flesh they didn't
[44:57] understand him then
[44:59] the ones that claimed to be received
[45:02] receivers of the word the pharisees and
[45:04] the sadducees and the great minds of the
[45:06] day
[45:07] as much as they claimed to have the word
[45:10] and they did according to knowledge
[45:12] they didn't know according to the to the
[45:14] spirit of revelation
[45:16] who god himself was when he came on the
[45:18] scene
[45:20] and so we understand that that'll it'll
[45:22] be that way once again because
[45:24] these things always repeat themselves
[45:26] and in this day
[45:28] it's going to be the same way no matter
[45:29] how much you can prove it by the
[45:31] scriptures no matter how much it
[45:33] vindicates itself supernaturally
[45:35] or otherwise there's going to be those
[45:37] that can't receive it
[45:39] but god has called us to express
[45:42] his life in this day he said he said the
[45:44] works that i do he that believeth upon
[45:46] me the works that i do
[45:48] shall ye do also and and so it's not and
[45:51] those things aren't just
[45:52] limited to just supernatural work so
[45:55] many times
[45:56] we we pare those things down and we
[45:59] we all that's just the miracles and
[46:01] that's just the healings and those
[46:02] things are wonderful and we believe that
[46:04] that's part of it but it's it's also
[46:07] just
[46:07] it's the very life that the believer
[46:09] leads it's the very
[46:10] character of god himself expressed in
[46:13] his people
[46:15] you know we understand that we you know
[46:18] the the
[46:18] we call the stature of a perfect man and
[46:20] those things faith virtue knowledge
[46:22] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[46:23] kindness
[46:24] and divine love or charity we understand
[46:27] that these
[46:27] these things are to be expressed in the
[46:29] believer amen
[46:31] and no matter how many miracles you
[46:32] could perform no matter how many signs
[46:35] and wonders could be done
[46:36] except that life lives in you
[46:40] and is being expressed by the believer
[46:43] then it doesn't profit anything
[46:45] because paul said though i though i
[46:47] could speak with the tongues of men and
[46:48] angels
[46:49] and and though i could do all these
[46:51] mighty works if i if i don't have
[46:52] charity
[46:53] which is charity in and of itself the
[46:56] capstone of the pyramid the capstone of
[46:58] it all
[46:59] jesus christ himself he if you were to
[47:02] have
[47:02] charity you have all of those things
[47:05] because it's all embodied in jesus
[47:07] christ
[47:08] so paul is summing up the whole thing
[47:10] except i have all of these things in me
[47:13] except this charity jesus christ which
[47:15] we know it the holy ghost
[47:18] because it is god himself god is that
[47:20] love god is that divine love the holy
[47:22] ghost is
[47:23] that divine love living in the believer
[47:26] except that lives in the believer
[47:30] and expresses itself out it doesn't
[47:32] profit anything did not
[47:33] jesus said many will come to me in that
[47:35] day and say lord lord have that we've
[47:36] done this
[47:37] and we've done that because surely they
[47:39] could look at the scripture and said
[47:40] jesus but jesus you said that whosoever
[47:43] believeth on me the works i do shall ye
[47:45] do also
[47:46] and no doubt that there were certain
[47:48] works
[47:49] that they did perform as far as the
[47:52] miracles and as far as
[47:53] signs and wonders and those things but
[47:56] there was the
[47:57] there was so much more to it than that
[47:59] it just it goes beyond just the surface
[48:02] level but it's just
[48:03] it's not just an outward uh if i could
[48:06] say
[48:06] it's not just an outward uh
[48:09] manifestation of miracles and
[48:11] and certain things that you can see with
[48:12] the eyes but it but it's a very
[48:15] life and a character that lives within
[48:17] the believer and you can't explain it
[48:19] because you cannot explain the
[48:21] supernatural
[48:22] if it could be explained that way then
[48:25] then it then surely the intellectuals
[48:26] would have picked it up by now
[48:28] but it can't be explained in in in an
[48:31] intellectual fashion
[48:33] that's why paul said i didn't come with
[48:34] enticing words of man's wisdom i didn't
[48:36] come
[48:37] with these great swelling words of of
[48:39] speech although we could have done it
[48:41] paul was a pharisee of pharisees he was
[48:44] educated
[48:44] he was a man brought under i think
[48:46] gamalia that was one of the great
[48:48] teachers of the time
[48:49] he said as concerning the law it was
[48:51] blameless he could have laid it out for
[48:54] him when it come to those things
[48:56] and yet he said i didn't come to you
[48:58] with that but i came with power and
[48:59] demonstration of the spirit
[49:01] and he came and humbled this in meekness
[49:03] he said i came to you in feet and much
[49:05] trembling
[49:06] and weakness how different it is
[49:10] from what so many people today believe
[49:12] that that a person of god should be with
[49:14] their chest stuck out
[49:16] walking around well i'm i'm this and i'm
[49:18] bad and i'm i'm
[49:19] whatever it might be so much pride and
[49:21] things and arrogance that goes on in the
[49:23] world today because that's the spirit of
[49:24] the age
[49:25] is arrogance everybody wants to have
[49:27] well i gotta have my place i got to get
[49:29] you know they say oh i got to get mine
[49:31] i got to get i got to get this i got to
[49:33] get that i got to get
[49:35] houses and lands and cars and treasures
[49:38] and riches and all these things
[49:40] how different it is from when jesus
[49:42] christ came on the scene
[49:44] and humbled himself to a form of a
[49:46] servant and made himself of no
[49:48] reputation
[49:49] the very god of heaven would humble
[49:51] himself
[49:53] to wash the feet of his own children
[49:58] to wash the feet of his own child and
[50:00] even think about it
[50:02] watch the feet of his own children
[50:04] before they were even converted
[50:08] how powerful a thought would you think
[50:10] that jesus christ
[50:12] would come down and humble himself to
[50:14] that place
[50:15] where he could but knowing that peter
[50:17] was going to deny him three times
[50:19] and yet he could wash his feet and
[50:22] humble himself to that
[50:24] but he was showing us that that
[50:27] the way up is down the way to be exalted
[50:31] is to humble yourself
[50:34] how we need a lesson in that today i
[50:35] believe we there's so much in the world
[50:37] of doing that but
[50:38] we but but god is looking for a humble
[50:41] expression of himself in this age
[50:43] and it's not it's not just it's not just
[50:46] a a a
[50:47] as we said miracles inside we need those
[50:49] things i believe we need more of them to
[50:51] be honest
[50:52] i believe that there's so much of it
[50:53] that we shoved up to the side and made
[50:55] excuses for why
[50:56] these things don't happen i believe in
[50:58] them but to go along with it
[51:01] needs to be the character because power
[51:03] without character say ten so
[51:08] in understanding this we want to come to
[51:11] a place
[51:12] where if we're going to be that
[51:16] expression in this hour
[51:18] where god is trying to to show his
[51:21] character through you through the
[51:23] believer
[51:24] it's not just on the minister it's not
[51:27] just on the song leader or the deacon
[51:29] but he's wanting to show his character
[51:32] through
[51:32] each and every member of the body
[51:36] through each and every member of the
[51:38] body from from the littlest child
[51:41] to the oldest elder and everywhere in
[51:44] between
[51:45] those that name the name of jesus christ
[51:47] filled with the holy ghost
[51:49] god is wanting to express his life
[51:51] through you
[51:53] and the devil will try to sell you short
[51:56] on your place in the body because
[52:00] the devil is always trying to build up
[52:03] certain things and tear down certain
[52:05] things and
[52:05] put people out of their place making it
[52:07] so that one
[52:08] or one part of the body is less than the
[52:10] other or one part's greater than the
[52:12] other
[52:13] and we know paul preached on these
[52:14] things he said if the whole body were
[52:16] the eye where would be the seeing
[52:18] if the whole body were were fingers you
[52:21] know
[52:22] what would you do see there's certain
[52:23] jobs that certain parts of the body
[52:26] can't do
[52:27] i don't ask my eyes i like to cook
[52:31] but i don't ask my eyes to pick up an
[52:33] onion and chop it up
[52:35] in fact my my eyes usually don't like
[52:37] when my hands do that
[52:39] you start to tear up and everything but
[52:41] you understand
[52:42] i wouldn't tell my my feet
[52:46] to read a book for me i i i wouldn't do
[52:50] that i
[52:51] couldn't it wouldn't make any sense it
[52:52] doesn't even make natural sense
[52:55] how much more for the body of christ is
[52:58] he desiring to use
[53:00] each part of the body for its purpose
[53:03] and exalt the people of god in that spot
[53:06] to the place of the issue i'm not
[53:08] talking about exaltation the way we
[53:09] think of it
[53:10] because our man's version of exaltation
[53:13] is it's to give he prays upon them
[53:16] and oh good job and don't get me wrong
[53:18] those things are good
[53:20] i like to hear a good job you like to
[53:21] hear a good job we want to hear at the
[53:23] end well done that good and faithful
[53:25] servant
[53:26] we're all looking for that ultimate good
[53:28] job at the end
[53:31] but see god's version of exaltation
[53:34] and so many times is so different from
[53:36] our own
[53:38] how many people would have thought how
[53:39] the scripture could say that
[53:41] that the the hills would skip like
[53:43] little rams and the mountains would melt
[53:45] like wax
[53:46] knowing that it was john the baptist
[53:48] coming out of the desert
[53:49] preaching that hardly anybody would hear
[53:51] only preach for six months
[53:53] and then put prison and behead beheaded
[53:56] and god
[53:57] said that was the greatest man born of a
[53:59] woman
[54:02] he said there's not been a man more of a
[54:04] woman like john and that
[54:06] was god's version of exaltation was was
[54:09] to fulfill
[54:10] the purpose that god had for him
[54:14] god had a purpose for john the baptist
[54:17] and because he fulfilled that
[54:18] god could say i'm going to put you in
[54:20] the place you deserve i'm going to put
[54:22] you in the hall of pain
[54:25] but the what we have to do is we have to
[54:28] find our place
[54:29] and then we have to stick to it it's so
[54:32] easy
[54:32] to always you know we're always looking
[54:34] on what everybody else has got
[54:37] so much envy and and and jealousy when
[54:40] it comes
[54:41] to someone has this oh i want to be this
[54:44] not knowing all the wild they're looking
[54:45] back at you saying oh i want to be that
[54:49] you know and it's so it's amazing
[54:51] because the devil's really good at his
[54:53] job he likes to sew that discord
[54:55] he likes to sew those seats everywhere
[54:57] he likes to try to put
[54:58] everything out of place and try to try
[55:01] to make it so
[55:02] that you can't even function anymore
[55:04] because you're so obsessed
[55:06] with something else when the lord says
[55:08] all i want you to do
[55:10] is fulfill your place and he's got a
[55:13] place for you
[55:15] bride of christ people of the body of
[55:17] christ he's got a place for you to
[55:19] fulfill
[55:22] and we need to be content with such
[55:23] things as we have be content
[55:26] with what god's given us be satisfied
[55:28] with our
[55:29] portion in the body now now we're never
[55:32] satisfied
[55:33] with where we are with christ my desire
[55:35] every day is to get closer
[55:37] and closer and closer to be more like
[55:39] him more like him
[55:40] but i want to be content with the things
[55:43] that he's given me
[55:45] and so be that the lord would want to
[55:47] give me something else
[55:48] i'd say lord be it unto me according to
[55:50] thy word
[55:54] but but the lord said he said if you're
[55:56] faithful and little you'll be faithful
[55:58] in much
[55:59] and so many times maybe the lord wants
[56:01] to give you more
[56:03] but he says what are you doing with what
[56:04] i've given you already
[56:07] but you're too busy not satisfied with
[56:09] and i don't know even why we're
[56:11] preaching this right now apparently
[56:12] that's just the way the lord wanted to
[56:13] go
[56:14] this isn't anywhere where i was thinking
[56:17] so let's just let the lord have his way
[56:20] but he just says i want you to be
[56:23] satisfied
[56:24] be content with where you find yourself
[56:27] and then don't be looking longing for
[56:30] the things
[56:31] that other people have because it won't
[56:33] do you any good anyway
[56:34] not only will it make you miserable but
[56:37] it'll make you unfruitful in the place
[56:39] that god's called you
[56:42] if you're so busy looking
[56:46] you know each one of us is almost like a
[56:48] garden
[56:49] we the lord's planted us in a place and
[56:52] he's given us our little
[56:53] our little sphere of influence our
[56:55] little atmosphere and our our sphere of
[56:57] influence
[56:58] that we that we interact with there's
[57:01] going to be many people
[57:02] that sister wendy interacts with that
[57:04] i'll never interact with that that's her
[57:06] little
[57:06] garden that the lord's given her to
[57:08] watch over and to keep
[57:09] and to to influence for the the kingdom
[57:12] of god
[57:13] brother amen the same thing for the bang
[57:15] all the different ones
[57:16] we all have these places that god has
[57:19] planted us
[57:20] it's such a variety and it's so awesome
[57:23] to see how god does it
[57:24] how he puts us in these places and he
[57:26] sets us up
[57:27] i couldn't fulfill the place that sister
[57:29] wendy does i couldn't fulfill the place
[57:31] brother amen or brother bang or
[57:32] any of the any of the other ones i
[57:34] couldn't do it i couldn't fulfill the
[57:36] place of brother jesse or
[57:37] or or brother brother cam over there
[57:39] napoleon but
[57:40] each one of us has been planted like a
[57:43] tree by the rivers of living water
[57:45] in our little place and what we need to
[57:47] do is be instead of always looking
[57:50] oh it's looking oh man sister i wish i
[57:53] had sister wendy's life
[57:54] i wish i had this or that always looking
[57:57] at at her garden and desiring
[57:59] all the while the weeds are popping up
[58:01] in your own garden
[58:03] tend to your own tend to your own so
[58:06] many times
[58:07] you know i believe it was paul who said
[58:10] that
[58:10] instead of looking upon our own things
[58:12] we need to look upon the things of
[58:13] others
[58:14] and he's not see you could take that to
[58:16] mean the wrong thing that doesn't mean i
[58:17] look at sister wendy's things and say oh
[58:19] i want those
[58:20] no it's but we're we're we care for the
[58:23] needs of people
[58:25] but when it comes to our spiritual
[58:27] well-being so many times
[58:28] we get so looking at oh what about their
[58:31] life what's going on there and oh i want
[58:33] to try to fix what's going on here
[58:35] and and you get nitpicky over here you
[58:38] start looking over here and back
[58:39] fighting over there and gosh being over
[58:40] here
[58:41] and trying to figure this out over here
[58:43] and pretty soon
[58:45] i believe song of solomon i believe the
[58:47] girl the woman in song of solomon said
[58:49] said all the other gardens have i kept
[58:52] but my own have not kept
[58:54] and what is it so many times we get so
[58:57] invested in every other person's
[59:00] calling every other person's ministry
[59:03] every other person's purpose
[59:04] that we lose sight of the fact that
[59:07] we're part of this too
[59:09] that we have a purpose to play for our
[59:11] life that god has a place for you to go
[59:14] that god has something for you to do
[59:16] that is he has a
[59:18] a a a world an atmosphere that you're
[59:21] supposed to create
[59:22] he wants you to be looking at your
[59:24] little garden dig up those weeds
[59:26] get the foxes out of there that's
[59:27] spoiled to find start
[59:29] fertilizing the ground with the with the
[59:32] word start
[59:32] watering it with the washing of the
[59:34] water by the word fertilize it
[59:36] you know when sometimes fertilizer is
[59:38] not pleasant
[59:39] fertilizer usually stinks it's usually
[59:42] made out of dawn or something along
[59:44] those lines
[59:44] but what is it those are those are the
[59:46] experiences we go through our trials and
[59:48] troubles what is it doing
[59:49] it's laying that fertilizer all around
[59:51] your life
[59:52] why and then you come up stronger from
[59:54] it you start putting that new branches
[59:56] and pretty soon pretty soon you start
[59:58] putting forth fruits
[1:00:04] but what we want to do is we want that's
[1:00:06] what we want in our lives is we want
[1:00:08] to be the expression
[1:00:12] that god desires for us each part of the
[1:00:15] body has to express
[1:00:17] what it is it can't express what the
[1:00:20] other part is
[1:00:22] that's where we get in trouble so many
[1:00:23] times is that we try to do an imitation
[1:00:26] of something else to try to be try to be
[1:00:29] something else because
[1:00:30] you admire it it may even be for the
[1:00:32] right reasons oh
[1:00:33] i i certainly appreciate the way they do
[1:00:35] this and do that and pretty soon
[1:00:37] you find yourselves kind of locked into
[1:00:39] a into a prison
[1:00:41] where you model everything you're doing
[1:00:43] after that person
[1:00:44] it'll almost you almost start to talk
[1:00:46] like they do and act like they do and
[1:00:48] and you fall under their anointing as it
[1:00:50] were now
[1:00:52] now your mind's no longer your own
[1:00:56] and you got to be really careful about
[1:00:57] that because that's the influence
[1:00:59] that the world wants to put out onto
[1:01:01] people
[1:01:03] paul said follow me as i follow christ
[1:01:06] paul didn't say i want you to be just
[1:01:08] like me or i want you to do this or do
[1:01:10] that
[1:01:10] he said the opposite he said he said i i
[1:01:12] i'm glad that i didn't baptize any of
[1:01:15] you
[1:01:15] because i don't want it to become a name
[1:01:17] game of oh i'm a paul and i have a peter
[1:01:19] and i have a fist and i'm a fat and i'm
[1:01:21] of apollos
[1:01:22] he said but but i just i want the name
[1:01:24] of jesus christ to be lifted up
[1:01:26] i want to see us all come into the
[1:01:28] perfection of the body of christ
[1:01:39] so god has this expression that he wants
[1:01:42] to
[1:01:43] bring out from you as the as the part of
[1:01:45] the body
[1:01:48] he has a life that is in you his very
[1:01:51] life
[1:01:52] the same life if that same spirit that
[1:01:55] dwelled in christ jesus being you it'll
[1:01:56] rain you know
[1:01:57] as a quick in his mortal body it'll
[1:01:59] quicken your moral body amen
[1:02:01] amen as it quick in his body it'll
[1:02:03] quicken yours so
[1:02:04] that very life inside of you god has a
[1:02:07] purpose for it
[1:02:08] to express itself so god had planted
[1:02:11] that seed deep down as we say on the
[1:02:13] inside of the inside of the inside way
[1:02:15] where no one could find it but one day
[1:02:17] the light of god of the gospel the light
[1:02:19] of the gospel showed in your life
[1:02:22] quicken that seed to life god sealed it
[1:02:24] by the holy ghost
[1:02:25] and now god's desire is to take that
[1:02:28] life
[1:02:29] and let it grow let it grow let it grow
[1:02:32] and express itself to the world god
[1:02:35] wants to express himself that's why he's
[1:02:37] done so much of this
[1:02:38] if god had these attributes in himself
[1:02:42] these characteristics that he was
[1:02:45] that he wanted to express and so he
[1:02:48] created the heavens and the earth
[1:02:50] he created hit the creatures the
[1:02:52] different things that i believe brother
[1:02:53] branham expressed it in the way i don't
[1:02:55] have the quote but he expressed it i
[1:02:56] believe
[1:02:57] in a way where he said when adam was
[1:02:59] even naming the animals
[1:03:00] he was naming him by their
[1:03:02] characteristics he would see the lion
[1:03:04] make a mighty roar and
[1:03:05] something would inspire him by that
[1:03:07] character that he saw
[1:03:09] in the creature said you're a lion or
[1:03:12] he'd see a
[1:03:13] a an eagle sword up in the sky and he'd
[1:03:16] hear that eagle scream
[1:03:17] and see him flying up there and soaring
[1:03:19] and he said you're an eagle
[1:03:20] there is a character behind it god with
[1:03:23] just
[1:03:24] little tidbits if we could almost call
[1:03:26] him breadcrumbs of his character
[1:03:28] that he just places all over i mean you
[1:03:30] look at the majesty of the mountains and
[1:03:32] the the vastness of the oceans and now
[1:03:35] god you know even the the poets and
[1:03:38] and the psalmist which is you don't say
[1:03:39] it's we we only
[1:03:41] we can only use the words that we have
[1:03:42] in this mortal realm
[1:03:44] to express the greatness of god how he
[1:03:46] could say
[1:03:47] you know yeah i was even discussing with
[1:03:50] my wife
[1:03:50] or i can't remember maybe it wasn't her
[1:03:52] or something i don't remember who it was
[1:03:54] now
[1:03:55] but talking about you know the arrogance
[1:03:57] of man and
[1:03:58] how we get so we man thinks they know so
[1:04:01] much
[1:04:02] oh we're gonna do this and we're gonna
[1:04:04] go to the moon and
[1:04:05] we're gonna go to mars and we're gonna
[1:04:07] build this and we're gonna do that and
[1:04:09] we're gonna
[1:04:09] we're gonna be able to do whatever we
[1:04:11] want to do and no doubt
[1:04:13] that to an extent they certainly could
[1:04:15] because even the lord said that nothing
[1:04:17] would be restrained from them
[1:04:18] when they're in one accord
[1:04:21] and yet even then i was just thinking
[1:04:25] about i said
[1:04:26] i didn't say this to anybody in
[1:04:28] particular but i just was thinking about
[1:04:29] it
[1:04:29] you know we they say we know so much
[1:04:32] about space but we don't even know
[1:04:34] what's on the bottom of the ocean it's
[1:04:36] so deep and vast and mysterious
[1:04:39] and so no wonder even the psalmist the
[1:04:41] different ones and
[1:04:42] and the scripture writings could say he
[1:04:45] cast them into the sea of god's
[1:04:46] forgetfulness
[1:04:47] why because even even space wasn't
[1:04:49] enough for them to understand
[1:04:51] the depths of the ocean and even look at
[1:04:54] it and we even see reality
[1:04:55] portrays that because we even know
[1:04:57] almost more about space above us
[1:04:59] than we do about the oceans below it's a
[1:05:02] mystery why
[1:05:03] how god could just forget your sins
[1:05:06] underneath the blood
[1:05:06] but i'm so thankful that he can and it's
[1:05:09] not because
[1:05:10] it's not because of anything i need to
[1:05:11] understand it's only because he said so
[1:05:15] because he said you were forgiven
[1:05:16] because he said in their sins and
[1:05:18] iniquities i will remember no more
[1:05:23] i'm so grateful for that amen so
[1:05:26] god put the seed in you these
[1:05:28] characteristics out there that he's
[1:05:30] that that he's placed you know because
[1:05:32] only one had the fullness and that was
[1:05:34] jesus christ
[1:05:35] the fullness of god dwelt in that that
[1:05:38] mortal flesh
[1:05:39] that came down and yet when on the day
[1:05:42] of pentecost
[1:05:43] as an example he said like cloven
[1:05:45] tongues of fire
[1:05:46] lit upon each one god dispensing a
[1:05:50] portion of himself to each of the
[1:05:52] believers just a portion
[1:05:54] that he placed in you even before the
[1:05:56] foundation of the world what we
[1:05:57] understand we call it a word
[1:05:58] scene it was a portion of himself that
[1:06:01] he placed in there
[1:06:02] before the foundation of the world and
[1:06:04] that portion has
[1:06:05] has attributes that it wants to express
[1:06:08] and we spoke a little bit about that
[1:06:10] yesterday on how how
[1:06:12] when you when you come into a poor place
[1:06:15] and there's
[1:06:15] there's a sickness there's an attribute
[1:06:18] in the believer
[1:06:19] of healing that can reach out and meet
[1:06:22] that need
[1:06:24] it's not that you in and of yourself can
[1:06:26] meet that need
[1:06:27] see we need to separate the flesh from
[1:06:30] who we are in jesus christ
[1:06:32] and it's not that that brother randy can
[1:06:34] meet the need
[1:06:35] it's not that brother bang can meet the
[1:06:37] need but if the
[1:06:39] god that is in brother bang is able to
[1:06:42] manifest itself and come and be
[1:06:45] expressed out of the believer
[1:06:47] to meet that need that can stand in the
[1:06:50] gap at that moment
[1:06:52] just like moses when god said i will
[1:06:55] destroy
[1:06:55] all of all of israel and i'll start
[1:06:58] afresh with you moses
[1:06:59] and there was an attribute in moses that
[1:07:02] when that
[1:07:03] happened had to express itself and say
[1:07:05] oh god take me and
[1:07:07] be far be it from you god to do that and
[1:07:10] what was it it was an
[1:07:11] attribute of jesus christ manifesting
[1:07:15] itself in that moment
[1:07:17] and i believe that is the portion for
[1:07:19] every believer you may not be the
[1:07:21] fullness of it but i want you to think
[1:07:23] about even the the situation where
[1:07:25] brother bran we've all heard the story i
[1:07:27] believe
[1:07:28] when brother brandon was in the meeting
[1:07:30] and
[1:07:32] the sister came up and wanted prayer for
[1:07:35] her little baby
[1:07:36] and brother ram said you know that
[1:07:38] baby's already healed
[1:07:40] that sister right there prayed for a
[1:07:42] little while ago and god healed the baby
[1:07:44] what was it that sister had a pool
[1:07:48] there was something on the inside of her
[1:07:50] there was
[1:07:51] there was a an expression an attribute a
[1:07:54] characteristic of god of healing
[1:07:57] that wanted to manifest itself through
[1:08:00] that sister
[1:08:02] not through the prophet but through that
[1:08:04] sister
[1:08:05] god wanted to manifest healing to that
[1:08:09] child and to
[1:08:10] the child's mother to show that god is
[1:08:13] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:08:14] jesus christ the same
[1:08:16] wanted to show that just as it was when
[1:08:19] paul when peter was walking through the
[1:08:22] street he said silver and gold have i
[1:08:23] none
[1:08:24] but such as i have i give to you what
[1:08:26] was it you said that
[1:08:27] such as i have i have healing
[1:08:31] in me by the grace of the lord jesus
[1:08:35] there is healing in me not because i
[1:08:38] have anything
[1:08:39] not because i am anything in it of
[1:08:41] myself but because
[1:08:43] i believe that god has filled me with
[1:08:45] the spirit
[1:08:46] god has sealed me with the holy ghost
[1:08:48] god has put his attribute in me
[1:08:50] and and recognize that that's who i am
[1:08:54] there is a god that can meet the need
[1:08:57] and he's chosen me
[1:08:59] to be the one right now that can that
[1:09:01] can meet that need
[1:09:06] so brother branham says
[1:09:09] well that sister already prayed and you
[1:09:11] see how the devil fights
[1:09:13] and says oh i couldn't pray for that
[1:09:15] maybe she came to
[1:09:17] be prayed for by the prophet see that's
[1:09:19] what the devil's trick is when it comes
[1:09:20] to the body
[1:09:22] it's oh i you know maybe maybe that
[1:09:24] sister was just a little
[1:09:26] pinky toe when he say see we're always
[1:09:29] trying to rank things
[1:09:31] one's better than the other and that's i
[1:09:33] believe that that's just uh that's just
[1:09:34] something that gentiles do i believe is
[1:09:36] that
[1:09:36] the gentiles they always try to exercise
[1:09:38] dominion one over the other and the
[1:09:39] scripture says
[1:09:40] the gentiles they always try to exercise
[1:09:42] dominion whatever they're always
[1:09:43] trying to get one over on each other and
[1:09:45] the struggle for power
[1:09:47] and we fight that as people where we're
[1:09:50] always trying to compare ourselves one
[1:09:51] with another
[1:09:52] and you're trying to judge who you are
[1:09:54] based on who someone else is
[1:09:56] that's not going to work it's not good
[1:09:58] it's not right it'll only put you down
[1:10:00] as spiraling a spiraling downward spiral
[1:10:03] down to hell
[1:10:04] and misery and and absolute depression
[1:10:08] but if we don't compare ourselves to
[1:10:10] jesus christ
[1:10:12] if we'd all just stop trying to measure
[1:10:14] ourselves
[1:10:15] by by false measuring sticks
[1:10:18] i don't measure my life by the life of a
[1:10:21] prophet
[1:10:22] i don't measure my life against the life
[1:10:25] of brother bang
[1:10:26] or sister wendy i measure my life by the
[1:10:29] word of god
[1:10:30] i measure my life by jesus christ and
[1:10:33] him alone
[1:10:34] he is the only measuring stick that
[1:10:37] matters
[1:10:41] because if you're measuring yourself by
[1:10:43] me you might get to a place
[1:10:45] where you're satisfied with where you're
[1:10:47] at right
[1:10:50] you don't see me well enough to know all
[1:10:52] the struggles i got
[1:10:54] see you get a glimpse of me every once
[1:10:57] in a while
[1:10:58] and say oh if i could just be like that
[1:11:00] brother or put someone else here
[1:11:02] you know if i could just be like brother
[1:11:03] jesse and brother jesse is a wonderful
[1:11:06] brother
[1:11:07] but he's a man of like passions
[1:11:09] everybody's got their struggles i have
[1:11:11] my struggles
[1:11:12] you have your struggles and if you're
[1:11:14] measuring this what we call it uh i
[1:11:16] believe they call it's a rubber ruler
[1:11:18] it'll it'll never work it's too flexible
[1:11:21] it's too bendy
[1:11:22] you need to have something that doesn't
[1:11:24] move you need to have something that's
[1:11:25] unchanging
[1:11:26] you need to have a measuring stick that
[1:11:28] doesn't that does that just straight as
[1:11:30] an arrow
[1:11:31] it has no pen to it at all and that's
[1:11:33] the word of god
[1:11:34] i am i am the lord god i am the god of
[1:11:37] my i don't change
[1:11:38] he doesn't change he's the same
[1:11:41] yesterday and forever
[1:11:42] amen but we get so busy looking at each
[1:11:47] other
[1:11:48] comparing ourselves one with another and
[1:11:50] that's where the devil gets us
[1:11:53] and he makes you unfruitful because now
[1:11:56] you can't measure up to whatever the
[1:11:58] devil has put in your mind
[1:12:01] of what you're supposed to measure up to
[1:12:02] now when in reality
[1:12:05] we ought to all realize that we've all
[1:12:07] come short of the glory of god
[1:12:09] but by the blood of jesus christ he has
[1:12:12] perfected us
[1:12:14] in the name of jesus christ we've been
[1:12:17] accepted
[1:12:17] in the beloved amen and now i don't have
[1:12:21] any conscience of those things anymore
[1:12:23] i don't have to i don't have to live
[1:12:25] with the guilt anymore
[1:12:27] i don't have to think so little of
[1:12:30] myself anymore
[1:12:31] yes according to the flesh i'm nothing
[1:12:33] this flesh is rotten
[1:12:34] it's my worst enemy but in the spirit
[1:12:36] man on the inside man
[1:12:38] the one that would seal the way it
[1:12:40] believes every word of god
[1:12:41] i know i can stand and go boldly before
[1:12:44] the throne of grace
[1:12:45] and ask whatever i have need of and god
[1:12:48] will bring it to pass if i have need of
[1:12:49] it because he promised it to be so and
[1:12:52] there's nothing between me and my savior
[1:12:56] because i don't have to measure myself
[1:12:58] to the to the life of brother amen
[1:13:00] and say oh if i could just get like him
[1:13:02] and just live that way
[1:13:04] maybe something would change nothing's
[1:13:06] going to change
[1:13:07] until you realize that we've all come
[1:13:10] short and that jesus christ is the only
[1:13:12] one to measure up to
[1:13:14] we've spent so much time trying to
[1:13:16] measure up to a prophet
[1:13:19] he's not the measuring stick
[1:13:22] amen the word is the measuring stick
[1:13:28] and we've got to take that and run with
[1:13:29] it
[1:13:31] because a man will fail you every time
[1:13:34] a man will fail you every time so the
[1:13:36] devil gets on this woman
[1:13:38] well i say gets on this woman tries to
[1:13:40] really influence her and say oh well you
[1:13:42] shouldn't go pray because she came to
[1:13:43] she came to get prayed for my brother
[1:13:45] and she
[1:13:46] and it just tugged on her and took down
[1:13:48] her and jumped on her jesus you know
[1:13:49] what
[1:13:50] i just got to clear my conscience and
[1:13:52] i'm just going to go do it
[1:13:53] so it's done even if it doesn't do
[1:13:55] anything you know that's the attitude we
[1:13:56] have sometimes
[1:13:57] the lord will put something on your
[1:13:58] heart and it just sits there and it
[1:14:00] weighs heavier and heavier
[1:14:01] and finally say fine lord i'll do it i
[1:14:04] don't feel like i
[1:14:05] maybe should i don't feel worthy you're
[1:14:07] not worthy
[1:14:08] it doesn't matter according to the flesh
[1:14:09] you'll never be worthy we're counting
[1:14:11] like what did we say yesterday
[1:14:12] it's not that you can achieve it's not
[1:14:14] that you can overcome
[1:14:16] it's the fact that he already overcame
[1:14:18] for you it's not that you are perfect
[1:14:21] it's the fact that you have been
[1:14:22] accepted in his perfect
[1:14:24] in his perfection you have literally
[1:14:28] become
[1:14:29] his righteousness and he took
[1:14:32] our sin upon you or him you're sitting
[1:14:35] upon him i should say forgive me
[1:14:38] so she's fighting with this if i said
[1:14:40] it's fine i just go pray for
[1:14:42] probably didn't feel anything probably
[1:14:44] didn't think anything of it
[1:14:46] just said okay thank you lord i got that
[1:14:48] off my mind not even knowing
[1:14:49] that the baby was healed and then here
[1:14:52] comes
[1:14:53] the lord has to go through the prophet
[1:14:56] because people haven't been able to see
[1:14:58] this for themselves
[1:14:59] so the lord has to use the prophet to
[1:15:01] explain
[1:15:03] that that's not a bad thing
[1:15:07] i will sit there all you know the lord
[1:15:09] puts it on your heart to pray for
[1:15:10] someone
[1:15:12] oh i don't you know maybe i shouldn't
[1:15:15] you know that's the pastor's job to pray
[1:15:17] for him or something you know we get
[1:15:18] these ideas in our head of
[1:15:20] of what these things are and no each one
[1:15:22] of you
[1:15:23] is a member of that body
[1:15:26] each one it's not healing power
[1:15:29] it does not just rest in one individual
[1:15:32] it doesn't rest just in one office
[1:15:35] it rests with jesus christ in him alone
[1:15:38] that power and deliverance the same way
[1:15:40] the power of salvation the same way
[1:15:43] it doesn't just rest in one person it
[1:15:46] doesn't just rest in
[1:15:47] some what we call special class of
[1:15:50] people like ministers or
[1:15:51] or song leaders or whatever or whatever
[1:15:54] names that we give to offices
[1:15:56] it doesn't just rest there but but
[1:15:58] salvation it belongs to the people of
[1:16:00] god
[1:16:01] all of these attributes belong to the
[1:16:04] children
[1:16:04] and to the people of god amen
[1:16:08] i've said it a lot of times like one of
[1:16:10] my greatest things that i desire to see
[1:16:12] is to see the people of god empowered
[1:16:16] amen to to live their life for jesus
[1:16:19] christ
[1:16:20] to not to not sit there and let the
[1:16:23] devil drag him down
[1:16:24] and make him think like they can't do
[1:16:26] anything about the situation
[1:16:28] it's not about whether you can it's
[1:16:30] whether you can just believe
[1:16:32] that jesus christ is the master of every
[1:16:35] situation
[1:16:36] he's the master of all the situations
[1:16:38] you can come into contact with
[1:16:40] it doesn't matter it really doesn't
[1:16:42] matter what it looks like
[1:16:44] but if you could believe this word if
[1:16:46] you can trust in him
[1:16:48] he'll bring it to pass
[1:16:52] we get ourselves comparing but she prays
[1:16:54] and brother brown says well that
[1:16:56] the sister prayed for you already you
[1:16:58] know and the one with the baby didn't
[1:17:00] know
[1:17:01] didn't know you know maybe if we were
[1:17:04] more more
[1:17:05] sanctified or i should say maybe more
[1:17:07] more really consecrated i think it's the
[1:17:09] better word
[1:17:10] if we were more consecrated and really
[1:17:12] in the presence of god where we were
[1:17:14] just really in the channel of being able
[1:17:15] to hear from the lord
[1:17:17] all the time where we ought to be you
[1:17:18] know it's it's difficult in this age
[1:17:21] especially
[1:17:21] so many voices and atmospheres
[1:17:23] everywhere just bombarding everything
[1:17:25] but i wonder i almost wonder if maybe if
[1:17:28] we were just
[1:17:29] really right in tune with the spirit of
[1:17:31] god that that sister might have known
[1:17:34] when she when that sister prayed for oh
[1:17:36] it's over
[1:17:37] it's over but see the lord uses those
[1:17:40] as examples for us to understand
[1:17:46] so god is looking to express
[1:17:49] himself through you not just the pastor
[1:17:54] we want to keep everything on the
[1:17:55] pastures we want to keep everything on
[1:17:57] the preachers
[1:17:58] no the the preacher's job if i could say
[1:18:02] just if i could maybe just speak for
[1:18:03] what i
[1:18:04] by the grace of the lord you know
[1:18:06] evangelist job
[1:18:07] is to to reignite the fires
[1:18:11] not just so people can sit there be
[1:18:13] comfortable oh it's nice it's wonderful
[1:18:14] it's not
[1:18:15] but it's to get them so they go out the
[1:18:17] people go out and start setting
[1:18:18] everything else on fire
[1:18:21] we're going to be on firebrand we're
[1:18:23] calling we want to we want to have the
[1:18:25] holy ghost burning so hard
[1:18:26] where it's just you just can't put it
[1:18:29] out it's just
[1:18:30] it's just going and going and going and
[1:18:32] the lord is able to move when he needs
[1:18:34] to move
[1:18:34] he's able to speak when he wants to
[1:18:36] speak when he says something to you
[1:18:38] with no questions asked but when so it's
[1:18:41] easier
[1:18:42] to sit back and put it all on
[1:18:46] a one person or one group of people and
[1:18:48] we got to be careful because that's that
[1:18:49] lickolating spirit
[1:18:51] you know it's so easy to just walk right
[1:18:53] into it because because the devil makes
[1:18:55] it look so appealing
[1:18:56] oh you can be part of this but you
[1:18:58] really don't have to do
[1:18:59] i i and forget i know it's sometimes we
[1:19:02] get
[1:19:03] with this word but you don't have to do
[1:19:04] any work it is
[1:19:06] but there's work to be done there's work
[1:19:09] to be done
[1:19:11] it's not about oh i'm trying to work my
[1:19:14] way into heaven no
[1:19:15] see we've the devil has twisted it up so
[1:19:18] much
[1:19:19] that some of these words become bad
[1:19:20] words to us you know but but if we're
[1:19:23] if we're called to be christians in this
[1:19:25] hour when we are we're called to be the
[1:19:27] bride of jesus christ
[1:19:28] we're called to express this word then
[1:19:30] there's work to be done
[1:19:33] james james i believe he was the one who
[1:19:35] said he said you show me your faith
[1:19:37] without works
[1:19:38] i'll show you my faith by my works
[1:19:41] so it's it and that's not the fact that
[1:19:43] works save me
[1:19:46] but it's an answer of my conscience in
[1:19:48] who i
[1:19:49] am that if if if
[1:19:52] the spirit of god dwells in me that i
[1:19:55] would i have to work the works of god
[1:19:57] because it's who i am now there's no
[1:20:00] other choice
[1:20:01] it's like i my brother brandon explained
[1:20:04] it and said if the spirit of beethoven
[1:20:05] was in me
[1:20:06] then i'd write i'd write concertos
[1:20:09] i'd write symphonies why because that
[1:20:12] spirit
[1:20:13] that life that was in beethoven had
[1:20:16] attributes
[1:20:17] to be gifted at music so much so that my
[1:20:20] historical understanding was he was
[1:20:21] basically mostly deaf
[1:20:23] and yet he was able to write music why
[1:20:25] because there were attributes in him to
[1:20:27] do that
[1:20:28] to write great music that they still
[1:20:30] talk about hundreds and hundreds and
[1:20:31] hundreds of years later
[1:20:33] and if if it be that way it wasn't that
[1:20:36] he was just doing it because
[1:20:39] maybe he just felt he needed to it was
[1:20:42] part of him to do it
[1:20:44] and so is it with the people of god if
[1:20:46] the spirit of christ being you
[1:20:48] that it can't help but work the works of
[1:20:50] god
[1:20:52] and it's not that we do things in order
[1:20:54] to be saved
[1:20:55] in fact that because there's no work you
[1:20:57] can do but because
[1:20:59] we are saved we work the works of god
[1:21:02] don't be weary in well-doing and that's
[1:21:04] what we get many times is we just get
[1:21:05] weary of it
[1:21:06] but he said true religion to visit the
[1:21:09] widows and to visit the orphans
[1:21:11] and to help those that are in need if
[1:21:13] you say you know someone says i have
[1:21:14] need
[1:21:15] it said bless may the lord's blessings
[1:21:18] be upon you go be
[1:21:19] clothed and fed and you just send them
[1:21:22] on their way
[1:21:23] well what good does that do that there
[1:21:25] needs to be something done about it
[1:21:27] there's an actual work to do oh well you
[1:21:30] can say oh
[1:21:32] oh lord may your spirit just witness to
[1:21:34] the people
[1:21:35] and you don't ever go out and talk about
[1:21:37] the lord jesus
[1:21:38] well then what's it gonna do what's it
[1:21:41] gonna do
[1:21:42] there's a work to me you show me your
[1:21:44] faith without works
[1:21:45] i'll show you my faith by my works by
[1:21:48] the way i live my life
[1:21:50] will express that and that's what god is
[1:21:52] looking to do if the attributes are
[1:21:54] there
[1:21:55] it if the life of god is there then it
[1:21:57] will express
[1:21:58] itself through you amen
[1:22:09] it says lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:22:11] recover
[1:22:12] if two or three of or if if two or three
[1:22:15] of you agree on anything in my name i'll
[1:22:18] do it
[1:22:20] though these are the things that they're
[1:22:22] simple things
[1:22:23] they're very they're very just very easy
[1:22:26] to really to do
[1:22:28] because it comes natural but so many
[1:22:30] times we get caught up in
[1:22:32] oh well should i do this or should i do
[1:22:34] that and am i just am i doing it because
[1:22:37] i just know i ought to well yes you are
[1:22:39] doing it because you that's who you
[1:22:41] are and you know you want to do it but
[1:22:43] the devil tries to come right around so
[1:22:45] remember you always start to play both
[1:22:46] sides of the argument
[1:22:47] he says oh you shouldn't do it because
[1:22:49] you know you don't need to prove
[1:22:50] anything
[1:22:51] you know you're saved you don't need to
[1:22:53] prove that you're saved it's not about
[1:22:54] proving that i'm saved
[1:22:55] i don't need to prove it to anybody in
[1:22:57] fact many times it's the lord
[1:22:59] that needs to prove it to us what what
[1:23:02] who we are
[1:23:02] and these different things he's already
[1:23:04] spoken about you it's i don't have to
[1:23:06] prove anything
[1:23:07] except that i i just had to live my life
[1:23:10] for him
[1:23:10] and he'll make the proof i don't i don't
[1:23:14] i you know even me i'd say coming here i
[1:23:17] don't come here
[1:23:18] to minister to prove anything i just
[1:23:20] come to be
[1:23:21] lord willing a blessing because it seems
[1:23:23] to be my my
[1:23:24] my post of duty to be you know that and
[1:23:27] it's not anything to puff
[1:23:28] any person up or anything but it's but
[1:23:31] these things
[1:23:32] if though it were to do any of the works
[1:23:35] when it comes to the to the simple
[1:23:36] everyday things where would we be
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:39] where would we be we but that's but
[1:23:41] that's what it is we drop the ball on a
[1:23:43] lot of those things because we're
[1:23:44] we're just content to say well i'm not
[1:23:46] that part of the body
[1:23:48] it must be someone else's job
[1:23:55] you forgive me i just kind of got we
[1:23:57] just went in a totally different
[1:23:59] direction this evening i was
[1:24:01] playing my plan was something else and
[1:24:03] the lord had a different plan so
[1:24:05] you know we praise the lord for that you
[1:24:08] know
[1:24:10] the people of god i believe should be
[1:24:13] empowered
[1:24:14] to understand that you have the devil's
[1:24:17] answer
[1:24:18] amen you have the answer to the devil's
[1:24:22] question
[1:24:24] when the devil when the devil comes and
[1:24:25] says oh there's this situation in your
[1:24:28] life
[1:24:29] maybe you know sickness or something and
[1:24:32] it doesn't look like there's
[1:24:33] any there's any there's any way out
[1:24:36] that bride has the devil's answer you
[1:24:40] have the devil's answer
[1:24:42] because the word's already spoken he's
[1:24:44] the lord that heals you
[1:24:46] he heals all your diseases when you have
[1:24:50] need of something in the natural jehovah
[1:24:52] jireh he will provide
[1:24:54] amen he will provide for him his own
[1:24:56] he'll provide for himself
[1:24:58] a sacrifice he'll provide for you
[1:24:59] whatever you need
[1:25:01] whatever you have need of not
[1:25:03] necessarily always what you want
[1:25:04] but what you need
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:07] and so i guess just in closing this will
[1:25:10] be a short service this evening i just
[1:25:11] kind of feel like to stop there
[1:25:13] uh but
[1:25:17] god is wanting to express himself
[1:25:19] through each and every one of his people
[1:25:22] he's not looking it's not if the lord
[1:25:25] wanted
[1:25:26] the animals to preach the gospel he
[1:25:28] would have done it
[1:25:30] if he wanted the sky to to just
[1:25:33] to to be speaking down to the people and
[1:25:35] the thunderous voices to come down or
[1:25:38] or angels to manifest themselves in
[1:25:40] those ways he would have done that
[1:25:42] if he wanted you know if he wanted the
[1:25:45] inanimate objects to preach the gospel
[1:25:47] he could do it
[1:25:48] the lord said if you if you silence
[1:25:49] thieves he says god's able to be stoned
[1:25:51] to raise up children to abraham he said
[1:25:53] if you silence thieves that are trying
[1:25:54] to praise he said the very rocks would
[1:25:56] cry out
[1:25:58] he's able to do it but god had purpose
[1:26:00] in himself
[1:26:01] that he would use man to express himself
[1:26:06] and that's what he's desiring to do so
[1:26:08] when you come up against situations
[1:26:10] in your life when you come up against
[1:26:13] that person at your job
[1:26:15] that just seems tormented or or or wants
[1:26:18] to torment you
[1:26:20] for whatever reason as we said yesterday
[1:26:23] you know
[1:26:23] just if the world hate you just remember
[1:26:26] it hated the lord jesus first
[1:26:29] so when you come up these situations
[1:26:31] that people hate you without a cause
[1:26:32] you have that attribute of peace
[1:26:36] inside of you you have a characteristic
[1:26:40] of god
[1:26:40] that is wanting to see god doesn't let
[1:26:42] things just happen by accident
[1:26:45] we're not just blindly stumbling through
[1:26:47] life
[1:26:48] just hoping to get to the finish line
[1:26:51] no god has opened our eyes god
[1:26:54] orders the footsteps of the righteous it
[1:26:57] has a plan for your life
[1:26:59] he's sent you on this course and he is
[1:27:02] going to guide you all the way
[1:27:05] if you let him most of the problems we
[1:27:08] come into
[1:27:08] is because we get off track we ignore
[1:27:12] the warnings in the voice of god
[1:27:14] but god when he brings things to your
[1:27:16] life
[1:27:17] obstacles it's because he's trying to
[1:27:20] draw something out of you
[1:27:22] you know he does that even in the church
[1:27:24] god will bring
[1:27:26] people into into the into the local body
[1:27:29] even here
[1:27:32] bride of christ fellowship he'll bring
[1:27:33] ones from all different backgrounds
[1:27:36] different experiences different
[1:27:37] personalities maybe don't even get along
[1:27:40] about certain things according to the
[1:27:41] natural
[1:27:43] one might like bananas and the other one
[1:27:45] is
[1:27:46] maybe even allergic to bananas or what
[1:27:48] one likes this certain thing and the
[1:27:50] other one doesn't like this certain
[1:27:51] thing
[1:27:52] or one's personality it's more like this
[1:27:54] and but the other one seems to kind of
[1:27:56] clash with it in a certain way
[1:27:57] according to the flesh but see by those
[1:28:00] things
[1:28:01] it's like iron sharpening iron
[1:28:04] god is in fact if those things exist
[1:28:07] they're only meant to be used by god to
[1:28:11] form and to shape his people just like
[1:28:14] the devil
[1:28:15] the devil is nothing but a punching bag
[1:28:18] he's nothing but a test giver
[1:28:22] he's nothing but just a constant exam
[1:28:26] in a constant testing ground for the
[1:28:29] people of god
[1:28:30] because the the devil's already been
[1:28:33] overcome
[1:28:34] the work's already been done the devil
[1:28:37] the devil's already been put under our
[1:28:39] feet
[1:28:40] but what does he do it's almost like i
[1:28:42] mean forgive me i know maybe it sounds
[1:28:43] really crude but
[1:28:44] i've heard that that in even in nature
[1:28:47] that
[1:28:47] that animals well to teach their young
[1:28:50] how to hunt
[1:28:51] will bring injured animals to them to
[1:28:54] teach the young ones
[1:28:56] how to kill the animal and how to how to
[1:28:58] hunt and eat it
[1:28:59] and in a way that's what god the great
[1:29:03] the great
[1:29:04] lion of the tribe of judah has done for
[1:29:06] his children
[1:29:08] if he's already wounded and already
[1:29:10] bruised the head of the devil
[1:29:12] and all that all god's done with his
[1:29:15] trials come into your life
[1:29:16] if he just dragged that part out you
[1:29:18] almost feel sorry for him
[1:29:20] almost is when he he drags that old
[1:29:23] devil
[1:29:24] over to you and says no no
[1:29:27] now son or daughter i want you to finish
[1:29:30] him off
[1:29:31] i want you to show this devil what i'm
[1:29:33] going to teach i taught you how to do it
[1:29:35] you finish them off and so many times we
[1:29:39] going to
[1:29:39] to do that and the devil goes boo and
[1:29:41] tries to scare us off no
[1:29:42] we got to press on and understand that
[1:29:45] that
[1:29:46] uh our jehovah god our great father
[1:29:49] our heavenly father's already done the
[1:29:50] work for us
[1:29:53] the enemy's already been slain and
[1:29:54] beaten
[1:29:56] but he's looking for us to he wants us
[1:29:58] that's why we're more than overcomers
[1:30:00] we're more than conquerors
[1:30:02] because he's already done the work he's
[1:30:04] already
[1:30:05] done the hard part he's already done the
[1:30:07] hard thing
[1:30:08] he he sacrificed himself for you so you
[1:30:11] can have that victory and now he's
[1:30:13] dragged the devil by the scruff of his
[1:30:15] neck
[1:30:15] over to you and says now now not my son
[1:30:18] or daughter you finish him off
[1:30:20] and sure as we go on maybe the the
[1:30:23] the philistines we're facing get a
[1:30:26] little bit bigger
[1:30:26] they look a little bit more a little bit
[1:30:28] more intimidating
[1:30:29] why it's just the lord just teaching you
[1:30:32] that no matter what the situation
[1:30:34] looks like just like david how he could
[1:30:36] look back and say
[1:30:37] just like i killed the lion just like i
[1:30:39] slew the bear
[1:30:40] this this uncircumcised philistine can't
[1:30:43] do anything against the armies of the
[1:30:44] living god amen
[1:30:46] and so what is god doing he'll be
[1:30:48] bringing these things into your life
[1:30:49] and he's just trying to say i watch you
[1:30:52] i put it in you
[1:30:54] just like to that little lion cub that
[1:30:56] mama said in you
[1:30:58] is to be this hunter to slay to eat the
[1:31:02] game
[1:31:03] and god is trying to tell you i put it
[1:31:06] in you
[1:31:07] to be that eagle now to eat to
[1:31:11] to hunt to take out that devil to be
[1:31:13] able to see with
[1:31:14] with clear vision what what where where
[1:31:17] we're at
[1:31:18] and who you are and he's wanting you
[1:31:21] to grab hold of it it's not that i am
[1:31:24] doing it
[1:31:25] but i have confidence in the fact that
[1:31:27] he's already done it
[1:31:30] just like it's just like i i'd always
[1:31:32] say we're closing but it just seems like
[1:31:33] the lord inspires it
[1:31:35] but you just see the truth of it when
[1:31:36] you look all the way back
[1:31:38] even with moses god had given him the
[1:31:40] commission there in the backside of the
[1:31:42] desert he said
[1:31:43] i have come i've heard the cries of my
[1:31:45] people i've come down to deliver them
[1:31:47] and now i'm sending you so go gives him
[1:31:50] all the signs
[1:31:51] gives him all the wonders and what is
[1:31:52] that he's doing all these things
[1:31:54] training moses he'd already been through
[1:31:56] 40 years in the wilderness of training
[1:31:58] now he's even training him more as he
[1:32:00] goes and finally they get to the red sea
[1:32:02] and now it looks you know the
[1:32:06] the lord was bringing up those little
[1:32:08] weak
[1:32:09] weak looking devils and moses was just
[1:32:12] slaying them
[1:32:13] just slaying them just slaying them and
[1:32:15] all of a sudden maybe they look a little
[1:32:17] bit they look a little bit more
[1:32:18] intimidating
[1:32:19] when the death angel comes down but
[1:32:21] moses said i'm sticking with that word
[1:32:23] we're going to kill the passover we're
[1:32:25] going to follow the word of god slaves
[1:32:27] that one
[1:32:27] moves on and now all of a sudden he kind
[1:32:30] of gets to his goliath
[1:32:32] and there's the red sea standing in
[1:32:33] front of him and even moses
[1:32:36] he's not even service training anymore
[1:32:38] you would think after all that they had
[1:32:40] been through
[1:32:42] he would have had the confidence
[1:32:45] maybe not even knowing how to do it
[1:32:47] necessarily
[1:32:49] but knowing that god could do it but he
[1:32:52] he despairs and says what are we going
[1:32:53] to do
[1:32:54] and god the lord has to just like he
[1:32:56] does to us he says
[1:32:57] i thought i told you already
[1:33:00] you i've come to deliver the people i've
[1:33:03] sent you you have the commission
[1:33:05] you have the need you are that situation
[1:33:08] but speak
[1:33:09] and go forward amen why
[1:33:12] because it may look big but your
[1:33:15] situation
[1:33:16] may look a lot bigger we're getting word
[1:33:18] to a place
[1:33:19] at this end right before a rapture where
[1:33:22] these those two hundred
[1:33:23] thousand thousands out of the river
[1:33:24] euphrates all those demons loose
[1:33:26] ancient demons that's what i think we've
[1:33:28] called them these ancient demons from
[1:33:30] antilluvian times
[1:33:31] they look so big but i tell you what
[1:33:34] brothers and sisters
[1:33:35] they are just as defeated as that little
[1:33:38] demon that you never feared before in
[1:33:40] your life
[1:33:41] they are just as much under your feet
[1:33:43] they are just as much defeated
[1:33:45] the only question is do you believe the
[1:33:48] commission
[1:33:48] that god has given to you not just
[1:33:51] giving it to
[1:33:52] the preacher not just giving it to
[1:33:54] brother branham as a prophet
[1:33:56] not just giving it to this one or that
[1:33:58] one but giving it to you
[1:34:00] you have the authority
[1:34:03] you have the power in the name of jesus
[1:34:06] christ
[1:34:06] to slay the enemy
[1:34:11] because he's already dead the lord just
[1:34:14] wants you
[1:34:15] to finish the job he's already been
[1:34:18] defeated
[1:34:19] the enemy's already been defeated if we
[1:34:23] could really get that revelation
[1:34:26] if we could really get that revelation
[1:34:29] the enemy has already been defeated
[1:34:32] all you got to do is speak and go
[1:34:33] forward
[1:34:35] yeah it might not make any sense
[1:34:37] sometimes in the natural
[1:34:38] you may not understand it many times you
[1:34:40] won't understand it
[1:34:42] but the enemy's already been defeated
[1:34:45] all we got to do is understand that
[1:34:47] it's our inheritance it is our calling
[1:34:50] it is our duty to fulfill that now
[1:34:54] and to possess that land and to take
[1:34:57] back
[1:34:59] you know as we sing that song i went to
[1:35:00] the enemies camp and i took back
[1:35:02] what he stole from me it's our duty to
[1:35:04] do so because it wasn't his to begin
[1:35:06] with
[1:35:07] he just a squatter
[1:35:12] you know they still have that today even
[1:35:13] in the natural you know
[1:35:15] i've heard i've heard people pull those
[1:35:16] scams people go traveling for
[1:35:19] period to time they come back and there
[1:35:21] are people living in their house
[1:35:24] person unlocks the door they find they
[1:35:26] can't unlock the door because the locks
[1:35:27] are all changed
[1:35:28] someone came while they were gone and
[1:35:30] just lived in their house
[1:35:32] and and they this is my house and the
[1:35:34] person sitting in there is a squatter
[1:35:35] says no it isn't it's my house
[1:35:37] i don't know it's my house they said no
[1:35:39] it's not it's my house prove it
[1:35:41] and what do they got to do they got to
[1:35:42] go all the way back
[1:35:44] and they got to try to prove it well
[1:35:46] that's what the devil does with us
[1:35:48] trying to say you come to that healing
[1:35:50] and he's just sitting there on the
[1:35:51] healing
[1:35:51] so no this is mine you can't have it no
[1:35:54] that's my healing i see it right here
[1:35:55] take it back to the word it's yours
[1:35:58] it's yours the victory's already won
[1:36:01] there's nothing to fear
[1:36:03] there's nothing to worry about don't
[1:36:05] don't be looking to fill someone else's
[1:36:07] place
[1:36:07] fill the place god has for you because
[1:36:11] god has a place for you
[1:36:14] be make your calling and election sure
[1:36:17] and then wait on your ministry find out
[1:36:20] what the lord has for you
[1:36:23] in the meantime you know many times
[1:36:26] we're so busy looking to do what we call
[1:36:29] the great things so many want to preach
[1:36:32] or somebody want to do this and so many
[1:36:33] want to do that and so
[1:36:34] they're a preacher they want to they
[1:36:36] want to sing or they want to
[1:36:38] they want to be they want to be a a
[1:36:40] missionary or this and those are
[1:36:42] wonderful ideas to have if it's
[1:36:45] what the lord has for you i don't know
[1:36:48] but
[1:36:48] so many times we've elevated certain
[1:36:50] things into certain places
[1:36:53] when god says no i i want you to be
[1:36:55] right here
[1:36:57] i want you to be right here at this post
[1:36:59] of duty because this is what i've called
[1:37:00] for you
[1:37:02] and said instead of doing that and to
[1:37:04] god that's great
[1:37:06] because it's great when you can stay in
[1:37:08] the will of god
[1:37:09] when you can stay in the perfect will of
[1:37:11] god god calls that great
[1:37:13] not what you can imagine for yourself
[1:37:16] david wanted to build a temple unto the
[1:37:18] lord it was a good idea
[1:37:21] it wasn't a bad idea it was inspired
[1:37:27] but it wasn't for him to do it was for
[1:37:29] his son to do
[1:37:31] and so what did he do what instead of
[1:37:34] trying to find a way around it he
[1:37:37] accepted the word of the lord
[1:37:39] and he did what he could to as we put
[1:37:41] our shoulder to the wheel put his
[1:37:43] shoulder to the wheel
[1:37:43] so he started laying up some of the
[1:37:45] things started trying to prepare
[1:37:48] maybe something for it in the future
[1:37:50] saying lord i'll do what i can i know
[1:37:51] i'm not called to build it
[1:37:52] but maybe we can say it like this maybe
[1:37:54] i'm not called to
[1:37:55] to preach but i'm going to pray for that
[1:37:58] preacher
[1:37:59] oh every day i'm going to pray for my
[1:38:01] pastor and i'm going to get on my i may
[1:38:03] not be called
[1:38:04] to build the temple as it were but i'm
[1:38:06] going to get on my knees and pray
[1:38:08] that the lord gave him the materials to
[1:38:11] build that body
[1:38:12] because that's what god is doing he's
[1:38:14] he's fitly joining together
[1:38:16] building this body together saying look
[1:38:18] get on your knees and pray
[1:38:19] lord give him the material give him the
[1:38:21] word to speak give him the inspiration
[1:38:23] give him the songs to sing for the song
[1:38:25] leader that's so important
[1:38:28] but we we belittle it because it's our
[1:38:31] the man's ideas of great are are what
[1:38:34] god calls foolish
[1:38:35] man's eye man's idea of great is to be
[1:38:37] in the spotlight
[1:38:39] and to be this great thing god's idea of
[1:38:42] great
[1:38:42] it's like we said john the baptist six
[1:38:44] months and ended with a beheading
[1:38:47] six months of ministry got beheaded
[1:38:51] and jesus called that great but unless
[1:38:54] you have
[1:38:55] a following of hundreds and hundreds of
[1:38:57] thousands and thousands and
[1:38:59] all these certain things happening no
[1:39:01] miracles done in the ministry of john
[1:39:02] the baptist
[1:39:04] and yet god called it great so instead
[1:39:07] of
[1:39:08] letting the devil work on our minds of
[1:39:11] trying to convince us
[1:39:12] who who we think we should be let's be
[1:39:15] what god has actually called us to be
[1:39:18] let's do what god has called us to do
[1:39:21] you say well i don't know what i can do
[1:39:23] well i tell you what
[1:39:24] you can pray pray without ceasing you
[1:39:27] look at the word
[1:39:28] if remember brother branham gave us the
[1:39:30] template he said if god puts it on your
[1:39:31] heart to do something first look in the
[1:39:33] word
[1:39:34] is it in the word and if your motive and
[1:39:36] objective's right and it's in the word
[1:39:38] and you fit the qualifications or
[1:39:40] whatever it might be if you're in the
[1:39:41] place to do it
[1:39:42] then then go forward but but if but if
[1:39:46] you find well i don't know
[1:39:47] well like we said you know what about
[1:39:50] visiting the widows and the sick
[1:39:52] who oh see well that's the kind old
[1:39:54] priest well now you're going right back
[1:39:55] to that old catholic mentality
[1:39:58] that old pharisee sadducee mentality
[1:40:00] well that's the that's the
[1:40:01] that's the minister's job well are we
[1:40:04] not all ministers
[1:40:06] have we not all been called kings and
[1:40:07] priests in the sense that god has called
[1:40:09] us to be intercessors
[1:40:13] he's called us all to be able to bear
[1:40:15] that light
[1:40:17] to bear the light of the gospel to live
[1:40:19] a life
[1:40:20] sisters well as we said you know maybe i
[1:40:23] maybe i think you know this is just my
[1:40:25] own thinking so don't think i'm trying
[1:40:26] to make a doctrine out of it but i i
[1:40:28] even now it just inspired me to think
[1:40:30] that maybe one of the reasons
[1:40:33] the lord allowed sisters to have such a
[1:40:35] visual impact
[1:40:37] as far as their testimony is because the
[1:40:39] lord has not called them to preach
[1:40:41] verbally behind a pulpit
[1:40:44] so as we said yesterday that light that
[1:40:47] you're shining sisters is so great
[1:40:49] and you don't even know because you're
[1:40:50] in the light you know the the devil
[1:40:53] tries to you know he makes us blind he
[1:40:55] we're blind to it most of the time
[1:40:57] because oh this is just this is the life
[1:40:58] that the lord's given us and this is
[1:41:00] what we do
[1:41:01] but that light is great so let that
[1:41:03] light shine
[1:41:07] what about helping out the needy all
[1:41:10] these little things
[1:41:11] that oh well someone else will do that
[1:41:14] no god's called the believer to do that
[1:41:17] he's called us to fulfill that
[1:41:19] that's james said that that was pure
[1:41:21] religion and undefiled
[1:41:24] so if we we want to be believers let's
[1:41:26] let's fulfill our portion
[1:41:28] each one of us has a part to play
[1:41:29] there's no big eyes little used when it
[1:41:31] all comes down to it we're all saved
[1:41:33] by the same blood filled with the same
[1:41:36] spirit
[1:41:37] we're all we're all praising the same
[1:41:38] lord jesus we're looking
[1:41:40] for that same city whose builder and
[1:41:42] maker is god
[1:41:44] amen let's all stand
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:49] i trust is an encouragement to you like
[1:41:52] i said i
[1:41:53] really just my desire is to see i want
[1:41:55] to see the people of god empowered
[1:41:57] in the spirit of god it is by empowered
[1:42:00] us not to mean to walk around
[1:42:02] you know laying hands on everybody and
[1:42:04] miracles happening i want to see those
[1:42:05] things too
[1:42:07] but empowered to understand we and we
[1:42:10] need that revelation
[1:42:12] we understand that of who we are of what
[1:42:14] our real position is
[1:42:15] what the the ivf uh full revelation
[1:42:19] of the atonement that jesus christ gave
[1:42:22] on calvary
[1:42:25] forgive me if it seemed a little bit
[1:42:26] chopped up there i just went a totally
[1:42:28] different direction from what
[1:42:30] was even in the notes or i had a thought
[1:42:32] of but we just trust it was a blessing
[1:42:34] to you
[1:42:35] let's just bow our heads inward for and
[1:42:37] then we'll have brother amen uh
[1:42:38] close with a few songs here again
[1:42:42] we just keep everybody in prayer that
[1:42:43] might be battling with the sicknesses
[1:42:45] and stuff
[1:42:46] you know it's um it's an interesting
[1:42:49] thing you know because
[1:42:50] i remember you know hear on the news and
[1:42:52] they everybody you hear on different
[1:42:54] things in the news i think they call it
[1:42:56] for a while they're calling it oh it's
[1:42:59] the unseen enemy the kovac 19 thing the
[1:43:01] unseen enemy and it's just
[1:43:02] it's just a manifestation of what we
[1:43:04] fight every day the unseen enemy
[1:43:07] that old devil that's just trying to
[1:43:08] battle the bride of jesus christ
[1:43:11] but we just pray for all those that may
[1:43:13] you know
[1:43:14] struggling with sickness and all those
[1:43:16] things the lord is a healer
[1:43:18] we thank the lord that as far as we know
[1:43:21] any of those that
[1:43:22] had been sick hadn't been really serious
[1:43:24] like
[1:43:25] you know you hear stories about and
[1:43:26] we're certainly grateful for that but
[1:43:28] even if it was
[1:43:29] you know we don't fear any of these
[1:43:31] things we're more than conquerors
[1:43:34] amen so we're just you know and
[1:43:38] just grateful to uh brother jesse for
[1:43:40] inviting us out here
[1:43:42] and uh just trust everything was a
[1:43:44] blessing to you
[1:43:45] and to all those that might be listening
[1:43:46] on the live stream you know we're
[1:43:48] grateful for the ability to do that
[1:43:49] and um we don't ever want to make that
[1:43:52] uh
[1:43:53] you know don't let the devil try to make
[1:43:55] that a a substitution
[1:43:57] you know the scripture says don't
[1:43:58] forsake the assembling of the saints
[1:44:00] you know the gathering of yourselves
[1:44:02] together we desire to fulfill that word
[1:44:04] of god and come together when when the
[1:44:05] lord
[1:44:06] you know has it done you know brother
[1:44:08] branham said that that true that
[1:44:10] christian desires to be there whenever
[1:44:11] the doors are open
[1:44:12] so you know but we're grateful for when
[1:44:14] these circumstances come that we have
[1:44:16] that
[1:44:16] you know that it's so wonderful to see
[1:44:18] how the lord i
[1:44:20] certainly i appreciate the lord because
[1:44:22] how he takes the devil's own devices
[1:44:25] and he turns it into it he turns it
[1:44:26] against him you know the devil is out
[1:44:28] there
[1:44:28] trying to make these great scientific
[1:44:30] achievements like
[1:44:32] cars and different things yeah sure it
[1:44:33] kills a lot of people but it also allows
[1:44:35] people that might not be able to get to
[1:44:37] church to get there where they couldn't
[1:44:39] have done it before and
[1:44:40] the live stream you know how the devil
[1:44:42] uses technology in such a wicked way
[1:44:44] and and computers and things but the
[1:44:46] lord can use it for good so we praise
[1:44:48] the lord for us to be able to use those
[1:44:49] things for good and
[1:44:52] i believe it was david who used
[1:44:54] goliath's own sword to chop his own head
[1:44:55] off to chop his head off so
[1:44:57] we thank the lord for that our god he's
[1:44:59] he's awesome you know and
[1:45:01] we're grateful for that so let's just
[1:45:02] power ahead in a little prayer
[1:45:04] heavenly father lord we just are
[1:45:06] grateful to you lord for your your
[1:45:08] never-ending mercies lord and your
[1:45:09] faithfulness to your your people
[1:45:12] lord maybe just really broken up and
[1:45:15] maybe didn't have
[1:45:16] maybe singularly a clear direction but
[1:45:18] we just trust oh god that the words that
[1:45:19] were spoken would be a blessing to your
[1:45:20] people
[1:45:21] lord we're desiring lord to find
[1:45:24] ourselves in our position
[1:45:26] and our posted duty lord no matter
[1:45:29] how small it would be i believe david in
[1:45:32] the psalms said that he
[1:45:34] he'd rather be a doorman at the house of
[1:45:36] god than to
[1:45:38] to be a king anywhere else and lord it
[1:45:40] seems like it's an easy thing to say but
[1:45:42] in the natural
[1:45:43] man's desire always seems to be to look
[1:45:45] for that great position
[1:45:47] notoriety and those things but lord help
[1:45:49] us to humble ourselves
[1:45:50] before you lord and lord not to think of
[1:45:53] ourselves any great thing because
[1:45:54] without you we're nothing anyway
[1:45:56] lord if it wasn't for you lord on
[1:45:58] calvary and your blood that was shed and
[1:46:01] lord if it wasn't for the word that you
[1:46:02] spoke of us before the foundation of the
[1:46:04] world and
[1:46:05] knowing us before the foundation of the
[1:46:06] word and writing our names on the lamb's
[1:46:08] book of life
[1:46:09] lord where would we be we wouldn't even
[1:46:11] be here now lord it ought to humble us
[1:46:13] so much lord that we
[1:46:15] lord i even think about how for myself
[1:46:18] just being a
[1:46:19] a person that was born even born in the
[1:46:21] united states lord being able to
[1:46:23] have freedom and and as it were in the
[1:46:26] natural have
[1:46:26] a pretty easy life lord and maybe that
[1:46:28] comes with different burdens that we
[1:46:30] have to bear as
[1:46:31] different struggles and things that the
[1:46:32] devil tries to get but
[1:46:34] lord we just never want to be overlooked
[1:46:36] the things that you've done for us lord
[1:46:38] we have
[1:46:39] a place to gather together this evening
[1:46:41] lord we're able to
[1:46:42] to live stream of service to those who
[1:46:44] aren't able to be here lord and
[1:46:45] we know their earnest desire would be to
[1:46:47] be among the saints
[1:46:49] but oh god you provided a way as you
[1:46:50] always do lord
[1:46:52] but lord let us just go forward
[1:46:55] father in our lives knowing that you
[1:46:57] have already conquered forest father
[1:46:59] that the devil is a defeated being that
[1:47:03] satan has already been defeated
[1:47:05] that all we need to do is walk forward
[1:47:06] in that confidence and
[1:47:08] and trusting in your word lord that
[1:47:10] you've already done the work
[1:47:12] but we're just desiring to be that
[1:47:14] manifestation in this hour to show forth
[1:47:16] your attributes your characteristics
[1:47:18] your character to the world
[1:47:20] lord knowing that when there's a need
[1:47:21] that needs to be met father that
[1:47:24] you placed a spirit and a life in us
[1:47:26] that can meet that need
[1:47:28] lord we don't ever want to puff
[1:47:29] ourselves up lord we want to be humble
[1:47:31] and meek and lowly
[1:47:32] before you father i just pray a special
[1:47:35] blessing upon
[1:47:36] your people lord that would be listening
[1:47:38] lord that you would just
