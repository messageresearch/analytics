TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your co-host Pastor Jesse Smith joined by and I'm Eamon Lee we're happy to be here recording another podcast we're doing part two of our sister Naomi's testimony I'm sure you're blessed by part one and before we get started with part two I just want to share that as we were doing part one and I was listening to the type of testimony God has given our sister I was just thinking about who her testimony would speak to and I thought about Austin's testimony and brother amen's testimony in my own testimony and you know Amen in my testimony we did that first I spoke to people that were raised in denomination and that God can bring us to a greater light and then you know brother Austin's testimony speaks to people who are out in the world and are trapped in demonic oppression or trapped in drug abuse and God is able to reach the very depths of Despair and rescue people out of the depths of Despair and bring them into Marvelous Light the Bible says he saves to the uttermost and it's just a beautiful scripture there in the book of he Hebrews how he ever lives to make intercession Christ is sitting on the throne right now living just Desiring to rescue people whether it's out of denomination or whether it's out of drug abuse or the world and then you know as we're listening to our sister's testimony it just struck me like wow this is a wonderful testimony for all these Saints who have been raised inside the message amen and I Austin were not raising the message but sister Naomi was raising the message a wonderful Message Church where we heard they had discernments and and tongues and interpretations and prophecies a a church where the gifts of the holy spirit were very active which we're very thankful for and so I just was blessed to know that this testimony will be a great help to our young girls in our church and also our young boys in our church that even if you're raising the message it doesn't diminish your testimony at all in fact if you're faithful while you're raising the message or raising the truth your testimony is even greater because it's just like Jesus Christ he he never sinned so he was faithful to God he was faithful the whole time and he's exalted to the highest place in all the universe of course he was without sin but will sin but I just want to just start with that introduction and I think we left off on our sister's testimony about the time she was in senior high or college I think the the term is so pick up right where we left off before we begin first I want to apologize for the low quality of our sister Naomi's voice this is my fault as I forgot to change the audio in setting when we were recording the podcast so please forgive me for that but hopefully you can still hear her voice if you turn up your volume to maximum foreign life so can you share some of the battles you went through in college and some of the things you had to overcome okay so in college I got to college before I turned 17 so I was I was pretty young and once again away from home but then back in back in high school I mean I was I was associated with Christians but who were in denomination so not Christians and messy churches but I got to college and I got I met a few um believers so I was like oh okay cool so I'm not going to be the only one who's going to be in security I mean usually when you get to places you're looking for people who are identify with yourself you're not going to be the only person who is going to be in skirts and stuff like that so I was I was happy about that during the College Years we did not have a church on campus we have this fellowship and then we meet only on Wednesdays then on Sunday we go out to church there were a few churches on campus but they were not messy churches so you have to go out and then go to church I mean like pay for public transportation and sometimes I did not have money like I said we grew up with very little so sometimes I did not have money yet I could not afford to take public transport and go so and I did not want to miss church so I just go to some of the churches around and sometimes in the evening I have like um fellow Believers come to to my to me the Hostile in the acts like why weren't you in church today and I'm like oh I went to church but I went to one of the churches on campus and that's like I had sinned and they say all sorts of things like you shouldn't be doing that you should go to church and it's not like I don't want to go to church but it was because I did not have money for the transportation so I'd rather just stay on campus and walk to church can I ask you where these people and like The Message Church they were asking yes yes message charges there was there were some two were coming from my home Church I mean those were the ones I was close to so those were the ones that would come to my hostel and then say all sorts of things again because and I think it got to a point they felt like I did not believe the message I was falling away so I don't know if it was their way of bringing me back but I mean deep down I knew it wasn't like I was falling away but like I did not I just did not have money and when I go there I see all the things that are wrong I see all the things but of course you pick one or two things that that are good some things they they were pretty sermons that will speak to your heart and but they made it sound like one you cannot once you believe the message you cannot go you just can't go to any other church because they don't have anything there and because of some of these things on Wednesdays when you meet for the fellowships might be past certain comments and makes it feel like you don't know what you're doing like you do not believe the message so I struggled a lot with how we can't accept each other how we can't encourage each other but then amongst our own selves it looks like they had kind of figured out who is who is the Christian who is more message believer and who is not who is like fake and unfortunately I was put in the fake categories one time I remember the way we went to a fellowship and then he was he was like that Patron or something like that and that he was talking about the sisters and those who are believing the message and those who are living a holy life and I wasn't doing anything bad because we're living a holy life and then some of us were not part of it so it was like when the brothers come in they were they're looking for recommendations for wife I know the ones who are marriageable here and those who are not and I'm like so I mean I still went to church though but I still went for the fellowship but I I had my own reservations about it and how we couldn't love one another and how we're able to like be very judgmental and then decide who is more Christian than the other based of what we see when you can see the person's heart because there are a few of them that now have left the message and stuff like that yeah did anyone at any time offer to give you a ride to the message church or offer to give you money so you could go to the right Church no I'm not I'm not too sure what I was doing wrong but people felt like I was I was not in the message I did not believe I don't know I I'm not sure what I was doing wrong that was the General perception about me I'm not too sure it was because I had gone to college I mean there were a lot of sisters in college so I'm not too sure and I mean I grew up in the message but I I never wanted it to be like I'm being forced to do something I don't want to do I always tell my dad I have to understand the reason why I'm doing this I have to understand the reason why I am not doing this so and it wasn't like major sense but like a few little things here and there okay we should do this why should we do this why should we do that so I think probably sometimes when I'm having those conversations with them I'm asking all those Horizons and things like that then it makes it sound like maybe you don't you don't really believe at all so I don't know maybe that's the only thing I can think of no that's good uh I found just in the message you know there's people that have lots of questions and people that don't so God has a variety of people you know some people want to know why other people just say well I'll just believe it they're not very inquisitive I'm I'm the kind like I have lots of questions that's why I like doing questions and answers but uh yeah there's certain people that can be judgmental at times if you don't do everything they want you to do and I you know honestly I and I preached this recently uh I feel like pride is one of the greatest stumbling blocks in the message because we can if we're not careful we can clean the outside of the cup and not clean the inside of the cup uh that's and that's what happens like our like our sister said there was people criticizing her about not going the right church but then later they fall away and she's standing on the word okay so they're obviously the inside of their hearts were not clean but your heart was clean you were doing all you could do and you just wanted to have questions and you just could go where you just went wherever you could go based upon your your financial status which I know God honored that because like brother M said you can't go to the church with the whole loaf of bread go where you can get a slice so you were being uh as a real Christian by just wanting to go to church and making sure you went every Sunday and that's what Jesus modeled in Luke chapter four so one of the things that I can remember I was being criticized about it was they were very hard on your hair as a sister there are certain things you can you can add to your hair they were very practical about the type of hair as a sister you can carry what you should use to braid to the hair and what you shouldn't used to and I wasn't really convinced about it so I did what I believed in then so that was also one of the things that made them come hard Against Me Do they have any scripture for like how you could braid your hair or the standards that they were holding did they point you to any Scripture none that I know so without any Scripture to support their particular guidelines for braiding sister's hair then those guidelines are simply man-made opinions and with all due respect man-made guidelines are man-made standards of course we want to respect other Christian standards but it's sad some people would criticize you for not following their own man-made guidelines you are able to agree to disagree and show respect to those who are criticizing you but in your own heart the Holy Ghost had given you different convictions and so you could only honor the convictions that God had put in your heart the convictions that you understood by the word of God but again God allowed you to go through these tests of criticism as Trials of your faith after you were filled with the holy ghost from a young age we're on 12 years old and by the grace of God you pass those tests foreign anything else you want to share about the college experience if I mean everybody wants to look cute and they're put in all their dresses and stuff like that you put on your skin cell I've had comments like you this is not from the message Believers but like from friends like you act like you're the only Christian and why don't you dress like in your bathroom things like that but I mean I I had a few too that just accepted me for who I was like this is how I guess in the accepted and I remember one time I had a friend tell me about it he said he was gonna laugh at me when he sees me in hell he's gonna forget about his suffering and laugh at me because of the way I'm carrying myself about if if I end up in Hell he's he's going to forget about his suffering and he really laugh at me so that was one of the things that he said it in I think he probably said it as a joke but it just stayed with me I'm like I need to make it at all cost I don't have to let what he said come to us I I have to make it at all because so I mean he said it but it has stayed with me all these years and I still remember it so so some of the things that kept me going like you don't have to fall you need to stand for praise God so what was he criticizing was he criticizing your holy and modest dress style how I was living differently how I was dressed and forsaken everything like I'm I'm forsaken all the fun that is going on now so if if I end up in hell and then he also finds himself in hell then he's gonna laugh at me because I did not enjoy all the pleasures on Earth and I mean the same place on here as him well he's so deceived the Bible says that Moses gave up the pleasures of sin for a season praise God to take the way with God's people so that's what you've done and God certainly Vindicated your life as a real Christian Life you know hindsight is always 20 20 right we can always learn as time passes time is the great Vindicator of everything so Looking Back Now sister on some of these people that were very judgmental some that may have criticized you and never offered to help but never had enough maybe discernment or care to know that you would have liked to gone to a different church and and also some of these other ones that maybe said some really harsh words what have you seen in all these years since you've left College what kind of lives have they lived have they stayed true to the word have some of them stayed true have they all Fallen away are they all faithful if you could share something on that that would be really interesting I know a few that are still still in church and then a couple of them have fallen away so um I think I've seen one on Facebook and she's living like a completely different like I'm not in touch with her but I saw it on Facebook she's living a completely different life a couple of them are no longer in the message I think some of them did not even believe there is good so yeah that's a common thing we see in our own message church and also what we saw in denominations too some of the people that were the most may be critical or said some of the harshest things seemingly to stand up for Holiness or stand up for a higher standard some of them have fallen away so to me it's that idea of the fact that they were critical or maybe or said very harsh words that was a sign of a sinful condition that was some leaven in their lives and if they wouldn't repent of that 11 that 11 is only going to grow and it's going to leaven the whole lump and so that's what we've seen with different individuals if they won't confess one sin if they won't repent and overcome their current sin whether it's greed or lust or fear or unbelief or in this case criticism or maybe even legalism if they won't confess that then that sin will eat them alive it'll ruin their spiritual life and then they'll be atheists then they'll leave the message and they'll leave the nomination and they'll no longer serve God because they didn't take care of their own sins so this is a great testimony about how to overcome persecution foreign things that the Lord LED you to do that helped you overcome criticism and some of these harsh words and persecution or feeling like no one cared and no one would even ask you if you needed a ride to the right Church this was the truth like I was I was settled in my heart I did not have any questions about about the message and the truth of it the questions I had was more about the people so I when I when I went out I was out of home college and stuff I I didn't have any problem with the message that it was wrong or anything like that but the main the main thing was how we're not able to love one another like Christian love I was not seeing Christian love I had gone to a couple of churches and then I had seen how they treated one another so it always kind of disturbed me why is it that we who have the message we are not able to love on one another like like we showed but then when I go out saying denominations I see how they love one another so this kind of really stumbled me but then I couldn't go to any other Church I really wanted to go but I couldn't go anywhere because during college Years I had been to a couple of churches and I knew like this was not the truth this is not this is not a Christian thing so I couldn't go to any other Church and I mean if if you're honest with yourself if you've sat under this message everywhere else like denominations will just not feel right you you can't sit under it and feel okay so I was I was in it but that was what stumbled me it wasn't it wasn't really the message but it was it was the people so I just had to accept it and kind of live with it and then I go to church I'm like so this one scripture that really helped me was seek your own salvation with trembling and fear like your own salvation gets you your life right with God because if anything God is not going to ask why why why did you do this because that person did that or you don't have to you I mean you wouldn't have to answer for someone else you would have to answer for your own self so one thing that really one scripture that really helped me was Secure own salvation with trembling and fear and then with with house also growing up with very little I mean um it seemed like the message was like was like for poor people so going to college and starting to work I I never wanted it to be like I believe the message because we were poor and now that God has blessed me like I'm doing okay now I want to go out there and have fun and live that kind of life so that was also one thing that checked me because I knew I knew it was the truth and I never wanted it to be like after God blessed me I have kind of deserted him God blessed me and I've turned my back the things that I used to um say we're wrong now um I'm going back to do them I I never wanted that to be my my testimony so I think it was just God God just helped me and he settled it in my heart at a very young age that this is truth and then that guided me that helped me through all the times I was away from home and meeting people and going through everything I went to I knew it was the truth and then seek your salvation with trembling and fear it is you and God so seek seek your salvation yeah so it seems like the fact that you got born again when you were 10 or 11 was the the pivotal point of your whole life God had to see what the holy ghost at such a young age because of the huge trials that were coming forth in senior high in college and that was the settling in your heart the Seal of God in your soul unto the day of your Redemption and regarding Christian love you know brother Eamon and I did a whole podcast on that we can recognize you know sometimes uh message churches have the most truth but if they're not careful if they get in complexes or if some of them don't get born again the very people that should have the love of God sometimes don't have the love of God and sometimes we've gone we've gone to certain denominational churches and we felt more of God's love there than we did at a message church that may have had like complexes or maybe just some sin in the church you know that's very interesting to see that that you know even you had the same experience in your country that we had also in the United States where we want to go to a church that has truth but we also want to be loved at the same time and that's what Jesus said Jesus said the love of many shall wax cold because iniquity will bound so a lot of times we don't feel love in certain churches because iniquities in there again like the leaven the spread of sin in the church if it's not taken care of and the people won't love each other like they ought to and you gave us the answer Philippians chapter two I'm gonna look that up real quick so you answered it wonderfully and there was your scripture the Holy Spirit gave you Philippians 2 verse 12 work out your own salvation with fear and trembling so despite the inconsistencies of message peoples testimonies or even denominational people's testimonies the Holy Spirit showed you and brought down to the fact where it's between God and each individual like Jesus said I stand the door and knock and if any man will open unto me I'll come in and sup with him and he with me praise God so trusting that that scripture Philippians 2 12 mean a lot to the listeners and if you know anyone you know who's in the midst of struggling with persecution or being mistreated even amongst Believers share that scripture with them and let them know that or their main focus should be serving the lord Jesus Christ loving Jesus Christ because they'll be judged individually if they they can overcome Jesus will reward them and that's what he's looking for he's looking for individual Overcomers okay we're gonna fast forward to the time you left college and came to the United States and maybe you can tell a little bit about how you traveled here a little bit like how you met your husband and how that all came together so I had a hard time getting a job it was it was tough God was good he saw he sold me through and then my dad helped out and I got a job and I had to completely move out of town and go to like a whole different regions so I had to move to a completely different region and I was there for probably about two or three years over there too there was a small church that that I was going to one thing I like to say is probably thankfully where have I found myself God has always directed me to a mercy church God has always directed me wherever I found myself I find myself to a message and I'm very thankful for that because that has also kept me so for my husband I was I was in college with him and then who were friends and then we we used to talk and then it was I applied to school I applied for a school over here I mean we talked about marriage and it was it was a hard one for me because I mean I was married was something I was very very scared of because I knew once you're going to read it for life so I was very scared of it I was very hesitant I mean I was praying for it but I was still scared of it so when when we're talking I mean I had to he was here he was in the U.S so if I was we're going to get married I have to come here and one of the things I was I had to apply for school and then go through the Visa process and all that and one of the things I was praying about was if this if this is not going to be the will of God if come in here is going to make me fall away from the message that when I go into apply for Visa I should be denied that was that was my prayer I mean I mean everybody wants to come to the U.S it's like the big thing everybody wants to come here bad I mean I wasn't too it'll be nice if I come but it wasn't anything I was so excited for and I was praying God give me let me be granted the Visa and all that my siblings were pretty excited because I mean you're traveling to the US but I wasn't too excited about it and we're praying about it but for me every time I prayed about it it wasn't like God give me Visa Lord I mean Lord when I go let me be granted Visa but my prayer was like if coming here will make me fall away from the feet then let me be denied so I'm like what when I go into when I go into for the visa interview whatever results that come if I'm granted then it means God has God God says when I come here I'm still going to stand if I get denied then it means this is not for me so that was I fasted I prayed about it and I wasn't I wasn't really excited about it because I wasn't too sure I had I had seen a couple of people who had traveled out here and have fallen away from the faith so I was I was like really scared and like I earlier said I never wanted it to be like God has blessed me and I turned my back on him I I never wanted that so I'm like if coming here will make me fall then I shouldn't come I went through the visa application and all that went for the interview it was a very like quick smoothie interview wasn't finished I couldn't believe I was done and I had been grounded I'm like wow so I mean my siblings were excited but I was thinking like really deep I'm like I I never wanted to be my testimony that and that thing that my friend told me in college about he laughing at me you know like it also stuck with me like I never wanted anything that will make me fall away from that Faith so I had to trust God that if I had been granted he's gonna see me too so we got married and then I came here and I had probably been here like I came in as a student so I came in during summer but when I came in I did not start right away I started in fall so when I started I was I was looking for a message church when I started school I was looking for a message because then I had been here a couple of months and I hadn't been teaching I mean I was going to denomination but I wanted I wanted to go to church like like in church so I I Googled around to see if there were message charges near me but there was there was really none all the ones I was Finding was like very far away I just forgot about it and then one time I was in the library and I was learning and it just dropped in my heart like look for a church and then I Googled again and I found one from one in Columbus for my Columbus that's far and then too I was now driving I was now learning how to drive so I wasn't that good of a driver to go that far so I called the Columbus I think did I I texted him I'm like I mean Akron and I need a church so do you know of any church near us near me and then he said oh yeah there's a church in Akron I was like oh nice so he gave me the pictures contract and I'm like okay so after a couple of days I texted amen I think I did not hear back so I'm like okay maybe I shouldn't even go there after a while I'm like I think after about a week I'm like I need to send it six again so I send the text again and then he responded and gave me the church the church address and I went there I'm like okay yeah so once I went I'm like okay now I'm finally home this is this is where I'm supposed to be at yeah that's where I've been mental now and I can't even say how much the church has been of a person so I I believe God knows the intents of our hearts and if you're sincere I'm not I'm not saying that to sound prideful but if you're sincere I believe that God knows the intent of your heart and if you want to stand for him he would he will definitely make a way for you I mean I always look back and then where I am now I know it's an unsaid prayer it is God that has answered my prayer and I'm still here I'm still standing a couple of years ago I had it a friend from college he contacted me on Facebook he's like I hope you're still wearing your dresses and your skirts and you're still dressing nicely and I was like oh okay so at least people were noticing that I was dressing nicely I mean in college nobody ever like commended me or anything like that so it was nice to know that okay so people still remember that I was I was dressing Madison so when when he sent me that text I was like whoa what if I had fallen away what would have my response been so yeah I'm thankful to be here I'm thankful for how God has kept me standing so now and I I believe you'll see me through to the end that's a great testimony for all believers to see you know as you started working there you know you had to move to a new region and God provided a home church for you I mean how many times have we talked about that like we instruct the people don't go anywhere don't move anywhere unless you have a good home Church and so every time our sister moved or every time she did something God raised up a wonderful Church where she could go and hear the word of God and also I want to point out just the fact about praying about marriage praying about applying for school praying about the Visa this is something we all can learn right especially our Young Generation you know and reminders for our for those of us who are older in the faith maybe pray about everything and our sister showed how we want to pray and be neutral about everything I like how she kind of laid a fleece like Gideon lay a fleece before the Lord Lord let this go well if you want me to go and God answered really quickly right so she clearly knew it was God's will for her life now that's a prayer we all should pray Lord do whatever you need to do to keep me standing wherever you need to send me whatever you need to allow to happen in my life just keep me standing I want to be faithful I want to be about the father's business I want to hear Jesus Christ say Well done thou good and faithful servant we're at the end of part two and we're gonna have a third part with sister Naomi and hope you'll be blessed by this podcast that we did today yeah we can thank you for your time and thank you for downloading this podcast I hope all these testimonies that we're hearing now from brother amens to mind to Austin and now our sister Naomi hope they're a great blessing to you and in part three Lord willing we'll look at how God has used sister Naomi and her family here in our local church since she's been here around the end of 2013 or maybe the beginning of 2014 and God has just blessed us tremendously in our fellowship around the revealed word of God we're so thankful for that I hope you'll stay tuned for part three of that episode as well because you can see how God set aside our sister's life from a young age and protected her and guided her through some very difficult college Years and school years and then God sent her over here to our church you know to use the numerous gifts in her life to be a great blessing to us and so that would encourage all of us no matter our age to live a consecrated dedicated life to Jesus Christ so that God can use our gifts to be a blessing to other people if you have any questions for us about the podcast anything we can help you with please let us know God bless you and may Jesus Christ anoint you to defend the message
