TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] That's always God's judgment. When he makes his final judgment, calls you, justifies you, brings you to redemption, then his judgment breaks forth upon you, and the Holy Ghost and fire cleanses away the sin, then you're his. Same thing he does to the earth when he purges it with fire and by the spirit of burning and by the spirit of burning. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show the spirit of burning throughout the Bible. It's a fresh revelation that came to me earlier this year and I preached about eight sermons about it and the people really enjoyed it by the grace of God. This series showed the cleansing, renewing and filling power of the Holy Ghost. So the origin of this series was I was just reading through the Bible as I always do. I was reading through the book of Isaiah 4:4 and I came upon this verse. It says, "When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning." And when I read that, those words just stood out. The spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning. And then as I preached this series, I saw how the spirit of judgment is kind of like the first work of grace. We've got to judge ourselves that we're worthy of eternal life. The Bible said in the book of Acts that the Jews judge themselves unworthy of eternal life or everlasting life. And so we have to judge ourselves as we're unworthy and Jesus Christ is worthy. And then the spirit of burning comes upon us. It makes us a new creature in Christ Jesus. So the spirit of burning, the spirit of God is likened unto fire, which is the best cleansing agent. And then shortly after I read Isaiah chapter 4, I then read Isaiah 6, where Isaiah gets a coal from off the altar. And then I went and looked in the quotes of Brother Brandham about the spirit of burning. There's one quote where he says that. So we'll get to that. We'll just see the progression of the spirit of burning throughout the scripture. I think there's seven verses that I preached on that involve the spirit of burning and seven is the number of completion. I'm sure there could be more though by the grace of God. But I just thought I'd share this to encourage you as it was a great encouragement to the congregation by the grace of God. So start with Isaiah chapter 4 again. So the context is God going to wash and purge the daughters of Zion. Now if you remember chapter 3, these hotty, prideful daughters of Zion had 21 accessories. So they were adorning the outward too much and not focused on the inward. And then God said the only way to cleanse that type of immoral pride is by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning. Now this might be a compound prophecy in Isaiah 4:4. But God promised to wash the filth out of Zion. So all that filthy pride. No doubt there was high heels spoken of because they made tinkling sounds as they walked. 21 different accessories to try to make themselves look beautiful. And as brother Ram said, the more accessories you put on the outside of yourself, it shows the more empty you are on the inside. You're empty of God's spirit, the spirit of burning or the Holy Ghost. So in Isaiah 4, God promises to purge and cleanse all the filth out of Israel. And then in verse 5, Mount Zion was going to be a place where there was smoke by day and a shining of a flaming fire by night. So, not only was the fire going to purge and cleanse the sins of Israel, but it'd be a visible presence there on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. So, this is speaking of the millennium or perhaps the future home or both by the grace of God because we know Malachi says in the millennium we'll walk upon the ashes of the wicked. Ashes are the result of a fire. So, there's got to be a fire to cleanse the earth before the millennium. And then as we'll see later, brother Ram said Isaiah 4 is about the future home as well. So there might be another cleansing before the future home comes down. Or it could be the fire of Gog and Magog that comes down to burn up Satan and his evil army at the end of the millennium that he gathers from the four corners of the earth to come against the camp of God, the camp of the saints. So now let's go to Isaiah chapter 6. By God's grace, Isaiah sees a vision of the Lord in verses 1-5. He says he's a man of unclean lips. So, how does he become clean? An angel takes a coal, a live coal off the altar and puts it on his lips. And then his sin is purged. So, we see the same thing happening in Isaiah 6 that was spoken of in Isaiah chapter 4. The fire of God cleanses filth, cleanses sin, purges sin. And then Isaiah said, "Here I am. Send me Lord." So here we see the spirit of burning in Isaiah's life to put him into service. Brother Ram tells us that Uzziah was his mentor. Isaiah had great parents, godly parents, but he needed an experience from the Holy Ghost himself in order to be put into service. So this is an awesome verse that goes along with the quote. Brother Brandham said, "Every man who's a preacher or gets put into service must meet God on the back side of a desert somewhere." In other words, must have an experience with the Holy Ghost. So, here's Isaiah's spirit of burning experience with the Holy Ghost, and he's put into service. And remember, according to John 7:es 37-39, the Old Testament saints could not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul, but they could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their spirits or minds. So, they could have two works of grace in the Old Testament. So, Isaiah 6 is Isaiah's experience of the second work of grace. He's getting that sanctification experience in order to be put into service. But remember, in the New Testament, you need three works of grace to be put into service. And I have numerous videos about that if you'd like to watch those by the grace of God. So Isaiah is the first example. Uh Jeremiah is the second one. Jeremiah 20:9. Jeremiah was going through a lot of persecution. Chapter 20, he was in stocks and we know later he got thrown into pits. Jeremiah suffered much for the glory of God, for the word of God. He suffered a lot to be a prophet. And Jeremiah was about ready to quit in Jeremiah 20. He was in derision daily in verse 7. And it seems like the prophet even made a mistake in verse 7. He said, "Oh Lord, thou hast deceived me." Now friends, we know God doesn't deceive any man. But that's how Jeremiah felt because of all the persecution. Reminds us of John the Baptist because of being imprisoned. Brother Ram said his eagle eyes got filmed over and he wondered, "Is Jesus the Messiah or not?" And then in verse 9, he said, "I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more of his name." Jeremiah almost quits. He almost decides to quit. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones. So here we see the spirit of burning comes upon us when we feel like quitting. We feel like giving up preaching. We feel like giving up testifying. The Holy Ghost is faithful. Well, God is faithful to us in our darkest moments to come and give us a renewed experience and keep us from quitting. Praise God for that. And I think I preached that brother Brandham almost quit after the death of his first wife, Hope, and the baby girl, Sharon Rose. It was spoken of in the sermon, is your life worthy of the gospel? And brother Ram was listening to the devil cuz he felt like God had sent a black sheet down and God was not hearing brother Ram's prayer. And some of the things that the devil was saying was right in brother Ram's mind. He just pulled down the curtain as if say, "Shut up. I don't want to hear you at all. You wouldn't even talk to me." Then if he wouldn't talk to me, it was Satan's time. Then I begin to listen to him. That's reasoning. I thought, "That's right." Said, "He could you don't have to speak the word. Just look to your baby to live." I said, "That's right. And as much as you've done for him, and yet that's what he does for you." I said, "That's right. I begin to think, well, what? See, everything begin to break away when it come to reasonings. But when it come to that, that hung it stayed there. I was just about ready to say then I'll quit. But then he said, the anchor held. And he quoted Job. Those beautiful words, the Lord gives and the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He said, where did I get my daughter anyway? Who am I to question the almighty God? I said, "Satan, get away from me." I went over, lay my hand on the baby. I said, "God bless you, sweetheart. In a minute, daddy will take you down, put you on mommy's arms. The angels will pack your little soul away and I'll meet you in that morning." I said, "Lord, you give her to me, you're taking her away and throw you slainy like Job said, yet I love you and I believe you. If you send me to hell, I love you anyhow. I can't get away from that." There you are. Just been intellectual. It all broke away. But you got to have personal relationship. You got to be born again. So we see the spirit of burning comes upon brother Brandham in order to keep him in service, to keep him from quitting. Praise the Lord for that. God is faithful to keep his prophets from quitting. I was just about ready to say then I'll quit. The next example is Psalm chapter 39 with David. For context, it seems that he wrote this uh psalm while he was running from King Saul during those years of being exiled from Israel. Verse 13 said he didn't have much strength because he was asking God to spare him that he would recover his strength. Verse two said he was in sorrow. But notice when you're in sorrow and you're weak, God's spirit comes. The spirit of burning comes upon you in order to renew your strength and encourage you. Look at verse three. My heart was hot within me. While I was musing, the fire burned. Then spake I with my tongue. Lord, make me to know mine end and the measure of my days. So no doubt David was struggling. Am I going to live? How many more years do I have left? Is Saul going to kill me? And then finishing verse four, what it is, and that I may know how frail I am. So this tells us when we're at our lowest and we feel like life may be over, we're wondering how much time we have left. We meditate on God. We should muse on God. think about God and then God's spirit will come to encourage us. And the Bible said God gave David hope and no doubt God would give him hope. He was anointed to be king. He wasn't king yet, but the anointing, the spirit of burning came upon him to let him know you're going to be king. Verse 7 says, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee. So God's spirit will come upon you when you're struggling, wondering about your future, how many more years you have left. God's spirit will come upon you to give you hope and renew your strength. Beautiful story there by the grace of God. The next one is Luke 24. Cleopus and his friend on the road to Emmas. The Bible said that they were sad. This is on resurrection day, resurrection Sunday. They're walking away from Jerusalem on the road to Emmas. Jesus comes out and talks to them. And the Bible said that Jesus started at Moses and preached all about himself. The preacher of preachers preaching about himself. Oh, I love this story. Jesus preaches to them during their walk and Jesus acts like he's going to leave them, but then they constrain him to stay and then he breaks the bread and they recognize his presence. He vanishes. Their eyes were open. They knew him and they said, "Did not our heart burn within us as he talked with us by the way while he opened to us the scriptures." There's so many applications of this. You know, this can happen in a service while we're listening to the word of God and we feel like the presence of God comes upon us and like God is talking directly to us. But here we see in this case the spirit of burning came upon them during the preaching of the word and gave them hope about their service and their future. Again, they're doubting was he the Messiah or not? I thought Jesus was this great prophet, but they killed him. Our Lord's been killed. He's been crucified. But the spirit of the Lord, the spirit of burning comes upon their hearts during the preaching of the word. This is something that happens to us quite often as message believers, as holy ghostfilled saints. In our times of doubt, in our times of frustration, our times of fear, the spirit of God will come upon us to encourage us. And they were so encouraged, they ran all the way back to Jerusalem. I think it was 6 milesi if I'm not mistaken. And then later, Jesus appeared to all the apostles that same night. We get so many truths out of this passage. Like even when we're sad, even when when we're discouraged, we should talk about the Lord. And then as we talk about the Lord, the Lord will come and dwell amongst us. As what happened to Cleopus and his friend here in Luke chapter 24. So the spirit of burning puts you in service as Isaiah said. The spirit of burning keeps you from quitting service as Jeremiah experienced. The spirit of burning gives you hope about your future service as you meditate as David said in Psalm 39. And the spirit of burning dissolves your doubts, encouraging you, taking away your sadness as we see in Luke 24. And now we see the spirit of burning sealing you into the kingdom of God in Acts 2 3 and 4. They were in one place in one accord. And then cloven tongues like as under fire sat on each one of the 120 believers in the upper room. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance. So here we see the disciples and the apostles 120 received the promise of the father that Jesus called it in Acts chapter 1. Their souls were baptized with the Holy Ghost. Now they have power to be witnesses. Now they have the third work of grace that even Ezekiel prophesied. New heart, new spirit, my spirit. They have the seal of the Holy Ghost. They have the token of the baptism of the Holy Ghost putting them into full service by the complete three works of grace. So now we see the spirit of burning coming into the soul of the believer. The first time that could happen according again to John 7:37-39. And 7th and finally is second Peter 3 12 and 13. Peter said looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. I'll read 14 as well. Beautiful. Beloved, seeing that you look for such things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. So, this is speaking of the future home. And this is the scripture that Brother Ram uses for his sermon on the future home. It's from the future home, August 2nd, 1964. Brother Ram's going to read Isaiah 4, verse 4. And he compares it to the three works of grace. So, we know the earth is redeemed in three steps. the water of Noah's flood. The second step is the blood of Jesus Christ poured upon the earth, water, blood, and then spirit or fire. This fervent heat preaches and speaks of here. He prophesies of it. Let's listen to the quote from God's prophet, brother Brandon. That's always God's judgment. When he makes his final judgment, calls you, justifies you, brings you to redemption, then his judgment breaks forth upon you and the Holy Ghost and fire cleanses away the sin. Then you're his. same thing he does to the earth when he purges it with fire and by the spirit of burning. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing again by the grace of God. So, I think this sermon series showed me and showed our congregation that the Holy Ghost is here no matter what we need. Whether we need to be put into service, whether we need encouragement to keep from quitting, whether we're wondering about our future and we need strength to continue on, it helps dissolve our doubts about our service. And the spirit of burning will prepare for us a future home. Hallelujah to the lamb of God. The Holy Ghost is here to heal us, strengthen us, keep us from quitting, baptize our souls with the fire of Almighty God. So, no matter where you're at in your walk with God, just meditate on the Lord. Talk about the Lord. I was even reading in Psalm recently, and I believe the Bible said, "Let the believers continually say,"The Lord be magnified." And I've been trying to remember to do that just throughout the day, the Lord be magnified. Praise God. God is great. God is so mighty. God is so awesome. Just continually talking about the Lord. And then the spirit of God comes upon us to help us, to strengthen us, to encourage us. May God encourage you today with the spirit of burning. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. is never fail. [Music]
