TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Beginning in the year 1956, God's prophet William Brham began telling a beautiful testimony of a Lutheran dean named Brother Hegree who had at first blasphemed his ministry, but was able to repent, receive correction, and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. This is a beautiful encouraging story of how people can go from blaspheming to victory by the grace of almighty God. This is a biblical truth that people can blasphe and yet still be forgiven. It's found in 1 Timothy 1:13. St. Paul, who was previously known as Saul, told us he had blasphemed the Holy Ghost in ignorance. Over the years, I've talked to numerous people and they've wondered if they've blasphemed the Holy Ghost for the final time. And I always take them to this verse to encourage them because the Bible is clear. We can blasphe in ignorance and still be forgiven and of course saved. And as the example of St. Paul and Brother Hegree prove, you can also be filled with the Holy Ghost. We know the Lord Jesus Christ spoke of the dangers of blasphemy in Matthew 12:31-32. And those words are true. But there's also the truth that people can blasphe ignorantly and still be forgiven, justified, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost. St. Peter is another great example how he was saved, walked on water, was given the keys to the kingdom, but then denied the Lord Jesus Christ three times, wept bitterly, but God in his grace and mercy, his abundant rich mercy was able to restore Peter and then fill him with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost. On January 15th, 1957, William Brandham told this story of a Lutheran dean, Brother Hegree, from God Keeps His Word in Sturgis, Michigan. Brother Hegree went to see Brother Brand a minister in Minneapolis. And Brother Hegree wrote Brother Brandham a letter and called him a soothsayer. So that was Brother Hegre's ignorant blasphemy. &gt;&gt; I tell you, it was a a dean of the Lutheran College. He had wrote me a letter and you talk about giving me a good raing over. He gave me one. I was at Minneapolis and he said, "I drove 15 miles last night in a blinding snowstorm thinking I was going to hear a servant of the Lord and what did I find but a polished up soothsayer." And he said, "And your theology is oh my 22 pages in the letter." I know. &gt;&gt; Notice William Brandham's reaction. His first reaction to being called a soussayer was, "Well, now that's all right. It's okay." &gt;&gt; Well, now I thought, "Well, now it's all right. I It's okay." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham wrote him back and noticed the words Brother Brandham used. He said, "Dear beloved brother, I was glad to get your letter. Look at the self-control. Look at the temperance, the longsuffering. Look at the love, the charity of Jesus Christ in the heart of God's prophet, William Brandham. He didn't write him back in anger. He didn't curse him. He didn't lose his cool. He called him beloved brother. He was always glad for friendly criticism. &gt;&gt; So I sat down and I addressed him after he first told me he thought I was a devil. See, a sousayer, which would be a devil, of course. So he said uh you uh uh I said dear beloved brother I was glad to get your letter. I'm always glad for friendly criticism. It helps me helps you if you just take it that way if there somebody criticize you might have some spots that ought to be cleared up. I said, "I'm very happy to get your letter and you must think something of me or you wouldn't have wrote to me." I said, "And then another thing that I admire you for is your 50 years of service for my Lord." &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says the first thing he told him was that he forgives him for calling Brother Brandham a soussayer. &gt;&gt; So I said, "You must love me." And uh I said, "Now the first thing I'm going to say to you, I forgive you for calling me a soothsayer." I said, "Because a devil because you remember Jesus when he was doing that very same thing, saying I can do nothing except I do what the father tells me and was seeing the visions and telling the people what who they were and what they were and what happened and so forth." Brother Ram then goes on to straighten up brother Hegree by saying you can't base your faith on experience. Your faith must be based upon the word of God and Satan cannot cast out Satan. &gt;&gt; I said just to straighten you up, brother. I said, I just like to ask you something. I'm surprised that a Lutheran dean would base his theology up on some sort of an experience. Why? In the Baptist church and the And the first year of school, we learned to base everything upon the Bible. I said, "All our theology must come off the Bible." And here you're trying to base your theology on an experience. Well, now I said to settle it, Jesus said that Satan cannot cast out Satan. That settled it then. If Jesus said Satan can't heal, I don't care what anyone else would say. That's settled. He think he that's all. &gt;&gt; Brother Hegry received Brother Bram's letter and wanted to meet with him face to face at a Christian businessman's international convention. &gt;&gt; He wrote me a letter back and said, "Mr. Brandham, I hear you're coming back to the Christian businessman's international convention to speak. So, could I have a few words with you?" &gt;&gt; In that meeting, Brother Hegry wondered about Pentecostal people kicking furniture around. Brother Random quoted Ezekiel 37 and the dry bones coming together as biblical support for the Pentecostals kicking furniture around. &gt;&gt; And as we had our dinner, he said, "I want to ask you a question, Mr. Ram." I said, "Yes." I here it comes. Lutheran demons. He said, "I've been down to the Pentecostal and kick the furniture around and everything like that, but I won't ask you there anything to it." I said, "Yes, sir, there is." I said like a little kid when he gets a toy he just falls. I said like Ezekiel said it's a valley full of dry bones. He said can these live? He said thou knowest. So he said prophesy to the dry bones. And when the bones come together there's a rattling and a shaking. A lot of noise. But then when the skin come on the meat come on them. There wasn't much noise. He said prophesy to the spirit now. I said I think that's what's going on. So I said the I see him make a lot of noise. I said I think the bones are coming together. &gt;&gt; Then brother he asked about how to receive the Holy Ghost. If Abraham believed God and was righteous, wasn't believing enough to receive the Holy Ghost? And brother Ram said, "Yes, you have to believe, but God also has to give you a confirmation of your faith." Which for Abraham was the seal of circumcision in his flesh. But for us, it's the circumcision of the soul by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then God has recognized your faith. &gt;&gt; He said, "We're hungered and thirsting for God." I said, "It's fine." Said, "And we want you to tell us how to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost." He said, "But Abraham believed God, Brother Brandon, and it was imputed to him for righteous because he believed. What more can a man do but believe?" I said, "That's all a man can do." I said, "You believe and accept Christ as personal savior, that's your faith." But remember, God gave Abraham a seal of circumcision as a confirmation of his faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. And I said, "Then that was the Old Testament. In the New Testament, when we say we believe, God gives us the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is a seal of confirmation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, Ephesians 4:30 says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the seal that God has recognized your faith. But if he hasn't gi you the Holy Ghost yet, he's never recognized your faith. See, &gt;&gt; brother must have received all this correction because he still wants the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he wanted it there and asked Brother Random how to receive it. He said, "Scoop back your chairs and let's pray." Brother Hegree and his students got on their knees praying on their chairs. Brother Ram laid hands on them and 72 Lutheran students received the baptism of the Holy Ghost with signs and wonders healings following. &gt;&gt; So he said, "We want the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, a Lutheran God. I said, "What's the Lutheran people going to say?" He said, "We don't care what the Lutheran people say. We want God." &gt;&gt; Well, I said, "Wonderful." Uh I said, "When do you want?" He said, "Right now." I said, "Well, scoot back to your place and I will pray." And I had them all go around to the wall like that, laid hands on them. 72 Lutheran students received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They got signs and wonders and healings going on in the Lutheran College in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then in spiritual adoption 1956, brother Ram said he even laid his hands on the dean, Brother Hegree, and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, proving we can blasphe in ignorance, and God in his mercy will forgive us and lead us all the way through justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I said, "Move back your plates, take your bench, and scoot over against the wall." Each man did all the way around. I said, "Now kneel down and turn your face to the wall and started asking God for the Holy Ghost." And I had brother Moore to stand and pray. I went laying hands on each one and all 72 students and the dean received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they're shaking that country up there with the miracles and working of God. They're having healing services and everything. The Lutheran Seminary. Friends, if the devil battles you on whether you've crossed the line between mercy and judgment, or if you've blasphemed the Holy Ghost, tell Satan he's a liar. The biblical proof that you are still able to be saved, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost is that you're still longing for God. You still desire to be right with God. If you had crossed the line, if you had blasphemed and there was no coming back, you wouldn't even desire to go to church, to watch this video, to read your Bible, to pray. And that's proven by at least two examples. Judas's scariot blasphemed the Lord Jesus, left him, and never came back to repent. He had no desire to come back to Jesus and repent. The other example is Cain. Cain left the prince of God and he never comes back to the prince of God. So friend, if you're coming back to the presence of God, if you want to worship God, if you want your heart right before God, if you want to be forgiven, that proves there's still hope for you. You can still be saved, sanctified, and spiritfilled. Brother Random dealt with people many times who thought they'd crossed the line. Brother Ram says, "You haven't crossed the line. You wouldn't be here tonight in the service if you'd crossed the line." &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Brandom, I've been so sinful. I believe I've crossed the separating line. No, you haven't. Or you wouldn't be here tonight. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says, if you feel like you're beyond hope and you've broken every commandment, if you've done everything there is in the Bible that you ought not to do besides blas the Holy Ghost, and of course that means for the final time, not in ignorance. God has a sacrifice provided for you. He's Jehovah Gy. He alters all circumstances. &gt;&gt; How can he make atonement for me? I broke my marriage vows. I've done this, that, and the other. He's Jehovah Gara, the Lord's provided sacrifice. If you're beyond hope, if you broke every commandment, if you've done everything there is in the Bible that you ought not to do besides blasphe the Holy Ghost, God has a sacrifice provided for you. He's Jehovah Jarai. He alters all circumstances. &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Hegy had called brother Brandham a susair, a worker with the devil. And yet he had not blasphemed the Holy Ghost for the final time. Thank God for such amazing grace. God is rich in mercy. I'll leave you with one more quote from it is I be not afraid March 29th, 1960. Brother Ram said, "You might think you've crossed the separating line and you can't be saved. That's wrong. As long as you got enough God about you to come here to this church tonight, there's hope for you to be saved. As long as the spirit of God's dealing with you. &gt;&gt; There he was. All hopes is gone. Maybe you are tonight. Maybe the doctor says you can't live no longer. Maybe you think you cross a separating line. You can't be saved. That's wrong. As long as you got enough God about you to come here to this church tonight, these hopes for you to be saved. Long as the spirit of God's dealing with you. I love how God ministered to those who thought they'd crossed the line through Brother Ram's ministry. Brother Ram gave them simple answers on whether they'd blasphemed and gone too far or not. He said, "You wouldn't be in church if you'd blasphe the Holy Ghost. You wouldn't care about your spiritual condition if you'd gone too far." Praise God for his mercy and his love. Praise God that he can still forgive ignorant blasphemy. Praise God that he is full of compassion and forgives iniquity according to Psalm 78:38. Praise God that God is full of compassion and gracious and long-suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth according to Psalm 86:15. [Music] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Brandham, I've been so sinful. I believe I've crossed the separating line." No, you haven't, or you wouldn't be here tonight. As long as you got enough God about you to come here to this church tonight, these hopes for you to be saved. Long as the spirit of God's dealing with you. [Music]
