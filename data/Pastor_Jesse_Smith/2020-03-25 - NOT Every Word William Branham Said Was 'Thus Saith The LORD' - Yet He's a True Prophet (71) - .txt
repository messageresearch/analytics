========================================
[Music] greetings friends and the Mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is part 1 in a series that examines the seven false teachings of the Jeffersonville Tape church movement the purpose of this first video is to prove by the Bible and William branham's own words that not every word William Branham said was thus saith the Lord in fact no prophet born with a sin nature spoke every word with us saith the Lord I want to again state that I believe William Branham was a genuine prophet of God I've been studying his message for almost 20 years and preaching it as it is rightly divided through the Word of God as he taught us to do to begin with leadership at the Branham Tabernacle said and I quote I believe everything brother Branham says is thus saith the Lord I believe everything the Prophet says that it is the truth of God to me and you whether we want to accept it or not end quote I humbly believe it is wrong and is the sin of idolatry to say every word the late William Branham said was thus saith the Lord because this false doctrine makes brother Branham infallible or divined since every word of the Lord is infallible essentially their false teaching makes William Branham equal with God as the tape church movement is making brother Branham the head of the church instead of Christ but Jesus Christ has always been is and always will be the head of the Bride of Christ according to Ephesians 1:22 523 and Colossians 1:18 the truth is that not every word William Branham said was thus saith the Lord only Jesus Christ was and is infallible William Branham was not infallible and plainly stated this in 1963 william branham made specific statements declaring some of his words were not from the Lord in 1958 by faith Moses brother Branham said in regards to his 1977 prediction it was not the Lord saying it which means it was not thus saith the Lord and that I predict now this is not the large saying this the other about the woman in his is the Lord but I predicted in nineteen and and thirty 33 that the world would be total annihilation before 77 William Branham also said it was a very awful thing and tommyrot to make him infallible they claimed in here that some brother an up there that doesnõt sent them up there and they're preaching that man should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and at the that I am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and all some of the office things you've ever heard and if this church knows that we don't stand for no such tommyrot is that scripture plainly teaches all men born with a sin nature like Moses Elijah Peter and William random utters sinful words at multiple points during their lives proving not every word William Branham said could have been thus saith the Lord because the Lord does not utter deceit here are some examples Abraham and Isaac both lied about not being married to their respective wives their lies were not thus saith the Lord Elijah said he was the only one left in Israel who did not bow the knee to bail but God said there were seven thousand more who did not bow these words of Elijah were not thus saith the Lord Peter promised to never leave Christ but he did after Jesus's arrest even denying him three times so that promise and his denial were not thus saith the Lord this is clearly taught in Romans 3 9 to 14 because it says all are under sin there's none righteous no not one there's none that understandeth none that seeketh after God they are all gone out of the way there is none that doeth good no not one their throat is an open Sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of ASPs is under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness friends brother Branham used deceit Romans 3:13 with his tongue when he had his wife lied to the IRS so he would not have to talk to them but later he repented his deceitful words were not thus saith the Lord because the Lord cannot lie obviously there were times God spoke through his prophets like Elijah everyone knew God was speaking because Elijah spoke in the name of the Lord first King 17:1 and Elijah the Tishbite said unto hey hab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor rain these years but according to my word brother Branham told the people when to know when God was speaking when asked if brother Branham was prophesying about Martin Luther King jr. he said no because when God speaks he says it's not me it's thus saith the Lord did you prophesy that there be a million Negroes killed on the or did you just announce that there would be at this happening now see I've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to think there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the law even to visions or anything no I just was talking about Martin Luther King on this great disaster that they're having in the south with the colored people it's inspired of the wrong thing you see see they then people and that's reason I say that not that there is any any prophecy concerning and I have nothing on it from the Lord and B is sure now if I say anything from the Lord like that to tell you it's always I'm speaking now but when he speaks I say it's not me it's thus saith the Lord and I can't say it until he tells me I could be altogether wrong am i thought about Martin Luther King I don't know I can't say if that's just my opinion how did followers of William Branham get to the false conclusion that every word he said was thus saith the Lord I believe they got to this idolatrous conclusion because they misinterpret two statements from brother Branham the first I'll call the so say I in the name of Jesus Christ quote listen to this before I explain the errors of the tape church movement this was speaking to Israel and repent afin de cated by God by a pillar of foreign no he was proven to be God's servant to lead them out and before they went in to the land before they enter Moses said now the words that I have spoken to you if you had one thing to it or take one word from it you'll not stay in the land for the Lord God gives you so say I in the name of Jesus Christ don't you add one thing don't take put your own ideas you just say what is said on those tapes you just do exactly what the Lord God has commanded to do don't add to it he has error beeps his promise to us every promise that he has made first this authoritative statement is spoken in the name of Jesus Christ but it doesn't mean what Branham tabernacle is trying to make it say that we can only say what brother branham's tapes say that's a form of idolatry exalting brother Branham equal to God or Christ second brother Branham is repeating what Moses said as a charge to Israel in Deuteronomy chapter 4 verses 1 to 4 and verses 25 and 26 the charge was not to add or diminish God's Word that Moses commanded them not every word Moses said Moses was right God's people should never add or take away from God's commands according to proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6 in revelation 22 verses 18 and 19 when understood correctly the so say I in the name of Jesus Christ quote means we do all the Bible based commands brother Branham gave us that originated from the Bible and we don't add to the Bible's commands this is the same thing Moses said and Deuteronomy chapter 4 this statement cannot mean Christians should only say the exact words recorded on the audiotapes of brother Branham brother Branham was trying to say what Moses said in charging the people to obey God's Word Moses didn't mean for Israel to only say his every single word uttered from his mouth he only meant for Israel to keep all the commands of God another evidence is that the pastor of Branham tabernacle during William branham's life Worman devil did not play tapes of brother Branham nor did he only quote brother Branham while preaching in fact one month after the so say I quote brother Branham preached his final sermon at the Branham Tabernacle on August 29th 1965 it was an evening service and his sermon title was Satan's Eden in this sermon brother Adam told us how he was led of the Lord to listen to brother Neville preach earlier that morning this morning I wanted your brother Neville myself and I heard you many times and never heard he made a lot of preciate he but this morning that I'm Lea message I know I had the leading of the Lord to listen to that this morning very fun and I see why you people like to come and listen to him also and he'll always do you good I'm sure to listen to him listen that mighty message this morning on our brother Neville brought us about I thought if a soul a wonderful high said their doctor will diagnose the case but the man that comes with a pen full of needles he gives the injection John thought that was really a real cute little expression and I thought about that the serum after the case is diagnosed and no that's a very good thing we learn these truths William Branham never forced any pastor to play only his tapes and not preach himself William Branham always wanted the living pastor to preach from his spiritual preaching gift and not play tapes William Branham always supported the preachers in the fivefold ministry preaching for themselves how fitting that the very last sermon brother Branham preached at the Branham Tabernacle was after submitting to the fivefold ministry by letting the pastor preached before the Prophet this also shows how the Prophet is not above the pastor in the local church setting that's up to you see if he want to preach a he wanted to that's between you and him returning now to Moses it's undeniable not every word Moses said was thus saith the Lord brother Branham knew this and said that prophets are not infallible people in 1957 not easy move Nathan the Prophet said David Duval's in your heart cause God's with you the Prophet made a mistake not willing Nate that night the Lord comes the Prophet said go tell my servant Haven numbers chapter 20 verses 7 to 13 is a clear example in which God tells Moses to speak to the rock to give water to Israel but instead he calls Israel rebels which God never told him to say and smites the rock twice to give Israel water which God never told him to do Moses sanctified or glorified himself according to God's own words Moses publicly disobeyed thus saith the Lord and God punished Moses by not allowing him to take Israel into the Promised Land according to numbers 20 verse 12 Moses like all prophets including William Branham were allowed to have their own opinions within their freemore agency this means prophets sinned make mistakes and do not always speak things that please God but God forgives them upon their repentance just as he freely forgives you and I but prophets are required to be infallible when they say thus saith the Lord or in the name of the Lord according to Deuteronomy 18 verses 20 through 22 and James 5:10 we believe Moses Elijah and William Branham and of course other prophets were infallible when they spoke in the name of the Lord mix-ups on the tapes since prophets are not always infallible I want to show how william branham himself said there are mix-ups on his tape recorded sermons which proves not every word recorded on tape was thus saith the lord like leadership at the Branham tabernacle erroneously teaches God doesn't have mix-ups according to brother Branham himself in 1956 subject [Music] [Music] in 1964 brother random said he mixed up something on the tape so he told the people to look in the Bible for the truth which is a valuable lesson because the Bible is infallible this also proves the Bible was William branham's absolute and not his own audio tapes about like another day I got something least up I have to hear yes I called it right there and so on the tape now I probably hear from it when I was talking about the seven trumpets I said what seven trumpets I was referring to the Pentecostal feast was a great teaching there I didn't touch the age of it but if you have to catch out on your tape remember look in the Bible you see it's seven months adlet count off seven months Jerry for every March April does God mix things up and get things wrong no so every word of brother Branham cannot be thus sayeth the Lord along with so say I in the name of Jesus Christ quote a second quote Branham Tabernacle misinterprets is one alcohol I am God's voice to you which says I'm just your brother by the grace of God but when the age of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you maybe if I've offended you by saying that forgive me but I felt that might been invented but I am God's voice to you see I say that again that time was under inspiration faith and I felt bad about the first time that is repeated it down see I can say nothing in myself but he shows me I said the first point is that this statement is true anyone who receives God's Word from an angel undoubtedly becomes the messenger of God's voice just like the word angel means messenger both moses and paul were guided by angels during their ministries according to exodus 20:3 20 and acts 20:7 23 but followers of william branham who exalt his every word 2 thus saith the lord failed to read on when William Branham says I can say nothing in myself this means William branham's regular words including his opinions hopes and desires can be fallible and are not always thus saith the Lord brother Branham knew God used his voice at times to speak his will but not always William Branham said the following I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens is perfectly our I'm only one this year when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew that's what I just treated myself to that he spoke through me another Bible example is God using Elijah's voice to prophesy drought in Israel as the voice of God but there were times Elijah spoke his own opinions that were not thus saith the Lord Elijah's misunderstanding then about being the only believer left who had not bowed their knee wasn't part of his message from God the same is true for brother Branham not every word brother Branham spoke was part of his message from God brother branham's message was the word or Bible truths we are to obey today note also that brother men have never limited himself as being the only voice of God while it's true brother Adam's voice meaning his commands from God was the one prophetic church age messenger voice to this final Laodicean age brother Adam never declared God only spoke through him in fact william branham believed both the bride and every believer who God inspires to speak for him is God's voice to the years chapter 9 in the church age book shows many important quotes about how the voice of God is also in the bride of Jesus Christ the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God he God will confound her false church system through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her Oh God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride as we have said the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word this quote is very important because future videos will show Lord willing how the tape church movement is breaking God's Word most notably in the area of the fivefold ministry of Ephesians 4 verses 8 to 16 the tape church movement seeks to take away the preaching ministry of God's five preaching gifts and replaces their preaching with tape playing which is a gross error and is never said in the Word of God the word or Bible never says preachers are to stop preaching and only play tapes so the tape church movement is not saying what is in the word listen now brother Branham says the average Christian becomes God's voice at times never believer in tonight possessed some percentile completely give it over to his words become like the words of prize and to think that if you get into that contact with God it becomes - it isn't you were boys anymore it's not true thought anymore it becomes God's thought in God's voice you are just the band or just a bridge he's the burner concerning the two quotes from william branham the so say i in the name of Jesus Christ and the I am God's voice to you followers of brother Branham must take all his statements back to the Bible proving all things just like Paul and brother Branham believed here is the time that everything that that has got to be proven to be right or wrong don't survive what they prove all things the whole face then we must prove all things by the scriptures not what if it's contrary to my faith and yet the scripture says though the scriptures right and I'm long see the scripture is always right and only way you can do anything is come back to the scripture the remember is the election is the only time that'll catch it what do you say how do you know what you're not right then catch me by the word contest your denomination by this word that's even if I prove all things the Bible don't stop getting the tapes just stay with it search it by the word and see if it's right the Bible said prove all things I know it's done poppers so with Jesus so as the message always when you do that you find brother Branham means only God's commands from the Bible that God gave to him to Christians those commands should not be added to nor taken away from sixteen examples of not every word William Branham said was thus saith the Lord if you would like please contact me and I can make a separate video explaining these 16 examples that prove not every word brother Branham said was thus saith the Lord a few examples include how brother Branham used deceit Romans 3:13 with his tongue when he had his wife lied to the IRS so he would not have to talk to them but later he repented brother branham's lied to the IRS cannot be thus saith the Lord because God does not lie nor does he cause men to lie also brother branham's prediction about 1977 was not thus saith the Lord and of course he told us that it was a prediction and it was not from the Lord brother Branham predicted Total Annihilation meaning the United States would be wiped out with just stumps of trees left and of course this did not come to pass and then there will come a total annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out and that I predict now this is not the large thing that's the other about the woman in his is the Lord but I predicted in 19 and 30 33 that the world would be total annihilation before 77 so I didn't know then that they had something that could annihilate it they got now that I've seen the nation and Total Annihilation just stump some trees and things like that so it's on its Road again let me say plainly that I believe brother Branham was a genuine prophet who spoke with thus sayeth the Lord at times and I have videos about that on my youtube channel supporting his prophetic ministry but he was also a man and all men and women are fallible my objective for sharing these 16 examples is to expose the error of saying every word brother Branham said was thus saith the Lord in doing this I am doing what brother Branham specifically told his listeners to do when I quoted first Thessalonians 5:21 which says prove all things brother Branham said we must prove all things by the scripture we must prove all things by the scriptures he also said test me by the word we are to prove all things said by prophets and preachers not some things by the Bible every genuine prophet and believer for that matter has the same desire brother Branham had to be proven right by the Bible just as the brans proved all of st. Paul's words by Scripture acts 17:11 caused the Bereans more noble than others because they receive the Word of God with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily whether those things were so in closing I hope these truths help prove to you that not every word William Branham said was thus saith the Lord and yet he is a genuine prophet of God some have wondered how do we know which words of a prophet like brother Branham are thus saith the Lord the answer is simple and twofold first brother Adam will say thus saith the Lord or in the name of the Lord second the Holy Ghost will direct you to the word that brother Branham is referencing and then the spirit guides you into all truth the gift of God inside you the seal or baptism of the Holy Ghost guide you into all truth of the word of God that's what the Holy Ghost was given for please contact me if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
