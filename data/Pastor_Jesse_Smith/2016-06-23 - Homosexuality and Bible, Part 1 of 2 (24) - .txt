This two part series teaches without bias the Bible truth about homosexuality. There are nearly 50 Scriptures in the King James Holy Bible that teach the act of homosexuality is a sin in the eyes of God. Part 1 of this series shows these 50 Scriptures and shows Jesus' direct teaching about Sodom and His definition of a godly marriage - one man and one woman.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matches name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to present without bias what the Bible plainly teaches about homosexuality We Begin by stating from the outset that the King James Holy Bible is 100% against homosexual as we will show with nearly 50 scriptures from the word of God there is not one scripture in the Bible that justifies gay marriage or any homosexual act despite what many teachers today may try to say Jesus Christ the son of God is the same yesterday today and forever and the Bible has the same judgment upon homosexuality throughout the entire Bible God was against homosexuality yesterday or in the past he is against it today day and he will always be against it because the act of homosexuality pridefully and unashamedly defies his design and perfect will please know that we are not engaging in hate speech we do not hate any homosexual person real Christians do not hate homosexuals nor does a real Christian condone any violence toward homosexuals we are not judging homosexuals and saying that we know for sure where they are going after after they die whether Heaven or Hell only God knows their Destinies but the Bible says a homosexual person who does not repent of their sin will not inherit the kingdom of God but also Liars murderers teachers of heresies adulterers fornicators and more will not inherit the kingdom of God if they do not repent of their sins so the main desire of a Christian is to lead people away from their sins into repentance and a new walk and a new life with the Lord Jesus Christ so our pure desire for this video is that it will lead Sinners to repentance I was so thankful when a preacher came and preached the truth to me that I could get delivered from my specific sins that I struggle with may God help us all to overcome sin to hate sin and love the righteousness of Jesus Christ Bible teaching on homosexuality concerning the topic of homosexuality the Bible is completely one-sided as the Bible condemns homosexuality and all those who partake of the ACT but it pleads with homosexuals and all Sinners to repent of all their sins the specific sin of homosexuality is condemned in the following two Old Testament scriptures and three new testament scriptures Leviticus 18:22 Leviticus 20:3 Romans chap 1: 26-32 1 Corinthians 6: 9-1 and 1 Timothy 1: 10 and 11 please understand that the pure words of the Bible describe the act of homosexuality as the following an Abomination or disgusting thing vile or disgraceful dishonorable shameful against nature or unnatural a lust or forbidden craving unseemly or shame of nakedness not convenient or unfit abusers of themselves wh mongers and them that defile themselves with mankind perhaps the most infamous group of homosexuals in the Bible were the people of Sodom and Gomorrah from The Book of Genesis chapters 18 and 19 these disobedient ones were destroyed by fire and brimstone from the Lord Out of Heaven according to Genesis 19:4 Sodom is spoken of 53 times in the Bible 12 times the Bible just mentions the literal name of the city and the name of the king of Sodom but 41 of 53 times Sodom is spoken of deal with the sin and wickedness of Sodom and the condemnation that God brought upon those people because of the sin of homosexuality in the Old Testament the following Bible writers condemn Sodom and the act of homosexual ity Moses the writers of first and 2 Kings the prophet Isaiah the prophet Ezekiel the prophet Amos the prophet Zephaniah in the New Testament the following Bible writers condemn Sodom and the act of homosexuality the Lord Jesus Christ St Paul St Peter St Jude and St John based upon this Bible examination which group of preachers will you stand with today will you stand with the preachers and Prophets who wrote the Bible and condemned the act of homosexuality or will you stand with many of the modern day preachers today that say homosexuality is acceptable unto God and yet God never commissioned these modern-day preachers to do Miracles and prophesy or write the Bible like the other Old Testament and New Testament Bible writers as for me in my house in our church we will believe the Bible and the men God commissioned to write his eternal unchanging words of truth homosexuality was and still is a sin according to the Eternal unchanging word of God Jesus is teaching about homosexuality I have heard it preached before that Jesus never addressed the issue of homosexuality in the four gospels and so according to these preachers Jesus must have supported homosexuality we believe that is a false interpretation while it may be true Jesus never directly referenced Old Testament scriptures about homosexuality such as Leviticus 18:22 and 20:3 Jesus did directly mention the people of Sodom and Gomorrah as we presented earlier in Matthew 10:15 Matthew 11:23 and 24 Mark 6:11 Luke 17: 24-36 and Luke 10:12 each time he mentioned the people of Sodom it was in the context of the day of judgment which Associated sodomite Behavior with God's Wrath Jesus also connected the increase of homosexuality directly with the end of the world and his second coming which we will teach more on later in this video we must also point out that Jesus indirectly addressed the issue of homosexuality because each time Jesus taught on marriage his emphasis was upon marriage between a man and a woman Jesus's teaching on marriage always supported the Genesis account of God's original design for marriage one man and one woman Jesus's main emphasis was to try and take the people back to the beginning Adam and Eve male and female no divorce lifelong commitment and powered by God himself according to Matthew 19: 1-12 and Matthew 5: [Music] 27-32 before we move on WE recall that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever according to Hebrews 13:8 so if Jesus supported only marriage between a man and a woman yesterday 2,000 years ago then today he would only support the same Union and he will forever support the same [Music] Union if you would like more Bible teaching about homosexuality and also prayer for deliverance from this temptation please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
