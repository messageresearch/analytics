[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] I was a southerner that light-colored
[0:05] people
[0:06] I met garment and from that time up it
[0:10] changed
[0:11] I love my brethren my colored Brethren I
[0:14] wouldn't be in African around preaching
[0:15] to him but I didn't love them they're
[0:17] God's people the same as we are
[0:22] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:24] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:27] this video is to show that God's Prophet
[0:29] brother William Branham was not a racist
[0:32] as some of his critics say and this
[0:35] racism accusation is of course a false
[0:38] accusation an evil slanderous attack
[0:41] upon God's true prophet
[0:44] I want to make a quick disclaimer for
[0:46] this video
[0:47] there's some mature content and
[0:50] terminology and words in this video so
[0:52] it's probably not suitable for children
[0:53] so adults please just listen to it
[0:55] yourself
[0:56] in summary brother Branham admitted he
[0:59] was raised to be a racist he said he was
[1:02] a southerner and didn't like black
[1:04] people but then he said he met God and
[1:08] from that time on he'd been changed
[1:11] I was a southerner that light-colored
[1:13] people and a vision came and told me
[1:15] where to go find it
[1:17] and all those white girls that I went
[1:20] with open out all of them four five
[1:21] stand there said Billy you're not going
[1:23] in there there I said yes I got to go
[1:27] so don't ever ask me for another date it
[1:29] didn't make any difference
[1:31] I meant Garland and from that time up it
[1:35] changed
[1:36] and point back to that time
[1:40] I was changed
[1:43] brother Graham said there's no
[1:45] difference between any race all races
[1:47] are God's children no sir the colored
[1:51] race is all for the same tree that we're
[1:53] off of and every human being
[1:55] the same one
[1:57] that is no different
[1:59] exactly
[2:01] that's right you're a human being just
[2:03] the same creative here by God
[2:07] made us in our colors and he made us the
[2:09] way he wanted us and we're all his
[2:11] children amen absolutely
[2:16] brother random said he loved his black
[2:18] Brethren he said they're God's people
[2:20] the same as we are
[2:23] I love my brethren my colored Brethren I
[2:26] wouldn't be an African around preaching
[2:27] to him but I didn't love them they're
[2:29] God's people
[2:30] the same as we are
[2:34] also it's clear brother Brandon had
[2:36] racial stereotypes his entire life and
[2:38] of course that was a result of being
[2:40] raised by a racist family of course no
[2:43] real believer supports any racial
[2:45] stereotypes today it seems there's a few
[2:48] reasons brother Branham had these
[2:50] stereotypes
[2:51] number one culturally he was raised in
[2:54] that type of environment sadly and then
[2:57] second all humans have some sinful
[2:59] traits that they battle over the course
[3:01] of their entire lives and these sinful
[3:03] traits that we all have as humans are
[3:06] not acceptable yet God has Mercy on each
[3:09] one of us each one of us sin every
[3:11] single day each one of us must rely on
[3:13] the blood of Jesus Christ
[3:15] all men have fallen short of God's glory
[3:18] but if we confess our sins Jesus Christ
[3:20] is faithful and just to forgive us of
[3:22] all unrighteousness
[3:24] I do also acknowledge that some
[3:27] so-called message churches are sinful
[3:30] churches and they could likely be racist
[3:32] of course they are not real Christians
[3:34] if they're racist and these churches
[3:36] should not even be called message
[3:38] churches because they don't obey the
[3:40] bible message that God sent brother
[3:42] Branham to restore
[3:43] and I also feel sorry for some of my
[3:46] brother Brandon's accusers who have left
[3:47] message churches because the message
[3:50] churches they left were sinful churches
[3:53] and were not good examples of message
[3:56] believers
[3:57] they were imposters and not real message
[4:00] believers
[4:01] but it's my hope through videos like
[4:03] mine and other message ministers who are
[4:06] genuine Christians that these accusers
[4:08] of brother Branham can repent of their
[4:10] false accusations and become real
[4:12] Christians
[4:13] and hopefully they will not stereotype
[4:15] all message Believers as sinful people
[4:18] just because the churches they attended
[4:20] that were called message churches were
[4:22] sinful churches
[4:24] here's the outline for the video friends
[4:25] first I'll share my personal experience
[4:28] with race in my childhood and in the
[4:32] message
[4:33] second we'll look at the false
[4:34] accusation against brother Branham about
[4:36] being a racist
[4:38] third we'll look at the presentism
[4:40] fallacy and the Civil Rights era
[4:43] fourth we'll show how brother random
[4:45] grew to love minorities through Jesus's
[4:48] love
[4:49] fifth we'll look at brother random
[4:51] stereotypes
[4:53] and six we'll look at two awful
[4:55] misunderstandings of anti-message
[4:58] leaders
[5:00] I'll begin with my personal experience
[5:03] with race
[5:04] as a child friends I was raised in a
[5:07] white Community I would say it was 99.9
[5:10] percent White
[5:11] and really my siblings and I were the
[5:13] minorities my mother is Mexican and my
[5:17] father is British and so my Skin's a
[5:21] little darker because the DNA of my
[5:23] mother and I remember in my elementary
[5:25] days I was really dark because I would
[5:28] be in the sun all summer long and one
[5:30] boy in particular called me the n-word
[5:32] and I would go home crying and my dad
[5:36] would try to make me feel better he
[5:38] would call me his only black son and I
[5:41] just had to learn to laugh it off but
[5:42] even to this day it's painful when I
[5:45] think about it that as a minority I was
[5:47] name called mocked and made fun of my
[5:50] brothers and I were even called slang
[5:52] terms for Mexicans which I'm not going
[5:55] to repeat on the video
[5:56] so growing up I felt like a minority and
[5:59] was mistreated on a few occasions
[6:01] but when it came to the message my
[6:03] experience with race and the message has
[6:05] been nearly 100 percent positive
[6:08] after hearing the message in late 2001 I
[6:11] chose to follow a message Pastor who was
[6:14] black in 2002
[6:17] and then this pastor even ordained me as
[6:20] a preacher and Pastor in 2004 and 2006
[6:24] respectively and even in our current
[6:27] home church here in Akron Ohio we're a
[6:29] very small church but we have numerous
[6:32] minorities here which we love we have
[6:35] African Asian Believers one Believer
[6:39] from Central America
[6:41] and so we rejoice in the diversity that
[6:43] God has blessed us with in this small
[6:45] Humble Church the only negative I've
[6:47] seen amongst the message churches I've
[6:49] been around is that some people have
[6:51] used
[6:52] stereotypes about minority groups which
[6:56] I do not repeat that stereotype is that
[6:59] a certain race of people can never be on
[7:01] time to church or church functions or
[7:04] other things and that's a sad sinful
[7:07] thing for people to make fun of certain
[7:09] ethnic groups because of their behaviors
[7:12] so I feel sorry for those people I pray
[7:15] those people will repent of their
[7:17] stereotypes and really their pride that
[7:20] exalts himself above other groups
[7:23] second let's look at the false
[7:25] accusation against brother Branham
[7:28] this accusation that brother Branham was
[7:31] racist comes from numerous voices
[7:33] it's come from podcasts videos websites
[7:36] with the false accusation
[7:39] is that brother Branham was quote
[7:40] clearly racist end quote one website
[7:44] says that
[7:45] another podcast said brother random's
[7:48] movement was a political movement and
[7:50] not a religious movement and that
[7:51] brother Brandon was a racist white
[7:53] supremacist
[7:54] and they share their conspiracies theory
[7:57] that brother Branham worked with the KKK
[7:59] and again his movement was political and
[8:02] of course these are all lies these are
[8:04] all false accusations
[8:06] the one podcast in question majored on
[8:09] how racism is this secret some
[8:13] conspiracy theory behind the scenes and
[8:15] message churches that brother random
[8:17] kept a secret he kept it private on the
[8:20] side of course this is a lie this is
[8:22] total presumption about brother Branham
[8:25] but again there might be message
[8:26] churches that are racist but clearly
[8:29] brother Branham was not racist by his
[8:31] own words and by his own actions
[8:33] and remember friends how can we believe
[8:36] men like brother Adam's accusers that
[8:38] have such corrupt fruits I gave this
[8:41] list in part one of my Jim Jones video
[8:44] showing how Jim Jones did not believe
[8:46] brother Ram's bible-based message but
[8:48] these men today that are accusers of
[8:50] brother Branham how can we trust them
[8:52] when they falsely claim brother Brandon
[8:54] plagiarize the Seven Seals yet I've
[8:57] already shown that that accusation is
[8:59] false there's over 38 differences
[9:01] between brother Branham Clarence Larkin
[9:03] and Charles Taze Russell and the Seven
[9:05] Seals and these men will not even
[9:07] address one of my 38 points when they
[9:10] make their rebuttal videos or whatever
[9:12] they just speak their narrative they
[9:14] don't even address the facts that I've
[9:16] laid out they won't even do honest
[9:18] research how can we trust them about
[9:20] this supposed racism accusation we can't
[9:24] trust them
[9:25] second these are people that say God is
[9:27] three persons they willingly add to the
[9:29] Bible with no scripture if they add to
[9:31] the Bible how can we trust them
[9:33] third that they describe their podcasts
[9:36] and videos as juicy showing their love
[9:39] for gossip which is a sin
[9:42] next they say things like Halloween is
[9:44] fun they watch Dracula movies they dress
[9:46] up like Dracula so they admire a
[9:49] blood-sucking fictional fornicator and
[9:52] murderer how can we trust people that
[9:55] enjoy these wicked things
[9:57] also they watch filthy Hollywood movies
[9:59] with cuss words sex scenes murders and
[10:03] more proving their hearts are not clean
[10:05] before God so they cannot be trusted
[10:08] they love the things of the world more
[10:10] than they love the things of God
[10:13] they also frequently misinterpret quotes
[10:15] from Brother Branham like the two at the
[10:17] end of this video they can't even listen
[10:19] with an honest heart how can we trust
[10:21] their research we can't trust their
[10:23] research
[10:24] they also say women can cut their hair
[10:26] despite Paul forbidding it in First
[10:28] Corinthians 11 1-16 and also the entire
[10:32] Bible forbidding it
[10:34] and lastly they say there's only one
[10:36] work of Grace which is a obvious clear
[10:38] lie they're essentially teaching that
[10:41] even a child is filled with the Holy
[10:42] Ghost after saying some scripted
[10:45] sinner's prayer
[10:46] and of course we know those children are
[10:48] not filled with the Holy Ghost they have
[10:49] no fruits that they are filled with the
[10:51] Holy Ghost
[10:52] the Bible says a tree is known by its
[10:54] fruit so we can't trust these type of
[10:56] researchers we can't trust Brothers
[10:58] accusers for these reasons and of course
[11:01] there's many more
[11:02] and friends I'm still praying for them
[11:04] to repent of their sins
[11:06] the presentism fallacy and the Civil
[11:09] Rights era
[11:10] today there's a presentism fallacy among
[11:13] liberals and now in this anti-message
[11:15] group or brother rounds accusers as I
[11:18] call them what is a presentism fallacy
[11:21] Webster's Dictionary defines it as an
[11:24] attitude toward the past dominated by
[11:26] present day attitudes and experiences
[11:30] so we can see presentism in liberals
[11:33] today today's liberals judge the
[11:35] founding fathers of the United States of
[11:37] America by today's cultural standards
[11:39] which is not fair liberals falsely claim
[11:42] the founding fathers hated minorities
[11:44] and approved of slavery of course that's
[11:47] a lie that's not true
[11:49] any honest person knows slavery was a
[11:51] major issue for the founding fathers
[11:53] some of them were born into families
[11:55] that owned slaves and it was illegal to
[11:58] set the slaves free
[12:00] they knew slavery was wrong and were
[12:02] trapped from making an instant change so
[12:05] they work to slowly change the system
[12:07] the founding fathers of the United
[12:09] States were against slavery but had to
[12:11] make gradual steps to end slavery
[12:13] because they needed the support of the
[12:14] southern states to exist as a union
[12:17] remember Thomas Jefferson penned the
[12:20] following the quotation all men are
[12:22] created equal is part of the sentence in
[12:24] the United States Declaration of
[12:25] Independence which Thomas Jefferson
[12:27] penned in 1776 during the beginning of
[12:30] the American Revolution
[12:32] and it reads we hold these truths to be
[12:34] self-evident that all men are created
[12:36] equal that they are endowed by their
[12:38] creator with certain unalienable rights
[12:40] that among these are life liberty and
[12:42] the pursuit of happiness notice the
[12:45] Constitution purposely calls all men
[12:47] equal because the authors believed all
[12:50] men were equal despite their skin color
[12:52] the second example is Jefferson's work
[12:55] with the Northwest Territory when the
[12:58] Northwest territory was purchased by
[13:00] Congress in the late 1700s it was
[13:03] purposely created without slavery so
[13:07] that's another proof the founding
[13:08] fathers were trying to get rid of
[13:10] slavery
[13:11] getting back to today's liberals in
[13:13] order to show their hypocrisy of this
[13:16] presentism fallacy why aren't liberals
[13:18] fighting modern slavery which is sex
[13:21] trafficking sex trafficking likely has
[13:24] hundreds of thousands of victims if not
[13:26] more why aren't they devoting more of
[13:28] their videos and podcasts and social
[13:30] media accounts to stopping trafficking
[13:33] the fact is they're Wicked sinners
[13:36] and they won't speak out against
[13:37] trafficking because they're probably a
[13:39] part of it and Friends each one of us
[13:41] has to ask ourselves that question
[13:44] what are liberals what are brothers
[13:46] accusers and even myself and the viewers
[13:49] what are we doing to stop slavery today
[13:51] what are we doing to stop sex
[13:53] trafficking today
[13:55] are you speaking out against it are you
[13:58] making monthly donations to
[13:59] organizations who work to set these
[14:01] modern day slaves free
[14:04] what about slave labor in other
[14:06] countries like Nike sweatshops are you
[14:09] supporting companies like Nike or even
[14:11] Walmart and Target that use sweatshops
[14:13] to produce cheap clothes
[14:15] what about the cheap labor that
[14:17] technology companies take advantage of
[14:19] to make the smartphones batteries for
[14:21] electric cars and more
[14:24] and what about some people having biases
[14:26] toward the homeless the poor and the
[14:28] beggars
[14:29] some have The Stereotype or bias that
[14:31] all homeless poor and Beggars are drug
[14:34] addicts but of course that's not true
[14:37] so we can clearly see the hypocrisy of
[14:39] modern liberals
[14:41] who are deceived by the presentism
[14:42] fallacy and now the accusers of the
[14:45] brother Branham have that same deception
[14:47] on them they're judging brother Branham
[14:50] by today's cultural standards which is
[14:53] unfair
[14:54] and of course they're misinterpreting
[14:56] brother Ram's quotes as well
[14:58] the honest fair approach is to put
[15:00] yourself in the person's shoes before
[15:02] making a judgment
[15:04] for example put yourselves in the
[15:05] founding father's shoes
[15:07] what if you were a genuine Christian one
[15:09] of the founding fathers and you're
[15:11] trying to change the culture and end
[15:13] slavery how would you do it
[15:15] if you can be honest and fair to the
[15:17] founding fathers of America then you can
[15:19] be honest and fair to brother Branham
[15:21] put yourself in brother Brandon's shoes
[15:23] what if you were raised in a very racist
[15:25] State like Indiana was
[15:27] and you were raised to be a racist how
[15:31] would you overcome
[15:32] would you overcome
[15:34] the facts are brother random did
[15:36] overcome racism when he became a genuine
[15:39] Christian
[15:40] he was a Holy Ghost Field prophet of God
[15:42] who fulfilled his commission to unite
[15:45] the body of Jesus Christ
[15:47] and he did it in the midst of a volatile
[15:49] Civil Rights era anyone who studied the
[15:52] Civil Rights era
[15:54] knows it was a very violent
[15:56] turbulent time
[15:58] but brother Brandon's bible-based
[15:59] message United all Races together and
[16:02] continues to do that in churches that
[16:04] have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:06] which we humbly believe our church is
[16:08] one of those examples having Africans
[16:10] Asians Americans Believers from Central
[16:13] America all coming together
[16:16] in one body the blood-bought body of the
[16:19] Lord Jesus Christ
[16:20] and before moving on there's also a
[16:22] criticism of Saint Paul
[16:24] and slavery the presentism fousey also
[16:28] criticizes Saint Paul for not calling
[16:30] for the abolishment of slavery in the
[16:32] Roman culture
[16:33] yet Jesus Christ ordained Paul to preach
[16:36] Jesus's gospel to the Gentiles
[16:39] and then in Romans 2 16 Paul said his
[16:42] gospel would judge all men
[16:44] so it's true Paul did not call for an
[16:47] end to slavery
[16:48] but this doesn't mean Jesus or Paul
[16:51] supported slavery it means god allowed
[16:54] it for a time and season like God has
[16:57] allowed free more agency all throughout
[16:59] human history
[17:00] God even allowed Israel to be in bondage
[17:02] of slavery in Egypt for hundreds of
[17:04] years before The Exodus through Moses
[17:09] friends the Lord God gives the promise
[17:11] that all men will be judged for their
[17:14] free moral agency decisions
[17:16] like Ecclesiastes 11 verse 9. the Bible
[17:20] says o young man know thou that for all
[17:22] these things God will bring thee into
[17:24] judgment
[17:25] second Corinthians 5 10 says for we must
[17:28] all appear before the Judgment seat of
[17:30] Christ that everyone may receive the
[17:33] things done in his body according to
[17:34] that he hath done whether it be good or
[17:36] bad
[17:38] so we can't criticize Paul who did not
[17:41] call for an end of slavery
[17:43] Paul could only preach what Christ
[17:45] called him to preach and it wasn't God's
[17:47] time at that time during Paul's life to
[17:49] end slavery but Paul gave the servants
[17:53] inspired words from Jesus Christ in
[17:56] First Corinthians 7 21 Paul said art
[17:58] thou call being a servant cared not for
[18:00] it but if thou mayest be made free use
[18:03] it rather
[18:04] for he that is called in the Lord being
[18:06] a servant it is the Lord's free man
[18:07] likewise also he that is called being
[18:10] free as Christ's servant
[18:12] so Paul by the leading of the Holy
[18:14] Spirit told the servants to not care for
[18:17] the fact that they were servants but if
[18:19] they could be made free use it for the
[18:21] glory of God
[18:23] and then in Colossians 3 22 Paul told
[18:25] servants to obey in all things your
[18:27] Masters according to the flesh
[18:29] fearing God and he told them whatsoever
[18:32] you do do it heartily as to the Lord and
[18:35] not to men and then he promised in
[18:37] Colossians 3 24 they would receive the
[18:40] reward of The Inheritance because they
[18:42] truly serve the Lord Christ
[18:45] remember in chapter 4 of Colossians Paul
[18:47] told the Masters
[18:49] be fair to your servants because you
[18:51] have a master in heaven so in Paul's
[18:54] gospel everyone was accountable
[18:56] the Masters were accountable to God the
[18:58] Masters had to treat their servants well
[19:00] and the servants had to work for the
[19:02] Masters like they were working for the
[19:04] Lord
[19:05] so as Bible Believers and Bible readers
[19:07] we have to accept that God allowed
[19:10] slavery God allows men to make their
[19:12] free moral agency and they'll be judged
[19:15] for the evil that they do
[19:17] you have to recognize Jesus did not call
[19:20] Paul to end slavery that was going to
[19:22] come later
[19:23] Paul's mission was to write the majority
[19:26] of the New Testament
[19:27] and as the Bible said he was to turn
[19:29] many from Darkness to the light of Jesus
[19:32] Christ The Gospel of Jesus Christ
[19:36] next we'll show how brother random grew
[19:38] to love minorities through Jesus's love
[19:41] this first quote is what I mentioned
[19:43] earlier from that time 1960 this shows
[19:46] the humility of brother Branham to admit
[19:48] to the listeners that he was raised in a
[19:50] racist environment but the blood of
[19:52] Jesus Christ changed him this should
[19:55] make us think more of brother Branham
[19:56] and his Godly character so you'll hear
[19:58] Brother Branham say I was a southerner
[20:00] and didn't like colored people but I met
[20:02] God and from that time I've Been Changed
[20:04] let's listen to the quote
[20:07] I want you to get this and don't you
[20:09] never let it pass from you what if a
[20:11] man's ever stood on that sacred Sands at
[20:15] the back side of the desert when he
[20:17] meets God face to face
[20:19] there's not enough Devils at all hell to
[20:21] take that away from him he knows he that
[20:24] God
[20:26] he knows he had an experience he talked
[20:29] to God
[20:30] regardless of what the opposition is he
[20:32] can say from that time something changed
[20:36] to me nice
[20:39] how well I can call the time
[20:42] hello Saloon that have been used as a
[20:45] church where some colored people was
[20:46] preaching the gospel
[20:48] I was a southerner and at light-colored
[20:51] people and a vision came and told me
[20:52] where to go find it
[20:55] and all the white girls that I've went
[20:57] with no 1145 stand there said Billy
[21:00] you're not going in there there I said
[21:01] yes I got to go
[21:04] so don't ever ask me for another date it
[21:06] didn't make any difference
[21:10] and from that time up it changed
[21:13] and point back to that time
[21:17] I was changed
[21:19] no man has a right before it
[21:22] until he's got an experience no matter
[21:26] what the intellectuals can say you know
[21:28] you met God
[21:32] in the next quote from serpent C 1958
[21:35] brother Ram said blacks were just as
[21:38] much human as white brother random
[21:40] quoted acts 17 26 while Iran said the
[21:43] black man is your brother he's the same
[21:46] acts 17 26 says hath made of one blood
[21:50] all nations of men for to dwell on all
[21:53] the face of the Earth and have to
[21:54] determine the times before appointed and
[21:56] the bounds of their inhabitation brother
[21:58] Branham stands up for minorities in this
[22:01] quote and said they're just as much
[22:03] human as the white people are let's
[22:05] listen to the quote
[22:10] in such a way someone said to me said
[22:12] they're nothing but animals and I said I
[22:13] beg your pardon
[22:16] they're just as much human As You Are
[22:20] maybe a little more
[22:22] let me tell you when you got that kind
[22:24] of an attitude you're getting back
[22:25] towards an animal
[22:26] I said that man of he's as black as the
[22:29] Ace of Spades or visas yellow as a
[22:31] pumpkin or if he's as blue his name he
[22:33] go he might save your life by giving you
[22:35] a blood transfusion but don't you never
[22:38] put an animal's blood in you
[22:41] certainly
[22:43] he's a human it's because one skin was
[22:46] black and the other Brown another
[22:48] uh yellow in the other and white that
[22:49] has nothing to do with it the Bible said
[22:52] God of one blood made all man
[22:55] that's exactly right the places we lived
[22:58] in changing our colors had nothing to do
[23:00] with it
[23:01] God made it one one man All Nations one
[23:04] blood All Nations the same the Chinese
[23:06] the colored man can't say enough the
[23:09] black man can't say no that that Chinese
[23:11] he's y'all ain't gonna have nothing to
[23:13] do with him he's your brother
[23:16] and you white men can't say to the
[23:18] yellow man or the black man either one I
[23:19] have nothing to do with you he's your
[23:20] brother
[23:22] exactly right
[23:25] the next quote the greatest battle ever
[23:27] fought brother Branham says we don't
[23:29] have any lines of color the family of
[23:31] God doesn't draw lines of color we're
[23:33] all Brothers and Sisters in Christ and
[23:36] he says he missed his black sister who
[23:38] had just passed away sister Bell let's
[23:40] listen to the quote
[23:42] and I'm sure that sister Belle loved our
[23:45] Lord amen she was a good woman now she's
[23:49] one of us
[23:52] and here we don't have any lines of
[23:54] color
[23:56] the family of God doesn't draw lines of
[23:59] color whether we're red brown black or
[24:01] yellow it doesn't matter white whatever
[24:03] it is we are Brothers and Sisters in
[24:06] Christ
[24:07] and so we we love her and we'll miss her
[24:11] the Tabernacle how will I miss sister
[24:14] Bell's that great big course a man back
[24:17] there in the corner
[24:19] and taking her up home should talk about
[24:21] the Lord Jesus
[24:25] the next quote questions and answers on
[24:27] Genesis 53 brother random stood up to
[24:29] say blacks are human brother Graham said
[24:32] blacks are off the same tree we are the
[24:35] same tree and there's no difference
[24:36] let's listen to the quote
[24:39] now it's been it's been a hope that my
[24:41] colored friends it's in here will excuse
[24:45] this remark because it's absolutely not
[24:48] right
[24:49] the first time I ever met anyone in my
[24:52] life uh after I've been converted I was
[24:56] met brother George D Arc and now I'm
[24:58] down there and I was walked in the Lord
[24:59] led me to a little place that is
[25:00] disgusting for the colored man came from
[25:03] and they were trying to say that the
[25:06] colored man that Cain married an animal
[25:10] like an eight and through there come
[25:13] forth the colored Rays now that's wrong
[25:17] absolutely that's wrong and don't never
[25:20] stand for that because there was no
[25:23] colored or white or any other
[25:24] differences Just One race of people into
[25:26] the flood
[25:28] that adds a flood and Tower of Babel
[25:30] when they begin to scatter out that's
[25:31] when they're taking their colors and so
[25:33] forth they're all come from the same
[25:35] tree that's exactly right Adam and Eve
[25:38] was the father and mother Earthly of
[25:40] every living creature of human beings
[25:43] that's ever been on the Earth
[25:45] that's right black white
[25:48] pale Brown yellow whatever color you
[25:51] might be that's absolutely the place
[25:54] that you live in
[25:57] again any questions and answers on
[25:58] Hebrews
[25:59] part 3 1957 brother random stood up to
[26:02] say blacks are human God made us in our
[26:05] colors and were all his children let's
[26:07] listen to the quote
[26:11] the way he wanted us and we're all his
[26:14] children amen absolutely amen and the
[26:17] art to fuss and carry on like that amen
[26:19] that's wrong to do that they shouldn't
[26:21] do it
[26:23] next in oh Lord just once more 1963
[26:26] brother random called blacks his
[26:28] Brethren that he loved he said they are
[26:30] God's people the same as we are let's
[26:33] listen to the quote
[26:35] I love my brethren my colored Brethren I
[26:37] wouldn't be in African around preaching
[26:39] to him but I didn't love him they're
[26:41] God's people
[26:42] the same as we are
[26:47] the Bible said of one blood God created
[26:50] All Nations
[26:52] we're all Brothers
[26:55] through the bloodstreet a colored man to
[26:58] give a white man a blood transfusion or
[27:00] vice versa now a white man can give the
[27:02] Japanese yellow man or the Indian the
[27:05] Red Man or want more
[27:07] or Japan
[27:09] or whatever he could give him a blood
[27:11] transfusion cause we're all the same
[27:13] blood
[27:13] the color of her skin where we live had
[27:16] nothing to do with it
[27:18] we're all human beings we all come from
[27:21] God God by one blood made all nations
[27:24] amen a colored man can give me a blood
[27:26] transfusion his blood's just the same as
[27:27] mine is mine says I give him one who am
[27:31] I to argue
[27:32] he's my brother
[27:35] in that same sermon oh Lord just once
[27:38] more brother random said slavery was
[27:40] never God's program God made man but
[27:43] man-made slaves brother random said
[27:45] we're to live together in unity and
[27:47] peace let's listen to the quote
[27:50] but back in the slave time
[27:53] they were selling slaves human beings
[27:55] like an auction block like they would
[27:57] have used car lot there's a buyer come
[28:00] forth through the country you need to
[28:02] buy them up and go sell them and make
[28:04] money on them just like you would on a
[28:06] used car or something
[28:08] never was God's program
[28:11] God made man man made slaves one's not
[28:15] to rule over the other or to live
[28:17] together in unity and peace
[28:21] in 1964 questions and answers part four
[28:24] brother Branham said blacks have souls
[28:27] he said they're my brothers and sisters
[28:29] and some of the finest people I ever met
[28:31] brother Branham called them precious
[28:33] people he said skin color means no
[28:36] difference to a born-again Christian
[28:38] Amen to that let's listen to the quote
[28:42] how can we find the will of the Lord or
[28:46] our home
[28:49] do should we move our home to
[28:51] Jeffersonville Indiana can a person be a
[28:54] Christian and dislike a colored people
[28:59] does God not want them to be uh treated
[29:03] like us
[29:04] cause they are dark in color
[29:09] would you what do you suggest in this do
[29:12] you believe in integration or
[29:14] segregation I believe in integration
[29:17] I believe that a man no matter what his
[29:20] color is or who he is he's a man just
[29:23] like I am it's exactly now I believe if
[29:26] they just leave those colored people
[29:27] alone and them Communists didn't get out
[29:29] there and Inspire them now they wanted
[29:31] now the real genuine colored people
[29:34] there's a genuine bunch of born-again
[29:36] Godly Saints and then people
[29:38] yes indeedy just because my skin is
[29:41] white and there's dark that don't mean
[29:43] one thing to me he's my brother if he's
[29:45] in Christ that's why different with the
[29:47] apricots message they didn't believe and
[29:49] believe those people had a soul that's
[29:51] what got me disliked there I said that
[29:53] man's a man is same as I am he's got the
[29:56] rights to the same privilege that I have
[29:58] his skin don't mean no difference to me
[30:00] or no other man is Born Again of the
[30:02] spirit of God but I said if they'd let
[30:05] those colored people alone there never
[30:07] would have been this as far and I said
[30:08] for Miss Pulpit we have lots of colored
[30:10] people that come here I don't think
[30:11] there's any here tonight but we have
[30:13] lots of colored people that come here to
[30:15] this church brother they're as welcome
[30:17] as anybody else is there are my brothers
[30:19] and sisters some of the finest people
[30:21] I've ever met in my life is some of them
[30:23] colored people then there's some of them
[30:24] that's Renegades just exactly like the
[30:27] white people or the yellow people or the
[30:28] brown people yes indeed
[30:31] again in questions and answers part 464
[30:34] brother random was ashamed of people
[30:36] that were against integration he said
[30:39] Born Again people believe blacks and
[30:41] whites are all the same let's listen to
[30:43] the quote
[30:44] and do you people don't believe in
[30:46] integration
[30:48] be ashamed of you our nation permits
[30:51] integration and we should do what the
[30:53] big boss says do it's exactly right and
[30:56] now say not to come in places and so
[30:58] forth like that or shop and they're set
[31:00] in the back of the bus and so forth no
[31:02] sir the law says they're just the same
[31:05] as we are so we're same as they are so
[31:08] let's act that way let's be that way and
[31:10] that's exactly what all really true
[31:12] born-again people believe
[31:15] again in questions answers part 4 64.
[31:19] brother Branham believed all men are
[31:21] born equal let's listen to the quote
[31:24] I never had such a feeling for people as
[31:25] I have now poor people in Africa the way
[31:27] they were treated and I do not believe
[31:29] in that stuff I'm a southerner I was
[31:31] born across the river honor but I'm like
[31:33] Abraham Lincoln I come yearly calls I
[31:36] believe that men were born equal that's
[31:39] right and I do not believe in separating
[31:42] people and things like that when that
[31:43] people baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[31:46] so forth
[31:47] and again in that same sermon questions
[31:49] answers part 4 64. brother Ram said the
[31:52] blacks who are born again are precious
[31:55] Souls who are born again of the spirit
[31:57] of God let's listen to the quote
[31:59] to prove my porn is clear after they
[32:02] have integration they have it now
[32:04] legally lawfully they're causing more
[32:07] trouble now than if the first place
[32:09] see it shows that it is communism and
[32:13] not them precious Souls that's born to
[32:16] the spirit of God
[32:18] next let's look at brother branham's
[32:20] stereotypes
[32:22] first let's define a stereotype a
[32:24] stereotype is a conventional formulaic
[32:27] and oversimplified conception opinion or
[32:30] image
[32:32] so basically a stereotype is an opinion
[32:34] that's incomplete
[32:36] so I want to say stereotypes are never
[32:38] right
[32:39] stereotypes if not confessed are still
[32:42] sins like Pride like mocking others or
[32:46] making fun of others
[32:47] and one simple example is Saint Peter
[32:50] from The Book of Galatians chapter 2.
[32:53] here we have a Bible precedent of a holy
[32:55] ghost-filled man a man with the keys to
[32:58] the kingdom of God battling racism due
[33:01] to fear of his Jewish brethren in
[33:04] Galatians 2 verses 11 through 14 Paul
[33:07] blamed Peter for isolating himself as a
[33:11] Jew from the Gentiles and Paul withstood
[33:14] him to his face because he was to be
[33:16] blamed and Paul said that Peter walked
[33:18] not uprightly according to the truth of
[33:20] the Gospel
[33:21] and the Bible said Peter separate
[33:23] himself from the Gentiles because of
[33:25] fear fear of his Jewish brethren
[33:28] so friends Peter was Holy Ghost filled
[33:31] according to Acts chapter 2 but yet he
[33:33] struggled with segregation and it's
[33:35] recorded in the scripture a similar
[33:37] truth can be about brother random
[33:39] struggling with racial issues or
[33:41] stereotypes in the Civil Rights era and
[33:44] friends I don't want to repeat some of
[33:45] the stereotype words and phrases that
[33:47] brother random used I don't think it's
[33:49] necessary I don't think it'll be
[33:51] beneficial or edifying to anyone and I
[33:54] believe brother Ram's accusers wouldn't
[33:55] want their stereotypes or their sins
[33:58] repeated publicly and shared before
[34:00] everybody so that's why I'm not going to
[34:02] do that to brother Branham
[34:04] so to summarize this section it's clear
[34:06] brother Branham had stereotypes of
[34:09] course they were shaped by his culture
[34:10] and the social norms of those times but
[34:14] clearly as I showed through the other
[34:15] quotes brother random loved his black
[34:18] Brethren and he named all the different
[34:20] skin colors saying we're all God's
[34:21] children we're all one body the body of
[34:24] Jesus Christ and friends let's not judge
[34:27] brother Branham because we all have
[34:29] opinions that are not complete
[34:31] for my viewers watching this video
[34:33] who would be foolish enough to say his
[34:36] or her conception on every single issue
[34:38] is perfect I'm sure none of us would
[34:41] claim that that every one of our
[34:43] opinions especially about sensitive
[34:45] topics are perfect and complete the
[34:48] reality of it is is that we all fall
[34:50] short of God's glory in some way or
[34:52] another
[34:53] so let's avoid getting into the
[34:55] presentism fallacy by judging brother
[34:58] Branham based upon today's cultural
[35:01] norms and standards
[35:02] let your grace to brother Branham just
[35:04] like we'd want someone to show Grace To
[35:06] Us despite our stereotypes because it's
[35:09] true everybody has some stereotype
[35:11] everybody has some opinion that's not
[35:13] complete there's no perfect person
[35:16] except the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:18] now let's look at two awful
[35:20] misunderstandings of brother Ram's
[35:23] accusers the first one is the blood boil
[35:25] misunderstanding and the second
[35:28] misunderstanding is that brother Branham
[35:30] was a segregationalist
[35:32] so the first awful misunderstanding is
[35:35] from one of Brothers accusers it's from
[35:37] the sermon oh Lord just once more 1963
[35:40] June 28th in the morning service brother
[35:44] Brandon was speaking about integration
[35:45] between black and white schools and
[35:48] brother Branham said quote so they don't
[35:50] need those things end quote in this
[35:53] statement my brother Branham was
[35:54] completely taken out of context by
[35:56] Warner Brothers accusers on a podcast
[35:59] the accuser was trying to say that
[36:01] brother Branham was saying black people
[36:03] don't need schools swimming pools and so
[36:06] forth brother Ram's accuser was trying
[36:08] to say that brother Branham didn't think
[36:10] blacks deserved anything and of course
[36:13] that's a lie if you listen to the
[36:15] context which we will in a few moments
[36:17] brother Brandon was saying the blacks
[36:19] with better schools did not need to go
[36:23] to the white schools because they
[36:25] already had Better Built schools they
[36:28] already had modern schools and brother
[36:30] Brown was telling this story he said of
[36:33] an old black brother who stood up that
[36:36] morning in a riot and he said there look
[36:38] at our schools they got swimming pools
[36:40] they got better schools and everything
[36:42] why do we want to go to their schools
[36:44] end quote
[36:45] so brother Ram said there was a riot and
[36:47] a black man stood up and said why do we
[36:49] want to go to the white schools we've
[36:51] already got better schools than what
[36:52] they have and so then brother Rams said
[36:54] God's got a variety brother random gave
[36:57] a stereotype he said a white man is
[36:59] always stewing and worrying a colored
[37:00] man is satisfied in the state he's in so
[37:03] they don't need those things of course
[37:06] no real believer supports any racial
[37:08] stereotypes today
[37:10] so let me State clearly brother Brandon
[37:12] was quoting an old black man who said
[37:15] our black community already has swimming
[37:18] pools we already have better schools
[37:20] than the whites why do we want to go to
[37:22] their schools and then brother Branham
[37:24] said that group of black people they
[37:27] don't need those things they didn't need
[37:29] a better school they already had good
[37:31] schools
[37:33] so brother man was not being racist in
[37:35] that context he was saying that black
[37:37] community already had better schools
[37:39] than the white community so they didn't
[37:41] actually need to go to the white schools
[37:44] if it was just about facilities
[37:46] let's listen to the quote
[37:48] there remember that old colored brother
[37:52] standing up that morning in that Rod yes
[37:55] the militia if he could speak he said I
[37:57] never was ashamed of being a black man
[37:59] mom maker made me a black man but this
[38:01] morning I'm ashamed the way my race is
[38:03] acted what's them people doing to us
[38:05] only been good to us a white woman
[38:08] raised up and said I don't want my
[38:09] children in school by a white woman said
[38:11] because they she won't pay the the
[38:14] interest take interest in my children
[38:16] like a colored woman was in my own race
[38:18] said they're so look at our schools they
[38:20] got swimming pools they got better
[38:21] schools and everything why do we want to
[38:23] go to their schools that's right
[38:27] I believe God is a God
[38:31] of
[38:32] of well I'd say he's a god of variety
[38:36] he makes big mountains and little
[38:38] mountains he makes deserts he makes for
[38:40] us
[38:42] he makes white man black man red man we
[38:44] should never cross that up
[38:46] and becomes a hybrid and anything hybrid
[38:49] cannot re-breed itself
[38:52] you're a ruining the race of people
[38:55] there's some things about a colored man
[38:57] that a white man don't even possess them
[38:59] tree a white man's always stewing and
[39:02] wearing a color man satisfied in the
[39:03] state he's in
[39:04] though they don't need those things
[39:09] the second awful misunderstanding is a
[39:12] quote from doors and door February 6
[39:15] 1965 one of Brothers accusers on his
[39:18] website said that brother Branham taught
[39:21] you were not a Christian unless you
[39:23] believed in racial segregation and of
[39:27] course this is a lie this shows the
[39:29] cognitive dissonance of brother Adam's
[39:32] accuser he can't even honestly listen to
[39:34] a quote from Brother Branham without
[39:35] putting his false narrative or his false
[39:38] interpretation on the quote so in the
[39:40] quote brother Brandon is talking about
[39:42] how God always separates his people from
[39:45] unclean things he talked about how God
[39:49] pulled Israel out of all the races of
[39:51] the world because God is a
[39:52] segregationalist and brother Brandon
[39:54] says I don't believe one should rule
[39:56] over other any race color or anything so
[39:59] brother Ram clearly says he's not for
[40:01] slavery notice brother Graham said you
[40:03] cannot be a Christian and be an
[40:04] integrationist
[40:06] but if you keep listening brother was
[40:08] talking about integrating with sin
[40:10] Christians cannot allow sin to come into
[40:13] their lives or come into their churches
[40:15] he's not talking about racial
[40:17] integration he's talking about churches
[40:20] should not integrate with sin and then
[40:22] Brothers says but there is a segregation
[40:24] the bride of Christ is segregated from
[40:26] the rest of the churches that's exactly
[40:28] right Church natural and the church
[40:30] Spiritual Church carnal and the Church
[40:32] of the word
[40:33] so brother Branham was referring to the
[40:36] Bride of Jesus Christ that she is
[40:38] spiritually segregated from sin and
[40:40] denominations proven by the context of
[40:43] brother Ram's quote which brother Ram's
[40:46] accuser ignored and then brother Ram's
[40:48] accuser ignored the scripture brother
[40:50] Branham used he said it has always been
[40:52] Jesus came to his own his own received
[40:54] and not but as many as received him
[40:57] so brother man shows how Jesus was
[40:59] rejected by the Jews so Jesus had to be
[41:03] segregated with the Believers his little
[41:05] group who followed him that's the
[41:08] segregation Brothers talking about
[41:09] segregating oneself away from sin into
[41:14] the true group of Believers brother man
[41:16] was not talking about racial segregation
[41:19] let's listen to the quote
[41:21] I am an integrationist absolutely I mean
[41:24] a segregationist I am a segregationist
[41:26] because I don't care how much they argue
[41:28] you cannot be a Christian to be an
[41:30] immigration
[41:31] that's exactly right God even separates
[41:34] his Nations he separates these people
[41:36] come out from among them he's a he is a
[41:39] segregationist
[41:40] don't even touch not through unclean
[41:42] things he pulled Israel uh the Jewish
[41:45] race out of every all the races of the
[41:46] world he is a segregationist
[41:48] but I don't believe that any man is to
[41:51] be a Slave
[41:53] God made man man made slaves I know what
[41:56] he wants to drool over are there any
[41:57] race color or anything but there is a
[41:59] segregation the bride of Christ is
[42:01] segregated from the rest of the churches
[42:03] that's exactly right
[42:05] Church National a church spiritual
[42:08] Church carnal the church the word
[42:11] it always has been Jesus came to his own
[42:14] his own received enough but as many has
[42:16] received him
[42:17] old Abraham Lincoln stuck that under his
[42:19] head his head on his arm like that he
[42:21] said that's wrong
[42:23] someday uh get that if it cost my life
[42:26] in the honored a museum in Chicago
[42:28] lays a dress with the blood on it freed
[42:32] that negro from that I see that sin and
[42:35] things is wrong God help me to get it
[42:38] and all other ministers of the Gospel
[42:42] we are born free children of God we have
[42:45] no business for any Creed or to run us
[42:48] into a world Council of churches we are
[42:51] free of our man in the Holy Ghost we
[42:52] have a right we come out of such stuff
[42:54] is that to be pinnacle
[42:56] right
[42:57] now we are free we don't have to be
[43:00] bound down to those things again
[43:04] and friends I could give many other
[43:06] awful misinterpretations of brother
[43:08] Adam's quote from Brother random's
[43:10] accusers for example I made a video a
[43:13] couple years ago brother Ram's accuser
[43:15] claimed brother Brandon pretended to
[43:17] speak in tongues
[43:19] I made a video showing how the accuser
[43:22] misunderstood brother Graham's quote I
[43:24] sent it to the brother and he never even
[43:26] acknowledged that he got it and I've
[43:28] sent it to a couple different Brothers
[43:29] in his group and they won't even respond
[43:32] to it they won't even acknowledge that
[43:34] they're wrong so how can we help people
[43:36] when they won't even allow themselves to
[43:37] be helped all we can do is pray for
[43:39] their genuine repentance
[43:41] for other brands accusers just continue
[43:43] to make lies all these false accusations
[43:46] it's incredibly sad so we must stand for
[43:49] the truth declare the truth and pray for
[43:51] their repentance
[43:53] in closing
[43:55] friends I hope this video has been a
[43:56] blessing I try to keep it a little
[43:58] shorter on purpose so I could get it out
[44:00] a little earlier by the grace of God
[44:02] perhaps I can make a follow-up video If
[44:04] people have good comments or questions
[44:06] or Bible verses in the comments section
[44:09] below and of course I'm always open to
[44:11] correction friends if I said anything
[44:13] wrong please forgive me I believe I'm a
[44:15] holy ghost filled Christian doing the
[44:17] best I can to rightly divide the word of
[44:19] Truth and with a sensitive subject like
[44:21] this I just asked the Lord to give me
[44:23] Grace to show brother random was not a
[44:26] racist Brotherhood loved all the races
[44:28] all the skin colors because he was a
[44:30] holy ghost-filled Christian
[44:32] and again friends after studying this
[44:34] subject I think more brother random than
[44:37] I did before he was able to Humble
[44:39] himself and admit he was raised to be
[44:41] racist but he overcame it he was changed
[44:44] by the Holy Spirit and I love how he
[44:47] quoted numerous Bible verses about how
[44:50] all men are created equal all men are
[44:52] created by God such as acts 17 verse 26.
[44:56] so I'll end with that scripture and hath
[44:58] made of one blood all nations of men for
[45:00] to dwell on all the face of the Earth
[45:02] and have determined the times before
[45:04] appointed and the bounds of their
[45:06] habitation God is made of one blood all
[45:09] nations of men to dwell on this Earth
[45:10] and may those of us who claim to be
[45:13] baptized with the Holy Ghost may we go
[45:15] forth from this moment and show the love
[45:17] of Jesus Christ to every skin color
[45:19] Every Nation every Kindred tribe and
[45:22] tongue may we show them the love of
[45:24] Jesus Christ just like brother Branham
[45:26] did
[45:28] if you have any questions concerns or
[45:30] testimonies about this video please
[45:31] contact me
[45:33] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[45:36] the desire of your heart
[45:38] foreign
