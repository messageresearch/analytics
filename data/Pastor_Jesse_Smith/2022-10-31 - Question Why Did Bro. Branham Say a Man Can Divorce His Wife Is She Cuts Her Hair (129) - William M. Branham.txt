Description:
A viewer asked why Brother Branham said with "Thus saith the Lord" that a man can divorce his wife is she cuts her hair in 1956. The context of Brother Branham's statement seems to show that he is rebuking American women for cutting their hair, which is a great dishonor, or repulse to their husbands, Christ, and God according to 1 Corinthians 11:5. Brother Branham, though, was not giving men permission to divorce their wives and then remarry other women. 

The balance to Brother Branham's 1956 statement is that God hates divorce, and any man who would choose the severe and sad decision to divorce his wife for dishonoring him could not remarry another woman without being an adulterer.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Applause] greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question why did Brother Branham say with thus saith the Lord that a man could divorce his wife if she cut her hair to summarize it seems brother Branham said this because he was trying to remind the backslidden listeners that it is a great dishonor or repulse for a woman to cut her hair according to First Corinthians 11 verse 5. as the Greek lexicon's definition of Dishonor means a repulse but let me State clearly that the man who would make this severe and rash decision to divorce his wife for cutting her hair could not remarry another woman without committing adultery any man who divorces his wife for cutting her hair and then marries another woman is living in adultery and therefore cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus and his Bible are clear that any man that would divorce his wife for cutting her hair and then remarry would be living in adultery and thus would not inherit the kingdom of God according to Matthew 5 32 First Corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11 and Galatians 5 verses 19 through 21. an honest man that would divorce his wife for cutting her hair is sentencing himself to a single life according to the Bible and God's Prophet brother Branham it would seem the best decision a husband could make if his wife was cutting her hair would be to pray for his wife to come to repentance for dishonoring him Christ and God as a pastor I personally would never recommend a man divorce his wife if she cut her hair and later in the video I'll explain the reasons why but on a personal note friends divorce is so sad and so evil as I and my siblings live through my parents divorce it was the single most traumatic experience of my life and I'm not condemning my parents but just sharing it as a humble warning to the listeners I also realize there are many more more traumatic experiences a person can have and experience outside of divorce but I'm just sharing my life experience and I also realize I've been sheltered from more traumatic events but my parents divorce was the single most traumatic experience in my life and another personal note is that when I first heard this quote from Brother Branham I did not understand it I was very surprised to hear Brother Adam say this that a man could divorce his wife if she cut her hair I've never understood it but I feel like in time God has given me understanding and I feel like now I could answer this question both with scripture and also with sound advice or wisdom for married couples by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ let me also say that this thus saith the Lord quote from Brother Branham that says a man can divorce his wife for cutting her hair is very easily misunderstood and misused by Satan if a person does not know his Bible and other brother random quotes friends God hates divorce and of course so do I and that's according to Malachi 2 verse 16. and I have never supported a divorce in my life I do understand some domestic situations are so serious that a separation is required usually for the woman's safety but again the Bible's clear about divorce God hates divorce here's the outline for the video first we'll review marriage and divorce which includes the only cause for remarriage after a divorce second we'll look at the 1956 thus saith the Lord quote from Brother Branham and will Define dishonor and lastly we'll look at some reasons I believe a man should not divorce his wife if she cuts her hair reviewing marriage and divorce and the only cause for remarriage after divorce friends as my two YouTube videos about marriage and divorce plainly teach there is one and only one condition that God allows divorce and remarriage which is unconfessed fornication this is a very short summary but the proof of this is found in two verses in the gospel of Matthew Matthew 5 32 Jesus said but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery notice that Jesus says saving for the cause of fornication this means unconfessed fornication or sex before marriage on the part of an Engaged or espoused person so any unconfessed fornication that is found out later annuls the engagement vow of course these types of situations are very very rare and again in Matthew chapter 1 verse 19 there's a clear Bible example that shows the only cause for remarriage after divorce and that is Matthew 1 verse 19. which says then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately so the Bible example is Joseph and Mary were vowed to each other and in the eyes of God they were already married but they weren't married yet physically and of course you probably know the story Mary conceived of the Holy Ghost the holy Child Jesus was conceived in her womb and she started showing Joseph found out and thought that Mary had committed fornication so Joseph was going to divorce her privately and then of course Joseph could have remarried if Mary had sinned but of course Mary did not sin Mary had conceived of the Holy Ghost so this Bible example is what Jesus is referring to in Matthew 5 32 saving for the cause of fornication this Bible example shows how serious a vow is between two people that are engaged or espoused in marriage so now we can clearly see the revelation of marriage and divorce how there's only one cause that allows a man to remarry after divorce and that is unconfessed fornication because the woman gave a false vow to the man and again this type of situation is very very rare this means friends there should be very very few divorces around those of us who claim to believe the message of the hour let's go through a few quotes from Brother Branham that forbid remarriage after divorce in the first quote from 1962 questions and answers brother Branham says a married couple can separate but they cannot remarry just like First Corinthians 7 says Paul said If a person depart they have two choices either stay apart or be reconciled they cannot marry again let's listen to the quote or the woman say to her husband I'm not going to mix up with that bunch of Holy Rollers I'm not going to do this I'll separate and leave you don't you leave the church you let her leave a brother or a sister is not under but putting you away and wants to depart for it you don't have to just hold on to him if they're wanting to leave you and they're going to leave you for the cause of Christ let them leave but [Music] God has called us unto peace he's already stated that but you don't have to live with an unbelieving husband or an unbelieving wife here's a second quote from 1961 questions and answers brother Brown said he would not remarry his own blood brother who had a living spouse so brother Brandon would not marry his own brother because he would have then been living in adultery let's listen to the quote if you notice what Jesus said am I here I got a brother my own blood brother that's fixing to marry a woman and my brother has been married before and got a child by a good woman and he come to me to marry him and I said not at all said in Matthew whosoever puts away his wife and marries another saving the cause of fornications what she had to do before she was married and didn't tell him about it causes her to commit adulter whosoever marries her that is put away liveth in adultery so don't do that no you cannot go back to your to your first wife if she's been married again here in this final quote from marriage and divorce in 1965 brother random quotes Matthew 5 32 as I did earlier brother and plainly states what Jesus said when he said saving for the cause of fornication and again this quote has to line up with the other quotes brother Braham said that say there is no remarriage after divorce saving for the cause of unconfessed fornication friends many people misunderstand the marriage and divorce sermon from 1965 but that's because they don't pray enough about it they don't seek the Bible enough about it let's listen to the quote I want you to know sure to support this same idea of one in many Matthew 30 uh I think it's Matthew 5 32. 31 to begin with it has been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement us Jesus speaking once said from the beginning my wife but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving the cause of fornications causes her two commit adultery see whosoever shall put away his wife saving the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery watch your Mary again and whosoever married her and is divorced committed adultery see she's got a living husband so no man can marry her I don't care what she does and who she is she's got a living husband there's no grounds for her at all but it's not for him causes her not him get it you'll have to make the word running continuity see nothing's saying he couldn't but she can't okay causes her not him that's exactly what the Bible says here it is not stated against him to remarry but her and the time the 1956 thus saith the Lord quote and a definition for dishonor before we listen to this quote from God's Prophet brother Branham I want to State four details about it to help us correctly understand it first brother Brahm is preaching on Luke 7 verse 36. that's the context of his sermon where the sinner woman uses her long hair to wash Jesus's feet it's obvious she could not have washed his holy feet with bobbed hair and the Bible never records God asking any godly woman to cut her hair so in the context brother Branham is rebuking modern women for cutting their hair when there is absolutely no Bible Authority for a Godly woman to cut her hair second brother Branham never says the man who divorces his wife can remarry an honest person will listen to the quote and realize brother Branham never says the man can remarry another woman so in other words many people add to this quote from 1956 they add their own interpretation to their own shame these people likely add to the Bible as well they add their own human interpretations or their own human opinions third we must not take away or delete other quotes and scriptures when we listened to this 1956 quote for example like God hates divorce in Malachi 2 verse 16. friends we cannot ignore so many other quotes from Brother Branham that command a couple to stay together if at all possible and never marry a second third or more time and fourth friends remember when a woman cuts her hair she's trying to assert Authority like when she puts on man's pants and friends I've seen this in my own life I've heard numerous women in passing say they're going to go get their hair cut and show their husband who's the Boss and these women are not even message believers they understand when they cut their hair they're dishonoring their husband and taking control in the marriage now friends let's listen to the quote from 1956 from the worst sinner in the city [Applause] [Applause] stay up the Lord too bad you got away from the old-fashioned training good one you used to sing a song as far as we compromise with sin put it out of the bars that she got out but how did the goats get in he just went out yes [Applause] that's the way you gotta come to him [Applause] amen [Applause] now let's define dishonor in First Corinthians 11 verse 5 because this will show us the Divine severity of a woman cutting her hair and also a man letting his hair grow uncut so we want to be fair we want to show the dishonor of a woman cutting her hair but also a husband growing his hair out uncut a wife who cuts her hair is a great dishonor as First Corinthians 11 verse 5 says and she dishonors her head which is her husband and then in turn that dishonors his head who is Christ and the head of Christ who is the Father Almighty invisible God First Corinthians 11 verse 5 says but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoreth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven in the Greek dishonor means to dishonor disgrace to put the shame blush with shame one is said to be put to shame who suffers a repulse or whom some Hope Has deceived so according to the infallible gospel that Jesus Christ revealed to Paul according to Galatians 1 verse 12. and which will judge the secrets of every man's heart according to Romans 2 verse 16 and which cannot be added to or taken away without a curse coming upon a person according to Galatians 1 verses 6 through 12 a wife that cuts her hair shames her husband and should make the husband blush with shame and causes him to suffer a repulse which is intense distaste so notice the severity of the dishonor a woman puts upon her husband when she cuts her hair it is a repulse intense distaste so this is why I believe brother random gave this warning in 1956 but again brother Branham never said the man could remarry now the same dishonor is true for a man who doesn't cut his hair he's a shame or vile according to First Corinthians 11 verse 14 the scripture says doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him and shame means vile shame reproach dishonor disgrace so let's not leave out the warning against brothers who would grow out their hair and leave it uncut they would be dishonoring Christ and God friends another important scripture is revelation 9 verse 8 speaking of the fifth trumpet which is God's Wrath during the tribulation period the Bible said and they which were the locusts that come out of the Earth had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions and the Bible says power was given to them to hurt men five months in Revelation 9 verse 10. so these scriptures show that God is going to torment Sinners who cut their hair during the tribulation period God allows these locusts to have long hair like women to torment the women who cut their hair and Bob their hair and assert the authority of their husbands or their fathers so we can see how this verse lines up with First Corinthians 11 verse 5. it is a great dishonor for a woman to cut her hair it's a great dishonor for a man to grow out his hair long and Uncut and this reminds me of a quote from Brother Branham where he said the closer you get to heaven the closer you get to the glory of God and the incredibly holy presence of Jesus Christ were the angels of God are crying holy holy holy the more sinful that sin really is let's listen to the quote now we'll take the Pentecostal woman she shouldn't wear shorts make up her cut her hair but she looks back down at the Methodist say look at that woman do so and so say the woman don't wear shorts he said look at herself with a volunteer how are you Rising God the more sinful a whole thing looks and then sometimes in prayer you can imagine for the Holy Spirit thank you there in the whole thing of scales then when they come back down you seem like you're the people you're a rascal yeah yeah nothing but an old sarcastic you're a fool because you stand as an old crazy people whatever kind of them spheres where you can be in the presence of the emotion and your mind Holy Spirit lifting up the whole thing is the glory of the Lord has departed from the whole denominational outfit none of them that's right other reasons a man should not divorce his wife for cutting your hair friends here's a few reasons I think a man should not divorce his wife for simply cutting her hair first the husband has probably Dishonored his wife repeatedly and so why would a husband divorce his wife for dishonoring him when he's probably Dishonored her as well friends I'll just be honest and use my own marriage I think in my own marriage I probably dishonor my wife more than she dishonors me my wife has never cut her hair but of course she still sins every day like I sin every day but it's my opinion I proudly sinned against her way more than she sinned against me so why would I or any other man want to be so harsh against our wives if they Dishonored us and how could we be so harsh when we're guilty of the same type of Dishonor I believe it's hypocritical and sinful for a man to divorce his wife or dishonor if he is also dishonoring his wife and this is commanded in scripture first Peter 3 verse 7 commands husbands to honor their wives likewise your husbands dwell with him according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered notice God will not hear husbands prayers if they dishonor their wives and remember according to Malachi 2 God is the witness between the husband and the wife and God will chase in the husband who mistreats his wife if he dishonors his wife husband should honor their wives because she is both your spouse and your sister another reason I believe husband should not divorce their wives for cutting their hair is because you made a vow to love her until death and brothers didn't you love your wife when you married her and didn't you want to love her unto death as long as you both lived as husbands and leaders we cannot forget the vows we made we cannot forget the first love we had for our wives another reason is as a husband as a man you're supposed to be like Christ loving the church isn't Christ merciful and forgiving and patient with his church when his church dishonors the word of God brother Branham said we sin daily no doubt the Bible agrees with that Paul said I Must Die daily so in the spiritual sense all of us as part of the church we daily dishonor Christ we think the wrong thoughts we say the wrong words we sin against God and yet God is merciful when we dishonor him he's merciful to convict us and then forgive us of our sins and one final reason is Brothers didn't you marry your wife because you believe she was your Eternal mate in glory sometimes Brothers forget that quote from Brother Branham where he said your wife should be your Eternal mate in glory always your sweetheart and the quotes where he said never let your honeymoon end a man whose wife cuts her hair should be patient should be prayerful should commit her soul to God stay with her be patient with her pray for her if she's open to it help explain the word of God and what it says about cutting hair take an eternal perspective to the situation think that you're going to spend eternity with this eternal mate and you'll love her and be patient with her until she's able to repent and fully obey the word of God in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing this topic has always been a question on my heart since I heard this quote from 1956 but I believe now by the grace of God the Holy Spirit has directed me to other quotes from Brother Branham and of course many other scriptures where I'm able to give a sound biblical response to the question why did brother Brandon say this any honest person will see how the Bible plainly says a woman cutting her hair dishonors her husband repulses her husband but also an honest person will say that a man should never dishonor his wife so both the husband and wife need to honor one another they should be patient kind loving with one another they should have the love of First Corinthians 13. charity is patient charity is kind charity thinketh no evil charity can suffer all things when one spouse dishonors the other the one who's Dishonored with God's love should have long suffering for their spouse and Friends remember God hates divorce when dishonor happens in a marriage the spouse who is Dishonored must devote serious time to prayer fasting seeking God finding the leading of the Lord and I believe if a person does that if a spouse does that God will show them first Corinthians 13 and they'll Express all 16 of those attributes of divine love to their spouse if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
