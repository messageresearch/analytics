[Music] what now you say how could he be God and be man see that is the mystery see in body he was man in spirit he was [Applause] God greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer six questions about the godhead the first being did Jesus pray to himself so recently I received numerous emails and also comments on YouTube asking questions about the godhead and these are excellent questions I've even been asked questions about the godhead at a message church I visited numerous times over the summer preaching to the Saints trying to encourage the Saints helping out a new church that's recently com to the message and they had great questions about the godhead remember of course the Bible calls the godhead a mystery in Colossians 2:2 the Bible said to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ it's notable that Paul did not mention the Holy Ghost notice he just said God and of the father and of Christ I think that's a very fitting statement by the Apostle Paul because there is no mystery regarding the godhead about the father and the Holy Ghost they are not two separate persons the father is the Holy Ghost the father is the Holy Spirit and I know there are other three-fold references in the scripture about father Son and Holy Ghost but I just think it's it's very fitting that St Paul the one that Jesus commissioned to write about the godhead being a mystery points out the main mystery being between the father and the son of course I believe there's one person in the godhead as all my videos and my two books discuss I believe it's tritheism or polytheism to call God three persons I believe trinitarianism is heresy and of course we'll get into that in this video as well by God's grace but we recognize the godhead is is mysterious no doubt about that as Paul said we must acknowledge this mystery before getting into the six questions I just want to review eight principles about the godhead I wrote about in my 2021 book it's on pages 23-32 the eight principles are the Trinity Dogma adds to the Bible so we must learn to never add to the Bible we must use Bible words about the godhead second Jesus and his Apostles affirmed pure mind monotheism not tritheism so the authors of the Bible never use the word Trinity two persons three persons second person nor third person so we must not use it Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 say if we add to the Bible plagues will be added to us and God will call us a liar on the day of judgment third the athian Creed contains many contradictions so that again that's why we don't focus on Creeds our Creed is the entire Bible fourth trinitarians have major Bible contradictions and inconsistencies fifth the Trinity leaders did not affirm that the Holy Spirit was divine until 381 ad yet Old Testament Jews and New Testament Believers all knew the Holy Ghost was divine because the father is the Holy Ghost sixth Trinity artwork is deceptive and unbiblical seventh trinitarians use fear tactics to persuade people to accept the Trinity such as the fear tactic of being called a heretic and the fear tactic of saying you'll go to hell if you don't believe in three persons but of course the Bible never teaches three persons and eighth and finally God sent his Prophet brother William brandham to warn of the false Trinity Doctrine in 1961 brother R said thus sayi the Lord trinitarianism is of the devil but he said trinitarians can be saved because the godhead is not a Salvation issue it's a doctrinal issue now my precious brother I know this is a tape also now don't get excited let me say this with Godly love the hours approach where I can't hold still on these things no more too close to the coming see trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus sayith the Lord amen look where it come from it come from the N seeing Council when the Catholic Church become in rulership the word Trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the Bible and as far as three Gods that's from Hell there's one God it's exactly right now do you say then you believe it all these people that as trinitarians are of hell no sir I believe they are Christians but the hour is approaching brother where they are sincerely wrong so now getting to question number one did Jesus pray to himself the kind person who asked me this question said was he talking to himself so my reply is no Jesus's body did not pray to itself his body prayed to the holy spirit that created his body and that Holy Spirit was and is his father the heaven father so Jesus prayed to the spirit of God that was in him but also that Spirit was also in heaven because God can be in as many places as he wants to be so Jesus praying to the father was not one person praying to another person that would be polytheism or tritheism the Bible says Jesus was and is a manifestation of God so we must use Bible words manifestation means an appearing so Jesus was an appearing of God according to 1 Timothy 3:16 also Hebrews 1:3 says Jesus is the exact representation of God's character the King James calls it the express image Jesus is the exact character of the father but in a human being because the father cannot change from a spirit and no longer be a spirit and just be a human the father will forever and eternally be in spirit form so Jesus was and is the word made flesh according to John 1:14 Jesus is the image of the invisible God as Colossians 1:15 says who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature so regarding all the questions about the father and the son we must understand and emphasize the humanity of Jesus is different than the deity of Jesus Jesus was fully human his Humanity but also fully God his deity no other being ever has or ever will be just like Jesus in this aspect his dual nature of humanity and deity is completely unique there never was there not is and there never will be another being like Jesus he is a one-of-a-kind manifestation of God remember 1 Timothy 6:16 says God himself cannot be seen nor ever will be seen the Bible said whom no man hath seen so no man has ever seen the invisible spirit of God the invisible father nor can any man ever see the invisible Spirit or the invisible father so men and even angels only see the manifestations of the invisible father and so I went on to tell this person and explain the difference between Jesus's humanity and Jesus's deity God in his Spirit form could never die the deity could never die so God had to create a body to die and that was Jesus and Jesus had the the character of God because he was the word made flesh so Jesus had to pray because he was fully man he had to be fully man so he could suffer Temptation since the father cannot be tempted the Bible says in James 1:13 God cannot be tempted with evil yet in Jesus's Soul he had the full authority of God or the fullness of the godhead as the Bible says the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Jesus bodily think of this all other manifest of God did not need to pray because they were not human manifestations such as the pillar of fire The Rock in the wilderness the spirit descending like a dove and so forth Jesus's human body is the one and only human manifestation of God so he had to pray to draw on the strength of his father the holy spirit this is what brother Ram taught in calling Jesus on the scene in 1963 and then brother Brennon brings out this powerful mindboggling scripture where Jesus said in John 3 13 even the son of man which is in heaven so Jesus is standing on the earth saying the son of man is in heaven so of course he's speaking about the eternal spirit of God the invisible spirit of God that is both inside of his bodily Temple but also in heaven on the throne let's listen to the quote from brother brandham now Jesus being man physically was tired weary now laying there tired virtue had gone from him and then him being God he could only do what now you say how could he be God and be man see there is the mystery see in body he was man in spirit he was God someone asked he said then how who did he pray to in the Gard of Gethsemane I said I'll answer you that why not you answer this do you believe you have the Holy Ghost yes s then who do you pray to where's he at when you're praying to him when you claim you have him and that's you're praying to him people just they just get some little idea and run wild with it you see that's the way it goes now in spirit he was God Jesus said in St John 3 see when the son of man which now is in heaven that's standing here on Earth when the son of man which now is in heaven how would you answer that see he said he was in heaven then and here he was standing on earth oh my you see that he had to be God ominent present sure he's present everywhere he knows every thought by being omin Mission knowing all things he be omin pres see the second question was did Jesus Jesus rais himself up the answer is the spirit of Jesus inside of his body raised up his body but the body of Jesus did not raise itself up since Jesus said his body could do nothing Jesus said this in John 5:30 I can of my own self do nothing so of course there's other scriptures that emphasize this such as John 1428 Jesus said the father is greater than I and in John 14:10 Jesus said the father father does the works so again the spirit of God which is the spirit of Jesus the Eternal invisible spirit of God raised up the human body of Jesus the self-existing Holy Spirit raised up the body of Jesus it created to die for our sins then when you look at John 2: 19 Jesus said destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up so this verse means the father was speaking through the son the father was speaking through the body of Jesus and the father was saying I will raise up this body I've created Jesus's body could not raise itself up because Jesus said he can do nothing of his own self so the Flesh of Jesus did not raise itself up the spirit of Jesus the holy spirit inside of Jesus body raised up the body from the grave this is what brother Adam taught in it is the rising of the sun 196 5 brother R said Jesus was so full of the quickening power that he said I'll raise it up in 3 days brother brandham said why did he say that he knew it was written of him by the word of God and the word of God could not fail so again brother brandham shows how the quickening power raised up the body Jesus said of my own self I can do nothing so his flesh body had no power the quickening power that was in Jesus was the power source that raised up his body let's listen to the quote our lord Jesus is so full of quickening power he was all of it together he was so full of quickening power he said this you destroy this body and I'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence and quick power destroy this body and I'll this Temple and I'll bring it up in three days why why did he say that he knew that it was written of him see it is written in by the word of God which could not fail the words said I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell and he know that quick power would raise him up that there wouldn't be one cell corrupt he said you destroy this Temple I'll bring it back again in three days why it was prophecy the word of God and prophecy if it's true word of God cannot fail and the same prophecy and word of God that said it raise him up said that we're already raised with him don't wor said fear not and it is written that the spirit that is now was in him now in us also quickens our moral B Fe not friends the s o n is up the Sun is up no the third question is pretty simple but it said what is the holy spirit or Holy Ghost my answer was the Holy Spirit is the Eternal Immortal invisible spirit of God and yet this invisible spirit makes himself visible in manifestations like the pillar of fire rock in the wilderness burning bush Spirit descending like a dove voice in a whirlwind and so forth the word spirit is the same thing as the word ghost they're synonyms the two words can be used interchangeably so God is a holy spirit God is the Holy Ghost and we use those phrases inter changeably brother Bram said some people are sadly afraid to use the term Holy Ghost but we're free to use that the King James Bible uses that some people are afraid of the word ghost but we're not afraid of that it just means Spirit we desire every child of God to be filled with the Holy Ghost fourth the question was if God was fully in Jesus how did he speak during his baptism in the form of a dove and also at the Mount of Olives during the Transfiguration great question I said the answer was God's voice could speak at jesus' baptism because God cannot be limited God can dwell in each one of us as the Bible says the spirit of God is in each believer and yet he can still speak from Heaven this is not a hard thing for God to do because he's infinitely powerful there is no limit to God's power we also refer to this as God's omnipresence which means he can be present Everywhere by his for knowledge and he can also be present wherever he wants to be because he has No Limits a simple example of this is the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 God divided himself into 120 licks of fire on the day of Pentecost each little lick of fire was a manifestation of him he could have done way more licks of fire because he cannot be limited he's infinitely powerful and each person that had the lick of fire had the spiritual fire of the Holy Ghost burning in their souls now they were born again and then God was speaking in tongues through each one of those 120 Believers declaring the wonderful works of God the Bible said they were speaking in unknown tongues but all the hearers were Hearing in their own languages think of that the spirit of God speaking through 120 people and peoples from 17 different nations heard those tongues in their own languages so seeing how God could speak through 120 people at the same time helps us to understand how God could speak from heaven and also through Jesus at Jesus baptism nothing is too hard for the Lord the fifth question is about Matthew 24:36 how can the son not know but the father does know and this question also had a few other questions did Jesus mean that generation in Matthew 24:34 and if so what things came to pass my answer was the son could not know the day and hour because the sun was fully human this meant the son had human limit ation Jesus's body had human limitations it could be tempted it could die it didn't know everything but yet it had a holy word nature and never sinned but God the father is eternal Immortal he's an infinite spirit and has no limitations remember Jesus said the father was greater than him in John 14:28 so Jesus's Humanity was fully human it was limited and that's why the father could know things the son did not know the father is unlimited the son's body the human body of Jesus was limited going on to the next part of the question regarding Matthew 24:34 it seems in context according to verses 31-33 that Jesus is referring to the 144,000 Jews that will be spared from the wrath of God during the Great Tribulation and so this event is still in the future that generation that saw the Fig Tree or Israel put forth its buds would not pass away until all the prophecy was fulfilled so I believe that refers to the 144,000 the 144,000 Born Again Jews during the tribulation will be the generation that will see all these things come to pass and six and finally the question says if Jesus didn't know knowledge but the father does know the knowledge doesn't this mean that the father is separate from the son my answer was yes the the son is a separate manifestation from God but not a separate person because if you make separate persons you make tritheism you make three persons and the Jews never taught three persons neither did any New Testament Bible author again First Timothy 3:16 Says that the son is a manifestation of God or an appearing of God remember God himself is invisible and cannot be seen and has never been seen but Jesus is the image of the invisible God we must only used Bible words remember Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 the Bible says add not unto God's words lest he call you a liar and then Revelation 22:18-19 says not to add to the book nor to take away from the book so we will not add three persons to the book we will not add Trinity to the book nor will we take anything out of the book that refers to Jesus and the father such as let us make man in our image in Genesis 1:27 we will not take that out of the book but we will not add two persons or three persons because awful consequences come on those who do one more thing before closing I want to remind the viewers that on pages 37- 40 in my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed it's in chapter 1 I address the godhead this chapter has numerous sections such as let us make man in our image Genesis 1:26 Matthew 20119 1 John 57 Jesus's baptism Jesus's prayers in Gethsemane other three-fold references and is Jesus the Eternal son one important section from pages 37 through 39 is called reducing persons leaves the mystery of plural nouns and in this section I show there's only one remaining mystery about the godhead and that's the usage of first person plural nouns like we us when those plural pronouns are used by Jesus or the father remember friends nouns are persons places or things and so in the case of the Bible when plural pronouns will be used like us or we it's not referring to separate persons it's referring to that Jesus's body was a thing Jesus was a manifestation of the person of God not a separate person and consider Jesus's body was a one-of-a-kind human manifestation completely unlike God's previous manifestations such as MDC a pillar of fire a burning bush a rock in the wilderness a voice in the Whirlwind Jesus was born of a woman Mary unlike mzc who had no father or mother using plural noun shows a difference between Jesus's flesh body and his Immortal invisible spirit that dwelt in him this is the best conclusion I found about the godhead it's so much more scriptural and much safer and reverent and and ultimately pleasing to God compared to the sin of adding to the uninspired words of the Trinity Doctrine it is so irreverent it is so disrespectful to add words like three persons or two persons to God's Bible and it is a awful sin to add any words to the Bible in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing about these six questions regarding the godhead these are good common questions that we have as Believers as brother Ram said in that first quote from calling Jesus on the scene he said see there is the mystery so the mystery is between the father and the son there is no mystery between the Holy Ghost and the father or the Holy Ghost and the son the mystery is between the father and the son so we're grateful God's Prophet came with us sayith the Lord telling us that adding to the Bible three persons was of the devil we're thankful for that warning and we're thankful for the scriptures we continue to understand and the godhead by scripture alone Sola scriptura is the phrase that we want to use in relation to all our beliefs by scripture alone we're going to use the Holy Scripture only because the scripture is our absolute it's the written absolute of the person of the absolute Jesus Christ the absolute is a person and he gave us an absolute record of his plan and purpose for our lives the King James Holy Bible if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
