[29:36] them on my phone and I just listened to
[29:37] them and this is such a great atmosphere
[29:42] lastly we got some pamphlets from voice
[29:46] of God and I guess they have a new app
[29:49] out so it's called the Lifeline app so
[29:51] if you're interested in that you know
[29:53] I'll pass these out
[29:56] I just asked though you know with voice
[29:59] of God I agree on a lot of things but I
[30:01] don't agree on the idea of pastors not
[30:04] preaching and playing tapes so if you
[30:07] see things like that on the app my
[30:09] suggestion just ignore it because
[30:12] brother I've never taught that but
[30:14] anyways I preached a whole sermon on
[30:15] that I may preach it again by God's
[30:17] grace just to kind of give you update on
[30:18] some of the things that have been said
[30:20] and quotes that have been misinterpreted
[30:22] but I'll pass those out too so I've
[30:24] three things that pass out to you over
[30:26] here on the tape

[45:43] me praise God and honey in the rock so
[45:47] we're grateful by God's grace well look
[45:49] at some thoughts here this morning you
[45:52] know as I just read through the book
[45:53] what you know just pray and ask God to
[45:54] bring thoughts to my mind you know for
[45:57] Adam's messages and so forth and look to
[45:59] go see what the Prophet said I believe
[46:01] it's so critical because remember will
[46:03] be judged by Paul's gospel and if our
[46:06] hearts are gonna be turned back to the
[46:08] Apostolic fathers we need to know what
[46:10] the Apostolic fathers wrote praise the
[46:12] Lord that's what the burden on my heart
[46:14] that's why I preached the book of
[46:15] Galatians last year the whole book and
[46:17] now we're in the book of Ephesians we'll
[46:19] pry Disko Galatians Ephesians
[46:20] Philippians Colossians we'll probably
[46:22] just go through there if the Lord
[46:24] tarries it's all about that by God's
[46:27] grace visions for one
[46:29] our text will be verses a 1 to 6 but
[46:31] let's just read the first two verses if
[46:34] you're there say Amen I therefore the
[46:38] prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye
[46:39] walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye
[46:43] are called now let's reverse to together
[46:45] 1 2 3 with all lowliness and meekness
[46:49] with long-suffering forbearing one
[46:52] another in let's just have a word of
[46:55] Prayer if you ever need on your heart
[46:56] just make a known to God as we pray
[46:59] Heavenly Father we love you you are

[47:21] ultimate father and we come to your Lord
[47:23] and we read this scripture this morning

[47:27] worthy of the vocation where we been
[47:31] called to lord help us to live worthy
[47:33] Lord God it's the burden of our our Lord
[47:36] God to keep our lamps trimmed and clear
[47:38] Lord God speak to us through thy word
[47:41] and thank you Lord for the gathering of
[47:43] the Saints we're happy to be in your
[47:44] house that's never forsake or abandon
[47:47] each other Lord God let us never forsake
[47:50] the assembling of ourselves together let
[47:52] us remain united as a body of believers
[47:54] sheep in their Shepherd ultimately
[47:56] Christ the great Shepherd Lord above us
[47:59] shepherding all of our souls or keep us
[48:02] strong and help us to be able to stand
[48:03] and withstand the devil in this hour and
[48:06] father will give you all the praise in
[48:08] Jesus Christ made the church said Amen
[48:11] god bless yous being seated praise God
[48:14] so as you probably see I think somebody
[48:17] gave us some speakers there to help out
[48:19] so I can hear the preaching a little
[48:21] better to help out my voice then sister
[48:24] Connie bought us the lapel so brother
[48:26] bang he sent me a text said well Jesse
[48:27] the church really loves you so I just
[48:29] want to say I love you to praise the
[48:31] Lord and thank you for thinking of me I
[48:33] really appreciate that and that's why I
[48:35] come back you know twice on Sunday every
[48:37] Wednesday because I love you if there's
[48:39] anything I can do to help you out I'd be
[48:41] happy to do that just let me know
[48:42] we're here to help and we're here to
[48:44] serve I know God sent me to a cur and
[48:46] I've no doubt about that in my life I
[48:47] know that God has that's the perfect
[48:49] will of God for me to serve him here in
[48:51] Akron I don't plan on going anywhere in
[48:53] fact I was just crying on my face
[48:54] yesterday saying god I just want to stay
[48:56] in Akron can you help me to be a
[48:58] full-time pastor so I'm looking for God
[49:00] to somehow make me a full-time pastor
[49:02] because I would just love to come here
[49:04] and pray and you know do everything more
[49:07] I just love to get my whole life to the
[49:08] Lord although I'd probably miss some of
[49:10] those children there at Arrowhead I
[49:11] probably missed some of them but I know
[49:14] you know spiritual things are more
[49:16] important than natural things although
[49:17] we're grateful for you know education
[49:19] I'm grateful for the education I
[49:20] received but I would just like to give
[49:22] my whole self to the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:24] and ministry so I'm just I'll just keep
[49:27] waiting on the Lord and ask him to move
[49:30] so and also like I said I'll pass out
[49:32] I've set a timer here so I'll set a
[49:35] timer for an hour and then we'll vote at
[49:40] the end and I'm expecting everybody to
[49:44] vote me back in but if not this be my
[49:45] last sermon here by God's grace I'm
[49:48] expecting to get voted back in this is
[49:52] the voting Sunday and also if you feel
[49:53] that to vote for brother Adam I think
[49:55] he'd be a good Deacon for us Wednesday
[49:57] night we went over the Deacon
[49:58] requirements at the end of service and
[50:01] if he does get voted in I'm going to
[50:02] talk to him and go through with more
[50:03] deacon quotes with the church I'll
[50:04] probably him sit right at the back
[50:05] probably about scottson right now
[50:07] perhaps maybe him to slide down you know
[50:09] in the future but I do want the deacon
[50:11] right there he's the guardian of the
[50:13] Word of God he's the protector of the
[50:16] word of God brother Branham said there's
[50:17] no stricter office than a deacon it is
[50:20] the most strict office to keep reverence
[50:22] in the house of God while the preaching
[50:24] of the word is going on because listen
[50:26] if he if a deacon can protect the
[50:28] atmosphere then you and I can receive
[50:31] supernatural revelation from God during
[50:33] the preaching of the word and God
[50:36] thought so highly of deacons that he had
[50:38] his prophets say that and that's in the
[50:40] scripture as well he has a high calling
[50:42] so I think it's very important and I
[50:45] just want to let you know I'll be voting
[50:48] from other atoms so if you feel that a
[50:50] lord you can vote that way as well
[50:53] and also like I said next Sunday brother
[50:55] Matt Lightner will be here I'll be out
[50:56] in Iowa preaching and then in two
[50:57] Sundays I'll be in North Carolina who
[50:59] will be preaching that time but I'd
[51:01] reached out to brother to see if he
[51:03] would come preach
[51:04] okay Malachi can you switch you over
[51:06] here buddy by God's grace I like to look
[51:09] at part 12 we're looking at these first
[51:11] six verses of Ephesians chapter 4 and
[51:14] Trust to be a blessing to your heart
[51:17] this evening I'm gonna preach on dull
[51:19] hearing I kind of mentioned that two
[51:21] Sundays ago I kind of ended the service
[51:23] with dull hearing I'm gonna preach on
[51:25] dull hearing tonight and of course the
[51:27] opposite is being able to hear the word
[51:28] of God and and that's what we are but I
[51:30] think it'd be good to show the
[51:31] attributes of dull hearing to make sure
[51:34] we're hearing the Word of God the right
[51:35] way every Christian will see that today
[51:38] every Christian should have tension but
[51:40] the RAM said every Christian should have
[51:41] pressure in fact he said when you become
[51:43] a Christian you have more pressure to
[51:45] make sure you're pleasing God your life
[51:47] actually has more pressure when you
[51:48] become a Christian because you want to
[51:50] please the Heavenly Father so we'll look
[51:53] at that this morning and by the grace of
[51:55] Lord I know you'll be blessed so we
[51:57] didn't read all of our text but we just
[51:58] read the first two verses
[51:59] so remember preaching of evens is
[52:02] preaching what Paul preached because the
[52:05] remember brother brand went beyond the
[52:06] curtain of time and they said brother
[52:09] Ram said is every leader have to be
[52:10] judged like that and the voice said yes
[52:12] he said what about Paul he said off to
[52:14] be judged but with his brother BAM said
[52:16] well if his droop goes in so will mine
[52:18] because I haven't preached exactly the
[52:20] same word he said that's it where he
[52:23] baptized in Jesus name I did too he said
[52:26] in the millions screamed out at once
[52:27] were resting on that I remember Paul
[52:30] said that God will judge every man
[52:34] secrets of their hearts by Paul's gospel
[52:37] that's quite a statement God will take
[52:39] the Word of God and the writings of Paul
[52:41] and he'll judge every person's heart by
[52:44] what was written so it's it's an extreme
[52:47] importance that we know what Paul said
[52:50] in the Gospels amen
[52:52] when God shall judge the secrets of men
[52:55] see all those secrets will be made
[52:57] revealed on that day they won't be able
[52:59] to hide any secret so we should confess
[53:01] all of our secrets now make sure they're
[53:03] under the blood of Jesus amen boat
[53:06] you get in some old little missions
[53:07] somewhere you know you might find a
[53:09] whole lot in there some spiritual
[53:10] vitamins God has got them for you to
[53:12] help your spirit up to pep you up a
[53:16] little
[53:16] that's the preaching of the gospel
[53:19] hallelujah if that won't pep up the
[53:21] church there's nothing that will if this
[53:24] preaching this morning can't pep you up
[53:25] nothing will drugs won't work the
[53:28] internet won't work money won't work if
[53:30] the preaching doesn't pep you up
[53:32] nothing will I feel sorry for that
[53:34] condition but there's one alternate
[53:36] repent amen
[53:37] it is the preaching but man said nothing
[53:40] will help you if the preaching doesn't
[53:41] give you spiritual vitamins because
[53:44] faith comes by hearing hearing by the
[53:47] word program said that's what we do he
[53:49] said as no men women brothers sisters
[53:51] why can't we now with one Accord say
[53:53] Jesus I believe you I'm accepting at all
[53:55] how glorious it would be how wonderful
[53:57] listen the Apostolic way of holding a
[53:59] healing meeting is to be preaching
[54:02] seeing what God is doing and then
[54:04] speaking it out where you find faith men
[54:07] and women to believe to have faith in
[54:10] God to believe on God and God will grant
[54:12] them to you
[54:13] this is the way to preach to preach
[54:16] God's Word and while I'm preaching I'm
[54:17] looking for people that will believe the
[54:20] Word of God every BAM says when you find
[54:22] people that believe the preaching he
[54:23] said then you're supposed to speak out
[54:25] the promise of God and believe the
[54:27] promise of God amen say yes I'm healed
[54:30] yes God's gonna humor here yes God is
[54:32] going to say my family or yes God is
[54:35] going to provide for me financially
[54:36] that's what we're looking for today for
[54:38] people to accept the Word of God because
[54:40] faith comes by hearing the preaching
[54:42] amen
[54:43] now remember as we get into this now
[54:45] let's review from two Sundays ago real
[54:47] quick remember the spirits in every
[54:49] church battles I'm sorry that churches
[54:51] mad on spirits in every every Church
[54:53] Galatian Church I just listed the
[54:56] chapters chapter 5 they battle legalism
[54:58] there was people that came in said no
[54:59] you got to be circumcised and Paul said
[55:02] no it doesn't profit you anything
[55:03] so they battled legalism right getting
[55:05] adding it was excessive adherence so
[55:08] adding something on to the Word of God
[55:10] and then they battled discrimination you
[55:12] know Peter was discriminating against
[55:14] the the Gentiles so really those
[55:16] churches can sometimes battle discrim
[55:18] nation they sometimes battle legalism
[55:21] the Corinthian church battle sensual
[55:24] temptations
[55:25] remember the brother was sleeping with
[55:27] his stepmother they battled that and
[55:28] Paul said you haven't mourned so the
[55:30] people got so cold on God that sin
[55:32] didn't grieve them anymore I just pray
[55:35] God always helps in to grieve us we
[55:37] should always be grieve we should always
[55:39] be offended when we hear about sin and
[55:41] say God have mercy bring that person
[55:43] back to Christ amen it should offend us
[55:46] it should hurt us when we hear about sin
[55:47] in people's lives and we should pray for
[55:49] them they battle fanaticism and extreme
[55:52] emotion and and so with the gifts and
[55:55] Paul had to kind of set them in order
[55:56] you know only two or three tongues and
[55:58] interpretations of service and and that
[56:01] they had to overcome that just being
[56:02] over emotional and not lining up to the
[56:05] word amen the Thessalonians battle
[56:08] laziness the history says some of men
[56:09] wouldn't work and Paul said if you won't
[56:11] work you shouldn't even eat because I
[56:13] said all the Lord's coming why should I
[56:14] work why should I get insurance
[56:16] why should I do these things and Paul
[56:18] caught that spirit said that's a lazy
[56:20] spirit amen
[56:21] he said if you won't work you don't
[56:23] deserve to eat if you don't provide for
[56:25] your children you're worse than an
[56:26] infidel and then they battle persecution
[56:29] in Chapter one of that second
[56:31] Thessalonians now the Church of Ephesus
[56:33] I still got question marks there there's
[56:35] not a lot of specific situations that
[56:37] Paul states in the book of Ephesians
[56:40] what's more of like a general letter so
[56:42] you could say witness of doctrine in
[56:44] chapter four which we're in right now
[56:45] and maybe maybe their children maybe
[56:48] weren't their parents because he talks
[56:49] about that in Chapter six he talks about
[56:51] marriage maybe their husbands weren't
[56:53] loving their wives or their wives
[56:54] weren't similar their husbands in
[56:56] Chapter five I just I'm not sure you
[56:59] know it doesn't list out specific
[57:01] battles so anyways you and I well you
[57:04] know in our I for a church a living God
[57:06] we're going to battle these spirits
[57:08] we're gonna battle legalism we may we
[57:10] may battle discrimination we may battle
[57:12] sensual temptations we may battle
[57:15] fanaticism we may battle laziness or
[57:18] persecutions but despite our battles we
[57:21] know we have a conquer we have a mighty
[57:23] Conqueror named Jesus Christ and he
[57:25] sends his Holy Ghost through the
[57:26] preaching of the word that we might
[57:28] receive that word and overcome the
[57:30] battle amen
[57:32] because he wants us to be more
[57:33] conquerors in Christ Jesus amen
[57:36] just because we've added doesn't mean
[57:37] we're lost it just means we're in the
[57:39] war praise God any church a dozen
[57:41] battles not a true church the Prophet
[57:43] said now see we've moved into the third
[57:45] theme now we've moved now into the walk
[57:48] and the warfare of the believer the walk
[57:50] is chapter 4 and 5 chapter 6 is the
[57:53] warfare as he talks about the full armor
[57:56] of God so we're moving in the three
[57:58] themes that that Scofield kind of points
[58:00] out where the believers exalted position
[58:03] hower and the second theme is one body
[58:05] of Christ you in Gentile and now we
[58:08] break into the third theme the walk and
[58:10] the warfare of the believer now let's go
[58:13] back to chapter four verse one if you
[58:15] have your Bibles I therefore the
[58:19] prisoner of the Lord beseech you that
[58:20] you walk worthy of the vocation
[58:22] wherewith ye are called now Scofield met
[58:28] a quoted Scofield he said we must he
[58:30] said walk in accordance with that
[58:32] position so we have a certain position
[58:36] it's called Scofield calls it the
[58:38] exalted position that we've already
[58:40] preached on and read about in Ephesians
[58:42] 1:1
[58:44] all the way to 2:10 let's rehearse some
[58:46] of these because these are glorious
[58:48] these are glorious
[58:50] remember Church that we are the faithful
[58:52] how many faithful to Christ in here you
[58:55] don't flirt with the world you don't Lea
[58:57] no compromise on the word you're
[58:58] faithful to Christ your version of the
[59:00] word Amen he said we are blessed with
[59:05] all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[59:07] places in Christ Jesus you and I have
[59:11] access to every blessing that we know
[59:13] aren't you glad you can come here know a
[59:14] God can meet all of my needs God can
[59:18] bless me with everything I need because
[59:19] I'm in the body of Christ I come to
[59:23] church I come here to hear the word and
[59:25] I have all spiritual blessings amen
[59:27] see that the temptation is all I don't
[59:30] have the natural but we're supposed to
[59:31] forget the natural because that will
[59:33] burn that will gain rust that will gain
[59:36] dust but the spiritual treasures can
[59:38] never pass away man their eternal their
[59:41] memorials amen that God remembers we are
[59:45] chosen in him before the foundation of
[59:48] the world that we should be holy and
[59:50] without blame before him in love we are
[59:55] predestinated but that means
[59:56] predetermined it's already been
[59:58] predetermined unto the adoption of
[1:00:02] children by Jesus Christ it's only been
[1:00:05] predetermined that he's he's bought me
[1:00:07] and brought me he's bought me and then
[1:00:09] brought me into his family praise God
[1:00:11] I'm adopted he brought me out of Satan's
[1:00:14] pawnshop and he brought me into the
[1:00:16] house of God in the courts of God into
[1:00:19] the love of the Lord and Here I am I'm
[1:00:22] adopted like Moses was adopted except a
[1:00:25] better adoption a man better than
[1:00:27] Pharaoh its the heavenly Pharaoh
[1:00:29] it's the heavenly father hallelujah
[1:00:32] adopted in Christ Jesus and now that but
[1:00:36] we are accepted in the beloved
[1:00:38] that means the bosom that means Jesus
[1:00:41] accepts you in his bosom in his heart
[1:00:44] also it also means the heavenly hosts
[1:00:47] there the throne of God he's already
[1:00:48] accepted you there how'd it happen
[1:00:50] because you believed in His Son Jesus
[1:00:52] amen
[1:00:53] see we must walk worthy of all this is
[1:00:57] this a lot of requirements you better
[1:00:59] believe that's a lot that's a lot too
[1:01:01] high calling
[1:01:02] that's an exalted position who are way
[1:01:04] higher as we said than the President
[1:01:07] itíd States were way higher than that
[1:01:08] our position in Christ is much higher
[1:01:11] because they're not guaranteed to be
[1:01:13] accepted above it just by being present
[1:01:15] or being mayor but we are guaranteed
[1:01:17] that heaven accepts us because we've
[1:01:20] accepted heaven amen we accepted heavens
[1:01:23] son Jesus Christ amen
[1:01:25] I don't know if you saw this week but I
[1:01:27] do want to mention that Trump did he
[1:01:29] said he wanted to recognize you know
[1:01:31] Jerusalem as the capital now if he does
[1:01:33] it we'll see because I saw a video where
[1:01:35] George W Bush Obama and who else who is
[1:01:39] the other one he there was three
[1:01:41] previous presidents what it must have
[1:01:44] been Oh Clinton I can't remember back to
[1:01:47] three presidents ago Clinton they all
[1:01:49] promised they'd make Jerusalem the
[1:01:51] capital none of them did it
[1:01:52] so here's Trump is saying he's going to
[1:01:54] do it we'll see but one thing we know
[1:01:55] brother branham said it's thus saith the
[1:01:57] Lord out of the Bible
[1:01:58] Israel is going to read though that
[1:02:00] temple and I think that's a good first
[1:02:03] step to rebuild the temple is making
[1:02:05] Jerusalem the capital that's a good
[1:02:07] verse step by God's grace and I
[1:02:10] subscribe to you know what is it called
[1:02:13] I can't remember now but it's the Jewish
[1:02:16] people the Temple Mount people on
[1:02:17] Facebook and they said the best way to
[1:02:20] start recognizing is res the capital is
[1:02:22] to get Jews on the Temple Mount praying
[1:02:26] so there they are by the western wall
[1:02:28] you know they're praying calling out to
[1:02:29] God they said the only way this is going
[1:02:31] to happen is through prayer I mean oh
[1:02:33] god will hear the prayers of Israel
[1:02:34] equal hell amen hallelujah there are
[1:02:37] always his people he cannot cast away
[1:02:39] his covenant people amen
[1:02:41] I just want to make sure I say that but
[1:02:44] it is thus saith the Lord they are going
[1:02:46] to rebuild that wall I'm sorry that
[1:02:47] whole temple because that's awesome
[1:02:49] Revelation chapter 11 if you know your
[1:02:51] Bible the book of Revelation now we're
[1:02:55] not this is for the spirit-filled now
[1:02:56] these are for people who are filled with
[1:02:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:02:59] these are exalted positions next we have
[1:03:03] redemption through his blood the
[1:03:05] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:03:07] riches of His grace glory and God has
[1:03:11] made known to us the mystery of his will
[1:03:14] we have obtained an inheritance bring
[1:03:18] being predestinated according to his
[1:03:21] purpose aren't you glad you got a
[1:03:22] heavenly inheritance I might have known
[1:03:26] I have no inheritance here my parents
[1:03:27] can leave me nothing other than some
[1:03:29] paper which is alright I'll take the
[1:03:31] paper I'll take whatever they can give
[1:03:32] me I'm not interested in earthly
[1:03:34] inheritance but it's so encouraging to
[1:03:36] know we've got heavenly inheritance he
[1:03:39] said mansions you have mansions and now
[1:03:41] that you have a brand-new body amen
[1:03:43] hallelujah you get to walk with Christ
[1:03:46] and live in the New Jerusalem and never
[1:03:48] leave his side amen
[1:03:50] what greater inheritance can we ask for
[1:03:51] than that amen glory and we have the
[1:03:55] look that we have the spirit of wisdom
[1:03:57] and revelation in the knowledge of him
[1:04:01] that's what we have for our life right
[1:04:03] now wisdom revelation thus saith the
[1:04:06] Lord and I'm still not done we saw more
[1:04:08] benefits we're supposed to walk worthy
[1:04:11] of all these benefits
[1:04:12] we are strengthened with might by his
[1:04:15] spirit in the inner man how many can
[1:04:17] thank the Lord for that for strengthened
[1:04:19] me in the inner man
[1:04:20] we are rooted and grounded in love we
[1:04:24] are planted we live in the love of
[1:04:27] Christ we see and we also see fellowship
[1:04:32] or the intimacy of the mystery of Christ
[1:04:36] which from the beginning of the world
[1:04:38] was hid in God and that intimacy is the
[1:04:40] Holy Ghost in the soul of man amen the
[1:04:43] most intimate place God could ever have
[1:04:45] is in the soul of man a little little
[1:04:47] place where he could come in his spirit
[1:04:49] could come in there and drown the human
[1:04:51] heart in the human soul amen and fill
[1:04:54] that human soul and seal it to the day
[1:04:56] of its Redemption amen and last is my
[1:05:00] last one and lastly we have boldness and
[1:05:02] access with confidence by the faith of
[1:05:06] him can you say praise the Lord we
[1:05:10] should walk worthy of all these
[1:05:11] blessings all these descriptions I've
[1:05:15] told you we should walk worthy of these
[1:05:18] that's what he's saying in chapter 4
[1:05:20] verse 1 he said I beseech you now who
[1:05:24] knows what the word beseech means beg he
[1:05:28] says knowing all this I'm begging the
[1:05:30] church at Ephesus I beg you I encourage
[1:05:33] you I exhort you I comfort you calling
[1:05:36] for you I'm begging you to walk worthy
[1:05:38] or suitably of the vocation where which
[1:05:42] you are called now the word vocation
[1:05:45] we'll get to that and I'll just go to
[1:05:47] right now it means a calling or
[1:05:49] invitation to a feast how many like
[1:05:54] supper something like having a big
[1:05:55] supper I love having suppers big parties
[1:05:58] at every time of Thanksgiving we always
[1:05:59] have a carrion and Thanksgiving so all
[1:06:01] the parents bring in and the last years
[1:06:02] I always always bring the honey ham so
[1:06:07] I'll buy a ham and I'll put in the
[1:06:08] crock-pot my wife showed me how to put
[1:06:09] water in there can you imagine I'll
[1:06:10] learn how to do that water at the bottom
[1:06:12] of the crock pot and smother some brown
[1:06:14] sugar all over it and we have who
[1:06:17] doesn't like a feast I like a feast
[1:06:20] we love our gather with our families but
[1:06:22] that's what the word vocation means walk
[1:06:25] worthy
[1:06:26] of the vocation the feast to which
[1:06:29] you've been called - aren't you glad
[1:06:32] you're called to the feast you could
[1:06:34] have been called to so many other things
[1:06:35] but you're called to the great feasts of
[1:06:38] the marriage of the king's salad amen
[1:06:40] that's what we're called to we must walk
[1:06:43] worthy of this glory
[1:06:47] so that's your Greek definition there
[1:06:49] it's your divine invitation I didn't put
[1:06:51] the court on here but I've said it over
[1:06:53] and over
[1:06:53] brother Bram said the greatest privilege
[1:06:55] of a person in this whole world is to be
[1:06:57] invited to the marriage supper of the
[1:06:59] lamb and I saw a little false doctrine
[1:07:03] rises up one time I saw a man say the
[1:07:05] greatest privilege I ever had was
[1:07:06] meeting brother Branham and I said now
[1:07:08] that's a worship spear right there
[1:07:10] because the greatest privilege is not to
[1:07:12] know brother Branham thank God for a
[1:07:13] prophet the greatest privilege is to be
[1:07:15] invited to the marriage supper of the
[1:07:17] Lamb to escape the tribulation two
[1:07:19] feasts with Jesus to live and reign with
[1:07:21] him for a thousand years amen how could
[1:07:24] brother Branham be just as equal as
[1:07:26] Jesus he's not we respect him as a
[1:07:28] prophet but he's below God God is above
[1:07:31] Christ is above Christ as king of kings
[1:07:33] and Lord of lords Christ is the God
[1:07:35] prophet brother man was a prophet but
[1:07:37] Christ was a God prophet amen
[1:07:39] but you see how spirits slipping like
[1:07:42] that and it takes that it takes that
[1:07:44] uttering that unction of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:46] to pick up on things like that that man
[1:07:48] is not worship but all worship goes to
[1:07:50] Jesus Christ amen right now let me get
[1:07:55] back there now look at verse 2 he said I
[1:07:58] beg you that you'll walk worthy of the
[1:08:01] invitation you've been given verse 2
[1:08:04] with all lowliness now all not so but
[1:08:09] all lowliness and meekness with
[1:08:13] long-suffering forbearing one another in
[1:08:17] love this is quite a scripture the way
[1:08:22] for me to walk worthy is to realize how
[1:08:26] little I am you and I for you and I to
[1:08:31] walk worthy of the marriage supper of
[1:08:33] the Lamb pulse is the only way is to
[1:08:35] realize how low you are
[1:08:39] how little you are huh how small we are
[1:08:43] that's the only way to walk worthy of
[1:08:46] the rapture don't get me wrong faith
[1:08:49] brings bonus we must speak the mystery
[1:08:50] in bonus but Paul said well how we treat
[1:08:53] one another how we treat each other in
[1:08:57] lowliness of mind that will show that
[1:08:59] we're walking worthy of the imitation of
[1:09:02] the rapture look at some of these words
[1:09:06] here I'm gonna go through these words he
[1:09:09] said I beg you walk worthy with all
[1:09:12] lowliness and meekness and
[1:09:13] long-suffering now and I looked at I was
[1:09:16] long suffering as a attribute of charity
[1:09:18] or love and it's a fruit of the Spirit
[1:09:21] for bearing and love so let's look at
[1:09:23] these here now when I saw a vocation I
[1:09:27] just something struck me as I studied
[1:09:28] here yesterday when I when I saw the
[1:09:32] word feast it reminded me of first
[1:09:34] Corinthians chapter five verse seven
[1:09:36] eight
[1:09:36] I said purge out therefore the old
[1:09:38] leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye
[1:09:42] are unleavened
[1:09:44] for even Christ our Passover is
[1:09:46] sacrificed for us let us therefore keep
[1:09:51] the feast not with old leaven neither
[1:09:53] with the leaven of malice and wickedness
[1:09:57] but with the unleavened bread of
[1:09:59] sincerity and truth you cannot keep the
[1:10:03] imitation of the marriage supper and
[1:10:05] have malice in your heart towards people
[1:10:07] anger hatred right you cannot have this
[1:10:10] that that's not keeping the feast that's
[1:10:14] actually rejecting the feast any
[1:10:17] wickedness any sin any any little
[1:10:19] compromising any wickedness keeps you
[1:10:22] out of the feast you're not in the feast
[1:10:24] because that's not keeping it with
[1:10:26] sincerity amen and I love this thought
[1:10:29] here if we're still keeping the Passover
[1:10:31] then it must be token time it was the
[1:10:34] time for the Holy Ghost to fill people's
[1:10:37] souls amen spiritually spiritually Paul
[1:10:40] says were still keeping the Passover
[1:10:43] we're still keeping that spiritual
[1:10:45] Passover of the death angel passing over
[1:10:48] you and I rather have said having the
[1:10:49] token he says it's knowing that every
[1:10:52] things alright amen you've got your
[1:10:55] ticket you're on the plane he says
[1:10:57] you're on the train nobody can take you
[1:10:59] off the tray because you've got the
[1:11:00] token amen you can show to the engineer
[1:11:04] I've got it the tickets been paid Christ
[1:11:07] paid for my ticket on the cross a man
[1:11:09] and I were looking worthy I want worthy
[1:11:12] he's given me the ticket
[1:11:13] he's seen my sincerity and I'm keeping
[1:11:16] the feast in this hour I've got the
[1:11:18] token going now that's probably too loud
[1:11:22] there so forgive me we'll have to get
[1:11:23] that worked out there I don't want to
[1:11:25] get too loud since I got rid of this mic
[1:11:27] now if y'all free now because I don't
[1:11:29] have to hold this mic get all the time I
[1:11:30] go just all the time
[1:11:32] I just feel free I feel like I'm a guest
[1:11:34] preacher somewhere you know but see that
[1:11:37] thought and see what we're doing here
[1:11:39] we're tying scriptures together we're
[1:11:43] tying scriptures together we're tying
[1:11:45] Ephesians 4:1 vocation we just tied it
[1:11:48] with feast because it's the same meaning
[1:11:50] location means feast and next Matthew 14
[1:11:57] we're not going to read all this it's a
[1:11:58] long parable but Jesus give a parable
[1:12:00] brother Branham preached this in the
[1:12:02] message as your life words of the gospel
[1:12:03] 1963 Jesus gives a parable of the
[1:12:07] rapture and he said the King gives our
[1:12:09] invitations and people make three
[1:12:11] excuses for not coming to the rapture
[1:12:13] the first one is a piece of ground so
[1:12:15] property they're worried about earthly
[1:12:17] property they're worried about the earth
[1:12:19] rather than they're worried about
[1:12:20] heavenly treasures the second excuse is
[1:12:23] they're proven 5 yoke of oxen now 5yo
[1:12:25] gets it you can do a lot of farming with
[1:12:27] five yoke of oxen because the yoke
[1:12:29] normally has two right so five ten you
[1:12:31] got ten oxen you're really going to do a
[1:12:33] lot of planting they're worried about
[1:12:34] their seeds and their increase and all
[1:12:36] these things they made excuse well I've
[1:12:38] got all this I've got all this potential
[1:12:40] to make all this money so they're making
[1:12:41] light of the invitation to come to the
[1:12:44] marriage supper amen because of their
[1:12:46] potential to make money Church money
[1:12:49] should never take priority over the Word
[1:12:51] of God hallelujah and the third one was
[1:12:56] I'm married alive well I'm just a newly
[1:12:58] wedded I've got these relationships I
[1:13:00] can't I can't devote my time to go into
[1:13:02] church because of my relationships and
[1:13:04] Jesus said that's one reason
[1:13:06] miss the rapture they put relationships
[1:13:08] above the Word of God amen now the
[1:13:11] master got angry after that and then he
[1:13:14] went out invited the poor maimed halt in
[1:13:16] the blind brother BAM said that was the
[1:13:17] last healing revival of the 40 50 60 s
[1:13:21] Jesus had to send one if you listen that
[1:13:23] is your life were the gospel he says
[1:13:25] that he likens that to his ministry they
[1:13:30] have to have a healing ministry the poor
[1:13:31] of the heart main blind and then he said
[1:13:33] the last call was to go out to the
[1:13:36] highways and hedges and compel anybody
[1:13:38] to come in that's what we're doing right
[1:13:40] now by God's grace amen that's exactly
[1:13:43] right there's another parallel passage
[1:13:46] we're tying these together as chains of
[1:13:49] truth we're tying Ephesians 4:1 with 1st
[1:13:53] Corinthians 5 with Luke 14 now Italia
[1:13:55] with Matthew 22 1 to 14 this is a
[1:13:58] parallel passage of the parable the
[1:14:00] imitation was made light of see the
[1:14:03] going in the rapture is just you know
[1:14:05] we're all gonna make it oh I got time to
[1:14:08] make it in the rapture but I'm gonna put
[1:14:10] I'm gonna put the ground above that I'm
[1:14:12] gonna put the Occident above that I'm
[1:14:13] gonna put my marriage above that I'm
[1:14:16] gonna put all these things above during
[1:14:17] the rapture and they made light of the
[1:14:19] invitation to come to the wedding supper
[1:14:21] of the Lamb isn't that sad they went to
[1:14:24] the farm and merchandise instead of the
[1:14:26] wedding that's what we see a lot today
[1:14:29] the King burned their City which I
[1:14:31] thought might be Titus 80 70 it might be
[1:14:34] because he burned Jerusalem and Israel
[1:14:38] rejected the invitation one last attempt
[1:14:40] was made in the highways and hedges and
[1:14:42] the Bible said both good and bad
[1:14:44] gathered at the wedding the king came in
[1:14:49] and I believe brother and sister with
[1:14:51] all my heart I believe the King coming
[1:14:52] in is the latter rain the Kings going to
[1:14:55] swoop down one more time and he's going
[1:14:57] to come into the camp and he's going to
[1:14:59] take out all those that don't have the
[1:15:00] Holy Ghost and all those who got the
[1:15:02] Holy Ghost are gonna go in the wedding
[1:15:03] supper amen glory he's going to sweep in
[1:15:06] one more time because we're promised a
[1:15:08] restoration were promised a visitation a
[1:15:10] ladder Lane rapturing faith harvest time
[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:15] were promised at
[1:15:19] the man without the wedding garment can
[1:15:20] see that last call was bringing in
[1:15:22] anybody that wants to anyone that wants
[1:15:24] to come and good or bad anybody come to
[1:15:25] the message of the hour come here but
[1:15:27] the thing is make sure you got the
[1:15:29] wedding garment on make sure it's not
[1:15:31] your works of righteousness its Christ
[1:15:33] works of righteousness amen and how you
[1:15:37] do that you get washed in the water of
[1:15:39] the preaching of the word if you don't
[1:15:41] get encouraged today there's no way for
[1:15:42] you to get encouraged today because it's
[1:15:44] through the preaching of the word that
[1:15:45] that's done I was gonna hang on that
[1:15:48] quote for a few services that's a honey
[1:15:50] to my soul amen
[1:15:51] now here are excuses what is it is it B
[1:15:54] is because the people like they did in
[1:15:56] the days of Christ like they have in
[1:15:58] every age they find an excuse they have
[1:16:00] their own creeds you might not want to
[1:16:02] say well I bought a cow or I go to see
[1:16:04] whether she'll work out or not or give
[1:16:05] milk or what the stock is you might not
[1:16:08] have that excuse the program says Jesus
[1:16:11] just listening excuses but here's the
[1:16:14] kind of excuse people may say I'm
[1:16:16] presbyterian we don't believe in that
[1:16:18] now for us it could be people than the
[1:16:20] churches say oh I just don't believe it
[1:16:22] the way the pastor preaches right nobody
[1:16:25] here will say well I'm presbyterian I'm
[1:16:27] Baptists
[1:16:27] but here people will still make excuses
[1:16:29] like it every Church and the church said
[1:16:31] every Church people make excuses we're
[1:16:35] all hearing the invitation but people
[1:16:36] are making excuses Christ is not the
[1:16:38] number one priority see they say well we
[1:16:41] don't have to believe it like the
[1:16:41] preacher does we don't believe no such
[1:16:44] like that well I'm a Lutheran
[1:16:46] well that don't have anything to do with
[1:16:48] it that don't mean you're Christian now
[1:16:50] he talks about the Holy Ghost look at
[1:16:51] the evidence of the Holy Ghost he talks
[1:16:53] about which is John 16:13 when this Holy
[1:16:57] Ghost takes place the thing you'll do
[1:16:59] then you'll find out that the spirit
[1:17:01] that comes in you from the new birth you
[1:17:04] will believe and do everything that God
[1:17:07] says in his word for you to do how do ya
[1:17:11] if you really got the Holy Ghost you'll
[1:17:14] do everything the Bible tells you to do
[1:17:16] I like that
[1:17:18] hallelujah and everything the Bible
[1:17:21] quotes for you to do
[1:17:23] you'll punctuate it with an amen but see
[1:17:25] an amen without doing it it's just lip
[1:17:27] service
[1:17:28] they draw 9 to Christ but their heart is
[1:17:31] far from Christ
[1:17:32] when you can't obey the word of God and
[1:17:34] you look you will not stop day and night
[1:17:38] until you receive the promises of God
[1:17:42] glory he said and all this time you're
[1:17:46] certainly above above everything if you
[1:17:48] really got the Holy Ghost you'll bear
[1:17:50] the fruit of the Spirit now that don't
[1:17:53] stumble people who've been here for the
[1:17:54] last few years I've showed how the fruit
[1:17:56] of the Spirit is part of the evidence of
[1:17:57] the Holy Ghost I've showed that through
[1:17:58] the Bible there's just one quote people
[1:18:01] misunderstand where programs
[1:18:02] he said I'm taking the Pharisee side and
[1:18:04] the Pharisee say well our priests have
[1:18:07] more fruit than Jesus had but then
[1:18:09] brother Graham cranes that layer not
[1:18:11] correct it but he just explains it he
[1:18:13] said Jesus is the only one who had any
[1:18:14] fruit of the Spirit you can't have fruit
[1:18:17] without the right seed the Pharisees
[1:18:20] were not there were seed of the serpent
[1:18:21] they could not have fruit of the Holy
[1:18:22] Spirit because they were not genuine
[1:18:24] seed Jesus was the seed of the woman a
[1:18:27] man he was the seed of God and both both
[1:18:31] they're true
[1:18:31] fruit of the Spirit amen the man said
[1:18:35] will you speak in tongues you might wash
[1:18:37] out you might do that you might not but
[1:18:40] there's one sure thing you will do you
[1:18:42] will bear the fruit of the Spirit lay
[1:18:47] and the fruit of spirit is love joy
[1:18:49] peace faith long-suffering meekness
[1:18:50] gentleness patience your temple would
[1:18:52] not be blow up on people just remember
[1:18:57] when you go that that poisons the Holy
[1:18:59] Spirit away from you see when you get
[1:19:02] the place where you want to fuss with
[1:19:04] everybody you come along too there's
[1:19:06] something wrong when you get to the
[1:19:10] place where a minister will read from
[1:19:11] the Bible that's wrong to do a certain
[1:19:13] thing and you'll just know he didn't say
[1:19:14] it but he meant he means they're gonna
[1:19:16] blow up at the preacher when the
[1:19:18] preacher says you want to do this but
[1:19:21] man just remember there's no
[1:19:23] Christianity there at all
[1:19:24] when you can't submit to a preacher
[1:19:26] preaching God's Word
[1:19:27] there's no Christianity there
[1:19:29] something's wrong with the experience
[1:19:31] let me believe that see that's now see
[1:19:35] by their fruits you shall know them
[1:19:37] that's what Jesus said see now what I've
[1:19:40] just done for you Church by God's grace
[1:19:41] I've just given you honey in the rock
[1:19:43] for the word vocation
[1:19:46] because brother branham said honey in
[1:19:48] the rock is when scripture interprets
[1:19:50] Scripture and the example I gave you a
[1:19:54] two N's days ago was honey in the rock
[1:19:56] about I am the door but we have talked
[1:19:59] about the open door brother branham tie
[1:20:00] john 10:7 with Revelation 3:8 Jesus said
[1:20:04] I'm going to open the door brother man
[1:20:05] he goes oh that's in John chapter 10
[1:20:07] verse 7 I tell you it's honey in the
[1:20:10] rock just them Nuggets out and shine
[1:20:13] them up I hope you feel like you've got
[1:20:14] honey in your spiritual mouth amen
[1:20:16] because that's what happens when you use
[1:20:19] the scripture to interpret the scripture
[1:20:21] it brings you to understanding it tastes
[1:20:24] good
[1:20:24] that's honey in the rock amen glory
[1:20:27] listen to it if you have listened to
[1:20:28] third of your church age which we preach
[1:20:30] eight sir they're nine services on it
[1:20:32] already you need to listen to it but if
[1:20:34] said that's how you tie scriptures
[1:20:36] together when you tied together it
[1:20:37] becomes honey in the rock hey man so
[1:20:42] there's the I believe we just had honey
[1:20:43] in the rock we typed this together with
[1:20:45] that with that and I forgot first
[1:20:46] Corinthians 5 so forgive me I forgot to
[1:20:49] write that one on there so that's honey
[1:20:51] in the rock to me now let's get back
[1:20:53] here to fusions for one
[1:20:56] how many grateful for the word of God in
[1:20:58] this hour I find it to be my strength I
[1:21:01] find it to be my absolute strength the
[1:21:04] joy of the Lord is my strength now
[1:21:10] chapter 4 verse 1 okay yeah oh yeah I
[1:21:15] got a quote here for a vocation I do
[1:21:16] have one quote from oh yeah here here's
[1:21:18] the the one chord I found for vocation
[1:21:20] there's not many here it is this from
[1:21:22] spiritual adoption and now when the
[1:21:25] child was training up so he's talking
[1:21:26] about being adopted by the Holy Spirit
[1:21:28] that didn't mean the child the child is
[1:21:30] certainly a child of the father but if
[1:21:32] it was disobedient child the trainer
[1:21:35] always had trouble with it always it was
[1:21:38] in and out up and down well then this
[1:21:41] message had to be brought to the father
[1:21:42] when the father required how is my child
[1:21:44] progressing then he would have to say
[1:21:48] it's not doing so well well then of
[1:21:49] course that grieves the heart of the
[1:21:51] father and it does today how many know
[1:21:56] the father's heart gets grieved when the
[1:21:59] holy
[1:21:59] freer we'd say in a forum in a symbol
[1:22:02] brings record and say our children or
[1:22:04] our adult children are not obeying the
[1:22:06] Word of God it grieves the heart of God
[1:22:09] that's right because that's Ephesians
[1:22:11] 4:30 you'd grieve not the Holy Spirit
[1:22:13] people grieve the Holy Spirit by
[1:22:14] disobeying the scripture and it does the
[1:22:18] day when the Holy Spirit has to bring
[1:22:19] our record before God let's say our
[1:22:21] ready hour I'll record you have a record
[1:22:25] I have a record we all have a record and
[1:22:27] the Holy Spirit our record before God
[1:22:29] the Father it's not three persons but
[1:22:33] it's just it's a parable like the Holy
[1:22:35] Spirit's a witness here we say my a
[1:22:36] better way to say it might be angels
[1:22:38] because you know the Bible says Angels
[1:22:40] record and angels watch and angels
[1:22:42] minister for God and so forth so perhaps
[1:22:44] we could said angels bring this report
[1:22:46] you know to God the Father just because
[1:22:48] we're not Trinitarian here we want to
[1:22:49] say a million miles away from that
[1:22:51] because that's from hell he said when we
[1:22:57] become children of God we ought to walk
[1:22:59] worthy of the vocation we ought to walk
[1:23:03] worthy of everything that God has laid
[1:23:05] down for us to do for the Holy Spirit
[1:23:08] straining us child training I look at my
[1:23:13] own my trials like many trials you know
[1:23:15] you do too we must look at them as it's
[1:23:18] just training for us it's training to
[1:23:21] get our faith perfected it's training to
[1:23:24] complete us so at the end of our life's
[1:23:26] journey we can be what we've always
[1:23:28] aspired to be amen glory I'm not going
[1:23:32] to live this life on this earth and look
[1:23:34] back and say my I wish I would have been
[1:23:35] on fire like I was when I was 25 what a
[1:23:38] awful testimony that would be same I was
[1:23:41] so in fire when I was 35 or when I was
[1:23:44] 17 or what an awful testimony that is
[1:23:47] we're not supposed to decrease in grace
[1:23:49] we're supposed to grow in grace we're
[1:23:52] supposed to walk worthy he said of
[1:23:54] everything that God has called us to do
[1:23:56] walk worthy of the calling that we have
[1:24:00] of God Almighty we don't want to grieve
[1:24:03] the heart of the father how many parents
[1:24:05] like it when your children grieve you
[1:24:07] you don't like it it all breaks our
[1:24:09] hearts just have our children grieve us
[1:24:12] well
[1:24:12] that should remind us about how we want
[1:24:14] to please the Heavenly Father and when a
[1:24:17] preacher reads the Word of God that's
[1:24:18] the Word of God we must believe that we
[1:24:21] must say amen to that we must believe
[1:24:22] all the Word of God now look at
[1:24:25] lowliness let's now break it on this
[1:24:26] stop how many were all lowliness that's
[1:24:29] gonna be quite a thing oh you are all
[1:24:31] lowliness okay let me show you what
[1:24:33] loneliness is then we'll see if you want
[1:24:36] it I sure hope you do it's having a
[1:24:39] humble opinion of oneself a deep sense
[1:24:42] of your moral littleness modesty
[1:24:48] humility lowliness of mind let me say it
[1:24:49] a little differently if someone has all
[1:24:53] lowliness they're constantly saying this
[1:24:55] in their heart they're saying I have my
[1:25:00] own self don't have good morals I need
[1:25:03] to rely upon the Holy Spirit in my flesh
[1:25:07] brother Adam I'll break many
[1:25:09] Commandments in my flesh I need to make
[1:25:11] sure I walk in the spirit brother Louis
[1:25:15] I'm weak and if I see something on my
[1:25:17] phone if I'm not prayed up I might give
[1:25:19] in to that temptation I need to stay
[1:25:20] prayed up is that right we have a low we
[1:25:28] should have a low estimation of our
[1:25:30] ability now I'm some great Holy Ghost
[1:25:33] message field person I we have to have
[1:25:35] boldness and confidence in those things
[1:25:36] but if we're to live worthy of the
[1:25:40] vocation we have to realize that you and
[1:25:42] I have much trouble keeping the commands
[1:25:45] we must rely upon the Holy Spirit at all
[1:25:47] times amen
[1:25:49] this is lowliness of mind I'm not a very
[1:25:52] good person in fact sin inside my
[1:25:55] members amen if there's anything good
[1:25:57] about me it's got to be Christ amen this
[1:26:01] is lowliness of mind I don't I don't
[1:26:03] have good morals my flesh doesn't have
[1:26:06] any morals then I need to constantly
[1:26:09] lean upon the Lord Jesus amen now who's
[1:26:14] got that that we know or you know we
[1:26:17] want we want to say it we do how many
[1:26:20] can say I'm getting I'm in training to
[1:26:21] have that that's easy to say man I like
[1:26:24] that I'm in training too
[1:26:26] all lowliness of mine I don't have much
[1:26:31] strength by the Amen I really have to
[1:26:32] rely upon the prayers of the Saints and
[1:26:35] I've got a I've got to beat my body and
[1:26:37] bring it under subjection I've got to
[1:26:38] pray and fast I've got a I don't have
[1:26:41] much moral strength I don't have the
[1:26:42] ability I've got to lean upon Christ's
[1:26:44] statement I've got to lean upon Christ I
[1:26:48] don't have the ability I thought that
[1:26:53] one would be a real blessing to you
[1:26:55] lowliness of mind I'm not a very good
[1:26:59] person what you see about brother Jesse
[1:27:01] I'm not a very good person I've got to
[1:27:03] remember I'm very little and I must rely
[1:27:06] upon his power all lowliness all this
[1:27:15] and this is with the body of Christ
[1:27:18] right because this is not breaking into
[1:27:19] the unity of the church the walk of the
[1:27:21] believer the third theme is walking
[1:27:23] warfare this is the walk this is how
[1:27:25] many of us walk in or act together
[1:27:29] meekness is gentleness I must have all
[1:27:32] gentleness towards God's family
[1:27:36] amen no one likes to be treated roughly
[1:27:41] praise God no one likes to be demonized
[1:27:47] undi Christianized no one likes to be
[1:27:50] treated roughly so let's let's be in
[1:27:52] training to be more gentle with one
[1:27:54] another if you want to walk worthy of
[1:27:57] the imitation of the marriage supper
[1:27:58] lamp we've got to learn to be gentle
[1:28:00] with each other the third one with
[1:28:05] long suffering now that's pretty
[1:28:06] familiar this is a fruit of the spirit
[1:28:07] its endurance constants constancy
[1:28:11] steadfastness can we suffer along with
[1:28:15] people can we just be a steadfast source
[1:28:17] of love to people and just suffer suffer
[1:28:21] with them you're suffering with their
[1:28:24] weaknesses you're suffering with their
[1:28:26] mistakes you just stand there and suffer
[1:28:29] with them and just be patient and just
[1:28:30] be a light and just be a friend and just
[1:28:32] be a family member just be a Christian
[1:28:35] to them all long-suffering not some all
[1:28:38] long-suffering not some loneliness all
[1:28:44] loneliness I have very little moral
[1:28:47] ability of my own my flesh would easily
[1:28:50] compromise I'm rough at times I need the
[1:28:54] strength of Christ to be gentle to God's
[1:28:58] people
[1:28:59] and lastly forbearing one another in
[1:29:03] love if we're gonna walk worthy we've
[1:29:06] got the forbear each other that means to
[1:29:09] hold them up what's the best way to hold
[1:29:11] people up in prayer in prayer pray for
[1:29:15] those that you see hurting or struggling
[1:29:17] or it looks like they're breaking the
[1:29:19] word pray for them hold them up before
[1:29:21] God and say God they're in your hands
[1:29:24] and do all you can do to live the life
[1:29:26] in front of them let your light so shine
[1:29:28] that they might see your good works and
[1:29:30] glorify your Father in heaven
[1:29:32] live the life in front of them encourage
[1:29:35] them yeah like you see if see somebody
[1:29:37] struggling try to pick them up right try
[1:29:41] to pick them up do something nice for
[1:29:42] them encourage them do something because
[1:29:44] that's how we forbear one another we
[1:29:47] hold them up before the Heavenly Father
[1:29:50] that's the scripture but rep said the
[1:29:53] Holy Spirit will make every movement
[1:29:55] like Christ remember although eNOS all
[1:29:59] meekness all long-suffering and all for
[1:30:02] bearing you know make you Christ like
[1:30:05] the fruits of the spirit is love joy
[1:30:06] long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:30:07] gentleness patience faith those things
[1:30:09] are what the Holy Spirit controls our
[1:30:11] emotions our emotions is not so much
[1:30:13] jumping up and down you could do that a
[1:30:15] shindig we'll bring that to you
[1:30:18] at the middle school I'm I'm teaching
[1:30:20] Bible club at the middle school and once
[1:30:22] they turn like fifth grade they just
[1:30:25] start getting really self-conscious like
[1:30:26] everybody's watching me from
[1:30:27] kindergarten to fourth grade I can teach
[1:30:29] Bible club and they'll shout and jump
[1:30:31] and say hallelujah
[1:30:32] you know praise God but as soon as I
[1:30:34] walked in the middle school doors like
[1:30:35] this aura of just self-conscious good
[1:30:39] morning
[1:30:40] middle scores like I'm like good morning
[1:30:47] praise the Lord
[1:30:49] does anybody want to pray this morning
[1:30:51] and they're so self-conscious they just
[1:30:54] know nobody wants a prayer I said can we
[1:30:56] sing no but if I put on like they asked
[1:30:59] me to do songs and what the reason I
[1:31:01] thought this because of the shindig
[1:31:02] quote there they asked me one time to
[1:31:05] play a song a Hillsong song which they
[1:31:09] have some good songs they got some
[1:31:11] questionable songs they're sweet people
[1:31:14] I'm sure anyways so they won't move all
[1:31:19] of a sudden I put on a hill so I didn't
[1:31:21] put it on I just listen to it and they
[1:31:23] started singing it I just was previewing
[1:31:25] it on my phone and it's makes me a rock
[1:31:27] and roll song and pretty soon these
[1:31:29] little middle school girls are dancing
[1:31:31] around like that and I like what a
[1:31:32] change I read the Bible every since
[1:31:34] they're like oh trying to not fall
[1:31:37] asleep I turn on a little shindig music
[1:31:39] and they're bop and hopping all over the
[1:31:40] place I thought that's not the Spirit of
[1:31:43] Christ cuz when the Spirit of Christ
[1:31:44] hears the Word of God that soul shouts
[1:31:46] amen oh yeah
[1:31:49] that soul says that's word food that's
[1:31:51] my ego food amen
[1:31:53] I'm feasting on manna from heaven amen
[1:31:55] you see such just one example the the
[1:31:58] worldly beats of rock and roll will get
[1:32:00] anybody excited but when the real thing
[1:32:01] is the Word of God
[1:32:03] the real thing is the preaching of the
[1:32:06] word amen
[1:32:07] then it really shows who's got Christ
[1:32:09] during the preaching of the word amen so
[1:32:14] I'm sorry sure all about shindig I'm
[1:32:15] really realizing in the middle school so
[1:32:17] Lidia is my first teenager so I can just
[1:32:20] try to keep her free in the spirit amen
[1:32:23] and they'll grow I've seen my children
[1:32:25] grow you know at first they were kind of
[1:32:26] raising their hands like this and now
[1:32:27] they raise their hands the higher said
[1:32:28] that's just how I was when I first got
[1:32:30] saved I love Jesus
[1:32:31] I would go to the church service and I
[1:32:34] feel like this and look around and
[1:32:38] pretty soon I'd go like two hands maybe
[1:32:40] look around and pretty soon I start
[1:32:45] serving God preaching and now I'm just
[1:32:47] like all over I'm just you know freed as
[1:32:48] a bird and I got to make sure I just
[1:32:50] don't go overboard I got to make sure I
[1:32:53] let the Holy Spirit keep it in balance
[1:32:55] but before it's just such a but as soon
[1:32:58] as I got the rock and roll song on man
[1:33:00] their head banging all kinds of crazy
[1:33:02] stuff like that because it's all flesh
[1:33:03] we want the inspiration from the soul
[1:33:05] praise God because the soul will control
[1:33:08] the rest of your body amen and it obey
[1:33:11] the word it'll agree with every word
[1:33:12] it's read from the Bible see but the
[1:33:16] Holy Spirit brings you in the operation
[1:33:18] or in control of God that you walk in
[1:33:20] peace and love and enjoy with
[1:33:23] long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:33:25] gentleness patience how many you want to
[1:33:27] walk in peace in love and enjoy if you
[1:33:31] can walk in that you've reached some
[1:33:32] great heights and Laodicea I was talking
[1:33:39] about sister there from Florida and she
[1:33:40] grew up in Brazil and she's like brother
[1:33:44] Jesse you don't me my husband we just
[1:33:46] want to move to Brazil because they
[1:33:47] treat each other like family and
[1:33:48] everybody just spends time together and
[1:33:50] there's not this American spirit over
[1:33:52] here and it's just so awful but I said
[1:33:55] now sister and she said oh it's a
[1:33:56] modern-day Babel and I said exactly
[1:33:58] right and just like in Babylon there's
[1:34:00] some Daniels Shadrach Meshach Abednego
[1:34:03] that still of the Lord that's still our
[1:34:06] family over here in this country amen
[1:34:08] don't get me wrong this is a spiritual
[1:34:10] wasteland brother vain but the way we
[1:34:12] stay alive is being all lowliness of
[1:34:15] mind right all meekness all
[1:34:18] long-suffering holding each other up in
[1:34:20] love before God that's how we become the
[1:34:23] family of God and I you know years ago I
[1:34:30] knew a brother
[1:34:30] that he was so fed up with America he
[1:34:32] moved and I told him I didn't think that
[1:34:35] was the will of God for his life
[1:34:37] he moved to a country and he'd made
[1:34:38] these financial investments and was
[1:34:40] going to do all this things and I'm not
[1:34:42] gonna give too many details but I told
[1:34:43] him I said I don't think that's the will
[1:34:44] of God because you don't have a church
[1:34:46] and they said well oh we can it's gonna
[1:34:48] take two hours ago to church and I
[1:34:49] thought that's not gonna work that's not
[1:34:52] gonna work and I emailed him a couple of
[1:34:54] times over the years and I've heard back
[1:34:56] and I said how is that working out for
[1:34:58] you do you still feel like that was
[1:34:59] God's will and he said yes I said why
[1:35:01] are you still going to church he said no
[1:35:04] and now his wife is wearing pants
[1:35:07] cutting her hair wear makeup all these
[1:35:09] things like that and I told him the
[1:35:12] importance of staying in the presence of
[1:35:14] God see they're running from something
[1:35:17] but we're not realizing they're gonna
[1:35:19] battle spirits over there - it don't
[1:35:22] matter where you go if I'm an overcomer
[1:35:25] in Africa I'll be an overcomer in the
[1:35:27] u.s. I'm an overcomer in Australia or
[1:35:31] Germany
[1:35:32] I'll overcome in the u.s. it doesn't
[1:35:34] matter where God's placed me if God has
[1:35:36] placed me somewhere then I'll be an
[1:35:37] overcomer wherever he is amen because
[1:35:39] he'll be with me amen we don't run away
[1:35:43] from problems we face them head-on we
[1:35:45] face them in prayer we go to God in
[1:35:46] prayer and Jesus will work it out amen
[1:35:49] glory don't run from your problem that
[1:35:52] could have ran for many problems of this
[1:35:54] church but I don't run from them I just
[1:35:56] pray and say God take me through this
[1:35:59] too shall pass this was this will
[1:36:01] perfect me this will bring me to what
[1:36:03] I'm supposed to be amen
[1:36:07] it isn't something that you do it's
[1:36:10] something the Holy Spirit does in you
[1:36:12] you see it's no longer an intellectual
[1:36:15] thought of your own it's subconscious
[1:36:16] moving of the Holy Spirit oh I wish I
[1:36:18] could shout the praise of God around the
[1:36:19] world to that church the Living God
[1:36:22] where there's Pentecost so moved that's
[1:36:24] where our Pentecostal move is failed we
[1:36:26] have some man-made musical clap hands
[1:36:28] jump up and down emotion when if we got
[1:36:31] back out on the street and the Holy
[1:36:33] Spirit doesn't govern our lives to
[1:36:35] cooperate with that then we have not got
[1:36:38] the Holy Spirit okay how much we dance
[1:36:41] or shod I love to do that I love to cry
[1:36:42] I love to raise my hands and pray
[1:36:44] but if I don't live for Christ out on
[1:36:46] the street nothing will happen to me
[1:36:49] it's not skim milk and that's what our
[1:36:53] message will look at tonight as we look
[1:36:55] at the doll of hearing program said this
[1:36:57] is not skim milk preaching but brother
[1:37:00] that's what the church needs only life
[1:37:02] can come by the Holy Spirit
[1:37:03] okay so let's read these scriptures
[1:37:05] through with all the definitions with
[1:37:07] all lowliness a deep sense of your moral
[1:37:09] littleness and meekness with gentleness
[1:37:12] and with long-suffering and dorrance
[1:37:14] enduring with people being steadfast for
[1:37:16] people for bearing or holding up one
[1:37:19] another in love endeavoring or which
[1:37:23] means to give diligence to keeping the
[1:37:26] unity of the Spirit in the bonds which
[1:37:30] means bands or ligaments and I think
[1:37:32] ligaments connect bone to bone am I
[1:37:34] right dr. Scott okay well that's what
[1:37:36] guess what Google taught me that last
[1:37:38] night ligaments connect bone to bone I
[1:37:41] got I got something write that on Google
[1:37:43] that's pretty good so see a piece which
[1:37:47] is harmony safety no rage or no havoc if
[1:37:51] we live with all lowliness remember how
[1:37:54] little we are that we must give all of
[1:37:57] our efforts and this is what I'm talking
[1:37:58] about at a home like our home Church
[1:38:00] here we are giving all of our diligence
[1:38:03] to keep the agreement of the spirit when
[1:38:05] people break the word of God
[1:38:06] they've disagreed with the spirit right
[1:38:09] and so we are endeavoring we're pleading
[1:38:12] we're preaching we're praying that
[1:38:13] people will agree with the Holy Spirit
[1:38:15] and obey what the Spirit says that's
[1:38:19] what we're doing we do this in love
[1:38:21] we're we're we're long-suffering we we
[1:38:23] have gentleness of people and we're
[1:38:26] trying to keep the unity or the
[1:38:27] agreement of the spirit with the
[1:38:30] ligaments of peace holding together
[1:38:33] peace ligaments like peace peace is what
[1:38:36] binds us together and we know that when
[1:38:39] I walk in the room with relevant Oh get
[1:38:40] nervous cuz he and I have peace between
[1:38:42] each other right that's how we should
[1:38:45] feel with everybody we should have peace
[1:38:46] as a bond they should unite the BOK
[1:38:49] brothers and sisters this unites the
[1:38:50] families it's just unites everybody when
[1:38:52] we have peace one with another this is
[1:38:55] the way
[1:38:57] to be prepared for the vocation or the
[1:38:59] invitation of the feast we must set now
[1:39:01] here's what I want to get an attention
[1:39:02] thought I got 10 minutes ok we must have
[1:39:05] a burden or attention to stay united in
[1:39:07] obedience to the spirit and the word we
[1:39:11] must have that burden so that everybody
[1:39:13] agrees with what's being preached
[1:39:15] everybody agrees with the Holy Spirit
[1:39:16] Lord Ram says speaking of tension having
[1:39:19] know this quote I was praying about it
[1:39:20] this morning what would you do if you
[1:39:22] didn't have tension what if you weren't
[1:39:24] had no nervousness at all to you just
[1:39:27] think of it tension is part of living
[1:39:29] that kind of encouraged me when I
[1:39:31] thought of that if you had no tension
[1:39:33] you'd be like a rag doll you wouldn't
[1:39:35] have no feelings who know who wants to
[1:39:36] be a rag doll for Christ just to push
[1:39:39] around no emotion no feeling for God I
[1:39:41] want to feel all that God has for me I
[1:39:43] want to feel his presence on my skin
[1:39:45] brother amen
[1:39:46] I want to feel his presence in my mind
[1:39:48] and I want to feel his presence in my
[1:39:49] soul I want to feel what Jesus feels
[1:39:53] about the word what if you had known
[1:39:58] ervices what if you had no burden or
[1:39:59] tension to keep the Word of God he said
[1:40:03] there'd be nothing you could work on and
[1:40:05] that's the attitude people get today
[1:40:06] they're lukewarm why should I come to
[1:40:07] church I've already believed a message I
[1:40:10] know about baptism I don't know about
[1:40:11] these but how much lowliness of mind do
[1:40:14] they have and the church said how much
[1:40:18] lowliness of mind do they have how much
[1:40:19] gentleness do they have how much
[1:40:22] agreement with the Holy Spirit do they
[1:40:24] have and how much urine tea did they
[1:40:26] have with family in the families in the
[1:40:28] church and individuals in the church I
[1:40:30] know you know the I know we know the
[1:40:32] mysteries but do we have this love
[1:40:34] operating that keeps the unity we should
[1:40:37] give all of our diligence to make sure
[1:40:39] everybody has this agreement of the Holy
[1:40:41] Spirit that all of us are keeping the
[1:40:43] Word of God there's nothing I can work
[1:40:46] on why should I hear the preaching why
[1:40:47] should I play tape at home why should I
[1:40:49] pray why should I read my Bible ready
[1:40:50] know the mysteries said that's the wrong
[1:40:52] attitude that's becoming a rag doll for
[1:40:55] Satan instead of a living soldier for
[1:40:57] Christ he said like a husband and wife
[1:41:01] maybe if she wants to do something and
[1:41:03] they're trying to work together
[1:41:04] especially Christians and the other one
[1:41:05] wants something and then when you come
[1:41:07] together find out what she's done finds
[1:41:09] out see the tension really bring
[1:41:11] you closer together let me know that
[1:41:13] tension a marriage actually makes you
[1:41:15] love each other more and somebody tells
[1:41:20] you well just think of a little wife
[1:41:22] that went under a lot of tension when he
[1:41:23] wasn't note so good or that husband went
[1:41:25] under some great tension when he wasn't
[1:41:26] so good then when it's all forgiven
[1:41:29] that's a key word they're forgiving when
[1:41:32] it's all forgiven look how you feel
[1:41:35] about him or her now Wow see you've just
[1:41:38] got to have tension just think of it a
[1:41:43] feelings what if you didn't have any
[1:41:45] feeling or no pains or nothing what if
[1:41:47] there be no pain at all you'd have no
[1:41:48] feelings at all see and if you have no
[1:41:50] feeling that one of your senses would be
[1:41:52] gone see so everything's just right
[1:41:54] anyhow so God just give us the grace to
[1:41:57] stand up to it what the tension the
[1:42:00] pressure we feel the trials in our lives
[1:42:02] just give us grace to stand up to those
[1:42:06] see that's the thing if I just stand up
[1:42:09] here with that grace and stand there say
[1:42:10] we know that when this life is over the
[1:42:12] great ones on the other side where we're
[1:42:14] looking to go to and now we remember all
[1:42:16] these things that there's attention
[1:42:17] some people tries to introduce
[1:42:19] Christianity that you're free from
[1:42:21] worrying he said no you're not you're
[1:42:26] free from tension oh no you add tension
[1:42:29] when you become a Christian because you
[1:42:32] were kind of a sloppy happy-go-lucky
[1:42:34] whatever it was not caring what you did
[1:42:37] did you know Christian has more tension
[1:42:39] than other people more pressure there's
[1:42:42] more I got it I got more responsibility
[1:42:45] I've got a higher calling than the lots
[1:42:47] I've got an Abraham calling Amen I don't
[1:42:50] have a lot calling to compromise I'm
[1:42:51] gonna be totally separated in the Word
[1:42:54] of God I've got a higher calling Amen
[1:42:58] I'm free from worry no Christian has
[1:43:02] concerns they are burdens they have
[1:43:04] desires now I'm not saying take it to
[1:43:07] the sinful side does everybody
[1:43:08] understand we have to worry but don't
[1:43:11] let it become sinful how you know it's
[1:43:12] become sinful it ruins your faith it
[1:43:15] robs your joy praise God it robs your
[1:43:19] victory we had to be concerned just like
[1:43:22] attention I had to come to church I
[1:43:23] always have attention to
[1:43:24] study that's good I need that what if I
[1:43:27] didn't have a attention to study and
[1:43:29] preach I just be reading off reading
[1:43:31] here reading here right here everybody
[1:43:33] still awake
[1:43:34] alright reading here reading here we're
[1:43:37] dismissed see you later
[1:43:39] there would be no feeling to it we have
[1:43:42] to feel with the Holy Spirit sealing
[1:43:44] this morning amen
[1:43:45] then we're in tune with the Holy Spirit
[1:43:48] we have to feel what he feels about the
[1:43:51] Word of God you can't let it go in this
[1:43:55] you have to have worried you have to
[1:43:56] have tension but you can't let it go
[1:43:57] into sinfulness which is where you start
[1:44:00] doubting the word you start pitying
[1:44:01] yourself
[1:44:02] you pity others you know you're not
[1:44:04] walking my faith we've got to walk by
[1:44:06] faith and not by sight so it's quite a
[1:44:09] balance you add tension but yet it
[1:44:11] doesn't decrease your faith it just
[1:44:13] makes you always wondering am i pleasing
[1:44:15] the Lord Jesus that's what he says next
[1:44:18] now when you become a real Christian
[1:44:22] real how many want to be real I love
[1:44:25] that song that Ashton and crooked as
[1:44:27] wives I want to be real I want to be
[1:44:30] like you I want to be true I can't say
[1:44:32] my children can sing it gerrae you want
[1:44:34] to sing it tonight I'm just kidding
[1:44:36] maybe good singing for some time they
[1:44:38] sang it before here Church and the other
[1:44:39] sanctuary when you become a real
[1:44:42] Christian every moment huh you don't
[1:44:46] take days off and moments off you don't
[1:44:47] take hours off you take a few weeks off
[1:44:51] I'm okay with God I'm sure he loves me
[1:44:54] well yeah he does love you but he once
[1:44:57] wants you to love about how you behave
[1:44:59] he wants he wants you to love what you
[1:45:02] feed on and feed on only the Word of God
[1:45:06] see every moment brother Scott you are
[1:45:10] not wondering am i pleasing my lord
[1:45:12] that's tension that's the right tension
[1:45:15] what am i doing for Jesus this moment it
[1:45:19] puts you
[1:45:20] intention puts you on guard that's what
[1:45:24] makes you what you are like that Hey how
[1:45:27] they do yeah
[1:45:28] your tension your desire to please him
[1:45:30] makes you what you are it's just the way
[1:45:34] you're looking at yeah so after all
[1:45:35] tension is a blessing the pressure you
[1:45:39] feel don't want to please God it's a
[1:45:41] blessing it's just the way you're
[1:45:43] looking at if you look at other side no
[1:45:45] matter how thin you slice anything
[1:45:46] you've still got two sides the intention
[1:45:49] there's the good side then there's the
[1:45:51] other side I'm saying don't let it go to
[1:45:53] the bad side keep it on the good side
[1:45:58] tension oh my what is tension part
[1:46:02] without tension what if I could have had
[1:46:03] this tension I wouldn't have had I
[1:46:05] wouldn't be what I am I wouldn't have
[1:46:08] been a Christian perhaps if this tension
[1:46:10] that drove me to Jesus Christ aren't you
[1:46:12] glad a blessed thing to me what drove me
[1:46:17] to Christ I had attention like why
[1:46:19] aren't you raising your hands like this
[1:46:21] big lineman why aren't you serving Jesus
[1:46:23] Christ I didn't have this tension and I
[1:46:25] had to let off that tension amen I had
[1:46:27] to follow that tension serve Jesus and
[1:46:29] now I just got different tension what
[1:46:31] are you doing now for Jesus are you sir
[1:46:33] are you faithful to be pastoring and
[1:46:35] diecutting and being a treasure and be a
[1:46:37] strong leader are you faithful to those
[1:46:39] things now I've got that tension but I
[1:46:41] accept that tension with a hallelujah
[1:46:43] I'd rather have that tension then are
[1:46:45] you making enough money right or
[1:46:49] whatever you know I'm like you could go
[1:46:51] with there were many different areas I
[1:46:53] rather have that tension the tension of
[1:46:56] am i pleasing my lord
[1:46:58] I'm almost done I got three minutes so
[1:47:02] then as Paul said as though when he had
[1:47:03] tension or something other he consulted
[1:47:05] the Lord so now brother Burman likens
[1:47:07] Paul's trouble with his eyes as tension
[1:47:10] so see any infirmity any struggle or
[1:47:13] trial you have but the RAM said can be a
[1:47:16] cause of tension it depends how you
[1:47:18] handle it he consulted the Lord to take
[1:47:22] it away from him three times and the
[1:47:24] Lord said saw my Paul my grace is
[1:47:27] sufficient and then said then Paul said
[1:47:31] then our glory in my infirmities
[1:47:34] when I'm weak I'm strong see as long as
[1:47:36] it's tension to the will of God all
[1:47:39] right
[1:47:40] see we just have to seek God for his
[1:47:43] answer that's what I told the sister
[1:47:45] from Virginia on the phone last night if
[1:47:46] his answer is my grace is sufficient for
[1:47:49] your tension or your trouble or your
[1:47:52] trial then you and I should be able to
[1:47:54] live with that tension because we know
[1:47:56] God allowed that pressure that tension
[1:48:00] in our lives and it's gonna make us what
[1:48:02] we are nobody in here has had the
[1:48:06] tension of having six kids I know that
[1:48:08] so let me just give you an example and
[1:48:11] seven to be if Lord willing if the Lord
[1:48:13] tarries that's attention my wife has to
[1:48:16] bear most of that burden but I do take
[1:48:18] all my kids to Walmart I do take them
[1:48:20] all to Aldi I know it's like that
[1:48:23] tension in the grocery store that's
[1:48:25] attention and then financially and all
[1:48:28] these things its attention but if I
[1:48:29] prayed for those children and asked God
[1:48:32] to give us fruit to our marriage that I
[1:48:33] know that's the will of God and I just
[1:48:36] have to say God give me grace for this
[1:48:38] tension brother man said you were placed
[1:48:41] on earth to bring forth children that's
[1:48:44] your pleasure your honor to do that's
[1:48:45] one of your duties as a Christian bring
[1:48:47] forth children multiply and replenish
[1:48:49] the earth see as long as this tension is
[1:48:53] the will of God I'll be okay
[1:48:55] I can say Lord you're gonna give me
[1:48:57] grace for this tension I can get through
[1:49:00] this trial because it's your grace
[1:49:02] that's gonna bring me through it now
[1:49:05] look about Bramson he talks about one
[1:49:06] time he had a sickness I forget what
[1:49:08] this was I think it's might have been
[1:49:09] the me buzz or maybe it was that last
[1:49:11] one with the squirrel in 1965 when he
[1:49:13] got delivered from that the throat
[1:49:15] condition I don't know but I'd have to
[1:49:17] look this up I didn't have time looking
[1:49:18] up Loris could probably tell me
[1:49:19] afterwards cuz he likes he likes to
[1:49:21] straight me out I appreciate that and
[1:49:24] now I could solve to Jesus one time when
[1:49:27] it used to bother me so bad it scared me
[1:49:29] and he told me about eight or ten years
[1:49:32] ago so that would have been 53 or 55 he
[1:49:36] said it'll never scare you again and it
[1:49:39] never has had no sir I don't worry about
[1:49:42] it now look I just feel it but I know
[1:49:45] it's there do you understand this church
[1:49:46] brother man had some
[1:49:48] physical infirmity God said it's not
[1:49:50] gonna scare you anymore but it remain in
[1:49:52] this body as ever I understand now
[1:49:57] sometimes people just they just get on a
[1:49:58] they just get on a little bit of flesh
[1:50:00] they say oh you just need to you need to
[1:50:02] cast that devil out using to speak it
[1:50:04] using to speak it use need to speak it
[1:50:05] but if you pray and seek God and what if
[1:50:08] God tells you this is your lot in life
[1:50:10] right now then no matter how much you
[1:50:13] speak that's gonna lay right there just
[1:50:17] like for brother Graham a prophet of God
[1:50:19] God allowed something that used to scare
[1:50:21] him to lay there for eight or ten years
[1:50:24] but God he said God took this scare away
[1:50:28] of it see it was tension
[1:50:31] it was a trial it was a suffering that
[1:50:34] he had to go through and God said I'm
[1:50:37] gonna give you grace to go through it I
[1:50:39] just feel it I know it's there now look
[1:50:42] he doesn't even deny it like Justin I
[1:50:43] you got it Justin I you don't have it
[1:50:45] just tonight he doesn't even say that he
[1:50:47] said I have it I just feel I know it's
[1:50:50] there but I just go on because they
[1:50:52] don't scare me no more
[1:50:54] Dayman so see this is an example of
[1:50:57] having tension there's my hour let's
[1:50:58] stand in sorrow so I'm gonna keep
[1:50:59] preaching forever that's what we're
[1:51:03] talking about sometimes God lets us know
[1:51:05] this trial is for it's for my purpose in
[1:51:09] your life this tension this pressure
[1:51:11] I've let this pressure come upon you
[1:51:14] you've just got to accept my grace for
[1:51:16] it stop complaining about it now I think
[1:51:18] about me want to be a full-time pastor
[1:51:19] maybe that's my baby God let's show that
[1:51:21] to me soon that's just how gonna be my
[1:51:24] lot in life I've got to handle two jobs
[1:51:25] I gotta battle these balance these
[1:51:27] things I would like to just be a
[1:51:29] full-time pastor but you understand he
[1:51:32] said it he could have said now it won't
[1:51:35] be no more just as well as that he said
[1:51:37] but it won't scare you no more God never
[1:51:39] healed him of this whatever this was the
[1:51:41] stomach condition or whether was the
[1:51:43] amoeba I don't know I remember there's a
[1:51:45] quart on that but see God let him have
[1:51:49] the tension but just gave him grace to
[1:51:52] go through the tension now look
[1:51:55] I know it's his will that it happened
[1:51:57] see that he got sick or wherever this
[1:51:59] condition was it was God's will that he
[1:52:01] got sick so I just embrace it and say
[1:52:03] thank you Lord I walk away remember Paul
[1:52:05] got sick what was it to keep him humble
[1:52:07] I said I was to keep him lowliness of
[1:52:10] mind amen
[1:52:12] I think that's that's a good thought for
[1:52:14] today lowliness of mind you and I need
[1:52:19] to have a little a little moral or
[1:52:23] understand the littleness of our
[1:52:24] morality you and I are quick to make
[1:52:28] mistakes aren't we Church in our flesh
[1:52:29] we are quick to get angry we're quick to
[1:52:32] make mistakes we're quick quick to sin
[1:52:33] we have must remember we have a very
[1:52:35] small moral littleness and we must lean
[1:52:39] upon God's grace I had a lot more to
[1:52:42] preacher I'm gonna stop right now I was
[1:52:43] gonna get the one faith one Lord one
[1:52:44] baptism but let's just stop right there
[1:52:47] for the sake of time run Lord if you'll
[1:52:49] come to the piano when you're ready sir
[1:52:51] you can switch over Malachi how many
[1:52:54] love the Lord this morning and
[1:52:55] appreciate the preaching of the word of
[1:52:56] God I'm thankful for the Word of God let
[1:53:00] us endeavor let us be diligent to keep
[1:53:02] the unity of the Holy Spirit here making
[1:53:06] sure everybody agrees with God and if
[1:53:07] you see somebody doesn't lift them up
[1:53:09] hold them up in prayer to God help this
[1:53:12] individual help this family or or help
[1:53:14] help this person help help this child
[1:53:17] hold them up that's our calling with all
[1:53:21] lowliness of mind let's just bow our
[1:53:25] heads here for word of Prayer I'm sure
[1:53:30] something spoke
[1:53:31] heart because I believe it was the Holy
[1:53:32] Spirit preaching today but let's just
[1:53:35] take a few moments and pray here ask God
[1:53:37] to give us these things that we need we
[1:53:40] need a loneliness of heart how many want
[1:53:44] to walk worthy of the vocation how many
[1:53:47] want to be worthy and make no excuses
[1:53:49] for anything I'm not gonna make any
[1:53:50] excuses I'm going to punctuate every
[1:53:53] word I hear preached or read in the
[1:53:55] Bible I'm gonna obey everything I hear
[1:53:59] let's let's have that be our prayer and
[1:54:02] that God were revealed to us is the
[1:54:04] tension we're going through right now is
[1:54:06] this something we've done or is this
[1:54:09] something God has allowed and if so help
[1:54:13] us to see the blessedness of this
[1:54:14] tension Heavenly Father we love you
[1:54:19] today again we thank you for your mercy
[1:54:20] thank you for this word that we've heard
[1:54:22] Lord it is my desire to obey everything

[1:54:29] Spirit of Christ the Spirit of Christ
[1:54:30] drives me to the church every time the
[1:54:32] doors are open as your prophet said it
[1:54:35] drives me to preach the word but also
[1:54:37] hear it myself and Lord let it be
[1:54:41] applied to my life I apply it to my life
[1:54:43] by grace help me to remember help us all
[1:54:47] remember how little morally we are were
[1:54:51] quick to make mistakes let's remember
[1:54:54] we're not great of ourselves help us
[1:54:57] never to exalt flesh because you will
[1:54:59] never exalt flesh help us Lord to
[1:55:05] appreciate the tension that we have in
[1:55:07] our hearts we don't have less tension we
[1:55:10] have more tension we want to please you
