[0:01] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:10] of the lord jesus christ here's the 10
[0:13] best books i've read
[0:15] and why they've been so helpful to me
[0:17] there'll be an honorable mention list
[0:19] after the top 10 and there will be one
[0:21] announcement about my youtube channel
[0:23] at the end of the video as an obvious
[0:26] disclaimer
[0:26] i don't agree with everything in all
[0:28] these books
[0:30] and concerning the bible the church age
[0:32] book and the seven seals book
[0:34] i can't put into words the value of
[0:36] these texts
[0:38] number one the king james version of the
[0:40] holy bible
[0:41] 1611. god's bible is the inerrant
[0:45] infallible unchanging truth forever
[0:48] settled in heaven
[0:49] and for everlasting as heaven and earth
[0:52] shall pass away
[0:53] but god's word will never pass away
[0:55] jesus said my words are spirit and they
[0:57] are life
[0:58] in john 6 63 as i daily read the bible
[1:02] the spiritual revelations jump off the
[1:04] pages
[1:05] just as god's mercies are new every
[1:07] morning he also gives daily revelations
[1:10] called daily bread every morning i
[1:13] preached christ for 16 years
[1:15] and still have only scratched the
[1:16] surface of his unsearchable riches
[1:20] his book is eternal just like him like
[1:23] proverbs 2 verse 4 says
[1:25] the deeper we dig in scripture the more
[1:27] treasures we find
[1:29] some recent treasures have been the five
[1:31] wise virgins
[1:32] from jesus's matthew 25 parable
[1:36] being typed by the five daughters of
[1:38] zelophed
[1:39] in numbers 26 preached by my brother cam
[1:42] who is also a pastor other recent
[1:45] treasures are the dangers of partial
[1:47] fear of the lord
[1:48] in second kings 17 god's promise to
[1:51] prosper us
[1:52] as long as we seek god as taught in
[1:55] second chronicles 26 verse 5
[1:57] and jesus's prophecy about the
[1:59] coronavirus in matthew 24 verse 7.
[2:03] for those curious why i use the king
[2:04] james version only
[2:06] i'm not a bible translation scholar but
[2:09] these things i know for sure
[2:11] first the king james version is god's
[2:14] response
[2:15] when he honored the supernatural prayer
[2:17] of william tyndale
[2:18] while being burned at the stake and he
[2:20] requested god to open the eyes of the
[2:22] king of
[2:23] england in regards to an english
[2:25] translation of the holy scriptures
[2:27] a year later the bible was translated
[2:29] into english authorized by king henry
[2:31] viii
[2:32] henry granted permission and license to
[2:35] john rogers to print the english bible
[2:38] the king later printed twenty thousand
[2:40] english bibles
[2:41] composed of ninety seven percent of
[2:43] tyndale's work
[2:44] called the great bible and sent a copy
[2:47] to every church in england
[2:49] the most accurate bible ever translated
[2:51] the king james version of 1611
[2:53] contains 90 of tyndale's translation
[2:56] work
[2:57] second the king james version is an
[2:58] accurate word for word translation
[3:01] since every word of god is pure tried in
[3:03] the fire seven
[3:04] times other versions are thought for
[3:07] thought
[3:07] which are dangerous and should be
[3:09] avoided
[3:10] third most versions delete words from
[3:13] the king james version
[3:15] in my experience i've seen the niv
[3:17] delete many of the king james words
[3:20] and other versions do the same now
[3:23] according to scripture these versions
[3:24] are cursed
[3:25] because you cannot add or take away one
[3:28] word of god
[3:29] plagues will be added to those who add
[3:30] to the word of god
[3:32] and names will be taken off the book of
[3:34] life for those who take words
[3:36] out of the bible of the few bible
[3:38] versions i've studied
[3:39] like niv esv isv and
[3:42] asb i've seen them delete important
[3:45] words from the king james version
[3:47] and make the text confusing such as
[3:49] calling lucifer the day star in the esv
[3:52] a title given to christ the niv deletes
[3:55] first john 5
[3:56] 7 which is important for the
[3:58] understanding of the one person godhead
[4:00] and also deletes the end of mark 16
[4:02] about jesus's commission to cast out
[4:04] devils heal the sick
[4:06] and so forth so i choose to leave all
[4:08] other versions alone
[4:10] outside of the king james version
[4:11] because they confuse doctrine
[4:13] and delete holy words of god fourth the
[4:16] king james version gives the best
[4:18] understanding some complain about thee
[4:20] and thou
[4:21] but they actually provide greater
[4:23] meaning and help you understand the
[4:25] bible
[4:25] if you research it fifth god vindicates
[4:28] the power of the king james version
[4:30] being his true word charles spurgeon
[4:33] jonathan edwards
[4:34] george whitfield and other revivalists
[4:37] especially our prophet william branham
[4:39] used the king james version
[4:42] my mother was healed of cancer in 1988
[4:44] by quoting the king james version
[4:47] of psalms 118 verse 119.
[4:50] i've quoted the king james version and
[4:52] cast out devils
[4:53] seen the sick healed and more sixth
[4:57] teaching and believing the king james
[4:58] version promotes the incorruptible seed
[5:01] of god
[5:01] the word of god and plants those seeds
[5:04] into people's hearts
[5:05] this is what america was built upon when
[5:08] the united states was founded
[5:10] and preachers were using the king james
[5:11] version bible our nation had no laws
[5:14] that permitted
[5:15] abortion and homosexuality their laws
[5:18] came directly from moses
[5:20] and it produced the greatest
[5:21] civilization the world has ever seen
[5:24] because it was a civilization founded on
[5:26] judeo-christian principles
[5:29] now that this nation has rejected the
[5:31] word of god
[5:32] and interjected all these false versions
[5:34] we see the wicked effects
[5:36] that the corruptable seeds of satan have
[5:38] produced
[5:40] seventh and lastly the king james
[5:42] version has no copyright
[5:44] it's free in public domain obviously
[5:47] many new bible versions are motivated
[5:49] by money making which is another reason
[5:52] to stay away from them
[5:54] the second best book i've ever read is
[5:56] an exposition of the seven
[5:57] church ages by william branham 1965.
[6:02] originally preached in 1960 this
[6:04] exposition was edited and published
[6:06] becoming a treasure trove of doctrinal
[6:09] truce
[6:10] in my humble opinion it's the second
[6:12] greatest book on earth
[6:13] outside the holy bible this book is the
[6:16] very doctrinal foundation of my life
[6:18] and pastoral ministry and i greatly
[6:21] thank the lord for it
[6:22] i give brother branham double honor for
[6:24] his efforts to labor in the word and
[6:26] doctrine
[6:27] as 1st timothy 5 17 says
[6:30] a few highlights of this life-changing
[6:32] book are the teachings on the supreme
[6:34] deity of jesus christ
[6:36] that he's the one person of the godhead
[6:38] the keystone of the bible
[6:40] three qualifications every minister
[6:42] should aspire to
[6:43] the book of life the serpent seed the
[6:46] baptism of the holy ghost
[6:48] jesus's compliment of the last works of
[6:50] the saints being more than the first
[6:52] and the thus saith the lord promise of
[6:54] the former and latter reigns for our day
[6:56] in joel 2 verses 23-26
[7:00] referring to the church ages book
[7:02] brother branham thought so highly of it
[7:04] he believed any sincere heart searching
[7:06] for truth would see it within its pages
[7:09] he said but wait till you get the book
[7:11] you'll understand it
[7:12] if you just got any light in you
[7:22] about your name taken off the lamb's
[7:24] book of life it's puzzled out a minister
[7:26] so wait you get the book
[7:27] you'll understand it if
[7:32] book number three the revelation of the
[7:34] seven seals
[7:35] by william branham originally preached
[7:37] in march of 1963
[7:39] this book is a direct transcription of
[7:42] his sermons
[7:42] with no grammar edits so it can be a bit
[7:45] of a challenge to read at first
[7:47] i advise you to read it while also
[7:49] listening to the audio at the same time
[7:51] it's a faith building powerhouse of
[7:54] truth validated with thus saith the lord
[7:56] to ensure readers the revelations
[7:58] contained therein were directly from god
[8:01] this sermon series from branham is
[8:02] another doctrinal treasure trove
[8:04] especially related to the seven seals
[8:07] and god again validated
[8:08] he was the one who sent the revelations
[8:11] by having branham speak them with thus
[8:12] saith the lord
[8:14] additionally many symbols for the book
[8:16] of revelation are revealed
[8:17] as we now understand god's power through
[8:20] the four beasts at the throne of god
[8:22] four holy ghost powers given to the
[8:24] church to battle
[8:26] in their earthly battle against satan's
[8:28] four horse riders
[8:29] during the time of the seven church ages
[8:31] or times of the gentiles as jesus calls
[8:34] it
[8:34] in luke 21 24. brother branham said
[8:38] his week of studying for these sermons
[8:40] was greater than any previous ministry
[8:42] he had ever done
[8:44] including divine healing of all the
[8:47] times that i've been behind the pulpit
[8:49] at the tabernacle i have never never in
[8:53] any time of my ministry
[8:55] ever worked into the realms of god in
[8:57] the spiritual realms
[8:59] has been this time beyond anything i
[9:02] ever did in any time in my ministry in
[9:05] any meeting and anywhere
[9:07] like this or its own healing this is
[9:09] revealing of truth
[9:11] by the same spirit same spirit
[9:15] indeed through the revelations preached
[9:18] in the seven seals
[9:19] the bible became a new bible the bible
[9:21] now makes sense
[9:22] it has continuity and is living and
[9:25] active right now
[9:26] we can clearly see our position as wise
[9:28] virgins as the bride of jesus christ
[9:31] making ourselves ready to meet our
[9:33] heavenly bridegroom in the air at the
[9:35] rapture
[9:36] in the feast of trumpets 1964 brother
[9:38] branham said
[9:41] immediately after that the angels of the
[9:43] lord appeared and told about the seven
[9:45] uh trumpets or the seven seals and i was
[9:49] to return back here to jeffersonville
[9:50] and preach the seven seals
[9:53] and there if i've ever said anything
[9:55] that was inspired
[9:56] it was in that there or the angel lord
[9:59] medicine up the bible become a new bible
[10:02] there it opened up and revealed all the
[10:06] things that the reformers and things
[10:07] that left out
[10:09] it was a complete revelation of jesus
[10:12] christ
[10:12] all together new to us but perfectly
[10:15] exactly
[10:17] with the scripture that was the word
[10:19] which has always been
[10:21] i was so inspired and directed
[10:25] book number four today matters by john
[10:28] maxwell
[10:29] 2005 a former minister
[10:32] john maxwell's book came to me at a time
[10:34] when i desperately needed it
[10:36] i was a young husband father and
[10:38] preacher my good friend
[10:40] john graham shared this book with me and
[10:42] it's done wonders for my perspective
[10:44] and daily habits humans become
[10:48] what we do every day our daily choices
[10:51] will either compound into blessings
[10:53] or curses maxwell says life has 12 areas
[10:56] we must daily strengthen
[10:58] and improve they include attitude
[11:01] priorities
[11:02] health family thinking commitments
[11:05] finances faith relationships generosity
[11:08] values and growth maxwell gives examples
[11:11] from his own life
[11:12] and others who daily invested in these
[11:15] areas of their lives and saw
[11:16] massive compound effects for example
[11:20] maxwell describes the compound effects
[11:22] of his faith in christ
[11:23] from his 20s 30s 40s 50s and 60s
[11:27] the same applies to our health as taking
[11:30] care of our body daily for decades
[11:32] often yields great blessings one of the
[11:34] most impactful statements from this book
[11:37] is maxwell showing what the descendants
[11:39] of one preacher and his wife
[11:41] accomplished that preacher was jonathan
[11:43] edwards
[11:44] and his wife named sarah this example
[11:47] shows the blessing of daily investing in
[11:49] your family
[11:50] one thousand four hundred descendants of
[11:52] jonathan and sarah were studied
[11:54] and they included 13 college presidents
[11:57] 65 professors
[11:59] 100 lawyers 30 judges
[12:02] 66 doctors and over 80 holders of public
[12:06] office
[12:08] of course the greatest achievement our
[12:09] descendants can achieve is being a holy
[12:11] ghost-filled christian
[12:12] but we can gain a lot of wisdom from
[12:14] maxwell's words when he says
[12:16] while you can't do much about your
[12:17] ancestors you can influence your
[12:19] descendants greatly
[12:21] yes today matters jesus said to seek
[12:23] first the kingdom of god and everything
[12:25] else would be added to you
[12:26] and god promised his blessing would be
[12:28] upon a thousand generations
[12:30] according to deuteronomy 7 verse 9
[12:33] psalms 112 verses 1 and 2
[12:36] says blessed is the man who feareth the
[12:38] lord that delighteth greatly in his
[12:40] commandments
[12:41] his seed shall be mighty upon the earth
[12:43] the generation of the upright
[12:45] shall be blessed book number five
[12:48] his needs her needs building an
[12:50] affair-proof marriage
[12:52] by dr willard harley 1986
[12:56] this is undoubtedly the most impactful
[12:58] book upon my marriage
[12:59] i've ever read i believe most if not all
[13:02] marriages
[13:03] would benefit from the truths in this
[13:04] book
[13:06] harley lists five needs for both men and
[13:08] women
[13:09] and if those needs are met the marriage
[13:11] thrives one powerful quote
[13:13] i'll paraphrase is this your spouse
[13:16] married you because
[13:17] they wanted your loving treatment you
[13:19] express to them during the courtship
[13:21] and engagement period to last the rest
[13:24] of their lives
[13:25] in other words married couples must keep
[13:27] that first love alive
[13:29] other pastors have asked me to preach
[13:31] marriage banquets
[13:32] to their congregations on about six
[13:35] occasions
[13:36] and harley's principles are always in my
[13:38] teachings
[13:39] because they're backed up by the holy
[13:40] truths of the bible as well as
[13:42] quotations from brother branham
[13:44] i've often used these principles in
[13:46] marriage counseling as well
[13:48] book number six be fruitful and multiply
[13:51] by nancy campbell
[13:53] 2003 first i'll say anyone stumbling
[13:56] over me reading a book by a woman
[13:58] and trying to glean truce out of it is
[14:00] likely unaware
[14:01] that brother branham god's prophet used
[14:04] a woman's book called how did it happen
[14:06] by rachel c haseltine to obtain a lot of
[14:10] the church history
[14:11] he used when he preached the seven
[14:13] church age series
[14:14] in december 1960 this be fruitful
[14:18] multiply book
[14:19] provides complete bible validation for
[14:21] having large families based upon god's
[14:23] commission
[14:24] to be fruitful and multiply these bible
[14:26] truths are why my wife and i have eight
[14:28] children
[14:29] because we believe god's word is true
[14:31] our family has been laughed at
[14:33] made fun of scoffed at but that is just
[14:36] one reproach for being a true christian
[14:38] let me add a word of wisdom that a
[14:40] wife's health should be the number one
[14:42] factor
[14:43] when deciding to expand upon your family
[14:46] one of the many highlights from this
[14:47] book include
[14:48] that god sent his own son jesus into a
[14:51] family
[14:52] that would have had at least seven
[14:53] children according to mark
[14:55] six verse three jesus the firstborn
[14:58] james joseph judah simon
[15:01] and sisters that's at least two sisters
[15:04] the point is if god was able to take
[15:07] care of jesus
[15:08] his only begotten son virgin born in a
[15:11] family of at least
[15:12] nine in a time when they were not rich
[15:15] and increased with goods and weren't
[15:16] living in the laodicean benefits we have
[15:18] today
[15:19] god can just as easily take care of any
[15:22] size family
[15:24] all that's required is faith in god's
[15:26] promises
[15:27] furthermore i must address one of
[15:29] satan's lies he uses to get christians
[15:31] to say the following
[15:32] i won't have children because i don't
[15:34] want them to live in this wicked world
[15:36] satan's lie is that your potential
[15:38] children cannot overcome the sinful
[15:40] world
[15:41] this statement is motivated by fear and
[15:43] not faith
[15:44] what are you scared of satan
[15:47] christians cast down the spirit of fear
[15:50] and are empowered
[15:51] by the spirit of power love and a sound
[15:54] mind
[15:54] christians living in fear are certainly
[15:57] not born again
[15:58] for the fearful will not inherit the
[15:59] kingdom of god and those that worship
[16:01] the spirit of fear
[16:02] will burn in the lake of fire according
[16:04] to revelation 21 verse 8.
[16:07] this excuse diminishes god and exalts
[16:10] satan
[16:11] in their evil reasoning they are saying
[16:13] satan is more powerful than god
[16:15] they are also saying god is not able to
[16:17] protect their children nor help them
[16:19] but our bible says christians are more
[16:21] than conquerors through christ jesus
[16:23] greater is he that is in me than he that
[16:25] is in the world no weapon formed against
[16:28] christians
[16:28] shall prosper why couldn't your
[16:30] potential children overcome this wicked
[16:32] world
[16:33] is it because you cannot overcome it
[16:35] john says only one thing is required to
[16:37] overcome this world
[16:39] faith and it's a freely given gift of
[16:41] god according to ephesians 2 verses 8
[16:43] through 10.
[16:44] first john 5 verses 4 and 5 say for
[16:47] whatsoever is born of god
[16:49] overcometh the world and this is the
[16:51] victory that overcometh the world
[16:53] even our faith who is he that overcometh
[16:55] the world
[16:56] but he that believeth that jesus is the
[16:58] son of god
[16:59] the reality is that parents should be so
[17:01] strong in the faith
[17:03] that their godly child training should
[17:04] prepare their child or children
[17:06] to overcome the world as proverbs 22
[17:09] verse 6
[17:10] teaches us to train up a child in the
[17:12] way he should go
[17:13] the truth is this age is selfish and
[17:16] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[17:18] god
[17:19] most couples don't want to be burdened
[17:21] with caring for children
[17:22] they'd rather do their own thing and if
[17:24] they are using birth control pills
[17:26] then they are likely murderers as well
[17:29] because the pill often stops a
[17:30] fertilized egg
[17:32] a new life from attaching to the uterine
[17:35] wall
[17:35] if over 50 million babies have been
[17:37] aborted in clinics
[17:39] how many have been aborted by the birth
[17:41] control pill
[17:43] book number seven the feasts of israel
[17:45] by kevin j
[17:46] connor 1995. as a young minister this
[17:50] book was gifted to me
[17:51] and has been a great teacher about the
[17:53] natural and prophetic
[17:54] principles of the feasts and holy days
[17:56] of israel which include
[17:58] passover unleavened bread first fruits
[18:01] weeks trumpets atonement and tabernacles
[18:05] a couple of highlights are number one
[18:07] leaven is a type of sin throughout the
[18:09] entire bible
[18:10] this truth helps us to understand
[18:12] jesus's sinful life
[18:14] as he was the unleavened bread and it
[18:16] shows the dangers of false doctrine
[18:18] in past and current churches like the
[18:20] leaven of the pharisees and sadducees
[18:23] and this teaching helps us interpret
[18:24] jesus's parable of 11 hidden three
[18:27] measures of meal
[18:28] in matthew 13 33. the man-made
[18:31] false teaching of the three-person god
[18:34] the false trinity dogma
[18:36] was the leaven hid in the early church's
[18:38] doctrine
[18:39] which has completely permeated into
[18:41] their entire belief system
[18:42] polluting both catholic and protestant
[18:44] belief systems
[18:46] a second highlight is understanding
[18:48] god's prophetic calendar
[18:50] passover unleavened bread and first
[18:51] fruits were all prophetically fulfilled
[18:54] when jesus was crucified and raised from
[18:56] the dead two thousand years ago
[18:58] we are now prophetically living in the
[19:00] feast of weeks the long season of wheat
[19:02] harvest
[19:03] before god returns to the jews through
[19:05] the holy day of trumpets
[19:08] it's likely the two prophets moses and
[19:10] elijah will fulfill the trumpets
[19:12] and jesus revealing himself to the 144
[19:14] thousand
[19:15] jewish remnant will fulfill the holy day
[19:17] of atonement
[19:19] the feast of tabernacles is fulfilled in
[19:21] the 1000 year
[19:22] millennial reign book number eight
[19:25] message companion
[19:26] by marcus becker 2013.
[19:30] gifted to me in 2013 this book was a
[19:33] quick read for me because i couldn't put
[19:34] it down
[19:35] i read it in two days this is an
[19:38] essential read for anyone interested
[19:40] in the supernatural ministry of god's
[19:41] prophet william branham
[19:43] becker's work is a great source for
[19:46] important quotes from brother branham
[19:47] in order to see the changing of his
[19:49] ministry from 1959 to 1965.
[19:53] it includes pictures news articles and
[19:55] other publications
[19:56] that are chronologically ordered with
[19:58] brother branham's sermons
[20:00] helping the reader understand the
[20:01] significance of both world events and
[20:04] events in brother branham's life for me
[20:07] a few highlights we're seeing the
[20:08] progression of brother branham obeying
[20:10] the holy spirit
[20:11] in his commission as it changed in the
[20:13] first second and third polls
[20:15] also seeing the timing of his commission
[20:18] to store up food
[20:19] or tape recordings was very helpful
[20:21] lastly
[20:22] you see the beautiful revelation of god
[20:24] showing brother branham his ministry
[20:26] as god's eliezer commissioned to get a
[20:28] bride for isaac
[20:29] or jesus christ book number nine
[20:32] family shepherds by votey bockham jr
[20:35] 2011.
[20:37] votey's book calls and equips men to
[20:39] lead their homes
[20:40] so i encourage fathers to read this book
[20:43] this book came to me as
[20:44] a young father and strengthened my
[20:46] biblical foundation on the
[20:48] how and why of being a godly father of
[20:51] course i known brother bam's message for
[20:52] about 10 years
[20:54] and that gave me a great foundation to
[20:56] be a godly man but this book puts vast
[20:58] amounts of biblical truth in one
[21:00] location votey is baptist by
[21:02] denomination
[21:03] so i don't agree with everything in the
[21:05] book but the biblical teaching for men
[21:07] far outweighs my disagreements with his
[21:09] denomination
[21:11] one of the greatest scriptures that
[21:12] impacted me in the book was first samuel
[21:14] 3
[21:15] 13 which shows eli's failure to restrain
[21:18] his two sons
[21:19] and the punishment god put upon eli for
[21:22] this act
[21:23] this truth showed me a true loving
[21:25] father must restrain his child or
[21:28] children
[21:28] when they repeatedly disobey god's word
[21:31] additionally
[21:32] this book shows the husband's role in
[21:34] teaching his children
[21:35] using apologetics leading and loving his
[21:38] wife
[21:38] and the absolute necessity of having
[21:40] your family in a home church
[21:42] serving christ with other believers and
[21:44] their families
[21:46] book number 10 free to focus by michael
[21:48] hyatt
[21:49] 2019 a disclaimer
[21:52] this is the only book on the list that i
[21:54] didn't read
[21:55] as i listened to the audiobook i've
[21:58] benefited
[21:59] from michael hyatt's productivity
[22:00] teachings for about three years
[22:02] since i used his free book writing
[22:04] course to help me write my first book
[22:06] restoring christian modesty free to
[22:09] focus
[22:10] has helped me as i'm writing my second
[22:11] book about the new testament's
[22:13] 12 reveal mysteries this is because free
[22:16] to focus
[22:17] has helped me prioritize my life it
[22:20] teaches three steps
[22:22] to completely focus on my calling in
[22:24] life
[22:25] stop cut and act this book gets down
[22:29] into the details
[22:30] of what a daily schedule looks like when
[22:32] it's completely focused on a goal
[22:34] i'd say today matters is a broad yet
[22:37] essential perspective on becoming
[22:39] focused and productive
[22:40] while free to focus helps you daily live
[22:43] focused and stay productive
[22:45] hyatt truly teaches how you and i can
[22:47] accomplish more by doing less
[22:50] the secret is accomplishing more of what
[22:52] truly matters
[22:53] by saying no to things that are not as
[22:55] important
[22:57] honorable mention
[23:00] here's five books that have greatly
[23:02] affected me the first is the five love
[23:04] languages by gary chapman
[23:07] this book was given to me when i first
[23:08] became a christian before i knew the
[23:10] message of william branham
[23:11] and he showed me that people receive
[23:13] love in different ways
[23:14] so if i'm going to love people with
[23:16] christ's love i must learn how to
[23:18] express
[23:19] love to them in a way that they can
[23:20] receive it
[23:22] second is dress for the occasion now
[23:24] this is a young adult book
[23:27] but it was introduced to me in college
[23:29] and it contained so much history about
[23:31] dressing modestly
[23:33] that it helped inspire me to write my
[23:35] first book restoring christian modesty
[23:37] if you want to see how americans once
[23:38] had the truth about modesty but then
[23:40] fell from it decade by decade
[23:42] this is the book to get the third book
[23:44] is which version is the bible
[23:47] a disclaimer here i have not read this
[23:48] whole book but the parts that i have
[23:50] read
[23:51] have convinced me that the king james
[23:53] version is the most accurate
[23:54] and trustworthy bible translation known
[23:57] to mankind
[23:58] a fourth book is shaping history by
[24:00] prayer and fasting
[24:02] by derek prince this book shows how god
[24:04] has always led men to pray and fast
[24:07] for the future of their nations
[24:08] especially israel the author includes
[24:11] testimonies from his own
[24:12] prayer and fasting ministries around the
[24:14] time of world war
[24:15] ii it encourages christians today to
[24:18] pray and fast for our nations
[24:20] that we could continue the great
[24:21] commission and lead quiet and peaceable
[24:23] lives
[24:24] as saint paul teaches the fifth
[24:26] honorable mention book is the
[24:27] purpose-driven life
[24:29] by rick warren of course i don't agree
[24:31] with rick warren
[24:32] in the areas of the pope and of the
[24:34] trinity
[24:35] but this book shows beautiful scriptures
[24:38] about god's purpose for
[24:39] every believer's life again i read this
[24:41] book very quickly
[24:43] and it culminates by showing every
[24:44] christian should have a home church
[24:46] find their gifts invest in them that
[24:48] they might fulfill god's purpose for
[24:50] their life
[24:50] your purpose is found in god not in
[24:53] yourself
[24:54] finally here's an announcement
[24:58] due to the recent censorship of
[25:00] conservative free speech
[25:02] during the 2020 presidential election in
[25:05] the united states
[25:06] by facebook google twitter youtube and
[25:08] amazon
[25:09] one goal i have for 2021 is to move away
[25:12] from the youtube platform
[25:14] and eventually build my own or use
[25:16] another service
[25:18] such as rumble i haven't made a final
[25:20] decision yet
[25:21] but i'll let my audience know later this
[25:23] year lord willing
[25:25] i've already deleted my twitter
[25:27] instagram and facebook accounts
[25:29] and i've even stopped purchasing things
[25:31] from amazon
[25:33] my goal is to have my own platform on my
[25:35] new web page
[25:38] www.pastorjessiesmith.com
[25:39] the site is live and slowly growing so
[25:42] please be aware of my desire
[25:44] to eventually leave youtube if you'd
[25:47] like to receive more bible teaching that
[25:48] strengthens you
[25:50] your church your family and your pastor
[25:53] just like
[25:53] brother branham loved brother neville's
[25:55] weekly radio ministry
[25:56] that reached an untold number of
[25:58] families outside of his home church
[26:00] i would hope brother branham would love
[26:02] my youtube ministry as it seeks to point
[26:04] people to jesus's bible-based message
[26:07] equipping and strengthening the saints
[26:11] it is one of the best fields
[26:15] in the nation
[26:22] and how many heard the broadcast
[26:24] yesterday

[26:28] years old

[26:36] uh appropriate sermon for
