========================================
[Music] there he is with them angels of message which was the seven breaking of them Seven Seals that reveal serpent seed and all these things here the breaking of them Seven Seals that reveal serpent seed the breaking of them Seven Seals that reveal serpent seed greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share a revelation the Lord Jesus I believe revealed to me personally on this topic of the serpent seed and the Seven Seals so for years I've wondered why brother brandom said the breaking of them Seven Seals that revealed the serpent seed and all these things here and just a few weeks ago I felt the Lord Jesus gave me the Revelation but first friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and we're celebrating our 18th anniversary this weekend actually by God's grace and also by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ CHR I defend the true Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that the Lord Jesus revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through the prophet William Marian brandham 1909 to 1965 also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so here's a brief outline for the video first we'll begin with the origin of this video which includes a quote from brother brandham from ashamed 1965 then secondly we'll look at how serpent seed is a part of the Seven Seals actually found in Revelation 5 then third and finally we'll look at other doctrines and revelations in the Seven Seals that help tie the entire Bible together by the grace of the Lord so first let's look at the origin here years ago perhaps maybe 10 years or more I was listening to ashamed it's July 11 1965 sermon from Brother Brenham and he said this he said the message which was the seven breaking of them Seven Seals that revealed serpent seed and all these things here so that always puzzled me for all these years and I kind of set this quote up on the Shelf because I always thought why did Brother ROM say serpent seed was revealed in the Seven Seals and in my heart mind I'd studied the Seven Seals basically Revelation chap 6 and then the beginning of Revelation 8 and I never saw anything about the serpent seed in there so let's listen to the quote by God's grace there he is with them angels of message which was the seven breaking of them Seven Seals that reveals serpent seed and all these things here and it shows that it is his very covering his it's his supreme authority am he is supreme and he's wigged or or covered the Bible said that he changed his countenance or he changed himself immor so this statement was on the Shelf in my mind for many years how the serpent SE was revealed in the Seven Seals and then I've been doing this preaching series recently on this message song I Just Want to Thank You Lord for letting me hear your word and as some of you know the first verse says then I heard recognizing your day serpent seed perfect Faith the breach and the message of Grace Lord I Thank thee so I finished preaching through recognizing your day serpent seed perfect faith and I was listening to the breach and it was through listening that sermon that the Revelation came by God's grace so now let's go to the second part let's look at serpent seed in the Seven Seals and here is what I believe is the revelation of how the serpent seed is is in the Seven Seals I believe serpent seed is clearly understood if you read between the lines of Revelation 5 as brother Bram said sometimes as Christians we have to read between the lines for Revelation and so I'd always thought brother Brandon meant the serpent seed was in Revelation 6 or the first two verses of Revelation chap 8 and of course Revelation chap 6 lists the first six seals but then while listening to the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals I heard brother say that anyone that couldn't see it was adultery there is totally blind because every man that was born was born of a woman and of course brother BR was referring to Revelation 5: 4 and 5 no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the ly of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof so here was the revelation why was Jesus worthy to look at the book and then loose the seals of the book because he never sinned and he was the only virgin born man so this is what we mean by read between the lines if you read Revelation 54 and 5 no man is worthy that's because all men were either born in sin shape in iniquity come to the world speaking lies as Psalm and job says or Adam and Eve weren't born of women but they were the original ones who sinned and broke the word of God so Adam and Eve could not be worthy to take the book either it had to be the Virgin born son of God none other than our Lord Jesus Christ so let's just in this brief quote there's about three paragraphs here from the breach let's listen to the quote now how could we be when every man that's born has to and anybody couldn't see it was a sex act there he's totally blind cuz every man that was born was born of a woman and God required a kinsman redeemer and he must be a human oh my what he going to do now law required a kinsman redeemer I couldn't take an angel you had to have a man CU we're not kin to the angel we're kin to one another the angel never fail he's a different kind of being got a different body he never sinned or nothing he's a different but the law required a kinsman redeemer and every man on Earth was born of a sex I don't you see that's where it come from that's where sin started amen so you see where it's at now there comes your seat of the serpent in so as soon as I heard this quote I was meditating on this and then the Revelation came that's where serpent seed is in the Seven Seals it's in the chapter before the Seven Seals Revelation CH 5 and it just made me so joyful I just rejoiced and I thought my all these years I've waited to understand this and I finally understand that this took place about two weeks ago on the drive to church on a Sunday morning with my eight children in the back of the van and I'm holding my wife's hand as we're driving along and there the Revelation strikes me and of course this ties in with the rest of the Bible the Bible says in Proverbs 30:20 an adulterous woman edth wipeth her mouth and saith I've done no wickedness so here we see the symbolism of an adulterous woman eating and wiping her mouth and that's of course what the Book of Genesis tells us the symbolism of Eve eating a fruit but it was actually adultery because all the consequences were in her reproduction so because she received the wrong seed the seed of the serpent God had to give her consequences when she brought forth seed as a reminder of what Eve did at the beginning and also second second Peter 1:4 the Bible said having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so we can see corruption start in the Gard of Eden came by lust but Redemption came by virginity Mary was of course a virgin conceived Jesus of the Holy Ghost of course so Redemption came by the seed of the woman corruption came by the seed of the serpent notice friends it took a virgin born man to break the Seven Seals so this means Redemption could only come by a virgin birth and of course this proves corruption came by adultery so here we see this proof of the serpent seed being the Seven Seals is also the fourth out of the nine evidences of the serpent seed at least those are the nine that I've compiled there could be more of course but here's a screenshot of them the evidence number four is the serpent seed explains the purpose of the Virgin birth of Jesus so this is why Jesus had to be born virgin birth because sin entered the world through lust or adultery between the serpent and Eve not Satan and Eve The Serpent and Eve so you can pause the video if you want to read through the rest of those nine evidences of the serpent seed of course I have videos about that and I wrote a chapter about that as well my 12 New Testament Mysteries book revealed from 2021 now in the third section I want to show seven other doctrines or Revelations contained in the Seven Seals because brother Ram said the Seven Seals tied the loose ends together and what brother R meant was all the mysterious ious doctrines of the Bible that have been mysterious for over 2,000 years God used brother Ram to finish the mystery of God Revelation 10:7 and tie all those Mysteries together now everything makes sense in the Bible for the Holy Ghost filled wise virgin the Bride of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote six months before it happened we told you by the Holy Spirit I would be going there to pick up the news because the pyramid riding on the outside as a brother had the dream I interpret it to you that's the entire interpretation now all the mysteries of justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost is done explained now picking up the Loose Ends of that which is concealed in the Seven Seals not the seven churches the Seven Seals reveal the Mysteries and then he opened this thing up the top and found a rock in there white but it never been rode on now let's go through these seven other doctrines of Revelations in the order of appearance so the first one actually in Revelation 5 is the godhead in Revelation 5: 5-7 we see the lamb who's also called a lion comes forth and takes the book and notice he's called the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David and so if he's the root of David and he's still alive of course that has to be God it can't be a natural man so we see the godhead is represented here and God became flesh and dwelt Among Us and of course Jesus Christ was born of the lineage of David we know that but it was God manifesting himself in the flesh as 1 Timothy 3:16 Says so notice in Revelation 5 5-7 this can only be the one true God it cannot be a second person of the Trinity because there's no such thing as the second person of the Trinity the father is the invisible spirit so God is only one person the Bible never says God is two persons three persons or more persons it's one person who manifests himself in many ways but in relation to Salvation he's manifest in three ways father son Holy Ghost remember friends God can have an infinite number of manifestations by his word like on the day of Pentecost he broke up into 120 pillars of fire or licks of fire so God can do whatever he wants he'll never break his word he'll never change his character and just like at Jesus baptism you have the voice from Heaven the spirit like a dove and Jesus the human body in the water that's not three persons that's three manifestations and you can of course prove this I love to prove this by the book of Isaiah Isaiah 4311 says I even and I am the Lord and beside me there's no savior so as trinitarians who is this speaking of which savior if this is Jesus well then God the father is not a savior neither is the Holy Ghost a savior but of course God the father is a savior of course the holy spirit is a savior because it's the one and self-same person Isaiah 44:6 God said I am the first and the last and remember of course Revelation 1:1 Jesus says I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last Revelation 1:17 fear not I'm first and the last Revelation 28 these things sayith the first and the last Revelation 2213 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning the end the first and the last so the same Lord God speaking through Isaiah is God Almighty and he manifested himself in a body called Jesus Christ of Nazareth one person the same person changing his form God in Morp changing his mask one God manifest In the Flesh Isaiah 448 says is there a god beside me yay there is no God I know not any so God doesn't say well there's another person beside me or there's a third person or second person beside me God never says that Isaiah 45 5-7 says I am the lord and there is none else there's no God beside me there is none beside me in verse 6 I am the lord and there is none else I the Lord do all these things I form the light create darkness of course the Bible says in Ephesians God created All Things by Jesus Christ that represents the invisible Spirit created All Things by by the spoken word or the logos or the visible form of the Holy Ghost not three persons but another manifestation Isaiah 45:21 and22 the Bible said there is no God else beside me a just God and a savior there is none beside me so there's only one savior verse 22 says for I am God and there is none else and I love Isaiah 44:24 as well I am the Lord that maketh all things that stretches forth the heaven alone so which person stretched forth the heavens was it the first person second person or third person there's only one person it was God Almighty and he stretched forth the heavens when he stretched it by his word he was creating or stretching the heavens by Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is the word of God John 1:1 so the first of these seven other Revelations is godhead of course this includes the water baptism water baptism should only be performed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to five examples in the book of Acts no one is ever baptized in the titles Father Son and Holy Ghost the second Revelation is the four Beast we see that in the first four seals in Revelation chap 6 they're also seen of course in Revelation 4 but brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord these four beasts are the anointings on the church for the seven Church ages and so because we have that revelation of the Beast we also have the revelation of the seven Church Ages which is called a a mystery in Revelation chap 1 and then brother Ram gave us the revelation of the church ages he said with thus sayeth the Lord he said the history plus the church ages plus the seals plus the Visions he said to the best of my understanding it's thus sayith the Lord let's listen to that quote from the sth seal 1963 Now The Vision Plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the Revelation the interpretation thereof is thus sayith the Lord the third Revelation is the mystery of iniquity we see this in the first seal Revelation 6: 1 and 2 The Mystery of iniquity is the white horse rider who is the Antichrist spirit and of course the for seal reveals the name of this white horse rider it's death and of course 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 speaks of the mystery of iniquity it's the Antichrist spirit so the Seven Seals and the Revelation Jesus gave to brother Bram gives us that third Revelation there the fourth Revelation is powerful it's in the third seal of Revelation chapter 6 and it speaks of the oil and the wine of course this is the baptism of the Holy Ghost oil it's the holy ghost in the soul and wine is stimulation of Revelation now we see oil is the Holy Ghost in Zechariah 4: 6 and: 12-4 the oil is called the anointing and it's also called my spirit not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord and then if you tie John 7: 37-39 in with this you'll see how the Holy Ghost could not be given till Jesus was glorified and that must mean in the soul because in the Old Testament the Saints could have the Holy Ghost on their flesh bodies and also their minds to see visions and of course prophesy like all the Old Testament prophets did but it can never get down to the soul that was saved for the New Testament and also there's another Revelation in there where there's a voice in the midst of the four beasts of course that's the godhead brother Ram tells us that's the voice of God that says touch not the oil and the wine hurt not the oil and the wine so notice there's only one voice not three voices there's only one voice in the midst of the four beasts because there's only one Throne there's only one God there's only one person in the godhead the fifth Revelation is Israel's blindness seen in the fifth seal Revelation 6: 9-11 this is a beautiful Revelation brother Ram tells us blinded Israelites can still be saved as long as they're trusting in the word of God or the old Old Testament or they're obeying the law as close as they possibly can we see this is true also in the entire chapter of Romans 11 and the entire chapters of Ephesians chapters 2 and 3 and I have entire chapter of course on this in my 2021 book the sixth Revelation is Daniel 70 weeks we see this in the six seal of Revelation 6: 12 to the end of the chapter this is because the six seal is called the Judgment seal and of course the Judgment seal or the Judgment time is the seven-year Great Tribulation period I have a video about Daniel 70 weeks I'll leave a link in the description for that so during this six seal or tribulation seal we see the two Jewish Prophets The Rise and Fall the Antichrist and then this also ties in the mother harlot's temporary rule with the 10 Kings and then the 10 Kings turn on the mother Harlot and then the total Destruction of the mother harlot in Revelation 18 and also because of Daniel 70 weeks we see the Everlasting righteousness brought in and of course that speaks of the Millennium so the six seal brings us Daniel 70 weeks the mother Harlot Revelation and also the Millennium and the seventh and final Revelation is actually the seventh seal from revelation 8: 1-2 of course brother Ram tells us this is the rapture this is the second coming of Jesus Christ the secret sudden coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to snatch away his Gentile bride away before the Great Tribulation period we know this is an unknown day and hour according to Matthew 24:36 it's called a mystery in 1 Corinthians 15: 51- 54 and it's also described as a meeting in the air in 1 Thessalonians 4: 16-1 17 of course I have numerous videos about the Rapture I'll leave a link to those in the description I also wrote an entire chapter about it as well in my 2021 book in closing friends hope this video was a blessing again I was so stirred up by the Revelation that serpent seed was in the Seven Seals it was in Revelation 5 I'll leave a link to that sermon in the description as well I just thought I'd share with the Saints this is one thing I love about being a message believer the Bible keeps opening up more and more as time goes on you know God has given my brother Simon a few wonderful revelations in these last few months and so I felt like this was a personal revelation to me given of course by the holy spirit because it lines up with the word of God God sent it through a prophet brother brandham and so I rejoice in the continual Revelation you know we must be in the spirit on the Lord Lord's day as Revelation 1 says and we must be in the spirit of Revelation as St Paul says we're so grateful that the Loose Ends have been tied together the Bible is a brand new Bible to us the Bible gives us a clear understanding of who we are where we're going where we came from the end times we are just so thankful for all that the Lord has revealed to us it reminds me of the Book of John the Gospel of John where Jesus said you used to be servants but now you're my friends and I tell my friends all the things that I'm doing God has told us so much through the ministry of brother brandham we're so grateful for that also reminds me of Genesis 18 where God said I won't hide the thing that I'm doing from Abraham I'll let him know because he's kept the way of the Lord he's trained his household and by God's grace we're Abraham's seed because we have faith in Jesus Christ let's keep drawing nigh to God and God will continue to draw nigh to us and reveal more of his Revelation to us if you have any questions or concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
