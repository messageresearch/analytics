Description:
Part 2 of this series begins by explaining the compound prophecy in Malachi 4:6 - which includes two separate ministries of the Spirit of Elijah. The first ministry was John the Baptist, according to Luke 1:17. We believe the second ministry was that of William Branham. The second half of this video deals with the prophet or "son of man" ministry that God gave to William Branham. Not only was Brother Branham a prophet, but the anointing of Jesus upon his prophet-gift was the "Sign of the Messiah" to the Gentiles - the last sign to the Gentiles before the rapture, spoken with the authority of "Thus saith the Lord!"
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] William brandham in Malachi 45 and 6 we mentioned moments ago that Malachi 4: 5 and 6 promised that a man who was a prophet Anointed with the spirit of Elijah was promised to come in the New Testament before the Judgment of the world Mal 46 actually contains a compound Prophecy with two separate Elijah Ministries sharing the same verse we believe this interpretation has to be correct for Bible readers will know that half of Malachi 4:6 was already fulfilled in the ministry of John the Baptist according to Luke 1:1 17 which helps unlock the spiritual understanding of this important end time prophecy Luke 1:17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord according to Luke 1:1 17 John the Baptist was anointed with the spirit and power of Elijah and fulfilled the first half of Malachi 4:6 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the [Music] children thankfully the Holy Spirit in his word has interpreted John's Ministry for us he John the Baptist shall turn the heart through an obedient repentant heart for repentance was his message according to Mark 1:4 of the fathers those who first confess faith in the Messiah Jesus Christ to the children those who be the last to confess faith in Jesus Christ the Messiah at his return this was exactly what John the Baptist did his preaching of repentance with the spirit and power of Elijah prepared the hearts of the first generation of Believers in Jesus Christ to receive Christ as Messiah their Savior and then the hearts of those early Apostolic Believers were now burdened in their hearts to see the children or last generation of Believers except Jesus Christ as their Messiah early Apostles like St Paul and St Peter were deeply burdened for the return of Jesus Christ to the Earth as evidenced by numerous scriptures urging the Believers to be patient and Trust in Jesus's Second Coming the early apostles were burdened for the children those Believers that would come after them and see The Return of Jesus Christ to Earth as we then examine Malachi 4: 5 and 6 again we can plainly see that only the first half of Malachi 4:6 was fulfilled in the ministry of John the Baptist and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children taught specifically by Luke 1:17 then the second half of the verse in our humble opinion wasn't fulfilled until God sent the Elijah anointed Ministry of William brandham to this age we believe the ministry of William brandham was and is still turning the heart of the children to their fathers meaning that his bible-based preaching of repentance and obedience like John the Baptist would burden the hearts of the Endtime Christians to love serve and understand God just like the early Apostolic Believers or the book of Acts fathers of our faith we can clearly see how the compound prophecy of Malachi 4:5 and6 fits into the bible promises for this time period the last days Jesus will remain in heaven and not return to the Earth until all things including the hearts of the end time Believers or children are restored to obedience through the mysteries of the Bible being revealed by a prophet Anointed with the spirit of [Music] Elijah the prophet or son of man Ministry of William brandham as we showed briefly at the start of this video we believe God gave William brandham a prophet Ministry which can also be called a son of man Ministry the Old Testament Prophet Ezekiel was called a son of man by God himself in Ezekiel 2: 1-6 in the New Testament Jesus is the son of man the greatest Prophet the god Prophet according to Matthew 16:13 Luke 11:30 1 John 41 and 2 Matthew 1:23 and 1 Timothy 3:16 every Prophet would then be considered a son of man but Jesus is the son of man the god propit at Jesus's first coming he showed the sign of the Messiah the discernment gift of knowing the thoughts secrets and intents of the Heart by vision to both the Jews and Samaritans in John 1 35-51 and John 4: 4-30 but there's no scripture that shows Jesus showing the sign of the Messiah to the Gentiles at his first coming and that is because Jesus was not sent to the Gentiles at his first coming for he came to his own Israel but his own received him not according to John chap 1 but God being just and fair was obligated to send this Prophet Ministry this sign of the Messiah to the Gentiles before the times of the Gentiles was finished or fulfilled according to Luke 21:4 or else he would have given the Jews and the Samaritans a greater visitation than the Gentiles thankfully for the Gentiles two scriptures teach that the son of man Ministry of Jesus would again be sent but this time to the Gentiles just before the day and hour of his second coming and the end of the the world as Jesus taught this himself in Matthew 24: 36 and 37 and Luke 17: 26 to 37 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it also be in the days of the son of man likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be this is where the Supernatural and prophetic Ministry of William brandham comes in as our three short clips showed earlier the son of man Ministry of William brandham manifested the power and discernment of Jesus Christ never before seen in this day and age no Ministry in recent history has manifested the sign of the Messiah the discern of the thoughts secrets and intents of the Heart by Vision like the ministry that God gave to William brandham this proves to us that God sent the spirit of Jesus Christ the son of man to anoint the humble Ministry of William brandham a son of man in order to show the Gentiles the sign of the Messiah before the Great Tribulation period we believe God has proven that Luke 17:30 is fulfilled the son of man has been revealed Jesus's son of man Ministry has anointed a prophet William brandham in order to reveal himself and his soon appearing this sign of the Messiah Ministry Christ anointing William brandham was the last sign to the Gentiles before the Rapture and the destruction of this sodomite world just as in the days of Abraham according to Genesis chapters 18 and 19 God came in a flesh body to Abraham and discerned the thoughts of Sarah's heart as she stood behind him in the tent revealing her thoughts according to Genesis 18: 9-15 please know that our church did not dream up or fabricate this interpretation of the son of man Ministry but God came and spoke it to this generation with thus sayeth the Lord and remember Abraham and his group never received one more sign from God until the promised son arrived how many knows that's true that sign of discernment and the Royal Seed of Abraham let me hear you let me tell you thus sayith the Lord you're receiving your last time that's according to the scriptures and the revelation of God that's in my heart that speaks that this is the truth and I trust that you will believe it to be the truth what more do you want to see remember I tell you in the name of the Lord if you regard me to be his servant this is the last sign that the church will see according to the scripture that's the last thing that Abraham seen done before the promised son arrived and we are the Royal Seed of Abraham and Jesus Promised the Royal seed to see the same thing that Abraham seen just before the Gentile World burned let me ask you how are you ever going to you'll never receive another sign this is Lord what a prophet of God make a statement like that wasn't you're receiving your greatest time and your life time before the appearing of chist come remember let me tell you thus say the spirit of God that's on me this is the last sign to the Gentile Church before the Rapture thus sath the word of God thus sayith the holy spirit that speaks that knows the secret of the heart thus sayith the Lord you are receiving your last call just remember thus saith the Lord you will never in any or more Gentile Church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign to the church [Music]
