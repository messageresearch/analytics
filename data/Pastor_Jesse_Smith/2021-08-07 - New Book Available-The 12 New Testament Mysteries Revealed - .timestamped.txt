[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] greetings friends
[0:03] in the matchless name of the lord jesus
[0:05] christ my second book is now available
[0:08] uh the title is the twelve new testament
[0:10] mysteries revealed
[0:11] rapture wisdom for christ's bride
[0:17] the book is now available on amazon in
[0:20] paperback
[0:21] the kindle version is still pending it's
[0:24] awaiting approval from
[0:25] amazon so i apologize about the delay
[0:28] there
[0:29] now the audio book is free on my
[0:32] personal website
[0:34] pastor jesse smith dot com forward slash
[0:37] 12 mysteries book
[0:41] i have 6 out of the 14 chapters finished
[0:44] on the audio books i'll be working on
[0:46] that
[0:46] project to finish it up in the next
[0:48] month or two lord willing
[0:50] and recall friends i still have the
[0:52] audio book free for the first book
[0:54] called restoring christian modesty now
[0:57] friends the purpose of this book is
[0:58] twofold
[0:59] first for message believers it gives
[1:01] them a bible foundation
[1:03] to prove that brother branham finished
[1:05] all the mysteries of god
[1:06] in the bible and what we mean by that is
[1:10] any doctrine that was called a mystery
[1:11] in the new testament has been revealed
[1:14] according to revelation 10 verse 7 it
[1:16] was given to the seventh
[1:18] church age messenger which we know was
[1:20] william branham
[1:22] if you look up the word mystery in the
[1:24] concordance the word mystery is used 27
[1:27] times
[1:28] 12 of them are bible doctrines and
[1:30] that's what the book
[1:31] teaches brother branham actually said
[1:34] thus saith the lord on 6 out of the 12
[1:37] mystery so we have prophetic proof
[1:40] that the mysteries of god are finished
[1:42] and half of them are backed
[1:44] with thus saith the lord these 12
[1:46] mysteries were foreshadowed in at least
[1:48] two places in the bible
[1:50] elijah's twelve stones that he used to
[1:53] restore the altar of worship before the
[1:55] fire fell
[1:56] i believe that typed brother branham are
[1:58] restoring the 12
[2:00] new testament mysteries before the fire
[2:02] fell which is the latter rain
[2:05] also the 12 pieces of shoe bread i
[2:07] believe we're a type
[2:09] of the new testament worshiper feasting
[2:11] on the 12 mysteries that brother branham
[2:13] revealed to us by the power of the holy
[2:15] spirit
[2:16] in fact friends brother branham taught
[2:17] this revelation
[2:19] in the sermon fellowship by redemption
[2:21] in 1955.
[2:23] now he didn't mention 12 new testament
[2:25] mysteries but he described
[2:27] our worship as new testament believers
[2:30] as an anti-type
[2:31] of the old testament tabernacle of moses
[2:34] so for example the outer court
[2:36] was the washing of the water baptism in
[2:39] the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:41] now in the holy place you had three
[2:43] furniture pieces
[2:45] first you had the light of the seven
[2:46] golden candlesticks
[2:48] which type the anointing of the seven
[2:50] church ages is the same
[2:51] in every church age and that represented
[2:55] the anointing of the holy spirit for
[2:56] sanctification
[2:58] the second furniture piece was the table
[3:00] of shoe bread which is the bread
[3:02] or truth of the gospel and that's where
[3:05] i believe this book comes in the 12
[3:07] new testament mysteries the third piece
[3:09] was the altar of incense which showed
[3:11] you had to have a sincere prayer life
[3:13] to take you into the third place the
[3:16] holiest of holies
[3:17] or the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:20] so see friends we can understand all the
[3:23] mysteries and not have
[3:24] charity according to first corinthians
[3:26] 13 but new testament worshipers should
[3:29] have the truth
[3:30] and remember the bread represents truth
[3:32] according to first corinthians 5 verse 8
[3:36] paul said we worship with the unleavened
[3:38] bread of sincerity and in truth
[3:41] so the goal of this book again is to
[3:43] teach message believers the truth of
[3:46] the revelations that god gave us through
[3:47] brother branham the doctrinal truth of
[3:49] it
[3:50] that they might develop a prayer life
[3:52] and take them into the baptism of the
[3:53] holy ghost
[3:55] now second purpose of this book friends
[3:58] is to prove to those who do not follow
[3:59] the message that our message is
[4:01] completely
[4:02] bible-based last year i debated uh
[4:05] believe the sign
[4:06] back in september 2020 and their claim
[4:09] is that the message is not based upon
[4:11] the bible
[4:12] but back in november of 2018 when the
[4:14] lord inspired me to start writing this
[4:16] book
[4:17] my goal was to prove that this message
[4:18] is completely backed by the bible
[4:21] so those are the two full purposes of
[4:23] this book now the price is 1995.
[4:26] now friends please know we're not out to
[4:28] make money i already put those
[4:30] quotes from brother branham and in my
[4:32] desire just to spread the message
[4:33] in the previous video about this book
[4:37] now we don't have nothing to sell well
[4:40] i'll take that back the boys has the
[4:42] books and tapes and the pictures i think
[4:44] and so forth
[4:45] in the back of the building and there i
[4:48] buy those books
[4:50] brother gordon lindsey prints those
[4:52] books and i buy them for 40 cents less
[4:54] than i have to sell them
[4:55] then pay for them to be transferred you
[4:58] know what you make
[4:59] you don't make nothing you lose on it's
[5:01] the message
[5:02] and the pictures i think they just about
[5:06] expenses to send them is about we don't
[5:08] want to make nothing
[5:10] we brought nothing into this world it's
[5:12] certain we take nothing out
[5:14] what we're trying to do i wouldn't even
[5:16] let those books be there
[5:18] or those things if i didn't think it
[5:19] would help you some way see
[5:21] and i told the boys if i walk to the
[5:24] bookstand stand around watch a few
[5:26] minutes and see an old dad come up say
[5:28] how much is that book it's uh 50 cents
[5:31] and he reached down
[5:32] only got give it to him anyhow let it go
[5:35] see anyone and can't afford it and
[5:38] anything like that some poor person
[5:40] let him have it it's right it'll come
[5:43] some other way somewhere
[5:45] and so it always has and it always will
[5:47] if you just
[5:48] put god first that's all put god first
[5:53] but our ministry only makes two dollars
[5:55] on these books
[5:57] and remember i didn't make any money on
[5:59] my first book i'm not trying to make any
[6:01] money
[6:01] i'm trying to get the message out now
