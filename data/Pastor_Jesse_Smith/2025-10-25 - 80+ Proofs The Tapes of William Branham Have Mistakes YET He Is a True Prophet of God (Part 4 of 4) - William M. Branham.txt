TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the other day I got something mixed up. I happen to hear it. It's I caught it right there and it's on the tape and I I probably hear from it. Boy, it's a great teaching there. I didn't touch the edge of it, but if you happen to catch that on your tape, remember, look in the Bible. You see, and that um that I am perfectly infallible, that there's nothing. And what was some of the awfulest things you ever heard? And it's causing a lot of confusion. And uh this church knows that we don't stand for no such Tommy rod as that. We believe in the Bible. &gt;&gt; So the Bible is perfectly true. And that's what we stand on the Bible. It must be thus sayeth the Lord. It's got to come to one final absolute. [music] And my absolute is the word, the Bible. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends [music] in the matches name of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is part four in the series of 60 plus proofs. The tapes of William Brandham have mistakes on them. Yet, he's a genuine prophet of God. Part three ended at number 69. So, we'll increase this up to number 80 today by God's grace. So, I'll change the title and the thumbnail to 80 plus proofs. There are mistakes on the tapes. Yet, Brother Brandham is a genuine prophet of God. Friends, as I deal online with both preachers and tape worshippers, tape boys, I'm reminded again of how Brother Brandham said, "The Bible is the only book in existence that tells us where we come from, where we are, where we're going, and is thus sayith the Lord." Every word in the Bible is thus sayeth the Lord. And the quote where brother said this is the resurrection of Lazarus, 1953. Here's the only book that tells you where you come from, who you are, and where you're going. That's the only book there is in existence is that Bible. And I believe every word of it. Just I believe it's just like it's written there. I just ready to hang my soul on any phase and say it's thus sayith the Lord. Yes, sir. So notice brother Ram said it's the only book in existence where he believed every word of it. It's the only book that tells you these things. So that eliminates brother Random's own sermon books and the church age book and the seven seal book and any other books about his ministry as books that have every word as thus sayith the Lord. The Bible is the only book in which every word is thus sayith the Lord. That's according to brother Brandham. And of course we know that's according to the Bible itself. Revelation 22 tells us not to add one word nor take one word away from the words of this prophecy. The Bible says every word of God is pure. Add thou not unto God's words. In Proverbs 30, lest God call you a liar. And remember, Brother Ram said, "The most important thing of today is a good God-scent preacher, a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of God. It's the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister." I'm not exalting myself, but I'm just stating what Brother Ram said. A preacher is the most important thing, not a tape pusher or tape button pusher. So, only a God-called preacher can bring up faith in Christ, as Brother M said. So tape button pushers do not bring up faith in Christ, but they do bring up deception. They do increase the deity spirit in people by telling them to just press play and obey, which we know is disobey. Friends, when people stop discerning the tapes of brother Brandham, they open themselves up to the deity spirit. Whether you're a tape boy or a preacher, the Bible said, "Prove all things. Test every spirit." So, anyone who stands behind every quote from 47 to 65 is an idoltor, a heretic. They're seduced by the deity spirit. They don't believe everything on the tapes, and they certainly don't listen or hear what the spirit is saying on the tapes. They call us devils if we say, "Brother Brandham had an opinion on something." And yet, Brother Brandham said his opinion was just like anyone else's in marriage and divorce, February 1965. Brother Brandham admitted there were mixups on the tapes. He said, 'I make those kind of mistakes all the time, such as slips of the tongue, saying 700 did not bow the knee rather than the 7,000 that the Bible says. So, how can these tape worshippers be born again? I don't know. That will be up to God. Especially the preachers who do not work full-time jobs. They have all day to study the quotes and the Bible, and yet they still come away saying, "Every word is thus sayith the Lord." They stand by every quote from 47 to 65. They are deceived and deceiving others sadly. Let's get in here to number 70. We'll go through numbers 70 through 80. So the 70th proof, not every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord is 1960 December 4th in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Brother Ram said quote when Apostle Peter said there is no other mediator between God and men but that man Christ Jesus one. End quote. So notice brother Ram said Peter said this but this is not thus sayith the Lord. It was actually Paul that said this. It's in 1 Timothy 2:5. For there's one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. Any person who says that quote is thus sayith the Lord is deceived of a deity spirit, foolish, insane, idoltor, heretic, whatever the Bible calls them, that's what they are. They are tape worshippers. They are man worshippers. They're the ones bowing down to Nebuchadnezzar's image. They're not like the three Hebrew children that stood despite the pressure to bow down and worship Nebuchadnezzar's image of Daniel the prophet. Number 71. Brother Bram said, "We are co-equal with Jesus Christ in his presence." He said this in 1954. He said, "Oh brother, that's you that's born again are sons and daughters of God co-equal with Jesus Christ in his presence. Oh my." End quote. So, I can see brother Ram's talking about the relationship between God and the bornagain believers. He's restoring their fellowship in relationship in God perfecting his church 1954. But there's also quotes of Brother Brandon that say the opposite in 1958 tested faith produces goods. Brother Ram said, quote, there's never been a man equal to him. End quote. So, Brother Ram said, there's never been a man equal, but yet the other quote says we are co-equal in his presence. Friends, if you go to the Bible, Revelation 5:es 4 and 5, the 24 elders in heaven were not as worthy as Jesus. They were not co-equal. The Bible said, "No man was found worthy to open and read the book." And one of the elders said to John, "Weep not. The lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof." So the Bible plainly teaches, "No man is co-equal to Jesus Christ, not even in heaven." You see that also in Revelation chapter 4 where the elders and the angels bow down and worship Jesus. Jesus gets all the praise, all the worship. He's the only worthy one. No one is co-equal to the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible even says there's no equal to God. Isaiah 40:2, "To whom then will you liken me? Or shall I be equal? Saith the Holy One." So God's asking, "Who will be equal to me?" There's no one equal to God. Isaiah 46:5, "To whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like?" So again, there is no equal to God. There is no equal to Jesus Christ. There's no one like Jesus. Now, in one way in heaven, we'll be sinless. Thank God by the grace of God for giving us a theophony and eventually a glorified body after the rapture. But still then, we will not be co-equal. Will not know everything God knows. will not be able to do everything God can do. He gives us a portion of eternal life. We do not get the fullness of the godhead bodily that was only given to Jesus Christ. Let's move on to number 72. And this one ought to destroy all the tape worshippers, their false doctrines, and idolatry. In 1961, questions and answers. Brother Random said, "I'm going to be honest as I can be. I don't think I'd have anything to do with that messenger." End quote. But when he's talking about how little Willie put Brother Ram's name under the star out there on the seven church ages and Brother Ram said, "As honest as I can be, I don't have anything to do with that messenger." Friends, how can the tape worshippers say this is thus sayith the Lord? If this is thus sayith the Lord, Brother Brandham is not the seventh church age messenger. These people are insane who say they stand behind every quote from 47 to 65. these evangelists, preachers, pastors, whatever they are, how can they stand behind that? Who then is a seventh church age messenger if not brother William Brandham? So what is the rightly divided truth here? Brother Ram was being honest. He was being humble. He said he was as honest as he could be. So at that time God had not yet revealed to him that he was the seventh church age messenger. But of course later he must have done that. In anointed ones at the end time 65, brother Ram said, "I challenge you. Check every newspaper." He said Malachi 4 restoring the hearts of the children back to the fathers is on the earth right now with thus sayeth the lord. And then in the church age book lays out in the chapter on the leosian church age that no doubt it was his ministry that was the ministry of the seventh church age messenger a prophet messenger. So please share this quote with anyone you know who worships the tapes. If that is thus sayith the lord then who is the seventh church age messenger? Is it Joseph Brandham? Is it Billy Paul? No, it is brother William Brandham. But he just grew in his revelation. The 73rd proof is brother Brandham said twothirds of the angels were deceived by Satan. He said this in questions and answers on Genesis 53. Quote, "And twothirds of the earth is in sin and more than that which twothirds of the angels was kicked out." End quote. So is that the truth? Is that thus sayith the Lord were twothirds of the angels kicked out of heaven? The answer is no. It was a third. Revelation 12:4 said, "And his tale drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth." End quote. The tale of course was Satan the dragon. Satan deceived a third of the angels. And in that quote, brother Bram said twoth3s. Anyone that stands behind that quote has the deity spirit is an idoltor. [snorts] Number 74 is brother Ram said a prophet quote he don't hold meetings and discuss things end quote. This is from taking sides with Jesus 1962. But if you read the Bible friends in Acts chapter 15 a prophet did hold meetings. It was the prophet St. Paul. Acts 15:2 says Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension. They determined they should go up to Jerusalem under the apostles and elders about this question. So they held a meeting to discuss if the Gentiles could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. In Acts 15:6, the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. In verse 12, the audience or multitude gave audience to Barnabas and Saul. And notice who gives the last word in this meeting or this council. It was St. James in verse 13. And after they had held their peace, James answered saying, "Men and brethren, hearken unto me." And if you go down to verse 22, it says, "Then pleased it the apostles and elders and the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely Judas surname Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren." So preachers around the message have said the prophet always gets the last word and prophets don't hold meetings, but here a prophet holds a meeting. And who did he give the last word to? St. James, which as far as history, I don't think he was a prophet. At least I haven't heard that. But the point I'm trying to make is that preachers today will say, "Brother Ram gets the last word on everything. Prophets don't hold meetings." But actually, the Bible gets the last word on everything. Jesus is the first and the last. And Jesus is called the word of God. Again, it's just a deception of the deity spirit to try to worship Brother Brandham to make him untouchable, every word infallible. It's a lying, deceiving deity spirit. The 75th proof is the 144,000 are martyrs or are they rescued by Jesus? In the fifth [snorts] seal 1963, brother Ram said, quote, notice these souls are to wait a little season for the 144 to be martyed. End quote. But then the church age book, Brother Ram says, speaking of the 144,000, quote, with the enemy repulsed, then Jesus comes and presents himself to the 144,000. End quote. So in the fifth seal, brother Ram said the 144,000 are martyed. But then in the church age book, brother Ram says the 144,000 are saved because the enemy is repulsed by the coming of Jesus to the 144,000. So what is the rightly divided word of truth? I don't know. I think I would lean that Jesus would rescue them because they had the seal of the Holy Ghost and God is not going to judge and let the wrath of God come upon the righteous and the wicked. Just the wicked receive the wrath of Almighty God. But I could be wrong. I don't know. Brother Random said all the questions after the rapture won't hurt if we have a different opinion on them. He said that in questions answers on the seals 1963. But again, I just want to show how there's quotes on both sides of the topic by God's grace. The 76 proof is that brother Random called the sixth seal the fifth seal. So in the sixth seal sermon 1963, brother Random said, "Now watch here on the sixth seal 69-11," speaking of Revelation 6:es 9-11. "And when he'd opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held." So this is undeniable. Brother Random says, "We're going to read the sixth seal and then he reads the fifth seal." So this has to be a slip of the tongue. That's the rightly divided word of truth. The sixth seal is not Revelation 69-11. That's the fifth seal. Anyone that says different is deceived. They're a liar. They're a heretic. They're an idoltor of the tapes. The 77th proof is brother Ram said the woman has sperm and egg. So he said woman has sperm in questions answers part 164. Quote they tried it over and over. It's infertile to the woman's sperm and now they can't find it. End quote. So, Brother Ram says, "A woman has sperm." And then, Brother Ram says, "A woman has an egg and thirst." 1965. Quote, "We realize, Father, that when the sperm, the genes from the male and female come together, there is only one out of a million that's accepted. One germ from the male finds the fertile egg of the woman, the female, and a million others perish." End quote. So, Brother Ram said, "Women have sperm." And then he said, "The fertile egg of the woman." So, how do we understand this? If every word is thus sayith the Lord. Do women have both egg and sperm in order to reproduce? If every word is thus sayith the Lord, women have sperm according to questions answers part one 1964. So what is the right divided word of truth here? The truth is women only have eggs. And brother Brand must have gave a slip of the tongue or just made a mental mistake when he said infertile to the women's sperm. Anyone that would say women have sperm and it's thus sayith the Lord. Every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord and they stand behind the quote that animal seed is infertile to the woman's sperm is deceived by a deity spirit. Proof number 78. Brother Ram said we are in a reformation. And then he says we're not in a reformation. We're in a restoration. So the first quote is questions answers part 164. Brother Ram said, "I was reading about Martin Luther here not long ago, not comparing ourselves with that, but this is a reformation just the same as that was." End quote. So, Brother Ram said, "His ministry is a reformation." And then he says in the church age book, quote, "The Lutheran Age did not restore the church. It started a reformation." I'm going to skip down a little bit. Quote, now notice in verse 25, it tells why we need a restoration. End quote. So in this quote in the church age book, brother Random is showing that Luther was a reformation, but his ministry was a restoration because he's using Joel 2:23-26. And he's talking about how God is going to restore the church. God isn't going to plant a new church, but he's going to bring back his original planting back to the original seed. So what is the rightly divided word of truth? Are we in a reformation or a restoration? Why I believe the rightly divided word of truth is that we're in a restoration according to Joel chapter 2 23-26 because brother Ram said with thus sayith the Lord I'll restore sayith the Lord and the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride with thus sayith the Lord. But what does a tape worshipper do when brother Ram said he was in a reformation just the same as theirs were? Are we in a reformation or not? Brother Ram said we were in one place in one place he said we weren't. We're in a restoration. So, do you stand behind every quote? And do you believe we're in a reformation and a restoration? Which one are we in? So, I hope you can see the deception and the folly of saying every quote on tape is thus sayith the Lord. In one quote, he says we're in a reformation. In the next quote, he says we're not in a reformation, we're in a restoration. Thank God for the Holy Ghost to lead and guide us into all truth. Proof number 79. Brother Ram said he can't interpret God's word and no man can interpret God's word. But then he says prophets were called to interpret God's word. In [clears throat] 1964 when their eyes were open, brother Ram said, quote, God don't need any interpreter. I can't interpret his word. Neither can anybody interpret his word. He don't need nobody to tell this is that or that is that. He does it himself. Our interpretations is nothing to the scripture. He speaks it himself and that's the way it is. End quote. I think I made a video about this quote before, but brother Ram said he cannot interpret God's word. No one else can. So if that is thus sayith the Lord, brother Ram did not interpret God's word. And so Tate Boy cannot say brother Ram interpreted God's word because brother Ram said he can't interpret his word and nobody else can. But then 8 days later in God identifying himself by his characteristics 64 brother Ram said quote that was the characteristic of a prophet was when he foretold things and it happened. Now that was his characteristic of his identification that God was with him then that gave him the rights to interpret the word for that day because the word of God come to the prophets the characteristic of the prophet that he foretold end quote and there's many quotes like this friends if you listen to tapes of brother Brandham where he says God needs a prophet to interpret the word of God. Brother Ram even prayed in questions answers part 164. Quote, "We pray God that you'll give us prophets to interpret this word to us that we might know whether we're right or wrong." End quote. So what is the rightly divided word of truth here? Well, I believe both quotes can be true. No prophet of their own ability can interpret the word of God. I believe that's what brother Brandham is saying in the first quote when their eyes were open when he said, "I can't interpret his word. Neither can anybody interpret his word." In other words, there's no ability inside the prophet himself. Brother Brandon, Paul, Moses, Joshua, any other prophet. No prophet has any human ability to interpret God's word on their own. They need help from the Holy Ghost. They need a gift of a prophet to do that. And that gift comes from the Holy Ghost. So, I believe both quotes work together when you fully understand what brother Ram's talking about and the rest of the scripture. But I challenge any tape worshipper. Brother Ram said, "I can't interpret his word." And brother Ram said he has nothing to do with that seventh star, that seventh church age messenger. I challenge any tape worshipper to tell me they believe both of those. And then they'll see they don't believe every word on tape and not every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord. So sad these people are liars. They're deceived. They're anointed with the deity spirit. They need to repent. The 80th and final proof for this video is brother Ram said Elisha said do will not fall till I call for it. This was in spiritual food in due season 1965. Quote the same place that Elisha walked up and said why the dew will not fall till I call for it. End quote. Brother Ram said Elisha who came after Elijah said do will not fall till he called for it. But later on the sermon, brother Ram said it was Elijah. He said in paragraph 12, quote, "And Elijah the Tishbite said unto Ahab, there shall not be due nor rain these three years, but according to my word." End quote. Paragraph 33, quote, Elijah, he represented, "It wasn't going to rain now according to the word of the Lord, for three for 3 years and 6 months or until Elijah called for it." End quote. So in the same sermon you have brother Ram saying the person who called for no due to fall for three and a half years was two different people. It was both Elijah and Elisha. Well can't be both. So which one is the rightly divided word of truth? Well of course according to the Bible it was Elijah not Elisha. And anyone that would say Elisha was the one who called for due from heaven is deceived in a sad spiritual condition. They're a fool. They're a heretic. They are an idoltor of tapes. They worship a man. And the Bible pleads with us over and over again in the New Testament to keep ourselves from idols. Yet these people go year after year after year of saying they believe everything on the tapes is thus sayith the Lord. They stand behind every quote from 47 to 65 and they call people like me devils. And anyone who has an honest heart and is just trying to rightly divide the word of truth and take every word of brother back to the Bible, they call us devils. So friends, God will be the judge. Pride goes before the fall. Our duty is humble ourselves and keep doing what the Bible said and brother Ram said, rightly divide the word of truth, prove all things, test every spirit. Search the scripture daily whether these things be so. Thank you for watching part four. Lord willing to part five here in the future by God's grace.
