TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and now by the help of God I believe that I'm directing the Bride of Jesus [Music] Christ Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ I felt led to make a video on why I'm a message believer my name is Jesse Smith I'm pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for the past 17 years and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 so here's a brief history of my life and how I grew up religiously of course I have a full video about my testimony if you'd like to watch that but I was raised in Assembly of God Church a trinitarian church and I was there all 18 years of my life before I came to college here in akan Ohio at 16 years old I tried to get saved I got baptized but it wasn't a sincere baptism and so so I kept living worldly but then when I came to college and halfway between my freshman year I was attending a church here in akaran called the chapel they have a lot of Baptist Doctrine I went to an athletes and action conference and got saved I finally repented of my sins and gave my heart to the Lord for nearly the next 2 years I Faithfully worshiped at the chapel until my brother Simon shared with me the bible-based message of William brandham that was in late November 2001 ever since then I've been a message believer and so now I'll look at the reasons why I'm a message believer reason number one I believe the message that God gave to William brandham is the most biblical form of Christianity I have ever seen the bible message that God gave to William brandham has made me fall in love with the Holy Bible and I say the same as brother brandom said if there was a more biblical form of Christianity I would certainly follow it well if I thought that there was a denomination or any other group of Believers that had anything better than we have here Brethren I would I want to emerge this little body with it right quick I've waited I have longed I have been under anticipations and believe that some great one was coming someday or maybe the great prophet that a speak will come of the Elijah I've always believed and thought maybe that that maybe I'd live to Sea the day that when I could change when I'd see that person rise on the scene then I could take my little church and say Brethren this is the man we have looked for this man he is the one I've waited for that people who pump and didn't love me at all nobody had any use for me and now by the help of God I believe it I'm directing the Bride of Jesus Christen Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound I've been studying the Bible for the last 24 years and then studying the sermons of William Brandon for the last 22 years and preaching the Bible for the last 20 years and I have fallen in love more and more with the Lord Jesus Christ and His Holy Bible through the ministry that God gave to William brandham reason number two the bible message that God gave to William brandham balances the spirit and Truth as Jesus said in John 4:23 24 God is looking for worshippers to Worship in spirit and in truth so growing up in Assemblies of God denomination they believe in the moving of the spirit there was always tongues and interpretations and my mother had amazing Miracle healed of liver cancer but they lacked a lot of Bible truth they didn't believe in Holiness they said tongues were the evidence of the Holy Ghost and then in college the mega church I attended were kind of the opposite they had more truth of the scripture but they had very little moving of the Holy Spirit when it came to the Bible revelations that God gave to William brandham now I'm in a church where we have the spirit and Truth my testimony video has a list of some of the Miracles God has done that's just a few of them and I've seen all nine gifts of the holy spirit operate in our church over the past 17 years I pastored this church and of course I believe brother Ram taught the truth of the Bible with more depth and accuracy than any other preacher this perfect combination of the spirit and Truth has convince me that Jesus Christ is in this message I know there's a lot of accusers out there who have left the ministry of William brandham and by God's grace I believe God has called me to defend this bible-based ministry of brother brandom but in all my interactions with them they do not accept the truth of the Bible not one of them has tried to read my books and have honestly looked at the research I've done both church history and church doctrine not one of them this shows me they're afraid of the truth I'll research their claims and I find most of them are slanderous most of them are presumptuous but not a single one of them will read my research and try to refute it that's one proof to me that they're afraid of the truth but here in our church we stand on both the Holy Spirit and Truth by the grace of God a third reason I'm a message believer is because of the depth of Truth The Deep Revelations of the Holy Spirit the Bible says the spirit searches the Deep things yay the Deep things of God and brother br's Ministry fulfilled Revelation 10:7 the mysteries of God are finished brother brandom preached the 12 New Testament Mysteries I lay that out in my 2021 book brother BR also gave us so many wonderful deep Revelations such as the wise and foolish virgin MDC the Waters of Separation there are so many wonderful Revelations and we don't have to wonder is this true or not we have the Bible Revelation with thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the scripture and God is has revealed them to us by his grace another reason I believe the message is because of the love for church history brother random preached this beautiful series on the seven Church ages and then the Seven Seals brother Brandon pulled so much truth out of church history and showed us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if you want to understand God's true interpretation of church history and listen to the seven Church ages read the church age book listen to The Seven Seals read the seven seal book the Holy Ghost LED brother brandom to see which messenger of the ages stayed most true to Paul's pattern and First Timothy chapter 1 says Paul was the pattern for Ministry and so brother bandam caught that Revelation and gives us so much truth about church history friends I preached over 125 sermons just on the Book of Revelation I could have preached more because brother Brandon was so faithful to the holy spirit in bringing out true church history I constantly feel like I can only scratch the Sur surface on these deep wonderful Bible Mysteries Bible truths that the Holy Spirit gave us through his Prophet brother brandham I love how brother brandham showed the faith and Revelation given to Paul irenius Martin Columba Martin Luther John Wesley these were wonderful men of God who received Revelation from the Holy Spirit another example is how brother brandham showed how Constantine was not a real believer I was surprised so many denominations think Constantine was saved there's no way he was saved he was a murderer he was an idolator there were so many things wrong with his life and the Holy Ghost gave brother brand the true understanding about Constantine and so many other topics in church history another reason I love this message is because as the most biblical form of church government acts 14:23 and Titus 15 say that Paul ordained Elders in every city and so message churches that are faithful to the Bible have elders which are normally trustees so the pastor is the head of the Church of course also another Bible word for pastor is Bishop but the pastor is accountable to the trustees just as Paul taught in the Bible our church government has no Creed but Christ every denomination that writes their own Creed eventually changes it falls away from it or allows more sin in the church Creed but not this message this message has only one Creed book and it's the entire Bible by the grace of God we have no popes no Creeds no archbishops no denominations we have local Sovereign churches we have sister churches we fellowship with everyone is accountable to everyone another reason I'm a message believer is because of the five full ministry in Ephesians 4:11 the Bible says without the five full ministry people are tossed by every wind of Doctrine so the five full ministry gives us stability the Bible also says the five full ministry will bring us into the unity of Faith to the full measure of stature of Christ for each of our individual lives and I've seen that so clearly as a pastor I can only do 1th of the ministry in the lives of our church members the Saints and so we need the other four gifts of the Holy Spirit to bring maturity to our lives I love seeing evangelist come in teachers come in we've had a few Apostles not many but when they come in they always strengthen the body of Jesus Christ a lot of deceivers say we only have a one-man Ministry and that's a live course the Bible's pling we need a five full ministry so one man cannot do it all Paul say it up as a fful Ministry the next reason I'm a message believer is because of the spirit-led worship Services no doubt I enjoyed some services at the Assembly of God and of course the chapel but when I came to the message the services were the most biblical the Holy Ghost could move during the song service the Holy Ghost could move before service that happened numerous times the Holy Ghost would move during the preaching the Holy Ghost would move after the preaching as we pray and wait on the Lord most sermons are an hour hour and a half some go to to 2 hours some longer when the Holy Ghost is there those 2hour sermons just feel like a few minutes there's spirit-led worship fiery worship fiery prayers the first love of the Holy Ghost is on display in our lives there's forceful preaching there's confession of sins there's deliverance from bondage and so the greatest Services I've ever experienced have been in message churches and I thank the Lord Jesus Christ for that an eighth reason I'm a message believer is because of the prophetic Ministry of God's prophet William brandham before I came to the message I didn't know anything about prophets but as soon as I started studying the Bible I could easily see brother brandham was a genuine prophet of God I have numerous videos about this also chapter 13 of my 2021 book I fully explain the bible-based ministry of God's Prophet brother William brandham I have 30 thus sayith the Lord's statements in that chapter chapter 13 proving without a shadow of a doubt brother Brandon was a genuine prophet of God read recently I put out a video with six undeniable thus sayith the Lord prophecies that have come to pass through God's Prophet brother William brandom I've met two people who knew brother brandham and were discerned by the prophetic gift in brother bram's life the Holy Ghost is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of our hearts and that prophetic gift that gift of discernment was in brother brandom's life and Ministry it is undeniable brother brandom gives us the wonderful balance of a prophet everything a prophet says with thus sayith the Lord is infallible but outside of that a prophet is just as human as anyone else brother Ram tells us God doesn't tell us prophets everything a prophet's not infallible just with his own opinions brother Braham told us to be very careful to separate his human opinions from his prophetic Ministry and he said it's so easy to know the prophetic ministry will always say in the name of the Lord or thus sayith the Lord also have a video about all the future Prophecies of brother brandham and of course brother bram's accusers have a falsely accused them of having false prophecies that is not true I have an entire video about some of the common misunderstood thus sayi the Lord statements of brother Brandon please watch this video called the brown bear Vision there are 10 Bible examples of how prophets and Men of God either disobeyed a vision a thus sayith the Lord from God or a thus sayith the Lord changed like in the case of Isaiah and Hezekiah so all these accusers of brother brandham most of them are not preachers most of them are not called to rightly divide the word so of course they can't understand the word of God they just have an evil spirit anointing them to slander God's true Prophet brother brandham and of course I continue to pray for their full repentance and a final reason I love being a message believer is because this message identifies the Bride of Jesus Christ I mentioned this earlier but the Bible says according to Jesus in Matthew 25 there's wise and foolish Christians the wise Christians do the full will of God they have the baptism of the the Holy Ghost in their souls so as message Believers we believe in all the power of the Holy Ghost all the truth of the Holy Ghost and we preach the same gospel that Paul preached Paul said in Galatians 1 you're cursed if you change anything about Paul's gospel well we believe we have the Revelation the full revelation of Paul's gospel restored to us and I believe that with all my heart in my 2021 book in chapter 4 I show how we are the true bride of Jesus Christ there's proof in there that our message churches who have the Holy Ghost are the true bride of Jesus Christ I show 14 Pauling doctrines that most churches reject such as the true Revelation on the godhead the water baptism Holiness modesty men preachers only and so many other truths in Romans 2:16 Paul said we'll be judged by his gospel and I'm so thankful that the gospel of St Paul from the Lord Jesus Christ is cleansing Our Lives now and so there will be no condemnation for us on that day as Romans 8 says all other churches as far as I know break some of Paul's teachings but our message churches are the only ones that keep all of Paul's commands now of course we're not perfect but by the grace of God the Holy Ghost is guiding us into all truth much more could be said but I think I'm going to stop right there by God's grace hope you enjoyed this Summary of why I'm a message believer if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
