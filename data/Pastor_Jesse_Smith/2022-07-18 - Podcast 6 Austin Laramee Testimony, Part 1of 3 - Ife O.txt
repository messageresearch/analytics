TRANSCRIPT
========================================
through my sickness darkness jesus you got me through my addiction depression [Music] i am grateful that you thought of me and if right where i am is right where you are then i'm right where i'm supposed to be god bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith and here's our other co-host i'm amen on today's podcast we're going to look at a testimony of one of the believers in our church named brother austin we felt burdened to share people's testimonies because we know we'll be the help to other people the bible says in revelation chapter 12 we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimonies so hopefully in the next few episodes we can get more testimonies of some of the saints in the church and post them on podcasts so that people can listen and be encouraged and we know every time that we talk about jesus sing about jesus think about jesus he comes near and the bible says wherever two or three are gathered there i am in the midst of you so we know talking about jesus testifying of jesus it blesses everybody and it brings the presence of the lord and so we're assured that brother austin's testimony will be a great blessing to you today so let's get into his life and see how the message of jesus christ has made a tremendous difference in fact has made all the difference in his life we'd also like to give a warning here at the beginning of this podcast that this episode has a lot of mature content so we do not recommend children listen to this episode our brother austin has a powerful testimony because god reached down and rescued him out of a life of despair even from the beginning of his life because austin was conceived in an act of rape and then grew up in a home full of domestic violence and drug abuse so during this podcast you'll hear different drugs mentioned such as alcohol cigarettes marijuana lsd hallucinogens vicodin xanax acid and also the selling of drugs you'll also hear that that austin's high school had students who would bring guns to school and of course as christians we do not support drug abuse domestic violence or any other gun violence but we felt it was an important part of austin's testimony showing how god's hand reached down to him in the depths of despair and rescued him transforming his life completely by the renewing of his mind according to romans 12 verses 1 and 2. we felt some of these details from austin's life would help certain individuals who have been trapped in drug abuse or domestic violence and his testimony would give them hope that god never leaves nor forsakes anyone and god is rich in mercy and mighty to save anyone who calls upon the name of the lord jesus christ we also hope you'll listen all the way to the end and you'll hear austin sing a song about this particular aspect of his testimony the lord gave him a song called right where i'm supposed to be and in the song austin talks about overcoming depression and suicidal thoughts and the song magnifies the grace of our lord jesus christ to rescue him save his soul and lead him into paths of righteousness for god's name's sake you heard a small portion of this song at the beginning of the podcast as well and with that we'll get started god bless you bro awesome great that you're here with us okay we're gonna start with the first question what was your childhood like in relation to learning about jesus hey uh god bless the listeners of this podcast um my childhood in relation to learning about jesus uh i grew up not really really super religious um i kind of went to church just a bit as a kid i went to baptist church i didn't really take it serious i was kind of there just for the candy for real and the fun stuff they would do you know my mom and dad didn't really push god on me at all growing up so i didn't i didn't really have any opinion about god or any true knowledge of jesus like my church as a kid kind of just taught me that once you're saved you're always saved just you know i remember a day in church they were like do you want to accept jesus into your heart and i was just like yeah and they're like all right let's pray and they're like pretty much just told me that if i just am sincere in his prayer that i accept jesus into my heart and then i'm saved and now i'm going to heaven no matter what now is what they told me you know i'm i'm saved i'm a believer now so i walked away from that i was like okay i was like cool i'm going to heaven now you know no matter what and i'm saved was my candy so you know i just so i didn't really go to church that much as a kid it was just a little bit but i went on my own accord though like i guess my mom told me i would just tell her i wanted to go to church randomly i just started going sometimes but so yeah pretty minimal minimal knowledge of jesus growing up as a at least a small child you said something there really important brother that most churches teach that salvation is only one work of grace they teach as soon as you say a sinner's prayer a scripted prayer they teach that you're saved sanctified filled with the holy ghost born again full of the power of god and yet that's a huge heir and i recently preached on that well i think last year i preached on that and the holy spirit just really brought that to my attention like that is an awful false doctrine and you experienced that i would say i experienced a similar thing when they when i was in assemblies of god and they told me to say jesus over and over again until i blabbered some words out and then everybody rejoiced like i got the holy ghost but i didn't i was crying i was emotional because of all the loud prayers but then i stuck a sucker back in my mouth and ran back outside to play baseball or whatever sport i was going to do so i just thought i would share that for our listeners to know that the churches most churches are preaching a watered-down doctrine and a scripted prayer doesn't change the heart it's when a heart really repents that's when the heart gets changed yeah i remember when i was learning about jesus in the church and when we would pray the prayer meant absolutely nothing to me as a kid like there was no emotion tied to it it was like a empty prayer you know just i was just saying words you know i was like i was just reading a book that i didn't like or something it was just it meant nothing like this emptiness i had no i was just saying it basically to get candy so and i believed it enough to keep going to church you know i believe jesus was real but he wasn't real to me by the church didn't make him real to me and they just didn't explain anything i would i was always confused you know sunday school was complete they just taught the basics god loves you jesus died for your sins but they didn't tell me how to repent or what repentance is or what even sin really is you know or they didn't really teach me anything you know i just learned the basics like god is good he loves you uh don't sin you're saved you're going to heaven that's it i was just like okay and as a kid you know not really going through a lot of things anyways uh i had really no need for jesus you know i was pretty happy kid for the most part so i just you know it's it wasn't real to me until later on in my life so i'd be pretty much my childhood was just pretty much lacking lacking real knowledge of jesus amen can you share that experience where your mom said you woke up and you talked about going back to heaven oh yeah that's crazy yeah uh i guess when i was like two years old um yeah this is real young yeah this is way back i was two years old and my mom said that i came out of my room at like three four in the morning one day and i and i just middle of the night just woke up out of my sleep and went to the living room and and looked at her and told her that god told me i was from the stars and that when i'm a teen he's gonna take me back home so from that point you know i don't know how old i was my mom first told me that but i remember not believing her you know and she said she wrote it down in her journal somewhere you know and like so my whole life she was just super overprotective of me especially when i turned 13 you know because teen you know so so you thought i was gonna die she took that as you know i was gonna die because you know it sounds like if god's gonna take you home you're gonna you know you're going back to heaven you know so she thought i was gonna die so super protective and long story short we'll get to the the journey but long story short short when i turned 19 i was introduced to the message you know and that's when i really got the knowledge of god and like amazing amazing story on how i even found the message so yeah so it's like a prophet prophecy you know early on in my life that came true one of many it's pretty crazy yeah pretty crazy prophetic thing that happened there it's almost like a prophecy for your life yeah so coming from the stars makes it sound like coming from heaven or coming from the mind of god and ephesians chapter 1 says we were chosen in christ before the foundation of the world and actually abraham's seed is likened unto the stars god told abraham your seed is going to be like the stars the number of stars that they are so that's a very spiritual dream there and then going back home home would represent heaven or going back to the mind of god or coming back to god's original plan for your life right that's what that was too it wasn't death it was life amen hallelujah beautiful do you want to share about some of the mental things like just in general terms yeah i went through a lot of things mentally as a kid really like physically everything was kind of all right but mentally i mean it all started i mean at birth already i was already beating odds right like it goes hand in hand with being from the stars because at birth my mom was raped so and she kept me and the doctors told her she only had a 25 chance of ever even having a kid so when you know when she was pregnant she kept me you know and she feared that she wouldn't love me but she said as soon as she had me she fell in love so that was good and then so already off the bat you know that's like god's ordaining everything in my life so but growing up you know it was pretty pretty crazy in my house you know like outside i was kind of like a happy kid but inside i had a lot of demons i was battling from long as i can remember really so there's a lot of my stepdad was around since before i can remember and he was a crazy alcoholic he did drugs and stuff too he used to beat my mom you know they'd be arguing almost i don't know every night i can remember in my childhood there was a bad terrible argument in my house like terrible i mean it's not your average argument you know it's terrible things i just remember being scared all the time as a kid i remember somewhere along the lines getting a sense that i needed to protect my mom like as young as five years old probably i remember having to feel like i need to protect my mom and stuff and always being obsessed with like keeping my mom safe which a normal you know normal kid is that's not their first priority you know i mean everybody every kid's like oh i love my mom i love my dad but this was like a deeper need to save my mom you know protect my mom uh it's probably because of what was going on you know i saw what my dad was doing i felt helpless you know but then since he was my dad i thought i had to respect him and i thought this was normal you know i would i would think that all people were going through this at home you know so i just i didn't really talk about it with nobody and i always felt embarrassed sometimes because we were always a family on the street like the arguments would be so bad you would hear them you could hear them all the way down the street like you hear my parents yelling i was always that kid with the parents so oh it's your parents are yelling again you know so it's kind of embarrassing growing up so we were like that crazy family on the neighborhood you know yeah so it was like that so i used to always just uh i became like very sheltered and i never talked about my issues or nothing i just pretended i like everything was okay growing up never really was vocalizing anything to anybody you know i just held it all in because i just thought it was normal so i'm just like oh this is something everybody just got to go through you know it's nothing you know so it just made me like super depressed but i i had i feel like i had depression as a kid but i just didn't know i did you know because i'm too young to realize like i definitely had anxiety as a kid but i didn't know it as anxiety back then and then uh i used to have flashbacks or just i remember always trying to be a peacemaker with my parents because like i could sense the tension so i would always try to do things to be like oh just keep their minds off of arguing you know drinking and stuff and and so they're always drinking a lot you know there's a lot of alcohol lots of alcohol i hated alcohol as a kid i used to throw beers away tell my parents to stop drinking it was just this begging hated alcohol yeah it was like that all the way until high school graduated high school even like it was my whole whole childhood since i could remember it was just violence just utter violence really i mean the worst arguments you can imagine dude is terrible i could literally hear right now my head my dad yelling is terrible sick it's a shame i have to remember him like that but i forgive him you know but evil there was one word for my childhood i was happy at the same time mentally it was also sad like it was evil my childhood was evil but it was also very happy i can't ex sounds confusing man but i was a super happy kid but it was also when i had to go through that it was just terrible like i literally would be scared i'll be crying i will get up go hide in corners i remember my dad got me a dog he got a dog one time that helped me a lot it was probably like you were happy all day except for when the arguments would start yeah yeah it would be bad it would just wake me up in the middle of night sometimes you know just stuff throwing breaking all the time plates glasses and stuff and like sometimes i would like you know hide some of my toys because i didn't want them to be broke you know or i would i would like try to try to hide under my blankets you know and just ignore it i'll be scared you know and always always be so scared i remember uh so when he got me my dog i finally felt like i wasn't alone because it's like my dog got scared too my dog would literally when it happened he would literally like be shaking crying in the corner too so i i felt like i had a friend you know there was one time my parents you know were divorced when i was i think in seventh grade there was one time my parents were arguing and my dad that night he never did it except for this one night he went and bought some beer and he got drunk and i i remember watching them and he took his hand and he knocked down all these glass jars and i just i can still i can still see it i can still hear the glass you know i was just like i was shocked um that's really the only time though that i saw that to that degree so i can i can kind of you know understand a little bit you know just a little bit about that but just the impression that it has upon a child now this will be important later on because we'll see how the blood of jesus christ right operates in your life and so instead of taking on the traits of your stepfather you take upon the traits of a christian right and that's the power of the gospel amen so then when when did you finally encounter god and finally surrender to jesus all right so it's a good question so it leads you know so coming out of that childhood you know i get to high school in ninth grade i start you know you're a young you're a young dude you're in high school you're you're introduced to all these new things you know new crowds of people and i finally get my little crowd i get into skateboarding real hard it's just ways i would just i was super i would never be home really i would always be out and about skating with my friends just never trying to be home i hated being at home and i was not very close to my parents at this point in my life i barely talked you know i wasn't like i felt like my parents didn't even know the real me because i was so i didn't talk about anything you know and i just kind of shut out everything in the world like i just pretended nothing existed that was bad so it was like eventually it all caved in later in my life but uh so my whole it feels like my whole life i've held everything in so high school i start high school you know and i i start off really good half my year i'm really good you know some of my friends they'll start smoking weed and stuff you know doing cigarettes all that drinking but half halfway through freshman year i'm still the kid in the group that was just like i was scared i was i'll be scared to hang out with some of my friends after school because i just didn't want them to be like hey try this because i want to be the lame kid they'll be like oh i'm not going to do it you know you know how peer pressure and all that trying to be cool and none of that really matters but in high school it's so important to you so i'll be scared to hang out with my friends after school because i thought they were reckless but i really liked them you know and and they're a pretty good crowd good cool crowd like good values not like really bad kids it's just you don't think they're just smoking weed instead just doing things reckless like rebellious teenagers but i remember one day like halfway through my freshman year i remember like a week i was just thinking like all right i'm gonna try smoking weed man i started getting into music really like music was always very important to me and my stepdad was a musician too so i grew up around music a lot it was very important to me i like would find therapy through music i played music my whole life but i started really taking it serious in high school and started making beats like producing and all that and i i one i was just thinking about trying weed you know because i'm i'm just like all right i'm gonna try it and one morning i remember i woke up getting ready for school and there was a joint sitting on my table in my living room and i was like well this is it so i took the joint i laid it up smoked it on the way to school and then i went to school first period class and i looked at my friend you know one of my friend his name was jared i looked at him and i was like dude i just smoked weed for the first time i was like i found one of my dad's joints he must have forgot and left it on the table and i smoked it and he was like no he didn't really believe me i was like yeah you don't i always remember laughing the whole class and thinking it was awesome you know i'm just high so here we are i'm going through high school that was my first introduction to drugs you know and so i start that was like my first relief i'm like oh i don't feel this pain anymore i didn't realize i was depressed even in high school or had anxiety i didn't know what it was at that point but i just knew i didn't feel that weird feeling i was always feeling you know i could talk now i could i could laugh you know i could i could be a personality again you know and so i started music sounded really good so i started smoking a lot you know i started i was like oh i got to get this started doing smoking a lot of weed hanging out with my friends outside of school now i'm like you know joining them smoking weed i started drinking a bit but i didn't really like drinking because of my childhood i kind of didn't really get into drinking through high school just other things but sophomore year comes you know i'm still i'm still smoking weed but then i get introduced i start doing vicodin start doing xanax you know we just pills would come and i would just take them i start studying drugs because i just become infatuated with with mind altering substances and what they did to you so i just became infatuated with it so i just wanted to try everything so because i didn't feel anything anymore so i started doing lots of pills i started taking pills from my mom and she would think that the pharmacy was messing up but it was really me and and and i would go along with the lie i would disagree yeah the pharmacy you know they're probably messing your pills up is terrible like because i was so ashamed of what i was doing going in her purse taking her pills and stuff but i was just sometimes i would take her boxed wine and literally just to go to school i would have to chug like three glasses of wine just to go because i hated i was so depressed hated going to school i got bullied a lot sometimes because i was weird you know i was just that weird kid like everybody liked but also hated it it was weird like everybody hated me and liked me at the same time i didn't get it but it's because i was different like i wasn't scared to speak my mind so i would skip school a lot my life started really kind of falling apart in high school yeah so sophomore year i introduced i started taking lsd a lot of hallucigenics you know start taking acid i would take it in in class and i would tell my teachers you know like what i'm on what i'm seeing and it was like a really really really ghetto high school like i mean people had guns and stuff like people my friends would bring guns to school all the time like be showing me their guns in the bathroom like so it was like a really bad school you know my teachers would let me literally smoke because i was actually really smart in high school i got really good grades and then they saw me as smart but it's just i just didn't apply myself i was just like the outcast kind of person you know but i was always kind to everybody because i was just sad so uh and i hated when other people weren't kind to people because i would get bullied sometimes you know i was just weird you know so see i started taking lsd drinking more having parties you know just kicking it really hard i tried a lot of drugs but not really hard drugs until after high school so i get senior year you know and i i finally graduate with merit royal too my gosh chris has my merit role i graduate and literally and mind you this whole time my parents are still arguing drinking it's a wreck at home i hated going home i hated going i dreaded going home and i would always be high too and i was scared to tell my parents so i'll just go straight to my room sometimes or just not even come home until i'm completely sober and then i'll come home and just tell them oh good night going to sleep now wake up the next day and then yeah get high so so i graduate and boom literally probably a couple weeks after i graduate my dad gets a dui so he's he finally he's like all right i'm going to stop drinking da da i have a problem finally admits it and then literally a couple days after that dui he literally comes home super drunk and i just went off on them and i kicked them out i was like i'm done with this like i just kicked him out of the house but then you know we couldn't afford the bills literally like i was like oh man my mom was super mad at me but also not mad at the same time like because she was just battling you know how it is being abusive really you love the person but then it's not her fault but so after i kicked him out realized we couldn't really pay the bills so i had my friends move in for my friend matt my friend spencer and from that point my childhood home that house turned into a straight trap house i mean just my mom was super depressed so she stopped caring about anything i i didn't care about anything we just started doing all types of drugs started selling drugs out of the house had all types of people in all all through the night all the time while my mom was literally just in the back super sad drinking not even talking to anybody sometimes or just kicking it with us sometimes you know and then uh this is where everything fell apart i mean this is like the climax this is 2016 now i graduated 2015. this is 2016. we were doing that for like six months and it's not sustainable at this point anymore it gets real bad i mean it was a whole bunch of stuff going on in that house and then my mom started talking to this guy and mind you she was with my dad for like 18 19 years abusive relationship meant mainly the whole time and she had maybe been not with him at this point for a couple months met this guy started talking to him and she moved in with him within like two months and just kind of left us all at this house a little bit i mean she said i could go with them you know and live there but i didn't really want to i'm like nah i wasn't for it i was like mom what are you doing i didn't like nobody because i didn't trust anybody so i was just mean to the guy at first so eventually things came to an end we lost the house you know and this is six months after i graduated we lost the house and i was homeless i remember i would just go downtown akron you know just like sleep in parking decks and while all that happened i started i picked up guitar and i started just teaching myself how to play guitar i mean i was so depressed i was sitting in my room for hours straight i mean like eight nine hours straight until my fingers bleeding just learning how to play guitar i'm gonna start learning how to sing because people told me i could sing i didn't believe in myself though but i knew i loved music so i would go downtown and i remember i was being hungry and i would go and i told myself i would never beg that i had a talent god-given talent and and around this point i started kind of questioning god again i was an atheist through high school because i'm like god can't be real i just went through complete uh terror my whole life i'm like there's no god like there's no god i didn't believe in god anymore i was like no so i remember one i would go into restaurants and i would play music and ask them if they like my song if i could just have a sandwich in exchange for me playing and most of the time all the time they gave me a sandwich you know i don't know if i was out of pity or if they really liked my music but it was cool but one night i was sleeping in a parking deck and i was tired i was about to go home i was i was gonna walk home back to my house that we just lost my childhood home that i grew up in i was gonna break into it and sleep in it because i wanted to sleep on carpet so i remember in the parking deck i just was like all right i just got down on my knees and i just prayed how i knew how to pray i never learned but i just prayed from the heart i was i don't even remember what i said but i was like god i was like if you're real why am i going through this can you reveal yourself to me i was like just show me your real because i if there's any point i need you i need you now i was like i'm 19 years old going through i feel like i was like going through the worst thing any 19 year old has ever been through even though i know my struggles are probably nothing compared to other struggles but it's just for me personally it was the hardest thing ever so i pray that prayer i'm just like god show yourself to me please anyway just show me that you're real so i ended it with that i went to sleep i woke up and i remember the next day i would just you know just do my daily walks around downtown and then when it got around night time i was like all right i'm gonna walk four hours across akron to get back to my old house and i'm gonna go break in and sleep in it and halfway through my journey i walked into a burger king and i just wanted some water so i had my guitar on my back you know that's all i had to just my guitar and a little backpack full of couple clothes and i walk in just for a glass of water i wasn't even hungry and this guy comes from the back he's like hey man he's like he's like you play right and i was like i have a guitar in my back i play and then uh he's like he's showing me something so i'm like all right sure so i started singing him a song you know that i wrote and i ain't believing myself you know so when i saw people's reactions and that they were shocked that i could actually sing or whatever i would be shocked i'm like oh you actually thought that was good i'm like oh man like i was like you really think that's good and he was like just jaw-dropped shocked so he was like man he was like where are you going i'm just trying to get home man i got to walk four hours he was like here's some bus money so i took the bus money went outside crossed the street waited for the bus it was supposed to come at midnight never came for some reason i don't know why i didn't come so i walked back into burger king and i gave him his money back and then he was just shocked that i walked in and gave his money back he was like you just came in here and gave me my money back i'm and i told him i'm like yeah man the bus didn't come so you know you gave me the money so here you go and he's like you know nobody would do that he was like what he's like so i guess that was a big thing for him you know that for me it was just regular because that's just why i like i didn't think that was a big deal basically he asked something i basically led to like i'm homeless you know i was actually just gonna go break into my old house so i could just sleep that i got tired of sleeping in parking deck so he told me he was like all right man look he started showing me that he does music you know that he has all these connections or whatever but just trying to show me that you could trust i guess i didn't trust him at all though but i was like i was an opportunist and i loved the adventure of life so i was just like all right i didn't trust nobody but he told me he was like listen you could stay in my house tonight you stay in my house i'm gonna have my brother meet you at the bus station so he met me at the bus station i walked there met his brother went to his house he got off at like 2 a.m that night he got home told me he just got out of prison from four years three weeks ago and showed me his music but long story short he told me that his grandfather was a preacher and then him and his brother started talking about a guy named william branham and he was like did you know we had a prophet and i'm like oh we don't got no prophets you know it's ancient stuff like all these guys are in a cult you know so started telling me about about this church you know and this thing called the message and i was like huh it's weird and then a couple couple days later in comes pastor jesse smith right and i remember the first conversation i had the first sentence he said i remember in my head i was like if there's any guy that's close to god it's this man right here that i've ever met in my life it's this guy and then i was like okay god i'm like is this you answering my prayer because i mean the way i just met this random stranger just let me live in this house and from then on we became like brothers like him his brother and me like brothers still talk to this day and i lived with him for months at this point he helped me get on my feet taught me how to drive you know helped me learn a lot of street street knowledge you know and like taught me a lot a lot of things about life about music he was the first person besides my parents and my friends that really believed in me that told me you're gonna be you know a good singer you're gonna be this and i didn't believe in myself i didn't believe him but i still kept pushing on and now now you know i believe in myself in a godly way not pridefully but just like i accept i have a gift and i could sing and play so after i met brother jesse that's when you know i didn't believe it at first i thought it was a cult my mom thought i was in a cult because i've never heard none of this but i guess that's when i finally was really introduced to jesus and that's when i first developed my real relationship and i entered the message and then i repented got baptized you know i heard all this stuff and i was like yep that's god answering my prayer i'm like there it is i was like you're real so i believed it ever since and that was that was how i really got introduced to jesus that's how i needed him yeah but it took a long road of pain to get me to that point so that's how it happened that's how i was introduced to this message okay we're ending our first part on this testimony as there's many more stories we want to hear from our austin and we're going to quit the second part in our next podcast and we want to thank you guys for listening to this first part as we close we want to play a song brother austin was given by the lord recently that he sang as a song special at a recent church service in deploying ohio and it's called right where i'm supposed to be i know it'll be a blessing to you god bless you and may jesus christ anoint you to defend the message okay cool cool hey god bless god bless you guys hey um so i'm the lord gave me this song um actually
