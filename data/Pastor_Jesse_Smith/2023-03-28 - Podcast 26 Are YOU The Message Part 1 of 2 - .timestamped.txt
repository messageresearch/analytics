[0:03] [Music]
[0:11] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:13] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:15] co-host Pastor Jesse Smith our other
[0:17] co-host brother amen wasn't available
[0:19] for this recording but I want to update
[0:22] you on his health he's doing much better
[0:23] by God's grace he went back to work
[0:25] yesterday and he and I are texting back
[0:28] and forth deciding on a subject that we
[0:30] can record together hopefully the next
[0:33] few weeks by God's grace so thank you
[0:34] for your prayers
[0:35] today's episode focuses on answering the
[0:38] question are you the message
[0:40] I believe the answer is no
[0:42] this episode originates from two recent
[0:45] sermons I listened to wherein prominent
[0:48] preachers told agreeing congregations
[0:51] that they were the message here's the
[0:54] outline for this podcast first we'll
[0:56] look at a message definition is
[0:58] essential
[1:00] second will Define the message third
[1:02] we'll look at bible uses of the word
[1:04] message fourth we'll look at four
[1:07] foundational quotes that help us Define
[1:09] the message and fifth we'll look at the
[1:12] written Epistles question
[1:15] foreign
[1:19] so the first section is a message
[1:21] definition is essential friends the
[1:24] following understanding or truths about
[1:26] what is the message are essential to
[1:28] abiding in the truth they're essential
[1:31] to staying in the middle of the road and
[1:33] that's what this podcast is about
[1:34] finding the truth within two dangerous
[1:37] fringes of those who follow brother
[1:39] branham's bible-based message
[1:42] if not understood correctly a message
[1:44] believer will likely Wander from the
[1:46] path of righteousness and walk on the
[1:48] dangerous fringes of the message which
[1:51] are
[1:52] first the dangerous Fringe of being a
[1:54] tape worshiper or a messenger worshiper
[1:57] and of course this is The Fringe of
[1:59] idolatry of brother Branham and idolatry
[2:02] of brother random's tapes and of course
[2:04] we see this movement in Jeffersonville
[2:06] Indiana today and all their followers
[2:09] which is very sad movement
[2:11] the second dangerous Fringe is preacher
[2:14] or self-worship and I call this the
[2:17] bride Pride group of preachers
[2:20] this is the group of preachers that call
[2:22] themselves The Greatest Christians of
[2:24] all time and last year I made a video
[2:26] about this quoting living preachers
[2:28] today constantly saying they are the
[2:31] greatest Christians of all time calling
[2:33] one another their Heroes and of course
[2:36] this is the same camp of preachers that
[2:39] told their congregants they are the
[2:41] message
[2:42] now two reasons this topic is so
[2:44] important is because number one we are
[2:46] commanded to understand and grow in
[2:48] understanding
[2:49] and judge all things and second the
[2:53] Antichrist spirit is so close it must be
[2:55] detected and exposed by the gift of
[2:58] discernment now regarding understanding
[3:00] twice Paul prayed for us to have all
[3:02] understanding in Colossians 1 verse 9.
[3:05] Paul said he did not cease to pray for
[3:07] the Colossians to the desire that ye
[3:10] might be filled with the knowledge of
[3:11] his will in all wisdom and spiritual
[3:13] understanding
[3:15] and in second Timothy 2 verse 7 Paul
[3:17] wrote and the Lord give the
[3:19] understanding in all things and then
[3:21] twice Paul prayed for us to judge All
[3:24] Things First Corinthians 1 verse 10
[3:28] Paul said it by the name of our Lord
[3:29] Jesus Christ that ye all speak the same
[3:32] thing
[3:33] and that there be no divisions among you
[3:35] but that should be perfectly joined
[3:37] together in the same mind and in the
[3:39] same judgment
[3:40] in Philippians 1 verses 9 and 10 Paul
[3:43] prayed that your love may abound yet
[3:45] more and more in knowledge and in all
[3:48] judgment
[3:49] and I think I'll add a third verse First
[3:50] Corinthians 2 verses 14 through 16 but
[3:54] focusing on verse 15 but he that is
[3:56] spiritual judgeth all things
[3:58] and as I close this section remember we
[4:01] must always look at the context of the
[4:03] quote from Brother Branham that we're
[4:05] studying and also the quotes from
[4:07] Brother Joseph Branham or myself or any
[4:10] other preacher and then we have to look
[4:11] at the words that follow after because
[4:14] Jesus said people's words will tell what
[4:16] is in their hearts according to Matthew
[4:17] 12 34 Jesus said for out of the
[4:21] abundance of the heart the mouth
[4:22] speaketh so again defining the message
[4:24] is essential to keep us in the middle of
[4:27] the road so we don't go into brother
[4:28] Branham worship nor go into worship of
[4:31] ourselves we're commanded to have more
[4:33] understanding constantly growing and
[4:35] understanding and judgment
[4:39] thank you
[4:42] in this second section let's define the
[4:45] message we must establish a basic
[4:47] definition for the word message
[4:50] and I'd like to use Webster's Dictionary
[4:52] just like brother Branham used Webster's
[4:54] dictionary to define his words such as
[4:57] for the word absolute in other words so
[5:00] Webster's Dictionary defines message as
[5:02] any notice word or communication written
[5:05] or verbal sent from one person to
[5:07] another
[5:08] now from this definition we apply in two
[5:10] contexts the first context is someone
[5:13] brought a word or message to us
[5:16] we get a message or word of God from a
[5:19] messenger about the current conditions
[5:22] we are not both the message and the
[5:24] receiver we are receivers only we are a
[5:28] separate person from the sender and then
[5:30] yet in a spiritual sense our souls have
[5:33] a portion of the sender Spirit after we
[5:36] are born again now the second context is
[5:40] now that brother random is gone we share
[5:42] God's message or word with others
[5:45] but we are not both the message which is
[5:48] the word and the sender we are not
[5:51] sending ourselves
[5:53] also brother Brown never said the words
[5:54] I am the message nor did he say you are
[5:57] the message
[5:58] when we look at the Bible Paul shared
[6:00] the message and the briens checked
[6:03] Paul's message with scripture
[6:05] that's found in Acts 17 11. these were
[6:08] more noble than those in thessalonica
[6:10] and that they received the word of God
[6:12] with all Readiness in mind and search
[6:14] the scriptures daily whether those
[6:15] things were so also in first
[6:17] Thessalonians 2 verse 13 Paul said the
[6:20] thessalonicans receive the word of God
[6:23] which he heard of us you received it not
[6:25] as the word of men but as it is in truth
[6:27] the word of God
[6:30] I believe this false statement of you
[6:32] are the message is an attack on Holy
[6:34] Ghost reasoning and logic how can I be
[6:37] both the message between two persons and
[6:41] the receiver of the message I can't be
[6:43] both the statement of you are the
[6:45] message lacks intelligent reasoning
[6:48] language must keep its meaning
[6:51] I can become one with a message in my
[6:54] soul I can spread the message with my
[6:56] words I can carry the message in my
[6:59] hands when I'm carrying the Bible
[7:01] because the Bible is a physical form of
[7:03] the message but I'm never the full
[7:04] message itself friends if we say we are
[7:07] the message like these preachers are
[7:09] saying we are doing the same thing
[7:10] trinitarians do when they change the
[7:13] meaning of language with the word person
[7:15] let's listen to brother Rams say this
[7:17] from the church age book he said
[7:19] trinitarians change the meaning of the
[7:21] word person by calling God three persons
[7:24] let's listen to the quote they also
[7:26] state
[7:28] Bible is not
[7:29] person but
[7:31] on God
[7:34] Trinity
[7:35] it sure is how can three persons be in
[7:38] one God
[7:39] not only is there no Bible for it but it
[7:42] shows even a lack of intelligent
[7:43] reasoning three distinct persons though
[7:46] identical substance make three gods or
[7:49] language has lost its meaning entirely
[7:52] friends it's also necessary and
[7:54] interesting to see how the Bible uses
[7:56] the word message what is the message
[7:58] according to the Bible the Bible says we
[8:00] have to prove all things take every
[8:02] statement back to the word of God now I
[8:05] found two Bible verses about the message
[8:07] and it caused the message two things
[8:09] first
[8:10] it caused the message God is light and
[8:13] in him is no darkness and this reminds
[8:15] us of the scripture we must walk in the
[8:17] light of our day in first John chapter
[8:19] one and this definition is also in first
[8:21] John 1 verse 5 it says this then is the
[8:24] message which ye have heard of him and
[8:26] declare unto you that God is light and
[8:28] in him is no Darkness at all and then
[8:31] the second definition of what the
[8:32] message is is also from First John 3
[8:35] verse 11 it's love one another First
[8:39] John 3 11 says for this is the message
[8:40] that you have heard from the beginning
[8:42] that we should love one another
[8:44] so friends search it in your Bible the
[8:47] Bible never says you are the message and
[8:50] remember friends it's a sin to add to
[8:51] the word of God according to proverbs 30
[8:54] verses 5 and 6 and Revelation chapter 22
[8:57] verses 18 and 19. one time wait a
[9:00] Minister's meeting on this very subject
[9:01] and when it was my turn to speak the
[9:03] first scripture I used was haggai 1
[9:05] verse 13. it says then spake haggai the
[9:09] Lord's messenger in the Lord's message
[9:11] unto the people saying I'm with you
[9:13] saith the Lord now friends this is
[9:15] another beautiful Bible definition of
[9:17] the message all of God's prophetic word
[9:20] to Israel during the time of Haggin
[9:22] Zechariah was the Lord's message but
[9:25] haggai was one voice in The Lord's
[9:27] message and that's because Zechariah was
[9:30] also speaking in the Lord's message and
[9:32] this is what brother random tells us
[9:34] brother Branham of course was the main
[9:36] speaker of the message but then he said
[9:38] he was only one Pebble on the beach of
[9:41] the fivefold ministry and brother random
[9:43] said the bride has a voice the bride has
[9:46] to spread and share the message as well
[9:48] with her own voice let's listen to the
[9:50] quotes no brother Branham is it true
[9:53] that no one should preach but you
[9:58] we have seen
[10:01] your we have seen you are deemed man we
[10:06] do don't believe you would do that if
[10:09] there were not that they were not to
[10:12] preach
[10:13] Mercy brother sister ever who told you
[10:17] that nobody's preached with me you're
[10:18] not sure if you have four subjects of
[10:19] gods with all that no every manner that
[10:24] feels a call of God upon his life get
[10:27] into the ministry start preaching we
[10:29] need them
[10:31] man of God or anointed all over the
[10:33] world to preach the gospel see I'm just
[10:36] one little Pebble on the beach among
[10:38] many big stones for
[10:40] so there's just many there's more
[10:43] eligible more worthy more of anything to
[10:46] preach than me I'm just one little
[10:49] humble person laying out here I'm one
[10:52] grain of wheat in a whole Garner see so
[10:55] it's just uh you know what I mean any
[10:58] man is called a God he's the preacher
[11:00] gospel
[11:01] now in this next quote from the church
[11:03] age book brother Rams says the world
[11:05] will hear direct from God as at
[11:08] Pentecost through the bride for the
[11:10] voice of God will be in her the bride
[11:13] yes sir
[11:15] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[11:17] of God
[11:18] it is its own mouthpiece so God is
[11:21] turning on her he will confound her
[11:24] through the prophet and the bride for
[11:26] the voice of God will be in her
[11:28] yes it is for it says in the last
[11:30] chapter of Revelation verse 17.
[11:33] the spirit and the bride say come
[11:36] once more the world will hear direct
[11:38] from God as at Pentecost
[11:40] but of course that word bride will be
[11:42] repudiated as in the first stage
[11:45] now here's two quotes where brother
[11:46] Branham says you become the voice of God
[11:48] when you get in contact with God and
[11:51] then every believer can be God's voice
[11:52] when possessed or filled with the spirit
[11:54] of God
[12:00] and to think that if you get into that
[12:03] content with God it becomes to it isn't
[12:06] your voice anymore
[12:08] is that your thought anymore
[12:10] it becomes God's thought and God's voice
[12:14] [Applause]
[12:16] you are just Divine or just the branch
[12:18] he's divine
[12:21] I and my father are one
[12:24] that tree
[12:29] all right
[12:30] [Music]
[12:34] here
[12:37] that is
[12:47] persist
[12:49] ENT self essential completely given over
[12:52] to his words they come like the words of
[12:54] Christ
[12:55] who speaks
[12:57] and the word is made flesh he speaks and
[13:01] the word is manifested the works that I
[13:03] do shall you do also be these signs
[13:06] shall follow them and believe
[13:09] before moving on let's go back to
[13:11] Webster's definition of the word message
[13:12] it's any notice word or communication
[13:15] written or verbal sent from one person
[13:17] to another
[13:18] so the sender of the message is the Lord
[13:20] Jesus Christ who sits upon his Heavenly
[13:22] Throne at the right hand of the Majesty
[13:24] on high Jesus sent his word or message
[13:28] to brother Branham brother Brandon
[13:30] received Jesus message and then was the
[13:32] messenger of the message or the bible
[13:35] promises God wanted to fulfill in this
[13:37] church age we are receivers of the
[13:40] message or brother random scriptures he
[13:43] preached and manifested to the people
[13:44] and here are two quotes that support
[13:47] this brother Ram said the scriptures
[13:49] tell what my message is and notice he
[13:52] didn't say the tapes now of course I
[13:54] know the tapes contain many great
[13:56] scriptures brother random preached but
[13:57] the reason I'm saying that is because
[13:59] voice of God says every word on tape is
[14:01] thus say the Lord we know that's not the
[14:03] truth the Press Play movement and tape
[14:06] churches are tape worshipers they
[14:08] idolize brother Branham and of course
[14:10] that's a sin
[14:11] here's the first quote from recognizing
[14:13] your day in its message
[14:24] search the scriptures in them you think
[14:26] you have eternal life and they testify
[14:28] me
[14:29] and tell you what my message is
[14:32] if you can't believe me believe the very
[14:34] words that God's interpreted to you
[14:38] and the next quote is from a greater
[14:39] than Solomon is here
[14:41] brother Rams said his message is from
[14:43] the Bible and then he says it's not out
[14:45] of the Bible so notice again he didn't
[14:47] say my message is every word on the tape
[14:49] and you don't need the Bible he said his
[14:52] message is from the Bible let's listen
[14:54] to the quote
[14:57] I'm trying to bring this wonderful
[14:59] message of the grace of God
[15:06] that I know how to bring it it's the
[15:08] same message I've preached many years
[15:10] ago I haven't varied from it one inch
[15:13] because you can if I would have had to
[15:16] get out of the Bible
[15:17] see so it's from the Bible and I believe
[15:20] that in the beginning was the word and
[15:22] the Word was with God and the Word was
[15:25] God and the Word was made flesh and
[15:27] dwelt a moments amen and Hebrews 13 8
[15:30] says he's the same yesterday today and
[15:33] forever I believe that
[15:42] well friends will have to stop right
[15:43] here make this a part one of a series on
[15:46] asking the question are you the message
[15:48] so Lord willing next time we'll look at
[15:50] part four and five we'll look at four
[15:52] foundational quotes that help us Define
[15:54] the message and we'll also look at the
[15:56] question on written Epistles
[15:58] friends I'm really excited and I'm
[16:00] always thankful to defend this message
[16:01] that God gave to brother Branham and I
[16:03] know there are so many questions there
[16:05] are so many topics I'd like to cover
[16:06] there's just not enough hours in the day
[16:08] by God's grace but we know there's a
[16:10] time and season for everything and I
[16:12] just got to be patient and the Lord will
[16:14] help me bring out the truths that will
[16:16] Minister grace to the hearers so I'm
[16:18] purposely cutting this short so I can
[16:20] get this podcast out today I've just got
[16:22] a great burden to get content out
[16:24] because there's so many attacks on God's
[16:27] Bible message and God's Bible messenger
[16:30] brother Branham let's hope this is a
[16:32] blessing and thank you for your time
[16:33] thank you for downloading this and may
[16:35] the Lord Jesus Christ be with you now
[16:37] and always
[16:38] God bless you friends as the Holy Ghost
[16:40] anoints you to defend the Gospel of
[16:42] Jesus Christ as Paul also said in
[16:44] Philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing
[16:47] that I am set for the defense of the
[16:49] Gospel
[16:49] [Music]
[16:55] of Jesus Christ
[17:01] [Music]
[17:04] same Jesus that was yesterday and will
[17:07] defeat today and forever
[17:10] never fail
[17:12] [Music]
