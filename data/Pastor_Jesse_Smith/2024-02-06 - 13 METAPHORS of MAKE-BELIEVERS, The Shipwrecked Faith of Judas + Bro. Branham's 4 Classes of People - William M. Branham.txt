TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and that hope I anchor to the soul that's steadfast and sure in time of storm and when the storms come the Great Waves are rolling we feel that by faith in him we can caress every wave greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share an inspired Bible thought I had a few years ago about the 13 metaphors of the Judas Escape Group which is the make Believers group if you'd like to hear the full sermon on this it was from August 14th 2022 and friends this makeb believer group is a wonderful Bible teaching brother bandham showed he labored on it at length in the church age book but he also taught it numerous times during his lifetime during his regular Ministry during his ministry he called it three kinds of Believers but then in the church age book he said there's another class of Believers so we find there's two kinds of believers and then two kinds of unbelievers but first my name is Pastor Jesse Smith I'm pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio and I've been pastoring here for 17 years and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet brother William brandham and I also defend brother branham's Godly character so the inspiration from this video came of course from Brother branham's preaching and teaching about the three kinds of Believers then He adjusted it and said there was four classes of people in the church Church age book and this is in chapter 7 of the church age book The sardian Church age page 279 brother Ram talked about the bride being the first class of believer and then he said secondly there's another class these are the foolish virgins and Lord willing perhaps at some point I'll make a video on these four groups it's an extensive study it's fully taught in the scriptures it's most clearly seen in Jesus's parable of the four grounds from Matthew Chapter 13 but by God's grace let's look at this there's 13 met metaphors of the Judas es scarit group but of course as true believers we can take the positive application of these metaphors which we'll do at the end by God's grace and as you heard in the introduction brother Ram said a metaphor will crest every wave of life every storm of life that's a metaphor and a metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase literally denoting one kind of object or idea is used in place of another to suggest a likeness or analogy between them you might also call it a similary its figurative language so the figure is we're in a storm on the sea of life and will crest every wave we'll Crest every trial we'll make it through every trial by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ remember that Revelation 3:5 says Jesus says if you don't overcome he will blot out your name from The Book of Life of course this is what happened to Judas es scarat brother Ram said he was called to the highest office in the entire Bible the Apostle and he forsook that calling he fell from that office another man took his place Mathias and this proves Jesus blotted out judas's Garrett's name from The Book of Life so it also proves that people can have their names in The Book of Life and then lose salvation just like the Old Testament Exodus 32: 32 and 33 God told Moses they who sin he would blot their names out of the book of life so we see this is a Genesis to Revelation teaching that people can lose their salvation so we know the Calvinists go too far saying a person can never lose their salvation of course this is from the perspective of man but in God's eyes the elect the True Believers like you and I we can never lose our Salvation because of God's forn knowledge God knew we would never betray the faith we would never leave the faith we would never do any of these 13 negative metaphors we'll do the opposite we'll do the positive element to these metaphors as again we'll show at the end of this video so let's begin the first metaphor is Shipwrecked faith this is what happened to Judas es scarat this is found in 1 Timothy 1:19 holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning Faith have made Shipwrecked here's the first metaphor being Shipwrecked a person doesn't make it to their destination and then Paul named two of them hus and Alexander but of course this happened to judas's scarat he never made it to Pentecost brother Ram taught us Shipwrecked Faith does not make it to its destination Shipwrecked Faith blasphemes the truth by going against one's conscience and this is just like Jesus taught in Luke 8:13 the second type of ground the rocky ground they receive the word of God with joy in Luke 8:13 but they have no root which for a while believe and in a time of Temptation fall away that's what happened to judas's scarat so Jesus said people can believe for a while but then Fall Away of course falling away is another metaphor we'll get too soon second metaphor is Waring against God this is seen in numerous places one of them is acts 539 gilia said but if it be of God you cannot overthrow it less happily ye be found even to fight against God 1 Peter 2:11 says fleshly lust which war against the soul so giving into fleshly lust causes a personal civil war against your soul Romans 7:23 through2 Paul said I see another law my members War in against the law of my mind Paul says we should be in the Warfare of the Lord in 1 Corinthians 9:7 who goeth a Warfare any time at his own charges 2 Corinthians 10:4 for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down to strongholds 2 Timothy 2:3 therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that Warth and Tangle himself with the Affairs of this life God has chosen us to be a soldier of of the Cross Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:7 I fought a good fight the third metaphor is falling away of course Jesus mentioned this earlier in Luke 8:13 you also see it in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 let no man deceive you by any means for that day should not come except there come a falling away first Judas fell away he was an apostate he was a Defector he went out at the last supper and did not go to Pentecost 1 John 2:19 they went out from us but they were not of us of course this reminds us of many people who've left good Godly Holy Ghost filled message churches the people that have left these good churches they've Fallen away they've gone apostate they are fighting against God 1 Timothy 4:1 says in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils second Timothy 4:10 for Deus hath forsaken me having loved this present world so again this third metaphors is either falling away a deserter an apostate or running away so Deus was an apostate Deus had forsaken Paul the fourth metaphor is offended or stumbled this is found in Matthew 1321 again speaking of the Stony ground Jesus said he dth for a while but when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he's offended offended means to stumble to fall to be ens snared then Jesus said in Matthew 11:6 blessed is he who shall not be offended in me of course we know the Pharisees Sadducees and so forth stumbled at Jesus verse Peter 2:8 said he was a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word of God being disobedient many people today stumble at brother bram's Ministry they don't search the scriptures enough to see where his ministry is fully bible-based by the grace of God and they become offended at some of the Bible teachings from God's Prophet the fifth metaphor is cut off this is found in John 155 if a man abide not in me he's cast forth as a branch so cast forth means to throw or let go this is what judas's scarat did he was cast off from Christ the vine Jesus said I am the vine ye the branches reminds us of Cain who was cut off from the presence of God he left the presence of God the sixth metaphor is being Cast Away Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9:27 I keep my body and bring it into subjection lest by any means when I preach to others I myself should be a Cast Away Cast Away means rejected not standing the test not approved unfit for the seventh metaphor is returning back to Sodom Jesus warned everyone of this in Luke 177 31-33 Jesus said he that is in the field let him likewise not return back remember Lot's wife so Mrs lot attempted to return back to Sodom to save her life to save her family members but Jesus said don't return back to Sodom don't return back to your past life and this is a warning of course of our Lord Jesus Christ it's a warning to not be like judas's scarat to not be like Mrs lot the eighth metaphor is itching ears from 2 Timothy 42-4 Paul told Timothy to preach the word exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned into fables Heap means to accumulate in piles and itch means to scratch or tickle so they accumulate the wrong teachers they pile up all the wrong sermons and they have itching ears they tickle their ears and they no longer accept the truth they're turn to fables the ninth metaphor is the hardening heart this is found in Hebrews 3 6-8 scripture says Harden not your hearts as in the provocation or the day of Temptation Harden means stubborn which is self-willed and this happened during the second stage of Israel's Exodus this was the Wilderness or this was the second stage of Grace called sanctification for New Testament Believers so a hardened heart is a stubborn heart against the truth of God's word Hebrews 3:12 said take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God so believer should have an heart of Flesh the scripture says and we should let the Holy Spirit right Upon Our fleshly tables of the heart the word of God as 2 Corinthians 3:3 says with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart this must mean an obedient heart and not a rebellious heart the 10th metaphor is crucifying Jesus aresh this is B basically What Judas a scariot did selling him out to be arrested and crucified it's found in Hebrews 64-6 it's found in Hebrews 6 4-12 verse 6 says if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame so someone who crucifies Jesus aresh puts him to an open shame they publicly disgrace the word of God for their day they do it publicly on their videos on their Twitter account on Facebook they crucify the word of God for their day a very serious warning here from Hebrews chapter 6 the 11th metaphor is trampling underfoot the Son of God this is found in Hebrews 10:29 of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trotten underfoot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy thing and ha done despite unto the spirit of Grace So in this metaphor it's trampling underfoot the Son of God so stomping on the truth of the Holy Ghost doing the opposite of the spirit of Grace reaching the second stage of sanctification because the Bible said wherewith he was Sanctified and then he Trot in underfoot the Son of God aresh so this Judas scarit group even today reaches the second stage of sanctification but then tramples underfoot the truth of the Holy Ghost and they disobey the spirit of Grace they don't go further into the third work of Grace the baptism of the Holy Ghost but their faith gets Shipwrecked and they fight against the word of God for their day the 12th metaphor is entangled again so we see entangling this is found in 2 Peter 220 2 Peter 29 is important also because these false teachers promise them Liberty many people that have left the message say they have more Liberty but it's not true Liberty it's a deceptive Liberty where they're allowed to sin in other words Grace has been turned into lasciviousness as Jude verse 4 says these false teachers promise them Liberty give them a false Liberty to sin and they're brought into bondage to sin according to 2 Peter 2:19 but 2 Peter 2:20 says for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again ATT Tangled therein and overcome and the latter end is worse with them than the beginning so the Bible says people can become clean and escape the erors of life according to 2 Peter 2:18 but then they can fall under false teachers and those false teachers bring them back into bondage so they escape bondage but then they are brought back in bondage again so again entangled in bondage and their latter end is worse than their beginning and Peter calls it a dog returned to his own vomit again and a s that was washed to her wallowing in the me that's in 2 Peter 2 verse 22 again reminding us of Lot's wife and judas's scarat the 13th and final metaphor is uprooted or plucked up this is found in Jude 1: 10-13 speaks of Cain balum and Kora the Bible said they are trees whose fruit withereth without fruit fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots Cain refused the perfect will of God the blood sacrifice bam desired the permissive will of God for money and core rebelled against Moses for personal position so they were uprooted out of the people of God they were separated from the people of God they chose not to remain planted in the word of God in the truth in the message of their hour the positive element ISS 1 veres 1-3 a man that walks in the counsil of The Godly he Delights in the law of God he meditates in it day and night he's like a tree planted by the rivers of water and brings forth his fruit in due season so now let's go through the positive element to these metaphors so the first metaphor Shipwrecked our ships as Believers will not wreck because Jesus is in our ship we will reach our destination the second metaphor you you and I will war against the devil and fight for Christ the third metaphor you and I will abide with Christ for we've deserted the world we've run to Jesus Jesus is our City of Refuge fourth God will keep our feet from stumbling we will not stumble or be offended by the word of God fifth we'll remain attached to Christ the branch and then we be gathered into his Garner six we will stand every test and be approved unto God we will not be Cast Away seventh we will remain out of Sodom like Abraham and pray for the Lots in our lives we will not return back to Sodom or have any part of Sodom eighth we will not have itching ears our ears will hear what the spirit is saying to the churches and reject anything contrary wise ninth we will let the Holy Ghost write his word upon the fleshly tables of our hearts we will not have hard hearts 10th we will crucify our affections and lust thereof and show forth the death of Christ in our lives we will not crucify Christ the word of our day 11th we will allow the Lord to put every devil under our feet we will not trample underfoot the word of God 12th we will remain free from Satan's tangling traps for he whom the son is set free is free indeed we will not be entangled again in The Heirs of sin and 13th we will remain planted in the word of God growing up into Christ in all things drinking of his holy Waters we will not be uprooted or plucked up we will not Wither in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing this thought has kind of been returning to me the last few weeks so take courage here's 13 metaphors or simile that you can be encouraged by to help you overcome by the grace of God and the Bible says our Victory is our faith faith is a revelation faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so hold up your Shield of faith and you'll extinguish every fiery Dart of the Enemy by the grace of God we're so thankful for the message of the hour that has revealed these things to us we can be the wise virgin group we can be the group of Holy Ghost filled Believers in the perfect will of God not the permissive will of God like the foolish virgins and we can reach our destination we can Crest every Wave by the grace of God God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
