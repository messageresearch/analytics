TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] like uh I I use this for an illustration and there's a doctrine called pyramid doctrine. But don't never get that in your idea that I that I I believe in pyramid doctrines. I believe in the Bible. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to defend God's prophet, brother Brandham, and some of the quotes he made regarding three Bibles. the written Bible, the stars, and the pyramid of Giza. Some accusers of brother Brandham have tried to make it seem like brother Brandham was dabbling in astrology or the astral arts, which I believe is a ridiculous and foolish accusation. And so, in this video, I'm going to show by the Bible and quotes from God's prophet, Brother Brandham, that that God does use the stars for numerous purposes. And we'll look at the quotes of God's prophet, brother Brandham, where he specifically said numerous times that he was not making a pyramid doctrine and the pyramid and the stars were only used as illustrations or he said a parable or a saying or a sign and not to be made into Bible doctrine. So friends, if you look up the quote three Bibles, there's only 11 hits. So God's prophet never made this a major doctrine or a major teaching and there are no thus sayeth the Lord statements in connection with his quotes on the three Bibles. So this repeated idea brother Random had at least on 11 occasions was just his own human opinion. He was not speaking thus sayith the Lord and he was not trying to make a Bible doctrine as his own words plainly state. I think it'd be good to start with the scriptures here to see what the Bible says about the stars. Of course, Genesis 1:14, God used the stars for signs and seasons. And then astronomers down through the ages have used the stars to tell time, to navigate the earth, to mark seasons, also signs of major events, and also the declaring of God's glory. According to Psalm 19:1, the heavens declare the glory of God. We know the sun and stars were also used for numerous important Bible events such as of course the birth of Jesus spoken of in Matthew 2:2. There was a star in the east that the wise men followed and it brought them to Bethlehem where they found Jesus as a young child. Also when God healed Hezekiah, the Bible says in 2 Kings chapter 20 that Hezekiah pleaded with Isaiah and Isaiah cried out to the Lord and the Lord brought the shadow 10° backwards by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz. So God moved the shadow of the sun back 10° and it looked to Hezekiah as if God was turning back time. Now most commentaries believe this phenomenon was temporary, local or confined to the perspective of Hezekiah. But nevertheless, this is a supernatural sign from the sun that God gave to Hezekiah. Also in the book of Joshua, Joshua commanded the son to stand still so he could get the victory. Joshua 10:12 said, Joshua says, "Son, stand thou still upon Gibian and thou moon in the valley of Agelon." and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. And the Bible said in verse 14, there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel. So God gave Joshua this sign in the skies for the victory over the five kings that wared at Gibian. Then we know there was darkness of course in Egypt during the 10 plagues. Exodus 10:es 21-23. And then at Jesus's death, the sun was darkened out for 3 hours from the 6th to the 9th hour or from 12 to 3 p.m. according to Luke 23 44 and 45. So it's undeniable God uses stars, sun, moon for signs in the sky. Now the origin of this video was last week I was studying on this topic and I found a quote from 1964. It's the sermon Paradox, April 18th in Tampa, Florida. Brother Ram says, "Don't never get a pyramid doctrine." He said, "The stars ain't your Bible." He said, "The pyramids are not your Bible. It's just an illustration that played something in it." In other words, there's truth in the stars and pyramids related to the gospel of Jesus Christ. So in this quote, brother Ram goes through the stars and the pyramids and he says that ain't your Bible. Still, that's not your Bible. So Brother Ram plainly states that he's not trying to make a pyramid doctrine. He's not trying to make a astronomy doctrine or anything like that. Let's listen to the quote. It's just uh here like uh I I use this for an illustration and there's a doctrine called pyramid doctrine, but don't never get that in your idea that I that I I believe in pyramid doctrines. I believe in the Bible. See, and although I believe the pyramid part played something, I believe God wrote three Bibles. He wrote one in the skies, which is the zodiac. Anybody knows that Job spoke of it. What? Look at the zodiac. It starts off with the with the virgin. It ends up with Leo the lion. That's how he come. Thirst for the virgin. His last next coming will be Leo the lion. See coming as a line of tribe of Judah and all in there. The crossfishes are what we're in now. The cancer age and everything. It all speaks. But forget it. See, that ain't your Bible. Then the pyramids, exactly how they were drawn, the headstone was rejected. Still, that's not your Bible. Then God wrote it on words. Jesus comes three times. One time he come to redeem his wife. Next time he comes to catch her away. The next time he comes with her, three come. See, everything like father, son, holy ghost. See, all everything's in a three. The mathematics of the Bible is perfect. If you keep them mathematics right, you can keep your story right. thing. But if you get off the mathematics, you'll have a in your picture a cow picking grass on top of a tree. So it won't it won't look right. See, stay in the mathematics. See the Bible and you place it out. Right. Next, I'd like to look at this quote from 1958. And it shows Brother Brandham sometimes mixed up his words. Sometimes he used the word astrology, which is evil, but he meant to use the word astronomy, which is the study of stars and planets. Astrology is evil of course because of horoscopes but astronomy is just a study of God's creation. And notice in this quote brother Brandham says into the spirit of their astrology or astronomy or astrology I think was the right word. So brother Brandham wasn't even sure which word was right the right word to use. So this again proves how brother Adam was a godly man a prophet of God. He was not trying to bring in any astral arts into the gospel of Jesus Christ. He was doing the best he could with his education. Of course, he was a Holy Ghost fililled Christian. Let's listen to the quote. And until it was real dark, when the twilights of evening was still falling, they had a way of getting themselves into the spirit of their astrology or astronomy. Astrology, I think, was the right word. Next, let's listen to this quote from Have Not. I sent thee, Phoenix, Arizona, January 2462. Brother Ram talks about the three Bibles, and he says, "This is not a teaching. This is a saying." Remember, let me quote it again. Not a teaching, a saying to make a parable. So again, Brother M states it plainly. He's not trying to make any doctrines or teachings. He's looking for parallels. He's making a parable, which is an allegory, a moral story, a lesson. So let's look at lessons we can learn from the stars and the pyramid of Giza. Let's listen to the quote. This is not a teaching. This is a saying. Remember, let me quote it again. Not a teaching, a saying to make a parable. God wrote three Bibles. One of them was in the sky. Man to look up to realize his creator come from there. The zodiac. What's the first thing in the zodiac? Starts off with uh the virgin. What's the last figure in the zodiac? Leo the line again in 1962 July 1st to take on the whole armor of God in California. Brother Ram says now I don't believe in doctrines of pyramids. I'm only making a parable. So again he says it's not a doctrine. But yet, a side note is that the future home proves the new Jerusalem is a pyramid because Jesus, the light of the new Jerusalem, could not be seen by everyone if the city was a cube or rectangular prism or any other three-dimensional figure. Let's listen to the quote. Now, I've been to Egypt and in those pyramids how I could take all afternoon. Now, I don't believe in doctrines of pyramids. I'm only making a parable. But as you notice that pyramid, it never did receive the stone. Enoch built that that pyramid in his days. They can't figure it out. Now they've got all kinds of religions on it like they have in the zodiac. But everything in God wrote three Bibles. The first one was in the heaven. The second one was in the pyramid. The third one's on the earth. And every one of them agree with one another. In the next quote from the future home, brother Bram said, "Enoch's sign in Egypt, the pyramid." Now, notice it's a sign. It's not thus sayith the Lord or anything like that. It's not a doctrine. It's a sign. There's something we can learn from Enoch's pyramid or the pyramid of Giza. Of course, it has no headstone. We know Jesus Christ is the cornerstone. And then we know Zechariah says that that the headstone will come with shoutings of grace, grace unto it. So, we know if the pyramid of Giza is missing the headstone, that's a lesson we can learn that the church needs the headstone of Jesus Christ's return. Jesus is the foundation of the church, but he's also the finishing of the church, the church ages, the times of the Gentiles, the seven church ages. So, we know the fact Jesus is the cornerstone and the headstone is a biblical teaching. It's a biblical truth. When Jesus comes back at the Gentile rapture, that's the end of the time of the Gentiles. And then he goes back to the Jews. He grafts back in the Jewish branch into the holy tree according to Romans 11. And so we see this beautiful sign in the pyramid of Enoch or the pyramid of Giza. Let's listen to the quote. This being this way would answer exactly Enoch's sign in Egypt. the pyramid was it? Enoch before the antalivian destruction when justification was coming in he brought forth a sign and in this pyramid is seven steps going to the king's chamber. What's on the seventh step? If you ever study the dimensions of the pyramid, what comes out to take the oncomer to introduce to the king, watch whose station that is standing there and you'll see the day you're living in the pyramid. Now, God made three Bibles. Now, there's a pyramid teaching. It's nonsense. But there's a genuine pyramid. Amen. Notice now God first Bible, he made three. They have to be everything in three. Jesus comes three times. come once to redeem his bride, next time to get his bride, next time with his bride. See, now notice how beautiful. See, and in this pyramid was seven steps. And then the king's chamber. And we're in the seventh church age. That's right. Before the king takes his throne. And remember, the pyramid never did have a capstone on it. God's first Bible was in the skies, the zodiac. It starts off and runs every age. The first beginning of the zodiac is the virgin. That's how he come first. The last figure in the zodiac is Leo the lion, the second coming. Just before there is a cross fishes, which is a cancer age that we're living in now. There was a pyramid after that Enoch, which testified exactly. We wouldn't have time to go into it, but someday with God's help, I'll show you just exactly draws the dimension of the hour we're living. See, in closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Again, I got this inspiration last week after listening to this quote from Paradox 1964. Brother man was plainly saying he's not making a Bible doctrine. He's not making a teaching. He never spoke thus sayith the Lord on this. He just looked at the stars and the pyramid and he saw lots of illustrations, parables, sayings, or signs that Christians could benefit from. And that is certainly the truth. And again, it proves Brother Adam is a genuine prophet of God. He spoke with thus sayith the Lord numerous times and it came to pass as my videos have already shown as most honest Christians already know. And here he's doing his best to try to give the church illustrations, parables, sayings, signs that help them prepare for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. And remember friends, some people even think Isaiah 19 and 20 is speaking of the pyramid of Giza as a sign. It says, "In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord, and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt." So, this is the verse some people believe can be used to show that God set up the pyramid of Giza as a sign. So, God anointed Enoch to construct this pyramid and then it would be a sign throughout history. It's a sign to the unbelievers in Egypt from the Lord that Jesus is coming back that God is going to cap this pyramid by the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. And no doubt this can also be a sign to Egypt that what God did in the time of Moses with the plagues is going to repeat very closely during the great tribulation period through the trumpets and the vows, the seven trumpets and seven vows of the tribulation period. I have a video on that. There's lots of similarities between the trumpets, vows, and the 10 plagues that already struck Egypt. So, God sets this sign. A lot of people believe this sign from Isaiah 19, 19, and 20 is the pyramid of Giza. I don't know. I'm not sure. It sure looks like it though to me. And of course, people will probably criticize my opinion. They can criticize whatever they want. The main thing is that we are saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. By grace through faith with faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. And then to be the wise version, you must be justified, sanctified, and have your soul baptized with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. As Jesus said in Acts chapter 1, wait in Jerusalem until you're due with power from on high, and you'll be baptized with the Holy Ghost. It's undeniable God has left many signs to his people. And of course there are signs in the stars, signs in the heavens. The Bible says that. And we take all these signs back to the word of God because the word of God is our absolute. So friends, let's continue walking in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Walking in the spirit, believing all the word of God. And we can be thankful for the illustrations God has given to us, the parables, the signs, the sayings. God uses all these things around us that he placed there to help keep our attention, our focus on the Lord Jesus Christ. We seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things are added unto us according to the word of the Lord. Let's keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible says he's going to return to all those that love his appearing as St. Paul said. Let's love the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He is never failed. [Music]
