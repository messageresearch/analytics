TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom of understanding the spirit of counsel might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord and shall make him of quick understanding and the fear of the Lord greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to do a part three on the fear of the Lord in this video we're going to look at the quotes from God's Prophet brother William brandham about the fear of the Lord and we'll also bring this to a conclusion by the grace of God so let's begin with four quotes with the exact phrase of the fear of the Lord from God's Prophet brother brandham the first one is that Israel was at the Red Sea and they had separated from Egypt with the fear of the Lord and remember the Bible told us the fear of the Lord was to hate evil so Israel hated Egypt and then they departed from the evil so both those elements apply to the fear of the Lord you must hate evil and then depart from it let's listen to the quote 1956 Divine love and Sovereign Grace now there's the Israel right in the corner after stepping out the serve the Lord here they are back right up death charging right to them the dust of the wheels are coming the desert they being entangled out there somewhere and just slore them down if they started that way there there was a Red Sea before them and they couldn't get across that what are they going to do isn't this strange are heavenly father just saying back then we just watch this picture develop in the second quote brother Ram said the fear of the Lord went before Joshua and blind bmus had remembered that and that's true the fear of the Lord was upon all of Jericho the true anointing of the fear of the Lord though came on Rahab and her household only for only they were saved the fear of the Lord makes you depart from Evil hate evil and so the only ones in Jericho that wanted to be saved were Rahab and her family they had the token let's listen to the quote then he remember just out from that gate that great Joshua had marched Israel right over those same cobblestones right around the walls of Jericho and all of Jericho was shut up although they had the Israelite numbered many times but the fear of the Lord went before them amen they held their peace in 1961 the sixfold purpose of Daniel's visit to Gabriel Brother Bram read Isaiah 11: 1-9 and of course this is a text about the Millennium that's what brother R is talking about in the six full purpose of Gabriel's visit he was showing how one of the purposes of Gabriel's visit was to show Daniel when the most holy would be anointed and of course that's the millennial Temple receiving Jesus because brother Ram says Jesus is already anointed but when Jesus steps into the most holy place in the millennial Temple then it will be anointed and this is the Bible text of course where it goes through the anointing Upon Jesus it's a beautiful text let's listen to the quote listen everybody close now this is doing the time of the Millennium when the most holy is Anointed and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse a branch that shall grow out of his roots who was that Christ out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom of understanding the spirit of counsel might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord and shall make him of quick understanding and the ear of the Lord and the Wolf also shall dwell with the lamb amen and the leopard shall lie down with the kid that's a goat and the calf and the Young Lion and the fatling The Lion and the Fatman together and a little child shall lead them the fourth and final quote with the exact words fear the lord is from presuming 196 62 brother brand again refers to Jericho and Joshua how the fear of the Lord was upon Jericho again Rahab was the only one who got under the true anointing of the fear of the Lord that's why she got saved that's why she had the token I want to bring a scripture in here it seems like all of Jericho was under the partial fear of the Lord and that's something I didn't cover in this series perhaps I'll do a separate video on it but the partial fear of the Lord is found in 2 Kings 17: 24- 41 the Babylonians had a partial fear of the Lord enough fear of the Lord to keep the Lions away yet they enjoyed secret sin and idolatry so this seems to be the fear of the Lord like Judas es scarat may have had we'd say the borderline Believers so most of the people in Jericho in the days of Joshua had a partial fear of the Lord they knew God was with the army of Joshua but they didn't have the full fear of the Lord in order to repent hate evil and be saved but let's listen to the quote Joshua he said we're more than able to good we're more than able why said they're only bread for us why they look great they are great but we have great bread yes said God gave us a promise and the fear of us is up on every one of them yet they different with us yet they're scared of us am sure said the fear of fear of the Lord's up on every one of them they're scared to death of us said let's go take it God give it to us so it's ours let's move on take it next there's only five quotes with the exact phrase beginning of wisdom from God's Prophet brother brandham brother Bram said Noah had the fear of the Lord and was saved this is from the message of Grace 1961 let's listen to the quote the grace of God reached over in Noah's time Noah just an ordinary man he and his family but because Noah feared God he believed God you can't fear God without believing how how can you fear something you don't believe you've got to fear God Solomon said the fear of God's beginning of wisdom yes amen now just the fear of God you're beginning to have wisdom and the fear of God Noah feared the Lord and he believed the Lord amen and that's what God honors is your faith in him that's right then when the fear of God come upon Noah God called him by grace and saved him in his house because it was Grace that did it not because Noah was a great big handsomer man than all the rest of them not because Noah went to the best Church there was in the country not because he belonged to the best in organization not because he could dress better not because he had more money not because he was some special person but because of the grace of God God saved Noah Grace save Noah the next quote is from respects 1961 the fear of the Lord was the second set of scriptures brother bandam used the first opening text was Psalms 105: 50 do my prophets no harm touch not M anointed and then right after the text Brother R went into the fear of the Lord he read Ecclesiastes 12 about the whole conclusion of the matter being to fear the lord then he said the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so it seems like the fear of the Lord and not touching God's anointed prophets and doing them no harm is the foundation for that sermon respects 1961 let's listen to the quote saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm hallelujah praise our God I want to take a a subject from there of respect reading here David crying out to the Lord respects is what we owe to God and that's one thing that I would like to uh drill this to the heart of every person here tonight that in all things that we see going on we must give respects to it amen see we must respect it and David said that when they were very few men of Israel perhaps Abraham Isaac and Jacob who is speaking on very few men that he rebuked Nations and Kings for them God rebuked the Nations and Kings saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm over in Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter and the 13th verse it's written like this see let us share the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the full duty of man the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and when you cannot have respects until you have fear you've got to have fear of God Solomon said also in the Proverbs that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom amen the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom now that don't mean that you're afraid of him but that means that you're giving him respect and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear L you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to I fear my mother I fear my my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling box somewhere in their way I I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I should do something wrong wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian see you've got before you can have respect you've got to have fear and God demands it he demands respects God does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respects the next quote 1963 the way of a true Prophet I love how brother R uses the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom with Amos 3:7 remember Amos 3:7 says surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets brother R is talking about how the fear of the Lord will respect a prophet and of course brother ROM is showing how he's a prophet so we see True Believers have the fear of the Lord when a prophet speaks with thus say the Lord and that's what brother Ram did let's listen to the quote when a Li and Roth see who cannot fear and the fear of God is beginning of which wisdom is that right that's what the wise man said the fear of God now I want you people in that prayer line stand there all you that know that I know nothing about you raise up your hands everyone the good Lord of Heaven being my judge as far as I know in my life I've never seen one of them in my life they probably seen me from sitting out in the audience in the next quote God's power to transform 1965 brother Ram said people have lost the fear of the Lord in respects to thus sayith the Lord he said people used to tremble at the word of the Lord with thus sayith the Lord but they don't anymore they've lost the scare of it they don't fear God brother brandham said and that's so true brother brandham can say something like trinitarianism is of the devil thus sayith the Lord people don't tremble at that they're so indoctrinated with their additions to the Bible like three persons and father son Holy Ghost sprinkling or even baptism when the book of Acts shows baptism only happens in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and brother R gave us thus sayith the Lord on the godhead there's one person thus sayith the Lord on the true baptism the Lord Jesus Christ thus sayi the Lord on marriage and divorce only one man and one woman they're married until death there's only one cause for divorce and remarriage and it's extremely rare brother Ram said women or men can dance in the spirit shout speak in tongues but if a woman cuts her hair she's dead that's thus sayith the Lord people don't fear that anymore so many more examples but it's a powerful statement by Brother Bram let's listen to the quote it seems that people's lost your common deceny and modesty they're not like they used to be they used to be when the prophet said thus sayith the Lord the people trembled yes it certainly didn't the people moved for they was afraid but now they lost all their scare of it they don't fear God Solomon said the the fear of God is the beginning of wisd wisdom it's the beginning of it but the prophet can speak thus sayith the Lord people say nonsense see there's not a hope for them it's they say well we're smart we're intellectual we don't have to take that kind of stuff we know what we're talking about and last but not least the final quote is from the invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965 brother Brandon prayed for the fear or trembling at the word of God before preaching the visible union he said the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom it's a humble simple powerful prayer let's listen to the quote May your spirit fall upon us and anoint the word to our hearts that we might go from here this evening better people than we are now and we might have a closer Insight on Jesus Christ granted Lord that we might understand the day that we're living in and the preparation of God for people in this hour this great crucial dark time that we're now living in God anoint us not only speaker but hearer and together make our hearts to tremble at your word for the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom Grant these things father for we ask it in Jesus Jesus name amen I'd like to title these few remarks that I was going to make here and some scriptures that I would like to follow up closely behind if the Lord willing to the uh the Thanksgiving message to the invisable of the invisable Union of the bride of Christ the invisible Union of the bride of Christ it doesn't sound like a Thanksgiving message though any uh scripture we thankful for all of it conclusion friends hope this Series has been a blessing by the grace of God again as I look at this screen from the Old Testament verses the fear of the Lord is all incompass ing it seems the fear of the Lord is your confidence your Refuge your Fountain of Life your source of Happiness it's your future reward it's the conclusion of life's purpose in the New Testament it's the same it's your source of God's mercy it's your hope in the last moments before death it's your motivation for perfecting Holiness in your life the key to a loving marriage your acceptance with God your humility as you work out your own salvation it's your mindset for sojourning here in service to God and so much more so we see the fear of the Lord is the conclusion of the matter it's the meaning of life in both the Old Testament and the New Testament this is an all-encompassing anointing and that's what it is it's an anointing of the Holy Ghost as we saw in the life of Jesus in Isaiah 11 1-3 friends if this is the anointing Jesus Christ had that's the anointing we need for our lives we need the an anointing of the fear of the Lord to hate evil to depart from Evil to love righteousness and obey God and have loving obedience to the word of God profound adoration for God profound honor for God that's the anointing we need and we can have by the grace of God friends I just believe the fear of the Lord this must be the anointing of the onfire condition of Revelation 3:15 Jesus said we're either going to be on fire lukewarm or hot having the fear of the Lord anointing it must be the onfire anointing in other words the baptism of the Holy Ghost this must be an anointing on someone who has the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the New Testament for again that's what Isaiah 11 1-3 said about Jesus Jesus had the fear of the Lord of course the spirit of knowledge Spirit of understanding the spirit of the fear of the Lord and he was baptized with the Holy Ghost as the Bible says and this must be the anointing on the wise version because she has extra oil she has the baptism of the Holy Ghost she wants wants to stay pure from all evil because her Lord her husband Jesus died and he was cursed with evil the Bible said cursed is anyone who hangs on a tree Jesus Took on our curse that we might receive his Blessing he was made sin that we might become his righteousness so here's a few more slides in conclusion wisdom from the fear of the Lord is your tree of life it's your principal thing Proverbs 4:7 the fear of the Lord helps you grow in all wisdom or maturity according to Daniel 1:4 Ephesians 18 Colossians 1:9 Colossians 1:29 and Colossians 3 16 the Bible speaks of all wisdom on at least five occasions so if the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom the way you get to all wisdom is continuing to walk in the fear of the Lord over the course of many years decades and then your mature Holy Ghost filled Christian walking in all wisdom friends we want to be like Jesus Christ so let's have order of prayer that God will help us to walk in this anointing father God we thank you for these scriptures on the fear of the Lord Lord we can see that you put this anointing on your son so God help us as the Bride of the Son of God the New Testament Church the Bride of Jesus Christ help us to walk under the anointing of the fear of the Lord we need it every hour Lord God we want to be on fire we want to have extra oil we want to be ready for your coming Lord God so we ask that that anointing would rest upon us and we would be able to mature Beyond pass the beginning of the fear of the Lord and mature into all wisdom because we want to be the wise virgin Grant it Lord God we know all things are possible to them that believe thank you for this revelation of this message of the hour we're so grateful it's transformed Our Lives Lord God it helps us to know you in the power of your resurrection and the fellowship of your sufferings so father I pray for this anointing to be on your people and I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
