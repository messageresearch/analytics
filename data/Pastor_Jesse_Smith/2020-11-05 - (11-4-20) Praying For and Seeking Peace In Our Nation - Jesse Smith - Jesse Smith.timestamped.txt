[24:19] [Music]
[24:28] say our bibles here will stand by god's
[24:30] grace in your homes
[24:32] i'll sing about that song i came to
[24:34] worship and we came to youtube
[24:36] to worship together so that's how we
[24:38] came together tonight
[24:40] let's go to first timothy two i have to
[24:42] look at this uh
[24:44] thought tonight as the nation is uh in
[24:46] this
[24:48] little bit of uh confusion time
[24:52] i like to look at this thought of
[24:53] praying for
[24:55] and seeking peace in our nation we
[24:58] always need to pray for our
[24:59] nation and uh we need to seek the peace
[25:03] of god
[25:06] so let's go to first timothy two verse
[25:08] one
[25:13] first timothy 2 1.
[25:32] praise god
[25:36] [Music]
[25:39] read one through eight by god's grace
[25:46] why don't we read one and two together
[25:49] and then i'll read
[25:50] three through eight okay we'll read one
[25:53] and two together
[25:55] let's begin on three between
[26:00] we'll begin on three one two three
[26:04] i exhort therefore that first of all
[26:08] supplications prayers intercessions
[26:11] and giving of thanks be made for all men
[26:15] for kings and for all that are in
[26:18] authority
[26:19] that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
[26:22] life
[26:23] in all godliness and honesty
[26:27] i'll read myself 3-8
[26:30] for this is good and acceptable in the
[26:32] sight of god
[26:33] our savior who will have all men to be
[26:37] saved
[26:38] and to come unto the knowledge of the
[26:40] truth
[26:41] for there is one god and one mediator
[26:43] between god and men
[26:45] the man christ jesus
[26:49] who gave himself a ransom for all
[26:53] to be testified in due time
[26:56] whereunto i am ordained a preacher an
[26:59] apostle i'm sorry and an apostle
[27:02] i speak the truth in christ and ly not
[27:05] a teacher of the gentiles in faith and
[27:07] verity
[27:11] i will therefore that men pray
[27:13] everywhere
[27:16] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[27:19] doubting
[27:20] may god add his blessings three is where
[27:22] he may be seated
[27:25] i'm gonna adjust this a little bit
[27:34] so i want to just take a few uh minutes
[27:35] here and preach
[27:37] by god's grace i took off my watch so
[27:39] i'm not sure
[27:41] um we'll try to watch the time i guess i
[27:44] can do it on my phone here let me
[27:46] just set a timer so i just got about an
[27:49] idea
[27:50] how far we'll go let me set it for 40
[27:53] minutes and see how it goes by god's
[27:54] grace
[27:56] but if you just hold on just set it down
[27:58] anywhere just
[28:00] so we like to look at this thought here
[28:02] of uh praying for the nation and also
[28:05] uh seeking peace in the nation
[28:09] you know a lot of my prayers obviously
[28:11] have been on the election and
[28:14] things related to politics uh
[28:17] over the last numerous years but of
[28:19] course especially in the last
[28:21] few weeks and months here leading up to
[28:23] the election
[28:25] and so uh scripturally um
[28:29] i believe that's the right thing to do i
[28:30] believe it uh
[28:32] there's uh there's a responsibility
[28:35] christians have
[28:36] to do that so i want to just take a a
[28:39] sermon tonight and kind of look at the
[28:40] scriptural
[28:42] basis that we have for our government
[28:44] and for
[28:45] um for voting and then of course
[28:48] uh numerous things our prophet brother
[28:51] branham said about it
[28:52] um i just want to start here you know
[28:55] here here's paul
[28:56] uh and i just want to just point out
[28:58] verses one and two he says pray for all
[29:00] those that are leadership
[29:02] um you know we should pray for our local
[29:03] officials and state and then government
[29:06] uh officials that's this is
[29:09] called good and acceptable in the sight
[29:11] of god
[29:13] so we never want to you know look down
[29:15] on that if anyone
[29:16] would look down on someone praying for
[29:18] leaders
[29:21] we don't look down on upon that we want
[29:23] to honor that that's a very respectful
[29:25] thing to do
[29:26] as we'll see why here in a few moments
[29:28] by god's grace
[29:31] and so you can see that god works
[29:34] through
[29:35] human government verse 3
[29:39] i'm sorry verse 2 says the reason we do
[29:41] this the reason we pray for our leaders
[29:43] in america
[29:44] is so we can lead a quiet and peaceable
[29:47] life
[29:48] in all godliness and honesty
[29:52] so our motivation is that we pray
[29:55] for our leaders that we can have peace
[29:59] uh in our country uh that we can live a
[30:02] completely
[30:03] godly life we can live a totally honest
[30:06] life
[30:07] uh before all men that's our motivation
[30:10] this is the bible says this is good
[30:13] uh and acceptable in the sight of our
[30:15] savior i'm reminded now i didn't have my
[30:16] notes but i'm reminded of ecclesiastes
[30:19] uh where solomon urges you know the
[30:22] readers
[30:24] he urges them to enjoy life he said but
[30:27] remember god will bring all these things
[30:29] into
[30:29] into judgment
[30:33] solomon says whatever you do do with all
[30:35] your heart and i know
[30:36] the colossians repeats that as well do
[30:38] it with all your strength
[30:40] and so we have this liberty as as
[30:43] christians
[30:45] to live godly and pursue peace and
[30:49] and that's a scriptural rite that we see
[30:51] right here in the scripture
[30:53] um and notice then verse 8 i just wanted
[30:57] to point this one out as well
[30:59] that men pray everywhere we can pray
[31:01] everywhere we can pray in our homes at
[31:03] the church
[31:04] at the state house right we can pray
[31:07] everywhere lift up holy hands
[31:11] without wrath and doubting so we have no
[31:13] reason to doubt that god would
[31:15] not hear us right if we're praying for
[31:18] our leadership
[31:18] and our government or the sick like we
[31:22] were tonight we pray for the sick
[31:24] so we have confidence that our great god
[31:27] and savior
[31:28] jesus christ the mediator between god
[31:30] and man he hears us no matter where
[31:32] we are so that means god is present and
[31:34] god's aware
[31:35] of uh every
[31:39] every job of man right every uh every
[31:42] avenue of man
[31:43] every uh every office of man
[31:47] god is aware of it and of course now we
[31:50] know the balance to it we will get to
[31:51] the balance a little bit
[31:52] the balance is that you know satan
[31:54] offered jesus
[31:56] all the kingdoms of the world so we know
[31:58] the majority of people in leadership
[32:01] uh are not godly people many of them are
[32:04] not
[32:05] um and yet we're still called to pray
[32:07] for them
[32:08] right we're so called to pray for them
[32:11] maybe my children can help me on this
[32:12] one i was listening and uh
[32:14] do you know during the days of the
[32:16] romans did they get to vote for their
[32:18] leaders or was it like a tyrant kind of
[32:20] rulership
[32:20] do you remember it would depend on the
[32:24] time
[32:26] okay
[32:34] yeah so you know i've heard recently you
[32:37] know some people say well jesus never
[32:39] voted paul never voted
[32:40] many times they didn't have the chance
[32:42] to vote
[32:44] power was often passed down and it was
[32:47] killed for it was fought for
[32:52] so that's one thing to keep in mind you
[32:54] know as we'll get to that in a little
[32:55] bit
[32:56] but yet we know
[32:59] you know the one who inspired paul to
[33:02] write this was jesus christ
[33:04] and yet jesus christ knew every human
[33:07] government
[33:08] governing body and leadership was
[33:10] ultimately controlled by satan
[33:12] but yet he still prayed that we could
[33:15] have peace
[33:16] as christians it's a holy ghost-filled
[33:18] prophet of god named paul
[33:20] encouraging us to pray for peace and yet
[33:23] satan
[33:24] uh is in control of many of these
[33:26] governments no doubt about it
[33:29] so i just want to start with that
[33:30] thought uh that we can pray everywhere
[33:32] and we're to pray for this
[33:34] the main purpose is that we can live a
[33:36] peaceful life
[33:38] that we can help others to know god
[33:41] because who will have all men to be
[33:43] saved and come to the knowledge of the
[33:45] truth so god wants all men to be saved
[33:47] and come to the knowledge of the truth
[33:49] that's best done when we can live a
[33:52] quiet and peaceable life in godliness
[33:55] and honesty according to the scripture
[33:57] here
[33:58] so we thank the lord for that now i want
[34:00] to
[34:03] look at another scripture here let's go
[34:06] to jeremiah 29
[34:07] 1. so to kind of go along with this idea
[34:11] of praying for peace
[34:13] we see this also in jeremiah 29
[34:17] i believe 1-7
[34:23] [Applause]
[34:25] now the context as you probably know is
[34:27] that
[34:31] israel was getting uh exiled out of the
[34:34] promised land for their sins
[34:36] their many many sins and so
[34:39] many of them were going to be taken away
[34:41] to assyria or babylon
[34:44] but jeremiah had a word for them
[34:48] now let's look at jeremiah 29 1.
[34:51] now these are the words of the letter
[34:53] that jeremiah the prophet sent from
[34:55] jerusalem unto the residue of the elders
[34:57] which were carried away captives
[34:59] and to the priests and to the prophets
[35:00] and to all the people from
[35:02] nebuchadnezzar had carried away
[35:03] captive from jerusalem to babylon
[35:08] now let's go let's get down to verse 4.
[35:10] thus saith the lord of hosts the god of
[35:12] israel unto all that are carried away
[35:14] captives
[35:15] whom i have caused to be carried away
[35:17] from jerusalem unto babylon
[35:21] verse five build e houses
[35:25] and dwell in them and plant vineyards
[35:27] and eat the fruit of them so
[35:29] israel was going to be slaves but they
[35:31] had the freedom to build their own
[35:33] houses
[35:35] and so god tells them build your own
[35:38] houses
[35:40] bricks take e wives and beget sons and
[35:42] daughters and take wives for your sons
[35:45] and give your daughters to husbands that
[35:48] they may bear sons and daughters that
[35:49] you'd be
[35:51] increased there and not diminished
[35:54] now here's verse 7 we're going to go
[35:56] here and
[35:58] seek the peace of the city whether i
[36:00] have caused you to be carried away
[36:02] captives
[36:03] and pray unto the lord for it so there
[36:05] in babylon
[36:07] a heathen land and god says
[36:10] go along like you're going to live there
[36:13] right
[36:14] build your houses have weddings have
[36:17] children
[36:18] don't diminish your numbers increase
[36:19] your numbers and
[36:21] seek the peace of the city bless you
[36:25] whether i have caused you to be carried
[36:26] away captives and pray
[36:28] unto the lord for it these are heathens
[36:31] right so a lot of people think i
[36:33] wouldn't want to pray for these heathens
[36:35] that the bible says pray for the the
[36:37] peace
[36:38] of that city a bunch of heathens bunch
[36:41] of idolaters
[36:43] pray for idolaters to live in peace with
[36:46] the believers the jews
[36:49] for in the peace thereof shall ye have
[36:53] peace
[36:56] so what a promise god gives them and now
[36:59] this is one of the most beautiful
[37:00] chapters people often
[37:01] you know quote this
[37:04] at weddings and of course all to
[37:07] encourage themselves you know in verse
[37:09] 10 god tells them he's going to give him
[37:10] 70 years they'll be there that's why i
[37:12] said build the houses have children
[37:14] have weddings going to be there 70 years
[37:16] i'm going to bring you out
[37:18] verse 11 for i know the thoughts that i
[37:20] think toward you saith the lord thoughts
[37:21] of peace and out of evil
[37:23] to give you an expected end
[37:29] okay then you shall call upon me you
[37:30] shall go and pray unto me and i will
[37:32] hearken unto you and you shall seek me
[37:33] and find me
[37:34] when ye shall search for me with all
[37:36] your heart and i will be found of you
[37:38] saith the lord
[37:39] and i will turn away your captivity and
[37:41] i will gather you from all the nations
[37:43] and from all the places whether i've
[37:44] driven you saith the lord i'll bring you
[37:46] again into the place
[37:47] whence i cause you to be carried away
[37:50] captive
[37:51] what a beautiful promise right god
[37:52] promises and peace
[37:56] and god's thoughts for them his own
[37:58] people
[37:59] that were under a temporary punishment
[38:01] right x out of their land
[38:03] god's plans for them were peace
[38:06] not just once they got back to israel
[38:09] but while
[38:10] they set up homes in babylon
[38:14] and he said pray for peace in the city
[38:17] that you may have peace
[38:20] and so the same you see how we see the
[38:22] same idea saints you know in the old
[38:23] testament here with jeremiah
[38:26] and then also the new testament right
[38:28] that was just a different form of
[38:29] babylon right
[38:30] rome paul was under the roman empire
[38:34] battling the roman empire died under the
[38:35] roman empire
[38:37] just another form of the same antichrist
[38:40] spirit
[38:40] but yet in both cases one's old
[38:42] testament one's new
[38:43] new testament god is encouraging them
[38:46] pray for peace that you can live a godly
[38:49] life
[38:50] in all honesty and sincerity
[38:54] so i thought i would start with those so
[38:56] everybody can see
[38:58] no matter no matter where we are old
[39:01] testament new testament we're to pray
[39:02] for peace
[39:03] and we're to act in peace
[39:07] now of course there's another thought
[39:09] the other thought is with there's a time
[39:11] for war and time for peace now that
[39:13] of course the time of war was the
[39:14] american revolution we know our
[39:16] country went through that world war one
[39:18] world war ii there was times for war
[39:20] this obviously right now is a time of
[39:22] peace
[39:24] and so we rejoice in that but we're
[39:26] still to pray for peace especially with
[39:28] this summer's riots and
[39:30] all the violence and things we are to
[39:32] pray for peace we are the agents of
[39:34] peace
[39:35] and we're to plead with god to send
[39:38] peace in our in our land and that's what
[39:41] we should do by god's grace
[39:43] now go to romans 13 we'll hit this here
[39:52] you know some we had a brother years ago
[39:54] come to church and he don't come anymore
[39:55] but
[39:56] he told me romans 13 was about preachers
[39:59] and i said no it's not preachers it's
[40:00] about
[40:01] government officials and
[40:04] the proof of that is because you don't
[40:06] pay dues and tributes and customs
[40:09] in verse 7 to preachers you pay tithes
[40:12] and offerings to preachers
[40:14] okay these are the same greek words
[40:16] where jesus told
[40:18] uh peter you know give to caesar what's
[40:20] caesar's right
[40:22] speaking of the government
[40:26] so um this whole chapter is devoted
[40:29] um to being subject to the higher power
[40:32] so listening to the governments
[40:34] uh that god places over mankind
[40:39] okay and now just to preface this
[40:42] what was the previous chapter and
[40:44] remember the previous chapter was about
[40:46] how to do the perfect will of god right
[40:49] romans 12
[40:50] is about doing the perfect will of god
[40:53] making your body living sacrifice and
[40:55] then transforming your mind right
[40:57] and the chapter ended chapter 12 ended
[41:00] with um
[41:01] be not overcome with evil but overcome
[41:04] evil with good
[41:06] and then on that thought with
[41:08] transformed mind doing the perfect will
[41:09] of god
[41:11] paul now he's told him to do the perfect
[41:13] will of god now he says submit to the
[41:14] government
[41:18] as long as they as long as the
[41:19] government agrees with god's word
[41:23] now verse 3 i'm sorry verse 1 in chapter
[41:26] 13
[41:26] that every soul be subject under the
[41:28] higher powers
[41:30] for there is no power but of god the
[41:33] powers that be
[41:35] are ordained of god so god has ordained
[41:38] god ordained the roman government when
[41:40] paul wrote this god ordained the united
[41:41] states government
[41:43] and each government around the nation
[41:44] god ordained
[41:46] that government uh remember this is all
[41:49] orchestrated by god uh remember jesus
[41:52] told pilate he said
[41:53] you don't have any power over me but
[41:55] what my father gives you
[41:56] remember that children so every
[42:00] every human power was a power ordained
[42:02] of god it says it right there that's
[42:04] ordained of god
[42:06] god ordained that we live under uh i'm
[42:09] sorry our republic here
[42:10] in the united states verse two
[42:14] whosoever therefore resists the power
[42:16] resists this the ordinance of god
[42:18] and they that resist shall receive to
[42:20] themselves damnation
[42:25] for rulers are not a terror to do good
[42:27] works but to the evil
[42:30] wilt thou then not be afraid of the
[42:32] power
[42:33] do that which is good and thou shalt
[42:35] have praise of the same
[42:38] so we should be law abiding citizens
[42:42] verse 4 for he is the minister of god to
[42:44] thee for good
[42:47] but if thou do that which is evil be
[42:49] afraid for he beareth not the story in
[42:51] vain for he's the minister of god a
[42:53] revenger
[42:54] to execute wrath upon him that doeth
[42:56] evil
[42:59] wherefore you must need to be subject
[43:01] not only for wrath but also for
[43:02] conscience sake
[43:06] so the bible says we will have a bad
[43:08] conscience
[43:10] toward god if we're not obeying the laws
[43:12] of the land
[43:14] verse six for this cause you paid
[43:17] tribute also
[43:18] for they are god's ministers attending
[43:20] continually upon this very thing
[43:23] render therefore to all their dues
[43:25] tribute to whom tribute is due custom to
[43:27] whom custom
[43:28] fear to whom fear honor to whom honor
[43:31] that's why when we tell
[43:32] if we go before judge we say your honor
[43:34] right
[43:35] they should have honor they're ordained
[43:37] of god now they might be
[43:39] some of them might be good some of them
[43:40] might be rascals
[43:42] but we're still supposed to honor them
[43:48] now verses 8 uh the 14 talks about how
[43:51] we all must love one another
[43:54] love fulfills all the law now in verse
[43:57] 14 i want to
[43:58] just say that
[44:03] well why don't we read uh 13 and 14
[44:06] because this ties in with what paul
[44:08] wrote to timothy about living an honest
[44:10] life
[44:11] let us walk honestly as in the day not
[44:14] in rioting and drunkenness
[44:16] not in uh chambering and wontonness or
[44:19] wantonness
[44:21] not in strife or envying
[44:24] but put ye on the lord jesus christ
[44:28] and make not provision for the flesh to
[44:31] fulfill
[44:32] the lust thereof now i don't know if you
[44:34] remember when we preached on
[44:36] ephesians and we looked at the history
[44:38] of the roman government
[44:40] and the roman society it was awful it
[44:42] was
[44:43] men could do evil things to their wives
[44:45] their children
[44:47] they were just had way too much power um
[44:50] the social life and the
[44:52] the social customs were absolutely
[44:54] corrupt and filthy
[44:56] i don't i don't can't even mention these
[44:58] things that they were so awful and
[44:59] filthy
[45:00] but yet paul says in the midst of that
[45:02] darkness shine as the light
[45:05] and he said put on the lord jesus christ
[45:07] in other words
[45:08] put on the full armor of god be anointed
[45:10] with the holy spirit
[45:12] and live a honest life obeying
[45:16] all the laws of the land
[45:19] okay so again paul writes this after
[45:21] saying we must do the perfect will of
[45:23] god
[45:24] we find out god ordains the government
[45:26] leaders
[45:27] we're to pray for them and ask god to
[45:30] to help them but mostly that we can live
[45:33] in peace
[45:34] and others can hear the gospel of jesus
[45:37] christ that we have heard
[45:39] that's the main point here of praying
[45:41] for our government
[45:42] and leadership okay now i'm going to
[45:46] switch over to my notes add some
[45:47] electronic notes here
[45:49] um and we'll be uh looking at some of
[45:52] those
[45:53] here by god's grace
[45:58] so i want to um now look at this thought
[46:01] you know a lot of people
[46:04] at least around the churches we
[46:05] associate with called the message of the
[46:07] hour churches
[46:08] um they will take
[46:12] quotes from our prophet william branham
[46:14] and though they'll try to make it sound
[46:15] like
[46:16] um you know we shouldn't vote we
[46:19] shouldn't have any interest in the
[46:20] government or anything
[46:22] but uh i think it's okay for brother
[46:25] brahm to have those opinions of course
[46:26] he's a man
[46:28] now we've read what the scripture says
[46:30] and i just want to start with a few
[46:31] different quotations um i don't have
[46:34] some of these
[46:35] in front of me i'm just going to go off
[46:36] memory but i know brother branham said a
[46:38] couple of times
[46:40] he wouldn't vote um because the
[46:43] elections are rigged
[46:45] and that's possible as we're seeing now
[46:46] some of them may be rigged there's a lot
[46:48] of
[46:48] there could be some uh corruption with
[46:51] the ballots and everything the mail
[46:52] ballots or ones that were delivered so
[46:55] we're just praying for god to figure
[46:57] that out
[46:58] if it be god's will um
[47:02] but i'm going to bring out you know some
[47:03] different uh scriptures and and then
[47:05] some quotes from the prophet of god
[47:07] that we can look at tonight now here's
[47:09] one from 1954 invisible union i'm sorry
[47:11] invasion united states sorry
[47:13] now remember i never cast a vote my life
[47:16] see now
[47:16] that's nothing to brag on that's my
[47:18] american birth rights if i want to do it
[47:20] so brother man wasn't proud that he
[47:22] never voted
[47:24] he said there's nothing to brag on but i
[47:27] think too much of my friends to put them
[47:29] in there look i've seen them go in as
[47:32] fine men come out as crooks and i don't
[47:34] want that so one reason brother ramsey
[47:35] didn't vote was
[47:37] he said he saw all the men go in there
[47:39] become crooked and come out
[47:41] now we know that's true with a lot of
[47:42] people but there have been some men that
[47:44] have been able to go in there and
[47:47] have a good testimony right congressman
[47:49] up shaw right
[47:50] saints right he's god honored him so
[47:53] much god healed him and raised him out
[47:54] of a wheelchair
[47:56] now there's maybe some others i'm just
[47:58] gonna name a few names like ron paul
[48:00] seems like he was a godly man or at
[48:02] least to some degree
[48:03] right a righteous man i'll say it like
[48:04] that uh maybe there's some others
[48:08] i personally think mike pence seems like
[48:10] a very honest and righteous man
[48:13] there could be some others okay no doubt
[48:15] about that i don't
[48:17] i wouldn't know any of them anyway but i
[48:20] just want to say
[48:20] something brother ram didn't brag on he
[48:22] didn't brag well i never vote
[48:24] he just uh saw a lot of corruption now i
[48:27] want you to listen to this quote six
[48:28] years later he talks about dwight
[48:30] eisenhower
[48:33] he said i certainly had great admiration
[48:35] for president dwight eisenhower
[48:37] sure i'm sorry sir he has sure
[48:40] been one of great man in my way of
[48:42] thinking if
[48:44] he was running again and i was voting
[48:47] i would vote for him again so brother m6
[48:50] years later earlier said he never voted
[48:53] and then six years later he said it but
[48:55] if eisenhower was running again
[48:57] i'd vote for him why
[49:00] brother ram tells us i don't care if
[49:02] he's 100 years old i still be
[49:04] voting for him because i like him
[49:07] and let's remember him in our prayers
[49:09] tonight
[49:11] so so let's just take let's just take
[49:13] some thought we've heard all these
[49:15] things about voting and
[49:16] brother rand was against voting well no
[49:19] doubt there was some corruption even in
[49:21] their day
[49:22] with voting but he didn't brag about it
[49:25] he didn't brag about not voting
[49:28] um but he said if dwight
[49:31] eisenhower was running for president
[49:34] again
[49:35] he would vote for him now let me uh
[49:38] read a little bit about eisenhower
[49:42] and some of this was shocking to me but
[49:44] some good
[49:45] history
[49:50] so let me read this here um
[49:54] on february 1st 1953
[49:59] 10 days after his inauguration
[50:03] eisenhower was baptized and welcomed
[50:06] into the national
[50:08] presbyterian church
[50:12] by the reverend edward elson
[50:15] eisenhower remains the only president
[50:18] ever to been baptized while in
[50:20] office and his work to link faith and
[50:23] the american identity has influenced
[50:25] political debate in the country
[50:27] for half a century since and this
[50:29] article is on history.com
[50:31] shows how eisenhower had a strong
[50:33] relationship with billy graham
[50:35] although eisenhower was not an
[50:37] evangelical
[50:39] he was a presbyterian
[50:42] so brother branham admired a
[50:45] presbyterian
[50:48] preacher so much now lydia on my phone
[50:50] look up and see what church mike
[50:52] pence belongs to so just take your time
[50:54] i'm not gonna i'm gonna have my daughter
[50:56] look up
[50:56] see what denomination pants belongs to
[50:59] because
[51:00] i don't know if you heard a couple weeks
[51:01] ago donald trump came out and said he
[51:03] wasn't a presbyterian he's an
[51:06] independent
[51:08] and of course eisenhower was a very
[51:10] humble leader um
[51:13] you know leading the the the country
[51:16] through the 50s
[51:19] okay so i just thought i would read that
[51:20] uh just so you know brother branham said
[51:23] he would vote for a presbyterian man
[51:25] because he liked him
[51:28] if he had the chance to do it
[51:31] okay so hopefully that helps out and i
[51:33] just want to read one more scripture too
[51:34] i
[51:35] recall this let's go to daniel 2
[51:38] 21 i'll go there daniel 2 21
[51:47] just because this scripture says god
[51:49] raises up leaders
[51:51] and brings them down
[51:54] yeah so daniel blesses god in verse 20
[51:56] in daniel 2 21
[51:58] and he changes the times and the seasons
[52:00] he removeth kings
[52:02] and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom
[52:04] unto the wise and
[52:05] knowledge to them that no understanding
[52:10] and i'll stop right there because again
[52:12] we see god raises up leaders
[52:14] and then god brings them down he's the
[52:17] one that sets them up
[52:19] all in his wisdom in his sovereign uh
[52:22] eternal wisdom and his godly counsel and
[52:25] his
[52:26] his god counsel he sets them up and
[52:29] brings them down
[52:30] okay did you find anything okay
[52:34] no problem all right so um
[52:39] so see there may be some quotes that
[52:40] make people don't want to vote that's
[52:42] fine but brother brown calls it a
[52:43] birthright so i believe
[52:45] voting is a sacred birthright it's a
[52:48] christian
[52:49] it's a it's an american birthright
[52:51] through the christian faith
[52:53] um and i believe this because many
[52:56] biblical people never lived in a
[52:58] republic
[52:58] like we have they were mainly ruled by
[53:02] tyrants and kings where powers passed
[53:04] down
[53:04] it's not voted upon okay so let me just
[53:07] read a little
[53:08] snippet about america instead of kings
[53:11] who wield
[53:11] absolute power for entire lifetimes
[53:14] america was established as a nation
[53:16] ruled by the people the government's
[53:19] ability to wrest power from the people
[53:20] was reigned in
[53:21] by an ingenious system of checks and
[53:24] balances
[53:25] but what is often missed by people today
[53:27] was the expectation of the founding
[53:29] fathers
[53:31] all of whom held a great reverence for
[53:33] god and scripture
[53:36] that leaders possess a moral compass and
[53:38] that virtue justice and righteousness
[53:41] were essential for government not to
[53:42] trample on the god-given rights of the
[53:45] people
[53:47] george washington warned america in his
[53:49] first inaugural dress
[53:51] never to depart from its founding
[53:53] principles which he clearly believed
[53:56] flowed from god he declared the
[53:59] propitious smiles of heaven can never be
[54:01] expected on a nation
[54:03] that disregards the eternal rules of
[54:06] order and right which heaven itself
[54:09] has ordained there's that word ordained
[54:11] right all the powers
[54:13] of government leaders are ordained of
[54:15] god
[54:17] okay well he was a catholic but now he
[54:20] says he's a born-again
[54:22] evangelical catholic all right
[54:25] so pence used to be a catholic but
[54:27] according to one website he says now
[54:28] he's a
[54:29] born-again evangelical catholic
[54:32] he's a catholic and then he's about an
[54:33] evangelical mega church
[54:35] well i felt like himself a catholic and
[54:36] now yeah he's been born again so he
[54:38] joins
[54:39] part of an evangelical church so that's
[54:42] interesting i still like him uh
[54:44] remember he got a lot of flack a couple
[54:46] years ago a lot of
[54:48] anger in the media because he will
[54:50] refuse to have a meeting one-on-one with
[54:52] a woman
[54:53] that's not his wife he's got to have at
[54:54] least another person in there
[54:56] that's the same standard billy graham
[54:58] always kept during his
[54:59] ministry as well and so i have a lot of
[55:02] uh i like him like with ram said i like
[55:04] i like mike pence
[55:08] so um so i hope that's a help by god's
[55:12] grace hopefully that opens up some
[55:13] people's
[55:14] minds and hearts brother ram said don't
[55:17] even pray for the nation and of course
[55:18] we don't pray for the nation as a whole
[55:20] we pray for individuals within the
[55:22] nation because we know the nation cannot
[55:25] come back to god we know it can't
[55:27] uh because it's gonna be kind of it's
[55:29] gonna become the beast that rises up
[55:31] uh out of the land in revelation 13 so
[55:35] we
[55:35] can't pray for the whole nation because
[55:37] it's not scriptural
[55:39] but we can pray for peace and we can
[55:41] pray for individuals to hear the truth
[55:43] and acknowledge the truth and be
[55:45] saved okay
[55:53] so let me just look at let me just share
[55:54] a few more thoughts um
[55:57] you know brother brown he never saw many
[56:01] men
[56:01] live a godly life in the government and
[56:03] it's true many can't
[56:05] but i just want to say there are
[56:06] scriptures where godly men can
[56:09] keep their testimony in the government
[56:11] government and they did it without the
[56:12] baptism of the holy ghost right
[56:14] joseph in egypt right
[56:18] he lived a very sanctified holy life
[56:22] uh in the government right uh how about
[56:26] daniel and babylon those are just two
[56:28] simple examples
[56:30] no one lived a life like daniel did
[56:32] right him and the three hebrew children
[56:33] what a godly uh honest life
[56:37] that he lived he lived so close to god
[56:39] they tried to kill him falsely
[56:41] he was such a godly man and so we can't
[56:44] say well god would never put anybody in
[56:46] government we can't say that because god
[56:48] is
[56:48] if he's the same yesterday today and
[56:50] forever he has placed men
[56:51] and women sometimes in government
[56:54] remember
[56:54] deborah we preached on deborah last year
[56:56] or may was earlier this year
[56:59] and god allowed or god used her in a
[57:00] great way where the king
[57:02] balak didn't have the faith god used
[57:05] deborah's prophecies to raise his faith
[57:07] and gain the victory a powerful victory
[57:08] for israel
[57:10] and she was in the judicial ranks she
[57:12] was a judge
[57:14] so we cannot say god would never call
[57:17] someone to the government
[57:18] um but we can say if god calls him there
[57:22] god will be able to keep them in the
[57:24] midst of the trials
[57:28] and a couple more things uh you know
[57:29] should christians vote
[57:32] i believe yes i believe it's a sacred a
[57:34] sacred right
[57:35] uh it's a american birthright
[57:38] because what is voting voting is
[57:40] influencing leaders
[57:42] and choosing leaders
[57:45] can anyone think of a godly person who
[57:48] influenced a king or a leader
[57:51] or any government maybe save lives
[57:57] yeah joseph esther that's what i was
[58:00] thinking of esther
[58:02] didn't esther use her influence with the
[58:05] king
[58:07] to save lives well that that's all
[58:10] that's all we that's what our votes do
[58:11] they influence the leaders
[58:13] right um so
[58:16] i look at it like that esther influenced
[58:19] her king
[58:20] we influence our leaders by voting or
[58:22] protesting or
[58:24] emailing them writing letters esther
[58:26] saved lives
[58:28] why didn't god just do it himself why
[58:30] did he have to use the government
[58:32] right what why did god need to use
[58:34] esther well
[58:35] god likes to give people a part in
[58:37] redemption
[58:39] god likes to give them assignments
[58:41] praise god
[58:42] right the bible said he worked with them
[58:44] right
[58:45] they went the disciples went out
[58:47] preaching and the lord worked with them
[58:48] in mark 16.
[58:50] god didn't need esther to save the jews
[58:52] but he used her
[58:53] for such a time as that in the
[58:56] government
[58:58] right through prayer fasting look how
[59:00] prayer and fasting
[59:01] shapes the government
[59:05] so god loves to work with mankind he's
[59:07] the vine
[59:08] we are the branches and i believe we can
[59:12] still save lives by sighing and crying
[59:14] for the abominations done
[59:15] the abortions done and by voting
[59:19] pro-life
[59:20] i still believe all things are possible
[59:22] with god some people may think i'm crazy
[59:24] but i believe that i'm going to keep
[59:25] praying for that
[59:27] i was crying for that today as well
[59:28] signing crying for the abominations
[59:32] let me just give one more example if i
[59:33] lived in california today
[59:36] i'd want to influence my leaders i'd
[59:39] want to vote out the governor
[59:40] i don't know i don't know what his terms
[59:42] up but right because he's forbidding
[59:44] people from from fulfilling the
[59:45] scripture
[59:46] of going to church right and mayors
[59:50] i see we have that right many
[59:52] governments
[59:53] over the years never had that right the
[59:55] people didn't have that right
[59:57] but we have the right so if i lived
[1:00:00] there i would pray of course
[1:00:02] pray for peace and pray for the laws to
[1:00:04] change and the mandates to end
[1:00:06] but then i would go on vote because
[1:00:08] they're forbidding
[1:00:10] me of my god-given rights they're
[1:00:14] causing me to try to
[1:00:15] or to break hebrews 10 24 to 26 it says
[1:00:18] gather more
[1:00:19] as you see that day approaching
[1:00:22] and so we'll see if the lord tarries
[1:00:23] we'll see if god will raise up
[1:00:25] people to vote out those leaders and
[1:00:28] bring in leaders that will give them
[1:00:29] their rights back
[1:00:31] we'll see it's all in god's hands
[1:00:34] and then remember proverbs 14 34
[1:00:36] righteousness
[1:00:37] exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to
[1:00:41] any people that's why
[1:00:42] i pray we pray for the most righteous
[1:00:44] leaders to be elected
[1:00:46] now god may allow unrighteous ones we've
[1:00:48] seen that over the years
[1:00:51] but we should pray for peace pray for
[1:00:54] the most righteous leaders
[1:00:58] okay
[1:01:01] so god is the one who places governments
[1:01:03] over us and
[1:01:04] we're just we're just fortunate in
[1:01:06] america that we have a say-so
[1:01:09] at times for our leaders
[1:01:13] now this whole sermon kind of came from
[1:01:15] this
[1:01:16] this idea i was listening to thirst
[1:01:20] 1965 and i heard brother brown say these
[1:01:22] words
[1:01:23] where is our patrick henry's
[1:01:26] he says where is our abraham lincoln's
[1:01:29] he says where is our john quincy adams i
[1:01:31] don't know if i've mentioned that in the
[1:01:33] last few months but
[1:01:34] this whole thing came from that i've
[1:01:36] just had that thought on my mind
[1:01:38] um so i want to go through some quotes
[1:01:40] and a little bit of history here
[1:01:41] uh as we move on how much time do i got
[1:01:43] lydia for 40 minutes
[1:01:46] six minutes okay so i got about six
[1:01:48] minutes time at 40.
[1:01:50] maybe i'll go a little bit over that by
[1:01:51] god's grace
[1:01:55] so i want to look at a little bit of
[1:01:56] history and look at there's
[1:01:58] um there's five quotes
[1:02:01] where brother ran talks about this idea
[1:02:03] and it's all at the end of his message
[1:02:06] the first one is in august 64 then
[1:02:08] they're just
[1:02:09] spread out here the rest of his life
[1:02:12] 64-65
[1:02:14] so five times he says this about where
[1:02:17] are the godly men
[1:02:19] in one case he says we need those kind
[1:02:21] of men
[1:02:22] and you'll be surprised maybe about what
[1:02:23] they did
[1:02:26] um so see uh i want to just
[1:02:29] bring a balance to this so these are
[1:02:31] quotes maybe people never have read
[1:02:33] right or not
[1:02:34] never preached or never heard and so we
[1:02:36] want to understand the context of them
[1:02:40] so the first quote uh brother does tell
[1:02:43] us about the government the majority of
[1:02:44] people won't be turned
[1:02:47] uh but he is um
[1:02:50] he says there's few people that will
[1:02:52] stand for principles and
[1:02:54] convictions and godliness so let's let's
[1:02:56] let's uh let me read this to you
[1:02:59] he says there will never never never
[1:03:01] come salvation to the world anymore
[1:03:03] they've passed their line between grace
[1:03:04] and judgment
[1:03:06] you might put abraham lincoln in every
[1:03:08] country in the united states
[1:03:09] every county in the united states it'll
[1:03:11] never turn this
[1:03:12] bunch of rickies and elvises back to god
[1:03:17] so he says you can put godly leaders
[1:03:18] there but it'll never
[1:03:21] bring the overall majority back to god
[1:03:26] he says oh how this world is
[1:03:27] contaminated there's a lot of hope for
[1:03:29] it all
[1:03:30] they've crossed the dividing line
[1:03:31] between reason and common sense
[1:03:33] let alone between salvation men
[1:03:37] can't even judge we don't have men no
[1:03:39] more like we used to have
[1:03:41] where's patrick henry where's abraham
[1:03:43] lincoln
[1:03:44] men that can stand for solid convictions
[1:03:48] whereas that man can raise up and make
[1:03:51] these crazy women out there stripping
[1:03:52] themselves off out before these men then
[1:03:55] and run them out there like a bunch of
[1:03:56] striptease and then they put the boy in
[1:03:59] a penitentiary that's
[1:04:00] insult one of them where's your reasons
[1:04:02] where's your common sense
[1:04:05] where's the laws that could stop it
[1:04:09] and then he tells a story
[1:04:12] where a policeman was fired for
[1:04:14] arresting a morally dressed woman
[1:04:16] in louisville kentucky he said a couple
[1:04:19] weeks ago so
[1:04:20] july 64. he said god help a nation that
[1:04:25] that rotten you can't get by unless you
[1:04:27] do wrong
[1:04:29] we might not get by but we can get up
[1:04:31] and that's where we're looking
[1:04:33] let's bow our heads now he this is the
[1:04:35] close of his sermon
[1:04:36] my questions answers part one he said
[1:04:39] lord jesus let the great shepherd come
[1:04:41] and take us out of this lord we're
[1:04:42] waiting for him
[1:04:44] wow so just seeing that a police officer
[1:04:46] getting fired
[1:04:47] for trying to arrest an indecently
[1:04:50] dressed woman
[1:04:51] made brother branham want to go to
[1:04:52] heaven in the rapture take us out of
[1:04:55] here
[1:04:56] we're waiting for him we're watching for
[1:04:58] that hour when we see the world so
[1:04:59] corrupt you said it would be this way
[1:05:01] your great prophets prophesied that
[1:05:03] these hours would be here we believe the
[1:05:05] prophets lord we believe it
[1:05:06] and now we pray god that you'll give us
[1:05:08] prophets to interpret this word to us
[1:05:10] that we might know
[1:05:11] whether we are right or wrong
[1:05:17] okay so brother bran's prayer goes god
[1:05:20] we want to leave this place but we want
[1:05:22] to know we're right or wrong we want to
[1:05:24] know the truth
[1:05:25] and how many can say amen to that amen
[1:05:27] praise god
[1:05:29] now here's a short biography on patrick
[1:05:31] henry
[1:05:33] he was a founding father his main job
[1:05:36] was a criminal attorney
[1:05:39] before the revolution he rode 50 miles
[1:05:43] on horseback to be a lawyer for three
[1:05:46] baptist preachers
[1:05:48] that were on trial in 1768 for preaching
[1:05:51] things that weren't allowed to be
[1:05:52] preached in the british colonies
[1:05:56] and god honored him he won the he won
[1:05:58] the trial
[1:06:00] and the baptist preachers didn't go to
[1:06:02] jail
[1:06:04] later he served five terms as a governor
[1:06:08] of virginia
[1:06:09] he sponsored the armed resistance of the
[1:06:11] revolution against
[1:06:12] great britain he gave the famous
[1:06:16] give me liberty or give me death speech
[1:06:19] and here's a little bit of it i hope i
[1:06:23] can find it here
[1:06:27] yeah let me pull up let me read a little
[1:06:29] bit of that quote here
[1:06:32] okay now
[1:06:35] in his give me liberty or give me death
[1:06:37] speech
[1:06:38] he quotes jeremiah the book of jeremiah
[1:06:41] and matthew the book of matthew
[1:06:44] brother where is our patrick henry's
[1:06:48] that'll stand up for truth
[1:06:51] he says it is vain sir to accentuate the
[1:06:53] matter
[1:06:54] gentlemen may cry peace peace but there
[1:06:56] is no peace the war has
[1:06:57] actually begun it's about the
[1:06:58] revolutionary war against britain
[1:07:01] or great britain the next gale that
[1:07:03] sweeps from the north will bring to our
[1:07:05] ears the clash of resounding arms
[1:07:07] our brethren already already in the
[1:07:09] field why stand
[1:07:10] life so dear or peace so sweet as to be
[1:07:12] purchased at the price
[1:07:14] of chains and slavery forbid it almighty
[1:07:17] god
[1:07:19] i know not what course others may take
[1:07:22] but as for me give me liberty or give me
[1:07:24] death
[1:07:26] he didn't want to live in the chains of
[1:07:28] tyranny
[1:07:29] of great britain and their king uh
[1:07:32] and their state church which i believe
[1:07:35] was anglican if not mistaken
[1:07:38] so these are the famous words give me
[1:07:40] liberty let me fight for my freedoms
[1:07:42] to worship god and to have our own
[1:07:45] country or give me death the man says
[1:07:47] where's our men like that
[1:07:48] that will stand for convictions
[1:07:55] okay he also mentioned abraham lincoln
[1:08:00] of course abraham lincoln was the 16th
[1:08:01] president uh our leader during the civil
[1:08:04] war
[1:08:05] now the civil war began one month after
[1:08:07] he took office and ended five days
[1:08:09] before
[1:08:10] he died six hundred thousand americans
[1:08:14] lost their lives
[1:08:16] in his second uh presidential
[1:08:19] inaugural address he quoted matthew
[1:08:22] 18 7 and also psalms 19 9.
[1:08:26] matthew 18 7 woe into the world because
[1:08:29] of offenses for it must needs be that
[1:08:31] offenses come
[1:08:32] but woe to that man by whom the offense
[1:08:35] cometh
[1:08:36] it's quoting the lord jesus christ we
[1:08:39] know offenses are going to come
[1:08:40] but let's not be the one making the
[1:08:42] offenses that's what abraham lincoln
[1:08:44] taught
[1:08:46] and then he quoted psalms 19 9 the lord
[1:08:49] is clean and during
[1:08:52] enduring forever i'm sorry the word of
[1:08:53] the lord is clean enduring forever
[1:08:55] the judgments of the lord are true and
[1:08:57] righteous
[1:08:58] all together
[1:09:04] okay so um
[1:09:13] abraham lincoln often addressed god in
[1:09:16] his speeches
[1:09:18] we know we did that often uh there's a
[1:09:21] couple examples here but i'm not just
[1:09:23] for time's sake i'm not going to read
[1:09:24] them
[1:09:24] i'm sorry they're both from his second
[1:09:26] inaugural address where he
[1:09:28] uh quotes the scriptures and if god's
[1:09:30] will
[1:09:31] be done speaking of the judgments of the
[1:09:34] lord
[1:09:37] in his last speech he he was setting the
[1:09:40] tone for the plan for the nation's
[1:09:42] reconstruction right the nation been
[1:09:44] torn apart through civil war
[1:09:46] in his last speech before he was killed
[1:09:48] in his inaugural uh
[1:09:50] second inaugural address was this
[1:09:53] he says with malice toward none with
[1:09:56] charity for all
[1:09:57] that's not like the scripture charity
[1:09:58] for all love all
[1:10:00] with firmness in the right as god gives
[1:10:03] us to see the right
[1:10:06] right so he says god help us to see
[1:10:08] what's right
[1:10:09] let us strive on to finish the work
[1:10:11] we're in to bind up the nation's wounds
[1:10:13] to care for him who shall born the
[1:10:15] battle
[1:10:16] and force widown for his orphan to do
[1:10:18] all which may achieve and cherish a just
[1:10:20] and a lasting peace
[1:10:22] among ourselves and with all nations
[1:10:24] peace see peace
[1:10:26] that's what the bible says peace is such
[1:10:28] a blessing
[1:10:32] all right so brother man says where's
[1:10:34] men like this that will pray for peace
[1:10:35] pray for healing
[1:10:36] and of course abraham lincoln stood he
[1:10:38] stood between the north and south and
[1:10:40] kept the country together that's why
[1:10:41] they fight it
[1:10:42] they fought the civil war to keep the
[1:10:44] states united
[1:10:45] in a federal government
[1:10:51] and so that's the first quote with some
[1:10:53] short biographies about
[1:10:55] cement here's a second one this is
[1:10:59] the oddball actually this is the first
[1:11:01] one but as far as chronological order
[1:11:04] do you know the politicians can't judge
[1:11:06] right or wrong you see them keeping
[1:11:08] quiet on this voting the bible back into
[1:11:10] the
[1:11:10] school they don't know which way the
[1:11:12] politics are going to blow
[1:11:14] think of it i don't know how it is in
[1:11:16] indiana now but the state of arizona
[1:11:17] it's against the law to read the bible
[1:11:19] in school
[1:11:20] i think it's the same thing in indiana
[1:11:21] nearly the whole united states because
[1:11:23] some infidel women
[1:11:24] changed the whole program and remember
[1:11:26] it's against the law to read the bible
[1:11:28] in our public schools but believers
[1:11:29] taxes
[1:11:30] supports infidelity to be taught in the
[1:11:32] school
[1:11:33] right like such sex education and evil
[1:11:35] things like that you can't read the
[1:11:36] bible
[1:11:37] but bible believers pay taxes so the
[1:11:40] schools can
[1:11:41] continue and they teach sex education
[1:11:44] immoral acts
[1:11:47] politics he said we need another abraham
[1:11:50] lincoln brother am says that
[1:11:52] we need another patrick henry we need an
[1:11:55] american who can stand out regardless of
[1:11:57] where the politics
[1:11:58] are and call right right and wrong wrong
[1:12:02] we need more men like that
[1:12:05] did you know preachers they can't judge
[1:12:07] which is right the word of god or the
[1:12:08] church denomination
[1:12:10] they don't know which road to take they
[1:12:11] can't judge between right and wrong i
[1:12:13] know the bible says it but our church
[1:12:14] says see
[1:12:15] people are not capable of judging right
[1:12:17] from wrong and anything that's contrary
[1:12:19] to the bible
[1:12:20] is wrong god's word is right and every
[1:12:22] man's word is a lie that's contrary to
[1:12:24] it
[1:12:26] and to try to stand upon a time like
[1:12:28] that to stand for what's right
[1:12:30] you become a nut how many nuts we got
[1:12:32] out there i know i'm one of those nuts
[1:12:33] by god's grace
[1:12:35] hallelujah standing upon god's word
[1:12:38] believing god's word teaching god's word
[1:12:41] only the bible's right hallelujah
[1:12:47] here's another one and here's where
[1:12:49] brother brown brings up john quincy
[1:12:50] adams
[1:12:52] and arnold von winklereed
[1:12:57] okay this is from uh 1965 an oath and
[1:12:59] not
[1:13:00] the mental faculties and reasons of man
[1:13:02] is broke down
[1:13:04] there's no hopes it's beyond hope the
[1:13:06] whole thing is a reputation sore
[1:13:08] the mental faculties of man they can't
[1:13:10] make decisions
[1:13:12] i'm not i'm not a politician he says i
[1:13:15] don't neither democrat or republican
[1:13:17] they're all filthy
[1:13:18] i'm for one kingdom and that's the
[1:13:20] kingdom of jesus christ that's all
[1:13:23] but how in the world did you ever see a
[1:13:24] bunch of puppets like we got up there
[1:13:26] now like the bunch of texans we got in
[1:13:27] there
[1:13:28] why they say whatever the people wants
[1:13:30] if they want communism we'll give them
[1:13:31] communism
[1:13:32] if they want integration we'll give them
[1:13:34] integration want segregation we'll give
[1:13:35] them whatever did it
[1:13:37] where is man he says oh god that's like
[1:13:41] the pulpit
[1:13:42] where is man man that's man that stands
[1:13:44] for a principle where's woman that
[1:13:46] stands for principle so now he calls
[1:13:47] women into it too
[1:13:49] where's a church that stands for a
[1:13:51] principle
[1:13:52] i ain't got a nickel's worth of time for
[1:13:54] a wishy-washy given compromising spirit
[1:13:58] a woman is a woman let her be a lady if
[1:14:00] a man is a man let him be a man
[1:14:02] if he's a president where is our john
[1:14:04] quincy adams
[1:14:05] he says where's our abraham lincoln's
[1:14:08] men of the principle
[1:14:09] where's our patrick henry that said give
[1:14:11] me liberty or give me death
[1:14:12] where's a man that stands for what's
[1:14:14] right
[1:14:16] where's a man that's not afraid to speak
[1:14:17] out regardless the whole world's against
[1:14:20] him
[1:14:20] speak out what for what's right and
[1:14:22] stand for it and die for it
[1:14:25] where is our arnold von winklereed again
[1:14:28] today where's our men of integrity
[1:14:30] where's men with spirit they're so
[1:14:32] wishy-washy and gummed up until they
[1:14:34] don't know where they stand
[1:14:35] god let me stand with the principles of
[1:14:38] one man as a minister
[1:14:39] the word of jesus christ for heavens and
[1:14:42] earth will pass away but it'll never
[1:14:43] fail on this rock i'll build my church
[1:14:45] and the gates of hell should not prevail
[1:14:48] against it in that powerful
[1:14:49] wow who was john quincy adams he was our
[1:14:52] sixth president
[1:14:53] the son of the second president john
[1:14:55] adams and you know what
[1:14:57] he wasn't a trinitarian amen
[1:15:01] according to this article about him he
[1:15:03] was a unitarian
[1:15:04] but he wasn't a trinitarian so god bless
[1:15:06] him for that
[1:15:07] he staunchly opposed slavery even fought
[1:15:11] against it in the
[1:15:12] court system one article says of all
[1:15:16] american presidents
[1:15:17] john quincy adam was perhaps the most
[1:15:19] deeply immersed in scripture
[1:15:21] and in christian theology he read the
[1:15:23] bible virtually every morning of his
[1:15:25] life
[1:15:26] and went to church without fail on the
[1:15:27] sabbath often attending two
[1:15:28] circumstances every
[1:15:30] every sabbath oh my
[1:15:34] the man says where's men like this that
[1:15:37] will stand up
[1:15:38] against the evils why didn't you sit
[1:15:39] back and say oh you guys can take care
[1:15:41] of slavery
[1:15:42] no he stood up against slavery right
[1:15:46] just like with the other ones uh why
[1:15:49] didn't patrick henry
[1:15:51] if government's so bad why do you sit
[1:15:52] back and say oh it's okay we'll just
[1:15:54] stay under the great
[1:15:55] great britain we'll just we'll live
[1:15:56] under them
[1:15:58] no he recognized the freedoms that jesus
[1:16:01] christ died for to get
[1:16:03] to give us the freedoms and he stood up
[1:16:05] for it so we could have it
[1:16:06] enjoy those freedoms see that's why i
[1:16:09] don't believe in standing back and not
[1:16:11] voting and doing nothing and not even
[1:16:13] praying
[1:16:13] for the nation i believe we should pray
[1:16:15] i believe we should vote we should do
[1:16:17] all we can
[1:16:18] within our power these men brother
[1:16:20] brahms calls by name
[1:16:22] they didn't sit back and do nothing they
[1:16:24] were active
[1:16:25] uh in their faith and in their political
[1:16:28] uh positions that god ordained now most
[1:16:31] of us are not political
[1:16:32] positions that doesn't mean we shouldn't
[1:16:35] pray for them
[1:16:35] we should constantly pray for people in
[1:16:38] political positions
[1:16:43] all right that was the third one
[1:16:47] who was arnold von winklery my brother
[1:16:49] man tells a story about him
[1:16:51] uh it's hard to say whether he was he's
[1:16:53] from switzerland
[1:16:54] um some people say well he's a legend so
[1:16:57] he's made up others people say he's a
[1:16:58] real person
[1:17:00] okay but but in 1386
[1:17:03] according to this uh brother ram story
[1:17:05] and of course you know historians that
[1:17:07] believe it's true
[1:17:08] he sacrificed his own life to change the
[1:17:10] situation of a battle
[1:17:13] and it ultimately led
[1:17:18] to victory for the swiss forces okay so
[1:17:20] he basically ran into some spears and he
[1:17:22] took out some people
[1:17:24] while he did it and that opened up that
[1:17:27] opened up
[1:17:27] the soldier so then the swiss could come
[1:17:29] in and defeat them
[1:17:30] i actually physically went in and
[1:17:33] divided them so that
[1:17:35] his army could get the victory brother
[1:17:37] says where's men like that
[1:17:39] and i guess his last words before he
[1:17:40] went and died was
[1:17:42] take care of my wife and children
[1:17:43] because today i'm going to save
[1:17:45] switzerland
[1:17:46] so brother ramsey says where's men like
[1:17:47] that they'll stand up for freedoms and
[1:17:50] truth
[1:17:52] the memory said we need them for all
[1:17:54] those people that say i believe every
[1:17:55] quote
[1:17:56] well there's a quote we need more men
[1:17:58] like that we need men like john quincy
[1:18:00] adams right we need men like abraham
[1:18:02] lincoln
[1:18:05] all right i got two more quotes and i
[1:18:08] can finish this here
[1:18:10] uh tonight by god's grace
[1:18:15] okay so let's fast forward to thirst
[1:18:17] this is the one that i listened to
[1:18:20] now you cannot pull sin through the
[1:18:22] pages of the bible
[1:18:24] no it stops it it filters it out now you
[1:18:26] can go to church and just take anything
[1:18:27] but you can't come through this bible
[1:18:29] and have sin it will not do it
[1:18:31] it filters out all sin and it gives a
[1:18:33] holy man's takes
[1:18:34] because if the man is thinking that he
[1:18:36] wants to be holy and be like god and be
[1:18:38] a son or a daughter of god
[1:18:39] then he wants the right kind of a filter
[1:18:42] so he stops all sin on this side of the
[1:18:44] bible
[1:18:44] and he can only bring the holy spirit
[1:18:46] through the bible that
[1:18:48] wrote the bible it's a holy man's taste
[1:18:50] to have this thinking man's filter
[1:18:53] now we find how deceiving is today
[1:18:55] matthew 24 24 jesus said in the last
[1:18:58] days
[1:18:58] the two spirits would be so close alike
[1:19:00] until they would deceive them very
[1:19:01] elected if it was possible
[1:19:03] how close what a deception of a right
[1:19:06] and wrong we have today
[1:19:08] even in our government he goes now in
[1:19:11] our politics we
[1:19:12] haven't even got a man that we could put
[1:19:14] up as a politician that will absolutely
[1:19:16] stand up for what he thinks is right
[1:19:18] where's our patrick henry's in george
[1:19:20] washington's abraham lincoln's up today
[1:19:23] just as our president said there the way
[1:19:25] if they want communism they can have it
[1:19:27] whatever the people
[1:19:28] wants if that ain't a man that won't
[1:19:31] speak his conviction a man that will
[1:19:33] stand up on a principle that will stand
[1:19:35] on what's
[1:19:36] what's a principle just want to go the
[1:19:39] way of least resistance rather man says
[1:19:40] most
[1:19:41] politicians go the way of least
[1:19:43] resistance rather than standing on the
[1:19:45] principles of god
[1:19:48] and he says that's the way the people's
[1:19:49] got in the church they want to come join
[1:19:51] a church and say oh well that's it i
[1:19:53] joined church for now
[1:19:55] you're trying to satisfy that great holy
[1:19:57] thirst that god put in you that control
[1:19:58] tower
[1:19:59] trying to turn you to the right thing
[1:20:01] and to try to satisfy with joining a
[1:20:03] church quoting a creed or something like
[1:20:04] that
[1:20:05] when it's nothing but the very presence
[1:20:07] and filling of god himself in your life
[1:20:08] that will satisfy that praise god
[1:20:11] don't be satisfied with joining a church
[1:20:12] be satisfied
[1:20:14] with becoming a church or being baptized
[1:20:16] with the holy ghost in the church of the
[1:20:18] firstborn praise god
[1:20:19] the church of jesus christ that's the
[1:20:22] only thing that will satisfy that thirst
[1:20:24] inside of you
[1:20:25] is jesus christ's own spirit abiding in
[1:20:28] your soul leading and guiding
[1:20:29] you every single day
[1:20:37] all right
[1:20:40] of course we know there's a lot of
[1:20:41] people today that want socialism
[1:20:44] in america so we pray against that
[1:20:46] that's had
[1:20:47] awful effects all over the world um
[1:20:52] so of course we pray against that i'm
[1:20:54] not going to get into that but brother
[1:20:55] talked about communism and
[1:20:56] socialism is close to that but not the
[1:20:59] same thing
[1:21:00] um a marxist theory but we will not go
[1:21:03] into that tonight i'm not really ready
[1:21:05] to preach on that but
[1:21:06] just so you know those things are rising
[1:21:07] up in america so where is our
[1:21:10] john uh quincy adams where's our patrick
[1:21:13] henry's that'll speak out against that
[1:21:15] the evils of that system
[1:21:17] so we have to pray against it we have to
[1:21:19] encourage our leaders to speak out
[1:21:20] against it
[1:21:22] last quote and then we'll be finished
[1:21:24] here by god's grace uh this is from
[1:21:26] leadership a couple weeks before brother
[1:21:28] brandon passed away
[1:21:29] he said oh god take us back to eden
[1:21:32] again
[1:21:32] lord where there's no death no sorrow
[1:21:34] granite lord we stand
[1:21:36] humbly waiting for the second adam to
[1:21:38] come for his bride make us a part of him
[1:21:40] father we pray in jesus name
[1:21:42] amen he's closing the sermon he said do
[1:21:44] you love god

[1:21:46] trying to tell you if you can understand
[1:21:48] raise your hand say i understand what
[1:21:50] you're saying can you see the insanity
[1:21:52] of this age
[1:21:55] he said look how it's gone even there's
[1:21:57] no reasons among the people no more
[1:22:00] he says even our leaders he said look at
[1:22:03] our president if they want communism let
[1:22:05] them have it
[1:22:06] whatever the people wants let them have
[1:22:07] it where's our patrick henry's our
[1:22:09] george washington's
[1:22:10] where's our leaders that can stand for a
[1:22:12] principle we haven't got them no more
[1:22:14] and they're very few and far between
[1:22:19] where's our churches our ministers we'll
[1:22:22] take the people in just on probation or
[1:22:24] come in and join the church
[1:22:25] and do this or have a little sensation
[1:22:27] or something where's those men of god
[1:22:29] those prophets
[1:22:30] that stand out and dare to defy all the
[1:22:32] things of the world
[1:22:33] amen where's men of integrity where are
[1:22:36] they at they're so soft and
[1:22:38] through intellectual conception so
[1:22:40] they're not here no more oh god have
[1:22:41] mercy on us
[1:22:44] he says these hideous things that are
[1:22:45] coming upon the earth you can see how
[1:22:47] the people's moving right into it
[1:22:48] it's an insanity when the thing strikes
[1:22:51] the church will be gone hallelujah
[1:22:54] he said god let us be there that's my
[1:22:57] prayer to the great supernatural being
