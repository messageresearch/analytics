TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there. They took me back and showed me when this Donnie Martin, how many rate readers digest when Mles are turned down and everything and to come out there to California down out of Canada, the Lord healing made him well. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the [music] Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to give a response about the questions surrounding the Donnie Morton [music] story. as brother Brandham has been accused of having a thus sayith the Lord that failed. So this is a question I've got numerous times over the years. It's a fair question of course and obviously I don't think a thus sayith the Lord from brother Brandham failed [music] because I have seven thus sayith the Lord prophecies from William Brandham God's true [music] prophet that have come to pass already. And this video then will give my honest thoughts on what's been a confusing story to me for a couple years here. This video then is a defense of God's prophet, [music] Brother William Brham, as a true genuine Bible-based prophet of God who fulfilled numerous scriptures such as Revelation 10:7, finishing the mystery of God, Malachi 45:5 and 6, turning our hearts back to the apostolic fathers, Luke 17:30, the son of man being revealed, a son of man revealing the son of man, the prophetic gift in brother Ram's life, discerning the thoughts intents of the heart as the Lord Jesus did Matthew 17:11, Elijah coming and restoring all things, of course, restoring the book of Acts and the Apostolic Faith. I preached Brother Am's Bible Revelation since 2004. Written two books about his ministry, built my entire life and ministry on the Bible teachings and Bible revelations of God's prophet, Brother William Brandham. So, here's the outline, friends, for the video. We'll look at important points. Second, we'll look at the character of Brother Brandham. Third, we'll look at the character of some of Brother Ram's accusers. Fourth, we'll look at the accusation. And then fifth, we'll look at the possible explanations. And which explanation I think is most plausible. So, let's begin with important points. The most important point, I think, is that we do not have the original official thus sayith the Lord statement about Donnie Morton's healing on tape. If there was such a statement, this means that brother Ram was trying to remember the prophecy to the best of his ability, if it was indeed spoken about little Donnie Morton. This could be similar to the prophecies about the seven major visions of 1933 because they were not recorded in 1933 and therefore brother was trying his best to recall them. A second important point is that it seems Brother M didn't understand the Reader Digest article completely because the article never says Donnie had a miracle. It says the miracle was that Donniey's sickness increased awareness of a new brain surgery procedure that could save the lives of sick children in the future. I'm going to quote the Reader Digest article. quote, "The personal miracle Morton sought that his child's life be saved was denied, but out of his search for it, came another miracle." End quote. So, we don't have the official thus sayith the Lord on Donnie Morton on tape. And it seems Brother Bill Ram didn't quite understand the full article. And that's also true because Voice of God has never recognized this either. They posted the full article of Donnie Morton on their website and just simply said, "Get tissues ready." So, even Voice of God doesn't seem to understand the article. Donnie Morton never got the miracle. And then third, most preachers have never recognized that the article doesn't say Donnie had his healing miracle either. I'm not trying to bash preachers or Voice of God recordings. I'm just making important points and observations. Very few people seem to actually read the article. Another important point is that the Reader's Digest article never says, "Thus sayeth the Lord, that Donnie would be made well." And this connects to the Carol Ruth Strubler story from 1955, which I made a video about, I believe last year, if I'm not mistaken, or the year before, from 1955 when Brother Random expected her to be healed, but it seems she passed away. If the Reader Digest article is right, then Brother Ram was just trying to be positive, just trying to give hope. And that seems like that's where brother Brandham was at in his healing ministry. Remember, if you listen to Works as Faith Express 1965, Brother Ram said he grew in his understanding of divine healing. I'd like to make a video about that in the future, Lord willing. He grew so much about divine healing. At the beginning of his ministry, Brother Ram would say any positive attitude toward a promise of God would bring it to pass. And he was speaking about divine healing. But then at the end of his ministry, he learned he had to wait on God in order to know the Lord's will for certain situations, such as with Sister Stad's baby who died in Germany. And they were willing to fly Brother Brandham to Germany to pray for the dead baby. But brother waited on a direct cut decision from God. And God said, "No, this is my hand. Bury the baby." So for Sister Stad, it didn't matter how positive in her mind she was toward the promise of God for raising the dead. God does raise the dead, but she had to look at the will of God for her life. And the will of God for her life was for God to take the baby home. And therefore, that shows Brother Ram grew in his understanding on divine healing. If you notice towards the end of his ministry, he didn't use that phrase very often after 1963. any positive attitude toward a promise of God would bring it to pass. And that's one point that the video will make, Lord willing, in the future. And the final point I want to make is that one of the accusers of Brother Brandham claims to have spoken to Donnie Morton's family member who said Donnie Morton was never healed. And if Donniey's parents would have known, Brother Brandham claimed Donnie was healed, they would have spoke up about it. Now, let's move on to the character of Brother William Brandham. Brother William Brandham had holy ghost impeccable character. His life was free from scandals unlike the many false teachers and false prophets we see today such as Benny Hinn, Todd White, Steve Lawson, TD Jake, Philip Yansy, Robbie Zachcharias, and so many more men caught up in disgraceful sin and abomination. Brother Ram is the most faithful Bible teacher and Bible prophet I've ever heard. He meets all the qualifications to be a prophet. He has seven thus sayith the Lords that came to pass. Fulfilling Deuteronomy 18 19-22. He revealed the secrets of the Bible. Fulfilling Amos 3:7. He lived a godly life with good fruits, fulfilling 1 Corinthians 9 15-27 and Matthew 7:15-23. He had much fruit to his ministry such as souls one. He taught the word in its purity, and he had supernatural works, dreams, and visions, proving God spoke to him. I wrote an entire chapter about Brother Ram's ministry in my 2021 book, The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed. You can listen to that here on YouTube. It shows all the Bible verses Brother Ram fulfilled, how he had, thus sayeth the Lord, how he had impeccable Christian character. One thing I'd just like to mention is that on many of Brother Ram's sermons, he spends lots of time praying for the sick in the prayer lines, joyfully singing to Jesus at the end of sermons, sometimes in tears, pleading with sinners to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, and then praying for them to be baptized with the Holy Ghost in their souls. Here we see the true character of a humble servant of God. Let's move on to the character of some of the accusers of brother Brandham. Friends, some, not all, of Brother Ram's accusers are deep in debauchery and sin. For example, some of them support non-binary relationships. That's what they say on their podcasts. Some of them admit to watching filthy Hollywood movies that use cuss words, have sex scenes, murders, and more. Some of them describe their podcast and videos about Brother Brandham as being juicy, which is gossip-like terminology. They talk about how they enjoy vampires and vampire movies, Halloween, rock and roll, all of these obvious sins, and yet they're the ones attacking a man who pleaded with sinners to repent, prayed for their sicknesses, pleaded with them to be baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. On top of all that, they have all these false Bible doctrines such as there's only one work of grace, which is so silly to believe that children receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost as soon as they repent. Let's say they're five or six years old. They say a scripted sinner's prayer and then they're filled with the Holy Ghost. By their fruits, they're known. So, they deny the three works of grace, which is a sin. They say women can cut their hair despite Paul forbidding it in 1 Corinthians 11. They say God is three persons, which adds to the Bible without any scripture that says God's three persons. And then they jump to all these false conclusions. They say Brother Brandham plagiarized the seven seals, which I've already shown to be false. There's over 38 differences between Brother Brandham's revelation on the seven seals versus Clarence Larkin and Charles Tase Russell's teachings. And they won't even address one of those 38 differences in any of their videos or podcasts. To me, that's cowardly. They falsely accused Brother Brandham of being a racist. Brother Brandham was raised to be racist, but the Holy Ghost changed his heart. And I have a video about that as well. The false racism accusation if you'd like to watch that. They falsely say that he influenced Jim Jones to do what he did in Guyana. That's a bunch of nonsense. I have videos about that. proving that Jim Jones rejected the Bible became an awful, wicked, sexual deviant cult leader. Jim Jones did not like Brother Brandham as proven by audio tape. Jim Jones was a cult leader who accepted worship. That's also on tape. Brother Ram never supported that. So, I'll stop right there, friends. But we can see the character of some of Brother Ram's accusers show corrupt fruit. By their fruit, they are known. Now, let's look at the accusation against brother Brandham. The accusation is that how could brother Rams thus sayith the Lord that Donnie would be healed fail if he was a true prophet of God and he gave Donnie Morton a thus sayith the Lord that the little boy would be healed then why did he die? That's a fair accusation. Let's look at some of the points in particular. The accusers say brother Ram said the Lord healed him and made him well. That's true. Brother Ram said that in 1960. Abraham, he said, quote, they took me back and showed me when this Donnie Morton, the Lord healed him, made him well. End quote. Second, they said, Brother Bram said the boy was wearing shoes the next day after he prayed for him. Brother Ram did say that in be not afraid it is eye in 1960. Quote, he went right straight from that meeting that night and bought Donnie his first pair of shoes and he wore them the next day. End quote. Third, they said, Brother Ram said, "It got so he could run, meet his daddy, and everything." That's true. Brother Ram said that in demonology, 1953, quote, "and the baby come out of it." And so they had the baby around here. It got so he could run, meet his daddy, and everything. End quote. And fourth, they say, "Brother Ram said, thus sayith the Lord, the boy will be healed." Now, I couldn't find that quote, but Brother Ram did say 1964, his unfailing words of promise. quote, and you've seen it in the Reader's Digest not long ago. Donnie Morton, the miracle of Donnie Morton, that child was so twisted and afflicted till even John Hopkins and Mayo brothers said, "There's not an earthly chance for him, but the Lord is thus sayeth the Lord. That was different." See, end quote. So, those are true quotes, it seems, from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. Now, the Reader Digest articles totally different. First, it says, "Donnie only began to improve slightly after the operation." And that's true. That's what the article says. The article second says Donnie was never able to walk or run. The best he was able to do was stretch out his arms in bed to reach for his parents. That's true. That's what the article says. And third, Donnie Morton died the same year and never fully recovered according to the article. That's what the article says. So, please read the article. If I'm wrong on anything, please let me know. But I've read the article a number of times. Now, before moving to the final section, I want to read this quote from Demonology 1953. This is really interesting. And then this is the most important quote on this topic because it shows the difference between Brother Bram's perspective and the Reader's Digest perspective. Brother Bram said, quote, "The daddy went back to plant his spring wheat or something another. Now, here's what the digest didn't get. See what didn't picture, but we had to know behind because if you did that, a hospital would bring suit against this paper." And there's where it would be. A slip up come. Somebody left a window up one night and throwed a draft across the baby and the baby taken pneumonia and lived about two days with the pneumonia, not with the disease with the pneumonia killed the baby. The reader's digest give it. Then it goes ahead and gives a nice good write up about the miracle was already performed anyhow. End quote. So here, brother Random says that the reader digest didn't tell the full truth of the story. So that's his perspective. Brother R's perspective was Donnie Morton was healed but while he was recovering in the hospital Donnie Morton caught pneumonia and then died of pneumonia not of the brain disease that he had. So here we see the conflict. The conflict is between Reader Digest article and Brother Ram's perspective of the story and what happened. So let's go to the final section here. Possible explanations. The only possible explanations I'm willing to look at are the ones that assume brother Brandham was a faithful, genuine, true prophet of God, as I believe and as his character demonstrates. Again, we have seven thus sayith the Lord prophecies that already came to pass. Brother Ram is very trustworthy with thus sayeth the Lord. Fully faithful with thus sayith the Lord. Now, the main point though is that Brother Ramb is not here to defend himself and due to his impeccable Christian character, he deserves the benefit of the doubt that he was completely accurate with thus sayeth the Lord. So, there's two possible explanations. The first is that the thus sayeth the Lord about Donnie Morton's healing was true and came to pass and Donnie got well as brother Ram said in the quotes but readers digest hid that and also hid that Donnie died due to a hospital failure and that explanation is based upon brother's quote from 1953 in demonology. The second possible explanation is that the thus sayeth the Lord about healing was for a different boy and not about Donnie. So perhaps brother Bram mixed up his testimonies which explains why Donnie died. And that would also explain why brother Bram did not seem to understand that the Reader Digest article never said Donnie Morton was fully healed and had a miracle. So, out of those two possible explanations, I personally believe that brother Brandham got his stories mixed up. Due to the discrepancies between Brother Bram's story and the Reader's Digest story, it seems to me that the thus sayith the Lord healing was probably for a different boy and not Donnie Morton because again, we know thus sayith the Lord can't fail. Thus sayith the Lord was accurate every time in brother Ram's ministry. Again, seven thus sayith the Lord prophecies that came to pass. That's just what I found. No doubt there's many, many more. I reached out to different ministers about this and they seem to agree that it seemed like brother man probably got his stories mixed up because again we don't have the original recording of the thus sayith the Lord healing for Donnie Morton if it even was for Donnie Morton. So, I base this explanation on all the other information such as Donnie Morton's family member. If indeed this family member was being honest and Donnie never got better, which seems very possible because Donnie Morton died, then it would seem to me like Brother Ram just mixed up the stories. Brother Ram's life was filled with so many visions, so many testimonies, so many stories. His body didn't get a lot of rest. His mind did not get a lot of rest either. So I think it's very possible that he probably just confused some of the stories and that would make sense because even the stories about the man from Windsor have a lot of different details but the point is the same. The power of God protected the prophet and then there's many other stories where brother forgot some details or exaggerated some things which he said he was prone to exaggerate because he's human. But no one should deny the prophetic insight that brother Brandham had. For example, again, seven thus sayith the lords that already came to pass which no man or woman alive today can claim to do that. So, brother Ram was accurate with thus sayith the Lord. Second, uh brother Ram spoke of a pope of the United States, a prediction 71 years before it happened as we saw last year. Praise God for that. Third, brother Random recognized Luke 17 as a prophecy about a rise of homosexuality in the days of the coming of the son of man. And that was accurate. That came to pass. 2015 was when the Supreme Court legalized homosexuality in the United States. So, Brother Brandham basically foretold that. He saw the conditions moving towards that, the fulfillment of Luke 17. And then also with Deuteronomy 22:5, Brother Ram warned us about men wanting to be women and women trying to be men. So, Brother Ram foresaw this trans movement and warned the people on many occasions. So, brother Ram's prophetic gift and insight is also impeccable. So, we thank God for that by the grace of God. So, the bottom line is that without brother Random here, we don't know for sure. Was the Reader Digest article accurate or not? And ultimately, like many of these accusations, this situation is Brother Ram's words against the words of the accusers. I give brother Brandham the benefit of the doubt because of his godly Christian character, his completely accurate prophetic gift with thus sayith the Lord and of course the gift of discernment in the prayer lines. So we rejoice in God sending us a genuine Bible-based prophet, Brother William Brandham. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I appreciate all the questions. As I said earlier, this topic has been confusing for me. took a lot of study, a lot of pondering, comparing quotes versus the Reader's Digest article. But we can clearly see Brother Brand was a genuine prophet of God who had the ability to speak with thus sayith the Lord. And it came to pass. And just remember friends, the accusers of Brother Brandon will always try to take us away from the word of God. But we must keep our eyes on the word of God. A lot of times they're just making assumptions, slandering the good name of God's prophet, Brother William Brandham, jumping to false conclusions. But the holy life that Brother Bram lived speaks for itself. God has vindicated him as a true prophet of God. And by his Christian fruits, Brother Brandham is known. Brother Brham's not here to defend himself, but we'll keep defending Brother Brandham as a true prophet of God. Friends, no doubt there's questions about some of the thus sayith the Lord statements brother Brandham made. But remember the brown bear vision I put out a few years ago. I go through some of the questionable situations. The brown bear vision was conditional. God did his part where brother Brandham failed his part. Just like the 10 Bible examples on the video of prophets disobeying thus sayith the Lord, yet they were still prophets of God. The tent vision was likely fulfilled during the week of March of 1963 when brother Randon preached the revelation of the seven seals. the municipal bridge prophecy. I believe it was a cover up. They admit two people died. It's Brother Ram's words against the words of the accusers. Government records are not thus sayith the Lord, just like there's no record in Egypt of the 2 million Jews that escaped during the Exodus. The African vision of 300,000 was likely fulfilled in 1954. In Bombay, India, the mayor estimated 500,000 came. That was likely an exaggeration. And prophets can get confused with visions. Just like John the Baptist, he said, "Is this the Messiah or do we look for another?" Yet, he saw the vision of the Holy Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus. And the Arizona cloud from February 28th, 1963, twice, Brother Ram said, "With thus sayith the Lord by vision that the Lord was fixing to do something and that came to pass." He called it a snow white pyramid two months in advance. So that prophecy came to pass. But brother Ram never said,"I'll be under the cloud when the photos taken with thus sayeth the Lord." That point was never thus sayith the Lord. So the accusers are building a straw man argument. Let's keep our eyes focused on the truth of God's word. We thank God for 2 Chronicles 20:20. Believe his prophets, so shall you prosper. Thank God that our souls prosper because of the Bible revelations which Brother Ram taught. If you have any questions, concerns [music] or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you [music] and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. is never fail.
