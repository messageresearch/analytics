TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I remember the time when I always wanted I always all my life wanted to be a hunter my grandfather was you know my grandmother come off the reservations she draw a pension I just love Outdoors now I remember I always wanted I I just wanted all my life thought if I could ever get enough money that I could own a 3030 rifle if I could ever do it then I get a bunch of traps I go to the mountains I let the rest of the world go by I thought maybe sometime if I'll take my 22 in practice to be a good shot some Hunter sometime will want me to go along if I get to be a pretty good shot he'll let me go along for his protection I'll get to go hunting I look hanging on my walls and the best rifles that money can buy hangs there I can loan people rifles to go hunting he lets me go into the mountains and preaching some of the best gues there is in the world takes me hunting free Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound now even this morning an old deer hunter here somewhere with a 35 Remington I didn't really need the rifle but he put his arm around he said he's getting too old to hunt I want to give you my rifle I thought of that when I was a little boy how if I ever thought I'd owned a rifle like that oh my what it would have been and now I just think hanging there on my wall fine rifles places to go hunting I remember going out the boys to buy ice cream comb and sometimes some of them would have extra nickel and they' buy me one my I couldn't buy them one back I thought if I and they sometime used to buy these old what we call mudar hamburgers don't know where you all remembering of some of you Old-Timers you get it for nickel a whole lot of fried onions with it oh I love those things a little kid we didn't have just cornbread molasses you know how it is to eat now somebody buy me one of them hamburgers boy i' lick my fingers where I held it it was it was tastes so good and I thought boy that man if I could only buy him a hamburger and now I can buy a church their supper I remember all those things and where did it come from the grace of God hallelujah nothing that I did I remember going down the street here and I talk to somebody my father you all know it he drank he made whiskey and nobody had nothing to do with me I go down the street and try to talk to man I still meet that man today try to talk to somebody if there's nobody else to talk to they stand yeah mhm they I was a brandom so I'd feel real bad and turn around walk away I I'm not guilty of that I didn't do what my daddy did I never drink in my life why do I have to stand that now it's telling the wife you're not long ago I almost have to stay out of town God has done been good to me I thought over there where he told Nathan setting there one time Nathan David said is it right for me to live in a house of Cedar the Ark of my God under under tent out there coming Nathan the prophet said David do all is in your heart cuz God's with you the prophet made a mistake not willingly that night the Lord come to the prophet said go tell my servant David I Tu him from that sheep coat hering them few sheep out there and I give him a name like great man that's in the earth never said he give him the greatest name he just give him name like great man that was in the earth I've done all these things for you David I've cut off your enemies wherever you went I've been beside you I've never failed you and I won't fail you but I can't let you build a city I thought of that of a place now where God has helped me and let me no great man let me go around the world and people from around the world calling to come pray for them and sick people and W in a few minutes with you where just a few years ago they wouldn't even turn their turn their head to see me on the street now the businessman prosper by the people that to bring into the City and have here through their food and their Motel bills and things like that going to the motels and around in the city and things like people who pump and didn't love me at all nobody had any use for me and now by the help of God I believe it I'm directing the Bride of Jesus [Music] Christ Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound where did it come from my education I have none where did it come from my personality I have none did it come from my knowing of theology I know none what did it come to that Grace of God has save me it's Grace that taught My Heart To Fear it's Grace my fears relieved how happy did that Grace appear the hour I first believed through many dangers toils and snares I have already come it's grace that brought me safe thus far it's Grace will take me on and when we've been there in that City 10,000 years it's brighter than the sun we'll have no less time to sing his praise in when we first begun Oh How I Love Jesus that beautiful name that saved me when I was a a sinner that healed me when I was sick that gives me the promise of a home in that City I got a home in that rock nothing else matters now but get all of God's children together and say let's go the hour the midnight is striking it's later than we think let's pray Lord Jesus the closing of a perfect day as we would stand on the Mountaintop and watch the sun when the red streaks come up across the Great Western Mountain genre the great eye closes itself the birds begin to make their way to the nest it's coming night we've seen another great spiritual day when the Holy Spirit has been helping us to answer these questions now we're going to our nest Lord take care of us don't let nothing strike us Lord keep us from the serpents of the night and the evil may God be near us at all times protecting us and helping us I pray heavenly father that you will bless each and everyone that's been in the meeting those who could not be all that
