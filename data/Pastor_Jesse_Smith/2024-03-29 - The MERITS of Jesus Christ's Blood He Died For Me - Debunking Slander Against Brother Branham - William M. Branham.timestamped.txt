[0:03] I'm not sinless I got plenty hanging on
[0:06] me but every hour I confess it
[0:09] constantly I going on the merits of the
[0:11] blood of Jesus Christ he died for
[0:15] me greetings friends in the matchless
[0:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:20] purpose of this video on Good Friday
[0:23] 2024 is to show how God's true Prophet
[0:26] brother Bram trusted in the merits of
[0:28] the blood of Jesus Christ and so does
[0:31] every genuine Christian who is saved
[0:33] today on this wonderful day that we
[0:35] remember the amazing work of our Lord
[0:38] Jesus Christ dying for our sins hi
[0:41] friends I'm Pastor Jesse Smith I
[0:43] pastored bride of Christ Fellowship here
[0:45] in akan Ohio USA for about the last 18
[0:48] years June will be our 18th anniversary
[0:50] by God's grace and I defend the Bible
[0:53] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[0:54] to his true Prophet The Late William
[0:56] brandham 1909 to 1965 and I defend
[1:00] brother bram's Godly genuine Christian
[1:03] character today's video is defending
[1:05] brother bram's Godly Christian character
[1:08] as we hear from his own mouth his
[1:11] worship of Jesus Christ his solemn trust
[1:14] in Jesus Christ his true understanding
[1:17] that he could only trust in the merits
[1:19] of the blood of Jesus Christ this video
[1:22] is defending brother brandham against
[1:24] all the obvious slander against brother
[1:26] brandham from the believe the slander
[1:28] group and all those those groups
[1:30] associated with them and I say that
[1:32] humbly but that's what these people are
[1:34] guilty of they're guilty of slandering
[1:37] God's Prophet brother Brenham jumping to
[1:40] obvious false conclusions and hopefully
[1:42] this video will encourage each and every
[1:44] person to trust in the merits of the
[1:47] blood of Jesus Christ so I'll start off
[1:49] with some wonderful quotes and then
[1:51] we'll go in chronological order by God's
[1:53] grace the first quote is from 1963
[1:57] identification brother brandom said I'm
[1:58] trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ he
[2:01] said I go in on the merits of the blood
[2:04] of Jesus Christ he died for me so notice
[2:07] brother Brandon wasn't trusting in his
[2:08] Merit he was trusting in the Merit of
[2:11] the blood of Jesus Christ let's listen
[2:13] to the quote I'm not sinless I got
[2:16] plenty hanging on me but every hour I
[2:19] confess it constantly when I see my
[2:22] wrong then I turn from that and try to
[2:24] do what's right I wouldn't try to go to
[2:26] heaven on my merits I wouldn't get there
[2:27] I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Jesus
[2:30] Christ he is my trust I I I believe in
[2:33] him I wouldn't try to go in because I'm
[2:36] a Pentecostal brother I wouldn't go
[2:38] going on the merits of Pentecost I go in
[2:40] on the merits of the blood of Jesus
[2:42] Christ he died for me and that's what I
[2:45] want you to trust the merits of him and
[2:47] then how you know you're getting there
[2:48] is when every word is you punctuate with
[2:50] an amen amen because it's a word itself
[2:54] trying to vindicate itself and if we
[2:56] deny that word how can it vindicate
[2:57] itself in the second quote brother
[2:59] random said he's not saved by his
[3:01] feelings he's saved because God gave the
[3:04] promise of Salvation and he met God's
[3:07] conditions and now based upon God's holy
[3:09] word brother random can defeat Satan
[3:11] seven days in a week because it's God's
[3:14] word let's listen to the quote listen
[3:17] Brethren you're never saved by any
[3:20] sign you're never saved by any sensation
[3:25] you're saved when you meet God's
[3:28] condition of his work and nothing else
[3:30] are you saved
[3:33] by right God's word has made way you're
[3:36] not saved because you feel like you're
[3:39] saved I'm not saved because I feel like
[3:41] I'm saved because a lot of times I don't
[3:43] feel that
[3:44] way but I'm saved because God gave the
[3:49] promise I met God's conditions enough on
[3:53] God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven
[3:57] days in a week and as many nights
[4:00] because it's God's word he that Hearth
[4:03] my word and believeth on him that sent
[4:05] me has everlasting life and shall not
[4:08] come to judgment but pass from Death to
[4:11] life that's what the King of Kings said
[4:14] you believe it here's another quote I
[4:17] love the invasion of the United States
[4:19] 1954 brother brandom said if the people
[4:21] are coming to see me they're lost yet he
[4:24] said let us exalt Christ so here again
[4:27] we see brother brandom exalting Jesus
[4:29] Christ humbling himself let's listen to
[4:31] the quote ah sometimes I think of my
[4:34] Ministry and see people coming I get in
[4:36] a hotel room say God who who's the
[4:39] people coming to see me or you see if
[4:43] they're coming to see me they're lost
[4:44] yet but oh God tear me down take me away
[4:49] I want to represent you the one who will
[4:52] stand before someday with trembling
[4:55] hands and trembling feeble body looking
[4:57] at you knowing my soul hangs be your
[5:00] decision let us exalt
[5:03] Christ Now by God's grace we're going to
[5:06] go chronologically we'll start in
[5:08] 1955 brother brandom said he's protected
[5:11] by the blood of Jesus Christ God doesn't
[5:14] see his sins because of the blood of
[5:15] Jesus Christ though his sins be like
[5:18] Scarlet God's looking through the shed
[5:20] blood of Calvary at brother brandom of
[5:22] course this reminds us of Isaiah 1:18
[5:25] though your sins be as Scarlet they
[5:26] shall be white as snow let's listen to
[5:28] the quote I come to him no matter what
[5:31] you think about me as long as I'm under
[5:32] the blood I'm protected by the blood God
[5:35] don't see my sins he looks through the
[5:37] blood of Jesus Christ and through my
[5:38] sins may be like scared they look white
[5:40] to the almighty God because he's looking
[5:42] through the shed blood of Calvary don't
[5:45] you want it tonight wouldn't you love to
[5:47] be in that
[5:49] state the next quote is from the
[5:51] junction of time
[5:52] 1956 brother Bram said daily I trust in
[5:55] thee knowing that daily I sin I confess
[5:58] my wrongs and accept thee my Lord such a
[6:01] beautiful quote brother random
[6:03] acknowledges he sins every day but he's
[6:04] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ
[6:06] confessing his sins every day reminding
[6:08] us of 1 John
[6:10] 17-10 the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[6:13] cleanses us from all sin if we confess
[6:15] our sins he's faithful and just to
[6:17] forgive us our sins to cleanse us from
[6:19] all unrighteousness let's listen to the
[6:22] quote what a day of rejoicing that will
[6:25] be when Jesus our lord returns
[6:30] we realize that we're so thankful to be
[6:32] living in this day and God I Repent of
[6:35] everything annoying that we could not
[6:38] live in ourselves Lord but we're we're
[6:40] Sinners to begin with and daily I trust
[6:44] in thee knowing that daily I sin knowing
[6:47] that daily things happen to me and in my
[6:50] life that you would not be pleased with
[6:53] now I confess my wrong and accept thee
[6:56] my Lord as my own soul lays at the altar
[6:59] this morning morning at this little
[7:00] Tabernacle prostrate here
[7:03] Lord oh God I failed you back down Earth
[7:07] with those Divine gifts as you showed so
[7:11] miraculous 1956 contending for the faith
[7:14] brother Brandon says it's God's grace
[7:17] that saves us he said we confess our
[7:20] wrongs brother Bram said there's none
[7:22] without sin every day you sin Paul said
[7:24] he had to Die daily of course this
[7:26] reminds us of 1 Corinthians 15:31 where
[7:29] Paul said he died daily and also
[7:31] Ephesians
[7:33] 28-10 for by grace are ye saved through
[7:36] faith brother brandom said it's Grace
[7:37] God's grace that saves us let's listen
[7:39] to the quote we're tempted all of us are
[7:43] tempted all of us sin there's none
[7:45] without sin every day you sin Paul said
[7:48] he had to Die daily and if we say we sin
[7:51] and have no sin then the Bible says we
[7:53] make God to lie and we could not do that
[7:56] so we sin daily and it's Grace God's
[7:59] grace that saves us and as we confess
[8:01] our Wongs God's just to forgive them and
[8:04] your your confession as long as it holds
[8:07] Good your salvation is perfect same as
[8:09] it with Divine Healing it's your
[8:11] personal faith in a resurrected Lord
[8:15] Jesus next 1957 the mighty conqueror
[8:18] brother brandom said I'm so glad that my
[8:20] book up in heaven my name is on his
[8:22] register I'm so glad that my sins are
[8:24] under the blood pardoned by his own
[8:26] precious blood the word pardoned in the
[8:29] New Testament is often translated as
[8:32] remitted so brother ramam said I'm so
[8:34] glad my sins are remitted by the
[8:36] precious blood of Jesus Christ Matthew
[8:39] 26:28 Jesus said this is my blood of the
[8:43] new testament which is shed for many for
[8:45] the remission of sins brother Brandon
[8:46] was trusting in the blood of Jesus
[8:48] Christ his sins were remitted let's
[8:50] listen to the quote the prophets and
[8:52] Saints looked on and recogniz him sure
[8:55] they were waiting for
[8:56] him oh he said children get get ready
[9:00] we're going out of here bless the Lord
[9:03] blessed be the name of the Lord I'm so
[9:06] glad that my book is on my up in heaven
[9:09] my name is on his register I'm so glad
[9:13] that my sins are under the blood been
[9:16] signed pardon by his own precious
[9:18] blood I'm so glad that I know him I'm
[9:22] sure that every Christian can say Amen
[9:24] to that amen I'm so glad that one of
[9:26] these mornings he'll come for us 1959
[9:30] what does thou hear Brother brandom
[9:33] Saidi so happy that I know him in the
[9:35] Forgiveness of my sins with the
[9:36] assurance that my sins are under the
[9:38] blood as I confess them daily to him
[9:42] again it goes with 1 John 17-10 he
[9:44] confessed his sins Jesus was faithful to
[9:47] forgive him and then the Lord's Prayer
[9:49] Matthew 6 11-12 give us this day our
[9:52] daily bread so daily prayers for
[9:55] provision and also forgive us our debts
[9:57] as we forgive our debtors let's listen
[9:59] to the quote I'm so happy that I know
[10:02] him in the Forgiveness of my sins and
[10:05] with the assurance that my sins are
[10:08] under the blood as I confess them daily
[10:10] to him next quote 1960 brother brandham
[10:14] says all our sins we were put on him and
[10:17] he will be our attorney at the Judgment
[10:19] bar he said I'm so glad I've confessed
[10:22] all my sins to him some 30 years ago
[10:24] this reminds us of 1 John 2 1-3 we have
[10:28] an advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[10:30] the righteous he's the propit tuation
[10:32] for our sins that means wrath Bearer or
[10:35] taker of God's Wrath that should have
[10:38] went to us he was the perpetuation for
[10:40] the sins of the whole world brother
[10:42] brandham recognized this brother
[10:43] brandham had an advocate Jesus Christ
[10:46] let's listen to the quote what will take
[10:48] place at that day if our sins are not
[10:51] under the
[10:53] blood it'll be a terrible
[10:57] day for many and a glorious day for many
[11:02] for it'll be the day of rejoicing for
[11:05] those who have accepted our Lord and
[11:08] Savior Jesus
[11:09] Christ then all of our sins will be put
[11:13] upon him and he will be our
[11:15] attorney at the
[11:17] bar I'm so glad to know tonight as a
[11:22] testimony that I have confessed all my
[11:24] sins to him some 30 years ago and have
[11:28] been on the field trying to represent
[11:30] him to
[11:31] people as a real attorney who can plead
[11:35] the case so perfect until God forgives
[11:39] every sin and sends back the Seal of his
[11:43] recognition to us to be Sons and
[11:45] Daughters of his the Holy Spirit to give
[11:48] us witness 1961 one of the meanest men
[11:51] in town brother brandom said if he would
[11:53] have been The Courier that brought Jesus
[11:56] to Simon the Pharisees house he said the
[11:59] first first thing he would have said to
[12:00] Jesus would have been Lord be merciful
[12:02] to me a sinner of course this reminds us
[12:04] of the Publican in Luke 1813 and 14 he
[12:08] smed his breast and said God be merciful
[12:10] to me a sinner and that man went to his
[12:12] home Justified declared righteous so we
[12:15] see brother randam had the same attitude
[12:18] the same humility as his Publican from
[12:20] jesus' Parable let's listen to the quote
[12:23] I've
[12:24] often thought what if I could have been
[12:27] that Courier
[12:31] but he
[12:34] said my master has
[12:37] uh give you an honor he's having a great
[12:42] feast and he wants you to be his uh
[12:45] special guest at this
[12:49] feast and we would uh like for you to
[12:52] promise us that you would meet us on
[12:54] such and such a
[12:56] day it's may be an annual of fair and
[12:59] and out of all the men he chose you to
[13:06] come you know I believe if I'd have been
[13:08] standing there that close to the Lord
[13:11] Jesus I'd have forgot all about what
[13:14] Simon had told me to say the first thing
[13:17] I would have said been Lord be merciful
[13:19] to me yeah a
[13:21] sinner but that's way many of us get we
[13:24] feel that our daily task and what our
[13:27] work calls for is more more important
[13:29] than anything
[13:31] else I believe if we're ever in the
[13:33] presence of God
[13:35] our Earthly prage our Earthly Associates
[13:39] our message or our work should be last
[13:42] let's get our confession out to
[13:47] him oh I'd love to have fell down at his
[13:50] feet there and said I have a message
[13:52] from my master but first I got a message
[13:57] too be merciful me oh God I'm a
[14:01] sinner now I know that thou art the Son
[14:04] of God and I've long for this
[14:07] opportunity and now I'm kneeling here at
[14:10] your feet be merciful to me next 1962
[14:14] possessing all things brother brandom
[14:16] ask is your sins under the blood by
[14:18] faith tonight in Christ Jesus and again
[14:22] this goes with Ephesians 2 8-10 we're
[14:25] saved by grace through faith and then
[14:27] brother random quotes John 52 2 4 he
[14:30] that heareth my word and believeth on
[14:31] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[14:33] and shall not come into condemnation but
[14:35] is passed from death into life let's
[14:37] listen to the quote is your sins are the
[14:39] blood by faith tonight in Christ Jesus
[14:41] we shall now take the communion not the
[14:44] communion you commune as you eat with
[14:46] one another just commune with God the
[14:49] communion is not the bread not the wine
[14:52] the communion is talking back and forth
[14:54] with God Amen this is a symbol that we
[14:56] take that we believe in his death broken
[14:59] embody his burial and Resurrection we
[15:01] believe in the presence of the Holy
[15:03] Spirit and we believe that he has given
[15:05] us eternal life and we cannot die we
[15:08] have passed from Death un life and
[15:10] someday when we separate from one
[15:12] another here we'll rise again in the
[15:13] resurrection with each other joar
[15:15] together with Christ Jesus as a body
[15:18] amen hallelujah upon these bases in the
[15:20] confession of my sins and my faith in
[15:22] the Son of God I take myself in the
[15:25] church before these articles that God
[15:27] left for us to do to show forth his
[15:28] death until he comes amen next in the
[15:31] seventh seal 1963 brother brandham said
[15:33] you forget anything about me I'm your
[15:36] brother a sinner saved by grace not fit
[15:37] to live it's exactly the truth I ain't
[15:40] saying that to be humble he said be a
[15:42] gem in the crown of Jesus Christ and
[15:44] Something Told brother brandham it's the
[15:46] word that matters and of course this
[15:48] reminds us of Romans 7:2
[15:50] 24:25 St Paul said oh Wretched Man that
[15:53] I am who shall deliver me from this body
[15:55] of death I thank God through Jesus
[15:57] Christ Our Lord let's listen to the
[15:59] quote May you always bear that in mind
[16:02] to be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ
[16:05] Paul said to the church you are you are
[16:07] the jewels or gems of his crown we want
[16:10] to be the gems of the crown of Jesus
[16:13] Christ we don't want never put a man in
[16:15] it you forget anything about me I am
[16:19] your brother a sinner saved by grace not
[16:23] fit to live that's exactly the truth and
[16:26] I say that to be humble that's facts
[16:29] there's nothing in me not one sound
[16:31] thing at all but the grace of God has
[16:35] let my poor Deming eyes look beyond the
[16:39] curtain of power and see those things I
[16:42] I come back when I was a little boy I
[16:44] love people I always want somebody to
[16:46] love me and talk to me nobody would do
[16:48] it because of the name of the family
[16:50] nobody talked to me but when I made my
[16:52] surrender to God than our people
[16:54] background being Irish I thought maybe
[16:57] there's all Catholic maybe that would be
[16:59] I went there he is some way and I went
[17:00] out to First Baptist Church and he is
[17:02] another way I said Lord there's got to
[17:04] be some ways true and something said
[17:05] it's a word amen I've helped that word
[17:08] look at every Vision every word the day
[17:11] I laid that Cornerstone on and put that
[17:13] in there I wrote on there what he show
[17:14] me that morning in a vision Here's the
[17:17] final quote from God hiding himself in
[17:19] Simplicity preach in Albuquerque 63
[17:21] preached on Good Friday brother brandom
[17:24] said what did he do Jesus humbled
[17:26] himself to death on Good Friday
[17:27] afternoon that he might rise on Easter
[17:30] Sunday to send back the Holy Spirit
[17:32] these signs shall follow them that
[17:34] believe and brother Brandon preached on
[17:36] the blood of Jesus Christ acting like a
[17:38] bleach to totally cleanse our sins and
[17:41] he said the blood of Jesus Christ so
[17:43] thoroughly cleanses us and then Jesus
[17:45] promises us a better life the baptism of
[17:48] the Holy Ghost my there's so many
[17:50] wonderful scriptures in here Isaiah 534
[17:52] and5 he was wounded for our
[17:54] transgressions bruised for our
[17:56] iniquities with his stripes we are
[17:58] healed Mark
[18:00] 165-18 these signs shall follow them
[18:02] that believe Jude 1:24 he's able to
[18:05] present you faultless before the
[18:07] presence of his glory and then acts 1:5
[18:10] Jesus said ye shall be baptized with the
[18:12] Holy Ghost not many days hence let's
[18:15] listen to the quote smitten and stricken
[18:18] and yet we did Estee him smitten and
[18:19] stricken sure of God but he was wounded
[18:22] for our transgressions the Clorox came
[18:25] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[18:27] chasm of our peace is up on him and with
[18:30] his stripes we were healed what did he
[18:32] do humble himself to death on Good
[18:35] Friday afternoon that he might rise on
[18:38] Easter Sunday Amen to send back the Holy
[18:41] Spirit upon the church with a double
[18:43] potion of it that we might do the same
[18:46] things that he do that he did he
[18:48] promised these signs will follow them at
[18:50] believe and how far we get away from him
[18:52] by our Traditions there you are God
[18:56] hiding himself in humility read
[18:58] revealing himself in power that's the
[19:01] way God does it that's God's program of
[19:04] doing it yesterday he may bring Sons
[19:06] across this Chasm Lord
[19:09] Jesus in the way of humility in the way
[19:12] of humbleness I offer you this
[19:15] congregation that's on their feet I
[19:17] offer them to you because they have
[19:19] stood in response to the call they're
[19:22] seeking deeper things they're seeking
[19:26] more life after hearing that the blood
[19:29] of Jesus so thoroughly cleanses that
[19:32] there's no more nothing that the
[19:34] complete word of God rests within them
[19:37] that the very command of their own voice
[19:40] is creative power because in them is the
[19:44] Holy Ghost and this Holy Ghost is a
[19:47] Creator he makes things comes to pass
[19:50] because he speaks the word and the word
[19:53] spoken becomes God in action and Lord I
[19:56] pray that you'll send the Holy Ghost
[19:58] upon every one of them just now and
[20:00] deliver unto them Lord in the power of
[20:03] the resurrection of Christ the things
[20:06] that they are Desiring in their heart a
[20:08] better life the baptism of the spirit
[20:10] Lord may it be so that this audience
[20:13] will be illuminated the hearts of the
[20:15] people will see the vision and be filled
[20:18] with the power of God I command them to
[20:21] you Lord in the name of Jesus
[20:24] Christ in
[20:26] closing friends I hope this video was a
[20:28] bless in here on Good Friday
[20:30] 2024 I've just been studying about
[20:33] Calvary Jesus's death burial and
[20:35] resurrection and these quote stuck out
[20:37] to me and I just thought it was very
[20:39] appropriate to show how brother brandham
[20:40] a true prophet of God was constantly
[20:42] magnifying Jesus Christ he was exalting
[20:45] Jesus Christ trusting in the Merit of
[20:47] Jesus Christ and not his own Merit again
[20:51] all these Slanders of brother brandham
[20:53] they fail to see these quotes they fail
[20:56] to recognize these quotes they strain in
[20:58] a nap and swallow a camel they choose to
[21:00] slander rather than to show mercy of
[21:03] course they're slandering because
[21:04] they're jumping to false conclusions
[21:06] Proverbs 10:18 says he that hideth
[21:09] hatred with lying lips and he that utth
[21:11] a slander is a fool so clearly those who
[21:15] slander brother brandom unjustly are
[21:17] fools according to the Bible and this is
[21:20] why they don't study out the other side
[21:22] Proverbs 18:13 said he that anth a
[21:25] matter before he heareth it it is a
[21:26] Folly and shame unto him him so shame
[21:29] and Folly upon these people who jump to
[21:32] false conclusions against God's Prophet
[21:34] brother Brenham who is pointing everyone
[21:36] including himself to Jesus Christ to
[21:38] look and live to Jesus Christ remember
[21:41] the Bible says the unrighteous shall not
[21:43] inherit the kingdom of God in 1
[21:45] Corinthians 6:9-11 that includes
[21:47] revilers or those who speak evil slander
[21:51] against the true Servants of God but
[21:53] thankfully those who speak slander can
[21:55] be washed can be Sanctified and
[21:57] justified in the name of Jesus Jesus
[21:58] Christ and by the spirit of our God if
[22:01] they repent friends remember the word of
[22:03] God Romans 8:
[22:05] 33-34 who shall lay anything to the
[22:07] charge of God's elect it is God that
[22:10] justifieth who is he that condemneth it
[22:13] is Christ that died yay rather that is
[22:15] risen again who is even at the right
[22:17] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[22:19] for us so if brother brandham is God's
[22:21] elect Prophet for this hour and he's
[22:23] elect to Salvation who are these
[22:26] slanderers who can bring a charge
[22:27] against brother brand
[22:29] and who are these Slanders to bring a
[22:30] charge against message believers who are
[22:32] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ of
[22:35] course Paul's questions are basically
[22:36] saying no one can lay any charge to the
[22:39] account of God's elect because of the
[22:41] blood of Jesus Christ no one can condemn
[22:44] a forgiven Christian because there's no
[22:47] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[22:49] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[22:52] after the spirit so let's Rejoice on
[22:54] this holy weekend we'd say of course we
[22:56] know every weekend's holy but this is a
[22:58] special time a year remembering the
[23:00] blood of Jesus Christ and the
[23:02] resurrection of Jesus Christ and then
[23:03] the subsequent sending of the baptism of
[23:06] the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost
[23:09] if you have any questions concerns or
[23:10] testimonies about this video please
[23:12] contact
[23:13] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:16] the desire of your
[23:20] heart
