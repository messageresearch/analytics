[0:02] I'm not sinless I got plenty hanging on
[0:06] me but every hour I confess it
[0:09] constantly I wouldn't try to go to
[0:10] heaven on my merits I wouldn't get there
[0:12] I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ I
[0:15] go in on the merits of the blood of
[0:17] Jesus Christ he died for
[0:20] me greetings friends in the matchless
[0:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:25] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:27] viewer's question do I believe the
[0:29] supposed Ed
[0:31] 1964 prophecy of Kenneth Hagen
[0:34] prophesying of brother bram's passing my
[0:37] answer is no I do not believe it was a
[0:38] genuine prophecy I'll have three reasons
[0:41] to share about that in this video by
[0:42] God's grace I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride
[0:45] of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio
[0:47] USA and I defend the original Gospel of
[0:50] Jesus Christ that Christ revealed to St
[0:52] Paul and then had to restore through
[0:54] Martin Luther John Wesley and the late
[0:57] William brandham 1909 to 196 5 I also
[1:01] defend William branham's Godly Christian
[1:03] character again my answer is no I do not
[1:06] believe Kenneth heagen gave a genuine
[1:08] prophecy about the death of William
[1:10] brandham let me read the apparent
[1:12] prophecy apparently this prophecy is
[1:15] from Kenneth hain's 1992 book called he
[1:18] gave gifts unto men here's a screenshot
[1:21] of the book and apparently the prophecy
[1:24] said at the end of 65 he who now stands
[1:26] in the Forefront of The Healing Ministry
[1:28] as a prophet will be taken out of the
[1:30] way he'll make a false step and Satan
[1:32] shall destroy his life but his spirit
[1:35] will be saved and his Works will follow
[1:37] him air 66 shall come he shall be
[1:41] gone here's the three reasons I do not
[1:44] believe this was a genuine prophecy the
[1:46] first reason is this is an after Thea
[1:49] prophecy this book was not released
[1:51] until 1992 brother bandam died in
[1:55] 1965 so this prophecy is 27 years after
[1:58] the fact there's no proof as far as I
[2:01] know of Kenneth Haagen ever publishing
[2:03] this Prophecy Before brother braham's
[2:05] death so again this is called an after
[2:07] the fact prophecy one of brother Ram's
[2:10] accusers also shared that this prophecy
[2:12] was apparently written in a 1976 book by
[2:15] Freda
[2:17] Lindsay and that might be true I don't
[2:19] know I've never read the book but again
[2:22] even if it was written in 1976 that's
[2:24] still 11 years after brother braham's
[2:26] death so people who trust in this
[2:28] prophecy are Trust ing in after Thea
[2:31] prophecies but remember brother Brandon
[2:33] was a genuine prophet of God I have a
[2:35] video with six fulfilled thus sayith the
[2:38] Lord prophecies from brother brandham
[2:40] that were spoken before the fact and
[2:42] came to pass by the grace of God again
[2:44] as one proof out of many proofs that
[2:46] brother Bram was a genuine prophet of
[2:48] God moving on to the second reason I
[2:51] don't believe this was a genuine
[2:53] prophecy the second reason is because
[2:55] there's no Bible precedent for a genuine
[2:57] prophet of God making one false step and
[3:00] then being allowed to be given over to
[3:02] Satan to destroy his life so even the
[3:05] wording this prophecy is not a Biblical
[3:08] wording the wording was he'll make a
[3:10] false step and Satan shall destroy his
[3:12] life so there is no Bible example of a
[3:15] prophet making one mistake and then God
[3:17] allows that Prophet to be given over to
[3:19] Satan so Satan can destroy his life the
[3:23] only thing close to this we can see in
[3:24] the scripture is 1 Corinthians chapter 5
[3:27] where a brother was sleeping with his
[3:28] stepmother it was such wickedness Paul
[3:30] says even the Gentiles don't have this
[3:32] type of wickedness and then Paul said
[3:34] deliver that brother over to Satan that
[3:36] his body will be destroyed but his
[3:38] spirit will be saved but then if you
[3:40] read the book of 2 Corinthians you find
[3:42] out this brother repented and he was
[3:43] restored back into Fellowship so there
[3:46] are no Bible examples of a prophet
[3:48] making one false step and then God gives
[3:50] the prophet over to Satan to be
[3:52] destroyed and also as I've been studying
[3:54] brother bram's Ministry now for over 23
[3:56] years brother Bram did not make a false
[3:59] step in his Ministry that he did not
[4:00] repent of brother BR is such an honest
[4:03] transparent man such a humble Christian
[4:05] that he often talked about his missteps
[4:08] and in every case he admitted it was a
[4:10] sin he repented of it and he got right
[4:11] with God again proving he was a genuine
[4:14] prophet of God and a holy ghost filed
[4:15] Christian and so this prophecy this
[4:18] apparent prophecy could not apply to
[4:19] brother brandham because he did not make
[4:21] a false step that he did not repent of
[4:24] and so God would not need to take him
[4:26] off the scene for a mistake because
[4:28] brother brandham would have repented did
[4:29] of any mistake he made brother Braham
[4:31] said he confessed his sins every day so
[4:33] that means he's forgiven and his sins
[4:35] are under the blood of Jesus Christ
[4:36] every day he's walking in the light as
[4:39] Jesus is in the light I'm not sinless I
[4:42] got plenty hanging on me but every hour
[4:45] I confess it constantly when I see my
[4:48] wrong then I turn from that and try to
[4:50] do what's right I wouldn't try to go to
[4:52] heaven on my merits I wouldn't get there
[4:54] I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ he
[4:57] is my trust I I I believe in him I
[5:01] wouldn't try to go in because I'm a
[5:02] Pentecostal brother I I wouldn't go in
[5:05] on the merits of Pentecost I go in on
[5:07] the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ
[5:09] he died for me and that's what I want
[5:11] you to trust the merits of him and then
[5:13] how you know you're getting there is
[5:15] when every word is you punctuate with an
[5:17] amen amen because it's a word itself
[5:20] trying to vindicate itself and if we
[5:22] deny that word how can it vindicate
[5:24] itself I'm so happy that I know him in
[5:27] the Forgiveness of my sins and with the
[5:30] assurance that my sins are under the
[5:32] blood as I confess them daily to him
[5:36] related to this same idea of after Thea
[5:39] prophecies some of brother bram's
[5:40] accusers say brother bram's seven major
[5:42] visions of 1933 were after the fact and
[5:45] I do agree that there is no recording of
[5:47] the
[5:48] 1933 prophecies when brother Ram
[5:50] actually preached them in 1933 but there
[5:53] is a quote where brother Bram said hands
[5:55] were raised in the brandom Tabernacle
[5:57] that were there when brother spoke the
[6:00] 1933 prophecies and these were hands
[6:02] that were raised in
[6:04] 1961 so 28 years after brother Rah gave
[6:07] the prophecy 28 years after 1933 in 1961
[6:11] hands went up and said they heard
[6:12] brother B prophesy the seven major
[6:15] Visions let's listen to the quote it's
[6:17] from the 7th week of Daniel
[6:20] 1961
[6:22] now in
[6:24] 1933 when we were worshiping over here
[6:26] in the Masonic temple where the Church
[6:28] of Christ stands today
[6:31] on
[6:33] one April
[6:35] morning before leaving home I was
[6:38] dedicating my a car I got a 33 model car
[6:41] and I was dedicating to the Lord's
[6:42] service and in a vision I saw the end
[6:46] time amen now I notice how striking this
[6:50] is back in there when I was just a
[6:54] boy and you can imagine what a 1933
[6:57] model car look like now what look like
[7:00] and I went over there to the Masonic
[7:02] temple where some of you oldtimers in
[7:04] here remembers and throw down an old
[7:07] paper at home it's already in print went
[7:09] out around the world see that was in
[7:13] 1933 and I predicted that there would be
[7:16] some great tragedy happened to this
[7:19] United States before or by the year of
[7:22] 1977 how many remembers me saying that
[7:25] look at the
[7:26] hand now watch I predicted seven things
[7:30] was yet in a
[7:31] making of the before this great
[7:34] consummation or great thing would take
[7:36] place here in the United States some
[7:37] great horrible thing the third reason
[7:40] why I don't believe this Prophecy from
[7:41] Kenneth Haagen is because Kenneth Hagen
[7:43] is a known false teacher there's at
[7:45] least four doctrines that he teaches
[7:47] that are wrong the first was the
[7:49] Prosperity Gospel that God always wants
[7:52] you to be healthy and Wealthy second he
[7:55] allowed women preachers we know 1
[7:56] Timothy 2 says Paul never allowed women
[7:59] to assur authority over men and preach
[8:01] to men the third false teaching he
[8:04] taught was tongues as the evidence of
[8:06] the Holy Ghost and the final false
[8:09] Doctrine he taught was the word of faith
[8:12] and of course this gets into the name it
[8:13] and claim it false teaching any true
[8:16] Christian knows you just can't name and
[8:18] claim whatever you want you can only
[8:20] speak as you're led by the Holy Spirit
[8:22] that's what brother Bram told us when he
[8:24] was telling about speaking the squirrels
[8:26] into existence in
[8:27] 1964 brother Ram said he never never
[8:29] asked to speak squirrels into existence
[8:31] God led him to speak that and that's how
[8:34] it was with all of the testimonies of
[8:38] the third poll brother using the third
[8:39] poll I think there's five testimonies of
[8:41] that in Look Away to Jesus
[8:45] 1963 and each time it was God leading
[8:48] brother brandham to speak the word of
[8:50] God God was telling brother Bram to
[8:52] speak the word to have faith in the word
[8:55] of God that God revealed to brother
[8:57] brandham so let's play that quote from
[8:59] 19 1964 brother BR said he never asked
[9:01] to speak the squirrels it was God doing
[9:03] it let's listen to the quote you are
[9:06] believing because of the spoken words
[9:08] and things like that that he said about
[9:10] and all of you here Witnesses squirrels
[9:11] and all these other things that's been
[9:13] done but did you notice that was
[9:15] sovereignly
[9:17] given I never asked him Lord let me do
[9:21] this speak these things in like that do
[9:23] these things there I never asked him
[9:25] that he by his own Divine will
[9:30] came to me and said you go do this see I
[9:33] wasn't asking one thing about it Moses
[9:36] never asked to go down in Egypt but it
[9:38] was God that sent him down to Egypt
[9:42] see so friends no one is really sure why
[9:44] God took brother brandom home I've
[9:46] shared this before I believe that God
[9:48] took him home because people were
[9:50] looking too much at the messenger
[9:52] instead of the message the reason I
[9:54] believe that is because brother Ram said
[9:55] that so let's play that quote it's from
[9:58] an absolute January 27th
[10:00] 1963 brother BR said you watch the
[10:03] message don't pay any attention to the
[10:05] messenger God will take it away from you
[10:07] God will share his glory with nobody
[10:09] don't you watch the messenger watch The
[10:11] Message let's listen to the
[10:13] quote I'm only telling you the truth
[10:15] friend don't let it pass by you I'm not
[10:18] claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother
[10:21] don't you pay attention to a messenger
[10:23] you watch the message don't watch the
[10:25] messenger God will take it away from
[10:28] you he'll share his glory as nobody
[10:31] right glory to God don't you watch the
[10:33] messenger watch the
[10:36] message in
[10:38] closing friends hope this video was a
[10:40] blessing by the grace of God those are
[10:42] the three reasons I do not believe
[10:43] Kenneth Haagen actually gave a prophecy
[10:45] about the death of brother brandham
[10:47] what's sad is that some of brother
[10:48] bram's accusers are actually trusting in
[10:51] this Kenneth haen prophecy even though
[10:54] both Witnesses are after the fact
[10:56] Witnesses and then some accusers of
[10:58] brother Bram they criticize brother
[11:01] brandham for apparent after theact
[11:03] prophecies and yet here they are
[11:04] trusting in after theact prophecies so
[11:06] that doesn't make any sense to me it
[11:08] seems like they are contradicting
[11:10] themselves so we can look at the life of
[11:12] brother brandham he finished the
[11:13] mysteries of God he was a genuine
[11:15] prophet he revealed secrets about the
[11:17] Seven Seals he had the spirit of Elijah
[11:20] anointing him with all the
[11:21] characteristics of Elijah brother R
[11:23] corrected over 110 false teachings that
[11:26] most churches were guilty of teaching
[11:28] brother Ram turned Hearts back to the
[11:30] apostolic fathers in other words the
[11:31] original Revelation that Jesus Christ
[11:33] gave to St Paul so we're so thankful for
[11:36] that by the grace of God let's keep
[11:38] standing on the word of God rightly
[11:39] dividing the word of Truth so in this
[11:41] case rightly dividing supposed
[11:43] prophecies we must do that the Bible
[11:45] said prove all things 1 Thessalonians 5
[11:48] the Bible says believe not every Spirit
[11:50] but try the spirits in 1 John 4 if you
[11:54] have any questions concerns or
[11:55] testimonies about this video please
[11:57] contact me God God bless you and may
[12:00] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
