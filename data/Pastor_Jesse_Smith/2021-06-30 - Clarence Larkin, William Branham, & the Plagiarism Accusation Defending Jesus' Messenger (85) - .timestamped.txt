[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends
[0:09] in the matchless name of the lord jesus
[0:11] christ god's prophet
[0:13] william branham has been accused of
[0:15] plagiarizing clarence larkin
[0:18] in reference to the seven church ages
[0:21] daniel's 70 weeks
[0:22] and the seven seals it's an absolute
[0:25] false accusation friends
[0:28] it's not true when you understand two
[0:30] things
[0:32] first the definition of plagiarism and
[0:34] second
[0:35] brother branham repeatedly referred to
[0:37] larkin's work
[0:39] he was using as history and on three
[0:41] occasions
[0:42] cited larkin by name
[0:46] in reference to the future home brother
[0:48] branham did not cite anyone
[0:50] as far as i can find so it's a different
[0:53] situation than the seven
[0:54] church ages daniel 70 weeks and the
[0:57] seven seals
[0:58] which i'll discuss in this video it's
[1:01] likely he forgot to cite anyone
[1:03] but either way we should not jump to
[1:05] conclusions immediately condemning
[1:07] brother branham as a plagiarist
[1:09] as brother branham's accusers often do
[1:12] to their own shame
[1:14] since this is my longest video to date
[1:17] here's a summary of the three sermons
[1:19] series
[1:20] and one sermon in which brother branham
[1:22] has been accused of plagiarizing
[1:24] clarence larkin
[1:26] in the seven church ages series brother
[1:28] branham cited historians over 20 times
[1:32] and although he never mentioned larkin's
[1:34] name he cited larkin's work
[1:36] at least three times specifically
[1:39] calling it history
[1:40] so this clears him of plagiarism
[1:43] in the daniels 70 weeks series brother
[1:46] branham cited larkin by name
[1:48] and other historians so this clears him
[1:51] of plagiarism
[1:52] in the seven seals series brother
[1:54] branham cited numerous historians and
[1:56] although he didn't cite larkin by name
[1:59] in the series he did cite larkin a year
[2:02] later for his ideas on the seven seals
[2:05] additionally brother branham's
[2:07] revelations of the seven seals
[2:08] were very different from larkins as they
[2:11] only agreed on the sixth seal
[2:13] and brother branham taught the seven
[2:15] seals began in the church ages
[2:17] while larkin believed they began in the
[2:19] great tribulation period
[2:21] which was a 2 000 year difference
[2:24] in the future home sermon brother
[2:25] branham apparently forgot to cite
[2:27] anyone but he never claimed larkin's
[2:30] work he used
[2:31] was revealed to him only brother
[2:34] branham's main emphasis on revelation
[2:36] from god
[2:37] was the three works of grace which
[2:39] larkin did not teach
[2:43] on this plagiarism accusation friends
[2:46] let me just say humbly
[2:48] and with a heavy heart brother branham's
[2:50] accusers
[2:51] must not deeply and sincerely study
[2:54] brother branham's sermons
[2:55] it seems they're just skimming his
[2:57] sermons in order to find fault with him
[3:00] also the accusers label message
[3:02] believers of having
[3:04] cognitive dissonance and some do
[3:07] such as the tape church movement and the
[3:10] return ministry people
[3:12] but if the proof in this video of
[3:14] brother branham citing his sources
[3:16] doesn't make them change their minds
[3:18] then they are the ones with cognitive
[3:20] dissonance the accusers will double down
[3:24] on their belief that brother branham was
[3:25] a plagiarist which he wasn't
[3:27] and that he pretended to speak in
[3:29] tongues which he didn't
[3:31] and so many more examples here's the
[3:34] specific
[3:35] false accusation against brother branham
[3:38] and you can easily see why it's wrong
[3:41] william branham's accusers say quote if
[3:44] william branham had simply said
[3:46] i read this information in clarence
[3:48] larkin's book
[3:49] then he would not have been guilty of
[3:51] plagiarism but he didn't
[3:53] instead he said that he received it by
[3:55] divine revelation
[3:57] he said that god gave it to him which
[3:59] was a lie
[4:00] he got the information directly from
[4:02] clarence larkin and others
[4:04] end quote i have two comments about this
[4:07] false
[4:08] accusation first brother branham did say
[4:11] in effect i read this information from
[4:14] larkin
[4:15] on multiple occasions and on other
[4:18] occasions
[4:19] he seemed to forget to say larkin's name
[4:21] but still said
[4:22] i read this information from history
[4:25] meaning
[4:25] it was from larkin so according to the
[4:28] standards of brother branham's accusers
[4:30] he is not guilty of plagiarism
[4:34] second brother branham never ever said
[4:36] he got larkin's work
[4:38] by divine revelation his accusers have
[4:41] completely
[4:42] misunderstood brother branham's quotes
[4:44] taking them out of context
[4:47] now let's define plagiarism webster's
[4:50] online dictionary defines plagiarism
[4:53] in the two following ways first to steal
[4:56] and pass off the ideas or words of
[4:59] another
[5:00] as one's own use another's production
[5:03] without crediting the source
[5:05] as you'll soon see brother branham never
[5:07] passed off larkin's ideas
[5:09] as his own also brother branham credited
[5:12] numerous books and historians both
[5:15] before he preached
[5:16] these series during and after
[5:20] of course brother branham didn't give
[5:21] credit to his sources as often
[5:24] as a scholar because he wasn't a scholar
[5:27] he only had a seventh grade education
[5:29] and it appears he did the best to his
[5:31] ability
[5:33] the second definition says to commit
[5:36] literary theft
[5:38] present as new and original an idea or
[5:41] product
[5:41] derived from an existing source
[5:45] again i've never found brother branham
[5:47] presenting larkin's teachings
[5:49] as original or new that's just not true
[5:53] his accusers are jumping to conclusions
[5:56] and misunderstanding brother branham
[5:58] in humility i want to challenge anyone
[6:00] to show me where brother branham
[6:02] specifically
[6:03] and purposely committed plagiarism
[6:06] he may have forgot to cite his source
[6:09] but forgetting is not the same as
[6:10] purposely stealing someone's work
[6:13] as always i'm open to being corrected if
[6:16] i'm wrong about my claims
[6:19] here's a summary of brother branham's
[6:21] citations
[6:23] for the seven church ages brother
[6:25] branham cited numerous historians
[6:28] some by name both before during
[6:31] and after his 10 sermons in this series
[6:35] over 20 quotes have revealed he was
[6:38] reading
[6:38] other authors and historians he just
[6:42] didn't always cite them
[6:44] he was completely transparent saying he
[6:46] was gathering all the history books he
[6:48] could possibly get his hands on
[6:50] and also invited his congregation to
[6:53] bring all their history books as well
[6:55] brother branham never mentioned larkin's
[6:57] name during this series
[6:59] but he did specifically cite his work as
[7:01] history
[7:02] on a couple of occasions while preaching
[7:05] the seven church ages
[7:06] this proves the plagiarism accusation is
[7:10] false since he did not claim larkin's
[7:12] work was given
[7:13] from divine revelation before preaching
[7:17] the main content of this series
[7:19] at the very beginning of it in the first
[7:21] sermon of the series
[7:23] called the revelation of jesus christ
[7:25] brother branham made at least
[7:27] 10 references to historians
[7:30] saying the following one he had taken
[7:33] natural history
[7:34] from the most outstanding historians he
[7:36] knew of
[7:37] two he had five or six commentaries in
[7:40] his study room
[7:42] including hislop's two babylons fox's
[7:45] book of martyrs
[7:46] pre-nicean council about four books on
[7:49] that
[7:50] and the nicean council and all the
[7:52] history that we can find
[7:55] three he was going to give the
[7:56] historical
[7:58] of the original church and the writers
[8:01] and the historians
[8:02] and the angels of that age and the
[8:04] messages
[8:05] and the run of the church as it's come
[8:07] down through to this time
[8:10] four he was amazed to see how every
[8:12] prediction of the scripture
[8:14] hit solid with history just exactly
[8:19] five he said he had so many history
[8:21] books that he could not have brought all
[8:23] the books
[8:24] so he just wrote down each time upon
[8:27] paper
[8:28] little notes from history and
[8:30] commentaries that he might be
[8:32] able to just read from the notes instead
[8:34] of having the book
[8:35] and turning through the pages six he
[8:38] said his plan was to cite the historians
[8:40] in the church age book
[8:42] saying and then in the commentary i'll
[8:45] explain or the history
[8:46] who the historian was that said it and
[8:48] so forth
[8:50] seventh he said he was amazed as he
[8:53] studied history
[8:54] he said it was such a marvelous thing as
[8:56] he had been studying the histories
[9:00] eighth he said he was amazed to see how
[9:02] the bible predictions
[9:03] coincided with history saying it's
[9:06] amazing to see how
[9:08] every prediction of that scripture hit
[9:10] solid with history
[9:13] ninth he said he was going to take
[9:14] history and the bible and prove the
[9:16] truth
[9:17] saying he would take the history and
[9:19] everything and show you
[9:21] that it's exactly that way let you take
[9:23] the history yourself
[9:24] and read it and see what the bible said
[9:27] and then what the history said
[9:29] see how it meets just exactly like that
[9:33] intent he said his intention was to
[9:35] break down the book of revelation
[9:37] according to histories
[9:39] which is a citation and said he took it
[9:42] from commentaries
[9:44] he said each time his congregation would
[9:46] see him referring to pages
[9:48] from history that he had written there
[9:50] he said stuff that he had taken from
[9:52] commentaries
[9:53] and so forth let's listen to brother
[9:56] branham's quotes
[9:58] the natural history which is of the
[10:01] taken from the most outstanding
[10:03] historians that i know of
[10:06] i have laying in my study room right now
[10:10] about five or six commentaries
[10:13] officers two babbling stocks book of the
[10:15] martyrs
[10:17] other great books like the green i've
[10:20] seen
[10:20] council uh four books on that around 400
[10:24] pages in each book
[10:25] and they're the nice seeing council and
[10:28] all
[10:28] the history that we can because behind
[10:31] this from the magnetic tape
[10:33] we're going to write a commentary on the
[10:35] seven church ages to send to all the
[10:37] world that we can
[10:39] because we are in the last days
[10:42] we are at the end times
[10:46] philadelphia and sunday morning and
[10:48] sunday night
[10:49] the lady ocean a church age that we're
[10:52] living in
[10:52] giving the historical of the original
[10:55] church
[10:55] and the and the writers and the
[10:58] historians and the angels
[11:00] of that age and and the messages and the
[11:02] run of the church
[11:03] as it's come down to you to this time
[11:06] and it's amazing to see how
[11:08] every prediction of that scripture is
[11:10] solid with history
[11:23] i invite you to bring your bible
[11:26] every meeting and bring a pencil and
[11:29] paper
[11:30] and now with all the commentaries and so
[11:33] forth
[11:33] i could not have brought all the books
[11:35] so i just wrote write down each time
[11:38] uh on paper your little notes from
[11:41] history and commentaries and so forth
[11:44] that i might be
[11:44] able to just read it from the
[11:48] notes here instead of having the book
[11:50] and turning to the pages
[11:51] however when it comes to the scripture
[11:53] we'll use the bible
[11:55] and then in the commentary i'll explain
[11:57] or the history who the historian was and
[12:00] said it
[12:00] and so forth then in the course in the
[12:03] uh
[12:04] event of the coming book well then we
[12:07] can
[12:08] type it up all right then you can get
[12:10] everything
[12:11] did all right
[12:14] and it's such a marvelous thing as i've
[12:16] been studying the history
[12:19] to find how that church began
[12:22] and how i pulled off and what's taking
[12:25] place and to see that
[12:27] little seed of god move to every one of
[12:30] those ages
[12:32] completely go out nearly in one place
[12:36] we'll draw it out on the map take the
[12:38] history and everything and
[12:40] show you that it's exactly that way let
[12:43] you take the history yourself and read
[12:44] it
[12:45] see what the bible says and what the
[12:46] history says see
[12:48] it meets just exactly like that oh
[12:51] may we all not just take this as a
[12:53] lecture
[12:56] as i've said before now in this we're
[12:58] going to try to give a little breakdown
[13:01] now
[13:01] of the book according to the histories
[13:05] and so forth and each time when you see
[13:07] me referring to
[13:08] pages that i have written here it's
[13:10] stuff that i have taken from
[13:11] commentaries and so forth
[13:14] friends these ten references to
[13:17] historians
[13:18] and history books are enough to prove
[13:21] brother branham was not plagiarizing
[13:23] i believe it's proof brother branham is
[13:25] innocent of this accusation
[13:28] are brother branham's accusers unaware
[13:31] of these 10
[13:32] beforehand references if so that means
[13:35] they have not studied very deeply
[13:38] or they are purposely ignoring them in
[13:40] order to deceive people
[13:41] into leaving god's message only god
[13:44] knows the intentions of these accusers
[13:48] during the church ages brother branham
[13:50] referenced historians in general
[13:52] and some by name and yes he used lots of
[13:56] larkin's work
[13:57] such as all seven of larkin's
[13:59] descriptions
[14:00] of jesus's sevenfold glory of his person
[14:03] in the patmos vision you'll soon see
[14:06] brother branham considered larkin a
[14:07] historian
[14:09] and cited him as such now let's look in
[14:12] the ephesian church age sermon
[14:14] and see how brother branham told us
[14:15] where he got his dates from
[14:17] historians so while brother branham did
[14:20] not say larkin's name
[14:21] he cited where he got his dates from
[14:24] historians
[14:25] this proves brother branham did not
[14:26] plagiarize larkin but cited him
[14:29] indirectly brother branham never said
[14:31] the lord gave me the dates
[14:33] and i never read them from a book let's
[14:36] listen to the quotes
[14:38] remember as i said before sometimes all
[14:40] these things
[14:41] we might disagree upon them as far as
[14:45] as the theology is concerned and
[14:48] most of my dates i take from the
[14:50] authentic uh
[14:52] historians which really not interested
[14:55] in any side they just wrote down facts
[14:57] whatever it was
[14:58] what the churches did and of course the
[15:01] divine part of the interpretation
[15:03] i tried to place it up on there myself
[15:06] the best that i know how god
[15:13] [Laughter]
[15:24] history and now we're coming down all so
[15:27] patterned
[15:28] to the time
[15:31] there's not no three gods and three gods
[15:35] is pagan and heathen
[15:37] and it was brought over and if you just
[15:53] in facts what happened
[15:57] it is also noteworthy during the
[15:59] ephesian church age sermon
[16:01] that brother branham said he received
[16:02] the revelation of who the angel
[16:04] messengers were
[16:05] from the holy spirit that is true as
[16:08] larkin did not identify the names of the
[16:11] angel messengers
[16:12] larkin did believe the angel messengers
[16:15] were humans though
[16:17] brother branham knew the messengers by
[16:18] revelation
[16:20] not by history larkin never taught
[16:22] specific names
[16:23] of the angel messengers here larkin did
[16:27] teach the angels were human
[16:29] in his book of revelation from 1919.
[16:33] he said and i quote in his right hand
[16:35] seven stars
[16:37] we are told in verse 20 that the seven
[16:39] stars
[16:40] stand for the angels of the seven
[16:42] churches these angels are not
[16:44] angelic beings but the messengers or
[16:47] ministers of the churches
[16:49] so larkin never identified who the seven
[16:52] angel messengers were
[16:54] he never mentioned saint martin nor
[16:57] saint columba in his book
[16:58] and there is no mention of elijah to
[17:02] laodicea
[17:17] that i have got here and know by
[17:18] revelation that they was the angels to
[17:20] the church
[17:21] they had the same ministry that these
[17:23] did at the beginning
[17:25] and that ministry cannot change it must
[17:28] save pentecost
[17:30] all the way through
[17:33] additionally in the ephesian church age
[17:35] sermon brother branham encourages
[17:37] congregation to bring history to the
[17:39] services
[17:40] this is not the behavior of a plagiarist
[17:43] let's listen to the quote
[17:50] [Applause]
[17:56] [Laughter]
[18:06] [Applause]
[18:12] [Applause]
[18:13] try to give god praise for choosing
[18:15] before the foundation of the world
[18:18] how did saint mark and all of those
[18:20] giving them praise god praised that they
[18:22] called
[18:23] and people speaking of him said he was
[18:25] chosen before the foundation of the
[18:27] world that's treacherous
[18:28] those brothers have lined up with god
[18:32] next in the summer in church age sermon
[18:35] brother branham directly quotes from a
[18:37] church history book
[18:38] how did it happen by rachel hasseltine
[18:42] and said it was going to be taken off
[18:43] and used in his church age book
[18:46] then you hear brother branham reading a
[18:48] reminder he made
[18:49] himself to read out of history let's
[18:52] listen to these quotes
[18:54] another thing that i'd like to read you
[18:57] it's found in the book um how did it
[19:00] happen
[19:03] and this is by the historians and um
[19:07] how did it happen but r.c hazelton the
[19:09] history of the early churches
[19:12] and here on page 180 the spiritual gifts
[19:16] in irena's town a.d
[19:20] 177 to 202 uh reason i'm quoting this
[19:24] it's going on tape you see and it'll be
[19:26] taken off on books
[19:29] that's people who don't not interested
[19:31] in either side they're just telling the
[19:33] truth
[19:33] it's historian
[19:36] arrhenius yes i had to know your own
[19:38] iranians about
[19:39] to read this history that the reason
[19:42] irenaeus was chosen
[19:43] is because that he had the signs of the
[19:46] pentecostal original church
[19:48] following him back to larkin while it's
[19:52] true brother branham never said larkin's
[19:54] name while preaching the seven church
[19:55] ages sermons
[19:57] he directly referenced his work as
[19:59] coming from history
[20:00] three times in the sermon the pergamian
[20:04] church age
[20:05] brother random quoted larkin's work on
[20:07] atlas
[20:08] and referenced it from history so
[20:11] brother branham cited larkin
[20:12] indirectly and said he got larkin's
[20:15] information and dates from history
[20:18] brother branham was not a plagiarist
[20:20] let's listen to the quote
[20:22] and i'll put larkin's quote side by side
[20:24] with brother branhams
[20:27] and as i approach this scripture tonight
[20:29] father
[20:30] oh i'm insufficient god there's none of
[20:34] us sufficient
[20:35] we admit we know nothing father but
[20:38] we're solemnly depending on the holy
[20:40] spirit
[20:40] and he might reveal to us as we unfold
[20:44] through our
[20:45] our mental knowledge that you gave us
[20:47] the history
[20:48] may the holy spirit give the spiritual
[20:50] application
[20:51] to our hearts granted father for we wait
[20:54] on thee
[20:55] in the name of jesus thy son amen
[21:00] now in the early years or just before
[21:03] this taken place a few years
[21:06] satan's seat there
[21:09] the great um uh
[21:14] i guess you would call him a pre-king
[21:17] priest of the chaldeans
[21:23] the hierarchy of babylon
[21:28] changed his seat when the
[21:31] persians was pursuing him and he left
[21:35] babylon his name was a-t-t-a-l-u-s
[21:39] actilist the great king
[21:42] priest of babylon when the
[21:46] persians came in and taking over
[21:50] babylon running out the chaldeans
[21:54] atlas the king priest
[21:57] fled and took his seat at
[22:00] pergas the satan's
[22:04] seat is where you are dwelling
[22:08] good now that's why i go
[22:11] back to pick up this history out of
[22:14] the uh church history finding word
[22:18] until i've taken place where he said you
[22:21] are dwelling
[22:22] where satan's seed is
[22:26] our brother i'm quoting history i have
[22:30] thousands of catholic friends and
[22:33] they're just as much
[22:34] friends as protestants are
[22:37] i'm not quoting that from my mind that's
[22:40] the history
[22:42] give you a page and number of a sacred
[22:44] history
[22:45] it seems like george washington and
[22:47] abraham lincoln and
[22:49] the battle of gettysburg and so forth
[22:52] sure all those things are history i'm
[22:55] quoting here
[22:58] in this quote friends listen here he
[23:00] wanted to have the references in his
[23:02] study to back up his claims
[23:04] this shows he was just ignorant about
[23:06] scholarly citations
[23:08] which makes sense because he only had a
[23:10] seventh grade education
[23:13] i come from a catholic background see i
[23:16] got their facts of our faith in their
[23:17] books and your protestants and the
[23:19] baptists and whatever you believe
[23:20] they're in my
[23:21] study so i studied so if anybody says
[23:23] anything whoop i can back you right up
[23:24] to your own thing
[23:26] so the hours come for this to go out
[23:30] in the third tier in church age brother
[23:32] branham cited larkin again
[23:34] in regards to the meaning of the name
[23:36] and also history
[23:38] about jezebel shortly after quoting from
[23:41] larkin
[23:42] brother branham said he was gleaning out
[23:44] of the pages of history
[23:45] and digging into history for all he
[23:48] could find
[23:49] again these are not the words of a
[23:51] plagiarist
[23:52] let's listen to the quotes and compare
[23:54] them with larkin's work
[23:56] now this great saint here was
[24:00] he was a great man of god i've got his
[24:03] history finally written down here
[24:06] first the fourth church age thotara
[24:09] it means to be relaxed loose
[24:12] or hazy is this a illegitimate time
[24:18] from 606 to 1500
[24:22] all right this jezebel now she was a
[24:25] daughter of abraham that's true
[24:27] a princess of an idolater at that time
[24:30] when the royal family
[24:32] her royal family was famed by cruel
[24:35] savage loyalty to balaam
[24:39] her father was a priest of the idol of
[24:43] a-s-t-a-r-t-e i don't know how to
[24:45] pronounce it
[24:46] i just picked it up in the history ahab
[24:49] used this
[24:50] strategy like constantine this great
[24:53] powerful nation right next to israel
[24:55] so therefore
[24:58] here brother branham said he was
[25:00] gleaning out of pages of history
[25:02] or larkin after nearly quoting larkin's
[25:05] work
[25:06] this proves he was citing his work
[25:10] as i said last night that's the only
[25:12] thing he ever done is sounded anything
[25:14] like he was
[25:14] for the church as far as i could ever
[25:16] clean out any pages of history
[25:18] and many other scholars say the same
[25:20] thing we know nothing about his
[25:21] conversion
[25:25] here brother branham says he was digging
[25:27] into history books for
[25:28] all he could find everywhere
[25:31] but the true genuine light is a
[25:33] pentecostal
[25:41] flame of experience and stayed alive
[25:43] from pentecost down to this time
[25:49] friends even after preaching the seven
[25:51] church ages
[25:52] brother branham cited two more history
[25:54] books one from
[25:55] edmund broadbent who lived from 1861 to
[25:59] 1945
[26:00] and the other from rachel hazeltine
[26:03] which i mentioned earlier
[26:05] how did it happen and her book was
[26:07] published in 1958.
[26:10] notice brother branham read the history
[26:12] work from a woman
[26:15] here's the quotes studying in the
[26:18] early history of the church
[26:22] broadbands and hazelton's and many of
[26:25] their comments
[26:26] on it i seen fathers and
[26:30] i want somebody to show me where
[26:33] saint patrick was ever a roman catholic
[26:38] there is no such thing he protested that
[26:40] roman church
[26:44] he was the nephew of saint martin
[26:48] i was reading here in a woman that wrote
[26:50] a hazelton mrs hazel and others of the
[26:53] icing council said that she went to the
[26:55] card
[26:56] at the oxford to get the the card for
[26:58] the um
[26:59] the life of saint uh martin and this
[27:03] fellow said but he wasn't canonized
[27:06] by the roman church certainly not he
[27:08] protested the thing
[27:10] he started st patrick the man who stayed
[27:14] with the word of god built their own
[27:15] schools
[27:19] as we move on from the seven church ages
[27:22] any sincere heart would admit brother
[27:24] branham never ever claimed every single
[27:27] word
[27:27] thought or interpretation from this
[27:29] series was original
[27:31] over 20 quotes have revealed he was
[27:34] reading
[27:35] other authors and historians he just
[27:38] didn't always cite them
[27:40] do you think brother branham deserves
[27:41] the derogatory label
[27:43] of plagiarist after citing history over
[27:47] 20 times
[27:48] in this sermon series
[27:53] daniel's 70 weeks citations
[27:56] in his three sermons related to daniel
[27:58] 70 weeks
[27:59] gabriel's instructions to daniel on july
[28:02] 30th the am service
[28:04] the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit
[28:06] to daniel on july 30th the pm service
[28:10] and the 70th week of daniel on august
[28:12] 8th
[28:13] brother branham mentioned larkin by name
[28:15] twice
[28:16] even saying he was very grateful to dr
[28:19] larkin
[28:19] for his work in the daniel 70 week
[28:22] sermon
[28:23] which was the third and final sermon in
[28:25] this series
[28:26] for a second time this proves brother
[28:29] branham was
[28:30] not guilty of plagiarism on the morning
[28:33] of july 30th 1961
[28:35] brother branham preached gabriel's
[28:37] instructions to daniel
[28:39] in this sermon brother branham told
[28:41] everyone he'd been studying larkin's
[28:42] work on this subject
[28:44] but couldn't understand it yet here's
[28:46] the quote
[28:48] and then i have been reading
[28:51] dr larkin's book dr
[28:55] smith's book dr scofield's
[28:59] notes different commentaries from man
[29:03] everywhere and yet i cannot
[29:06] put theirs together to make it come out
[29:09] right see
[29:10] so this week i'm planning on
[29:14] been visiting the library in kentucky on
[29:17] some of the ancient astronomy
[29:19] of the calendars and times and pick it
[29:22] up from the libraries and so forth all
[29:25] the ancient
[29:26] books that i can and what little
[29:29] i can do and having my trust solemnly in
[29:33] jesus christ you reveal it to me
[29:35] because i do not want it to
[29:39] say i know this and i know that he knows
[29:41] my heart is listening
[29:43] but i want it that i might enlighten
[29:46] his people therefore i believe that he
[29:51] will give it to me i do not know as yet
[29:55] but i'm trusting him for next sunday
[29:58] because that'll be the tremendous part
[30:00] the next sunday to know and place those
[30:02] 70 weeks
[30:07] that evening brother branham preached
[30:09] the second sermon the six-fold purpose
[30:11] of gabriel's visit to daniel
[30:14] a week later brother branham preached
[30:16] the meaning of daniel's 70 weeks
[30:18] which agreed with larkin's understanding
[30:21] in many aspects
[30:23] brother branham expressed gratitude to
[30:24] larkin specifically for his work
[30:27] again clearing brother branham from any
[30:30] charges
[30:31] of plagiarism let's listen
[30:35] and so no doubt that down through the
[30:37] age there has been
[30:39] hundreds times hundreds of people
[30:42] scholars
[30:43] abled men trying to explain what these
[30:45] 70 weeks were
[30:47] now i've read many of their commentaries
[30:49] on
[30:51] and uh i'm very grateful
[30:54] to mr smith of the adventist church for
[30:58] his views
[30:59] i'm very grateful to dr larkin
[31:02] of his views i'm grateful to all these
[31:06] great scholars
[31:08] for their views on this and in reading
[31:11] them it enlightens me
[31:12] much that i can find places that looks
[31:15] right
[31:16] but to get the views that i i thought
[31:19] that i would like to explain
[31:21] i searched through the encyclopedia of
[31:24] time
[31:25] to find out what time meant
[31:29] before moving on i must again show how
[31:31] brother branham's accusers
[31:33] have very little understanding of
[31:35] brother branham's ministry
[31:37] either on purpose or because of
[31:39] ignorance
[31:41] brother branham's accusers say he
[31:43] claimed he disagreed with larkin
[31:45] on daniel's 70 weeks but proceeded
[31:48] to plagiarize his work here's the false
[31:51] accusation
[31:52] and it proves their misunderstanding and
[31:55] i quote
[31:56] william branham told his audience in his
[31:58] sermon on the 70 weeks of daniel
[32:00] that he didn't know it yet but was going
[32:03] to preach on it that morning
[32:05] that he'd studied larkin's work but
[32:07] didn't agree with them
[32:08] and that what they were going to hear
[32:10] was going to come from a revelation that
[32:12] william branham was trusting god to give
[32:14] him
[32:15] this is how william branham lifted
[32:16] himself up to become the messenger of
[32:18] god
[32:19] of our age end quote this statement is
[32:23] not true
[32:24] the truth is brother branham's accusers
[32:26] simply fail to look at the dates of the
[32:28] three sermons on this subject
[32:30] brother branham said he didn't know yet
[32:32] about daniel 70 weeks
[32:34] but that was a week before he preached
[32:37] it
[32:38] so obviously in the week leading up to
[32:40] preaching daniel 70 weeks
[32:43] through prayer to god and study of
[32:45] larkin's teachings
[32:46] brother branham came to understand
[32:48] larkin's teachings
[32:49] and agreed with and taught some of them
[32:53] then on the day he preached daniel 70
[32:55] weeks he said he was grateful to larkin
[32:58] so a week before he preached daniel 70
[33:00] weeks he didn't understand it
[33:02] but a week later on august 6th he said
[33:04] the following
[33:06] i'm very grateful to dr lark
[33:09] of his views so the understanding came
[33:14] to him
[33:14] during that week of study but brother
[33:17] branham's accusers failed to understand
[33:19] the context
[33:20] of brother branham's statements again
[33:22] either on purpose to deceive people
[33:24] into leaving god's message or because of
[33:28] their weak
[33:28] research for the seven seals
[33:32] sermon series brother branham cited
[33:34] numerous historians
[33:36] before during and after the ten sermons
[33:39] in this series
[33:40] he used some of larkin's ideas which he
[33:43] admitted
[33:44] but the main revelations of the seven
[33:46] seals were extremely different from
[33:48] larkin
[33:49] as larkin taught the seals opened
[33:52] sequentially
[33:53] once the tribulation started but anyone
[33:56] who's honestly studied brother branham's
[33:58] teachings on the seven seals
[34:00] knows that he taught the seals open
[34:02] sequentially
[34:03] once the church ages started which was a
[34:06] 2
[34:06] 000 year difference from clarence larkin
[34:10] brother branham never cited larkin by
[34:12] name during this sermon series
[34:14] yet he cited other authors but a year
[34:17] later he cited larkin
[34:19] regarding the seven seals in the sermon
[34:22] the feast of the trumpets
[34:23] in 1964. now let's hear brother branham
[34:27] cite larkin
[34:28] a year and four months after preaching
[34:30] the seven seals
[34:32] let's listen to the quote then just
[34:35] leaving it at that and pursuing after a
[34:38] while we preach on the seals not knowing
[34:40] what the seals was
[34:42] i had my own idea as every minister does
[34:45] of reading maybe what other man had said
[34:48] and believing as much as i possible with
[34:50] them
[34:51] on the things that they had brought up
[34:54] their conclusion
[34:55] uh i'd read the book of mr smith
[34:58] your eyes smith which is the adventist a
[35:01] teacher
[35:02] and i read his uh his thoughts on it and
[35:06] i
[35:06] read uh mr larkin i'd read all so many
[35:10] different ones of their commentaries on
[35:12] this but
[35:13] uh somehow or other i thought i had
[35:17] a little view of it myself that might be
[35:20] if a place is different but
[35:23] trying one time just speaking three
[35:26] subjects the first
[35:27] or the four subjects of the four horse
[35:29] riders i preached on it four nights one
[35:31] on one
[35:32] horse and the other but then just before
[35:35] it happened
[35:36] i was given a vision which is on tape as
[35:39] you all know
[35:39] sirs what time is it
[35:43] again just like in the seven church age
[35:46] series
[35:47] before brother branham preached one seal
[35:49] in the seven seals series
[35:51] he cited many great outstanding teachers
[35:54] let's listen to the quote
[35:58] i would have absolutely
[36:02] today and i hope that people are
[36:05] spiritual
[36:07] i would have had a horrible mistake on
[36:10] that
[36:10] if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock the
[36:13] day when the holy spirit came in the
[36:15] room
[36:16] and corrected me on something that i was
[36:18] writing down to faith
[36:22] i was taken from an old context
[36:26] i had nothing on it i don't know what
[36:28] the second seal is
[36:30] no more than nothing but i've got some
[36:32] old context of something i
[36:35] spoke on several years ago and wrote it
[36:37] down and i
[36:38] gathered this context context from dr
[36:41] smith
[36:42] many great outstanding teachers that uh
[36:45] i
[36:46] gathered and all of them believed that
[36:48] so i wrote it down and i was fixing to
[36:50] say well
[36:51] i'll study from that standpoint and
[36:53] there about 12 o'clock in the date
[36:56] the holy spirit just swept back down
[36:58] into the room and the whole thing is
[37:00] opened up to me there
[37:01] [Applause]
[37:04] this of this first seal being opened
[37:08] i'm as positive as i'm standing here
[37:10] tonight
[37:12] that this is the gospel truth
[37:15] [Applause]
[37:17] because if a revelation is contrary to
[37:20] the word that it isn't
[37:21] revelation and you know this some of the
[37:24] stuff can look
[37:25] so absolutely true and yet isn't true
[37:28] it looks like it is but it isn't
[37:33] also at the end of the seven seals
[37:36] series
[37:37] brother branham told us how he'd studied
[37:39] during that entire week
[37:41] he'd first read the books larkin uriah
[37:44] smith and the others
[37:46] and then wait for the vision from the
[37:48] lord let's listen as brother branham
[37:51] says
[37:51] every day he was picking up the notes
[37:53] and books of all the writers
[37:56] and then waiting for the true
[37:57] interpretation from the holy ghost
[38:00] this has been a tremendous week for me
[38:03] i'm tired my mind is tired
[38:06] because i i have with the best that i
[38:09] could do
[38:10] and something strange going on every day
[38:12] i would be amazed to walk in
[38:14] the room and be there for a few minutes
[38:17] and see something's turning completely
[38:19] around
[38:20] and here i go in there i pick up the
[38:22] notes i pick up books of
[38:24] dr smith you're a smith and all all the
[38:27] writers and read and read down in their
[38:29] books i say now here's the sixth seal
[38:31] here's the fourth seal now what does
[38:33] this man say he'd say what was this
[38:35] there that
[38:36] i look over here and get another man he
[38:38] said it was such-and-such
[38:39] and it looked like it just it just
[38:41] didn't work ryan
[38:42] and i thought well what is it lord i
[38:45] walk up down the floor a while
[38:46] i kneel down pray go back pick up the
[38:48] bible sit down
[38:49] read walk back and forth then all of a
[38:52] sudden when i got
[38:53] white here just unfolded like that then
[38:55] i grab a pen right quick
[38:56] no writing it down like that whatever i
[38:58] was seeing and doing watch it like after
[39:00] god blew down
[39:01] then i'd take the rest of the day and go
[39:03] down and chase this out
[39:05] and see if it tied all the way down
[39:06] through the scriptures
[39:08] then it proved all things right i got
[39:11] this year and i think now
[39:12] as many people had visions there's many
[39:14] been revelations if it's contrary to the
[39:16] word leave it alone
[39:17] try it leave it alone now now
[39:20] that i run this down like this right
[39:23] next to that jot down a little picture i
[39:25] thought well the class will be glad you
[39:26] hear this cause entire sharing
[39:28] hi sharon let's see what does it say
[39:29] here yes yeah here it is right here
[39:32] then bring it back to the bible and tie
[39:34] the thing down to the week there it is
[39:35] on tapes
[39:36] you're welcome to them and i have did it
[39:40] to the best of my knowledge under
[39:41] christian fellowship
[39:43] grace of god to all man
[39:46] by jesus christ i've done the very best
[39:49] that i know how
[39:52] looking at the seven seals it seems
[39:54] brother branham studied for the seven
[39:56] seals in similar fashion
[39:58] as the seven church ages as proven by
[40:01] the quote from the seventh seal
[40:03] now let's compare larkin and branham's
[40:06] interpretations
[40:08] of the seven seals you will see a vast
[40:11] difference
[40:12] a difference of over two thousand years
[40:15] for the first seal
[40:17] there are some similarities between the
[40:19] two
[40:20] as larkin taught the white horse rider
[40:22] was the person of the antichrist
[40:25] but larkin said the white horse rider
[40:28] was the antichrist
[40:29] who would rise during the tribulation
[40:31] period
[40:32] during daniel's last and 70th week
[40:36] brother branham taught much differently
[40:38] saying the white horse rider was the
[40:40] spirit of the antichrist
[40:42] not the person of the antichrist who
[40:44] rode at the beginning of the first
[40:46] church age
[40:47] this is a two thousand year difference
[40:50] larkin said its future
[40:51] branham said its past so brother branham
[40:54] did not plagiarize larkin
[40:57] larkin said and i quote in other words
[40:59] this white horse rider is the antichrist
[41:02] he is the prince who is to come of
[41:04] daniel's vision of the 70 weeks
[41:07] and who will confirm the covenant for
[41:08] one week the last or
[41:10] 70th week with daniel's people the jews
[41:14] daniel 9 27 end quote
[41:18] larkin goes on to say the rise of this
[41:20] white horse rider
[41:21] necessarily and to dates the beginning
[41:24] of the 70th week
[41:26] or the seven years of his reign for he
[41:28] must have reached a position of power
[41:31] to make a covenant with the jews at the
[41:33] beginning of the week
[41:35] but he does not become the beast as
[41:37] described in chapter
[41:38] 13 verses 1 through 8 until the middle
[41:41] of the week
[41:42] that is until after satan is cast out of
[41:44] the heavenlies
[41:46] and incarnates himself in him end quote
[41:49] larkin said the rapture will take place
[41:51] before the white horse rider rides in
[41:53] the tribulation
[41:55] quote his rise to power and the
[41:57] rebuilding of babylon will take time
[41:59] so the rapture of the church will
[42:01] doubtless and to date
[42:02] the beginning of the week by some years
[42:05] end quote
[42:06] and the source is the book of revelation
[42:09] by clarence larkin
[42:10] 1919 brother branham said the white
[42:13] horse rider was the spirit of antichrist
[42:16] that rode at the beginning of the church
[42:18] ages here's the quote
[42:21] here he is he's the antichrist he
[42:23] started riding the first church age
[42:25] now he rides on down on down through
[42:27] every age
[42:31] also brother branham taught the
[42:33] tribulation was connected to daniel's
[42:34] 70th week
[42:36] in the future after the rapture of the
[42:38] church
[42:39] here's the quote now in the last part
[42:43] the 70th week the last part of it
[42:46] will be during the time of the
[42:47] tribulation period at the rapture of the
[42:49] church
[42:50] and here's the three and a half years
[42:51] here that
[42:53] it will be confirmed to them again by
[42:56] prophets
[42:58] the moses and elijah
[43:01] revelations 11.
[43:06] looking at the second seal again there
[43:09] are some similarities between the two
[43:11] but their timing is completely different
[43:14] larkin said the red horse rider is the
[43:15] antichrist during the tribulation
[43:18] while brother branham said the red horse
[43:19] rider was the catholic church gaining
[43:22] power of church and state
[43:23] in order to kill anyone who disagreed
[43:25] with her through my research of history
[43:28] it seems this persecution of the united
[43:30] roman church state
[43:32] began around 385 a.d
[43:36] when priscillian a holy ghost-filled
[43:38] bishop of spain and six others
[43:41] were said to be the first saints
[43:42] executed by the false church
[43:45] in 385 a.d and i got this from
[43:48] hasseltine
[43:49] pages 260 to 265
[43:53] and broadbent page 37.
[43:56] so larkin said the second seal's future
[43:59] brother branham said it's past
[44:01] larkin said and i quote this seems to
[44:04] imply that the antichrist will not have
[44:06] everything his own way
[44:08] and that his autocratic methods will
[44:10] lead to insubordination
[44:12] and civil wars among the nations under
[44:14] some great leader represented
[44:16] by the writer of the red horse whose
[44:18] great sword is symbolical
[44:20] of the awful destruction of human life
[44:22] that will follow
[44:24] this is a fulfillment of first
[44:25] thessalonians 5
[44:27] 3 when they shall say peace and safety
[44:29] then sudden destruction
[44:31] cometh upon them as travail upon a woman
[44:34] with child
[44:34] and they shall not escape we learn from
[44:37] this seal that wars are likely to break
[44:39] out at any time
[44:40] and that there will be no peace on earth
[44:42] until the return
[44:43] of the prince of peace end quote
[44:47] in this quote brother branham says the
[44:48] red horse rider
[44:50] rides during the church ages which was
[44:52] again a 2000 year difference
[44:54] from larkin notice
[44:59] the change of color of these horses
[45:02] same rider
[45:05] change of color of horses and a horse is
[45:09] a beast
[45:10] and the beast in the bible and her
[45:12] symbol represents a power
[45:15] the same system right on another color
[45:19] tower from the innocent white to a
[45:23] bloody red
[45:28] the council was held and they elected
[45:32] a head bishop
[45:35] and then by doing this they united
[45:38] church and stayed together
[45:41] then he dropped his bowl
[45:45] he got off his white horse he got on his
[45:48] red horse
[45:50] or he can kill anybody that don't agree
[45:52] with him
[46:00] the third seal there's not many
[46:02] similarities between the two on this
[46:04] subject
[46:05] larkin seems to place this seal in the
[46:08] tribulation
[46:09] at the time of a war that causes all the
[46:12] farmers to leave their crops
[46:14] causing a famine yet the world would
[46:16] depend on olive trees and grapevines
[46:18] for medicinal purposes brother branham
[46:21] taught the black horse rider represented
[46:23] the roman catholic church
[46:25] during the dark ages which began around
[46:27] 1095
[46:28] a.d again over 1 000 years before
[46:32] larkin's guests brother branham said
[46:35] rome was capturing the wealth of the
[46:36] world
[46:37] stripping her subjects of all their
[46:39] wealth this included the sale of
[46:41] indulgences
[46:42] which began around 1320 a.d
[46:45] rome grew rich by controlling religion
[46:48] economics and agriculture
[46:51] brother braham said the oil and wine was
[46:52] the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:54] and the stimulation that comes with it
[46:57] larkin said
[46:57] it was literal wine and oil brother bram
[47:00] did not plagiarize larkin on this third
[47:02] seal
[47:03] larkin said its future and natural oil
[47:06] and wine
[47:06] brother branham said its past and
[47:08] spiritual oil and wine
[47:11] larkin said and i quote when all
[47:13] able-bodied men are drafted for war and
[47:16] no one left to sow and harvest the crops
[47:18] then famine is sure to follow so great
[47:21] will be the famine that it will take uh
[47:22] daenerys
[47:24] a day's wages to buy a choenix
[47:28] two pints of wheat the daily ration of a
[47:31] slave
[47:32] what is meant by not hurting the oil and
[47:34] wine may be
[47:35] that as the olive tree and grapevine do
[47:37] not bear their fruit
[47:38] until some months after the wheat and
[47:40] barley harvest
[47:41] and grow without attention their crops
[47:44] would not be so much affected by war
[47:46] and therefore the olive trees and
[47:48] grapevines were not to be ruthlessly
[47:50] destroyed by invaders for they were
[47:52] needed for
[47:53] medicinal purposes end quote
[47:56] here brother branham says the third seal
[47:59] took place
[48:00] during the church ages he
[48:03] started riding him
[48:06] in the time of the dark ages
[48:10] that's what the dark horse represented
[48:13] the dark ages for
[48:14] it was a time of midnight to the true
[48:17] believers
[48:18] that
[48:22] for the fourth seal larkin said this is
[48:24] a pestilence that follows the war of the
[48:26] third seal
[48:27] again during the tribulation or the 70th
[48:30] week of daniel
[48:31] brother branham taught the antichrist or
[48:33] spirit of death
[48:35] is on his last horse now because of the
[48:37] political power of the roman catholic
[48:39] church
[48:40] but he also said this pale horse will
[48:42] ride through the tribulation
[48:44] and then gather his evil subjects for
[48:46] the final fight
[48:47] between life and death which takes place
[48:49] at armageddon
[48:51] larkin said and i quote the reference
[48:54] here is clearly to some great pestilence
[48:56] that shall come upon the earth after a
[48:58] devastating war followed by famine
[49:01] during which the dead are left unburied
[49:03] a pestilence is sure to follow
[49:05] the fourth part of the earth over which
[49:07] the pestilence shall sweep
[49:09] will probably be that part of the
[49:10] eastern hemisphere covered by the
[49:12] revived roman empire
[49:14] end quote here's where brother ram says
[49:17] the pale horse rider is on his last ride
[49:19] now
[49:20] and continues down through the
[49:25] tribulation
[49:27] as he appears
[49:31] on his right this last ride he's on his
[49:34] last now
[49:37] now on this mix colored whirly
[49:40] pale sick horse just think of it
[49:46] you know that's a bad thing
[49:49] now watch where he gathers them from the
[49:50] four corners of the earth
[49:53] they're gathering now for the showdown
[49:56] the showdown will be at armageddon
[49:58] according to the word
[49:59] i think on the pale horse
[50:04] riding on it with a death tatter with
[50:06] the name tactile name
[50:07] death
[50:11] for the fifth seal both larkin and
[50:13] brother branham agree that these are
[50:15] jews
[50:16] but larkin taught that these souls are
[50:18] saved
[50:19] after the rapture brother branham taught
[50:21] they were jews saved
[50:22] from the time of israel's blindness at
[50:25] jesus
[50:26] crucifixion 2000 years ago to the
[50:29] present day
[50:30] so all the blinded jews from the days of
[50:32] jesus to the present day
[50:36] larkin said and i quote but they were
[50:38] not the martyrs of the christian church
[50:40] for they had been resurrected and taken
[50:42] up with the church
[50:43] these martyrs are those who will be
[50:45] killed for the word of god and their
[50:47] testimony
[50:48] after the church is caught out end quote
[50:53] here's branham saying the souls under
[50:54] the altar are blinded jews from the time
[50:56] of christ
[50:57] to the present i notice this
[51:02] now these souls under the altar
[51:06] uh uh the this these um souls
[51:10] understanding now it's under the altar
[51:13] why
[51:13] they were martyred by sinful man like
[51:17] eichmann a jew
[51:20] and hitler
[51:25] but they stayed true to what they
[51:27] believed
[51:29] and they killed them because they were
[51:31] jews
[51:33] now if they had been blinded god said
[51:35] let alone
[51:37] they're not worthy but then if they was
[51:39] blinded by god his grace reached down to
[51:42] him
[51:44] [Applause]
[51:49] one of amen a room because all israel
[51:52] will be saved
[51:54] everyone has his name written that's
[51:56] right
[51:57] jesus give them robes like joseph did to
[52:00] his brethren a tithe
[52:04] notice now though they had tried to get
[52:07] rid of joseph
[52:08] is grace reached to him though they
[52:10] tried to get rid of jesus he still comes
[52:11] that background because he's dying to
[52:13] get beat on a white robe
[52:22] the sixth seal here's the first time
[52:25] larkin and branham agree
[52:27] about both the timing and the details of
[52:29] the seal
[52:30] in the sixth seal branham used similar
[52:33] terminology to larkin
[52:34] but it wasn't plagiarism as branham
[52:37] cited both historians
[52:38] and larkin by name larkin said and i
[52:42] quote
[52:42] these physical convulsions will be the
[52:44] earth's travail pains
[52:46] as she labors to bring forth the new
[52:48] creation of this millennial age
[52:51] end quote here's where branham teaches
[52:54] something very
[52:59] the birth similar the world is trying
[53:01] she's travailing isaiah said whatsoever
[53:04] she's in trying to bring forth a new
[53:07] world for the millennium
[53:20] right she's in travail that's the reason
[53:23] that
[53:23] uh the we're in travail
[53:27] bring forth the bride everything is
[53:30] travailing and groaning
[53:32] see there's something fixed to happen
[53:34] this sixth play
[53:36] that's our goal for the seventh seal
[53:40] branham used a lot of larkin's
[53:41] terminology but added something
[53:44] larkin didn't teach the fact that the
[53:46] seventh seal is the literal
[53:48] day and hour of the rapture remember
[53:51] that larkin said the church is taken out
[53:53] or raptured
[53:54] before the first seal brother branham
[53:57] taught the literal opening of the
[53:59] seventh seal
[54:00] is the rapture larkin said and i quote
[54:04] we must not forget the seventh seal
[54:06] includes all that happens during the
[54:07] sounding of the trumpets
[54:09] and the pouring out of the vows and so
[54:11] extends down to the ushering in of the
[54:13] millennium
[54:15] to illustrate a rocket fired into the
[54:17] air may burst into seven stars
[54:19] and one of these stars into seven other
[54:21] stars and one of the second group of
[54:23] stars
[54:24] into a third group of seven stars so the
[54:26] seventh seal includes the seven trumpets
[54:29] and the seventh trumpet includes the
[54:31] seven vowels
[54:32] the silence that filed the breaking of
[54:34] the seventh seal was preparatory
[54:36] to what was to follow during the
[54:38] sounding of the trumpets
[54:39] and the pouring out of the vows this
[54:41] silence was something remarkable
[54:43] the four and twenty elders ceased their
[54:45] heart playing the angels hushed their
[54:47] voices
[54:48] and the cherubim and the seraphim and
[54:50] all the hosts of heaven were silent
[54:52] and so great was the silence that all
[54:53] heaven was awed by it
[54:56] and to add to the noticeableness of it
[54:58] john
[54:59] added that it lasted for half an hour
[55:01] now a half an
[55:02] hour is not long when engaged in some
[55:04] pleasant employment
[55:06] but it causes a nerve breaking tension
[55:08] when we do not know what is going to
[55:10] happen
[55:11] and when a life is at stake a minute or
[55:13] even a few seconds
[55:15] seem to be ours the suspense of the half
[55:18] hour of silence
[55:19] in heaven was intense but why that half
[55:22] hour of silence
[55:23] what did it portend it was the period of
[55:26] silent preparation for the awful
[55:28] judgments
[55:28] that were to burst forth in the earth
[55:31] under the trumpets and vials
[55:33] end quote here's brother branham saying
[55:36] the seventh seal is the day and hour of
[55:39] christ's coming
[55:41] what is it it's the thing that
[55:44] jesus said even the angels of heaven
[55:47] didn't know nothing about it see
[55:51] he didn't know it himself amen he said
[55:54] only god would know it amen
[55:57] but he told us when we begin to see
[55:58] these signs coming up
[56:08] because the seventh seal there was
[56:10] silence no one knew there's a minor hour
[56:12] that christ would come as
[56:13] he revealed it to us before leaving the
[56:17] seven seals
[56:18] here's a few more quotes showing brother
[56:19] branham citing his sources
[56:21] again proving brother branham was not a
[56:24] plagiarist
[56:25] in the second seal brother branham cited
[56:27] the book of the pre nicean fathers
[56:31] that was ironious about
[56:35] 400 years after after the
[56:38] death of christ he said when this
[56:41] last age comes in that's
[56:44] in the the uh pre-nicee of counsel
[56:48] you fellowship that read the the study
[56:52] of scripture and study that i mean study
[56:54] the
[56:55] history of the bible uh you find that in
[56:58] priet and the pre-nicee of counsel
[57:01] i think it's the first book or the
[57:02] second book you'll find it
[57:07] here during the third seal he was
[57:09] studying each day as usual
[57:11] meaning he was reading history books and
[57:13] waiting for the holy ghost
[57:15] to show the meaning this is proven by
[57:17] his comments
[57:18] in the seven seal sermon quote we
[57:20] already heard
[57:22] again tonight we've assembled together
[57:25] again for this the
[57:28] uh wednesday night of the week
[57:31] and we're trusting the lord tonight for
[57:34] a great outpouring of his blessings
[57:38] upon his and today i have
[57:41] been studying as usual and trying to
[57:44] think of the things that would be more
[57:46] appropriate to say
[57:48] and then how to say it and then
[57:50] depending on the lord
[57:52] to give to me the interpretation
[57:55] and meaning of this word that's written
[58:00] and i am grateful to him for what he has
[58:02] done for us through the week
[58:04] of the opening of these seals
[58:08] charging i'm taking this around history
[58:10] charging for
[58:11] i guess it's novenia i guess but
[58:13] everybody knows what
[58:14] gopher i guess that's something you have
[58:16] to do you know some penance
[58:18] somebody had to charge for that
[58:23] in questions and answers on the seals
[58:26] brother branham was asked specifically
[58:27] about his source
[58:29] and he gave the source again this proves
[58:32] brother branham was not a plagiarist
[58:35] he cited his sources as often as he
[58:37] would remember
[58:39] what they had first church ages is that
[58:43] right
[58:44] next thing a message to the church ages
[58:49] everybody get that clear down yeah i
[58:50] think first we got the church agents and
[58:53] brought the history laid down the nausea
[58:56] uh councils and pre-nazi councils and
[58:59] everything that we could find in history
[59:01] and found out that the correct
[59:03] interpretation of the word was exactly
[59:06] with the history
[59:09] question concerning the 68 million slain
[59:13] by the roman catholic church what time
[59:16] in history did this take place and
[59:20] over how long a period of time did this
[59:23] take place
[59:24] take smuckers glorious uh
[59:27] reformation i guess some of these
[59:29] scholars have that
[59:30] and it's the history of the church and i
[59:33] forget not just what page is on but it
[59:34] taken place from the time
[59:36] of the the thing was produced or
[59:39] given to the church by saint augustine
[59:43] of hippo africa that was a.d
[59:47] 354 and it lasted till 1850 the massacre
[59:51] of ireland
[59:53] again for the third time this proves the
[59:56] plagiarism
[59:57] accusation is false for those of us who
[1:00:01] see how brother branham cited
[1:00:02] history that was correct and also
[1:00:04] received divine revelation from god
[1:00:07] we can rejoice in this next quote
[1:00:09] showing how brother branham tied all the
[1:00:11] loose ends together
[1:00:12] pointing to the true interpretation of
[1:00:14] the book of revelation
[1:00:16] and gave us thus saith the lord praise
[1:00:18] the lord jesus
[1:00:21] i remember in the vision he never told
[1:00:24] me
[1:00:24] one thing in the vision when he took me
[1:00:26] up i was scared praise god to die
[1:00:28] be killed in an explosion you see they
[1:00:32] could not do it
[1:00:33] the interpretation come just as i had
[1:00:35] need of it that was in the room
[1:00:37] and i gave it out just as he give it now
[1:00:40] you see friends
[1:00:42] visions doesn't fail they're always
[1:00:45] perfect they're just exactly true now
[1:00:48] the vision
[1:00:49] plus the word plus the history plus the
[1:00:52] church ages and all
[1:00:54] blend together so i could truly say
[1:00:58] that to the best of my understanding and
[1:01:00] according to the word of god
[1:01:02] and the vision and the revelation the
[1:01:05] interpretation thereof
[1:01:06] is thus saith the lord now may the lord
[1:01:10] bless you all
[1:01:10] each one real richly
[1:01:14] for the future home sermon it seems
[1:01:16] brother branham forgot to cite larkin
[1:01:19] for the eight or more facts he used from
[1:01:21] larkin's work
[1:01:23] in fact i cannot find brother branham
[1:01:25] citing anyone
[1:01:26] during this sermon but brother branham
[1:01:29] never said
[1:01:30] larkin's work was divine revelation and
[1:01:33] most importantly
[1:01:34] his main emphasis in the sermon was the
[1:01:37] three works of grace
[1:01:39] which larkin did not teach friends
[1:01:42] brother branham said justification 16
[1:01:44] times in the sermon
[1:01:46] sanctification 12 times and the holy
[1:01:49] spirit or holy ghost
[1:01:51] 39 times this proves the emphasis was
[1:01:55] not on larkin
[1:01:56] but on the three stages the earth goes
[1:01:59] through for redemption
[1:02:00] like god's three works of grace for
[1:02:03] believers
[1:02:05] the correct teaching on the three works
[1:02:06] of grace was indeed a divine revelation
[1:02:09] from god to brother branham charles
[1:02:12] parnum
[1:02:13] was the first to teach the three works
[1:02:15] of grace but he taught it incorrectly
[1:02:18] teaching tongues was the evidence of the
[1:02:20] third work of grace
[1:02:22] but the holy ghost showed brother
[1:02:23] branham tongues are not the evidence of
[1:02:25] the holy ghost baptism
[1:02:28] instead the evidence is an emotional
[1:02:30] supernatural experience
[1:02:32] from the holy ghost and a holy life that
[1:02:35] follows
[1:02:36] bearing the fruits of the spirit and
[1:02:38] being led
[1:02:39] into all truth by the holy ghost
[1:02:42] as you carefully examine brother
[1:02:44] branham's statements in the future home
[1:02:46] you find he simply didn't cite anyone
[1:02:49] his accusers jump to conclusions
[1:02:52] and make false assumptions but they are
[1:02:54] wrong
[1:02:55] the accusers aren't treating brother
[1:02:57] branham as they'd like to be treated
[1:03:00] if brother branham's accusers made a
[1:03:02] mistake and forgot to cite someone
[1:03:04] would they want people calling them a
[1:03:06] plagiarist i doubt it
[1:03:09] in this first quote brother branham said
[1:03:10] he wrote down scriptures
[1:03:12] and notes let's listen
[1:03:16] for this great subject we we i suppose
[1:03:20] if i would take my time on this because
[1:03:23] you have to bring in many things it
[1:03:24] would take
[1:03:25] weeks but i've wrote down some
[1:03:28] scriptures
[1:03:29] some notes just to hit the highlights
[1:03:33] let you study
[1:03:36] here in the second quote brother
[1:03:37] branham's accusers blast him
[1:03:39] for claiming he got his messages by
[1:03:41] prayer but they again make many false
[1:03:44] assumptions
[1:03:46] they're either ignorant or they forget
[1:03:48] about his other quotes from the seven
[1:03:50] church ages and seven seals which
[1:03:52] balance this quote and show he would
[1:03:54] both pray
[1:03:55] and read historians waiting on the
[1:03:58] leading of the holy ghost
[1:03:59] for the correct interpretation when the
[1:04:02] spirit anointed
[1:04:04] sometimes he would wait to get a vision
[1:04:06] not always
[1:04:08] but he would always confirm his sermons
[1:04:10] by prayer and the bible
[1:04:13] let's listen to the quotes now
[1:04:17] the way i always find my messages is by
[1:04:20] prayer
[1:04:21] i'll be sitting in prayer and something
[1:04:23] reveals to me
[1:04:26] i'll wait on a few minutes and see if
[1:04:27] it's right then
[1:04:29] i feel it closer and then sometimes i
[1:04:32] keep waiting
[1:04:33] for breaks into a vision but when it
[1:04:36] begins to come
[1:04:37] and i'm satisfied it comes from god then
[1:04:40] i go to the scripture
[1:04:42] see that is called to be the
[1:04:44] confirmation of
[1:04:45] every spiritual thing that's done
[1:04:48] because the bible
[1:04:49] is the complete revelation of jesus
[1:04:53] christ
[1:04:54] it is his body
[1:04:57] and now in that maybe i find a place in
[1:05:01] the scripture that doesn't sound just
[1:05:03] right
[1:05:05] i wonder i go back again to prayer it
[1:05:07] comes again
[1:05:09] then i then i begin to examine my
[1:05:12] scripture
[1:05:15] notice brother adam never says in this
[1:05:17] quote i prayed and got all of the future
[1:05:20] home teachings from a vision
[1:05:22] his accusers misconstrue his statement
[1:05:25] and falsely interpret this quote
[1:05:27] how they want to understand it in this
[1:05:30] third quote
[1:05:30] brother branham shared what he called a
[1:05:32] deep revelation from god
[1:05:34] which was the 1500 mile measurement of
[1:05:37] the length
[1:05:38] width and height of the new jerusalem he
[1:05:40] showed it would be a pyramid
[1:05:42] and with the sea gone there would be
[1:05:44] plenty of room for this city
[1:05:46] on earth notice brother brahm never said
[1:05:49] god showed me alone this revelation
[1:05:53] of course it's true he didn't mention
[1:05:55] larkin as it seems
[1:05:57] he likely forgot to cite larkin
[1:06:00] he simply said it was a revelation from
[1:06:02] god and god gives revelation as we read
[1:06:05] other writers and historians
[1:06:08] remember that brother branham was very
[1:06:10] grateful to dr larkin
[1:06:12] for his work when he taught daniel 70
[1:06:14] weeks
[1:06:16] and it's likely brother branham got out
[1:06:18] a united states map and measured
[1:06:20] the 1500 miles from maine to florida to
[1:06:23] confirm what larkin talked
[1:06:25] he never said i got this directly from
[1:06:28] god and no man
[1:06:29] brother rams accusers are again jumping
[1:06:31] to conclusions
[1:06:33] likely due to their cognitive dissonance
[1:06:36] here's brother branham's
[1:06:45] none of these quote i'll bring the rest
[1:06:46] of this stuff along
[1:06:48] notice 2300 so now we find out
[1:06:51] that the city is measured 1500 miles
[1:06:55] square
[1:06:57] you know how far that would reach i
[1:06:59] measured it off this week
[1:07:01] it would reach from maine to florida
[1:07:05] and from the eastern seaboard to 600
[1:07:09] miles of path west of the mississippi
[1:07:14] in other words half of the united states
[1:07:17] just for the city you say there ain't no
[1:07:20] room
[1:07:21] when the sea's gone there will be
[1:07:23] because printer four fifths of us in
[1:07:26] water
[1:07:29] that right the explosion dries up the
[1:07:31] seed
[1:07:33] erupts the earth oh my
[1:07:37] remember 1500 miles square
[1:07:43] what a city i want to share another
[1:07:46] quote about the future home
[1:07:48] from harvest time december 12 1964.
[1:07:51] brother branham says the revelation of
[1:07:53] the three works of grace
[1:07:55] connected to the future home was given
[1:07:58] to him
[1:07:59] by the lord he said the lord gave it to
[1:08:01] me
[1:08:03] so i think this quote proves brother
[1:08:05] branham's emphasis
[1:08:06] was on the three works of grace during
[1:08:08] the future home series
[1:08:10] and he likely forgot to cite larkin for
[1:08:13] all the information he got from him
[1:08:15] let's listen to the
[1:08:22] believe he quote and he's baptized then
[1:08:26] he's cleansed by the blood
[1:08:27] sanctification which is wesley
[1:08:29] then he's filled with the holy ghost
[1:08:31] fire takes the
[1:08:33] world out of him and he's filled with
[1:08:34] the spirit which is the word you believe
[1:08:35] that
[1:08:36] i watch what god's going to redeem his
[1:08:38] world the same way how many got the
[1:08:40] the future home of the bride and groom
[1:08:42] was agency
[1:08:43] i wrote it out and the lord gave it to
[1:08:45] me i give it all to you as he gives it
[1:08:46] to me
[1:08:49] friends it's important to know the three
[1:08:51] works of grace
[1:08:52] was originally taught by charles parnum
[1:08:57] 1873-1928
[1:08:58] but he didn't teach it correctly he
[1:09:00] taught the third work of grace
[1:09:02] was speaking in tongues we know that was
[1:09:05] wrong and brother branham corrected that
[1:09:08] and friends clarence larkin never
[1:09:10] mentioned the gift of tongues
[1:09:12] nor three works of grace in the entire
[1:09:15] chapter of the renovation of the earth
[1:09:17] chapter 25 in his book
[1:09:20] so again we see how god used brother
[1:09:23] branham to take all the loose
[1:09:24] ends all the partial truths that were
[1:09:26] out there being taught by parnum larkin
[1:09:29] and he brought the divine interpretation
[1:09:32] of them the true revelation
[1:09:34] of many of these subjects and that's
[1:09:37] exactly what the scripture said he would
[1:09:38] do in revelation 10
[1:09:39] 7 he would finish the mystery of god
[1:09:43] remember that brother branham said the
[1:09:45] word justification 16 times in the
[1:09:47] future home sermon
[1:09:49] he said sanctification 12 times and
[1:09:52] mentioned the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:54] about 18 times in that sermon his
[1:09:56] emphasis was on the three works of grace
[1:09:59] which larkin never taught balancing the
[1:10:02] always
[1:10:03] pray to find a sermon quote
[1:10:06] as with many of brother branham's quotes
[1:10:08] you have to balance them
[1:10:10] with others we know the future home says
[1:10:13] he always got
[1:10:14] every sermon from prayer but that quote
[1:10:16] needs balance with others
[1:10:18] for example brother branham said he got
[1:10:20] 20 sermons
[1:10:21] from brother lee vale he also said he
[1:10:25] got many sermons from a minister he
[1:10:27] disagreed with
[1:10:28] about the bride going through the
[1:10:30] tribulation period
[1:10:31] let's listen to these quotes
[1:10:37] in the meetings and so forth he managed
[1:10:39] the meetings for a long time
[1:10:42] got a swell job and i'm sure this
[1:10:44] audience is always glad to hear by the
[1:10:45] day i win this today
[1:10:54] so much was said i couldn't
[1:10:58] see nothing to make it any better and i
[1:11:00] truly
[1:11:01] believe that it was the lord that worked
[1:11:04] this out for brother
[1:11:05] avails her brain amen after this morning
[1:11:09] yes you see it has to work that way we
[1:11:12] accept that from god yeah there's so
[1:11:15] many things he would say
[1:11:17] i i i have 20 sermons go down there what
[1:11:20] he said
[1:11:22] this man comes from a great a
[1:11:25] man a great teacher that's a bosom
[1:11:28] friend of mine
[1:11:30] very good man and he's a lovely brother
[1:11:34] i i'd be dares to say one word against
[1:11:37] the brother i wouldn't anyhow as
[1:11:39] a as a christian i wouldn't say nothing
[1:11:41] against him
[1:11:42] he don't agree with me on that one
[1:11:44] subject but
[1:11:46] he's my precious brother we eat together
[1:11:48] and oh he's just a damn new fellow
[1:11:51] i'll take his magazine read his articles
[1:11:53] and he writes something
[1:11:55] so forth and i'll talk a many texts out
[1:11:58] of what i i've already
[1:11:59] read his articles hear him say he's a
[1:12:02] great man
[1:12:03] but he he just can't agree with me i
[1:12:06] appreciate that
[1:12:07] if it's sincerity though you don't just
[1:12:09] want these push over you just have to
[1:12:10] grieve everything you say
[1:12:12] he's got his own convictions and he
[1:12:15] stands for i appreciate that
[1:12:16] and he's a good man of oh i am
[1:12:20] not a teacher a scholar at all but this
[1:12:22] man's full teacher and scholar
[1:12:24] but i can't agree with him because i
[1:12:26] don't see him
[1:12:30] i hope these quotes help you balance out
[1:12:32] the quote from the future home
[1:12:33] that said every sermon came by prayer we
[1:12:36] cannot take
[1:12:37] one quote and jump to a false conclusion
[1:12:40] like brother branham's accusers
[1:12:43] in closing i hope this complete teaching
[1:12:46] and this full video has been a blessing
[1:12:48] to you
[1:12:49] and i trust that you can now see brother
[1:12:51] branham was not a plagiarist
[1:12:53] he cited numerous historians on many
[1:12:56] occasions
[1:12:57] yes there were times he forgot to cite
[1:12:59] his sources
[1:13:01] but in almost every case he would come
[1:13:03] back to cite the source
[1:13:05] the future home is the only time brother
[1:13:07] branham didn't cite larkin
[1:13:09] but we can't jump to conclusions and
[1:13:11] condemn brother branham
[1:13:13] because he's not here to defend himself
[1:13:15] and because all of his previous behavior
[1:13:17] shows that he wanted to cite his sources
[1:13:20] he just didn't have the training
[1:13:22] and the scholarly understanding on how
[1:13:24] to do that
[1:13:25] my prayer is that you'll appreciate
[1:13:27] brother branham's labors more
[1:13:29] having now seen all the citations he
[1:13:31] actually gave
[1:13:33] brother branham was a true prophet of
[1:13:34] god and we're so thankful to follow his
[1:13:36] bible-based message
[1:13:38] given to him from the lord jesus christ
[1:13:42] if you have any questions concerns or
[1:13:44] testimonies about this video
[1:13:46] please contact me
[1:13:49] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[1:13:51] the desire
[1:13:52] of your heart
