[0:03] Now there may be times that I may not be
[0:05] able to set it together. I don't believe
[0:07] there's any mortal in the world can
[0:08] correctly set every word together. But
[0:11] we only can as the Holy Spirit inspires
[0:14] us to do.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matches name of
[0:18] the Lord Jesus Christ. Did God's prophet
[0:21] William Brandham set correctly [music]
[0:23] every word of the Bible in order? This
[0:26] week I was studying on how brother Bram
[0:28] loved the Bible, believed every word of
[0:30] it was thus sayith the Lord and I came
[0:31] across this beautiful and humble quote
[0:34] from 1954. God's provided way for
[0:36] healing. So according to brother Ram's
[0:39] own words, no, [music] he said he did
[0:41] not correctly set every word of the
[0:44] Bible in order and he did not believe
[0:46] any mortal [clears throat] man could. So
[0:48] this quote again exalts the
[0:50] infallibility of the holy bible the king
[0:52] James version and also exalts the lord
[0:54] Jesus [music] Christ who is the author
[0:56] of the holy bible for he is the word the
[1:00] word became flesh and the word [music]
[1:01] also gave us a written record of god's
[1:04] character which is the holy bible so by
[1:07] god's grace we'll eventually listen to
[1:08] this entire quote it's about 5 and a
[1:09] half minutes long but remember again
[1:11] friends brother Ram said he did not have
[1:13] all the answers brother Ram said this in
[1:16] questions and answers on the seals 1963
[1:18] 3. He was asked about whether or not
[1:20] Moses and Elijah have to die. And what
[1:22] about Enoch? Belam said, "I don't know.
[1:24] If I don't know, I'm just going to tell
[1:26] you I don't know. I don't know all the
[1:28] answers, folks. I don't know. And if I
[1:31] don't know, I'm going to tell you I
[1:32] don't know. And if I do know, I won't
[1:35] tell you till I do know. But I don't
[1:38] know." I've wondered about that myself.
[1:42] Now, notice there's eight times brother
[1:43] Bram says he doesn't know in this quote.
[1:46] So you can go back, count it for
[1:48] yourself, read it for yourself. But this
[1:49] shows the humility and the real
[1:51] Christian character of God's prophet,
[1:53] Brother Brandham. So I believe Brother
[1:55] Ram believed throughout his entire
[1:56] ministry that he wasn't perfect. He
[1:58] couldn't get every word correctly set in
[2:00] order and that no man could do that. But
[2:03] by the grace of God and by the gift of
[2:05] God, God would allow men, preachers,
[2:08] prophets like brother Random to
[2:10] correctly set a lot of the scripture in
[2:12] order. But brother Ram said he couldn't
[2:14] do every word as we'll soon see here
[2:16] from 1954. Now I thought about this and
[2:19] I wondered if I asked a tape boy this
[2:21] question. Was brother Brandham able as a
[2:24] mortal to set it together correctly
[2:27] every word of the Bible. I wonder what
[2:29] their answer would be. They'd probably
[2:31] shout, "Oh yes, praise the Lord. Press
[2:33] play and obey. Hallelujah. Brother Ram
[2:35] is a prophet of God. The greatest
[2:37] prophet of all time." Which is Joseph
[2:39] Brandham's words, not my words. I
[2:41] believe the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[2:43] greatest prophet of all time. Of course,
[2:45] brother Ram was a prophet of God, but
[2:46] Jesus Christ is the greatest prophet of
[2:48] all time. The God prophet. And remember
[2:51] friends, tape boys say that every word
[2:54] on tape is thus sayith the Lord. But of
[2:56] course, they don't believe that down in
[2:57] their subconscious. They know it's not
[2:59] true. They know they're deceived. They
[3:00] know they're following a lie. But I
[3:02] wonder what a tape boy would say to this
[3:04] quote here. We'll read it here. 1954,
[3:07] God's provided a way for healing.
[3:09] Brother Ram says, quote, "Now there may
[3:11] be times that I may not be able to set
[3:13] it together. I don't believe there's any
[3:16] mortal in the world can correctly set
[3:18] every word together, but we only can as
[3:20] the Holy Spirit inspires us to do." Many
[3:23] times it's contrary to our teaching. End
[3:25] quote.
[3:28] So there it is, friends. Would a tape
[3:29] boy say that's thus sayeth the Lord? If
[3:31] that's thus sayith the Lord, then
[3:33] Brother Brandon was not able to set
[3:35] every word in the Bible correctly in its
[3:37] order. And there's no mortal that could.
[3:40] And yet, if I asked them, "Was every
[3:42] word, thus sayith the Lord? Was
[3:43] everything correctly set in order by the
[3:45] tapes?" They'd probably say yes. But
[3:47] again, that shows that they're anointed
[3:49] by the deity spirit, a seducing spirit.
[3:51] And yet, Brother Ram said different than
[3:53] what a tape boy would say. Brother Ram
[3:55] was humble. He said he didn't know all
[3:56] the answers. No mortal has all the
[3:59] answers. So, we appreciate Brother Ram's
[4:01] humility and his honesty. No man can
[4:03] correctly set every word of the Bible in
[4:06] its correct order or place. But God did
[4:08] send brother Brandham to finish the
[4:10] mystery of God. As Revelation 10 1-7
[4:13] says, I wrote a book about it in 2021.
[4:16] There's 12 Bible defined mysteries. The
[4:19] Bible calls these topics mysteries such
[4:21] as the rapture, the Godhead, Israel's
[4:24] blindness, the seven church ages, the
[4:27] will of God, the baptism of the Holy
[4:29] Ghost, and more. So, brother Ram was
[4:32] able to set those correctly in their
[4:34] place in the word of God. And six out of
[4:36] those 12 we have thus sayith the Lord
[4:38] for brother Ram was able to turn the
[4:40] hearts of the children back to the
[4:42] Pentecostal fathers. According to
[4:43] Malachi 45 and 6, brother restored many
[4:47] doctrinal and Bible truths according to
[4:49] Matthew 17:11. Elijah would come and
[4:51] restore all things and of course that's
[4:53] all things that pertain to our
[4:54] salvation. I got that from Peter in
[4:56] second Peter 1:3. according as his
[4:58] divine power hath given unto us all
[5:00] things that pertain unto life and
[5:03] godliness. So notice we get all things.
[5:05] But do we know all things? No. Can we
[5:07] correctly set every single word of the
[5:09] Bible in order? The answer is no. But
[5:11] God gives us everything we need. All
[5:13] things that we need for life and
[5:15] godliness while we're living. And of
[5:17] course, brother Random was the son of
[5:19] man ministry to the Gentiles. He was a
[5:20] prophet ministry to the Gentiles with
[5:23] the prophetic gift of the Lord Jesus
[5:25] Christ. and the Lord Jesus Christ's
[5:27] anointing to discern the secrets of the
[5:30] thoughts intents of the heart which he
[5:32] demonstrated night after night, decade
[5:34] after decade. Undoubtedly, William
[5:36] Brandham was a genuine prophet of God
[5:37] and we're so thankful for that. And
[5:39] remember friends, the Bible says in
[5:41] James 3:1 and2 that there should not be
[5:43] many masters or teachers because they
[5:45] get a greater condemnation or a greater
[5:47] judgment. Romans 8:1 says there's no
[5:50] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[5:51] Jesus. But James 3:1 tells us we get a
[5:54] stricter judgment at the judgment seat
[5:56] of Christ when rewards are given out. So
[5:58] faithful teachers will be judged more
[6:00] strictly, more harshly because they
[6:02] handled the word of God. They knew the
[6:03] word of God and they communicated and
[6:05] preached the word of God to God's
[6:07] people. The Bible says in verse two
[6:09] though of James 3, that for in many
[6:10] things we offend all. If any man offend
[6:13] not in word, the same as a perfect man
[6:15] and able also to bridle the whole body.
[6:18] Brother Ram echoed this in different
[6:19] words, but they asked him in questions
[6:21] answers on the seals in 1963.
[6:24] Was it 700 or 7,000 that didn't bow the
[6:26] knee? And brother Bram said, "It just
[6:28] come to my mind while I was talking and
[6:30] I just said 700 instead of 7,000. I make
[6:33] them mistakes all the time." So here we
[6:35] see Brother Bram admitted to making
[6:37] mistakes all the time. And then he said,
[6:40] "So you forgive me. See, I didn't mean
[6:43] to do that."
[6:45] So I love the humility, the Christian
[6:47] humility of God's prophet, Brother
[6:48] Brandham. This is an example of James
[6:50] 3:1 and2. How preachers many times
[6:54] offend. They say the wrong thing on
[6:56] accident, not on purpose. Brother Brand
[6:58] said, "I make them mistakes all the
[7:00] time. For in many things we offend all.
[7:03] Thank God the Holy Ghost is given to
[7:05] every true believer to prove all things.
[7:08] Try every spirit. Rightly divide the
[7:09] word of truth." And this allows all the
[7:12] praise, all the infallibility, all the
[7:14] glory to go to Jesus Christ our Lord.
[7:17] Let's examine this quote here from 1954
[7:20] just to better understand the context.
[7:22] So beginning in paragraph 5, brother
[7:24] talks about he wants to see the church
[7:26] set in order. He talks about his
[7:27] Pentecostal experience and then he goes
[7:30] into the difference between Catholicism
[7:32] and Protestantism.
[7:34] The Catholics say God is in his church,
[7:36] but Protestants say God is in his word.
[7:38] Brother Ram said he talked to a priest a
[7:40] few days before this in July 1954. And
[7:45] this priest told Brother Brandham, "What
[7:47] the Bible says is all right, but if the
[7:49] church says contrary, then the church is
[7:51] right." Because Peter was the pope.
[7:52] Brother Brham said, "Of course, it's all
[7:54] right. Every fellow to his own belief,
[7:56] but I believe that whatever God has
[7:58] said, God's word does not alter. God's
[8:00] word does not change."
[8:02] And then he quotes Galatians 1:8. If an
[8:04] angel would come and teach anything
[8:06] other than what Paul had already
[8:08] preached, let him be accursed. Brother
[8:10] Ram said, "So I am a fundamental
[8:12] believer in the Bible, what the Bible
[8:14] says. I believe it and I believe it's
[8:16] the truth and ready to hang my soul in
[8:18] any phase of the Bible. Any sentence,
[8:20] comma, whatever it might be, that's
[8:23] God's word is everlasting truth. It's
[8:25] inspired and written and we stay with
[8:27] it." And then he showed how there was
[8:29] three ways to get a message in the Old
[8:31] Testament. by a prophet, by a dreamer or
[8:33] by the law. Then he spoke about the
[8:36] yurum thumbum and how the Holy Ghost
[8:38] would flash if something was true. And
[8:41] brother Brandham said the word of God is
[8:43] our yurum thumbum today. He said if any
[8:45] teaching is contrary to this Bible, it's
[8:48] wrong. Let him be accursed, but it must
[8:50] be built solidly upon the word as thus
[8:52] sayeth the Lord. And if this word is
[8:54] correctly set in order, taught by the
[8:56] minister, God solemnly under obligation
[8:59] to his son to answer that word and
[9:00] fulfill it. Now, that's the way I
[9:02] believe it. I believe every word of it,
[9:04] brother believed every word of the
[9:05] Bible. The Bible's infallible. The
[9:07] Bible's the absolute, not the tapes.
[9:10] Then we get to the quote that struck me.
[9:12] Now, there may be times that I may not
[9:15] be able to set it together. I don't
[9:16] believe there's any mortal in the world
[9:18] can correctly set every word together,
[9:20] but we only can as the Holy Spirit
[9:22] inspires us to do. Many times it's
[9:24] contrary to our teaching. Brother Rand
[9:26] talks about how some people blasphe the
[9:28] Holy Ghost when they left his meetings.
[9:30] And then he said he's here for one
[9:32] purpose to instruct for healing services
[9:34] tonight. So let's take a moment listen
[9:36] to all five and a half minutes of that
[9:38] quote by the grace of God.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; And so in these things, all these great
[9:44] things to see the church set together.
[9:47] When I first seen the Pentecostal people
[9:49] and heard them speak with tongues,
[9:52] I've been taught as a Baptist that that
[9:53] was of the devil. So I thought now look
[9:56] at here and uh I thought well the one
[10:00] thing I don't care what the church says
[10:02] the Bible said they shall speak with new
[10:04] tongues.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; First thing I had to either take the
[10:08] church or take the Bible. I said what am
[10:10] I going to do? He said let every man's
[10:12] word be a lie where it's bishop
[10:14] archbishop or whoever he is and my word
[10:17] be the truth.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; And that's the vast difference between
[10:20] Catholicism and Protestantism. See,
[10:23] Catholicism, you can't argue with the
[10:25] Catholic on the Bible. Because after
[10:27] all, if the church says something
[10:29] contrary to the Bible, it's the church.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; They say God is in his church. The
[10:34] Protestant says God is in his word. See,
[10:37] now there's the difference. So, you
[10:38] can't argue because if the church says a
[10:40] certain thing, ask them where they get
[10:42] not eaten meat on Friday and all these
[10:44] other things. They Well, they say the
[10:45] church said so. And a few days ago, I
[10:47] have an interview with a priest. The
[10:49] priest said, I was asking some questions
[10:51] as my people before me were Catholic.
[10:54] And I said, uh, I want to ask you some
[10:56] questions scripturally. And um, uh, he
[11:00] said, just a minute, Mr. Brandon. He
[11:03] said, see, we Catholics go to church and
[11:06] worship. You Protestants stay home and
[11:09] read the Bible, but we go to church and
[11:11] worship. I said, but what?
[11:14] That's an exam.
[11:16] What?
[11:18] Now he said, "See, we don't notice what
[11:21] what the Bible says is all right. But if
[11:23] the church says contrary, then the
[11:25] church is right because Peter was the
[11:28] pope and the pope succeeds Peter and
[11:30] whatever the church has set together,
[11:33] that is the order. That's what it goes.
[11:35] God still moved." Well, I said, "Of
[11:38] course, it's all right. Every fellow,
[11:40] that's what makes us America. every
[11:42] fellow to his own belief. But I believe
[11:44] that whatever God has said, God's word
[11:46] does not alter. God's word does not
[11:48] change. One jot or tit will in no wise
[11:52] pass from it till every bit of it
[11:54] fulfilled. And I believe that Paul said,
[11:56] "If an angel from heaven would come and
[12:00] teach any other thing than what you had
[12:02] already been taught in this scripture,
[12:04] let him be unto you a cursed." Galatians
[12:06] 1:8. So, I am a fundamental believer in
[12:10] the Bible. What the Bible says, I
[12:13] believe it. And I believe it's the truth
[12:15] and ready to hang my soul on any phase
[12:18] of the Bible or any any sentence, comma,
[12:21] whatever it might be that God's word is
[12:24] everlasting true. It's inspired and
[12:26] written and we stay with it. In the Old
[12:28] Testament, there was three ways that
[12:30] they could get a message. that was by a
[12:32] prophet,
[12:34] by a dreamer, or by the law.
[12:38] And now if a prophet prophesied and on
[12:42] the breast of Aaron, Aaron was a Yurmma
[12:45] thundum. And if the lights flashed on
[12:48] the Yurmma thundum, that prophet was
[12:50] telling the truth. But the lights didn't
[12:52] flash on that Yurmmaundum, then it was
[12:55] wrong. If a dreamer dreamed a dream and
[12:58] told that dream and and it didn't flash
[13:00] on the yarmmathundum, it was wrong. The
[13:03] prophet, if he prophesied and the lights
[13:05] didn't flash, he was wrong. And the
[13:07] yermma thundum from that priesthood was
[13:09] taken away. But here is the yermmaundum
[13:12] of the priesthood today.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; The word of God, if a dreamer or a
[13:16] prophet or a preacher or anything
[13:18] teaches contrary to this Bible, it's
[13:21] wrong.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Let him be accursed. But it must be
[13:24] built solidly upon this word as thus
[13:28] sayaeth the Lord. And if this word is
[13:30] correctly set in order and taught by the
[13:33] minister, God's solemnly under
[13:37] obligation to his son to answer that
[13:40] word and fulfill it. Now, that's the way
[13:42] I believe the Bible. I believe every
[13:44] word of it. Now, there may be times that
[13:46] I may not be able to set it together. I
[13:49] don't believe as any mortal in the world
[13:50] can correctly set every word together,
[13:53] but we only can as the Holy Spirit
[13:56] inspires us to do. Many times it's
[13:58] contrary to her teaching. My wife
[14:00] happened to be standing outside last
[14:02] night just soon as the she said two or
[14:04] three passed the platform said a group
[14:06] of people got up and walked out said one
[14:09] of them looked over the other and said,
[14:10] "What do you think about?" I said, "All
[14:11] punk. There's nothing to that." And um
[14:14] another one walked out in a few minutes
[14:16] said, "Well, it was a pretty good show,
[14:18] wasn't it? Not to have to pay to get
[14:20] in." And that's the opinion of the
[14:24] starchy people of this world.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; See, that's their opinion. It's always
[14:31] been their opinion. It was their
[14:33] opinion. Their fathers had the same
[14:35] opinion and is in hell today.
[14:38] That's right. And remember what if this
[14:41] would have been the truth they was
[14:42] listening at last night. Then they have
[14:45] blasphemed the Holy Ghost which is never
[14:47] forgiveness in this world or the world
[14:49] to come. Is that right?
[14:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's best to keep still if
[14:53] you're not sure. So the Lord bless you.
[14:56] Now this afternoon as we've gathered
[14:59] here for one purpose that's to instruct
[15:02] for healing services tonight.
[15:05] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[15:08] a blessing by the grace of God. Again,
[15:09] it's so refreshing to see Brother Ram's
[15:11] love for the Bible, his understanding
[15:13] that every word of the Bible, any phase
[15:15] of it or any phrase of it, any quote of
[15:18] the Bible is thus sayeth the Lord. It is
[15:21] the everlasting word of God. As brother
[15:22] M said, so beautiful. Brother Ram's love
[15:24] for the Bible was apparent through his
[15:26] life, through the fruits of his life,
[15:28] the genuine Holy Ghost fruits of his
[15:29] life and ministry. We're so thankful for
[15:31] a true prophet of God, Brother William
[15:33] Marin Brandham. Let us continue to
[15:35] rightly divide the word of truth and do
[15:37] our best to rightly divide the word of
[15:39] truth. As brother Ram said, "No mortal
[15:41] man can set every single word in the
[15:43] Bible correctly together." How I wish I
[15:45] could. How any true man of God wishes he
[15:47] could, but we must do our best with it
[15:49] by the grace of God. receive the
[15:51] inspiration of the Holy Ghost to preach
[15:53] our sermons week after week, month after
[15:55] month, year after year, decade after
[15:56] decade, to strengthen the bride of
[15:58] Christ, to edify the bride of Christ, to
[16:00] feed the bride of Christ as the bride of
[16:02] Christ prepares for the going away.
[16:04] Let's keep feeding on the word of God.
[16:06] The Lord Jesus Christ is here to reveal
[16:08] his word to us, help us rightly divide
[16:10] it, help us correctly set it in order,
[16:13] the best that a mortal man could. It
[16:15] won't be perfect, but Jesus Christ is
[16:18] here to do that. He said he'd bring all
[16:20] things to our remembrance. The Holy
[16:22] Ghost told us to preach the word. Be
[16:24] instant in season and out of season. The
[16:26] Holy Ghost said fight the good fight of
[16:28] faith. The Holy Ghost said he would work
[16:30] with the preachers when they went forth
[16:32] and preached everywhere according to
[16:34] Mark 16:20. And the Holy Ghost would
[16:37] confirm the word with signs following.
[16:40] Amen.
[16:42] If you have any questions, concerns, or
[16:43] testimonies about this video, please
[16:44] contact me.
[16:47] God [music] bless you and may Jesus
[16:49] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[16:55] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[16:57] Christ [music] to bring the good
[17:00] tidings, the good news that Jesus raised
[17:02] from the dead, living among man today,
[17:04] his church. The same Jesus that was
[17:07] yesterday will be today and forever.
[17:11] He's never failed.
