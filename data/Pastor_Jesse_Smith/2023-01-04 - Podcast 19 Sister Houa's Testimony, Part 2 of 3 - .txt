TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your co-host Pastor Jesse Smith and here's our other co-host and I'm Eamon Lee we're grateful again to be having this podcast and we get to enjoy part two of our sister who has testimony we surely enjoyed part one and we're so thankful the Lord put those different testimonies on her heart and I know just like with all the other testimonies that the Lord will direct this testimony to the people that need to hear it so I'm very confident of that and I'm thankful for our sister's courage to share what God has done and thankful for the Holy Spirit to bring all these things to our sisters remembrance so we have a list of about eight or more testimonies and we'll kind of watch the time and see how much time it takes to record all these but we're grateful for all these eight testimonies and maybe we'll think of more as we're going on recording and we'll just hear how the Holy Spirit brings remembrance to our sister of how God gave her these testimonies foreign testimony that me and my wife had and she's gonna go into it but this is a time when we first came to the message and God spoke to her so when I first came into the message I believe it was the first three services when I attended on Sunday in the car when I was on the way to church Sunday morning I had earrings in my ears and I was at a stoplight and I Heard a Voice speak to me and it told me to take out my earrings at first I thought I was going I thought I was crazy to be hearing stuff but it repeated it The Voice spoke again and it told me to take out my earrings and so I did that I took out my earrings and when I came to church for service my pastor ended up preaching about Isaac and Rebecca and he preached about earrings and that he said only slaves were pierced to their ears and it was to identify them as a slave and that's when I knew that that was God telling me take out your earrings so you can hear the word wow sister praise God yeah I now remember that testimony from many years ago I don't remember preaching on earrings but I remember you giving that testimony so praise God and you're exactly right the scripture says a slave in the Old Testament was before an indentured servant and they were still allowed to go free but if they wanted to stay a servant for their lifetime and basically move into that permanent slavery mode permanent servant mode then the Bible said they would take them down and put an all in their ear and brother bran used that as a type to show in the New Testament if you won't take your freedom if you won't take the Liberty the Holy Ghost then your ear gets marked in other words your spiritual ability to hear the word of God is taken away and you become a slave to the denominational system the mother Harlot system and of course the mother Harlot has daughters which we know are the Protestant churches who hold the false doctrine of the mother Harlot the Roman Catholic Church I think there was 15 times the Bible said earrings were mentioned and the majority of them were negative cases in the Bible where the earrings became idols and the earrings were signs of heathens and so the voice you heard was a very scriptural voice no doubt it was the voice of the Holy Spirit praise God one thing that's unique about you Sisterhood is that you hear the voice of God sometimes which is wonderful I myself I've been a Christian 22 years I've never heard God's voice like that I just feel convicted in my heart like the Bible said it entered into Moses heart to do the will of God and that's kind of feel how God speaks to me but I just want to tell you that's a wonderful part of your testimony that when you hear the voice it's a scriptural voice and that's how we know it's the right voice because like in this case It'll point you the scriptures oh yeah I can see cutting the bodies wrong making yourself bleed is wrong we're New Testament Believers We're Not to cause ourselves to bleed the Bible says be be modest of course earrings you know can be expensive and lavish fish and they draw attention to the person and it's more humble to not wear earrings so everything in the New Testament points to no earrings so I just want to say that's a wonderful part about your testimony how you at times get to hear the voice of God and what a privilege that is to you and what an expression of God's love to you as well sister and our testimony close to hearing from the voice of God was with while driving her car and she got into a car accident and still testify on what happened after that so apparently I I forgot what day it was but it was early in the morning and I figured I was going to go grab some coffee before work and it was during the month of December and I was driving and I got into the Christmas spirit and I thought it was okay to listen to Christmas music and so I'm driving and I'm listening to it and I thought I was at a turning lane and I thought it was okay for me to turn because I didn't see cars coming from the opposite end so I turned and right when I turned from the corner of my eyes I saw a car coming right at my vehicle and so it crashed right into the back of my vehicle on the side it was the right back near the trunk and I just got new tires too and the tires were flat and blown up and everything but I was very grateful that I actually survived that car accident because my car was totaled so right before I got into the car accident a voice spoke to me and it told me to turn off the music and like I I don't know what got into me but I was just so into the Christmas music that I ignored at the voice and it came again it spoke again a lot stronger and it's told me to turn off the Christmas music and since I didn't listen to them right then when I turned that's when I got into a car accident and that's when like you know I I can say that like I woke up from what I was doing like oh like maybe I should like I should have listened to the voice so you know I felt really really guilty and bad about not doing it and out of that my car got totaled and I didn't have a vehicle to drive for like the next week or so but out of it all you know I I repented right after I got home and I repented and I cried out to the Lord to forgive me for not listening to his voice in the first place then out of that a blessing came out of it too you know I I received some money for my insurance for the vehicle and I was able to use that money to purchase my next vehicle which I have right now yeah I appreciate you sharing that that's a very personal testimony but you hear God's voice again it testifies of how God he's patient and he uh like he's patient with all of us and he's teaching us to obey his voice and so that's a beautiful testimony of God speaking to you multiple times and you know and now God is teaching you to hear his voice I mean I'm sure all of us can relate to that you know getting in the Christmas spirit you know sometimes we go out in the restaurants and they have these songs on that don't seem that they don't seem too awful like uh like a death metal band or something like that you know they don't seem awful they just seem oh this is kind of nice and it's the holiday season and and so I'm sure we've all experienced that but again it just shows the level of um dedication the Lord wants us to have you know to be faithful in season out of season praise God we'll move to our third testimony uh when our sister who received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I recall that service and so we'll let our sister kind of tell the the background behind that and maybe the week leading up to that I think there was some testimony in that and then we can kind of talk more about the details and what a wonderful testimony that is to the glory of God so after my husband received the Holy Ghost he was expressing so much of God's love to me and he was talking so wondrously about what it feels like to have the Holy Ghost and he he constantly keep asking me so when are you going to receive it when are you going to get it and so I I'm like okay you know let me let me pray about it you know and see and um it got to the point where he said you should receive the Holy Ghost and he said maybe you should clean out your um closet and and things that you know isn't golly because at that time and I'm ashamed to say it now but at that time I was still wearing pants and the only time I wore pants was I wore pants to work because I worked in the medical field so that was the only time and and my husband told me you know you should get rid of all your pants and then concentrate your yourself unto God to receive the Holy Ghost and so I took his offer and I got rid of all my pants and then within that week you know he's like oh and also I listened to brother branham's sermon the eagle that's the Earth its nest I listened to that sermon as well and so throughout that week I I consecrated My Flesh and all I did was I I just focused I just had all my focus on God and you know prayed and seek and then that following Sunday came I just want to add a few things before Sunday happened um that week that happened I was listening to a lot of people talking about the Rapture and how God sold of the Rapture was going to happen and I got all caught up into and I really thought the Rapture was literally going to happen like very soon and then there was this false doctrine that I I thought that was real was What's called the three days of darkness I remember watching that and they said some scary stuff on there and it spooked me out and it was like in the middle of the night and I got so confident I'm like I woke up and I shook my wife up and she was like why'd you wake me up I'm like honey you have to listen to this this is very scary because it's talking about demons coming out and you have to act candles and everything and it's gonna be Darkness over the whole world and I got really nervous and scared and then that's when I that's when uh I was telling her you need to get the Holy Ghost because you can be left behind if you don't make if you don't um get the Holy Ghost or else you know all this is gonna happen and I remember at night time we went and we prayed and we felt the presence of God as I laid my hand upon her back and uh we prayed that night and we thought she would receive it but then she didn't but um that following night I remember cool told me in the following morning that I woke up drenched in sweat and she said she felt uh a huge blanket wrapped around me like a holy presence do you remember that and and that when she felt that I was having a dream that I was talking to Pastor Jessie about this and I that following day I called off work and meanwho went to go see Pastor Jesse to go talk about this and to like we we went and we talked about this to see what what the deal was with this three days of darkness because it spooked me out yeah it did I believe it did spook up cool a bit and that's when she decided to like get rid of all of her pants and dedicure her life to the Lord yes and then from there throughout that week that's when you know I got rid of all my pants and I consecrated My Flesh to bring it under subjection to God's word and that week I I just focused on God you know I turn on a sermon listen to music and I just thought of the Lord and I did go up for prayer for the Holy Ghost and since I didn't receive it then it was after service when I was gathered with three other Saints and we knelt down and prayed for the Holy Ghost and it was then that I received it yeah I remember that moment I remember Lydia come knocking on my door after the service and she's like Daddy can you pray for me for the Holy Ghost I'm like absolutely so he came out here and then I saw you and brother amen praying I just had this thought I thought why don't we kneel down and just bow you know humble ourselves before the Lord and just bow down and pray and I think I was holding your hand I think you were holding your wife's hand and you know Lydia was on the left side of me and just I just remember when we first started praying it was so sincere and I heard sister who I just start he just it just went up every time she'd she'd speak it went a little louder a little louder a little louder like I could tell the Holy Ghost is going to fall here it was a beautiful moment like those are those are special Eternal moments right and uh we're just praying and as you worship as we're all praying your worship just got increasingly louder louder and then you had a long scream and a PR and a praise uh and a shouting hallelujah we're all weeping and crying and you just gave God the glory for a number of minutes there and I just I just knew I said the Holy Ghost fell praise God God moved Upon Our Sister and I was just so blessed I know we've been praying for that I know amen and I had been praying for that you've been praying for that and so it was just so wonderful to see God uh back up his word you know he said repent be baptized and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost so I was elated I was rejoicing for you and what God had done for you so the day when I received the Holy Ghost I was I was rejoicing and right when I walked out of church and I sat in my car I got attacked like I was told that I didn't have it I didn't have the Holy Ghost and you know as as a newborn holy ghostful person I didn't know what to expect you know from it but it that that voice just kept telling me Oh you didn't you don't have the Holy Ghost oh no no you don't have it and I remember telling this to my husband and I'm like like what like that that can't be God and so my husband prayed for me and then we went home and I was okay and during the night that voice woke me up at four four o'clock in the morning and it just it it just didn't leave me alone it just kept saying you don't have it you don't you don't have it and it was it pushed me to the point where I almost thought that I didn't have it but I'm like no that's that's not true I I do have it I just don't know why I'm hearing this voice telling me that I don't have it and it just kept telling me you don't have it you don't have it you you don't have it you'll never have it you don't have it and so it kept me up for like almost an hour to the point where it exhausted me and so I woke my husband up and I I told him and that's when he prayed for me and that that that evil spirit left me I was able to fall back asleep but then I knew I had to get up because I had to get up for work so laughs so technically I lost like two hours of sleep over fighting yes I I had moments where that that voice would come back and tell me oh you don't have it you don't have the Holy Ghost and sometimes it'll put me in doubt but when I pray and I ask God to to give me some kind of revelation of some sort to to just validate that I do have it you know God has always done so and I just had one recently just a couple of I think it was just a few weeks ago and I'm like I've been praying about it and I'm like Lord give me a revelation of Jesus Christ or or have my husband tell me that I have the Holy Ghost you know just just as validation and I remember praying this Wednesday and right when I came to a Wednesday service it was when my pastor was preaching I forgot what the sermon was called but he he started talking about the revelation of Jesus Christ and so I'm like all right there's my confirmation my validation is right there and so all the doubt left and I feel good now that's a great testimony of overcoming the accuser right Satan's the accuser of the Brethren oh you don't have it you don't have it he's accusing you um reminds me of Jesus after he got the Holy Ghost where'd the spirit take him right out into the Wilderness to be tempted so just your your case fits that perfectly you get the Holy Ghost and right when you get out of the car you start getting tempted and I and I like how you discern the voice because this is not the voice of God because it said you'll never get the Holy Ghost yet God promised you would God said if you repent and get baptized you shall receive the Holy Ghost so how can that voice say you'll never get it that God would never say that right God would say yes child you can you know yes child you have um so again wonderful how God gives you Grace to hear his voice and then discern the wrong voices well that's a beautiful testimony and then the Bible says fear hath torment so that voice coming back tormenting you waking you up at different times that's not the voice of God you know that's that's the spirit of fear the spirit of Doubt uh trying to bring torment to you and I like how brother amen prayed and the devil left that's like a it's a casting out of a spirit you know casting down imaginations that exalted themselves against the word of God so one full testimony there and I'll just say this this one thing I've seen about your marriage you two is that you always support each other you know you always pray for another you know it seems like if if one if one of your struggling the other one comes around and helps you out I mean that is so beautiful that is exactly what a marriage is supposed to be praise God I literally when I'm down my wife picks me up and when my wife needs a pickup I can pick her up by God's grace you know it's such a beautiful thing about your marriage so I just want to encourage you with that as well by God's grace praise God here's a fourth testimony where our sister experienced a supernatural touch from the Holy Spirit during an evening service on a Sunday night and the Holy Spirit brought healing so it was after second service I believe I wasn't feeling good that day and I was really really exhausted and tired and I remember it was at the end of the service and we were standing up and I believe we were we were praying and when I closed my eyes I felt like I was going to just fall over so I sat down and right after service when it ended my eyes were still closed and I was just praying and I was I was in the position of praying and I I was praying that knowing that God was going to just move and just heal me and I just felt like whatever whatever was on me got pulled right off of me like it was just yanked right off and after I opened my eyes I felt so much better like like it was a miracle of me just sitting there just praying and asking for deliverance and I got delivered like right there in my chair oh and like the wind came by the wind came by like I felt like a brush of wind Flow by me and like that's when it got ripped right off of me like whatever it was that was on you it just I'm not too sure how to like say it like like it was just pulled right off of me and I I got he delivered like right there in my chair and then I remember I I told my husband about it yeah I remember that service it was again a really uh anointed service but the cam was preaching for us on a Sunday night and I think we were always kind of tired that night and it was in the it was in the winter time and different ones of us were battling sickness and then from what I remember from that time sister I think you had said like you felt the spirit of God kind of come through the wall at least that's how I remembered it and I've told it that testimony and it's just like Acts chapter two uh they're all one Accord and the Holy Spirit came in like a rushy Mighty Wind praise God and as then the wind of God struck you and like you said that that sickness would just instantly pulled away just instant Deliverance praise God and we've had that wind at least another time in our in our service we've had the wind of the Holy Spirit when um three or four of the children got the Holy Ghost back in I believe it was June of 2020 if I'm not mistaken my niece testified of feeling the wind of the Holy Spirit strike her one of my daughters felt the wind of the Holy Spirit as well so three or four people received the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it's just awesome to see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he still speaks his voice he still sends his Holy Spirit and he can instantly deliver at any time and of course it's all dependent upon God's will also like how you felt like you knew you were going to be healed well that's Revelation or that's a gift of faith perhaps God revealed to you somehow you had this faith that I'm going to be healed and God's going to heal me and there was no doubt and God just came and did it what a wonderful testimony God heard your prayer God knew you were weak and tired or whatever the situation was and God brought Deliverance right after you sat and heard the word and praised him you gave God your all you did all you could do and God did the rest by God's grace foreign we had our guest Preacher Brother Cadre Dix come and he was preaching and he was hearing a story about someone at church who wanted to repent but they didn't want to so she said in a prayer wow brother Kaji was preaching that if brother codrick grabs her hand then she'll go up and repent and during that service she left their hand up to pray and brother Cadre went and he slapped her hand like a high five and she ran up repenting that that day and that stirred me up so I went after prayer um after service and I went and I prayed and arrows outside like outside fellowshipping and I was praying to God I'm like God I want the same experience that woman had and I pray that someone would touch me and for some reason I felt someone touched my back and it was my wife and I don't know what happened there but I felt the Holy Spirit come upon me while she touched my back and that she heard I don't know if you heard the voice to God or whatever led her to do that but do that I see about like I don't know how to say it I felt the anointing when she placed her hand up on my back and God answered that prayer yeah it was after uh service and uh my husband was praying at the altar I was praying on my chair and I suddenly stopped and I believe it was the Holy Ghost it made me turn around to look at my husband and it led me to put my hands on him and I didn't know why I didn't even know what my husband was praying for and so I laid I put my hand on my husband's back and I started praying for him and after he got done praying and he he's he told me he's like wow I was just asking that God about that to how someone's hand be put on you know on my back or their hands to just be laid on my back to to know that you know God was with him and I didn't know that I just went with whatever the Holy Ghost led me to do that's a wonderful testimony you know when brother Diggs comes we always have really good good services and I think the last time he was here he basically preached like the next part in my Joshua series and didn't even know I was preaching on Joshua uh so just to discernment of spirit was really good uh time in the Lord yeah that's a great example sister again you know how they that are the sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God you know so the Holy Ghost LED you to go pray for brother amen and that doesn't happen every service right you know that's not something that's a normal thing to do you go lay hands on your husband and pray like I can't remember last time I laid my hands on my wife to pray um so God LED you to do that so God would show brother amen that he'd heard his request praise God and then God answered his individual prayer that he had on his heart as well so again awesome to see the spirit of God working between you two and uh you know God answering your prayers kind of reminds me also Gideon how Gideon put a fleece before the Lord Lord I just need this I just need a little touch and God gave that to Gideon reminds me of I went to Pennsylvania one time and it was actually brother Matt Leitner who we saw last weekend and he said I was preaching and then I think I was preaching the message of God be with us where be all the Miracles from Gideon and brother Matt said Lord I know you're going to hear Heal Me of these allergies but can you just give me a sign and so I prayed that for him at the altar he went back to his seat and he said as he was worshiping all his Sinus and Congestion just vanished instantly it's like it it was lifted like it was kind of like an evaporation type of feeling and so he come back up and testified in front of everybody that God gave him the sign that he desired now when he comes next time we've got to ask him if he's done with allergies Yeah by God's grace but God gave him a sign there that was years ago just like you desire to sign brother amen and then God used you to be that other one that person on the other end who is led by the spirit to answer the prayer request foreign we're gonna have a third part and hope you'll be blessed by this podcast that we did today Amen brother I've been so blessed by these testimonies all five have been wonderful examples of our sister following the leadership of the Holy Ghost standing on the word of God overcoming the wicked one by the word of God and her testimony so we thank God for these five testimonies and Lord willing we'll have a part three and we'll get to hear the rest of her testimonies that glorify the Lord Jesus Christ we're so thankful for this bible-based message we've received through God's Prophet brother Branham and just as brother Rams said the Holy Ghost always points us to the word of God God bless you friends as the Holy Ghost anoints you to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ as Paul also said in Philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel very happy to be here this afternoon and again it is defense of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good news that Jesus [Music]
