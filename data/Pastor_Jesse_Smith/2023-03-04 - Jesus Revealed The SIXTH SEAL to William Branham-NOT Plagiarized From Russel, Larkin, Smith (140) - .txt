TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] this six seal is the Tribulation period that's what takes place the bride has gone I think [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove that brother Branham did not plagiarize Clarence Larkin Charles Tays Russell nor Uriah Smith on The Sixth Seal [Music] from the outset let me state that this Sixth Seal is the seal that is most similar of all the seals between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin I found four differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin on The Sixth Seal and I estimate that brother Branham likely used at least six of Larkin's teachings on The Sixth Seal which this video will cover and I believe brother Bram likely forgot to reference Clarence Larkin on these six uses just like I think brother Brandon forgot to reference him on his uses regarding the future home but it should be noted that brother Branham referenced Larkin on Daniel's 70th week in 1961 and then he did State he read Larkin's work on the Seven Seals a year after he preached the seals in 1964. I'm very grateful to Dr Larkin of his views I'm grateful to all these great Scholars for the reviews on this and in reading them it enlightens me much that I can find places that looks right then just leaving it at that and pursuing after a while we preach on the seals not knowing what the seals was and I read Mr Larkin I'd read all so many different ones of their commentaries on this but before getting into the details of The Sixth Seal I just want to remind our viewers that on the first five seals there were 29 differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin and Charles Taze Russell proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that brother Brown did not plagiarize Clarence Larkin and Charles Tay's Russell on the first five seals and friends here's a visual of how I calculated the 29 differences between brother Branham Clarence Larkin and Charles Taze Russell on the first five seals so in the first seal brother Brown's accuser only compared brother Branham and Charles Russell and yet they had six differences brother Ram's accuser didn't even compare brother Branham with Clarence Larkin or Uriah Smith on the first seal on the second seal brother Ram's accusers accused brother Branham of plagiarizing Charles Taze Russell yet again there were six differences on the third seal again brother Ram's accuser used Charles Tays Russell but there were seven differences on the third seal between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell on the fourth seal there were seven differences again between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell then finally on the fifth seal brother Ram's accuser said brother Brandon plagiarized Larkin but there were three differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin on the fifth seal and brother Ram's accuser didn't mention Charles stage Russell know Uriah Smith on the fifth seal so adding up six and six is twelve twelve plus seven is nineteen nineteen plus seven is 26 26 plus 3 is 29. there's 29 differences on the first five seals between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell and Clarence Larkin but there are more differences on the first five seals between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin and Uriah Smith and also Charles Tays Russell which brother Ram's accuser ignored regarding the Sixth Seal brother Ram's accuser compared brother Branham and Clarence Larkin and yet I found four differences between brother Branham and Larkin so 29 differences plus four more equals 33 so now there's 33 differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin and Charles Tays Russell on the first six seals and again I'm not counting the other two ministers that brother Ram's accuser left out on all six seals so the total number of differences would be much larger probably 40 50 or even 60. first let's look at the accusation one of Brothers accusers made a video about The Sixth Seal and he called the theft of The Sixth Seal at the 330 Mark he said quote what is painfully obvious is that William Raynham took his sermon on The Sixth Seal directly from Larkin's book he gave Larkin no credit but rather said that he got his Revelation directly from God William Branham did not mention either men as the source of his Revelation this is what is referred to as plagiarism in every instance William Branham stated that his Revelation was Supernatural and came directly from God end quote so here's a few of my initial reactions first I do believe brother Branham used at least six of Larkin's teachings on The Sixth Seal including nearly two complete pages about Jesus's Olivet discourse in Matthew chapter 24. but the four differences brother Branham had with Larkin on The Sixth Seal are substantial as you'll soon see second it's true brother Branham did not give Larkin Credit in The Sixth Seal sermon but I think he likely forgot a year later though in 1964 brother Branham said he had read Larkin's work on the Seven Seals brother Ram said he read Larkin's work on the seals and other authors so this is where I get the understanding that brother Branham likely forgot to mention that he used Larkin's work on the Sixth Seal let's listen to the quote So based upon brother Brown's past Integrity of referring to historians I believe brother Ram most likely forgot to mention that he used Larkin's work during this Sixth Seal sermon for example during the church ages sermon I have a video about it a brother Branham referenced historians over 20 times some by name some by book title and others just by the word historian brother brand was quick to reference historians he was happy to reference historian so brother random was not a plagiarist also remember brother random mentioned Samuel Schmucker in the seals and Uriah Smith among other books that he read regarding the Seven Seals brother Branham had a pattern of recognizing historians and preachers for their ideas that he used of course he wasn't perfect and I don't believe there is a preacher that is perfect on always recognizing where he gets his thoughts and information from but just like in the future Home Series it seems brother Brandon forgot to reference Larkin during this Sixth Seal sermon so I believe it's unfair to say brother bran was a plagiarist based upon his outstanding Christian character his humble Christian Spirit he probably just forgot to reference Clarence Larkin on The Sixth Seal next brother Ram's accuser said brother random said he got his Revelation directly from God I believe this was a true statement from Brother Branham because as you'll see the four differences between brother Branham and Larkin are substantial additionally brother Branham gave us very few details about what the Revelation from God entailed on the Sixth Seal brother Branham could have meant that the Holy Ghost directed him to Larkin's work on the Sixth Seal for at least six of the details brother Branham used from Larkin's work and if God did direct brother Ram to Clarence Larkin's work on the Sixth Seal that would be the same as God directing brother Branham to Samuel schmucker's work on the second seal to prove the Roman Catholic Church's guilt in slaughtering over 68 million Protestants and also would be the same as God directing brother Branham to the right historical references he needed to preach the revelation of the seven Church ages in 1960. so the fact that brother Branham used some of Larkin's work on the Sixth Seal only backs up what brother Ram's Ministry was prophesied to do according to the scripture program's Ministry was to finish the mystery of God and the revelation of the mystery was already in the scripture God was slowly restoring the truth that was lost during the church ages such as justification through Martin Luther sanctification through John Wesley the gifts of the Spirit through William Seymour and brother Ryan was gathering up all these Loose Ends putting them together in the right scriptural order with sound Doctrine from the scripture and he tied all the loose ends together as he said in this quote on the first seal let's listen to the quote [Music] receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God [Applause] also let me say that this is the first time that Larkin got a seal right but only partially so Larkin's percentage on correctly interpreting the seals thus far is less than 16 percent because one out of six is 16 percent but Larkin wasn't completely right on the Sixth Seal as we'll soon see and recall that all of Larkin's seals happened during the 70th week of Daniel or the seven year tribulation period so that means the first five seals between brother Branham and Larkin were extremely different for example Larkin said the oil and wine of the third seal were literal oil and wine that Believers would survive upon during a war during the Great Tribulation period this is completely different from Brother Branham brother random said the oil and wine represented the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the stimulation of Revelation from the Holy Ghost during the Dark Ages so now let's compare brother Branham and Clarence Larkin on The Sixth Seal here's the four differences between Larkin and brother Branham on The Sixth Seal the first difference is that Larkin said the six seal is one small event in the first three and a half years of the Great Tribulation period this is different from other Branham brother Branham said The Sixth Seal is the whole seven year tribulation period the second difference is that Clarence Larkin had the battle of Armageddon separate from The Sixth Seal The Sixth Seal was well before the battle of Armageddon on Larkin's timeline this is different from other Branham brother Branham said Armageddon ended the Sixth Seal the battle of Armageddon takes place on this side see all right and when the tribulation period is in now and third Larkin had Moses and Elijah's Ministry after the Sixth Seal in the second half of the Great Tribulation period this is different from Brother Branham brother Branham had Moses and Elijah initiating The Sixth Seal and then ministering for only the first three and a half years of The Seven Year tribulation period and now here's these two prophets in here with the word of God and make sure they want to have this houses reimbursemented again amen ities [Music] praise the Lord [Music] is your six seal coming open see and the same time the tribulation Falls of all fat people and while the tribulation is falling in there comes these two prophets of Revelations 11 to preach the gospel to them and they preach a thousand 103 score dates see well that's exactly what 30 days the month like the real character has is it is exactly three and one half years that's now the proof of these claims are found on page 132 and 133 of Clarence Larkin's book called dispensational Truth I have a copy of this book this is a beautifully illustrated book and here's a screenshot so you can see it now if you zoom out beginning on the left here we see the Rapture of the church and Clarence Larkin says that is in Revelation chapter four and five and then we have the first half of the week the first three and a half years you have the middle of the week Larkin shows and then the second half of the week and then after that of course at the end of the second half of the week is the battle of Armageddon and then the millennium now as we look at the map Larkin believed the Book of Revelation goes in chronological order so here are the Seven Seals at the very beginning of the first half of the week the first three and a half years of the Great Tribulation period here's the first seal second seal third seal four seal fifth seal and there's The Sixth Seal the seventh seal is after what Larkin called the interval between the sixth and seventh seal so this map plainly shows The Sixth Seal right here is one small event within the Great Tribulation period but brother random said The Sixth Seal is the entire Great Tribulation period let's listen to the quote that's what takes place the bride has gone think so that's proof of the first difference between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin here's proof of the second difference between brother Branham and Larkin Larkin had the battle of Armageddon separate from The Sixth Seal so again here's the Sixth Seal on Clarence Larkin's timeline it's in the first half of Daniel's 70th week now we slide over here to the right of this chart and the battle of Armageddon is here at the end the very end of the Great Tribulation period now of course the battle of Armageddon is in the right place but Larkin 60 of course is wrong the six seals the entire Great Tribulation period here's proof of the third difference between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin here towards the middle of Daniel's 70th week we have the ministry of the two witnesses as you can see here's Moses and Elijah and their Ministry takes place after the Sixth Seal here's the Sixth Seal on Larkin's timeline and of course we see Moses and Elijah happening after the Sixth Seal and of course brother Ram differed brother Branham said Moses and Elijah initiate the Sixth Seal because they have the power to start the six seal which are the physical changes the convulsions of the Earth the interruption of nature as God begins to pour out his wrath upon the unrepentant people on the Earth and friends I just found a fourth difference while I'm recording this here Larkin has the 144 000 Jews sealed between the six and seven seals but of course that's wrong they cannot get sealed until after the ministry of Moses and Elijah because Moses and Elijah have to preach Christ to the blinded Jews and after Moses and Elijah's Rapture Jesus will reveal himself to the 144 thousand and then Zechariah Chapter 12 and 13 will be fulfilled where there's a fountain open in the House of David and Jews will realize they crucify their Messiah and weep and mourn from house to house and then a nation will be born in one day with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so now that takes us up to 33 differences between brother Branham and these three other ministers on the first six seals now let's go over the six times brother Branham seemed to use Clarence Larkin on The Sixth Seal the first use is brother Ram said The Sixth Seal is the day of the Lord or the day of judgment it shall come as a destruction from the almighty what's this six seal open up and of course we find this work in Larkin's book regarding the day of the Lord Larkin said quote in Isaiah 13 verses 9 and 10 we read behold the day the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the Sinners thereof out of it end quote the second similarity is brother random seem to use Larkin's statement that the Sixth Seal had travail pains before the millennial age Larkin said the Great Earthquake the sun becoming as black as sackcloth the moon becoming his blood the Stars falling to heaven the heaven departing as a scroll and every mountain and Island moved out of their place are travail pains before the millennial age and the World of Nature they have mercy yes I said what's the matter she's incredible foreign [Applause] third similarity is that Larkin said Moses and Elijah were the two prophets to Israel and here you can see Moses and Elijah as the two witnesses according to Clarence Larkin on his chart called the tribulation period or Daniel's 70th week the reign of antichrist the four similarities that brother Branham seem to use Larkin's teachings about Jesus preaching the Seven Seals in Matthew 24 at the Olivet discourse here you can see a screenshot of it brother random spoke of Tuesday afternoon April 4th A.D 30. now now soon April the 4th 80 30. and the first two verses took place on the afternoon of the of April the 4th and 80 30 and the third verse taken place on Tuesday evening of the same day well the brand spoke of the threefold question that was asked Jesus are asked by the Jews his disciples three questions asked what what um uh first first was when shall these things be when they won't be one stone left upon another what shall be the sign of thy coming second question and of the end of the world see it there's three questions now that's where many men make their mistake and then brother random showed how the first second third fourth fifth and sixth seals were in Matthew chapter 24. the fifth similarity is that brother Branham read Exodus 10 verses 21-23 and Larkin use those scriptures on The Sixth Seal Larkin said quote we must not forget the great darkness that for three days overspread Egypt in the days before The Exodus Exodus 10 verses 21-23 nor the darkness that settled over Jerusalem and Calvary on the day of the crucifixion of Christ Matthew 27 45 end quote of course Israel was coming out six and finally brother Branham used Isaiah chapter 13 verses 9 and 10 on the Sixth Seal sermon and Clarence Larkin use these scriptures as well Larkin wrote quote in Isaiah 13 verses 9 and 10 we read behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the Sinners thereof out of it end quote Bible in itself you know so in conclusion we can see brother Brandon not plagiarize Clarence Larkin on The Sixth Seal brother Branham had at least four differences from Clarence Larkin on The Sixth Seal it's clear he agreed with him and use his work about six times and based upon brother braham's Christian integrity and how he referenced Larkin on Daniel's 70th week it seems brother Brown likely just forgot to reference Larkin on The Sixth Seal and also the future home we also remember that brother Braham differed greatly from both Clarence Larkin and Charles Hayes Russell on the first five seals and we recognize that God gave Clarence Larkin not all but a lot of understanding on The Sixth Seal so we thank God for that and before moving on remember we have to look at these seals as though Larkin finally got one partially right and that brother Branham had all of them right because brother random had thus saith the Lord and brother random seals and the interpretations of the seals do not contradict any other scriptures in the Bible whereas Larkins Russells and Uriah Smith's do contradict other Bible teachings and historical events that take place in the scriptures where the brand was the only one who had thus saith the Lord on all the seals next let's compare William Branham and Charles Taze Russell here's a screenshot of Charles Tay's Russell's work on the Sixth Seal and Friends there's no similarities between brother Branham and Charles Tays Russell on The Sixth Seal Russell said the timing of the first event of The Sixth Seal took place on November 1st 1755. Russell said quote and lo there was a great earthquake literally the great Lisbon earthquake November 1st 1755 which extended over four main square miles shocked all Africa and Western Europe end quote of course brother branham's Sixth Seal hasn't happened yet it's in the future after the Gentile Church Rapture during the seven year Great Tribulation period or Daniel's 70th week also notice Russell's final event of The Sixth Seal when Sinners hide in the rocks and mountains he said it was already underway at the time of the writing of his book in 1917. Russell wrote quote and said to the mountains of rocks fall on us the real fulfillment is already beginning the great the rich and no less the poor seeking to the mountains and rocks and caves for shelter from the darkening storm of trouble which all sea is gathering end quote here's the timeline comparing brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell on The Sixth Seal again you can see there's no plagiarism here Charles Hayes Russell's Sixth Seal was about from 1755 to 1917. and brother Ram six seal has not happened yet it's still during the future the Great Tribulation period and the dates of those seven years is unknown this again vindicates brother Bynum as a genuine Prophet with a different Revelation than Clarence Larkin Charles days Russell and Uriah Smith now let's compare brother Branham and Uriah Smith on The Sixth Seal again there's no similarities between brother Branham and Uriah Smith Uriah Smith was actually very close to Charles Tays Russell and said the first event of The Sixth Seal was November 1st 1775 and he also said the moon became his blood in 1780 here's pictures of those pages and I'll read them verbatim by God's grace Smith said quote the Great Earthquake the first event under this seal perhaps the one which marks its opening is a great earthquake as the more probable fulfillment of this prediction we refer to the Great Earthquake of November 1st 1755 known as the earthquake of Lisbon end quote so it seems charlestones Russell got his interpretation of The Sixth Seal from Uriah Smith because Uriah Smith's book was printed earlier in 1903. also Smith said quote the moon became his blood the darkness of the following night May 19 1780 was as unnatural as that of the day had been end quote also in your eismus book he said in 1903 the 60 will be completed not far hence and would be immediately followed by the coming of the Lord regarding the last event Uriah Smith said quote we have reached the year 1903 105 years this side the ending of the days and shaking of the powers of heaven will be completed not far hence as other prophecies show and in immediate connection with that as Joel and John plainly declare the coming of the Lord is to take place end quote here's a timeline comparing brother branham's Revelation on The Sixth Seal and Uriah Smith's teaching on The Sixth Seal again Uriah Smith's teaching is very similar to Charles Taze Russell it seems Russell borrowed a lot of the work from Uriah Smith on The Sixth Seal but anyways Uriah Smith said The Sixth Seal was from 1755 to 1903 right around the time of Rye Smith's death and of course by the brand six seal is during the future The Seven Year Great Tribulation period which hasn't started yet and so the dates are unknown so again we thank the Lord that he revealed the truth of the six seal to his genuine Prophet brother William Branham in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing we're almost done with these Seven Seals showing how brother Ram did not plagiarize Charles Taze Russell Clarence Larkin nor Uriah Smith friends we've got to give brother Brown the benefit of the doubt he lived a holy Godly Christian Life the Lord Jesus Christ used it mightily with his gift of discernment healing prophecy teaching and so many more gifts of the Holy Spirit or the random made references to over 20 historians or historical documents during the church ages and reference Samuel Schmucker Uriah Smith during the Seven Seals so CNG just forgot to mention Larkin during The Sixth Seal so we're thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ revealing the revelation of the Seven Seals to his Prophet brother Branham and we look forward to the final video of the seventh seal Lord willing I'll try to get to that here in the next few weeks by God's grace if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
