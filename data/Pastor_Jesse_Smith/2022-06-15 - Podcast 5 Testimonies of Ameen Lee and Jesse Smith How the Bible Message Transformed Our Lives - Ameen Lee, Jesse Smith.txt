TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] god bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith and we have our other co-hosts with us today hi i'm eamon and i'm glad to be here today with our pastor by god's grace we felt led to start recording some church testimonies of the saints in our church and we're going to use these testimonies by the grace of god to help defend the message because we know god's bible-based message today that he sent through his prophet brother william branham is under attack so there's a group that's left the message of brother branham and they're totally attacking it calling it false and all kinds of other words i would not repeat and it's really sad and it's a shame that they're attacking the the true word of god and their group has all these testimonies about how they've come out of the message and their lives are different but for us we understand if they've left the message which is the revelations of god then their lives cannot be perfectly in tune with the word of god so we feel burdened by the grace of god to share how our lives have been restored our lives have been transformed by the message because the message is the scriptures that god is fulfilling right now and we know the holy ghost is currently ministering to churches who preach the full revelation of god that believe that all the mysteries of god are finished and it's reproducing another book of acts church by the grace of god so we're going to start with the testimonies of brother amen and myself in this initial podcast and hopefully we'll be able to expand out to other saints in our church by the grace of god so brother amen and i are going to take turns asking each other questions and hopefully it's a blessing to you and hopefully you get a lot out of this podcast recording here and just so you know we're recording live at a sunday night church service so we have a very happy audience we have a very wonderful audience especially these young children smiling faces out there a lot of smiling adults so if you hear some noise in the background that's acceptable that's going to be normal and but it's something we're trying to do in order to save time and not have separate days to record we'd like to just record when we're all together by god's grace so hopefully there won't be much background noise and even if there is some noise i don't think it will bother you at all so our first question is what was your childhood like in relation to learning about jesus well i remember the first encounter i had with god was in fifth grade and this was when my dad started becoming a pastor of the church i think was assemblies of god church down in shibuya wisconsin and they were having their sunday school meeting and i was there and the first time i i felt god's presence was it was like a beautiful day and there was a song that was playing in the background it was at the cross by marathon singers and but i immediately felt the presence of god and i knew that that moment i wanted to serve him at that spot and that's when i started learning a little bit about god from my dad because he was a pastor and that's what that started my journey on being a christian learning to be like christian so how about you pastor jesse how was your childhood my first memories of god were my mom taking my brothers and i to church she would go all alone because my dad wouldn't go and i had all good interactions i remember in sunday school i remember the felt board and we would have we'd get to put pieces of felt and bible characters up on the felt board and i'd really kind sunday school teacher i can still remember her name ruth febak for some reason i can still remember her name she's very sweet to us i remember going in front of the church we of course went to assembly of god church and we would recite little rhymes about the bible every christmas and i can remember sunday school we'd sing songs i may never march in the infantry right in the calvary we had a lot of fun so those are my first memories i would say the most impactful one though was when i was in second grade and my mom had cancer my mom had liver cancer when i was in second grade and so i remember driving to the hospital with my grandma to visit her and seeing my mom lay there in the hospital bed and not knowing if she was going to come out the doctor said she had six months to live and i remember being very sad but then i remember my mom coming home and she was well i would learn later that there were two amazing things that happened that led to my mom's healing from liver cancer first there was another woman in my mom's church and she woke up one morning and the holy spirit spoke to her and gave her a scripture and the verse was psalm 118 verse 17 i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord so my mom's friend rushed to the hospital and told her that the holy spirit had given her this verse and that my mom was going to be well my mom received it right away because she had been praying over the last five or six years that god would give her a miracle she never asked god for any specific miracle she just said a miracle so my mom had faith in that promised word from her friend so my mom received that scripture right away and had faith in the promised word that she was going to be made well not long after that the doctors wanted to have some type of surgery to kind of look at the cancer and see if they could remove any on the night before her surgery my dad said he went into my mom's hospital room and laid his hand right on the location of the cancer and he said he rebuked that cancer in the name of jesus christ the next day my mom had surgery they opened her up and they could not find any liver cancer the cancer had completely vanished it was a bona fide miracle by the hand of jesus christ my mom still has the scar to this day from that surgery and also has that testimony from psalm 118 verse 17. she's not died but she's lived and declared the works of the lord and my mom would take us to different churches in the toledo ohio area and testify about the healing power of god so i can say from a young age i had all positive experiences in church and then just a supernatural miracle i got to witness without when i was in second grade but amen anything else about your childhood did you remember yes uh middle school was we had this big gathering of churches so we had this big conference down in the semis of god church and i remember at the end of the service they're like oh who wants to accept jesus in their heart who wants to accept it and i i remember i went up i was the youngest one there because i was in middle school and i went up there i'm like yes i want to accept god and serve him from missing out so they took all of us those like maybe five or six people who went into this group and they're all giving us little packets and they're all talking to everyone oh god bless you guys i'm grateful you guys want to be christians and no one ever talked to me once and i'm like this is this christianity i'm like i was a kid so i didn't know any better but i'm like oh okay i guess i'm really young so no one wants to talk to me about following god but i still follow god from that point on regardless of the experience and that one stood with me the whole time hallelujah that's a beautiful testimony then brother can you share a little bit about how you had such a desire to go to church that sometimes you go by yourself yes so in high school so my dad used to be a pastor and they didn't like his preaching so they took him out of office and he stopped my whole family stopped going to church and i was the only one who wanted to go to church so my dad took me to a church it was a cma church and that's when i first started going to youth there and my dad only went and took me there once and after that he stopped taking me but that one time i went there i just felt like i was at home like this is where i belong here at church and from that point on i would go to church every single week in the rain in the snow i would walk a lot i probably lived maybe like three four miles away and i did a lot walking but i i just loved god so much that i wanted to go to church every single time and my dad would always yell at me he's like why are you guys why are you always going out so late why are you going hanging out with people and you're such a rebel and a kid but i'm like i just going to church to hang out with the youth and to hang out with my friends and that's not anything bad but my dad would always fight me for going for going to church but i assisted with it and from that point on you know my dad and i we didn't have a good relationship from that because he thought i was a bad kid but i was just going to church because i wanted to go to church that's an awesome testimony to see how you would walk through snow you know miles or we all hear about people who say i walk to school through numerous miles of snow just to get to school you know in the old days before they had snow plows and things but brother amen's just a real life example of someone that would walk through snow rain cold just to go to the house of god all by himself and so there we can see the love of god that was already in his heart from a child i think that's a beautiful testimony brother and that reminds me too when i was a child i had a heart for god so in third and fourth grade and fifth grade i started memorizing the scripture with my friend named eric and he took me to his word of life wednesday night bible club and i had a three ring binder i started memorizing the scriptures i wanted to really memorize but then something came into my life it was a cassette tape by amy grant she put out a secular album called heart in motion and i can still i can still picture the cover to this day now before this amy grant album she was actually singing for jesus she's saying thy word which is a beautiful song thy word is the lamp into my feet light into my path but that was the year she crossed over into secular songs and fifth grade was actually that was the time that i got that secular album from amy grant and that drove me away from god i stopped memorizing scripture i stopped want to go to church because now i was singing these love songs that's when i started to want girlfriends that was just the downfall of my life it was basically that secular music and i remember my mom warned me don't buy that don't buy that i don't want that in the house because she knew the evil effects but i was rebellious even as a fifth grader and that was the moment i left god and and i would later see how sinful music took me away from god but then god would use christian music later to bring me back to him so move to the second question the second question is when and why did you finally surrender to jesus and repent of your sins i think it's funny that my name is amen really funny because anything i hear from the word god i always automatically be like i believe it it was just in me when i was growing up so i never doubted god's word so it was just as soon as i heard the bible or i heard god i immediately just listened and just was drawn to it so i don't think there was an actual moment where i completely said i want to to follow god and like leave my life away from sin i think it was just kind of borne into me where i just heard about god and i just knew i just wanted to serve him from that point like what age would you estimate or what grade would you estimate where you really started growing or anything like that can you see like a certain moment where you like saw some growth okay so in in high school that's when i really started to grow in christ where i started going to i was taking choir and music and school and that's when i started using my gifts or my musical talent to i started playing music in church with their church band and that's when i started to grow in god with the knowledge and learning music and that's when my ministry just started learning how to play music and love god do that way awesome so god dealt with you heavily then in high school yes praise god okay so when when and why did you finally surrender jesus and repent so i surrendered and repented in it's either late 1999 december 99 or january 2000 i can never quite remember but that was my first year of college and again i'd been rebelling against god since fifth grade so for seven years i've been rebelling against god but when i was in college i was away from everyone i knew i moved from little liberty center ohio to akron ohio is a total culture shock to me because i was from a small farm town and i really had nobody i only knew the people on the football team in akron i knew no one else and so i was all by myself and so for that fall august september october november december i was of course still a sinner in college but on the weekends i would drive back home to see my girlfriend who's now my wife kristen and i would borrow my brother's car to go visit her and drive out to her house well cam had gotten saved that year so cam was the first one saved in our family which was a huge testimony and a wonderful blessing well in his car he had christian music and i would just let the christian music play and one of the songs came on called one of these days by ffh and it talked about seeing the hands that took the nails for me and having a mansion in heaven and as i just drove you know those couple miles out to kristen's house i would hear that and it was such a positive song it was it was a lot different than my rock and roll and my rap and metallica and snoop dogg that i was listening to it had such a those had such negative messages but when i heard this message of salvation and the cross and eternal life it really started softening my heart so in those months leading up to either december or january god used music to bring me back to him i was being drawn back to him at the same time during the weeks while at college the local pastor from the chapel mike arnold was meeting with me once every month or a couple times a month for breakfast and he'd talk about god also there was a couple guys on the football team at akron that were christians and they would try to be my friend to be my buddy so they started talking to me about god and then finally in december or january of 99 or 2000 they invited me to a athletes in action conference and i went and we were worshiping and i saw this large ohio state football player named tim anderson maybe he'll hear this and know how much i appreciate him but he was raising his hands worshiping and at that moment i felt so ashamed of myself god did he my mom of cancer god had brought me out of poverty giving me a full academic scholarship which was going to be worth a hundred thousand dollars or more and i felt so ashamed how can i not raise my hands to the god who's blessed me so much and so at that moment i started crying i started raising my hands i said if that guy can raise his hands what about me i can certainly do that and so i repented right there i accepted jesus christ as my savior as soon as the conference was over i remember that sunday night i got home i took down all my pictures on the wall i had pictures of immodestly dressed women i threw them in the trash i took all my cds of metallica and snoop dogg nirvana threw them in the trash and i opened my bible and that was the moment i repented and started following jesus christ so when did you first hear about the message and was your first first reaction to it i first heard about the message on thanksgiving night 2001. we're at a family gathering in wadsworth ohio and my brother simon was there and it was right after the 9 11 events and simon said you've got to sit down and hear this sermon it's a sermon about two seeds how god has two two seeds in the bible wheat and tears i'm like wow i never i'm like okay simon he kept asking me and asked me i'm like okay buddy we can do it you know we'll do it by god's grace and so that night it must have been around 10 or 11 o'clock on thanksgiving night we went up to my room in our college rental house and we listened to a two-hour sermon about two seeds and my eyes were just totally opened i never saw how god had two separate seeds a seed that was true to god's word but then as a false seed that would impersonate the true seed but ultimately be false and be rejected and so that was the first i heard about the message of the hour that god gave through his prophet brother branham and it was a very positive experience i mean i liked preaching before but now i love preaching that it just made preaching it took preaching to a whole another level because i never heard a man preach like that and so it was extremely positive experience life changing and then i started sharing with everybody i knew now i thought everybody was going to receive it i thought oh everybody can surely see these truths but found out the opposite most people turned it down which was understandable but to me it was a moment i'll never forget i just thought it was so fitting on thanksgiving night god brought me the message of the hour and before that i'd had so many questions i'd been a part of a penteco pentecostal church growing up and then i was part of a mega church presbyterian church and then i'd visited numerous baptist churches i'd visit all kinds of different churches but i never felt satisfied but once i heard that sermon i was satisfied i knew that's what i needed so brother amen when did you hear about the message and what kind of experience was it for you first summer the masses was 2014 and i was at the hmong church we were invited to go to pastor jesse's testimony meeting but i didn't go but i went after after they had their testimony meeting i went and showed up afterwards that's the first time i met pastor jesse and from the moment i met him i just knew that god was with him and that just instantly stuck with me the whole time so that time i was in the youth i was one of the leaders at the youth and i told my whole youth group i want to take our entire youth group to pastor jesse's church because the big theme they had was going out and like being with other churches i'm like okay let's take our entire youth group and go to pastor jesse's church so i got everything approved and we went to his church and pastor jesse preached my first sermon about the different types of denominations in the book of genesis and that's when i first heard the message and i was blown away by it and i went up for prayer i'm like this is something real that i always been praying for and i went and um went up there got prayed for and from that moment we went afterwards to burger king with the youth group and we were just talking about wow this is so different this is so refreshing and then we went back to our church and then we got yelled at big time by all the elders they're like pastor jesse's preaching a false doctrine and you guys shouldn't be going to this church because everything he preaches is false and it's of the devil and all that stuff but i'm like in my heart i'm like no this isn't right because i see love and holiness and god in this church so from that point on um this is when i first started being with my wife i met her a few years before him but this is the first time we actually interacted and i was telling her you know we're at a youth gathering and i was telling her and one of the places we're at i'm like pastor jesse has changed my life because he baptized me and i just feel so different from now and i was like yeah pastor jesse baptized me too and that's when mia will started talking a lot about the word and that's when she first shared um the serpent seed with me and at first i'm like okay it's i believe it yeah if i can find the bible i'll believe it you know and the first things he told me was you know since since we believe in this why don't we go to a wednesday night service and go to church today i'm like okay it'll be kind of like a little date we'll go together so we went to um pastor jesse's church on a wednesday night and this first sermon he preached to us was gideon about the barlow bread rolling down the hill and defeating the armies and that stuck with me forever and after that we started doing little bible studies from there on with pastor jesse and it just kind of went on there and then the turning point was a few months afterwards i decided to share a little bit of the message with my youth group and you know we have like little devotionals and they didn't receive it well and i got called out after by all the youth leaders and they were saying a lot of bad things about the church and you know they don't believe in water baptism the way we do and from that point i'm like okay you know you guys aren't sticking with the words so i'm not staying there any longer and from that point i told whoa who's my wife that i'm not staying in that church and i'm going to pastor jesse's church and we both decided to come and that's where we started coming to the message amen that reminds me of you know right before brother amen came to church in the summer of 2014 i had prayed and asked the lord i said lord i don't know if i should keep pastoring this church because the church was shrinking you know and getting smaller or if i should go out on the evangelistic field and just not be a pastor and just preach at other churches whenever i got invitations i just i said a simple prayer i emailed it to myself too and i said lord i said if you don't send me someone into our church that comes to faith in christ and believes our message by the end of the year i'm going to shut the church down and i'm just going to go into evangelism that was in the summer of 2014 a couple months later probably around september or you know august or october of that same year that's when brother amen and sisterhood came in and i was just blown away you know they received the message right away it was beautiful and then in november of 2014 i specifically remember when brother amen came up to me and said i'm going to make your church my home church and i just sealed the deal right there and i knew that god i'd put a fleece before god like gideon i said lord if you want me to do this i really need you to give me this sign and so you know a month before two months before that deadline god gave me that sign and i've always told it everywhere i've gone you know god gave me an amen to the fact that i'm supposed to be a pastor uh because god gave me amen lee by god's grace so that's a beautiful testimony how it kind of ties in with my ministry as well how brother you're an answer to my prayer by god's grace yeah same here um i i was praying that year too about you know i was really tired of the way i was living with my church and how everything was so fake with christianity it doesn't seem real to me i knew god was real but every everybody who was living christianity professing it was really fake to me and that's when i prayed one time down on my knees first time i prayed on my knees i was asking god where's the god of jacob abraham and isaac why don't i see you god in the bible and where are you and that's when i first uh heard about this church and that's when i first met this one yeah i remember when you were baptized brother i still have the picture on my phone for your contact you had a t-shirt on and said there must be something real i just thought that spoke volumes that basically told about your life you know you were i mean you would walk through the snow brother in denomination just to go to church all by yourself all alone and so you were you were so hungry for god you just wanted a living god that when you found it god gave you the victory you came right into it and god gave you something real so i just oh that's always spoke volumes to me you know that you were hungering for god you were willing to do so much to try to get a hold of a living god but then god revealed himself and i'm sure was in the right time in right season okay can you say a story maybe multiple stories about the transformation of the message that how it transformed your life yeah uh before the message came to me in uh november 2001 i was in like a college type of campus ministry and there were very good people in there but i always knew there was something lacking and there were so many things that i knew was wrong going on in the church like for example they would only preach on four things all year they would never go into deep things of god and i hungered for more i knew that was wrong i knew there was a need for more word of god also there was really no power to overcome sin i saw that in the church i saw a lot of compromise i saw the leaders would preach something but then they would go purposely support sinful things like maybe filthy movies or filthy books or filthy sporting events i'll say it like that and i just saw a lot of hypocrisy in the church but i still love them i appreciated their grace to me but i just knew something was wrong and so when the message came to me i met a group of young brothers in the message like dave llewellyn craig booher freddy booer and i just i looked at these guys they were living such holy lives and i said either these guys are the biggest pretenders or they have the real holy ghost because i knew all these other guys their same age in college they said they were christians but they didn't live the life they didn't live a holy life like for example some of the guys in the college ministry would they would compete and see how many girls they could go hug in order to just squeeze up on their bodies i'm just trying to be as trying to be as gracious as i can be and yet these were the same guys that would lead bible studies and try to lead people to christ i knew that was wrong also in the churches you know the college campus they would they would have like a summer series called the church at the movies and they would play scenes from movies like sinful movies with cuss words and violence and sex scenes and they would talk about that well i knew that was wrong i could read the bible the bible says set no wicked thing before your eyes i i knew these things were wrong so when the message came it showed me the power of transformation power for holy living in a daily life and that's what i wanted i knew i wasn't living right and at that time when i was in those college ministries i was addicted to dirty magazines i was addicted to dirty pictures online i was addicted to cussing i was addicted to sports i was addicted to tobacco i was addicted to so many things all kinds of things and i knew i wasn't living the life the bible said i should live but as soon as i heard the message i started quoting acts 2 38 and i never cussed again and then as soon as i started listening to brother branham preach eventually i got victory over tobacco and the dirty pictures the dirty movie sports in other words i i found such power in the message of of god that it gave me power i'd never experienced before and that was proof that this message was right because it transformed my life brother amen what's the story you want to share about the transformation the message has made in your life i just hear one um when i first started going to the message it was life-changing to me but and me and while we were dating at the time and there were times where i would say a lot of things that were a bit mean and rude to her but i didn't know any better at that time and i found out by the grace of god that he's been showing me how to be a better person or how to be nicer with my words not how to not to be so much sarcastic and learn how to be more understanding towards one another and that's when god really started changing me and there are times when meanwhile we would get into a few arguments and i wouldn't know that there would be things inside of me that came out you know i wouldn't know these things unless it happened in that situation and god's been dealing god had deal with me with those issues you know i shouldn't be so angry at times or having a lot of temper tantrums in that situation or in multiple situations and god's been really helping me overcome you know being really angry at times thanks to them thanks to the message i that really transformed my life around where i can now talk to my wife and be more really respectful to her without hurting her feelings anyway and the other thing i'm pretty sure a lot of people are dealing with is with video games i used to be extremely extremely addicted to video games so what happened when i came to the message was i had a lot of game systems like playstation 4 xbox nintendo all that stuff and there was this time where pastor jesse was preaching about not having a tv in our house and i just felt burdened a month later we got rid of our tv and that felt like a great victory and a few months later meanwhile we're talking like oh let's you know let's get a tv we missed our tv so we go out and buy it again and then pastor jesse comes and preaches a similar message about getting a t creating a game rating of your tv because it's not good for you and me and who were like okay let's give it away so we gave it to uh one of her sisters and we gave away that tv and then the whole year goes by and we both wanted a tv again so we bought it three times about three tvs three times and pastor jesse came up and he preached another sermon about having tvs again and we're like okay i we give up i give up i can't do this anymore god you win well we got rid of our tv and that's the same thing that happened with my video games i was playing a lot of video games at the time too and got rid of the tv so you don't have a tv you can't play video games at the same time man god damn me with that so i sold my games and then i bought a new system and went and played that for a little while and then i sold it again because i feeling the conviction of god telling me to get rid of these things and i did that exactly three times again with the same thing with the tv i bought three different video game systems three times and i finally got rid of my last one the last one before i got the holy ghost and um god was really doing me my video game addiction and i think the grace by god that i am no longer play video games hallelujah i didn't know that so that's that's a new story to me brother so i never knew about the tv so it just must have been the unction of the holy spirit the inspiration of god praise god you know another story for me like you said earlier about love in your relationships that's been huge for me you know through the message that god gave brother branham it's pointed us back to the bible and the bible talks about how a husband must love his wife as christ loved the church and i would hear that denomination but i wouldn't understand it well then i would listen to brother branham and he would talk about how you actually do that he said you got to sit down with your wife you have to listen to your wife you have to show her respect she's not a doormat she should always be your sweetheart he said you should always be on a honeymoon with your wife and you know my wife and i before we got married you know during our childhood both of our parents were divorced and so we came from broken homes and even before i came in the message even as a christian i said the one thing i want is a happy marriage that's all i want i just want a happy home because i didn't have a happy home growing up mom and dad fought a lot and they fought over late religion of all things um that was the main thing they they fought about but then after the message came in 2001 and 2002 people would give us quote books and one of the quote books was about marriage and family so i got to read all these quotes from brother branham and it would always point me back to the bible and i'd have all these scriptures on a husband must love his wife and how brother branham loved his wife and now you know it's created such a wonderful atmosphere in our home it's all attributed to the love of god and a couple examples are we've had family members come and visit us and in particular one family member came and spent the weekend with us and when they were leaving they cried and then they called me up when they got home after three hour drive and said i'm still crying because i had never seen such love in a family before and then we had another family member who visited visits us quite often and she will just bring it up on her own and she'll say wow i've been to lots of places i've been around a lot of families but you have a special family something is special about your family something's different our kids work with a volunteer non-profit organization and the leaders of that organization will come up and say how do you guys do it how do you make children like this and we always say it's just by god's grace now i joke around and say well they got to listen to their dad scream and preach three times a week that's that's probably hard for them no that's probably part of it but they get to hear a lot of preaching but also their mother's at home and their mother is constantly talking with them correcting them teaching them about god's word and if you live what you preach if you practice what you preach it will produce the results of the bible it'll produce children that love jesus christ and because of that by god's grace i baptize six out of my eight children another transformation the message has brought is within literal church services when i would go to the pentecostal church sometimes there was power but it was mostly emotion was speaking in tongues and there would be tongues and interpretations when i was growing up but nothing real specific and yeah we had a couple healings some were powerful like my mother's healing from cancer that was tremendous but when i come in the message i saw things above and beyond that you know we've seen cancers heal we've seen seizures healed i've seen arthritis healed i've seen a kidney stone healed instantaneously so by the miraculous power of god numerous times people have received children that couldn't have children we've had numerous people in the hospital come all the way back from being on a ventilator like one of the brothers in the church his dad had had a heart attack but we prayed uh the brother laid a prayer cloth on him the doctor gave him less than a one percent chance to live but he's alive today by the grace of god the supernatural power of god my brother simon has prayed for people that were close to death and they come back to life in full health and complete victory in the name of jesus christ and then also we've seen power to cast out devils deliver people from addictions and i just didn't see that in denominations now that doesn't mean they're not denominations but when i come in the message and we saw the word of god preach we saw the same things that they saw in the bible that reminds me one time a woman came up and was bleeding i didn't know it she just said pray for me i prayed for her it was actually in this church around 2015 and instantly the bleeding dried up inside of her body and then her and her husband called me the next day just rejoicing that jesus christ was the same yesterday today and forever he healed the woman's blood issue of 18 years in the bible and here was in 2015 jesus christ is still the same he still dries up blood issues by his grace and his mercy and that's my god something that yeah so i noticed when i was in the cma church there was no supernatural never any supernatural and they denied a lot of miracles but then when i first came to this message i started seeing the power of god and the muslim i will i would feel his presence a lot and just going to this church and i knew that god was real because i could just feel them i can see him and the people around me and with the the saints and the powerful testimonies and actually witness and see many things coming past like many healings this first time i actually seen someone speak in tongues and like answer prayers that god instantly you know gives it to you compared to being a denomination i've never seen any of that so by coming here you just see the power of god move so much more like god just blesses you so much more when you're walking with him at one time i was sick with what i think was strep throat for like seven or eight or nine days and i still came to church during the service i wasn't preaching thank god but we had a guest preacher from india and i couldn't even sing during the song service my throat hurt so bad i probably should not have been a church i was probably contagious but anyways i just i couldn't miss church i loved church so much but anyways i went up for prayer at the service he just prayed for me anointed me with oil i went back to my seat actually i was running the computer in the back and then as we were singing the last song i started singing and my voice was completely well after over a week of having no voice and a painful throat i was instantly healed right there in the in the service and i just shouted and praised god and so i've even experienced it in myself in my own life personally and i'll never forget this one on a wednesday night a few months ago one of the new sisters in our church sister lena her mom was missing her mom had gotten sick with an addiction and was missing well we didn't know what to do our hearts were all tore up because of that and so we just come up for prayer and i said let's just join hands and let's pray that they'll find lena's mother and we just prayed sincerely and i just love how god can move on wednesday night just like he can move on a sunday morning or a sunday night god's always moving whenever people have faith and we started praying and the prayer just kept getting more and more serious more and more sincere and then all of a sudden when the sister started shouting out jesus jesus jesus and we just felt the presence of god just like it fell right on us we were all weeping and crying and praising the lord and we were worshiping god and then all of a sudden a brother who was praying with us said get out satan get out satan get out satan and we just me i mean i remember my hands hurt afterwards because we were grabbing hands and holdings holding so hard you know just believing god's word at that moment and i think the next day if i'm not mistaken uh the sister got word back that they had found her mother she wasn't dead she was alive and that was that was just a reason to rejoice the fact that she was still alive because of her her health condition and then a week later i was able to talk with some of the mother's friends and relay some things and the mother repented of the evil that she did so it's like during the prayer we were shouting out to jesus jesus spirit comes down to vindicate that he was going to answer the prayer and then the brother was shouting get out satan get out and that was we believe that was the enemy being pushed out where the beforehand the mother couldn't repent but now she could repent because satan was cast out so that's just another example of the power of god just god heard our prayers the spirit came down right in the congregation and then god answered the request can you tell us why the message means so much to you so just as a summary the message has been the full revelation of jesus christ so i felt like in denominations i had a partial revelation of jesus christ but now i feel like i have a full revelation of jesus christ and that's scriptural because in acts 17 11 the bible said elias shall come and restore all things so before jesus returns he has to restore his word back and jesus is the word so i feel like we have a full understanding of jesus christ also revelation 10 7 says the mystery of god would be finished and so the bible defined mysteries about god they're finished so we can understand the bible as jesus told his disciples these the mysteries are given to you and then the bible says in deuteronomy 29 29 the mysteries of god are yours and your children's that you may do all the word of god so the message means so much to me because now i see jesus christ in his true character and now the bible has become a new bible and i see the living jesus christ not in a man-made denomination that adds to the bible or takes away from the bible but in a true book of acts experience i experienced jesus christ the way they did in the book of acts brother amen what advice would you give people with questions about the message of the hour i would firstly say pray about it to see if you really want the truth or not and god would certainly lead you first and second of all i think the most important thing is don't believe everything you hear that you should take everything back to the word of god because there's a lot of teachers that are very intellectual and they sound very good and sound and doctrine and they can lead you astray and when i was in the message i heard a lot of different stories from other people who were not in the message like some prophecies or teachings they had that didn't line up with the word of god and i was led astray for that for a season but it wasn't in the word of god and i always had to take everything back to where god take it back to your pastor and go from there and so i would advise people who want to know the truth well if they really want to know the truth then they should be able to kind of do your own homework and take everything back to the word of god and with this message you're able to take everything back to the word of god and that's why i believe it so much because it's all biblical it's all in the bible you can prove everything in the message that's been being preached and that's what gives us power to overcome this world any advice you want to get past your jesse yeah for people that are either optimistic or pessimistic about the message if you're optimistic about the message then the best advice i can give you is listen to brother branham and then have your bible right next to it because just like acts 17 11 says the men in berea were more noble than those in thessalonica because they searched the scriptures daily whether these things were so so that's what i did in my life i would listen to brother branham and then have my bible open and i would have the scriptures there to vindicate what brother branham said now of course for our listeners brother branham was not perfect brother bran was not god he was not infallible not every thought of his was right but the majority of his preaching was right and he did grow in revelation as he matured god showed him more and more of the revelation of the mystery of god so for people that are optimistic keep listening to the tapes and if you're optimistic i'd also say stay away from the jeffersonville movement because they worship brother branham they worship brother rams tape so stay away from that camp and also stay away from the camp that attacks brother branham but i would encourage you if you have questions reach out to us brother amen and i can take your questions or reach out to a trusted minister who has really studied brother brown's message and knows about a lot of brother ram's life and can be honest with you and share the real quotes from brother branham but also show how brother branham may have had human weaknesses but then also all the victories god gave him because brother man was different than everybody else because he spoke with thus saith the lord and in my 2021 book i have over 30 examples of thus saith the lord's that have come to pass regarding prophecy but also regarding people's healings and bible doctrines and mysteries of god that are now finished so we have so much proof that this message is right so i encourage anyone who's optimistic to do those things so what is the most important thing you want listeners to know about jesus and the message probably hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ did the same yesterday today and forever that if you really love jesus christ and you read about him in the bible you can know that he's the same in every detail except there's no corporal body here today so as jesus acted in the gospels that's what the holy spirit acts like today in the lives of real people who are filled with his holy ghost that's the most important lesson i've learned that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the bible says prove all things so everything that's true can be proven right by the bible every question we have can be proven by the word of god and the bible is our absolute brother branham was not our absolute he was pointing to the absolute which is jesus christ and his word so brother as we close here what's the most important lesson you've learned from the message that you'd like to pass on i think the one that hits me the most is when god tells you that there are four kinds of people on earth and there are two different types of christians and that's where it gets people get really confused that all christian all christians are lumped into one group which is not true because the catholics they don't represent all christianity or protestants they don't represent all christianities so i through this i learned about wise virgins and foolish virgins two types of christians and i'm thanking god that god chose us to receive all of this word to really understand that there's christians everywhere even in denominations but not everyone who says like they're a christian as a christian so i'm thankful that god's able to help us discern those things and that's just like what brother branham said we got to have the holy ghost to discern the two spirits in the framework of the church so that we can stay with the holy spirit and overcome the antichrist spirit we want to thank you for listening to this podcast we hope it was a blessing and we hope you like this direction we're going we like to give some testimonies of some of the saints in our church that helped defend the message showing that the power of jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever transforming lives and that the book of acts is still going on and it's active and our lives are part of that book of acts by the grace of god through the constant moving of the holy ghost in our lives if you have any questions for us you can always feel free to reach out and email me at jesse.smith11 sbcglobal.net or you can text me at 330-929 we want to say god bless you and may jesus christ anoint you to defend the message of the hour as paul also said in philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing that i am set for the defense of the gospel [Music] you
