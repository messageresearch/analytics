Description:
In Christian love and brotherly kindness, I offer my opinion about Joseph Branham's status as a prophet. I do not believe our precious brother Joseph is a prophet, at least not yet, because he does not meet the same Bible qualifications his father met, William Branham. May the Lord Jesus Christ direct this video to souls in the valley of decision, wavering between believing the true Word of God or Branham Tabernacle's false teachings.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ is our precious brother joseph branham a prophet my personal opinion is no at least not yet and this video explains why again i believe joseph's father brother william branham was a genuine prophet of god the seventh church age messenger and the fulfillment of luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 malachi 4 5 and 6 and more by god's grace i preached brother branham's bible revelations for 16 years i first want to say i love and respect our brother in christ brother joseph with christian love he and i have exchanged a few letters and emails i've reached out to him also through private video given him a free copy of my book and tried to share corrections for some of his false teachings but to this point he's not received any of my corrections but that's his right as an american and as a minister after praying and fasting i felt led to make this video for a few reasons first i want to be a voice of truth brother joseph and brother billy paul influence millions and while some of their teachings are correct there are some very dangerous teachings they hold my prayer is that god will direct this video to those who desire the truth about joseph branham's ministry and have some concerns about billy paul's comments and also branham tabernacle again this video is made in brotherly kindness just as brother branham used kindness when trying to publicly correct billy graham david duplessis brother gilmore and brother brock to name a few i'll use this outline for the video first does joseph meet the bible requirements for prophet second we'll examine brother branham's quotes about joseph and third we'll address concerns related to joseph and billy paul first does joseph meet the same bible requirements his father met as with every person who claims to be or exalted to be a prophet christians must give them the word test i'll use the same six bible requirements i used to validate william branham as a genuine prophet to test if joseph is a prophet and i just want to say friends these are not my bible requirements but brother ranum teaches them in the church age book and some of his other sermons i've just gathered them all together and it seems there are six bible requirements for a prophet you can see more about these six bible requirements in our video three prophecies of william branham the first is living a holy life according to first corinthians 9 verses 15 to 27 undoubtedly william branham lived a holy life of integrity as for joseph branham it seems he's lived a holy life so it's possible he meets this qualification second requirement is they must teach the word impurity according to galatians 1 6 through 12. without question william branham taught the word impurity we know he grew in revelation such as with the trinity and the white horse rider so we have to allow room for joseph branham to grow in revelation for joseph branham he does teach much truth but i'm convinced he teaches at least four or five false doctrines including idolatry examples include his following quotations first his false teaching about the fivefold ministry he says and i quote the true fivefold ministry preach then they played her rahab a tape that's what the fivefold ministry is supposed to do end quote a second false doctrine is about misinterpreting the word of revelation 22 16. remember brother branham said this is one of the five must nots when preaching the word of god joseph says and i quote many critics without revelation say brother branham never said play tapes in the church that's called ears but can't hear others say we just believe the bible and it don't say in the bible neither jesus himself said play tapes in your local church end quote i covered this false doctrine and addition to the word in my video called tape boys are not part of jesus's fivefold ministry if jesus is saying play tapes instead of living preachers he's deleting the fivefold ministry he taught paul in ephesians 4 verse 11. it would also change the gospel paul was given which paul said couldn't be changed in galatians 1. paul warned of another gospel that didn't match the one christ gave him third it seems joseph promotes idolatry of brother branham because he says and i quote i believe everything brother branham says is thus saith the lord this message has to be my absolute end quote this statement makes every word of william branham thus saith the lord or infallible which is idolatry joseph goes on to say and i quote it must be all or nothing i have to believe that everything on tape is thus saith the lord and the absolute the token for our day and i must unquestionably believe every word of brother branham on tape end quote this is a dangerous false doctrine and i humbly believe it's the spirit of idolatry the danger of these statements is deifying william branham by making every word he said the absolute when not every word he said was from god third they teach only the true seed of abraham believe every word on brother branham's tapes which excludes everyone else from being the royal seed of abraham and i quote joseph but god's prophet told us there would be a group of people that would believe every word they are the real living seed of abraham end quote notice also the pressure of fear this movement is using they say falsely of course if you don't believe every word on brother rams tapes or thus saith the lord you are not the real royal seat of abraham and that's an error a fourth false teaching is about the token joseph believes the tapes are the token and that being a part of a tape church is the token and also gave a mandate to stop preaching in order to play tapes and i quote she speaking of rahab had to show her token she said i'm a tape church that's the token i'd say it's real important to say that we're a tape church they referring to preachers got to catch the vision you've got to play the tapes you've got to amen they're the token end quote so in my opinion joseph branham fails this requirement as teaching the word in its purity a third requirement is having converts or fruit of the ministry according to first corinthians 9 verse 2 first thessalonians 2 verse 19. william branham had many converts estimated in the 2 millions for joseph branham it seems he may have some but we'd have to question their experience if they believe these four false doctrines which includes idolatry a fourth requirement is revealing secrets according to amos 3 verse 7. william branham was used by god to reveal the seven seals and the bible-defined mysteries such as the rapture the baptism of the holy ghost and more for joseph branham i have heard no examples of his revealing secrets so i believe he fails in meeting this requirement the fifth requirement is anointing for supernatural works according to first chronicles 16 22 acts 5 12 mark 16 verses 17 and 18 and john 16 13. william branham had many supernatural signs and i've met a couple who experienced this for joseph branham it seems so as we heard about a man being raised from the dead in their church through prayer so it's possible joseph branham meets this requirement the final requirement is foretelling the future in the name of the lord according to deuteronomy 18 22 and james 5 verse 10. for william branham he's foretold healings in the name of the lord as well as three prophecies that are in the process of coming to pass for joseph branham i have not heard him foretell any events in the name of the lord i've sat down and talked to two of his childhood friends and neither have heard him say thus saith the lord in his entire life and he's about 64 65 years old in contrast brother branham said thus saith the lord over one thousand times on tape so in conclusion the word test shows william branham meets all six requirements but it seems joseph branham only meets about three of them and one is questionable so joseph branham is not a prophet in my opinion at least not yet to be a prophet he'd have to meet the other requirements which would require him repenting of his false doctrine and then speaking and foretelling things in the name of the lord and having them come to pass second let's examine brother branham quotes about joseph as we examine brother branham's quotes about joseph you can see none of the quotes ever were spoken with thus saith the lord brother brahm told us to be careful how we listened to him separating the human side from the prophetic side as he said in he cares do you care he said i've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to there's so much of it it's just the human side but always if there's something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the lord even divisions or anything here's william branham's quotes that seem to say joseph is a prophet but there is no thus saith the lord spoken god when my days are done i'd like to see little joseph be a man that i could place this bible in his hand because the day of his dedication he spoke said joseph dowd a prophet i pray god that you let a double portion of spirit on my boy [Applause] yes [Applause] make sure [Applause] notice in this enticing spirits quote brother branham uses the word may which is not thus saith the lord while william branham seems certain joseph is a prophet in these two quotes a third quote shows he's not certain because he says that's my prayer anyhow and i believe it'll be some day notice i believe and not thus saith the lord when i dedicate him to the lord the morning there's many little babies standing i had mothers with him along the altar when i picked up joseph in my arms not thinking of what i'm saying i said joseph my son thou art a prophet that's my prayer anyhow i believe it will be god will take everything that he ever give me a double times devil and put on that boy that will not leave he'll take my place there's a lot to examine in this quote first joseph branham as a prophet was not thus saith the lord it was only a father's hopeful prayer this means the other quotes where brother branham said the lord made joseph branham a prophet were just his hopes william branham was human and not everything he said and thought and hoped for was from the lord a clear example is a dream a sister had about brother branham dying from gunshot brother branham repeated the dream and the dream said the holy spirit said it would happen later but we know he died from injuries sustained during a car accident and not from being shot by the false church system [Applause] sometimes i'm getting out of my car going in they fired me but so then the spirit said not this time but it'll come later god forbid that i compromise on anything second this quote says joseph branham will do four times everything william branham did double it times double friends do you realize the ramifications of this statement if joseph is going to do double times double as brother branham said he needs to hurry for he's never done one discernment prayer line like his daddy he'll have to make 28 trips around the world too he'll need to speak 28 squirrels in existence as well since brother branham spoke seven he'll need to win about eight million souls to christ since brother branham said he was in his second million of winning souls to christ third brother branham said joseph was going to take his place but this again must have been his personal hope and opinion because william branham said the same thing about his daughter rebecca and it was related to her seeing visions [Music] who i believe is going to maybe take my place one day she's seen her first vision just recently and she's a very tinder-hearted little thing friends did rebecca branham take william branham's place in any capacity concerning visions the honest answer is no rebecca branham did not minister to thousands through vision like brother branham nor did she have a gift of discernment in public prayer lines nor prophesy publicly with thus saith the lord the key words are i believe is going to maybe these words of i believe and maybe were just a father's hopes for his children both rebecca and at least thus far joseph i'd also like to show brother branham had the same hopes for his son billy paul for he said he hoped that maybe by prayer billy paul would be a full prophet in 1951. but eight years later in 1959 william branham observed billy paul wasn't called to preach so again all of brother branham's hopes for billy paul rebecca and joseph to take his place as a prophet or by seeing visions were not thus saith the lord they were only his human fatherly hopes and then trying to keep myself from sin at that time as much as i knew how i thought maybe god would let my children uh come in to the blessing the full blessing and maybe my little boy would fully be a prophet from god his mother died when he was just 18 months old and they've been father and mother both to him but he seems like he doesn't have a call to be a preacher he's bashful backward and so forth a whole lot like his mother's shy thirdly concerns related to joseph and billy paul branham humbly i have the following five concerns connected to the ministries of brother branham's sons joseph and billy paul first i believe joseph has taught and will not repent of at least through my attempts to help him his numerous false doctrines regarding the tapes as the absolute revelation 22 16 saying jesus said to play the tapes and limit preachers a mandate that preachers got to play the tapes and limit their preaching the tapes are the token and the tape boys are the true fivefold ministry and to unquestionably believe every word on brother branham's tapes and believing every word on brother branham's tapes is thus saith the lord among others second i'm concerned about joseph branham's name-calling of those who disagree with him who are actually staying with his father's quotes as joseph said they are demases and make-believers joseph said and i quote when you shut that prophet out of the pulpit and say that's not a live ministry i've got something to tell you demas demas i know i'm going to get it for that but i'm not against nothing but i'm for this word i'm for this message and i'm for this prophet end quote concerning believers make believers and unbelievers joseph said and i quote you the believer you know this message is the truth you know playing the tapes is the truth that's the believer the make believer said man i don't know i don't know if playing the tapes is really right or not it it could be i don't know my pastor says if i play tapes in church if we listen to them i'm just a lazy pastor that's the make believer that's the make believer it's the word it's the word that's that's one she don't know end quote friends it seems joseph thinks any pastor who doesn't play tapes is a make-believer yet his father never taught that for every false teaching of joseph branham there are no quotes of his father to back them up william branham actually taught the opposite and highly esteemed men who preached life and rightly divided the word of truth the most important thing in the name is a good god-sent preacher i admire them and their gift is far beyond anything can be done in anything else as a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of god the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister which is a which was the new testament modern-day prophet a preacher thirdly joseph seems to believe he's like joseph from egypt in the old testament brother branham never taught that though in the 2001 here i stand article brother joseph wrote and i quote you might be eating stolen bread my friend but is not because there is a famine among the bride or because i have scheme to keep food from your table as someone have you to believe the food has been stored up why should the bride be starving the granaries are stocked food is available in 45 languages end quote this interpretation is wrong because brother branham taught the old testament joseph typed jesus not his son joseph the church age book says now let us examine the life of joseph while he was in egypt for it is here we see him as the perfect type of christ another reason it's wrong is because the old testament joseph's wife was never starving for food like joseph branham said about jesus's bride joseph branham's types all fail the correct types are joseph's wife asanath was always in the palace with him typing the gentile bride and she was never starving egypt is correctly tied to the world running to and fro around the world searching for food fulfilling the prophecy of amos 8 11 and 12. joseph's nearly starving brethren are correctly typed as the 144 000 jewish remnant fourth i'm greatly concerned and saddened by billy paul's false beliefs regarding his daddy's corporal body in tulsa oklahoma billy paul said and i quote and he god sent a message through a prophet that was infallible word of the living god no mistakes no private interpretation i don't worship the man william branham but i glorify the god that was in the man william branham he william branham lived like jesus but his name was william branham the only difference is the corporal body and anything that don't believe that is the seed of discrepancy end quote there's at least three false doctrines here one brother branham was not infallible brother branham said it was tommy rot to make him infallible as this following quote suggests by the way i have a letter here that uh that just come in the mail as billy picked it up a while ago that some brethren are in michigan and this comes from the ministerial association it's got a lot of things that's what gets things grouped up you see that they're claiming here that some brethren up there that said that i sent them up there and they're preaching that man should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that i am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and over some of the office things you've ever heard and the ministerial association got a hold of it and they're writing me a letter about and um but i sent them up there and it's causing a lot of confusion and some of them prophesying and saying that one man should leave this wife and go marry that one this church knows that we don't stand for no such tommy rod is that the only times brother branham was infallible was when he spoke with thus saith the lord second the statement i don't worship the man but i glorify the god that was in the man was never taught by brother branham brother branham never said in his campaigns glorify the god that is in me this seems to be a step towards idolatry brother branham did the opposite he pointed people away from himself the messenger and to the message the person of jesus christ who is the revelation of the word of god lord i love them and i offer my prayer that they will look to you lord may they look away from this mortal play of a servant may they look to him who is the omnipotent who is and we know lord that we are finite no matter who we are we're still mortal but not the messenger but the message granted lord that's where we point to jesus christ the son of god grant that he'll be so real to everyone here today even to the little children that he'll become the absolute of the entire congregation we asked in jesus name amen i'm only telling you the truth i don't let it pass by you i'm not claiming i'm nothing i'm your brother don't you pay attention to a messenger you watch the message don't watch the messenger god will take it away from him he'll share his glory with nobody right don't you watch the messenger watch the message may you always bear that in mind to be a gem in the crown of jesus christ paul said to the church you are you are the jewels the gems of his crown we want to be the gems of the crown of jesus christ we don't want never put a man in it you forget anything about me i am your brother a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth i send out to be humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all but the grace of god has left my poor dimming eyes look beyond the curtain of power and i see those [Music] third it's utter false doctrine to say the only difference between jesus and brother branham was the corporal body and anyone who don't believe that is the seed of discrepancy friends first thessalonians 5 says man is made up of three parts body human spirit or mind and the soul brother branham was not like jesus in the human spirit or mind or the soul jesus soul was never dead in sins like brother branham's soul as saint paul teach we were all dead in sins and trespasses brother branham's mind committed many sins yet jesus was tempted in his mind but never sinned so you can't say brother branham's mind and soul was exactly the same as jesus's that's simply not true so i would say it's the seed of discrepancy to propagate the teaching that brother branham was exactly like jesus except the corporal body fifth i'm concerned the branham tabernacle services continually invite their pastor brother william branham to preach even though he's dead this is obviously very very wrong william branham never told anyone to do this and even said i will not always be your pastor in 1964. i know it's been long and hot but people we won't always be standing here i won't always be your pastor sixth and finally i'm concerned that followers of branham tabernacle either forget or refuse to answer my point-blank simple questions that demonstrate not every word brother branham said was infallible here's four examples did america get totally annihilated before 1977 with only tree stumps left and then there will come a total annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out and that i predict now this is not the lord saying this the other about the woman in his is the lord but i predicted in 19 and 30 33 that the world would be total annihilation before 77. so i didn't know then that they had something that could annihilate it like they got now but i seen the nation in total annihilation just stumps and trees and things like that so it's on its road is the white horse rider of the first seal the holy spirit as brother branham taught in 1961 or the antichrist spirit as he taught in 1963 the sixth chapter deals with the with the white horse which was the holy spirit went forth conquering the conqueror then come the pale horse death and hell followed it and each one of those riders on the horses a white horse rider went out they with his mighty in his conquering power he's a great fellow and he's conquering power you only tell who he is he's the antichrist that's exactly what he is who is the real promise joseph is it billy paul as brother branham said in 1951 or joseph branham as brother branham taught in 1958 my little boy which is with us now soon be 16 years old he was you seemed to be a good boy he reminded him his very lovely little fella but i talked to him about being baptized and making his public confession of christ he lived good in everything little fella but about a week after that i walked into the house and he'd come without me asking anything said daddy i want to be a christian i want to serve the lord my joseph was right with me i didn't know it a little baby that i thought would be joseph a little girl and i call her sarah i'm thankful for her i love her with all my heart the little boy many of you know the story of little joseph the lord showed him to me six years before he was come to the earth and he promised me a boy because i liked joseph so well did rebecca marry a bride a woman as brother branham said in 1958 or a bridegroom as he said in and that 1963 beast that she was water was the one who passed her 205 eliza when he came to get better rebecca she mounted her up on a camel the very camel she watered and she rolled this camel to meet her unseen bridegroom does the third person of the trinity dwell in our hearts as brother branham taught in 1952 or does the one and only person of the godhead the holy spirit dwell in our hearts as he taught in 1963 truly we're not much in this world we're looked down upon but god we believe we're accepted in christ jesus and he in return us give us the holy ghost we love him that great first person of the trinity who burns through our hearts and we love him his death didn't stop him no so he returned again not a third person but the same person [Music] jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the token that's the silence friends there are many many more contradicting quotes from brother branham that prove not every word he spoke was infallible he was human and grew in his understanding friends i sent one of these questions to our precious brother joseph does the third person of the trinity dwell in our hearts as brother branham taught in 1952 and i heard back from him on september 17 2020 and his answer was this and i quote dear brother smith i believe every word he spoke on the tapes for it is the revelation of jesus christ hebrews 13 8 end quote so see friends brother joseph and his friends at the branham tabernacle cannot give us answers about these questions their false doctrine has trapped them in a corner and all they can say is that i believe every word he said was thus saith the lord this helps us to learn a few things our precious brothers either don't have a preaching gift to rightly divide the word of truth or their babes in christ through a lack of exercising the preaching gift of discernment according to hebrews 5 verses 12 through 14. it also tells us the tape boys are not in the fivefold ministry because they cannot rightly divide the word of truth regarding my four simple questions above because they're trapped by the deity spirit into thinking everything is thus saith the lord and there are no contradictions in any word brother branham spoke on tape yet a holy ghost-filled preacher can rightly divide the truth on these questions and here's the answers regarding 1977 the united states was not annihilated before 1977 it was brother branham's human prediction that didn't come to pass yet he's still a genuine prophet because he didn't make that prediction in the name of the lord regarding the identity of the white horse rider it's the antichrist spirit as brother random taught in 1963 because he taught that with the authority of thus saith the lord regarding the promise joseph billy paul was not the promised joseph as brother random taught in 1951 but his youngest son was brother branham was simply trying to interpret god's promised word using his human thinking but god corrected him regarding rebecca she didn't marry a wife as brother branham mistakenly said it was a slip of the mind and tongue he meant to say bridegroom but mistakenly said rebecca married a bride regarding the third person of the trinity dwelling in believers hearts brother branham grew in revelation and by 1963 he knew god was only one person not three and he actually spoke it with thus saith the lord in 1961 so his belief in three persons was wrong and god corrected him in closing with broadly kindness i say again i love brother joseph and billy paul but i believe they are simply wrong on these important subjects my attempts to correct them privately didn't work but i will keep praying for them to open their hearts to god's truth i felt led of the holy ghost to make this video to help them speak the truth on these subjects for the truth will make them free and all the people they influence i hope this video is a blessing my prayers that it would help those who are confused about the teachings coming out of the branham tabernacle i know god will direct this video the word of god that's on it to the hearts that are hungering and thirsting for jesus righteousness please contact me with any questions concerns or testimonies about this video god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
