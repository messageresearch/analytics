TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I I dreamed about a month after that that I was standing one day and I was watching the great uh a time that not the Judgment now I don't believe the church ever comes to the I mean the bride goes to a judgment but I was there when the crowns was being given out greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about the Judgment seat of Christ so by the grace of God we'll do that with the Holy scriptures and of course quotations from God's Prophet William Mariam brandham hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Miriam brandham so let's start with the viewer's question I'll read it for you it says brother I've looked through all your videos I was looking for the Judgment seat of Christ I don't fully understand it it seems contradictory on one hand we have been redeemed and washed Etc and then on the other hand we have to give an account of Deeds Done in the body it's like two puzzle pieces that won't click into place for me do you have a video on it or can you make one it would be much appreciated I need peace about it I've heard several interpretations on it but I don't have a grasp on it thank you this is a wonderful question and I don't have any videos on it that are extensively or exclusively just a about this topic so that's why I appreciated this question and I'll do my best here to teach on the Judgment seat of Christ I'll begin with a few scriptures here let's start off with Romans 1410 through1 13 St Paul's talking about Christian Liberties and how we are not to judge Believers as long as they're living in a way that doesn't break the word of God or cause them to sin in verse 10 of Romans 14 it says but why Dost thou judge thy brother or why Dost thou said it not thy brother for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ for it is written as I live sayith the Lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way so the first verse we have tells us that we should not judge our brother or sister because each one of us have to give an account of ourselves to God and notice we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ so it's clear everyone will stand before Christ to be judged by him to give an account of ourselves to God so we all stand individually before the Lord Jesus Christ to give an account of ourselves and even as a preacher when the preachers stand before the Lord according to Hebrews 13:17 the Bible says to obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch over your souls as they that must give account account so every individual gives an account of themselves before God and then the preachers have to give an account of their churches and the Bible says that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so this verse inspires both preachers and every member of the body of Christ non- preachers to live a Godly life because the preachers will give an account of their congregation as a witness or a testimony either with Joy about the members or with grief so we can see all of us stand before the Judgment seat of Christ but it's in a different order we see this because the resurrections are in a different order there's two resurrections there's the first resurrection which is the rapture and then there's the second Resurrection which is the resurrection unto the white Throne judgment so let's read that it's 1 Corinthians 1522 and 23 for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the first fruits afterwards they that are Christ at his coming so I want to show this visual here this shows the two resurrections you have the first resurrection which is at the Rapture the pre-tribulation Rapture according to John 5:24 Revelation 20 4-6 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 this is the resurrection for the living and dead wise virgin Christians and it's the resurrection unto life this is a small Resurrection in comparison to the second Resurrection Resurrection which is for all the unbelievers and the foolish virgin Christians this is the resurrection unto the white Throne judgment according to John 5:28-29 Matthew 25 31-46 and Revelation 20: 11 through 15 and I do have a video about this it's called two resurrections for two kinds of Christians I'll leave a link to that in the description by the grace of God now let's look at the next verse 2 Corinthians 59-11 wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad so to encourage the viewer who have this question we are judged for the good that we've done all of our bad is Forgiven as we'll see in some future scriptures here so the Judgment seat of Christ for the Holy Ghost filed Christian it's the time to receive the reward for for the good we have done so it's the judgment to get the reward for serving the lord Jesus Christ and of course that's not why we serve God to get rewards we serve God for the gratitude that we have because he saved us from our sins by his amazing grace through the blood of Jesus Christ I love these words of the Lord Jesus Christ brother brand quoted these often John 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that has sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come come into condemnation but has passed from Death unto life so this verse tells us when we stand before the Judgment seat of Christ as Believers it's not judgment into condemnation it's judgment into reward so every Born Again Holy Ghost filed Christian can Rejoice they've already passed from condemnation they've already passed from Death unto life they will not come into the condemnation we get more of this truth in Romans 8 32-35 he that spared not his son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth so the Bible's plain God justifies us he declares us righteous as we wish to be according to the Greek and so God doesn't lay any charge to his elect his chosen his called so when we stand before the Judgment seat of Christ it's not to be charged with any wrong it's to be judged and assessed for reward I love verse 34 it says who is he that condemneth so again we see that same type of word condemn no condemnation to Christians verse 34 said who is he that condem it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ so we see two witnesses Jesus said we won't come into condemnation Paul said there's no one that can condemn the bride the real Holy Ghost filled Saints because God has already Justified her there's two parables in Matthew 25 and they give us an insight into this judgment seat of Christ for the believer Matthew 2521 his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord so this verse tells us what the Judgment seat of Christ will be like we'll give an account of what we've done with what God has given us then the Lord will call us faithful and tell us to enter into the joy of the Lord so just like this Parable says if you're given five talents you want to invest in them and get 10 if you're given two you want to invest in them double them and get four the sinful thing to do is bury your talent in the earth and not invest your life into the Gospel of Jesus Christ then of course we see the white Throne judgment Matthew 2533 34 now I believe this is the foolish virgin but in verse 33 it says and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats in the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed and my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world so Matthew 25:21 I believe that's the bride the wise virgin they enter into the joys of the Lord but the foolish virgin they enter into the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world at the white Throne judgment so we can see both judgments for the wise virgin and the foolish virgin are joyful for the wise virgin he said enter into the joy of the Lord the wise virgin is called good and faithful servant and here even the foolish virgin is called blessed of the father and they're given a kingdom that was prepared for them from the foundation of the world one more verse I want to read is 1 John 4:17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in that day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world so the Bible tells us we can have perfect love and this perfect love gives us boldness for that time that we stand at the Judgment seat of Christ because we are as he is in other words Christ is in us the hope of glory as Colossians 1 verses 26 and 27 tell us next I'm going to show this visual of the three wedding events for the Bride of Jesus Christ brother brandom talks about this on a few occasions beginning with the Rapture the pre-tribulation Rapture is the beginning of this wedding process brother Bram says when the dead in Christ and the living Saints are meeting in the air that's the wedding ceremony brother Ram said we're going to be married in the sky so the wedding ceremony is the meeting in the air then we go to the marriage supper of the Lamb that's the second event the wedding reception and then at the battle of Armageddon Jesus will bring his bride with him he'll defeat all of his foes burn the Earth with fire and then he'll physically set his foot down down on the earth for the third wedding event which is the Thousand-Year Millennium or the wedding honeymoon so again the three steps are the wedding ceremony the meeting in the air the marriage supper the lamb the reception and the third is the honeymoon back on the earth in the Millennium now the church now is engaged to Christ for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the Lamb so we see that the church is now engaged like a man engaged to his wife what does he do while they're engaged he is just bestowing all kinds of things sent in her presence making her feel good well that's what Christ is doing to his church he's sending us gifts of the Spirit how can you be engaged then when you're denying these gifts exist it's the very love tokens it's God's token to the church Jesus said so these signs shall follow them that believe help us Lord if there's one here that's called to this wedding supper of the Lamb this Thousand Years the Millennium rain and to then enter into the city after the honeymoon is over the Millennium is merely the honeymoon then she the bride takes his bridegroom takes his bride home it's hers her bridegroom his bride oh he's gone to prepare a house since he's become engaged may we be true to him who is the word for he is the word you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the skies and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there put your name on the book what a Thanksgiving hallelujah praise our God h closing I might say this we next I want to look a little closer at the marriage supper of the Lamb to give you some scripture on that so here's a visual I'm calling it The judgment seat of Christ for the bride remember there's a judgment seat of Christ for the foolish virgin I showed that earlier that was the second Resurrection on the two resurrections visual so here at the marriage supper of the Lamb there's at least three things that are happening while the Bride of Jesus Christ is up in heaven at the wedding reception we we'd call it now the foolish virgin and everyone else on the earth the unbelievers are going through the 7year Great Tribulation period but up in heaven at the marriage supper of the Lamb there's at least three things taking place first there's a presentation of the Bride according to 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul said he was going to present the Corinthians as a Chase virgin to Christ brother BM says this in the church age book that the church age messenger for each age has a special duty to present the bride from each Church age to the Lord Jesus second rewards will be given out according to 2 Corinthians 510 we read that earlier where Paul said everyone all the wise virgins will receive the good that they've done in this body and again that's the statement where Jesus said in Matthew 2521 enter into the joys of the Lord you've been Faithful over few I'm making you ruler over much of course that rulership is future tense for the Thousand-Year Millennial Reign then third and finally it's seems like there is a communion ceremony at the marriage supper of the Lamb according to Genesis 14:18 after Abraham won the battle in Genesis 14 he met MDC and they had Bread and Wine they had a communion ceremony brother random uses this scripture many times to talk about after the battle of overcoming leoda will have communion with the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven and then we also see that in Matthew 2629 right after Jesus ordained the Lord's Supper on the last night before his arrest death burial and Resurrection Jesus said I won't drink of the vine again until I drink it a new with you in my father's Kingdom now we believe the father's Kingdom would be at the marriage supper of the Lamb then we believe Jesus's Throne or Kingdom would be the Thousand-Year Millennial Reign but mzd after his child Abraham had won the victory MDC met him and gave him wine and bread amen showing that after this Earthly battle is over we will meet him in the heavens and take the communion again it'll be the wedding supper amen I will not drink the more the vine or eat the fruit until I eat it and drink it with you and new in my father's kingdom is that right we may never meet another breakfast but there's one thing sure we'll go to meet at a supper someday that's a wedding supper that great table is stretched across the skies reaching from Sky to Sky we look across the table one to another there's bound to be a little tear dropped from our cheeks as we think as we shake each other's hands say I remember the Salem meeting here's brother so and so he is the one to come in at that time this and down here then the king and his Beauty will walk out its white robes wipe all tears away from our eyes they don't cry children it's all over enter into the joys of the Lord has been prepared for you since the foundation of the world and finally I want to play a quote from God's Prophet brother Brenham from The Sixth Seal he tells a dream and he said this is the first time he's ever told it publicly he was wondering where his first wife hope and his second wife ma would be placed in heaven which wife would he be with sister M was having a hard time understanding that and he tells a story and again and again he says it's just a dream so it's not a thus sayith the Lord but he had a dream he was there in heaven with the Lord Jesus and individuals were being called up to stand before Christ and receive their reward he talks about brother Neville going up and then his name was called and right before he gets to the steps to stand before the Lord hope is there and meat is there and then they go up to stand before the Lord together when brother R woke up he cried and he said oh God I hope that comes like that so again this is just a hopeful dream brother bandam had he did not say it was thus sayi the Lord seems very scriptural though so if this dream was scriptural it would be the rewards event which is one of those three events that would take place at the marriage supper of the Lamb you had presentation rewards and communion and again there is some uncertainty about the order of these events it seems like from the dream that maybe rewards would be given first the members would first enter into the joys of the Lord and then maybe the broad would be presented next and then communion would be last I don't know I'm just giving my simple thoughts on that I could be wrong so let's listen to the quote from God's Prophet brother BR the six seal I want tell you a little thing happened this was a dream I was asleep and I've never told this publicly before I told it to a couple of people but never publicly before as I know I I dreamed about a month after that that I was standing one day and I was watching the great uh a Time that not the Judgment now I don't believe the church ever comes to the I mean the bride goes to a judgment but I was there when the crowns is being given out see and the great great big Throne set up here and Jesus and the recording Angel and all was standing there and there was a stair steps like come down this way of white Ivory run down a circle made a panoramic like this and went out so all this great host stand out there could see what was happening and I'd stand back over way back to one side and I just stand there never idea I had to walk in steps I stand there I'd see a recording Angel call a certain name and I know recognize that name I look and way back out there here come the brother walking or the sister walk up you like that the recording angel stand there with the sight of Christ Just a Dream now and it's watching and their name was on there it was found in the Book of Life he'd look out over them and says it was well done my good and faithful servant I enter in I look back where he's going there was a new world and the joys and that enter into the joys of the Lord has been has been for yours since the foundation of the world see and Oh I thought they go through there and meeting one another and just rejoicing and going over mountains and great big places oh is that where I go Glory Hallelujah just jumping up down then I hear another name called I think oh I know him I know him I there there he goes there watching enter into the joys of the Lord my good oh I say praise God praise God you say pra like they say arm and Neville see and then I I old brother there he is he here he comes

wonderful thing don't miss it don't miss it by the grace of God do all you can do and that'll be up to God to take care of the rest of it then I I [Music] all let's sing it again with all in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I thought this was an excellent question I've never addressed it before so I appreciate uh looks like our sister asking this question I hope these scriptures helpful no doubt there's many many more verses but I just wanted to get out a short quick video to answer the question hopefully it brings peace to our sister's heart and other Hearts as well by the grace of God based upon the comments we may do a part two on this as well we'll kind of see how that goes this study is such a blessing because it reminds us if we have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ we will not come into condemnation we will not be judged to be condemned we'll judge to be rewarded by the grace of God all because because of the blood of Jesus Christ the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and this subject always reminds me of 1 Corinthians 15:57 and 58 but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ we get the victory through Christ being in us that's the hope of the New Covenant Christ in you the hope of glory the Holy Ghost writing his word upon the fleshly tables of our hearts therefore verse 58 my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord God is watching your labor God's seeing how steadfast you are so friends
