TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to show 14 signs that we are living in the end times i felt inspired to write down these 14 signs while writing my 2021 book and these 14 signs are in chapter 12 of that book in the chapter about the rapture and no doubt there could be more signs of the end times as well this was just a starting spot we'll begin by going through these 14 signs of the end times and then i'll discuss which prophecies that we are looking to be fulfilled now before the rapture of the bride of jesus christ based upon the bible and god's prophet brother william branham i'd like to begin these 14 signs by starting with the passage in first thessalonians 5 verses 1 through before i read that remember though that first thessalonians chapter 4 verses 13 through 18 detail the rapture as paul told us in the name of the lord that there be a shout voiced trump for the rapture to be fulfilled we believe the shout is going out right now the shout is the same midnight cry jesus parable spoke about in matthew 25 verses 1 through 13. it is the shout to make ourselves ready for the coming of the lord jesus christ that shout was given to us through god's prophet brother william marin branham and this shout is currently still going around the world in fact every nation needs to hear the revelation that god gave to brother branham the bible revelations that the mystery of god is finished according to revelation 10 7 and matthew 24 verse 14 which says and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness unto all nations and then shall the end come so we believe god is using the internet to upspread the shout the message god gave to william branham to all nations but of course he's also sending living preachers missionaries to all nations and we should be praying that god will send these laborers into the harvest so please join me in prayer for god to send more missionaries around the world despite the covet lockdowns god's word will prevail we have to be patient as james chapter 5 says be patient unto the coming of the lord so let's read first thessalonians 5 1-3 but as of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape so the apostle paul describes the times and seasons of the rapture with these first two descriptions first sinners will be unaware of the rapture just as drunken sleeping robbery victims are caught off guard by a nighttime thief jesus teaches this same idea when he likens the day of the lord as the days of noah in which the lost kept eating drinking and marrying right up until the flood came and took them all away paul compares the sinners to sleeping drunks the second sign is that paul proclaims the world's mantra will be peace and safety at the time of christ's sudden rapture event it's striking to imagine how contrary the thoughts and plans of sinners will be compared to those of god as god is planning for war armageddon and destruction with earth's sinless holy restoration in mind the world is planning in vain for world peace and safety so we believe the end time conditions today that we see around the world all the unrest violence destruction will continue to increase so much so that the world's mantra will be we want peace and safety you may have seen this recently in the news in december 2021 the united nations headquarters in new york unveiled a statue they called the guardian for international peace and security of course peace and security should remind us of the mantra of peace and safety this beast was a combination of daniel 7 verse 3 and 4 and revelation 3 verse 2 it was like a leopard feet as the feet of a bear mouth as the mouth of a lion and had eagle's wings so no doubt this mantra for peace and safety is a cry from the people because of luke 21 verse 26 where jesus said men's hearts will be failing them for fear so because this great spirit of fear is coming upon the earth the people of the earth will be crying out for peace and safety but real christians currently find real peace and safety in the anointing of the holy ghost in their souls a third proof is found in second peter 3 verses 3 and 4. scoffers will be mocking jesus's second coming the fourth sign is the conditions of noah's time will be repeated which is violence lust-based marriages and continually evil thoughts according to luke 17 verses 26-30 and genesis 6 verses 1-13 notice again jesus christ said the conditions of noah's time will repeat at the time of his second coming the fourth sign is that sodomite conditions of lots time will be repeated based upon jesus's own words again in luke 17 verses 28 through 30. and of course this explains the rise of homosexuality transgenderism as a repeat of the sodomite conditions from the days of lot the sixth sign is evil men and deceivers will grow more evil with greater deceptions according to 2 timothy 3 verse 1-13 false prophets coming in the name of jesus have never been more deceptive and their deceptions will grow closer and closer to being the truth but yet they'll be lies so the true believer will need the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit of god in them to raise up a standard against the flood of deception and false prophecies that satan is pushing upon the people of god but do not fear we will overcome by the grace of god for the holy spirit is here to rightly divide the word of truth as he promised to guide us into all truth by his spirit the seventh sign is that many churches will commit a great falling away from god's truth according to second thessalonians two verse three we're seeing this today especially around the message churches that once recognized the bible truths that god gave to his prophet william branham in order to fall away from the truth you've got to be around the truth you would have had to spend time around the true teachings of the bible and the truest teachings were given by god to brother william branham with thus saith the lord so we can expect more people to fall away as the coming of the lord jesus nears an eighth sign is that few will have genuine faith expressed through regular prayer according to luke 18 verses 1 through 8. remember friends jesus said watch and pray for his coming and in this parable jesus asked shall i find faith on the earth when i return in its context it's talking about a prayer life that continually asks seeks and knocks in prayer to god almighty so our prayer lives need to continue daily and we need to keep asking god to fulfill his word and of course he will in his time in season since we're the seed of abraham we'll have faith like abraham will be able to wait 25 years or more for god to bring his promises to pass a ninth sign is that pestilences and earthquakes will increase as sorrows before the tribulation this is found in matthew 24 verses 7 and 8. these scriptures became much more real in the year 2020 as the world became overcome with fear over the coronavirus now of course there have been other viruses before this like the swine flu but the coronavirus was the latest pestilence to hit the earth and for some of us it was the first major pestilence in our lifetime but the coming of the coronavirus and the increase of earthquakes around the world only point us back to the scripture and encourage us that this was already foretold and these are the beginning of sorrows but jesus said he left his peace with us not the peace of the world but the peace of the holy spirit so despite these trials despite these sorrows we can serve god with thanksgiving as philippians 4 says we can make our request known unto god and then the peace that passes all understanding will keep our hearts and minds in christ jesus the tenth sign is that men will be lovers of themselves more than lovers of god and they will be covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent which means having no self-control fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded and having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof according to second timothy 3 verses 1-7 the 11th sign is that the new testament gospel will have been preached to all the world matthew 24 14. of course we mentioned this earlier but is our duty as holy ghost filled christians to continue to spread the gospel around the world yes we can use the internet but living preachers need to go to all nations and preach the gospel which is a fulfillment of revelation 10 verses 8 through 11 where john as a type of the bride eats the book and then prophesies again to peoples multitudes nations and tongues the 12th sign is new laws will stop true churches from preaching through unified efforts of false churches and politicians the us government will adopt new laws to stop true churches from preaching and pressure them to join the evil ecumenical move but jesus will anoint believers with the latter rain and rescue them in the rapture more on this sign a little later the 13th sign is israelis will be physically returning to live in the holy land and seeking to rebuild a new temple according to deuteronomy 30 verses 1 through 10 luke 21 24 and revelation 11 verses 1 and 2. god's prophet taught us that israel was god's timepiece so that's why we're constantly watching the news about israel to hear about updates regarding her freedoms and also the desire of the faithful remnant to rebuild the temple and the 14th sign is nominal churches will be in a laodicean lukewarm condition concerned with riches and goods and they'll have no need of more truth and unwilling to repent according to revelation 3 verses 15 through 19. so most churches fall under this category because they do not want more truth of the bible most churches are interested more in getting more members and the way to do that is to make the church more worldly and to make sins no longer sins but the bible says it's an abomination to call that which is evil good but most mega churches with famous pastors do exactly that they take something evil like adultery or homosexuality and they say it's okay it's good that god still loves those people even if they won't repent but we know jesus said if you love me keep my commands if you love jesus you'll repent of adultery or repent of being a homosexual and you'll learn to serve jesus in holiness and it's possible through the anointing of his holy spirit what we're looking for now as the rapture nears what are holy ghost-filled christians looking for right now we're looking for all these 14 signs to continue and we know they will but the main one that i watch for and encourage my church to watch for are the signs related to the 12th sign which was the united states government uniting with christian churches in order to change laws friends the reason we emphasize this sign the 12th sign more than others is because because we don't know if the great california earthquake will be before the rapture or after it looks like according to the book of revelation it'll be after the rapture but we don't know for sure also we don't know if the third jewish temple will be built before the rapture or after the rapture we don't know if the seventh vision of the bomb exploding united states will be before the rapture or after the rapture god's prophet told us to watch the purple curtain which is the catholic church that's communism nazism and fascism watch russia but that is not the main one to watch listen god says the lord repent our prejudice in the name of the lord there is one called the iron curtain which will be russia what's red china that'll be the bamboo curtain they're horrible but what's that purple curtain that's rising in the united states and over the world the roman empire the cruelest of all of them remember in the name of the lord get away from it come away from anything that's attached to us please to the rocks although the coming of the lord is at hand we need a confidence i need a conference to talk these things over with god the churches that they're in and the catholic church is greatly influencing every nation but especially the united states for the united states is seen in revelation chapter 13 verses 11 through 18 verses 1 through 10 and revelation 13 was imperial rome turning into papal rome when imperial rome fell the bible said it was wounded unto death but was given new life in papal rome when constantine united church and state but verses 11 through 18 is papal rome infiltrating the united states government especially since the election of the first catholic president john f kennedy in 1960 but based upon these scriptures and quotes we believe it's helpful to watch both israel and the united states lord willing we might see israel god's timepiece begin building their temple before the rapture and then we would know the coming of the two prophets during the great tribulation is very near and of course the squeeze would take place before that also we might see the government of the united states unite with the world council of churches or another church council and begin changing laws to outlaw true holy ghost worship and then again we would know the time of the squeeze is upon us in the church age book brother branham said the temptation will come as follows the ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling christ's prayer that we all might be one becomes so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this council little groups will lose charters privileges etc until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people also in the church age book brother branham said i believe according to revelation 13 verse 16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or the forehead of permission to be preached be granted denominations will take the mark or be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great harlot so putting these two quotes together once the laws change the united states that we know the squeeze time or the time of pressure will come down upon the bride she'll be forced to stop preaching publicly but she'll still have a ministry she'll still be able to minister to people through small private gatherings but not public gatherings and then we believe it's at that time during the squeeze that the prophesied latter reign which is thus saith the lord will fall upon god's true bride and with that anointing the bride will finish the great commission no one knows how long that anointing will last but brother branham makes it seem like god is going to do great supernatural things through his bride during the time of the squeeze as he spoke and looked away to jesus in 1963. so now i am going to say something to you now that i haven't said all along that is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long or at least many years four or five years or maybe longer the third pull has now been vindicated and i'm sure you all know what it is now remember it there'll never be an impersonation of that because it can't be it cannot be now it's inexistent and i have i am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything to be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power [Applause] it's tightening and then when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you're pressed out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull down and it'll be absolutely to the total lost but it it will be for the bride in the church and then jesus christ will come to rapture his holy ghost-filled bride off the earth then when the church goes up satan will come down and reveal himself in the antichrist which we believe will be a pope of rome in closing hope this video has been a blessing where you're able to see some of the end times signs that show us we're living in the last days now of course friends there could be more signs this was just a list i made last year when i finished writing my book again our desire should be to fulfill what jesus told us to do watch and pray for a second coming finishing first thessalonians 5 we must watch and pray because we're the children of the day we're not children of the darkness the rapture will not overtake us as a thief we will see it coming because we'll be watching these signs that are clearly taught in the bible and as paul said will have on the full armor of god as he said putting on the breastplate of faith and love and foreign helmet the hope of salvation and i'll leave you with first thessalonians 5 9 for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ the true bride of jesus christ will not experience the wrath of the tribulation period may each one of us put on the full armor of god today finish the great commission and watch him pray until jesus comes if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
