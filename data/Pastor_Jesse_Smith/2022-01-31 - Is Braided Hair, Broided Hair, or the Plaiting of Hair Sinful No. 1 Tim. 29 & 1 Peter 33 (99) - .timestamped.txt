[0:02] no not braiding hair not today braided
[0:04] hair is pretty
[0:05] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:10] of the lord jesus christ
[0:12] is braided hair
[0:14] or broided hair or the plating of hair
[0:17] sinful
[0:19] the answer is no this may be surprising
[0:21] to some who reference both first timothy
[0:25] 2 verse 9 and first peter 3 verse 3
[0:29] but a careful reading of these
[0:30] scriptures in context along with
[0:33] comparison to other hair
[0:35] and gold and jewelry scriptures
[0:37] show the braiding style of hair is not
[0:39] sinful as long as the cost for the
[0:42] styling is not excessive just like the
[0:45] wearing of gold and jewelries acceptable
[0:48] as long as the cost of the gold or
[0:50] jewelry is not excessive
[0:52] let's begin by reading both first
[0:54] timothy 2 verse 9 and first peter 3
[0:57] verse 3.
[0:59] first timothy 2 verse 9 and 10 says in
[1:01] like manner also that women adorn
[1:03] themselves in modest apparel with
[1:06] shame-faceness and sobriety not with
[1:08] broided hair or gold or pearls or costly
[1:12] array but which becometh women
[1:14] professing godliness with good works
[1:18] first peter 3
[1:20] verses 3 and 4 say who's adorning let it
[1:23] not be that outward adorning or plating
[1:25] the hair
[1:26] and of wearing of gold or of putting on
[1:29] of apparel but let it be the hidden man
[1:31] of the heart in that which is not
[1:33] corruptable even the ornament of a meek
[1:36] and quiet spirit which is in the sight
[1:38] of god of great price
[1:41] i want to examine the greek meanings of
[1:43] both broided and plating
[1:46] the greek meaning of broided in 1st
[1:48] timothy 2 verse 9 is what is woven
[1:51] plated or twisted together a web plate
[1:54] braid
[1:55] braided hair
[1:57] the greek word for plating
[1:59] in 1st peter 3 verse 3 means an
[2:01] interweaving
[2:02] braiding a knot an elaborate gathering
[2:06] of one's hair into knots
[2:09] now that we can see both greek words
[2:11] essentially mean the same thing
[2:13] the context of the verses prove
[2:15] braiding hair is not a sin for two
[2:18] reasons
[2:19] the first reason is that the context
[2:21] shows pause saying only excessively
[2:24] expensive
[2:25] or luxurious hair styles
[2:27] that cost lots of money
[2:29] and very expensive jewelry like gold and
[2:32] pearls are sinful
[2:34] the proof of this is the fact
[2:36] that joseph son of jacob the patriarch
[2:38] of the 12 tribes of israel
[2:40] wore a gold necklace while in egypt
[2:43] so if you condemn all gold jewelry then
[2:45] you've got to condemn joseph for wearing
[2:48] a gold necklace but we know he's not
[2:50] condemned he's saved as he was a near
[2:53] perfect type of christ
[2:56] genesis 41 verse 42 says and pharaoh
[2:58] took off his ring from his hand and put
[3:01] it upon joseph's hand and arrayed him in
[3:04] vestures of fine linen and put a gold
[3:06] chain about his neck
[3:09] also in the new testament james said a
[3:11] man may come into the church with a gold
[3:13] ring
[3:14] james said not to show partiality to
[3:16] this rich man but he never said to
[3:18] instantly kick him out of the church
[3:20] because he had a gold ring on
[3:23] james 2 verse 2 says for if there come
[3:25] unto your assembly a man with a gold
[3:27] ring in goodly apparel and there come in
[3:30] also a poor man in vile raiment
[3:33] so i hope you can see from the context
[3:36] that wearing a gold necklace or owning a
[3:38] gold ring is not a sin
[3:40] it all depends on their cost and also
[3:42] the purpose for wearing them
[3:44] i'd like to share a real life example to
[3:46] illustrate what i'm talking about
[3:48] regarding an excessively expensive
[3:50] hairstyle
[3:52] one time a professing christian woman
[3:54] told me she thought it was fine for a
[3:56] christian woman to spend twenty thousand
[3:58] dollars on a hairstyle
[4:00] because the christian had earned the
[4:02] money and deserved to enjoy spending the
[4:05] money however she pleased
[4:07] i instantly disagreed and said twenty
[4:10] thousand dollars on one hairstyle would
[4:12] be a huge waste of money especially when
[4:14] poor saints around the world lack food
[4:16] clothing bibles message books shelter
[4:20] and more
[4:21] this woman's attitude which i believe is
[4:23] sinful is that attitude i believe paul
[4:26] is condemning in first timothy two verse
[4:28] nine and that's because paul used the
[4:30] word uncleanness in galatians five verse
[4:32] nineteen which means luxurious living
[4:36] so i believe paul is condemning
[4:37] luxurious living in first timothy two
[4:39] verse nine we're spending huge amounts
[4:42] of money on expensive hairstyles and
[4:44] jewelry which is really a waste of money
[4:47] and paul said those who live in luxury
[4:49] or uncleanness
[4:51] will not inherit the kingdom of god in
[4:53] galatians 5 verses 19 through 21 now the
[4:57] works of the flesh are manifest which
[4:59] are these adultery fornication
[5:01] uncleanness that's the word that means
[5:04] luxurious living
[5:06] lecheviousness idolatry witchcraft
[5:08] hatred variance emulation
[5:10] wrath strife seditions heresies
[5:12] endings murders drunkenness revelings
[5:16] and such like of the which i tell you
[5:18] before as i have also told you in time
[5:20] past that they which do such things
[5:23] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[5:26] the second reason is that the context
[5:28] shows paul is saying only excessively
[5:30] expensive or luxurious clothing is
[5:33] sinful and not all clothing
[5:36] if it's a sin to braid hair in first
[5:37] timothy two verse nine and first peter
[5:40] three verse three
[5:42] then it's a sin to wear gold jewelry and
[5:45] it's also a sin to put on apparel or
[5:47] clothing
[5:49] because first peter three verse three
[5:50] said or of putting on of apparel
[5:54] if it's a sin to put on clothing or
[5:56] peril everyone would be without clothing
[5:59] which would be immodest and sinful
[6:01] obviously
[6:02] so we can easily see the context is
[6:05] condemning excessively expensive
[6:07] clothing jewelry and hairstyles
[6:11] next here's a quote from brother branham
[6:12] about 1st timothy 2 verse 9
[6:15] and you can hear him say it's not a sin
[6:17] for a woman to braid her hair today in
[6:20] the quote you'll hear him say he found
[6:22] history that prostitutes
[6:24] or flappers used to braid their hair but
[6:27] i've looked and i've not been able to
[6:29] find this historical reference in any of
[6:31] the commentaries that i read
[6:33] so that is something to continue to
[6:34] search for but again brother branham
[6:36] said it is not sin to braid hair
[6:39] and said christian women today should
[6:41] look different from prostitutes and
[6:43] worldly women let's listen to the quote
[6:46] brother branham does this first timothy
[6:50] 2 9
[6:52] mean a woman cannot
[6:54] braid her hair
[6:56] does broad hair mean braided hair
[7:01] now look sister now this i'm glad that
[7:04] followed this i never fixed it there but
[7:05] it just it followed that good
[7:07] notice
[7:09] a braided hair in that day was a sign of
[7:12] a street woman
[7:14] that's what she done braided her hair
[7:16] and paul said to the christians now
[7:18] without adorning not let it be a braided
[7:21] or brought in braids the same thing to
[7:23] braid their hair because it looked like
[7:25] the rest of the world
[7:27] now you're supposed not to look like the
[7:29] world or act like the world
[7:31] see the women are supposed to be
[7:32] different there see no not braiding hair
[7:35] not today braided hair is pretty and
[7:37] it's a long waist in the fashion world
[7:39] now you see the women the way they do
[7:41] their hair today just keep your hair in
[7:44] any way just don't look like the world
[7:46] see don't look or dress like it if they
[7:48] wear shorts you wear a dress
[7:50] if they uh if they do their hair all cut
[7:52] it all off and bob it and do them
[7:56] every you you just let yours alone
[7:58] and uh the
[7:59] brady the question was does braden mean
[8:02] abroad and being braided yes that's
[8:04] right and now on the street i looked
[8:06] that up to find out years ago what the
[8:07] braided hair meant see the women
[8:10] actually the women of old they just
[8:12] pulled their hair back and tied it more
[8:14] like the ponytail today and they went
[8:16] around they had robes on like that but
[8:18] the women of the street took their hair
[8:20] and braided it all across their heads
[8:21] and wrapped it around like that and put
[8:23] flowers in it and things like that and
[8:24] that was kind of the flapper on the
[8:26] street just like you see the flapper
[8:28] today the way she dresses
[8:30] i'm saying flapper because you know i'm
[8:31] an old man so that's what this called
[8:32] them in my days
[8:34] what is they call them today i don't
[8:36] know chicks or something there so
[8:38] everyone is
[8:41] give them any kind of a name they like
[8:42] it
[8:45] in closing friends i hope this video was
[8:47] a blessing and hope it was helpful in
[8:49] this area of modesty and outward
[8:51] appearance this subject is a good
[8:53] example of how holy ghost-filled
[8:55] preachers need to rightly divide the
[8:57] word of truth
[8:58] those who misunderstand first timothy 2
[9:01] verse 9 and 1st peter 3 verse 3 are
[9:04] essentially condemning all braided hair
[9:06] all wearing of gold jewelry and also
[9:09] condemning the putting on of all apparel
[9:12] it's plain to see that what paul and
[9:14] peter are saying is that it's more
[9:16] important to spend time
[9:17] on the inward man
[9:19] developing a meek and humble christian
[9:21] spirit both in male and female but
[9:24] especially in the case of our sisters
[9:26] who have a desire to look pretty paul
[9:28] specifically tells them spend your time
[9:30] allowing for the holy spirit to create
[9:32] in you a humble and meek quiet and
[9:35] gentle spirit
[9:37] if you have any questions concerns or
[9:39] testimonies about this video please
[9:41] contact me
[9:44] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[9:46] the desire of your heart
