[1:17] surely and then after the meetings is
[1:20] all over on a Monday that was last
[1:22] meeting was supposed to be on Saturday
[1:24] and then I believe in that old Monday I
[1:27] tried to get up I was so weak I couldn't
[1:29] go through the room I sat down you know
[1:32] I'm so thankful for a god-given wife
[1:35] aren't you Brethren a real wife a real
[1:37] companion I sat down I motioned to her
[1:39] and got her over close to me I said
[1:41] mey sometimes I wonder I said I wonder
[1:46] what's the matter I said why would them
[1:48] meetings be there and God let me lay
[1:50] like this I said why was it and I said
[1:54] sometimes I wonder if he even called me
[1:55] she said ain't you ashamed of yourself
[1:58] and she told me said Bill don't you know
[1:59] that God knows what he's doing with you
[2:01] just just be quiet and so I went in that
[2:05] kind of rebuked me a little you know so
[2:07] I went in laid down on the bed she'd
[2:08] come in to change the sheets and she'd
[2:10] got the the things on her arm and when
[2:13] she started out I look and there was a I
[2:17] seen an old a great big Armory building
[2:19] that the sun had shined down and bursted
[2:21] out on the ground brought it to Pieces
[2:23] the sun shining down from heaven and
[2:25] there come three women and a man come up
[2:29] and they had all like a little bitty
[2:31] like little some kind of little shooting
[2:32] guns like and he said that drives nails
[2:35] and said we you hold these pieces up
[2:37] brother BR and we'll build this Armory
[2:39] back up for you and I said all right
[2:42] I'll do that but something said don't do
[2:44] it well I reach down to get a piece like
[2:47] this to build it up like this and just
[2:49] then a voice spoke to me and said now
[2:52] they're on the road to get you to go
[2:54] back don't you believe it said they're
[2:57] ever so sincere and they're coming to
[2:59] you with thus sayeth the Lord but
[3:01] they're wrong see Fred sofman many of
[3:04] them here was right there and I told him
[3:06] about it and less than an hour the
[3:08] people drove right up to my door I said
[3:10] these three women and a man that's
[3:12] exactly right they come with us sayith
[3:13] the Lord yes sir they I said of course
[3:15] you know what to tell him sincerely
[3:17] wrong see fine people but sincerely
[3:21] wrong then I thought well what can I do
[3:25] what must I do and then mey come in she
[3:27] gone back and brother Freddy went and
[3:29] told people and then after a while I was
[3:31] in there on the on the bed and I thought
[3:35] why does it happen that way why can't I
[3:37] speak why can't I talk to somebody or
[3:39] something I was laying there media come
[3:41] in was going back out of the room and I
[3:43] looked and I seen something make a
[3:46] flicker over to one side and I look and
[3:50] there was my wall opened up and I seen
[3:53] Jesus how many ever ever heard me say
[3:55] I've seen Jesus twice in my life in a
[3:57] vision and I believed I would see him
[3:59] again before the the end time see see
[4:01] him again now I looked and the skies was
[4:04] right out there just looked like looked
[4:05] through the wall and there was the Bible
[4:08] standing right like this great big Bible
[4:10] standing in the sky well there something
[4:12] got light around the Bible and out of
[4:14] the Bible come a real pretty Golden
[4:17] Cross and it stood out like this and the
[4:19] lights coming from all around it and out
[4:21] of that cross he walked the Bible
[4:24] reflected the cross the cross reflected
[4:26] him and he come walking out and walked
[4:28] right down to where it was at I can see
[4:30] it just as plain I see the that cross
[4:32] reflecting his hair standing there hung
[4:34] down over his face he looked down at me
[4:36] like
[4:38] that and he said to me you are waiting
[4:41] for your new ministry to be confirmed to
[4:44] you he said I've already confirmed it to
[4:47] you it's already confirmed you've got to
[4:50] accept it and I didn't listen to him
[4:53] just a minute it come into my mind I
[4:55] didn't hear that it just come into my
[4:57] mind like a man that he's been a sinner
[4:59] all his life and he knows there's a
[5:01] Bible knows there's a God but all it
[5:03] wants to hear is a sermon then something
[5:05] tells him it's you then that same word's
[5:08] been there all the time yet it's
[5:09] confirmed to him then he says Lord
[5:11] forgive me but it won't do no good until
[5:14] he accepts his salvation then he goes
[5:17] out as a Christian no matter how much he
[5:19] cries how much he begs he's got to
[5:20] accept it and the he said to me that
[5:23] you've got to accept it the same way
[5:26] you've got to believe it I'm afraid of
[5:28] defeat anything I'm afraid I'll bring a
[5:30] reproach I'm always afraid of watching
[5:32] think I'll call the wrong thing cuz I
[5:34] took warning of the Bible how that Moses
[5:37] is given great power and he smoked the
[5:39] rock instead of speaking to it I
[5:41] remember Elijah because he went
[5:43] baldheaded them little children teasing
[5:44] about being baldheaded he put a curse on
[5:46] those children and 42 of them was killed
[5:48] by bears see not it wasn't the Holy
[5:51] Spirit but it that Prophet angered and I
[5:54] I've went through all the things coming
[5:56] to that and there he stood talking to me
[5:58] and he said but
[6:00] you walk with too many he said to walk
[6:02] with me you walk
[6:07] alone I'd seen that I've been catering
[6:10] too much to denominations and everything
[6:12] you see somebody trying to tell you what
[6:14] to do and what not to do you got to
[6:16] follow him
[6:18] amen now remember the vision that he
[6:20] gave me about the fishing you know and
[6:22] how that you couldn't teach Supernatural
[6:23] signs the Pentecostal babies you
[6:25] remember there it was and I'm right at
[6:27] the brim of this new message no more
[6:30] than the vision left me I said amen Lord
[6:33] and my wife and stand there almost
[6:35] fainted and I jumped up out of the bed I
[6:38] could talk as good as I ever did just in
[6:40] a second every bit of the fever left me
[6:42] I called up doc she I said likey look at
[6:44] me he said what and I come over there
[6:48] and he looked at me looked through those
[6:49] signs and said tell me what happened
[6:51] brother Brandon I said you believe my
[6:53] story said how I could I doubt it it's
[6:55] happened that's it see that's it friends
[6:58] God knows how to hold you on an ash Heep
[7:01] he knows how to do something for you
[7:03] until he can get the message over to you
[7:05] see to get to do something today I don't
[7:08] know how much defeat I went in not long
[7:10] or was listening to a radio broadcast
[7:12] and there's a minister preaching on the
[7:15] resurrection from 1 Corinthians 15 and
[7:18] he was preaching the resurrection and he
[7:20] stopped right in the middle of his
[7:22] sermon and he said you know so many
[7:24] people are afraid of
[7:25] defeat he said when General Patton lost
[7:29] a bunch of soldiers said then they told
[7:31] him he sent back and he wanted some more
[7:33] and they sent him up some more he got
[7:34] them killed he sent for some more and
[7:37] when he got them third Bunch up there
[7:38] said every time a bullet would whine
[7:40] they'd run out tin or run under
[7:41] something that they're scared he said
[7:43] Sam me up man not kids he said I want
[7:47] man that's ready to die I don't want
[7:49] somebody's afraid to die if the cause
[7:51] we're fighting for is not worthy to die
[7:52] for then keep them away from me I want
[7:55] man he said but you've lost two or three
[7:58] battles he said I I haven't lost a war
[8:01] I've just lost a battle something spoke
[8:03] in my heart I remember eising Hower said
[8:06] when I throw a bullet commanded and they
[8:08] throw a shell in the gun they pulled it
[8:09] off and it was a fizzle it didn't work
[8:12] said I didn't quit and surrender I throw
[8:14] the bullet out and put another one in
[8:15] tried it if it didn't work I put another
[8:17] one in until one did work that's the way
[8:20] it's got to be done I don't know how
[8:22] it'll be but God is my judge over this
[8:24] Pulpit I don't know how many Fizzles and
[8:27] how many how many battles I lose but
[8:29] I'll not lose the war he told me he'd be
[8:31] with me I'll Stand till I see that
[8:34] Ministry confirmed and see in operation
[8:36] I begin this morning by the grace of God
[8:39] I don't know where it'll work here where
[8:40] it'll work somewhere else how it'll work
[8:41] or what it'll take place but I'll walk
[8:43] right down prayer lines praying for the
[8:45] sick until I do know what's happening
[8:48] I've seen it happen to three
[8:49] times
