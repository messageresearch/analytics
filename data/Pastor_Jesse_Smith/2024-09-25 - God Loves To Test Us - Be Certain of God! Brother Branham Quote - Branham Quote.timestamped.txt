[0:00] you know it's a strange thing may God
[0:05] let this soap into every one of you if
[0:08] you never hear me preach
[0:10] again let this be a
[0:13] message it's strange most
[0:18] strange that sometimes that God does
[0:22] things that
[0:23] way you know when we have confessed our
[0:27] sins and met every request requirement
[0:30] that God
[0:32] requires we believed on God there's a
[0:36] circumstances has to be met and it's
[0:39] according to his will and we've
[0:41] confessed our
[0:43] sins and we've made all the wrongs that
[0:46] we have did
[0:48] right done everything that we know how
[0:50] to do every requirement that God has
[0:53] made or asked we have met that
[0:57] requirement and yet he lays
[1:02] silent it just won't answer
[1:06] us I'm sure that I'm speaking to people
[1:11] this morning who's come to that
[1:15] place I've been there many times
[1:19] myself when I went back and traced my
[1:22] life and turned over every
[1:26] stone and I find that I did something
[1:29] wrong go confess it and say Lord God
[1:32] I'll make it right and go do
[1:35] so then come back again and say now Lord
[1:38] th God you'll answer me surely I met
[1:42] every request that you required me to do
[1:44] and every requirement I have met it and
[1:49] still he won't
[1:52] move seems to set
[1:56] silent that's when you've got to be sure
[1:59] that he is
[2:03] God don't be
[2:06] discouraged the only thing isn't in your
[2:09] heart to be certain of
[2:15] God my
[2:17] text be certain first before you do
[2:22] anything be certain in your heart that
[2:25] it's
[2:26] God and when you've met everything that
[2:29] he said
[2:30] then you're sure that he's
[2:32] God that's when Faith goes to work right
[2:36] there Fai stand steady for it knows that
[2:41] he
[2:42] is and you met every
[2:45] requirement you believe that he is and
[2:48] Faith Hold
[2:51] Steady oh blessed be his
[2:56] name Faith won't move or it sure that
[3:00] God
[3:01] is and a rewarder of those that
[3:04] diligently seek
[3:06] Him may this go away down deep and never
[3:10] move from you brandom
[3:13] Tabernacle if you've met God's
[3:15] requirements and in your heart you
[3:18] believe that he is God's only testing
[3:20] your
[3:22] faith for he loves to do
[3:26] that you've confessed your sin and
[3:29] you've met every requirement that God
[3:32] requires and still he lays silent
[3:35] remember faith says that he
[3:38] is then Faith holds on to
[3:41] it not knowing what it's all about but
[3:45] it knows that he is and it's certain
[3:47] that he
[3:48] is then remember if he
[3:51] is his words has to be
[3:55] true and if he required you to meet
[3:58] these circumstances and you did he's
[4:01] obligated to take care of his word don't
[4:04] back off and say I never got healed I oh
[4:08] you poor weak
[4:10] Faith don't believe that if everything's
[4:14] confessed everything's out and you met
[4:16] God's requirement face hes right there
[4:20] there's nothing will move
[4:21] it he
[4:23] is and you're
[4:25] sure they that wait upon the Lord shall
[4:29] renew to their
[4:31] strength they shall Mount up with the
[4:33] wings of an
[4:36] eagle they shall run and not be
[4:39] weary if they walk they shall not
[4:44] faint wait when you met his requirement
[4:48] that brings your faith to a
[4:51] showdown if you have met God's
[4:53] requirements has been made or
[4:57] met and you have
[5:00] fully considered
[5:02] it and you have done everything that God
[5:05] required you to do then your faith rests

[5:14] God you know he loves to test
[5:17] us he loves to see the reaction of your
[5:21] faith did you know that God likes to see
[5:25] how you
[5:28] react when you say oh Lord I believe you
[5:31] Thou Are My
[5:33] Savior I believe that you are the Healer
[5:36] I believe that you are the one who gives
[5:39] the Holy
[5:40] Spirit and the things that I am
[5:42] requiring you are the God who gives that
[5:46] and then when you confess all your sins
[5:49] and promise God what you'll do if he'll
[5:51] let you get
[5:52] well and then because it don't
[5:56] happen you run off like a card somewhere
[6:01] God can't use
[6:03] that there's no way for him to use you
[6:06] there's no way for him to answer you
[6:08] because he only Answers by
[6:11] faith then all of a sudden you go away
[6:16] and he can't answer but real true Faith
[6:19] stands there being sure that God is he's
[6:24] certain that he is and if God asks this
[6:27] thing to be done to confess your sins
[6:29] and so forth and you've done it faith
[6:32] says that he is it's certain that it's
[6:37] going to happen your request has to be
[6:41] granted well I hope you don't miss
[6:46] that if you're sure of God God's sure of
[6:51] his
[6:53] word he's only waiting to test you
