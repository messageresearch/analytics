[0:03] and a voice said to me I'll meet you in
[0:06] there that'll be the third pool I said
[0:09] why he said well it won't be a public
[0:12] show like the
[0:14] other
[0:15] and I came
[0:18] too greetings friends in the matchless
[0:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:23] purpose of this videos to answer a
[0:24] viewer's question about my thoughts on
[0:26] brother bram's 1956 tent vision and why
[0:30] I believe it's fulfilled hi friends I'm
[0:32] Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:34] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for the
[0:37] past 18 years and I defend the Gospel of
[0:40] Jesus Christ as Jesus revealed it to St
[0:42] Paul and then restored it through his
[0:45] Endtime Prophet brother William Marin
[0:47] and brandham 1909 to 1965 and also
[0:50] defend brother Ram's Godly Christian
[0:52] character so before getting into these
[0:55] four reasons I believe the temp vision
[0:56] is fulfilled I just want to reference a
[0:58] previous video I made it's called the
[0:59] brown bear Vision Video this is a
[1:01] 70-minute video and towards the end of
[1:04] this video I give brief responses to
[1:06] some questions about brother br's
[1:07] Ministry around the 46 minute Mark I do
[1:10] a short section on the tent vision and
[1:12] so a lot of that content a lot of the
[1:15] quotes and scriptures will be in this
[1:16] video as well and I'll leave a link to
[1:18] the description to that video so you can
[1:20] go watch it if you like by God's grace
[1:23] so here's the four reasons I believe the
[1:24] tent vision is fulfilled first brother
[1:26] random said that the angel told him the
[1:28] tent vision would not be a public show
[1:32] and of course the tth vision was about
[1:33] the third poll so we know the first two
[1:36] polls were public the first poll was the
[1:38] sign in brother bram's hand which I've
[1:40] read numerous books about people that
[1:42] were in brother bram's meetings and they
[1:44] actually witnessed those dots or
[1:46] patterns on brother Ram's hand in order
[1:48] to discern sicknesses and that was a
[1:51] public sign people could see it publicly
[1:54] and of course the second poll was the
[1:55] discernment of the thoughts and in tents
[1:57] of the heart as Hebrews 4:12 speaks of
[2:00] the word of God is a discerner dividing
[2:02] us under soul body and spirit and of
[2:05] course that's also called the Messianic
[2:07] sign that Jesus manifested in John
[2:09] chapter 1 and John chapter 4 but of
[2:12] course that Ministry was never
[2:13] manifested to the Gentiles that's why
[2:16] Jesus had to come to brother brandham at
[2:18] the end time and give him a son of man
[2:20] Ministry in order to show that Messiah
[2:22] sign to the Gentiles and brother R said
[2:24] that sign was the last sign to the
[2:26] Gentiles before the Rapture with thus
[2:28] sayith the Lord there's at least six
[2:30] quotes on this so let's listen to one of
[2:32] them by God's
[2:34] grace is right here among you you'll
[2:37] just remember thus saith the Lord you
[2:41] will never in any oh more Gentile Church
[2:45] age ever see any sign to succeed this go
[2:51] greater this is the last sign to the
[2:54] church so this first reason is the third
[2:58] poll wasn't a public show the first two
[3:01] polls were public so the third poll was
[3:04] the opening of the word and of course it
[3:06] involved the revelation of the Seven
[3:08] Seals and so brother Ram told us when he
[3:10] preached the revelation of the Seven
[3:11] Seals he met with the pillar of Fire or
[3:14] the angel Lord or the Holy Ghost every
[3:17] day for seven days straight in order to
[3:19] get the Revelation and of course this
[3:21] was a private meeting between the Lord
[3:23] and brother brandham I think it was at
[3:25] brother Banks Wood's house if I'm not
[3:27] mistaken so first let's listen to the
[3:29] quote from from why are people so tossed
[3:31] about January 1st 1956 brother Ram said
[3:33] it won't be a public show let's listen
[3:35] to the
[3:36] quote and a voice said to me I'll meet
[3:39] you in there that'll be the third pull I
[3:43] said why he said well it won't be a
[3:46] public show like the
[3:48] other
[3:50] and I came
[3:52] too now the next quote is from the
[3:54] seventh seal uh brother Ram said it's
[3:56] been a tremendous week I'm tired my mind
[3:58] is tired something going strange on
[4:01] every day and then a few paragraphs
[4:03] later he says I've been sitting up there
[4:06] in the room for 8 days and so we see he
[4:09] was shut in it wasn't a public show of
[4:11] the Holy Spirit visiting him and
[4:13] manifesting the revelation of the Seven
[4:15] Seals let's listen to those two quotes
[4:17] together and now we are grateful to God
[4:20] for what he has showed us I've been
[4:22] sitting in the room up there for eight
[4:25] days and the message that I have just
[4:30] got through explaining to you many of
[4:32] you here will
[4:34] understand this has been a tremendous
[4:37] week for me I'm tired my mind is tired
[4:41] because I I have was the best that I
[4:44] could do and something strange going on
[4:46] every day I would be amazed to walk in
[4:49] the room and be there for a few minutes
[4:52] and see something is turn me completely
[4:54] around okay reason number two is that
[4:57] the angel of the Lord interpreted to
[4:59] brandom the meaning of the little room
[5:02] the angel lord said it was in a prayer
[5:05] closet or a place of prayer according to
[5:08] Matthew chapter 6 so the angel Lord
[5:11] cited the scripture Matthew 6:6 but thou
[5:15] when thou prayest enter into thy closet
[5:17] and when thou H has shut thy door pray
[5:19] to the Father which is in secret and thy
[5:21] father which seeth in secret shall
[5:22] reward thee openly so here's the quote
[5:25] from 1956 it's from being led of the
[5:27] Holy Spirit February 19th where brother
[5:29] Ram says the the angel told him to go in
[5:31] the closet and pray and I love what
[5:33] brother Ram said the angel was always
[5:34] scriptural and that's exactly right
[5:36] let's listen to the quote and I said I
[5:39] don't understand that in there and watch
[5:41] he's always scriptural he said did not
[5:44] our Lord say when thou prayest be not
[5:47] like the Hypocrites that like to make a
[5:49] show said enter into the secret closet
[5:52] and when you've done so close the door
[5:54] then pray your father what seeth in
[5:56] secret and he that seeth in secret shall
[5:58] reward thee openly and he said you
[6:00] remember that name that you were hunting
[6:02] that time that you dreamed about and I
[6:04] said yes he said I'll meet you in there
[6:07] in this time it won't be a public
[6:10] Show and The Vision left me now we got
[6:15] the T in making and then in there I'll
[6:18] be able to care pry line right on
[6:20] through now you remember I speak this
[6:23] before it comes to pass the exceedingly
[6:25] abundantly is fixing to take place I
[6:28] can't wait till I get into that place I
[6:31] just my hearts are yearning and burning
[6:34] now let's listen to two quotes from
[6:35] brother Brandon from 1963 the first one
[6:38] is on questions and answers on the seals
[6:41] brother brand said he was to himself
[6:42] alog together in a boarding place he's
[6:45] been alone and it's been a really great
[6:47] time and then after that I'll play a
[6:49] quote from the next day the seventh seal
[6:50] where brother brandom says he's been in
[6:53] that room with the shades pulled down in
[6:54] a light on for 8 days then I'll play the
[6:57] quote from the seventh seal where
[6:59] brother Bram said something strange
[7:01] would go on every day he'd read from UAH
[7:04] Smith and other writers and he say it
[7:06] just didn't work out right then he
[7:08] walked up and down the floor while kneel
[7:10] down and pray go back pick up the Bible
[7:12] and then all of a sudden he got real
[7:14] quiet and it just unfolded it and he'd
[7:16] grab a pen and write real quick whatever
[7:19] he was seeing and doing in the vision
[7:21] watching it like that and wrote it down
[7:23] then he take the rest of the day and
[7:24] search the scriptures in order to prove
[7:27] all things let's listen to the quotes
[7:30] and I I've been to myself all together
[7:32] and been boarding at a place or going
[7:35] down eating at a place and um I've just
[7:39] been alone so it's been really a great
[7:42] time and my mind at this time the reason
[7:46] I had that healing service this morning
[7:48] because my human mind is becoming so um
[7:53] way from my own way of thinking I have
[7:56] tried to stay in a in a room with a
[7:59] Shades pulled down a light on this is
[8:02] the eighth day and not even got in my
[8:06] car to to go anywhere I had to go with
[8:08] some brothers down to Banks to sign some
[8:10] notes and things on money and stuff that
[8:12] been borred for this church but I but I
[8:15] come right straight back and went right
[8:17] to study and the strange thing there
[8:20] hasn't been one person said anything or
[8:24] usually they're knocking and pulling and
[8:26] around there hasn't been one thing it's
[8:28] been very phenomenal
[8:30] Hallelujah where I've been eating at at
[8:33] brother
[8:34] Woods's usually that place is packed
[8:36] around with cars and they had eight or
[8:39] 10 different people go to come stay with
[8:41] them during his time and not a one of
[8:43] them come Lord and here I go in there I
[8:47] pick up the notes I pick up books of Dr
[8:49] Smith you're a Smith and all all the
[8:52] writers and and read in read down in
[8:55] their books I see now here's the Sixth
[8:56] Seal here's the fourth seal now what do
[8:59] this man say he'd say well it was this
[9:01] that I look over here and get another
[9:03] man he said it was such and such and it
[9:05] looked like I just it just didn't work
[9:07] right and I thought well what is it Lord
[9:10] I walk up and down the floor a while I
[9:12] kneel down and pray go back and pick up
[9:14] the Bible sit down read walk back and
[9:16] forth then all of a sudden when I got
[9:18] quiet you're just unfolded like that
[9:20] then I grab a pen right quick go to WR
[9:22] it down like that whatever I was seeing
[9:24] and doing watching it like that to got
[9:26] it roll down then I take the rest of the
[9:28] day and go down chase this out and see
[9:30] if it tied all the way down through the
[9:32] scriptures then it prove all
[9:35] things I got this year I think now
[9:37] there's many people had Visions there's
[9:39] many been Revelations if it's contrary
[9:41] to the word leave it alone that's right
[9:43] leave it alone now the third reason I
[9:46] believe the tent vision is fulfilled is
[9:47] because of the healings of Supernatural
[9:49] Miracles that took place during the week
[9:51] brother R preached the Seven Seals so in
[9:54] the T Vision brother Ram said at least
[9:56] two people were healed there was at
[9:58] least two miracles
[9:59] so let me play that quote it's from
[10:01] being led of the Holy Spirit again
[10:03] February
[10:04] 1956 the ram said the light went into
[10:06] that building and a woman come out on
[10:09] the ambulance stretcher and she was
[10:11] pushing the stretcher out on the other
[10:13] side and a man came out packing his
[10:15] crutches so there were Supernatural
[10:17] Miracles let's listen that
[10:19] quote now look and here what that real
[10:22] soft like moving away from me and went
[10:25] down and went into that little building
[10:29] and then there's something difference
[10:31] between the light and the angel cuz he
[10:33] was still here with me and the light had
[10:35] went into the building and this Angel
[10:37] still speaking behind me which is a big
[10:39] man and he said I will meet you in
[10:43] there so then I said I don't understand
[10:47] why in there he said watch and this
[10:50] woman when she come out of there on the
[10:52] amlet stretcher she was pushing the
[10:54] stretcher out the other side and she
[10:56] said uh the lady asked her with a said
[11:00] what what happened she said I don't know
[11:02] it just happened she said I've been in a
[11:04] Stretcher said I've been down in bed for
[11:06] years and here come the man out packing
[11:08] his
[11:09] crutches and they asked him what said he
[11:12] didn't know and he's coming to the
[11:13] platform to
[11:14] testify now to support that that there
[11:16] were Supernatural Miracles the week of
[11:18] the Seven Seals brother Ram said in the
[11:20] seventh seal that a Collins boy was
[11:23] dying but the Lord Jesus healed him that
[11:25] week then also a girl was battling
[11:27] leukemia and she was healed that week as
[11:29] well brother Bram said the kingdom of
[11:31] God is coming we're just drawing closer
[11:33] to God all the time so in both cases
[11:36] there was miraculous Supernatural
[11:38] healings let's listen to the quote and
[11:40] I'm
[11:41] sure that you've noticed that things has
[11:44] been happening this
[11:46] week I'm sure you noticed that little
[11:48] Collins boy land there dying other night
[11:51] that little leukemia
[11:52] [Music]
[11:56] girl the kingdom of God God is coming
[12:00] right and it's becoming more from the
[12:03] negative to the positive as it has been
[12:06] now that AR to choke people from
[12:09] justification to sanctification to the
[12:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then here
[12:13] here amen we're just drawing closer to
[12:16] God all the
[12:18] time and finally reason number four
[12:20] there was people receiving
[12:22] salvation in 1956 again being led of the
[12:25] Holy Spirit February 19th brother
[12:27] brandom said he made an altar call and
[12:29] hundreds of people were receiving the
[12:31] Lord Jesus let's listen to the
[12:34] quote I said yes so um got the line
[12:37] ready to throw again and just as it did
[12:39] at that time he taken me away again and
[12:42] he stood me up in the air over a great
[12:44] Auditorium of or big tent oh I never
[12:46] seen such a tent spread way out and in
[12:50] that there was a looked like i' made an
[12:52] Al calling hundreds of people real
[12:54] softly and sweetly were weeping standing
[12:56] at the altar receiving the Lord Jesus
[12:59] and I said that looks better now to show
[13:02] how that's fulfilled during the week of
[13:04] the Seven Seals brother man told us in
[13:07] the seventh seal that another group had
[13:09] been baptized he said it runs over 100
[13:12] this week of people being baptized in
[13:13] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[13:16] friends no doubt more were saved that
[13:18] weren't maybe baptized or didn't have
[13:19] the chance to be baptized maybe they
[13:21] just came in the meetings and stepped
[13:22] out but clearly we can see over 100
[13:24] people receive salvation that week let's
[13:26] listen to the
[13:27] quote i' like to
[13:30] add this that of all the services I've
[13:34] ever had in my life I believe this week
[13:38] has been the most glorious time of all
[13:42] my life in Services no matter what I
[13:45] have I've seen great Miracles performed
[13:48] of course before in healing services but
[13:52] this is beyond
[13:54] that it's been one of the great times
[13:57] highlights of my
[13:59] life is to be here and seeing the little
[14:03] Tabernacle take on this different look
[14:05] not only that but the inside take on a
[14:08] different look Hallelujah and now uh was
[14:13] asking Billy he was so long back com and
[14:15] getting me he said there have been
[14:16] another group baptized which runs over a
[14:19] hundred this week of uh people being
[14:23] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[14:25] Christ amen so we are are thankful and
[14:29] God bless
[14:31] you in closing friends hope this short
[14:34] video was a blessing by the grace of God
[14:36] I wanted to make a quick short video in
[14:38] order to answer this precious person's
[14:40] question by the grace of God I believe
[14:42] these four reasons are enough to prove
[14:44] the T Vision was fulfilled and remember
[14:46] friends prophets don't always know their
[14:47] Visions are fulfilled such as John the
[14:49] Baptist remember in Matthew chap 11 John
[14:52] wasn't sure whether Jesus was the
[14:54] Messiah or not despite having the vision
[14:57] that's recorded in John chapter 1 where
[14:59] John saw the Spirit ascending like a
[15:01] dove and it Abode and remained it
[15:04] descended and remained on Jesus Christ
[15:06] so John saw the vision and when he saw
[15:08] it and Jesus was baptized he was sure he
[15:10] was the Messiah but then through prison
[15:12] and other no doubt tests and trials his
[15:16] eagle eyes got filmed over as brother
[15:18] Ram said he had moments of doubt and he
[15:20] wasn't for sure if the vision was
[15:22] fulfilled or not so that's clearly a
[15:24] Bible precedent that prophets don't
[15:26] always understand Visions or know if
[15:27] they've come to pass or not
[15:29] and also want to say too I didn't spend
[15:30] a lot of time researching the tent
[15:32] vision for this video so no doubt
[15:34] there's probably more reasons the tent
[15:36] vision is fulfilled and there's other
[15:37] details I'd forgotten about cuz I
[15:39] haven't been really studying that lately
[15:41] so I look forward to getting some
[15:42] comments and so maybe we can do a part
[15:44] two of this video by God's grace if you
[15:47] have any questions concerns or
[15:48] testimonies about this video please
[15:49] contact
[15:50] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:53] the desire of your heart
