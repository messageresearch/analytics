[0:12] the spirit of
[0:13] Elijah God has and will use the spirit
[0:15] of Elijah five times to anoint men or
[0:19] prophets Elijah was the first according
[0:21] to First Kings 17:1 followed by Elisha
[0:25] who had a double portion of Elijah's
[0:27] Spirit according to 2 Kings 29-15
[0:30] John the Baptist was the third man
[0:32] Anointed with the spirit of Elijah
[0:33] according to Luke 1:17 Malachi 4:5 and6
[0:37] and Matthew 17:
[0:39] 10-13 We Believe William brandom was the
[0:42] fourth coming of the spirit of Elijah
[0:44] according to Malachi 4:5 and6 Matthew
[0:47] 17:11 Revelation 10:7 and Luke
[0:50] 17:30 we believe the fifth and final man
[0:53] Anointed with the spirit of Elijah will
[0:55] be one of the two witnesses or prophets
[0:57] who prophesied to the Jewish people for
[1:00] 3 and 1/2 years in Revelation 11 the
[1:03] Bible tells us this Elijah Prophet will
[1:05] do one of the same Miracles that the
[1:07] original Elijah performed he will cause
[1:09] it not to rain during the days of his
[1:11] prophecy according to Revelation 11:6
[1:14] and 1 Kings
[1:16] 17:1 the Elijah Spirit characteristics
[1:19] and William
[1:20] brandham to help us further prove
[1:22] William brandham was the Elijah
[1:24] messenger of today let's look at how two
[1:26] of the previous Elijah anointed men of
[1:28] God behaved Elijah and John the Baptist
[1:31] and let's observe how they were treated
[1:33] so we can see the similarities of how
[1:34] William brandham the Elijah messenger of
[1:37] our day acted for each of these three
[1:39] men were anointed of the same Elijah
[1:42] Spirit characteristic number one acted
[1:45] and spoke with thus sayeth the Lord
[1:48] Elijah and John the Baptist both
[1:50] prophesied and their prophecies came to
[1:52] pass so we see that the spirit of Elijah
[1:55] speaks with thus sayith the Lord and
[1:56] only acts upon thus sayith the Lord
[1:58] straight from God by his Revelation
[2:01] William brandham did the same what other
[2:04] minister Billy Graham or Roberts or
[2:06] modern-day ministers like TD Jakes Benny
[2:09] Hinn or Joel ostein speaks with thus
[2:12] sayith the Lord none that we can find
[2:15] only the prophetic Ministry of William
[2:17] brandham spoke with thus sayeth the Lord
[2:20] Elijah speaking with thus sayeth the
[2:22] Lord First Kings 17:14 for thus sayith
[2:25] the Lord God of Israel the barrel of
[2:27] meal shall not waste neither shall the
[2:29] cruise of oil fail until the day that
[2:31] the Lord sendeth rain upon the
[2:34] Earth John the Baptist acted and spoke
[2:37] with thus sayith the Lord John the
[2:39] Baptist foretold that Jesus Christ would
[2:41] take away the sin of the world and then
[2:43] Christ would also baptize with the Holy
[2:45] Ghost both prophecies came to pass John
[2:49] 1:29 the next day John seeth Jesus
[2:52] coming unto him and saith Behold the
[2:54] Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[2:56] the
[2:57] world John 1:33 and I knew him not but
[3:01] he that sent me to baptize with water
[3:03] the same said unto me upon whom Thou
[3:05] shalt see the spirit descending and
[3:07] remaining on him the same as he which
[3:09] baptizes with the Holy
[3:11] Ghost William brandham also acted and
[3:14] spoke with thus sayith the Lord please
[3:16] see our video called three Prophecies of
[3:18] William brandham you will see one
[3:20] prophecy that is already fulfilled the
[3:22] immoral condition of United States
[3:24] churches showing that United States
[3:26] churches would be given over to rock and
[3:28] roll smoking Bob haar and other worldly
[3:32] habits two other prophecies are in the
[3:34] process of being fulfilled no greater
[3:37] Ministry would rise to the Gentiles than
[3:39] the ministry of brother
[3:41] brandham and third no denomination would
[3:44] ever come back to the apostolic teaching
[3:46] of the
[3:47] Bible the second characteristic the
[3:50] spirit of Elijah condemned religious
[3:52] man-made organizations and their
[3:54] leaders these Elijah anointed men of God
[3:57] were set apart from the widely accepted
[3:59] religious schools and organizations of
[4:02] their day and condemn their false
[4:04] Doctrine and man-made systems Elijah and
[4:07] John the Baptist by the spirit of God
[4:10] condemned the leading religious
[4:11] organizations of their day because they
[4:13] would not repent William branam did the
[4:16] same Elijah rebuked Ahab the king of
[4:19] Israel to his face and said his 450 Bale
[4:22] prophets were false prophets First Kings
[4:25] 18:18 and he answered I have not
[4:27] troubled Israel but thou and thy
[4:29] father's house in that ye have forsaken
[4:32] the Commandments of the Lord and thou
[4:33] has followed balum verse 22 then said
[4:37] Elijah unto the people I even I only
[4:39] remain a prophet of the Lord but baal's
[4:42] prophets are 450 men John the Baptist
[4:46] called Pharisees and Sadducees a
[4:48] Generation of
[4:49] Vipers Matthew 3:6 and were baptized of
[4:52] him in Jordan confessing their sins but
[4:55] when he saw many of the Pharisees and
[4:57] Sadducees come to his baptism he said
[4:59] unto them oh Generation of Vipers who ha
[5:01] warned you to flee from the Wrath to
[5:03] come William brandham condemned the
[5:06] preachers of his day for preaching
[5:08] man-made Creeds and dogmas rather than
[5:10] the true revealed word of God and today
[5:13] I indite this bunch of forain ministers
[5:17] in their Creeds and denominations
[5:19] they're crucifying to the people the
[5:22] very God that they claim that they love
[5:24] and serve amen I indict these ministers
[5:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus upon their
[5:34] doctrine that claim that the days of
[5:36] Miracles is passed and if the water
[5:39] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is
[5:40] not sufficient and not right upon any of
[5:44] these words that they have substituted
[5:46] Creeds for I indict them as guilty in
[5:49] the blood of Jesus Christ upon their
[5:52] hands are crucifying aresh the Lord
[5:56] Jesus the second
[5:58] time they are are crucifying Christ to
[6:01] the
[6:02] public taking from them the thing that
[6:05] they're supposed to be given to them and
[6:07] they substituted something else in its
[6:08] place
[6:10] amen a church Creed for
[6:13] popularity the third characteristic the
[6:16] spirit of Elijah condemned immorality in
[6:19] women Elijah and John the Baptist
[6:21] condemned the rise of immoral women in
[6:23] their day some of which were strong
[6:25] political figures William brandham did
[6:28] the same Elijah condemn the immorality
[6:30] of Jezebel queen of Israel wife of King
[6:34] Ahab First Kings
[6:36] 21:23 and of Jezebel also spake the Lord
[6:39] saying the dog shall eat Jezebel by the
[6:41] wall of
[6:43] Jezreel John the Baptist publicly
[6:45] rebuked Herod the ruler of Galilee for
[6:47] his unscriptural second marriage to
[6:50] herodias Luke 3:19 but Herod the
[6:53] tetrarch being reproved by him for
[6:55] herodias his brother Philip's wife and
[6:58] for all the evils which Herod had had
[6:59] done added yet this above all that he
[7:02] shut up John in prison Matthew 14:4 for
[7:05] John said unto him it is not lawful for
[7:07] thee to have her William brandham also
[7:10] condemned immorality in women and called
[7:12] out some famous women by name because of
[7:15] their evil influence upon the rest of
[7:16] the nation and especially women old
[7:19] Elijah had bowled out so many those
[7:21] painted faed Jey bells and haircuts and
[7:25] so forth that they were used to that day
[7:26] the old man has spent his life just

[7:30] because they had a woman Jezebel there
[7:32] set a past just about like a Hollywood

[7:44] great power too yeah don't want you to
