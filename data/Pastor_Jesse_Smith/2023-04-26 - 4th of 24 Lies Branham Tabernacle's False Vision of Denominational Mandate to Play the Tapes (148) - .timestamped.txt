[0:05] that's good but that is just that's just
[0:08] being able to read
[0:11] [Music]
[0:12] the spirit has never Quicken you to
[0:15] either follow the word of God
[0:22] these people claim to believe every word
[0:24] that you say to be true but they don't
[0:27] they do believe that their own actions
[0:29] prove that they don't
[0:33] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:38] this video is to show the fourth lie
[0:40] coming out of Branham Tabernacle which
[0:42] is a false vision of a denominational
[0:44] mandate to play tapes Brenham
[0:47] Tabernacles leadership has basically
[0:49] become a denomination and they want
[0:52] every church that calls himself a
[0:54] message Church who believes the end time
[0:55] message of God's Prophet brother William
[0:58] Branham to play tapes as the main part
[1:01] of their worship Services rather than
[1:03] having living men preach the Living Word
[1:06] of God of course we know this is a false
[1:08] vision
[1:10] recall the first lie is that every word
[1:12] on brother Brown's tapes are thus say
[1:14] the Lord
[1:15] the second lie is all answers are on
[1:17] brother branham's tapes and brother
[1:19] branham's words cannot fail and the
[1:21] third lie was that people can
[1:24] unquestionably believe every word on
[1:26] brother branham's tapes even if he lied
[1:29] and people don't have to have their
[1:31] guard up or be careful when listening to
[1:33] brother Branham because every word is
[1:35] thus say the Lord
[1:37] and of course these lies if believed
[1:39] open someone up to receiving the spirit
[1:42] of idolatry and other evil spirits
[1:45] which is why as I've said in the past
[1:47] the most harsh comments I've ever gotten
[1:50] on YouTube are not from Sinners or
[1:52] denominational people they're from the
[1:54] tape Church movement people and also
[1:57] recently they've stopped making comments
[1:58] on my videos likely because random
[2:01] Tabernacle leadership controls them and
[2:04] tells them don't listen to anything
[2:05] except random Tabernacles pastor and
[2:08] brother Branham so friends they are in a
[2:10] very sad State it's a cult-like
[2:12] denomination
[2:14] so we got to keep praying for them as we
[2:16] will in this video
[2:17] before playing the audio of Brenham
[2:19] Tabernacles leadership speaking their
[2:21] false Vision I want to reference my 77th
[2:24] video called tape boys are not part of
[2:26] Jesus's fivefold Ministry it's a 41
[2:29] minute long video and if you want a more
[2:31] thorough teaching on this subject I
[2:33] would encourage you to go listen to that
[2:35] video or watch that video
[2:37] so now let's listen to the audio of
[2:39] random tabernacle's false Vision which
[2:41] is a denominational mandate that all
[2:43] churches should play tapes rather than
[2:45] have living preachers and just so you
[2:47] know I've heard Brenham Tabernacle
[2:49] leadership say it's okay for preachers
[2:51] to preach but the main emphasis has to
[2:53] be pressing play well of course you
[2:55] never find that in the Bible you never
[2:57] find brother Branham saying that either
[2:58] in this audio you'll hear Brandon
[3:01] Tabernacles Pastor say the message or
[3:04] the tapes are the absolute I'll address
[3:05] this lie in a future video by God's
[3:08] grace so let's listen to the quote
[3:11] there has to be a true faithful Ministry
[3:14] there's men of God that have true
[3:16] callings of God on their lives
[3:18] that believe this message with all their
[3:21] heart they preach this message with all
[3:24] their heart they believe it they believe
[3:26] this message is the absolute amen now
[3:31] you've got a true faithful Minister's
[3:33] got to believe this message is an
[3:34] absolute this end time message he just
[3:37] said it was the token which is the holy
[3:39] spirit it is this message so it has to
[3:43] be your absolute
[3:45] but there is got to catch the vision you
[3:49] got to play the tapes
[3:51] you've got to
[4:00] amen
[4:07] praise the Lord
[4:10] now that we've heard Brandon Tabernacles
[4:12] lie let's play that and then right after
[4:15] that we'll play brother random's vision
[4:17] for the future in 1962 taking sides with
[4:20] Jesus brother Brown told us his vision
[4:22] for the future his vision was for young
[4:24] ministers to be trained up in the
[4:26] message so that when heeded missionary
[4:28] work and gain new converts overseas he
[4:32] could send up trained ministers to go to
[4:34] these people and preach the message to
[4:36] them he said he wanted to place them
[4:38] worldwide but in order to do that they'd
[4:41] have to have ministers meetings where
[4:43] the Elder ministers Could Teach the
[4:44] younger ministers the preachers of the
[4:46] gospel and so brother Branham said the
[4:48] younger ministers could have the gospel
[4:50] straight and they would Influence People
[4:52] the right way brother random called it
[4:54] God's system so brother branham's Vision
[4:57] was centered around the fivefold
[4:59] ministry working together Training Up
[5:00] Young ministers in order to place them
[5:03] in new churches that would be formed
[5:05] from Brother branham's missionary work
[5:06] let's listen to the quotes
[5:09] but they've got to catch the vision you
[5:13] got to play the tapes
[5:16] you've got to
[5:19] now we're going to start off with the
[5:22] early church and just bring it for about
[5:24] five minutes now down to what they did
[5:27] and then I can show you the vision that
[5:29] I have for the future
[5:32] little churches and uh you want to
[5:35] you're doing no work gonna reward you
[5:38] for that go out there preach do
[5:40] everything you can let all of you get
[5:42] together you bunch of men are having
[5:44] meetings and popcorn deep things in the
[5:46] scripture and pray
[5:51] [Music]
[5:52] other ministers
[5:54] and that you see that that has a calling
[5:57] in their life for the ministry treat
[5:59] them young man bring them in here to the
[6:01] Elder already set together in a
[6:04] ministerial meeting and there teach the
[6:07] deeper things of God don't worry
[6:10] the one who
[6:13] is
[6:14] a leader for you
[6:16] and then there are churches can go here
[6:18] and training up a group of men and
[6:22] right there there's places I can place
[6:25] the world now
[6:26] what if I had a group of men
[6:29] young man I needed a message
[6:32] okay
[6:33] say now wait a minute
[6:35] before I leave here
[6:38] we're gonna set in our these churches
[6:44] we're on the road here right now
[6:47] to take over this
[6:49] a good man is two or three young men
[6:52] with him who will be his helpers and
[6:54] assistants
[6:55] and a church of this day
[6:59] who's
[7:01] who's in Germany
[7:07] oh around the Nations where I've been
[7:12] defends another from another comes
[7:13] another see what I mean
[7:15] if you get the preacher straight and him
[7:17] going right look what he's going to do
[7:19] he's going to enfusa it will take care
[7:22] of those hundreds of these things that's
[7:24] it we'll just be
[7:27] beaten
[7:28] system
[7:30] uh Jethro said the universes why you
[7:33] can't beat out all of them
[7:35] and God put
[7:37] counters out there
[7:39] saved him and took the
[7:40] tuck that was all Moses and put them up
[7:43] almost 70 hours and they probably
[7:47] it strengthened him you know just as
[7:50] much prophecy and
[7:52] they didn't want to cut the spirit off
[7:53] of the prophesied
[7:54] it just separated
[7:59] this is a major thing you come in with
[8:01] them
[8:08] at her change and I believe it's God's
[8:10] way now
[8:12] foreign
[8:24] let's notice the contrast between
[8:25] brother Branham and current Branham
[8:28] Tabernacle leadership in regards to
[8:30] their Visions brother branham's Vision
[8:32] was to train preachers with answers in
[8:35] contrast current Brenham Tabernacle
[8:38] leadership's vision is to ignore
[8:40] preachers and instead train tape boys to
[8:43] push play giving the people no answers
[8:46] to their questions
[8:48] like is Billy Paul the promise Joseph or
[8:50] not as brother Branham said in 1951
[8:54] also brother Brandon's Vision was to
[8:55] send preachers to new converts to his
[8:58] bible-based message
[9:00] contrast that with current Branham
[9:02] Tabernacle leaderships false Vision to
[9:05] send Tate boys into established faithful
[9:09] Ministry churches to infiltrate them and
[9:12] persuade them to preach less which
[9:14] breaks the word of God and to tell them
[9:16] to just press play and Obey so who are
[9:19] we going to believe which Vision are we
[9:21] going to catch brother branham's Vision
[9:23] or the current false vision of Branham
[9:26] Tabernacle leadership let's catch
[9:29] brother branham's Vision because it's a
[9:31] bible-based vision
[9:34] friends I hope this was helpful notice
[9:36] Bram Tabernacle saying you have to copy
[9:38] our way of false worship it's a it's a
[9:41] denominational mandate they're saying
[9:43] you have to see the fivefold ministry
[9:45] the exact same way we do you've got to
[9:48] do it
[9:49] so sad they should be saying you've got
[9:51] to do what the Bible says like Saint
[9:54] Paul said and like brother Branham said
[9:56] brother Branham never had Brenham
[9:58] tabernacle's false Vision Brotherhood
[10:01] never had his son's false vision of the
[10:04] fivefold ministry that essentially
[10:06] exalts Tate boys above the fivefold
[10:09] ministry and now let's play a few quotes
[10:11] from Brother Branham where he tells the
[10:13] fivefold ministry I'm right behind you
[10:14] brother Adam said he's not the only one
[10:17] that should preach
[10:18] brother Ram's saying we need preachers
[10:21] and he says don't change a thing in
[10:23] regarding to evangelists continue on the
[10:25] field and of course current Brenham
[10:27] Tabernacle leadership has contradicted
[10:29] all these quotes from other Branham
[10:31] proving they do not believe brother
[10:33] Branham
[10:34] and so we know if brother Brandon was
[10:35] here he'd be right behind the true five
[10:37] full ministry living men preaching the
[10:39] Living Word of God as the Bible commands
[10:41] in Ephesians 4 verses 8-16 and in Romans
[10:46] 10 verses 14 and 15 the Bible said how
[10:49] shall they preach except they be sent
[10:51] notice it's they God wants they a group
[10:55] of men to preach the word of God just
[10:57] like Ephesians 4 8-16 says the fivefold
[11:01] ministry
[11:02] today brand of Tabernacle says we need
[11:04] one man to preach William Branham they
[11:06] say him one man but the Bible says they
[11:09] a group of men in the fivefold ministry
[11:12] Apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[11:14] evangelists let's listen to the quotes
[11:20] the gospel or is the time
[11:27] behind you
[11:31] but they've got to catch the vision you
[11:35] got to play the tapes
[11:38] you've got to
[11:42] you and just bring it for about five
[11:44] minutes now down to what they did and
[11:46] then I can show you the vision that I
[11:48] have for the future
[11:51] now brother
[11:54] brother one should
[11:56] you
[11:58] we have seen
[12:00] your
[12:01] we have seen you are Dean man
[12:06] don't believe you would do that if there
[12:10] were not that they were not to preach
[12:13] Mercy Mercy brother sister told you that
[12:17] nobody's preached for me you're not sure
[12:18] if you have four subjects with all that
[12:21] no
[12:22] don't worry imagine
[12:34] I'm just one little Pebble on the beach
[12:37] among many people
[12:40] uh there's this many is more eligible
[12:43] more worthy more of anything to preach
[12:46] than me I'm just one loyal
[12:55] you know what I mean
[12:59] you should preach the gospel
[13:02] but they've got to catch the vision you
[13:06] got to play the tapes
[13:09] you've got to
[13:15] go down to what they did and then I can
[13:17] I can show you the vision that I have
[13:19] for the future
[13:22] should evangelists continue on the field
[13:27] in this hour of course what they mean
[13:29] certainly
[13:30] by all means don't change a thing
[13:33] if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach
[13:36] Today and I could be it will be 10 years
[13:37] someday but live life's gonna be in this
[13:39] hour
[13:41] don't don't get scribbled up now that's
[13:43] why I'm trying to warn you about see
[13:45] just don't be a black recruiter don't
[13:48] change that but if you're doing
[13:49] something wrong or you're doing evil
