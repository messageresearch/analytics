TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 2 the mystery of israel's spiritual blindness mystery number 2 of 12. chapter 2 contains footnotes numbers 284 to 368. for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles become in romans 11 verse 25 before discussing israel's blindness it's important to understand her biblical history the old testament richly chronicles israel's relationship with the one person god yahweh the god of the bible this relationship begins in eden showing how god revealed himself to adam's faithful descendants israel through the old testament but later in the new testament had to put spiritual blindness that still exists today upon the jews that he might show mercy to the gentiles adam and eve's godly seed proceeds through cess lineage to noah between noah's three sons ham shem and japheth shem emerges as the faithful servant to god proven by the godly deeds of him and his descendants the lord promises to bless every nation through father abraham the ninth descendant from shem but specifically isaac seed is recognized as the true heirs of his everlasting covenant in genesis 17 verses 19 through 21 and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year five generations from isaac comes moses god's prophet sent to deliver the children of israel out of egyptian slavery in moses's time god's compassionate description of his love for his people begins to manifest three months after the exodus in the desert of sinai god instructs moses to tell israel they're a special treasure to him exodus 19 verses 4 through 6 reads ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel hardly more beautiful comforting words could ever be received imagine the creator of the universe calling you his special treasure israel was indeed blessed and highly favored being singled out from every nation under heaven as the holder of god's covenants and blessings in fact paul says all other nations egypt persia greece china japan russia etc were aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world indeed israel was the chosen special privileged and peculiar people in the earth thanks to god's gracious choosing but god had conditions to his covenant with israel he said if israel obeyed his voice and kept his covenant they would remain a kingdom of priests and holy nation unto him israel often wavered in devotion to god some 800 years before christ god anointed the prophet isaiah to foretell israel's spiritual blindness that would come upon them as a result of their rebellion to his holy covenant and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed then in jeremiah's day about 600 years before christ the lord himself called his people backsliding israel israel had some godly leaders such as joshua samuel david solomon hezekiah and josiah but the majority were evil men who led god's people into evil idolatrous lifestyles israel's disobedience though could not override god's grace to them nor could it hinder his amazing plan of redemption for all nations in his grace 42 generations after abraham god sent his promised son jesus christ to redeem israel from their sins and fill their souls with the holy spirit jesus was the fulfillment of god's promises to abraham to bless his seed and all nations messiah was god's antidote for their sin problem note specifically jesus's command for his disciples to preach to israel and not the other nations which are all bundled together in one group called gentiles matthew 10 verses 5 through 7 says these 12 jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand sadly israel rejected their messiah their antidote their literal words were away with him away with him crucify him we have no king but caesar the once kingdom of priests rejected their king john 1 verse 11 reads he came unto his own and his own received him not consequently god gave israel what they wanted unbelief due to their disobedience most israelis were blinded to jesus as messiah god then chose to temporarily put spiritual blindness upon backslidden israel so he might save the gentiles giving them an opportunity for eternal salvation it's imperative to realize the gentiles are not israel as some churches believe israel is forever her own independent nation before god and man due to the abrahamic and mosaic covenants numerous scriptures clearly state israel is spiritually blind jesus and paul leave no confusion about this all four gospels matthew 13 verses 14 and 15 mark 4 verses 11 through 12. luke 8 verse 10 john 12 40. record jesus quoting isaiah 6 verses 9 and 10 as you've already read while in rome witnessing about christ jews some rejected paul's teachings causing him to quote isaiah 6 9-10 in acts chapter 28 verses 25-28 and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paude spoke in one word well spake the holy ghost by isaiah the prophet unto our father saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive for the heart of this people is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it the apostle paul wrote four scriptures in romans 11 verses 7 through 10 and verse 25 explaining israel's blindness paul says an elected remnant group of israel received christ and the rest were blinded to fulfill isaiah 29 verse 10 and psalm 69 verses 22 through 23 the epigraph romans 11 25 denotes god's purpose in blinding israel so he could save the gentiles but the reason israel was blinded was because they stumbled at the stumbling stone meaning they failed to believe in christ when israel rejected faith in christ god blinded them romans 9 verses 31-33 declare this truth but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling stone as it is written behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed it's apparent in romans 11 that israel's blindness is going to be taken away in the future and shall be grafted back into god's blessings romans 11 verse 27 teaches the merciful god is going to remember his covenant and take away israel's sins but many remaining questions need answered regarding the current 2000 year period of blindness the confusion about israel's blindness the confusion surrounding israel's blindness centers on whether or not spiritually blinded jews can be saved while awaiting a messiah as they currently reject jesus christ the true messiah this question covers the salvation of all blinded jews who've lived for the past two thousand years including those alive when jesus walked the earth is it possible blinded jews from jesus day can be saved can blinded jews living now be saved the revelation of the mystery of israel's blindness is that the covenant keeping god still saves blinded jews who faithfully follow old testament commands promising them white robes of eternal life biblical evidence for the revelation about israel's blindness six biblical evidences solidify the fact even blinded jews can be saved jesus's prayer for forgiveness paul's romans 11 teaching foreshadowing in the life of joseph the fifth seal god's righteous judgment based upon knowledge and god's unconditional covenant with israel through abraham jesus's prayer for forgiveness while hanging on his cross jesus christ uttered forgiveness rather than condemnation in luke 23 34 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots this is amazing grace although his own people according to the flesh called for his blood he breathed mercy instead of judgment blinded jews from jesus day could be saved jesus's words reveal why some blind jews from his time period could still be saved they didn't know what they were doing the principle is that spiritually blind jews cannot fully understand the consequences of rejecting christ just as a natural blind man innocently trips unawares over an object in his path so some of the blinded jews unintentionally stumbled over jesus's life actions and words no doubt some in the crowd calling for jesus crucifixion knew what they were doing like judas iscariot knew he was selling out messiah a holy man psalm 69 verses 20 through 28 says this group will have their names removed from the book of life as will judas's scare it but some in the multitude ignorantly got caught up in the moment and joined the mob unintentionally for this group jesus prayed for mercy jesus wouldn't pray for their forgiveness in vain truly jesus knew god heard his every prayer god definitely heard jesus's prayer and will pardon the blinded jews who didn't know what they were doing when they turn their backs on their own savior god's forgiveness is so great he pardons jesus's own disciples who deserted him in his greatest hour of trial the crucifixion except john who is present at the cross paul's romans 11 teaching paul's teaching in romans 11 provides four foundational truths regarding israel's blindness the blinded israelis are not forsaken for all time verses 1 and 11. god is saving gentiles while israel is blinded verses 11 and 15. spiritual blindness is temporary not permanent verses 23 and 26 spiritual blindness is only set in on part of israel not the believing remnant verse 25 only part of israel is blinded to christ's identity as messiah paul calls the part that believes in jesus as christ the remnant in romans 11 verse 5. even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace the apostle uses himself as an example of a jew who believes in christ in verse 1 calling himself an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin a small remnant of jews in paul's day believed in christ as messiah and it's still possible for a jewish remnant to see or believe in christ today despite the majority of israelis being blinded god has not completely forsaken israel for all time twice paul says god forbid that he would cast away his people and that they would stumble and fall completely away from god's grace paul says the jews are provoked to jealousy as they see the gentiles receiving god's salvation that was first sent to them israel experiences temporary spiritual blindness romans 11 23 says israel will eventually overcome unbelief in christ and shall be grafted in for god is able to graft them in again observe paul never condemns blinded israel like a broken off branch blinded israel is detached from the god tree meaning they cannot possess god's eternal life the baptism of the holy spirit while living on earth see chapter 6 after the last gentiles are saved israel's spiritual blindness will end and all israel shall be saved which revelation 7 verse 4 tells us is the 144 thousand jews based upon romans 11 verse 11 and 15 god is focusing on saving or reconciling the gentiles while the majority of israel is blinded shortly before his crucifixion in luke 21 verse 24 jesus foretold god's desire to save gentiles and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled god is graciously giving the gentiles an opportunity to be saved after israel had nearly 1 500 years with salvation through moses's law only god knows how much time the gentiles have left to be saved foolish men constantly guess and miss the date of jesus return to earth but once the last day is fulfilled jesus is returning to catch away his gentile wife and then restore blindness free salvation back to israel foreshadowing in the life of joseph the life of joseph son of jacob foreshadows the life of jesus christ and shows how the blinded jews can be saved at the white throne judgment despite rejecting christ during their lifetimes joseph's life before slavery types jesus's first coming to earth jacob especially loved his son joseph as the heavenly father loved christ gifted in spiritual things joseph shared prophetic dreams with his brothers who despised them christ's spiritual gifts of preaching and prophesying to israel caused them to despise his words jacob sent joseph to check on his brethren but they sold him to egypt god sent christ to israel but they sold him out to rome while in egypt they imprisoned joseph on a false accusation rome arrested jesus on a false accusation while in prison joseph ministered to two prisoners one lived and one died while on the cross jesus hung between two prisoners one received a promise of eternal life in paradise and the other lost joseph was resurrected out of prison and set as second in command to pharaoh jesus was resurrected out of the tomb and ascended to the right hand of the majesty on high while second in command joseph married an egyptian or gentile wife jesus now offers salvation to the gentiles and the saved make up his spiritual wife the new testament gentile church during the famine joseph's brothers went to egypt to get food but were blinded to their brother's identity yet he's merciful to them this example demonstrates that jesus will be merciful to his blinded brethren israel joseph eventually revealed himself to his brothers and explained god allowed them to sell him into slavery in order to save lives during the famine in type jesus's crucifixion saved all people gentiles and jews during the spiritual famine of the seven church ages as joseph established his brothers in goshen jesus will reveal himself to the jews during the tribulation period and re-establish them in their promised land jerusalem the white throne judgment of all nations in matthew 25 verses 31 to 46 shows how christ mercifully grants eternal life to surprised doers of good works who were seemingly blinded to his identity during their lives surely this group includes the nation of israel as all nations are gathered there the blessed group of the saved were unaware of christ's presence living inside his followers the brethren in other words they were blinded to christ's body his church his bride but christians like paul are not blinded to other christians philippians 4 verse 3 says that paul knew clement and a group of christian women were saved and their names are in the book of life according to jesus this saved group in matthew 25 helped him by helping his followers they gave food drink shelter and clothing to christians they made sick visits and prison visits to christians they were blind to the fact they were actually helping jesus but jesus like joseph was not blinded to their identities and remembered their good works to his church and so obtained mercy jesus's gracious judgment reminds you of peter's words in acts 10 verses 34 and 35 how god accepts all persons from all nations who fear him and work righteousness the fifth seal the heavenly altar of incense and locations after death the fifth seal in revelation 6 verses 9 through 11 is irrefutable evidence that god saves blinded jews for the souls under the altar can be only israelis four details prove this group is israel first they are martyrs slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held notice they are not slain for the testimony of jesus john the author of revelation is described as having both the testimony of the word of god and also of jesus christ in revelation chapter 1 verse 2 and verse 9. john was a christian and believe both the word of god old testament and the testimony of jesus christ the new testament but the fifth seal group faithfully believe the word of god or old testament unto their deaths having no testimony of jesus showing they are jews second they call for vengeance and judgment upon those who killed them but christians do not call for vengeance as both stephen acts 7 6 and christ luke 23 34 pleaded for god's forgiveness upon their persecutors at their deaths third white robes were promised to them after their deaths but christians have white robes representing eternal life clothing their souls while they live on earth jesus says the holy ghost-filled christian is endued or clothed with power upon receiving the holy spirit paul tells believers to put ye on the lord jesus christ in romans 13 verse 14. christ offers a reminder of his imminent return in revelation 16 15 telling saints to keep their garments behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame note also how jesus promises these fifth seal israelis robes just as joseph gave his brother new raiment in genesis 45 verse 22 after making himself known to them fourth revelation 6 11 says there are more fellow servants or brethren of these jews who must be martyred to fulfill a divine appointed number god alone knows this number because only he can calculate the punishment upon israel for crucifying their own sinless blameless messiah matthew 27 verse 25 says israel called for jesus's blood to be upon them and their children and tragically it has been more than six million jews died in the holocaust and thousands if not millions more have given their lives to fulfill this self-inflicted punishment yet the merciful god of heaven will end this persecution at the conversion of the 144 000 jews while granting eternal life to all jewish martyrs who remain faithful to the word of god additionally the fifth seal helps clarify the three different locations for souls after death under the altar of incense paradise and prison none need wonder where his soul will go upon death first faithful blinded jews find shelter for their souls under the altar in heaven near the throne of christ the lord what sweet confirmation for us to know how near jewish martyrs are to christ the one who kept and fulfilled the old covenant and that they can cry out loudly to him and be heard three revelation scriptures describe this golden altar of incense as having four horns while fiery incense is offered upon it with the prayers of the saints recall moses's earthly altar of incense was based upon this heavenly incense altar the altar of incense was the closest piece of furniture to the holiest of holies yet it was separated by the veil likewise in heaven the altar of incense is followed by a veil and a holiest of holies hebrews 6 verse 19 reads which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil saved blinded jews are close to christ but distance remains between them and the lord accompanying the altar of incense there must be another heavenly altar where jesus's blood lays as an atonement for sin two revelation scriptures show a portion of jesus's blood is present in heaven revelation 5 verse 6 pictures the heavenly christ manifested as a slain lamb and revelation 19 13 says jesus has a visible vesture dipped in blood when he returns on a white horse for the battle of armageddon as colossians 1 verse 14 declares we presently have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins just as the earthly tabernacle of moses required blood for atonement so does the heavenly paradise a location even nearer to christ's heavenly throne then the souls under the altar is the second location souls go but only born against souls since the altar of incense is where jews go who were never born again by the baptism of the holy ghost it must also be the location where christians go who were never born again for any believer not born again lacks a white garment jesus labels these christians as foolish virgins in matthew 25 verses 1 1-13 the wise virgin christians possess the oil representing the holy ghost baptism paradise's location used to be in the heart of the earth called abraham's bosom by jesus luke 23 verse 43 teaches jesus took the repentant thief on the cross to paradise after their deaths on good friday but upon christ's resurrection he led the previously captive believers into his eternal captivity and they resurrected in glorified bodies appearing to many in jerusalem forty days later jesus ascended to heaven with the resurrected saints moving paradise close to his heavenly throne in second corinthians 12 verses 1 through 4 paul says he was caught up by vision to paradise also known as the third heaven this is where jesus lives with the heavenly host and believers the first heaven must be the atmosphere around the earth and outer space including all the remainder of our universe is the second heaven prison also called hell in luke 16 verse 23 is located in the heart of the earth and is the third location only disobedient unbelieving souls go there upon death jesus story of the rich man and beggar lazarus in luke 16 verses 19-31 vividly describes this prison of torment in which constant flames discomfort the unjust in first peter 3 verses 18 through 20 peter teaches jesus preached to the disobedient souls in prison when he descended to hell following his crucifixion observe the loving kind jesus rebuking and preaching to the eternal lost souls in prison these souls have no more chance to be saved and yet jesus preaches to them no doubt chiding them for rejecting noah and all the other prophets jesus sent to warn them of judgment for their unrepentant hearts all disobedient souls in prison remain there until the white throne judgment when jesus will command hell to deliver all these prisoners to their heavenly court trials to receive punishment according to their works the bible describes the conditions immediately after a person dies or gives up the ghost first angels will usher the human spirit to enter the third heaven for the believer or to hell's prison for the unbeliever luke 16 verses 22 and 23 say the righteous beggar lazarus was carried by the angels into abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom since abraham's bosom or paradise moved its location to the third heaven believers now ascend to heaven rather than descending to the heart of the earth faithful jews and foolish virgin christians go under the altar of incense while holy ghost filled christians go very near to jesus throne in paradise a second condition is the human spirit retains its character memories convictions and feelings whether good or bad in the fifth seal faithful jews cry out for vengeance death never took away their desire to be avenged death doesn't change a person's character either in luke 16 jesus says the rich man in hell retained his unreasonable conviction that his brothers would repent and be saved if they saw miracles but abraham corrected him saying his brothers would not believe a miracle if they would not hearken to moses law witnessing a miracle doesn't save a person's soul faith and repentance lead to salvation third holy ghost-filled believers receive a new celestial or heavenly body also called a theophany after death paul in second corinthians 5 verses 1 through 8 says our celestial bodies await us and are eternal in the heavens a perfect sinless theophany body awaits every holy ghost-filled christian paul says we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven christians long to live in an eternally pure and holy body the apostle likens this eternal body as clothing without the baptism of the holy ghost a soul is naked before god void of god's own life second corinthians 5 3 states if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked the saved under the altar of god faithful jews and christians who are not born again will be void of a celestial body but will be given it later at the white throne judgment fourth holy ghost filled believers are present with the lord after leaving their mortal bodies paul writes we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord it is uncertain how much or how often you will see jesus as he is constantly making intercession for saints behind the veil but we will be present with him nonetheless according to paul obviously time moves differently in the heavenly dimensions as god created time and works sovereignly within it not being bound by it fifth you'll reunite with saved family members and recognize other believers you've never met before concerning family reunions after the death of the newborn child produced through david and bathsheba's adulterous act david said i shall go to him but he shall not return to me this is a great consolation to any parent who has lost a child through tragedies like diseases accidents miscarriages and more as a believer you'll instantly recognize saints who live before you during the mount transfiguration vision in matthew 17 peter james and john recognized moses and elijah men who lived 1500 and 900 years beforehand respectively matthew 27 53 says after jesus's resurrection many of the old testament saints raised with him and went into the holy city and appeared unto many for certain god's spirit within you will cause you to know another believer who possesses the holy spirit lastly believers will bask in and join in the angels unceasing worship and glory revelation 4 verse 8 says the four beasts rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come christ is the focus and recipient of this devoted worship he alone is worthy to receive all praise loud voices exclaim worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing in stark contrast unbelievers and even a group of fallen angels suffer torment by flames in the darkness of hell awaiting judgment god's righteous judgment based upon inherent knowledge building upon the fifth seal god's righteous judgment based upon each person's inherent knowledge supports the truth that blinded jews can be given eternal life the fifth seal tells us blinded jews are saved because god helped them have an overcoming testimony revelation 12 11 reiterates this saying they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony it's true all are saved by grace through faith but god honors a person's choice for he cannot force anyone to accept grace and faith each person's free moral agency either accepts or rejects faith after accepting a believer has a testimony report or witness in both heaven and earth in the case of blinded jews they could only understand the old testament and god will judge them accordingly if they accepted faith in god's covenant like noah abraham moses and others they will be saved rotating to a broader perspective all humanity will be judged by what they knew about god and how they reacted to it men can also be judged by what they didn't know if they failed to seek god for it scripture calls this sin neglect as both salvation and a person's individual gifts from god can be neglected christ's words in matthew 25 verses 20 and 21 and luke 12 verses 47 and 48 declare a person as rewarded or judged based upon their actions in response to their knowledge of god's will jesus said the following to the servant who doubled his five talents well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things this good servant knew what christ wanted done and did it well so he was rewarded with responsibility for many things luke 12 verses 47 and 48 say there are punishments for those who knew god's will and refused to do it and those who didn't know god's will it's easy to understand punishments for those who purposely refuse god's will jesus affirms this in matthew 7 verse 21 saying only those who do the will of god enter heaven why would christ punish someone who didn't know his will the answer is the group had the opportunity but never asked god to know his progressive or future will see chapter 11. they cared so little about spiritual things they never took time to pray and seek god the reality is that all who want to know god on every continent in every language can know him every person has an awareness of god and a spiritual thirst for him christ promised all who asked would receive luke 11 verse 10 reads for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened it's jesus's unveiling promise to reward everyone who seeks him romans 2 verses 14 and 15 teaches a universal responsibility to god's law paul says god wrote his law upon every man's conscience therefore all men are without excuse on judgment day because of two things god's inward law manifest in them and the witness of god's power in creation in each soul is the god knowledge of good and evil each soul observes the undeniable power and beauty of god's creation and must choose whether to respond in love and appreciation or hatred and skepticism blinded jews from the days of jesus's earthly ministry through today will be fairly judged by the law of moses they heard not jesus's teaching if they were ignorant of it each person being judged by their knowledge will get a fair trial from the righteous one god's covenants with israel through abraham as seen in the fifth seal god mercifully grants blinded jews eternal life because of his covenants with abraham and his offspring israel genesis 12 verses 1 through 9 records god's unfailing promises to abraham his family's possession of canaan's land and the blessings for every nation abraham and his seed are god's chosen people perpetually and through their family the entire world is blessed undoubtedly the amount of blessings within the covenant were based upon conditions as genesis 18 verse 19 says abraham's children after him must keep the way of the lord that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him god foreknew the small remnant of abraham's seed he could use to fulfill his promises deuteronomy 11 verses 26 through 28 records god's conditional promises spoken with if as moses ministers to abraham's seed behold i set before you this day a blessing and a curse a blessing if you obey the commandments of the lord your god which i command you this day and a curse if you will not obey the commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known a thousand years after abraham his seed israel possessed the promised land yet they corrupted themselves through idolatry abraham seed erroneously said god had forsaken them and forgotten about them but the israeli prophet isaiah recorded jehovah's comforting words for the rebellious people in isaiah 49 verses 13 through 16. sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet i will not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me god promises israel he can never forsake nor forget them by saying they are engraved upon his hands jesus's nail prince which thomas needed to see to believe in his resurrection would be god's proof of his unfailing covenant with israel the cross proves that his faithfulness and compassion is strong like a nursing mother's love for her baby even in the midst of israel's rebellion a mother's love is deep but there could be no deeper devoted love than jesus dying in our place 200 years after isaiah the prophet jeremiah reiterated god's faithful love for israel in beautiful terms jeremiah 31 verses 31-34 records god's promise to give israel new covenant which was preached by jesus and his disciples afterwards jeremiah declared israel would never cease from being god's nation and he'd never cast them off thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts is his name if those ordinances depart from before me saith the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord god attempts to convince backslidden israel of his love by referencing the steadfastness of the sunlight moon stars and oceans since these ordinances never cease god's love for israel will never cease if anyone is able to measure the heavens god will cast off israel but as the heavens are immeasurable so is god's love for abraham's seed israel indeed god's unconditional love for israel will be strong enough to grant salvation even to blinded jews covenants testaments and the gentile time period examining god's covenants testaments and the times of the gentiles will help you understand his dealings with all mankind in particularly the nation of israel it is the immutable power of god's covenants that allows even blinded israelis to be saved beginning with covenants and testaments these two words are synonymous meaning a compact or league the old testament uses only covenant never uses testament in the king james a total of 256 times the new testament uses both covenant and testament 24 and 13 times respectively the same greek word diotheky meaning arrangement a compact a covenant a testament is interpreted as both covenant and testament repeatedly in the new testament christians sometimes use dispensation and covenant interchangeably but their meanings are different dispensation's modern definition is a system of government at a particular time but in the greek lexicon a dispensation is a stewardship or an overseeing job the same greek word for dispensation is also used for stewardship in jesus's parable of the unjust steward in luke 16 verses 1-13 on the other hand a covenant is a compact or agreement some say there are multiple dispensations throughout human history and that is true if one is using the modern definition of dispensation but not true if using the scriptural one the king james mentions the word dispensation four times and paul is the only bible writer who uses it three of these verses point to one dispensation that belonged to paul the gentile dispensation of the gospel of jesus christ the subject of paul's dispensation is covered in chapter 3. the fourth mention of dispensation in ephesians 1 verse 10 speaks of god gathering everything in christ in the dispensation of the fullness of times paul says god has one dispensation or oversight of all time periods and he'll gather everything together in christ in the new jerusalem when all heaven and earth are subject to him returning to covenants paul points out god has multiple covenants not just one romans 9 verse 4 says who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises again in ephesians 2 verse 12 he writes that at the time you were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world how many covenants has god made with man scripture names eight covenants initiated by god and granted to man each covenant or compact established a new beginning for a group of people and is a further expression of god's love grace and faithfulness in biblical numerology the number eight represents new creation or new beginning as seen in the following examples god saved eight souls by water during the flood and gave humanity a new beginning in genesis 8 verse 18 and first peter 3 20. every male hebrew was circumcised on the eighth day representing their new beginning as part of abraham's covenant in genesis 17 verse 12. god forgave israel through sacrificial atonement giving them a new beginning as the glory of god fell on the eighth day of sacrificing in leviticus 9 verses 1 through 24 a leper was declared clean at the door of the congregation on the eighth day of his or her recovery a new beginning of cleanliness in leviticus 14 verses 10 and 11. israel held a holy convocation or sacred assembly as an extra sabbath day on the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles to mark the beginning of the civil year leviticus chapter 23 verses 33-44 david the youngest and eighth son was chosen by god as a man after god's heart to give israel a new beginning after king saul's failure in 1st samuel 13 14 and first samuel 16 verses 10 and 11. paralyzed aeneas was healed by peter in the eighth year of his infirmity as a new beginning of sound health in acts 9 33 paul lists eight things to meditate upon in order to renew your mind in philippians 4 verse 8. charity is the eighth and final attribute in the stature of a perfect man that makes you a new creature in christ jesus according to second corinthians 5 17 and 2 peter 1 verses 5 through 7. the late baptist minister clarence larkin 1850-1924 contributed much to the church's understanding of the eight covenants in his book dispensational truths some but not all of the following covenant details are referenced from larkin's great work for all eight covenants you discover when they were initiated their commands and conditions and their unique signs the edenic covenant is the first covenant found in genesis 1 verses 26 and 30 and genesis 2 verses 15-25 god initiated this covenant with adam and eve before sin entered humanity the first two unclothed humans lived in complete innocence and obedience as god graciously commanded them to reproduce and fill the earth with people subdue the earth and keep the garden and have dominion over the fish birds and all other living creatures man and animal were both limited to a vegetable diet the only condition for this holy covenant was adam and eve's abstinence from eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil chapter 9 reveals the true identity of the forbidden fruit it was not a physical fruit and god's secret behind the real identity of the two trees tree of life and tree of knowledge of good and evil as long as the couple kept this condition eternal life and peace was theirs within their bodies after eve was beguiled or deceived by the serpent into eating the forbidden fruit adam willingly sinned by partaking of the forbidden fruit plunging humanity into sin slavery to the devil ii peter 2 19 says for of whom a man is overcome of the same as he brought in bondage paul calls satan the god of this world in second corinthians 4 verse 4 and this was the moment he took that title after adam broke god's covenant the blessing of eternal life inside their bodies ended and death set in god drove adam and eve out of the garden and set cherubims with flaming swords to keep mankind from accessing the tree of life still the covenant's commands remained to reproduce subdue the earth and have dominion over all living things these covenant commands continue unending throughout all covenants including the eternal covenant because the eighth mirrors the sinless condition of the first the only difference is the eternal has no conditions since satan and sin are annihilated the adamic covenant is the second covenant found in genesis 3 verses 14-24 it was initiated by god's own animal sacrifice to make atonement for adam and eve's sin before sending them out of the garden god made coats of skins to cover adam and eve's newly discovered nakedness here adam and his offspring learned without shedding of blood there is no remission of sin by faith adam abel and their godly offspring understood how to offer offerings and gifts to god in this covenant god commanded curses and consequences for the serpent's beguiling and adam and eve's disobedience the serpent is cursed above all cattle and beasts forced to go upon his belly and eat dust note the serpent was an upright standing creature before this curse while speaking to the serpent in genesis 3 verse 15 god places enmity or hatred between he and the woman and their separate offsprings most importantly god declares the first prophecy of the cross of jesus christ four thousand years in advance promising a member of eve's seed would bruise the serpent's head while the serpent would bruise his heel jesus indeed began to destroy the works of the devil and his resurrection was a public triumph over every demon foe the genesis 3 verse 15 foretelling is expounded upon and fulfilled through four future covenants abrahamic mosaic davidic and the new covenant eve's not cursed but her consequences are multiplied in sorrow in conception and bringing forth children additionally her desire or longing is to be to her husband which means her desire was previously for someone other than her husband the serpent her last consequence is her husband will rule over her meaning adam is the leader in their marriage and she is under submission to him as taught in the new testament as well like eve adam's not cursed but the ground is cursed for his sake adam would bring forth food through sorrowful sweaty hard work battling thorns and thistles all conditions of the commands from this covenant remain to this day god's promise to send christ to bruise the serpent's head is his ultimate expression of love to us but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us the adamic covenant is fulfilled and ends when the eternal covenant begins because it seems the inhabitants of the earth during the millennium will still be farming and working the land it also seems deaths still occur the noahic covenant is the third covenant found in genesis 8 verses 20 through chapter 9 verse 17. nearly 1700 years after the adamic covenant the lord initiated this covenant immediately following noah's sweet smelling burnt offerings when he left the ark the lord's covenant is between him and all living things man and animals he promises never to curse the ground again nor smite every living thing through a flood but god will smite again all living things with fire in preparation for the eighth covenant according to second peter 3 verse 10 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with the great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up god blesses noah and his sons by reaffirming the be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth command he previously gave in the edenic covenant animals will continue to fear and dread mankind as man's dominion over all living things continues a new diet is allowed by god previously mankind were vegetarians man can now eat the flesh of animals but must abstain from eating their blood god also commands capital punishment to be established in human government in genesis 9 verse 6 saying whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood he shed for in the image of god made he man this law is carried out using much discretion in the fear of the lord as both moses and david killed men david indirectly killed uriah and yet god let them live romans 13 verse 4 shows capital punishment remaining in the new testament to conclude this covenant god provides the first token or sign for a covenant the rainbow the bow will be in the clouds and god will remember his covenant with man and all living things to never destroy the earth again through a flood all commands and conditions of the noah covenant remain to this day but it ends when the eternal covenant begins for there is no more death the abrahamic covenant is the fourth covenant found in genesis 12 verses 1 through 3 and genesis 17 verses 9-14 about 400 years after noah's covenant god initiated this covenant with abraham and his offspring only previous covenants were promises to all mankind but here god focuses on one family god confirmed his covenant with abraham through a blood sacrifice in genesis 15. even after abraham's death he visited abraham's son isaac and grandson jacob in order to confirm this covenant with their family the lord then focused in on one group of people to make a great nation through his holiness shortly after mankind's complete defiance at the tower of babel through the abrahamic covenant god created two groups of people jews and gentiles jews are descendants of abraham as the word jew is short for judah the tribe named after the great grandson of abraham gentiles encompass all other nations peoples and tongues the lord promised abraham to make a great nation of his seed make his name great bless him and all that bless him curse those who curse him and make him a blessing to all families of the earth like the noahic covenant the lord assigns a token for abraham's covenant but it is not in nature like the rainbow his everlasting token is in their flesh male circumcision abraham's covenant has supernaturally shaped and transformed human history during the seven years of famine in genesis 41 egypt was blessed and spared from destitution because they blessed joseph abraham's great-great-grandson under the faithful leadership of moses joshua david and solomon many of israel's enemies were cursed and defeated helping to make the nation independent and powerful in modern history the united states has become the world's superpower because of its judeo-christian foundation and initial adherence to god's laws the constitution and bill of rights are heavily influenced by the torah and pauline epistles america's prosperity has overflowed into nearly every other nation in part because of her continued support for israel although other nations have their needs met few experience the vast levels of freedom and prosperity as americans the nation of israel continues to experience prosperity and innovation because of god's faithfulness to abraham's covenant since becoming re-established as a sovereign state in 1948 israel has grown into a world leader in patents research entrepreneurship and innovation in recent years all men witness israel's innovation story is extraordinary chapter 3 expounds on god mysteriously and graciously opening up this covenant to the gentiles as faith in christ makes a believer abraham's spiritual seed israel is abraham's natural seed or offspring faith in jesus christ makes a believing jew or gentile a member of abraham's spiritual seed galatians 3 7 proclaims know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham since abraham's true seed is spiritual the circumcision token is now spiritual paul calls it the inward circumcision of the heart in romans 2 verse 29 all conditions and commands from this covenant remain to this day however as great as the abrahamic covenant was and is it lacks a solution to man's sin problem the answer is total forgiveness through jesus's blood the greatest of all blessings two covenants though preceded the new with important purposes the abrahamic covenant began some 1900 years before christ and ends when the eternal covenant begins because its purpose will be fulfilled all alive then will already be eternally blessed with eternal life the mosaic covenant is the fifth covenant found in exodus chapters 20 through 40 and deuteronomy 30 verses 1 through 10. about 400 years after abraham god initiated this covenant with israel generally referred to as the law through moses on mount sinai in exodus 24 moses sprinkles the people with blood and joining them to god's covenant moses law can be divided into three groups moral ten commandments civil between hebrews and ceremonial levitical priesthood the ceremonial law includes the creation of a priesthood to order worship in the tabernacle god called israel to be a kingdom of priests the ark of the covenant symbolizes this covenant representing the presence of god aaron's rod that budded a pot of manna and moses's two tables of commandments were placed inside the ark these three articles foretold the new testament blessings of resurrection believing the original truth and the holy ghost seal respectively like the two previous covenants this oath has a sign sabbath keeping israelis worked for six days of the week but were forbidden to work on the seventh because the lord made the earth in six days and rested on the seventh the entire chapter of deuteronomy 30 expresses god's unfailing commitment to israel despite his foreknowledge of her idolatry causing her to be scattered all over the world and rejecting the forthcoming messiah god promises to gather israel from all nations giving her a heart that completely loves him and causing her to forever possess the land of israel this covenant's purpose is described by paul in galatians 3 verse 24 as our schoolmaster to bring us to christ the law teaches how inherently evil we are to a holy god our sins demand a just penalty death truly the law was added because of transgressions the law was holy and just and good but also carried an insurmountable curse breaking one command imputed to you the same guilt as breaking all the commands james 2 verse 10 explains for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offended one point he is guilty of all all five offerings sin peace meal trespass and burnt and the vast amount required of each point us to a desperately needed once and for all sacrifice to put away all sin the law would continue till the seed should come the promised seed of the woman genesis 3 15 in the adamic covenant our need is fully satisfied in the new covenant through the death and resurrection of jesus christ leviticus 26 verses 41 and 42 highlights the principle that god's former covenant blessings remain true even in the current covenant god told israel through moses that they would possess the promised land but then fall away from his commands causing him to scatter israel among heathen nations but he promised to restore them to living in palestine when they confess their sins in humility israel's genuine repentance will cause god to say then will i remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the land god forever remembers his promises even during the period of moses covenant god still remembers and keeps the abrahamic covenant to give abraham seed the land of palestine based upon the condition of their humble obedience israel's humble confession of sin and subsequent possession of all of palestine is yet in the future to be fulfilled by the 144 thousand spirit-filled jews spoken of in revelation seven verses one through eight this mosaic covenant is the current covenant blinded israel is under at this moment because they rejected the new covenant preached by jesus peter paul and other remnant jews who accepted christ despite casting away the new covenant in the first century blinded israel retains god's blessings from all previous covenants mosaic abrahamic noic adamic and edenic any blinded jew will receive god's covenant blessings if he sincerely loves god and obeys him god cannot cast away all israel because he promised to bless and never forget faithful jews and he will keep his word the mosaic covenant began around 1 500 years before christ and ended at jesus resurrection for jesus followers romans 8 verse 4 explains christians observe and obey the righteousness of the law or moral commandments of the law through the holy spirit's power in the new covenant the mosaic covenants still continues though for the faithful blinded jews the davidic covenant is the sixth covenant found in second samuel 7 verses 4 through 17 and luke 1 verses 30-33 about 500 years after moses's covenant god initiates this oath to david through the prophet nathan just like the abrahamic covenant god again chooses to deal with one man and his offspring rather than making a worldwide covenant both covenants of abraham and david start with one man but extend to bless and impact the entire world in the davidic covenant god builds upon the mosaic covenant which established the law and priesthood through david god promises a kingship which points to the true king jesus christ who will someday rule all nations with a rod of iron in the millennium and new jerusalem nathan tells david god will establish the throne house and kingdom of his son solomon forever god says the same in psalms 89 verses 3 and 4. i have made a covenant with my chosen i have sworn unto david my servant thy seed will i establish forever and build up thy throne to all generations of course these promises were conditional and based upon solomon and his son's obedience as recorded in second chronicles 7 verses 18 through 22 verses 19 and 20 read but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have sanctified for my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it a proverb and a byword among all nations solomon's sins and the many sins of his royal offspring eventually turned israel away and god plucked up the nation and scattered her abroad the last king of israel of david's seed was zedekiah who was expelled from his throne around 587 bc since that moment there has not been a son of david ruling in israel god has postponed his promises until jesus's second coming ezekiel 21 verses 26 and 27 records this showing how the crown would be removed out of israel until he come whose right it is until jesus returns thus saith the lord god remove the diadem and take off the crown this shall not be the same exalt him that is low and abase him that is high i will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is and i will give it to him god will never do away with david's house the gracious lord promised to preserve the house of david because of his covenant promise in second chronicles 21 verse 7 how be it the lord would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he made with david and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons forever jeremiah 33 verses 17-26 further witnesses god's promises to david are steadfast god challenges jeremiah's hears to try to break the covenant of day and night to see if he will break his covenant with david certainly man cannot alter the repetition of day and night and so god will never alter his promises to david nor can man number the stars heavenly hosts and sands of the seas and thus man cannot count how greatly god will multiply the seed of david a few chapters previous to this god tells jeremiah he will not cast away israel because his faithfulness to them is like the continual ordinances of day and night moon and stars and ocean waves the prophet isaiah and angel gabriel give us further details about the deeper meaning of god's forever covenant with david the david covenant can be fulfilled only through jesus christ who came through the seed of david according to the flesh isaiah 9 verses 6 and 7 says the messiah will have an unending throne and kingdom of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the angel gabriel affirms this telling mary that her son jesus would be given the throne of his father david to reign over the house of jacob forever with an unending kingdom the everlasting throne speaks of jesus ruling in the eternal covenant in the new jerusalem thus the david covenant will be renewed once jesus begins reigning on the earth during the millennium and will continue without end throughout eternity it is noteworthy that the unending throne and kingdom of israel was first offered to saul but his disobedience and rebellion caused god to choose david and his seed as the kingly family first samuel 13 13 reads and samuel said to saul thou has done foolishly thou has not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel forever only god knows the great blessings and rewards men lose due to their selfish disobedience the new covenant is the seventh covenant found in jeremiah 31 verses 31-34 and luke 22 20 nearly 1 000 years after the davidic covenant god institutes this covenant through jesus shed blood instantly making moses his covenant a thing of the past the name new covenant contrasts with the old covenant given to moses hebrews 8 13 reads in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away the law was the old covenant but grace is the new covenant in luke 22 20 messiah says the cup of the lord's supper is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you christ's death through his blood sacrifice and his resurrection caused this testament to take effect according to hebrews 9 verses 15 through 17. verses 16 and 17 say this testament went into effect after jesus death for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth on calvary jesus skin was opened up so much that his bare bones were exposed god's sacrifice had to be torn open to institute the new covenant because previous covenants were confirmed with torn apart sacrifices noah and moses offered sacrifices from torn beasts all five of abraham's sacrifices were torn apart before god's spirit passed between the pieces the pardoning power of jesus's holy sinless blood cannot be overemphasized while other covenants were confirmed with shed blood the coats of skins for adam and eve noah's burnt offering after exiting the ark abraham's sacrifice of five divided animals and moses is sprinkling the people with blood only the new covenant completely abolishes sin and a sinner's guilty conscience the sin question am i truly forgiven in god's sight is settled once and for all through jesus's all-sufficient sacrifice for those who truly love christ and confess their sins god forgives all their sins and trespasses colossians 2 13 says he's forgiven you all trespasses not some all jesus blood is the perfect remedy for sin making the new covenant the final covenant that requires blood the eternal covenant and eden covenant are bloodless hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21 says jesus blood is the blood of the everlasting covenant and makes believers perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight the benefit and blessing of jesus's precious blood makes the new covenant a better covenant established upon better promises each covenant god establishes gets progressively greater and concerning forgiveness of sins the new covenant is god's triumphant masterpiece accompanying the better promises comes greater responsibility for men to receive this covenant the consequence for turning down such powerful sin cleansing blood is sore punishment hebrews 10 29 says of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace god's spirit of grace will cause the new covenant good news to be preached and offered to every nation before the end time the lord has appointed a day of judgment to bring closure to this covenant and his son's righteous blood will be the standard for judgment acts 17 verse 31 promises because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he raised him from the dead the baptism of the holy ghost is the sign of the new covenant also called a seal or mark in the believer's soul just like the rainbow and circumcision were tokens of previous covenants the holy ghost seal is the new testament token unlike the previous covenants the life of the sacrifice jesus spirit now comes upon the believer the new covenant was first sent to israel through jesus's earthly ministry but most israelis rejected messiah becoming spiritually blind god for knew israel's future allowing him to have mercy upon the gentiles for a season saving their souls through the new covenant see chapter 3 but the lord promised to return to blinded israel and give her another chance to receive the new covenant shortly after the rapture of the gentile church it is certain 144 000 redeemed guileless jews will stand with jesus christ on mount zion according to revelation 14 verses 1 through 5. this mountaintop experience is preceded by jesus revealing his identity to israel causing them to mourn in anguish upon realizing they crucified their messiah two thousand years ago zechariah 12 verses 10 through chapter 13 verse 1 says jews will go from house to house mourning after realizing their ancestors pierce jesus but then christ opens a fountain of grace and forgiveness for them then romans 11 verses 26 and 27 is fulfilled and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of zion the deliverer and he shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins the new covenant began at jesus resurrection and ends after the white throne judgment because blood for forgiveness is no longer needed death hell and satan have all been cast into the lake of fire sin is forever defeated the eternal covenant is the eighth covenant found in isaiah 65 17 and revelation 21 verses 1-5 god promises this unending covenant as a return to the sinless conditions of the edenic covenant god and man will again enjoy close fellowship but now it will be impossible for it to end because all god's enemies are destroyed isaiah 65 17 offers the first glimpse of this covenant saying for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind new heavens and a new earth simply means renovation and restoration it doesn't mean god is going to blow up this earth and make a new one no god is going to redeem this earth and the heavens by holy fire second peter 3 verse 10 reads but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up revelation chapters 21 and 22 build upon isaiah's inspired promises in breathtaking detail notably revelation 21 verses 1 through 5 says and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful indeed the new jerusalem is a significantly better eden compare the two for a moment god's two children adam and eve shared a garden now god's innumerable children share a massive city eden had a deadly adversary but new jerusalem has only peaceful allies satan entered and brought a curse in eden but he'll never step foot in the new jerusalem and there will be no curses there eden had a nightfall but our future home has no night there the lamb our day star is the light in that city the tree of life was just one of many trees in eden but here it is elevated above all trees to the pinnacle of the city and so large until it encompasses both sides of the pure river of water of life this city is divine and unique god is in everything in this city god is all and in all first corinthians 15 28 says and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all the city's precious stones great high wall 12 gates 12 foundations and streets of pure transparent gold all tell god's matchless redemption story there'll be no need for men to build a temple for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it peter says the new jerusalem is the home of holiness he writes nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness finally a kingdom of kindness a reign of righteousness since you're drawn to this kingdom peter asks you to be diligent now to live without sin in true holiness second peter 3 14 says wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless daniel's 70 week prophecy many struggle to both understand the meaning and placement of the daniel's 70 weeks prophecy yet it directly connects to israel's current blindness to the gospel where does this prophecy fit in the timeline of god's covenants due to israel's disobedience in the mosaic covenant god expelled his people from their land into heathen lands such as babylon and assyria judah's last king zedekiah was finally expelled from jerusalem in 587 bc during the babylonian exile as a young man the prophet daniel was one of the prisoners led away into captivity to babylon despite experiencing constant communion with god through prayer and seeing his miraculous power in being delivered from a den of lions daniel aged into an old man and yearned for the time his people would return to their promised land in daniel chapter 9 you find daniel reading jeremiah's writings see jeremiah 25 verses 8 through 14 and the holy spirit gives him understanding that israel's 70-year period of expulsion from their land is coming to an end verses 4 through 19 record daniels seeking god's face through fasting and intercessory prayer he begins by worshiping god and thanking him for his mercy and the keeping of his covenants in humility the prophet confesses his sins and the sins of israel specifically stating how they broke moses's covenant and their just punishment the angel gabriel appears to daniel in verses 20 through 29 telling him how he is loved in heaven and his prayers were heard gabriel also says he is sent to give daniel's skill and understanding concerning the matter of israel's return to judea the 70 weeks prophecy includes verses 24 through 27 70 weeks equals 490 years because a week and means seven years genesis 29 verse 27 explains that jacob fulfilled rachel's week by working seven additional years for the right to marry her so 70 weeks means 70 times 7 equaling 490 years daniel 9 24 introduces the prophecy upon thy people jews and upon thy holy city jerusalem it records gabriel's list of six things that must happen at the end of a 490 year period so daniel's prayers for national and spiritual restoration can be fulfilled first to finish the transgression israel's spiritual blindness causes transgressions or rebellion the two thousand year rebellion ends when the jews with new sight except christ as their messiah second to make an end of sins sin is ultimately unbelief and israel's sin will end when they see the resurrected jesus physically appear to them just as joseph revealed himself in person to his 11 brothers in egypt third to make reconciliation for iniquity israel's iniquity is pardoned in one day when the thousand jews are born again by the holy ghost who institutes the ministry of reconciliation fourth to bring in everlasting righteousness the one thousand-year millennium is the time of righteousness when the glory of the lord fills the earth and satan is bound and unable to tempt anyone according to habakkuk 2 verse 14 and revelation 20 verses 1 through 7. to seal up the vision and prophecy in hebrew seal means to be stopped showing daniel's vision and this prophecy is complete at jesus's second coming daniel 12 4 expresses the correct meaning of the 70 weeks prophecy would not be known until today the time of the end sixth to anoint the most holy at the beginning of the millennium ezekiel 43 verses 1 through 5 says the newly rebuilt jewish temple is anointed by the holy ghost as god's glory comes like a rushing mighty wind into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east the temple not king jesus needs anointed for jesus is already eternally anointed by the spirit christ never dies again living with all of heaven's power according to matthew 28 verse 18 and romans 6 verse 9. it's apparent none of these six events can happen until blinded israel gained spiritual eyesight through repentance and acceptance of jesus christ this monumental event takes place during the tribulation after the new testament church is raptured away to the marriage supper of the lamb and the completed three and a half year ministry of israel's two prophets moses and elijah in verses 25 through 27 of daniel chapter 9 the 490 year period is now divided up into three time periods seven weeks or 49 years 62 weeks or 434 years and one week seven years this is the key to understanding the prophecy the first two time periods seven weeks plus 62 weeks are combined to mark the point of jesus death then god cuts off israel for rejecting jesus essentially causing a two thousand year pause in this prophecy in order to save the gentiles the third period or seven years that remain occurred during the seven year tribulation period when god grafts israel back into his grace first time period of seven years in verse 25 gabriel tells daniel there will be seven weeks or 49 years until the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem and the street shall be built again and the wall even in troubles times according to larkin the starting date for this prophecy is 445 bc when artaxerxes longimanus king of persia ordered israel's temple to be rebuilt the temple was finished 49 years later in 396 bc in troubleless times nehemiah 4 verse 17 confirms the troublesome conditions of rebuilding the wall saying they which build it on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laid it every one with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon second time period of 434 years this period of 62 weeks is also placed in verse 25 and must be added to the first mentioned seven weeks or 49 years to know when the messiah would appear as king to israel daniel 9 25 says unto the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks john 12 13 captures the jewish multitude acknowledging jesus's royal princely position as their king only to crucify him within less than a week hosanna blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord then in daniel 9 26 the prophecy says messiah would be cut off but not for himself after the 62 weeks this means we must add the previous 7 weeks 49 years to these 62 weeks or 434 years jesus crucifixion was his being cut off in order to bear all humanity's sins christ died for us for our sins not his hebrews 9 28 explains so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation adding the 62 weeks plus 7 weeks yields 69 weeks or 483 years 434 plus 49 equals 483 when you begin at artaxerxes order in 445 bc and add 69 weeks or 483 years you come to the year 38 a.d as the date for jesus's crucifixion but there seems to be a problem jesus began preaching around 26 a.d and was crucified after his three and a half year preaching ministry in 30 a.d there's an eight year difference between 30 a.d and 38 a.d there are 475 years from 444 bc to 30 a.d but we need 483 years how can god's prophecy be short eight years a simple resolution matches the dates correctly two different calendars need examine to understand the prophecy solar and prophetic the solar calendar has 365 and one-fourth days per year while god's prophetic calendar has 360 days per year a prophetic year is shorter than a solar year as the solar calendar matches the amount of time it takes the earth to revolve once around the sun more time passes on the prophetic calendar than the solar because its years are shorter examining the prophetic year we know god has 12 months in his year because solomon had 12 officers over israel each man his month in a year revelation 11 verses 2 and 3 show 42 months equals 1 260 days in god's prophetic calendar each month has 30 days 1260 divided by 42 equals 30. with these calculations verified by scripture you find the all-wise god hid the 483 prophetic years in man's 475 solar years isaiah 45 15 rightly declares thou art a god that hides thyself o god of israel the savior we must compare the number of days between the two calendars to see the time difference between them the solar's 365 and one-fourth days times 483 years equals 176 415.75 days god's prophetic calendar has 173 880 days 360 times 483 making the difference of 2005 days now divide this number by 360 days and you arrive at 7.04 years this means seven extra prophetic years passed on the prophetic calendar since it's a shorter year during the 475 solar years subtract the seven years from 38 a.d and you land at 31 a.d there seems to be one year remaining between jesus's historical crucifixion date of 30 a.d and 31 a.d keep in mind this extra year allows some wiggle room for the final six months or so of jesus ministry to be completed because we are not told jesus's exact age at the start of his preaching ministry luke 3 verses 21 through 23 gives jesus's general age about 30 years when he was baptized saying and jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age this extra time also gave extra grace for the elected believers to recognize jesus as messiah believing upon him and following his ministry finishing the latter details of daniel 9 26 we read and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined the prince in this verse is not the messiah for jerusalem the city in which was the temple of the sanctuary was destroyed and made desolate by titus's roman army in a.d 70. observe the 40-year probation period from the time israel crucified christ 30 a.d to the time titus came in 70 a.d 40 years later god did the same 40-year probation period with a generation who refused to possess the promised land after the exodus from egypt hebrews 3 17 reads but with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness like a school master putting a student in a timeout or detention and discipline god has put away or cast away israel from his new covenant blessings based upon their disobedience his focus has been on the gentile people from around 30 a.d to the date of this publication 2021 through israel's fall salvation has come unto the gentiles god has put nearly a 2 000 year long pause on daniel's 70-week prophecy to show his grace to the gentiles in other words there's a near 2000 year gap between the ending of the 69th week of daniel's prophecy and the beginning of the 70th week hosea 3 verses 4 and 5 beautifully foretell this long pause calling it many days for the children of israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without any ephod and without teraphim afterwards shall the children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days notice also hosea 3 verse 5 foretells israel's return to the lord paul agrees saying god is able to graft them in again and will do that when the fullness of the gentiles be come in once every gentile believer is saved god will be done with the gentiles and will return to israel chapter 3 explains how god brought gentiles into his family and chapter 7 reveals god's historical dealings with them over the past two thousand years called the gentile church ages third time period of seven years this final week or seven year period is the seventieth week and is described in daniel 9 27 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the over-spreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate the he in this verse cannot be christ because our lord would not purposely overspread abominations upon jerusalem as is the purpose of this man following his move to stop jewish sacrifices the he is connected to the last person mentioned in the previous verse titus the roman general the prince that shall come the he in verse 27 is the person of the antichrist who will be the future roman leader chapter 9 covers scripture identifying the antichrist who will be a future pope of the roman catholic church the order of end time events begins with the holy ghost filled new testament church being raptured to meet christ and the dead in christ in the air jesus takes his faithful saints to heaven for the marriage supper the lamb with the gentile church ages being finished god returns to his people israel the great tribulation officially begins shortly after the rapture the pope antichrist makes a one week or seven year covenant with many world leaders including sinful israel the deceitful covenant is also called a peaceful league in daniel 11 verses 22 and 23 paul says the world will be crying for peace and safety and that is what the pope antichrist will promise to deliver the 144 000 faithful jewish remnant will refuse to bow to the pope's flatteries or not be part of this covenant it's likely all believing israelis use this time to return to living in the holy land due to the pope's worldwide peace agreement which includes the oft violent palestinians israel will rebuild its temple and re-establish animal sacrifices for the first time in almost 2 000 years christ foretold israel's time of repossession of jerusalem after the gentile rapture in luke 21 verse 24 and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled at the same time revelation 11 verses 1-13 describes the supernatural ministry of israel's two prophets in judea verses two and three say these spirit empowered men prophesy for three and a half years or half of the last or seventieth week of daniel the next verses five and six say their ministries match the old testament prophets moses and elijah who had power to withhold rain cause plagues and turn water into blood great torments will begin but the greatest judgments will happen after three and a half years because the 144 thousand israelis must first accept jesus as messiah and be sealed by the holy ghost revelation 7 verse 3 records the angels command to hold off on the cataclysmic judgments until israel is sealed saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of god in their foreheads halfway through the seven year covenant in the midst of the week daniel 9 verse 27 teaches the pope causes israel's sacrifices and oblations to cease this also marks the end of the three and a half year ministries of the two jewish prophets who were slain by satan the beast but are raised from the dead and raptured three and a half days later in the sight of their enemies a great earthquake strikes jerusalem causing a tenth of the city to fall along with seven thousand deaths the 144 thousand remnant see god's power and give him glory in the fear of the lord daniel 12 11 says one month or 30 days after the broken covenant rome sets up an abomination in israel's temple as the pope sits in the temple claiming he is god then rome and her allies send their armies to destroy israel but god will fight for his covenant people zechariah 12 9 foretells and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem in the darkest hour israel's rejected king jesus christ returns to earth to destroy the armies next zechariah 12 verse 9 through chapter 13 verse 6 says he physically reveals himself to his 144 thousand brethren and the spirit of grace and supplications pours upon them as a fountain washing away their blindness crying and mournful israelis weep from house to house devastated their race crucified their own messiah yet jesus brings healing and following their heartfelt repentance the 144 thousand are sealed with the holy ghost through jesus's amazing grace israel's blindness is over she was blind but now she sees the messiah has done it redeem both jew and gentile other events during the last three and a half years include the wrath of god upon beast worshipers who rejected jesus christ this divine wrath is spoken of in the sixth seal of revelation 6 verses 12 through 17. the indescribable punishments in the seven trumpets that are mentioned in revelation chapters 8 9 and 11 fall upon mankind the seven last plagues or vials are poured out according to revelation chapters 15 and 16. with the sixth seal nearly complete jesus returns from heaven as every eye on earth sees him as they wail beholding his fiery eyes the battle of armageddon ensues based upon revelation 16 verse 16 and revelation 19 verses 11 21. christ defeats the pope antichrist and the evil spirit possessing him and cast them both alive into the lake of fire the remaining time of the last three and a half year period of daniel's 70th week comes to a close heavenly fire cleanses the earth in preparation for the 1 000 year honeymoon christ and his bride walk upon a new sin cleansed earth gabriel's sixfold purpose is complete everlasting righteousness will reign the millennial temple will be anointed with christ's glory the earth is healed malachi 4 verses 1 through 3 is realized for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts the rewards for receiving the revelation of israel's blindness receiving the revelation of israel's blindness gains a few rewards first believers inherit god's blessings upon their lives when they bless blinded faithful israel this is because god's immutable covenant with abraham and his seed remains in effect as believers bless and pray for blinded jews the lord blesses their health finances family and more god's divine law remains regarding the power of the tongue death and life are in the power of the tongue genesis 12 13 holds true and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed your family can be one of the many blessed through abraham's obedience and now yours this doesn't mean believers bless the sinful acts of jews who live in sin and reject the mosaic covenant in fact paul dealt with these kind of jews saying as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father sakes the apostle knew some jews may be aggressively against jesus but later turned to him through god's election we know the same is true now most jews will sternly oppose jesus's cross but you know 144 000 will eventually experience the same grace you have through the resurrected messiah the other reward is one you possess internally hope for israel without this revelation your heart would feel devastated and despair for israel thinking she was cursed and bound for hell but through christ's spirit in your soul you realize jesus is the hope of israel paul writes it is the lord jesus christ which is our hope and with jesus's everlasting grace love and wisdom you know there is a reason to hope for israel's total restoration the consequences for rejecting the revelation of israel's blindness there are two possible consequences for rejecting the revelation of israel's blindness first many believe israel is forever cursed because they crucified jesus their own messiah this faulty belief leads some to curse jews in their angry hearts and with their words in these cases death is in the power of their tongues yet the spirit of god cannot curse what god is blessed permanent curses must be differentiated from temporary ones sinful jews and sinful gentiles too fall under temporary curses also called spiritual captivity by paul in 2 timothy 2 verse 26 and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will another common word for a temporary curse is an addiction before his miraculous conversion paul then known as saul was persecuting christians saul was hurting his own soul taken captive to the lies he believed such as jesus not being israel's messiah acts 26 verse 11 shows the belligerent saw punished christians and compelled them to blaspheme jesus when christ met him on the road to damascus he told saul he was kicking against the pricks this expression is taken from oxen who stubbornly kicked against the sharp goads used to prod them on the ox only hurt itself and gained no relief paul was doing the same by dragging christians to prisons he was stubbornly destroying god's joy peace and love for his life many people destroy their own spiritual blessings by cursing others including the jews anger towards jews because they crucified jesus should be abandoned because anyone in their position would have done the same do not let pride arise in your heart thinking you would have stopped the angry mob from killing jesus isaiah 53 verse 6 and 7 washes all pride from our hearts by declaring we hid as it were our face from him he was despised and we esteemed him not all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all if we had witnessed jesus's arrest flogging and crucifixion we would have hid too all of us would have forsaken him but this makes his grace so amazing in that he loved us first in our unlovable state a famous example of a christian leader holding the wrong view of jews is martin luther the great reformation leader of the 1500s repeatedly wrote with aggressive hostility towards jews calling them a serpent's brood anti-semitism is always wrong even in luther's case luther influenced some to expel jews and burn their synagogues these are stains on his testimony but luther can plead ignorance for not having the revelation of israel's blindness because all the mysteries of the bible could not be revealed until the end time daniel 12 4 says god's book is sealed until the time of the end had luther lived in our day he would have received the revelation of israel's blindness as evidenced by the truth that he received god's revelation about justification by faith in the time he lived second many gentile religious groups are guilty of confusing their position with israel's 144 thousand future saints these groups see blinded israel as totally forsaken with no hope and consider themselves the spiritual israel or 144 thousand remnant they go as far as believing genuine christians will suffer in the tribulation period which is unscriptural jehovah's witnesses are best known for believing their followers make up the 144 thousand believers they misunderstand romans 2 verses 28 and 29 by thinking they replace the jews applying these verses to themselves but paul was writing only to jewish-born men who later became christians as romans 2 verse 17 suggests behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and make us thy boast of god without god's true revelation most religious groups remain confused about their identity and position first corinthians 14 33 states for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all the churches of the saints god is not the author of confusion if these groups would sincerely ask god for true revelation he would give it to them jesus promises everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened conclusion the six biblical evidences reveal blinded jews can be saved and have a heavenly home under the altar of incense jesus will grant them white robes of eternal life at the right time in the meantime god's covenants are immutable and steadfast perhaps this generation will see the joseph anti-type jesus christ revealing his identity to his brethren the 144 thousand jewish remnant like joseph jesus will tell israel god planned out everything in order to save lives god uses all things for his glory even his own covenant people's rejection of their messiah to god be all power riches wisdom strength honor glory and blessing action steps to bless blinded israel number one first repent if you have any anger against israel or if you have cursed them god will forgive you and bless you in all your ways let your heart pity your blinded brethren knowing jesus's love and pity towards them number two pray for blinded israel to remain ever faithful to the law of moses pray for some of them to become christians as god's new testament holy ghost-filled church must be comprised of believers from all nations including israel according to revelation 7 verses 9 through 17. number 3 prayerfully reach out to jews you know and share the gospel as they might be part of the jewish remnant who are born again if they turn down jesus bless them anyway and encourage them to serve god in the full capacity of their faith
