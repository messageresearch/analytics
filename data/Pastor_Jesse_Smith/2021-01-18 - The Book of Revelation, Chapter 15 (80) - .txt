TRANSCRIPT
========================================
revelation chapter 15. the themes of this chapter include the seven last plagues the victors over the beast and the seven golden vials verse one introduces us to seven angels who have the seven last plagues verses two through four speak of a group of victors who got victory over the beast standing on the sea of glass in heaven who sing the song of moses and of the lamb jesus christ this group seems to be the 144 thousand israeli believers who receive jesus christ as their messiah during the tribulation period we could be wrong on this point but two details seem to connect this group to the 144 thousand which are first harps and second the song of moses concerning harps when christ stands with the 144 thousand jews on mount zion in revelation 14 verses 1 through 5 the voice of harpers harping with their harps is heard so in the book of revelation harps are connected to the jews second concerning the song of moses the city of jerusalem which will be home to the remnant of believing jews according to revelation 11 15 and 12 17 will receive two witnesses one of which is described as having the same ministry as moses in revelation 11 verse 6 and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will verses five through eight concludes the chapter by showing the open temple of the tabernacle in heaven one of the four beasts gives the seven vowels or bulls to the seven angels and these vowels or bowls are full of the wrath of god the symbols in key revelations include the sea of glass mingled with fire the beast the image of the beast the mark of the beast the number of the beast's name and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven the sea of glass mingle with fire is twice mentioned in revelation 4 verse 6 and 15 verse 2. it's located near jesus's throne and represents the old testament labor used by priests to wash themselves before coming closer to god in the holy place the heavenly sea of glass seems to represent god's plan to purge or wash his covenant people israel psalm 77 verse 19 says thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters in the case of revelation 15 verse 2 it's the 144 000 holy ghost-filled jews who are washed by jesus's blood the blood of the lamb when they accepted him on earth but are now in heaven they were victorious over the mark of the beast the fiery sea of glass in heaven means they endured the fiery tribulation period yet were victorious the beast is the antichrist or spirit of rome the spirit in the roman catholic church currently operating through and veil behind the united states according to revelation 13 verses 11 through 18. the 144 thousand faithful jews will get victory over the roman catholic church beast for they will not take the mark of the beast the image of the beast is a world council of false christian churches that will be granted great political power to cause anyone to be killed who will not worship and obey their unionized religious group the mark of the beast enforced by the ecumenical image of the beast is twofold either in the hand or on the forehead people cannot buy or sell without the mark the mark in the right hand represents doing the will of the religious council and the mark in the forehead represents believing the false doctrine of the false religious system the number of the beast is a number of a man which is 666 there have been many guesses as to the meaning of this number but there is only one man to be revealed in the near future who is closely associated with rome and has a connection to the number 666 that is the pope of the roman catholic church we come to this conclusion because the pope has been given the title vicarius philia day or vicar of gods the roman numerals for vicarius philia day add up to the exact number of 666 furthermore the second proof that the office of the pope will be the office of the person of the antichrist comes from revelation 17 which states that the woman who sits on seven mountains or hills the roman catholic church sits upon or rides the beast or demonic spirit of rome if the roman catholic church is the one controlling the fourth and final kingdom of rome then the pope who's the head of their false church is the only person who could rule the entire world as the person of the antichrist the open temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven gives us more insight into the design of heaven's sanctuary just as revelation chapters 4 5 6 7 8 14 and 16 do recall moses built his earthly tabernacle based upon the pattern of heaven's temple of the tabernacle of the testimony according to exodus 25 verse 40. based upon moses pattern we'd begin from the outside and work our way in it seems the sea of glass like under crystal was before the throne just as the laver was in the outer court in moses's tabernacle next we'd see the seven golden candlesticks revelation 1 verses 12 and 13 followed by the golden altar of incense revelation 8 verse 3 to represent the second court or holy place hebrews 6 verses 19 and 20 seem to teach the third core in heaven the holiest of holies has a veil like moses's tabernacle had thankfully for all sinners jesus has entered beyond this veil with his blood according to hebrews 7 verses 25 through 27 and hebrews 9 verse 12. jesus entered beyond the veil to the throne of god as high priest to always make intercession for you and i praise god for jesus blood speaking mercy for us in heaven according to hebrews 12 24 revelation 5 verse 6 and revelation 19 verse 13. jesus sits on his throne in the holiest of holies and there's four living creatures worshiping him just as ezekiel 1 verses 1 through 28 and revelation 4 verses 6 through 9 teach based upon revelation 15 verse 8 no man was able to enter the heavenly temple due to it being filled with the smoke from the glory of god the seven plagues or seven vows were soon to be poured out and the saved men in heaven would not have access to the temple as god's wrath was being poured out upon the earth it seems men did have access to the heavenly temple prior to the vows being poured out the timing of events is as follows the victors over the beast worshiping in heaven would have to take place sometime after revelation 14 verses 1 through 5 when they had been fully redeemed by christ marked by the holy ghost in their foreheads and literally standing on mount zion in jerusalem their heavenly worship seems to take place before the millennium since they speak in future tents of all nations coming to worship god revelation 15 verse 4 who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest isaiah chapter 2 verses 1 through 4 beautifully describe all nations worshiping jesus in the millennium the end of verse 1 says and all nations shall flow unto it the preparation of the seven vows would have to take place sometime after the seventh trumpets but before the battle of armageddon for the battle of armageddon is the last battle that slays nearly all men and women of the earth according to revelation 19 verses 18 and 19. if you'd like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of revelation please contact us god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your
