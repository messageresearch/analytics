[0:02] and then as they was blinded by God his
[0:05] grace reached down to him
[0:14] because all Israel will be saved
[0:21] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:23] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:26] this video is to prove hopefully once
[0:29] and for all by the grace of God that
[0:31] brother William Branham God's true
[0:32] Prophet did not plagiarize the fifth
[0:35] seal
[0:36] before I begin on the fifth seal I just
[0:38] want to remind the viewers that up to
[0:40] this point with the first four seals
[0:42] there are 26 differences between brother
[0:45] Branham and Charles tase Russell only
[0:48] and this is not counting the differences
[0:50] of the Branham had between Clarence
[0:52] Larkin and Uriah Smith on the first four
[0:55] seals I would imagine there'd be around
[0:57] 40 50 or more differences between these
[1:00] three men on just the first four seals
[1:03] only
[1:04] the accusation about the fifth seal
[1:08] one of brother Ram's accusers put out a
[1:10] video last year saying brother Branham
[1:13] plagiarized the fifth seal from Clarence
[1:15] Larkin
[1:16] the video said quote William Branham and
[1:18] Clarence Larkin have an identical
[1:20] interpretation of who the souls under
[1:22] the altar were how did Clarence Larkin
[1:25] get that Revelation in 1919 when the
[1:27] fifth seal was not open until 1963 was
[1:30] William Branham intentionally misleading
[1:32] his followers end quote
[1:36] so of course this is a false accusation
[1:38] my initial reaction is brother Branham
[1:41] and Larkin's teachings were similar in
[1:43] only one way on the fifth seal so they
[1:46] were identical in only one way and that
[1:48] was the identity of the souls but there
[1:52] were three other differences about the
[1:54] fifth seal that they disagreed on
[1:56] brother Ram's accusers are either
[1:58] purposely slandering brother Branham or
[2:00] they are incredibly shoddy and weak
[2:02] researchers with little to no
[2:05] understanding of what brother Branham
[2:06] actually taught about the fish seal
[2:09] here's three points about the accusation
[2:11] first Russell was not mentioned for the
[2:13] first time in these five seals brother
[2:16] man's accuser mentioned Charles Taze
[2:19] Russell the first four seals but not the
[2:21] fifth this means the accuser must have
[2:24] read Russell's work it's most likely he
[2:26] was omitting Russell's full teachings on
[2:29] the first five seals on purpose
[2:32] second so far brother Branham taught
[2:35] completely different than Clarence
[2:37] Larkin on four out of five seals
[2:40] brother Branham and Larkin are very
[2:42] similar on The Sixth Seal which we'll
[2:43] get to which I've already shown in
[2:45] previous videos and also a podcast and
[2:49] Larkin and brother Branham are slightly
[2:51] different on the seventh seal
[2:52] so it can be seen brother Branham did
[2:55] exactly what he said
[2:57] he found the truth of the seals from the
[2:59] visions of the Holy Ghost
[3:01] and he believed quote as much as
[3:03] possible end quote with other Bible
[3:05] teachers let's listen to the quote
[3:08] I had my own idea as every Minister does
[3:12] of reading maybe what other man had said
[3:14] and believing as much as I possible with
[3:17] them on the things that they had drawn
[3:20] up their conclusion uh I'd read the book
[3:23] of Mr Smith your eyes Smith which is the
[3:27] Adventist a teacher and um I read his uh
[3:31] his thoughts on it and I read uh Mr
[3:34] Larkin I'd read all so many different
[3:36] ones of their commentaries on this
[3:41] a third point about the accusation is
[3:44] that Larkin had a 50 chance to Guess Who
[3:47] these Souls were according to scripture
[3:49] they were either Jews or gentiles
[3:53] any group saved in heaven under the
[3:55] altar could be only one of two groups
[3:58] either Jew or Gentile that's according
[4:01] to many scriptures but one example would
[4:03] be First Corinthians 12 13 quote for by
[4:06] one Spirit are we all baptized into one
[4:08] body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[4:10] whether we be Bond or free and have been
[4:13] all made to drink into one Spirit end
[4:15] quote
[4:16] also remember from the 70th week of
[4:18] Daniel that brother brand was grateful
[4:20] to Dr Larkin regarding his views of
[4:23] Daniel's 70th week and of course I'm
[4:25] sure that would apply to all the other
[4:27] work of Larkin that brother random read
[4:30] let's listen to the quote
[4:36] [Music]
[4:40] Mr Smith of the Adventist Church for his
[4:43] views I'm very grateful to Dr Larkin of
[4:48] his views
[4:49] I'm grateful to all these great Scholars
[4:53] for their views on this and in reading
[4:56] them it enlightens me much that I can
[4:58] find places that looks right
[5:02] the fifth seal
[5:05] now let's look at the fifth seal and
[5:06] compare brother branham's teachings with
[5:09] Clarence Larkins
[5:11] as a summary brother Branham and Larkin
[5:13] have one similarity and three
[5:15] differences
[5:17] the one similarity is that these souls
[5:19] are Jews
[5:20] Larkin said quote but they were not the
[5:23] martyrs of the Christian church for they
[5:25] had been resurrected and taken up with
[5:27] the church these Martyrs are those who
[5:30] will be killed for the word of God in
[5:32] their testimony after the church is
[5:33] caught out end quote and Larkin went on
[5:37] to say quote these Martyrs whose souls
[5:39] are seen are mainly Jews end quote
[5:43] let's listen to Brothers say that these
[5:45] Souls under the altar are Jews
[5:48] now why are these Souls anyway that's
[5:52] and they think who are they that if
[5:54] they're not the early church
[5:57] this is Israel
[6:00] that's to be saved as a nation
[6:04] oh man that are predestinated that's
[6:08] Israel that's Israel itself
[6:13] so that is the only similarity between
[6:14] Larkin and brother Branham here's three
[6:16] major differences between brother
[6:19] Branham and Clarence Larkin
[6:20] first Larkin said their Jews only after
[6:23] the church is called out
[6:26] so these are Jews who are martyred after
[6:29] the Rapture
[6:31] they're martyred during the 70th week of
[6:33] Daniel brother Bram did not limit these
[6:36] Jews to only being Jews that are
[6:39] martyred after the Rapture by God's
[6:41] grace let me quote Larkin again saying
[6:44] these Souls were only Jewish Souls after
[6:46] the Rapture he said quote but they were
[6:48] not the martyrs of the Christian church
[6:50] for they had been resurrected and taken
[6:52] up with the church these Martyrs are
[6:54] those who will be killed for the word of
[6:56] God and their testimony after the church
[6:59] is called out end quote that's on pages
[7:01] 58 and 59 of Larkin's book called The
[7:05] Book of Revelation
[7:06] so notice it's Jews after the church is
[7:09] called out
[7:11] brother Ram said these Souls under the
[7:13] altar included Jews before the Rapture
[7:16] from the time of Jesus Christ being
[7:18] rejected on the cross about 2000 years
[7:21] ago to the present time and also
[7:24] included the Jews in the Holocaust let's
[7:26] listen to the quotes
[7:38] and now they were reading for
[7:41] they realized that they recognized
[7:43] that's just going on they seen them when
[7:45] they come before the altar of God
[7:47] but now the grace of God
[7:50] is to that
[7:51] now these Souls under the altar
[7:56] are the these these Souls
[8:00] understanding now it's under the altar
[8:03] while they were martyred by sinful man
[8:06] like Eichmann
[8:08] yeah see they're holding out on millions
[8:11] of them
[8:12] but they remain Jews
[8:15] the Jews
[8:18] sort of stalling all the rest of the
[8:20] world
[8:21] but they stayed true to what they
[8:24] believe
[8:24] and they killed them because they were
[8:27] Jews
[8:29] and now look what a thing they had to do
[8:31] see that was guilty of murder so they
[8:33] got murdered
[8:37] that's right
[8:40] and they were blind
[8:42] Ed now if they hadn't been blinded God
[8:44] said let alone
[8:46] they're not worthy but then if they was
[8:48] blinded by God his grace reached down to
[8:51] them
[8:58] a room because all Israel will be saved
[9:02] everyone has their names written right
[9:05] that's right
[9:07] I noticed now the whole day I tried to
[9:10] get rid of Joseph his grace reached to
[9:12] him go there try to get rid of Jesus he
[9:14] still comes right back around causes
[9:16] dying to give each one of white girls
[9:17] he's gonna take him out in a home anyhow
[9:20] anyhow
[9:25] here's a visual the difference between
[9:27] brother Branham and Clarence Larkin
[9:29] notice this is a vast difference and the
[9:32] conclusion is brother Bram did not
[9:33] plagiarize Clarence Larkin notice the
[9:36] small amount of time for Larkin's fifth
[9:39] seal to be fulfilled it's only fulfilled
[9:42] during the Great Tribulation period
[9:44] but brother branham's fist seal was
[9:46] different his Souls on the altar
[9:48] included Souls from the time of Jesus
[9:50] crucifixion around 30 A.D throughout the
[9:53] entire church age including the
[9:55] Holocaust and also the Jews that would
[9:58] be martyred and saved after the Rapture
[10:00] so any honest person would realize
[10:02] brother Ram did not play dries Clarence
[10:05] Larkin
[10:07] a second difference is that brother
[10:10] Branham said the white robes were given
[10:12] to the Jews at the great white Throne
[10:14] judgment
[10:15] in the church age book
[10:17] Clarence Larkin said they were given the
[10:18] right robes under the altar
[10:21] Larkin said quote to these martyred
[10:23] Souls white robes were given this does
[10:26] not mean they were resurrected that is
[10:27] given glorified bodies and then robed
[10:29] but that they in their soulish or
[10:32] physical bodies were given white robes
[10:34] for while the spirit of man loses its
[10:36] Earthly or fleshly body at death it
[10:39] still has a body its soulish body that
[10:41] can see here speak etc for How could a
[10:44] soul cry if it did not have a form and
[10:47] physical senses
[10:49] end quote
[10:51] and in chapter 7 of the church age book
[10:53] brother random said quote it is the
[10:55] second resurrection that the souls under
[10:57] the altar are set forth in the fifth
[10:59] seal Revelation 6 verses 9 through 11
[11:02] are given white robes and of course
[11:04] eternal life or there would be no point
[11:06] of white robes end quote
[11:12] the third difference between brother
[11:13] Branham and Larkin regarding the fifth
[11:15] seal is Larkin said Malachi chapter 4
[11:18] verses 5 and 6 was the Revelation 11
[11:23] Elijah Ministry to the Jews the same
[11:26] Elijah Ministry that would partner with
[11:28] the Moses Ministry
[11:32] Larkin said quote that Elijah the
[11:35] prophet when he returns will preach
[11:37] Malachi 4. verses 5 and 6 end quote
[11:43] brother Rand did not teach this of
[11:45] course brother Ram said the Elijah
[11:47] prophet of Malachi chapter 4 verses 5
[11:49] and 6 was his ministry to the Gentiles
[11:52] in the seventh Gentile Church age
[11:56] and here's a quote from August 1965
[11:59] where brother Brandon said with thus
[12:01] saith the Lord
[12:02] that the prophet of Malachi chapter 4
[12:05] verses 5 and 6 who was anointed with the
[12:08] spirit of Elijah and would turn the
[12:10] hearts of the children back to the
[12:11] fathers was on the earth at that time in
[12:15] 1965. so it could have been no one else
[12:17] except brother Branham let's listen to
[12:19] the quote
[12:36] that word
[12:41] forever yeah but he promised to do it
[12:45] and Promises stop and stuff they have
[12:47] the Lord
[12:49] notice
[12:50] they did the same thing
[12:53] as this morning did until God got enough
[12:55] of us
[12:58] I remember against us stay at the Lord
[13:00] it'll come to pass in this day
[13:03] Now search
[13:06] every account take every Clan take every
[13:09] man take every Church
[13:12] you and Christ need to do this you
[13:14] preachers
[13:16] I charge you to read the newspapers or
[13:19] take consideration anywhere you want to
[13:20] go
[13:22] and see if it isn't on the Earth right
[13:23] now
[13:28] before moving on I want to show you the
[13:30] Folly of brother Ram's accusers
[13:33] here's a screenshot of Larkin's two
[13:35] pages about the fifth seal
[13:38] in blue you'll see the material that
[13:41] brother M's accusers tried to use
[13:42] against brother Branham of course to
[13:44] their own shame and folly
[13:46] but in the yellow highlights you'll see
[13:48] the differences between brother Branham
[13:50] and Clarence Larkin
[13:52] so if brother Ram's accuser is really
[13:54] wanted the truth all they had to do was
[13:56] keep reading
[13:57] the next few paragraphs after the first
[14:00] information they used from Larkin and
[14:02] they would have found the truth
[14:03] then all they had to do was just read
[14:05] one more paragraph after their second
[14:07] portion of information from Larkin that
[14:10] they used and they would have found the
[14:12] truth
[14:13] so the truth was laying right in front
[14:14] of their faces and if they're honest
[14:16] they'll repent of their false plagiarism
[14:19] charge
[14:20] and humbly acknowledge the truth that
[14:22] was laying right before them if their
[14:24] hearts are righteous then the Bible says
[14:26] they'll study to answer honestly
[14:28] according to the Book of Proverbs
[14:30] so time will tell if their hearts are
[14:32] righteous or not
[14:34] so now the updated amount of differences
[14:36] between Branham and Russell on the first
[14:38] four seals and Larkin on the fifth seal
[14:41] only is now 29 differences
[14:44] so they were previously 26 differences
[14:46] on the first four seals and now there's
[14:48] three differences on the fifth seal for
[14:51] a total of 29 differences
[14:53] and again remember this doesn't include
[14:55] the many differences between brother
[14:57] Branham and Clarence Larkin and Uriah
[14:59] Smith on the first four seals nor
[15:02] between Russell and Uriah Smith on the
[15:05] fifth seal which we'll look at next by
[15:07] God's grace
[15:09] now let's look at brother Branham and
[15:11] Charles Tays Russell on the fifth seal
[15:14] here there are five differences between
[15:16] brother Branham and Charles days Russell
[15:22] first regarding the timing Russell said
[15:24] the fifth seal was quote the Reformation
[15:26] in the days of Luther end quote
[15:30] and began in quote the spring of 1518
[15:33] end quote
[15:36] and of course ended at Russell's Church
[15:39] age which he said began in 1874.
[15:44] it seems there may be some overlap
[15:46] between Russell's fifth and sixth seals
[15:49] but based upon this one quote Russell's
[15:52] fifth seal lasted until around 1755
[15:55] because Russell said the first event of
[15:57] The Sixth Seal was the Lisbon earthquake
[16:00] from November 1st
[16:02] 1755. Russell said quote
[16:05] and I be held when he had opened the
[16:07] Sixth Seal
[16:08] and lo there was a great earthquake
[16:10] literally the Great lispon Earthquake
[16:12] November 1st 1755.
[16:15] which extended over 4 million square
[16:17] miles
[16:18] shocked all Africa and Western Europe
[16:20] including Scandinavian Greenland end
[16:23] quote
[16:25] and of course brother Ram's timing on
[16:27] the fifth seal was that these Souls
[16:29] included Jews who were blinded to Jesus
[16:32] Christ as their Messiah from the time of
[16:34] Jesus crucifixion all the way to the
[16:37] time of the Rapture and then after the
[16:38] Rapture and of course brother Brown said
[16:40] there would be more Jewish Martyrs after
[16:43] the Rapture and they'd be martyred
[16:45] during the Great Tribulation period
[16:46] let's listen to the quotes
[16:50] that's right
[16:54] and they were blinded now if they hadn't
[16:57] been blinded God said let alone
[16:59] they're not worthy but then if they was
[17:02] blinded by God his grace reached down to
[17:04] him
[17:12] because all Israel will be saved
[17:16] everyone has his name written right
[17:18] that's right
[17:21] notice these souls are to wait a little
[17:27] season for the 144 to be martyred
[17:31] oh isn't that isn't that this puts the
[17:33] Bible together
[17:36] so here's a visual showing how brother
[17:38] Graham did not plagiarize Charles Tays
[17:40] Russell on the timing of the fifth seal
[17:42] notice the short amount of time that
[17:44] Russell's fifth seal lasted from about
[17:46] 15-18 which was the beginning of the
[17:48] Reformation to about 1755 when he said
[17:52] the first event of The Sixth Seal
[17:54] happened the Lisbon earthquake
[17:56] and again notice how brother Ram's fifth
[17:58] seal lasted a very long time from 30 A.D
[18:01] the blinded Jewish Souls who were saved
[18:04] despite rejecting their own Messiah and
[18:06] all the Jewish Souls saved who were
[18:08] blinded to the Messiah during the entire
[18:10] church ages including the Jewish Martyrs
[18:13] who have to give their lives during the
[18:14] Great Tribulation period so the
[18:16] conclusion is it's obvious brother Bram
[18:18] did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell
[18:20] on the fifth seal
[18:23] the second difference between brother
[18:24] Branham and Charles Taze Russell were on
[18:27] the souls Russell said they were
[18:29] Christians from the Reformation brother
[18:31] random said they were Jews
[18:33] as we already saw Russell said they were
[18:35] Christians from the days of Luther's
[18:37] reformation and they were killed by the
[18:40] Roman Catholic church or Rome or the
[18:42] Pope
[18:46] the third difference is on the word
[18:48] slain in the fifth seal Russell said
[18:50] they were either slain by spiritual or
[18:53] natural beheading brother Branham never
[18:56] taught spiritual beheading
[18:58] Russell said quote men that were slain
[19:01] spiritually beheaded some of them
[19:02] literally also Revelation 20 verse 4 end
[19:06] quote
[19:08] the fourth difference between brother
[19:10] Branham and Charles Taze Russell was was
[19:12] on the scripture of the Fist seal that
[19:14] said it was said unto them
[19:15] Russell actually prophesied under the
[19:18] fifth seal that the Saints the Christian
[19:20] Saints would raise from the dead in the
[19:22] spring of 1878 and then later clarified
[19:25] it would be in April 1878. of course
[19:28] this makes Charles Tay's Russell a false
[19:30] prophet because the dead in Christ did
[19:32] not rise in April 1878.
[19:36] Russell said quote which show that as
[19:38] Christ was raised from the dead in 8033
[19:40] the sleeping Saints would be raised
[19:43] 1845 years later in the spring of 1878
[19:47] end quote
[19:50] and Russell even called this a prophecy
[19:52] quote as indicated by the prophecies
[19:54] here and noted end quote
[20:00] and then he said quote this we have
[20:02] elsewhere shown marks the date April
[20:05] 1878 end quote
[20:10] the fifth difference between brother
[20:11] Branham and Charles Taze Russell was on
[20:13] the little season of the fifth seal
[20:15] Russell said it was 360 years since
[20:18] Martin Luther and the Reformation to
[20:21] April 1878 Russell said quote 360 years
[20:25] from the spring of 1518 brings us to the
[20:29] spring of 1878 where we understand that
[20:32] God's promise made to the sleeping
[20:34] Saints was fulfilled they were raised
[20:36] from the dead and Babylon was cast off
[20:38] end quote
[20:40] brother Branham said the little season
[20:41] was the Jews who would be martyred
[20:43] during the seven year tribulation period
[20:46] or the last week of Daniel's 70th week
[20:49] let's listen to brother Ram's quote
[20:53] these souls are to wait a little season
[20:59] for the 144 to be martyred
[21:03] oh isn't that isn't that this is pet
[21:05] survival because
[21:08] and finally let's compare brother
[21:10] Branham and Uriah Smith on the fifth
[21:13] seal
[21:14] there's three differences between
[21:16] brother Branham and Uriah Smith first on
[21:19] the timing your eye Smith said the fifth
[21:21] seal was the Reformation period which
[21:24] began around 1517 he said quote
[21:27] following the period of the papal
[21:30] persecution the time covered by this
[21:31] seal would commence when the Reformation
[21:33] began to undermine the Antichrist papal
[21:37] Fabric and restrain the persecuting
[21:39] power of the Romans church end quote
[21:43] and of course as we already said brother
[21:45] Branham said the fifth seal conversation
[21:47] between the slain Jews and the Lord
[21:50] takes place after the Rapture
[21:52] but that group of Jews contains blinded
[21:55] Jews from the time of Jesus crucifixion
[21:57] all the way to the Rapture and then
[21:59] we'll include martyr Jews during the
[22:01] tribulation period
[22:03] here's a visual of the difference
[22:04] between brother Branham and Uriah Smith
[22:07] notice how similar Uriah Smith's
[22:09] timeline was to Charles days Russell
[22:11] they were only different by one year
[22:13] I Smith said the physio lasted from 1517
[22:16] to about 1755.
[22:19] I noticed brother Ram's fiscio included
[22:22] the blinded Jews who were saved and
[22:23] waiting under the altar from the time of
[22:25] Jesus crucifixion throughout the entire
[22:28] church age including the Jews who were
[22:30] martyred during the Holocaust and will
[22:32] include the Jews who will be martyred
[22:34] after the Rapture during the Great
[22:36] Tribulation period
[22:37] so any honest soul will say that brother
[22:40] Ram did not plagiarize Uriah Smith on
[22:42] the fifth seal
[22:45] the second difference between brother
[22:46] Branham and Uriah Smith was the souls
[22:49] Uriah Smith said they were martyred for
[22:51] their attachment to Christianity
[22:53] he said quote and under it the souls of
[22:55] those who had been slain for the word of
[22:57] God martyred for their attachment to
[22:59] Christianity end quote
[23:02] and of course brother random went to
[23:05] Great Lengths in the fifth seal to show
[23:06] how these Souls were killed for the word
[23:08] of God's sake and not the testimony of
[23:11] Jesus Christ
[23:12] brother Ram clearly showed they were not
[23:14] Christians they were Jews so again
[23:17] brother Rand was completely different
[23:18] than Uriah Smith
[23:20] and the third and final difference
[23:21] between brother Branham and Uriah Smith
[23:23] was the little season
[23:24] Ryan Smith said Rome added hundreds of
[23:26] thousands of Christian Martyrs from the
[23:29] time of the Reformation until the time
[23:30] of The Sixth Seal which he said was
[23:32] November 1st 1775.
[23:35] so Uriah Smith's little season was from
[23:37] around 1517 to about 1775. brother M did
[23:42] not say that for the Rams of the little
[23:44] season was Daniel's 70th week the seven
[23:46] year Great Tribulation period
[23:48] your eyes Smith said quote the little
[23:50] season and during this time Rome added
[23:53] hundreds of thousands to the vast throng
[23:55] of those blood she had already become
[23:57] guilty see Buck's theological dictionary
[24:00] art persecution but the spirit of
[24:03] persecution was finally restrained the
[24:05] cause of the martyrs was Vindicated and
[24:06] the little season of the fifth seal came
[24:08] to a close end quote
[24:13] in closing
[24:14] friends I hope this teaching on the
[24:16] fifth seal was a great help to you by
[24:18] the grace of the Lord again brother
[24:20] Brandon is Vindicated as receiving the
[24:22] revelation of the first five seals from
[24:24] the Lord Jesus Christ from his holy
[24:26] spirit
[24:27] again this makes us feel sad for
[24:29] brothers accusers they're either
[24:31] completely ignorant of brother Ram's
[24:33] teachings on the seals and also the full
[24:35] extent of teaching from Charleston's
[24:38] Russell Clarence Larkin Uriah Smith or
[24:40] they're purposely slandering God's
[24:42] genuine Prophet brother Branham let's
[24:44] pray for their souls
[24:46] father God I just humble myself again
[24:48] Lord God and ask God lord if it be
[24:50] possible that brother Adam's accusers
[24:52] could humble themselves and be convinced
[24:54] by now these 29 differences on the first
[24:58] five seals and Lord we know that's a
[25:00] small number as well there's many more
[25:02] differences so father let the spirit of
[25:04] Truth come upon brother Ram's accusers
[25:07] May the repent of their false teachings
[25:10] Lord you say With God all things are
[25:12] possible so Lord I know it's possible so
[25:14] I ask if it be possible they could be
[25:17] righteous repent of their sins and
[25:20] recognize the truth and repent of their
[25:23] erroneous research and publicly humble
[25:27] themselves
[25:28] admit they're wrong and recognize the
[25:30] truth Lord I just put this in your hands
[25:33] Lord all things are possible and Lord
[25:35] it's our desire that we could save
[25:37] sinners from The Malt through their sins
[25:39] Lord we're reminded of James chapter 5
[25:41] verse 20 that says if we convert The
[25:44] Sinner from the air of his way we shall
[25:47] save a soul from death and hide a
[25:49] multitude of sins
[25:51] pray God if these accusers are not saved
[25:54] they could be converted they could
[25:55] repent of their lies and their sins
[25:57] and serve you with an honest righteous
[25:59] heart I ask all these things by the
[26:01] blood of Jesus Christ that thy will be
[26:03] done Lord Jesus in Christ's name I ask
[26:05] it amen
