[0:02] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest
[0:05] upon him the spirit of wisdom of
[0:09] understanding the spirit of counsel
[0:11] might the spirit of knowledge and the
[0:14] fear of the Lord and shall make him of
[0:19] quick understanding and the fear of the
[0:23] Lord greetings friends in the matchless
[0:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:28] purpose of this video is to do a bible
[0:30] study on the necessity and power of the
[0:33] fear of the Lord as taught plainly
[0:36] throughout the Old and New Testaments hi
[0:39] friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of
[0:41] Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA
[0:44] and I defend the original Gospel of the
[0:45] Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St
[0:48] Paul then had to restore through Martin
[0:50] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:52] brother William brandham who live from
[0:54] 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother
[0:57] Ram's Godly Christian character
[1:00] so here's the outline for the video
[1:01] we'll look at first Old Testament verses
[1:03] then we'll look at New Testament verses
[1:06] followed by Brother Ram's quotes and
[1:08] then the
[1:10] conclusion this may be a two-part Series
[1:13] so we'll see how it goes by the grace of
[1:15] God so let's begin with Old Testament
[1:19] verses before getting into those verses
[1:22] let's look at the Hebrew definition of
[1:23] the word fear it means moral reverence
[1:28] and reverence means honor or in
[1:29] Integrity or honesty according to
[1:32] Webster's Dictionary or profound
[1:34] adoration so the way I'm going to define
[1:36] fear is profound honor and it's profound
[1:40] honor that honors
[1:42] Holiness let's begin with Proverbs 1: 29
[1:46] the Bible says for that they hated
[1:48] knowledge and did not choose the fear of
[1:50] the Lord so the first point I want to
[1:53] make about the fear of the Lord is that
[1:54] it's a choice it's everyone's choice to
[1:58] love good it's every One's Choice to
[2:00] fear the lord or have profound honor for
[2:03] God's
[2:04] holiness next the fear of the Lord is
[2:07] profound honor for God and hatred for
[2:09] sin this is Proverbs
[2:12] 8:13 the Bible says the fear of the Lord
[2:15] is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and
[2:18] the evil way and the froward mouth do I
[2:22] hate it is our choice to have the fear
[2:25] of the Lord or profound honor and love
[2:28] for God's holiness which will cause us
[2:30] to hate
[2:32] sin third verse is Proverbs 9:10 we
[2:35] learn that the fear of the Lord is the
[2:37] prerequisite for the beginning of wisdom
[2:40] so God wants us to develop a deep wisdom
[2:42] over the entire course of our Christian
[2:44] lives but the fear of the Lord will
[2:46] bring you to the beginning of that
[2:48] wisdom but then of course you're
[2:49] supposed to grow in that wisdom over
[2:51] time Proverbs 9:10 says the fear of the
[2:54] Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the
[2:56] knowledge of the Holy is understanding
[3:00] next the Bible says the fear of the Lord
[3:01] is your strong confidence in God or your
[3:05] place of Refuge or safety Proverbs 1426
[3:09] tells us this the Bible says in the fear
[3:12] of the Lord is strong confidence and his
[3:14] children have a place of
[3:17] Refuge although we live in a world of
[3:19] doubt and uncertainty and we feel danger
[3:22] sometimes can feel all around us the
[3:24] fear of the Lord is our place of
[3:26] confidence it's our place of Refuge the
[3:29] verse right after this Proverbs 14:27
[3:31] gives us the next understanding of the
[3:33] fear of the Lord It's Your Fountain of
[3:35] Life the fear of the Lord is a Fountain
[3:37] of Life to depart from the snares of
[3:41] death just as a fountain is a constant
[3:43] stream of life to our natural life so is
[3:47] the fear of the Lord a constant stream
[3:49] of life for our spiritual life next
[3:52] Proverbs 28:14 says the fear of the Lord
[3:55] is your source of
[3:56] happiness happy is the man that fearth
[3:59] always but he that hardeneth his heart
[4:01] shall fall into
[4:03] Mischief so true happiness comes from
[4:06] the fear of the Lord and it also is
[4:08] contrasted with a hard heart so that
[4:10] means the fear of the Lord must be a
[4:12] soft-hearted kind-hearted Christian next
[4:15] the fear of the Lord is your path to
[4:17] praise or future reward proverbs
[4:20] 31:30 of course this is the Proverbs 31
[4:23] Woman chapter verse 30 says favor is
[4:26] deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman
[4:28] that fearth the Lord she shall be
[4:31] praised we know the Lord Jesus will have
[4:33] a great reward for us if we choose to
[4:35] fear the lord next moving to the Book of
[4:38] Psalms the fear of the Lord is your
[4:40] lasting Purity or cleanliness Psalms
[4:44] 199 the fear of the Lord is clean which
[4:47] means Purity or pure enduring forever
[4:51] the judgments of the Lord are true and
[4:53] righteous alog together so fearing the
[4:56] Lord leads to a lasting purity of heart
[4:58] and life before for the Lord constantly
[5:01] confessing our sins hating evil
[5:04] overcoming evil the fear of the Lord is
[5:07] also a lesson to be learned we see this
[5:09] in Deuteronomy 49 and 10 the Bible says
[5:12] only take heed to thyself and keep thy
[5:14] Soul diligently lest thou forget the
[5:17] things which thine eyes have seen and
[5:19] lest they depart from thy heart all the
[5:21] days of thy life but teach them thy sons
[5:24] and thy Sons Sons especially the day
[5:27] that thou stood before the Lord thy God
[5:29] in Horeb when the Lord said unto me
[5:32] gather me the people together and I'll
[5:33] make them hear my words that they may
[5:36] learn to fear me all the days that they
[5:39] shall live upon the Earth and that they
[5:40] may teach their
[5:43] children Moses tells us when the people
[5:45] of God stand before the Lord and before
[5:47] his prophet and hear the words of God it
[5:49] teaches them to fear the lord it's a
[5:52] lesson they must be learned that's why
[5:53] Church attendance is so important so
[5:56] powerful so
[5:57] life-changing next in Ecclesiastes 12:
[6:00] 13- 14 the fear of the Lord is your
[6:03] conclusion about life's purpose so many
[6:06] people wonder what their life's purposes
[6:08] and it really is to fear the lord and
[6:11] keep God's commands of course we know
[6:13] this is with love Jesus says three times
[6:15] in John 14 if you love me keep my
[6:18] commands let us hear the conclusion of
[6:20] the whole matter fear God and keep his
[6:22] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[6:24] of man for God shall bring every work
[6:26] into judgment with every secret thing
[6:27] whether it be good or whether it be
[6:30] evil and the final verse one of the most
[6:33] powerful verses about the fear of the
[6:35] Lord is that the fear of the Lord is
[6:37] your anointing to be like Christ this is
[6:39] from Isaiah 11
[6:42] 1-3 verse one says and there shall come
[6:44] forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and
[6:46] a branch shall grow out of his roots and
[6:49] the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon
[6:51] him the spirit of wisdom and
[6:53] understanding the spirit of counsel
[6:54] might the spirit of knowledge and of the
[6:57] fear of the Lord and shall make him of
[6:59] quick understanding in the fear of the
[7:01] Lord and he shall not judge after the
[7:03] sight of his eyes neither reprove after
[7:05] the hearing of his ears but with
[7:08] righteousness shall he judge the poor
[7:09] and reprove with equity for the meek of
[7:11] the earth and he shall Smite the Earth
[7:14] with the rod of his mouth and with the
[7:15] breath of his lips shall he slay the
[7:17] wicked to close out this first section
[7:20] on Old Testament scripture let's look at
[7:22] how to obtain the fear of the Lord three
[7:24] simple passages of scripture the first
[7:27] step to obtain the fear of the Lord is
[7:29] to hate evil Proverbs 8:13 tells us this
[7:32] the Bible says the fear of the Lord is
[7:34] to hate evil now the reason this is the
[7:37] first step is because we know a lot of
[7:38] people can hate evil but they don't
[7:40] depart from Evil which is the second
[7:42] step the Bible speaks of this in 2
[7:45] Corinthians where it speaks of two
[7:47] different kinds of Sorrow you have Godly
[7:49] sorrow which leads to repentance and
[7:50] taking vengeance upon the Devil and
[7:52] obeying God's word but you also have
[7:54] worldly sorrow and I've seen that many
[7:56] times people get worldly sorrow they
[7:58] feel bad they hate their sin but they
[7:59] don't overcome it they don't obey the
[8:01] word of God they remain stuck addicted
[8:04] to sin or in their evil complexes or
[8:08] evil habits so the first step is hate
[8:10] evil the second step is to depart from
[8:13] Evil Proverbs 3:7 be not wise in thine
[8:16] own eyes fear the lord and depart from
[8:20] Evil so the fear of the Lord hates evil
[8:23] the fear of the Lord helps you depart
[8:25] from Evil then thirdly you must seek
[8:28] God's will to understand the fear of the
[8:30] Lord this is Proverbs 2: 1-1 this is all
[8:34] in the pursuit of wisdom of course which
[8:36] comes after the fear of the Lord verse
[8:38] three says y if Thou criest after
[8:39] knowledge and liftest up thy voice for
[8:42] understanding if thou seekest her as
[8:44] silver and searches for her as for his
[8:45] treasure then Thou shalt understand the
[8:48] fear of the Lord and find the knowledge
[8:50] of God for the lord giveth wisdom out of
[8:52] his mouth cometh knowledge and
[8:54] understanding he layeth up sound wisdom
[8:56] for the righteous he's a buckler to them
[8:58] that walk uprightly he keepeth the path
[9:01] of judgment and preserveth the way of
[9:03] his Saints so the Bible's plain we must
[9:06] hate evil depart from that evil and seek
[9:09] God's will to understand the fear of the
[9:12] Lord and then he will direct our paths
[9:14] friends we come to the end of part one I
[9:16] hope this was a blessing stay tuned for
[9:17] part two we'll look at New Testament
[9:19] verses about the fear of the Lord then
