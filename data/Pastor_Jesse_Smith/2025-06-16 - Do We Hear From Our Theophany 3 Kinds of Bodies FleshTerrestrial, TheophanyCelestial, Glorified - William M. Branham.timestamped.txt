[0:03] Now we see here plainly the complete
[0:07] secret of our lives and journey and
[0:10] death and where we go after we die.
[0:14] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:18] this video is to answer a question I
[0:20] received on email. I was asked, can we
[0:23] hear from our theophony? Now, my answer
[0:26] is I don't know because I can't find a
[0:29] scripture that teaches that we hear from
[0:31] our theophony. And I'll go through my
[0:33] reasons for that, of course, in this
[0:35] video. So, this is an excellent
[0:37] question. This is a question for years
[0:39] I've just put up on the shelf. And so, I
[0:41] hope to get some good feedback in the
[0:43] comments about scriptures that teach
[0:46] whether or not we do hear from our
[0:48] theophony. This question originates from
[0:51] the sermon, who is this Melzdc? Brother
[0:53] preached it in 1965. phenomenal message.
[0:56] He said, "You heard from your theophony.
[0:59] If this earthly body be dissolved, we
[1:01] have one waiting." So over the years,
[1:04] I've asked numerous ministers about
[1:05] this, and I've just said, "Can you give
[1:07] me one scripture that says we hear from
[1:10] our theophony, and I've never been given
[1:12] a scripture yet." So that's okay. I'm
[1:15] just leaving it up on the shelf. It's
[1:17] good to be humble and say, "I don't know
[1:19] if we don't know." And it's good to wait
[1:21] on the Lord because when we wait on the
[1:22] Lord, he renews our strength like the
[1:24] eagle. And of course, this is a minor
[1:26] topic. This is not a major topic. This
[1:28] doesn't pertain to salvation whether we
[1:30] hear from our theophony or not. What my
[1:33] answer has been over the years is that
[1:34] we hear from God's theophony and not our
[1:37] own theophony. But again, I could be
[1:39] wrong. I'm open to correction by the
[1:41] grace of God. Brother Brandham was a
[1:43] genuine prophet of God. He was Malachi
[1:46] 45 and6 turning the hearts of the
[1:48] children back to the fathers. He
[1:50] finished the mysteries of God.
[1:51] Revelation 10:1-7.
[1:53] He was a son of man revealing the son of
[1:56] man. He had the messiahic discernment
[1:58] gift. And it was thus sayith the Lord.
[2:00] It was the last sign to the Gentiles.
[2:02] Brother Ram's ministry of discernment.
[2:04] It was just like the ministry of the
[2:06] Lord Jesus to be able to discern the
[2:08] thoughts and intents of people's hearts.
[2:11] But we also know brother Ram said he was
[2:13] human. He said there was mix-ups on the
[2:15] tapes. He said, "Test me by the word.
[2:17] Prove all things." Brother Ram said, "I
[2:19] don't have all the answers, friends."
[2:21] So, Brother Ram was a humble true
[2:23] prophet of God. But he realized he was
[2:26] not God. He was not perfect. He did not
[2:29] have all the answers. And we as true
[2:32] Christians must take everything God's
[2:34] prophet said back to the Bible. As the
[2:36] Bible said, prove all things. Search the
[2:39] scriptures daily whether these things
[2:40] are so. So, I think I'll start with the
[2:42] Bible foundation. Here's a few
[2:44] screenshots I made uh back in 2016 when
[2:47] I preached on this topic. First of all,
[2:49] there's three kinds of bodies in the
[2:51] Bible. First is terrestrial or the flesh
[2:53] body that we live in here. 1 Corinthians
[2:57] 15:40 and 2 Corinthians 5:1.
[3:01] Second is the celestial or theophony
[3:03] body that's waiting for us there in the
[3:06] seventh dimension or might say the third
[3:08] heaven. According to Matthew 18:10, it's
[3:11] called a building of God. It's a house
[3:13] not made with hands. It's an eternal
[3:15] body. It's our house from heaven. This
[3:18] body doesn't eat physical food. This is
[3:21] according to 1 Corinthians 5:40 and 2
[3:23] Corinthians 5:1.
[3:25] Thirdly, there's the glorified body that
[3:28] we get in the first resurrection or the
[3:31] pre-tribulation
[3:33] gentile rapture for the bride of Jesus
[3:35] Christ. This glorified body has
[3:38] glorified flesh and bones. It's not a
[3:41] spirit being since it can eat and it's
[3:43] needed for the wedding supper and
[3:45] beyond. Jesus had this glorified body at
[3:48] his resurrection and is still in the
[3:50] glorified body according to John 7:39,
[3:52] John 12:16, Luke 24:37
[3:56] through 43 and Acts 3:13.
[4:00] This was so beautifully preached by
[4:02] brother Brandham. He said the
[4:03] understanding on these three bodies was
[4:06] the complete secret of our lives in
[4:08] journey and death and where we go after
[4:10] we die. He said that. And who is this
[4:11] Melzdc? Let's listen to the quote. Who
[4:14] is this Melzdc but God? Now we see here
[4:19] plainly the complete secret of our lives
[4:23] and journey and death and where we go
[4:26] after we die. Also predestination is in
[4:30] plain view here. Now listen as we teach
[4:33] this closely. The stages of
[4:37] of the eternal purpose he had in his
[4:42] secret has now been revealed. Notice
[4:46] there is still three stages to
[4:49] perfection. Just like he redeems the
[4:52] world same way he redeems his church he
[4:54] redeems the people in three stages. Now
[4:57] look, first is justification
[5:01] like Luther preached. Second,
[5:04] sanctification like Wesley preached.
[5:07] Third, baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's
[5:10] right. Then comes the rapture.
[5:13] So here's some more visuals. Uh the
[5:14] flesh body is also called the
[5:16] terrestrial in 1 Corinthians 15. It
[5:19] eats, drinks, sleeps. It can touch and
[5:22] feel. It can touch and feel glorified
[5:25] bodies because Thomas was able to touch
[5:28] the glorified body of the Lord Jesus
[5:30] after the resurrection. The flesh body
[5:32] is a body of corruption under the curse
[5:34] of death. It has a sin nature in its
[5:36] members according to Romans 7.
[5:39] The theophony is also called a celestial
[5:42] body in the Bible 1 Corinthians 15. It's
[5:45] an eternal body. It's spiritlike. It's
[5:48] an angel-like body and it's waiting in
[5:51] heaven for us when we are here living on
[5:54] earth. So right now all believers have a
[5:57] theophony that's unoccupied according to
[5:59] brother Random. It's waiting in heaven
[6:02] and it's eternal. So it was always in
[6:04] the mind of God before the foundation of
[6:05] the world. Now these celestial or
[6:08] theophony bodies can touch other
[6:10] theophanes and can even touch humans
[6:13] according to Daniel 10:es 8-10 when the
[6:17] angel touches Daniel. In Daniel 10:10 he
[6:21] said and hand touched me which set me
[6:23] upon my knees and upon the palms of my
[6:25] hands. So that was an angelic theophony
[6:29] body touching Daniel's physical body.
[6:33] And a theophony does not sleep, eat or
[6:35] drink. So right now all the saints
[6:37] who've gone on before like Paul, Peter,
[6:40] James, John, brother Brandham, they're
[6:42] in a theophony body now. They don't need
[6:44] to eat, sleep, or drink. And finally is
[6:47] the glorified body. This is a body that
[6:50] can be touched by other flesh bodies
[6:52] like Thomas touching Jesus. It's not a
[6:55] spirit body. It's a glorified flesh
[6:56] body. It can eat food and drink as Jesus
[6:59] did. He ate fish with the disciples
[7:03] after his resurrection. And this is a
[7:05] glorified body needed for the wedding
[7:06] supper, the millennium, and the new
[7:08] Jerusalem, the new city.
[7:11] Next, I'm going to play a quote from
[7:12] God's prophet, Brother Brandham, that
[7:14] says, "The theophony waiting for us in
[7:16] heaven doesn't have a spirit in it." So,
[7:19] this is why I think that we don't hear
[7:21] from our theophony. How can we hear from
[7:23] a body that doesn't have a spirit in it?
[7:26] Because that body's waiting for our
[7:29] spirit and soul to go to it. Brother
[7:31] said this in thirsting for life June
[7:33] 30th 1957. Let's listen to the quote. So
[7:38] the locust which was the son of God went
[7:43] up created by these great mountains of
[7:48] purity of God as those spirits went out
[7:53] and it created uh the logust and it was
[7:57] a body. It was in the form of what we
[8:00] are now, which is called in the clergy
[8:04] spigot of the
[8:06] body that doesn't have a spirit in it.
[8:10] It's a body that's waiting for you
[8:12] Christians. As soon as the life leaves
[8:14] this, you go into that body. When this
[8:16] delivery tabernacle be dissolved, we
[8:18] have one already waiting
[8:21] of the arsonist. I think I'll show this
[8:24] visual as well. It's the order of the
[8:25] manifestation of Jesus and the sons of
[8:28] God. Brother Ram taught this. And who is
[8:29] this? Melazdc. Jesus the man went from
[8:32] thought. He was in the thoughts of God
[8:34] to a theophony or word body. And then he
[8:37] came in flesh through the womb of Mary
[8:40] into a flesh word body cuz he had a word
[8:42] nature. We don't have a word nature in
[8:45] our flesh body yet. We have a sin
[8:46] nature. And fourth, the Lord Jesus then
[8:49] went in a glorified body and that's what
[8:51] he's in right now. Brother Ram says
[8:53] we're different. He said, "We started as
[8:55] a thought." Ephesians 1:4, "Chosen in
[8:58] Christ before the foundation of the
[8:59] world. We skip the theophony and went to
[9:02] the flesh sin body in order to be tested
[9:05] and tempted and overcome.
[9:08] And third, after death, we go to the
[9:10] theophony, which brother Ram also calls
[9:12] a word body, which is also a celestial
[9:14] body. And fourth, we'll get the
[9:16] glorified body at the rapture."
[9:19] If we live to the rapture, brother Ram
[9:21] said, our flesh body will get swallowed
[9:23] up by glorified body and then we'll go
[9:25] to meet the theophony in the air. So I
[9:28] want to play a quote here where brother
[9:30] Ram says, "The theophony is spoken of in
[9:33] 2 Corinthians 5:es 1-5."
[9:37] Brother Ram quotes, "If this earthly
[9:39] tabernacle be dissolved, we have one
[9:41] waiting." He said, "That's the He said
[9:43] that's the theophony." Let's listen to
[9:45] the quote. And we if this earthly
[9:49] tabernacle or a body dwelling place be
[9:52] dissolved, we have one already waiting.
[9:58] And in the scriptural terms or the uh
[10:01] ministerial terms, it's called a
[10:03] theosttomy.
[10:05] And in this great body that we go into
[10:09] and wait for the resurrection of this
[10:11] body to come back of the dust when
[10:13] Sunday afternoon the Lord willing I wish
[10:16] to speak on the subject why must we be
[10:18] born again. Next I'll share a quote from
[10:21] Hebrews chapter 4 September 1st evening
[10:25] 1957. Brother Brandham said a theophony
[10:28] is not a glorified body. It's like an
[10:30] angelic body. It has a shape and a form.
[10:34] Let's listen to the quote. In the
[10:36] beginning was the same. He was that
[10:38] great spirit fountain where all the
[10:40] truness, all the love, all the peace,
[10:44] everything that was pure was in this
[10:46] fountain. It began to form a body, a
[10:48] theosy, the kind of body that we go to.
[10:51] Not a glorified body, but an angelic
[10:54] body like has shaped form. So in
[10:57] closing, friends, I hope this video was
[10:59] a blessing by the grace of God. I think
[11:01] I'll consider this video like a starter
[11:03] video perhaps of a series on theophanes
[11:05] if the comments provide some good
[11:08] feedback. If not, that's totally fine.
[11:09] We'll move on to another topic by the
[11:11] grace of God. But I got an email about
[11:13] this and it was very humble, very good
[11:16] question, a question I've had for many
[11:17] years as well. So again, I believe we
[11:19] hear from God's theophony because I
[11:21] believe our theophones do not have a
[11:23] spirit inside of them because our
[11:26] theophony is like a house. It's just
[11:27] waiting for us up there. It's waiting
[11:29] for us to move into it. Like Paul says
[11:32] in 2 Corinthians 5:es 1-5. But again, I
[11:35] could be wrong. I'm open to correction.
[11:37] We just want to be scriptural in
[11:39] everything we do as we're taught by the
[11:40] Bible and by God's prophet, Brother
[11:42] Brandham. Remember friends, we need two
[11:44] or three witnesses for every word to be
[11:46] established. So, I don't even have one
[11:47] witness that we hear from our theophony.
[11:49] So, that's why I don't preach that. I
[11:51] preach that we hear from God's theophony
[11:53] or the Holy Ghost. And perhaps this
[11:56] topic will lead to the topic of do we
[11:58] have a guardian angel? I believe we do.
[12:00] According to Psalm 34:7, if David had an
[12:03] angel encamped around him, then I
[12:05] believe every believer does because all
[12:07] those who fear the Lord have an angel of
[12:10] the Lord that encamps around them.
[12:12] Brother Ram did say that as well. So
[12:14] perhaps we'll get to those quotes in a
[12:15] future video. by the grace of God. Thank
[12:19] God that the complete secret of our
[12:20] lives in journey and death and where we
[12:23] go after we die has been revealed.
[12:26] Praise God that God showed Brother
[12:28] Brennham these three bodies. We're so
[12:30] thankful we know where we came from, the
[12:32] mind of God, and we know where we're
[12:34] going, our theophony, our eternal house
[12:37] in the heavens. If you have any
[12:39] questions, concerns, or testimonies
[12:41] about this video, please contact me.
[12:45] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[12:47] the desire of your heart.
[12:51] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[12:52] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[12:55] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[12:58] good news that Jesus raised from the
[13:00] dead, living among man today, his
[13:02] church. The same Jesus that was
[13:05] yesterday will be today and forever. He
[13:08] is never failed.
