[Music] the Seven Seals seven trumpets seven bows three woes woman in the sun casting out of the devil of the red dragon comes between these times during the Great Tribulation period don't forget it greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to go over the order of events during the seven-year great tribulation period This is a study I've invested years into I'm just going to do the best I can by the grace of God to put these events in order and I trust to be a blessing to you by God's grace hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Maran brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character this video is going to be a teaching video using quotes from God's Prophet brother brandom and of course many Bible scriptures to try to place the events of the Great Tribulation in the correct order let's start off with some quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham then we'll look at the events before the Rapture that we're anticipating then we'll look at the main Bible verses used to decide the order of events in the tribulation and then we'll look at the events of the tribulation first quote I want to look at is how brother Bram said there are certain events that pertain to Salvation some that do not and of course this topic of the events of the tribulation do not pertain to Salvation brother Bram even said this about the Rapture or the coming of the Lord Brother brandom said if we have different ideas about the coming of the Lord that's okay because it doesn't pertain to Salvation and salvation remember only comes through faith in the blood of Jesus Christ according to Romans chapter 3 because we're saved by grace through faith according to Ephesians 2 8-10 brother Ram says this in how can I overcome 1963 he said but it doesn't pertain to Salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the Lord let's listen to the quote but I I can't agree with him because I don't see it but the it doesn't pertain to Salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the Lord he sees that the church has to go through the tribulation period for purification I say the blood of Jesus Christ purifies the church the next quote I want to read is from The Sixth Seal brother Bram said The Sixth Seal is the interruption of nature as we'll see with the seven trumpets and the Seven vials brother BR was speaking of the Great Earthquake spoken of in Revelation chap 6 in the section on The Sixth Seal brother Raam said then all nature was interrupted nature took a tumble let's listen to the quote we find out now John said I beheld when he opened the Sixth Seal there was a great earthquake then all nature was interrupted see God God's been doing great things like Healing The Sick and Open the Eyes of the Blind and doing great work but we find out here that nature tuck a tumble yes all nature look what taking place the the earthquake the sun went black and the moon would give its light the Stars Shook and fell and wow everything happened see right at the time of the opening of this six seal that's when it takes place right immediately after the announcing of those Martyrs the martyrs have been finished now you see we're right close into that hour now we could be at any time amen see because the church is just about ready to take its flight but remember when these things happen the bride won't be here just remember the bride's gone she don't have to go through any of it this is a time of tribulation of purification of the uh of the church it's put up on her for to go through it not the rde he takes his sweetheart out of the way that's her she done redeemed her see it's kind of a that's his own selection his own choice like any man that takes his bride next I want to share two quotes where brother Ram said there's one week left for Israel there's one week left for the Jews and I know of course there's many quotes during the preaching of the Seven Seals and after the Seven Seals where brother Ram said there's only half a week left or three and a half years but again I have a video on Daniel 70 weeks my understanding of that through quotes from brother brandham and also scriptures so I'll make sure I leave a link to that in the description but both quotes are from the 70th week of Daniel August 6 19 61 the first one he said one week left one weeks yet determined then a few paragraphs later he says we're at the end of the Gentile age then there's one more week left for the Jew is that right so let's listen to these two quotes well God did with the Jews just exactly what he said he would do and then 69 years uh it was 483 years but 69 weeks one week left one week's yet determined now if these exactly was seven years years each one of the weeks and we've already had 69 weeks then we have the Gentile age and we're nowhere at the end of the Gentile age and there's one more week left for the Jew is that right and that's exactly seven years the next quote I want to read is from the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel from July 30th evening service 1961 notice brother random says the Seven Seals seven trumpets seven vows three woses all take place during the time of the Great Tribulation period don't forget it now the reason I read this is because there's other quotes where brother random says the woses some of them have already happened or some of the trumpets have already been blown but this is the quote I believe is most accurate let's listen to the quote listen I'm closing the Seven Seals seven trumpets seven Bowes three woles woman in the sun casting out of the devil or the red dragon comes between these times during the Great Tribulation period don't forget it all these things take place during this time but here is the sixfold purpose of his coming do you believe it hallelujah what a glorious time lays in store for those who love the Lord I tell you friends we can't afford to miss that don't miss that for whatever you do be sure the next quote is from Feast of trumpets 1964 brother Bram said the 200 million demons that were loosed under the fifth trumpet were already loosed upon the Jews during the Holocaust and again I could be wrong on this but based upon the other quote I believe the fifth trumpet has not sounded yet and I'm basing that of course on another quote from Brother brandham Where brother brandham said the trumpets are only going to be sounded during the Great Tribulation period so let's listen to the quotes now now he loosed upon under that six seal these 200,000 spiritual demons started in Rome Germany Hitler no over the Bible where they received never they received power as kings but wasn't crowned a dictator is not a Crown King just received power as a king notice 2,00,000 demons turn loose upon those Jews when they burn them they crucified them they put bubbles in their veins they kill them so they had no more gas to kill them with and they shot them until they had no more bullets to shoot with and they and they done everything they could do and they cremated their bodies and everything and hung on fences children and all innocent people because they were Jews they were done that way but God said he gave each one of them a role undeserving as it was but his grace to Blind them so we could see the seventh seal hasn't open yet you know that's his coming the next quote I'm going to play is from 1954 brother brand said the first wo happened in World War I and the second wo happened in World War II and of course I don't exactly agree with this quote I agree with brother Ram's other quote from the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel that was 7 years later brother Ram said the woes all take place during the Great Tribulation period And I don't believe we're living in the Great Tribulation period right now but anyways let's listen to these quotes just so the people are aware where brother R thought World War I was the first woe and World War II was the second woe let's listen to the quote there was three walls followed it the first one happened in World War I second one happened in World War II you see what we're going in now all right we're at the end of the road now by God's grace let's look at the events right before the Rapture that we're anticipating to happen these are the events I believe are now happening uh for the bride the world in Israel here's a screenshot I made I preached at our church a couple years ago for the bro what's happening right now is the maturation of the wheat laying in the presence of the sun according to Matthew 13:30 it's the uniting time of the bride with Christ Ephesians 4:13 2 Thessalonians 2 ver1 it's a lamp trimming time Matthew 25 1-13 and it's Malachi 4 time turning our hearts back to the apostolic fathers Malachi 4 5 and 6 it's also time to eat the book and prophesy again Revelation 10: 8-1 it's also the finishing of the Great Commission Matthew 24:14 the end cannot come until all nations have heard the gospel now the events for the world is the maturation and binding of the tears and it's got to be so close it would deceive the very elect if it were possible according to Matthew 13:30 Matthew 2424 the world is also seeing birth pains which are Wars pestilences earthquakes famines according to Matthew 247 and 8 the Millennium is the birth of of a new day a new heavens and new earth so the world is going through birth pains right now and in Israel right now the events are happening as Israelis are returning to the Homeland according to Isaiah 111-12 Jeremiah 23 3-8 and Luke 21:4 and they're also preparing for a temple now the events that I believe will still be future right before the Rapture for the bride will be the squeeze according to revelation 13:16 and Revelation 3:10 this is also known as the Mount Zion Showdown brother Bram told us in the church age book and also 1962 spoken word as Original Seed and then we're also waiting for the latter rain which is the final outpouring of the Holy Ghost rapturing Faith according to James 57 and Joel 2 23-26 which brother Ram spoke with thus sayith the Lord about the latter Reign and brother Bram said the fullness of the Pentecost will be in the bride due to the latter Reign thus sayith the Lord Joel 2 23-26 the world will be doing the squeeze of the One World Roman Le government according to Revelation 13:16 Revelation 3:10 and Daniel 233 also I believe the world will see the fourth major Vision fulfilled the fifth major vision and the sixth major Vision fulfilled right before the Rapture and then perhaps with a question mark maybe we'll see Israel starting to rebuild their Temple I don't know if that'll be before the Rapture or after after Now by God's grace here's the Bible verses that allowed me to get to the order of the Great Tribulation period all the events in the Great Tribulation period first is revelation 7:3 which says hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of God in our foreheads this scripture is so important the Earth cannot be hurt not one tree not the sea the Earth can not be hurt until the 144,000 have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost according to Revelation 7 but this is important because it places the blowing of the trumpets after the 144,000 Jews have been sealed with the Holy Ghost and that's because in Revelation 8: 7 the first trumpet sounds and a third part of the trees were burnt up all the green grass was burned up so this is why I believe the trumpets have not sounded yet there's never been a time on the Earth when all the green grass was burned up so those two verses together are my first point Revelation 73 and Revelation 87 the first trumpet has not sounded and cannot sound until after the 144,000 are sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the second point is revelation 3:10 this tells us the bride will not be on the Earth when the mark of the beast is Lain down because Jesus said because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the the hour of Temptation which will come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth so I believe the bride will hear whispers about the mark of the beast but the bride will be raptured before they actually have to make a decision to take or reject the mark of the beast of course the bride would have rejected it but the bride won't be here according to Jesus's own words in Revelation 3:10 the next verse is revelation 12:14 this says the woman Israel was given two wings of a great eagle that she would fly into the Wilderness where she's nourished for a time that's a year times two years and a half time so three and a half years from the face of the serpent this verse is important because God's going to protect Israel for the first three and a half years of the Great Tribulation period and this means the mark of the beast cannot be laid down during this time period because if the Mark was laid down then the 144,000 Jews would be killed because they would not take the mark of Rome and then they could not receive the Lord Jesus and receive the Seal of the Holy Ghost so again Revelation 12:14 tells me the mark of the beast cannot be laid down until the second half of the seven-year Great Tribulation period and the fourth and final verse I want to read is Revelation 11 veres 13 and 14 here we see the order of the second woe the second woe is the earthquake in Jerusalem that causes a tenth part of the city to fall 7,000 people are killed in Jerusalem and the Bible says the second woe is passed behold the Third Woe cometh quickly so here we see the second woe has to be at the end of the first half of the Great Tribulation period so that means the first woe and the first six trumpets must be also during that first 3 and 1/2 year period and we'll try to line this up here on a visual by the grace of God okay now let's uh look at a visual here of the timeline of the events of the 7-year Great Tribulation period And Friends of course I'm open to correction especially with this topic because it doesn't pertain to Salvation so in any area where I'm wrong please let me know I'll try to make some corrections perhaps I'll do a part two on this series we'll see by God's grace so I begin with this screen Daniel's 70th week or 7year tribulation period we can see the end of the church ages there the event that ends the church ages of course is the rapture that's the bride going up the catching away or Rapture of the Bride according to 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 for Corinthians 15: 51-54 and after the Rapture of the Gentile bride We Begin this 7-year tribulation period called Jacob's trouble or the six seal we're taught so this red rectangle represents the first three and 1/2 years of the seven-year Great Tribulation period and this begins with the torment Ministry of Moses and Elijah because we're told the exact number of days they're going to minister 42 months mon or 3 and 1/2 years which is 1,260 days and notice what they begin doing they begin causing no rain and they turn water to blood there in the Jerusalem area next the second event would be the Pope's 7-year Covenant again this is a 3 and 1 half year Covenant so this has to happen very closely around the same time the two prophets are revealed according to Daniel 927a shortly after that then I believe the temple will be rebuilt and they'll begin offering animal sacrifices according to Revelation 11 3-13 the fourth event would be Jesus revealing himself to and then sealing 144,000 Jews according to Revelation 71- 8 Zechariah 12: 10 all the way through 13 13: 1-6 then once Israel sealed as we mentioned earlier according to Revelation 7 3 and Revelation 87 then the trumpets can begin to sound the two prophets will call forth these trumpets which also include the first woe and this is revelation chapters 8 and9 and to me this is when the sudden destruction prophecy after the peace and safety Mantra is going to be fulfilled according to first Thessalonians 5:3 people are saying peace and safety peace and safety they have a seven-year Covenant Israel got their Temple but then these six trumpets will be sudden destruction that comes upon the whole earth because the torment Ministry of Moses and Elijah will first be only in the Jerusalem area but then after the Jews are sealed then the wrath of God will begin to be poured out upon the rest of the earth okay and that will finish the first half of the seven-year Great Tribulation period and here comes the next rectangle for the second half of the Great Tribulation period the second half of the 70th week in other words and I just summarized this last three and a half years as the seven vials and Armageddon the first event of this time period will be the death and Rapture of Moses and Elijah which includes the second woe that earthquake there in Jerusalem that kills 7,000 yet the remnant of Jews will see them resurrected and they'll Rejoice the seventh event would be the pope breaking his Covenant with Israel of course the pope won't be happy about that he's a Roman Catholic and when he sees these Jewish prophets resurrected that will make him angry he'll recognize the power of Jesus remember he's filled with Satan so Satan always hates the power of the Lord so that will cause the pope to break the Covenant with Israel the next event will be the abomination of desolation which according to uh Daniel 12:11 is 30 days after he breaks the Covenant and also that'll be 2 Thessalonians 2:4 in fulfillment where he sits in the temple of God claiming that he is God the ninth event will be the mark of the beast laid down now that he's sitting in the temple of God claiming that he is God he'll be able to lay down the mark of the beast according to Revelation 13 15-18 the 10th event is the vials numbers 1-5 will be poured out according to Revelation 15 16-11 and then the 11th event will be the six vial poured out that dries up the Euphrates so the kings of the East probably China can come to Jerusalem according to Revelation 161 12-16 the 12th event is the great will be judged in the seventh vow by Russia brother Bram told us that thus sayi the Lord according to Revelation 16: 17 through 18: 24 this is called also the day of Wrath according to revelation 62-17 these are just my thoughts next here the next this 12th event will also include Los Angeles Sinking by a mighty earthquake according to Revelation 1618 the Bible said this would be the worst earthquake in human history then I also believe this is when the USA will be bombed which is brother Ram's 7eventh vision of the seven major Visions according to Revelation 16:20 all the mountains flee away there's no more islands and this is all happening pretty simultaneously ly also because Revelation 188 says the will be judged with fire I know that refers to the Vatican City but also refers to United States because the United States is the Beast coming up out of the land according to Revelation 13 11-18 because there's only one beast that's the spirit of Rome so the United States has the spirit of Rome behind it again according to Daniel's interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's Dream from Daniel chapter 2 the feet of iron and Clay of course is the Catholic iron and the Protestant clay and the 13th event would be the battle of Armageddon this is where all nations come to battle at Jerusalem the kings of the north Russia Kings of the South I don't know who that would be maybe Egypt I don't know the kings of the East again likely China will be defeated by Jesus according to Zechariah 14 1-3 Revelation 1911 through 21 and Ezekiel chapters 38 and 39 remember friends in Ezekiel 39 verse 9 it says it's going to take 7 years for Israel to burn all the weapons of all these armies that came against Jerusalem and then in verse 12 of Ezekiel 39 it says it's going to take s months to bury all these slain soldiers then the next event the 14th event will be the fervent heat burning Heaven and Earth and this is preparing Ashes to be on the earth so the Saints the righteous can walk upon the ashes of the wicked according to Malachi 4 verse 1-3 and the fervent heat was spoken of is 2 Peter 3: 10-12 the 15th event I have on here is the seventh trumpet sounds because when this trumpet sounds It's the final trumpet and it says the kingdoms of the world have become the kingdoms of our God Revelation 11: 15-9 finally the millennial age will set in where Christ and his bride will rule for 1,000 years Kings and Priests upon the Earth in glorified bodies in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I spent years revisiting this topic again and again part of this timeline is in my 2021 book on the 12 New Testament Mysteries I thought it'd be helpful I thought it'd be very interesting to go through the scriptures and quotes from God's Prophet brother brandom and try to place these events in their correct order but again this doesn't pertain to Salvation I could be completely wrong on some of these events but this is a good exercise and rightly dividing the word of Truth and also helps us to watch and pray watch the world events pray watch Israel that's God's time piece so that we're ready to escape all these things that should come upon the Earth as Jesus said Luke 21:36 said watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that should come to pass and to stand before the son of man so by God's grace let's keep watching let's keep praying let's keep on the full armor of God the Bible said having done all you can do stand against the Ws of the devil according to Ephesians chapter 6 and by God's grace if we stand and overcome the devil we'll stand before the son of man as Overcomers will be at the meeting in the air the catching away of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ before these awful tribulation events occur if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
