TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 21. the themes of this chapter include the new Heaven and Earth and the New Jerusalem the new Heaven and Earth have now come fulfilling the prophecy of Peter in second Peter 3 verses 7 through 10. the first heaven and first Earth have now passed away with the great noise and fervent Heat the earth and the works that were therein have been burned up there is no more sea no physical Temple no need for the light of the Sun and no nighttime for all things are new John who before had been invited to see the great or filthy woman in Revelation 17 verse 1 is now invited to come and see the great holy city the bride the Lamb's wife the New Jerusalem the great holy city is described in all of its beauty and Splendor and is likened unto a bride adorned for her husband this holy city has a glorious light clear as Crystal a great high wall with 12 foundations and 12 gates showing Christ's faithful dedication to his Covenant Promises to the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 Apostles of Jesus Christ the measurements of this Four Square City prove it must be in the shape of a pyramid for a cube-shaped city would not allow for the light of the Lamb to reach every area in the city and the Nations that are outside the city the kingdom Jesus waited to rule has come we now see Jesus's Timeless wisdom and discernment fully Vindicated as all of Satan's kingdoms that he tempted Jesus with in Matthew 4 verse 8 have now been burned and destroyed the only Kingdom that remains is the kingdom of God Almighty and Jesus is the worthy proven and rightful ruler the symbols and key Revelations include The Descent of the New Jerusalem the Overcomers the kings of the earth and the gates of the city The Descent of the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven is a beautiful picture of God coming to physically and eternally dwell with his people this Descent of God was prefigured at Jesus's baptism at the River Jordan when God the father in the form of a dove descended to unite and dwell in the body of Jesus the son of God uniting Heaven and Earth the same spirit-filling experience is also experienced by every born-again child of God today as the baptism of the Holy Ghost unites the spirit of Christ from Heaven into the Earthly vessel of the True Believer in the believer's soul the Overcomers are said to inherit all things as the true sons of God these are the Overcomers from the seven Church ages found in Revelation chapters two and three having overcome all of Satan's Temptations and sins which included unbelief Abomination murder sorcery idolatry lying and all other defilements anyone guilty of not repenting of these evils will have already had their part in the Lake of Fire which is the second death the Overcomers made their calling and election sure during their lifetimes According to second Peter 1 verse 10 and their obedient lives proved their names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life the kings of the Earth are described in verses 24-26 it seems God will have kings men given higher rewards and responsibilities ruling the entire population of the new Earth God will have different degrees of rewards given to those who inherit eternal life based upon the works and Faith they expressed during their Earthly lives before Christ's second coming as seen in Luke 16 verses 10 through 12. First Corinthians 3 verses 8-15 and Matthew 25 verses 20 through 30. these Kings will bring their glory and honor of their own Nations into the holy city the New Jerusalem this City's Gates will never be shut according to verse 25. City Gates usually symbolize security and access so we learn that the New Jerusalem will have an abundant entrance to all at second Peter 1 verse 11 says for there is no sin and darkness in any heart Satan death and Hell have all been destroyed the great city is free from all defilement of sin God and men now dwell in perfect complete Harmony the fact that these Gates of the New Jerusalem are still standing are a testimony that Jesus words were true that the gates of hell would not Prevail against the Overcomers and now the Overcomers are living within the gates of the New Jerusalem the timing of events for this chapter seem to be chronological the New Jerusalem must first descend from heaven verse 2. and then the gates will open allowing entrance into this holy city and all the glory and honor from every nation will flow into her within her magnificent walls if you'd like more Bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the Book of Revelation please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
