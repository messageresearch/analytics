TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I pray tonight Lord let the Holy Spirit take my mistakes Lord and correct them in the hearts of the people greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show how God's true Prophet The Late William brandham prayed that the Holy Ghost would correct any mistakes he made during a sermon in the hearts of the people the listeners the Believers who heard the preaching of the word from the prophet of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed through St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Marian brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character in this video we'll play two quotes from God's Prophet where he prayed that the Holy Spirit would correct the mistakes he made during the sermon in the hearts of the people and to me this is how a real prophet of God would pray a real prophet of God would know he's not perfect he's not infallible he's only infallible when he speaks thus sayith the Lord or in the name of the Lord when prompted by the Holy Ghost but other than those times he was human and therefore he'd make human mistakes but in his Godly humility he asked the Lord that the Lord would correct any mistakes he made in the hearts of the people so this video defends God's Prophet brother brandham against those who worship brother brandham those who idolize brother brandham or worship brother Ram's tapes by falsely saying every word on brother Rams tapes are thus sayith the Lord that's a lie that's heresy this video rebukes that Spirit of idolatry that surrounds the deceived people that claim to follow brother Ram's Ministry but they really don't because they're in air the only reason someone would be upset with this type of video is because they have an evil spirit of idolatry or a lying Spirit but to those of us who are true Holy Ghost filled Believers this video rejoices our hearts cuz we see the humility of a real prophet of God friends it's Satan that wants Believers to turn off their gifts of discernment when listening to brother brandom because even brother brandham said I've always asked you to be careful of what you're listening to to separate the human side of brother brandom from the prophetic gift side of course that's from he cares do you care 1963 now see I always asked you to be careful what you're listening to see there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus sayeth the Lord even to Visions or anything so the quote I'll begin with is from works as Faith expressed November 26th 1965 brother is praying right before he gets to his text and he says I pray tonight Lord let the Holy Spirit take my mistakes Lord and correct them in the hearts of the people make it real and make it a real night that he can bed himself into Into the Heart of each believer so this quote is at the end of brother Ram's Ministry of course it's after the seals have been revealed let's listen to the quote I pray tonight Lord that somehow you'll build faith in these people's hearts that every one of them will be delivered all these sick and Afflicted people may it be so simple Lord just let us as we try to teach the word let the Holy Spirit take my mistakes Lord and correct them in the hearts of the people and make it a real real night that the that he can bed himself into the heart of each believer here next is a quote from the countdown November 25th evening service 1962 brother B is praying and he asks where we have made a mistake so he's speaking of preachers in the five-fold ministry the great holy spirit will take the words and wind them around and fix them in the hearts in the correct way that they might understand that that's preparation time now before the going away of the church again such a humble prayer from a true man of God he knew that he was a fallible person he made mistakes in his own human thinking and he prayed for himself and other preachers that would make mistakes that the Holy Spirit would bring correction to it the only way the Holy Spirit can do that is by pointing the Believers to the word of God because the word of God is infallible and brother R said the Holy Ghost will only point you to the word of God the Holy Ghost will only direct you to the word of God not outside the word of God the holy spirit is a compass the North Star is the word and the compass will only point to the North Star and the Holy Ghost will only point you to the word not some ecumenical move not some denomination but to the word of God Amen you remember all the other stars shift with the world but the North Star stays exactly because it's in the center and every other man's word will fail but God's word Can't Fail it's a NSTAR centered it won't shift with the world no matter where the world is it Remains the same yesterday today and forever and he is the word let's listen to the quote Lord Jesus uh forgive us of our our ways that maybe we fail somewhere maybe to get the message just the way it should be but father I pray that where we have made a mistake that the great holy spirit will take the words and wind them around and fix them into the hearts in the correct way that they might understand that's preparation time now before they're going away of the church so friends after hearing these two quotes I thought about the ridiculous comment some people say is how dare you correct God's Prophet but we would say how dare you deny ignore discredit or take away brother brenham's scriptural prayers that we just played and that you were able to listen to why would you discredit those prayers how dare someone ignore what brother Brandon prayed to the Lord Jesus Christ that even though he made mistakes he asked the Holy Spirit to correct them in the hearts of the people and again how dare you worship and idolize a man that is not Jesus Christ how dare you make every word of any sinner Say by Grace infallible and as the brandom Tabernacle believes how dare brandom Tabernacle make every word on the tape thus sayi the Lord their Pastor Joseph Brenham has said that numerous times that's what people should dare not do is idolize a man or deify the tapes or deify brother brandham now briefly let's review the Bible truth behind this it's from Romans 3:4 God forbid let God be true but every man a liar every man has told a lie outside of the Lord Jesus Christ but he's a new creation he was the beginning of the new creation of God he was a God man all of us are just men with God inside of us if we're born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but Jesus was the word made flesh he was and is the image of the invisible God Romans 3 continues to say this in verse 10-4 there's none righteous know not one verse 12 says they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there's none that doeth good know not one their throat is an open supplier with their tongues they've used deceit the poison of ASP is in under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness so we see at some point in every person's life other than the Lord Jesus Christ they're not righteous they don't seek after God they're not profitable and their tongue speaks things that are wrong they say things that do not honor God then remember you know Abraham Li lied twice about Sarah being his wife he was the first man called a prophet in the King James version Bible in the Book of Genesis we know Moses called Israel Rebels and then miss the promised land because that wasn't the will of the Lord not every word Abraham or Moses said was thus sayi the Lord and then Elijah even told God in the cave that he was the only believer left but God had to correct him and say there was 7,000 still remaining that had not bowed the knee to Baal so again this proves that not every word a prophet says is thus sayi the Lord but a prophet is infallible when he speaks in the name of the Lord with thus sayith the Lord and so we know brother random meets this requirement along with these other prophets of course Abraham Moses Elijah and many others by the grace of God now let's look at five not infallible quotes if you type in not infallible the phrase there's eight hits five of them are times brother Ram says prophets are not infallible the first in 1955 the True Vine and a false Vine brother bandam said prophets they're not infallible people and he gives Elijah as an example the next quote from 1957 brother random said proves God just reveals To His prophets that what he wants them to know nothing else prophets are not infallible people he was speaking of how Isaac blessed Jacob instead of Esau and then Jacob held on a Joseph's coat for 40 years bloody thinking an animal killed it and an animal didn't kill Joseph and yet he was a prophet thirdly 1959 possessing the enemy's Gates brother Ram said men are are not infallible but God is he said man you get your mind on a man he'll make a mistake maybe not willfully but he'll do it God permits him to do it so that he can shake your faith away from man so look how merciful god is God lets prophets or any other person make a mistake so the people watching the prophet or the person do not trust in the man that their faith is only in the Lord Jesus Christ I like this one from 1961 questions and answers brother Ram says at the beginning of this recording he said these answers are not infallible because the scriptures is infallible he says I know the scriptures are infallible but my answers are not infallible so I'm sure everyone understands that and these answers are not infallible see because the scriptures is infallible and as far as I know they're line with the scriptures I hope that makes it plain and the tape is to be uh kept now and anyone would want it well could have it but now I know the scriptures are infallible but my answers are not infallible so I'm sure everyone understands that and if it's not the if it's not infallable then you have a right maybe to ask me so we thank God for having brother Ram say this and yes brother random every holy ghost filled person understands that that you are not infallible but Jesus Christ and his his Bible are infallible it's sad though now most tape church people and tape worshippers don't understand what brother Adam is trying to explain to them I wish they would play this tape in Brenham Tabernacle and around the world to people that worship the tapes and Fifth and finally from calling Jesus on the scene 1963 brother Ram said if I make mistakes you pray for me I'm not infallible I'm your brother here in this final section I want to recall some videos that are related the first one was not every word brother random said was thus sayith the Lord this is a 27 minute long video this will help you a lot if you listen to it if you wonder about how a prophet can be fallible in his human side or in his [Music] Humanity next I have a three-part series called 60 plus proofs the tapes of brother brandham have mistakes yet he's a true Prophet there's over an hour and a half of teaching there showing specific examples starting at the beginning of Bam's recordings going all the way through the Church age book which would be the end of 1965 the next video was brother Ram's hum side welcomed correction plus who are you to correct God's Prophet this is over 30 minutes again of teaching from Brother Ram's quotes and the Bible on this important subject remember brother Ram said he could be corrected by his wife brother Neville other brothers in the congregation fact he's corrected live on a tape recording brother R was corrected by brother sheritt and appreciated it brother R made time for Baptist to try to correct him Pentecostals to try to correct him and I'll play this quote cuz this is a new quote that I don't think I put on the previous video on brother R's hum side welcome correction on January 19th 1965 brother random preached the god who's rich in Mercy and he said it's a privilege to have the other preachers on the platform he said I feel kind of small to stand here and speak with such theologians behind me and maybe they will correct me if I'm wrong I hope so so brother Ram's either lying the truth or being sarcastic I believe he's being honest so again this quote would agree with all the other quotes from that video showing how brother Brandon welcomed correction because he realized he wasn't infallible of his own human thinking his human side was not infallible let's listen to the quote the friends that I've know for so many years it's certainly a privilege to see them here tonight I feel kind of small to stand here and speak with such theologians behind me and uh maybe they'll correct me when I'm wrong I hope so lastly there's a series of 24 plus brandom Tabernacle lies and there's a playlist with all these videos on my YouTube channel if you'd like to study this out deeper this is one of the most important studies I think I've ever done by the grace of God because it shows the insanity of the tape worship movement the Press Play and Obey false movement all 24 their lives Li are refuted by the scriptures and by other quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham the brandham Tabernacle has so many lies and attacks on the five-fold ministry and they repeatedly contradict quotes from The Prophet they claim to believe so again we rejoice in the truth of God's word and the holy life that God's Prophet brother random Liv the honest life the sincere life the Christian Life brother Rand lived in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the great of God again it's awesome to see how a true prophet of God prays he prays for God to correct his mistakes he's humble enough to realize he's human he makes mistakes he's not perfect The Human Side is never perfect but he loves the people so much and he loves the Lord so much he prays and asks the dear Lord to fix any mistakes he might have made and that's what God is constantly doing as we listen to brother Brandon we catch so many great truths but there's also times brother R makes mistakes most recently I saw this when I preached through the sermon the Rapture from December 4th 1965 there's two obvious mistakes in the sermon brother Ram said Enoch was the seventh from Noah and of course he made a mistake there not on purpose but because he was rushed the woman was trying to get them out of the hotel room now we find here that Enoch was the seventh from Noah which was a type of the church ages the Bible said Enoch was a seventh from Adam but brother Ram said Enoch was a seventh from Noah so again here's the scripture Jude 1:14 and Enoch also the 7eventh from Adam prophesied of these so anyone who knows the Bible timeline knows that Noah wasn't even born till around 60 or 70 years after Enoch was raptured so Enoch could not have been the seventh from Noah Enoch could not have been a descendant of Noah and anyone who would say Enoch was the seventh from Noah was thus sayi the Lord is insane they have an idolatrous Spirit they have a lying Spirit anointing them second brother Ram said the Rapture takes place in 2 Thessalonians he said we which are alive and remain will not prevent or hinder them that are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise up the next Rapture takes place is second Thessalonians for the church the bride to be resurrected to be raptured into Glory we which are alive and remain that's the bodies left on Earth will not prevent or hinder them which are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound first and the dead in Christ shall rise see and we which alive and remain shall caught up together with them of course brother ROM means first Thessalonians but he says this numerous times I think two or three times he calls it 2 Thessalonians 4 when it's actually first Thessalonians 4 so again to me this is God answering brother Ram's prayers from back then in real time as preachers preach the word of God and they they hear the Teaching Ministry the teaching Reign Ministry the more Reign from Joel 2 23-26 as we're receiving the teaching Reign from God's Prophet brother brandom and awaiting the latter rain rapturing faith God is answering the prayer of brother Bram that the Holy Ghost corrects these things in our hearts so again God is so faithful to be still answering his prophet's prayers right here in 2024 again this reminds me of 2 Chronicles 36 veres 15-1 17 God sent them by his Messengers because he had had compassion on his people and yet people will still mock The Messengers of God and despise his words and misuse His prophets so these two quotes from God's Prophet brother Brandon prove God was having compassion on his people brother Brandon prayed compassionately that any human mistakes he made would be fixed by the holy ghost in the hearts of the Holy Ghost filled Believers which we know is happening right now praise the Lord for his grace and mercy if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
