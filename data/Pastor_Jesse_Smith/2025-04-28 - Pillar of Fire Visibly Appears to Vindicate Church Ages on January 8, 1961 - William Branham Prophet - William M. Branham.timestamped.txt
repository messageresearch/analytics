[0:03] Now look this way you y'all. Now that's
[0:05] just like it is when it comes on the
[0:06] glory here. See it come. It's a light
[0:09] where you're you're moving here. You
[0:11] see? Now look. It's just it's just a
[0:13] reflection. Just a reflection. That is
[0:15] See, it's not the light. Here's the
[0:16] light hanging right here. See? Right
[0:18] here. This woman. I just happened to
[0:20] catch it. I thought it was over
[0:21] somebody.
[0:23] [Music]
[0:25] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:29] this video is to show the quote from
[0:32] God's prophet, brother Brandham, when
[0:34] the pillar of fire became visible in
[0:36] Brandham Tabernacle at the conclusion of
[0:38] his series on the seven church ages.
[0:41] This recording is from January the 8th,
[0:44] 1961. The sermon is called
[0:47] Revelation 4, part 3. I always love
[0:50] listening to this quote. It's so
[0:52] supernatural. It's so emotional. But
[0:54] before we hear the quote, I'd like to
[0:56] first give a Bible foundation for the
[0:59] seven church ages. I wrote an entire
[1:01] chapter about this topic, the seven
[1:03] church ages, in my 2021 book, The 12 New
[1:06] Testament Mysteries Revealed. The
[1:08] foundation for the seven church ages in
[1:10] the Bible is Revelation 1 20. The Bible
[1:14] calls the church ages the mystery of the
[1:16] seven stars and the seven golden
[1:19] candlesticks. The seven stars are the
[1:21] seven angels or church age messengers in
[1:24] the hand of Christ. And of course, the
[1:26] seven golden candlesticks are the seven
[1:29] church
[1:29] ages. The word ages is used in the King
[1:33] James version. Paul talked about
[1:35] previous ages before his age. That's in
[1:38] Colossians 1 26. So there was past
[1:41] ages. Ephesians 3:5 also says there was
[1:45] past ages.
[1:48] And then Ephesians 3:21 says there's
[1:52] future ages. Unto him be glory in the
[1:54] church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[1:57] ages, world without end. So it's
[2:00] undeniable that the Bible teaches there
[2:02] was past ages and future ages. It's thus
[2:06] sayaith the Lord. It's thus sayith the
[2:07] scripture. So anyone that denies church
[2:10] ages is probably just ignorant of the
[2:12] Bible or maybe they have an antichrist
[2:14] spirit. Either way, we can pray for them
[2:16] by the grace of God. And also I'd like
[2:18] to play this quote from God's prophet
[2:20] brother Brandham from the seventh seal
[2:22] March 1963 where he says the revelations
[2:25] of the seven seals lined up with the
[2:28] revelations from the seven church ages
[2:30] with thus say the lord. So that means we
[2:32] know the revelations contained in the
[2:35] sermon series on the seven church ages
[2:37] and the sermon series on the seven seals
[2:40] are thus sayith the lord from the lord.
[2:42] Not every word though on those sermons
[2:45] are thus sayith the lord. Only the
[2:47] revelations from Jesus given to brother
[2:49] Brandham are thus sayith the Lord. Let's
[2:51] listen to the quote. Now the vision plus
[2:54] the word plus the history plus the
[2:57] church ages and all blend together. So I
[3:01] could truly say that to the best of my
[3:04] understanding and according to the word
[3:06] of God and the vision and the
[3:09] revelation, the interpretation thereof
[3:11] is thus saith the Lord. Also one more
[3:15] verse. Revelation 10:1-7, the mighty
[3:18] angel comes down, Christ. He brings down
[3:20] an open book. The book that was
[3:21] previously sealed in heaven, now has
[3:23] been opened. Jesus has broken the seven
[3:26] seals. He's revealed them, of course, to
[3:28] John in the symbol form in around 90 or
[3:33] 180 sometime in there. And then Christ
[3:35] coming down here in Revelation 10:1-7 is
[3:38] the Holy Ghost coming down to visit
[3:40] brother Brandham and reveal the secrets
[3:43] of the seven seals. and seven church
[3:45] ages to brother Brandham. But in the
[3:47] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[3:49] when he shall begin to sound, the
[3:51] mystery of God should be finished, as he
[3:53] hath declared unto his servants, the
[3:55] prophets, the mystery of God is finished
[3:58] through the ministry of the seventh
[4:00] angel or the seventh church age
[4:01] messenger. And we know that is William
[4:03] Brandham by the grace of God. Now, let's
[4:06] listen to this quote from January 8th,
[4:08] 1961. There's a blank spot on the tape,
[4:11] but we'll pick it up around paragraph
[4:13] 381. Brother Ram tells the people to
[4:16] look this way. It's the light over here.
[4:19] Brother Ram said, "You're seeing one
[4:21] light, but he was seeing two." The
[4:23] people were seeing the supernatural
[4:25] light of the pillar of fire. But brother
[4:26] Ram was able to see the supernatural
[4:29] light of the pillar of fire move over
[4:31] the people during this discernment time.
[4:33] Brother Ram saw over a woman. He said,
[4:35] "Right here at this woman." And then it
[4:37] goes to a man. And there's a man sitting
[4:39] on the outside here. He's from Seymour,
[4:41] Indiana. God heals him of a stroke. So,
[4:44] I want you to hear the emotion, the
[4:46] worship. Such an emotional time here.
[4:48] What a wonderful visitation of the Holy
[4:51] Ghost visiting Brother Brandham and the
[4:54] saints there. Let's listen to the quote.
[4:57] Now, look this way, y'all. Now, that's
[4:58] just like it is when he comes on the
[5:00] glory here.
[5:01] See? Come. It's a light where you're
[5:03] you're moving here. You see? Now, look.
[5:05] It's just it's just a reflection. just a
[5:08] reflection. That is, see, it's not the
[5:09] light. Here's the light hanging right
[5:11] here. See, right here, this woman, I
[5:13] just happened to catch it. I thought it
[5:15] was over somebody.
[5:22] [Music]
[5:26] Now, you're seeing one, I'm seeing
[5:28] two. One of them is the natural, the
[5:30] other is the supernatural. There's a man
[5:32] sitting on the outside here on this line
[5:35] looking over towards that light struck
[5:37] him. He's from Seymour, Indiana, and
[5:40] he's got had a stroke. If you'll
[5:42] believe, sir, God will heal you of that
[5:44] stroke.
[5:45] [Music]
[5:46] Amen. Believe. Now, you believe with all
[5:49] your
[5:50] heart. Now, I want to show two pictures
[5:53] here. The first picture is an
[5:54] illustration someone made. I saw it on
[5:57] social media a number of years ago and I
[5:59] took a screenshot of it and it shows
[6:01] from the pulpit where brother was
[6:03] speaking the pillar of fire shaded the
[6:06] church ages in the back left corner. So
[6:09] from his perspective, it was in the back
[6:12] left. And then in 2018, I visited the
[6:14] Brandham Tabernacle and had a tour and
[6:18] they told me the current place where it
[6:20] is is the place right above the windows
[6:23] of the cry room or the mother's nursery.
[6:26] So you can see a picture of that. Here's
[6:28] these four black windows. And they told
[6:30] me it was right above there in that
[6:32] space between the windows and the
[6:34] ceiling where the Holy Ghost fell and
[6:36] shaded out the church. ages as brother
[6:39] Brandham
[6:40] said. Next I want to play a quote from 9
[6:43] days later. Brother Brandham was
[6:44] preaching in Shreveport, Louisiana,
[6:47] January 17th, 1961. And brother Ram told
[6:50] about this experience and he said the
[6:52] angel of the Lord, the light of the Holy
[6:54] Ghost, the pillar of fire came and stood
[6:56] right amongst the people and it caused a
[6:58] revival in his church. No doubt what a
[7:01] supernatural time in the Lord Jesus
[7:03] Christ that would have been. And brother
[7:04] Ram quotes the book of Zechariah that it
[7:06] would be light in the evening time in
[7:09] this dark sinful world. God said he
[7:11] would send his promised light, the Holy
[7:14] Ghost. And he says, "We're privileged
[7:16] people tonight." And what did it bring
[7:17] to us? The revelation of the seven
[7:19] church ages and later brought us the
[7:21] revelation of the seven seals. Let's
[7:22] listen to the quote.
[7:25] Be seated.
[7:26] [Music]
[7:32] It does seem like coming home to come
[7:35] back. We hearing back there from your
[7:37] pastor the wonderful things that the
[7:40] Lord has been doing here at the home
[7:41] church since I was here. Said you've
[7:44] almost had a constant revival of the
[7:47] outpouring of the Holy Ghost. Oh, isn't
[7:49] it wonderful to hit God's time just
[7:51] right high does something to us? Well,
[7:55] we've had one at the tabernacle. uh had
[7:58] a series of subjects I was telling you
[8:00] on the seven last church ages and oh my
[8:04] when I finished up last Sunday with the
[8:06] fourth chapter of Revelations my
[8:08] congregation was about little about 400
[8:11] people or 350 something like that and I
[8:15] while I was speaking and I called the
[8:17] prayer line and speaking on the
[8:19] reflection from the shakina glory to the
[8:22] stars to the char stars to the sea of
[8:25] glass were the sacrifices was washed,
[8:28] you know, which represents sinners, the
[8:29] waters of separation. And while I was
[8:33] speaking on that and turned then to pray
[8:35] for the sick, the angel of the Lord came
[8:37] right down before them all, went right
[8:40] over and stood in the corner there and
[8:43] 300 or more people stood, looked at it
[8:45] for 15 minutes, screaming, crying, and
[8:47] praising God. All of them looked the
[8:50] first time ever come like that before.
[8:52] Our church just come right in and moved
[8:53] right over there and stood there. I
[8:55] said, "Can you see it?" Everybody again
[8:56] screaming and falling and there it was
[8:58] the big amber light of the pillar of
[9:00] fire just perfectly round standing
[9:02] there. Then it began to shade itself and
[9:04] shaded every one of those church ages
[9:06] just exactly the way I'd taught him in
[9:09] that pillar of fire. God knows that's
[9:11] the truth here before his
[9:13] Bible. He We're living in the end time.
[9:16] Surely that's right. Oh, I'm so glad
[9:19] that the prophet promised it would be
[9:20] light in the evening.
[9:23] In this hour that when it's so dark in
[9:25] the world and to know that we are living
[9:28] and walking in the light, the light that
[9:31] he promised that he would do it,
[9:34] promised he would. And here we are, the
[9:36] privileged people tonight to enjoy those
[9:38] things at the end time. Now remember the
[9:42] church will not be it will not be a
[9:45] great great big something. It's always
[9:48] through every age just in the minority
[9:51] just a little and during the dark age it
[9:53] almost went completely out and then it
[9:55] goes almost out again in this age here
[9:58] at the lady of sin church age. Brother
[10:00] Jack invited me down to preach those
[10:02] seven church ages sometime. I hope I get
[10:04] a chance to do it. Oh, we sure enjoyed
[10:07] at home how the holy spirit blessed us.
[10:10] Next, I just want to show that there
[10:12] were two witnesses at least that
[10:14] testified about seeing this supernatural
[10:16] light there on January 8th, 1961. And
[10:19] I'm getting these from this book called
[10:21] Generation, written, of course, and
[10:24] compiled by Brother Am's granddaughter,
[10:26] Angela
[10:27] Smith. These two people are named Carl
[10:30] Wheeler and Betty Collins. Sister Betty
[10:34] wrote this. I was there when the light
[10:35] appeared on the back wall of the
[10:36] tabernacle at the preaching of the
[10:38] church ages. I was sitting about five
[10:40] rows from the back and on the same side
[10:42] where it appeared. Two girls that I knew
[10:45] were sitting nearby and they had been
[10:47] telling some jokes that were not very
[10:48] good. They told me later that when that
[10:51] light appeared over their heads, they
[10:52] thought they were going to fall over
[10:54] dead. As the light changed shapes,
[10:57] marking the different stages of the
[10:58] church ages, you could feel the presence
[11:00] of the Lord in the
[11:03] building. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord
[11:05] Jesus Christ. No doubt the Lord Jesus
[11:07] Christ bringing conviction to those
[11:08] individual girls and bringing
[11:10] vindication to sister Betty for
[11:13] believing the message and of course all
[11:14] the believers there and God's prophet,
[11:16] brother William Brandham. Brother Carl
[11:18] Wheeler wrote this. I was present in the
[11:20] tabernacle when brother Brandham
[11:22] preached the church ages and God himself
[11:24] came down and vindicated that prophet
[11:26] before my eyes. That light that appeared
[11:29] was such a supernatural thing to me.
[11:33] So again, we're thankful for the
[11:35] eyewitnesses who witness the visible
[11:37] appearing of the pillar of fire, the
[11:40] angel of the Lord. These are tremendous
[11:43] testimonies. We rejoice in them. And we
[11:45] rejoice that we've been given a
[11:46] vindicated prophet of God. We have a
[11:48] vindicated prophet, Brother William
[11:50] Brennham, with a vindicated message.
[11:52] It's the Bible revealed, the Bible
[11:54] restored. As Amos 3:7 says, "Surely the
[11:58] Lord God would do nothing, but he
[11:59] revealed his secret unto his servants,
[12:01] the
[12:03] prophets." Friends, Jesus Christ is our
[12:05] satisfaction. We just had a guest
[12:07] preacher preach two services this
[12:09] weekend. The titles were satisfaction
[12:11] and focus. So, I thought I would share
[12:13] that. I'll put links to those sermons in
[12:16] the description here. Let's be satisfied
[12:18] with the presence of the Lord Jesus
[12:20] Christ. It's the only satisfaction in
[12:22] life. Let's keep our focus on the Lord
[12:25] Jesus Christ. Our precious brother
[12:26] Dennis McBride preached some wonderful
[12:28] messages, discerning messages by the
[12:31] gift of the Holy Ghost in his
[12:33] life. If you have any questions,
[12:35] concerns or testimonies about this
[12:37] video, please contact
[12:39] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[12:42] be the desire of your heart. Very happy
[12:46] to be here this afternoon and again in
[12:48] defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to
[12:51] bring the good tidings, the good news
[12:53] that Jesus raised from the dead, living
[12:55] among man today, his church. The same
[12:59] Jesus that was yesterday will be today
[13:01] and
[13:02] forever. He is never failed.
