TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Friends, divine healing is just a minor. You can never major on a minor. As I said, salvation of the soul is much greater than divine healing. &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to look at major and minor doctrines as taught by God's prophet, brother William Marin Brennham. There was two sets of quotes that I studied recently. The first set is quotes that say pertain to salvation. There's only five hits on that. And then I looked at the other set of quotes about brother Ram saying never major on a minor. There's over 20 hits on that by God's grace. This is a very important topic because it involves majors such as salvation and I would say the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's also important because there's so much tape worship today or brother Brandham worship today around message churches. And so you have one extreme where they only listen to the tapes. The press play and disobey group I call them. Their headquarters is Brandham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville, Indiana. To them everything's a major because they say every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord. That's absolute heresy. But there's also a subtle tape worship by message preachers when they say just believe everything on the tape. I believe all the message. Just say amen to all the message. All these vague blanket statements that basically promote tape worship. So this is a great topic to study here by the grace of God and it's also found in the scripture. So let's start with the biblical foundation here. By the grace of God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the one who taught that there's majors and minors. We find this in Matthew 23:23. I'll be looking down here at my Bible. So says, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you pay tithe of mint and annis and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law." So I saw this verse this week and I was just so thankful. So the words major and minor aren't in the Bible regarding salvation, but the word weightier is. So weightier is an equivalent to major. So our Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh, says there's majors or weightier matters. And Jesus defines them as judgment, mercy, and faith. These ought ye to have done and not to have the other undone. So in this scripture, Jesus is saying tithes are a minor, but you should do the minors as well. But he rebuked the Pharisees for majoring on minors tithes rather than majoring on majors, which were judgment, mercy, and faith. We also see this principle in Matthew 22 the chapter before verses 36-4 about the greatest commandment. Jesus was asked which is the great commandment or greatest commandment. And the Lord Jesus quotes Deuteronomy 6:5. Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. So this is the Bible foundation for majors or weightier matters. I think this also applies here in Galatians 5:6. The Bible said faith works by love. So if loving God is the greatest commandment, then we know anyone with faith will do the works of God because of the love of God shed abroad in their hearts as the book of Acts says. So first you receive the love of God in your heart. When you get a heart of flesh and you get saved and God takes away your heart of stone, you get the love of God first. That love motivates your faith and then your faith goes to work by the grace of God. We're not saved by works. We're saved by grace through faith. It is a gift of God lest any man should boast. Next, I'm going to look at Matthew 5:1 19. Jesus said, "Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men, so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven." But notice he's still in the kingdom of heaven. So this is referring to foolish virgins, no doubt. But whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. The scripture opens up the truth about foolish virgins. Brother Ram says in the church age book that they live all that they know or they're God-fearing Christians, but they don't receive more revelation of God. They do not go into the depths of the Holy Spirit. The spirit of God searches the deep things. Yay, the deep things of God. So, this helps us understand why brother Brandon would say Catholics, Baptist, Methodists, Lutheran can all be saved if they're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ. They can still be saved, but they break some of the least commandments or some of the minor commandments such as tithe paying is a good example. And then if we go to 1 Corinthians 3, I believe it's 14 and 15. You could also actually start up in verse 11 in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and show how any man who builds upon the foundation of Christ must build the right way. If not, his works can be burned and lost. And the Bible says in verse 14 that his works can be burned but he himself shall be saved. And therefore the man the preacher would not get a reward other than eternal life. So again I'll repeat that preachers or any believer can be saved but miss out on rewards due to them not honoring both the majors and the minor doctrines of the Bible. One of the clearest examples is King Saul in 1st Samuel 13:13. He repeatedly rebelled against obeying the word of God. And the prophet Samuel said that the Lord would have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever if he had just obeyed. So here's a clear example of a believer missing out on rewards. His works were burned and he suffered loss, but he himself was saved. Another good example is Lot. Lot himself was saved, but his wife was lost, right? She turned around and looked back at Sodom and he had other family members that burned in the fires of Sodom cuz God will not destroy the righteous with the wicked. So he had wicked family members and they wouldn't believe his testimony. They wouldn't believe his warning about getting out of the city. So Lot's works were burned, but he himself was saved. King Saul and Lot then missed the major things God was doing in their day. King Saul did not have the judgment of God, the mercy of God, or the faith of God. Nor did Saul have the judgment, mercy, and faith of God. the weightier matters. So they were disobedient on the majors. So they did not keep all the word of God. We can see this also in Galatians 1 6-9. Paul said a man is accursed if he changes one word of the gospel. Now friends, all of us know denominational churches do not keep all the gospel. They change part of it. And yet brother Ram says some of these people can be saved. So this curse could be for the foolish virgins a temporary curse. But for the makeel believers, the Judas of Scare group, it would be a permanent curse or eternal judgment. Not eternal punishment, but eternal judgment. In other words, the sentence upon them as unbelievers would last eternally. They'd eventually be annihilated, as the Bible says. But we get this thought also from King Saul and Lot. And then a third witness is 1 Corinthians 11:30. Paul says there's temporary curses for taking the communion unworthily. He says many are weak and sickly among you because they did not examine themselves nor do they treat the body of Christ the right way. And brother Ram says that word curse. Brother Ram says this is a temporary curse. So here we see that temporary curses would fall on the foolish virgin who break the least of the commands and sometimes some of the major commands as well such as judgment, mercy and faith. Another verse is Philippians 1:15-18. Paul's writing from prison to the Philippians, but he says he rejoiced that Christ was being preached whether in pretense or not. So to me, I take this as a verse that relates to the foolish virgin. Brother Ram would say God can use Abraham in a dollar way, but Lot in a penny way. So we have these believers, these foolish virgins sitting out in denominational churches, but brother Ram says, "At least they're not in the bar. At least they're not at the prostitute house." And God can use a penny in a penny way. So I rejoice that Christ is preached in the Catholic church. Although I know very few will find salvation there. I rejoice that he's preached in the Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, Presbyterian churches, but I know very few will be saved there. As Jesus said in Matthew chapter 7, few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life. Then the Bible says in 1st Peter 4:17-19 that some people the righteous will be scarcely saved and righteous is the foolish virgin. We find that Revelation 22:11 we have the unjust that never believed the filthy Judas the scar group that sold out the gospel. You have the righteous which are the foolish virgin. And fourthly you have the holy group the wise virgin those who are baptized with the Holy Ghost. So, back to 1st Peter 4:17-19. Judgment begins at the house of God. And there'll be some that are scarcely saved. Just like King Saul, just like Lot, they're just barely saved. No real reward. They're just given the inheritance of eternal life. Also want to teach that heresies are major sins. 1 Corinthians 11:19 says, "Heres happen to make manifest those who are approved of God and no doubt those who are off the word of God." So, I've said it many times. The tape, church movement, press play and disobey, they are off the word of God. They're in heresy because they're exalting every word on Brother Ram's tapes to being equal to the Bible. They're essentially adding to the Bible. They're making Brother Random equal to God, which is wicked, sinful. It's an abomination. It's heresy. Brother Brandham said, "To make him infallible is Tommy Rot." I played that quote many times. If you need the quote, just let me know. In Galatians 5:20 and 21, the Bible lists heresies as one of the sins that do not inherit the kingdom of God. They're in the same group as murderers, adulterers, fornicators. So being a heretic in the sight of God is the same as being an adulterer or murderer. And that's why, friends, brother Ram would say so many times, we never want to major on a minor. These people go too far on extremes of exalting the tapes or exalting sensations, as we'll see here in a little bit. exalting experiences far above the word of God. It's very important that we emphasize the majors. Yes, we must keep the minors, but we must emphasize the majors. Titus 3:9-11 says, "A heretic is condemned of himself." So, it's that heretic's own sin that condemns him. Now, maybe not eternally if they can repent, but they're teaching the heresy in their own unbelief, their own sin. They've allowed themselves to get caught in the snare of the devil. And lastly, second Peter 2:es 1 and 2, Peter said, "False prophets bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord or the word that bought them, and many shall follow their pernitious or destructive ways." Brother Ram uses this scripture in chapter nine of the church age book to say, "In every case, you'll notice a false prophet is one who is outside the word." So that's why the tape church tape worship movement pressed plain obey movement is so dangerous. It's outside the word of God. They're literally adding all the sermons from 47-65 to the word of God. They're making that equal to the word of God. That's outside the word. The Bible says in Revelation 22:18 and 19, you cannot add one word or take one word away. It's as simple as looking at the 1977 prediction brother Brandon made. That's not in the Bible. So it's not thus sayeth the Lord. Brother Ram said numerous times it was not the Lord that told him that it was his own prediction. But if you say you believe every word on tape from 47 to 65 with thus sayith the Lord, you've just made that equal to the Bible. That's damnable heresy. Brother Ram said they are false prophets. For a true prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ. And he won't tell the people to fear him or what he says, but fear what the word says. You won't find all these 24 lies from Brandham Tabernacle in the word of God as I have a series on that. The 24 plus lies coming out of Brandham Tabernacle. And brother Brandham said that repeatedly. He could not add one word nor take one word away from the word of God. Now let's get into some of these quotes here. By God's grace, I just made a little list here. Now I basically got three quotes that talk about majors that are identified major doctrines or major topics. The first one is 1956. Hear ye him. Brother Ram says, "Salvation and born again are majors." Now, I believe at this point, Brother Ram thinks they're one and the same, but later on after 1963, after the seals are open, he realizes they're different things. Salvation is justification, the first step of grace. Being born again is the third work of grace. So, Brother Bam said, "Salvation of the soul is much greater than divine healing." Then he says in the next paragraph, when you're born again, you get an immortal spirit that cannot die. So again, we see the difference between divine healing. You get healed in the body, but your body will eventually die. If you get healed in the soul, your soul will never die. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Friends, divine healing is just a minor. You can never major on a minor. As I said, salvation of the soul is much greater than divine healing. Divine healing was included in the new new atonement because the old atonement had healing in it and the new ones are much better see than the old. If the old one refers healing, what about the new one? But divine healing is not on the same basis as salvation. When you're born again, you get an immortal spirit that cannot die. But when you're healed by divine healing, you will get sick and die again. Lazarus did and all the rest of them even raised from the dead. But it's the attributes of his resurrection. And it's the earnest of our resurrection that we will see. God said so. Now it's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Second, the church age book. Right at the beginning in the introduction, brother Ram said, "This volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as the Godhead, water baptism, etc." Though this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as the Godhead, water baptism, etc. found in Revelation chapters 1 through3, its main theme is the setting forth of a detailed study of the seven church ages. So now we see the godhead is included as a major doctrine and water baptism. Now we also have to remember that brother Random said trinitarians can be saved right after he said thus sayith the Lord. Trinitarianism is of the devil. And then he says all the way up to the end of his life that he believed people could be saved in denominational churches. He said trinitarians can be saved as long as they're trusting in the word. He said they don't have to believe everything that he taught. He said if they reject what he taught about the baptism of the Holy Ghost then they'll surely go in the tribulation period but they can still be saved because the word has already been judged. Brother Ram said that in questions Answers 1964 part one. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; What about the people that believe in the Lord now and don't and not the way you preach? They don't have to believe this. They don't have to believe the way I preach it. See, don't have to believe that. For the last day message will they be saved? Yes, if they believe the Lord. See, and if they they disagree and say, "I don't believe he's the word. I don't believe it this is right. I don't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost." That shows where they're headed for the tribulation period. But those who can accept the word in its fullness, not me preaching it because it's a Bible says so. &gt;&gt; Those who accept that is free because it the word's already been judged. The third and final quote where we can identify major doctrines is again the identified Christ of all ages. 1964 brother Ram said the main thing is divine healing of the soul. And brother Ram told us how divine healing of the body became a major. He said there's been so much self glory in it that it's given a bad taste before the public. He said it's been bless the Lord brother so and so laid hands on me and praise the Lord I got healed. Now if I could just omit that. So brother Ram said people started exalting the preachers who prayed for them rather than the Lord Jesus. He said if somebody could say the Lord Jesus made me well how much better that would be. You see brother Ram said we don't heal the people they're already healed. How many believes that? Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; So the Bible is perfectly true and that's what we stand on the Bible. It must be thus sayaeth the Lord. Uh we do believe that God can do things that's not written in this word because he's God. He does whatever he wishes. But yet I like to see anything when it comes in the line of a doctrine come out of the Bible. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I believe that the Bible is the full revelation of Jesus Christ. The Bible said that's what it is. It is the revelation of Jesus Christ. Nothing is to be added to it or anything taken from it. So I like to stay right into what it says and what it promises. If he just do what he promised, that's all I care to see anyhow. And I know I'll see him &gt;&gt; now. That's right. &gt;&gt; In this, we do not try to say we major in divine healing because divine healing is a minor. And you can never major on a minor. But about 86% I think it's estimated of Jesus ministry was on divine healing. He, as Dr. Bossworth used to say my one of my associates that just went to glory last few years about being about 84 years old. He said divine healing is a bait that's on a fish hook and you never show the fish the hook. You show him the bait. So he takes the bait and gets the hook. So that's that's what it is. We want to catch the fish for the Lord's glory. Catch them out of the world and bring them into the kingdom of God. And so divine healing, the main thing is divine healing of the soul. the body of Christ. It needs healing worse than anything that I know of is the body of Christ. It's been so broken up by man's theology and denominational differences until it's a sick body. And I and I tell you it it's needs healing, great healing. So I I trust that the Lord will do a great thing towards the healing of his part of the body that's in here. We believe that there is one one church &gt;&gt; and we never join it. &gt;&gt; Next Monday I'll be 55 years old and the Brandon family never did ask me to join their family. I was born to that's how I am. That's how we're Christians. We were born a Christian and you don't join it. You're born into it. &gt;&gt; Then you take the character of Christ. There's been so much in this last day of people who preaching divine healing has put so much self glory in it &gt;&gt; that it's given a bad taste before the public. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's been bless the Lord brother so and so laid hands on me and praise the Lord I got healed. Now if I could just omit that if somebody could say the Lord Jesus made me well. How much better that would be. You see? So with the little ministry that the Lord has given me is trying to bring him into your presence that you would lay your hands on him, your sacrifice, and be healed. It isn't so much of laying hands, which we do. We all we pray and lay hands on the sick. We don't heal the people. They're already healed. Every person is already healed. How many believe that? Now, let's see how our congregation's been taught. It's twothirds of them believes it. him now um that he was wounded for our transgressions. With his stripes we were healed. Every attribute that he died for at Calvary is ours from that time on. &gt;&gt; Everything that he died for, he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity, chastised our peace upon him. With his stripes we were healed. We were healed. Past tense. Every sinner is saved. From the day that Jesus died on the cross, he forgave every sin of man. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at the minor section. There's a lot more topics that are called minors by brother Brandham. The first one is divine healing 54. Brother Bram said, "Shouting, speaking in tongues do not pertain to salvation. You can have that and live a bad life." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." And here we have people up the altar tearing for this and tearing for that. When that make God's word a non effect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's got to take care of his word. &gt;&gt; And the minute you meet his requirement, God will answer his word that quick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's there to wait for it. &gt;&gt; Yes. But you see people saying, "Oh, unless we shout or unless we speak with tongues, unless we dance in the spirit." All those things are all right. They're all right. But they have nothing to do pertaining to salvation. No, &gt;&gt; they're not a thing. &gt;&gt; Cuz as soon as you repent of your sins, if truly God's convicted you and you've repented and been baptized in Jesus Christ name, God's under obligation to give you the Holy Spirit right then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Because his word said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he can't. There's nothing on God's part. It's your part. &gt;&gt; Because people's been mistaugh. &gt;&gt; Each time we come along, get a little something started. We say, "This is it. This is it." Oh my. It isn't these fleshed demonstrations. They're attributes of the Holy Spirit, but receive the Holy Spirit is to receive a person, Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then these other things take place in the life. &gt;&gt; We've seen people shout and live all kinds of life. We've seen people speak in tongues, do the same. We've seen people go out and pray for the sick to be healed and do live any kind of a life. Jesus said, "Many will come to me and say, Lord, have not I prophesied in your name?" Preach. Have not I cast out devils in your name? Yes. Have not I done these mighty works? Yes. He say, "Well, then depart from me, you workers of iniquity. I didn't even know you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Next, in 1958, the evidence of the resurrection, Brother Ram said, "Emotion, dancing, shouting, tongues, divine healing are all minors." Yet today, there are some message churches that will major on this. They'll major on experiences. Yet, I believe in experiences. Brother Brandon believed in experiences. But we got to be so careful not to major on a minor. And in the quote, brother Ram says, "We need divine healing of the soul, a breaking up. Souls on fire for God on fire down at the altar, tears running down their cheeks, but out trying to win the lost back to Christ again, a burden on their heart." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; But today, you can preach repentance and hell firing brimstone and people are laugh at it. &gt;&gt; What's the matter? Our hearts are cold. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we're indifferent. We got too much. &gt;&gt; We need less of the world and more of God. &gt;&gt; Our hearts are too cold. &gt;&gt; We become interested in some emotion. We become interested if if we can dance, if we can shout, I believe in it. &gt;&gt; If we can speak with tongues, I believe in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe in every bit of that. But if we have that and don't have that agonizing, &gt;&gt; weeping, broke up spirit, God can never use it. &gt;&gt; Now things are good. &gt;&gt; But we got to have the other to go with it. &gt;&gt; We've left off the main thing and gone for a secondary. &gt;&gt; And you can never major on a minor. &gt;&gt; We know that. Even in our own meetings, our own meetings has got too much to the place that's too much on divine healing instead of healing of the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, what we need today is a revival, &gt;&gt; a breaking up. &gt;&gt; Souls on fire for God. &gt;&gt; What I mean on fire is down at the altar with tears running down their cheeks. Not for five minutes and get up and forget it. without trying to win the lost back to Christ again. &gt;&gt; A burden on their heart. &gt;&gt; God take all the pleasures of the world and all of its fringes, all of its products, and put a burden on my heart for the lost to be my prayer. &gt;&gt; Next, this may surprise some, but brother Random called communion a minor. Brother Ram said, "Comunion does not pertain to salvation. It does not give you salvation. It's a commemoration. So, we know communion is important. It's a minor and if you don't do it right, there's a temporary curse that comes along with it as we said in 1 Corinthians 11:30. But, Brother Ram says, "Comunion does not save you." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Now, the communion is not a is not given for the purpose that many people think it is. It's t taught by a certain denomination of church that communion is called the last right that it pertains to salvation. Communion does not pertain to salvation. Communion does not give you salvation. Whether you take it in your death or or what it does not have nothing to do with your salvation. It is a commemoration. &gt;&gt; Jesus said and the gospel he said this do in remembrance of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not it leading or pointing to salvation but it's in commemoration of a finished work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's been done in you &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a commemoration. Now, there's many that take the communion is not saved. Many eat the Pascal lamb and perish in the wilderness. And many take the communion today that will never see God. But you cannot be a partaker of his salvation and not see him &gt;&gt; because salvation is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; And communion is commemoration of the great also sacrifice that was made for that salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's to let people see that we believe in the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; it represents the finished work. Salvation once was not completed and the offering of the goats, the sheep, the heers in the Old Testament because the Old Testament blood could not atone for sin. It could only cover sin. It was appointing to a time when it would be completed. Tomorrow night we're to get right in on that. &gt;&gt; But it was only a type. But when Jesus came and his blood was shed at Calvary, it was a complete divorcing of sin. &gt;&gt; It taken sin away. It's the only means of salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no church joining, no letters of fellowship. There is no ritual baptism. There's no communion art, nothing in the ritual or any article that's been left of God as articles pertain to salvation. It's all in commemoration of a finished work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Next, Brother Random says in life 1957, oil in the hands, seeing rainbows, other sensations do not pertain to salvation. Let's listen to the quote. Everywhere the Pentecostal has turned me down because I won't accept the evidence of the Holy Ghost as blood run out of your hands and oral run out of your hands and things like that and seeing uh rainbows and all those things. Sensations does not pertain to salvation. Not at all. We come solemnly by faith. We believe God and that's it. See, and so they wrote letters ahead into Canada and the Pentecostal just simply stepped aside like that. But uh would not have no cooperation or nothing to do in the meeting because I wouldn't accept that. And so I still no matter who accepts it or what does it, I stay with the blessed old Bible. Amen. This is God's word. We have to stand alone. We'll stand alone. Build a church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now before we approach his uh his uh word, let's just &gt;&gt; now look at a few other different quotes here that are helpful. This quote is from how can I overcome 63. Brother Brham's talking about he disagreed with another minister about the coming of the Lord. The minister disagreed with brother Brandham who believed that the church is raptured before the tribulation. Brother Brham said I can't agree with him because I don't see it but it doesn't pertain to salvation. It's pertaining to the coming of the Lord. So it seems to brother Brandham that the coming of the Lord did not pertain to salvation. So whether you believe the rapture is pre-tribulation, in the tribulation, or post-tribulation, brother Ram said that doesn't make you saved or lost. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; But I I can't agree with him because I don't see it. But the it doesn't pertain to salvation. It's pertaining to the coming of the Lord. He sees that the church has to go through the tribulation period for purification. &gt;&gt; I say the blood of Jesus Christ purifies the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; It needs No, I believe that the church goes through the tribulation period. Church organization. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the bride does not. &gt;&gt; Would you choose a woman you had to purify before you married her? &gt;&gt; Christ's bride is chosen &gt;&gt; and she is elected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she's God's bride, a bride of Jesus Christ. This next quote is very helpful. God keeps his word part two 1957. Brother Ram said salvation is based on the Bible not upon the amount of prayer nor on your sincerity. Cuz brother Ram brings up other religions. How Muslims pray more than Christians and how Buddhists can have experiences and be so sincere. But brother Ram said salvation does not pertain or is not based upon any other thing but the word of God. God's got to say so. Brother Ram said he wants our soul experience based on God's word so that it will stand. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Now, we cannot base salvation upon prayer. As good as it may be, we cannot base salvation on prayer. For if that be so, the Mohamads are saved, &gt;&gt; the Buddhas are saved, the heathens are saved. So it cannot be based on prayer and neither can it be based upon experience. Salvation is not based on experience because people can have any kind of an experience. The Mohamads have experiences, the Buddhist has an experience, and every different religion has experiences. And neither can salvation be based upon fasting, prayer, experiences, sensations, or sincerity. Many people say, "Well, it doesn't make any difference just what I believe as long as I am sincere in what I believe." Well, if that be so, the Mohamad is saved, the Buddha is saved, and all the rest of them, the heathens are saved. Or I say that they can outshine us any day. when it comes to prayer, fasting, sensations or so forth, they can outshine us. And salvation does not pertain or it is not based upon any other thing but the word of God. God's got to say so. Salvation cannot be based upon um any church or any creed. Nothing but the word of God. &gt;&gt; For it's God's word. God's word is so perfect that not one iot of it will ever fail. &gt;&gt; All the heavens will fail. the earth will fail. John said in the on the eye of Patmas, I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. God's word went right on just the same. All the word of God has to be fulfilled. Every word. So that's the reason I like to get people that I know I'm going to have to answer before in the day of judgment based not upon some of my own thoughts or based upon my own doctrine. I want their soul experience and all based on God's word so that it will stand because I know that in that great day we're going to have to answer for everything. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Over the years, I made numerous videos on many topics, and sometimes people get really upset with me. But I've always appreciated the brethren who could recognize the difference between majors and minors. Brother Ram said, "It's okay if we disagree on the minors, but we definitely want to agree on the majors." Heresies, of course, are majors. So, we have to warn people about heresies. And the main thing we want to do is get people saved by the grace of God. Get them baptized with the Holy Ghost in their soul. Help them see the revelation of the Godhead, the true water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We want their souls to have divine healing by the grace of God. We want their souls quickened. We want their souls sealed unto the day of redemption. And I think I'll end with this quote from questions and answers on the seal 63. I've shared this a couple times recently. Brother Bram's answering questions during this week of the seven seals. And he said, "If you have a different interpretation and believe your idea of it's right, just go ahead. Just go right ahead. that won't hurt because there's not only but about one or two of them that pertains to anything to salvation. He said most of the questions are asked on the other side of the rapture of the church. Now friends, I find this such a striking statement because brother was so kind and gracious to anyone who disagreed with him. And he says it won't hurt if you disagree with something he taught on the other side of the rapture. So many message believers are not that gracious today. And that's very sad. But hopefully this video is helpful in identifying majors and minors by the grace of God. Let's listen to the quote from God's prophet. &gt;&gt; And so now these questions are really nice. I appreciate and the wisdom and things that people use. Now for the first one, now I'll try to answer them and then if if I don't get it right, will you you forgive me then? And if you have a different interpretation and believe it your idea of it's right, just go right ahead. that won't hurt because there's not only about one or two of them that pertains anything to salvation. It's only most of the questions is asked on this other side of the trip uh on the rapture of the church. So see it's questions over here which is to come and will come to pass over in the other parts because we're now beyond the church age in our teachings in the book. We're beyond over in a time of the calling of the 144,000. &gt;&gt; So friends, let's do what Jesus said. Let's do the weightier matters of the scripture, judgment, mercy, and faith. And let's do the other as well. Let's not leave the other minors undone. As Jesus said in John 16:13, "The Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth. The truth of the majors, truth of the minors." If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. I'm very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed.
