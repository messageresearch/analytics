[0:01] so I got up about 4:00 and got started
[0:04] driving and Billy was sleeping we went
[0:06] into a place and I was thinking on my

[0:44] of I'll just love it now the Lord tells
[0:46] me go down and tell somebody something
[0:47] I'll run out and tell them and come back
[0:49] again and I'll help Bud and we'll really
[0:51] have a real place
[0:53] here I was thinking on that we went into
[0:56] a restaurant to eat little place in a
[0:58] mountain just about 7 7:00 it was
[1:00] getting a little late so I woke Billy up
[1:04] without a gasoline so had to get some
[1:06] gasoline and went into this little place
[1:08] this little
[1:09] restaurant and while there a man come
[1:12] across the street maybe a teeny bit
[1:14] older than I was but he looked like a
[1:16] man didn't he had on a pair of
[1:19] overhauled overhauled jacket riding
[1:22] boots black hat whiskers down on his
[1:25] face like this snow white his hair
[1:27] hanging out from under his back of his
[1:29] hat oh that look like a man not some
[1:33] soft lazy with a cigar in his mouth
[1:36] about that long set with a pair of
[1:38] shorts on around some patio a swimming
[1:41] pool
[1:43] some pop bellied easterner like excuse
[1:46] that expression but a guy look like a
[1:48] man to me hard rough look like it live
[1:53] words God made man to live I was admire
[1:57] you he come into the restaurant and
[1:58] order some pancakes
[2:00] about 15 20 people he had to sneeze you
[2:04] know how some
[2:08] people but he let out a great big
[2:11] healthy wood
[2:13] sneeze look like the wind is bling when
[2:16] he
[2:18] did nobody dared to say
[2:21] nothing no sir I said Billy there's a
[2:24] man at my own
[2:26] heart said Oh Daddy you don't want to be
[2:29] like that's what that's me in the future
[2:32] I said that's
[2:33] me and I sat there a little bit Billy
[2:36] looked up at me and kept on eating his
[2:38] pancakes and I I was finished fine in a
[2:42] few minutes somebody in a booth right
[2:45] around from us with a board this way a
[2:47] back of the booth I couldn't see around
[2:50] a man got up that looked exactly my
[2:54] profile about 75 years
[2:57] old little bitty fell his clothes tied
[3:00] on him
[3:01] ragged and the bud that got up with him
[3:04] was Fletcher Bry
[3:08] exactly gray hair hanging in his face
[3:12] and Billy looked around he said Daddy
[3:14] that looks like you and
[3:16] fleser you can imagine how I
[3:19] felt and the little fell looked like me
[3:22] wobbled up you been standing over a
[3:26] campfire with smoke all over them faces
[3:29] dirty
[3:31] I think their breakfast together a man
[3:32] must have paid 20
[3:34] cents maybe a cup of coffee or
[3:38] something my heart bounced within
[3:41] me and I watched it Billy said what your
[3:44] Mar you I said
[3:45] nothing I watched that and they went
[3:48] around and went
[3:50] out he said Daddy what some Mar you I
[3:52] said
[3:54] nothing and he got in the car I said he
[3:56] said do you mind driving again I said no
[3:58] he said I'm still sleeping
[4:00] so he went to sleep I went speeding down
[4:03] the road about 55 M an hour in the truck
[4:07] over the mountain coming on towards the
[4:10] the bar down to coming home to Arizona
[4:14] but I was coming down into
[4:15] Utah and as I got there coming down
[4:19] through the mountains about 20 mil out
[4:21] of the
[4:22] city just as it you've heard it as I
[4:25] told you about the morning about the
[4:26] squirrels and all these things have
[4:28] something Somebody went to talking to me
[4:32] a voice just saying as you hear mine I
[4:34] know it sounds neurotically but as I got
[4:37] through expressing have I ever told you
[4:39] anything about what was
[4:41] right and a voice got to talking I was
[4:45] talking to it said carry out your plans
[4:49] and you'll be like
[4:54] that I said Lord I don't want to be like
[4:58] that
[5:00] said your wife will go to she won't live
[5:03] up in them Hills like
[5:05] that and you'll become a
[5:08] bum just as the dream showed you would I
[5:13] said I don't want to be
[5:16] that but the I don't want to have to
[5:21] live like that I I want to do something
[5:24] different but I I was told that that
[5:28] you'd call me to be a a
[5:32] prophet and I want to live in the
[5:34] wilderness like the prophet but I was
[5:37] using my own excuse so I can hunt my own
[5:40] good and he said but that was the
[5:44] prophets of the Old Testament you've
[5:46] been called to be that in a much higher
[5:49] office than thatall he said you have
[5:52] more gifts besides that you was called
[5:55] to pray for the sick and to preach the
[5:57] gospel and uh in the apostolic Farms you
[6:01] know of of greater things many great
[6:03] gifts so why do you wait for me to move
[6:07] you every time you
[6:08] move where is your
[6:12] reward that I see and then said do you
[6:17] remember I told you yes do you remember
[6:20] what brother Roberson told
[6:23] you in your dream in his dream or
[6:27] Vision that you done like
[6:31] Moses you forgot the feeling of your
[6:35] people you forgot the call that I called
[6:38] you
[6:42] to I let the sick lady I want Lord to
[6:45] tell me where to go and not to that's
[6:47] wrong I built myself a
[6:51] complex because the people didn't hear
[6:54] my
[6:54] message and if you God forbid that I try
[6:58] to compare the life of now like Moses
[7:00] that's exactly what Moses
[7:04] did the people wouldn't listen to him
[7:06] when he come to deliver him so he just
[7:08] left him alone and went into the
[7:09] Wilderness but God turned him
[7:14] around and he long forgot the suffering
[7:18] people and then I said Lord if how could
[7:24] I that's right with no education with a
[7:26] grammar school education be able in
[7:29] people standing RS and everywhere to
[7:32] hear the simple
[7:35] gospel it's more it's greater now than
[7:38] it was under the old
[7:41] Covenant he ascended on high and gives
[7:44] gifts unto
[7:46] man Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[7:49] today and forever
[7:51] Hallelujah then I was talking and I
[7:55] heard it talking to me and it left me
[7:57] and I said bill
[8:00] and he was sound asleep I said Billy was
[8:03] that
[8:04] you and he didn't even wake
[8:07] up and I thought Lord God I slow my car
[8:11] down what does this
[8:13] mean and I said Billy Billy said what do
[8:17] you want and I said you talking to me no
[8:22] why I I want to tell you something I
[8:25] Dreamed a Dream not long ago you
[8:26] remember seeing that guy look like me
[8:28] and flesh ask mother when he get back to
[8:30] Tucson I told her this dream that Billy
[8:33] something happened it's going on now
[8:35] something was talking to me and I I
[8:37] thought it was you he looked at me kind
[8:40] strange and wait a little bit we driving
[8:42] on so a few minutes he went back to
[8:46] sleep again and I was driving along
[8:48] thinking about it what could that mean
[8:51] driving along l in the road and all at
[8:54] once you're to come talking
[8:56] again and he said return
[9:00] did not I tell you in the beginning to
[9:02] do the work of an evangelist amen when I
[9:05] called you down the river did not I say
[9:07] that John the Baptist was sent forth to
[9:10] for on the first coming wasn't John more
[9:12] than a
[9:15] prophet Jesus said to himself whyd you
[9:18] go out to see a prophet said more than a
[9:20] prophet amen amen then it all begin to
[9:24] come to me I begin to to Wonder then he
[9:30] reminded me again of the of
[9:35] the people how doing what Moses did how
[9:40] can Moses reach the people in the
[9:43] wilderness how can I reach the people in
[9:45] the wilderness exactly the same thing
[9:48] then it comes this second Timothy 4
[9:50] remember when we dedicated the church
[9:52] that morning 30 years ago some of you
[9:54] Oldtimer when he showed me them trees
[9:56] and I planted them on both sides you
[9:58] remember that you remember the Visions
[10:00] all wrote in books and on tapes and
[10:01] everything the years ago how I've seen
[10:04] these and I I never crossed up the
[10:06] Oneness in the Trinity I stood between
[10:08] them and planted these trees and they
[10:11] were the only two trees that had
[10:14] pruit and now all the trees grew up
[10:17] about 30 ft and stop things went PL into
[10:19] heaven broke off of the same Branch see
[10:23] one on one side one on the other and I
[10:25] broke them you remember the vision wrot
[10:27] books since in my life story know and
[10:30] they went put up into heaven like that
[10:31] quickly and he said hold out your hands
[10:34] for the fruit and then I found the same
[10:36] fruit in the cross want to run down
[10:37] there and he said do the work of an
[10:39] evangelist make fullprof your ministry
[10:42] the time will come when they not endure
[10:43] sound doctor don't quit them and keep
[10:46] going that all come into my mind and
[10:50] then
