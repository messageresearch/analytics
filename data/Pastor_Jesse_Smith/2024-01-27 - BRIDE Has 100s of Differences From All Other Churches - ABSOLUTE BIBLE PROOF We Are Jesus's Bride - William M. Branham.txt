TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] let the Holy Spirit search her Minds with the words you'll agree with the message that's just one or two things that mention when there's hundreds of them greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show Bible proof that followers of the bible-based revelations that God gave to brother brandham are the Bride of Jesus Christ and I say this is humbly I believe we have absolute Bible proof that we are the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ by the grace of God and of course by the scripture my name is Jesse Smith I'm pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio for the past 17 years and I defend the Bible revelations that God revealed to his Prophet his genuine Prophet brother William brandham 1909 to 1965 and I also defend William branham's Godly Christian genuine character the inspiration for this video came about 3 years ago when I finished writing my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed Rapture wisdom for Christ's bride in chapter 4 specifically I show The Mystery of the Holy Ghost filled church as the Bride of Jesus Christ and since then I've had this thought numerous times that that chapter helps prove by the Bible that there is a genuine group who is the Bride of Jesus Christ they are the Holy Ghost filled Christian believers who who follow the Bible revelations that Jesus revealed to his Prophet brother brandham this video kind of ties in with the previous videos I did on why I am a message believer Parts 1 and two and also ties in with a recent sermon I preached on Christmas Eve 20123 room for Jesus before I preached that Christmas text I share this thought about the hundreds of differences between the Bride of Jesus Christ and all the other Christian churches I was reminded of this thought this idea of absolute proof we are the Bride of Jesus Christ when I listen to The Invisible Union of the Bride a sermon brother branam preached in November 1965 in this sermon from brother brandham he was giving a hypothetical situation where someone would say that message you're preaching brother brandom is wrong and brother randam then says look at yourself so the criticizers of brother brandham the critics of me and other faithful message Preachers by the grace of God he said look at yourself let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the word of God and you agree with the message so the critics of brother brandham and the critics of true message Believers would agree with the message if they actually looked at their Bible with an honest heart brother Bram said let the spirit get into you see if that's right or not and brother Bram was talking about was water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right or not and you reference acts 238 well any accuser or critic of brother brandham if they just open up their Bible they would know that that is the correct water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because all five examples of baptism from the book of Acts include either Lord Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ and Colossians 3:17 says we should do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so the revelation of the Bible is that there's only one name to be baptized there's one name to the father son Holy Ghost that's the Lord Jesus Christ and then brother Ram said that's just one of the things he mentioned when there's hundreds of them in other words there's hundreds of true doctrines that are right in the message and then that means there's hundreds of false doctrines in all other churches and that's the truth that's what I emphasize in chapter 4 of my 2021 book then brother Ram just gives a few more examples does the bible agree with women bobbing their hair no does the bible agree with three baptisms in the title father son Holy Ghost no does the bible agree with women wearing men's clothing no no brother Braham said well just take them three there when there's hundreds of them search it out in the light of God's word and that's what brother Ram's accusers will not do they will not be honest and search out the scriptures with an open heart and agree with the Bible revelations the true Bible revelations that brother Randon was teaching the people so I'll play the short version of this quote and then at the end of the video I'll play the full version of this quote let's listen to the quote in Arizona and everyone you're at look at yourself for a few minutes you say that message you're preaching brother brandom is wrong look at yourself a little bit let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the words you'll agree with the message let Christ the anointed word search out your own conscience let him get into you see if that's right or not that's just one or two things that mention when there's hundreds of them does a Bible agree with the woman bobbing her hair no does the bible believe agree with three baptisms in the name of father son Holy Ghost no such a thing does the bible agree with woman wearing man's clothing I just take them three there one these hundreds or more search it out in the light of God's word also here at the beginning I do want to say that each false Doctrine is leaven or sin it's an evil spirit in the church Paul even calls one false Doctrine a canker or a flesh eating disease and so all the churches outside the message that break some of these Bible commands these Bible teachings have a cankerous disease or they have leaven in their Church sin in their church and so of course they cannot be the Bride of Jesus Christ the more leaven or the more false doctrines the worse spiritually the church is also love how brother R said the Antichrist refuses the true bride Doctrine so notice the bride ofes Jesus Christ has true Bible Doctrine brother Ram said the Antichrist opposes the spiritual bride the word so notice the spiritual bride is in the word all the way as brother Ram said in other places the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes you in the word all the way let's listen to those quotes the Antichrist refuses the true bride Doctrine and therefore he takes his own bride now and builds her up under a Creed of his own takes his own bride and makes her a denomination she gives birth to other denominations as quoted in this Holy Scripture gives birth to daughters and um she don't she becomes just like her mother natural worldly denomination opposing the spiritual bride the word make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right there and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the Book of Life 2 John 1: 8 and9 back this up verse 9 especially says whoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and the son as some of my videos have showed in the past it's sad when message preachers say we don't need doctrine or doctrines not to be emphasized the Bible actually says the opposite the Bible says if you have the true Doctrine or as brother ramam said true bride Doctrine from the Bible you have both the Father the invisible spirit and the son Jesus Christ the body of God the high priest in other words you have a true relationship with God Almighty if you have the true Doctrine that's why the Bible says God gives double honor to those men who labor in Doctrine remember also brother Braham said balum and Moses had the same anointing both could prophesy correctly the difference was Moses's teaching or Moses's Doctrine so that's what separated the two anointed ones in Moses day that's what will separate the two anointed ones in this day the true bride of Christ will have the true anointing of God Supernatural signs Miracles and wonders and also true teaching or true Doctrine here's the outline for the video first we'll look at the portion from my 2021 book from chapter 4 proof that we are the bride remember friends no accuser of brother Brenham has read my 2021 book to try to refute it they say because it's false so why should they spend their time on it why could say the same about their nonsense and their lies and their slander and their propaganda but yet I still listen to it in order to debunk it and to defend the true Gospel of Jesus Christ that he revealed to his Prophet brother brandham and to defend brother bram's Christian character second then I'll give a list of over 100 Bible and Pauline doctrines brother brandham restored to the true bride of Christ third I'll close and then fourth I'll play the full length of the quote from the invisible Union let's begin with the proof we are the bride from chapter 4 of the 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed the entire fourth chapter would be a benefit to listen to and study by the grace of God as I go through all the scriptures in the Bible that speak of Jesus having a bride and then showing how the gospel blueprint cannot be changed as Paul taught in Galatians 1 6-12 and then here's where we show the proof that the bride has all of Paul's Doctrine like brother ROM restored to us beginning on page 185 I go over the bride submissive character to every word of Christ so if we take Ephesians 5:22 through 33 Paul shows how a natural bride should respect her husband and of course if we take the spiritual application of this the true bride of Jesus Christ will respect Jesus Christ her husband in the same manner so the first attribute is that the the true bride of Christ only has one headship that's from Ephesians 5:23 and so the message churches who are born again have only one headship that's Jesus Christ the word the bride's only headship is the revelation of the Holy Bible and this is our absolute brother brandham is not our absolute brother Bram said the Bible is our absolute the other churches and their false doctrines prove they are not the bride because they love homosexual relationships they support adulterous relationships fornication relationships destroying babies through birth control pills they allow women preachers they allow substance abuse they allow sinful viewing of movies and television shows they allow shameful hair lengths they allow false conversions teaching only one work of Grace and they allow immodest clothing all those false doctrines break Paul's gospel and remember Paul said if you change one word of it those were 10 words of it those were 10 commands of it if you break one of it you're curs cursed and so these people in churches outside the message they're either temporarily or permanently cursed because of their Disobedience and breaking of the real word of God now if they're ignorant God will have mercy on them and then if they want to know the truth God will guide them into all truth like he did with me he guided me out of a Baptist Church he guided me out of the Pentecostal church I was raised in because I was hungering and thirsting for True righteousness and God is not a respector person so God will guide any person who's hungry and thirsty for righteousness into the true word of God for their day the second attribute for the bride is complete submission in everything according to Ephesians 5:24 so not only is Christ our head but then we submit to all the scripture all the New Testament scripture that Jesus revealed to brother Brenham that we should obey and of course all brother brenham's major doctrines are what Paul preached the third attribute is submission to Christ's washing process as Ephesians 5:26 says says the bride of Christ today is washed By the Waters of the word service after service day after day the fourth attribute is being glued to or joined to Christ according to Ephesians 5:31 a man would be joined to his wife so we must be joined or glued to Christ and so that's why we stay close to the word of God that's why we also stay close to the family of God we gather more as we see that day approaching the fifth and final attribute is the attitude of reverence Ephesians 5:33 a lot of people that have left the message or disbelieve the message have no respect for brother brandham or the true genuine Christians inside the movement of the message they claim to have reverence for the Bible but they really don't because they break all these commands we'll get to them in just a little bit by God's grace of course I already explained 10 of them and it's also seen in the way they dress when they go to church or even if they do attend church regularly or not there's no reverence for God then many of them even drink coffee during the service and eat during the service that's a lot of irreverence and then in chapter 4 I go through judging Christian groups and denominations by their fruits Jesus told us to judge righteous judgment in John 7:24 of course I don't judge anyone's Eternal destination I judge their current fruits based upon their Creeds their We Believe statements and their works of course as Jesus said in the chapter I listed the sizes of Christian groups Roman Catholic being the largest with 1.3 billion Protestant with 900 milli million Eastern Orthodox with 270 million Anglican with 110 million Oriental Orthodox with 62 million and all others 37 million and none of these groups keep all those 10 commandments those 10 Pauling Commandments I listed earlier none of them except the message group that's in the all others category and I'm talking about the message believers who are actually born again I know there are some message churches that are in sin those are awful churches I would not advise anyone to go to those churches if they're full of Leaven or full of sin and then I listed five more New Testament commands all those churches break water baptism full immersion and water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ receiving the baptism of holy ghost in the soul the third work of Grace God is one person not three persons separate garments for men and women and then the supernatural power of all nine gifts of the Holy Ghost operating next in the chapter I go through more details of how the Roman Catholic Church cannot be the bride I list the specific false doctrines they hold and I go down that same list starting with the biggest groups all the way down next under the Protestants I show how Baptists are the largest Protestant groups and how they cannot be the bride Lutheran are the next they cannot be the bride 7th Day Adventist cannot be the bride Pentecostals cannot be the bride Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons cannot be the bride because of all the Bible commands that they break then I show how Eastern Orthodoxy cannot be the bride nor anglicans nor Oriental Orthodox not for one moment do I say there are no saved Believers in the groups because God has children in every organization anyone trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ is saved but if they hold some of these false doctrines what they do is deny the second work of Grace sanctification and then I show in the book who is the bride and where is she located the bride is the Holy Ghost filled church that follows the true Bible revelations of God's end time Prophet William brandham and she's located all around the world wherever Believers are gathered in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now for the next section let's look at a list of over 100 Bible doctrines or Pauline doctrines brother brandham restored to us from St Paul now remember friends there could be hundreds of them as brother brandham said I only spent an hour or two working on this list of 110 false doctrines of other churches and I know cuz I have a Roman Catholic cism book it's at least 500 pages I know if I went through there and listed all the false doctrines there would be hundreds in there and then think if I went through the Mormon beliefs all the Mormon beliefs all the Jehovah's Witnesses false doctrines Pentecostals Lutheran brother brandom's statement would be proven true there are hundreds of differences between the true bride of Jes Jesus Christ who keeps all of Paul's gospel compared to all the other churches who break Paul's gospel and remember Paul said you'll be judged by his gospel in Romans 2:16 so we want to be judged now we want to be chasen now as Hebrews 12 says as Sons and Daughters of God because Jesus chastens all those he loves as he also said in Revelation 3 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen I want Jesus's rebukes and chastening now because that's one way he shows me as love of course he shows me love in so many other ways but correction is just one form of love so let's begin the first six true doctrines that we should preach but most churches reject are found in Hebrews 61 and2 number one repentance from dead works most churches do not teach for believers to repent from their dead Works they let them keep sinning number two Faith toward God most churches have faith in Creeds and denominations then there's four types of baptism isms or immersion versus sprinkling Soul baptism the human Spirit baptism and the baptism of fiery trials a lot of churches don't teach all four baptisms two more doctrines of the laying on of hands for ordaining and praying for the sick resurrection of the Dead there's actually two future resurrections not just one and eternal judgment hell is not Eternal but the Judgment that God gives upon a soul does last last eternally the final sentence whether saved or lost so that's the first 10 here's numbers 11 through3 and these deal with the prophetic aspect there's a false Doctrine no more prophets after Jesus of course there are there's a false Doctrine no message of the hour of course there is there is a teaching there seven angels of Revelation 3 or seven literal men there's a teaching seven letters are prophetic to the seven Church ages each of the Seven Seals is a revelation from Jesus Christ to brother brandom so there's seven right there there's six verses that prophesy brother Ram's restoration Ministry acts 32021 Matthew 17711 Malachi 45 and6 Luke 1730 Revelation 10 1:7 and Amos 37 and all the other churches teach these verses incorrectly the seven Thunders are the revelations of the Seven Seals Revelation 13 1-10 is Pagan Rome transitioning into Papa Rome the Revelation 13 11-8 is United States in Prophecy numbers 31 to 50 include five about salvation and Holy Ghost baptism for example the three works of Grace water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tongues are not the evidence of the Holy Ghost baptism water baptism does not save and we're saved by grace through faith in Jesus blood we're not saved by works some Churches like the Catholic Church teach salvation through works there's eight doctrines about modesty men's hair is one women's hair is another makeup is forbidden high heels are forbidden tattoos are forbidden separate garments for men and women thighs are nakedness so no men or women shorts or miniskirts and we must abstain from expensive hair and jewelry then we get into the Mysteries serpent seed is original sin the mystery of iniquity the Rapture is pre-tribulation Mystery Babylon is the Roman Catholic Church the entire mystery of the godhead God is one person Israel's blindness during the church age there's one Church composed of Jew and Gentile Believers and the New Testament Church is the Bride of Jesus Christ which this video is All About Numbers 51 to 70 there's three more Mysteries godliness restored to man which is the stature of a perfect man the Kingdom of Heaven Parables remember there's 16 of those that's in chapter 8 of my book and God's will God has a perfect will and a permissive will there's 13 about Holiness and Doctrine homosexuality is abomination no such thing as women Angels no women preachers marriage and divorce until death one man and one woman every Christian should have a home church every Christian should pay tithes and offerings regarding the Ten Commandments God continues the moral law if God desires in the New Testament predestination and for knowledge Eagles represent prophets and Believers the difference between the two seventh angels in the Book of Revelation marriage requirements for New Testament ministers or in the fivefold ministry and how preachers are not required to marry virgins three parts to man's being Body Spirit and soul gender is stable communion is symbolic feet washing is literal mzc was God in flesh and not just a human priest who lived and died the pope is the Antichrist number 71 through 90 Daniel 70 weeks the true Revelation on that the mark of the beast is spiritual making people reprobates the Bible says the future mark of the beast during the tribulation period Paradise in Abraham's bosom anointed ones at the end times or the rainfalls in the just and the unjust the king James version is the only acceptable version of the Bible the Book of Life versus the Lamb's Book of Life section God's eight covenants crucifying Christ aresh three locations after death denominations have a name they live but are dead the four beasts are anointings from Revelation 4 the five comings of the spirit of Elijah the five aspects of the human spirit conscience memory reason affection imagination true forgiveness for others which is essential for salvation the former and latter Reign four classes of Believers the gifts of the Holy Ghost all nine are in operation today Grace can be failed or rejected the Bible says and names can be blotted off The Book of Life numbers 91 through 100 are the spirit of Jezebel that's the fourth stage of iniquity Jesus has the keys of death Jesus leading captivity captive the L of the Pharisees are equivalent to today's false teachings the three areas of Temptation lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life brother R's Ministry was the last sign to the Gentiles before the Rapture fasting almsgiving prayer and the second death is complete Annihilation so the true teaching on the second death I thought I gave 10 extra doctrines just to show how brother BR was right when he said there was hundreds I just gave you a list of 100 so here's 10 more every believer should have a pastor Mormons add an entire book to the Bible social drinking is acceptable and I know that because I've talking to numerous friends of mine who are Lutheran who believe that but of course that's wrong the future homes Revelation about the three works of Grace which Clarence Larin did not teach and then the four kingdoms from Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Daniel chapter 2 which were the times of the Gentiles and brother brandham correctly identified the third and fourth kingdoms the Bible identifies the first and second kingdoms here's five false doctrines related to jeffersonville's false movement of the tape Church movement the tape boys replace living preachers that's a lie of course tapes are the absolute that's a lie tapes are the token that's a lie being a part of a tape church is the evidence of the token that's a lie and they say every word on tape is thus say the Lord that's a lie so there friends is 110 true teachings that brother random restored from Paul's gospel the fact true Holy Ghost filled message Believers keep all 110 of these teachings proves they are the Bride of Jesus Christ because the Bride of Jesus Christ is submissive to Christ in all things in all things he wrote In His holy word they keep all of Paul's gospel that's why the multitude screamed out we're resting on the fact that brother Brandon preached what Paul preached that's the truth and we're thankful for that by the grace of God and we say this in humility but also with joy in our hearts joy that we've received the message of the hour the Bible restored in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing it's been on my heart for a long time and we rejoice in the word of our day the message of our hour so if you're a follower of this end time message feel thankful know that God has restored Paul's gospel To Us by his grace let's do like the bans did let's search the Scriptures Daily let's listen to brother Ram daily proving the majority of his teachings especially his major doctrines we're in total agreement with Paul's gospel let us not add to Paul's gospel nor take anything away from Paul's gospel by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ let's pray though for brother bram's accusers and anyone else who may be watching this that doesn't know about the message that they'll hunger and thirst for the righteousness in the Bible father God I thank you for today Lord God I just pray this video will be used to help people know that there's absolute Bible proof that we can be the Bride of Jesus Christ he that hath the bride is the bridegroom Lord we're going to a marriage supper the lamb in heaven a marriage between Christ and the church Lord help us to be submissive to every word of God I pray for new people that have never heard this before that they would hunger and thirst for the word of God Paul's gospel and become a message believer a genuine Holy Ghost filled Christian I pray for brother Ram's accusers that they'll repent of their slander their lies their false accusations their presumptions and they will do like brother Ram said go search the scriptures and then they'll know the message is right I pray for some of them to repent all those who are ordained eternal life will repent they'll recognize brother Brenham as a genuine servant of God and all the other Holy Ghost filled preachers and they'll have love rather than hate for brother brandham for this message for message Believers I ask that you grant it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart first John 2:15 he says if you love the world things of the world the love of God's not even in you so how can you be pregnated with the word of God which condemns the world condemns Hollywood condemns all of its Fashions condemns all these parties and carrying on and soall that they have in the name of religion it condemns it how can the word pregnate a person how can a bob haired woman painted face wearing shorts hallelujah hallelujah how can a preacher goes out here to a seminary and looks at acts 238 amen and seem that there's not a person in the Bible ever baptized in those titles Hallelujah and then still say he's pregnated with the word of God he's telling you a lie he sold his birthrights he's committed adultery against the very thing that he said he's put away in divorce God's going to have a virtuous church [Applause] just Bible said the word's not in you so what kind of a children are you you're bearing pregnated denominational there has been no death to

cats beetles that's Church memb sure they sons of King which is the sons of the subtle Beast just as smooth as they can be now take a good look for a moment with with your own spiritual Insight at your soul just look around I'm speaking Across the Nation now look just if you met you out there in a Brandon Tabernacle you and the Tabernacles on the west coast in Arizona and everywhere you're at look at yourself for a few minutes you say that message you're preaching brother random is wrong look at yourself a little bit let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the words you'll agree with the message let Christ the anointed word search out your own conscience let him get into you see if that's right or not that's just one or two things that mention when there's hundreds of them does a Bible agree with a woman bobbing her hair does the bible believe agree with three baptisms in the name of father son Holy Ghost no such a thing does a Bible agree with woman wearing man's clothing I'll just take them three there well there's hundreds of more yes search it out in the light of God's word he say I'm a church member so is Cain so was Eve the Bible predicts in the last days that the

was among them and he was a dissol of doubts you let the Holy Spirit he is the prophet of the day let him come into your heart right now and examine with the word of God and the doubts about the
