[0:03] what now you say how could he be God and
[0:04] be man see that is the mystery see in
[0:08] body he was man in spirit he was
[0:12] [Applause]
[0:14] God greetings friends in the matchless
[0:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:19] purpose of this video is to answer six
[0:21] questions about the godhead the first
[0:24] being did Jesus pray to himself so
[0:27] recently I received numerous emails and
[0:30] also comments on YouTube asking
[0:32] questions about the godhead and these
[0:33] are excellent questions I've even been
[0:36] asked questions about the godhead at a
[0:39] message church I visited numerous times
[0:41] over the summer preaching to the Saints
[0:43] trying to encourage the Saints helping
[0:44] out a new church that's recently com to
[0:48] the message and they had great questions
[0:49] about the godhead remember of course the
[0:52] Bible calls the godhead a mystery in
[0:54] Colossians
[0:55] 2:2 the Bible said to the
[0:57] acknowledgement of the mystery of God
[0:59] and of the father and of Christ it's
[1:01] notable that Paul did not mention the
[1:03] Holy Ghost notice he just said God and
[1:06] of the father and of Christ I think
[1:09] that's a very fitting statement by the
[1:10] Apostle Paul because there is no mystery
[1:13] regarding the godhead about the father
[1:16] and the Holy Ghost they are not two
[1:18] separate persons the father is the Holy
[1:21] Ghost the father is the Holy Spirit and
[1:24] I know there are other three-fold
[1:25] references in the scripture about father
[1:27] Son and Holy Ghost but I just think it's
[1:29] it's very fitting that St Paul the one
[1:32] that Jesus commissioned to write about
[1:34] the godhead being a mystery points out
[1:36] the main mystery being between the
[1:38] father and the son of course I believe
[1:41] there's one person in the godhead as all
[1:43] my videos and my two books discuss I
[1:46] believe it's tritheism or polytheism to
[1:49] call God three persons I believe
[1:52] trinitarianism is heresy and of course
[1:55] we'll get into that in this video as
[1:56] well by God's grace but we recognize the
[1:59] godhead is is mysterious no doubt about
[2:01] that as Paul said we must acknowledge
[2:04] this mystery before getting into the six
[2:06] questions I just want to review eight
[2:09] principles about the godhead I wrote
[2:11] about in my 2021 book it's on pages
[2:15] 23-32 the eight principles are the
[2:18] Trinity Dogma adds to the Bible so we
[2:21] must learn to never add to the Bible we
[2:23] must use Bible words about the godhead
[2:26] second Jesus and his Apostles affirmed
[2:29] pure mind monotheism not tritheism so
[2:32] the authors of the Bible never use the
[2:34] word Trinity two persons three persons
[2:37] second person nor third person so we
[2:40] must not use it Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 say
[2:44] if we add to the Bible plagues will be
[2:45] added to us and God will call us a liar
[2:48] on the day of judgment third the athian
[2:52] Creed contains many contradictions so
[2:54] that again that's why we don't focus on
[2:55] Creeds our Creed is the entire
[2:58] Bible fourth trinitarians have major
[3:01] Bible contradictions and
[3:04] inconsistencies fifth the Trinity
[3:06] leaders did not affirm that the Holy
[3:08] Spirit was divine until 381 ad yet Old
[3:12] Testament Jews and New Testament
[3:14] Believers all knew the Holy Ghost was
[3:16] divine because the father is the Holy
[3:18] Ghost sixth Trinity artwork is deceptive
[3:22] and unbiblical seventh trinitarians use
[3:25] fear tactics to persuade people to
[3:27] accept the Trinity such as the fear
[3:30] tactic of being called a heretic and the
[3:32] fear tactic of saying you'll go to hell
[3:35] if you don't believe in three persons
[3:36] but of course the Bible never teaches
[3:38] three
[3:39] persons and eighth and finally God sent
[3:42] his Prophet brother William brandham to
[3:44] warn of the false Trinity Doctrine in
[3:47] 1961 brother R said thus sayi the Lord
[3:50] trinitarianism is of the devil but he
[3:52] said trinitarians can be saved because
[3:54] the godhead is not a Salvation issue
[3:57] it's a doctrinal
[3:58] issue now my precious brother I know
[4:02] this is a tape also now don't get
[4:04] excited let me say this with Godly
[4:08] love the hours approach where I can't
[4:11] hold still on these things no more too
[4:13] close to the coming
[4:16] see trinitarianism is of the
[4:19] devil I say that thus sayith the Lord
[4:24] amen look where it come
[4:27] from it come from the N seeing
[4:31] Council when the Catholic Church become
[4:33] in
[4:34] rulership the word Trinity is not even
[4:37] mentioned in the entire book of the
[4:41] Bible and as far as three Gods that's
[4:44] from Hell there's one
[4:48] God it's exactly right now do you say
[4:52] then you believe it all these people
[4:54] that as trinitarians are of hell no sir
[4:57] I believe they are Christians
[5:00] but the hour is approaching brother
[5:02] where they are sincerely
[5:07] wrong so now getting to question number
[5:09] one did Jesus pray to himself the kind
[5:12] person who asked me this question said
[5:15] was he talking to himself so my reply is
[5:18] no Jesus's body did not pray to itself
[5:22] his body prayed to the holy spirit that
[5:24] created his body and that Holy Spirit
[5:27] was and is his father the heaven father
[5:30] so Jesus prayed to the spirit of God
[5:33] that was in him but also that Spirit was
[5:36] also in heaven because God can be in as
[5:38] many places as he wants to be so Jesus
[5:42] praying to the father was not one person
[5:45] praying to another person that would be
[5:48] polytheism or tritheism the Bible says
[5:52] Jesus was and is a manifestation of God
[5:55] so we must use Bible words manifestation
[5:58] means an appearing so Jesus was an
[6:00] appearing of God according to 1 Timothy
[6:03] 3:16 also Hebrews 1:3 says Jesus is the
[6:07] exact representation of God's character
[6:10] the King James calls it the express
[6:12] image Jesus is the exact character of
[6:14] the father but in a human being because
[6:17] the father cannot change from a spirit
[6:19] and no longer be a spirit and just be a
[6:22] human the father will forever and
[6:24] eternally be in spirit form so Jesus was
[6:28] and is the word made flesh according to
[6:30] John
[6:32] 1:14 Jesus is the image of the invisible
[6:35] God as Colossians 1:15 says who is the
[6:38] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[6:40] of every creature so regarding all the
[6:43] questions about the father and the son
[6:45] we must understand and emphasize the
[6:47] humanity of Jesus is different than the
[6:50] deity of Jesus Jesus was fully human his
[6:54] Humanity but also fully God his
[6:57] deity no other being ever has or ever
[7:01] will be just like Jesus in this aspect
[7:04] his dual nature of humanity and deity is
[7:10] completely unique there never was there
[7:13] not is and there never will be another
[7:15] being like Jesus he is a one-of-a-kind
[7:18] manifestation of God remember 1 Timothy
[7:22] 6:16 says God himself cannot be seen nor
[7:26] ever will be seen the Bible said whom no
[7:28] man hath seen so no man has ever seen
[7:31] the invisible spirit of God the
[7:33] invisible father nor can any man ever
[7:36] see the invisible Spirit or the
[7:37] invisible father so men and even angels
[7:40] only see the manifestations of the
[7:42] invisible father and so I went on to
[7:45] tell this person and explain the
[7:47] difference between Jesus's humanity and
[7:49] Jesus's deity God in his Spirit form
[7:52] could never die the deity could never
[7:54] die so God had to create a body to die
[7:57] and that was Jesus and Jesus had the the
[7:59] character of God because he was the word
[8:01] made flesh so Jesus had to pray because
[8:04] he was fully man he had to be fully man
[8:07] so he could suffer Temptation since the
[8:10] father cannot be tempted the Bible says
[8:12] in James
[8:13] 1:13 God cannot be tempted with evil yet
[8:17] in Jesus's Soul he had the full
[8:19] authority of God or the fullness of the
[8:22] godhead as the Bible says the fullness
[8:24] of the godhead dwelt in Jesus bodily
[8:27] think of this all other manifest of God
[8:30] did not need to pray because they were
[8:32] not human manifestations such as the
[8:34] pillar of fire The Rock in the
[8:35] wilderness the spirit descending like a
[8:37] dove and so forth Jesus's human body is
[8:41] the one and only human manifestation of
[8:43] God so he had to pray to draw on the
[8:46] strength of his father the holy spirit
[8:49] this is what brother Ram taught in
[8:50] calling Jesus on the scene in
[8:52] 1963 and then brother Brennon brings out
[8:54] this powerful mindboggling scripture
[8:57] where Jesus said in John 3 13 even the
[9:01] son of man which is in heaven so Jesus
[9:03] is standing on the earth saying the son
[9:05] of man is in heaven so of course he's
[9:07] speaking about the eternal spirit of God
[9:10] the invisible spirit of God that is both
[9:12] inside of his bodily Temple but also in
[9:15] heaven on the throne let's listen to the
[9:18] quote from brother
[9:19] brandham now Jesus being man physically
[9:25] was tired
[9:28] weary
[9:29] now laying there tired virtue had gone
[9:32] from him and then him being God he could
[9:37] only do what now you say how could he be
[9:39] God and be man see there is the mystery
[9:42] see in body he was man in spirit he was
[9:48] God someone asked he said then how who
[9:51] did he pray to in the Gard of Gethsemane
[9:54] I said I'll answer you that why not you
[9:57] answer this do you believe you have the
[9:58] Holy Ghost yes s then who do you pray
[10:01] to where's he at when you're praying to
[10:04] him when you claim you have him and
[10:05] that's you're praying to
[10:08] him people just they just get some
[10:10] little idea and run wild with it you see
[10:13] that's the way it goes now in spirit he
[10:16] was
[10:17] God Jesus said in St John 3 see when the
[10:23] son of man which now is in heaven that's
[10:26] standing here on
[10:28] Earth
[10:30] when the son of man which now is in
[10:33] heaven how would you answer
[10:35] that see he said he was in heaven then
[10:39] and here he was standing on
[10:41] earth oh my you see that he had to be
[10:46] God ominent
[10:48] present sure he's present everywhere he
[10:51] knows every thought by being omin
[10:53] Mission knowing all things he be omin
[10:55] pres see the second question was did
[10:58] Jesus Jesus rais himself
[11:01] up the answer is the spirit of Jesus
[11:05] inside of his body raised up his body
[11:08] but the body of Jesus did not raise
[11:10] itself up since Jesus said his body
[11:12] could do nothing Jesus said this in John
[11:15] 5:30 I can of my own self do
[11:18] nothing so of course there's other
[11:20] scriptures that emphasize this such as
[11:22] John 1428 Jesus said the father is
[11:25] greater than I and in John 14:10 Jesus
[11:28] said the father father does the
[11:30] works so again the spirit of God which
[11:33] is the spirit of Jesus the Eternal
[11:36] invisible spirit of God raised up the
[11:38] human body of
[11:40] Jesus the self-existing Holy Spirit
[11:43] raised up the body of Jesus it created
[11:46] to die for our
[11:48] sins then when you look at John 2: 19
[11:51] Jesus said destroy this Temple and in
[11:53] three days I will raise it up so this
[11:55] verse means the father was speaking
[11:57] through the son
[11:59] the father was speaking through the body
[12:01] of Jesus and the father was saying I
[12:04] will raise up this body I've created
[12:07] Jesus's body could not raise itself up
[12:09] because Jesus said he can do nothing of
[12:12] his own self so the Flesh of Jesus did
[12:15] not raise itself up the spirit of Jesus
[12:19] the holy spirit inside of Jesus body
[12:22] raised up the body from the grave this
[12:25] is what brother Adam taught in it is the
[12:27] rising of the sun 196 5 brother R said
[12:30] Jesus was so full of the quickening
[12:32] power that he said I'll raise it up in 3
[12:36] days brother brandham said why did he
[12:38] say that he knew it was written of him
[12:40] by the word of God and the word of God
[12:42] could not fail so again brother brandham
[12:44] shows how the quickening power raised up
[12:46] the body Jesus said of my own self I can
[12:49] do nothing so his flesh body had no
[12:51] power the quickening power that was in
[12:54] Jesus was the power source that raised
[12:56] up his body let's listen to the quote
[12:59] our lord Jesus is so full of quickening
[13:01] power he was all of it together he was
[13:04] so full of quickening power he said this
[13:07] you destroy this body and I'll raise it
[13:09] up in three days talk about confidence
[13:12] and quick
[13:13] power destroy this body and I'll this
[13:16] Temple and I'll bring it up in three
[13:18] days why why did he say that he knew
[13:20] that it was written of him see it is
[13:24] written in by the word of God which
[13:26] could not fail the words said I will not
[13:30] suffer my Holy One to see corruption
[13:33] neither will I leave his soul in hell
[13:36] and he know that quick power would raise
[13:38] him up that there wouldn't be one cell
[13:40] corrupt he said you destroy this Temple
[13:43] I'll bring it back again in three days
[13:45] why it was
[13:47] prophecy the word of God and prophecy if
[13:51] it's true word of God cannot fail and
[13:54] the same prophecy and word of God that
[13:57] said it raise him up
[13:59] said that we're already raised with
[14:03] him don't wor said fear
[14:06] not and it is written that the spirit
[14:10] that is now was in him now in us also
[14:14] quickens our moral B Fe not friends the
[14:18] s o n is up the Sun is up no the third
[14:22] question is pretty simple but it said
[14:24] what is the holy spirit or Holy Ghost my
[14:27] answer was the Holy Spirit
[14:29] is the Eternal Immortal invisible spirit
[14:31] of God and yet this invisible spirit
[14:35] makes himself visible in manifestations
[14:37] like the pillar of fire rock in the
[14:39] wilderness burning bush Spirit
[14:41] descending like a dove voice in a
[14:43] whirlwind and so forth the word spirit
[14:46] is the same thing as the word ghost
[14:48] they're synonyms the two words can be
[14:51] used interchangeably so God is a holy
[14:54] spirit God is the Holy Ghost and we use
[14:57] those phrases inter changeably brother
[15:00] Bram said some people are sadly afraid
[15:02] to use the term Holy Ghost but we're
[15:03] free to use that the King James Bible
[15:06] uses that some people are afraid of the
[15:07] word ghost but we're not afraid of that
[15:09] it just means Spirit we desire every
[15:12] child of God to be filled with the Holy
[15:15] Ghost fourth the question was if God was
[15:18] fully in Jesus how did he speak during
[15:20] his baptism in the form of a dove and
[15:23] also at the Mount of Olives during the
[15:25] Transfiguration great question I said
[15:28] the answer was God's voice could speak
[15:30] at jesus' baptism because God cannot be
[15:33] limited God can dwell in each one of us
[15:36] as the Bible says the spirit of God is
[15:38] in each believer and yet he can still
[15:40] speak from Heaven this is not a hard
[15:43] thing for God to do because he's
[15:45] infinitely powerful there is no limit to
[15:47] God's power we also refer to this as
[15:50] God's omnipresence which means he can be
[15:53] present Everywhere by his for knowledge
[15:55] and he can also be present wherever he
[15:57] wants to be because he has No Limits a
[16:00] simple example of this is the day of
[16:01] Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 God divided
[16:04] himself into 120 licks of fire on the
[16:07] day of Pentecost each little lick of
[16:09] fire was a manifestation of him he could
[16:12] have done way more licks of fire because
[16:14] he cannot be limited he's infinitely
[16:17] powerful and each person that had the
[16:19] lick of fire had the spiritual fire of
[16:22] the Holy Ghost burning in their souls
[16:23] now they were born again and then God
[16:26] was speaking in tongues through each one
[16:28] of those 120 Believers declaring the
[16:31] wonderful works of God the Bible said
[16:33] they were speaking in unknown tongues
[16:35] but all the hearers were Hearing in
[16:36] their own languages think of that the
[16:38] spirit of God speaking through 120
[16:40] people and peoples from 17 different
[16:43] nations heard those tongues in their own
[16:46] languages so seeing how God could speak
[16:48] through 120 people at the same time
[16:50] helps us to understand how God could
[16:52] speak from heaven and also through Jesus
[16:54] at Jesus baptism nothing is too hard for
[16:57] the Lord
[16:59] the fifth question is about Matthew
[17:03] 24:36 how can the son not know but the
[17:07] father does
[17:08] know and this question also had a few
[17:11] other questions did Jesus mean that
[17:14] generation in Matthew 24:34 and if so
[17:17] what things came to
[17:20] pass my answer was the son could not
[17:23] know the day and hour because the sun
[17:25] was fully human this meant the son had
[17:27] human limit ation Jesus's body had human
[17:30] limitations it could be tempted it could
[17:33] die it didn't know everything but yet it
[17:36] had a holy word nature and never sinned
[17:40] but God the father is eternal Immortal
[17:42] he's an infinite spirit and has no
[17:45] limitations remember Jesus said the
[17:47] father was greater than him in John
[17:49] 14:28 so Jesus's Humanity was fully
[17:53] human it was limited and that's why the
[17:56] father could know things the son did not
[17:58] know the father is unlimited the son's
[18:02] body the human body of Jesus was limited
[18:05] going on to the next part of the
[18:06] question regarding Matthew
[18:08] 24:34 it seems in context according to
[18:11] verses
[18:12] 31-33 that Jesus is referring to the
[18:15] 144,000 Jews that will be spared from
[18:18] the wrath of God during the Great
[18:20] Tribulation and so this event is still
[18:22] in the future that generation that saw
[18:25] the Fig Tree or Israel put forth its
[18:27] buds would not pass away until all the
[18:30] prophecy was fulfilled so I believe that
[18:33] refers to the 144,000 the 144,000 Born
[18:38] Again Jews during the tribulation will
[18:40] be the generation that will see all
[18:42] these things come to pass and six and
[18:45] finally the question says if Jesus
[18:47] didn't know knowledge but the father
[18:51] does know the knowledge doesn't this
[18:53] mean that the father is separate from
[18:54] the
[18:55] son my answer was yes the the son is a
[18:59] separate manifestation from God but not
[19:01] a separate person because if you make
[19:04] separate persons you make tritheism you
[19:06] make three persons and the Jews never
[19:09] taught three persons neither did any New
[19:11] Testament Bible author again First
[19:14] Timothy 3:16 Says that the son is a
[19:17] manifestation of God or an appearing of
[19:19] God remember God himself is invisible
[19:22] and cannot be seen and has never been
[19:24] seen but Jesus is the image of the
[19:26] invisible God we must only used Bible
[19:29] words remember Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 the
[19:32] Bible says add not unto God's words lest
[19:35] he call you a liar and then Revelation
[19:37] 22:18-19 says not to add to the book nor
[19:40] to take away from the book so we will
[19:42] not add three persons to the book we
[19:44] will not add Trinity to the book nor
[19:46] will we take anything out of the book
[19:48] that refers to Jesus and the father such
[19:51] as let us make man in our image in
[19:53] Genesis 1:27 we will not take that out
[19:55] of the book but we will not add two
[19:57] persons or three persons because awful
[20:00] consequences come on those who do one
[20:03] more thing before closing I want to
[20:04] remind the viewers that on pages 37- 40
[20:07] in my 2021 book The 12 New Testament
[20:10] Mysteries revealed it's in chapter 1 I
[20:13] address the godhead this chapter has
[20:15] numerous sections such as let us make
[20:17] man in our image Genesis
[20:20] 1:26 Matthew 20119 1 John 57 Jesus's
[20:25] baptism Jesus's prayers in Gethsemane
[20:28] other three-fold references and is Jesus
[20:30] the Eternal son one important section
[20:33] from pages 37 through 39 is called
[20:37] reducing persons leaves the mystery of
[20:40] plural nouns and in this section I show
[20:44] there's only one remaining mystery about
[20:46] the godhead and that's the usage of
[20:49] first person plural nouns like we us
[20:53] when those plural pronouns are used by
[20:55] Jesus or the
[20:57] father
[20:58] remember friends nouns are persons
[21:01] places or things and so in the case of
[21:04] the Bible when plural pronouns will be
[21:06] used like us or we it's not referring to
[21:09] separate
[21:11] persons it's referring to that Jesus's
[21:14] body was a thing Jesus was a
[21:16] manifestation of the person of God not a
[21:19] separate person and consider Jesus's
[21:23] body was a one-of-a-kind human
[21:25] manifestation completely unlike God's
[21:28] previous manifestations such as MDC a
[21:31] pillar of fire a burning bush a rock in
[21:33] the wilderness a voice in the Whirlwind
[21:35] Jesus was born of a woman Mary unlike
[21:38] mzc who had no father or mother using
[21:42] plural noun shows a difference between
[21:44] Jesus's flesh body and his Immortal
[21:46] invisible spirit that dwelt in him this
[21:50] is the best conclusion I found about the
[21:52] godhead it's so much more scriptural and
[21:55] much safer and reverent and and
[21:58] ultimately pleasing to God compared to
[22:00] the sin of adding to the uninspired
[22:03] words of the Trinity Doctrine it is so
[22:07] irreverent it is so disrespectful to add
[22:09] words like three persons or two persons
[22:12] to God's Bible and it is a awful sin to
[22:16] add any words to the
[22:18] Bible in closing friends I hope this
[22:21] video has been a blessing about these
[22:23] six questions regarding the godhead
[22:25] these are good common questions that we
[22:27] have as Believers as brother Ram said in
[22:30] that first quote from calling Jesus on
[22:32] the scene he said see there is the
[22:35] mystery so the mystery is between the
[22:37] father and the son there is no mystery
[22:39] between the Holy Ghost and the father or
[22:41] the Holy Ghost and the son the mystery
[22:43] is between the father and the son so
[22:46] we're grateful God's Prophet came with
[22:48] us sayith the Lord telling us that
[22:49] adding to the Bible three persons was of
[22:52] the devil we're thankful for that
[22:54] warning and we're thankful for the
[22:56] scriptures we continue to understand and
[22:58] the godhead by scripture alone Sola
[23:01] scriptura is the phrase that we want to
[23:03] use in relation to all our beliefs by
[23:06] scripture alone we're going to use the
[23:08] Holy Scripture only because the
[23:10] scripture is our absolute it's the
[23:12] written absolute of the person of the
[23:14] absolute Jesus Christ the absolute is a
[23:17] person and he gave us an absolute record
[23:20] of his plan and purpose for our lives
[23:22] the King James Holy Bible if you have
[23:25] any questions concerns or testimonies
[23:28] about this video please contact
[23:30] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:33] the desire of your
[23:39] [Music]
[23:41] heart
