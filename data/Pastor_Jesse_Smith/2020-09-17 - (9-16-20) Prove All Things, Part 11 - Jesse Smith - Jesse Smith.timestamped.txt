[36:41] [Music]
[36:43] let's go to acts chapter 17. i'd like to
[36:46] go back and look at that series prove
[36:48] all things
[36:49] uh since we had the debate on saturday i
[36:51] like to just kind of follow up a little
[36:52] bit on that
[36:54] and just look at some scriptures tonight
[36:57] and preach that by the grace of the lord
[37:02] so acts 17 verse 1 and 2. let's read
[37:06] that
[37:08] for our text here tonight
[37:23] now this we know this happened right
[37:24] after uh paul left uh
[37:26] philippi as we've been preaching on
[37:28] lately by god's grace
[37:30] uh acts 17 1-2
[37:35] well i mean we might we might read a
[37:36] little bit more why don't we read one to
[37:37] four because it kind of gives the the
[37:39] whole context
[37:40] and we'll try to watch our time here
[37:43] tonight by god's grace
[37:45] acts 17 1-4
[37:51] i'll read verse one and then we can all
[37:52] read verse two i'll read verse one now
[37:55] when they had passed through amphipolis
[37:58] and
[37:59] apollyonia they came to thessalonica
[38:02] where there was a synagogue of the jews
[38:05] let's all read verse two
[38:06] on three one two three and paul
[38:10] as his manner was went in unto them
[38:13] and three sabbath days reason with them
[38:17] out of the scriptures now i'll just read
[38:19] three and four because it's a little bit
[38:20] longer there
[38:21] opening and alleging that christ must
[38:23] have needs have suffered
[38:26] and risen again from the dead and that
[38:28] this jesus whom i preach
[38:30] unto you is christ and some of them
[38:33] believed
[38:35] and consorted with paul and silas and of
[38:37] the devout greeks
[38:39] a great multitude and of the chief women
[38:42] not a few
[38:44] praise god let's add one more word of
[38:46] prayer as we approach
[38:48] uh god's word here tonight let's have uh
[38:51] a moment uh uh communing with our lord
[38:53] again heavenly father we realize lord
[38:56] the word commune means to talk to
[38:58] so lord we commune with you again
[38:59] tonight lord god we thank you for the
[39:01] songs
[39:02] we ask the lord you bless us reading of
[39:03] your word lord god bless it to our
[39:05] hearts
[39:06] as we see where we are lord and as far
[39:08] as prophetically lord in the laodicean
[39:10] church age
[39:11] right before your coming and father
[39:13] we're earnestly contending for the faith
[39:15] which was once delivered to the saints
[39:17] and so father we're grateful lord to
[39:18] contend lord
[39:20] for your word and we ask oh god you'll
[39:22] bless us here tonight in jesus christ's
[39:24] name
[39:24] the saint said amen praise god maybe
[39:27] seated by god's grace
[39:32] so let's look here uh at the scripture
[39:35] and we will uh preach on prove all
[39:37] things part
[39:38] 11 the last time i preached i think was
[39:40] back in april
[39:42] and uh i remember i looked it up it was
[39:44] uh
[39:45] um god is our absolute i preached it
[39:48] from our house i think it was part of
[39:49] the
[39:50] the coveted time being at home uh so
[39:53] i remember one of the pastors called me
[39:54] up and thanked me for preaching that
[39:56] afterwards
[39:56] they enjoyed that message so let's go to
[39:58] acts uh we'll say in acts 17.
[40:01] we'll just make a few comments here by
[40:03] god's grace
[40:06] so paul leaves uh philippi
[40:09] and uh we know he here here he goes to
[40:12] thessalonica
[40:13] and i like verse two i think that's the
[40:15] main thing i want to emphasize there
[40:17] is that paul uh
[40:21] had a custom so this was paul's i
[40:23] believe second missionary trip if i'm
[40:25] not mistaken either second or third
[40:27] can't quite remember but paul's manner
[40:29] and that word manner means his custom or
[40:31] his habit
[40:33] and you probably remember luke four
[40:34] remember what was jesus's custom
[40:37] every synagogue he went into the sabbath
[40:39] praise god
[40:40] and so paul has the same custom as jesus
[40:43] christ
[40:44] his custom was to go into the synagogue
[40:46] there was no of course christian
[40:48] churches
[40:49] uh here paul's on a missionary journey
[40:51] and he's trying to tell the jews who had
[40:53] the latest message of the hour
[40:55] he was trying to tell him about the
[40:56] latest message of the hour
[40:58] which was jesus christ and so paul's
[41:01] habit is to go in unto them
[41:04] and reason with them out of the
[41:06] scriptures now let's look at that word
[41:08] reason uh it's the word uh the greek
[41:12] word
[41:13] dial egg i'm a a he so
[41:16] that's the best i can say it it means to
[41:18] converse
[41:19] or discourse i'm sorry discourse with
[41:21] one argue
[41:22] or discuss it means uh
[41:26] mingle thought with thought to ponder to
[41:28] revolve in your mind
[41:31] so we know synagogues had a very similar
[41:33] uh
[41:34] set up as churches do today they would
[41:36] have songs
[41:37] they'd have a a leader they would have
[41:40] someone who would read out of the
[41:41] scriptures they read out of moses right
[41:43] every synagogue and then we know it was
[41:46] part of the habit to call men now of
[41:49] course it was men only
[41:50] they would call men only and come up and
[41:52] read the scrolls and we know in luke 4
[41:55] jesus got the opportunity to come up and
[41:57] jesus
[41:58] sat down and everybody could tell after
[42:00] he read every everybody could tell there
[42:02] was something different about this time
[42:04] and then he said this day this scripture
[42:06] is fulfilled praise god
[42:08] and uh the bible said they all turned to
[42:10] look at him
[42:11] and uh and then they got upset with him
[42:13] and they chased him out of the church
[42:15] for saying that
[42:16] i have fulfilled these scriptures and we
[42:19] know that
[42:20] they took them to the cliff but yet we
[42:22] know jesus somehow
[42:24] uh even without a glorified body somehow
[42:26] was able to blind them
[42:28] and walk through them praise god because
[42:30] it was not yet his time in church what a
[42:32] consolation
[42:34] god won't let us go before it's our time
[42:36] praise god no matter if a whole
[42:37] multitude comes against you
[42:39] as we saw with george washington last
[42:41] year he had bullet holes in his jacket
[42:44] and he would come back from the battles
[42:45] and the bullets pierced the
[42:47] the the jacket but not his skin they i
[42:50] don't know how that's even possible
[42:52] but history records that he even wrote
[42:54] letters in his own journal about that
[42:56] you and i cannot go until it's our time
[42:58] to go
[42:59] praise god thank god amen that god is
[43:01] going to protect us
[43:03] and jesus could not be taken until it
[43:05] was his time
[43:07] but yet he constantly he went to church
[43:09] every time the church doors were open
[43:11] amen and on paul's missionary journeys
[43:13] he said well
[43:14] if i if i if if i don't have a local
[43:17] church to go to i'll go to the last
[43:19] the latest message before the christian
[43:21] message i'll go to the jewish
[43:23] synagogue and notice church he reasoned
[43:26] he argued
[43:27] or discussed or conversed with them now
[43:30] we know
[43:31] there's many quotes brother bam says he
[43:33] don't believe in debating praise god
[43:35] you don't believe in debating with the
[43:37] wrong attitude right
[43:38] and so paul if the scripture says he
[43:41] reasoned
[43:42] and he debated then we know he didn't do
[43:44] it with the evil intent
[43:46] right in other words paul didn't debate
[43:48] with them to try to
[43:49] send them to hell right paul debated
[43:52] with them in order to convince them
[43:55] or persuade them that jesus had
[43:57] fulfilled the scripture
[43:59] now isn't that interesting church a
[44:01] prophet of god
[44:02] was anointed of the holy spirit to
[44:05] debate with
[44:06] jews and not everybody believed right
[44:09] not everybody believed and if we know
[44:12] that was the birth of the church and
[44:13] that was where they had the most
[44:15] converts
[44:15] yet we're at the end uh of the church
[44:19] age where very few are going to find it
[44:22] and paul saves some of his how many are
[44:24] we going to save
[44:25] well probably very few right probably
[44:28] very very few
[44:29] because the bible said in verse 4 only
[44:31] some of them believed
[44:34] and they consorted with paul and silas
[44:37] so it wasn't many it was uh just some
[44:42] and so we can see how paul paul had
[44:45] could do miracles
[44:46] paul had many miracles in his ministry
[44:48] many many but yet in many cases god
[44:50] didn't give him miracles every time he
[44:52] preached the word
[44:54] uh we know three saturdays in a row he
[44:56] went in there
[44:57] and then he would obviously have to wait
[44:59] his turn right
[45:00] and then he would have to he'd have to
[45:02] share the scriptures from the old
[45:04] testament where christ
[45:06] had fulfilled that and try to prove to
[45:08] them
[45:09] uh that it was fulfilled now notice
[45:11] here's a man
[45:12] let me move this over here here's a man
[45:15] church that had seen jesus he'd seen the
[45:17] pillar of fire
[45:18] but could he convince everybody of that
[45:20] no he could only convince
[45:22] some of them he could only convince the
[45:24] elected praise god
[45:26] in other words the four known the ones
[45:28] god god foreknew
[45:30] that wanted the truth that wanted to
[45:32] believe in a living god not just a dead
[45:34] letter
[45:34] not just a moses uh circumcision works
[45:37] based
[45:38] uh a covenant god for knew that there
[45:41] would only be some that really wanted to
[45:43] serve a living god
[45:44] and wasn't interested in legalism and
[45:46] wasn't interested
[45:47] uh in self-righteousness but really was
[45:50] interested
[45:50] in the righteousness of god oh and i
[45:53] believe there are some today that are
[45:54] still that way praise god
[45:55] they want to serve the living god they
[45:57] want to serve the god of the pillar of
[45:59] fire praise god
[46:00] and they have a desire for truth not for
[46:02] their righteousness
[46:03] but to inherit christ's righteousness
[46:06] and to live with his life with his
[46:08] holiness there are still people today
[46:10] like you and i that want to live that
[46:12] way
[46:12] amen thank god we're some of those
[46:15] praise god
[46:17] and so many people you know take those
[46:19] quotes where there are a few quotes
[46:20] brother braham says
[46:21] you know i don't believe in debating yet
[46:23] we know uh brother branham
[46:25] did have debates and he did attend at
[46:28] least a couple
[46:29] uh from the quotes brother branham said
[46:31] that jesus debated with the 12 priests
[46:34] when
[46:34] or the priest when he was 12 years old
[46:37] did you know that was a debate
[46:40] he's 12 years old and he's in the
[46:41] synagogue the temple right
[46:43] debating with the the doctors and the
[46:45] doctors are astonished at his answers
[46:49] so jesus was jesus debated right and if
[46:52] jesus could debate and do it with the
[46:53] right spirit
[46:54] paul could do it too because paul was
[46:56] filled with jesus spirit praise god
[46:59] and so that's one that many people
[47:01] forget and my brother cam
[47:02] shared one with me yesterday that you
[47:04] know uh
[47:06] brother bosworth wanted to have the
[47:07] debate with dr best
[47:09] right but brother man said no we're not
[47:11] going to be a part of that uh but
[47:12] brother bosworth begged him and said
[47:14] brother branham i'm just going to say
[47:15] with the scripture i'm just going to do
[47:16] it in love i'm going to i'm going to be
[47:17] very loving and brother man i said okay
[47:20] a church look at that brother is trying
[47:21] to talk him out of it
[47:23] but then he he changes his position uh
[47:26] uh
[47:26] brother bosworth goes and then brother
[47:28] branham doesn't stay at home he goes to
[47:30] the debate
[47:32] so people that they want to just take
[47:33] one quote like there's people that say
[47:35] well
[47:35] never do debates brother bam said we
[47:37] don't believe in debates yet brother
[47:38] branham agreed to it
[47:41] gave him permission to go and then
[47:42] attended the the debate
[47:44] and we all know what happened at the end
[47:46] praise god is that right
[47:48] they ask brother can you come down and
[47:50] pray for the
[47:51] the closing and brother man comes out
[47:54] and said how many
[47:55] are witnesses that divine healing's
[47:57] right and he said almost every hand went
[47:59] up in that houston coliseum
[48:00] in 1950 he said let's have a word of
[48:04] prayer
[48:04] and the man and dr best said go take a
[48:06] picture of the ram the man took seven
[48:08] pictures
[48:09] the first six were blank the seventh had
[48:11] the pillar of fire
[48:13] so let me tell you this church if people
[48:14] say they they don't they don't
[48:16] believe in debates well there's a debate
[48:18] that god attended
[48:20] amen there's a debate the pillar of fire
[48:24] attendant and the prophet praise god
[48:26] now the prophet wasn't the one debating
[48:29] right but
[48:30] the pillar of fire was there to settle
[48:31] the debate hallelujah amen
[48:34] but see you can't throw out acts 17
[48:36] either you can't get rid of that
[48:38] right uh the message brothers message
[48:40] did not come to point us away from the
[48:42] bible
[48:43] it came to return us to the bible amen
[48:47] this was paul's manner if there's no
[48:50] message churches
[48:51] i'll go in and try to persuade them now
[48:54] today we got churches praise god
[48:57] so we don't have to go to where there
[48:59] are no churches and
[49:00] and try to convince them as i said we
[49:04] sent out what 1200
[49:05] invitations two years ago in the summer
[49:08] of 2018 and two people come to church
[49:10] you know
[49:11] you can try to uh we can try to invite
[49:13] them
[49:15] so we'll keep trying by the grace of the
[49:16] lord so look
[49:18] only some a man who'd met the pillar of
[49:20] fire
[49:21] only some people believe him after
[49:24] debating the scripture
[49:26] so we know uh brother and says all hell
[49:29] is against this teaching
[49:30] praise god all hell's against it and so
[49:33] satan is going to be battling the masses
[49:35] bringing up any evil thought right any
[49:38] evil thing about paul
[49:39] no doubt satan was bringing that up all
[49:40] the bad parts about paul
[49:42] making paul look bad and just as they do
[49:44] it today they'll bring up
[49:46] all the human parts of brother branham
[49:48] won't they
[49:49] and try to and try to shift the debate
[49:52] and church that was uh part of the
[49:54] debate we'll get that in just a moment
[49:56] here
[49:58] here let me read another in 1961 brother
[50:00] brahm said
[50:01] he was in chicago 300 ministers
[50:05] stood there to debate him he said and
[50:09] the lord told me gave me a vision and
[50:11] told me where we'd be and what we do
[50:13] i stood before 300 trinitarian ministers
[50:15] and i said now
[50:16] if i am so wrong in this doctrine some
[50:18] of you man stand up here and show me
[50:20] where i'm wrong
[50:20] by the scripture without a textbook if
[50:23] there is no such a thing as a serpent
[50:24] seed or somebody like
[50:26] that i've been teaching just come here
[50:27] now and show me by the scriptures
[50:29] he said nobody he said nobody move
[50:32] because it can't be done that's true
[50:33] not to be different but it's just the
[50:35] truth it's the word
[50:37] he said no one can debate that that's
[50:39] the word of god
[50:40] nobody can do it amen and remember
[50:43] church in this story brother ma'am said
[50:44] lord
[50:45] i'm not going to go down and brother
[50:46] brahm said the holy spirit said don't
[50:48] fear
[50:49] go down i'll be with you amen
[50:53] in a debate see see so church what does
[50:55] it come down to debates
[50:57] or these things must be led by the holy
[50:59] spirit
[51:00] yes i would never go into a debate well
[51:03] i wouldn't want to go i might make a
[51:04] mistake but
[51:04] i wouldn't want to go into a debate
[51:06] without the leadership of the holy
[51:08] spirit
[51:09] right neither would paul
[51:13] in church the reason i did it was to try
[51:14] to win a soul but also to stand up and
[51:17] defend the gospel
[51:18] i was trying to win the soul back to the
[51:20] message of the hour
[51:23] and so it's scriptural paul did it now
[51:25] let's be there's there's numerous
[51:26] pictures
[51:27] let's go over a few more so you can see
[51:28] this wasn't something paul just did one
[51:30] time
[51:31] go the next chapter acts chapter 18.
[51:39] now he became a temp maker look at that
[51:41] a man who's seen the pillar of fire
[51:43] wouldn't let people feed him now look at
[51:45] that church look at think about
[51:46] preachers today
[51:48] this man of god who seen the pillar of
[51:50] fire would not let everybody
[51:52] work for him he went and worked for
[51:54] himself
[51:55] he wouldn't let them wait on him hand
[51:57] and foot
[51:58] that's the reason sister beatrice i like
[52:00] to do sweeping in the
[52:01] in the room over there because i don't
[52:04] want to become
[52:05] a callous preacher i don't want to
[52:08] become a prideful preacher
[52:09] please let me take out the trash
[52:10] sometime please
[52:13] please let me wipe the table sometimes
[52:15] because i don't want to become
[52:17] a self-righteous prideful preacher
[52:20] there's a reason paul did that remember
[52:22] he did it because he didn't want to
[52:23] hinder the flow of the gospel
[52:24] and you sisters have always done a great
[52:26] job of letting me do that so thank you
[52:28] always and all the saints have always
[52:29] let me do a good job nobody's ever
[52:31] ripped the bag out of my
[52:32] hand or rebuked me for trying to do that
[52:34] i realized church said
[52:36] i gotta stay humble and i realize that's
[52:37] one way god can help me to stay humble
[52:40] is to make myself a servant
[52:43] i'm not here to be served i'm here
[52:46] to serve that's what the word minister
[52:48] means right children you got
[52:50] we like that little uh we got a little
[52:52] play or not a play but an audio drama
[52:55] and the little girl asks what is a
[52:57] minister
[52:59] and the minister goes a servant
[53:02] and the girl goes oh you're you're my
[53:04] ser you're not my servant
[53:07] and i feel i feel so little every time i
[53:09] watch that yes
[53:11] i am supposed to serve you praise god
[53:14] and if not then i've got the wrong
[53:16] attitude and i'm backslidden
[53:17] if i haven't become the servant i have
[53:20] to be the servant
[53:21] i appreciate when other people serve but
[53:23] the reality of it is i've
[53:25] got to be the servant if i'm not the
[53:27] servant then
[53:28] something's wrong i must be the servant
[53:32] a minister serves and yes i minister the
[53:34] word i love doing that i love
[53:36] ministering song
[53:37] i get to do that tonight i love doing
[53:39] that but i want to serve in other ways
[53:42] too praise god so i don't get exalted or
[53:44] ever think i'm above
[53:46] something many people don't know it but
[53:49] i like to
[53:49] i like to scrub the toilets on saturday
[53:51] i don't tell that to many people
[53:53] and hardly anybody watches this anyway
[53:55] but that's what i like to do on saturday
[53:56] i like to bring the kids here when i got
[53:58] a free
[53:58] and just scrub the toilets and just make
[54:00] sure everything's clean and i like to do
[54:01] my part
[54:02] when there's a little grease spill on
[54:04] that wood floor in there
[54:06] i like to get on my hands and knees and
[54:07] scrub it
[54:09] because i know it keeps me humble of
[54:10] course our ties paid for that too that's
[54:12] why i like
[54:12] your ties paid for that's why i like to
[54:14] keep it clean
[54:15] ty's paid for these chairs you ties
[54:18] almost paid for everything in here
[54:20] because i know it's it's for god's glory
[54:22] it's all that he might be magnified
[54:24] praise god
[54:26] see paul was a servant he was a tet
[54:28] maker a man who'd seen the pillar fire
[54:30] can you imagine could sit by a poor on
[54:33] let's say a homeless man
[54:34] while he's making tents he can make
[54:36] tents too
[54:37] he never said well i'm greater than you
[54:39] i've seen the pillar of fire he could
[54:41] sit down
[54:42] and make tents with the temp maker
[54:44] hallelujah praise god
[54:46] now that's humility church that's
[54:48] humility
[54:50] and paul said i had to suffer the loss
[54:52] of all things that i might gain christ
[54:55] he had to lose all his pride all his
[54:57] prestige
[54:58] and that's my prayer i've said it before
[54:59] i prayed again god just take anything
[55:02] out of my life that
[55:03] that would make me be prideful humbly do
[55:05] whatever you can
[55:06] help me to be a humble servant for jesus
[55:08] christ
[55:11] paul was no uh paul was no king or lord
[55:14] he would remember he was rejected at the
[55:15] end of his ministry by asia look at 18
[55:18] 4 acts 18 4.
[55:22] paul had a job outside of preaching it
[55:24] was tent making
[55:26] so i got to remind myself of that so i
[55:27] don't have a pity party and get prideful
[55:31] i've had different people tell me that
[55:32] they say brother jess i can trust you
[55:34] more because you're out there you're
[55:37] working amongst the people
[55:38] you've got a battle and you've got to
[55:39] overcome
[55:42] well i said well praise the lord
[55:43] whatever god leads verse 4
[55:45] and he reasoned in the synagogue every
[55:48] sabbath he didn't take a saturday off
[55:51] he would go in there and try to debate
[55:54] and talk and converse
[55:57] and persuaded the jews and the greeks
[56:02] now remember this is the story when they
[56:03] blast him he said fine he said
[56:05] you blasphemed i'm going to the gentiles
[56:10] yeah he said in verse 6 he goes he said
[56:11] i'm clean from henceforth i will go
[56:14] unto the gentiles and look god opened up
[56:17] another house there the house of justice
[56:18] that's at corinth yeah that's right
[56:20] the corinthian church this is the
[56:21] beginning of the corinthian church now
[56:23] notice he was afraid look at verse 9 and
[56:25] then spake the lord to paul in the night
[56:26] by the vision
[56:28] he's in corinth he's all afraid and he
[56:30] said be not afraid but speak
[56:31] and hold not thy peace for i am with
[56:34] thee and no man
[56:35] shall set on thee to hurt thee for i
[56:38] much people
[56:39] in this city praise god amen look at
[56:41] that
[56:42] church we're all human even a man that
[56:45] seen the pillar of fire sister beatrice
[56:47] was scared he was going to get arrested
[56:49] can you imagine that he'd seen the
[56:51] pillar of fire sister naomi ceda come in
[56:54] and he met the pillar of fire for three
[56:55] years in arabia
[56:58] and yet he still feared for his life oh
[57:00] this makes me feel so good
[57:02] that god understands my weaknesses
[57:05] and if i'm scared god's gonna encourage
[57:08] me and make me bold praise god
[57:11] in my little humble estate paul is way
[57:14] up here
[57:14] we're i'm way down here you you're
[57:16] probably higher than me
[57:18] but in my humble little state god care
[57:21] would care
[57:21] so much that he would encourage me and
[57:24] tell me not to fear for he's with me
[57:26] he promised never to leave me
[57:32] so he took every saturday he could on
[57:34] his missionary trips
[57:36] and then the holy spirit encouraged him
[57:38] said don't be afraid you're going to
[57:39] have a good revival in this city
[57:42] oh thank the lord what a revival praise
[57:45] god
[57:45] now go to the later to the end of the
[57:47] chapter verse 19.
[57:51] verse 19 and he came to ephesus and left
[57:54] them there and he himself entered into
[57:55] the synagogue and reasoned with the jews
[57:57] everybody see a pattern here
[57:59] on this particular missionary trip this
[58:01] is how he started the philippian church
[58:03] right
[58:03] the thessalonica church right the
[58:05] letters to the thessalonians
[58:07] here the ephesians yeah god gave him
[58:10] miracles in some of these places but he
[58:12] after the miracle what'd he do he didn't
[58:14] sit back and said everybody give me your
[58:16] ties i'm just going to sit at home and
[58:18] read and relax he went out and made
[58:21] tents right
[58:22] and then he made sure on the sabbaths he
[58:25] made sure to go to the church and try to
[58:27] persuade people to believe that jesus is
[58:29] the christ
[58:31] he just used his argument his debate now
[58:33] not a not an evil argument right
[58:35] but just a good a good answer to a
[58:37] question
[58:40] his arguments right not not
[58:43] anything evil spirited but arguments
[58:47] in other words a good answer to a
[58:49] question
[58:52] so anybody says brother braham don't
[58:53] believe in debates well they don't know
[58:55] the quotes
[58:56] all of them and they don't know paul
[58:58] either
[58:59] because paul constantly was in debate
[59:02] now you remember this uh i preached a
[59:05] few weeks ago
[59:06] well probably months by now acts 24 25
[59:10] he's with felix this rich man this ruler
[59:13] and he's almost persuades him to be a
[59:15] christian acts 24
[59:17] 25
[59:20] oh i just saw a good scripture go to
[59:22] verse 13. oh this is just like brother
[59:24] branham man
[59:26] with that debate bless their hearts but
[59:28] that gentleman
[59:29] very nice gentleman sincerely wrong
[59:33] neither can they prove the things
[59:35] whereof they now
[59:36] accuse me isn't this it they're trying
[59:38] to accuse brother branham of lying about
[59:40] this
[59:41] they say brother ram never went to the
[59:42] graves brother ram never went to the
[59:43] vatican
[59:44] and church they can't even prove it
[59:48] they have no proof but i like it it just
[59:50] shows we got the right
[59:51] holy spirit right but the the wrong
[59:54] spirit will constantly accuse the true
[59:56] messengers of god
[59:57] see what they're trying to do they're
[59:58] trying to get their eyes off the word
[1:00:00] amen and i hope anybody that watches
[1:00:03] that debate that gets their eye on the
[1:00:05] word of god that we're pointing to
[1:00:06] praise god
[1:00:08] we're only pointing to the word of god
[1:00:10] hallelujah
[1:00:11] but there's all these distractions out
[1:00:13] there paul said they can't prove it
[1:00:15] if brother rand was here he they'd say
[1:00:17] he'd say they can't prove it
[1:00:19] they can't they weren't there they're
[1:00:22] looking at their dates and they're
[1:00:23] looking at
[1:00:24] uh plain logs right they're looking at
[1:00:26] uh visitors logs and they're looking at
[1:00:28] records from indiana
[1:00:30] you know people falling off a bridge
[1:00:31] they're looking at all these records
[1:00:33] from the coast guard and
[1:00:34] all these things like that like there's
[1:00:36] any record like brother jose told me
[1:00:37] yesterday where is jesus birth
[1:00:39] certificate anybody got it
[1:00:42] anybody got it well they must not have
[1:00:45] been so
[1:00:46] right there's no record of it anybody
[1:00:47] got moses
[1:00:49] moses birth certificate from egypt
[1:00:53] his 40 years of training as a military
[1:00:55] general anybody's got his uh
[1:00:57] his uh degrees anybody can anybody prove
[1:00:59] any of that there's no proof to that
[1:01:01] so i've said it before we can't make
[1:01:03] those things the absolute the absolute
[1:01:05] has to be the word of god something
[1:01:06] that's steadfast
[1:01:08] something that will never change the
[1:01:09] word of god
[1:01:11] amen hallelujah thank god
[1:01:14] paul constantly reasoned they can't
[1:01:17] prove what they
[1:01:18] talk about him now verse 20
[1:01:21] 24 24 and and after certain days verse
[1:01:24] 24
[1:01:26] when felix came with his wife drusilla
[1:01:28] which was a jewish he sent for paul
[1:01:30] and heard him concerning the faith of
[1:01:31] christ now look at that he wanted to
[1:01:33] hear it
[1:01:34] verse 25 and as he reason of
[1:01:37] righteousness temperance
[1:01:38] and judgment to come felix trembled and
[1:01:40] answered go thy way for this time
[1:01:42] when i have a convenient season i will
[1:01:44] call for thee
[1:01:45] and remember it was all about money
[1:01:47] verse 26.
[1:01:49] that's quite a thing to see people
[1:01:51] tremble under the presence of god
[1:01:54] when they tell them about judgment you
[1:01:55] tell them about the tribulation tell
[1:01:56] them about these things
[1:01:58] it makes someone who's sincere makes
[1:02:00] them tremble most people they laugh
[1:02:01] about it because they're on drugs or
[1:02:02] they're
[1:02:03] drinking alcohol or smoking marijuana or
[1:02:05] something like that most people don't
[1:02:07] want to hear it they don't tremble at
[1:02:08] the word of god
[1:02:09] but a sincere heart will tremble and
[1:02:12] look what he did he
[1:02:13] reasoned he tried to get them to see the
[1:02:16] truth of the scripture all right
[1:02:22] now i want to go back to a scripture we
[1:02:24] read go back to philippians 1
[1:02:25] 7 we preached it months ago
[1:02:28] philippians 1 7.
[1:02:36] now this is where i felt led to do the
[1:02:46] debate
[1:02:53] you know we always say the works that i
[1:02:54] do shall you do also right we always say
[1:02:56] that john 14 12.
[1:02:58] well what about paul what about paul's
[1:03:00] works well part of paul's works were
[1:03:02] debates
[1:03:02] right jesus jesus debated
[1:03:06] right he reasoned with the pharisees he
[1:03:08] debated well so did paul
[1:03:10] so that this is included in the works of
[1:03:13] the holy spirit
[1:03:15] see giving people a chance trying to
[1:03:17] persuade them to go to heaven
[1:03:20] in our case trying to get them to the
[1:03:21] rapture philippians 1 7.
[1:03:27] now verse 6 of course let's just read
[1:03:28] that because it makes us so thankful
[1:03:30] being confident of this very thing that
[1:03:32] he which hath begun a good work in you
[1:03:34] will perform it until the day of christ
[1:03:37] thank you lord
[1:03:39] for not getting rid of me thank you lord
[1:03:40] that you're going to finish what you
[1:03:41] started
[1:03:42] verse seven even as is it is meat for me
[1:03:45] to think this of you all
[1:03:47] because i have you in my heart in as
[1:03:50] much as both in my bonds
[1:03:52] and in defense and confirmation of the
[1:03:55] gospel
[1:03:56] ye are all partakers of my grace
[1:04:00] so remember we preached this and paul he
[1:04:03] was set
[1:04:04] for the defense of the gospel now
[1:04:06] defense
[1:04:07] is the greek word apologia and this word
[1:04:10] means
[1:04:11] answering for yourself clearing yourself
[1:04:14] verbal defense speech in defense a
[1:04:17] reason statement or
[1:04:19] argument so paul said i am set for the
[1:04:22] defense
[1:04:23] of the gospel i'm going to clear myself
[1:04:25] i'm going to give a verbal defense i'm
[1:04:27] going to defend the truth of god
[1:04:30] and then confirmation let's look up
[1:04:32] confirmation
[1:04:35] the action of confirming something or
[1:04:37] the state of being confirmed
[1:04:39] giving a verification or a proof or a
[1:04:42] testimony
[1:04:44] so it was for the defense and proof of
[1:04:46] the gospel
[1:04:48] amen glory and remember i remember when
[1:04:52] i preached it i was really fired up that
[1:04:54] morning
[1:04:55] sunday morning i still remember it and i
[1:04:57] and i
[1:04:58] and i remember preaching i said i
[1:04:59] believe with all my heart i'm a defender
[1:05:01] of the message
[1:05:03] i don't know if you remember that but as
[1:05:04] we're worshiping i got an email pop up
[1:05:06] on my
[1:05:06] ipad and it said uh the believed sign
[1:05:09] people are back
[1:05:11] and they're wanting to debate more
[1:05:12] people and so i took it right there i
[1:05:14] said right while i'm
[1:05:15] i just preached it right there now
[1:05:17] they're ready to start back up i said
[1:05:19] i'll take that debate
[1:05:20] because i was under the leadership of
[1:05:22] the holy spirit i was preaching the word
[1:05:23] of god
[1:05:24] i believed i was the defender of the
[1:05:26] gospel like paul
[1:05:28] and then i get an email right at the end
[1:05:31] and i've already got numerous good
[1:05:32] testimonies back people were really
[1:05:34] blessed
[1:05:34] they recognized i had the right spirit
[1:05:37] um they recognized i was using scripture
[1:05:40] and some people that even disagree with
[1:05:42] me and still say brother brahms are not
[1:05:43] a prophet
[1:05:44] they said at least you have the right
[1:05:45] spirit praise god
[1:05:48] so i thank the lord for that yes church
[1:05:51] we are to defend
[1:05:52] the message and remember the message is
[1:05:55] not everything
[1:05:57] on tape it's the word of god that god is
[1:05:59] fulfilling
[1:06:00] right now i'm going to read that quote
[1:06:02] just so everybody gots it
[1:06:04] i hope it's a familiar one to you
[1:06:09] so what is the message brother ram said
[1:06:11] he said many of you strangers
[1:06:13] hear these men get up and make remarks
[1:06:15] about a message of the hour and so forth
[1:06:17] what are they getting at is god's
[1:06:20] promise of this hour
[1:06:21] what he promised he would do and we see
[1:06:24] him
[1:06:25] scripturally of vindicating just exactly
[1:06:28] what he said he would do
[1:06:29] in the same manner he said foretold
[1:06:32] hits just exactly perfectly each time
[1:06:36] because it's god saying it amen
[1:06:39] thank the lord that's from the rapture
[1:06:41] 1965 what is
[1:06:43] what are these brothers talking about a
[1:06:44] message it's god's
[1:06:46] vindication scriptural vindication of
[1:06:49] what he would do in other words the
[1:06:50] message is
[1:06:51] prophecy that's being fulfilled right
[1:06:53] now and the prophecy came from the bible
[1:06:55] praise god
[1:06:56] amen that's what many people don't
[1:06:59] understand the message is not every
[1:07:01] thought on tape
[1:07:02] the message is the scripture god is
[1:07:04] fulfilling right now
[1:07:06] hallelujah that's what i'm defending
[1:07:08] that's what we're standing up for that's
[1:07:10] what we sacrificed
[1:07:11] everything for that's what we've left
[1:07:13] everything for is to defend the bible
[1:07:15] what god is doing right now
[1:07:18] amen
[1:07:22] and remember church if you put one two
[1:07:26] three
[1:07:27] four five six six scriptures together
[1:07:29] you come to this conclusion
[1:07:31] jesus remains in heaven and will not
[1:07:34] physically return to the earth until all
[1:07:36] things
[1:07:37] including bible doctrine and the hearts
[1:07:39] of believers
[1:07:40] are restored to their original apostolic
[1:07:44] conditions
[1:07:44] by the preaching of a prophet anointed
[1:07:47] with the spirit of elijah praise god if
[1:07:49] that ain't the bible truth i don't know
[1:07:51] what is amen
[1:07:52] what can what can and notice those
[1:07:54] people the debate they didn't say
[1:07:56] one thing about these scriptures amen
[1:07:59] they couldn't say one thing about these
[1:08:00] scriptures that we're reading
[1:08:02] that are speaking a prophecy being
[1:08:04] fulfilled now they can't say one thing
[1:08:06] about it
[1:08:06] why because they they can't handle it
[1:08:08] they can't believe it they got to stay
[1:08:10] away from it they'll point to everything
[1:08:12] that's not scripture
[1:08:13] right but you and i can point to the
[1:08:15] scripture he said search the scriptures
[1:08:17] for in them you think
[1:08:18] you have eternal life and they are they
[1:08:20] which testify on me
[1:08:22] the scriptures are what testified to
[1:08:24] william branham
[1:08:25] and also for us the scripture is what
[1:08:27] testified of the bride amen
[1:08:30] getting ready for the rapture hallelujah
[1:08:33] the scripture testifies of that
[1:08:37] this restoration my
[1:08:40] the bible says the mouth of two or three
[1:08:42] witnesses let every word be established
[1:08:44] we got way more than two or three got a
[1:08:46] lot more than that
[1:08:52] pull up uh lydia if you could uh matthew
[1:08:55] 13 34 and 35. i referenced this but i
[1:08:57] didn't go over it really deeply
[1:09:01] i don't know if i've ever taught this
[1:09:02] here at the church but um maybe i did i
[1:09:05] can't remember
[1:09:06] of all these things make jesus unto the
[1:09:08] multitude in parables
[1:09:11] and without a parable spake he not unto
[1:09:13] them a parable of course is a story
[1:09:15] that tells a truth it may not even be a
[1:09:18] true story
[1:09:18] right but it tells a truth okay now next
[1:09:22] scripture verse 35
[1:09:23] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:09:24] spoken by the prophet saying i will open
[1:09:26] my mouth in parables
[1:09:29] i will utter things which have been kept
[1:09:31] secret from the foundation of the world
[1:09:32] now just leave that up there for a
[1:09:33] moment huh
[1:09:34] remember the pharisees and sadducees had
[1:09:37] their mishna remember the mishnah
[1:09:39] it was the the rabbis traditions of what
[1:09:42] the word meant
[1:09:43] so they studied their books right
[1:09:46] their interpretation more than the word
[1:09:49] of god
[1:09:50] right and they're so smart and they're
[1:09:53] scribes and they're just
[1:09:54] you know they're they're copying both
[1:09:55] the scrolls and the mishnah but they
[1:09:58] love their mishnah right you gotta wash
[1:10:00] your hands and
[1:10:00] you have to wear these fringes so far
[1:10:02] and do certain things
[1:10:04] right the things they could do the
[1:10:06] things their flesh could do right
[1:10:08] they were so concerned about that
[1:10:11] and god sends jesus
[1:10:14] not to go to the mishnah but just to
[1:10:16] tell humble stories
[1:10:20] right stories about uh
[1:10:23] trees right stories about planting in
[1:10:26] the field
[1:10:27] and four different kinds of grounds just
[1:10:29] a common common story
[1:10:31] but yet it opened up the revelation of
[1:10:33] four different kinds of people praise
[1:10:35] god
[1:10:36] four classes of people he preaches just
[1:10:38] on wheat and tares and a common ophio
[1:10:41] and open up the mystery of the serpent
[1:10:43] seed praise god amen
[1:10:45] just these simple humble stories a woman
[1:10:48] baking bread and injecting three
[1:10:50] measures three little measuring cups of
[1:10:52] leaven
[1:10:54] into it and that's the roman catholic
[1:10:55] church putting in the father
[1:10:58] son holy ghost and it perverts the whole
[1:11:00] bread
[1:11:01] right but just and they're like huh
[1:11:05] interesting he does a lot of miracles
[1:11:06] but he just tells these simple
[1:11:08] child-like stories
[1:11:09] but god said that's how i want it i want
[1:11:12] the humble
[1:11:12] believer just to be able to see the
[1:11:14] miracles and then hear the voice and
[1:11:16] catch it that we don't add any leaven to
[1:11:18] the word of god
[1:11:19] the word of god is unleavened amen
[1:11:22] hallelujah the real bride the real woman
[1:11:24] the real church of god
[1:11:25] she doesn't answer any leaven it's just
[1:11:27] word only praise god
[1:11:31] thank the lord hallelujah that's us
[1:11:33] church that's you and i
[1:11:35] the bride who's got the real bread of
[1:11:36] god the unleavened bread the bible says
[1:11:39] let us
[1:11:40] keep the feast of unleavened bread of
[1:11:42] sincerity and truth
[1:11:45] that's us
[1:11:50] huh so the bible said jesus would use
[1:11:55] parables huh i will utter things which
[1:11:58] have been kept secret
[1:11:59] from the foundation world he sure did
[1:12:01] when he uttered father son holy ghost
[1:12:02] nobody had ever uttered that before
[1:12:06] thank you jesus praise god what was
[1:12:09] jesus speaking and
[1:12:10] he uh the bible calls it enigma the
[1:12:12] bible calls it a dark saying
[1:12:14] jesus was speaking in a riddle that's
[1:12:16] what the bible calls it
[1:12:18] you want to see that in the scripture
[1:12:20] let's go to psalm 78
[1:12:22] 2-3 so matthew 13 35
[1:12:26] fulfilled by the prophet right spoken by
[1:12:28] the prophet go to
[1:12:29] psalm 78 2-3 see if it was david or
[1:12:33] another prophet
[1:12:35] i didn't get a chance to look that one
[1:12:36] up psalm 78 2-3 so
[1:12:38] which prophet said jesus was going to
[1:12:41] teach in riddles which prophet
[1:12:43] and which scripture was it
[1:12:47] oh this is asaph okay so one of the
[1:12:50] songwriters bible called him a prophet
[1:12:55] look at verse one give ear o my people
[1:12:57] to my law incline your ears to the words
[1:13:00] of my mouth
[1:13:00] you see that church incline what's that
[1:13:02] i mean
[1:13:04] humble yourself right incline everybody
[1:13:06] just wants to hear what they want to
[1:13:08] hear
[1:13:08] but the bible said you got to humble
[1:13:10] yourself get listened closely right it's
[1:13:12] a still small voice
[1:13:15] verse two i will open my mouth in a
[1:13:19] parable i will utter dark sayings
[1:13:22] of old just leave that up there
[1:13:26] uh verse two yeah sorry
[1:13:29] well go and read three which we have
[1:13:31] heard and known and our fathers have
[1:13:33] told us
[1:13:39] oh glory okay go to verse two okay so
[1:13:42] uh this is the scripture matthew was
[1:13:45] referring to
[1:13:46] i will utter dark sayings in the hebrew
[1:13:48] this means enigma which which means a
[1:13:50] riddle
[1:13:52] how many people like riddles you like
[1:13:54] solving riddles
[1:13:56] god said i'm going to anoint my son and
[1:13:59] he's going to teach
[1:14:00] parables kids stories and he's going to
[1:14:03] teach and he's going to speak in riddles
[1:14:05] enigmas that smart people can't figure
[1:14:08] out
[1:14:09] and the bible said they'd be secrets not
[1:14:11] uttered from the foundation of the world
[1:14:14] praise god see because he knew how smart
[1:14:18] and how intelligent people would be
[1:14:20] but they would miss the very humble
[1:14:22] meanings
[1:14:23] of the parables and they wouldn't be
[1:14:25] able to figure out
[1:14:27] the riddle of the word of god
[1:14:33] they wouldn't want to live by every word
[1:14:35] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:14:36] rather than just believing in searching
[1:14:38] the scripture they just wrote their own
[1:14:40] interpretation
[1:14:41] to give themselves power and authority
[1:14:43] right help
[1:14:44] to make everybody else serve them
[1:14:47] their interpretation of it but god said
[1:14:49] i'm going to send my son
[1:14:51] to speak in parables he's going to speak
[1:14:53] uh child stories
[1:14:54] and the meanings will have to be
[1:14:55] spiritually discerned by the holy spirit
[1:14:57] praise god
[1:14:58] now i'm going to speak in riddles where
[1:15:00] uh the natural mind can't understand it
[1:15:02] because the natural things
[1:15:03] receiveth not the things of the holy
[1:15:08] spirit
[1:15:10] thank the lord things not uttered from
[1:15:13] the foundation of the world
[1:15:16] as far as i know church the father son
[1:15:19] holy ghost was one of those
[1:15:20] it was never uttered the they never
[1:15:23] wrote it in all the old testament where
[1:15:24] they said
[1:15:25] father the one name of the father son
[1:15:28] and holy ghost
[1:15:30] also the mysteries of the seven seals
[1:15:33] right
[1:15:34] if you look at the book of the old
[1:15:35] testament where did the old testament
[1:15:36] ever talk about seven seals
[1:15:39] right he never talked about that there
[1:15:41] was all these things that were gonna
[1:15:42] come over
[1:15:43] that were never uttered the first time
[1:15:45] they were uttered through men like paul
[1:15:47] and peter and john and of course the
[1:15:50] lord jesus teaching all the parables
[1:15:52] praise god
[1:15:53] oh my thank the lord all these parables
[1:15:56] about weddings and suppers oh come on
[1:15:58] church
[1:15:59] this whole thing was about jesus getting
[1:16:01] a bride amen
[1:16:03] never uttered before this whole thing is
[1:16:05] about jesus finding a bride
[1:16:07] who would give him preeminence
[1:16:12] a bride that would put on the wedding
[1:16:15] garment right
[1:16:16] be dressed in the righteousness of the
[1:16:18] king
[1:16:19] praise god a bride that would uh
[1:16:22] pack extra oil and wisdom right we
[1:16:24] looked at wisdom on sunday night
[1:16:27] she'd be wise and then she would she'd
[1:16:29] be awake right she'd get woken up
[1:16:31] she'd have her lamp trim extra oil
[1:16:32] should go out to meet him
[1:16:34] because there's a wedding coming these
[1:16:38] mysteries these riddles and you gotta
[1:16:39] look at each and every one
[1:16:41] and you get one great picture praise god
[1:16:44] you get jesus christ giving his grace to
[1:16:47] the gentiles to redeem a bride
[1:16:49] before he turns back to the jews i know
[1:16:51] that simple church but that's what he
[1:16:53] was doing praise god
[1:16:54] that's what he was doing the riddles of
[1:16:56] old
[1:16:59] praise god all right almost done here
[1:17:03] so i want to make sure i read that there
[1:17:04] so everybody could see that
[1:17:07] okay now next
[1:17:11] we're we're defenders of the gospel we
[1:17:13] have to have an
[1:17:14] answer uh lydia when you're ready first
[1:17:16] peter 3 15.
[1:17:23] i think it's wrong for preachers not to
[1:17:25] answer questions unless they feel that
[1:17:27] of the holy spirit not to
[1:17:28] i mean there are some times you know uh
[1:17:32] you know jesus was silent right at his
[1:17:33] crucifixion but that was prophecy
[1:17:36] a memory silent before herod and that
[1:17:39] was prophecy
[1:17:40] as a sheep uh dumb before it cheers
[1:17:44] so there are times to be silent where
[1:17:45] you don't answer back right
[1:17:47] cast not your pearls before swine there
[1:17:49] are times you do that you don't do that
[1:17:50] rather
[1:17:52] but peter now isn't this interesting of
[1:17:56] all men
[1:17:57] peter who denied christ who couldn't
[1:17:59] give an answer
[1:18:01] once he got the holy ghost he said you
[1:18:02] need to give an answer
[1:18:05] oh glory first peter 3 15.
[1:18:08] now let's read 14 again to remember this
[1:18:11] is about suffering
[1:18:12] but and if you suffer for righteousness
[1:18:14] sake happy are ye
[1:18:15] and be not afraid of their terror
[1:18:17] neither be troubled
[1:18:18] in other words you're gonna you're gonna
[1:18:20] suffer and then people are gonna
[1:18:22] try to terrorize you so when you're
[1:18:24] getting terrorized or falsely accused
[1:18:26] verse 15 but sanctify the lord god in
[1:18:30] your heart so set aside
[1:18:31] the lord in your heart and be ready
[1:18:34] always to give an
[1:18:35] answer to every man that asketh you a
[1:18:38] reason of the hope that is in you with
[1:18:40] meekness and fear
[1:18:42] so there's going to be people that make
[1:18:44] fun of you in this case they're going to
[1:18:45] beat you
[1:18:46] they're going to put you in prison
[1:18:47] that's what he's talking about when
[1:18:49] you're suffering for god's sake
[1:18:50] he said but have have a special place in
[1:18:53] your heart for the lord
[1:18:54] and be ready you know you're getting
[1:18:57] beat for christ's sake so as you're
[1:18:58] getting accused
[1:18:59] always have an answer ready because of
[1:19:01] the hope that you have within you
[1:19:03] why would you let yourself get uh abused
[1:19:05] or beaten up or made fun of
[1:19:07] why would you let yourself get trampled
[1:19:09] on because jesus christ is our living
[1:19:11] hope praise god
[1:19:12] amen it's a new kind of hope it's a
[1:19:16] living hope the bible says
[1:19:18] in the book of hebrews i love that song
[1:19:20] too
[1:19:23] we have a hope and so peter says even if
[1:19:26] you're getting beaten up he said
[1:19:28] be ready to answer ever not some men
[1:19:31] right
[1:19:32] every man be ready to answer every man
[1:19:37] and so that's why i even admitted on the
[1:19:39] on the uh
[1:19:40] the debate i said the reason i didn't do
[1:19:42] it i said i was afraid right i said i
[1:19:44] wasn't ready to debate i didn't know the
[1:19:45] answers
[1:19:46] i said i was given all my time to study
[1:19:48] in the doctrine you know the word of god
[1:19:50] brother man's doctrines i said i didn't
[1:19:52] he had he has over 500 pages
[1:19:55] of accusations against brother branham i
[1:19:57] can't go through 500
[1:19:58] i can't go through all 500 i'll get to
[1:20:00] him as i i get to him as i feel out of
[1:20:02] the lord
[1:20:03] so i was just honest i was afraid i
[1:20:05] didn't know
[1:20:09] but as time goes on church we learn to
[1:20:11] have
[1:20:12] an answer and i do have to i'd have to
[1:20:15] correct that i did the next year i think
[1:20:16] in 2013 i made a document
[1:20:18] and i shared it with many of the
[1:20:19] brothers in pennsylvania uh because
[1:20:21] in 2013 i started my youtube channel and
[1:20:23] i started making certain videos to
[1:20:25] answer some of their
[1:20:26] false doctrines like no women angels no
[1:20:28] women preachers that was one of them
[1:20:30] and i tried to give answers for all the
[1:20:32] other beliefs that we have like long
[1:20:34] long hair long dresses and no makeup and
[1:20:37] all these
[1:20:38] and the three works of grace boy they
[1:20:39] don't like the three words of grace but
[1:20:40] we love it praise god
[1:20:42] it explains the whole bible praise god
[1:20:46] and so see church we must be ready
[1:20:48] always
[1:20:51] and what i found with with debating
[1:20:53] these these
[1:20:54] this group of people is that my regular
[1:20:57] answer is
[1:20:58] you're probably jumping to a clue
[1:20:59] conclusion you can't prove that
[1:21:03] uh and let's get back to the word
[1:21:06] because they they normally stay away
[1:21:08] from the word
[1:21:11] because they know they can't win they
[1:21:12] can't win that one
[1:21:16] the one regret i had sisters i wish i
[1:21:19] could have
[1:21:20] thought of this earlier i wish i would
[1:21:22] have just i think i said on sunday
[1:21:24] i wish i would have said show me one
[1:21:25] scripture where god ever asked the godly
[1:21:27] woman to cut
[1:21:28] her hair i said if not then that's thus
[1:21:31] saith the lord
[1:21:32] and it just so happened brother adam
[1:21:33] said that's thus saith the lord
[1:21:35] like if it's thus saith the lord nobody
[1:21:37] can stand before it
[1:21:40] if it's true then then nobody can say
[1:21:42] any word against it show me one
[1:21:43] scripture where a woman
[1:21:45] a godly woman put on paint on her face
[1:21:49] you ain't gonna find it
[1:21:52] show me one time where a man ever said
[1:21:54] you repent and you're baptized
[1:21:56] and now you're instantly filled with the
[1:21:58] holy ghost and now you never found that
[1:22:00] they had to wait
[1:22:00] they had to tarry right they had to
[1:22:02] tarry for the holy ghost you always find
[1:22:04] that
[1:22:04] you always had to wait till sometime
[1:22:06] after they believed
[1:22:08] nobody ever got it just going from a
[1:22:10] sinner to a saint
[1:22:11] not even paul paul believed and he was
[1:22:14] blind three days remember
[1:22:16] and then the bible said after that he
[1:22:17] repented and then the bible says he got
[1:22:19] baptized and then later got the holy
[1:22:21] ghost
[1:22:21] even paul so it just
[1:22:25] uh it just goes to show church that we
[1:22:27] have the word we must defend it we must
[1:22:29] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:22:31] delivered to the saints
[1:22:33] because i don't i don't know did you
[1:22:34] listen to it naomi beatrice did you
[1:22:35] listen to the debate at all okay
[1:22:36] that's fine you don't have to i'm gonna
[1:22:38] go over a little bit but they're to the
[1:22:40] spot where they don't condem
[1:22:41] they don't condemn homosexuality
[1:22:43] bestiality and they don't condemn
[1:22:45] cross-dressing
[1:22:47] transgender they don't they don't
[1:22:48] condemn any of that and i said well i'm
[1:22:49] not
[1:22:50] condemning them like to hell but i'm
[1:22:52] saying they're wrong
[1:22:53] and i'm warning them that if they don't
[1:22:55] repent they are going to suffer
[1:22:59] but their thing is oh the gospel didn't
[1:23:01] come to condemn
[1:23:03] and i said well that's true i said the
[1:23:04] gospel came to warn and i'm warning them
[1:23:07] i just wanted to hear can you say it's
[1:23:09] wrong and they wouldn't say it
[1:23:10] they wouldn't say it
[1:23:14] so what is that that's the wrong spirit
[1:23:18] see we must defend the gospel the gospel
[1:23:20] is good news but you don't know the the
[1:23:22] good news until you know the bad news
[1:23:24] that your sins are uh taking you to hell
[1:23:26] because you're in love with sin you're
[1:23:28] loved with darkness
[1:23:29] and so you don't want to be with god you
[1:23:30] want to be separated from god and so god
[1:23:32] will let you if you don't want to be in
[1:23:33] his presence he'll let you
[1:23:35] be in darkness but his grace is reaching
[1:23:37] out to pull you out of the darkness amen
[1:23:47] praise god all right let me close with
[1:23:50] this
[1:23:53] let me just read parts of my uh opening
[1:23:55] statement and then i'm
[1:23:56] going to keep listening to it and go
[1:23:57] through and pull out the things i wish i
[1:23:59] would have said
[1:24:00] because i think it'd be beneficial now
[1:24:02] church it is going to be beneficial
[1:24:03] because i know
[1:24:04] well i don't know but i was told we'll
[1:24:06] probably do more debates in the future
[1:24:08] so
[1:24:08] i want to store up answers to the things
[1:24:10] i i didn't feel like i did good on
[1:24:12] and i want to uh store them up so i have
[1:24:14] them later
[1:24:16] and i think it's a good thing to do the
[1:24:17] scripture of course tells us to do that
[1:24:20] uh to always have an answer
[1:24:23] all right so i started off just by
[1:24:25] giving god glory i'm nothing without him
[1:24:27] john 15 5. i s
[1:24:31] remember i got the questions two days
[1:24:32] before the debate
[1:24:34] the brother sent them a month but then
[1:24:36] the the moderator forgot to email them
[1:24:38] to me
[1:24:40] i should have had them a long time ago
[1:24:42] but anyways i had two days and i didn't
[1:24:44] get to study until saturday morning
[1:24:46] because i had work we're busy thursday
[1:24:48] friday it was just a really busy week
[1:24:50] last week
[1:24:51] so i basically had two days to look up i
[1:24:52] said if i don't have an answer or a
[1:24:54] question forgive me
[1:24:55] i'll do my best to follow up and i
[1:24:57] define the message the bible prophecies
[1:25:00] god is fulfilling right now i said it's
[1:25:02] heresy to make every word brother
[1:25:04] branham said thus saith the lord
[1:25:06] it is so we have to rightly divide the
[1:25:09] word of truth
[1:25:12] and we have to search the scriptures
[1:25:13] daily like acts 17 11.
[1:25:17] i shared how brother branham spearheaded
[1:25:19] the revival starting in 1946 he was the
[1:25:22] first giant of that age
[1:25:24] then i shared how god hides himself and
[1:25:27] then i shared
[1:25:27] all the thus saith the lords that we
[1:25:29] have
[1:25:30] on the 12 doctrines that are called
[1:25:32] mysteries six of them have thus saith
[1:25:34] the lord
[1:25:35] six and half of them have thus saith the
[1:25:37] lord
[1:25:38] backing them up that they are absolutely
[1:25:40] true and they didn't say one thing about
[1:25:42] any of that they didn't say one thing
[1:25:43] about
[1:25:44] the thus saith the lord mysteries and
[1:25:47] maybe we'll do that later
[1:25:51] and then i ended my 10-minute opening
[1:25:53] saying
[1:25:54] what the message has done for me because
[1:25:56] i've listened to almost all their
[1:25:57] podcasts
[1:25:58] they at the end they always ask them how
[1:26:00] do you feel now that you've left the
[1:26:02] message
[1:26:02] they say oh i'm so full of love now and
[1:26:05] i'm so free and everything
[1:26:06] how can you be free breaking the word of
[1:26:08] god
[1:26:09] i don't know and i say that love i'm not
[1:26:11] condemning them
[1:26:13] that's the point i'm making how can you
[1:26:14] be free breaking the word of god
[1:26:17] now maybe maybe they went to a really
[1:26:19] bad message church that was really in
[1:26:21] sin
[1:26:22] like that did child abuse like some of
[1:26:23] them actually left churches like that
[1:26:25] that
[1:26:25] had child abuse in the mess of churches
[1:26:27] but that's from the that's from
[1:26:28] satan that's from hell so maybe in one
[1:26:31] way yeah maybe they
[1:26:32] feel free from that that spirit of child
[1:26:34] abuse
[1:26:37] thank god but there's no way they can be
[1:26:40] totally free in the holy spirit
[1:26:42] when they're getting sprinkled and
[1:26:44] putting on men's clothing right
[1:26:47] how how how can they do that telling
[1:26:50] everybody that just says a prayer you're
[1:26:52] filled with the holy ghost and
[1:26:53] they don't even cry a tear when they
[1:26:55] when they get even say that
[1:26:57] there's there's no death right we know
[1:27:00] we're dead in
[1:27:00] sins right we're dead in sins but they
[1:27:03] have to die to the things of the world
[1:27:05] and be born again praise god and there's
[1:27:07] no happiness there's no joy
[1:27:09] when they say the holy spirit comes upon
[1:27:11] them repeat after me i'll do the romans
[1:27:13] road they say
[1:27:15] romans wrote i'm all guilty of the sins
[1:27:18] and now i'm a new
[1:27:19] new creature in christ and all these
[1:27:20] things and yet not even shed a tear not
[1:27:22] even be grateful
[1:27:23] when eternal life comes into you and you
[1:27:25] don't even feel it
[1:27:27] come on you know you have no emotion
[1:27:30] when the living god comes to dwell in
[1:27:33] your soul
[1:27:34] when you pass from death unto life and
[1:27:36] you will not come in there any
[1:27:37] condemnation on the day of judgment
[1:27:39] and you can't get happy at all
[1:27:41] something's wrong god never came
[1:27:43] they just recited a man's creed
[1:27:46] not to me church this is coming new to
[1:27:48] me this is one of the biggest sins
[1:27:51] that people that leave the message
[1:27:53] commit they get rid of the three works
[1:27:54] of grace
[1:27:56] can you imagine the evil can you imagine
[1:27:59] the judgments those preachers got to
[1:28:01] face
[1:28:02] telling children when they're eight five
[1:28:04] and six years old get baptized
[1:28:05] you're filled with the holy ghost
[1:28:09] and most will go out and smoke and drink
[1:28:12] and get right in the worldly music we've
[1:28:13] all seen it haven't we we've
[1:28:15] i saw so many my friends in high school
[1:28:18] i saw
[1:28:19] one of my closest friends or one of my
[1:28:21] the friends i most admired because he
[1:28:23] could live a denominational
[1:28:25] pentecostal life and i couldn't in our
[1:28:27] church
[1:28:28] he was so pure to god and he was i made
[1:28:31] fun of him even as a christian at times
[1:28:33] and i felt i apologize to him later
[1:28:35] but you know what church he played he
[1:28:37] played piano
[1:28:38] he was a good guy you know what happened
[1:28:41] to him he went to new york and he became
[1:28:42] a homosexual
[1:28:43] and yet their church or our my former
[1:28:46] church told him
[1:28:47] he was filled with the holy ghost now
[1:28:49] church isn't that one of the most awful
[1:28:51] crimes against christian against
[1:28:53] christianity
[1:28:55] that three works of grace is so
[1:28:56] important jesus said it's like a wheat
[1:28:58] seed right
[1:29:00] uh the tassel the i'm sorry the stalk
[1:29:02] and then the
[1:29:04] stem stock and then the corn the corn of
[1:29:06] wheat
[1:29:09] i've seen it i've seen man so many
[1:29:11] people baptize and then fall away
[1:29:12] because they tell them they got it and
[1:29:14] then they
[1:29:14] they stop hungering for god but anybody
[1:29:16] that loves god
[1:29:17] wants more of him praise god and
[1:29:20] remember the sin of this day
[1:29:22] is laodicea saying i'm i'm good i'm rich
[1:29:25] and increase the goods i don't have no
[1:29:26] more need of god
[1:29:27] but the real believer says i need him
[1:29:29] every hour praise god
[1:29:31] amen they never hunger and thirst they
[1:29:34] feel bad for their sins so they come up
[1:29:35] and get baptized
[1:29:36] and they go down a dry center come up a
[1:29:39] wet one right that's really what happens
[1:29:40] in most cases
[1:29:42] to me these three works of grace is
[1:29:44] becoming more and more important
[1:29:48] ezekiel said new heart new spirit my
[1:29:51] spirit
[1:29:52] it's all down through the scripture this
[1:29:55] is becoming one of the greatest
[1:29:57] sins i'm seeing amongst people that
[1:30:00] leave the message
[1:30:03] because now like we said these these
[1:30:05] fine people but now
[1:30:06] they're so quick to condemn brother
[1:30:08] branham they're so quick to say he's a
[1:30:11] liar he's a deceiver he's a charlatan
[1:30:13] and they mock and make fun of him and
[1:30:15] yet a
[1:30:16] united states senator who was paralyzed
[1:30:19] rose to his feet under the power of god
[1:30:21] through that man's ministry amen
[1:30:24] and they're so that's what the bible
[1:30:26] said they'll be so quick to even condemn
[1:30:28] satan though
[1:30:28] uh they'll speak evil dignitaries
[1:30:30] remember we looked at that a few weeks
[1:30:32] ago
[1:30:32] these these people that are they're lost
[1:30:35] and they're not afraid to speak evil
[1:30:37] against god's anointed
[1:30:38] when was the last time they raised up a
[1:30:40] paralyzed man out of a wheelchair
[1:30:43] i've never done that when was last time
[1:30:46] they cured tuberculosis which i met the
[1:30:48] woman who was cured of it and it's on
[1:30:49] tape
[1:30:50] the ramp told her name of jesus christ i
[1:30:52] rebuke satan go away yourself two
[1:30:53] mondays in a row and you'll see her gain
[1:30:55] weight it happened
[1:30:56] he told her the future
[1:31:00] they're so quick
[1:31:06] and so i ended that with that so they
[1:31:08] say uh they ask all these oh we're so
[1:31:10] free now we're so
[1:31:11] we're so happy and we have to worry
[1:31:13] about uh brother branham and all these
[1:31:15] things like that
[1:31:17] and i said well here let me tell you
[1:31:18] what the message has done for me
[1:31:20] [Laughter]
[1:31:24] i said it's transformed my life i said i
[1:31:27] now
[1:31:27] have a true relationship with jesus
[1:31:29] christ
[1:31:30] because i lived church i lived the
[1:31:32] church life i
[1:31:34] i went to church i tried to act good in
[1:31:36] front of the youth pastor right
[1:31:38] i tried to act good in front of the
[1:31:39] church i tried to act like i was
[1:31:41] a nice guy but i cussed and i cursed and
[1:31:44] i
[1:31:45] hated everybody and had all these i was
[1:31:47] an awful mouth
[1:31:48] cussed like a sailor
[1:31:51] and i said i know i said as soon as i
[1:31:53] was baptized in jesus christ's name
[1:31:55] i never uttered one more cuss word and
[1:31:57] that's all sister beatrice that's all
[1:31:59] that flowed out of my mouth can you
[1:32:00] imagine that
[1:32:01] thank god for his grace that's the first
[1:32:04] thing i saw go after why
[1:32:05] i cut my hair first that's the first
[1:32:07] thing that went was my hair
[1:32:09] next i got baptized and i started seeing
[1:32:12] i remember i had a voice recorder and i
[1:32:15] would say acts 2 38 and listen to it
[1:32:16] until i memorized it
[1:32:19] i was on fire
[1:32:24] i said it brought me out of my
[1:32:26] denominational creeds we believe tongues
[1:32:27] was the evidence
[1:32:29] delivered me from all my addictions the
[1:32:30] pornography the cigarettes chewing
[1:32:32] tobacco drinking alcohol
[1:32:34] idolizing sports sinful movies wwf
[1:32:37] w wrestling overeating binging on food
[1:32:42] i said it delivered me all from that and
[1:32:44] all i want to do now is i want to try to
[1:32:46] get somebody to believe jesus christ
[1:32:48] that's all i want to do now and so they
[1:32:52] couldn't say anything about that but
[1:32:54] that's okay let's say to our feet
[1:32:55] it's already 8 30. let me close with
[1:32:57] that
[1:32:58] we're proving all things by god's grace
[1:33:01] proving
[1:33:02] all things
[1:33:07] does the gospel need offended well yes
[1:33:09] jesus wants us to defend it
[1:33:11] earnestly contend for the faith
[1:33:14] that was once delivered and again i love
[1:33:18] those brothers i'm glad i got to talk to
[1:33:20] them
[1:33:22] um i want to look at that earnestly
[1:33:25] contending uh
[1:33:26] up real quick just to look at the greek
[1:33:28] here
[1:33:33] bear with me just one more scripture
[1:33:40] earnestly contend
[1:33:48] doesn't have a separate definition so i
[1:33:51] have to look it up
[1:33:53] earnestly contend for the faith once
[1:33:55] delivered to this
[1:33:57] yeah i got it but yeah thank you but i
[1:33:59] do got it i was looking for a different
[1:34:00] greek definition but it's just the same
[1:34:02] words earnestly content so i have to
[1:34:04] look it up in another
[1:34:05] concordance there
[1:34:08] how many believe we still need to fight
[1:34:09] for the faith to keep it pure
[1:34:13] to stand up for it
[1:34:16] george i don't know i don't know i don't
[1:34:19] know how it's going to go but i know
[1:34:20] there's going to be a showdown
[1:34:22] right there's going to be showdown
[1:34:24] between jesus and denominations brother
[1:34:25] braham says that before the rapture
[1:34:27] there's a showdown in elijah's day
[1:34:28] showdown in jesus day there's another
[1:34:30] showdown coming
[1:34:31] and so i feel like god is preparing us
[1:34:33] to stand up for what we believe
[1:34:36] that's what i believe
[1:34:39] and again whoever would have thought i
[1:34:40] would have been the message preacher to
[1:34:42] be the first one to stand up i'm not
[1:34:43] worthy
[1:34:44] i i listened i made so many mistakes
[1:34:47] with my words
[1:34:49] i'm not the one to do it but it had to
[1:34:51] be somebody praise god
[1:34:54] and so i feel like god is allowing us to
[1:34:58] have an understanding on how to answer
[1:34:59] these questions and to defend the
[1:35:01] message
[1:35:02] right and the messenger because i forgot
[1:35:05] that scripture
[1:35:06] paul said be not ashamed of me remember
[1:35:09] we looked at that a while ago
[1:35:10] let me pull it up here second timothy 1
[1:35:13] 8 be
[1:35:13] not thou therefore ashamed of the
[1:35:16] testimony of our lord
[1:35:18] nor of me his prisoner
[1:35:21] i'm not ashamed of brother brahm that's
[1:35:24] that's what they said
[1:35:24] they said aren't you ashamed of his
[1:35:26] credibility i said credibility
[1:35:29] this is a man that raised up a paralyzed
[1:35:31] man sounds pretty credible to me
[1:35:34] right he prayed for a woman who had
[1:35:36] tuberculosis
[1:35:37] she got healed that sounds pretty
[1:35:38] incredible to me
[1:35:40] he pointed me to the serpent seed and
[1:35:42] the water baptism in one god
[1:35:44] one person right in the bible that seems
[1:35:46] pretty credible to me
[1:35:48] but we can't get our eyes off what we're
[1:35:50] contending for we're fighting for
[1:35:52] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:35:53] saints that's what we're fighting for
[1:35:57] just like brother bram's life yeah you
[1:35:58] can find mistakes just like you'd find
[1:36:00] in mine
[1:36:02] but that's not what we're fighting for
[1:36:04] there's going to be no boasting on the
[1:36:06] day of judgment well i
[1:36:07] i never exaggerated can you imagine
[1:36:09] these people
[1:36:11] bastion brother branham for just
[1:36:12] exaggerating well what
[1:36:14] they've cruci they've killed people with
[1:36:16] their words right they've killed their
[1:36:18] uh killed their influence which is
[1:36:21] the same as murder so we're not
[1:36:25] contending for our faith we're
[1:36:27] contending for the faith of christ
[1:36:29] praise god i want to start preaching on
[1:36:32] this so i don't leave it out
[1:36:34] i don't i don't want to go too far
[1:36:35] without going through it let's have a
[1:36:36] word of prayer here tonight
