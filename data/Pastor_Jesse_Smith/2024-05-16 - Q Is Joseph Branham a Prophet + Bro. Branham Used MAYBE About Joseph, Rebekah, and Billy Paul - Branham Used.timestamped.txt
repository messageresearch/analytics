[0:03] somehow I was inspired to say Joseph
[0:07] Thou Art God's prophet and maybe when I
[0:11] leave I pray that and maybe when I leave
[0:15] I pray that a double potion of the
[0:18] spirit will come upon
[0:21] Joseph greetings friends in the
[0:24] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:26] the purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:28] viewer's question about Joseph brandham
[0:32] and so by God's help I'll try to do that
[0:33] in this video by the grace of our Lord
[0:36] hi friends my name is Jesse Smith I'm
[0:38] Pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here
[0:39] in akan Ohio USA for about the last 18
[0:43] years or so and I defend the Gospel of
[0:45] Jesus Christ that he revealed to his
[0:47] true servant the late William brandham
[0:49] God's true prophet he lived 1909 to
[0:53] 1965 and also defend The Godly character
[0:56] of God's Prophet brother William brandom
[0:59] so after getting this question this week
[1:01] I thought I'd make a short video
[1:03] answering the viewer's question
[1:04] referencing my previous video addressing
[1:07] the question of is Joseph brandom a
[1:10] prophet and of course I don't believe he
[1:12] is so getting back to the viewer's
[1:14] question he said Shalom My Precious
[1:16] brother I hope this email finds you well
[1:18] I received several questions from my
[1:19] sister in the Lord she was asking me if
[1:21] Brother Joseph is a prophet so I said no
[1:24] however she showed me where brother
[1:25] brandham was saying Joseph thou art a
[1:27] prophet she even thinks Brother Joseph
[1:30] is a type of Joshua for our days
[1:33] therefore I need a Clarity with regard
[1:37] to that may you please find the attached
[1:39] document my precious brother end quote
[1:42] so this is a two-part question so I'll
[1:44] do my best by God's grace to briefly
[1:45] answer this the first question is Joseph
[1:49] brandham a prophet because of this quote
[1:50] from brother brandham so I'll play the
[1:52] quote from Brother brandham of course
[1:54] I'm familiar with it it's from thirsting
[1:56] for Life July 28th 57 brother Brandon
[2:00] said somehow I was inspired to say
[2:01] Joseph Thou Art God's prophet and maybe
[2:04] when I leave I pray a double portion of
[2:06] the spirit will come upon Joseph for the
[2:07] age to come if there is one let's listen
[2:10] to the quote in the dedication of the
[2:13] little boy at the altar somehow I was
[2:18] inspired to say Joseph Thou Art God's
[2:23] prophet and maybe when I leave I pray
[2:28] that a double potion of the spirit will
[2:31] come upon
[2:32] Joseph for the age to come if there is
[2:36] one so again friends I'm very familiar
[2:38] with this quote notice first brother BR
[2:40] said I was inspired to say Joseph Thou
[2:43] Art God's Prophet but again there's no
[2:45] thus sayith the Lord's statement
[2:47] remember friends brother Ram told us to
[2:48] be very careful how we listen to him he
[2:50] said if there's anything from the Lord
[2:52] it will speak it thus sayth the Lord so
[2:55] in this quote there is no thus sayith
[2:56] the Lord of course I'm taking that from
[2:58] he cares you care 1963 let's listen to
[3:01] the
[3:02] quote
[3:04] now see I always asked you to be careful
[3:09] what you're listening to see there's so
[3:12] much of it that it's just the human side
[3:15] but always if there is something that
[3:18] goes forth it will speak it it's thus
[3:21] sayeth the Lord even to Visions or
[3:25] anything and that's the reason I say
[3:27] that not that there is any uh any
[3:30] prophecy concerning it I have nothing on
[3:32] it from the Lord and be sure now if I
[3:35] say anything from the Lord like that to
[3:37] tell you it's always I'm speaking now
[3:40] but when he speaks I say it's not me
[3:42] it's thus sayeth the Lord and I can't
[3:45] say it until he tells me I could be
[3:47] altogether wrong in my thought about
[3:48] Martin Luther King I don't know I can't
[3:51] say that's just my opinion so that's the
[3:54] first point there's no thus sayith the
[3:56] Lord in this 1957 quote so we cannot
[3:59] make it thus sayith the Lord remember
[4:02] brother Ram said in the church age book
[4:03] he had divine inspiration that 1977
[4:06] ought to terminate the world's systems
[4:08] and of course that did not happen he
[4:10] said so I repeat I sincerely believe and
[4:12] maintain as a private student of the
[4:13] word along with divine inspiration that
[4:15] 1977 ought to terminate the world
[4:17] systems and Usher in the Millennium and
[4:20] friends I have a whole subject on the
[4:21] 1977 topic so please watch that if you
[4:24] have questions about that I'll leave a
[4:26] link in the description brother Brandon
[4:28] was calculating dates
[4:30] regarding Abraham and also the church
[4:34] ages and how much time the church ages
[4:37] had compared to the time the Jews had
[4:39] with God's spirit or being grafted into
[4:42] the holy tree As Romans 11 talks about
[4:45] and brother random said both of those
[4:47] numbers equal 1977 but of course he did
[4:51] not say thus sayith the Lord so he was
[4:52] just trying to be a student of the word
[4:55] of God he was just trying to have an
[4:57] understanding of when the end time might
[5:00] be and notice again he said with divine
[5:02] inspiration so just like brother Ram
[5:04] said inspiration with Joseph without a
[5:06] prophet here with 1977 he says divine
[5:11] inspiration so it's clear brother bandam
[5:13] thought he simply just thought he was
[5:16] inspired by the Holy Spirit but it
[5:18] wasn't it was just his own human thought
[5:20] and the reason we know that is because
[5:22] brother Ram said if it's from God it
[5:23] will say thus sayith the Lord and this
[5:26] also brings out the idea that any
[5:29] believer myself or you or anyone we're
[5:33] trying to understand what is the mind of
[5:34] the Holy Spirit and sometimes we might
[5:36] think we're inspired of the Holy Spirit
[5:38] when we when we're not actually inspired
[5:40] of the Holy Spirit and of course God
[5:42] will forgive us if we think we're
[5:44] inspired of the right thing but we're
[5:45] not as long as we don't say thus sayith
[5:48] the Lord as long as we don't say
[5:50] something false in the name of the Lord
[5:52] this reminded me of the quote from Souls
[5:54] that are in prisoned now November 10th
[5:56] morning 1963 brother Ram said a sister
[6:00] had a dream that he was going to get
[6:02] shot getting out of his car going into a
[6:05] meeting he said the woman's dream said
[6:07] then the spirit said so he's speaking
[6:09] about the Holy Spirit then the holy
[6:11] spirit said not at this time but it'll
[6:12] come later uh-huh so brother brandom
[6:15] agreed with the sister's dream he said
[6:17] uh-huh God forbid that I compromise on
[6:19] anything so here's another example where
[6:22] brother Ram thought the Holy Spirit was
[6:24] telling him something so it's the same
[6:26] idea as him saying well I felt inspired
[6:28] to do this I felt inspired about 1977 I
[6:31] felt inspired about Joseph being a
[6:34] prophet and so we can rest assured
[6:36] brother brandham did not say thus sayith
[6:38] the Lord about Joseph he did not say
[6:40] thus sayith the Lord about 1977 and he
[6:42] did not say thus sayith the Lord about
[6:43] this sister's dream about him being shot
[6:46] and killed going into a meeting some
[6:49] sister just had a dream she sent it to
[6:52] me and said I seen him that church fixed
[6:55] the way go to kill me secretly sometime
[6:58] I'm getting out of my car going in be
[6:59] fired but said then the spirit said not
[7:02] at this time but it'll come
[7:03] later amen God forbid that I compromise
[7:07] on anything I know nothing but Jesus
[7:10] Christ and him
[7:11] crucified the next point is that brother
[7:13] brand said the word maybe if you look at
[7:15] that quote again brother Bram said
[7:17] Joseph thou are God's prophet and maybe
[7:19] when I leave so notice the emphasis
[7:22] brother says is maybe this isn't a thus
[7:24] sayith the lord it's a maybe and the
[7:26] reason that word maybe is so important
[7:28] as you probably know know is that
[7:30] brother Ram said the same thing about
[7:32] Billy Paul and Rebecca in 1951 brother
[7:35] Ram said maybe my little boy would be
[7:38] fully a prophet sent from God so notice
[7:40] again just like Joseph brother BR was
[7:44] hoping Joseph would be a prophet brother
[7:45] Bram hoped Billy Paul would be a prophet
[7:48] but of course neither one are prophets
[7:50] let's listen to the quote And then
[7:53] trying to keep myself from sin at that
[7:55] time as much as a new how I thought
[7:56] maybe God would let my children
[7:59] come in to the blessing the full
[8:01] blessing and maybe my little boy would
[8:03] fully be a prophet sent from God I pray
[8:07] to that and next this is in March
[8:10] 1957 brother randam thought Rebecca
[8:13] would take his place seeing visions but
[8:16] notice he used the word maybe again
[8:19] brother R was telling the story of the
[8:21] posum that got healed through his prayer
[8:23] to the Lord Jesus and he said the next
[8:26] morning early I went out and as I
[8:27] started out little Rebecca who I believe
[8:30] is going to maybe take my place someday
[8:33] she's seen her first Vision just
[8:35] recently so friends it's undeniable
[8:37] brother random used the word maybe with
[8:39] Billy Paul Rebecca and Joseph and so all
[8:43] three of them were not prophets brother
[8:45] Rand was just hoping they would see
[8:46] visions and have a Ministry like his but
[8:49] of course brother Ram did not support
[8:50] women preachers let's listen to this
[8:52] maybe quote about
[8:53] Rebecca all night long I couldn't get
[8:57] that POS off my mind the next morning
[9:00] early I went out and as I started out
[9:03] little
[9:04] Rebecca who I believe is going to maybe
[9:07] take my place someday she see her first
[9:10] Vision just
[9:12] recently one more thing I want to say
[9:14] about this first part of this question
[9:16] is my video on Joseph bradam shows he
[9:20] doesn't meet the Bible requirements for
[9:22] a prophet and on that video I show there
[9:25] six qualifications at least for a
[9:27] genuine profit brother Brandon meets all
[9:29] six requirements but Joseph brandham
[9:32] only meets three of them and one of them
[9:34] is questionable it seems like Joseph
[9:37] does live a holy life I don't know
[9:39] though but he fails the second
[9:41] requirement teaching the word of God in
[9:43] Purity I have videoos showing over 24
[9:46] false doctrines coming out of Brenham
[9:48] Tabernacle which Joseph Brenham doesn't
[9:51] repent of so I'll leave a link to those
[9:54] videos and a playlist in the description
[9:56] by God's grace the third require having
[9:59] converts and fruits of his ministry it
[10:02] seems Joseph meets that if they're
[10:03] genuinely saved people I don't know I
[10:05] don't believe his converts can have the
[10:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost and propagate
[10:09] and believe so many false doctrines and
[10:11] lies that's just my humble opinion
[10:13] though I'm not the judge only Jesus
[10:15] Christ can judge but Jesus said by their
[10:17] fruits they are known the fourth
[10:20] requirement is reveal Secrets according
[10:21] to Amos 3:7 Joseph brandham has not
[10:24] revealed any Bible Secrets only his
[10:26] father has done that especially with the
[10:27] revelation of the Seven Seals and of
[10:29] course the 12 New Testament Mysteries
[10:32] the fifth requirement is anointing for
[10:33] Supernatural Works uh Joseph may have
[10:36] fulfilled this there's people that have
[10:39] testimonies about him praying for the
[10:40] sick maybe even raising the dead so
[10:43] that's possible I don't know but I
[10:45] wasn't there and sixth and finally you
[10:48] have to foretell of the future in the
[10:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother R
[10:51] has at least six prophecies that came to
[10:53] pass Joseph has none as far as I know
[10:56] I've sat down and talked with two of
[10:58] Joseph bram's childhood friends and
[11:00] neither have ever heard him say thus
[11:02] sayith the Lord with it coming to pass
[11:05] now on my video series about Joseph I
[11:07] show him using thus sayith the Lord once
[11:09] he said thus sayith the Lord their
[11:11] church was in the perfect will of God I
[11:13] humbly disagree there's no way their
[11:15] church can be in the perfect will of God
[11:18] and change the fivefold ministry and add
[11:20] so many false doctrines to Paul's gospel
[11:23] so I personally believe Joseph would be
[11:25] a false prophet if he's considered a
[11:27] prophet at all but he did use the name
[11:30] of the Lord in that quote so that's why
[11:32] I think he's a false prophet let's
[11:34] listen to that false prophecy I've
[11:37] returned from Arizona with the word of
[11:39] the Lord for
[11:48] us keep playing the tapes
[11:54] [Applause]
[12:11] prise name
[12:13] [Applause]
[12:18] Jesus prise the
[12:22] [Applause]
[12:25] Lord he man you are in my perfect
[12:30] will keep playing those
[12:33] tapes I'm Coming For You
[12:36] [Music]
[12:37] [Applause]
[12:51] hey we all want to be in his perfect
[12:54] will as sure as I'm sitting here when he
[12:56] spoke to me he said keep playing the
[12:59] tapes you're in my will I know this is
[13:02] it is thus sayith the Lord it
[13:08] [Applause]
[13:10] is
[13:12] [Applause]
[13:18] [Music]
[13:20] [Applause]
[13:23] amen now the second part of the question
[13:25] is Joseph brandham an anti-tip of Joshua
[13:30] of the Old Testament of course my answer
[13:32] is no of course Joshua from the Old
[13:35] Testament took God's people into the
[13:36] promised land it was the third work of
[13:38] Grace they had to leave Egypt they had
[13:41] to get through the Wilderness and then
[13:42] they had take the promised land I
[13:44] believe those three steps are
[13:45] justification sanctification baptism of
[13:47] the Holy Ghost for the New Testament
[13:49] Joseph brandham does not take anybody as
[13:51] far as I know into the baptism of the
[13:53] Holy Ghost again because of all the
[13:55] false doctrines all the times they break
[13:57] Paul's gospel through their man-made
[13:59] Creeds and false doctrines so I
[14:02] personally do not see any similarities
[14:04] between Brother Joseph brandham and
[14:06] Joshua of the Old
[14:08] Testament as many of you might know
[14:10] brother Ram talked about how his
[14:12] ministry typed Joshua and the Believers
[14:15] following him typed Caleb he talked
[14:17] about that in spoken word Original Seed
[14:18] and also that same portion was put in
[14:20] the church age book chapter 5 perriam
[14:23] and church age brother Bram said now let
[14:24] us stand like Joshua and Caleb our
[14:27] promised land is coming in sight even as
[14:28] theirs now Joshua means Jehovah Savior
[14:31] and he represents the end time leader
[14:32] that will come to the church even as
[14:34] Paul came as the original leader Caleb
[14:36] represents those that stayed true with
[14:38] Joshua so clearly the holy spirit is
[14:41] telling us that brother bram's Ministry
[14:43] typed Joshua spiritually Joseph
[14:46] branham's Ministry does not fulfill
[14:48] Joshua's Ministry in type Joseph
[14:51] brandham cannot type Joshua because he
[14:53] leads people out of gathering more as we
[14:56] see that day approaching rather than
[14:58] Gathering more as we see that day
[15:00] approaching Joseph brandham leads people
[15:02] into worshiping tape saying every word
[15:04] on tape is thus sayith the Lord he says
[15:07] that you have to
[15:09] realize that brother every Brother
[15:12] Joseph believes everything that brother
[15:14] brandom says is the
[15:21] Lord amen am I believe everything BR
[15:25] says thus sayth the Lord
[15:29] of course there are so many more false
[15:30] doctrines there's at least 22 more false
[15:34] doctrines in
[15:36] closing friends I hope this video was
[15:38] helpful by God's grace I thought I'd
[15:39] revisit it here in
[15:41] 2024 that original video about is Joseph
[15:44] brandom a prophet is from 2020 so it's
[15:47] been over four years since I've answered
[15:49] this question so hope it was a help by
[15:51] the grace of our Lord friends remember
[15:53] brother Ram said the most important
[15:55] thing of our day is a preacher who can
[15:57] rightly divide the word of God and I'm
[15:59] not just talking about myself I'm
[16:00] talking about all the Holy Ghost filled
[16:02] preachers who are rightly dividing the
[16:04] word of God giving the true
[16:06] interpretation of the scripture by the
[16:08] holy ghost that Jesus Christ revealed to
[16:10] brother brandham and also understanding
[16:12] brother bram's quotes now to bring up
[16:16] this faith in Christ there's
[16:19] ministers that's the most important
[16:21] thing of the day is a good god-sent
[16:25] preacher I admire them and they're G
[16:28] gift is far beyond anything could be
[16:31] done in anything else is a preacher a
[16:34] man who knows how to rightly divide the
[16:35] word of God it's a sin it's heresy to
[16:39] say every word on tape is thus sayi the
[16:41] Lord Brother R said there's mixups on
[16:44] the tapes in questions and answers 1964
[16:47] and he said those four beautiful words
[16:49] if there's any questions he said look in
[16:51] the Bible he said especially for
[16:53] ministers let's listen to those
[16:55] quotes the other day I got something
[16:57] mixed up I happened to hear it it's I
[16:59] caught it right there and it's on the
[17:00] tape and I I probably hear from it when
[17:02] I was talking about the seven trumpets I
[17:04] said it was seven trumpets I was
[17:06] referring to the Pentecostal Feast from
[17:08] the Pentecostal Feast until the seven uh
[17:11] until the um the trumpets there was
[17:15] seven sabbaths oh was a great teaching
[17:17] there I didn't touch the edge of it but
[17:20] if you happen to catch that on your tape
[17:21] remember look in the Bible you see it's
[17:23] seven months after that count off seven
[17:26] months January February March April May
[17:28] June July it' be July 7even months which
[17:30] represents the full seven Church ages so
[17:33] we're grateful to stand with God's true
[17:35] Prophet brother William brandham and of
[17:37] course we pray for his son Joseph
[17:39] brandham that he'll repent of all these
[17:41] false teachings coming out of brandham
[17:42] Tabernacle father God we ask in Jesus
[17:45] Christ's name you'll help our dear
[17:46] brother Joseph Lord to repent of these
[17:48] false teachings that are coming out of
[17:50] brandom Tabernacle Lord I pray he would
[17:52] humble himself to the word of God and
[17:54] accept the truth of Thy word dear Lord
[17:57] give an honest heart Lord God give him
[18:00] the isav of the holy spirit that he
[18:02] might see the word of God in its Purity
[18:05] he might recognize the truth on his 24
[18:08] false teachings that are coming out of
[18:10] his church let his spiritual eyesight be
[18:12] enlightened by the grace of God that
[18:15] he'll repent of these 24 false doctrines
[18:18] and serve you with a pure heart father
[18:21] we know all things are possible to them
[18:22] that believe that's why we ask that's
[18:23] why we pray for our dear brothers and
[18:26] friends and false Doctrine I pray you
[18:28] deliver him help him in Jesus Christ's
[18:30] name
[18:32] amen if you have any questions concerns
[18:34] or testimonies about this video please
[18:36] contact
[18:37] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[18:40] the desire of your heart
