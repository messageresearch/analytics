TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's just me and read [Music] and yes [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show the 13th and likely most serious and dangerous lie coming out of Branham Tabernacle located in Jeffersonville Indiana USA for the sake of conserving time I'm not going to review the previous 12 lies as it seems this video will be a long one so the 13th out of a list of over 24 lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle is Brenham Tabernacle leadership has said with thus saith the Lord they are in the perfect will of God by playing the tapes let's listen to the quote from March 11 2018 and you'll hear the pastor of Brenham Tabernacle say it's a word from the Lord and then say it's thus saith the Lord he says it twice in this preliminary speech Let's listen to the LIE [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Applause] amen you are in my perfect will playing those tapes I'm coming for you [Music] [Applause] we all want to be in his perfect will he's sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know [Music] that amen praise the name of the Lord [Applause] friends I want to humbly say that I cannot see under any circumstances how this statement with us saith the Lord is actually from the Lord Jesus Christ first of all this would be a very unusual thing for the Lord to say since the Lord never said those words through his Prophet brother Branham with us saith the Lord nor did the Lord write those words in the Bible the Bible never says to the laodicean church age Believers that they are to silence and decrease the five-fold ministry decrease living preachers and increase a dead preacher a preacher who's passed on second friends how can Branham Tabernacle be in the perfect will of God when they're breaking so many words of God in the Bible how can you be in the perfect will of God when you're breaking Paul's Revelations which were the perfect will of God from the Lord Jesus Christ himself and third Branham Tabernacles already lied 12 times this is the 13th lie and there's at least 11 more lies to go they have a sad strong delusional pattern of constantly adding to the Bible and taking away from the Bible friends how can the Holy Spirit tell this group of people that they're in his perfect will when they've already broken the will of the Holy Spirit as revealed in the Holy Bible the broken God's will in Ephesians 4 8-16 by decreasing living preachers they broke in Hebrews 10 24 and 25 by not physically gathering together more as they see the day approaching they're literally idolizing the tapes of brother Branham by making every word on tape thus saith the Lord and I do want to share this quote from the pastor Branham Tabernacle on his blog post from April 10 2021 he said quote the tapes can never be wrong end quote this is complete idolatry friends I have over 80 almost 90 examples of how there's mistakes on brother Branch tapes which he told us there were brother Ram said he was not infallible brother Brandon said there's Mix-Ups on the tapes so Brenham Tabernacle has proven themselves untrue to the original word of God that Jesus Christ revealed to Saint Paul a few other scriptures they've broken is numbers 27 12-23 where God told Moses to set a man over the congregation because Moses was going to die and yet Branham Tabernacle calls brother Branham their pastor but he can't be because he's dead because of this they also break Joshua chapter 1 verses 1 and 2 where the Lord spoke unto Joshua and said Moses my servant is dead if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then Jesus Christ would tell the church brother Branham my servant my Prophet is dead and now I'm going to continue to lead my church by the fivefold ministry through the anointing of the Holy Ghost random Tabernacles also breaking second Timothy 4 2 where Paul told preachers preach the word Paul didn't say play the tape or sit down and press play random Tabernacles also breaking Romans 10 13-15 how beautiful are the feet of them who publish good news how can they hear except they hear a preacher and how can they preach except they be sent God is always called living men to preach God's Living Word Branham Tabernacle also breaks second Timothy 2 verse 2. Paul told Timothy commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also not Faithful Men Who would be able to press play also Joshua chapter 2 has been completely changed by Branham Tabernacle it's the story of Rahab receiving the two spies and today Branham Tabernacle says that's the true model for the fivefold ministry today Rahab is the bride and the two spies are the Tate boys the true faithful ministry as Branham Tabernacle and their leadership has already stated and have already put it on videos for everyone to see but of course that's a lie if you look in context the two spies were not part of the priesthood the teaching and preaching priesthood the aaronic priesthood so Branham Tabernacle is breaking the type of Joshua chapter 2. those two spies had to be in submission to the priesthood that God had already ordained through the prophet Moses the same is true today any Tate boy has to be in obedience to Paul's gospel and Paul's gospel in Ephesians 4 11 sets the fivefold ministry as God's dress wear as brother Brandon said as God's leadership and they lead by the word of God through the anointing of the Holy Ghost another verse Branham Tabernacle denies is first Timothy 4 verse 14 which says neglect not the gift that is in thee and of course when Branham Tabernacle says tapes are number one put brother Branham back in the Pulpit it automatically leads to preachers neglecting their gifts and that of course is a sin and this verse ties in with Matthew 25 verse 25 in Jesus's parable of the five talents it says and I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth and lo there thou Hast that is thine so in this Parable the one talented man buried his talent and did not use it that's exactly what Branham Tabernacle is encouraging preachers to do bury their talents don't use their talents as much as they could do not invest in them just press play and obey so these are just a few of the scriptures Branham Tabernacles breaking and yet they're claiming to be in the perfect will of God so friends we'd have to throw out all these verses and More in order to make Brenham Tabernacles pastors thus saith the Lord's statement true how sad and how strong is the strong delusion that is upon Branham Tabernacle and all those who follow their man-made Creeds and instructions friends I do believe humbly that this statement from Branham tabernacle's Pastor makes this pastor a false prophet because he's spoken something in the name of the Lord that is wrong and hasn't repented of it here it's been over five years and the pastor still has not repented of this thus saith the Lord's statement that again breaks all these verses I've just covered and more now I'd like to go through about 21 quotes from Brother Branham and show how Brenham Tabernacle is denying them based upon this thus saith the Lord's statement that they're in the perfect will of God the first three quotes are about how Paul's gospel revealed in the Bible cannot change and we'll play these quotes back to back Branham Tabernacles pastor and then God's true Prophet brother William Branham and show how the current Branham Tabernacle Pastor is contradicting his father the first quote is from God's provided way of healing 1954. brother Branham says God's word cannot alter it does not change Paul said anyone who changed anything taught in scripture would be accursed and brother Brandon said I'm a fundamental believer in the Bible he's ready to hang his soul on any phase of the Bible any sentence and brother random is right brother Branham was a Fundamental Bible believer and the current Brenham Tabernacle leadership is not simply put random Tabernacles currently changing Ephesians 4 11 so they are not Fundamental Bible Believers let's listen to the quotes back to back [Music] you are in my perfect will keep playing those tapes we all want to be in his perfect will he sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is the saith the Lord it is what makes us America but I believe that whatever God has said his word does not change one one I believe [Music] it would come and teach any other thing that thing that let him be unto you a curse Galatians 1 8 so I am a fundamental believer in the Bible what the Bible says I have truth and in any phase Bible or any any sentence comma whatever it might be that God's word is Everlasting true the second quote is from the sardisian church age 1960 brother Brandon said any other kind of Doctrine other than what Paul said is wrong and brother Branham warns that Jesus will take his part out of the book of life when they take out part of Paul's gospel so again the fact that Branham Tabernacle is changing the fivefold ministry is extremely dangerous Paul taught the five-fold ministry would continue unchanged until we all come in the unity of the faith where did Paul teach the tape Church idolatry that's going on today he never did let's listen to the quotes back to back I've returned from Arizona with the word of the Lord for us keep playing [Applause] like well playing those tapes we all want to be in his perfect will it sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is the saith Lord it is yeah the bag was correct amen I love this third quote from the church age book page 83 or other random quotes Galatians 1 verse 8 any other gospel other than Paul's is cursed brother Ram said the original word could not change not even a DOT or dash of it well the random said God's word can't change brother Ram said the Ephesians look those false Apostles of the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said get back to the word and that's what I'm doing on these videos other men of God are doing behind their pulpits we're looking message Believers in the eyes and saying get back to the word of God get back to the true five-fold Ministry not the tape Church movement that's a movement of idolatry of brother Branham and his tapes brother random said his ministry a prophet to the laodocene church age would be known that he's the real one sent from God because he would be in the word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota and then he said get back to the word or you are lost and again when did Paul ever say the fivefold ministry is going to end preachers need to sit down and put the dead Prophet back in the pulpit and living men should stop preaching God's Living Word Of course Paul never taught that so we know Branham Tabernacle is wrong let's listen to the quotes back to back I've returned from Arizona with the word of the Lord for us keep playing the games you are in my perfect will playing those tapes we all want to be in his perfect will it sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is the saith Lord it is here it is in Galatians 1 8. though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be accursed it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a DOT or dash of it Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said even if I come and try to give a second Revelation try to make one little change in what I gave originally let me be accursed you see Paul knew that first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation than a second revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the same Bloodlines in David but it was the same Revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it but God's word can't change it came exactly as revealed Hallelujah and see what those false apostles were doing they came with their own word those Ephesians knew that word as Paul had taught it they were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands they looked those false Apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you are therefore false oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you that really tries the Apostle and prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them one of these days there is going to come a prophet to the laodicean church age and you will know if he is the real one sent from God or not yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota in that last stage when there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they keep telling you that if you don't believe them and what they say you will be lost but when that last day Prophet comes on the scene if he is truly that prophet he will be crying out get back to the word or you are lost he won't build on a private Revelation or interpretation but on the word amen and amen next I want to look at two quotes about the perfect will of God remember Romans 12 1-2 states that we can prove the perfect will of God and of course how is it proven by the word of God 's perfect will is proven by Paul's unchanging gospel remember Paul said all men would be judged by his gospel Romans 2 verse 16 and Galatians 1 6-12 random Tabernacles pastor and their Church cannot change Paul's gospel the first quote is from the church age book page 368 chapter 10 and this quote shows how Balaam didn't want the perfect will of God so God gave him the permissive will of God well the ram said did God change his mind no sir so I believe this is what likely has happened at Branham Tabernacle Branham Tabernacle did not want the perfect will of God the fightful ministry preaching by the Holy Ghost so God gave them his permissive will and remember friends brother Branham said every man needs a home Church a living Pastor a post of Duty and Branham Tabernacle has none of these they don't go to church physically they just play tapes in their homes they claim a dead man brother Brenham is their real pastor and they're not at their posted Duty amongst the Believers they have no post of Duty let's listen to the quotes back to back learn from Arizona with the word of the Lord for us keep playing the game you are in my perfect will keep playing those tapes we all want to be in his perfect will it sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is the saith Lord it is that he was not a true word Prophet for when God told him not to go to honor balak with his presence he sought to go anyway for he was motivated by his Lust For Gold and prestige so God let him go the perfect will of God gave way to the permissive will of God because of the heart desire of Balaam God actually said go ahead did God change his mind no sir God had his way regardless of Balaam going Balaam did not know the will of God God had his way regardless it was Balaam who was the loser for he bypassed the word the second quote about the perfect Wills from the choosing of a bride I love this story brother Branham says he talked to a woman who was a preacher and brother Branham said I don't doubt that one bit that God called the woman to preach now that may surprise us but in the context brother I am saying the woman preacher is just like Balaam but Alum didn't want the perfect will so God told him to do the permissive will brother Graham says that's what's happened to the woman preacher she didn't want the perfect will of God that she shouldn't preach so God gave her the permissible will of God that she could preach and I believe this applies perfectly to this video and the thus saith the Lord's statement that Branham Tabernacle is in the perfect will of God by just pressing play God's original word from the Bible cannot be denied and I don't doubt one bit that the Lord may have told random Tabernacles Pastor they're in his will but it cannot be the perfect will of God because the Bible never says press play and obey the Bible never says limit the fivefold ministry the Bible never says stay at home and don't physically attend church the Bible never says the seventh Church age messenger would have no mistakes in any of his words on tape so friends God may be permitting them to play tapes but it's not according to his original will unless Us in the quotes back to back foreign [Music] with the word of the Lord for us [Music] will playing those tapes we all want to be in his perfect will as sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is the saith Lord it is I know sisters many of you say the Lord called me to preach I'm not going to argue with you but I will tell you the woman says you not to do it she shall not teach or serve any Authority but the pain sounds when you say the Lord told me to do it I don't doubt that one bit did you hear my message God might permit you to preach I don't say anything but it's not according to his original word and plan therefore she's not supposed to do now I want to do about 16 quotes brother random makes about the fivefold ministry the first quote is from what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith from 1960 where Lorena mentions the five-fold ministry and he says those gifts keep the church perfected and clean and ready for the coming of the Lord so the fact that Branham Tabernacle is deleting these five-fold living preachers that shows they are unclean and not ready for the coming of the Lord according to this quote from Brother Branham let's listen to the quotes back to back I've returned from Arizona with the word of the Lord for us [Music] [Applause] well playing those tapes we all want to be in his perfect will as sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is the saith Lord it is [Laughter] [Applause] of an hour the second quote is from things that are to be 1965. brother random said these pastors and young men would sweep the people onto the coming of the Lord Brother Brown never said that Tate boys would sweep the people onto the coming of the Lord let's listen to the quotes back to back [Music] [Applause] keep playing those tapes we all want to be in his perfect will as sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will it is I am very thankful for these open doors that have had to go into and the inspiration that's causing cause that know that my days are numbered and know what now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come and my generation the third quote is from the Samaritan Church age book brother random said Cora in type said the fivefold ministry failed and then he says the cores of today have The Prestige of money social leadership business ability and friends that's exactly what's going on in Branham Tabernacle they have Prestige of millions of dollars over a hundred million dollars and yes they can do a good Tate business they make quality products but that does not qualify them to lead the Bride of Jesus Christ Paul said in Ephesians 4 8-16 the fifo ministry the living preachers with five preaching gifts lead the church let's listen to the quotes back to back [Music] in my perfect will keep playing those tapes we all want to be in this perfect will it sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is [Music] if you don't think this is true just listen to this all over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing the businessmen they have invaded the pulpit without a call from God they have styled themselves the Fishers of Men and the founders of a move of God and they say the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4 10-13 God gave the church has failed so they are taking over here we are right in the midst of the Fulfillment of Prophecy called the gain things of Korah and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth may God have pity on them may their eyes be opened before it is too late oh listen to me when did The Prestige of money social leadership business ability or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man for Spiritual leadership or give any weight to the word of God and when in any way materiality or human values begin to show as the media by which God works instead of the Holy Spirit alone then we are fighting against God not for him the third quote is from questions and answers on the seal 63 the ask brother random should evangelists continue on the field brother Ram said of course he said don't change a thing and of course random Tabernacle has changed evangelism and now they say here's a tablet or here's some tapes just press play and Obey Don't Preach so brother Graham said don't change a thing and Bradham Tabernacle has changed many things let's listen to the quotes [Music] you are in my perfect will keep playing those tapes we all want to be in his perfect will as sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is [Music] your evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change a thing the fourth quote is from questions answers on the seals again 63 they asked brother Branham with the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture brother random says it's the fivefold ministry he never says they're to press play and Obey he never says the fivefold ministry is tape boys he never says the fivefold Ministries the two spies from Joshua too let's listen to the quotes [Music] [Applause] every 12 . keep playing those tapes we all want to be in his perfect will as sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is [Applause] [Music] worth the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now okay the bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour amen the bride of Christ sure she's consisted of Apostles prophets teachers vastness and pastors is that right that's a bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great Ministries the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble a fourth quote is from questions and answers for 1964. brother Brandon was asked would we still be on fire and preach the gospel he says keep preaching as hard as you can preach Brothers stay with him right behind you brother Branham never said there's going to come a time when you're not going to need to preach and then you can just press play and Obey you can just sit down and press play Let's listen to the quote is the time over no keep preaching just as hard as you can preach brother stay with it I'm right behind you the eighth quote is from perseverance 62 brother Brandon mentions the fivefold ministry and he said will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord so we know Ephesians 4 11 is going to work right up to the Rapture brother I'm never said well it'll work up right towards the end and then we'll do a tate Ministry where just I'll preach and everybody else can sit down and obey me and my tapes let's listen to the quotes I believe that there's a church coming into that perfection that Ministry of profession hear the offices who are impossible [Music] Anthony of the church that pastors and teachers and so forth to be so with the world until the whole thing will work right up through the coming of them I believe that now we were nearing that that I believe so the next quote is from Behold a greater than Solomon is here in 1962 brother random mentions the five full ministry and he says the teachers and the pastors and evangelists they're the ones who brings the word so that's what's going on today amongst the true bride of Christ the fivefold ministry preachers are bringing the word brother man never said right before Jesus returns the fifo ministry will sit down they won't bring the word and everybody will sit down and just press play let's listen to the quotes [Music] are the perfecting and now they are teachers and that pastors and advantages they're the one who brings the word and the prophets are to combing those little corners of for individuals you see them fourtail pains it's coming and so forth the 10th quote is from Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1962. brother Brown lists the five full ministry he says they keep the church in order they perfect the church he said no matter how much these men here are gifted to preach you've got to also believe what they preach or it isn't going to do one good notice brother Branham never said well this is all going to change and later on you all you all have to listen to my tapes that will do you good and then the five-fold ministry living preachers they will do you no good anymore so it's sad right on Tabernacles followers are not doing what brother Brandon said they've got to listen to The Living five-fold Ministry preachers as they point to the word of God and then it will do them good let's listen to the quotes [Applause] five different gifts is that right God has not his nine gifts to the local churches on one of you the five Minister gives Apostles prophets teachers pastors is that right five spiritual gifts now those gifts are for the perfecting of the church to keep the church and all our pastors and teachers and evangelists and Prophets and so forth now it's gifts they're all gonna have what's these men here are gifted to preach you've got to also believe what they preach yeah all right let's go do one good they can just preach on and on and on you'll never get saved your direct confusion be lost that's right amen right you've got to believe what they're saying the 11th quote is from the influence of another 62. I love that brother Branham says the businessmen don't understand the approach to the ministry because they don't have god-called gifts then brother random lists the five-fold ministry gifts and I believe this is what has happened in Branham Tabernacle they're businessmen they're not preachers and this is proven by what brother Branham said they're not listening to the fivefold ministry they're not even preaching like the fivefold ministry preachers are supposed to do let's listen to the quotes a businessman the first place you don't understand the approach you don't understand they're approach to the ministry because the ministry is a good piano gift s [Music] we're successful Graphics teachers advances and casters the 12th quote is from putting on the whole armor of God brother random says the fivefold ministry is God's dress wear it's his army and then he said any office that denies any of this word is not God's dressing it's a wolf in sheep's clothing so friends I believe Brandon Tabernacle has exposed themselves their leaders are wolves and sheep's clothing because they deny many words of this Bible not just one they deny many as I went over at the beginning let's listen to the quotes amen ities me and she just takes lots of words that remember that's God wants to speak in his word 13th quote is from and then their eyes were open and they knew him brother random says the fivefold Ministries are all for the perfecting of the church how could we turn one down and say the other one isn't so so that's the exact air that Branham Tabernacle has committed they want the prophet gift but they don't want any of the others or as I've even heard the pastors say brother Branham fulfilled all the fivefold ministry gifts so that's why they can just sit down press play and Obey which they don't obey they don't obey all these quotes on the fightful ministry the perfect will of God and not adding or taking away from Paul's gospel let's listen to the quote and God set some in the church first apostles and Prophets teachers advances and pastors all for the protecting of the church how can we turn one down and say the other isn't so God does it himself amen there's nothing in the world but just healing yourself to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit takes over from there and you don't know what you're doing it's the Holy Spirit Sovereign word a 14th quote is from Balman Gilead 1959 brother Brown says these five-fold gifts are all in operation we cannot bypass one and say there's teachers without saying there's evangelists he said all of them are for the perfecting of the body of Christ so basically Branham Tabernacle saying we have brother Branham he's the prophet or he's all the five gifts we don't need any other preachers our brother Brandon said you can't say that you have to say there's five preaching gifts and they're making us ready for the coming of the Lord let's listen to the quotes offices and all the members of the body the first is apostles which is missionaries the word Apostle means one that sent the word missionary means one that sense the same word Apostles prophets teachers pastors advances these offices God sits in the church they're all in operation or should be we cannot bypass one and say there's teachers without saying advances we cannot say there's evangelists without saying there is Apostles we cannot say there's Apostles without admitting there is prophets all of them are for the perfecting of the body of Christ the 15th quote is from gifts 1956 brother and lists the fivefold ministry and he says the prophet couldn't say you're not in it speaking to another office of the fivefold ministry brother Branham said Christ was in the fullness of these five gifts He said Each preaching gift is like a ray of light it's just one of them raised off of God and it all points right back to God isn't that sad random Tabernacle is not pointing us to the Bible they're pointing to their own man-made Creeds and dogmas we never find these 12 13 and 24 lies in the Bible well the ram says all five gifts are all little lines of God that's put into the church for the perfecting of the Saints isn't that sad Branham Tabernacle wants to deny the lights or the Rays of God from shining into their services it's extremely sad let's listen to the quotes [Applause] an apostle the classic [Applause] Church [Applause] experience [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] the next quote is from and then Jesus came 1957 brother random lists the fivefold Ministries says that's his proof his ministering Spirit to the church to bring the body of Christ together how can Branham Tabernacle come together in the body of Christ when they deny the living preaching five-fold Ministry gifts today brother Branham never said I fulfilled all the five preaching gifts so there's no more preaching gifts they all need to sit down and press play and Obey let's listen to the quote because God has set in the church five different gifts Apostle prophets teachers advances pastors those are for the perfecting on the church that is his proof his menacing Spirit to the church to bring the body of Christ together the final quote is from questions and answers part three brother random is asked is he the only one that should preach and brother Brandon of course says no every man that feels a call of God upon his life get into the ministry and start preaching we need them the sad thing is random Tabernacle says oh yeah you can preach but you have to do a denominational mandate you've got to catch our man-made denominational Vision you've got to play the tapes first as your primary preaching Ministry of your services and of course that's a lie that's not found in the Bible thank god brother random said men are anointed all over the world to preach the gospel and Saints we still need them today let's listen to the quote preach but you we have seen you're we have seen you ordained man we do don't believe you would do that if there were not if they were not to preach Mercy brother sister ever who told you that nobody's preached with me you're not sure if you have four subjects with all that no every matter feels a call and run upon his life get into the ministry start preaching we need them man of God are not all over the world to preach the gospel see I'm just one little Pebble on the among men so uh there's this many there's more eligible more worthy more of anything to preach than me I'm just one little hun gry so it's just uh you know what I mean any man just man is to preach the gospel by God's grace I want to add two more quotes in these quotes brother Brandon says God did not choose Machinery to preach the gospel and of course this shows the error of the thinking of Branham Tabernacle to just press play and let machines preach the gospel that's an error God only uses man to work with he doesn't use organizations it doesn't use Machinery he could have done it but he chose a man he could choose the Stars the wind or anything to preach the gospel but he choose man he does not change himself he notice in the second quote brother Branham said he ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery it was men and of course that's speaking of the fivefold ministry because that agrees with all the other quotes from Brother Branham and most importantly it agrees with the Bible Ephesians 4 verse 11. the reason we know that this day has got to be civil amen Anthony I always works in Simplicity yes but God in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preaching the gospel but he ordained man for that purpose and he never changes he never ordained denominations not Machinery Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being it was man in closing friends this has been a serious sobering video about the strong delusion that would be upon random tabernacle's leadership to say thus saith the Lord they're in the perfect will of God and yet deny all these quotes from Brother Branham and of course all these Bible verses presented on the video as well I hope it's been a help to you and I want to remind the viewers that I've spoken to two childhood friends of Brenham Tabernacles pastor and both told me they've never heard their pastors say thus saith the Lord in his entire life and I believe he's 67 years old now this means 2018 was the first time this supposed Prophet had spoken with us saith the Lord and he was wrong so this goes back to the video I made that I do not believe random Tabernacles Pastor is a prophet brother Branham said he felt and prayed that his son would do double times double or four times all that brother random did and of course we know that hasn't happened [Music] than our people that's my prayer anyhow and I believe it'll be here [Music] he'll take my place where the random son has not spoke 28 squirrels into existence has not traveled around the world 28 times and has not done one discernment prayer line like his father let alone four times all the numbers of prayer lines that his father brother Branham operated by the gift of the Holy Ghost and remember friends we're five years from this thus saith the Lord's statement that came from Brenham Tabernacles pastor and we can see the fruits of his ministry and their Church constantly adding to the word of God constantly taking from the word of God constantly creating their own man-made Creeds dogmas mandates without any of Paul's gospel to vindicate any of the lies they're telling and of course Paul's gospel would never vindicate a lie friends let's pray that their leadership and followers are not beyond the point of no return please pray for that in your personal private prayer time as I do if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
