[0:03] Revelation chapter 13 the themes of this
[0:09] chapter include the beast out of the sea
[0:12] and the beast out of the earth and the
[0:15] number of the beast which is 666
[0:20] due to this chapter being highly
[0:22] symbolic we will cover the symbols key
[0:24] revelations and timing altogether
[0:26] chronologically
[0:30] in verses 1 & 2 the beast out of the sea
[0:34] was the kingdom of Imperial Rome which
[0:37] was identified by Daniel as the fourth
[0:39] and final Gentile kingdom that would
[0:41] rule the world before the second coming
[0:43] of Jesus Christ to the earth see Daniel
[0:46] 2 verses 31 to 45 Babylon was the head
[0:50] of gold the Medes and Persians were the
[0:53] arms and chest of silver the Grecians
[0:56] were the belly of thighs and brass and
[0:58] Rome was the legs and feet of iron in
[1:01] clay the timing of the rule of Imperial
[1:04] Rome or the Empire of Rome was around 27
[1:08] BC which was not long after the fall of
[1:10] the Grecian Empire in 323 BC the Roman
[1:15] Empire was said to fall during the fifth
[1:16] century AD
[1:19] this Roman Empire rose out of the sea
[1:22] which represents people's multitudes
[1:24] nations and tongues according to
[1:26] revelation 17 verse 15 the seven heads
[1:30] represent the seven mountains or Hills
[1:31] that ancient Rome sat upon revelation 17
[1:35] verse 9 the ten horns are ten future
[1:38] kings of the earth according to
[1:40] revelation 17 verse 12 that will give
[1:43] their power to the Holy Roman Empire
[1:45] during the Tribulation Period the Beast
[1:48] will be seen again in Revelation chapter
[1:50] 17 but we'll be carrying a woman or
[1:53] church which is the Roman Catholic
[1:55] Church
[1:57] this beast or roman empire was liken
[2:01] unto a leopard with the feet of a bear
[2:03] and the mouth of a lion these animals
[2:06] were first mentioned in Daniel chapter 7
[2:07] verses 1 to 8 as four kingdoms and were
[2:11] the same kingdoms from Daniel chapter 2
[2:13] and the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar the
[2:16] fact that all these three different
[2:18] kingdoms are now combined into the
[2:20] fourth and final Kingdom means that the
[2:23] demon powers of the first three kingdoms
[2:25] Babylon Medes and Persians Grecians were
[2:29] now empowering the fourth and last Roman
[2:32] Empire this is because men died but
[2:35] demons do not die they just move on to
[2:38] dwellin and possess other men the dragon
[2:42] is again mentioned which is Satan as we
[2:44] saw in Revelation 12 verse 9
[2:46] Satan is ultimately the one who gave the
[2:49] Roman Empire its power seat and great
[2:51] Authority for Satan is called the god of
[2:54] this world in 2nd Corinthians 4 verse 4
[2:56] and has the greatest influence over
[2:59] every human government on the face of
[3:01] the earth according to Jesus in Luke
[3:03] chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 in verses 3 and
[3:08] 4 the beast or Roman Empire fell from a
[3:11] deadly wound as history said the
[3:13] Imperial Roman Empire fell in the fifth
[3:16] century AD but the demonic spirit of
[3:19] Rome got a new lease on life as it
[3:22] channelled its power into the Holy Roman
[3:24] Empire the rise of the Holy Roman Empire
[3:27] has been so great that no one has been
[3:29] able to make war against the Vatican
[3:31] just as the scripture said
[3:35] in verses 5 through 10 this Holy Roman
[3:38] Empire scene making war and dominating
[3:41] the entire world during the tribulation
[3:43] period which will last 42 months or
[3:46] three and a half years the Vatican will
[3:48] eventually make war against Israel who
[3:50] were called Saints in Revelation 13
[3:53] verse 7 the Vatican also commits a
[3:56] three-fold blasphemy according to verse
[3:57] 6 for the Roman Catholic Church has
[4:00] blaspheme God's name by changing it to
[4:03] Father Son Holy Ghost instead of the
[4:05] Lord Jesus Christ
[4:06] second the Vatican blaspheme the
[4:09] heavenly tabernacle by calling Rome the
[4:11] Eternal City
[4:13] lastly the Roman Catholic Church
[4:15] blasting them in heaven which means the
[4:17] dead Saints by offering prayers to them
[4:20] which is a form of spiritualism and is
[4:23] never commanded by Scripture in verses
[4:27] 11 through 18 the beast out of the earth
[4:29] is the same demonic spirit of Rome
[4:31] disguised behind the Holy Roman Empire
[4:34] but now it's operating through the
[4:36] United States of America notice the
[4:38] Beast rose out of the land and not the
[4:40] sea as sea represents multitudes of
[4:43] people showing that the North American
[4:46] continent had a very small human
[4:48] population when the United States was in
[4:50] its infancy
[4:51] this beasts had two horns like a lamb
[4:54] but was not a lamb so the two horns
[4:56] represent those of a baby bison or
[4:59] Buffalo
[5:03] in May 2016 former President Barack
[5:06] Obama and the US government made the
[5:08] buffalo the official mammal of our
[5:10] country helping to further declare that
[5:13] the United States is the beast out of
[5:15] the earth the United States clearly
[5:19] speaks as a dragon or as Satan for the
[5:22] United States of America is the
[5:24] policeman of the world due to its
[5:26] economic and military strength the US
[5:29] has the power the first Beast the Beast
[5:31] out of the sea for the United States is
[5:34] a modern-day Rome exercising financial
[5:37] and military control and influence over
[5:39] much of the world a key revelation about
[5:44] the United States is that this beast is
[5:46] able to make fire come down from heaven
[5:48] on the earth in the sight of men which
[5:51] represents the two atomic bombs that the
[5:54] United States dropped over the Japanese
[5:56] cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in
[5:59] August of 1945
[6:03] we believe that one day in the near
[6:06] future the United States will be leaders
[6:08] in setting up an image of the Beast
[6:10] according to verse 15 this image will be
[6:13] a world council of false Christian
[6:16] churches that will be granted great
[6:18] political power to cause anyone to be
[6:20] killed who will not worship and obey
[6:22] their unionised religious group this
[6:25] unionized false Christian religion will
[6:28] force everyone to take a mark either in
[6:30] their hand or forehead or they cannot
[6:33] buy or sell it seems the mark in the
[6:36] right hand represents doing the will of
[6:38] the Religious Council and the mark in
[6:40] the forehead represents believing the
[6:42] false doctrine of the false religious
[6:44] system
[6:54] next let's look at what the mark of the
[6:56] beast will be
[6:59] God's prophets said that the mark of the
[7:02] beast will be some form of unionized
[7:04] religion and Christian denominations
[7:07] will take the mark of the beast now
[7:11] remember your young people remember how
[7:13] brother branham saying and may my words
[7:15] be great with a iron pian of a amount of
[7:19] Steel thus saith the Lord that same
[7:24] thing will happen in religion you belong
[7:26] to a denomination of some sort or you
[7:29] cannot buy ourselves I know it's
[7:32] unpopular speaking it's organization I
[7:40] don't say that forth to be angry I say
[7:44] that because it's true brothers the
[7:46] daily work on one TV show raised up
[7:49] maybe a ball but you know that that was
[7:51] done saying throw without the sphere of
[7:56] God which is the baptism of Holy Ghost
[7:58] Confederation apostasy is the mark of
[8:01] the beast that's just their philosophy
[8:04] do you think them nominations will ever
[8:08] break up their denomination come back to
[8:09] work it's just say if the Lord they
[8:11] won't will they going to the Antichrist
[8:14] exactly it's tough faith or they will
[8:19] in verse 18 we are told that the number
[8:22] of the beast is a number of a man 666
[8:25] there been many guesses as to the
[8:27] meaning of this number but there is only
[8:29] one man to be revealed in the near
[8:32] future
[8:32] who is closely associated with Rome and
[8:35] has a connection to the number 666 and
[8:38] that is the Pope of the Roman Catholic
[8:40] Church we come to this conclusion
[8:43] because the Pope has been given the
[8:45] title the Charis fili day or Vicar of
[8:49] gods as seen in this google screenshot
[8:53] the Roman numerals for Vaqueros filly
[8:55] day
[8:56] add up to the exact number of 666
[9:02] furthermore the second proof that the
[9:05] office of the Pope will be the office of
[9:07] the person of the Antichrist comes from
[9:09] revelation 17 which states that the
[9:12] woman who sits on seven mountains or
[9:14] Hills the Roman Catholic Church sits
[9:16] upon or rides the beast or demonic
[9:19] spirit of Rome
[9:20] if the Roman Catholic Church is the one
[9:22] controlling the fourth and final kingdom
[9:24] of Rome then the Pope who is the head of
[9:27] their false church is the only person
[9:29] who could rule the entire world as the
[9:32] person of the Antichrist
[9:35] if you would like more bible scriptures

[9:45] Christ be the desire of your heart
