[0:02] the natural man ramisis was growing the
[0:06] natural man the Antichrist is growing
[0:08] now through politics he's already got to
[0:11] The Wine
[0:13] House greetings friends in the matchless
[0:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:18] purpose of this video is to react to a
[0:20] few recent videos of President Donald
[0:24] Trump that caused me to wonder if he is
[0:27] a forerunner of the Antichrist which I
[0:29] believe will be a future pope of the
[0:31] Roman Catholic church so the origin of
[0:34] this video was that a couple days ago I
[0:36] saw two videos on the same day one
[0:40] involved the name of Jesus in prayer and
[0:42] the other one involved idolatry sexual
[0:45] morality and so forth both coming from
[0:47] the president of the United States so
[0:49] wanted to make a video about this
[0:51] because I've never seen such a blatant
[0:54] expression of idolatry before and I
[0:56] brought to mind all these scriptures and
[0:59] quotes that will go through through in
[1:00] this video by the grace of God I do want
[1:02] to say that I appreciate the positive
[1:04] things about Donald Trump I voted for
[1:06] him in 2020 and in this last election
[1:09] 2024 I do believe he is the lesser of
[1:12] two evils I'm thankful that he won the
[1:15] 2016 election even though I didn't vote
[1:17] for him I did not vote for Hillary
[1:19] Clinton I voted for a little known
[1:20] candidate in 2016 I also appreciate
[1:23] Donald Trump's support for Israel and
[1:26] all the positive things he did for our
[1:27] economy but after seeing these vide
[1:29] videos this week I was alarmed with the
[1:31] blatant idolatry so that led me to make
[1:34] this video by the grace of God now
[1:37] friends I do consistant watch United
[1:39] States politics because of what brother
[1:40] Ram said in the church age book that the
[1:43] United States government would change
[1:44] laws in order to persecute true
[1:46] Christians and it would be right around
[1:48] the time of the Rapture the Temptation
[1:50] will come as follows The ecumenical move
[1:53] that has started on what seems such a
[1:55] beautiful and blessed principle
[1:57] fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all
[2:00] might be one becomes so strong
[2:02] politically that she Bears pressure upon
[2:05] the government to cause all to join with
[2:07] her either directly or through adherence
[2:09] to principles enacted into law so that
[2:12] no people will be recognized as actual
[2:14] churches unless under direct or indirect
[2:16] domination of this Council furthermore
[2:20] the elect will not only be kept but as
[2:22] this move becomes the image Ed to the
[2:24] Beast the Saints will be gone in the
[2:27] Rapture and brother R also used
[2:29] revelation 13:16 to say that the true
[2:31] bride would be forced to stop preaching
[2:34] and I've always believed that when the
[2:36] true bride would be forced to stop
[2:38] preaching such as message preachers
[2:40] myself and many others here in the
[2:42] United States that that would be a great
[2:44] sign that the Rapture would be eminent
[2:46] or close at hand by the grace of God I
[2:48] believe someday the real bride of Christ
[2:52] will be forced to stop preaching the
[2:56] word of God the Bible proph prophesies
[3:00] of it in Revelations 13:16 if you want
[3:02] to put it down the nominations will
[3:05] force it to stop or take its Mark then
[3:10] when the lamb will take his bride and
[3:13] judge the for this and so this
[3:15] video is a bit of a followup to the
[3:17] November 20th 2024 video I made about
[3:20] Trump and Vance's presidential election
[3:23] win and as I said on that video it seems
[3:26] like with the win of the conservative
[3:29] movement with Trump Advance it seems now
[3:32] that the religious power of the Beast
[3:34] out of the earth is becoming more
[3:36] manifest remember the beasts out of the
[3:38] Earth has two horns brother Ram said
[3:40] they're civil and
[3:41] ecclesiastical but in Revelations 13
[3:44] when this land came up he came up out of
[3:47] the
[3:48] earth no people the United States but
[3:52] then after he had two little horns civil
[3:55] and ecclesiastical powers and then he
[3:57] received power and spoke like the Dragon
[4:00] did before him well you just got to mark
[4:03] it down we are coming into a religious
[4:08] persecution with the same things that
[4:10] they did in Pagan Rome many years ago
[4:13] for it's thus sayeth the Lord so the
[4:16] United States has always been a great
[4:17] civil power but now it seems like Trump
[4:20] is able to Garner a lot of the
[4:21] ecclesiastical support of the people and
[4:24] since it seems the previous
[4:26] administration under Joe Biden was
[4:28] weaponized against Christianity it seems
[4:30] like now this is a rest time for
[4:32] Christians perhaps and so that would
[4:34] mean the enemy would be trying to unite
[4:37] Christians in the false Unity of the
[4:39] false ecclesiastical system which will
[4:41] eventually combine with the World
[4:43] Council of churches and then that would
[4:45] be the ecclesiastical Horn of the Beast
[4:48] because it has civil and ecclesiastical
[4:50] power now I want to begin with some
[4:51] scriptures here about forerunners
[4:54] because it seems like Trump is a
[4:55] forerunner of the Antichrist the pope
[4:58] Antichrist according to acts 536 and 37
[5:03] we can see that the enemy seems to know
[5:06] when God is going to do something so
[5:07] he'll produce an imitation or a copycat
[5:11] of the true I'm just thinking of it now
[5:14] and another example is Janice and jambre
[5:17] as Paul says in 2 Timothy 3:8 now as
[5:20] Janice and jambers with stood Moses so
[5:22] see just about the time God raised up a
[5:24] deliverer Satan raised up
[5:27] impersonators let's read acts 5 36 and
[5:30] 37 I believe this is Gia and he said a
[5:33] man named thus or thetus raised up he
[5:37] boasted himself to be somebody had a
[5:39] small movement but it was brought to not
[5:42] and then Judas of Galilee Drew away much
[5:44] people after him and he also perished
[5:47] and the people were
[5:49] dispersed so this shows there was two
[5:51] impersonators at least when the Lord
[5:53] Jesus raised up as Messiah so Satan
[5:56] again tried to impersonate a raising up
[5:59] of a messiah Messiah so we can see in
[6:01] the days of Moses and we saw in the days
[6:02] of Jesus even the days of brother
[6:04] brandham there was two forerunners that
[6:07] tried to impersonate brother Brandon
[6:08] with the spirit of Elijah one was
[6:10] Charles Tas Russell and the other was
[6:12] Alexander Dai DOI passed away in 1907
[6:15] claimed to have the spirit of Elijah and
[6:17] Charles Tes Russell passed away in 1916
[6:19] claimed to have the role of Elijah and
[6:22] notice those years 1907 and 1916 brother
[6:25] randam became a pastor in either 1932 or
[6:29] 19 33 and so see the enemy must have
[6:32] known that so the enemy anointed these
[6:34] false prophets or false teachers to
[6:36] raise up as forerunners and it drew
[6:39] people away from the truth but thank God
[6:42] God had a true Prophet named William Mar
[6:44] and brandham and of course we follow his
[6:46] bible-based teachings today the seventh
[6:48] Church age messenger of Revelation 3 he
[6:51] had a son of man Ministry according to
[6:52] Luke 17:30 he had the spirit of Elijah
[6:55] to turn our hearts back to the apostolic
[6:57] fathers according to Malachi 45 and6 he
[6:59] was Elijah to restore all things that
[7:02] Paul taught us Peter James John
[7:04] according to Matthew 17:1 and he
[7:06] finished the mysteries of God as
[7:07] Revelation 10:7 says by the grace of the
[7:10] Lord Jesus Christ so it seems president
[7:12] Trump is a forerunner to the Antichrist
[7:15] now when Barack Obama raised up in the
[7:17] US some of my friends thought he was
[7:19] going to be the Antichrist and I didn't
[7:21] know much about it so I I didn't know
[7:23] for sure but his popularity dissolved
[7:26] very quickly but Donald Trump is
[7:28] different Donald Trump his popularity
[7:30] has only grown since he announced his
[7:32] candidacy to be a president in 2015 and
[7:35] as we'll show in this video it seems
[7:37] like the whole world is kind of catching
[7:39] on to this but before we look at that uh
[7:41] let's look at this quote from brother
[7:42] brandham it's a quote from the Third
[7:44] Exodus June 30th morning service 1963
[7:47] and brother Ram's talking about how the
[7:49] Antichrist power was growing even then
[7:51] in the United States and he typed The
[7:53] Exodus of Israel out of Egypt with the
[7:56] Gentile Rapture both Powers had to be
[7:58] growing in order for there to be Exodus
[8:00] in the days of Moses and he typed that
[8:02] to today in order for us to have an
[8:04] exodus into the skies into a Rapture the
[8:07] powers have to be growing both sides the
[8:10] power of darkness and the power of God
[8:12] so in this quote it's very similar to
[8:14] quotes from uniting times and signs that
[8:16] brother B preached but I like this quote
[8:18] because he talks about the Protestants
[8:19] and Catholics uniting and the Antichrist
[8:22] he said is growing now through politics
[8:24] he's already got the White House so he
[8:26] had it back there in ' 63 of course
[8:27] under JFK the Catholic church and then
[8:30] Joe Biden was a Catholic President and
[8:32] now Donald Trump he says he's a
[8:33] presbyterian but it seems like he
[8:35] doesn't have a real faith in God brother
[8:37] says they're all uniting together it
[8:39] makes a power a beast just like the
[8:41] first one and then remember we have thus
[8:43] sayith the Lord Brother Bram said this
[8:44] nation United States will exercise the
[8:46] same persecution power that Rome
[8:49] exercised and it's with thus sayith the
[8:51] Lord so we know at some point the United
[8:53] States will turn against true
[8:55] Christianity and persecute true
[8:57] Christians but thank God the bride won't
[8:58] be here we we believe the foolish virgin
[9:01] will be here but we don't believe the
[9:02] bride will go through that the bride
[9:04] will not go through the wrath of God now
[9:06] getting back to this Third Exodus quote
[9:08] brother Ram said there's a persecution
[9:10] coming upon all those who won't Unite
[9:12] with it a boycott so this is what
[9:14] brother Bram would also call The Squeeze
[9:16] then he says they're both growing again
[9:18] it'll be a showdown one of these days
[9:20] the Antichrist power is growing in the
[9:22] United States government but the holy
[9:24] spirit's coming down the mysteries of
[9:26] God being revealed and set in order in
[9:28] the church the Bride of Jesus Christ
[9:30] let's listen to the quote but they're
[9:32] raised up a pharaoh who didn't know
[9:35] Joseph the same thing today a man's
[9:38] raised up and took oath in the in the
[9:40] White House that will not swear to his
[9:43] oath will not take his oath that he
[9:45] believes in freedom of religion what's
[9:48] this new pope
[9:49] saying one four things that he has one
[9:52] of them is to unite the Protestant and
[9:54] the Catholic together and to any
[9:57] intellectual person that's the thing to
[9:59] do
[10:00] but according to the Bible it's a wrong
[10:02] thing to do and the Bible said they
[10:04] would do that let's go a little forward
[10:07] at this time ramises in Egypt was
[10:11] growing his power is
[10:13] growing the natural man ramisis was
[10:17] growing the natural man the Antichrist
[10:20] is growing now through politics he's
[10:23] already got to the White House in
[10:25] religion he's got all the people so
[10:27] scrupled up that actually they'd fall
[10:28] right for it and the denominational
[10:30] leaders practically every church that
[10:32] there is in the nation is already in the
[10:35] confederation of churches amen ramises
[10:38] is
[10:39] growing and they're all uniting together
[10:43] amen and that's what they'll have and
[10:46] what does it do it makes a power of
[10:49] Beast just like the first one then
[10:50] there's a persecution coming upon all
[10:52] those who want Unite with it and the
[10:54] boycott it'll be too late then you've
[10:57] already tucked the mark I say I'll do it
[11:00] then you better do it now ramises was
[11:05] growing but
[11:07] remember while rameses was growing into
[11:10] power in Egypt God had Moses in the
[11:13] wilderness he was growing
[11:16] too ramises had a political
[11:19] system God had a spiritual system under
[11:22] a
[11:23] prophet ready to come down to speak to
[11:26] the people
[11:30] they're both growing
[11:33] again it'll be a showdown one of these
[11:36] days the time ain't far off when there
[11:39] will come a showdown as a natural as the
[11:42] scripture says a natural type the
[11:43] spiritual you can't get away from it
[11:46] there it is it's right before your eyes
[11:47] it's
[11:48] truth look at the church now calling out
[11:51] coming into Power the Holy Spirit coming
[11:54] down the mysteries of God being revealed
[11:56] and set in order see right here she's
[11:58] all already in the White House and the
[12:00] church is pulling itself together amen
[12:03] not a denomination out of the bondage of
[12:06] iniquities away from the
[12:09] amorites a people that's
[12:11] free oh now let's get to that first
[12:15] video I saw the other day it was Donald
[12:17] Trump's first cabinet meeting and he
[12:19] opened it up with prayer there's a
[12:21] Cabinet member I guess who used to be a
[12:23] pastor so he opened up with prayer and
[12:25] he closed the prayer in jesus' name and
[12:27] he even quoted Psalm 33 12 blessed is
[12:30] the nation whose God is the Lord so I
[12:32] was a little encouraged when I saw this
[12:34] video but then I saw the next video as
[12:37] we get to in a little bit and of course
[12:39] was discouraged by that but also knowing
[12:41] that everyone must fall under one
[12:43] anointing or the other the Antichrist
[12:46] anointing or the Holy Ghost anointing
[12:48] let's watch that video of the cabinet
[12:50] meeting prayer let's pray father we
[12:53] thank you uh for this awesome privilege
[12:56] father to be in your presence God thank
[12:59] thank you that you've allowed us to see
[13:01] this day the Bible says that your
[13:02] mercies are new every morning and father
[13:05] God we give you the glory and the honor
[13:07] thank you God for president Trump father
[13:09] for appointing us father God thank you
[13:12] for anointing us to do this job father
[13:15] we pray uh you'll give the president the
[13:17] vice president wisdom father God as they
[13:19] lead father I pray for all of my
[13:21] colleagues that are here around the
[13:23] table and in this room Lord God we pray
[13:25] that uh we would lead with a righteous
[13:28] clarity father God as we serve the
[13:30] people of this country in every
[13:32] prospective agency every job that we
[13:34] have father we would humble ourselves
[13:36] before you and we would lead in the
[13:38] manner that you've called us to lead and
[13:40] to serve father the Bible says that
[13:41] blessed is the nation whose God is the
[13:43] Lord but father we today honor you and
[13:47] in your rightful place father thank you
[13:49] for giving us this opportunity to
[13:50] restore faith in this country and be a
[13:53] blessing to the people of America and
[13:55] Lord God today in our meeting we pray
[13:57] that you will be glorified our
[13:59] conversation in Jesus name amen now
[14:02] let's look at the second video I'm
[14:03] actually not going to play the video I'm
[14:05] just going to show screenshots from the
[14:06] video so here's a screenshot the
[14:08] beginning of the video and it starts
[14:09] with this rap music saying that Donald
[14:11] Trump is to set you free bringing the
[14:14] light for all to see and of course this
[14:16] is Blasphemous the Bible said in John
[14:19] 8:36 that the son therefore shall make
[14:21] you free you shall be free indeed and
[14:24] Jesus is the light of the world
[14:26] according to John 8:12 I am the light of
[14:29] the world he that follow me shall not
[14:31] walk in darkness but shall have the
[14:33] light of
[14:36] life to set you free bringing the light
[14:39] for all to
[14:41] see to set you free bringing the light
[14:44] for all to see so the music is already
[14:47] exalting Trump as this Messianic figure
[14:50] and this is a video looks like an AI
[14:53] generated video Donald Trump posted on
[14:55] all his social media accounts I use
[14:57] telegram so that's where I saw it now of
[14:59] course Donald Trump might be just trying
[15:01] to troll the left like he always does
[15:03] but a spiritual person if you had a
[15:05] spiritual mind would see all the blatant
[15:07] idolatry sexual Morality In this video
[15:11] and would abhor it so that's the first
[15:13] thing it's just Blasphemous lyrics to
[15:16] the rap song second thing is there's
[15:19] exotic dancers that are transgender they
[15:21] have women's bodies but men's beards so
[15:24] that's a state of confusion as the Bible
[15:26] said God's not the author of confusion
[15:28] as the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 14
[15:30] and of course we're not to put any
[15:31] wicked thing before our eyes according
[15:33] to Psalm
[15:35] 101:3 then the video shows this golden
[15:38] image of Donald Trump which is blatant
[15:40] idolatry it reminds us of Daniel 3:1
[15:43] when Nebuchadnezzar built this golden
[15:45] image that Shadrach meach and Abednego
[15:48] refused to bow down to this is the most
[15:50] blatant idolatry and Antichrist imagery
[15:54] I've ever seen of United States
[15:55] President so that was a huge red flag of
[15:57] course as you can see in the picture and
[16:00] then there's little statues of Donald
[16:02] Trump it looks like for sale apparently
[16:04] in what they propos to be a new Gaza a
[16:07] rebuilt Gaza so there's two images there
[16:10] a blatant idolatry making Donald Trump
[16:13] this golden image which we know God
[16:15] hates even in the Great Tribulation
[16:17] according to Revelation chapter 9 God
[16:19] will be destroying all the nations who
[16:21] still have idols and of course they can
[16:23] be natural Idols or spiritual idols and
[16:25] then there's a video of Donald Trump
[16:27] With a Stripper or exotic dancer and of
[16:29] course he's been married three times
[16:30] he's already an adulterer and looks like
[16:32] he's enjoying this conversation with a
[16:34] stripper or something very Wicked and
[16:37] then there's money being thrown around
[16:38] there's money everywhere so of course
[16:40] Jesus said you cannot serve God in
[16:42] manmon so this video exalts Donald Trump
[16:46] exalts sexual morality exalts riches and
[16:49] Jesus said you either love one or the
[16:51] other so it seems to be like Donald
[16:53] Trump loves riches and all those who
[16:55] follow Donald Trump love riches and
[16:57] friends as Christians we cannot be a
[16:58] part of that we cannot love money we
[17:01] have to love the Lord Jesus Christ no
[17:02] matter what he allows us to go through
[17:04] no matter how poor we become or Rich we
[17:05] become the love of money is the root of
[17:08] all evil so after seeing this video of
[17:12] course reminds me of 1 Corinthians 10:21
[17:14] and that day that I saw this video I had
[17:16] already listened to 1 Corinthians 10
[17:18] where it says you cannot drink the cup
[17:20] of devils and of the Lord so this
[17:23] applies to Donald Trump or me or you or
[17:25] anyone else it applies to all of us we
[17:27] cannot try to partake of the of God and
[17:29] also partake of idolatry sexual
[17:31] immorality Love of Money remember
[17:34] friends Proverbs 16:18 says Pride goes
[17:37] before a false this is a very prideful
[17:39] video it's exalting a man is like a
[17:41] savior it looks like Trump is the savior
[17:43] of the world he's bringing in sexual
[17:45] morality sexual pleasures riches
[17:48] prosperity and Friends another scripture
[17:50] is Matthew
[17:52] 7:18 Jesus said a tree is known by its
[17:55] fruit a good tree can only bring forth
[17:57] good fruit and a crup tree can only
[17:59] bring forth corrupt fruit so we see a
[18:00] lot of corrupt fruit coming out of
[18:02] Donald Trump's life so that proves he's
[18:04] not a True Believer and I never have
[18:07] believed he was a True Believer but I
[18:09] did always respect how he supported
[18:10] Israel thank God for that whoever
[18:13] blesses Israel will be blessed but that
[18:14] doesn't mean his soul is blessed it
[18:16] doesn't mean his soul is repented and
[18:18] that leads right into the next video I
[18:20] found this video from numerous years ago
[18:22] I think it's 2015 if I'm not mistaken
[18:24] almost 10 years ago where Donald Trump
[18:26] is asked if he's ever asked God for
[18:29] forgiveness and he says no he said he
[18:30] just tries to do better now he does say
[18:33] he takes communion at the Presbyterian
[18:34] church and so forth like that but again
[18:36] it ties in with 1 Corinthians 10:21 you
[18:38] cannot partake of both cups you can't
[18:41] enjoy strippers you can't enjoy idolatry
[18:43] can't enjoy cursing people saying evil
[18:47] words you can't enjoy that cup and then
[18:49] try to enjoy the cup of the Lord so
[18:52] communion with the Lord is in vain if
[18:54] you're partaking of other sins like
[18:56] sexual IM morality idolatry and Love of
[18:58] Money
[18:59] so let's watch that video where Donald
[19:00] Trump says he's never asked for
[19:03] forgiveness have you ever asked God for
[19:07] forgiveness that's a tough question I I
[19:09] don't think in terms of I have I'm I'm a
[19:11] religious person shockingly because
[19:14] people are so shocked when they find
[19:16] this out uh I'm Protestant I'm
[19:19] Presbyterian and I go to church and I
[19:21] love God and I love my church and Norman
[19:23] Vincent Peele the great Norman Vincent
[19:25] Peele was my pastor the power of
[19:27] positive thinking everybody's heard of
[19:29] Norman Vincent P he was so great he
[19:31] would give a sermon you never wanted to
[19:34] leave sometimes we have sermons and
[19:36] every once in a while we think about
[19:37] leaving a little early right even though
[19:39] we're
[19:40] Christian Dr Norman Vincent pfrank would
[19:43] give a survey would give a sermon I'm
[19:46] telling you I still remember his sermons
[19:49] it was unbelievable and what he would do
[19:51] is he'd bring real life situations
[19:53] modern-day situations into the sermon
[19:55] and you could listen to him all day long
[19:58] when you left the church you were
[20:00] disappointed that it was over he was the
[20:02] greatest guy and then you know he passed
[20:04] away but he was a great the he wrote The
[20:06] Power of Positive Thinking which is a
[20:07] great book but have you ever asked God
[20:09] for
[20:14] forgiveness I'm not sure I have I just
[20:17] go and try and do a better job from
[20:19] there I don't think so I think I if I if
[20:22] I do something wrong I think I just try
[20:24] and make it right I don't bring God into
[20:27] that picture I don't now when I take you
[20:30] know when we go and church and and when
[20:32] I drink my little wine which is about
[20:34] the only wine I drink and have my little
[20:36] cracker I guess that's a form of asking
[20:38] for forgiveness and I do that as often
[20:40] as possible because I feel cleansed okay
[20:43] but uh you know to me that's important I
[20:45] do that but in terms of officially I
[20:47] should I see I could say absolutely and
[20:49] everybody I don't think in terms of that
[20:51] I I think in terms of let's go on and
[20:54] let's make and here's the third video
[20:56] this wasn't what I saw the other day but
[20:58] I'd seen a few weeks ago another red
[21:00] flag uh Donald Trump appointed Paula
[21:02] White as the head of a White House
[21:06] Council or committee or group to promote
[21:09] religion and of course Paula White is a
[21:12] woman preacher that breaks the Bible
[21:14] First of all on top of that she's an
[21:16] adulterer she's been married I think
[21:18] three times if I'm not mistaken maybe
[21:20] more so this is another sign of crup
[21:22] fruit coming from Donald Trump promoting
[21:26] a woman preacher as the head of a
[21:28] religious Department of his this week
[21:31] I'm also creating the White House Faith
[21:34] office led by Pastor Paula White who is
[21:37] so
[21:40] amazing so Paula White is a woman
[21:42] preacher that breaks the word she's an
[21:44] adulter her that breaks the word she's a
[21:45] Prosperity preacher she constantly asks
[21:47] for money that breaks the word of God
[21:50] Bible said they can't be guilty of
[21:52] filthy lucer Greed for filthy lucer and
[21:55] a few more examples uh she said Jesus
[21:57] isn't the only begotten son I can now
[22:00] come into a Priestly anointing Jesus is
[22:02] not the only begotten Son of God he is
[22:04] not I'm a Son of God you're this he's
[22:06] the first fruit he's the first born of
[22:08] many Jesus is not the only begotten son
[22:11] and then she let her third husband I
[22:13] believe or fourth husband say it's okay
[22:16] for couples to watch porn that is one of
[22:18] the filthiest false teachings that could
[22:20] ever come across the pulpit I've seen
[22:23] porn destroy marriages porn is an
[22:26] invitation to be possessed with demons
[22:28] and yet it's laughed about in Paula
[22:30] White's services so we're going to play
[22:32] those video clips so you can see it show
[22:35] the sad state that Donald Trump must be
[22:37] in in order to put this woman in a place
[22:39] of leadership of any Department in his
[22:43] administration so friends my conclusion
[22:45] is that Donald Trump must have a partial
[22:47] fear of the Lord but not a true fear of
[22:49] the Lord I preached a sermon on this um
[22:52] last year in 2024 was October 13th in
[22:54] the pm I'll leave a link to it in the
[22:56] description if you're interested in this
[22:58] topic this was a great subject I never
[22:59] thought about before from the Lord not
[23:01] from me but from the Lord I'd never
[23:03] really thought about that I'd preached
[23:05] on numerous sermons about the fear of
[23:06] the Lord Jesus had the anointing of the
[23:08] fear of the Lord according to the book
[23:09] of Isaiah but then I saw a partial fear
[23:12] of the Lord in 2 Kings
[23:15] 17: 24- 41 this is an amazing story here
[23:20] in the history of Israel it was around
[23:22] the time of the Exile when Israel was
[23:25] exiled because of their idolatry God
[23:27] kicked them out of the land the king of
[23:29] Assyria had taken out a lot of the Jews
[23:31] but then he brought in Babylonians just
[23:33] to maintain the land and they kept doing
[23:35] their idolatrous ways so God sent in
[23:37] Lions to kill them so the Babylonians
[23:40] had to figure out how do we stop these
[23:41] lions from killing us in this land and
[23:44] so they learned some of the ways of God
[23:46] in order to keep the lions from slaying
[23:49] them so the Bible said they developed a
[23:51] partial fear of the Lord so verse 32
[23:54] says they feared the Lord and made them
[23:56] unto themselves of the lowest of of the
[23:58] priests of the high places verse 33 they
[24:01] fear the lord and serve their own God so
[24:03] they found kind of an in between
[24:05] lifestyle like a lukewarm lifestyle
[24:07] there it is of honoring some of God's
[24:09] Commandments and then disobeying some of
[24:11] them also now reminds me of Herod how
[24:13] Herod observed many of the things John
[24:15] the Baptist said but then of course he
[24:17] lived in adultery and so forth so wow
[24:19] that's a thought that's breaking forth
[24:20] right now you know comparing Herod with
[24:23] Donald Trump so they feared some of the
[24:26] Lord's commands but they also kept doing
[24:28] some of their own idolatry they did not
[24:31] have a reverential trust in the Lord and
[24:34] they did not have a hatred for evil so
[24:35] they did not have a true fear of the
[24:37] Lord because the true fear of the Lord
[24:39] hates evil as Psalm 19:9 says the fear
[24:42] of the Lord is clean it doesn't produce
[24:44] a dirty life life of sin it produces a
[24:46] life of Holiness and righteousness by
[24:48] the grace of God so again friends it
[24:50] seems to be that Trump is a forerunner
[24:51] to the Future Pope Antichrist just in my
[24:53] humble opinion I could be wrong but I
[24:55] just say that because I've never seen so
[24:57] much proof of it I've never seen a
[24:59] political figure so admired so idolized
[25:02] and of course Trump is supporting this
[25:03] he's the one sharing these AI generated
[25:05] videos he probably didn't make the video
[25:07] somebody probably made it for him but
[25:08] he's still sharing it and not able to
[25:10] recognize the blatant idolatry so
[25:13] friends let's do what Jesus said Watch
[25:14] and Pray Mark 13:31 through 37 Heaven
[25:18] Earth shall pass away but my word shall
[25:19] not pass away but of that day and that
[25:22] hour knoweth no man no not the Angels
[25:24] which are in heaven neither the son but
[25:26] the father take take ye heed watch and
[25:29] pray for ye know not when the time is
[25:32] for the son of man is as a man taking a
[25:34] far Journey who left his house and gave
[25:35] authority to his servants and to every
[25:38] man his work and commanded the porter to
[25:40] watch watch ye therefore for you know
[25:42] not when the Master of the House cometh
[25:44] at even or at midnight or at the
[25:46] crowing or in the morning lest coming
[25:49] suddenly he find you sleeping and what I
[25:51] say unto you all I say unto all watch so
[25:54] friends let's watch and pray for the
[25:56] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[25:58] he is the way the truth and the life and
[26:01] no man comes into the father except
[26:03] through Jesus Christ of course let's
[26:05] pray for Donald Trump to repent and all
[26:07] the people that might be deceived by
[26:08] this that some of them will be saved
[26:10] Jesus said few there be that find it and
[26:12] of course we're supposed to make prayers
[26:14] intercession for all Kings and leaders
[26:16] according to what Paul said in 1 Timothy
[26:18] chapter 2 verse one said I exhort
[26:20] therefore that first of all
[26:21] supplications prayers intercessions and
[26:24] giving of thanks be made for all men 1
[26:26] Timothy 2:2 for kings and for all that
[26:28] are in Authority that we may lead a
[26:31] quiet and peaceful life in all godliness
[26:33] and honesty for this is good and
[26:35] acceptable in the sight of God our
[26:37] savior who will have all men to be saved
[26:38] and come unto the knowledge of the truth
[26:41] so let's keep praying for our leaders
[26:43] let's keep praying for people to come to
[26:46] the knowledge of the truth that they can
[26:47] be repent of their sins trust in the
[26:49] blood of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of
[26:51] sins and be saved and hopefully obey as
[26:54] far as acts 238 to repent and be
[26:56] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[26:58] Christ for the remission of sins and
[26:59] then receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[27:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the three
[27:03] works of Grace justification
[27:05] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[27:07] Ghost if you have any questions concerns
[27:10] or testimonies about this video please
[27:11] contact
[27:13] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[27:16] the desire of your heart
