TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] but I mean the real True Believer is coming to that Battlefield and you better be versed to know what you're doing or you can take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary to this word don't believe it stay with that word greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show the dangers of leaving the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 in summary the dangers of leaving these Bible revelations is losing the anointing of the Holy Ghost and being anointed or influenced or oppressed by evil spirits according to 1 Timothy 4:1 1st Samuel 1614 and 2 Peter 2:8 just to name a few hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet brother William brandham and also defend brother branham's Godly Christian character the Bible is very plain that if a person rejects the truth then they give heed which means to attach oneself hold or cleave to a thing in this case a false Doctrine reject ctors of the Bible revelations Jesus revealed to brother brandham attach themselves to lies or evil spirits that's what 1 Timothy 4:1 says they give heed to seducing Spirits they attach themselves to seducing spirits that allow them to believe doctrines of devils giving heed means True Believers give heed to the truth which means they cast down lies according to 2 Corinthians 10:5 they cast down imaginations and any High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God so the opposite is true giving heed to lies is casting down the truth and of course this all takes place in the human Spirit or the mind as the Bible teaches there's three parts to man in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so we see the three parts of man the spirit the human Spirit the human mind the soul and the body so true worshippers get the anointing of the holy spirit in their spirits and Minds when they accept true Doctrine and of course when they're born again they get the Holy Ghost the Seal of the Holy Ghost in their soul but people who leave the true bible message they get evil spirits anointing their human mind or their human Spirit friends each generation has a chance to hear God's message for their time period or age this is easily seen in judges 2 verse 10 the Bible said all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and There Rose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel since the beginning of time God has always had a message on the earth that led Believers to repentance and salvation by his grace for all those who would believe this was true in Noah's day Moses's day John the Baptist's day the Lord Jesus's Day St Paul's day Martin Luther's day joh Wesley's day and brother bram's day and brother bram's message continues to this day here 2024 I felt led to share this historical fact about Martin Luther I found this quote from a book by Edmond Broadbent from 1935 called the pilgrim church and Broadbent wrote that Luther said not a tenth part of his converts remained steadfast in the faith and Luther felt quote we are almost utter Heathen with the name of Christian and quote so I just read this quote to show that Martin Luther saw a great Falling Away during the message of his hour which was justification by faith the Believers had to come out of Roman Catholicism and a works-based Salvation so if one Church age messenger Martin Luther saw less than one/ tenth of his converts remain should we be surprised today to see so many people who at one time claimed to believe the message of the hour fall away from the Bible faith God gave us through the seventh Church age messenger brother branham's Ministry so of course we're not surprised by all this falling away the Bible of course predicted this great falling away in the last days of the last 2,000 years during the times of the Gentiles found in Luke 21:24 Paul told about this in at least three scriptures 2 Thessalonians 2:3 he said there must come a falling away first he said it in 2 Timothy 3 1-5 in the last days perilous times shall come and then as I mentioned he said it in 1 Timothy 4 1-3 in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils two recent major Falling Away movements Who Fallen away from the Bible revelations God gave to brother brandham began in 2012 and 2015 and both movements continued to this day 2012 saw the rise of anti brother brandham websites these websites miserably fail by making hundreds if not more slanderous false conclusions about brother brandham while they leave the Bible revelations Jesus revealed to brother brandham 2015 saw the rise of the tape worship movement this is the Press Play obey movement it's a falling away from the Bible truths Jesus revealed to brother brandom this movement miserably fails by idolizing brother brandham idolizing his tapes lazily staying at home every Sunday they condemn Jesus's true fful Ministry and of course they ignore the Bible brother brandom's absolute now regarding the anti- brother random websites and their movement and all those that follow them I want to say that some of these individuals left message churches that were sinful and I want to say plainly that I support any honest person leaving a sinful message church if God reveals to that person that the sinful Message Church will never repent knowing should ever stay in a church that's filled with false doctrines it's my humble belief that the Lord raises up Godly Man all over the world so that people can leave false churches and go to True Churches according to 1 Corinthians 3:5 Paul said who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom he believed even as the lord gave to every man so it seems here that this scripture along with other scriptures about God will not leave himself without a witness that anyone who leaves a false Church God will raise them up a faithful church for them to attend if they can believe wait on the Lord and trust in God because Paul said gave to every man it's my belief that many of these anti- brother random people have done horribly wrong by attacking brother brandham as they have never truly sought the Bible to understand the Bible revelations that God showed brother brandham what these anti brother brandham websites have done is got the people's eyes off the Bible and got it on brother bram's life or people around brother brandham and that's what Satan always does he gets people's eyes off the word of God and onto something else so the best case scenario would have been for these people who left these sinful message churches to try to find Holy Ghost fill message churches or find the best churches that were giving out the most truth in their area and then pray for God to raise up a holy ghost filled Message Church in their area I've also observed that many of these people who have left the message have been hurt by the people that were in the message churches that they left and therefore they've developed complexes towards the message churches they've left and now they have complexes towards brother brandham and they're using the hurt of those complexes to attack brother brandham unfairly and attack message churches many times unfairly but again I'm sure there are mistakes some of the message churches have made no doubt about that and friends it's possible time goes on we're going to see more message churches fall into sin because the Bible said there must come a falling away but this would only prove that these message churches never had the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the baptism of the Holy Ghost will produce a Bible loving character a sin hating character A Love For Truth the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth according to John 16:13 and so those of us who believe we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost let us make our calling and election sure as the scripture says says before moving on I do want to say I believe it's Godly and wholesome and good to have honest questions about the Bible questions about God and questions about brother brandham and the church age Messengers The Bible says God is the dissolver of doubts God knows we're going to have doubts God is Not Afraid of our questions God is our loving heavenly father he promised to give us wisdom liberally if we would simply ask him according to James 1: 5-7 the Bible commands us to prove all things 1 Thessalonians 5:22 try every Spirit 1 John 4:1 and be always ready to give an answer for the hope that's within us 1 Peter 3:15 as Christians we should search the Scriptures Daily in order to prove the truth of God and His prophets like the bereans did who searched the scripture to prove Paul was right in Acts 17 10-12 now let's get into the danger of leaving the message God gave to William brandham so the danger of leaving is losing the holy anointing of the holy spirit because you believe the truth when a person rejects true Doctrine they take on evil spirits we see this truth in 1 Timothy 4:1 giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils so those who left the truth they attached themselves or they held on to false doctrines which were evil seducing Spirits 1 Samuel 16:14 said the spirit of the Lord depart from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him that's what I believe has happened to these anti- brother brandom website people the spirit of God departed from them and they have an evil spirit that's troubling them and also these anti- brother Brandon people I'll just call them believe the slander people and I don't say that in a mocking way but I believe that's what they truly are they're believing the slander about brother brandham this group that has left the message I believe are vexed by all that they see and hear all they do is see and hear lies and slander about brother brandham and that vexes their human Spirits it troubles their human Spirits so all they can do is lash out against brother brandham and those who believe brother brandham was a true Prophet they have no love for them they don't pray for them they have very little respect for them and these are the type of people I've interacted with many times online other Bible verses that talk about this are 2 Thessalonians 210 through 14 because they receive not the love of the truth the Bible says God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie the danger of leaving the message is believing a lie instead of the truth but thankfully the Bible says we were chosen to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth True Believers of the Bible revelations of the message are being Sanctified and cleaned out because we believe the truth of the Bible that brother Ram taught us those that have left the message many of them are living a more worldly sinful life they're not being Sanctified by the Holy Spirit and they're not believing true Doctrine Romans 1:28 speaks of them as well they did not like to retain God in their knowledge so God gave them over to a reprobate mind many people that leave the message reject the Bible reject the Bible truths and so God has to give them over to rejected mind these false teachers who leave the message do two things wrong they first add to the Bible and second they often take away from the Bible there are grave consequences to doing both as Proverbs 35 and 6 Revelation 22:18-19 warn us before getting into a few examples here let me read 2 Chronicles 36 verse 16 but they mocked The Messengers of God and despised his words and misused His prophets until the Wrath of the Lord arose against his people till there was no remedy this verse shows Israel mocked the prophets God sent them they despised the prophets God sent them and they misused the prophets this is exactly what people are doing today who have left the message that God revealed to brother brandom these men and women on these anti- msage websites and podcasts they mock brother brandham they despise brother brandom and they misuse brother brandom and they do all of this while they ignore the Bible truth faith message preachers are preaching I'm just one of them they mock brother brandom as they do fake research and ignore the true research that validates brother brandom as a genuine prophet of God they mock brother brandom as they go into sexual perversion such as non-binary relationships adulteries fornications and more they mock brother brandom as they accept women preachers which Paul said should not be done and those are just a few examples so the first first example of a false Doctrine these people have accepted is the false Trinity Dogma message Believers know the Trinity Doctrine is false it's of the devil because it adds to the word of God the Bible never calls God three persons but trinitarians freely add that language to the Bible and that's a sin so these anti- message people that now believe in the Trinity they have at least the anointing of three evil spirits perhaps more and there could be some overlap but they're Anointed with the spirit of er they're Anointed with a lying Spirit and the spirit of idolatry and all these are found in 1 John 46 Proverbs 35 and 6 and exodus 20:3 they have the spirit of air because the spirit of Truth never calls God three persons so they have the spirit of air claiming God is three persons even though his word never says that they have a lying Spirit according to proverbs 35:6 because God said anyone who adds to his words will be called a liar they're lying calling God something that he is not and thirdly they are idolators because they break the first commandment in Exodus 20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me and trinitarians place two other persons next to God the father yet the book of Isaiah says God is only one God and there's no others beside him so making three deities three co-equal persons is idolatry the second example is immodest clothing most of the people that leave the message wear immodest clothing they forsake the Holiness standard of modest clothing that the Bible teaches in 1 Timothy 2:9 and of course other scriptures so the message rejectors who wear immodest clothing are anointed again with at least three evil spirits the spirit of air the spirit of whoredoms and possibly a lying Spirit if they know the scriptures that teach modest clothing one former message preacher who now attacks brother brandom said there is no modesty standards in the Bible that's a lie either through ignorance or a purposeful lie in 2019 I wrote an entire book showing the Bible standards for a modest outward appearance and of course this man and his fellow message rejectors will never read any of my books even though I offered to some of them for free to give them my books they don't want to know the truth so all we can do is pray for their souls pray for their repentance so they have the spirit of air because they're LED away from the truth of 1 Timothy 2:9 about modest clothing they have the spirit of hordon because they likely enjoy seeing women take off most of their clothes and show their immodest flesh in order to tempt men in many cases and of course they have a lying spirit because they know the Bible says modest clothing yet they still say the Bible has no dress code and the dress code is easily found in the four areas I taught in my book we must cover all nakedness Genesis 3:21 1 Timothy 2:9 we must wear thick or layered clothing Matthew 540 John 21:7 we must have gender specific clothing according to Deuteronomy 225 Hebrews 4:15 and loose clothing according to Revelation 7:14 proverbs 7: 10 just to name a few third and final example for part one of this series is women preachers anti- message people believe women are called to preach and if they believe this they're Anointed with at least two evil spirits first the spirit of air and second The Jezebel spirit this is found in 1 John 4:6 Isaiah 3:12 Revelation 2:20 it is the spirit of air to allow women to preach because Paul said women were not allowed to preach in 1 Timothy chap 2 vers 11 down to 15 you get Paul's full reasoning why women are not allowed to preach when Israel was in a backsliding state the women ruled over them that's Isaiah 3:12 the Bible said these women cause them to he and so a woman preacher will always do that because it's against the word of God and then they also have the Jezebel spirit found in Revelation 2:20 they suffer that woman Jezebel to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto Idols of course the Jezebel spirit is a dominating female spirit it's an evil spirit that causes the leaders to submit themselves to people they should not submit to it's a spirit of submission that comes upon the men and they get out of position they get out of God's order that he set forth in 1 Corinthians 11: 1 2 and three the order is God is over Christ Christ is over man man is over the woman in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I've been wanting to do this video for numerous years now at least two years and so this will likely be a part one Lord willing I'll do a part two later by the grace of God but I want to get this video Out friends as time goes on we see more and more vindications that brother brandham was a genuine prophet of God we're so thankful for the Bible revelations that brother Brandon preached to us and friends the more interactions I have with those people that are against brother brandom the more I can see these evil spirits on their lives in fact in my 10 years on YouTube the two groups that have been the most heinous towards me or aggressive or angry are the tape worshipper group The Press Play and Obey group they've been the harshest to me then the other group is this anti- message group The believe the slander group most of these people are just paring the weak incomplete so-called research of the the leaders of this movement most of them don't even know that on the first seal itself there was a 2,000-year difference between brother brandom's teaching on the first seal and Clarence lens teaching on the first seal they haven't even done that research they're just angry parents so let's pray for brother R's accusers and the tape worshippers that they'll repent Heavenly Father God again today I ask Lord that you have mercy on the tape worshippers and also the anti-age people Lord you said there would come a great falling away but Lord I pray Lord all those that will be saved Lord will come to the acknowledgement of the truth use this video and the videos of other faithful message preachers to guide these people back to truth to get the right anointing on them the holy anointing on them and that they'll forsake the seducing spirits and doctrines of devils and they'll come back to the Bible truth all these Bible truths you revealed to your Prophet brother brandham I ask this humbly by the mercy of God through the blood of Jesus Christ in Jesus Christ's name name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
