[0:11] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:15] this video is to give a brief summary of
[0:17] the five reasons why the Rapture is
[0:19] pre-tribulation let's jump right into it
[0:22] reason number one the tribulation period
[0:24] is trouble for Israel the foolish virgin
[0:27] and sinners but not for the Bride of
[0:29] Jesus Christ
[0:30] the following scriptures teach this
[0:35] truth Daniel 121 and at that time shall
[0:39] Michael stand up the great Prince which
[0:41] standeth for the children of thy people
[0:43] and there shall be a time of trouble
[0:45] such as never was since there was a
[0:47] nation even to that same time and at
[0:49] that time thy people shall be delivered
[0:52] everyone that shall be found written in
[0:54] the
[0:55] book the tribulation period is a time of
[0:58] trouble and also is a purging time for
[1:01] Daniel's people thy People Israel which
[1:04] is why it is also called Jacob's trouble
[1:07] in Jeremiah 30: 7 the New Testament Holy
[1:10] Ghost filled bride does not need purged
[1:13] in the tribulation period because she is
[1:15] already forgiven and washed in the blood
[1:17] of Jesus Christ clean through the
[1:19] washing of regeneration and renewing of
[1:22] the Holy Ghost the blood-washed church
[1:25] is already Washed by the Water of
[1:27] Christ's word and is Holy and without
[1:29] blemish in the sight of her husband
[1:31] Jesus Christ the foolish virgins or
[1:34] Christians without the baptism of the
[1:36] Holy Ghost will experiened the trouble
[1:38] of the Great Tribulation as two of
[1:41] Jesus's Parables taught that they would
[1:43] be locked out of the marriage despite
[1:44] living virgin or pure lives because they
[1:47] had no oil or the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:50] Jesus also taught those without the
[1:52] wedding garment or clothing of the Holy
[1:54] Ghost baptism would be cast into outer
[1:56] Darkness with weeping and nashing of
[1:58] teeth the tribulation and battle of
[2:01] Armageddon are God's execution of
[2:03] judgment upon all of the Sinners the
[2:06] ungodly with their ungodly deeds and
[2:08] hard speeches they have spoken against
[2:10] Jesus Christ according to Jude 1: 14 and
[2:16] 15 reason number two there is no mention
[2:19] of the Bride or true church in the
[2:20] tribulation text of the Book of
[2:23] Revelation the word church appears 19
[2:26] times in Revelation but is absent from
[2:29] chapter 3 22 to chapter
[2:32] 22:16 the true church is not mentioned
[2:34] in chapter 8 during the first four
[2:36] trumpets nor in Revelation 9 in the
[2:39] fifth and sixth trumpets and first woe
[2:42] that passes when the second woe passes
[2:44] in Revelation 11 the bride is not
[2:46] mentioned during the final Harvest of
[2:49] the 144,000 Israeli Believers in
[2:51] Revelation 14 there is again no mention
[2:54] of the bride of Christ nor is she
[2:56] mentioned in Revelation chapters 15 and
[2:58] 16 when the seven last plagues and seven
[3:01] vials are poured out upon the Earth the
[3:04] reason the bride of Christ is not
[3:05] mentioned in the tribulation text in the
[3:07] Book of Revelation is because she will
[3:09] be with Jesus Christ during the Great
[3:12] marriage supper of the lamb in heaven
[3:14] and will not have to endure the
[3:16] tribulation period or time of trouble
[3:18] taking place upon the Earth Christ will
[3:21] Rapture his bride at the end of the
[3:22] leoan church age spoken of in Revelation
[3:25] 3:
[3:27] 14-22 and the next time she is seen
[3:30] is when she returns to the Earth from
[3:31] heaven with Jesus Christ for the battle
[3:34] of Armageddon in Revelation 19: 5 to 21
[3:39] which takes place at the end of the
[3:41] tribulation period reason number three
[3:45] the bride or true church is Promised a
[3:47] pardon from God's Divine wrath the
[3:49] following scriptures teach this
[3:54] truth 1 Thessalonians 1:10 and to wait
[3:57] for his son from Heaven whom he raised
[3:59] from the dead even Jesus which delivered
[4:02] us from the Wrath to come Romans 5:9
[4:06] much more then being now justified by
[4:08] his blood shall we be saved from wrath
[4:11] through
[4:12] him 1 Thessalonians 5 verses 4 and9 but
[4:17] ye Brethren are not in darkness that
[4:19] that day should overtake you as a thief
[4:22] for God hath not appointed us to wrath
[4:24] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[4:27] Jesus
[4:28] Christ reev gelation 3:10 because thou
[4:31] has kept the word of my patience I also
[4:34] will keep thee from the hour of
[4:36] Temptation which shall come upon all the
[4:38] world to try them that dwell upon the
[4:42] Earth Psalms
[4:44] 27:5 for in the time of trouble he shall
[4:47] hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of
[4:49] his Tabernacle shall he hide me for he
[4:52] shall set me up upon a rock Luke 21: 26
[4:57] watch ye therefore and pray always that
[4:59] ye may be accounted worthy to escape all
[5:02] these things that shall come to pass and
[5:04] to stand before the son of
[5:07] man remember that the Book of Revelation
[5:10] wrath scriptures pertain nothing to the
[5:12] Bride of Jesus Christ as she is not
[5:15] mentioned in any of these
[5:16] texts in Revelation 6: 16 and 17 during
[5:21] The Sixth Seal or tribulation seal the
[5:24] great day of God's Wrath comes upon the
[5:26] Earth in Revelation 11:18 the bride is
[5:29] not not mentioned after God's two
[5:31] prophets to Israel Minister for three
[5:33] and A2 years which is the final half
[5:35] week of Daniel's 70 weeks and is the
[5:38] time the wrath of God comes upon the
[5:40] Earth the bride is not mentioned in
[5:42] Revelation 12:12 when the inhabitants of
[5:45] the earth must endure Satan's great
[5:47] wrath because he knows he has a short
[5:49] time before his judgment in Revelation
[5:52] 14: 810 and 19 the bride is not
[5:55] mentioned when all nations will drink of
[5:57] the wrath of God because they worshiped
[6:00] the beast's image and received his Mark
[6:02] and we are taught that all holy ghost
[6:04] filled Saints would not take the mark of
[6:06] the beast in Revelation
[6:08] 20:4 in Revelation 15: 1 and 7 the bride
[6:12] is not mentioned when the seven last
[6:14] plagues were filled up with the wrath of
[6:16] God in Revelation 16:1 the vows of the
[6:20] wrath of God were poured out upon the
[6:22] Earth and there is no mention of the
[6:23] bride of Christ furthermore Jesus's
[6:26] teaching about his second coming
[6:28] contained a pattern of the righteous
[6:30] Believers escaping
[6:33] wrath in Luke 17:
[6:36] 26-37 and Matthew 24:
[6:40] 36-42 Jesus described the world's
[6:42] conditions at the time of his second
[6:44] coming the conditions would be twofold
[6:47] first as the days of lot and second as
[6:50] the days of Noah in both time periods
[6:53] the True Believers escaped the wrath of
[6:54] God in the days of lot when Sodom and
[6:57] gomor were destroyed by fire and
[6:59] brimstone
[7:00] Abraham and his group were safe from
[7:02] harm and did not endure the wrath of God
[7:05] while lot was scarcely saved in the days
[7:08] of Noah Enoch was raptured well before
[7:11] the worldwide flood while Noah and his
[7:13] family were scarcely saved from the
[7:15] floods destruction praise the Lord that
[7:17] the Bride of Jesus Christ is passed from
[7:20] Death unto life and will be kept from
[7:22] the wrath of God reason number four
[7:26] Jesus thought the Rapture was imminent
[7:28] and unknown as an approaching Thief
[7:31] while other views such as the
[7:33] mid-tribulation or post-tribulation view
[7:35] can be numbered or counted the following
[7:38] scriptures teach this
[7:42] truth Jesus teaches an unknown day and
[7:45] hour for the Rapture in Matthew 2513 and
[7:48] Matthew
[7:50] 24:36 watch therefore for ye know
[7:53] neither the day nor the hour wherein the
[7:55] son of man cometh but of that day and
[7:57] hour knoweth no man no not the angels of
[8:00] heaven but my father
[8:02] only Jesus Christ comes as a thief to
[8:05] catch away or seize away or snatch away
[8:09] his wife the Bride of Jesus Christ this
[8:12] means the Rapture is a sudden secret
[8:14] snatching away of the true bride of
[8:16] Christ Matthew
[8:18] 24:43 but know this that if the good man
[8:21] of the house had known in what watch the
[8:23] thief would come he would have watched
[8:26] and would have not suffered his house to
[8:27] be broken up therefore be also ready for
[8:30] in such an hour as you think not the son
[8:33] of man
[8:34] cometh 1 Thessalonians 5:2 for
[8:38] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[8:39] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[8:42] night but ye Brethren are not in
[8:44] darkness that the day should overtake
[8:46] you as a thief remember therefore how
[8:49] thou Hast received and heard and hold
[8:51] fast and repent if thou therefore shalt
[8:54] not watch I will come on thee as a thief
[8:57] and thou shalt not know what hour I will
[8:59] come upon
[9:01] thee so we firmly believe the Rapture is
[9:04] imminent with an unknown day and hour
[9:06] and takes place before the tribulation
[9:09] other views and timelines of the Rapture
[9:12] such as mid-tribulation or
[9:13] post-tribulation can be numbered or
[9:16] counted meaning that Believers could
[9:18] potentially know the literal day when
[9:20] Christ May return because they contain
[9:22] either three and a half or 7 years which
[9:25] is based upon the 70 weeks of Daniel
[9:27] prophecy spoken of in Daniel chapter 9
[9:29] 9: 24- 27 and fulfilled by the 3 and 1/2
[9:33] year Ministry of the two witnesses of
[9:35] Revelation 11:
[9:37] 3-13 the pre-tribulation Rapture is the
[9:40] only teaching that allows Christ to
[9:42] return at an unknown day and hour before
[9:45] the worldwide
[9:46] tribulation reason number five the
[9:49] Rapture is the removal of the grace of
[9:51] God for the Gentiles in preparation for
[9:54] the revelation of the Antichrist and
[9:56] God's return to the Jewish people the
[9:59] following scriptures teach this truth
[10:01] Luke 21:24 Romans 11:
[10:04] 23-26 2 Thessalonians 2: 3-2 and Genesis
[10:10] 63 right now we are living in the times
[10:12] of the Gentiles according to Luke 21:24
[10:16] for God has blinded Israel from
[10:17] recognizing Christ as the Messiah
[10:19] according to Romans
[10:21] 11:25 the Gentiles are receiving the
[10:23] grace of God and our Lord Jesus Christ
[10:26] through the powerful Ministry of the
[10:27] Holy Ghost but the end of this period of
[10:29] Grace will soon end and then God will
[10:32] remove his holy ghost from the Gentiles
[10:34] and return to the Jews before God
[10:36] removes his grace from the Gentiles he
[10:38] will Rapture his Gentile bride after the
[10:41] Rapture he will first return to and be
[10:44] received by his people Israel before he
[10:46] pours out his wrath upon the rest of the
[10:48] world the Antichrist cannot work upon
[10:50] the Earth until after the Bride of Jesus
[10:53] Christ is raptured Off the Earth in 2
[10:55] Thessalonians 2: 3-6 give a great
[10:58] descript destion of the Antichrist verse
[11:01] 7 is very important for understanding
[11:03] the timing of the Antichrist 2
[11:05] Thessalonians 2:7 for the mystery of
[11:07] iniquity doth already work only he
[11:10] referring to God who now leth will let
[11:14] until he which is the holy ghost or
[11:17] Christ spirit in the Believers be taken
[11:19] out of the
[11:20] way in verse eight we find an important
[11:23] scripture and then shall that Wicked be
[11:25] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[11:28] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[11:29] destroy with the brightness of his
[11:33] coming so we can clearly see that the
[11:36] Antichrist is not revealed until the
[11:38] True Believers are taken out of the way
[11:40] just as in the days of Noah God will
[11:43] eventually end his long suffering upon
[11:44] the disobedient and remove his grace
[11:47] from the earth Divine wrath is all that
[11:49] is left for those who did not love the
[11:51] truth of the Holy Bible Genesis 6:3 and
[11:54] the Lord said my spirit shall not always
[11:56] strive with man for that he also is
[11:58] flesh
[11:59] yet his day shall be 120
[12:02] years if you would like more Bible
[12:04] teaching about how the Rapture is
[12:06] pre-tribulation please contact

[12:13] the desire of your heart
