[0:11] greetings friends in the Holy Name of
[0:14] Jesus Christ the purpose of this video
[0:17] is to teach what true repentance from
[0:19] sin really is according to the Bible we
[0:23] believe there is a great need to teach
[0:25] on this topic for Jesus said few not
[0:28] many will find the narrow way that leads
[0:31] to life in Matthew
[0:33] 7:14 he said this because he knew the
[0:35] world would love Darkness or sin more
[0:38] than light which is the word of God
[0:41] Christ Jesus also said that he would
[0:43] have to tell many on the day of judgment
[0:46] that he never knew them and yet these
[0:48] many people had prophesied cast out
[0:51] devils and did many wonderful Works in
[0:54] his
[0:55] name thankfully Jesus told us the reason
[0:58] the many who did the wonderful works for
[1:01] the name of Jesus were rejected on the
[1:03] day of judgment sadly they were also
[1:06] workers of iniquity according to Matthew
[1:09] 7:23 iniquity means wickedness and they
[1:12] did not do the will of God which is the
[1:14] word of God according to verse 21 yet
[1:17] these many people had works or actions
[1:21] that led them to think God was with them
[1:23] but their lives also had wickedness and
[1:25] sin so they never even obtained true
[1:28] repentance before God
[1:30] this teaches us that many people today
[1:33] will do works for Jesus without
[1:35] experiencing true repentance from their
[1:37] sins because the teaching on repentance
[1:40] in many churches is so watered down and
[1:44] incomplete as we will show repentance is
[1:47] more than just saying sorry for your
[1:49] sins and saying a quick scripted recited
[1:52] prayer we want you and as many as the
[1:55] Lord will call us to share this gospel
[1:57] video with to experience true repentance
[1:59] rep from your sins that you might know
[2:02] Jesus in the power of his resurrection
[2:05] according to Philippians 3:10 and also
[2:07] that you might become a new creature in
[2:09] Christ Jesus according to Galatians
[2:17] 6:15 we begin at the birth of the New
[2:20] Testament Church on the day of Pentecost
[2:23] when St Peter said this when he was
[2:25] asked by Sinners what they should do for
[2:27] salvation then Peter said unto them
[2:30] repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:32] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:34] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[2:36] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[2:38] promise is unto you and to your children
[2:41] and to all that are far off even as many
[2:43] as the Lord Our God shall call notice
[2:46] that repentance along with water baptism
[2:49] was the first step in becoming a
[2:50] follower of Jesus Christ Our video on
[2:53] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[2:55] Jesus Christ is available on our website
[2:57] for viewing but this video you're
[2:59] watching now on repentance from sin is
[3:02] actually a prerequisite video to water
[3:04] baptism being baptized in water and
[3:07] doing other works in the name of Jesus
[3:09] is meaningless unless the heart of the
[3:11] sinner has been changed by a true Act of
[3:14] repentance repentance is a crucial first
[3:16] step in your salvation as it was a major
[3:19] part of the preaching ministries of
[3:20] Jesus and John the Baptist as both
[3:23] preach repentance from their sins in
[3:25] Mark 1:15 Matthew 4:17 and Matthew 3
[3:31] :8 for example John the Baptist told
[3:34] everyone to repent even Herod Antipas
[3:37] the political leader of Galilee John
[3:39] told Herod that his marriage wasn't
[3:41] lawful but Herod didn't repent and
[3:43] remained in a sinful marriage his
[3:45] marriage did not please God as he was
[3:47] married to his living brother's former
[3:49] wife herodias this marriage made Herod
[3:52] an adulterer Herod would not repent at
[3:55] the words of a prophet of God what if
[3:58] Jesus told you today your marriage or
[4:00] current relationship was unlawful would
[4:03] you repent and change your life in order
[4:04] to please God do each of us love Jesus
[4:07] that much and is our repentance that
[4:10] sincere we will now examine repentance
[4:13] by teaching what true repentance is how
[4:16] repentance happens what we must repent
[4:18] of how the cross leads us to repentance
[4:21] and a call for True
[4:28] repentance what what is true repentance
[4:31] looking at the word repent in the Greek
[4:33] Lexicon gives us a definition to start
[4:35] with to change one's mind for better
[4:38] heartily to amend with abhorrence of
[4:41] one's past
[4:42] sins there are three aspects to genuine
[4:45] repentance that we will bring out of
[4:47] this definition and each is fully
[4:49] supported in
[4:50] scripture the first is changing one's
[4:53] mind about their sins the second is
[4:55] heartily making amends for one's sins
[4:58] and the third is abhor or hating past
[5:01] sins the first concept of repentance as
[5:04] a change of mind is Illustrated
[5:06] beautifully through the teaching of the
[5:08] Lord Jesus in Matthew 21:
[5:12] 25-32 Jesus tells the parable of two
[5:14] sons and their father's Vineyard the
[5:16] father asked his two sons to work in the
[5:18] vineyard the first son said I will not
[5:21] but afterward he repented and went to
[5:23] work the first son changed his mind or
[5:26] repented and it was displayed through
[5:28] his actions he literally went to work
[5:30] for his father after saying he would not
[5:33] the second son said he would work but
[5:35] did not his actions did not line up with
[5:38] his words the second son is an example
[5:41] of many professed Christians today who
[5:43] say I believe in Jesus and I repented of
[5:45] my sins but if their actions towards sin
[5:48] do not back up their words then they
[5:50] have spoken in vain if we say we
[5:53] repented then we must leave our sins
[5:55] behind us and go to work for Jesus in
[5:57] his Vineyard
[5:59] if we love Jesus then the Bible said it
[6:02] is not Grievous or burdensome or hard to
[6:05] leave our sins behind and to keep God's
[6:07] Commandments 1 John 53 and4 say for this
[6:11] is the love of God that we keep his
[6:13] Commandments and his Commandments are
[6:15] not Grievous or burdensome or hard for
[6:19] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[6:21] world and this is the victory that
[6:23] overcometh the world even our
[6:26] faith the next two parts of repentance
[6:29] deal with heartily making amends for sin
[6:32] and also abhorring or hating your sins
[6:36] these two parts of repentance are also
[6:38] seen displayed in the scripture zakus
[6:41] hardly made amends for his sin of
[6:44] extortion and stealing money from people
[6:47] by restoring the money he had taken
[6:49] zakus returned four times the amount he
[6:52] stole from those that He sinned against
[6:54] according to Luke
[6:55] 19:8 that was true repentance According
[6:58] To Jesus himself your self as for
[7:01] abhorring or hating your past sins St
[7:04] Paul taught us to hate our past sins and
[7:06] current sins in Romans
[7:08] 7:15 St Paul also taught us to have
[7:11] Godly sorrow towards sin in our lives
[7:13] which will lead to a Zeal to obey Jesus
[7:16] 2 Corinthians 7: 10 and 11 says that
[7:20] Godly sorrow produces a carefulness or
[7:22] earnestness to be clear or pure from
[7:28] sin last lastly St Paul wrote in Romans
[7:31] 6:21 that we would feel ashamed of our
[7:33] past sins of course when someone repents
[7:36] for the first time they will have a huge
[7:39] load of Shame due to this massive shame
[7:41] and guilt the true repentant believer
[7:44] will weep their way to Salvation and
[7:46] forgiveness as the Bible teaches us in
[7:48] the following passages out of Luke 7:
[7:52] 37-48 and James 4:
[7:55] 1-10 in Luke 7: 37-48
[7:59] the woman who brought an alabaster box
[8:01] of ointment to Simon the Pharisees house
[8:04] was so ashamed of her sins that she
[8:06] wased Jesus's feet with her tears and
[8:09] wiped his feet with her long hair Jesus
[8:12] told her thy sins are forgiven in verse
[8:15] 44 and that she loved him much in verse
[8:18] 47 this teaches us that true love for
[8:21] Jesus Will weep in Thanksgiving at his
[8:24] feet for the mercy he shown in dying for
[8:27] our sins and raising for our
[8:29] justification ation the woman stayed at
[8:31] the feet of Jesus until she heard Jesus
[8:33] say her sins were forgiven we can do the
[8:36] same today because the Bible teaches
[8:38] that the holy spirit will give us a
[8:40] witness to our spirits that we are the
[8:42] children of God we must pray until we
[8:45] feel fully surrendered and the spirit
[8:48] will speak the same words that Jesus
[8:50] spoke to our hearts your sins which are
[8:53] many are
[8:55] forgiven James 4: 1-10 gives us us
[8:59] another powerful teaching on how to
[9:01] repent and draw nigh to God James wrote
[9:04] be afflicted and mourn and weep let your
[9:07] laughter be turned to mourning and your
[9:09] joy to heaviness humble yourselves in
[9:12] the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift
[9:15] you
[9:16] up God doesn't want a dried dyed
[9:19] confession with only an intellectual
[9:21] experience of reciting a prayer of
[9:24] repentance God wants an experience of
[9:26] you and I truly repenting from our sins
[9:29] being fully devoted to walk away from
[9:31] our sins and expressing our great love
[9:34] and thankfulness for Jesus's Grace like
[9:36] the woman with the alabaster box
