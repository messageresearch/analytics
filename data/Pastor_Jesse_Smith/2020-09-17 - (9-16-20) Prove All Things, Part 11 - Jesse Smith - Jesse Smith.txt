[Music] in jesus christ [Music] let's go to acts chapter 17. i'd like to go back and look at that series prove all things uh since we had the debate on saturday i like to just kind of follow up a little bit on that and just look at some scriptures tonight and preach that by the grace of the lord so acts 17 verse 1 and 2. let's read that for our text here tonight now this we know this happened right after uh paul left uh philippi as we've been preaching on lately by god's grace uh acts 17 1-2 well i mean we might we might read a little bit more why don't we read one to four because it kind of gives the the whole context and we'll try to watch our time here tonight by god's grace acts 17 1-4 i'll read verse one and then we can all read verse two i'll read verse one now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollyonia they came to thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the jews let's all read verse two on three one two three and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures now i'll just read three and four because it's a little bit longer there opening and alleging that christ must have needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few praise god let's add one more word of prayer as we approach uh god's word here tonight let's have uh a moment uh uh communing with our lord again heavenly father we realize lord the word commune means to talk to so lord we commune with you again tonight lord god we thank you for the songs we ask the lord you bless us reading of your word lord god bless it to our hearts as we see where we are lord and as far as prophetically lord in the laodicean church age right before your coming and father we're earnestly contending for the faith which was once delivered to the saints and so father we're grateful lord to contend lord for your word and we ask oh god you'll bless us here tonight in jesus christ's name the saint said amen praise god maybe seated by god's grace so let's look here uh at the scripture and we will uh preach on prove all things part 11 the last time i preached i think was back in april and uh i remember i looked it up it was uh um god is our absolute i preached it from our house i think it was part of the the coveted time being at home uh so i remember one of the pastors called me up and thanked me for preaching that afterwards they enjoyed that message so let's go to acts uh we'll say in acts 17. we'll just make a few comments here by god's grace so paul leaves uh philippi and uh we know he here here he goes to thessalonica and i like verse two i think that's the main thing i want to emphasize there is that paul uh had a custom so this was paul's i believe second missionary trip if i'm not mistaken either second or third can't quite remember but paul's manner and that word manner means his custom or his habit and you probably remember luke four remember what was jesus's custom every synagogue he went into the sabbath praise god and so paul has the same custom as jesus christ his custom was to go into the synagogue there was no of course christian churches uh here paul's on a missionary journey and he's trying to tell the jews who had the latest message of the hour he was trying to tell him about the latest message of the hour which was jesus christ and so paul's habit is to go in unto them and reason with them out of the scriptures now let's look at that word reason uh it's the word uh the greek word dial egg i'm a a he so that's the best i can say it it means to converse or discourse i'm sorry discourse with one argue or discuss it means uh mingle thought with thought to ponder to revolve in your mind so we know synagogues had a very similar uh set up as churches do today they would have songs they'd have a a leader they would have someone who would read out of the scriptures they read out of moses right every synagogue and then we know it was part of the habit to call men now of course it was men only they would call men only and come up and read the scrolls and we know in luke 4 jesus got the opportunity to come up and jesus sat down and everybody could tell after he read every everybody could tell there was something different about this time and then he said this day this scripture is fulfilled praise god and uh the bible said they all turned to look at him and uh and then they got upset with him and they chased him out of the church for saying that i have fulfilled these scriptures and we know that they took them to the cliff but yet we know jesus somehow uh even without a glorified body somehow was able to blind them and walk through them praise god because it was not yet his time in church what a consolation god won't let us go before it's our time praise god no matter if a whole multitude comes against you as we saw with george washington last year he had bullet holes in his jacket and he would come back from the battles and the bullets pierced the the the jacket but not his skin they i don't know how that's even possible but history records that he even wrote letters in his own journal about that you and i cannot go until it's our time to go praise god thank god amen that god is going to protect us and jesus could not be taken until it was his time but yet he constantly he went to church every time the church doors were open amen and on paul's missionary journeys he said well if i if i if if i don't have a local church to go to i'll go to the last the latest message before the christian message i'll go to the jewish synagogue and notice church he reasoned he argued or discussed or conversed with them now we know there's many quotes brother bam says he don't believe in debating praise god you don't believe in debating with the wrong attitude right and so paul if the scripture says he reasoned and he debated then we know he didn't do it with the evil intent right in other words paul didn't debate with them to try to send them to hell right paul debated with them in order to convince them or persuade them that jesus had fulfilled the scripture now isn't that interesting church a prophet of god was anointed of the holy spirit to debate with jews and not everybody believed right not everybody believed and if we know that was the birth of the church and that was where they had the most converts yet we're at the end uh of the church age where very few are going to find it and paul saves some of his how many are we going to save well probably very few right probably very very few because the bible said in verse 4 only some of them believed and they consorted with paul and silas so it wasn't many it was uh just some and so we can see how paul paul had could do miracles paul had many miracles in his ministry many many but yet in many cases god didn't give him miracles every time he preached the word uh we know three saturdays in a row he went in there and then he would obviously have to wait his turn right and then he would have to he'd have to share the scriptures from the old testament where christ had fulfilled that and try to prove to them uh that it was fulfilled now notice here's a man let me move this over here here's a man church that had seen jesus he'd seen the pillar of fire but could he convince everybody of that no he could only convince some of them he could only convince the elected praise god in other words the four known the ones god god foreknew that wanted the truth that wanted to believe in a living god not just a dead letter not just a moses uh circumcision works based uh a covenant god for knew that there would only be some that really wanted to serve a living god and wasn't interested in legalism and wasn't interested uh in self-righteousness but really was interested in the righteousness of god oh and i believe there are some today that are still that way praise god they want to serve the living god they want to serve the god of the pillar of fire praise god and they have a desire for truth not for their righteousness but to inherit christ's righteousness and to live with his life with his holiness there are still people today like you and i that want to live that way amen thank god we're some of those praise god and so many people you know take those quotes where there are a few quotes brother braham says you know i don't believe in debating yet we know uh brother branham did have debates and he did attend at least a couple uh from the quotes brother branham said that jesus debated with the 12 priests when or the priest when he was 12 years old did you know that was a debate he's 12 years old and he's in the synagogue the temple right debating with the the doctors and the doctors are astonished at his answers so jesus was jesus debated right and if jesus could debate and do it with the right spirit paul could do it too because paul was filled with jesus spirit praise god and so that's one that many people forget and my brother cam shared one with me yesterday that you know uh brother bosworth wanted to have the debate with dr best right but brother man said no we're not going to be a part of that uh but brother bosworth begged him and said brother branham i'm just going to say with the scripture i'm just going to do it in love i'm going to i'm going to be very loving and brother man i said okay a church look at that brother is trying to talk him out of it but then he he changes his position uh uh brother bosworth goes and then brother branham doesn't stay at home he goes to the debate so people that they want to just take one quote like there's people that say well never do debates brother bam said we don't believe in debates yet brother branham agreed to it gave him permission to go and then attended the the debate and we all know what happened at the end praise god is that right they ask brother can you come down and pray for the the closing and brother man comes out and said how many are witnesses that divine healing's right and he said almost every hand went up in that houston coliseum in 1950 he said let's have a word of prayer and the man and dr best said go take a picture of the ram the man took seven pictures the first six were blank the seventh had the pillar of fire so let me tell you this church if people say they they don't they don't believe in debates well there's a debate that god attended amen there's a debate the pillar of fire attendant and the prophet praise god now the prophet wasn't the one debating right but the pillar of fire was there to settle the debate hallelujah amen but see you can't throw out acts 17 either you can't get rid of that right uh the message brothers message did not come to point us away from the bible it came to return us to the bible amen this was paul's manner if there's no message churches i'll go in and try to persuade them now today we got churches praise god so we don't have to go to where there are no churches and and try to convince them as i said we sent out what 1200 invitations two years ago in the summer of 2018 and two people come to church you know you can try to uh we can try to invite them so we'll keep trying by the grace of the lord so look only some a man who'd met the pillar of fire only some people believe him after debating the scripture so we know uh brother and says all hell is against this teaching praise god all hell's against it and so satan is going to be battling the masses bringing up any evil thought right any evil thing about paul no doubt satan was bringing that up all the bad parts about paul making paul look bad and just as they do it today they'll bring up all the human parts of brother branham won't they and try to and try to shift the debate and church that was uh part of the debate we'll get that in just a moment here here let me read another in 1961 brother brahm said he was in chicago 300 ministers stood there to debate him he said and the lord told me gave me a vision and told me where we'd be and what we do i stood before 300 trinitarian ministers and i said now if i am so wrong in this doctrine some of you man stand up here and show me where i'm wrong by the scripture without a textbook if there is no such a thing as a serpent seed or somebody like that i've been teaching just come here now and show me by the scriptures he said nobody he said nobody move because it can't be done that's true not to be different but it's just the truth it's the word he said no one can debate that that's the word of god nobody can do it amen and remember church in this story brother ma'am said lord i'm not going to go down and brother brahm said the holy spirit said don't fear go down i'll be with you amen in a debate see see so church what does it come down to debates or these things must be led by the holy spirit yes i would never go into a debate well i wouldn't want to go i might make a mistake but i wouldn't want to go into a debate without the leadership of the holy spirit right neither would paul in church the reason i did it was to try to win a soul but also to stand up and defend the gospel i was trying to win the soul back to the message of the hour and so it's scriptural paul did it now let's be there's there's numerous pictures let's go over a few more so you can see this wasn't something paul just did one time go the next chapter acts chapter 18. now he became a temp maker look at that a man who's seen the pillar of fire wouldn't let people feed him now look at that church look at think about preachers today this man of god who seen the pillar of fire would not let everybody work for him he went and worked for himself he wouldn't let them wait on him hand and foot that's the reason sister beatrice i like to do sweeping in the in the room over there because i don't want to become a callous preacher i don't want to become a prideful preacher please let me take out the trash sometime please please let me wipe the table sometimes because i don't want to become a self-righteous prideful preacher there's a reason paul did that remember he did it because he didn't want to hinder the flow of the gospel and you sisters have always done a great job of letting me do that so thank you always and all the saints have always let me do a good job nobody's ever ripped the bag out of my hand or rebuked me for trying to do that i realized church said i gotta stay humble and i realize that's one way god can help me to stay humble is to make myself a servant i'm not here to be served i'm here to serve that's what the word minister means right children you got we like that little uh we got a little play or not a play but an audio drama and the little girl asks what is a minister and the minister goes a servant and the girl goes oh you're you're my ser you're not my servant and i feel i feel so little every time i watch that yes i am supposed to serve you praise god and if not then i've got the wrong attitude and i'm backslidden if i haven't become the servant i have to be the servant i appreciate when other people serve but the reality of it is i've got to be the servant if i'm not the servant then something's wrong i must be the servant a minister serves and yes i minister the word i love doing that i love ministering song i get to do that tonight i love doing that but i want to serve in other ways too praise god so i don't get exalted or ever think i'm above something many people don't know it but i like to i like to scrub the toilets on saturday i don't tell that to many people and hardly anybody watches this anyway but that's what i like to do on saturday i like to bring the kids here when i got a free and just scrub the toilets and just make sure everything's clean and i like to do my part when there's a little grease spill on that wood floor in there i like to get on my hands and knees and scrub it because i know it keeps me humble of course our ties paid for that too that's why i like your ties paid for that's why i like to keep it clean ty's paid for these chairs you ties almost paid for everything in here because i know it's it's for god's glory it's all that he might be magnified praise god see paul was a servant he was a tet maker a man who'd seen the pillar fire can you imagine could sit by a poor on let's say a homeless man while he's making tents he can make tents too he never said well i'm greater than you i've seen the pillar of fire he could sit down and make tents with the temp maker hallelujah praise god now that's humility church that's humility and paul said i had to suffer the loss of all things that i might gain christ he had to lose all his pride all his prestige and that's my prayer i've said it before i prayed again god just take anything out of my life that that would make me be prideful humbly do whatever you can help me to be a humble servant for jesus christ paul was no uh paul was no king or lord he would remember he was rejected at the end of his ministry by asia look at 18 4 acts 18 4. paul had a job outside of preaching it was tent making so i got to remind myself of that so i don't have a pity party and get prideful i've had different people tell me that they say brother jess i can trust you more because you're out there you're working amongst the people you've got a battle and you've got to overcome well i said well praise the lord whatever god leads verse 4 and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath he didn't take a saturday off he would go in there and try to debate and talk and converse and persuaded the jews and the greeks now remember this is the story when they blast him he said fine he said you blasphemed i'm going to the gentiles yeah he said in verse 6 he goes he said i'm clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles and look god opened up another house there the house of justice that's at corinth yeah that's right the corinthian church this is the beginning of the corinthian church now notice he was afraid look at verse 9 and then spake the lord to paul in the night by the vision he's in corinth he's all afraid and he said be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i much people in this city praise god amen look at that church we're all human even a man that seen the pillar of fire sister beatrice was scared he was going to get arrested can you imagine that he'd seen the pillar of fire sister naomi ceda come in and he met the pillar of fire for three years in arabia and yet he still feared for his life oh this makes me feel so good that god understands my weaknesses and if i'm scared god's gonna encourage me and make me bold praise god in my little humble estate paul is way up here we're i'm way down here you you're probably higher than me but in my humble little state god care would care so much that he would encourage me and tell me not to fear for he's with me he promised never to leave me so he took every saturday he could on his missionary trips and then the holy spirit encouraged him said don't be afraid you're going to have a good revival in this city oh thank the lord what a revival praise god now go to the later to the end of the chapter verse 19. verse 19 and he came to ephesus and left them there and he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews everybody see a pattern here on this particular missionary trip this is how he started the philippian church right the thessalonica church right the letters to the thessalonians here the ephesians yeah god gave him miracles in some of these places but he after the miracle what'd he do he didn't sit back and said everybody give me your ties i'm just going to sit at home and read and relax he went out and made tents right and then he made sure on the sabbaths he made sure to go to the church and try to persuade people to believe that jesus is the christ he just used his argument his debate now not a not an evil argument right but just a good a good answer to a question his arguments right not not anything evil spirited but arguments in other words a good answer to a question so anybody says brother braham don't believe in debates well they don't know the quotes all of them and they don't know paul either because paul constantly was in debate now you remember this uh i preached a few weeks ago well probably months by now acts 24 25 he's with felix this rich man this ruler and he's almost persuades him to be a christian acts 24 25 oh i just saw a good scripture go to verse 13. oh this is just like brother branham man with that debate bless their hearts but that gentleman very nice gentleman sincerely wrong neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me isn't this it they're trying to accuse brother branham of lying about this they say brother ram never went to the graves brother ram never went to the vatican and church they can't even prove it they have no proof but i like it it just shows we got the right holy spirit right but the the wrong spirit will constantly accuse the true messengers of god see what they're trying to do they're trying to get their eyes off the word amen and i hope anybody that watches that debate that gets their eye on the word of god that we're pointing to praise god we're only pointing to the word of god hallelujah but there's all these distractions out there paul said they can't prove it if brother rand was here he they'd say he'd say they can't prove it they can't they weren't there they're looking at their dates and they're looking at uh plain logs right they're looking at uh visitors logs and they're looking at records from indiana you know people falling off a bridge they're looking at all these records from the coast guard and all these things like that like there's any record like brother jose told me yesterday where is jesus birth certificate anybody got it anybody got it well they must not have been so right there's no record of it anybody got moses moses birth certificate from egypt his 40 years of training as a military general anybody's got his uh his uh degrees anybody can anybody prove any of that there's no proof to that so i've said it before we can't make those things the absolute the absolute has to be the word of god something that's steadfast something that will never change the word of god amen hallelujah thank god paul constantly reasoned they can't prove what they talk about him now verse 20 24 24 and and after certain days verse 24 when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewish he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith of christ now look at that he wanted to hear it verse 25 and as he reason of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee and remember it was all about money verse 26. that's quite a thing to see people tremble under the presence of god when they tell them about judgment you tell them about the tribulation tell them about these things it makes someone who's sincere makes them tremble most people they laugh about it because they're on drugs or they're drinking alcohol or smoking marijuana or something like that most people don't want to hear it they don't tremble at the word of god but a sincere heart will tremble and look what he did he reasoned he tried to get them to see the truth of the scripture all right now i want to go back to a scripture we read go back to philippians 1 7 we preached it months ago philippians 1 7. now this is where i felt led to do the debate you know we always say the works that i do shall you do also right we always say that john 14 12. well what about paul what about paul's works well part of paul's works were debates right jesus jesus debated right he reasoned with the pharisees he debated well so did paul so that this is included in the works of the holy spirit see giving people a chance trying to persuade them to go to heaven in our case trying to get them to the rapture philippians 1 7. now verse 6 of course let's just read that because it makes us so thankful being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of christ thank you lord for not getting rid of me thank you lord that you're going to finish what you started verse seven even as is it is meat for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart in as much as both in my bonds and in defense and confirmation of the gospel ye are all partakers of my grace so remember we preached this and paul he was set for the defense of the gospel now defense is the greek word apologia and this word means answering for yourself clearing yourself verbal defense speech in defense a reason statement or argument so paul said i am set for the defense of the gospel i'm going to clear myself i'm going to give a verbal defense i'm going to defend the truth of god and then confirmation let's look up confirmation the action of confirming something or the state of being confirmed giving a verification or a proof or a testimony so it was for the defense and proof of the gospel amen glory and remember i remember when i preached it i was really fired up that morning sunday morning i still remember it and i and i and i remember preaching i said i believe with all my heart i'm a defender of the message i don't know if you remember that but as we're worshiping i got an email pop up on my ipad and it said uh the believed sign people are back and they're wanting to debate more people and so i took it right there i said right while i'm i just preached it right there now they're ready to start back up i said i'll take that debate because i was under the leadership of the holy spirit i was preaching the word of god i believed i was the defender of the gospel like paul and then i get an email right at the end and i've already got numerous good testimonies back people were really blessed they recognized i had the right spirit um they recognized i was using scripture and some people that even disagree with me and still say brother brahms are not a prophet they said at least you have the right spirit praise god so i thank the lord for that yes church we are to defend the message and remember the message is not everything on tape it's the word of god that god is fulfilling right now i'm going to read that quote just so everybody gots it i hope it's a familiar one to you so what is the message brother ram said he said many of you strangers hear these men get up and make remarks about a message of the hour and so forth what are they getting at is god's promise of this hour what he promised he would do and we see him scripturally of vindicating just exactly what he said he would do in the same manner he said foretold hits just exactly perfectly each time because it's god saying it amen thank the lord that's from the rapture 1965 what is what are these brothers talking about a message it's god's vindication scriptural vindication of what he would do in other words the message is prophecy that's being fulfilled right now and the prophecy came from the bible praise god amen that's what many people don't understand the message is not every thought on tape the message is the scripture god is fulfilling right now hallelujah that's what i'm defending that's what we're standing up for that's what we sacrificed everything for that's what we've left everything for is to defend the bible what god is doing right now amen and remember church if you put one two three four five six six scriptures together you come to this conclusion jesus remains in heaven and will not physically return to the earth until all things including bible doctrine and the hearts of believers are restored to their original apostolic conditions by the preaching of a prophet anointed with the spirit of elijah praise god if that ain't the bible truth i don't know what is amen what can what can and notice those people the debate they didn't say one thing about these scriptures amen they couldn't say one thing about these scriptures that we're reading that are speaking a prophecy being fulfilled now they can't say one thing about it why because they they can't handle it they can't believe it they got to stay away from it they'll point to everything that's not scripture right but you and i can point to the scripture he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify on me the scriptures are what testified to william branham and also for us the scripture is what testified of the bride amen getting ready for the rapture hallelujah the scripture testifies of that this restoration my the bible says the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established we got way more than two or three got a lot more than that pull up uh lydia if you could uh matthew 13 34 and 35. i referenced this but i didn't go over it really deeply i don't know if i've ever taught this here at the church but um maybe i did i can't remember of all these things make jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto them a parable of course is a story that tells a truth it may not even be a true story right but it tells a truth okay now next scripture verse 35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world now just leave that up there for a moment huh remember the pharisees and sadducees had their mishna remember the mishnah it was the the rabbis traditions of what the word meant so they studied their books right their interpretation more than the word of god right and they're so smart and they're scribes and they're just you know they're they're copying both the scrolls and the mishnah but they love their mishnah right you gotta wash your hands and you have to wear these fringes so far and do certain things right the things they could do the things their flesh could do right they were so concerned about that and god sends jesus not to go to the mishnah but just to tell humble stories right stories about uh trees right stories about planting in the field and four different kinds of grounds just a common common story but yet it opened up the revelation of four different kinds of people praise god four classes of people he preaches just on wheat and tares and a common ophio and open up the mystery of the serpent seed praise god amen just these simple humble stories a woman baking bread and injecting three measures three little measuring cups of leaven into it and that's the roman catholic church putting in the father son holy ghost and it perverts the whole bread right but just and they're like huh interesting he does a lot of miracles but he just tells these simple child-like stories but god said that's how i want it i want the humble believer just to be able to see the miracles and then hear the voice and catch it that we don't add any leaven to the word of god the word of god is unleavened amen hallelujah the real bride the real woman the real church of god she doesn't answer any leaven it's just word only praise god thank the lord hallelujah that's us church that's you and i the bride who's got the real bread of god the unleavened bread the bible says let us keep the feast of unleavened bread of sincerity and truth that's us huh so the bible said jesus would use parables huh i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation world he sure did when he uttered father son holy ghost nobody had ever uttered that before thank you jesus praise god what was jesus speaking and he uh the bible calls it enigma the bible calls it a dark saying jesus was speaking in a riddle that's what the bible calls it you want to see that in the scripture let's go to psalm 78 2-3 so matthew 13 35 fulfilled by the prophet right spoken by the prophet go to psalm 78 2-3 see if it was david or another prophet i didn't get a chance to look that one up psalm 78 2-3 so which prophet said jesus was going to teach in riddles which prophet and which scripture was it oh this is asaph okay so one of the songwriters bible called him a prophet look at verse one give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth you see that church incline what's that i mean humble yourself right incline everybody just wants to hear what they want to hear but the bible said you got to humble yourself get listened closely right it's a still small voice verse two i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old just leave that up there uh verse two yeah sorry well go and read three which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us oh glory okay go to verse two okay so uh this is the scripture matthew was referring to i will utter dark sayings in the hebrew this means enigma which which means a riddle how many people like riddles you like solving riddles god said i'm going to anoint my son and he's going to teach parables kids stories and he's going to teach and he's going to speak in riddles enigmas that smart people can't figure out and the bible said they'd be secrets not uttered from the foundation of the world praise god see because he knew how smart and how intelligent people would be but they would miss the very humble meanings of the parables and they wouldn't be able to figure out the riddle of the word of god they wouldn't want to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god rather than just believing in searching the scripture they just wrote their own interpretation to give themselves power and authority right help to make everybody else serve them their interpretation of it but god said i'm going to send my son to speak in parables he's going to speak uh child stories and the meanings will have to be spiritually discerned by the holy spirit praise god now i'm going to speak in riddles where uh the natural mind can't understand it because the natural things receiveth not the things of the holy spirit thank the lord things not uttered from the foundation of the world as far as i know church the father son holy ghost was one of those it was never uttered the they never wrote it in all the old testament where they said father the one name of the father son and holy ghost also the mysteries of the seven seals right if you look at the book of the old testament where did the old testament ever talk about seven seals right he never talked about that there was all these things that were gonna come over that were never uttered the first time they were uttered through men like paul and peter and john and of course the lord jesus teaching all the parables praise god oh my thank the lord all these parables about weddings and suppers oh come on church this whole thing was about jesus getting a bride amen never uttered before this whole thing is about jesus finding a bride who would give him preeminence a bride that would put on the wedding garment right be dressed in the righteousness of the king praise god a bride that would uh pack extra oil and wisdom right we looked at wisdom on sunday night she'd be wise and then she would she'd be awake right she'd get woken up she'd have her lamp trim extra oil should go out to meet him because there's a wedding coming these mysteries these riddles and you gotta look at each and every one and you get one great picture praise god you get jesus christ giving his grace to the gentiles to redeem a bride before he turns back to the jews i know that simple church but that's what he was doing praise god that's what he was doing the riddles of old praise god all right almost done here so i want to make sure i read that there so everybody could see that okay now next we're we're defenders of the gospel we have to have an answer uh lydia when you're ready first peter 3 15. i think it's wrong for preachers not to answer questions unless they feel that of the holy spirit not to i mean there are some times you know uh you know jesus was silent right at his crucifixion but that was prophecy a memory silent before herod and that was prophecy as a sheep uh dumb before it cheers so there are times to be silent where you don't answer back right cast not your pearls before swine there are times you do that you don't do that rather but peter now isn't this interesting of all men peter who denied christ who couldn't give an answer once he got the holy ghost he said you need to give an answer oh glory first peter 3 15. now let's read 14 again to remember this is about suffering but and if you suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled in other words you're gonna you're gonna suffer and then people are gonna try to terrorize you so when you're getting terrorized or falsely accused verse 15 but sanctify the lord god in your heart so set aside the lord in your heart and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear so there's going to be people that make fun of you in this case they're going to beat you they're going to put you in prison that's what he's talking about when you're suffering for god's sake he said but have have a special place in your heart for the lord and be ready you know you're getting beat for christ's sake so as you're getting accused always have an answer ready because of the hope that you have within you why would you let yourself get uh abused or beaten up or made fun of why would you let yourself get trampled on because jesus christ is our living hope praise god amen it's a new kind of hope it's a living hope the bible says in the book of hebrews i love that song too we have a hope and so peter says even if you're getting beaten up he said be ready to answer ever not some men right every man be ready to answer every man and so that's why i even admitted on the on the uh the debate i said the reason i didn't do it i said i was afraid right i said i wasn't ready to debate i didn't know the answers i said i was given all my time to study in the doctrine you know the word of god brother man's doctrines i said i didn't he had he has over 500 pages of accusations against brother branham i can't go through 500 i can't go through all 500 i'll get to him as i i get to him as i feel out of the lord so i was just honest i was afraid i didn't know but as time goes on church we learn to have an answer and i do have to i'd have to correct that i did the next year i think in 2013 i made a document and i shared it with many of the brothers in pennsylvania uh because in 2013 i started my youtube channel and i started making certain videos to answer some of their false doctrines like no women angels no women preachers that was one of them and i tried to give answers for all the other beliefs that we have like long long hair long dresses and no makeup and all these and the three works of grace boy they don't like the three words of grace but we love it praise god it explains the whole bible praise god and so see church we must be ready always and what i found with with debating these these this group of people is that my regular answer is you're probably jumping to a clue conclusion you can't prove that uh and let's get back to the word because they they normally stay away from the word because they know they can't win they can't win that one the one regret i had sisters i wish i could have thought of this earlier i wish i would have just i think i said on sunday i wish i would have said show me one scripture where god ever asked the godly woman to cut her hair i said if not then that's thus saith the lord and it just so happened brother adam said that's thus saith the lord like if it's thus saith the lord nobody can stand before it if it's true then then nobody can say any word against it show me one scripture where a woman a godly woman put on paint on her face you ain't gonna find it show me one time where a man ever said you repent and you're baptized and now you're instantly filled with the holy ghost and now you never found that they had to wait they had to tarry right they had to tarry for the holy ghost you always find that you always had to wait till sometime after they believed nobody ever got it just going from a sinner to a saint not even paul paul believed and he was blind three days remember and then the bible said after that he repented and then the bible says he got baptized and then later got the holy ghost even paul so it just uh it just goes to show church that we have the word we must defend it we must earnestly contend for the faith that was delivered to the saints because i don't i don't know did you listen to it naomi beatrice did you listen to the debate at all okay that's fine you don't have to i'm gonna go over a little bit but they're to the spot where they don't condem they don't condemn homosexuality bestiality and they don't condemn cross-dressing transgender they don't they don't condemn any of that and i said well i'm not condemning them like to hell but i'm saying they're wrong and i'm warning them that if they don't repent they are going to suffer but their thing is oh the gospel didn't come to condemn and i said well that's true i said the gospel came to warn and i'm warning them i just wanted to hear can you say it's wrong and they wouldn't say it they wouldn't say it so what is that that's the wrong spirit see we must defend the gospel the gospel is good news but you don't know the the good news until you know the bad news that your sins are uh taking you to hell because you're in love with sin you're loved with darkness and so you don't want to be with god you want to be separated from god and so god will let you if you don't want to be in his presence he'll let you be in darkness but his grace is reaching out to pull you out of the darkness amen praise god all right let me close with this let me just read parts of my uh opening statement and then i'm going to keep listening to it and go through and pull out the things i wish i would have said because i think it'd be beneficial now church it is going to be beneficial because i know well i don't know but i was told we'll probably do more debates in the future so i want to store up answers to the things i i didn't feel like i did good on and i want to uh store them up so i have them later and i think it's a good thing to do the scripture of course tells us to do that uh to always have an answer all right so i started off just by giving god glory i'm nothing without him john 15 5. i s remember i got the questions two days before the debate the brother sent them a month but then the the moderator forgot to email them to me i should have had them a long time ago but anyways i had two days and i didn't get to study until saturday morning because i had work we're busy thursday friday it was just a really busy week last week so i basically had two days to look up i said if i don't have an answer or a question forgive me i'll do my best to follow up and i define the message the bible prophecies god is fulfilling right now i said it's heresy to make every word brother branham said thus saith the lord it is so we have to rightly divide the word of truth and we have to search the scriptures daily like acts 17 11. i shared how brother branham spearheaded the revival starting in 1946 he was the first giant of that age then i shared how god hides himself and then i shared all the thus saith the lords that we have on the 12 doctrines that are called mysteries six of them have thus saith the lord six and half of them have thus saith the lord backing them up that they are absolutely true and they didn't say one thing about any of that they didn't say one thing about the thus saith the lord mysteries and maybe we'll do that later and then i ended my 10-minute opening saying what the message has done for me because i've listened to almost all their podcasts they at the end they always ask them how do you feel now that you've left the message they say oh i'm so full of love now and i'm so free and everything how can you be free breaking the word of god i don't know and i say that love i'm not condemning them that's the point i'm making how can you be free breaking the word of god now maybe maybe they went to a really bad message church that was really in sin like that did child abuse like some of them actually left churches like that that had child abuse in the mess of churches but that's from the that's from satan that's from hell so maybe in one way yeah maybe they feel free from that that spirit of child abuse thank god but there's no way they can be totally free in the holy spirit when they're getting sprinkled and putting on men's clothing right how how how can they do that telling everybody that just says a prayer you're filled with the holy ghost and they don't even cry a tear when they when they get even say that there's there's no death right we know we're dead in sins right we're dead in sins but they have to die to the things of the world and be born again praise god and there's no happiness there's no joy when they say the holy spirit comes upon them repeat after me i'll do the romans road they say romans wrote i'm all guilty of the sins and now i'm a new new creature in christ and all these things and yet not even shed a tear not even be grateful when eternal life comes into you and you don't even feel it come on you know you have no emotion when the living god comes to dwell in your soul when you pass from death unto life and you will not come in there any condemnation on the day of judgment and you can't get happy at all something's wrong god never came they just recited a man's creed not to me church this is coming new to me this is one of the biggest sins that people that leave the message commit they get rid of the three works of grace can you imagine the evil can you imagine the judgments those preachers got to face telling children when they're eight five and six years old get baptized you're filled with the holy ghost and most will go out and smoke and drink and get right in the worldly music we've all seen it haven't we we've i saw so many my friends in high school i saw one of my closest friends or one of my the friends i most admired because he could live a denominational pentecostal life and i couldn't in our church he was so pure to god and he was i made fun of him even as a christian at times and i felt i apologize to him later but you know what church he played he played piano he was a good guy you know what happened to him he went to new york and he became a homosexual and yet their church or our my former church told him he was filled with the holy ghost now church isn't that one of the most awful crimes against christian against christianity that three works of grace is so important jesus said it's like a wheat seed right uh the tassel the i'm sorry the stalk and then the stem stock and then the corn the corn of wheat i've seen it i've seen man so many people baptize and then fall away because they tell them they got it and then they they stop hungering for god but anybody that loves god wants more of him praise god and remember the sin of this day is laodicea saying i'm i'm good i'm rich and increase the goods i don't have no more need of god but the real believer says i need him every hour praise god amen they never hunger and thirst they feel bad for their sins so they come up and get baptized and they go down a dry center come up a wet one right that's really what happens in most cases to me these three works of grace is becoming more and more important ezekiel said new heart new spirit my spirit it's all down through the scripture this is becoming one of the greatest sins i'm seeing amongst people that leave the message because now like we said these these fine people but now they're so quick to condemn brother branham they're so quick to say he's a liar he's a deceiver he's a charlatan and they mock and make fun of him and yet a united states senator who was paralyzed rose to his feet under the power of god through that man's ministry amen and they're so that's what the bible said they'll be so quick to even condemn satan though uh they'll speak evil dignitaries remember we looked at that a few weeks ago these these people that are they're lost and they're not afraid to speak evil against god's anointed when was the last time they raised up a paralyzed man out of a wheelchair i've never done that when was last time they cured tuberculosis which i met the woman who was cured of it and it's on tape the ramp told her name of jesus christ i rebuke satan go away yourself two mondays in a row and you'll see her gain weight it happened he told her the future they're so quick and so i ended that with that so they say uh they ask all these oh we're so free now we're so we're so happy and we have to worry about uh brother branham and all these things like that and i said well here let me tell you what the message has done for me [Laughter] i said it's transformed my life i said i now have a true relationship with jesus christ because i lived church i lived the church life i i went to church i tried to act good in front of the youth pastor right i tried to act good in front of the church i tried to act like i was a nice guy but i cussed and i cursed and i hated everybody and had all these i was an awful mouth cussed like a sailor and i said i know i said as soon as i was baptized in jesus christ's name i never uttered one more cuss word and that's all sister beatrice that's all that flowed out of my mouth can you imagine that thank god for his grace that's the first thing i saw go after why i cut my hair first that's the first thing that went was my hair next i got baptized and i started seeing i remember i had a voice recorder and i would say acts 2 38 and listen to it until i memorized it i was on fire i said it brought me out of my denominational creeds we believe tongues was the evidence delivered me from all my addictions the pornography the cigarettes chewing tobacco drinking alcohol idolizing sports sinful movies wwf w wrestling overeating binging on food i said it delivered me all from that and all i want to do now is i want to try to get somebody to believe jesus christ that's all i want to do now and so they couldn't say anything about that but that's okay let's say to our feet it's already 8 30. let me close with that we're proving all things by god's grace proving all things does the gospel need offended well yes jesus wants us to defend it earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered and again i love those brothers i'm glad i got to talk to them um i want to look at that earnestly contending uh up real quick just to look at the greek here bear with me just one more scripture earnestly contend doesn't have a separate definition so i have to look it up earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to this yeah i got it but yeah thank you but i do got it i was looking for a different greek definition but it's just the same words earnestly content so i have to look it up in another concordance there how many believe we still need to fight for the faith to keep it pure to stand up for it george i don't know i don't know i don't know how it's going to go but i know there's going to be a showdown right there's going to be showdown between jesus and denominations brother braham says that before the rapture there's a showdown in elijah's day showdown in jesus day there's another showdown coming and so i feel like god is preparing us to stand up for what we believe that's what i believe and again whoever would have thought i would have been the message preacher to be the first one to stand up i'm not worthy i i listened i made so many mistakes with my words i'm not the one to do it but it had to be somebody praise god and so i feel like god is allowing us to have an understanding on how to answer these questions and to defend the message right and the messenger because i forgot that scripture paul said be not ashamed of me remember we looked at that a while ago let me pull it up here second timothy 1 8 be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner i'm not ashamed of brother brahm that's that's what they said they said aren't you ashamed of his credibility i said credibility this is a man that raised up a paralyzed man sounds pretty credible to me right he prayed for a woman who had tuberculosis she got healed that sounds pretty incredible to me he pointed me to the serpent seed and the water baptism in one god one person right in the bible that seems pretty credible to me but we can't get our eyes off what we're contending for we're fighting for the faith that was once delivered to the saints that's what we're fighting for just like brother bram's life yeah you can find mistakes just like you'd find in mine but that's not what we're fighting for there's going to be no boasting on the day of judgment well i i never exaggerated can you imagine these people bastion brother branham for just exaggerating well what they've cruci they've killed people with their words right they've killed their uh killed their influence which is the same as murder so we're not contending for our faith we're contending for the faith of christ praise god i want to start preaching on this so i don't leave it out i don't i don't want to go too far without going through it let's have a word of prayer here tonight father in heaven we just love you tonight dear god we thank you for this refreshing lord as we go come back and look at paul's life and his debate uh his debate habit lord god the lord we know paul did it in
