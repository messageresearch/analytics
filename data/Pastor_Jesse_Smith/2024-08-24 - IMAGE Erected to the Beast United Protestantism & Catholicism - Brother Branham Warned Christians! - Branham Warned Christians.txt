TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] don't you never try to fight communism fight romanism that's thus sayth the Lord hallelujah the Lord said romanism is go to rule not communism greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to look at the image of the Beast spoken of in Revelation 13: 11-18 this image unto the Beast is a World Council of churches it's Protestant churches United with Catholicism as taught by God's Prophet The Late William Brenham 1909 to 1965 this video is the fifth video in a series of videos on the mark of the beast the series was started in July 2024 with the mark of the beast from Cain to the present time and then the mark of the beast during the Great Tribulation period and then we looked at the mark of his name and then most recently we looked at the number of the Beast 666 hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he first revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William brandham also defend William branham's Godly Christian character I'm going to begin by reading a little portion from my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed it's on pages is 595 and 596 Revelation 13: 14- 15 unveils the beast's plan for Humanity to make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live remember the wound By The Sword was the fall of the Pagan Imperial Roman Empire but then the Beast continued to live through the paple Empire or the Roman Catholic Church since the Beast or Spirit of Rome is invisible it seeks an image for itself which will be a worldwide ecunemical Council all these false Protestant churches will get together in a union with the Roman Catholic Church it seems likely that the World Council of churches will be the main component of this worldwide image unto the Beast because this organization currently represents nearly 500 million Christians and literally seeks visible Unity or an image for Christians and you can find that on their website it's on the about us page they're seeking a visible Unity they're seeking an image of unity so that's why God's Prophet brother brandom recognized it's probably the World Council of churches that will be the image unto the Beast because they're seeking visible Unity this council is a false Unity of course for any Union without Union upon true Doctrine is erroneous the World Council of churches has member churches who hold false doctrines that allow homosexuality adultery lusciousness just a name a few these churches do not have Unity like Jesus's Unity with the father for Jesus always did those things that please the father according to John 8:29 the World Council churches allow sins that displease the father or grieve the heavenly father or the holy spirit so the world counsil of churches cannot have true Unity with Jesus while Jesus did pray for Christians to have unity and John 17:11 he said that they may be one as we are the Bible teaches true Unity only comes through adherence to the one Faith remember Ephesians 4:5 says there's only one faith and then Jude 1:3 says we earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and false churches will turn God's grace into lusciousness false churches turn God's grace into lawlessness or iniquity which means churches will say oh it's okay if you sin it's it's okay if you commit adultery it's okay if you're homosexual it's okay if you're trans lies such as those are the epitome of turning Grace into theous in the Bible St John States Christians should have no Unity with teachers of false Doctrine saying whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and the son if there come any unto you and bring not this Doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him godp speed for he that bth him godp speed is partaker of his evil Deeds 2 John 1: 99-1 I love this scripture because it says in order to have Christ and the father you have to have the right Doctrine and it's so sad many message churches are blasting preachers who teach Doctrine and so forth shame on them they don't even know what they're saying they're likely very immature probably not born again if they don't understand the importance of Doctrine in fact Jesus's first Doctrine according to brother brandham was John 3 you must be born again I want to take the subject this morning of Jesus first Doctrine the first doctrine of Jesus was you must be born again that was his first Doctrine and without being born again you can't even go in the Rapture so all these message preachers blasting Doctrine they're blasting the only way to go in the Rapture which is the doctrine of the baptism of the Holy Ghost receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost moving on all churches who reject true Bible Doctrine and join the World Council of churches in a false Unity manifest that they are true Daughters of the mother Harlot and the mother Harlot of course is the Roman Catholic Church the image of the Beast or world or World Council of churches would play a major role in the future Great Tribulation helping lay down the mark of the beast Revelation 13:15 says the Beast gives life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and God's Prophet brother brandom taught us The ecumenical move will become so strong politically that governments will enact laws forcing all churches to come under Dominion of the World Council which is basically Rome's Dominion great pressure to join will be placed upon everyone for this unionized church and state system controls finances and will have power to kill anyone who descend friends no matter what the current Pope says or any Pope says or any Catholic says the Catholic councils declared that any Protestant receiving the revelation of justification by faith is cursed this is from the Council of Trent took place from 1545 to 1563 you can find this on britannica.com says indeed both of the either or doctrines of the Protestant reformers justification by faith alone the authority of scriptures alone were aniz or cursed in the name of a both and doctrine of justification by both faith and works on the basis of the authority of both scripture and tradition so back in the 1500s the Catholic Church cursed Protestant teaching on justification by faith saying they're cursed that means they can't be saved so no matter what current Catholics say or anyone says the Council of Trent cursed Protestants who believe in justification by faith only so any Protestant who unites with a Catholic is being deceived because the Catholics have cursed justification by faith they've never corrected that Council they never changed the words from that Council it's still in effect and as you know there's been a great move of ecumenism Pope Francis actually went to the World Council of churches back in 2018 I found a website on that I just thought it was interesting the Catholic church is not part of the World Council of churches but has participated as an observer and has collaborated at various levels since 1965 I thought that was very fitting that was the Year brother brand went off the scene and again that was the same year Catholicism started actively participating with the World Council of churches the same year God took his Prophet off the scene you probably remember 2014 when Word of Faith false prophet Kenneth Copeland United with the Pope here's a screenshot of that in this picture you can see the late Bishop Tony Palmer sadly he passed away just months after this meeting with Kenneth copelan and the pope it's very sad of course for his family with his loss but friends he said that he went to this meeting with Copeland and the Pope in the spirit of Elijah to unite Catholics and Protestants that's a very dangerous statement I don't know if that's why Tony Palmer passed away so recently or so soon after that statement but that had have been a lie because brother brandham already spoke with thus sayith the Lord that the spirit of Elijah was upon him fighting against the Roman Catholic Church not uniting Protestants with the Catholic church but the Bible said and he promised in the last days he would send the spirit of Elijah and would call the people the children of God back to the original Faith like it was in the beginning of the world now remember it's thus sayth the Lord that'll come to pass in this day now search over the world take every cult take every Clan take every man take every church I charge you in Christ's name to do this you preachers I charge you to read the newspapers or take consideration anywhere you want to go and see if it isn't on the Earth right now don't you never try to fight communism fight romanism that's right that's thus sayth the Lord hallelujah the Lord said romanism is going to rule not communism it's just a puppet and then in 2017 I'm sure you might know know or maybe it's new to you that a pastor from Atlanta Georgia named Lou Giglio kissed the pope so there's lots of videos you can find on that on YouTube as well again showing a prominent Protestant preacher showing love and affection for the pope of Rome the mother Harlot and Lou giglio's passion conferences have ministered to thousands of people thousands of Protestants but of course it's a false worship a false religion because they're uniting with the Roman Catholic church and lastly I'll just remind you of the Republican National Convention from July 2024 the convention was opened up with a prayer to the one true God of the Hindu religion a religionnews.com article says this at RNC an uneven awkward Embrace of religious pluralism as a republican official let a seek prayer images of Christian crosses flash behind her the prayer was led by a woman named harit cower Dylan a National Committee woman of the Republican National Convention for California the prayer said dear why guro our one true God we thank you for creating America as unique Heaven on this earth end quote friends this is so sad the name of God is not wahi guro the name of God is the Lord Jesus Christ and I just read this morning in Revelation 13 how the Beast will blaspheme the name of God and so Catholics blasphemed the name of God by ignoring the the Lord Jesus Christ's name and giving God titles father son Holy Ghost calling him a Holy Trinity that's blasphemy changing the name of God and here it's blasphemy to say the one name of God is wahi Guru and of course this is blasphemy but you can see the efforts of all these so-called religious people these Protestants trying to unite with Catholicism and Christianity creating a one world religion three times in brother brenham's Church age book he mentioned this image erected to the Beast he said the world ecunemical movement which is the image erected unto the Beast that was on page 274 and then on page 314 he said the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image erected to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture praise the Lord for that brother Ram said the church system of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant is coming together and it will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole world into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby they would make a living brother Ram said this will be accomplished simply for the harlot's daughters are all but gone back to her and I also share with my church recently a very famous conservative Candace Owens has now gone back to the Roman Catholic Church here's a screenshot of that again this is no surprise we know the Protestants must Unite with the Catholics whether they do it by converting to Catholicism or uniting with the Pope kissing the pope meeting with the Pope it's sad but that's prophecy being fulfilled we to be the elect that do not Unite with protestantism and Catholicism and we are by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ by the warnings of thus sayth the Lord from God's Prophet brother William brandham Brother Bram said the false Church groups will come together in a world Council of churches This World Council of churches is the image erected to the Beast one final quote is from Shalom 1964 brother brandham said I know it's unpopular to speak against organization but that's the mark of the beast it's making an image unto the Beast he says you'll know that was thus sayith the Lord someday and we're seeing this greater move of Protestants uniting with Catholics today so we can see brother Ram's prophecy is being fulfilled right before our eyes let's listen to the quote and here he comes down and vindicates it on the moon just at the time that all the churches are going together in a consolidation of the Federation of churches Hallelujah no wonder Isaiah said Gross darknesses upon the Earth upon this people I know it's unproper to speak against organization but that's the mark of the beast that's the thing that's carrying us right into there making an image unto the Beast I don't say that for to be angry I say that because it's truth Brethren the day will come when Phoenix will raise up and maybe I'm gone on but you'll know that that was thus said the Lord it is true how that the great Holy Spirit has Vindicated those messages and for toll of things never to fail one time in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God as time keeps moving on we see more and more Protestants uniting with Catholicism more people converting into Catholicism saying they're going back to the original church and of course they're the original Harlot church but thank God for the truth of God that sets us free thank God for the holy ghost that cleans out our lives seals our souls into the day day of redemption and even keeps us from any Deeds of the nicians these original sins that God hates these sayings or traditions of man that eventually become false doctrines thank God that the Holy Ghost convicts us of any sin or any false tradition and keeps us clean it takes all the leaven out of the church so we rejoice in that that we can be the True Church of God the Blood Washed blood Sanctified blood Justified Blood Bought Church and Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and by God's Grace we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our souls and we will be ready to meet the Lord in the air at the pre-tribulation Rapture if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
