[0:03] Would you endorse birth control? No, I
[0:06] can't endorse it. No,
[0:09] sir. Greetings, friends, in the mattress
[0:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:13] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:15] viewer's question. Is using birth
[0:18] control pills a sin? And the answer is
[0:21] yes. Birth control pills cause human
[0:25] deletions? And of course, I'm using that
[0:27] word on this platform on purpose rather
[0:30] than another word. Birth control pills
[0:32] prevent implantation of an already
[0:35] fertilized OAM. Friends, the pro-life
[0:38] movement has a lot of strong research on
[0:40] this subject. I'll leave two citations
[0:44] in the description if you want to check
[0:45] it out. One's from Human Life
[0:47] International. Another one is from
[0:49] Eternal Perspective Ministries. And the
[0:52] science is undeniable. Birth control
[0:55] pills prevent implantation of an already
[0:58] fertilized OAM. People I know have read
[1:01] the fine print on a birth control label
[1:05] and it does say that it does say that
[1:08] the pills can prevent the fertilized OAM
[1:11] from implanting. So taking birth control
[1:14] pills is the same as actually having a
[1:16] human deletion at a human deletion
[1:20] clinic.
[1:22] I thought I'd start with the scripture,
[1:24] friends. Then we'll look at quotes from
[1:25] God's prophet, brother William Marin
[1:27] Brham. The scripture says in Psalm
[1:29] 139:13-14, "For thou has possessed my
[1:31] reigns, thou has covered me in my
[1:34] mother's womb." So God's spirit is right
[1:37] around the fertilized oam in every
[1:40] mother's womb. What an amazing act of
[1:43] almighty God to protect that child. And
[1:46] then David said, "I'll praise thee, for
[1:48] I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[1:50] Marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[1:52] knoweth right
[1:53] well. So God creates a human being. All
[1:57] the billions and billions maybe
[1:58] trillions of humans he's created. They
[2:00] are all fearfully and wonderfully made.
[2:02] Jeremiah 15 says, "Before I formed thee
[2:04] in the belly, I knew thee." So
[2:06] predestination tells us God knew us
[2:09] before he formed us. He knew us in the
[2:11] mind of Christ according to Ephesians
[2:13] 1:4 before the foundation of the world.
[2:16] Exodus 4:11 even says, "Who has made a
[2:20] man's mouth? Who makes him mute, deaf or
[2:22] seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?"
[2:26] So, we know there's no reason to delete
[2:29] a human life. If there's any defect in
[2:32] the child, a Christian's attitude and a
[2:34] Christian's heart should be to receive
[2:36] that child because the Lord did it for a
[2:38] purpose. God is not the author of
[2:40] confusion, but of peace, as saith the
[2:42] scripture. Galatians 5:21 says,
[2:45] "Envings, murders, drunkenness,
[2:47] revelings, they that do such things
[2:49] shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
[2:51] So people that willingly take birth
[2:54] control pills that cause human deletions
[2:57] will not inherit the kingdom of God if
[2:59] they do it on purpose. Now, if they're
[3:01] ignorant and if they have the Holy
[3:02] Ghost, the Holy Ghost will guide them
[3:04] into all truth to show them their
[3:06] wrongs, and they'll repent. They'll feel
[3:08] really, really awful for any possible
[3:10] human deletions and they'll want to get
[3:12] right with God and never take them again
[3:14] by the grace of God. And then Revelation
[3:17] 22:14 and 15 says, "Those that have the
[3:21] right to enter into the gates of the New
[3:23] Jerusalem, the city, are blessed because
[3:25] they kept the command such as not
[3:27] deleting human life." And it includes
[3:30] dogs, sorcerers, whoreongers, and
[3:32] murderers. And of course that connects
[3:34] to birth control pills and the women
[3:36] that take them. So that's a good
[3:39] scriptural background there by God's
[3:41] grace. Let's go through some quotes from
[3:42] God's prophet, brother William Marian
[3:44] Brandham. In the first quote from 1954,
[3:47] brother Brandham says, "It's a baby as
[3:50] soon as the germ is fertilized." He
[3:53] said, "It's just as harmful to take the
[3:54] life of a little baby that ain't 2
[3:56] months old as it is to pull a pistol and
[4:00] delete a man down in coldblooded
[4:03] deletion or murder." Brother Ram says,
[4:05] "I am against birth control. What God
[4:07] sends, God will take care of it." That's
[4:09] the truth. My parents had six children.
[4:11] God took care of us. I have eight
[4:12] children going on nine. God has taken
[4:14] care of us by his amazing grace. Let's
[4:16] listen to the quote from God's prophet.
[4:19] A baby's a baby when it's formed. the
[4:21] very first germ in the mother's womb.
[4:23] It's a baby. I'm firmly against birth
[4:26] control. See? Yes, sir. For Lord, it's
[4:29] just as much harm to to take the life of
[4:32] a little baby that ain't two months old
[4:34] as it is to pull a pistol and shoot a
[4:36] man down in cold blood murder. Yes, sir.
[4:39] I'm against birth control. What God
[4:42] sends, God will take care of.
[4:45] Second, in 1954, later about 7 months
[4:48] later, December 54, Brother Ram says
[4:51] it's a disgrace. Birth control or
[4:54] practicing birth control is a disgrace.
[4:56] Let's listen to the quote. You're not
[4:58] long ago, I met a woman that has
[5:00] committed some of those cases.
[5:01] Practicing birth control, that's the
[5:04] disgrace in America. This may kind of
[5:07] sting you a little bit, but watch it.
[5:10] what they'll do today. They used to they
[5:12] make fun of a man that's got four, five,
[5:13] six, seven children. Say it's a
[5:15] disgrace. It used to not be a disgrace.
[5:19] Then in 1956, Brother Ram said,
[5:21] "Children make you happy." And of
[5:22] course, there's lots of good quotes on
[5:24] how Brother Bram showed that children
[5:26] make parents happy. Brother Ram says,
[5:29] "It's a great duty to God for a woman to
[5:32] carry children and take care of
[5:33] children. And throughout all the
[5:36] eternities, you'll enjoy the blessings
[5:37] of God. If you bring a child into the
[5:39] world and raise it, right? What a
[5:41] promise. Throughout all eternity, you'll
[5:43] remember that you brought a child into
[5:45] the world and raised it to the glory of
[5:47] Jesus Christ. Let's listen to the quote.
[5:50] I think of sometimes how mothers will
[5:53] refuse to raise children, bring up
[5:56] children, and young women practice birth
[5:59] control, buy little dogs, and lead them
[6:01] around. And you only realize, lady, that
[6:04] just about 20 years of your life that
[6:07] you have that God's laed to you that
[6:09] you're going to be able to do this great
[6:11] duty for God. Do you know your child
[6:14] might be a modern Phiney or or something
[6:17] like that? Do you realize just 20 by
[6:19] about 20 years of your life as as long
[6:22] as you you'll be able to raise children
[6:24] and all through the
[6:26] eternities you'll enjoy the blessings of
[6:29] God if you bring a child in this world
[6:31] and raise it right that star that's
[6:33] shining out in glory and you'll be
[6:34] associated with it. See and then to
[6:38] refuse to raise the little fellas
[6:40] because you'd rather take your running
[6:41] around and carrying on. That's
[6:43] ridiculous. You shouldn't do that. And
[6:46] now don't do it. No sir, don't you do
[6:48] it. You be a happy person. Mothers of
[6:50] old, they love to raise children, but
[6:52] oh, this modern American day that we're
[6:55] living in now, I tell you, our nation is
[6:58] simply polluted. Now, skipping ahead to
[7:01] July 30th, 1964, morning service,
[7:04] questions and answers, part three. They
[7:06] asked Brother Brandham about birth
[7:07] control, and he says there's only one
[7:10] form of birth control that's acceptable.
[7:12] And brother Brandham says it's the
[7:14] number of days that a woman's not
[7:16] fertile. Some people call this the
[7:18] calendar method. Brother Bram says
[7:20] that's the right way of doing birth
[7:22] control. Husband and wife should not
[7:24] come together during the time the wife
[7:26] is fertile. It's amazing what God
[7:29] revealed to his prophet even back in
[7:31] 1964. And brother Ram admitted there at
[7:34] the end of the quote that some people
[7:35] would lie to him. They try to lie to him
[7:37] and say that they needed to take birth
[7:38] control pills when they didn't need to
[7:40] take it. Thank God for the spirit of
[7:42] truth, for the Holy Ghost. Let's listen
[7:44] to the quote. How do you feel about
[7:47] birth
[7:48] control? I had some of that on the
[7:51] interviews this morning. I'd rather talk
[7:53] personally with with you on those
[7:54] things. See, on those things there cause
[7:56] these words and things that I have to
[7:58] say that I'd rather say it if a husband
[8:00] and wife and there is a possibility of
[8:03] it being done in the right way. I'd say
[8:05] it to for general. There is so many days
[8:08] in a woman's life that she's not
[8:11] fertile. You understand? All right. Why?
[8:14] Now, there's sometimes a a child would
[8:16] kill a woman if she had a baby to kill
[8:18] her. You want to watch that, too. See?
[8:20] So, just be real careful about that.
[8:23] See? See, that's bringing life to what
[8:25] you're what you're in the earth to do.
[8:26] If your wife is sickly and a child would
[8:29] kill her, uh I I wouldn't do it. I don't
[8:31] think the Lord wants you to do it. And
[8:33] you you come to me personally on them
[8:34] things. Have it on private interview.
[8:36] Let me talk to you personally. See, now
[8:38] I can feel see each individual. I can
[8:40] tell where they're lying to me or not.
[8:42] See, they're telling me different
[8:43] things. I'd rather see. See, because you
[8:45] put out like this, you don't know it's
[8:46] because he's individual and things like
[8:48] that. I can tell it whether they're
[8:49] telling the truth or not. See, the next
[8:52] quote is again from questions and
[8:54] answers, but it's part four from 1964,
[8:57] the evening service. They asked Brother
[8:59] Brandham, "Is it wrong to limit the
[9:01] family? Did it mean practice complete
[9:03] birth control?" And brother Brandham
[9:04] said, "I already answered that, of
[9:06] course, to each
[9:09] individual." So, Brother Bam already
[9:11] answered this about limiting family
[9:12] size. The only right way to do it is
[9:14] through the calendar method. And I think
[9:16] it's important to say that a lot of
[9:18] people maybe in America perhaps they
[9:20] limit their family size because of fear,
[9:23] maybe selfishness, pride. And it's sad,
[9:26] friends. Someone told me this one time.
[9:27] I think I read it in a book where they
[9:29] asked when in history did believers
[9:31] mutilate themselves to limit their
[9:32] family size only in this Leoian church
[9:35] age. It's so sad. No wonder Jesus had no
[9:38] commendations for the Leosian church
[9:40] age. As brother Brandham said, a lot of
[9:42] people who claim to believe the message
[9:44] of the hour limit their family size on
[9:46] purpose for sinful reasons. Not for the
[9:49] health of the mother, but for sinful
[9:50] reasons. But of course, God can forgive
[9:53] the repentant ones. But let's listen to
[9:55] the quote by God's grace.
[9:58] Is this day wrong to limit your family?
[10:02] Did it mean practice complete birth
[10:04] control? I answered that of course to
[10:07] each individual. And the last and final
[10:09] quote is from that same sermon question
[10:12] and answers part 464. They asked brother
[10:15] Ram, "Would you endorse birth control?"
[10:16] No, I can't endorse it. No, sir. Let's
[10:19] listen to the quote. What would you
[10:22] endorse birth control? I don't know. I
[10:25] can't endorse it. No, sir. In closing,
[10:28] friends, I hope this video has been a
[10:29] blessing by the grace of God. Remember
[10:31] friends, just with baby deletions
[10:33] surgically done at a baby deletion
[10:36] clinic, almost 70 million children have
[10:39] lost their lives. It has to grieve the
[10:41] heart of God tremendously. And that's
[10:43] just in America. That's not in other
[10:45] countries. And that's just what has been
[10:47] reported. Now, on top of that, add up
[10:50] all the baby deletions that have
[10:52] happened through birth control pills. My
[10:54] goodness, how much human deletion has
[10:57] happened because of selfishness, fear,
[10:59] pride, or other sins. But friends, God
[11:03] is merciful. He's quick to forgive if a
[11:05] person is truly repentant. There is
[11:08] grace in the Lord Jesus Christ. He'll
[11:11] change your heart to the point you'll
[11:13] never want to do anything like that ever
[11:14] again and teach your children or your
[11:17] grandchildren to never do such a thing
[11:19] as that. Let's end on a positive note.
[11:21] Psalm 127 verses 3 4 and 5 say, "Lo,
[11:26] children are inheritage of the Lord and
[11:28] the fruit of the womb is his reward.
[11:30] Children are reward." And the word
[11:32] heritage means God's property. Children
[11:34] are God's property. That's why we let
[11:36] them develop and receive them when God
[11:39] sends them. Verse four, as arrows are in
[11:41] the hand of a mighty man, so are
[11:43] children of the youth. So a godly man's
[11:46] children are weapons against the enemy.
[11:48] We see that with our children. They're
[11:49] so soft and tender. They love the Lord.
[11:51] They pray. They sing. They play
[11:53] instruments. They are God's arrows
[11:55] against the enemy. And verse 5, happy is
[11:57] the man that hath his quiver full of
[11:59] them. They shall not be ashamed. They
[12:00] shall speak with the enemies in the
[12:03] gate.
[12:05] So God will raise up our godly children
[12:07] to be godly influences in the community
[12:10] by the grace of God. Praise the Lord for
[12:12] natural children and praise the Lord for
[12:14] spiritual children. Those who are
[12:16] baptized with the Holy Ghost. And that
[12:18] should be our prayer as parents that our
[12:20] children in the natural will receive the
[12:22] spiritual birth of the baptism of the
[12:24] Holy Ghost which only comes to
[12:26] predestinated sons and daughters of God.
[12:28] As Galatians 4 tells us. Galatians 4:6
[12:32] says, "And because ye are sons, God hath
[12:34] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[12:35] your hearts, crying, aba father." So I
[12:38] believe if someone has the spirit of
[12:39] Christ, they'll cry, "Aba, father to God
[12:43] their father." And then they'll have the
[12:44] right attitude towards children, not to
[12:46] limit their family size unless there's
[12:48] some reason the mother can't have
[12:50] children, but to just accept the
[12:52] children as God sends them. If you have
[12:55] any questions, concerns, or testimonies
[12:57] about this video, please contact me.
[12:59] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[13:01] the desire of your heart.
[13:05] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[13:07] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[13:09] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[13:12] good news that Jesus raised from the
[13:14] dead, living among man today, his
[13:17] church. The same Jesus that was
[13:19] yesterday will be today and
[13:22] forever is never failed.
