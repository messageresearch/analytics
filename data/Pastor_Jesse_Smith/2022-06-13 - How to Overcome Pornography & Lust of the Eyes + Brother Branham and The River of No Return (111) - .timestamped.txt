[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] greetings friends in the name above all
[0:11] names the lord jesus christ
[0:14] the purpose of this video is to help
[0:15] christian brothers and some christian
[0:17] sisters
[0:18] overcome pornography and the lust of the
[0:21] eyes and the lust of the flesh
[0:23] of course i've always known the need for
[0:25] this video but i was waiting for
[0:27] inspiration and the timing of god by his
[0:30] grace
[0:31] this subject has been requested numerous
[0:33] times over the years
[0:35] and so recently i felt very burdened to
[0:37] study on this i've devoted numerous
[0:40] hours to studying this subject and i
[0:42] hope this video is a help to many by the
[0:44] grace of god
[0:46] here's the outline for the video
[0:48] first we'll look at the battle against
[0:50] sexual sin and the lust of the eyes and
[0:52] lust of the flesh
[0:54] second we'll look at 11 warnings about
[0:56] sexual sin from the bible
[0:59] third we'll look at bible verses to use
[1:02] for victory over sexual sin
[1:05] fourth i'll share my testimony
[1:07] overcoming sexual sin
[1:10] and lastly we'll answer a viewer's
[1:11] question about how brother branham
[1:12] watched the movie the river of no return
[1:15] and how it relates to this subject
[1:18] the battle against sexual sin and the
[1:20] lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh
[1:23] beginning in 1st john 2 verses 15-17
[1:27] john teaches all sins come through three
[1:30] channels the lust of the flesh the lust
[1:32] of the eyes and the pride of life
[1:35] the word lust means longing desire for
[1:38] something forbidden so we know both our
[1:41] eyes and flesh or bodies have lusts
[1:45] longings or desires that are forbidden
[1:47] by god
[1:49] it's important to note that pride of
[1:51] life often works with these other two
[1:53] channels since pride means
[1:54] self-confidence and is the opposite of
[1:57] humility
[1:58] humility is having no self-interest
[2:01] a humble person is only interested in
[2:03] the things of god
[2:05] but a prideful person is confident in
[2:07] their own ability
[2:09] and interested in his own lusts
[2:12] and often rebels against god's commands
[2:15] and gives in to pornography or adultery
[2:18] fornication
[2:19] or other sexual
[2:20] sins a true christian recognizes the
[2:23] channels that he or she is being tempted
[2:26] in and overcomes the temptations
[2:29] concerning sexual temptation satan will
[2:31] often use the lust of the eyes to begin
[2:34] enticing a christian
[2:36] the human mind is the battlefield we
[2:38] must fight in and there are five inlets
[2:40] to the human mind as you can see on this
[2:43] visual conscience memory reason
[2:46] affection and
[2:48] imagination regarding his sexual
[2:51] temptations satan often uses a visual
[2:53] sexual image to tempt the lust of the
[2:55] eyes and then he moves to the inlet of
[2:58] imagination tempting a christian with a
[3:00] sexual fantasy
[3:02] or satan could use the inlet of memory
[3:04] bringing a past sexual sin to the
[3:06] christian's memory
[3:07] tempting the believer to remember that
[3:09] and perhaps repeat it
[3:12] no matter the inlet the christian has
[3:14] access to the word of god in his or her
[3:16] mind and the word of god will defeat
[3:18] satan anytime anyplace anywhere
[3:28] [Applause]
[3:39] next in james chapter 1 verses 12
[3:42] through 15 we're told we're blessed to
[3:45] endure temptation or persevere in the
[3:48] greek
[3:49] through and overcome temptations
[3:53] god himself does not tempt us with evil
[3:55] and verses 14 and 15 then show the
[3:58] four-step process that ultimately leads
[4:01] to death or separation from god which is
[4:04] step one enticed which means entrapped
[4:07] or lord
[4:08] step two lust conceived which means
[4:11] seized arrested or captured step three
[4:14] is sin or committing the actual offense
[4:17] and step four is death or separation
[4:22] the four-step process is clearly seen
[4:24] the garden of eden in genesis chapter 3
[4:27] through eve the first female the bible
[4:29] is clear that all corruption came into
[4:31] the world through lust or a forbidden
[4:34] longing or craving or desire second
[4:37] peter 1 verse 4 says that i'll read the
[4:39] second half of the verse that by these
[4:41] you might be partakers of the divine
[4:43] nature having escaped the corruption
[4:45] that is in the world through lust
[4:49] with a true understanding of the holy
[4:50] ghost eve fell in this four-step process
[4:53] by the following
[4:55] first she was enticed or allured by the
[4:58] conversation with and questioning of the
[5:01] serpent
[5:02] second her lust conceived in her mind
[5:04] when she was captured by the
[5:06] possibilities of eating the forbidden
[5:08] fruit and then decided to partake
[5:11] third she literally committed the sin or
[5:13] offense by eating of the fruit which was
[5:16] the act of adultery according to
[5:18] proverbs 30 verse 20 and of course the
[5:20] context of genesis chapter 3.
[5:23] but first proverbs 30 verse 20 says such
[5:26] is the way of an adulterous woman she
[5:28] eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i
[5:30] have done no wickedness
[5:32] the context also proves the fruit was
[5:35] adultery because right after the fruit
[5:37] is eaten in verse 15 god says there are
[5:40] now two sets of offspring
[5:42] or two sets of children
[5:44] so we know adam and eve did not eat
[5:46] physical apples the fruit they partook
[5:48] of was a fruit of unbelief which was
[5:50] adultery
[5:52] remember friends i have a couple of
[5:53] videos about the serpent seed doctrine
[5:55] that god actually instituted in genesis
[5:57] 3 15.
[5:59] that'd be a great help to you if this
[6:00] teaching is new to you it will really
[6:02] help you understand the original sin and
[6:03] also the reason why jesus christ had to
[6:05] come by a virgin birth
[6:08] fourth then death began to set in in
[6:10] eve's body and mind
[6:12] the holy anointing left she and adam
[6:15] notice also that both eve and adam
[6:17] physically separated themselves from the
[6:19] presence of god shortly after sinning
[6:21] adam and eve eventually died in the
[6:23] natural as a result of their sin
[6:27] now applying this four-step process to
[6:29] our lives we should desire to overcome
[6:32] all temptation in the first stage when
[6:34] we are enticed we must not let lust be
[6:37] conceived we must not be captured by the
[6:40] lustful thought and decide to act upon
[6:42] it in our minds
[6:45] sexual temptation
[6:46] and or pornography is such a difficult
[6:48] battle because adultery was the first
[6:50] physical sin committed between even the
[6:52] serpent
[6:53] it remains a major battle throughout
[6:55] human history even to the end as jesus
[6:58] prophesied he would return at a time
[7:00] when the days resembled the days of noah
[7:02] and lot according to luke 17 verses 26
[7:05] through 30.
[7:07] in noah's day sons of god were marrying
[7:09] wicked women based solely upon their
[7:12] physical beauty according to genesis 6
[7:14] verse
[7:15] in lots day homosexuality was so
[7:17] prevalent that mobs of sodomites roamed
[7:20] the city and took victims by physical
[7:22] force
[7:23] apparently undeterred by any law
[7:25] enforcement in the city of sodom
[7:28] now the opposite of the four-step
[7:30] process of death is god's four-step
[7:32] process to life which is
[7:35] step one the way
[7:37] step two the truth step three the life
[7:40] and step four eternal life
[7:43] now of course we get this four-step
[7:44] process
[7:46] from john 14 verse 6 where jesus sayeth
[7:48] unto them i am the way the truth and the
[7:50] life no man comes in the father but by
[7:53] me
[7:55] when tempted a christian must choose the
[7:56] right way to escape satan's trap
[7:59] first corinthians 10 verses 13 and 14
[8:02] beautifully explained this saying god
[8:04] always makes a way of escape in every
[8:06] single temptation and every person has
[8:08] been tempted in a similar fashion so
[8:10] that there are no excuses on judgment
[8:12] day
[8:13] and then verse 14 says my dearly beloved
[8:16] flee from idolatry
[8:18] so the way out of temptation is to flee
[8:20] the temptation and choose the next step
[8:23] the truth of god's word
[8:25] satan tries to convince the believer
[8:27] that the fleshly pleasures are more
[8:29] important than god's holiness but satan
[8:31] is a liar in john 17 verse 17 jesus says
[8:35] thy word is truth
[8:37] so first flee the temptation
[8:39] second believe the truth which is
[8:41] deciding to do the truth
[8:43] and then the third step is life or
[8:46] obedience in that particular moment
[8:49] choosing this life or obedience on a
[8:51] regular basis ultimately leads to
[8:53] eternal life with jesus christ our lord
[8:55] which is the fourth step
[8:58] the war against the soul
[9:01] if a christian gives into sexual sin
[9:03] after being entrapped and having lust
[9:05] conceived he must repent and get victory
[9:08] the next time the enemy comes to tempt
[9:11] him
[9:11] if not the christian becomes addicted or
[9:13] enslaved to this sexual sin
[9:15] creating a war against his soul as peter
[9:18] teaches in first peter 2 verse 11
[9:21] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[9:23] strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[9:25] fleshly lusts which war against the soul
[9:29] in this war between the flesh mind and
[9:31] the soul a christian will begin to
[9:33] wonder if he is even saved because he is
[9:36] so enslaved to sexual sin
[9:39] peter again wrote about this in second
[9:40] peter chapter 1 verse 9 saying that if a
[9:43] christian does not keep the anointing of
[9:45] the holy ghost upon him which is
[9:47] manifesting faith virtue knowledge
[9:49] temperance patience godless and
[9:51] brotherly kindness he can forget he was
[9:53] purged of his sins and begin doubting
[9:56] his salvation
[9:58] second peter 1 verse 9 says but he that
[10:00] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[10:02] see afar off and hath forgotten that he
[10:05] was purged from his old sins
[10:08] so as peter says the christian must
[10:10] realize he has to war against his
[10:12] fleshly desires
[10:14] and sinful sexual thoughts in his mind
[10:18] the spoiled house from matthew chapter
[10:20] 12
[10:21] when a christian man or woman opens
[10:24] themselves up to sexual sin or
[10:26] pornography they have let the devil come
[10:28] into their mind and the devil spoils the
[10:32] good things in their mind as jesus
[10:34] taught in matthew 12 verses 24 through
[10:36] 29 and 43-45
[10:41] jesus taught a beautiful analogy about
[10:42] how to become free from demonic
[10:45] influence in this case of this video how
[10:48] to be free from sexual addictions like
[10:50] pornography
[10:52] recall that man is a three-part being as
[10:54] seen in this visual
[10:56] according to matthew 12
[10:58] verses 24-29
[11:00] sexual addiction starts when a believer
[11:03] lets a sinful sexual thought enter his
[11:06] house or his mind
[11:08] as taught earlier this means satan has
[11:10] accomplished the first three steps of
[11:12] the four-step process of death
[11:15] enticed lust conceived and sin
[11:18] now the strong man of the house or faith
[11:21] or he could call it the anointing of the
[11:22] holy ghost
[11:24] has been bound or grieved as paul said
[11:26] in ephesians 4 30 when he said grieve
[11:28] not the holy spirit of god
[11:31] the believers joy strength victory and
[11:33] faith has been bound up
[11:35] the strength of the lord is hindered or
[11:37] paralyzed in the believer's mind
[11:40] matthew 12 29 says or else how can one
[11:43] enter into a strong man's house and
[11:45] spoil his goods except he first bind the
[11:47] strong man
[11:48] and then he will spoil his house
[11:52] the way to regain control of the house
[11:54] is repentance from sexual sin
[11:57] repentance has a three-fold application
[11:59] in the greek it means to first hate the
[12:01] sin
[12:02] second change your thinking and third
[12:05] make amends for your sin
[12:08] in thorough repentance as brother
[12:09] branham calls it the sexual thoughts are
[12:11] cast out of the believer's mind the
[12:14] strong man or anointing of faith is now
[12:17] back in control of the house or mind
[12:20] a truly repentant christian will hate
[12:22] their addiction to sexual sin
[12:24] then they will change their thinking
[12:25] about it and no longer meditate on it
[12:28] and then make amends for it which might
[12:30] mean getting rid of the internet on his
[12:32] or her phone or the internet in their
[12:35] home or stop going to certain physical
[12:37] places like movie theaters or other
[12:39] wicked places that have sexual sin
[12:42] once having truly repented and and being
[12:45] free from sexual addiction jesus tells
[12:47] us the sexual demons that were cast out
[12:50] will leave for a while but plan to
[12:52] return with a greater sexual temptation
[12:55] notice that jesus said seven other
[12:57] sexual demons will come back to tempt
[12:59] and if that man's house or mind isn't
[13:01] filled with the holy ghost the devils
[13:04] will retake control of the man's mind
[13:06] and he'll become a worse sexual addict
[13:08] than he was before
[13:10] friend if you cannot resist sexual sin
[13:13] or pornography then you are not in
[13:15] charge of your house
[13:16] your strong man is bound
[13:18] your faith is paralyzed
[13:20] the way to clean out your house is to
[13:22] confess your sins and expose the enemy
[13:25] drive him out with the word of god
[13:27] fill your mind with the word of god and
[13:29] get victory for just one day
[13:32] and then when the enemy comes back the
[13:33] next day you will not let him in
[13:36] as long as you're filling your mind with
[13:38] the powerful word of god
[13:40] i believe this transformation is best
[13:42] done the first thing in the morning as
[13:44] jesus said to seek first the kingdom of
[13:45] god in matthew 6 33
[13:48] christ also modeled this truth in mark
[13:51] chapter 1 verses 34 and 35
[13:54] as immediately after holding a massive
[13:56] healing campaign of miracles he woke up
[13:59] a great while before day to go pray
[14:01] alone
[14:03] this is true humility jesus modeled how
[14:06] to overcome every temptation
[14:08] private prayer
[14:10] and if the sinless spotless son of god
[14:12] had to rise early to pray every day even
[14:15] after a miraculous campaign how much
[14:17] more do we need to do this
[14:20] jesus christ showed us how to win the
[14:22] daily battle against temptation whether
[14:24] it's sexual or not
[14:27] 11 bible warnings about sexual sin
[14:32] the first warning is looking at sexual
[14:34] sins will torment or haunt you every day
[14:39] sex addicts will have a life of torment
[14:42] the example is lot in sodom 2nd peter 2
[14:45] verses 7 and 8 tell us that la was vexed
[14:48] or tormented with a filthy conversation
[14:50] of the wicked
[14:52] because in seeing and hearing what the
[14:54] sodomites were doing they vexed his
[14:56] righteous soul from day to day with
[14:58] their unlawful deeds
[15:01] the sad part is lot put himself in this
[15:03] awful position so learn from lot and
[15:05] stop putting yourself in these
[15:07] situations
[15:09] choose to live a life of freedom instead
[15:11] of a life of bondage to satan remember
[15:13] satan wants to weaken you according to
[15:15] isaiah 14 verse 12
[15:17] and kill steal and destroy you john 10
[15:20] verse 10
[15:21] but you're not called to love and serve
[15:23] satan you're called to be strengthened
[15:25] day by day loving jesus christ with all
[15:28] your heart soul mind and strength
[15:31] the second warning is your eyes will
[15:32] never be satisfied with pornography
[15:35] pornography is an unending death trap
[15:39] proverbs 27 20 tells us this hell and
[15:42] destruction are never full so the eyes
[15:45] of man are never satisfied
[15:48] the lust of the eyes is never satisfied
[15:51] no amount of porn will ever be enough to
[15:53] satisfy the fleshly lusts
[15:55] the sooner you recognize that the sooner
[15:57] you'll only use your eyes to look at
[15:59] holy things godly things things that
[16:01] please the lord jesus christ
[16:05] the third warning is that lust and the
[16:06] spirit of fear being found out will do
[16:09] anything to keep itself secret causing
[16:12] you to hurt those you love the most
[16:15] for example david had uriah killed to
[16:17] hide his adultery
[16:19] this is why you must confess your sins
[16:21] to jesus
[16:22] and perhaps some people will need an
[16:23] accountability partner at least at first
[16:26] when trying to overcome sexual sin but
[16:28] it must be somebody trustworthy that
[16:30] will keep these things in confidence
[16:33] the fourth warning is that satan is
[16:35] hunting you down with sexual temptations
[16:38] as his bait using sexual words sexual
[16:41] outfits facial makeup and more
[16:44] friend you must be ready to fight him
[16:46] off with the commandments of god this is
[16:48] found in proverbs 6 verses 23 through 26
[16:51] for the commandment is a lamp and the
[16:53] law's light and reproofs of instruction
[16:56] are the way of life to keep thee from
[16:58] the evil woman from the flattery of the
[17:01] tongue of a strange woman lust not after
[17:03] her beauty and thine heart neither let
[17:05] her take thee with her eyelids
[17:07] for by means of a horse woman a man is
[17:09] brought to a piece of bread
[17:11] and the adulteress will hunt for his
[17:14] precious life
[17:15] so there we see how satan anoints women
[17:18] or men to hunt after believers in order
[17:21] to try to deceive them and get them to
[17:23] fall into sexual sin
[17:25] that reminds us of how satan is as a
[17:26] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[17:30] the fifth warning is that if you do not
[17:32] overcome sexual lusts it will destroy
[17:35] your soul and you could be lost
[17:38] you can lose the anointing of god as
[17:39] jesus said because you can believe for a
[17:41] while but then forfeit that belief or
[17:44] that anointing through transgression as
[17:46] judas iscariot did
[17:48] luke 8 13 records jesus saying you can
[17:51] believe for a while he said which for a
[17:53] while believe and in time of temptation
[17:56] fall away
[17:58] proverbs 6 32 says but whoso committeth
[18:01] adultery with a woman lacketh
[18:02] understanding he that doeth it
[18:04] destroyeth his own soul
[18:07] so friend if you're not already
[18:08] convinced pornography is not worth
[18:11] losing your soul over
[18:12] it's a degrading shameful wicked
[18:14] addiction steals all your christian
[18:16] anointing so choose life choose eternal
[18:19] life through jesus christ our lord
[18:22] the sixth warning is for men to know
[18:24] that you are programmed to reproduce and
[18:26] desire sexual relations so you must
[18:28] recognize that this is the battle you
[18:30] have been called to fight and win
[18:34] we see men programmed to be visually
[18:36] stimulated and programmed with the
[18:38] desire to reproduce in numerous
[18:39] scriptures such as paul in 1st
[18:42] corinthians 7 9 saying for it's better
[18:44] to marry than to burn that means to burn
[18:46] with fire
[18:48] so sexual desire is like a fire in many
[18:50] men
[18:52] also in exodus 19 verse 15 the bible
[18:54] said be ready against the third day come
[18:56] not at your wives
[18:58] so notice it's the man coming or
[19:00] pursuing the wife for sexual relations
[19:02] he's driven to that
[19:04] also jesus only mentioned men lusting in
[19:07] their minds in matthew 5 28 but of
[19:10] course we know some sisters may battle
[19:11] that
[19:12] but he said whosoever looketh on a woman
[19:15] to lust after her hath committed
[19:16] adultery with her already in his heart
[19:20] and then job said he made a covenant to
[19:22] not look upon maids in job 31 verse 1.
[19:27] so brothers you must be ready to fight
[19:28] and put on the armor of god you have to
[19:31] approach each day knowing you're going
[19:32] to be tempted
[19:34] that lustful desire or craving is going
[19:36] to pass over you or pass through your
[19:38] flesh
[19:39] as brother brahm said something passes
[19:41] over men when they see a sexual
[19:43] temptation
[19:44] so we have to resist that feeling if we
[19:46] give into it then we've got to repent
[19:48] quickly
[19:49] so it's not if we'll be tempted but when
[19:52] and for some it's a daily battle
[19:53] sometimes all throughout the day
[19:55] here's a quote where brother brown said
[19:57] a healthy man is something pass over him
[19:59] every time he sees a sexy woman let's
[20:01] listen to the
[20:05] all stripped down quotes don't care who
[20:06] the man is if he's a healthy normal man
[20:08] when he looks at the woman he's bound to
[20:10] have something to pass over him i'd just
[20:12] be honest
[20:14] i don't care i've had the holy ghost for
[20:16] years you can't look at a woman her head
[20:19] dressed i i carry a little cross in my
[20:22] heart many of you seen it somebody said
[20:24] to me are you a catholic before did the
[20:26] catholics ever get optioned on the cross
[20:28] the cross means christian
[20:32] my friends i don't know the physiology
[20:34] of this but i know it's a reality
[20:35] brothers i know and myself i feel that
[20:37] temptation pass over me so i've got to
[20:39] cast down those feelings and get my mind
[20:42] on things that are holy and things that
[20:43] please the lord jesus christ
[20:45] also brothers it's likely this is going
[20:47] to be a battle you'll have to fight for
[20:49] life
[20:50] at 50 years old brother brahm still
[20:52] talked about the need for the cross
[20:54] hanging in his car
[20:55] let's listen to the quote
[20:58] the other day friday wife and i was
[21:00] going to the store
[21:04] i don't mean to harp on this
[21:08] but as we went down the street i just
[21:10] kept turning ahead one way for the other
[21:12] naked women
[21:15] i promised god when i was a blind man if
[21:18] he'd healed my eyes i'd look at the
[21:20] thing was right
[21:24] i keep a little cross hanging in my car
[21:27] when i see such as that i look at the
[21:29] cross and say oh god
[21:31] that's my refuge
[21:34] as i looked at the cross
[21:39] on a personal note i was also told by my
[21:41] mother that before her father passed
[21:43] away who was my grandfather
[21:45] he was in the nursing home and even
[21:47] there as a man in his mid-80s he was
[21:50] still tempted to look at the nurses
[21:52] because of their beauty and he had to
[21:54] fight against that and overcome that by
[21:56] the grace of god so these are sobering
[21:58] things and our brothers must remember
[22:00] this is a daily battle so we must have
[22:02] daily prayer and victory through that
[22:04] daily prayer
[22:05] the seventh warning is that you're going
[22:07] to sin every day so be quick to repent
[22:11] numerous scriptures point to the fact
[22:12] that we sin every day first john 1 verse
[22:14] 10
[22:15] if we say we've not sinned we make him a
[22:17] liar and his word is not in us first
[22:20] corinthians 15 31 paul says i die daily
[22:24] matthew 6 verse 11 and 12 give us this
[22:27] day our daily bread and forgive us our
[22:29] debts as we forgive our debtors
[22:32] now some days you might sin by lying
[22:34] complaining or lusting jesus said if
[22:36] you've thought about sexual sin you've
[22:38] already committed it in your heart
[22:40] so confess right away don't make it an
[22:42] addiction
[22:44] each day we're guilty of some type of
[22:46] sin like every other person on the face
[22:48] of the earth so just humble yourself and
[22:50] repent
[22:52] remember jesus said unjustified anger
[22:54] against the brother is the same as
[22:56] murder and that person is in danger of
[22:58] the hell fire
[23:00] so we realize we're going to battle sin
[23:02] every day we'll sin at least once a day
[23:04] so no matter what the sin is let's
[23:06] confess it right away and get our
[23:08] garments clean and white through the
[23:09] blood of jesus christ
[23:11] the eighth warning is that there will be
[23:13] consequences to sexual sin
[23:16] again looking at david he lost numerous
[23:18] family members due to his adultery with
[23:20] bathsheba and the murder of uriah
[23:23] look at solomon especially as his wives
[23:26] turned his heart away from god and god
[23:28] became angry with him and fought against
[23:30] him
[23:31] so depending upon the degree of your
[23:32] sexual sin there will be different
[23:34] degrees of consequences you've got to
[23:36] humble yourself deal with those
[23:38] consequences
[23:39] and express christian character through
[23:41] those consequences and that will humble
[23:43] you and make you a better servant to the
[23:45] lord jesus christ and then next time
[23:47] you'll overcome that sexual temptation
[23:51] the ninth warning is that we're warned
[23:53] not to live in fantasy or fiction
[23:55] stories
[23:56] we find this in first timothy four verse
[23:58] seven the bible said refuse profanin and
[24:01] old wives fables
[24:03] and exercise thyself rather unto
[24:05] godliness
[24:07] so we must not live in fantasy this also
[24:09] applies to video games and sexual
[24:12] fantasies and fiction books
[24:14] paul specifically said to avoid fables
[24:17] or fiction stories which means men
[24:19] should avoid wasting their precious time
[24:22] on fictional things
[24:24] we must redeem the time paul says
[24:26] because the days are evil and that's in
[24:28] ephesians 5 verses 15 through 17. the
[24:32] tenth warning is that we're warned to
[24:34] not rob our spouses of sexual
[24:36] satisfaction
[24:37] by paul in first corinthians 7 verses 2
[24:40] through 5.
[24:42] paul said defraud ye not one the other
[24:44] and defraud means to rob
[24:47] in this text paul says
[24:49] the body of the husband belongs to the
[24:51] wife and vice versa
[24:53] so when one spouse has sexual desires
[24:56] the other spouse should meet those
[24:57] desires
[24:58] of course everything in the marriage bed
[25:01] should be wholly agreed upon as brother
[25:03] brahms said let's listen to the quote
[25:06] you just be a husband be a sweetheart
[25:09] respect her like you always respect her
[25:11] don't pay attention
[25:13] non-sexy books and are these nonsense in
[25:15] this sexy books and things that you read
[25:17] about and all this stuff and everything
[25:19] like that get that filthy stuff out of
[25:20] your mind
[25:22] the bible said not let one
[25:24] dirty conversation come among you
[25:27] be real real nice and respect one other
[25:30] business and your your family relations
[25:32] and so forth like that let it be just as
[25:34] reverently godly and agreed with among
[25:36] you and everything as it can be don't
[25:38] never push and shove and and be dirty
[25:41] and vulgar
[25:42] understand talk to your wife if one
[25:44] nature's to you and should know the
[25:45] nature of her talking with her you you
[25:47] try to do the same thing to him sister
[25:49] in the same way understand one another
[25:51] and be be real christian gentlemen real
[25:53] christian ladies
[25:58] also here's another quote from brother
[25:59] branham where he told a saved woman to
[26:02] continue having sexual relations with
[26:03] her unbelieving husband because if she
[26:06] didn't it would drive him further away
[26:08] from god let's listen to the quote
[26:12] should a save
[26:13] wife refuse herself to her husband if he
[26:16] is a sinner no sir
[26:19] no sir that's your husband
[26:21] you're driving farther away from god
[26:23] than ever by doing that see
[26:26] that's right brother sister you married
[26:28] him he's yours you're his
[26:32] and the 11th warning is your body is not
[26:34] your own it was purchased by the
[26:36] precious blood of jesus christ and you
[26:38] will answer for the deeds done in your
[26:40] body this is found in first corinthians
[26:42] 6 verses 18 through 20. second
[26:45] corinthians chapter 5 verses 10 and 11
[26:47] and first peter 1 verses 18 and 19.
[26:52] when you have the biblical perspective
[26:53] that your body is not your own and that
[26:55] it's a temple of the holy ghost it's
[26:57] much easier to turn down pornography or
[26:59] any sexual temptations because you
[27:01] realize your body is god's temple
[27:05] bible verses for victory over sexual sin
[27:10] the first verse is first corinthians 10
[27:12] verse 13.
[27:13] here we learn god always has a way of
[27:16] escape and you can overcome every
[27:17] temptation
[27:19] friend to overcome sexual temptation you
[27:21] just have to begin looking for ways out
[27:24] god won't allow you to be tested above
[27:26] that you are able to overcome
[27:28] the second truth we gain from the
[27:30] scripture is you're not alone even if
[27:32] you are high passioned
[27:34] all men and women have faced sexual
[27:36] temptations
[27:37] and every believer has overcome and so
[27:40] can you
[27:41] temptation is common to all men
[27:43] as brother branham said some men might
[27:45] be more high passion than others some
[27:47] men are women but if that's you then
[27:49] take courage god trusts you that you'll
[27:52] overcome that passion for he allowed you
[27:54] to have it and he will use your
[27:56] overcoming testimony on the day of
[27:58] judgment against men and women who were
[28:00] high passion but made excuses and chose
[28:03] to feed the flesh or feed the black dog
[28:05] rather than starving it and feeding the
[28:07] white dog or the divine nature
[28:10] then brother branham said men go to
[28:12] sexual lusts to find comfort but then he
[28:14] thanked god saying we still have christ
[28:16] to go to for comfort praise the lord
[28:19] let's listen to the quote from he cares
[28:20] do you care
[28:23] and maybe a man's born high passionate
[28:26] he sees these modern stripteases on the
[28:28] street and he is constantly in trouble
[28:31] see he uh that the man is born like that
[28:34] night
[28:36] and now we find all those things is
[28:40] because people are trying to find
[28:43] comfort
[28:45] they're trying to find something that
[28:47] they and remember your comfort is your
[28:50] religion
[28:52] and you make those things your religion
[28:55] see
[28:57] just let me ask you something
[29:00] you can't believe nothing
[29:02] hardly but the bible
[29:04] we still have christ thanks to god
[29:09] recognize if you are high passion and
[29:11] then have a plan
[29:12] do what jesus did early morning prayer
[29:16] and remember you can also get rid of
[29:17] your cell phone or internet service get
[29:20] a flip phone that has internet but not
[29:22] websites and images
[29:24] also start a ministry to fill your time
[29:26] and if you feel that get an
[29:27] accountability partner you are more than
[29:30] able to overcome
[29:32] the third bible truth is that we have
[29:33] greater power and better promises than
[29:36] old testament saints
[29:37] this is seen in the book of hebrews and
[29:39] also john 7 verses 37 through 39
[29:42] because the holy ghost in power cannot
[29:44] be given until after jesus died and was
[29:47] glorified
[29:48] friends even think about the old
[29:49] testament saints if joseph and job could
[29:52] overcome sexual temptation in the old
[29:54] testament under the blood of bulls and
[29:56] goats we can surely overcome it under
[29:59] the new testament and the precious blood
[30:01] of jesus christ
[30:02] remember joseph overcame daily sexual
[30:05] advances of potiphar's wife so you can
[30:07] surely overcome the daily advances you
[30:09] see on the cell phone or billboards
[30:13] joseph didn't even have the baptism of
[30:14] the holy ghost so it's clear each one of
[30:17] us need the baptism of the holy ghost
[30:19] and true justification and true
[30:20] sanctification
[30:23] the fourth scripture is psalms 101 verse
[30:25] 3
[30:26] and we learn train yourself to set only
[30:29] holy things before your eyes as the holy
[30:32] ghost taught david
[30:34] saying i will set no wicked thing before
[30:36] my eyes
[30:38] it's a training so it's going to take
[30:39] victory one day and you got to take that
[30:41] same victory build on it and do it the
[30:43] next day but you can train your eyes to
[30:45] do that by god's grace
[30:47] fifth remember you can do all things
[30:49] through christ
[30:50] through his word and his anointing
[30:53] because with god all things are possible
[30:55] we find these scriptures in philippians
[30:57] 4 verses 12 and 13 and mark 10 verses 26
[31:01] and 27.
[31:04] paul could overcome physical hunger and
[31:06] physical suffering through the strength
[31:08] of jesus christ then surely you and i
[31:10] can overcome our spiritual needs when
[31:12] we're in need of strength to overcome
[31:14] sexual temptations
[31:16] and we'll do that through receiving the
[31:17] strength of the word of god the
[31:19] anointing of the holy ghost
[31:22] sixth scripture says you are more than a
[31:24] conqueror in your tests of faith because
[31:27] you are called to reign in this life as
[31:29] a king and priest according to romans 8
[31:32] 35-37
[31:34] romans 5 17
[31:35] revelation 1 verse 6
[31:37] and jude 1 verses 20 and 21
[31:41] friends we reign in this life
[31:43] take your control back over your mind
[31:45] and body you are a spiritual king and
[31:48] priest
[31:50] you rule you lead you take control and
[31:53] then you pray like a priest like jesus
[31:56] and remember jude 1 says praying builds
[31:59] up your most holy faith
[32:02] seventh resist satan's thoughts with the
[32:05] greatest weapon and make satan flee
[32:10] we find these truths in james 4 verse 7
[32:13] and matthew chapter 4
[32:15] like jesus overcame satan himself by
[32:18] simply quoting and obeying the word in
[32:20] matthew chapter 4 when he was tempted
[32:22] three times of satan so can you do the
[32:24] same
[32:26] the weapon is the sword of the spirit
[32:28] which is speaking and obeying the word
[32:30] of god
[32:31] it is the law of god james tells us
[32:33] resist satan and satan has to flee
[32:36] he'll flee because you're drawing nigh
[32:38] to god you're drawing nigh to that holy
[32:40] presence and he'll realize he can't
[32:42] overcome that holy presence
[32:44] also when you resist satan with the word
[32:46] you've now got rule over your mind or
[32:49] human spirit as proverbs 25 verse 28
[32:51] says he that hath no rule over his own
[32:54] spirit is like a city that is broken
[32:56] down and without walls
[32:58] when you don't resist satan it's like
[33:00] having no walls to protect your city and
[33:02] satan can just walk into your mind with
[33:05] no hindrances and spoil your city or
[33:07] spoil your thoughts the human flesh will
[33:11] always naturally love lusts of the eyes
[33:13] because there's no good thing in our
[33:15] flesh according to romans 7 verse 18
[33:19] the human mind is different sometimes we
[33:20] love the word of god and other times we
[33:23] accept bad thoughts
[33:24] and we don't think about the word of god
[33:26] like we should
[33:27] satan has full access to our minds for
[33:30] it is the battlefield and he attacks our
[33:32] minds with past memories lustful images
[33:36] on our phones or devices or billboards
[33:38] so this means you've got to daily renew
[33:40] your mind in holiness and godliness as
[33:42] we saw jesus doing earlier and also you
[33:45] see that in romans 12 verses 1 and 2
[33:48] where it says transform your mind by the
[33:50] renewing of your mind
[33:52] and you also see it in second
[33:53] corinthians 4 verse 16 that says though
[33:56] our outward man perish yet the inward
[33:58] man is renewed day by day
[34:01] so the stronger you are in the word of
[34:03] god thinking and meditating on the word
[34:05] of god the more you'll be able to resist
[34:07] satan
[34:08] and just a short testimony a brother
[34:10] emailed me overseas numerous times and
[34:13] he often battled porn and i asked him
[34:15] when have you resisted pornography
[34:19] he thought about this he thought about
[34:20] james 4 verse 7 and this led to his
[34:23] victory
[34:24] at least as far as i know i hope his
[34:26] victory's still going on
[34:28] but the last time i heard from him he
[34:30] that he had had victory over pornography
[34:32] for at least two weeks i believe it was
[34:34] so we can't stop resisting we have to
[34:36] resist satan and the bible promises he
[34:38] will flee
[34:40] the eighth truth is that you should know
[34:43] you will have seasons of relief
[34:46] we find this most wonderful truth that
[34:48] satan will leave for a season
[34:50] as luke 4 verse 13 says when the devil
[34:53] had ended all the temptation he departed
[34:55] from him speaking of jesus for a season
[34:59] also acts 9 31 said then had the
[35:02] churches rest throughout all judea and
[35:04] galilee and samaria
[35:07] so when we resist satan we understand
[35:09] there will be seasons of harsh battle
[35:12] but then there'll also be seasons of
[35:13] relief where we don't battle as much or
[35:15] as often
[35:17] so complete victory is possible because
[35:19] you recognize there are seasons of
[35:21] battle that are harder than others and
[35:23] you can prepare for those seasons
[35:25] and you do that like jesus did through
[35:27] daily prayer building up your most holy
[35:29] faith
[35:31] a ninth bible truth is that we must
[35:34] commit to daily crucifying or mortifying
[35:36] the sinful affections and lusts as jesus
[35:40] christ and paul commanded us
[35:43] you find this in luke 9 23
[35:46] luke 14 27 galatians 5 24 and romans 8
[35:50] 13.
[35:52] if jesus endured a physical cross so you
[35:54] didn't have to we can surely endure a
[35:57] spiritual cross or death to self
[36:00] and the bodily and mental passions
[36:02] cravings and desires can be crucified
[36:06] in order to glorify jesus christ in our
[36:08] lives
[36:09] for some people overcoming pornography
[36:11] is a slow death it's a slow victory but
[36:14] yet a victory nonetheless other people
[36:16] they can just be delivered instantly
[36:18] that's all by the grace of god and by
[36:20] the plan of god and also by the free
[36:21] moral agency of the believer as well
[36:24] but there's also the fact that every day
[36:26] you must crucify and stop all the lust
[36:29] of the flesh lust of the eyes and the
[36:31] pride of life
[36:32] and jesus said if you don't do that you
[36:33] cannot be his disciple for he said his
[36:36] disciples will take up their crosses
[36:37] daily and follow him the 10th bible
[36:41] verse says that real repentance is
[36:43] having a zeal to obey god the next time
[36:46] porn is presented to you this is found
[36:49] in second corinthians 7 verses 10
[36:51] through 11.
[36:53] the bible said godly sorrow brings you
[36:55] to a spiritual carefulness
[36:58] you want to clear yourself from the sin
[37:00] you have a vehement desire or zeal to
[37:04] get revenge on the devil
[37:06] this will help people to know if they've
[37:08] repented or not if you've really
[37:10] repented then you have a desire or zeal
[37:12] to not fall to that sin the next time if
[37:15] not you need to keep praying and keep
[37:17] dying out to yourself and have a
[37:19] thorough repentance
[37:21] this is a good time to bring up the box
[37:23] of rattlesnakes that brother brown
[37:24] talked about
[37:25] you should hate pornography so much
[37:28] because of what it felt like the last
[37:30] time you accepted the box of
[37:31] rattlesnakes or pornography
[37:34] that you can't wait to refuse the box
[37:36] the rattlesnakes the next time satan
[37:38] brings it
[37:41] and eleventh truth is focus on the
[37:43] solution not the problem
[37:45] as brother ram told us in the church age
[37:47] book
[37:48] it really doesn't matter what we are to
[37:50] overcome
[37:51] he said for is not so much what we are
[37:53] to overcome but how we are to overcome
[37:56] he said it does not matter much what we
[37:59] are to overcome as long as we know how
[38:01] we can overcome and that's what this
[38:03] video has been about
[38:04] pointing us to the bible scriptures that
[38:06] tell us how to overcome
[38:08] you overcome like jesus by the spirit
[38:10] and the word you quote the word and the
[38:12] holy spirit anoints you to obey that
[38:14] word of god
[38:16] so focus on the word just like god
[38:18] showed joshua the three-step process for
[38:20] spiritual strength and courage in joshua
[38:23] chapter one the first step is of course
[38:25] repent the second is remember god's with
[38:28] you like he was with moses or god is
[38:30] with us like he was with brother branham
[38:32] and then third meditate upon the word
[38:34] and speak the word
[38:36] see your house has to be filled with the
[38:38] anointing of god you can't let satan
[38:40] come into your house and bind the strong
[38:42] man of faith
[38:43] and also remember that brother brahm
[38:44] said you're not an overcomer unless
[38:47] you're overcoming
[38:48] so i know that's what you want that's
[38:49] why you're watching this video and god
[38:51] will help you to be an overcomer and
[38:53] then you'll know you are one of those
[38:55] overcomers out of laodicea by the grace
[38:57] of god and you'll get the rewards you'll
[38:59] sit with christ on the throne with the
[39:01] other overcoming saints from all seven
[39:03] church ages
[39:05] a 12 scripture
[39:06] is mark 9 25 and this shows in jesus
[39:10] name and authority we have the power to
[39:12] keep satan out of our lives for good
[39:15] mark 9 25 shows jesus rebuking a foul
[39:18] spirit and he said enter no more into
[39:21] him that was divine command that foul
[39:24] spirit was never going to come back into
[39:26] that individual because jesus commanded
[39:29] it now we can use that same power
[39:32] and that's the power i've received as
[39:33] i'll share in my testimony we have power
[39:36] and authority to rebuke those sexual
[39:38] demons those lust devils and have power
[39:40] and authority over them and command them
[39:42] that they'll never come back
[39:44] but of course he'll still come to tempt
[39:46] and will come with an even stronger
[39:48] temptation but as long as your house is
[39:50] filled with the anointing of god the
[39:52] strong man is there in the house you'll
[39:54] turn them down you won't accept the box
[39:56] of rattlesnakes because you know better
[39:58] and now you've got the victory by the
[40:00] grace of god
[40:02] the 13th scripture is that
[40:04] life is in your tongue proverbs 18 verse
[40:07] 21
[40:08] death and life are in the power of the
[40:09] tongue and they that love it shall eat
[40:11] the fruit thereof
[40:12] if you speak all these verses i've
[40:14] listed here in faith
[40:16] and faith is trust or assurance
[40:18] then these scriptures cannot fail just
[40:21] as the scriptures did not fail in jesus
[40:23] mouth when he overcame satan's three
[40:25] temptations in the wilderness
[40:27] remember you just can't speak it you've
[40:29] got to speak it and obey the word of god
[40:32] that's the spirit and the word working
[40:34] together
[40:35] that's the mechanics and the dynamics by
[40:37] the grace of god
[40:39] and lastly number 14
[40:41] i just want to give a summary again for
[40:43] overcoming james 4 verses 7 and 8 say
[40:46] this submit yourselves therefore to god
[40:48] so don't submit yourself to the devil
[40:50] don't submit yourself to pornography
[40:52] resist the devil and he will flee from
[40:54] you draw nigh to god and he will draw an
[40:57] eye to you
[40:58] so we see this summary again repent
[41:00] which means hate your sin and expose the
[41:03] enemy
[41:04] second resist the temptation one day at
[41:06] a time
[41:07] which also means crucifying lustful
[41:09] passions every day
[41:11] if you resist satan has to flee
[41:14] that's thus saith the bible
[41:17] third focus on the good
[41:19] get busy
[41:20] doing a ministry for jesus maybe start a
[41:23] ministry help someone else's ministry
[41:25] redeem the time and serve others
[41:28] getting your mind off of yourself being
[41:31] addicted to pornography is so selfish
[41:33] it's all about you but a christian has
[41:35] eternal life they live for other people
[41:38] so when you serve others that helps you
[41:40] get your mind off yourself and onto
[41:42] people that god has called you to serve
[41:45] because ephesians 2 verse 10 says god
[41:47] created you the works that you need to
[41:49] do before the foundation of the world he
[41:51] created you unto good works
[41:53] so take the word of god in your mind and
[41:55] go do those good works and glorify the
[41:57] father which is in heaven
[42:01] my testimony about overcoming sexual sin
[42:05] i felt it would be helpful to share a
[42:07] little bit about my personal testimony
[42:09] overcoming sexual sins
[42:11] by god's grace i've had victory over
[42:13] this demonic spirit and have it for at
[42:15] least 19 years
[42:16] all glory to our lord jesus christ
[42:20] this battle began when i was either in
[42:21] second or third grade i was not raised
[42:23] in the message god gave to brother
[42:25] branham i was raised in a pentecostal
[42:27] trinitarian church
[42:28] one night i stayed the night at a
[42:30] friend's house and watched mtv for the
[42:32] first time
[42:33] i was instantly hooked on the spirit of
[42:35] lust
[42:36] so much so that i started drawing my own
[42:37] baseball cards at home with women in
[42:40] bikinis on the cards
[42:42] that moment of mtv is still quite vivid
[42:45] in my mind all these years later
[42:47] as much as i wish i could forget it
[42:49] but this shows again how men are
[42:51] visually stimulated
[42:53] and i'm not the only one scarred by
[42:54] sinful images as one brother in the lord
[42:56] i've talked to still remembers seeing
[42:58] his first dirty magazine when he was
[43:00] just in kindergarten
[43:02] that moment is still vivid in his mind
[43:04] and he's still got to battle those
[43:05] thoughts
[43:06] in difficult seasons when satan returns
[43:09] to tempt him just like i've got to
[43:10] battle my thoughts
[43:12] as i grew and entered junior high in
[43:14] high school my friends introduced me to
[43:15] pornographic magazines and wicked movies
[43:19] the movies were not officially
[43:20] pornographic which i greatly thank god
[43:22] for but still contained lots of evil
[43:25] sexual content
[43:27] then around 1998 or 1999 when i was
[43:30] finishing high school the internet
[43:31] arrived
[43:32] and a friend showed me how to access
[43:34] sinful pictures
[43:35] i remained enslaved to lust for about
[43:37] three more years i would hide out in my
[43:40] house in different rooms looking at
[43:41] filthy magazines
[43:43] and during my first few years of college
[43:45] i would rent a laptop from the library
[43:47] and spend more time on sinful pictures
[43:50] than studying
[43:51] but thankfully deliverance came in 2002
[43:54] when my brother introduced me to the
[43:56] message god gave to william branham
[43:59] before this time i didn't think that
[44:00] deliverance was possible but listening
[44:02] to brother branham preach about the
[44:03] power of jesus christ i realized total
[44:06] deliverance was indeed possible for me
[44:08] my victory came later in college after i
[44:11] repented of my addiction to lustful
[44:13] images and began resisting satan with
[44:15] the word of god
[44:17] i refused to take the library laptops to
[44:19] secluded areas i would work on the
[44:21] laptop in the public spaces around other
[44:24] people
[44:25] i stopped watching dirty movies i would
[44:27] just walk right by the tv when my
[44:29] roommates were watching sex scenes or
[44:31] movies that had sex scenes in them
[44:33] i fill my mind with the word of god
[44:36] listening to brother branham writing out
[44:37] bible studies reading books about the
[44:39] bible and more
[44:40] i began to hate pornography and the
[44:42] guilt and shame it brought to my life
[44:44] true repentance finally came to my heart
[44:46] and life
[44:47] and i'd like to humbly share that god
[44:49] help me overcome these sexual addictions
[44:51] without special computer software or
[44:54] anything else other than the word of god
[44:57] now some men and women might need that
[44:59] in the early stages of their victory or
[45:01] maybe even all throughout their lives
[45:03] and that's between them and god
[45:05] each person should strive to have a
[45:07] testimony that pleases god
[45:09] thankfully jesus fully delivered me from
[45:12] my sinful addictions before i was
[45:14] married in 2003
[45:17] then the lord called me to preach in
[45:18] 2004 and i've stayed completely free
[45:21] from sexual addiction from around 2002
[45:24] to 2003 until today by the marvelous
[45:27] grace of our lord jesus christ
[45:30] i came to the conclusion that i had the
[45:32] authority to cast out satan out of my
[45:34] mind and keep him out forever as jesus
[45:37] said in mark 9 25
[45:40] i quoted this verse then and still do
[45:42] today telling satan that he cannot enter
[45:45] into my mind and get me addicted the son
[45:48] has set me free in the holy name of
[45:50] jesus christ
[45:52] today as a pastor of a small message
[45:54] church and father of eight children i'm
[45:56] human so i'm still subject to daily
[45:58] battles of lustful thoughts
[46:00] but also temptations from the other two
[46:02] channels lust of the flesh and pride of
[46:04] life and i'm aware brother branham said
[46:06] preachers will battle three main
[46:08] temptations
[46:09] money popularity and women i've
[46:11] experienced that these battles are
[46:13] seasonal as well
[46:15] but as i resist satan he eventually has
[46:17] to flee
[46:19] brother branham had to put up a cross in
[46:21] his car because of all the sexy dressed
[46:23] women that walked on the streets
[46:25] even at the age of 50 he talked about
[46:27] this so the battle was real for him
[46:30] likely for his entire life
[46:32] recall the brother random quote about
[46:34] any healthy red-blooded man will have
[46:35] something pass over him every time he
[46:37] sees a sexy dressed woman which is true
[46:40] this is likely going to happen every day
[46:42] but we will daily cast down any
[46:44] imagination that exalts itself against
[46:46] the word of god
[46:48] we know satan will return at a later
[46:49] season so we must constantly fill our
[46:52] mind with the word of god every single
[46:54] day the more the better
[46:56] brother branham said every christian
[46:58] sins every single day if every christian
[47:00] sins at least once a day and then more
[47:03] than one on some days
[47:04] sexual lust might be one of those sins
[47:07] but if it's quickly confessed it is
[47:09] forgiven by the blood of jesus christ
[47:11] that's why we need the blood of jesus
[47:13] christ every single day of our lives
[47:16] if a man says he does not sin each day
[47:18] he's a liar as first john 1 verses 7
[47:21] through 10 states
[47:23] but god is so faithful to cleanse us
[47:24] daily as we daily confess our sins
[47:28] here's the quotes where brother brahm
[47:29] says we sin every day let's listen to
[47:31] the
[47:34] [Applause]
[47:37] there's none quote sin every day you've
[47:39] seen
[47:40] paul said he had to die daily and if we
[47:42] say we sin and have those then then the
[47:44] bible says we make god to lie
[47:46] and we could not do that so we sin daily
[47:50] and it's great god's grace that saves us
[47:52] as we confess our loans god's just to
[47:54] forgive them
[47:56] and your
[47:57] your confession as long as it holds good
[47:59] your salvation is perfect same as with
[48:01] divine healing it's your personal faith
[48:04] and a resurrected lord jesus
[48:09] here's a quote where brother branham
[48:10] says we sin every day yes sir
[48:12] but he says we're perfected or made
[48:14] perfect or completed because we're in
[48:17] jesus christ or we're baptized with the
[48:19] holy ghost and we've got a ticket to
[48:21] present to the enemy
[48:23] the promise of jesus christ where he
[48:25] said he that heareth my words and
[48:26] believeth on him that sent me has
[48:28] eternal life and shall never come to the
[48:30] judgment but is passed from death unto
[48:32] life that's our ticket friends let's
[48:35] listen to the quote
[48:37] how we got that this morning how that we
[48:39] are perfected
[48:41] perfected
[48:43] absolutely
[48:45] spotless and blameless
[48:48] not one sin on us amen
[48:52] are you above temptation never
[48:55] do you sin every day yes sir
[48:58] but yet we are perfected because
[49:01] we are in him
[49:04] and god could no more judge us and
[49:06] nothing couldn't be righteous he's
[49:07] already judged us in him
[49:10] when he judged christ he judged me
[49:13] he judged you
[49:15] and he can't judge me again because he
[49:17] took my judgment
[49:20] if i've been redeemed and i got a ticket
[49:22] to show that i redeemed my watch in the
[49:23] pawnshop let somebody try to take it
[49:25] back to pawn shop once
[49:27] when i've got a ticket i have redeemed
[49:31] it
[49:32] as the devil will try to put punishment
[49:35] on me i've got a ticket
[49:37] that shows i've been redeemed
[49:41] yes sir no more judgment
[49:44] he they heareth thy words believeth on
[49:46] him and send me has eternal life and
[49:50] shall never come to the judgment but has
[49:53] passed from death unto life
[49:56] that's particular
[50:01] in another quote brother adam said he
[50:03] sinned daily and had thousands of
[50:04] mistakes or sins in a year
[50:07] this equates to at least one sin per day
[50:10] and on other days up to five or more
[50:11] sins per day but brother branham said
[50:13] the power of the gospel is the blood of
[50:15] jesus christ forgiving all of our sins
[50:18] and then we move on serving god let's
[50:20] listen to the quote
[50:23] i have no holiness to present to him
[50:25] but i'm trusting in his
[50:28] oh his grace
[50:30] and i have it in my heart i want
[50:32] meredith nothing i could do to deserve
[50:35] it by my grace he called me and invited
[50:37] me to come
[50:39] and i looked to him and he took the
[50:40] desire away from me
[50:42] i'll make thousands of mistakes even
[50:44] each month
[50:46] and each year
[50:47] showing that everybody when i see them
[50:48] wrong i said god didn't mean to do that
[50:49] you know my heart
[50:51] but it means to do that i was trapped
[50:53] into that
[50:54] i didn't mean to do you forgive me lord
[50:56] if i'd done wrong to my brother i said
[50:57] brother forgive me i didn't mean to do
[50:59] that certainly god knows my heart
[51:03] oh there you are
[51:05] there's the blood sacrifice there's the
[51:07] power of the gospel that holy church
[51:09] moving on
[51:10] not because something you've done it's
[51:12] something you had nothing to do with
[51:15] there's the atonement
[51:19] brother rams quote about the river of no
[51:21] return movie
[51:23] one of my viewers on youtube was a
[51:25] critic of brother branham
[51:27] and thought brother branham taught it
[51:28] was acceptable to watch movies since
[51:30] brother ram said he watched the marilyn
[51:32] monroe movie called river of no return
[51:35] bill graham said he made time to watch
[51:36] the movie and saw marilyn sexy dressed
[51:39] this critic then blamed brother branham
[51:41] for her father's mistreatment of women
[51:43] but of course i believe that's a false
[51:45] accusation
[51:46] let's listen to the quote and then i'll
[51:47] make some comments that i shared with
[51:49] this viewer
[51:52] now
[51:52] when i was in canada the other day my
[51:54] kids kept telling me over a certain
[51:57] place where a lady let us have the house
[51:59] had a television and they said there's
[52:02] going to be a play called the river of
[52:04] no return that's the river i fish on all
[52:07] time and don smith a friend of mine
[52:09] takes that tour said they made a movie
[52:11] of it and said daddy maybe that mr smith
[52:14] is on the program
[52:16] would you like to look at it well i said
[52:18] when i come back from canada if i'm
[52:19] making time i'll look at it well when
[52:21] the play didn't come on i went over to
[52:23] see it went to see it
[52:25] and when i did
[52:26] who was playing in it but marilyn monroe
[52:29] now there she was after being dead a
[52:31] year ago
[52:33] there she was all sexy dressed
[52:36] that was her voice
[52:38] upon still playing and will be for years
[52:40] and years of all that magnetic tape
[52:43] if that magnetic tape holds her action
[52:47] when if she could look from where she is
[52:49] tonight
[52:50] i trust she's the same
[52:52] but i don't know that's the god but if
[52:54] she can look back she cannot deny it
[52:58] she can't deny this because we've got it
[53:01] how much more has got god ever move
[53:04] every action upon his great supreme
[53:07] faith that'll be we cannot get out of it
[53:13] i'm going to read portions of this
[53:14] viewer's comment on youtube
[53:16] she wrote quote do you have any plans on
[53:19] making a video about men in the church
[53:20] looking at pornography and lust
[53:23] your channel is weirdly quiet on those
[53:26] topics that need addressed
[53:27] which is common considering you're a
[53:29] message preacher
[53:30] but the women
[53:32] message mentality end quote
[53:35] so here's some of what i wrote back to
[53:36] the viewer quote friend i often preach
[53:39] against the lust of the eyes and
[53:40] pornography you can listen to my sermons
[53:43] on our youtube channel at bride of
[53:45] christ fellowship akron
[53:47] i hope to make a video on the lust of
[53:48] the eyes at some point end quote the
[53:51] woman commented again and said that she
[53:54] was raised in the message and she said
[53:56] quote it is my observation that the main
[53:58] focus and hard preaching is reserved for
[54:00] women of the church
[54:02] all blame is placed on women the men of
[54:04] the message have no problem watching
[54:06] marilyn monroe in river of no return
[54:08] because their profit did and the double
[54:10] standard is clear to most women in the
[54:12] message
[54:13] end quote
[54:14] and the woman went on to say that her
[54:16] dad was a message preacher
[54:18] and he would watch certain shows as long
[54:19] as there wasn't cuss words on them but
[54:21] they could have immorally dressed women
[54:23] on them
[54:24] so my reply was i'm sorry to hear the
[54:26] people in your life who claim to believe
[54:28] the message didn't follow scripture
[54:30] here's a few things i hope will help you
[54:32] first brother brahm does not place all
[54:34] blame on women it is a shared blame in
[54:37] the church age book brother ram taught
[54:38] god put the blame on adam on page 104
[54:43] if a church put blame only on women or
[54:45] treated women as second-class citizens
[54:47] they were sadly deceived
[54:49] regarding brother branham watching river
[54:51] of no return you and i don't know how
[54:53] much he watched of it
[54:55] you and i don't know if the holy spirit
[54:57] had him turn his head at scenes that
[54:59] showed immoral clothing
[55:01] so please don't judge brother branham
[55:02] because you weren't there you are
[55:04] jumping to conclusions as for me i would
[55:07] never watch those kind of movies nor
[55:09] watch any tv shows because the bible
[55:11] says to put no wicked thing before our
[55:13] eyes in psalms 101 verse 3. if any
[55:16] person liked watching tv shows with
[55:19] sexually dressed women they were sinning
[55:21] so again friends it's sad you know this
[55:23] viewer is very critical brother branham
[55:25] doesn't believe the message and use that
[55:27] one quote to jump to conclusions and
[55:29] make it seem like brother brown liked
[55:31] watching movies with sexy dressed women
[55:33] on him which we know that's not the case
[55:35] again we don't know if the holy ghost
[55:37] had him turn his head for those scenes
[55:38] we don't know how much of the movie he
[55:40] actually watched and we don't know if he
[55:42] repented about it later we have no idea
[55:44] so we want to be gracious with brother
[55:46] branham since he's not here to ask
[55:48] questions just like we want people to be
[55:50] gracious with us
[55:52] so i would ask that critical viewer to
[55:53] please be merciful
[55:55] he that is without sin cast the first
[55:57] stone and we don't even know if brother
[55:58] branham sinned or not it's likely he
[56:00] didn't because he had outstanding
[56:02] christian character
[56:03] shunned evil preached holiness lived
[56:05] holiness
[56:07] and another word to the viewer if your
[56:09] dad or any other man idolized lust do
[56:12] you first look at yourself and see if
[56:14] you idolize certain things like gossip
[56:17] or fashion chocolate or coffee do you
[56:20] watch movies that have sex scenes in
[56:21] them of course i say these things with
[56:23] grace so that the person will think
[56:24] about themselves and how they're
[56:26] criticizing brother branham
[56:29] closing
[56:32] i hope this video has been a blessing
[56:33] friends it's been on my heart for years
[56:35] to make this
[56:37] and i felt like this would be the right
[56:38] time i could do it by the grace of god
[56:40] there's so many scriptures that give us
[56:42] warning and warnings are helpful and
[56:44] then there's so many scriptures that
[56:45] point us to the victory we can have over
[56:47] sexual sins through the power of the
[56:49] holy ghost
