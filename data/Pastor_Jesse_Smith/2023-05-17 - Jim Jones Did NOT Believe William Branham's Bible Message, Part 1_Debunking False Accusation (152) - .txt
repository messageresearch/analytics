TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] happy to see today is our first Pastor brother James Jones from Indianapolis back there and the pastor was weakling enough to let him get by with it shame on the pastors that fails his hand out in their Church greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to begin a short series proving that Jim Jones did not believe the bible-based message that God gave to his Prophet brother William Branham in March of 2023 one of Brothers accusers started a series on his podcast claiming that brother Branham is responsible for the acts of the evil con man and mass murder Jim Jones and of course this is a lie this is an awful false accusation it proves the cognitive dissonance of brother brahm's accuser and so by God's grace I'm starting a short series on this subject to prove hopefully once and for all that Jim Jones ultimately rejected the message the bible-based message that God gave to his Prophet brother William Branham and it was Jim Jones rejection of the Bible in his own lust of the Flesh and lust of the eyes and pride of life that led him down the path of self-destruction and ultimately mass murder let me also add a disclaimer about this series there's a lot of sensitive information that young children shouldn't hear on this series so I encourage everyone who listens just to make sure adults listen to these episodes about Jim Jones and brother Branham here's the outline for this short video series first we'll start with the accusation against brother Branham and also look at the character of brother Brown's accusers second we'll look at the one brother random quote about Jim Jones and their short Association third we'll look at brother branham's eight or nine warnings to Jim Jones and the Pastors in Jim Jones's church that Jim Jones failed to heed fourth we'll look at some historical facts about Jim Jones and Fifth and finally we'll have a summary a stark contrast between Jim Jones and brother Branham friends brother William Branham was a holy ghost filled anointed prophet of God who lived a Godly holy life Jim Jones is exactly the opposite as any honest person already knows who has honestly studied the life of Jim Jones Jim Jones was a mass murderer he was a drug addict he was a con man who amassed millions of dollars through swindling and deception he was a false prophet he was a whoremonger a bisexual he terrorized the people in his church torturing them depriving them of sleep he forced everyone to call him father or dad Jim Jones believed he was God Jim Jones believed in reincarnation he allowed his congregation to commit fornication and adultery openly he destroyed the nuclear family he let women cut their hair wear makeup and wear pants he was arrested for lewd sexual misconduct and claimed socialism was the real hero an answer for society so in short Jim Jones was a demon-possessed man the complete opposite of brother Branham who was filled with the Holy Ghost accusation and character of brother Brown's accusers according to one website of one of brother Ram's accusers he says quote William Branham preached a three-day campaign in June 1956 at the Catal Tabernacle in Indianapolis Indiana with Jim Jones this three-day campaign was attended by over 11 000 people and skyrocketed Jim Jones to Fame by following on the coattails of William Branham end quote while his true brother Ram did preach at Jim Jones's Church in 1956 Jim Jones rejected by the Rams bible-based teaching shortly after these meetings the accuser's website says brother Branham and Jim Jones worked together for two years if that's true which I don't know it's true then brother random lived eight years afterwards and never exalted praised or even recognized Jim Jones and again anyone who honestly studies Jim Jones teachings knows Jim Jones was not a bible message believer he was not a follower of William Branham in the least now let's look at the character of three of brother Ram's accusers that claim brother Branham is Guilty by association with Jim Jones how can we trust these three men these accusers of brother Branham that have such corrupt fruits such as the following list first these accusers claim brother Branham plagiarized the Seven Seals yet I have videos and podcasts that show that's a lie and brother random has over 38 differences between Clarence Larkin and Charles Taze Russell on the Seven Seals if brother and accusers won't do honest research about the Seven Seals how can they do honest research about Jim Jones second brother Ram's accusers claim God is three persons and they add to the Bible without any Scripture saying God is three persons so if they'll add to the Bible so freely how can we trust their research about Jim Jones third so my brother Brandon's accusers describe their podcasts and videos about brother Branham as being juicy which is gossip-like terminology how can we have confidence in men that engage in gossip and distort the truth so freely like these men fourth one of brother Brown's accusers says Halloween is fun and he watches Dracula movies and dresses up like Dracula and lets his children watch Dracula movies and Dracula is a blood-sucking abominable demonic fornicator and murderer how can we trust an accuser's research who rejoices in such a demonic character and dresses up like a demonic character like Dracula fifth some of Brothers accusers admit they watch filthy Hollywood movies with cuss words sex scenes murder scenes and more they also enjoy reading murder mystery books how can we trust the research of people that enjoy lust of the eyes and lust of the Flesh and failed to abstain from it like the Bible tells us to abstain from all appearances of evil six how can we trust researchers that grossly misinterpret quotes from Brother Branham in order to slander him on many occasions and this Jim Jones accusation is just one of the many misinterpretations [Music] seventh how can we trust men that allow women to cut their hair despite Paul forbidding it in First Corinthians 11 1-16 also how can we trust men that say there's only one work of Grace rather than three works of Grace as brother I'm taught and this one work of Grace essentially teaches that even a child is filled with the Holy Ghost after saying a scripted sinner's prayer which of course we know is not true next how can we trust men and accusers that allow their children to be married a second and third time some of brother Ram's accusers openly support adultery in other words alas how can we believe brothers accusers when they allow women to wear makeup and wear pants yet the Bible forbids both of course all these facts prove we cannot trust Brothers accusers so this accusation that brother Branham is somehow Guilty by association with Jim Jones is a major obvious sign of the cognitive dissonance on the part of brother Brown's accusers brother Ram's accusers are under a strong delusion they fail to recognize that Jim Jones is the same as the 70 preachers who left Jesus Jim Jones left the bible-based teachings of brother Branham just like the 70 preachers left Jesus in John chapter 6. Jesus was not guilty by association with these 70 preachers who left him nor would Judas Iscariot who left Jesus if Judas is Garrett was the son of perdition and was so incredibly evil then what title could be given to Jim Jones who is even more evil it seems this accusation against brother Branham is nearly all presumption on the part of brother Brown's accusers this attack of being Guilty By Association on brother Branham is the equivalent to saying that Jesus is responsible for the Catholic Crusades we know the Catholic Crusades killed millions of people during the Dark Ages in the name of Jesus the fact is the Catholic Crusades were not led by Jesus's Spirit the Catholics were not listening to Jesus the Same is true with Jim Jones Jim Jones did not listen to the preaching of brother Branham and as you'll see later even Jim Jones's own words prove he was an enemy of brother Branham Jim Jones was not trying to follow the bible-based teachings of brother Branham in the least bit next let's look at the brother random quote about Jim Jones and a little bit more on their Association so I want to first play the quote from other Branham where he names Jim Jones it's from 1956 October 2nd in Chicago Illinois around said he's happy to see brother James Jones and it was a privilege to speak to him and their people and brother Adam expected to live in eternity with them in glory now friends it's my belief that at this point perhaps Jim Jones was an honest person no one knows for sure but this is brother Brandon being a gracious person just like Jesus was gracious to Judas even on the night of Jesus's arrest he called Judas a friend yet Jesus knew he was the son of perdition and Christ knew Judas would betray him now we don't know brother random knew that Jim Jones would turn out to be the person he was but it doesn't matter because brother Brandon warned Jim Jones and brother Ram lived a holy ghost-filled life whereas Jim Jones lived a demon-possessed life let's listen to the quote thank you happy to see today is our host Pastor brother James Jones from Indianapolis back there for having the brother from Spindale also brother Winston hair from California I'll be just as looking on seeing brother Scotland here with black from from up in Canada where we just had the great meeting up there and many other friends that sitting around it certainly is a privilege today to speak to such a host of people who are am expecting to live an eternity with in glory and have the privilege today to be standing to speak to you and fellowship with you around the word of God it certainly is a privilege to do this now friends Brothers accusers mock brother Branham and say why didn't brother Branham discern Jim Jones that he would fall away well the fact is we don't know maybe brother Branham did I believe in the sermon brother brand did discern Jim Jones as we'll see soon but the fact is God doesn't always tell us and help us discern who's going to fall away and who's not for example why didn't Paul discern Demas falling away in Colossians 4 verse 14. Colossians 4 14 says Luke the Beloved Physician and Demas greet you so Paul says that Demus sent a greeting to the Colossians why didn't Paul discern this greeting and say Demas is going to fall away he's going to leave me and go to the present world well the reason is because God doesn't tell us always who's going to fall away we can only know what God tells us and each one of us as Believers have been associated with people that we thought were Believers but eventually they fell away so it's ridiculous to criticize brother Brown for not Discerning Jim Jones because there's no one that can discern every single person except the Lord Jesus and we can only discern when God gives us the ability to discern the truth is Jim Jones heard the prophet of God brother Branham and rejected his teachings next in part three let's look at brother randoms eight or nine warnings to Jim Jones in this sermon from October 2nd 1956. friends to me this is amazing to see how God called out Jim Jones he's eight or nine times and then all this Oracle proof proves that Jim Jones did not accept brother Ram's message and taught the exact opposite and Jim Jones became an evil man a demon-possessed man a mass murderer whereas brother Brandon stayed true to the word of God and brother Brown was a genuine Holy Ghost filled prophet and notice as we listen to These Warnings from Brother Branham these quotes from Brother Branham proved brother Brown did not know Jim Jones well at all for example brother Ann rebukes women for having bobbed hair and yet all the pictures of Jim Jones and his followers all have women with Bob Terror and they have women in pants in the pictures with Jim Jones and women in bikinis and all kinds of filthy attire so the more you study the history of Jim Jones the more you realize he rejected the bible-based message of brother Branham the first warning is brother Brown said weak pastors let people get away with sin and that's exactly what Jim Jones was a weak Pastor who let his people get away with sin and Jim Jones of course indulged the most in sin among all of his people and his followers let's listen to the quote [Applause] we're not garrisoned against those things the whole church in one big United Army that would have ceased a long time ago time ago we've got it now which is so different they just do anything they won't do liberation of women they wear these little dirty looking throw her clothes and go out on the street and let me say something right here second warning is brother random gave a direct warning to the pastors about the congregation dressing holy and the guilt on women who dressed Unholy for causing men to lust after them let's listen to the warning adultery with her already in his heart does anybody know that uh and if you dress yourself you at the Judgment for you being guilty of committing adultery with that man when he answers for it where is it it was you was the one done it you presented yourself that way so you are the guilty one and you no matter how it's virgin and pure you've lived he'll be guilty before God of committing adultery with a sinner just as soon as you went through the ACT Jesus said so that's not skilled milk brother that's the truth that's what God's word is the customers and I don't know where your parents will appreciate that or not but I'm telling you my sister at the Judgment for her all they have to answer for it and if I don't say these things I don't care how many people say to liberation of women that's a doctrine of the devil and it's not in this Bible that's right right in the third warning brother Brown warns the pastor that the pastor should teach real history and Bible truths to the people and Jim Jones failed to do this let's listen to the quote you see what happens [Music] to acting like the world you know history or your pastor should teach it to you and you see in every age what happens to that cross and you see exactly where it is right now in the Pentecostal church so it's time to go online and make it together and it preach the truth the fourth warning to Jim Joe warning to the pastors shame on the pastors if they don't preach about makeup of course Jim Jones rejected this teaching let's listen to the quote a new man you ready the same way you shouldn't do that [Applause] same older pastors that fail to stand out in their Church the fifth warning was brother Brandon warning the pastor again and brother Ram Compares a weak compromising Pastor to ahab's false prophets who told him to go up to rameth Gilead to his death friends this is a shocking warning that God gave to brother Brenham for Jim Jones because Jim Jones influenced over 900 people to go down to South America to their deaths so again notice this fifth warning brother random said ahab's false prophets led to ahab's death this was a genuine warning from the spirit of God warning the people that Jim Jones would lead the people to their death let's listen to the quote foreign [Music] [Applause] he's with you the sixth warning is again a warning to a pastor to stay with the word and warn the people not to stay with your pastor if he's wrong so in the sixth warning Jim Jones was warned and also his congregation was warned but yet we know many of the congregation continue to follow Jim Jones sadly let's listen to the quote a piece of the weakness of the Christian church sure the words against it I don't care what the pastor says the word Santa let's say on the word 400 was giving one consent the seventh warning is again to pastors but the Rams said we shouldn't care if the word of God hurts the pastor just preach the word let's listen to the quote there is such an evangelism a preaching of it we must tell the truth I don't care [Applause] the eighth warning is again to pastors warning them about being carnal minded pastors and worrying about millions of dollars and of course Jim Jones was both he was a carnal-minded pastor and he had millions of dollars let's listen to the warning [Applause] Earth and everything and decorate his own or any worship God a true picture of a cruel church member today and a glory minded Pastor who was the Church of the cloud and the rest of the city and we'll see some of course them million dollar pipe organ God don't care that for that right don't have a thing you build all those 50 places like that and cram your people until they're just about to pull up Harpers and everything else along you're supposed to put in the church and thousands of healing and buried disgrace to Christianity the ninth and final warning is that brother Branham rebuked denominations and we know around 1960 just four years after this Jim Jones joined another denomination the Disciples of Christ so Jim Jones was United to the domination and not to Christ these are undeniable facts friends it was the Holy Ghost warning Jim Jones and his congregation through the prophet brother Branham and they failed to take heed to These Warnings let's listen to the quote there notice but what we got off is on our theology oh my you know Dr so and so he's such a classic man oh do you know he speaks in two or three different languages oh man it's the most beautiful I read a piece of paper a day about that long where it said that a certain Bishop of a certain Church played the prettiest prayer to their certain denomination that was ever prayed a tree page is a denomination that's right that's about a half a piece of paper all right he played it to the denomination of pretty prayer oh yes we're getting afraid so pretty do things so pretty and look so pretty sure we'll get this like the rest of them and respect yourself in closing this is the end of part one so by God's grace I hope this is a help and Lord willing in part two look at historical facts about Jim Jones from 1955 all the way up to his death in 1978 and then we'll end in the fifth section about a summary contrasting brother Brenham and Jim Jones of course the difference between the two men is night and day Jim Jones is night Darkness demon possession wickedness the most filthy life a person could live contrasted with the truth and the light that brother Brandon preached from the Holy Spirit and brother Brennan was a genuine Holy Ghost filled prophet of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart foreign
