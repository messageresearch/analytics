[0:09] greetings friends and the Mattress name
[0:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ this is part 1
[0:15] in a series that examines the seven
[0:17] false teachings of the Jeffersonville
[0:19] Tape church movement the purpose of this
[0:23] first video is to prove by the Bible and
[0:26] William branham's own words that not
[0:28] every word William Branham said was thus
[0:32] saith the Lord in fact no prophet born
[0:35] with a sin nature spoke every word with
[0:38] us saith the Lord I want to again state
[0:41] that I believe William Branham was a
[0:42] genuine prophet of God I've been
[0:45] studying his message for almost 20 years
[0:48] and preaching it as it is rightly
[0:51] divided through the Word of God as he
[0:53] taught us to do to begin with leadership
[0:56] at the Branham Tabernacle said and I
[0:59] quote I believe everything brother
[1:01] Branham says is thus saith the Lord
[1:03] I believe everything the Prophet says
[1:05] that it is the truth of God to me and
[1:08] you whether we want to accept it or not
[1:11] end quote I humbly believe it is wrong
[1:15] and is the sin of idolatry to say every
[1:18] word the late William Branham said was
[1:20] thus saith the Lord because this false
[1:23] doctrine makes brother Branham
[1:24] infallible or divined since every word
[1:28] of the Lord is infallible essentially
[1:31] their false teaching makes William
[1:33] Branham equal with God as the tape
[1:36] church movement is making brother
[1:37] Branham the head of the church instead
[1:40] of Christ but Jesus Christ has always
[1:42] been is and always will be the head of
[1:45] the Bride of Christ according to
[1:47] Ephesians 1:22
[1:49] 523 and Colossians 1:18 the truth is
[1:54] that not every word William Branham said
[1:57] was thus saith the Lord only Jesus
[2:00] Christ was and is infallible William
[2:03] Branham was not infallible and plainly
[2:06] stated this in 1963
[2:15] william branham made specific statements
[2:18] declaring some of his words were not
[2:20] from the Lord in 1958 by faith Moses
[2:24] brother Branham said in regards to his
[2:26] 1977 prediction it was not the Lord
[2:29] saying it which means it was not thus
[2:32] saith the Lord and that I predict now
[2:36] this is not the large saying this the
[2:38] other about the woman in his is the Lord
[2:40] but I predicted in nineteen and and
[2:42] thirty 33 that the world would be total
[2:47] annihilation before 77
[2:52] William Branham also said it was a very
[2:54] awful thing and tommyrot to make him
[2:58] infallible they claimed in here that
[3:00] some brother an up there that doesnõt
[3:02] sent them up there and they're preaching
[3:04] that man should leave their wives and
[3:06] hunt for their spiritual mate and at the
[3:09] that I am perfectly infallible that
[3:13] there's nothing and all some of the
[3:15] office things you've ever heard and if
[3:16] this church knows that we don't stand
[3:19] for no such tommyrot is that
[3:22] scripture plainly teaches all men born
[3:26] with a sin nature like Moses Elijah
[3:28] Peter and William random utters sinful
[3:31] words at multiple points during their
[3:34] lives proving not every word William
[3:37] Branham said could have been thus saith
[3:38] the Lord because the Lord does not utter
[3:41] deceit here are some examples Abraham
[3:45] and Isaac both lied about not being
[3:47] married to their respective wives their
[3:50] lies were not thus saith the Lord Elijah
[3:54] said he was the only one left in Israel
[3:56] who did not bow the knee to bail but God
[3:59] said there were seven thousand more who
[4:01] did not bow these words of Elijah were
[4:04] not thus saith the Lord Peter promised
[4:07] to never leave Christ but he did after
[4:10] Jesus's arrest even denying him three
[4:13] times so that promise and his denial
[4:15] were not thus saith the Lord this is
[4:19] clearly taught in Romans 3 9 to 14
[4:21] because it says all are under sin
[4:24] there's none righteous no not one
[4:27] there's none that understandeth none
[4:29] that seeketh after God they are all gone
[4:32] out of the way there is none that doeth
[4:34] good no not one their throat is an open
[4:38] Sepulchre with their tongues they have
[4:41] used deceit the poison of ASPs is under
[4:44] their lips whose mouth is full of
[4:46] cursing and bitterness friends brother
[4:50] Branham used deceit Romans 3:13 with his
[4:54] tongue when he had his wife lied to the
[4:56] IRS so he would not have to talk to them
[4:59] but later he repented his deceitful
[5:02] words were not thus saith the Lord
[5:04] because the Lord cannot lie
[5:08] obviously there were times God spoke
[5:11] through his prophets like Elijah
[5:12] everyone knew God was speaking because
[5:14] Elijah spoke in the name of the Lord
[5:17] first King 17:1 and Elijah the Tishbite
[5:21] said unto hey hab as the Lord God of
[5:24] Israel liveth before whom I stand there
[5:27] shall not be do nor rain these years but
[5:30] according to my word brother Branham
[5:33] told the people when to know when God
[5:35] was speaking when asked if brother
[5:37] Branham was prophesying about Martin
[5:39] Luther King jr. he said no because when
[5:42] God speaks he says it's not me it's thus
[5:45] saith the Lord did you prophesy that
[5:49] there be a million Negroes killed on the
[5:55] or did you just announce that there
[5:58] would be at this happening now see I've
[6:03] always asked you to be careful what
[6:06] you're listening to think there's so
[6:09] much of it that it's just the human side
[6:11] but always if there is something that
[6:15] goes forth it will speak it it's thus
[6:18] saith the law even to visions or
[6:21] anything no I just was talking about
[6:26] Martin Luther King on this great
[6:30] disaster that they're having in the
[6:32] south with the colored people
[6:35] it's inspired of the wrong thing you see
[6:39] see they then people and that's reason I
[6:42] say that not that there is any any
[6:46] prophecy concerning and I have nothing
[6:48] on it from the Lord and B is sure now if
[6:50] I say anything from the Lord
[6:52] like that to tell you it's always I'm
[6:54] speaking now but when he speaks I say
[6:57] it's not me it's thus saith the Lord and
[7:00] I can't say it until he tells me I could
[7:02] be altogether wrong am i thought about
[7:04] Martin Luther King I don't know I can't
[7:07] say if that's just my opinion
[7:11] how did followers of William Branham get
[7:13] to the false conclusion that every word
[7:16] he said was thus saith the Lord I
[7:18] believe they got to this idolatrous
[7:20] conclusion because they misinterpret two
[7:23] statements from brother Branham the
[7:25] first I'll call the so say I in the name
[7:29] of Jesus Christ quote listen to this
[7:32] before I explain the errors of the tape
[7:34] church movement this was speaking to
[7:39] Israel and repent afin de cated by God
[7:42] by a pillar of foreign no he was proven
[7:44] to be God's servant to lead them out and
[7:48] before they went in to the land before
[7:51] they enter Moses said now the words that
[7:54] I have spoken to you if you had one
[8:02] thing to it or take one word from it
[8:05] you'll not stay in the land for the Lord
[8:08] God gives you so say I in the name of
[8:12] Jesus Christ don't you add one thing
[8:15] don't take put your own ideas you just
[8:18] say what is said on those tapes you just
[8:22] do exactly what the Lord God has
[8:24] commanded to do don't add to it he has
[8:27] error beeps his promise to us every
[8:30] promise that he has made
[8:35] first this authoritative statement is
[8:38] spoken in the name of Jesus Christ but
[8:41] it doesn't mean what Branham tabernacle
[8:43] is trying to make it say that we can
[8:44] only say what brother branham's tapes
[8:47] say that's a form of idolatry exalting
[8:50] brother Branham equal to God or Christ
[8:53] second brother Branham is repeating what
[8:55] Moses said as a charge to Israel in
[8:58] Deuteronomy chapter 4 verses 1 to 4 and
[9:00] verses 25 and 26 the charge was not to
[9:04] add or diminish God's Word that Moses
[9:08] commanded them not every word Moses said
[9:11] Moses was right God's people should
[9:14] never add or take away from God's
[9:16] commands according to proverbs 30 verse
[9:18] 5 and 6 in revelation 22 verses 18 and
[9:22] 19
[9:23] when understood correctly the so say I
[9:26] in the name of Jesus Christ quote means
[9:29] we do all the Bible based commands
[9:31] brother Branham gave us that originated
[9:34] from the Bible and we don't add to the
[9:36] Bible's commands this is the same thing
[9:39] Moses said and Deuteronomy chapter 4
[9:41] this statement cannot mean Christians
[9:44] should only say the exact words recorded
[9:47] on the audiotapes of brother Branham
[9:49] brother Branham was trying to say what
[9:51] Moses said in charging the people to
[9:53] obey God's Word Moses didn't mean for
[9:56] Israel to only say his every single word
[9:59] uttered from his mouth he only meant for
[10:02] Israel to keep all the commands of God
[10:05] another evidence is that the pastor of
[10:07] Branham tabernacle during William
[10:09] branham's life Worman devil did not play
[10:12] tapes of brother Branham nor did he only
[10:15] quote brother Branham while preaching in
[10:17] fact one month after the so say I quote
[10:20] brother Branham preached his final
[10:22] sermon at the Branham Tabernacle on
[10:24] August 29th 1965 it was an evening
[10:28] service and his sermon title was Satan's
[10:30] Eden in this sermon brother Adam told us
[10:33] how he was led of the Lord to listen to
[10:35] brother Neville preach earlier that
[10:37] morning this morning I wanted your
[10:40] brother Neville myself and I heard you
[10:42] many times and never heard he made a lot
[10:44] of preciate he but this morning that
[10:46] I'm Lea message I know I had the leading
[10:49] of the Lord to listen to that this
[10:50] morning very fun and I see why you
[10:53] people like to come and listen to him
[10:55] also and he'll always do you good I'm
[10:59] sure to listen to him listen that mighty
[11:02] message this morning on our brother
[11:04] Neville brought us about I thought if a
[11:06] soul a wonderful high said their doctor
[11:10] will diagnose the case but the man that
[11:11] comes with a pen full of needles he
[11:13] gives the injection John thought that
[11:15] was really a real cute little expression
[11:18] and I thought about that the serum after
[11:20] the case is diagnosed and no that's a
[11:22] very good thing we learn these truths
[11:26] William Branham never forced any pastor
[11:28] to play only his tapes and not preach
[11:31] himself William Branham always wanted
[11:34] the living pastor to preach from his
[11:36] spiritual preaching gift and not play
[11:38] tapes William Branham always supported
[11:41] the preachers in the fivefold ministry
[11:43] preaching for themselves how fitting
[11:47] that the very last sermon brother
[11:49] Branham preached at the Branham
[11:50] Tabernacle was after submitting to the
[11:53] fivefold ministry by letting the pastor
[11:56] preached before the Prophet this also
[11:58] shows how the Prophet is not above the
[12:00] pastor in the local church setting
[12:22] that's up to you see if he want to
[12:26] preach a he wanted to that's between you
[12:29] and him returning now to Moses it's
[12:33] undeniable not every word Moses said was
[12:37] thus saith the Lord brother Branham knew
[12:39] this and said that prophets are not
[12:41] infallible people in 1957
[12:48] not easy move
[12:54] Nathan the Prophet said David Duval's in
[12:56] your heart cause God's with you the
[12:59] Prophet made a mistake not willing Nate
[13:01] that night the Lord comes the Prophet
[13:03] said go tell my servant Haven numbers
[13:07] chapter 20 verses 7 to 13 is a clear
[13:10] example in which God tells Moses to
[13:12] speak to the rock to give water to
[13:14] Israel but instead he calls Israel
[13:16] rebels which God never told him to say
[13:19] and smites the rock twice to give Israel
[13:22] water which God never told him to do
[13:25] Moses sanctified or glorified himself
[13:28] according to God's own words Moses
[13:30] publicly disobeyed thus saith the Lord
[13:33] and God punished Moses by not allowing
[13:35] him to take Israel into the Promised
[13:38] Land according to numbers 20 verse 12
[13:41] Moses like all prophets including
[13:45] William Branham were allowed to have
[13:46] their own opinions within their freemore
[13:49] agency this means prophets sinned make
[13:53] mistakes and do not always speak things
[13:55] that please God but God forgives them
[13:58] upon their repentance just as he freely
[14:00] forgives you and I but prophets are
[14:04] required to be infallible when they say
[14:06] thus saith the Lord or in the name of
[14:09] the Lord according to Deuteronomy 18
[14:11] verses 20 through 22 and James 5:10 we
[14:15] believe Moses Elijah and William Branham
[14:19] and of course other prophets were
[14:21] infallible when they spoke in the name
[14:23] of the Lord
[14:26] mix-ups on the tapes since prophets are
[14:30] not always infallible I want to show how
[14:32] william branham himself said there are
[14:34] mix-ups on his tape recorded sermons
[14:37] which proves not every word recorded on
[14:40] tape was thus saith the lord like
[14:43] leadership at the Branham tabernacle
[14:45] erroneously teaches God doesn't have
[14:48] mix-ups
[14:49] according to brother Branham himself in
[14:51] 1956 subject
[14:54] [Music]
[15:08] [Music]
[15:12] in 1964 brother random said he mixed up
[15:15] something on the tape so he told the
[15:17] people to look in the Bible for the
[15:18] truth which is a valuable lesson because
[15:21] the Bible is infallible this also proves
[15:24] the Bible was William branham's absolute
[15:26] and not his own audio tapes about like
[15:31] another day I got something least up I
[15:33] have to hear yes I called it right there
[15:35] and so on the tape now I probably hear
[15:37] from it when I was talking about the
[15:39] seven trumpets I said what seven
[15:41] trumpets I was referring to the
[15:42] Pentecostal feast was a great teaching
[15:44] there I didn't touch the age of it but
[15:46] if you have to catch out on your tape
[15:47] remember look in the Bible you see it's
[15:49] seven months
[15:51] adlet count off seven months Jerry for
[15:53] every March April
[15:54] does God mix things up and get things
[15:57] wrong no so every word of brother
[16:00] Branham cannot be thus sayeth the Lord
[16:03] along with so say I in the name of Jesus
[16:07] Christ quote a second quote Branham
[16:09] Tabernacle misinterprets is one alcohol
[16:12] I am God's voice to you which says I'm
[16:17] just your brother by the grace of God
[16:19] but when the age of the Lord moves down
[16:22] it becomes then a voice of God to you
[16:27] maybe
[16:28] if I've offended you by saying that
[16:30] forgive me but I felt that might been
[16:34] invented but I am God's voice to you see
[16:38] I say that again that time was under
[16:41] inspiration faith and I felt bad about
[16:44] the first time that is repeated it down
[16:46] see I can say nothing in myself but he
[16:50] shows me I said
[16:53] the first point is that this statement
[16:55] is true anyone who receives God's Word
[16:58] from an angel undoubtedly becomes the
[17:00] messenger of God's voice just like the
[17:02] word angel means messenger both moses
[17:05] and paul were guided by angels during
[17:07] their ministries according to exodus
[17:09] 20:3 20 and acts 20:7 23 but followers
[17:13] of william branham who exalt his every
[17:15] word 2 thus saith the lord failed to
[17:18] read on when William Branham says I can
[17:20] say nothing in myself
[17:21] this means William branham's regular
[17:24] words including his opinions hopes and
[17:27] desires can be fallible and are not
[17:29] always thus saith the Lord brother
[17:32] Branham knew God used his voice at times
[17:34] to speak his will but not always William
[17:37] Branham said the following I'm not the
[17:50] one that performs these things and
[17:51] foretells these things that happens is
[17:53] perfectly our I'm only one this year
[17:56] when he does it I was only a voice that
[18:00] he used to say it
[18:02] it wasn't what I knew that's what I just
[18:05] treated myself to that he spoke through
[18:08] me another Bible example is God using
[18:13] Elijah's voice to prophesy drought in
[18:15] Israel as the voice of God but there
[18:18] were times Elijah spoke his own opinions
[18:20] that were not thus saith the Lord
[18:22] Elijah's misunderstanding then about
[18:25] being the only believer left who had not
[18:27] bowed their knee wasn't part of his
[18:28] message from God the same is true for
[18:31] brother Branham not every word brother
[18:33] Branham spoke was part of his message
[18:35] from God brother branham's message was
[18:40] the word or Bible truths we are to obey
[18:42] today
[18:57] note also that brother men have never
[18:59] limited himself as being the only voice
[19:01] of God while it's true brother Adam's
[19:04] voice meaning his commands from God was
[19:07] the one prophetic church age messenger
[19:09] voice to this final Laodicean age
[19:11] brother Adam never declared God only
[19:14] spoke through him
[19:15] in fact william branham believed both
[19:17] the bride and every believer who God
[19:20] inspires to speak for him is God's voice
[19:22] to the years chapter 9 in the church age
[19:26] book shows many important quotes about
[19:29] how the voice of God is also in the
[19:31] bride of Jesus Christ the church is no
[19:34] longer the mouthpiece of God he God will
[19:37] confound her false church system through
[19:41] the prophet and the bride for the voice
[19:43] of God will be in her Oh God still has a
[19:48] voice for the people of the world even
[19:51] as he has given a voice to the bride
[19:53] that voice is in the bride as we have
[19:56] said the spirit and the prophet and the
[20:01] bride will be saying the same thing and
[20:04] what they say will have already been
[20:06] said in the word this quote is very
[20:10] important because future videos will
[20:12] show Lord willing how the tape church
[20:15] movement is breaking God's Word most
[20:17] notably in the area of the fivefold
[20:19] ministry of Ephesians 4 verses 8 to 16
[20:23] the tape church movement seeks to take
[20:26] away the preaching ministry of God's
[20:28] five preaching gifts and replaces their
[20:30] preaching with tape playing which is a
[20:33] gross error and is never said in the
[20:36] Word of God the word or Bible never says
[20:39] preachers are to stop preaching and only
[20:41] play tapes so the tape church movement
[20:44] is not saying what is in the word listen
[20:48] now brother Branham says the average
[20:49] Christian becomes God's voice at times
[21:04] never believer in tonight possessed some
[21:12] percentile completely give it over to
[21:14] his words become like the words of prize
[21:17] and to think that if you get into that
[21:21] contact with God it becomes - it isn't
[21:24] you were boys anymore it's not true
[21:27] thought anymore it becomes God's thought
[21:30] in God's voice you are just the band or
[21:36] just a bridge he's the burner
[21:40] concerning the two quotes from william
[21:42] branham the so say i in the name of
[21:44] Jesus Christ and the I am God's voice to
[21:47] you
[21:47] followers of brother Branham must take
[21:49] all his statements back to the Bible
[21:51] proving all things just like Paul and
[21:54] brother Branham believed here is the
[21:59] time that everything that that has got
[22:01] to be proven to be right or wrong don't
[22:04] survive what they prove all things the
[22:06] whole face then we must prove all things
[22:13] by the scriptures not what if it's
[22:17] contrary to my faith and yet the
[22:19] scripture says though the scriptures
[22:21] right and I'm long see the scripture is
[22:24] always right and only way you can do
[22:26] anything is come back to the scripture
[22:29] the remember is the election is the only
[22:33] time that'll catch it what do you say
[22:37] how do you know what you're not right
[22:38] then catch me by the word contest your
[22:42] denomination by this word that's even if
[22:44] I prove all things the Bible
[22:47] don't stop getting the tapes just stay
[22:50] with it
[22:51] search it by the word and see if it's
[22:52] right the Bible said prove all things I
[22:55] know it's done poppers so with Jesus so
[22:57] as the message always when you do that
[23:01] you find brother Branham means only
[23:03] God's commands from the Bible that God
[23:06] gave to him to Christians those commands
[23:09] should not be added to nor taken away
[23:12] from sixteen examples of not every word
[23:16] William Branham said was thus saith the
[23:19] Lord if you would like please contact me
[23:22] and I can make a separate video
[23:24] explaining these 16 examples that prove
[23:27] not every word brother Branham said was
[23:30] thus saith the Lord a few examples
[23:33] include how brother Branham used deceit
[23:36] Romans 3:13 with his tongue when he had
[23:40] his wife lied to the IRS so he would not
[23:43] have to talk to them but later he
[23:45] repented brother branham's lied to the
[24:02] IRS cannot be thus saith the Lord
[24:05] because God does not lie nor does he
[24:07] cause men to lie also brother branham's
[24:11] prediction about 1977 was not thus saith
[24:14] the Lord and of course he told us that
[24:17] it was a prediction and it was not from
[24:20] the Lord brother Branham predicted Total
[24:22] Annihilation meaning the United States
[24:25] would be wiped out with just stumps of
[24:27] trees left and of course this did not
[24:29] come to pass and then there will come a
[24:32] total annihilation the entire nation
[24:35] will be wiped out and that I predict now
[24:38] this is not the large thing that's the
[24:40] other about the woman in his is the Lord
[24:42] but I predicted in 19 and 30 33 that the
[24:48] world would be total annihilation before
[24:51] 77 so I didn't know then that they had
[24:54] something that could annihilate it
[24:56] they got now that I've seen the nation
[24:58] and Total Annihilation just stump some
[25:02] trees and things like that so it's on
[25:05] its Road
[25:07] again let me say plainly that I believe
[25:09] brother Branham was a genuine prophet
[25:11] who spoke with thus sayeth the Lord at
[25:13] times and I have videos about that on my
[25:16] youtube channel supporting his prophetic
[25:19] ministry but he was also a man and all
[25:22] men and women are fallible my objective
[25:26] for sharing these 16 examples is to
[25:29] expose the error of saying every word
[25:31] brother Branham said was thus saith the
[25:33] Lord
[25:34] in doing this I am doing what brother
[25:36] Branham specifically told his listeners
[25:39] to do when I quoted first Thessalonians
[25:41] 5:21 which says prove all things brother
[25:45] Branham said we must prove all things by
[25:47] the scripture we must prove all things
[25:52] by the scriptures he also said test me
[25:57] by the word we are to prove all things
[26:05] said by prophets and preachers not some
[26:09] things by the Bible every genuine
[26:12] prophet and believer for that matter has
[26:14] the same desire brother Branham had to
[26:17] be proven right by the Bible
[26:18] just as the brans proved all of st.
[26:21] Paul's words by Scripture acts 17:11
[26:24] caused the Bereans more noble than
[26:26] others because they receive the Word of
[26:28] God with all readiness of mind and
[26:30] searched the Scriptures daily whether
[26:32] those things were so in closing I hope
[26:38] these truths help prove to you that not
[26:40] every word William Branham said was thus
[26:42] saith the Lord and yet he is a genuine
[26:45] prophet of God some have wondered how do
[26:47] we know which words of a prophet like
[26:49] brother Branham are thus saith the Lord
[26:51] the answer is simple and twofold
[26:55] first brother Adam will say thus saith
[26:57] the Lord or in the name of the Lord
[27:00] second the Holy Ghost will direct you to
[27:03] the word that brother Branham is
[27:05] referencing and then the spirit guides
[27:07] you into all truth the gift of God
[27:10] inside you the seal or baptism of the
[27:13] Holy Ghost guide you into all truth of
[27:16] the word of God that's what the Holy
[27:18] Ghost was given for
[27:20] please contact me if you have any
[27:21] questions concerns or testimonies about
[27:23] this video god bless you and may Jesus
[27:27] Christ be the desire of your heart
