[0:02] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:08] this video is to do a book review on
[0:11] Brother Kyle Morton's book it's from
[0:13] 2021 called some thoughts about balance
[0:18] in the message
[0:20] here's a screenshot of the book
[0:24] I've never met Brother Kyle but he and I
[0:26] have exchanged voice messages on our
[0:29] phones and another sister in the message
[0:32] got me in touch with his ministry which
[0:34] I'm very grateful she did
[0:36] as soon as I started listening to
[0:38] brother Kyle's videos I could tell he
[0:41] had a genuine love for the Lord Jesus
[0:43] Christ and Brother Kyle did not ask me
[0:45] to do this book review this is something
[0:47] I just wanted to do because I've been so
[0:49] blessed by both reading and listening to
[0:52] his book as I've read and listened to
[0:54] his book I have loved his dedication to
[0:57] the scripture and comparing the quotes
[0:59] of brother Branham to the scripture as
[1:01] brother bran taught us to prove All
[1:03] Things by the Bible
[1:05] there's numerous times in his book when
[1:07] he gives his motive an objective
[1:09] one example is on page 18. Brother Kyle
[1:12] said to Simply encourage Believers to
[1:14] live a Godly Balanced Life in Christ
[1:17] Jesus
[1:18] this is a wonderful Godly motive and so
[1:22] I appreciate brother Kyle's desire to
[1:23] help Christians live more balanced
[1:26] before getting into each chapter or
[1:29] movement as Brother Kyle calls them
[1:32] I want to say I've Loved brother Kyle's
[1:34] dedication to scripture his sense of
[1:36] humor
[1:37] his desire to grow his faith
[1:40] his transparency and desire to help
[1:44] others grow in their faith
[1:46] and obviously as with any book you or I
[1:49] might read I personally didn't agree
[1:51] with everything in brother Kyle's book
[1:53] and I say that kindly and humbly because
[1:56] I know he'll probably watch this video
[1:58] and a couple examples are with using
[2:00] Bible translations personally I would
[2:03] only use a King James Version
[2:05] secondly I myself would probably be more
[2:09] harsh
[2:09] on the Tate Church movement because I do
[2:12] believe they're into deep heresy as they
[2:15] exalt every word of brother Branham to
[2:17] thus saith the Lord and also even
[2:19] preachers that say there's no mistakes
[2:21] in the message or the prophet never made
[2:24] any mistakes I believe those types of
[2:26] statements are heretical and it's
[2:28] possible Brother Kyle believes that too
[2:30] I don't know and there's a few other
[2:32] topics where I might have a different
[2:34] opinion on but most of the content in
[2:37] the book I agree with I can say a hearty
[2:39] Amen to and I loved his motive and
[2:42] objective to get people more balanced in
[2:45] the scriptures one more thing before I
[2:47] get started in each movement or chapter
[2:50] I would summarize brother Kyle's book as
[2:53] strong meat to the believer and of
[2:56] course that's out of Hebrews chapter 5.
[2:58] verses 12-14 for the time ye ought to be
[3:02] teachers you have need that one teach
[3:03] you again which be the first principles
[3:05] of the Oracles of God
[3:07] and are becomes such as have need a milk
[3:10] and not of strong meat for everyone that
[3:13] uses milk is unskillful in the word of
[3:15] righteousness for he's a babe but
[3:18] strongly belonged to them that are of
[3:20] full age even those who by reason of use
[3:22] have their senses exercise to discern
[3:25] both good and evil I believe that's what
[3:28] Brother Kyle has done in his book
[3:29] Brother Kyle has addressed many many
[3:32] subjects related to the message of the
[3:35] hour and he's bringing more balance to
[3:37] them which is a mature thing to do
[3:40] he's trying to discern between Good and
[3:43] Evil on all these subjects surrounding
[3:45] the message and that's a Godly thing to
[3:48] do that's a mature thing to do
[3:50] it's immature of a lot of message
[3:52] Believers to ignore these topics but
[3:54] Brother Kyle has showed his maturity
[3:56] wanting to grow in Grace and knowledge
[3:58] of the Lord wanting to prove all things
[4:00] that's a sign of being a mature believer
[4:03] and again according to the writer of the
[4:06] book of Hebrews which we believe was
[4:07] Saint Paul it is mature Christians
[4:10] Christians who feed on the meat of God's
[4:12] word who want to discern good and evil
[4:15] in their daily lives
[4:16] so now begin highlights by movement
[4:19] or chapter
[4:21] the first section is the introduction
[4:24] and Brother Kyle does a wonderful job
[4:26] introducing his book and I want to play
[4:28] one quote from Brother Branham that Kyle
[4:29] uses it's the Golden Days quote where
[4:33] brother Brown talks about he and his
[4:35] friends disagreeing on the scripture but
[4:37] they go about it in a fun way they go
[4:39] about it in a respectful way
[4:41] let's listen to the quote
[4:43] I can remember coming across the desert
[4:45] the other day I told my wife back there
[4:47] I said here's where brother Jack said in
[4:49] the back of this little Chevrolet
[4:50] brother Brown he had argued all about
[4:53] the the original creation well that was
[4:57] done in six days or what was it in six
[4:59] million years that was a good one
[5:01] they get so hard again they get out and
[5:03] get a handful of rocks and want to get
[5:05] behind one hold one another and throw
[5:06] rocks at one another just sorry
[5:09] they couldn't sell it that way say I can
[5:11] outrun you down the road they go to
[5:13] brother Jack a little short fella just
[5:15] the hardest he can twist and brother
[5:16] young with them long leggings
[5:20] I don't rely so much in my life man
[5:22] brother Jack got back in the car and
[5:23] pulled off his shoes brother shared to
[5:25] give us a big sack of orange isn't he
[5:27] had cleaned him up before he got the
[5:28] streets
[5:31] you know all those golden days old
[5:34] yesterday are golden days I know it
[5:36] sounds jokey funny but it's the truth
[5:38] but we there's something about that as
[5:41] you get older then begins to linger on
[5:44] your mind you think of those days that
[5:46] you wish you could live again
[5:48] it's right our younger days as we get
[5:51] old they all become pictures I'm so glad
[5:54] it was pure and holy brotherly a
[5:57] fellowship and love knowing that we're
[6:00] going to a land where we'll never get
[6:02] old or that great land under or we'll
[6:05] never never grow old or never die
[6:09] the fat Brother Kyle uses this quote
[6:11] from Brother Branham shows his sincere
[6:13] desire that he just wants to have honest
[6:15] humble conversations about these
[6:18] subjects that surround the message of
[6:20] the hour he doesn't want to offend
[6:21] anybody he doesn't want to hurt
[6:23] anybody's feelings but he knows it's
[6:25] important to talk about subjects and not
[6:27] to ignore them and truly it's the desire
[6:29] of every Christian
[6:31] who's really filled with the Holy Ghost
[6:32] to be guided into all truth according to
[6:35] John 16 verse 13.
[6:38] moving on into movement one or chapter
[6:40] one I'll just hit a few highlights that
[6:43] I really enjoyed this movement is called
[6:45] long run for a short jump
[6:47] Brother Kyle gives disclaimers about why
[6:50] he's writing the book and as Christians
[6:52] we should remain teachable I like how
[6:54] Brother Kyle defined message terminology
[6:57] that's very helpful and he admits his
[6:59] book doesn't have perfect grammar I
[7:01] thought that was a humble Godly thing to
[7:03] do and then he goes through seven nut
[7:05] shells or seven themes that are
[7:08] important to discuss the second one in
[7:10] particular
[7:11] I enjoyed brother Branham wanted to
[7:14] accomplish one thing from the church age
[7:16] book
[7:17] and that was to produce a true
[7:18] relationship between God and man let's
[7:21] listen to the quote
[7:22] not for one moment do I bring a message
[7:24] to the people that they may follow me or
[7:27] join my church or start some fellowship
[7:29] and organization
[7:31] I have never done that and will not do
[7:33] that now I have no interest in those
[7:35] things
[7:36] but I do have an interest in the things
[7:38] of God and people
[7:39] and if I can accomplish just one thing I
[7:42] will be satisfied
[7:43] that one thing is to see established a
[7:46] true spiritual relationship between God
[7:48] and men for in man become New Creations
[7:51] in Christ filled with his spirit and
[7:54] live according to his word
[7:56] I would invite plead and warn all to
[7:59] hear his voice at this time and yield
[8:01] your lives completely to him even as I
[8:04] trust in my heart that I have given my
[8:06] all to him
[8:08] God bless you and may his coming Rejoice
[8:11] your heart
[8:13] then Brother Kyle says he's trying to
[8:15] stay in the middle of two extremes and
[8:17] of course these are the same extremes
[8:19] I'm trying to stay in the middle between
[8:21] one extreme is the Tate Church movement
[8:24] which worships brother Brands tapes
[8:26] to me that's a heretical movement The
[8:29] Other Extreme is people that leave the
[8:30] message and deny the message is true
[8:33] this is the group I call the accusers of
[8:35] brother Branham because Satan is the
[8:37] accuser of the Brethren this is the
[8:39] group that gets distracted and they
[8:41] focus on brother Branham too much rather
[8:43] than focusing on the message God sent to
[8:46] brother Branham and I think I would add
[8:48] in here it's even important to say again
[8:50] that there's lots of preachers that lean
[8:52] towards the side of the tape Church
[8:55] movement and say everything on the tapes
[8:57] is thus say the Lord prophets don't make
[9:00] mistakes and these preachers are
[9:01] completely unbalanced so again I love
[9:04] our brother Kyle's desire to stay in the
[9:06] middle of the road just as brother
[9:08] random said
[9:09] in movement number two or chapter two
[9:11] it's called the Plumb line and Brother
[9:13] Kyle gives balance on a lot of
[9:16] significant topics such as the absolute
[9:19] showing how brother Brandon grew in his
[9:21] understanding of the white horse rider
[9:23] he showed brother Brandon was human and
[9:25] made mistakes
[9:26] he wrote about a cherry pits section
[9:29] which proves brother Branham taught us
[9:31] to be careful how we listened to his
[9:33] tapes and not everything brother Branham
[9:35] said was thus said the Lord there's a
[9:37] great section on rightly dividing
[9:39] there's a great quote on how we follow
[9:41] Jesus's bloody Footprints as brother
[9:44] Brandon said
[9:45] there's a great section on Rebecca
[9:47] loving Isaac more than Ellie easer and
[9:50] John the Baptist was not Jesus
[9:53] showing brother Branham was not Jesus
[9:55] Brother Kyle then defined the message
[9:59] then he showed the sermon books of
[10:00] brother Branham are not Jesus Christ but
[10:03] they point us to Jesus Christ
[10:05] and then Brother Kyle gave an awesome
[10:07] section on the token simplified
[10:10] and this section meant a lot to me
[10:13] because my first sermon as Pastor in
[10:16] 2006 was literally called majoring on
[10:20] the token and this may be my favorite
[10:22] portion of the entire book because it
[10:24] emphasizes the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:27] then there's a section on we should not
[10:29] be lazy biblically a section on the
[10:32] balance of brother Brandon's statement
[10:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[10:35] sensation
[10:37] a section balancing the bleeding word
[10:39] quote
[10:40] a section that balances say what the
[10:43] tapes say
[10:44] and then Brother Kyle made a humble
[10:45] statement are we trying to win arguments
[10:47] or help someone along the way and that
[10:50] was on page 102.
[10:53] moving on to Movement 3 or chapter three
[10:56] it's called Dangerous topics and this
[10:58] section deals with the accusations
[11:01] from believe the sign and similar
[11:03] websites
[11:04] who attacked brother Branham Brother
[11:07] Kyle encourages questions because the
[11:09] elect cannot be deceived which I thought
[11:10] was a tremendous point
[11:12] we're not afraid of questions because we
[11:14] have the truth
[11:16] and Brother Kyle gives simple Common
[11:18] Sense answers on topics like the brown
[11:20] bear the bridge prophecy
[11:22] the man from Windsor the Arizona cloud
[11:26] the supposed plagiarism of the Seven
[11:28] Seals misogyny accusations and others
[11:31] and Brother Kyle even says it's okay to
[11:34] say I don't know if you and I don't know
[11:36] answers but we know the Holy Ghost will
[11:38] guide us into all truth and eventually
[11:40] he'll give us the right answers
[11:42] movement 4 or chapter four is called the
[11:45] kitchen sink
[11:46] this chapter gives answers on many
[11:48] random topics such as wisdom for
[11:51] ministers balancing the quote about
[11:53] staying with your pastor
[11:55] because we don't want to worship the
[11:57] pastor we don't want to exalt the pastor
[11:59] above Jesus
[12:01] Brother Kyle encourages us to be unified
[12:04] on scripture then he shows how brother
[12:07] Branham was open to correction
[12:09] and Brother Kyle dealt with the
[12:11] fallacies where people say there's no
[12:13] truth outside the message or all
[12:15] education is of the devil or
[12:18] missionaries are always in the will of
[12:19] God he gives a great balance on
[12:21] Revelation chapter 10. more balance on
[12:25] the quote brother Branham said I'm God's
[12:27] voice to you he showed how the Seven
[12:30] Seals were revealed to brother Branham
[12:32] but also in the Seven Seals series we
[12:34] see brother Ram's humanity and times God
[12:37] had to correct him I love when Brother
[12:39] Kyle uses Philippians 2 and says let the
[12:42] mind that was Christ be in you and
[12:44] Brother Kyle correctly emphasized how
[12:47] Philippians 2 is speaking of the Mind of
[12:49] a servant so Brother Kyle is saying let
[12:51] the mind of a servant be in you that's
[12:54] what we need more preaching about how we
[12:56] can be better servants
[12:58] there's a great section called screen
[13:00] time section that emphasizes Godly
[13:03] Family Life a health section on taking
[13:06] care of your body and encouragement to
[13:08] take care of our physical bodies as well
[13:10] as our spirits and of course make sure
[13:12] our souls are baptized with the Holy
[13:14] Ghost
[13:15] in movement 5 or chapter 5 the title is
[13:18] a few attempts to land
[13:20] Brother Kyle encourages Godly mentorship
[13:23] and he gives a touching tribute to his
[13:25] father-in-law he reminds us Jesus is the
[13:28] principal theme of Our Lives
[13:30] and how we're supposed to have a Mystic
[13:32] walk with god with everything filtered
[13:35] through the Bible that's such an
[13:37] important statement I really enjoyed
[13:38] that section
[13:40] he shows how salvation is Jesus alone
[13:42] then Kyle says why he is staying with
[13:46] the message on pages 206 and 207.
[13:49] Brother Kyle gives a few more
[13:51] disclaimers
[13:52] trying to help the reader understand
[13:55] that he is not a heretic but he's a
[13:58] humble follower of Jesus Christ and
[14:00] doing what brother random said rightly
[14:02] dividing the word of Truth proving All
[14:05] Things by the scripture
[14:07] being careful how we listen to brother
[14:08] Branham as he told us and he cares do
[14:11] you care in 1963 Brother Kyle said he
[14:14] was calling us to stay in our churches
[14:15] as long as our churches were healthy
[14:17] churches
[14:19] I like the section called what is the
[14:20] next step and he says the next step is
[14:22] the same as the first step follow him or
[14:25] follow Jesus Christ the word
[14:28] there's a great section called for the
[14:30] children's sake what will we do with all
[14:32] the miners
[14:33] in other words all the minor topics that
[14:36] surround the message and quotes from
[14:37] Brother Branham he said we've got to
[14:39] decide what did this Fellowship on but
[14:42] of course he encourages having
[14:43] Fellowship as much as possible with the
[14:46] love of Jesus Christ
[14:48] there's another great section on without
[14:50] current revelation
[14:52] he said without that revelation we live
[14:54] in a glare which is what brother random
[14:56] warned us about we can't live in the
[14:58] glare of Brothers Ministry we've got to
[15:01] walk in the light we've got to have a
[15:03] personal experience with Jesus Christ
[15:04] ourselves
[15:06] this statement by Brother Kyle reminded
[15:08] me of a church age Book quote where
[15:10] brother Brandon said God doesn't give a
[15:12] different Revelation than he originally
[15:14] did but he gives us more information
[15:16] about the same Revelation I believe that
[15:19] to be true
[15:20] I believe God is doing that now he's not
[15:22] giving us different Revelations than
[15:24] brother Branham he's giving us more
[15:26] information about the same Revelations
[15:28] and then Brother Kyle used a good quote
[15:30] about the final climax being the rapture
[15:34] and yet brother Branham isn't here so
[15:37] God called brother Branham off the scene
[15:39] before the final climax
[15:41] in other words the final great event of
[15:44] the Gentile Church ages Is Yet To Come
[15:46] and yet brother Brandon's not here but
[15:48] we've got the same Revelation that
[15:50] brother Branham had by the grace of our
[15:52] Lord Jesus Christ so I'd like to play
[15:54] that quote now
[16:11] in the ending section of brother Kyle's
[16:13] book I love how he quoted Colossians
[16:15] chapter 1 verse 27 the main emphasis of
[16:19] this book is being born again being
[16:21] baptized with the Holy Ghost Christ in
[16:23] you the hope of glory and that I think
[16:25] it's very fitting the last quote Brother
[16:27] Kyle uses in the entire book is the
[16:30] quote from Brother Branham where he went
[16:32] beyond the curtain of time and the
[16:34] millions screamed out were resting on
[16:36] that brother random's followers are
[16:38] resting on the fact that brother Branham
[16:40] preached what Paul preached
[16:43] which is the holy word of God the
[16:45] revelation of Jesus Christ
[16:47] let's listen to the quote from Brother
[16:48] Branham
[16:51] and then that Vision the Lord me some
[16:53] time ago when those and millions when at
[16:56] one speaking to me said uh you'll be
[16:59] judged first for the gospel you preached
[17:01] I said I preached the same thing Paul is
[17:03] and the rest of them and all those
[17:05] millions of voices screamed out we are
[17:07] resting on that today that was it right
[17:13] in closing friends I hope this book
[17:16] review has been a blessing friends you
[17:18] can listen to this book for free on
[17:20] Kyle's YouTube channel and there's other
[17:22] ways to listen to it as well different
[17:24] websites he uses again brother Kyle did
[17:26] not ask me to do this book review I felt
[17:29] led to the Lord to do it because I loved
[17:31] his purpose behind writing his book
[17:33] there's so many reasons to read this
[17:36] book that I thought I would share it
[17:37] with my viewers one great reason is to
[17:40] draw closer to God
[17:42] you redeem your time by spending your
[17:44] time thinking about the things of God
[17:46] the Bible says draw an eye to God and He
[17:49] will draw an eye to you another reason
[17:50] is to grow in Grace and knowledge of our
[17:52] Lord Jesus Christ I was going to say it
[17:54] earlier but I'll say it now there were
[17:56] so many quotes in this book that I was
[17:59] reminded of that I had forgotten about
[18:00] and they're so helpful in finding
[18:03] balance on certain topics and also I
[18:05] discovered numerous quotes I never heard
[18:08] before so I'm very thankful to Brother
[18:10] Kyle for writing this book all the time
[18:12] that he invested into it it's a great
[18:14] blessing to have this book because it
[18:16] points us to Jesus Christ if you want to
[18:18] contact Brother Kyle he said please
[18:20] email me if you have a question I would
[18:22] do my best to help or at least to listen
[18:24] Kyle morton7 gmail.com
[18:28] and now friends we'll bring it close to
[18:30] the video if you have any questions
[18:32] concerns or testimonies about this video
[18:34] please contact me by email
[18:38] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[18:40] the desire of your heart
