[0:07] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:11] this video is to teach God's desire for
[0:13] all Christians to have a home church as
[0:16] part of the body of Jesus Christ the
[0:19] Bible teaches that all cushions should
[0:21] do the following faithfully attend a
[0:24] home church with increasing attendance
[0:25] Hebrews 10 21 to 27 revelation to 19 and
[0:30] 26 Luke 4 verses 14 to 17 worship on
[0:36] Sunday and other days acts 20 verse 7
[0:39] Hebrews 10:25 have a pastor Ephesians
[0:44] 4:11 and Matthew 9:36 grow from all five
[0:49] preaching gifts
[0:50] Ephesians 4:11 through sixteen have a
[0:54] church family
[0:55] Titus 1:5 Romans 16 3 through 5
[0:59] Colossians 4:15 Hebrews 10:24 2:25 John
[1:04] 13:35 and acts 2:42 to 46 and
[1:09] financially support your home church
[1:11] with tithes and offerings
[1:14] the command to faithfully tend a home
[1:17] church with increasing attendance church
[1:21] attendance is not optional for true
[1:23] Christians as Hebrews chapter 10
[1:25] commands Christians to faithfully
[1:27] assemble together and more often as the
[1:30] second coming of Jesus Christ approaches
[1:32] and let us consider one another to
[1:34] provoke unto love and to good works not
[1:37] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:39] together as the manner of some is but
[1:42] exhorting one another and so much the
[1:44] more as you see the Day approaching
[1:47] gathering together is both an essential
[1:50] act commanded and a selfless act as
[1:53] scripture says gathering is considering
[1:55] one another
[1:56] considering means to understand to
[1:59] consider attentively fix one's eyes or
[2:02] mind upon we consider our Christian
[2:05] family to provoke or inspire them to
[2:07] love God and do good works that glorify
[2:10] Christ this is done through prayer
[2:12] singing sharing revelations and Bible
[2:15] knowledge foretelling future events
[2:17] sharing Bible doctrine and more first
[2:21] corinthians 14:6 now brethren if i come
[2:24] unto you speaking with tongues what
[2:26] shall i profit you except i shall speak
[2:28] to you either by revelation or by
[2:30] knowledge or by prophesy or by doctrine
[2:34] hebrews 10:25 also says christians must
[2:38] exhort or comfort or pray for each other
[2:41] to miss church is to selfishly forsake
[2:44] nor abandon other christians forsaking
[2:47] church services exposes an evil selfish
[2:50] rebellious and wandering spirit a person
[2:53] who leaves a home church signifies they
[2:56] are not part of the family of God
[2:58] according to first John 2:19 and a
[3:01] person who separates themselves from the
[3:03] true church shows they do not have the
[3:05] Holy Spirit according to Jude 1:19 they
[3:09] went out from us but they were not of us
[3:11] for if they had been of us they would no
[3:13] doubt have continued with us but they
[3:16] went out that they might be made
[3:17] manifest that they were not all of us
[3:20] these be they who separate themselves
[3:23] sensual not having the spirit as
[3:28] Christian you should not Church hop but
[3:30] rather find your position or post of
[3:33] duty where God wants to use you like
[3:35] Abraham your post of duty will be a
[3:37] place where you are blessed and where
[3:39] you will bless others Genesis 12:2 and I
[3:43] will make of thee a great nation and I
[3:45] will bless thee and make thy name great
[3:47] and thou shalt be a blessing those
[3:51] without a home church are acting like
[3:52] Cain the wanderer or vagabond Jude
[3:56] called those like Cain filthy unstable
[3:59] ones and wandering stars real Christians
[4:02] are not unstable movable tossed to and
[4:06] fro like a wave in the sea like Cain was
[4:08] Cain's wanderer condition repeats today
[4:11] when people reject regular church
[4:13] attendance and the fivefold preaching
[4:16] ministry detailed in ephesians 4 11
[4:18] through 14 ephesians 4:14 that we
[4:23] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[4:25] and fro and carried about with every
[4:27] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[4:29] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[4:32] in wait to deceive God's desire is for
[4:36] you to be a pillar in your local church
[4:37] because part of God's eternal reward for
[4:40] faithful Saints is to be made pillars in
[4:43] God's heavenly temple revelation 3:12 he
[4:47] that overcometh will i make a pillar in
[4:49] the temple of my god and he shall go no
[4:51] more out our church attendance must
[4:55] increase according to Hebrews 10:25 and
[4:58] so much the more as you see the Day
[5:00] approaching the more you invest into
[5:03] church the more benefit you will get out
[5:05] additionally Jesus taught in a letter to
[5:08] Thyatira that increasing service which
[5:11] would include church attendance and good
[5:13] works is the secret to Christianity and
[5:16] overcoming Satan revelation 2 19 and 26
[5:20] I know thy works and charity and service
[5:23] and faith and my patience and thy works
[5:26] and the last to be more than the first
[5:29] and he they overcometh and keepeth my
[5:32] works unto the end to him will I give
[5:34] power over the nation's through
[5:38] increased church attendance Christians
[5:40] constantly increase
[5:41] and godliness growing from glory to
[5:43] glory from faith to faith as the Book of
[5:46] Proverbs says there light shining
[5:48] brighter unto a perfect day
[5:52] Jesus's example most churchgoers may be
[5:55] surprised to know that Jesus Christ
[5:57] modeled faithful church attendance in
[5:59] Luke chapter 4 and Jesus returned in the
[6:02] power of the spirit into Galilee and
[6:04] there went on a fame of him through all
[6:07] the region round about and he taught in
[6:09] their synagogues being glorified of all
[6:11] and he came to Nazareth where he had
[6:14] been brought up and as his custom was he
[6:16] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[6:19] day and stood up for to read Jesus's
[6:23] customer habit was to faithfully attend
[6:25] the synagogue immediately after being
[6:27] freshly filled with the Holy Ghost like
[6:30] Christ a Holy Ghost field person today
[6:32] will be led by the Holy Spirit to
[6:34] faithfully attend church since Jesus
[6:37] faithfully attended church you should
[6:39] follow in his footsteps as a follower or
[6:41] imitator of God along with faithful
[6:45] church attendance Jesus had a zeal for
[6:47] God's house causing him to drive out the
[6:50] money changers at both the beginning and
[6:52] ending of his earthly ministry John - 14
[6:55] and 15 and Luke 19 verses 45 to 46 all
[7:00] true Christians will have a zealous
[7:01] desire to worship Jesus in purity
[7:04] keeping the feast in sincerity and truth
[7:07] 1st Corinthians 5:8 let us keep the
[7:10] feast not with old leaven neither with
[7:12] the leaven of malice and wickedness but
[7:14] with the unleavened bread of sincerity
[7:16] and truth
[7:20] [Music]
[7:23] if you have any questions about having a
[7:26] home church please contact us god bless
[7:31] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[7:33] of your heart
