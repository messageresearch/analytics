[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] that's exactly how I broke away from the
[0:06] missionary
[0:07] baptist Dr Roy E Davis how many you ever
[0:09] heard him sure he did you want to Art
[0:12] Ang and women preachers and I said no
[0:13] sir as an elder I said I cannot do that
[0:16] consciously it's against the word of
[0:19] God greetings friends in the matchless
[0:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:24] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:26] viewer's question about brother brandham
[0:27] being baptized by Roy Davis
[0:30] the question says quote could you clear
[0:32] up that internet accusation that William
[0:34] brandham was baptized by the grand
[0:36] wizard of the clan please thank you end
[0:39] quote so by God's grace I'll try to
[0:42] share a little bit about this topic I
[0:43] don't know everything about this topic
[0:45] but I'll share what I know by the grace
[0:47] of the Lord hi friends I'm Jesse Smith
[0:49] pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here
[0:51] in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible
[0:54] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[0:56] to his true Prophet The Late William
[0:57] brandham 1909 to 19 65 and I also defend
[1:01] brother bram's Godly character in this
[1:04] video of course I'm defending brother
[1:05] bram's Godly character uh before we get
[1:08] into the answer here that I gave to this
[1:09] brother let's remember a few things
[1:11] about the character of some of these
[1:13] people that have left the message and of
[1:15] course I don't mean all the people that
[1:17] have left the message but some of the
[1:19] people that have left the message
[1:21] remember a lot of these people that have
[1:22] left the message allow adulteries they
[1:25] allow women to cut their hair and God
[1:27] never asked a Godly woman to cut her
[1:29] hair hair because it's a shame and
[1:31] disgrace to her husband and also to
[1:33] Christ also some of these people that
[1:36] have left the message support non-binary
[1:38] relationships they support tattoos and
[1:40] tattoo parlors they support watching
[1:43] Wicked movies one of the main accusers
[1:45] of brother brandham supports Dracula
[1:48] rock and roll like Bon Joy ACDC and some
[1:52] of these people are lying about
[1:54] plagiarism brother brandham was not a
[1:56] plagiarist probably revisit this topic
[1:58] again soon just to review and let the
[2:00] viewers know there's over 38 differences
[2:03] between brother brandom's interpretation
[2:05] from Jesus on the Seven Seals compared
[2:08] to Clarence Larin Charles T Russell and
[2:10] Uriah Smith it's not even close and yet
[2:13] these accusers of brother brandom will
[2:14] lie right through their teeth and call
[2:17] Brother random a plagiarist of course
[2:18] they're guilty of slander and guilty of
[2:20] lying and that's just a few friends
[2:22] there's many many other presumptions and
[2:24] lies and slanderous accusations against
[2:27] brother brandom who was a man forgiven
[2:29] by his faith in the blood of Jesus
[2:31] Christ as brother random said repeatedly
[2:34] he was trusting in the merits of the
[2:35] blood of Jesus Christ to go to heaven
[2:37] not his own works I'm not sinless I got
[2:41] plenty hanging on me but every hour I
[2:45] confess it constantly when I see my
[2:48] wrong then I turn from that and try to
[2:49] do what's right I wouldn't try to go to
[2:51] heaven on my merits I wouldn't get there
[2:53] I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ he
[2:56] is my trust I I I believe in him I
[3:00] wouldn't try to go in because I'm a
[3:01] Pentecostal brother I I wouldn't go in
[3:04] on the merits of Pentecost I'd go in on
[3:06] the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ
[3:08] he died for me and that's what I want
[3:10] you to trust the merits of him and then
[3:13] how you know you're getting there is
[3:14] when every word is you punctuate with an
[3:16] amen amen because it's a word itself
[3:19] trying to vindicate itself and if we
[3:21] deny that word how can it vindicate
[3:23] itself so shame on these accusers of
[3:25] brother brandham for slandering him
[3:27] lying about him making presumptuous
[3:29] claims about him the Bible actually
[3:31] calls this slandering and reviling and
[3:34] there's awful repercussions for these
[3:36] types of sins so may God have mercy on
[3:39] some of these people so back to the
[3:41] question could you clear up the internet
[3:43] accusation that William Brandon was
[3:44] baptized by the grand wizard of the clan
[3:47] please a few things to note here yes
[3:49] brother Ram did say he was baptized by
[3:51] Roy Davis that's in many places but one
[3:54] is God keeps his word 1957 brother Bram
[3:57] said one of the high Baptist men Dr
[3:59] Davis baptized me into the Baptist
[4:02] Fellowship let's listen to the quote
[4:04] when I went to the the G overseer one of
[4:06] the high Baptist man Franklin the want
[4:08] to baptizing Dr Davis into the Baptist
[4:11] Fellowship I went and told him about he
[4:13] said bny you need a rest you've had a
[4:17] nightmare I said I don't appreciate that
[4:19] I'll resign the Baptist church right now
[4:23] but friends remember brother brand was
[4:24] not with Roy E Davis that long we all
[4:27] remember Roy Davis tried to get brother
[4:28] Bram to support women preacher so
[4:30] brother R left the church so I don't
[4:32] need to play those quotes most people
[4:33] know that but I am going to play this
[4:35] one does God ever change his mind about
[4:37] his word 1965 brother Ram said he broke
[4:40] away from the missionary baptist and Dr
[4:42] Roy E Davis because he wanted to ordain
[4:45] some women
[4:46] preachers that's exactly how I broke
[4:49] away from the missionary
[4:52] baptist Dr Roy E Davis how many you ever
[4:55] heard him sure he did you want to ardain
[4:57] some women preachers and I said no sir
[5:00] as an elder I said I cannot do that
[5:02] consciously it's against the word of God
[5:04] so this was very early in brother Ram's
[5:06] Ministry he broke away from Roy Davis so
[5:09] again we cannot make brother brandham
[5:10] guilty by association with Roy Davis
[5:14] there's no proof absolutely no evidence
[5:16] brother Ram supported any of Roy Davis's
[5:19] sinful lifestyle decisions so we do not
[5:23] make brother random Guilty By
[5:24] Association just like we don't make
[5:26] Jesus Guilty by association with Judas
[5:28] the scarit so friends it's a good sign
[5:30] brother brandom separated himself from
[5:32] Roy Davis it seems like brother brandom
[5:34] did not know all the evil in Roy's life
[5:37] apparently according to the research
[5:39] from the accuser side those that accused
[5:42] brother brandom apparently Roy Davis was
[5:44] a leader in the KKK married three times
[5:46] had multiple arrests imprisonments money
[5:49] laundering and many more accusations now
[5:51] I myself have not done that research so
[5:53] I don't know but one thing's for sure
[5:55] brother random lived a clean life in all
[5:57] honesty and Holiness and there's no
[5:59] marks against him it's clear brother Ram
[6:01] was baptized with the Holy Ghost and he
[6:02] lived a Godly clean holy Christian Life
[6:05] by God's grace it's also important to
[6:07] know that brother Ram never promoted Roy
[6:09] Davis or his teachings after brother Ram
[6:12] left Roy Davis's church now of course
[6:14] there are some stories where brother
[6:16] Brenham said positive things about Roy
[6:18] Davis but no doubt a few good things
[6:21] could have been said about Judas escar
[6:23] as well because he had gifts to heal the
[6:25] sick to cast out Devils to raise the
[6:27] dead and so forth but any honest person
[6:30] would realize if they listen to brother
[6:31] brandom with an honest heart brother
[6:33] brandom did not support Roy Davis's
[6:36] lifestyle it seems brother Ram didn't
[6:38] know about his sinful decisions either
[6:41] so here's kind of what I wrote to the
[6:42] person who asked the comment on YouTube
[6:44] I said from what I've heard on the
[6:46] podcast of brother Ram's accusers Roy
[6:48] Davis was a wicked man and possibly
[6:49] involved in the KKK I've never done this
[6:52] research myself also brother Ram's
[6:54] accusers often exalt their research as
[6:57] infallible and many times they've been
[6:59] wrong WR so I don't trust everything
[7:01] they publish so that's something to keep
[7:03] in mind and friends this subject boils
[7:06] down to this brother random said Roy
[7:08] Davis baptized him and that has nothing
[7:10] to do with brother ROM's own faith or
[7:12] trust in the blood of Jesus Christ for
[7:15] brother brandom's salvation the truth is
[7:18] even if a person who turns out to be a
[7:20] sinner baptized a True Believer it
[7:22] doesn't take away the true believer's
[7:24] trust in Jesus Christ a good example of
[7:26] this is judas's scarit for he baptized
[7:28] Believers according to John
[7:30] 4:2 the Bible says though Jesus himself
[7:33] baptized not but his disciples so Judas
[7:36] baptized Judas was also sent out with
[7:38] all the power to heal the sick raise the
[7:40] dead according to Matthew chapter 10 and
[7:42] no doubt Judas did many signs wonders
[7:44] and miracles because even at the Last
[7:46] Supper when Jesus said one of you will
[7:48] betray me not everyone knew it was Judas
[7:51] they actually looked at themselves first
[7:53] so it's clear Judas had the anointing of
[7:55] the holy spirit in the gifts in his life
[7:57] to do Supernatural wonders Miracles he
[8:00] baptized people he did everything all
[8:02] the other Apostles did but of course he
[8:05] sold out his faith in Christ and went to
[8:07] hell the Bible calls him the son of
[8:09] predition the son of Destruction so this
[8:12] is what I likened to Roy Davis if indeed
[8:15] Roy Davis was the person that brother
[8:17] Ram's accusers are calling him so just
[8:19] because Judas the scarat may have
[8:20] baptized someone didn't mean that new
[8:22] believer lost their salvation Judas the
[8:25] scariot had gifts from God to heal and
[8:28] baptize and more and and it seems like
[8:30] God honored those gifts in judas's life
[8:32] despite Judas falling away and selling
[8:34] out Jesus the Same is true in the Bible
[8:36] we see it with balum and also in Matthew
[8:38] 7
[8:39] 21-23 we'll start with balum he had a
[8:42] gift to prophesy and his star of Jacob
[8:44] Prophecy from The Book of Numbers was
[8:46] 100% correct and the wise men used his
[8:49] prophecy to find baby Jesus but balam
[8:52] went to hell According to second Peter
[8:53] chapter 2 remember Matthew 7:21-23 Jesus
[8:58] said not everyone that says Lord Lord
[9:00] will enter the kingdom of God only those
[9:01] who do the will of My Father which is in
[9:03] heaven Jesus said many will come to me
[9:05] and say did not we prophesy in thy name
[9:08] cast out devils and do many wonderful
[9:10] works and Jesus will say I never knew
[9:12] you depart from me ye that work iniquity
[9:15] so notice Jesus never said these
[9:16] anointed ones didn't do the works didn't
[9:19] do the Miracles or didn't do the casting
[9:20] out Devils Jesus never denied their
[9:22] gifts and their Supernatural experiences
[9:25] he never said their gifts or Works were
[9:27] illegitimate but he said they lived a
[9:29] life of iniquity so this is what I
[9:31] believe applies to brother brandham and
[9:33] Roy Davis Roy Davis if he ended up
[9:35] living a life of iniquity then he would
[9:37] be departing from Jesus at the white
[9:40] Throne judgment but brother randam lived
[9:42] a Godly clean Holy Ghost Christian life
[9:45] and that's undeniable so in summary this
[9:48] is a straw man argument that Roy Davis's
[9:51] baptism of brother brandom somehow
[9:53] disqualifies brother brandom from
[9:54] Ministry or from being a true Prophet
[9:57] again these accusers of brother brandom
[9:59] are trying to get people's attention
[10:00] away from the word of God that brother
[10:02] Brandon preached the over 110 true
[10:05] doctrines he taught that all the
[10:07] denominations get wrong I'll leave a
[10:09] video about that in the description the
[10:12] six thus sayith the Lords that came to
[10:14] pass brother R was a true prophet of God
[10:15] I'll leave a link to that in the
[10:17] description the videos on the Seven
[10:19] Seals and how there's over 38
[10:21] differences between brother Ram's
[10:23] Revelation from Jesus Christ and the
[10:25] teaching of Larin Russell and Uriah
[10:27] Smith I'll leave link L to that playlist
[10:30] in the description friends we got to
[10:32] keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:34] and the word of God that brother
[10:36] brandham brought us and when questions
[10:38] like this come up I'll do my best to
[10:39] answer them by the grace of our Lord and
[10:41] then remember friends look at the people
[10:43] who are making these
[10:44] accusations they're lovers of Pleasures
[10:47] more than lovers of God many of them
[10:49] don't even have a gift to preach the
[10:51] gospel so they're misinterpreting the
[10:52] word of God they're adding false
[10:54] doctrines to their churches they're
[10:56] taking away the true doctrines that
[10:58] brother renam restored by the leading of
[11:01] Jesus Christ so they're guilty of adding
[11:03] to the word and taking away from the
[11:05] word and there are awful repercussions
[11:07] to those actions as well in
[11:11] closing friends I hope this video was a
[11:13] blessing by the grace of God again we
[11:15] got to keep our eyes on the word of God
[11:17] that brother Brandon brought to us and
[11:19] of course all these false accusations
[11:21] these slanderous accusations can all be
[11:23] proven wrong that's what this video was
[11:25] meant to do prove these accusers Wrong
[11:28] by the grace of the Lord so let's have a
[11:29] word of prayer for them and then I'll
[11:31] let you know and then I'll let you know
[11:32] about contacting me by God's grace
[11:35] father God we just thank you for the
[11:36] truth we thank you that the word of God

[11:44] Christ he was trusting in your blood
[11:46] dear Jesus for his salvation and we know
[11:48] we'll see him there in heaven as a true
[11:50] prophet of God we're thankful for that
