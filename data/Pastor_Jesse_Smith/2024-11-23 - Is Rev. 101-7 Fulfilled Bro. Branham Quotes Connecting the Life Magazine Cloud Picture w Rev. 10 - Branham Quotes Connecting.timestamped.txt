[0:03] just as they picked up that light Hunter
[0:06] and put it in Life Magazine of the
[0:08] opening of the seals of the revealing in
[0:12] the age of the seventh angel in the days
[0:15] of his ministry the seventh messenger
[0:18] the mysteries of God which all the
[0:20] Mysteries have been along the ages
[0:22] should be
[0:24] revealed greetings friends in the
[0:26] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:29] are there any quotes from God's Prophet
[0:31] brother brandham that connect the
[0:33] Fulfillment of Revelation
[0:35] 10:7 with the 1963 February 28th Arizona
[0:40] Cloud recently I was asked this question
[0:42] so I found four quotes from God's
[0:45] Prophet brother brandham that connect
[0:47] the fulfilling of Revelation 10:7 to the
[0:50] February 28th cloud and so that's what
[0:51] this video will cover by the grace of
[0:53] God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor
[0:56] bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:58] Ohio USA and I defend the original
[1:00] Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[1:02] revealed to St Paul and then had to
[1:04] restore through Martin Luther John
[1:06] Wesley and the late Prophet brother
[1:07] William Marin Brenham who lived from
[1:09] 1909 to 1965 also defend brother Ram's
[1:12] Godly Christian character so yes friends
[1:15] I found four quotes where brother Bram
[1:16] connects the February 28th 1963 Arizona
[1:20] cloud with the Fulfillment of Revelation
[1:23] 10:7 before that though I want to remind
[1:25] our viewers that I have a video called
[1:27] four reasons I believe the cloud was
[1:30] Supernatural the February 28th 1963
[1:33] Arizona cloud and again brother bill
[1:36] rostran has a video with scientific
[1:38] evidence which I believe and of course
[1:40] many message Believers believe prove the
[1:43] cloud was of Supernatural
[1:45] origin so I would encourage you to watch
[1:48] that if you have any questions about
[1:49] that by the grace of God so let's go
[1:51] through the four quotes from God's
[1:53] Prophet brother brandham linking the
[1:55] cloud with the Fulfillment of Revelation
[1:57] 10:7 and I'll go in chronologically
[2:00] order by the grace of God the first
[2:02] quote is from April 12th 1963 the world
[2:05] is falling apart brother BR said just a
[2:08] few days ago them seven angels come down
[2:11] when the prophecy said go to Tucson and
[2:13] wait there for a while and you'll hear a
[2:15] blast go off and then he said the Seven
[2:17] Seals were opened at the Tabernacle the
[2:19] other day he said Remember the sounding
[2:21] of the seventh angel the mystery of God
[2:24] was finished and there come an angel
[2:25] from heaven and swore with his hands
[2:27] raised from Heaven Revelation 10 1-7
[2:30] that time would be no more exactly right
[2:33] the hour so brother random connects
[2:35] Revelation 10 1-7 being fulfilled with
[2:39] the blast that went off when he was in
[2:41] Tucson so first we'll listen to this
[2:44] quote from Worlds falling apart and then
[2:46] we'll play the prophetic quote from is
[2:49] this the sign of the answer where
[2:50] brother Ram talked about that same blast
[2:53] brother Ram was given the vision to go
[2:55] out west to meet the seven angels and
[2:58] that's when the picture of the cloud
[2:59] appeared appeared brother R actually
[3:01] called this a prophecy in the name of
[3:02] the Lord it was a vision a prophetic
[3:05] Vision that he received in December 1962
[3:07] to go out west meet the seven angels and
[3:10] there he'd be sent back by the spirit of
[3:12] God back to Jeffersonville to preach the
[3:14] revelation of the Seven Seals so let's
[3:17] listen to this quote from the world's
[3:18] falling apart
[3:20] 1963 just a few days ago and them Seven
[3:23] Angels Came Down that Vision many of you
[3:25] KN it said go to Tucson and wait there
[3:26] for a while you'll hear a blast go off
[3:28] when it goes return back in the 7 seals
[3:30] were open at the Tabernacle the other
[3:32] day when I seen people coming from
[3:34] standing there at 3:00 in the morning
[3:35] and get a place to get into the
[3:36] auditorium and so forth sin the hungry
[3:38] Hearts coming from everywhere I thought
[3:40] oh God we're bound to be at the end now
[3:43] remember the sounding of the seventh
[3:45] angel the mysteries of God was finished
[3:46] and there come an angel from heaven and
[3:48] swore with his hands raised from Heaven
[3:49] Revelations 10 1-7 the time would be no
[3:52] more exactly right the hour what church
[3:55] is he coming to the church that we're
[3:57] living in the ladyo seea church age the
[4:00] Church age now friends let's listen to
[4:02] the quote where brother brand prophesied
[4:05] of this blast going off and then the
[4:07] appearance of the cloud seven angels
[4:10] meeting with brother brandham in March
[4:12] 1963 and of course we know brother
[4:14] brandham wasn't physically under the
[4:17] cloud on February 28th 1963 the earliest
[4:21] he could have been there was sometime
[4:23] early in March of 1963 but we know he
[4:26] could have been there by translation
[4:28] just as Ezekiel was translated
[4:30] by the Holy Spirit he was translated by
[4:32] Vision so either brother R was
[4:34] translated on February 28th or the cloud
[4:36] reappeared to brother brandham in early
[4:39] March 1963 but let's listen to the quote
[4:42] from is this the sign of the answerer
[4:43] brother Bram talks about the blast going
[4:45] off and a snow white pyramid a
[4:49] constellation and that's speaking of the
[4:51] supernatural cloud from February 28th
[4:53] 1963 brother brand thought it would be a
[4:56] blast that would kill him of course it
[4:57] didn't mean that and then I'll ahead to
[5:00] a further quote in that same sermon is
[5:03] this a sign of the answer brother Ram
[5:04] said remember I tell you in the name of
[5:06] the Lord I've told you the truth and
[5:08] something is fixing to happen so that
[5:10] was the prophetic statement in the name
[5:12] of the Lord that brother Brandon would
[5:14] experience this blast out in Arizona
[5:17] he'd be met by seven angels that will
[5:20] commission him to go back to
[5:21] Jeffersonville and reveal the Seven
[5:24] Seals which would be the beginning of
[5:26] the Fulfillment of Revelation 10 1:7
[5:28] let's listen to the prophecy from
[5:31] 1962 I could see those angels those
[5:35] shaped back
[5:36] Wings traveling faster than sound could
[5:40] travel they come from eternity in a
[5:43] split like a twinkling of an eye not
[5:46] enough to batch your I just a twinkle
[5:48] they were there I didn't have time to
[5:51] count I didn't have time more than this
[5:53] look mighty ones great powerful angels
[5:57] Snow White Wing setting heads and they
[6:03] were and when it did I was caught up
[6:06] into this pyramid of
[6:10] constellations and I thought now this is
[6:13] it I was numbed all over and I said oh
[6:18] my this means that there will be a blast
[6:21] that will kill me I'm standing in an
[6:24] awful place if you but knew
[6:27] it remember I tell you in the name of
[6:30] the Lord I've told you the
[6:33] truth and something's fixing to
[6:37] happen the second quote where brother
[6:40] brandom connects Revelation 107's
[6:42] fulfillment with the Arizona cloud is
[6:44] from January 12th 1964 it's in the
[6:47] message Shalom this is a lengthy quote
[6:50] but I just want to highlight how brother
[6:52] brandom said the 7th messenger all these
[6:54] Mysteries should be finished the seventh
[6:57] Earthly messenger and then he said after
[6:59] that he saw another angel coming down
[7:01] speaking of Christ with a rainbow over
[7:03] him set his foot on the land and sea
[7:06] brother BR said but before he broke
[7:08] forth on those Seven Seals to reveal
[7:10] them that he showed miraculous he showed
[7:12] it first in the heavens that day they
[7:15] took pictures all across Southern United
[7:17] States of Mexico there it hangs now in
[7:19] Life Magazine so brother Ram connects
[7:22] himself as the seventh Church AG
[7:24] messenger of Revelation 10:7 and then
[7:27] Christ coming down to Commission him to
[7:29] preach the revelation of the Seven Seals
[7:31] as fulfillment of Revelation 10:7 and
[7:34] then a few paragraphs later in paragraph
[7:36] 80 he said the seventh messenger the
[7:38] mystery of God which all the Mysteries
[7:40] has been along the ages should be
[7:41] revealed made manifest it should be at
[7:44] that time he did it his words don't fail
[7:47] so brother R said this is done in the
[7:48] past he did it Revelation 10:7 is
[7:52] fulfilled and then skipping ahead to
[7:54] paragraph 170 he said in the church age
[7:58] the seventh Angel's message would be
[7:59] that last message we find over here in
[8:02] Revelation 10 in the days of the message
[8:05] of the seventh angel the mystery of God
[8:06] should be finished then all at once when
[8:09] it's happening a vision broke go to
[8:11] Tucson a great noise speaking of the
[8:13] great blast brother Ram said all of you
[8:15] know about it it's on tape months before
[8:17] it happened then it happened then
[8:19] appeared in the sky Shalom or God's
[8:22] peace so brother Ram said God is giving
[8:24] us peace that he's fulfilled Revelation
[8:26] 10 1:7 the supernatural cloud from
[8:29] February 28th from Life Magazine was
[8:32] Christ coming down to commission brother
[8:34] brandham to preach the revelation of the
[8:36] Seven Seals let's listen to the
[8:39] quotes but did you notice before the
[8:42] Seven Seals was
[8:45] revealed before the great mysterious
[8:47] light showed forth in the
[8:51] heavens uh up here at above Tucson Flag
[8:55] Staff where we were brother Fred to of
[8:58] the man that was the the two man was
[9:00] with me that morning when that would
[9:01] been told months and months ahead of
[9:03] time would happen both brother Fred
[9:06] sopan and brother Jee Norman sitting
[9:08] here this morning when it was there when
[9:10] the blast went off and not knowing these
[9:13] things would take place and he sent me
[9:15] back said that the time was at hand for
[9:18] these Seven Seals which held the seven
[9:22] Mysteries of the entire Bible was sealed
[9:25] in with these Seven Seals and how these
[9:28] angels down Ong the road Messengers and
[9:31] the church ages open to a certain part
[9:33] of that but in the seventh hour the
[9:37] seventh messenger that all these
[9:40] Mysteries should be
[9:43] finished the seventh Earthly messenger
[9:47] see this angel that he speaks of then
[9:49] was on Earth uh angel means messenger
[9:52] and then after that he saw another angel
[9:55] coming down not the Earthly angel that
[9:57] had been given the message here but the
[10:00] another Mighty angel came from heaven
[10:03] with a rainbow over him and set his foot
[10:06] on the land and sea and swore by him
[10:08] that lives forever and ever time shall
[10:10] be no
[10:12] more but before he broke forth on those
[10:15] Seven Seals to reveal them that he so
[10:18] miraculous he showed it first in the
[10:20] heavens
[10:22] amen that day they took pictures all
[10:25] across Southern United States of Mexico
[10:27] there it hangs down the Life Magazine he
[10:29] still a mystery to them but he declares
[10:32] it in the
[10:34] heavens before he does it on
[10:39] Earth he always does that he shows his
[10:43] signs in the heavens first did any of
[10:46] you see the paper where they tuck the
[10:48] pictures of the
[10:49] Moon I have it here if it ain't a
[10:52] perfect image leaving out the seventh
[10:53] age which is not yet exactly the way I
[10:56] draw by the Holy Spirit
[10:59] the church ages amen there's the six of
[11:03] them the seventh is not finished yet the
[11:07] six conditions of the Moon how in its
[11:10] brightness in the first church age dark
[11:12] inness second third fourth fifth and
[11:16] sixth just the way the holy spirit let
[11:19] me draw them on the board and then
[11:22] identify them with his on the wall of
[11:25] the
[11:26] Tabernacle two years ago
[11:29] the moon reflects itself and science
[11:32] again picks up the picture of the church
[11:36] ages amen amen just as they picked up
[11:39] that light under and put it in Life
[11:42] Magazine of the opening of the seals are
[11:46] the revealing in the age of the seventh
[11:50] angel in the days of his ministry the
[11:53] seventh messenger the mysteries of God
[11:56] which all the Mysteries has been along
[11:58] the ages should be revealed made
[12:01] manifest it should be at that time amen
[12:05] and he did it am his words don't
[12:10] fail isn't that a mysterious
[12:14] thing God drawing in the
[12:17] heavens the same thing that the whole
[12:19] same God let me draw on the Blackboard
[12:23] and then by himself that's three times
[12:25] he's perfectly identified amen and just
[12:28] before the pope goes in uh to Jerusalem
[12:33] we heard the word
[12:34] say that in the days of the seventh
[12:37] angel in the church age had just said
[12:39] the seventh Angel's message would be the
[12:41] last message and then what we find out
[12:44] over here in Revelations 10 in the days
[12:46] of the message of the seventh angel the
[12:49] mysteries of God should be finished the
[12:52] seventh seal would be pulled back amen
[12:56] it should be there and all at once was
[12:59] is happening a vision
[13:00] broke say go to
[13:03] Tucson amen a great noise will take
[13:05] place at this time so you be thoroughly
[13:07] understanding and know that sent it'll
[13:09] just shake the Earth nearly amen all of
[13:12] you know about it it's own tape months
[13:14] before it happened that happened amen
[13:18] that appeared in the skies
[13:22] Shalom what is it it's a changing beats
[13:26] the
[13:27] sympathy the third quote post from
[13:29] marriage and divorce February 21st
[13:32] 1965 brother brandom said Revelation the
[13:35] 10th chapter Jesus Promised it all these
[13:38] hidden mysteries on marriage and divorce
[13:40] would be revealed in the end time and
[13:42] you remember the voice said go to Tucson
[13:44] remember the Mystic light in the sky the
[13:47] seventh angel standing there come back
[13:49] and the opening of The Seven Seals watch
[13:51] what's taking place that is true so
[13:54] again brother Ram connects Revelation
[13:56] 10:7 all the Mysteries to his Vision
[13:59] about going west to Tucson and the light
[14:02] in the sky which would have been the
[14:04] Bright White Snow White Cloud that was
[14:06] pictured in Life Magazine brother Bram
[14:09] said that is true let's listen to the
[14:11] quote now on the marriage and divorce it
[14:13] has to be revealed until it's revealed
[14:17] you don't know it but he promised in
[14:19] this last days in this age that every
[14:22] hidden Mystery in the Bible would be
[14:23] revealed how many know is that
[14:25] Revelations the 10th chapter Jesus
[14:28] Promised it that all all these hidden
[14:32] mysteries on on marriage and divorce all
[14:35] these other Hidden Mysteries has been
[14:37] would be revealed in the end
[14:40] time now you remember the voice said go
[14:43] to Tucson remember the Mystic light in
[14:45] the skies the Seven Angels standing
[14:47] there come back in the opening of The
[14:49] Seven Seals watch what's taking place
[14:52] that is
[14:53] true next friends I'm going to put an
[14:55] additional quote in here again it's
[14:57] lengthy this quote doesn't mention
[14:59] Revelation 10:7 but it does mention the
[15:02] Life Magazine picture and brother Bram
[15:03] said that picture he said it's Christ
[15:06] brother Braham took time to talk about
[15:08] this picture and it is the rising of the
[15:10] Sun April 18th
[15:12] 1965 his Easter message is final Easter
[15:15] message brother Ram connects the opening
[15:17] of The Seven Seals the revelation of
[15:20] marriage and divorce the serpent seed
[15:21] all these different questions brother R
[15:24] links all these Mysteries being revealed
[15:26] to the Life Magazine picture of the
[15:28] class
[15:29] and brother ROM said it's Christ so we
[15:31] see brother random indirectly linking
[15:34] the revelation of the Seven Seals which
[15:37] was his vision about going out west to
[15:39] Tucson the prophecy that he had to go
[15:41] out west to meet the seven angels come
[15:43] back and preach the revelation of the
[15:45] Seven Seals brother linking that
[15:48] experience the mysteries of being
[15:49] finished with the Life Magazine picture
[15:52] let's listen to the
[15:53] quote realizing that our time is limited
[15:57] here especially for those friends who
[16:00] are listening in by this
[16:03] telephone I would like to call your
[16:06] attention this morning to
[16:08] a a picture at some time ago was taken
[16:15] by uh
[16:18] the camera of a vision that I had here
[16:22] at the Tabernacle of leaving Indiana to
[16:26] Arizona where I was to meet in a farm of
[16:29] a pyramid seven
[16:31] angels not knowing what would happen
[16:35] later when I got there thinking it was
[16:37] the end of my life but no one could
[16:39] stand the blast and I'm sure all of you
[16:41] are acquainted with the
[16:43] story and then in Sabia Canyon one
[16:47] morning like this while in prayer there
[16:50] had been a sword placed in my hand and
[16:53] said this is the
[16:55] word and the sword of the word later the
[16:59] Angels appeared as was prophesied and at
[17:03] the same time a great cluster of light
[17:06] left where I was standing and moved 30
[17:10] miles high in the air and around the
[17:13] circle like the wings of the angels and
[17:16] draw into the skies the shape of a
[17:19] pyramid in the same constellation of
[17:22] angels that
[17:24] appeared science took the picture all
[17:26] the way from Mexico as moved from
[17:29] northern Arizona where the holy spirit
[17:32] said I would be standing 40 miles
[17:34] Northeast of Tucson and it went into the
[17:37] air and Life Magazine packed the
[17:40] pictures a Mystic something way in the
[17:42] Spheres where there could be no moisture
[17:45] where there can be no evaporations of
[17:48] anything 30 mil high and 27 miles
[17:52] across and coming right up from where
[17:55] those angels were now they asked to know
[17:59] science the one of them at Tucson wanted
[18:03] to know any significance but I didn't
[18:05] tell them you all knew it told
[18:07] beforehand but it wasn't for them it was
[18:11] for
[18:13] you and so there he spoke to me and said
[18:18] the Seven Seals will be open the seven
[18:21] Mysteries seven F mystery of the Bible
[18:24] that's been closed up since the
[18:26] foundation of the world will be revealed
[18:28] and we yet a humble little group
[18:30] compared with all the world we've
[18:33] enjoyed these Blessings Now hearing
[18:36] those Mysteries marriage divorce serpent
[18:39] seeds all these different questions has
[18:41] been completely uh revealed to us not by
[18:46] man but by God himself let's open those
[18:49] seven mysteries of what the church was
[18:52] how it was in Christ at the beginning
[18:54] and how it would be revealed in the last
[18:56] days and now as this went
[18:59] we have the picture outside on the
[19:02] plaque but then I have the picture link
[19:06] present here if you notice as Life
[19:09] Magazine had it but I wonder if my
[19:15] audience visible here has ever really
[19:18] looked at the picture see see and the
[19:21] way it should be you remember I was
[19:25] preaching when this Vision Came Upon the
[19:28] subject of the book of the revelations
[19:31] were the old judges where we've seen
[19:35] Jesus in Revelations one when we started
[19:37] to open the Seven Seals of the or the
[19:40] church ages
[19:41] rather just prior to the opening of The
[19:44] Seven field Christ was standing with
[19:47] hair like wool white and I described
[19:52] that to you that the old English judges
[19:54] and judges of long ago when they went to
[19:57] the bench to be sworn in their supreme
[20:00] authority was given them they wore a
[20:03] white wig as it was over their heads to
[20:06] show their supreme
[20:09] authority well if you'll turn the
[20:11] picture like this and look you can
[20:13] probably see it from the
[20:14] audience it's Christ see his eyes
[20:18] looking here just as perfect as it could
[20:20] be wearing the white wig of supreme
[20:24] deity and judge of all heavens and earth
[20:28] when you see his eyes nose his mouth
[20:31] just turn the picture from this way they
[20:33] had it this way the way it's supposed to
[20:35] be and can you see
[20:38] it he is supreme judge there's none
[20:42] other but him and that is a perfect
[20:46] identification again a
[20:49] Vindication this message is the
[20:53] truth it is true and making him not a
[20:57] third person but the only
[20:59] person with a white see you see the dark
[21:02] his face his beard his eyes and notice
[21:05] he's looking from him comes this light
[21:08] shining on the right hand side to which
[21:11] he's looking to on the cross that's
[21:14] where he look to the right or he
[21:16] pardoned The
[21:18] Sinner in the light of his resurrection
[21:22] we still go forth in his name
[21:28] I wish this morning that I had just much
[21:32] time to to stand upon these phenomenas
[21:36] that's beyond any Shadow of Doubt been
[21:39] proven for the past 30 years or 35 years
[21:44] right here at this church that's down on
[21:45] the river when that same light came down
[21:48] here in Jeffersonville in
[21:50] 1933 and spoke those words as John the
[21:54] Baptist was sent the for run the first
[21:56] coming of Christ your message will
[21:58] before run the second we're at the end
[22:01] time and we see it we wonder sometimes
[22:04] why it hasn't spread over the Earth
[22:07] maybe sometime we'll have a chance to
[22:10] explain that if God willing now and
[22:13] finally the fourth and last quote is
[22:15] from July 25th 1965 what is the
[22:18] attraction on the mountain brother Ram's
[22:20] talking about Christ he's talking about
[22:22] the Life Magazine picture he said turn
[22:23] the picture to the right there is Jesus
[22:25] as he was in the seventh Church age the
[22:27] white wig gone Alpha and Omega first and
[22:30] last Supreme judge then brother Ram said
[22:33] what's happened upon Mount Sunset God
[22:35] confirming his word it's God fulfilling
[22:37] his promised word again of Revelation 10
[22:40] 1:7 then brother Ram begins talking
[22:42] about the scientists and all through
[22:43] Tucson still writing about the
[22:46] supernatural cloud from February 28th
[22:49] 1963 but talks about the observatories
[22:52] and all those in Tucson still asking
[22:54] what did it where is it at brother
[22:56] Braham said they're just as puzzled of
[22:58] that Supernatural Halo hanging Yonder in
[23:00] the sky as they was when the Magi came
[23:03] in following a star saying where is he
[23:05] that's born King of the Jews what is it
[23:08] God fulfilling his word so that's a
[23:10] pretty amazing statement in comparison
[23:13] of brother brandham he's comparing the
[23:14] picture from Life Magazine with the star
[23:17] of Jacob that the Magi followed to find
[23:19] Christ brother said the god of Heaven
[23:21] promised the evening time would have
[23:23] light three years ago this mystery was a
[23:25] prophecy what time is it sir so again
[23:28] referencing the vision the prophetic
[23:30] Vision he gave from December 30th
[23:33] 1962 he said but now it's history it's
[23:36] pass the promis is fulfilled what time
[23:38] is it sir and what's this attraction God
[23:41] fulfilling his word he's the same
[23:43] yesterday today and forever so again
[23:46] brother random saying Revelation 1 10-7
[23:49] is history it's fulfilled it was a
[23:51] prophecy but now it's fulfilled and it
[23:54] was God vindicating Revelation 10 1- 7's
[23:57] fulfillment
[23:59] supernaturally with a sign in the skies
[24:01] just as when the star of Jacob
[24:04] Vindicated Jesus's birth let's listen to
[24:07] the
[24:08] quote and the other day standing there
[24:10] turned the picture to the right and
[24:12] there's
[24:14] Jesus as he was in the seven Church
[24:17] ages the white wig on showing Supreme
[24:22] deity he's Alpha and Omega he's the
[24:25] first and the last he is the Supreme
[24:29] judge of all eternity standing there to
[24:31] confirm the message of this hour and
[24:35] there shall be light about the evening
[24:38] time what's it all
[24:41] about what was
[24:43] it what's happened up on Mount Sunset
[24:47] God confirming his word that's what all
[24:50] this noise is
[24:52] about notice it's God fulfilling his
[24:57] promised word again of Revelations 10
[25:00] 1:7 and in the days of the sounding of
[25:03] the seventh Angel's message the mystery
[25:06] of God should be finished the hidden
[25:08] Mystery of
[25:09] Revelations 10 1-7 the last message to
[25:13] the last Church age fulfills exactly in
[25:17] this
[25:17] age St Luke 17:30 the day when the son
[25:22] of man shall be revealed and there shall
[25:24] rise false prophets and false Christ
[25:28] show great signs and wonders in so much
[25:30] to De see the elected if possible the
[25:33] people still in doubt and as usual the
[25:35] church is just as puzzled and the
[25:38] science all through Tucson yet they're
[25:40] writing PE pieces and putting the paper
[25:42] way back over there on Mount Limon them
[25:44] big cameras didn't see it rising up from
[25:47] where we were standing drifting on
[25:49] towards the West showing the time is
[25:51] over it can't go with a little peace
[25:52] there it's at the West Coast judgment
[25:54] struck just the very way it
[25:56] went going right up over Phoenix right
[25:58] on across onto Prescott across the
[26:01] mountains to the West Coast right on up
[26:03] into where was they going right on up
[26:06] into Alaska and she's thundering heading
[26:10] right that way and the observatories and
[26:12] all of them in Tucson are still asking
[26:14] research of science trying to find out
[26:16] what it is so high there can't be fog
[26:18] mist or nothing up there what did it
[26:21] where's it at they're just as puzzled at
[26:24] that Supernatural Halo hanging there in
[26:27] the sky as it was when the Magi come in
[26:29] following a star saying where is he
[26:32] that's born King of the Jews what was it
[26:35] God fulfilling his
[26:37] word there shall rise a star out of
[26:40] Jacob and the god of Heaven promised the
[26:43] evening time would have evening lights
[26:46] three years ago this mystery was a
[26:48] prophecy what time is it sir but now
[26:52] it's
[26:54] history it's past the promise is
[26:57] fulfilled
