[0:03] He come up on the basis of the shed
[0:05] blood knowing that God required a blood
[0:08] sacrifice and blood was what Job offered
[0:13] knowing that God could not refuse it.
[0:16] The whole picture is a perfect
[0:18] revelation.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:22] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:25] this video is to do a character study on
[0:27] the life of Job in order to show how Job
[0:30] was perfect in God's sight in heaven by
[0:33] the blood sacrifice. Yet Job was
[0:36] imperfect on earth or vile as he calls
[0:39] it in Job 40:4
[0:42] showing the glory of God's complete
[0:45] total forgiveness in heaven despite the
[0:48] battle with our flesh and our sin nature
[0:51] here on earth. this pest house as God's
[0:54] prophet brother Ram tells us. As a
[0:57] recent video showed, Job was being
[0:58] tested or proven to the devil that Job's
[1:02] love for God was genuine and not based
[1:04] upon God's benefits to Job. Brother Ram
[1:07] said this test was for the perfecting of
[1:10] Job's spirit. Look at Job, a perfect
[1:14] man, a just man. And God permitted the
[1:17] evil devil to come upon him and chastise
[1:20] him and everything else for the
[1:22] perfecting of his spirit. See, so evil
[1:25] spirits has God uses evil spirits many
[1:29] times to work out his plan and his will.
[1:33] I'm hopeful that this video will correct
[1:35] any misunderstandings that some spread
[1:38] about Job by claiming that Job never
[1:41] sinned on earth. People misunderstand
[1:43] that because God calls him perfect in
[1:45] Job chapters 1 and two, but then they
[1:47] fail to read on the rest of the
[1:49] scriptural witnesses especially from
[1:52] Elahu and then God himself and Job
[1:55] himself. And hopefully this video then
[1:57] will show the balance in the word of God
[1:59] regarding Job's entire testimony. The
[2:02] ultimate goal is that this video would
[2:03] continue to encourage us to be patient
[2:05] with God as we relate to Job's life
[2:09] because James 5:11 says Job's testimony
[2:12] was to teach us patience.
[2:15] And when we consider what Job went
[2:17] through, really think about the trials
[2:19] he faced, it does make us more patient.
[2:22] Remember, Job suffered for months, not
[2:25] days, but months. According to Job 29:2,
[2:29] Job lost all of his children. In Job 1,
[2:32] Job lost all of his wealth. In Job 1,
[2:37] Job lost his good health. In chapter 2,
[2:41] scripture also says he lost sleep. Job
[2:44] 7:es 3 and 4 said he had weariesome
[2:47] nights. He was full of tossings to and
[2:50] fro unto the dawning of the day.
[2:54] Even in Job 7:13-14,
[2:56] he had nightmares as well. He said,
[2:59] "Thou scarest me with dreams and
[3:00] terrifies me through visions." Now, it
[3:02] wasn't God doing that. God doesn't tempt
[3:04] anyone, but God allowed the devil to do
[3:06] that. So, even when he did sleep, he had
[3:09] horrible dreams. His pain intensified at
[3:12] night time according to Job 30:17.
[3:15] My bones are pierced in me in the night
[3:16] season and my sinnus take no rest.
[3:20] Now because of this lack of sleep and
[3:22] pain during the night time, he also
[3:24] longed for death. Job 3:es 3 and 4 say,
[3:29] "Let the day perish wherein I was born
[3:31] and night in which it was said, there's
[3:33] a manchild conceived, let that day be
[3:36] darkness." Job 3:11 said, "Why died I
[3:39] not from the womb? Why did I not give up
[3:42] the ghost when I came out of the belly?"
[3:45] Job 3:20-22
[3:47] says, "Which long for death, but it
[3:49] cometh not." So Job is suffering not
[3:52] just during the day, but the entire
[3:54] night. So we recognize most people do
[3:57] not suffer on Job's level. Some people
[4:00] experience a degree of Job's suffering.
[4:03] For example, they might experience bad
[4:05] health or they might lose children. They
[4:07] might lose their finances. But it's rare
[4:09] to find someone who suffered on all
[4:11] these levels like Job did. But we
[4:13] remember this book was written for our
[4:15] admonition, for our patience, our
[4:17] learning, so that when we suffer, we can
[4:20] learn to trust the Lord that the Lord
[4:21] gives and the Lord takes away. But
[4:24] blessed be the name of the Lord. So in
[4:26] this first section, let's look at the
[4:28] list of Job's holy habits and
[4:30] attributes. In other words, his godly
[4:32] character.
[4:33] Job 1:5 said he had frequent prayers and
[4:37] blood sacrifices for his children, and
[4:40] he rose up early in the morning. Again,
[4:42] encouragement for us to get up early,
[4:43] pray and seek God. This is what made God
[4:47] called Job perfect in heaven. It was the
[4:49] blood sacrifice just as the blood
[4:52] sacrifice of Jesus Christ in the New
[4:55] Testament makes us perfect. I want to
[4:57] play two quotes from God's prophet,
[4:58] brother Brandham, where he recognizes
[5:00] this that the blood sacrifice is what
[5:02] made Job perfect. The first is from
[5:04] fellowship through the reconciliation of
[5:07] the blood. 1955,
[5:09] brother Ram said, "Job came on the basis
[5:12] of the shed blood to God. He knew that
[5:15] God could not refuse it." Brother Ram
[5:17] calls this a perfect revelation. And oh,
[5:20] how that inspires us. The blood of Jesus
[5:22] Christ should be a perfect revelation to
[5:24] us, knowing that God cannot refuse the
[5:27] blood of Jesus Christ. Let's listen to
[5:29] the quote.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Job knew he had not sinned because he
[5:33] come upon the basis of God's word. He
[5:37] come up on the basis of the shed blood
[5:40] knowing that God required a blood
[5:42] sacrifice and blood was what Job offered
[5:46] knowing that God could not refuse it.
[5:50] The whole picture is a perfect
[5:52] revelation.
[5:55] Next in the basis for fellowship 1961,
[5:58] brother Brandham said Job knew he was
[6:00] righteous because he wasn't trusting in
[6:02] his own merits. He'd met God's
[6:04] requirement for the blood sacrifice.
[6:07] Then brother Ram encourages us to do
[6:08] that. Just keep holding out. Stand on
[6:11] the blood of Jesus Christ. It's the only
[6:14] place for fellowship with God is the
[6:15] blood of Jesus Christ. Let's listen to
[6:17] the quote.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; When they come down as comforters, the
[6:21] church members come down and accused
[6:23] him. He know that he was righteous
[6:26] because he wasn't trusting in his own
[6:28] merits. But he had met God's requirement
[6:31] because he'd stood on the blood
[6:33] sacrifice. Yes, sir. He know that he was
[6:36] righteous because he was meeting God's
[6:38] requirements. And then you notice if
[6:41] you'll just keep holding out, stand on
[6:44] the blood, don't take nothing else.
[6:46] Belong to your denomination, that's all
[6:48] right. Have education, that's fine.
[6:51] Science, that's all right. But first,
[6:53] place yourself on the blood.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; That's the only place of fellowship.
[6:59] So the blood sacrifices Job made to God
[7:03] made him morally and ethically pure.
[7:05] That's according to the Hebrew. That's
[7:07] one of the definitions of perfect when
[7:09] God calls him a perfect man. So obeying
[7:13] God's commands, keeping his requirements
[7:15] makes us perfect in heaven as well by
[7:18] the blood of Jesus Christ. Okay. So
[7:21] another holy habit Job had was that he
[7:24] understood he was delivered to the
[7:26] ungodly or Satan and that he was turned
[7:29] over to the hands of the wicked. This is
[7:30] found in Job 16:1.
[7:34] So it seems like Job went back and forth
[7:37] between trusting God, knowing that God
[7:40] was testing him, but then also
[7:42] questioning God. The third attribute Job
[7:44] had was that he lived for others. This
[7:46] proves he had eternal life. He lived for
[7:49] the widows. He helped the widows in Job
[7:51] 29:13. He helped the fatherless in Job
[7:54] 29:12. He loved his enemies in Job
[7:57] 31:29.
[7:58] He did not trust in riches in Job 31 24
[8:02] and 25. And he helped strangers in Job
[8:06] 31:32.
[8:09] May that encourage us in the New
[8:10] Testament to do the same. Another
[8:13] powerful testimony about Job is that he
[8:14] overcame sexual mind battles of lust.
[8:17] According to Job 31 and:es 9 and 10, he
[8:22] made a covenant with his eyes not to
[8:23] look upon a maid.
[8:29] So this is one example of why God called
[8:32] Job a man that is skewed evil. That
[8:34] means he departed from evil. He turned
[8:37] aside. So when the girls would come by,
[8:39] he would turn aside his head and not
[8:41] look.
[8:42] And the final observation is that God
[8:44] called Job perfect which means morally
[8:47] pure. And notice God called him the
[8:49] greatest man in his generation. So that
[8:52] ought to encourage us friends to do
[8:53] these things that Job did. Pray early in
[8:56] the morning. Make sacrifices unto God.
[8:58] Help the widows, the fatherless, love
[9:01] our enemies. Do not trust in riches.
[9:03] Trust in the living God. Help strangers.
[9:06] Overcome lustful thoughts. If we do
[9:09] that, then God will call us great. We
[9:11] shouldn't call ourselves great. As
[9:13] brother M said, there is a trend among
[9:16] some message people to call themselves
[9:18] the greatest of all time or among the
[9:20] greatest of all time. I believe that's a
[9:22] sin of pride.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; Sometimes great guys get together. You
[9:26] hear him say great so and so and great
[9:28] so and so are great. Don't never do
[9:30] that. There's no great ones among us.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; There's only one great one and that's
[9:35] God.
[9:37] &gt;&gt; We are brothers, sisters.
[9:40] But as Job demonstrates, he lived for
[9:42] others. He made early morning sacrifices
[9:45] unto God. And so we must let God call us
[9:48] great or God call us good. And just one
[9:52] more thing to note in Job chapter 38
[9:54] when God comes and talks to Job, God
[9:57] speaks and says, "Who is this that
[10:00] darkeneth counsel?"
[10:02] So God doesn't even call Job by name in
[10:05] Job chapter 38. God doesn't even
[10:07] recognize his name. Yet in heaven, God
[10:10] is using his name and testifying of his
[10:13] righteousness to Satan. So this shows
[10:15] the love of God in heaven and also the
[10:17] chastening that God gives to his
[10:19] children here on earth. God called Job
[10:22] perfect in heaven, but then when God
[10:24] came down, God didn't even call him by
[10:26] name. Because as many as God loves, he
[10:29] chastens. God didn't baby Job. God
[10:32] didn't tell Job, you're the greatest of
[10:34] all time, or you're the greatest in your
[10:35] generation. God chasened him in order to
[10:39] make him more holy. Now, let's look at a
[10:42] list of Job's failures and sins, his
[10:44] human failures on earth. Job admits the
[10:48] following in the scripture. Job admits
[10:50] first he had great fear that this would
[10:52] happen to him in Job 3:2.
[10:55] And in How can I overcome 1963, brother
[10:58] Ram said Job's fear brought this upon
[11:00] him. In the book of Job, it says here
[11:03] Job feared and what he feared it
[11:06] actually happened.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; What brought it is fear.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; That's what made it happen. His faith
[11:14] would have kept him from it. But his
[11:17] fear brought him brought it to him. He
[11:19] was scared it's going to happen. And it
[11:21] did happen. Now, if he told it wouldn't
[11:24] happen, it wouldn't happen. See what I
[11:27] mean? If you're afraid when you come by
[11:28] the prayer line, maybe I just haven't
[11:30] got the face sufficient. It'll never
[11:32] happen. Don't worry.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; But if you know what's going to happen,
[11:35] it'll happen.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; See, he it's a substance of something.
[11:39] Job had a fear that these things would
[11:40] come up on him and they did. If you have
[11:42] a fear that your disease is going to
[11:44] leave you or won't leave you, it won't.
[11:46] If you have a faith that it will.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; So, we can see how God works with our
[11:51] free moral agency and our failures and
[11:54] our strengths. So because Job didn't
[11:57] cast out the fear during his life, this
[11:59] happened. Brother Ram said his fear
[12:00] brought it upon him. And yet God used
[12:03] that also as an opportunity to prove to
[12:06] the devil that Job really loved God. So
[12:09] again, all things work together for good
[12:11] to them that love the Lord, to them that
[12:13] are the called according to his purpose.
[12:16] Here's another failure. Job did a second
[12:18] one. Job said God put no trust in his
[12:21] servants in Job 4:18. But that's not
[12:23] true. God trusted Job according to Job
[12:26] 1:8 and Job 2:3.
[12:29] So Job said things that were wrong about
[12:31] God. Third, Job admitted he was speaking
[12:34] in anguish of spirit and he was
[12:36] complaining in the bitterness of his
[12:38] soul in Job 7:1. So he admitted
[12:42] complaining.
[12:44] Job admitted he was full of confusion.
[12:46] That's why I said earlier he would go
[12:47] back and forth between trusting God or
[12:50] questioning God. That's in Job 10:15.
[12:54] Job also said he got to a spot where he
[12:56] was at ease or he got too relaxed on God
[13:00] in Job 16:12.
[13:03] So, we know he was faithful most of the
[13:05] time praying early in the morning making
[13:07] sacrifices early in the morning. But he
[13:09] does tell us he got a little lazy. He
[13:12] got at ease at one point. Job said
[13:15] another thing wrong. He said God's wrath
[13:17] was kindled against him and he was an
[13:19] enemy of God. in Job 19:1. But that's
[13:21] not true. Again, if we just go back and
[13:24] read Job 1 and 2, God was bragging on
[13:27] Job to the devil. And yet, friends,
[13:30] despite all these things, Job said, his
[13:31] failures, his fears, he never cursed God
[13:35] in all of this. Praise the Lord. That's
[13:37] such an encouragement to us. We must do
[13:39] the same. We must always give God
[13:40] praise. We must always be careful what
[13:43] we say. I remember the recent video I
[13:45] put out about blasphemy. Sometimes we
[13:48] say the wrong thing. Friends, if we
[13:50] really love God, we'll feel sorry for
[13:51] it. We'll repent of any evil words we
[13:54] say and God will forgive us. Because
[13:57] Paul was the pattern. Paul blasphemed in
[13:59] ignorance. Yet God forgave him. And Paul
[14:01] said, "I'm a pattern in 1 Timothy
[14:02] chapter 1 of all who would believe." So
[14:05] that's you and I. We know God will
[14:07] forgive us just like he forgave Paul.
[14:10] Next, friends, Allahu comes and speaks
[14:12] to Job. And alahu was a type of Christ
[14:16] according to brother Brandham.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; And when these church members came and
[14:20] could not consort him, accused him of
[14:22] being a secret sinner that he had sinned
[14:24] before God. Joel knew he had not sinned.
[14:27] And he knew he was all right. But then
[14:30] God sent a young man down by the name of
[14:32] Elahu.
[14:34] Come down to me Joel. Perfect type of
[14:36] Christ again.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; So if Alahu is a type of Christ, we
[14:39] would see that Christ is corrective.
[14:41] Love is corrective. As Jesus said in
[14:44] Revelation 3, as many as I love, I
[14:46] rebuke and chasen. So notice Job gets
[14:49] two levels of correction. He gets a man
[14:51] correcting him, alahu, and then God
[14:53] comes down after that and God corrects
[14:55] Job himself. A double witness that God
[14:58] loved Job. And because God loved Job, he
[15:01] had to correct Job. So Elahu said Job
[15:04] was righteous in his own eyes and
[15:06] justified himself and not God. That's
[15:09] Job 32:es 1 and 2.
[15:13] So think of that friends. Job was making
[15:15] himself more righteous than God. He was
[15:18] exalting himself above God. Remember
[15:21] Elahu came in God'sstead or Christstead.
[15:24] We'd say as Job 33:6 says,
[15:28] Allah tells Job of his iniquity and his
[15:31] false claim that God counted him as an
[15:33] enemy. So again, Job's sins were
[15:36] iniquities. He knew they were wrong, but
[15:38] he still did them. And Allahu corrected
[15:41] him and said he was not an enemy of God.
[15:43] That's in Job 33:9 and 10.
[15:47] Allah says Job was not just and it was
[15:51] likely due to pride in Job 33 12 and 17.
[15:58] Allah says that Job said wrongly that
[16:01] God took away his judgment in Job 34:5.
[16:05] Allah who said Job was scornful in Job
[16:08] 34:7
[16:10] and Allah who said Job said it was not a
[16:13] prophet to serve God and God did
[16:15] iniquity in Job 34 9 and 10. Allah also
[16:19] said that Job condemned God who was the
[16:23] just one in Job 34:17.
[16:28] Allah went on to say that Job spoke
[16:29] without knowledge. Job spoke without
[16:31] wisdom. Job added rebellion to his sin.
[16:35] Job added words against God in Job 34:es
[16:40] 35, 36, and 37.
[16:42] And Job later agreed with this. Job
[16:45] later agreed with Elahu in Job 42:3.
[16:49] Job said that he spake without knowledge
[16:51] things that he did not understand.
[16:54] Allah then said that Job said his
[16:57] righteousness was more than God's.
[16:58] Imagine that a believer said, "I'm more
[17:01] righteous than God." That was in Job
[17:03] 35:es
[17:04] 1 2 and 3.
[17:07] And that's what Job said in Job 31:2.
[17:10] For what portion of God is there from
[17:12] above? And what inheritance of the
[17:14] Almighty from on high.
[17:18] So here we see Job exalting himself
[17:20] above God. And yet God was merciful to
[17:23] forgive him. Next, Allah said that Job
[17:26] opened his mouth in vain without
[17:28] knowledge. It's according to Job 35:16.
[17:33] And then lastly, Allah breaks into the
[17:35] mind of God in Job 36:3
[17:38] because he starts identifying nature
[17:40] such as rain, clouds, light, lightning,
[17:44] thunder, snow, frost, sky, and wind.
[17:48] And this is exactly what God does in the
[17:50] next few chapters in Job 38, 39,40 and
[17:54] 41. So Elahu starts bringing all these
[17:58] examples of nature that Job cannot
[18:00] control. Job cannot explain. So this
[18:03] shows again how Elahu was a type of
[18:04] Christ. Christ was God in the flesh.
[18:07] Emmanuel, God with us. Elahu said what
[18:10] God was going to say. Jesus said, "I
[18:13] only speak that which the father gives
[18:14] me." And Allah had said earlier that he
[18:17] spake by inspiration of the Almighty.
[18:20] In this final section here, God himself
[18:22] comes down to Job and identifies the
[18:25] following sins in Job's life.
[18:29] First, God said, "Who is this to Job?"
[18:31] Notice God doesn't call Job my son or my
[18:34] servant. Although he did call Job his
[18:36] servant when he was speaking to Job's
[18:38] three miserable comforters in Job 42 7
[18:41] and 8. So when God comes down to correct
[18:44] us, many times it's in rebuke, but yet
[18:46] that's a sign of God's love. God said
[18:49] that Job darkened counsel without
[18:51] knowledge. So Job brought a darkness
[18:54] upon God, exalting himself above God,
[18:57] and he spoke things he didn't
[18:59] understand. That's in Job 38:2.
[19:03] And notice this is powerful. God said
[19:05] Job was guilty of contending with him in
[19:08] order to instruct God and reprove God.
[19:11] That's in Job 40:2.
[19:15] So Job was trying to correct God. Job
[19:18] was trying to teach God. And so what
[19:20] does God do? God comes down in those
[19:22] chapters 38, 39, 40, 41. And God asks
[19:26] Job over 70 questions about nature,
[19:29] about the elements of weather. 70
[19:32] questions Job cannot answer. And then
[19:35] God never does directly answer Job's
[19:38] questions that he had throughout the
[19:40] book of Job. So God is trying to humble
[19:43] Job. He doesn't answer his questions. He
[19:45] just gives more questions to Job so Job
[19:48] can have an idea of how great God is. If
[19:51] God controls over 70 elements of nature,
[19:54] all the beasts of the field, the weather
[19:57] patterns, the sky, the planets, the
[19:58] stars, surely God knows about Job's
[20:01] life. And God is in control of Job's
[20:03] life.
[20:05] And then let's look at Job's response
[20:07] after God comes down and asks him these
[20:09] 70 questions and rebukes him. Job said,
[20:12] "I am vile." In Job 40:4 again, that
[20:15] means dishonorable, insignificant.
[20:20] And then Job said, "I abhore myself."
[20:23] Job hates himself. In other words, he
[20:24] hated his sinful nature and repented in
[20:27] dust and ashes in Job 42:6.
[20:32] In closing,
[20:34] friends, hope this video was a blessing
[20:35] by the grace of God. Just like Job,
[20:38] friends, we too are perfect in heaven.
[20:40] The Bible says we're accepted in the
[20:42] beloved. We're seated in heavenly
[20:43] places. There's no condemnation to us
[20:46] because we're in Christ Jesus. And if
[20:48] God is for us, who can be against us
[20:50] according to Romans chapter 8. And all
[20:53] this is possible by the blood of Jesus
[20:55] Christ. The blood sacrifice we are
[20:57] trusting in. Praying to God daily for
[20:59] forgiveness of sins. Confessing our
[21:01] sins, knowing that if we confess them,
[21:03] God is faithful and just to forgive us
[21:04] of all unrighteousness. While at the
[21:07] same time here on earth, we're in need
[21:09] of correction. We're in need of humility
[21:11] and daily repentance as we serve God on
[21:14] earth as we daily bring this human
[21:18] sinful nature into subjection to the
[21:20] word of God. This reminds us of Jesus
[21:22] saying, "Take up your cross daily and
[21:24] follow me." In Luke 9:23, Jesus gives
[21:27] lots of images or metaphors of the
[21:30] Christian life. It's like a runner
[21:31] running a race. It's like a farmer
[21:34] planting his crops. But he also says
[21:36] it's like taking up a cross and
[21:38] following Jesus. This would be the most
[21:41] uncomfortable metaphor of all. Daily
[21:44] dragging a cross around following the
[21:46] Lord Jesus Christ. gives the imagery of
[21:49] being tired, worn out, slowly dying
[21:52] every single day, dying out to our sin
[21:55] nature. But this daily dying will
[21:57] produce the character of Christ in us.
[21:59] The character of Christ is likened unto
[22:01] gold. Job knew these tests would bring
[22:03] forth his Christlike character as well.
[22:05] Job 23:10, when he hath tried me, I
[22:08] shall come forth as gold. Peter in the
[22:11] New Testament, Peter 1:7 says, "That the
[22:13] trial of your faith being much more
[22:15] precious than of gold that perisheth,
[22:17] though it be tried with fire, might be
[22:19] found unto praise and honor and glory at
[22:21] the appearing of Jesus Christ."
[22:24] Nothing's more valuable than our
[22:25] character getting tested to become more
[22:28] like Jesus Christ.
[22:31] And lastly, Jesus tells us in the
[22:32] Leosian church age, Revelation 3:18, I
[22:35] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[22:38] the fire. So gold is time-tested
[22:40] character of a Christian. We have to go
[22:43] to Jesus and say, "I want to buy that. I
[22:46] want time-tested character. I want to be
[22:49] corrected. I want to be made more like
[22:52] Christ by taking up my cross daily and
[22:54] follow him." By taking up my cross daily
[22:57] and following him. And then Revelation
[22:59] 3:19, "As many as I love, I rebuke and
[23:02] chasen. Be zealous therefore and
[23:03] repent." That's what God wanted Job to
[23:05] do, to be zealous to repent. And that's
[23:08] what God wants us to do as well. That's
[23:09] what Job did. I repent in dust and
[23:11] ashes. And then friends, if we do that,
[23:14] we have a promise that we'll be
[23:15] overcomers just like Job overcame. Now,
[23:19] we won't all be like Job and get double
[23:21] blessings after our trials here on the
[23:23] earth, but for sure, we'll get those
[23:24] blessings in heaven. The rewards are
[23:27] waiting for the believer in heaven.
[23:29] Hebrews 6:10 says, "For God is not
[23:31] unrighteous to forget your work and
[23:33] labor of love, which you have shued
[23:36] toward his name, in that ye have
[23:38] ministered to the saints and do
[23:40] minister." God sees your labor. Just
[23:43] keep ministering to the saints. Just
[23:46] keep ministering to others, even
[23:48] enemies. The great reward is to him that
[23:51] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[23:52] in my throne, even as I also overcame,
[23:55] and am set down with my father in his
[23:58] throne.
[23:59] We want character that is fit to rule.
[24:01] As brother Ram said in the church age
[24:02] book, character is a victory, not a
[24:05] gift.
[24:08] If you have any questions, concerns or
[24:09] testimonies about this video, please

[24:13] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[24:15] the desire of your heart.
[24:19] I'm very happy to be here this afternoon
[24:21] and again in defense of the gospel of
[24:23] Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings,
[24:26] the good news that Jesus raised from the
[24:28] dead, living among man today, his
[24:30] church. The same Jesus that was
[24:33] yesterday will be today and forever. He
[24:37] has never failed.
