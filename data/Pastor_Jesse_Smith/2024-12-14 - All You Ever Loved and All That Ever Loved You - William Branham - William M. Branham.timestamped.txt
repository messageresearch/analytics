[0:03] all that you ever loved and all that
[0:06] ever loved you is gathered here with you
[0:10] to meet
[0:11] God greetings friends in the matchless
[0:14] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:17] purpose of this video is to understand
[0:19] brother bram's statement when he went
[0:21] beyond the curtain of time and said he
[0:23] was told that all he ever loved and all
[0:27] that ever loved him would be given to
[0:29] him as a reward for a service to the
[0:31] Lord numerous people have asked me over
[0:33] the years does this mean people will be
[0:36] saved even if they weren't Believers in
[0:39] other words do Believers have this
[0:40] blessing that anyone they love will be
[0:43] saved by God I believe the answer is no
[0:46] I believe every person that is going to
[0:48] be saved must repent of their sins and
[0:51] accept Jesus Christ as their lord and
[0:53] savior on an individual basis by the
[0:55] grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith
[0:58] pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here
[1:00] in Aran Ohio USA and I defend the
[1:02] original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04] that he revealed to St Paul and then had
[1:06] to restore through Martin Luther John
[1:08] Wesley and the late Prophet William
[1:10] Marian brandham who lived from 1909 to
[1:13] 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly
[1:15] Christian character so in this video I'm
[1:18] defending the original Gospel of the
[1:19] Lord Jesus Christ how salvation is
[1:22] through faith in the blood of Jesus
[1:24] Christ and with this understanding from
[1:26] the scripture we'll understand better
[1:28] brother Ram's experience when he went
[1:30] beyond the curtain of time so let's
[1:31] begin by listening to a quote from God's
[1:34] Prophet brother William brandham there's
[1:35] at least 10 quotes or more where brother
[1:37] randam talks about his experience going
[1:39] beyond the curtain of time the first
[1:41] time I can find that he tells about this
[1:43] experience was May 1960 when he preached
[1:46] the rejected King at the brandham
[1:48] Tabernacle and then he told this all the
[1:50] way up to the final year of his life
[1:53] 1965 and we're listening to the first
[1:55] time he told it publicly it would have
[1:57] been in June of 1960 and the sermon
[2:00] having conferences I want you to notice
[2:02] the context in which brother brandom
[2:05] said the voice told him all that he ever
[2:08] loved and all that ever loved him would
[2:10] be given to him the context is at the
[2:13] end of brother Ram's translation or
[2:16] Vision or experience he says going
[2:17] beyond the curtain of time and at the
[2:19] very end of this experience his horse
[2:23] Prince and his dog Fritz come running to
[2:25] him and it was at that moment that the
[2:28] voice said all that you have loved and
[2:30] all that ever loved you would be given
[2:32] to you so I believe in context this
[2:34] statement is referring to the animals
[2:37] that brother brandom loved and that
[2:38] loved brother brandom during his
[2:40] lifetime would be given to him as a
[2:42] reward right after this experience with
[2:44] his former horse and dog brother ROM
[2:47] feels himself leaving that Dimension and
[2:49] coming back and then he finds himself
[2:52] there in his bed again let's listen to
[2:54] the quote old dog was gone I always
[2:56] thought after Sav I thought wonder when
[2:58] I get over there if I see old Fritz
[3:00] and while I was sitting there I look
[3:02] coming down across the you only hear
[3:03] come old Fritz coming up to me and he
[3:06] was just licking his tongue you on
[3:08] panting like that looking at me I look
[3:10] come in behind him and here come old
[3:11] Prince my horse my saddle horse and he
[3:14] run up to me and he put his neck around
[3:16] me and I said oh God what is this just
[3:20] then a voice spoke and said all that you
[3:23] ever loved and all that ever loved you
[3:27] God has given to you we all here
[3:29] together oh my my heart just melled
[3:32] within me all that you ever loved and
[3:37] all that ever loved you is gathered here
[3:40] with you to meet God hallelujah I said
[3:43] oh praise be to God and about that time
[3:46] I felt myself moving I said I don't have
[3:48] to go back do her and I kept in just a
[3:51] minute I was back there at the bed again
[3:54] so now friends let's look at the Bible
[3:55] what the Bible talks about in regards to
[3:58] people being saved
[4:00] one of the most important verses is acts
[4:02] 238 which says repent be baptized every
[4:04] one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[4:06] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[4:08] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[4:10] and this was right after acts 236 where
[4:13] the multitude asked what shall we do and
[4:16] they had pricked Hearts they had
[4:17] convicted hearts hearts convicted of sin
[4:19] so we see the church was birthed on the
[4:21] day of Pentecost with this salvation
[4:24] prescription we might say the first step
[4:26] is repentance and there's three steps to
[4:29] repentance
[4:30] it's abhorring your past sins it's
[4:33] changing your mind about your sins and
[4:35] it's making amends for your sins
[4:37] according to the Greek Lexicon so the
[4:39] first step of Salvation is repenting
[4:42] from past sins having faith in the blood
[4:44] of Jesus Christ according to Romans
[4:46] chapter 3 also Ephesians 2 says we're
[4:49] saved by grace through faith so a person
[4:52] must have faith in the blood of Jesus
[4:53] Christ trusting in the all sufficient
[4:56] sacrifice of the cross of Jesus Christ
[4:58] repenting of his sins knowing that our
[5:00] sins were placed upon Christ and that
[5:02] Christ's righteousness is imputed unto
[5:04] us for salvation and then Romans 1013
[5:08] says whosoever shall call upon the name
[5:10] of the Lord shall be saved so an
[5:11] individual must call Upon Jesus himself
[5:15] or herself repenting of their sin
[5:17] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ
[5:19] for forgiveness and the righteousness of
[5:21] Christ given to the repentant sinner who
[5:23] now become a saint by the grace of God a
[5:26] separated one unto the purpose and
[5:28] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:30] so when a person repents they're
[5:31] Justified which means declared righteous
[5:33] as they wish to be this state of
[5:35] justification is also the first step in
[5:37] the three steps of Grace it's the new
[5:39] heart experience as Ezekiel 36 said new
[5:42] heart justification new spirit
[5:44] sanctification and my spirit or God's
[5:47] spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[5:49] this state of justification this new
[5:51] heart experience is also the first step
[5:53] on the stature of perfect man according
[5:55] to Second Peter chapter 1 faith is the
[5:57] first step Faith virtue
[6:00] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[6:03] brotherly kindness and then the Capstone
[6:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Charity
[6:08] Now using the Bible I want to show a
[6:10] beautiful powerful example of how even
[6:13] the love of Jesus could not save the
[6:15] Rich Young Ruler so again this scripture
[6:17] proves that we have to understand
[6:19] brother bram's Vision the correct way we
[6:23] can't just assume anyone we love on the
[6:24] street or anyone in our family is going
[6:26] to be saved just cuz we love them that
[6:28] person has to love God they have to love
[6:30] the Lord Jesus Christ and repent of
[6:31] their sins because here in Mark 10 verse
[6:35] 21 the Bible said then Jesus beholding
[6:38] him loved him and of course then Jesus
[6:40] told him what he had to do what he
[6:41] lacked he lacked the love of God he had
[6:44] too much selfishness about his worldly
[6:46] goods and riches but then in verse 22
[6:49] the Rich Young Ruler was sad at Jesus's
[6:51] saying went away grief for he had great
[6:53] possessions brother brandom of course
[6:55] tells us that the Rich Young Ruler was
[6:57] likely lost and went to hell brother
[6:59] Bram taught the Rich Young Ruler grew up
[7:01] and became the rich man that went to
[7:04] hell in Luke 16 in hell he lifted up his
[7:07] eyes he was the one that was neglectful
[7:10] of the beggar Lazarus remember Lazarus
[7:13] was saved and the rich man was lost so
[7:17] if that's true even Jesus's own love and
[7:20] compassion for the Rich Young Ruler was
[7:22] enough to save the rich wrong ruler
[7:24] because each individual must repent and
[7:26] trust in the Lord Jesus Christ to be
[7:29] saved so this is a powerful story of
[7:31] Jesus's love and it proves God has love
[7:34] for the sinner because he's the same
[7:36] yesterday today and forever according to
[7:38] Hebrews 13:8 brother Ram said quote God
[7:41] loves Sinners but hates his sin end
[7:43] quote so God loves Sinners but he hates
[7:45] their sin because God is love according
[7:49] to 1 John 4:16 God is love and he that
[7:51] dwelleth in him dwelleth in God and God
[7:54] in him John 3:16 said for God so loved
[7:58] the world so God has a love for Sinners
[8:01] God has a compassion for Sinners just
[8:02] like Jesus had compassion and love he
[8:05] looked on the Rich Young Ruler and loved
[8:07] him we see the same idea in the Old
[8:09] Testament Ezekiel
[8:10] 33:11 as I live sayith the Lord I have
[8:13] no pleasure in the death of the wicked
[8:15] but that the wicked turn from his way
[8:17] and live so God has always had a
[8:19] compassionate love upon all Sinners
[8:23] that's why he sends his rain upon the
[8:24] just and the unjust he lets the sun rise
[8:27] upon the just and the unjust according
[8:28] to Matthew CH 5
[8:30] because God is love now let's look at
[8:33] some more quotes from God's Prophet
[8:34] brother
[8:36] brandom in this first quote brother
[8:38] brandom says I can't save you I can only
[8:41] obey what he says do it's up to you for
[8:44] your salvation shall we pray so
[8:47] obviously brother Ram put the importance
[8:49] of being saved on the individual brother
[8:51] Ram said I can't save you you've got to
[8:54] choose to accept God's grace and be
[8:56] saved let's listen to the quote but
[8:58] Jesus is give you a sign these signs
[9:02] shall follow them that
[9:03] [Applause]
[9:05] believe I can't save you I can only obey
[9:08] what he says do it's up to you for your
[9:10] salvation shall we pray in the next
[9:13] quote brother Ram says a minister can't
[9:15] save you he can tell you the word and
[9:17] point you to Christ and then he says and
[9:19] Christ can't save you what he's already
[9:21] done he saved you 1,900 years ago you
[9:24] just have to accept it so brother's
[9:26] talking about how the sacrifice of Jesus
[9:29] Christ already purchased your healing
[9:32] nearly 2,000 years ago and you just have
[9:34] to accept what Christ did he shed his
[9:36] blood he was wounded for your
[9:38] transgressions but with his stripes you
[9:40] were healed you just have to accept the
[9:42] Saving Grace that's already been
[9:44] provided for you by the Cross of Christ
[9:47] let's listen to the quote a man
[9:49] preaching Divine Healing doesn't make
[9:50] him a Healer no more it makes a man a
[9:53] savior a minister can't save you he can
[9:56] tell you the word and point you to
[9:57] Christ and Christ came save you what
[10:00] he's already done he saved you 1900
[10:03] years ago you just have to accept
[10:06] it well then he man can't heal you he
[10:09] can only point you to Christ who healed
[10:11] you 1900 years ago when he died and the
[10:15] next quote brother BR said because man
[10:17] can't save you when man can only make an
[10:19] altar call but it's your individual or
[10:21] personal faith and trust in God to
[10:24] plunge beneath the blood and to be
[10:25] filled with his spirit and by become a
[10:28] partaker of the Divine not a partaker of
[10:31] the church a partaker of the Divine so A
[10:33] beautiful statement from God's Prophet
[10:35] brother brandom again placing it on the
[10:36] individual brother Ram never said well
[10:38] if I just love you you can be saved he
[10:40] said you've got to trust in the blood of
[10:42] Jesus Christ and you've got to be
[10:44] plunged underneath the blood of Jesus
[10:46] Christ you must come to the fountain
[10:48] filled with blood drawn from emanuel's
[10:50] veins let's listen to the quote I think
[10:53] the day that great man has swept this
[10:55] nation back and forth Jack schoters
[10:57] Billy Grims many others went over and
[10:59] over and over and over through the
[11:01] nation and go right back the same year
[11:03] and find the same group that he preached
[11:05] to just as far diluted in sin as he ever
[11:08] was because man can't save you the man
[11:12] can only make an overall but it's your
[11:14] individual of personal faith and trust
[11:18] in God to plunge beneath the
[11:20] blood and to be filled with his
[11:23] spirit and become a partakers of the
[11:26] Divine not a partaker of the church a
[11:28] partaker of the Divine the divine nature
[11:31] changing your own vile nature into a
[11:34] nature that loves God who BS every word
[11:36] that he said is the truth and accepting
[11:38] it as your own personal gift from God in
[11:41] the next quote brother Ram said there's
[11:42] no man that can save you I don't care
[11:44] what he does he can't save you he can't
[11:47] do nothing to save you Christ saves you
[11:49] but he's made the way for you to be
[11:51] saved brother Ram said it's your faith
[11:54] so see the individual must have faith in
[11:57] the blood of Jesus Christ only Christ
[11:59] saves Believers our human love and
[12:02] compassion for others will not save them
[12:04] the individual must have love for Jesus
[12:06] Christ must repent of his sins and want
[12:09] to be saved that's the gospel let's
[12:12] listen to the quote now we misunderstand
[12:15] when we say healing when we say
[12:17] salvation there's no man can save you I
[12:21] don't care what he does he can't save
[12:23] you he can't baptize you enough in water
[12:25] he can't do nothing to save you Christ
[12:28] saves you
[12:29] but he's made the way for you to be
[12:32] saved remember you can only be saved by
[12:37] your personal
[12:38] faith you can only be healed by your
[12:41] personal faith you believe this to be
[12:42] the Bible am God's word you believe your
[12:46] pastor to be a man of God whatever
[12:48] Church you go to if you don't you should
[12:50] leave it get to a man that is a man of
[12:53] God then if you believe him believe he's
[12:54] telling you the truth then accept that
[12:56] your own personal faith in Christ saves
[12:58] you no matter how good your pastor is
[13:01] how Godly saintly your mother is how how
[13:06] real the word of God is how much you cry
[13:09] how much you pray it's your
[13:11] faith that saves You by faith are you
[13:15] saved in the next quote brother Ram said
[13:18] a believer's got to be born just exact
[13:20] like his daddy was cuz God doesn't have
[13:23] grandchildren he's got to have the
[13:25] experience he can't go in on Papa's
[13:27] experience or Mama's experience you got
[13:29] to have your own experience that was
[13:31] their birth you know you have to have a
[13:33] birth too so this proves people cannot
[13:36] be saved through brother bram's
[13:37] experience each individual must have
[13:39] their own baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:42] experience let's listen to the quote a
[13:44] lot of people it's half born part of the
[13:46] way born
[13:48] grandsons as davidy said the other night
[13:51] God don't have
[13:53] grandchildren he only has sons and
[13:56] daughters but when comes to a place that
[14:01] a grandchild that's just brought in by
[14:04] cause his mother was Pentecostal or his
[14:06] daddy was Pentecostal he becomes part of
[14:07] the church no sir he's got to be born
[14:11] just like his daddy was God doesn't have
[14:16] grandchildren he's got to have the
[14:18] experience you can't go on Papa's
[14:21] experience or Mama's experience you got
[14:23] to have your own experience that was
[14:25] their birth you don't you have to have a
[14:27] birth too God don't recog has
[14:29] grandchildren am he doesn't have any
[14:32] they're all sons and daughters in the
[14:35] next quote brother Ram's talking about
[14:37] Moses on the back side of the desert and
[14:39] brother Ram said every Christian should
[14:41] have that experience before they say
[14:42] anything about being a Christian your
[14:44] own experience no man has a right to
[14:47] call himself a Christian until he's
[14:49] talked face to face with God so again
[14:52] brother Ram never says I can talk to God
[14:54] for you and my love for you can save you
[14:57] no brother Ram said every IND individual
[14:59] must meet God face to face in order to
[15:02] repent and be saved let's listen to the
[15:04] quote so no man has the right to call
[15:07] himself thus until he's talked face to
[15:09] face with God on a backside of a desert
[15:13] somewhere where he met God himself and
[15:15] all the atheists in the world could not
[15:18] explain it away from him he was there he
[15:20] know it happened every Christian should
[15:22] have that experience before they say
[15:24] anything about being a Christian your
[15:27] own experience next point I want to make
[15:29] is that brother Ram did say there will
[15:31] be surprises on the day of Judgment of
[15:33] course this will be foolish virgins
[15:35] there's two types of Christians two
[15:37] different resurrections for those two
[15:38] different type of Christians now we see
[15:40] the foolish virgins resurrected and
[15:42] saved at the white Throne judgment we
[15:45] see this in Matthew 25:
[15:47] 34-40 These Foolish virgins will be
[15:50] surprised at the Judgment because they
[15:52] were secret Believers as brother Ram
[15:55] taught and brother RAM used biblical
[15:57] examples for us to understand men like
[16:00] jeras Nicodemus and Gia in Matthew 25
[16:05] 34-40 these Believers were surprised on
[16:08] the day of judgment because they had a
[16:10] secret faith in Christ but they did a
[16:12] few public acts of Grace and kindness
[16:15] towards Holy Ghost filled Saints and
[16:17] that was proof of their faith Jesus gave
[16:20] six acts that they did and when they did
[16:23] these acts to Believers it was as if
[16:26] they were doing it to Christ himself
[16:28] they visited the believer in prison they
[16:29] fed them when they were hungry they
[16:31] clothed them when they were naked they
[16:32] provided housing to them they gave them
[16:35] drink when they were thirsty and they
[16:36] visited the sick so the foolish virgins
[16:40] many of them will be surprised on the
[16:41] day of judgment but they're saved
[16:43] because they were secret believers they
[16:45] belied in God therefore they visited
[16:46] God's people they helped God's people in
[16:49] their times of trouble brother Ram
[16:51] clearly taught this in chapter 7 of the
[16:53] church age book in the sardian church
[16:55] age brother Ram said they're given
[16:57] eternal life on the ground that they've
[16:59] been kind and good to the
[17:01] Brethren and These Foolish virgins will
[17:03] also be judged by their Works according
[17:05] to Revelation
[17:06] 20:2 but remember they're not saved by
[17:09] works but the works are proof that they
[17:11] had Faith because Galatians 5:6 says
[17:14] Faith Works by love so the foolish
[17:16] virgins had love for God they must have
[17:19] secretly repented had a new heart got
[17:21] Justified got saved but they could only
[17:23] go to that first step of justification
[17:26] but that love for God gave them faith
[17:28] faith and that Faith caused them to work
[17:31] and go minister to those Holy Ghost
[17:33] filled Saints in those six conditions
[17:36] they were in prison they were hungry
[17:38] they needed clothes they needed housing
[17:41] they were thirsty or they were sick so
[17:44] again no man or woman is saved by works
[17:46] they're saved by grace through faith but
[17:48] that Faith must work according to
[17:50] Galatians 5:6 it starts with receiving
[17:52] the love of Christ that gives us faith
[17:54] and that causes us to work and do
[17:56] something for others by the grace of God
[17:58] regarding Nicodemus and Gia brother
[18:00] Braham said because of their love of the
[18:02] people of God they'll be recognized and
[18:05] saved they served and help the children
[18:07] of God in times of trouble brother Ram
[18:09] said perhaps like Nicodemus and Gia they
[18:12] stood for the children in a time of
[18:13] trouble so again brother Ram gives us a
[18:15] perhaps brother Ram doesn't know for
[18:16] sure that Nicodemus or Gia will be the
[18:19] foolish virgins but he says perhaps
[18:21] because in the scripture we see they
[18:23] were secret believers they love God to a
[18:25] certain degree but they could only live
[18:27] a little bit of the word they couldn't
[18:28] live all the word of God but they never
[18:30] blasphemed the message of the hour then
[18:32] brother Ram called him a separated
[18:34] god-loving people trying to abide in the
[18:37] word according to all that they knew and
[18:39] they were help in the work of the Lord
[18:41] and will come up at the end time now
[18:43] regarding the secret believer brother
[18:44] Bram said God forces the secret believer
[18:47] to the issue of standing for him he said
[18:50] God knows how to force you to show your
[18:53] color what you are so we see that in
[18:55] jer's case God forced the issue he had
[18:57] to decide was he going to believe Jesus
[18:59] or not so he believed Jesus and his
[19:01] daughter was resurrected we see this
[19:03] with Nicodemus Nicodemus eventually left
[19:07] the Sanhedrin he stood for Jesus
[19:09] Nicodemus was mentioned as taking part
[19:11] in the preparation for the anointing and
[19:13] burial of the body of Christ so God
[19:15] brought the issue on Nicodemus to show
[19:17] his true colors he was a Believer just a
[19:19] secret believer and then God did the
[19:21] same for Gia in the book of Acts some of
[19:23] the Jews wanted to kill the apostles but
[19:25] G said don't kill them if it's of God
[19:28] you can't stop it if it's not of God
[19:29] it'll come to not so gilia stood for the
[19:32] children of God in a time of trouble so
[19:34] if you like a full teaching on this I
[19:36] preached on this on August 18th 2024
[19:39] called The Secret believer I'll leave a
[19:41] link to it in the description by the
[19:43] grace of God in
[19:45] closing friends hope this video was a
[19:47] blessing by the grace of God As I said
[19:49] over the years I've been asked this
[19:50] question numerous times does brother
[19:52] Ram's experience apply to us his
[19:55] experience of hearing all that you ever
[19:57] loved and all that ever loved you given
[20:00] to you as a reward so it seems like
[20:02] maybe in relation to our animals in our
[20:04] life I believe that would be given to
[20:06] every believer because we know there's
[20:08] animals in heaven in Revelation 19 all
[20:11] these horses come out of Heaven there's
[20:13] horses that came and got Elijah when he
[20:15] was raptured there in 2 Kings but I do
[20:17] not believe this statement all you ever
[20:19] loved refers to humans I do not believe
[20:23] one human can save another I believe
[20:25] each individual human must repent of his
[20:28] own own sin and have personal faith in
[20:31] the Lord Jesus Christ himself in order
[20:33] to be saved just as the scriptures told
[20:36] us from Ephesians 2 Romans 10 acts 238
[20:40] and of course there's many other
[20:41] scriptures that relate to salvation but
[20:43] the individual must have faith in the
[20:45] Lord Jesus Christ in order to be saved
[20:47] friends it's such an amazing picture of
[20:49] God's love in Matthew 25 with the
[20:51] foolish virgins there at the white
[20:52] Throne judgment These Foolish virgins
[20:54] didn't even know Jesus was veiled behind
[20:58] his breath Brethren the Holy Ghost
[20:59] filled Saints reminds us of the sermon
[21:01] brother random preached the unveiling of
[21:03] God brother R showed how God always
[21:05] veiled himself in the pillar of fire in
[21:07] mzc he veiled himself in the Tabernacle
[21:10] of Moses Tabernacle of Solomon and then
[21:12] he veiled the fullness of the godhead B
[21:14] in his son Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory
[21:17] to God for that but now he's veiled
[21:19] behind Believers not the fullness of God
[21:21] but a portion of God a measure of God
[21:23] living behind every believer today who's
[21:26] baptized with the Holy Ghost so God 's
[21:28] love is so amazing that he would save
[21:31] secret believers who had salvation in a
[21:34] private secret way in their lives he
[21:36] would save them and acknowledge their
[21:37] works of being good to his Brethren the
[21:40] Holy Ghost filled Saints it's so amazing
[21:42] that Jesus told These Foolish virgins he
[21:45] even knew them before the foundation of
[21:47] the world Matthew
[21:49] 25:34 then shall the king say unto them
[21:51] on his right hand come he blessed on my
[21:53] father so all these secret Believers
[21:55] were still blessed by God God forne them
[21:59] before the foundation of the world Jesus
[22:01] said they'll inherit the Kingdom
[22:02] prepared for you from the foundation of
[22:04] the world so again it proves Jesus
[22:07] Christ has forn knowledge of every
[22:09] single believer whether wise virgin or
[22:11] foolish virgin Jesus has great
[22:13] compassion on both so I trust this topic
[22:15] has been a great blessing to your heart
[22:17] again seeing the amazing love of our
[22:20] Lord Jesus Christ and may this inspire
[22:22] all of us to be good to the Brethren
[22:25] other Holy Ghost filled Saints foolish
[22:27] virgin even our enemy Jesus said we're
[22:29] supposed to love our enemies so let's
[22:31] visit them in prison let's feed them
[22:33] let's give them clothes let's house them
[22:36] let's give them drinks and let's visit
[22:38] the sick let's Express the love of Jesus
[22:40] Christ to all
[22:42] Humanity if you have any questions
[22:44] concerns or testimonies about this video
[22:46] please contact
[22:47] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[22:50] the desire of your heart
