TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] i think the storm put out our wi-fi so i have to use a phone as a hot spot to do the live stream tonight so saints can hear the word god but just i like to bring things just the external battery power to the live stream did she turn on the live stream i just thought i'd share my answer because i was listening to other preachers this weekend um but some people think that uh you know with biden and harris they might win that they would be the fulfillment of brotherhood's vision about america so i just want to share a few things about that i just to make it short in summary i don't know if it is the fulfillment or not i'm not sure myself so um i've heard a couple preachers say it is but i i think that they're just presuming that's just my opinion there's a couple reasons for that the first one it's kind of out of order so if the order number five the fifth thing that happened was the advancement in technology with the roads and the driverless cars well that hasn't happened yet it's closer it's really close um tesla i just saw a few heart attacks uh the last few weeks they're really close they're closer than ever before yeah so i have a website and i was reading it uh from october they feel like they're closer than ever to get ready they have a couple of a couple companies against waymo waymo's the company used to be the google cars they are now active in arizona uh it's like a taxi service okay for driverless cars but arizona is good with at least some of the parks right that's right there's some parts that get snow right up and down i don't know about that i wouldn't do anything about that i've never been out so i don't know anything about it just what i've heard anyways uh they're looking to go to like uh after you know they're established in arizona they're looking to go with the driverless cars um to warmer places like florida texas and then i think san francisco i'm not mistaken so anyways they're not quite up on that and that was the fifth vision the sixth vision um was the election okay it's either it was either a brotherhood said it plainly the church age book but the ramp says i believe that the woman that rises in power is the roman catholic church he said but i knew it could also be a president or vice president he said but then the nation bowed to the woman so we have to think what woman would an entire nation bow to so um i think i think it's just presuming to say that that the fifth or the sixth vision is fulfilled i think that's presuming um because it may be possible too you know president trump could still win the election it's possible i think the chances are slimmer each day um but anyways i just want to share that with you that i told the brother that i wasn't sure i think it's i just don't think it's a wise thing to say it is because i was preaching in 2016 that it was going to be hillary clinton was going to be the fulfillment of that and i was wrong so i i don't want to i try to learn my lesson from that and not try to jump ahead uh about prophecy billing i'm sorry prophecy being fulfilled so i told the brother i said i don't know i i personally think it's the catholic church but it could be again it could be you know a catholic president joe biden and a woman vice president it could be that and then the catholic church working through them because i guess i didn't already met with the catholic pro with the pope i guess i didn't see that but someone said he did so all i know is that whoever the woman is the nation has to bow i don't know any other uh bowing that the nation will do other than that what brother ram talked about in the squeeze where the the the ecumenical move will get so much power that they will persecute the true bride they're trying to put v i don't know so i i just i just feel like that fifth one would actually be fulfilled first because all the other ones were right in order you know with communism fascists all the other ones were right in order so it seemed like the driverless cars had to be fulfilled the rams said i saw them driving on beautiful highways and they were playing games in the vehicle and everything so i just thought i'd update you on that i don't know for sure you're not going to see me jump to conclusions because i've already done that i don't want to do that again i want to jump to conclusions all right so i didn't update everybody on that okay all right so we'll stand here let's stand and we'll go back to scripture here so tonight i want to go back to uh 23. let's finish that thought number is 23 all right that's uh numbers 23 23. so we see in this scripture church that no one can curse what god has blessed because it's god's work amen i'm here glad to be god's work cannot curse what god has his hands on and he's working on his blessing praise god let's read verse 23 together one two three surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel heavenly father we're happy so happy to be in your house tonight it's good to see our sister karen and your granddaughter lord bless her lord with your family lord jesus so thankful for all the saints that press the road to the house of god i think of the lands great sacrifice and all the saints coming out again lord god we're so thankful lord god to be gathered together with saints of life precious faith this is like heaven to us lord we've just spiritually now we've stepped into heavenly places because we're in christ jesus so father we feel great peace we feel a great love lord god in a holy uh hedge about us lord we're so grateful for that we just ask lord that your spirit will minister to us lord god uh the deeds that we have lord questions we may have uh we're grateful for the testimony we heard about this morning and meeting the needs lord we're so thankful uh god we just pray you'll do great things here for us tonight lord i look at the prayer list i didn't forget to pray for these so i want to pray you'll be with sister wendy lord god bless her strengthen her lord god i pray for healing for my family my dad mom and brother lord just rid their bodies from this protovirus i pray they could have no lasting effects well we ask that in jesus name pray for this young man stan lee was baptized today father bless him they find a home church lord and we pray for this unspoken need now know us lord god make us more than conquerors lord encourage us strengthen us let us know lord god that nothing can separate us from the love of christ thank you lord for that great promise lord encourage every heart and soul tonight physically here lord in the person and also live streaming and the archive that you might be glorified in jesus christ so let me set it for 40 minutes and we'll see how we do i hate to just preach 40 minutes for karen we drove an hour 15 minutes to get here what's your grandmother's name again monica let's give monica around [Laughter] so i'd like to we'll finish this thought church with uh lord willing with um deuteronomy number is 23. he makes those up and then i want to get to this really good thought at the end um it's a it's a thought i never seen before so a couple weeks ago i was i was so excited i was telling my wife about this did you ever hear you ever read this in the bible it's a good thought about the promised land so i want to close with that but first let's uh finish up here numbers 23 23 no devil or no witchcraft worker or curious arts worker can put any curse upon those god is blessed because we are in the hand of god being formed and shaped into the image of christ praise god uh god balak uh balaam said neither curse them right they cannot be cursed they can't be blessed i'm sorry they can't be cursed they can only be blessed and what does balak say baalik says i'm fine don't curse them or bless them that's impossible right you're either curse or you're blessed right and so a balak had a bad attitude and he had he was against god's people uh now i want to keep reading numbers 23 26 but balaam answered and said unto balak told nah i thee saying all that the lord speaketh that must i do and balak said unto balaam verse 27 come i pray thee i will bring thee unto another place per adventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from fence isn't that is that interesting an unbeliever thinks well maybe the location determines if somebody's blessed or cursed i'll say this it doesn't determine the location physically it determines your spiritual location praise god because i'm i am dead and my life is hid in christ jesus praise god amen paul says we're dead of ourselves but our lives are in other words our location our place of habitation is in christ amen it's in the holy spirit praise god but this man balak thought well maybe if we change their uh maybe we change the physical location like we can curse them from a different angle there's no angle you can curse god's children and praise god now this morning i wanted to get to this uh and brother amen uh sang about it zechariah 9 9. i was looking at that idea of the shout of a king and remember they did shout for the king jesus when he came on uh the cult the foul of an ass right zechariah 9 9 rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a quote a foul of an ass so here we see the shouting at the coming of a king praise god and that's what uh balak and balaam saw they saw this shout of the king amongst israel because the king of heaven had come down to dwell with this people above the cherubims praise god and so the king was there in the camp praise god with the ark of the covenant and so they had a shout about them they had a joy about them they had a rejoicing about them because god's presence is here and that's how we feel tonight god's presence is here praise god and so it makes us shout and it makes us happy he makes us weep and cry it makes us praise the lord because the king is amongst his subjects praise god amen amen just like when he come down through here you know we know the story uh but matthew 21 14 says on his way church the blind and the lame came to the temple and he healed them before he jumped on that that cult he was healing the blind and the mane and then he gets on the cult and then he comes in the verse 15 matthew 21 15 when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things he did and the children crying in the temple like monica right crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased see true praise will always upset the enemy we see but when we really praise god satan gets upset but god pours out his blessings upon us amen so no matter no matter the time no matter the situation the trial we must always praise god because he inhabits his praises and satan will he'll get discouraged you resist him through the praises praise god praise god that's resisting satan and pretty soon satan will flee praise god amen amen look at that sore displeased at these children saying hosanna hosanna save us and be saying hosanna that's what i thought was so inspired all those songs buddy uh see it's it's the true worship that god loves because in verse 16 jesus said here's thou these i'm sorry they said here's not what they say is and jesus said yay yes have you never read of course they had read it and he's rebuking that i've read this before uh have you had never have you read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou asked perfected praise so jesus corrects them and rebukes him said you should have read this this is that this is that scripture this is that fulfilled this day scriptures prevailed praise god now perfected means to repair or to strengthen or to complete praise amen in other words when you have children when you have that that sincere childlike worship it's complete praise it is the very definition of praise like that little monika like she just gets caught up in the atmosphere and she's smiling and first time here right she wasn't looking at my suit was she brother was she checking out say oh that unholy roller he he should have shined his shoes that's that's the children have perfect praise they they feel the friends of god they hear the songs of zion and they just start praising the lord that's perfect that's complete that's how god wants us all to be praise god that's childlike praise save us save us that's what holds it i mean save us save us so that the shout of the king in the camp and whatever that king is there's always a shout to praise god now brother graham uh in the church age book goes through this story of balak and balaam he said uh balak told balaam to go down the valley and look upon their back parts to see if there wasn't possibility some way he could curse them now listen the tactics that balak used are the same tactics they use today the big denominations look down upon the small groups and anything they find amongst them to make out a scandal they bring it out and shout it if the moderns live in sin no one says anything about it but let one of the elect get into trouble and every paper blasted across the country haven't you seen that on the internet you know in social media you let a christian uh fall into sin like did you see this week one of those mega church pastors in new york he got caught in adultery so he resigned and it was all over and everybody's mocking up he probably deserves he probably deserves some of that punishment right because he knew better but it was all over it was all over all the stations all the social media pages and that's what brother man is saying here that's that's the modern day balak right they want to find something something connected to christ and and reproach it and they just want to look down and make it look evil he says yes israel had her carnal parts they had their side that wasn't praiseworthy but in spite of their imperfections by the purpose of god that works through election by grace and not by works can you say amen to that they had the cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night they had the smitten rock the brazen serpent and the signs and wonders they were vindicated not in themselves but of god that's what i like when we went through those testimonies this summer everybody had these powerful testimonies and what was it it was god vindicating your life praise god because we know brother branham was vindicated he has a picture with the pillar of fire none of us have that as far as i know but he had that vindication but see our association with that we want to say we're following that same message we're following that same pillar of fire but still god has to vindicate our lives and that's the beauty of our testimony we overcome by what god is doing in our lives amen so we can just say just like israel we're following a prophet who had the pillar of fire praise god but he hasn't stopped he's still moving today hallelujah he's still with us today he's vindicating god is vindicating his people he's been dedicating us as real christians hallelujah goes now in the night i'm going back to 1954. he said balak failed to see that spitting rock that brat serpent making atonement for israel that's the matter tonight the people look down and say pentecost did this pentecost did that and they're this way in that way they fail to see the rock jesus christ going before there in the power of the resurrection of the holy ghost he said it's still the covenant people amen i know they talk about you and say well this preacher run off with this man's wife but over in their ranks they did the same thing he said don't tell me i come out of it i know they just got a lot of prestige to smother it down and you have to stand and bear it that's right can i say it like this the believe the sign people which are probably watching so god bless them tonight he's already made a long video about me and criticized some things i said but that's fine you all can do that you got a right to do that uh but when they talk i'll just say this with love when they talk about the message they make everybody the message sound the same well they'll say well this message preacher did this they had a child abuse so that's what all message churches are like right and so isn't that what's happening here that's what balak balak uh thought well look at israel now this is after israel built the golden calf i mean that was pretty awful isn't that downstream of the most i mean you can get your name removed from the book of life from for idolatry right but that's what bailiff was doing he said look they did this uh they complained about the quail they complained about the the bitter waters they complained about all these things they made the idol these people deserve curses but god said i can't curse them because i've given them my covenant praise god they have the promise of abraham praise god amen and so brother says they do the same thing today so when one message person falls this group that's against us they make everybody out like that but let me say it we're not all like that some of us are really justified amen amen some of us are really sanctified praise god some of us are really filled with the holy spirit praise god and our lives are pure our lives are clean our lives are sweet smelling savor unto god amen amen but they like to focus all together when they see one person fall they want to group all the message churches into that my brother man says listen he said don't let it bother you you have to stand and bear it amen that's fine i'll stand with brother adam anyway praise god amen no matter what people say about the message we'll stand with brother ram lie because he stood for christ amen amen hallelujah he stood for christ lord i said if you've got the holy ghost you're god's child your abraham seed you got an unconditional covenant written in your heart by god almighty himself who can't take it back well why because it's written on your soul how do you understand that the bible said the law in the new testament would be written upon the heart praise god it's written so it's written there and it can't be removed god can't undo it because it's a seal a writing unto the day of redemption he said amen he swore he wouldn't do it hallelujah but ram said you don't deserve your healing tonight there's not a one of us in here that deserves to even hear the gospel there's not a one of you deserves the grace of jesus christ none of us we're all all together but by god's grace he did it anyhow there's none of you deserve your healing every one of you ought to die me too all of us we're not deserved to live on the earth that's right we're not deserving to look at god's creation but god has promised us and he cannot lie he swore that he would do it healing belongs to us then amen salvation belongs to us the holy ghost belongs to us he said heaven belongs to us [Music] [Music] hallelujah he said heaven belongs to us now we're the sons of god now we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus there's nothing can harm us because we're blessed amen thank the lord that is beautiful church i'm just quoting god's prophet he said now look balaam and baylor come down here and curse the people he said it was the fundamentalist trying to curse the holy rollers he said he said you mean to tell me that israel was holy holy rollers he said yes they was brother the same kind of spear was on them that day is on what they call holy rollers today it's coming right up you say can you prove that yes sir when they crossed through the river down there the red sea and got on the other side moses got so in the spirit till he sang in the spirit and miriam jerked up the tambourine and went down the banks and danced and beat the tambourine and the daughters of israel fouled her beating tambourines and dancing if that ain't an old time holy roller meeting i've never seen one that the same spirit is in the church today that they call holy rollers so i say that they was holy rollers to the world praise god well let me just do that the way i just try to wake myself up and let's let's say we have the victory we need to take the tambourine and we would run around the church and praise the lord and say hallelujah that we have the victory it's the holy rollers church it's the holy rollers they were they were not from the fundamental group they had the [Music] come on up here okay let's give a round of the [Music] you're lord help me [Music] [Music] this is what they had the other group didn't have it they were half message believers i don't want to be a half message believer i want to be sold out 100 percent message believer amen with the shout of the king in the camp the bible said you could see it and hear it oh so you mean it wasn't a a silent reverent quiet uh quiet holy ghost it was loud they had the shout and the game praise god they were happy they were set free praise god um that's my vocal chords i didn't want to do that for tomorrow but anyway see the shout of the king my man said they had to shout and it started back there at the red seashore that's where it started this shot of the king this this happiness this joy this victory it started there yeah they had a lot of times they fell short but god still looked at the blood sacrifice and said that's my people you can't curse them that's my that that's my people that's my precious treasure praise god oh my i love that i think that's beautiful all right so let me be done there uh with that thought now if you got your bibles let's go to the next thought uh with let's look at to self-inflicted curses i mentioned this this morning with jezebel uh let's look at it let's look at another one first go to genesis 27 verse 12. you got your bibles there well i wish i regret wearing the sweater because it's kind of hot after dancing around here i was going to regret that genesis 27 12. now we'll read 12 and 13. now look these uh these uh founding fathers of the faith will say they knew if you did wrong things curses were to follow right now church we would say like this i think we've grown up in america we may not call it a curse we just may call it like consequences right that's what these people would call in school oh if you break the rules you're gonna have consequences well that's kind of what curses are right if they're temporary they're just consequences to bad decisions okay so verse 20 uh i'm sorry chapter 27 verse 12 my father her adventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver this is jacob and his mother rebecca and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing and his mother rebecca said unto him upon me thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them now here rebecca is asking for a self-inflicted curse is that something she cared so much about jacob getting the blessing and she liked him better with favoritism she said let your let the curse be on me now as far as i found isaac never cursed anyone even after really realizing he was deceived but we know the story right we know jacob went off and uh married rachel and leah and remember he had uh layman do a lot of bad things to him so you invent eventually you oh you're you are going to reap what you sow right but in this case rebecca thought she was going to get a curse and didn't you see sometimes just because we think we might be cursed or just because someone might say a curse that doesn't mean it's going to happen okay next scripture now here's what i was mentioning this morning first kings 19 1-2 with ahab and jezebel first kings 19 1-2 that's why i ain't scared brother bang if somebody curses me i don't have a fear at all i know where god brought me from i was in the depths of hell and dead and sin brother john i've been washing the blood brothers i was in the depths of sin you know i know what it's like to be in the grave and god brought me out of that grave praise god i came running out of that great there's a song about that we need to sing that sometime i came running out of that grave praise god you can't curse when god is blessed first kings 19 1 and ahab told jezebel look at him going back he's licking his womb darling all that elijah had done honey look what elijah did to me look what the preacher did to my prophets look at him he's like a little baby and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword that's what he did with name off right remember she's like why are you so sad why are you sitting there like a like a baby you're just like oh david wouldn't sell me as a land she's like let me let me let me let me do something about that all right she got that masculine spear verse two then jezebel sent a messenger to elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i not take thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time so she put herself under a curse by tomorrow this time if you're not dead let the gods kill me did she die that next day no she lived she outlived ahab so see even when sinners say curses it's not always going to take effect it's not always going to take event because a lot of people just say things right they don't even really they're just not really thinking what they're saying and did elijah get cursed he got raptured right now she tried to curse the man that's going to be raptured you can't curse but god is blessed amen and we're going to the rapture you can't curse us we're going up praise god we're getting the blessing oh think about that church and by god's grace we live to see it we'll escape all the curses of this earth the curse of the mark of the beast and god will take us up to glory amen hallelujah no matter what they try to curse us i'm gonna take your money i'm gonna lock down your bank account go ahead i've got heavenly treasures that you can't even know about i mean i'm trusting him but he promised me that praise god right what does that mean to me that's fine say whatever you want i know i'm a child of the king i am who i i am who god says i am praise god i know you i know i am i'm a child of god he's blessed me you see people can mutter anything they want let them mutter pray for them like jesus father forgive them proverbs 2 i'm sorry proverbs 18 21. this is up for mayor one but death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit of us you gotta love the life of god right we gotta love speaking god's word then you'll enjoy the blessings of it speak lives speak life speak speak the word speak the truth speak speak blessings praise god and then you'll see the benefits of it now also the opposite is true as well if you start talking hopelessness if you start talking to feet if you start talking there's nothing good for me then you're going to end up going that wrong direction you and i must physically and spiritually speak life right speak life speak this there's no weapon that's formed against me that shall prosper praise god i am more than a conqueror in christ jesus nothing can separate me from jesus's love bye what promises amen what a oh what a box of ammunition you got right here praise god hey what a sharp sword we have to weave at the enemy praise god and we'll enjoy the fruits of it if we can just speak it and believe it but ram said if we want a blessing he said be a blessing to someone else and a blessing will return he said like casting your breath first i feel so discouraged go do something nice it's going to return it will return to you that's the scripture cast your bread upon the water so bread is something it was daily sustenance right you had to have it to eat or to live rather you could eat anything else something it was a daily necessity cast your daily necessity your daily portion upon the waters in faith and it will return to you brother said to return buttered i don't know he said that's true in all walks of life you'll find that you usually reap just what you sow so let's do good talk good and be kind and people talk about us we'll say good things and kind things about them and good things will come our way if we'll give them out if there's that condition yeah like yesterday i was uh i was bragging on somebody who's really against me now i was bragging on them yesterday i said i baptized that person had such faith i baptized them in december in a late they had such faith now this person 18 now i think and says all kinds of evil things against me says i love satan now but yesterday i had a chance to say something nice about him because that's going to return to me sometimes somebody's going to say something really nice about me he's a real brother he's a real christian that's what i wanted to say praise god i want people to look at my life and say look at the faith that he's he's got faith with nature he's got faith with uh praying for the sicker he's got faith with preaching the gospel or being a witness or something like that how many want people to say nice things about them absolutely so i had a chance yesterday should i should i say something good about this person that curses me i said what i said i've baptized people with great faith that ties out water in 20 degree weather just saying nice things about people because it's it's a law whatever you reap i'm sorry whatever you sow that's what you're going to reap and that's like blessings and curses thank the lord but man says he says if people say well i'm weak my faith not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see satan's got a language doesn't he's got a dialect oh i'm weak i'm not very much i'm not a good christian he said you're just talking his language see you must never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i'm saying i have god in my heart i believe it with all my heart i believe in divine healing with all of my heart praise amen amen there's that law and that's a self-inflicted blessing or curse right because satan's trying to he's trying to make you doubt and say the negative well that would be a self-inflicted curse did you accept what he he's trying to whisper in your ear but instead you've got to take you got to do that i should say like it's the god-led blessing right the god-led blessed because god is leading you to say the right thing right now he says never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts don't entertain it well you say i can't help those thoughts from coming well that's like the farmer that said he can't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stoop them or stop them from roosting that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts but don't entertain them just pass it on say no sir jesus christ is my savior all things are mined by god i'm going to keep them i'm going to testify of them amen the man calls it reaping and sowing your words reaping and sowing in 1955 brother ram said god can only bless you as you confess what he's done for you he's the high priest of our confession is that right hebrews chapter 5. he said that he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us what as we accept it and believe it and confess it that's where bang helped me with that lying vanities he really helped me on that one i had to confess it it's a lie it's a lie it's a lie it's a lie and god eventually brought the healing so we we know god is he's a high priest of our confession we must confess the truth we must confess his promises if it's his will they'll follow through if it's his will praise god now here's another self-inflicted curse remember this one jesus was being crucified and pilate said i am innocent of the blood of this person see you do it and in matthew 27 25 then answered all the people and said his blood beat upon us and our children now that one was a real curse brother ben calls it the blood curse even all of history mel gibson that famously did the passion he recognized he got criticized because he called it the blood curse because he put it in the passion movie that was way back way back maybe 2006 or something i mean it's a self-inflicted curse they let they say let his blood be upon us and god has had to honor that because they wanted it on them and of course the holocaust they lost six million they've lost millions more because this blood curse self-inflicted curse now here's another one i don't know what happened afterwards because the bible doesn't say acts 23 14 remember that the bible said they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul now did they slay paul no so whatever curse they were under either they gave up on it and it wasn't inspired or they actually died from it i don't know what it was but see this is an example they try to use curses that you can't curse but god is blessed amen praise god paul was blessed he had a different testimony than to be slain by these men he had to go to rome and give his life as a testimony for christ there see another example just people can they can shout out whatever they want right that doesn't mean it's going to happen okay let's look at a few more then i'm going to bring it down to that i told you the close the scripture um okay authority figures sometimes did temporary curses in the bible so let's look at a few of those sometimes fathers uh curse children in the bible sometimes spiritual leaders uh cursed people but it only counts when it's prophetic or allowed for god's glory or as a form of punishment because no one can curse what god has blessed so here's the first one uh genesis nine oh twenty-four who said i were just talking about this this morning oh i forgot about that that was in my notes genesis 9 24 and noah awoke from his wide and knew what his younger son had done unto him he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall be shall he be unto his brethren and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be his servant now from the story it looks like ham walks into his father's tent after he got drunk showing he was the foolish virgin not like enoch who was raptured before and the bible said he was uncovered so mo so noah was uncovered his nakedness was bare right and so i don't know what ham did once he was in there but he went and told the brothers about it and then noah came to himself later and heard about it and then he curses it's interesting he doesn't curse ham he curses his son canaan he basically curses his grandson so i'm not sure why sometimes i think uh you know remember god is merciful remember god sometimes is merciful like with ahab god uh god god had the biggest curses on ahab's children and not on him okay they have to die a very awful death but that's what it looks like here it looks like noah was led by god not to curse ham but it went to his son canaan and again that have to be by four knowledge you say how could god curse the grandson well by god's poor now she can do it he must have known that canaan would have been just an ordinary unbelieving person that's that's the only way i could make sense to it right so see that ham and i'm sorry canaan was cursed to be servants but christians are blessed not to be servants to sin we're to be servants to righteousness praise god amen because he was cursed to be disturbed but we're blessed to be god's children praise god his servants amen go to genesis 27 22. we got somebody back there he's real good too where is that's what i'm saying genesis 27 22 they're all good i'm not good all right and jacob went here on to isaac's father and fell him and said the voice is jacob's voice but the hands are the hands of esau and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esau's hand so he blessed him now notice church he was deceived how many know isaac was deceived isaac thought he was blessing esau right he thought it was esau he honestly thought so he blesses him and does it go to esau no it goes to jacob right because jake because isaac was blessing jacob by god's leadership praise god god inspired isaac to say those words it wasn't isaac's thought it was god's thought praise god see that so even in someone's deception even in them not even understanding what they're doing they can be so filled with god's spirit to cause a blessing to come on somebody because it's really god's blessing and not the man's blessing praise god like church when i when i dedicated zion i could have said i'm going to bless you with 500 acres of land right i could have just from my my own mind right like my dedicated they owe me invest these children i can just thought from my own mind and try to do these blessings but that does it's not going to happen if it's a man's idea or man's blessing or a man's curse it's not going to happen it has to be led by the holy spirit praise god and so isaac he's totally to see what he's doing but it doesn't matter because god sees that jacob really wants the blessing jacob really wants the birth right you know esau is going to turn wayward and marry a heathen and uh the bible said he's a fornicator too i think he had two wives i'm not mistaken three olympia has been reading up there three wives the bible said he was a fornicator and he turned from the truth so see again it goes back to god's foreknowledge so god can bless you even when people don't even know what's going on praise god because god is the one who inspires it see blessings and curses must be in prophetic or inspired of god remember god's with the curse on the serpent god put the curse on me just like jezebel's attempted curse upon elijah wasn't of god didn't happen good good and curse what god is blessed here's another one now this one church actually came to pass uh genesis 31 32 so god was upset how many remember god was upset with rachel she stole her father's gods and she hit him you know in her uh her private area uh genesis 31 31-32 with jacob says this he's like why did you overtake me you searched everything and didn't find it and jacob said with whomsoever thou findest thy goods let him not live before our brethren discern that what is in thine i said what is thine with me and take it for jacob knew not the rachel's soul look at this again just like with isaac isaac didn't know who he was blessing in church look at this jacob didn't even know who he was cursing see it's all led by the spirit of god and the church said if god ever leads you to say something in his name it's going to happen whether it's a curse or whether it's a blessing jacob is cursing his own life but it's not really him it's god god is going to take this woman off the scene right after she has benjamin god takes a mother you know it was her it was her second son right joseph was the first one benjamin was the second one she has the baby and she dies because she was cursed for taking those idols and what a lesson that is right what unless that is for any bride right any woman don't take an idol into your bosom right don't take a high down to your life that's why john says my dearly beloved flee from idolatry he said my little children he said love one another he said don't take idols don't don't worship because this is a saved woman rachel is disabled the bible said she was going to build the house she built the house of israel like leah leah rachel they built build that all those they built the house of israel but yet she had a temporary curse because she took those gods and those idols so this is an example of a spiritual a husband figure cursing his wife but it wasn't by his leadership right it was god it was god because in genesis 35 um she dies verse 8 35-18 that came to pass as her soul was in departing where she died that she called his name benoni but his father called him benjamin and rachel died and was buried in the way wrath which is death so that's a serious thing there see jacob wasn't even aware what his wife had done but the holy spirit picked it up the holy spirit wasn't pleased with that woman taking those idols right so god took her off the scene right after benjamin was born that's what i was saying church uh authority figures sometimes uh speak temporary curses for blessings that was my 40 minutes so let me go to a couple more thoughts go to genesis 49 5-7 genesis 49 5-7 i'm not mistaken i believe this is jacob as well jacob is blessing his sons i want you to notice here notice he's not cursing his sons he's cursing their anger it's a really important thing to notice there he's not cursing simeon and levi he's cursing their anger look at verse 5 49 verse 5. simeon levi or brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations oh my soul will come not bow into their secret unto their assembly mine honor be not thou united or in their anger they slew a man and in their self will they dig down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel so here's a temporary curse right temporary he's got a scatter number and he curses their anger curse would be that anger let's see were there tribes punished absolutely there are consequences to decisions that we make the sons and the tribes were punished but later they must have got saved praise god because the sons reign on 12 thrones in heaven go to revelation 4 10. the gram tells us this revelation 4 10. so these are these brothers really battled anger anybody ever been there before anybody ever have a temper before yeah these these men battled anger so much that their father cursed it by the spirit of god the curse of the spirit of god curses that anger they're they're fighters warriors they're they're cruel men and jacob curses that evil attitude that they have somewhere along the road god forgive god forgives them they repent of their sins and they're forgiven because the four and 20 elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne they worship jesus program said see he said he says they were white robe the 20 and four elders there will be 20 and four elders there will be 12 of them for the 12 tribes of israel the 12 apostles for the church and they sat in the courts of the great king praise god amen man men that were so cruel and so angry god had to curse their anger in order that they might be chastened so they would repent and then here in heaven they rule and they sit in the court of heaven praise god ah that's a sort of redemption i want to be a part of praise god because there's parts about me church i don't like very much you hung around me hanging around me long enough you're gonna find some things i'm not perfect my children can tell you but please don't my wife can tell you i've got thoughts of myself i make mistakes but i'm trusting in the same grace that raised those boys up that brought them out of their human weaknesses and exalted them to heaven will be the same grace that exalts us to the right hand of christ as the bride of jesus christ amen amen glory they got to sit in the courts of the great king praise god because god had to chasten them and punish them and deal with their cruel hearts they're so angry and bitter violent god had to deal with their violence and burn it out of them through sanctification they couldn't get the holy ghost so god had to sanctify them and sanctify those bad habits out of them by his grace but then said remember they're sitting out there these are here's the bride in christ sitting on his throne his wife sat by the church he said there's the 24 elders and there's the 144 000 eunuchs of the temple ministering to him thank you jesus bye i don't know i don't know about you church but that's amazing grace to me cursed be their fierce anger fears who do you know that has fierce anger i can tell you a couple people i know they got fierce anger right i don't know a couple people that really got a lot of fears lust too you got a lot of fierce pride i know some of you guys got some real fear i know this people have real fierce bitterness but see our god specializes in redeeming his sons and daughters he specializes in that he's the only one that can do it praise god but if they're willing he will redeem them praise god he may allow them temporary curses brother amen for maybe years and decades and decades but his his ways are perfect praise god he's the potter they're the clay the potter knows how to fashion the claim praise god amen he knows how to break it down and build it up praise god that's what god did for cindy and levi let's go to this get your bibles let's go to uh ii kings 17 this is glorious church this is glorious i think it is i hope it's a blessing to you you know i've read the bible i think this is my third or fourth or fifth time i can't remember i'm almost done reading the bible a full way through it's the one i just gotta do i highlight it so i know when i got up all the way through second kings 17 verse 7. i appreciate everybody's patience thank you for your patience tonight i hope you're being blessed by the word of god in second king 17 it's this just amazing story it's just laid right in the middle of the chapter here i should say the middle to the end so we all know israel was taken out of the promised land right because we read it because of the curses god exiled them god deported them god allowed them to be carried away captive out of the land because of all the curses they allowed in their lives notice i said the curses they allowed right they wanted the curses they enjoyed sin for a season they remember church remember how many years they were in the promised land about 1500. look we've only been in this land about 200 30 or 40 years i think america is 240 years old so i'm like what's up with 1776 minus 1776 minus 2 i did it a couple of weeks really let me do that subtraction real quick just for my sake because i i know i did it last time what's 2020 minus 1776. oh 244. i know i thought it was 243. i was sitting right around there somewhere so think about that now look at that 1500 years and finally after the 1500 years finally they get kicked out of lane that's amazing grace that's amazing grace and they only had a few good kings in there like didn't have that many good kings josiah hezekiah you know david solomon asa was a good king we've only been here 244 years on this land but notice if you go to verse 7. for it was so that the children of israel had sinned against the lord their god which had brought them out of their land of egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and appeared under god and walked in the statues of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of israel which they had made and the children of israel did secretly now look here that's what i want to bring out here why did god kick them out because they did they were secretly sinning verse 9 and the children of israel did secretly those things that were not right against the lord their god and they built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fed cities and they set up them images and groves in every high hill and under every green tree and there they burn incense in all the high places as did they even whom the lord carried away from before them and rock wicked things to provoke the lord to anger for they served idols and the lord and said to them he shall not do this thing yet the lord testified against israel look at this how did god testify against them and against judah by all the prophets right when god wants to warn somebody what's he going to do send him a preacher praise god amen when god's going to warn his people about the curses and the blessings what's he do send him a holy ghost bill preacher praise god let him click on that servant about blessings and curses amen online how does god mourn his people through the prophets and by all the seers saying turn in how do they warn them turn from your wickedness repent leave those curses turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and statutes according to all the law which i commanded your fathers which i sent to you by my servants the prophets notwithstanding what they do they would not hear they harden their necks see church that's why let me say like this i've had people come in our church and they say i like how you cry at the end of the service and you know why they said that he said the one brother said he said because it's helping me to let down my guard he said i'm so hard-hearted i can't even cry for jesus i can't even be happy enough to cry for jesus he said i love how you cry at the end of service it's helping me to overcome my hard heart that was back to the other church and so i've always remember that and i've always said this and said god always let me have a soft sensitive heart to the holy spirit that people here see what they're saying stop being so hard-hearted he said turn from your sin see it's sin that makes people not want to worship god it's hard hearts how come people don't want to be happy as a christian and more the holy spirit learn more about god and serve god it's because they got hard hearts they turned from the right way and they gone the wrong way but when you have a soft heart towards god you can be taught god you can learn more about god and it changes your life it doesn't just make you smarter you're like a computer no it makes you love god more it impacts your daily life how does how the prophets turn people away or how the prophets warn them they say turn away from your evil ways keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which i commanded by your fathers which i said to you by my servants i always want to have a soft heart toward the holy spirit i always want to love worshiping him and praising i don't want a hard attitude towards god in verse 23 he warns them again until the lord removed israel out of the site as he had said by all his servants the prophets so was israel carried away out of their own land to assyria unto this day see he was warned by all his servants he kept saying preacher after preaching i hope god just does that but for us we'll receive it praise god those keep sending us preacher uh brother randy right brother nathaniel brother cam brother desperate bride you'll get upset us creature and not rebuke us but strengthen us praise god encourage us to walk in obedience walk in the blessings of god diligently hearken to the word of god now here's the here's the part i want to get to verse 24 and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from kuthath and from ava and from hameth and from sethurbane and placed them in the cities of samara instead of the children of israel and they possessed the samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof and so it was at the beginning of their dwellings there that they feared not the lord therefore the lord sent lions among them which slew some of them now catch this all of god's people brother amen except the very poorest israelites everybody else was carried away or slain and so the assyrian king's like hey i'll send in my babylonian god i'll send my i'll send my catholic church members in there i'll send my denominations in there and what happens they go in god's holy land and lions are eating them up because they don't fear god imagine that lion's chasing you down because you don't fear god they're probably calling on witches they were probably uh sacrificing their children all these things and so they say so they go to the king and say we don't know that in verse 26 we don't know the manner of the god of this land therefore he sent lions among them yeah so they go back to the king and said who is this god in this place he's sending lions to kill us verse 27 then the king of azir commands saying carry the other one of the priests whom now whom he brought from them to let him go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land now i want to because of time's sake go to verse 32. so he sends a jewish priest back to the land to teach these heathens how to fear god look at verse 32 and so they feared the lord and look at this and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places which sacrifice for them in the houses of the high places look at verse 33 they fear the lord and serve their own gods after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from deaths now what am i trying to say i'm trying to say this these people had a partial fear of god but not a whole fear of god but look what a partial fear of god did brother amen instead of getting slain by lions they feared god enough say well we won't do witchcraft and we won't kill our kids anymore so we'll fear god this far but we'll still practice idolatry on the side and you know what the scripture was brother of values i drove to church today i was thinking about this the scripture that came to me where paul said they will keep to themselves teachers having itching ears look the babylon or the assyrian god sends a teacher so they hear what they want to hear so they can escape the curses of god but then also enjoy the lust of the world doesn't that sound like the judas church have a form of godliness and deny the power thereof you can in your in your free time church i go to verse 41 in your free time read through there the lions stopped coming because they have a partial fear of god and i think brothers and sisters ever honest that's what's happened in a lot of messed circles they have enough fear of god not to do their big evil sins they won't murder they won't cuss they won't cut their hair they won't cross-dress but yet they enjoy sinful habits on the side and they think that they've avoided god's curses but if it's the same situation as this they're still assyrians they're not jews and so it is today just because people fear god enough to read their bible and not commit evil sins that doesn't mean their holy ghost feels saints it just means they have enough truth to fear god but on the side they want to continue living in sin look at verse 41 so these nations fear the lord and look at that can you believe that i was shocked i read that i didn't i highlighted that my bible with my highlighter and purple marker that's how shocking it was i hadn't thought about this before people and brother brahm said it you can have a partial hunger he said you've got a partial hunger for the holy ghost but not a full hunger see the brotherhood said you could have just enough religion he said to make you miserable they just enough religion so they uh they were miserable they couldn't do the things they wanted but then they could still enjoy a little pleasurable sins they want to kill their children or you know go to witchcraft and tarot cards but i still want to enjoy my netflix i still enjoy my cigarettes i still enjoy my pornography i still enjoy uh chasing after millions of dollars i hope that's powerful to you as it was to me i'm going to say tonight lord help me to have a full fear of the lord church it's scriptural you can have a partial hunger for god and you won't see curses in your life you won't see lions and you won't see your house being broke down honestly i don't want a partial fear of god i want a total fear of god i don't want to live with amen by some of the words that come out of the crowd of god how many will live by every word that we're seeing down here that's why musicians you can come by let's play that song the first song we choose the fear of the lord i hope that was a help to you church we don't want a
