[0:00] through my
[0:02] sickness darkness
[0:06] jesus you got me through
[0:10] my addiction
[0:13] depression
[0:17] [Music]
[0:25] i am grateful that you thought of me
[0:30] and if right where i am is right where
[0:34] you are then i'm right where i'm
[0:37] supposed to be
[0:40] god bless you and welcome to defending
[0:42] the message podcast we trust you are
[0:43] doing well by the grace of god
[0:45] i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith and
[0:47] here's our other co-host i'm amen
[0:50] today we're recording part two of austin
[0:52] laramie's testimony so hope you enjoyed
[0:54] part one
[0:55] before we get into the bulk of the
[0:57] podcast i again want to give a warning
[0:59] that this episode has a lot of mature
[1:01] content in it we do not recommend
[1:04] children listen to it
[1:05] god has rescued our brother austin from
[1:07] a life wholly given over to drug abuse
[1:11] so in this podcast you'll hear different
[1:13] drugs mentioned such as marijuana or
[1:16] weed
[1:16] xanax
[1:18] meth fentanyl
[1:20] and beer or alcohol
[1:22] our brother also got into reading a
[1:23] lester crowley and studied the occult he
[1:26] got a lot of tattoos and tried to commit
[1:29] suicide on numerous occasions
[1:31] of course as a church we do not support
[1:33] any drug abuse tattoos violence or any
[1:36] involvement with the occult but we again
[1:39] felt it was an important part of
[1:40] austin's testimony as god's hand reached
[1:43] down and rescued him from himself
[1:46] we felt certain details from his
[1:48] testimony might help those trapped in
[1:50] drug abuse it might give hope to those
[1:52] in drug abuse or give hope to the
[1:53] families who have loved ones in drug
[1:55] abuse
[1:56] and encourage them to keep praying for
[1:58] the deliverance of their loved ones
[2:00] whether they're battling drug abuse the
[2:01] occult or suicide
[2:03] as i was listening to austin's testimony
[2:05] i had remembered how brother branham had
[2:07] tried to commit suicide on a couple
[2:09] occasions
[2:10] and i saw a parallel between brother
[2:12] austin and brother branham's life in the
[2:14] sense that god saved both of their lives
[2:17] of course they were in different
[2:18] positions when they battled suicidal
[2:20] thoughts but in both cases god was
[2:22] gracious and saved them from themselves
[2:25] so i will insert brother bram's quotes
[2:27] in specific places right after austin
[2:30] talks about his battles with suicidal
[2:32] thoughts
[2:33] i'll also play another brother branham
[2:35] quote where he talked about having knife
[2:36] fights
[2:37] as brother austin had a knife fight as
[2:39] part of his testimony when he was almost
[2:41] at his breaking point and in this
[2:43] brother branham quote he talked about
[2:45] how he wanted to go shoot four or five
[2:47] boys that were beating him up when he
[2:48] was around the age of 12 and yet god
[2:51] spared him from being a murderer
[2:53] so we're sharing these testimonies from
[2:54] brother branham and brother austin to
[2:56] magnify the grace of our lord jesus
[2:58] christ who is mighty to save who saves
[3:01] to the utmost and who is rich in mercy
[3:04] we also hope you'll listen all the way
[3:05] to the end and you'll hear austin sing a
[3:07] song about this particular aspect of his
[3:09] testimony the lord gave him a song
[3:12] called right where i'm supposed to be
[3:14] and in the song austin talks about
[3:16] overcoming depression and suicidal
[3:18] thoughts and the song magnifies the
[3:20] grace of our lord jesus christ to rescue
[3:22] him save his soul and lead him into
[3:24] paths of righteousness for god's name's
[3:26] sake you heard a small portion of this
[3:28] song at the beginning of the podcast as
[3:30] well and with that we'll get started
[3:38] so brother last time we ended with the
[3:39] story of how
[3:40] your friend named benjamin was really
[3:42] gracious to you and you were homeless at
[3:44] the time
[3:45] and
[3:46] he started talking to you about god even
[3:48] opened up his home
[3:50] and allowed you to stay there and you
[3:51] were skeptical at first as
[3:53] anybody would be
[3:55] but then god started dealing with you
[3:56] and we met and that was a wonderful
[3:58] moment i still remember that moment by
[4:00] god's grace
[4:01] and so maybe you can start right there
[4:03] and start telling us how god started
[4:05] softening your heart
[4:06] and then how you uh reacted to the
[4:09] message and we could pick up right there
[4:12] yeah so we'll start off yeah i met
[4:15] i met you brother jesse and then
[4:17] like i said
[4:19] i had the thought i was like if there's
[4:21] anybody that i've ever met in my life
[4:23] that has a relationship with god or as
[4:25] close to god as this guy so off the bat
[4:29] i said something different about pastor
[4:31] jesse you know so
[4:32] you know so i started going to church
[4:34] you know i started going to this message
[4:37] and really believing it too i mean i
[4:38] would out i had a lot of doubts so my
[4:40] mom was telling me i was in a cult my
[4:42] friends were actually i didn't even
[4:43] really talk to any of my friends i went
[4:44] ghost on everybody but
[4:46] but uh
[4:47] because my mom thought i was a cult you
[4:49] know and i i i didn't know whether to
[4:52] believe it everybody was so sincere i
[4:54] felt a massive amount of love in this
[4:55] church but
[4:57] then again there's always that doubt
[4:58] like oh maybe it's just a cult because i
[5:00] never you know i went to church before
[5:01] and i never experienced anything like
[5:03] this or heard the things that would
[5:05] teach so
[5:06] it was like way different but eventually
[5:09] through all the questions i have for
[5:10] brother jess he was super patient with
[5:11] me i was straight telling him i didn't
[5:13] believe him and stuff and he would show
[5:14] me everywhere in the bible he would
[5:15] always bring it back to the bible which
[5:17] i you know proved it to me so after a
[5:20] while i eventually accepted we had a
[5:21] prophet that lived in modern times and i
[5:24] just missed it and
[5:26] and yeah i just started believing in the
[5:28] message so through that belief
[5:30] and through my little prayer in the
[5:32] parking deck for god to reveal himself
[5:34] that was my prayer to be an answer so i
[5:36] started believing it accepting it
[5:39] and i really started to change you know
[5:40] i saw my life start to get better i was
[5:43] still dealing with the massive amount of
[5:44] depression anxiety but god really
[5:47] started blessing my life because i
[5:48] really started taking it serious you
[5:50] know so i started doing things i never
[5:52] did before like praying you know i
[5:54] started praying i started obeying the
[5:57] word of god you know i started i stopped
[6:00] cussing for a while
[6:01] i remember one day i had a migraine real
[6:04] bad in my room and i wanted to go to
[6:06] church but i was just my head hurt so
[6:08] bad and i literally got down and i was
[6:11] like alright god i was like lord i was
[6:13] like i did a vow with god and i was like
[6:15] god if you take my migraine away right
[6:17] now i was like
[6:19] i will literally throw these pack of
[6:20] cigarettes away and i'll stop smoking
[6:22] and i just stopped you know as soon as i
[6:24] was done praying my migraine literally
[6:26] like just instantly left like and i
[6:28] never have had that experience like when
[6:29] i get a migraine i gotta go to sleep all
[6:31] day i'm throwing up it's terrible so my
[6:34] migraine left completely 100 and i
[6:36] literally shot up took those cigarettes
[6:38] man i threw them in the toilet and i
[6:40] just flushed them i was like all right
[6:42] so be it i was like praise the lord i'm
[6:44] going to church today
[6:45] so
[6:46] i've never seen you know so supernatural
[6:48] things were happening left and right i
[6:50] mean left and right i mean brother jesse
[6:52] he uh he helped me
[6:54] a lot i've never had such a
[6:57] uh great help from a church before
[6:58] everybody in my old churches were super
[7:01] standoffish you know real judgmental
[7:04] not really loving you know i mean
[7:05] brother jesse
[7:06] helped me get a job he let me work at
[7:08] his house a lot when i didn't have money
[7:10] to pay bills you know he invited me over
[7:13] knowing how sinful i used to be would
[7:15] still let me just fellowship with him at
[7:17] his house eat with them it was great so
[7:20] i really started believing it i just
[7:22] really started to see my life change for
[7:24] the better i mean supernatural things
[7:26] still dealing with depression though i
[7:28] didn't have a revelation of how real god
[7:30] was so i didn't i believe that he can
[7:32] cure depression and anxiety you know but
[7:34] it wasn't real to me yet and it wasn't
[7:36] real that he worked that way so i still
[7:38] accepted sickness cancer like oh if you
[7:40] get it you know that's how it is because
[7:42] that's science proves that you know i
[7:44] was a science and medical guy you know i
[7:46] was like oh you know science tops
[7:49] religion you know because it's science
[7:51] so it's true you know i didn't have the
[7:53] revelation yet that god really works in
[7:55] that way that he really hears everything
[7:57] so
[7:58] my depression i saw it almost 100 go
[8:01] away but my mom was with this new guy
[8:03] and he was like really
[8:05] abusive just like my stepdad so that was
[8:07] always getting to me that was like my
[8:08] downfall
[8:09] it was really all good though for like a
[8:11] year and a half for real like just it
[8:13] was all positive uphill
[8:15] it was great
[8:16] i was really blessed uh by austin a
[8:18] number ways you know it was neat to see
[8:21] a person come in right from the world
[8:24] and then just believe the word of god
[8:26] because austin would sit there he'd sit
[8:28] through every service he was at every
[8:30] service i mean we rarely see people come
[8:32] in that will come to every service
[8:35] and be devoted and
[8:37] you woke up i mean brother you hardly
[8:38] miss any services so i was just
[8:40] overwhelmed by your
[8:42] love for god your
[8:44] submission to god your obedience to
[8:46] god's word do you remember when you got
[8:48] that job at the clothing store and as
[8:50] soon as you started tithing i mean they
[8:52] you were blessed i mean god started
[8:54] increasing your hours and it was just it
[8:56] was so beautiful like i just thank god
[8:58] that god gave you a word and i told you
[9:00] brother if you if you tithe god will
[9:01] bless you and then you literally saw god
[9:04] do the you know do that for you god he
[9:06] blessed you increased your hours he made
[9:08] you a manager there or something like it
[9:10] was manager on the fourth day on the
[9:12] fourth day
[9:13] i mean how many people become a manager
[9:14] on the fourth day at any job you know
[9:17] uh it was just
[9:18] really special to see god working your
[9:20] life and then from a father's
[9:22] perspective i want to say this too for
[9:23] our listeners on the podcast
[9:25] austin at that time you'd have been what
[9:27] 20 or 19 19 19.
[9:29] okay so i'm a pastor right at that time
[9:31] i would have been 36. after church you
[9:34] know we had more people at our church at
[9:35] that time and
[9:37] a lot of people went up wanted to come
[9:39] up and talk to me like we had people
[9:40] from pennsylvania and then other people
[9:42] from out of town
[9:43] and they always wanted to make sure they
[9:45] talked to me
[9:46] so my children i never got to play with
[9:47] my children
[9:49] so who would play with my children
[9:50] brother austin would pay with faith my
[9:52] children brother amen
[9:53] it's like god brought austin in and made
[9:55] him a real good example to my children
[9:57] and he became
[9:59] a brother figure you know to my children
[10:01] especially young malachi
[10:04] and brother i just want to tell you that
[10:05] you know that i saw god fill that void
[10:08] because i couldn't spend the time with
[10:09] my kids brother you would run around
[10:10] with them
[10:11] chase them you'd laugh with them you
[10:14] just
[10:14] you treated them like an older brother
[10:17] right you know you ride in the back of
[10:18] our van you know we go out to eat every
[10:20] night get pizza every sunday night you
[10:21] know you just instantly became a part of
[10:23] our family and just from a father's
[10:25] perspective for me i just want to let
[10:27] you know how much of a blessing that was
[10:30] as a pastor as well because i saw you
[10:31] obeying the word of god but then
[10:33] secondly as a father i saw you become
[10:36] just like a sibling in our family it's
[10:38] like my family grew
[10:40] and now my my son had an older brother
[10:42] that's kind of what it felt like to me
[10:43] thank you brother yeah means lot amen
[10:46] meant a lot to have you buddy by god's
[10:47] grace
[10:53] do you want to move on like anything
[10:54] else you want to share before you left
[10:56] you want to start getting into how you
[10:57] left
[10:58] yeah um
[10:59] so yeah i was probably
[11:01] here i probably stayed for about a year
[11:03] and a half
[11:04] like almost every service like you said
[11:06] and uh
[11:07] everything was going good but i started
[11:09] you know realizing i was pretty stagnant
[11:12] you know i had a lot of
[11:13] i got to a point where i wasn't growing
[11:15] anymore and it was just i was just
[11:17] stagnant and it felt like i was just
[11:18] going but i wasn't you know improving in
[11:21] my spiritual walk
[11:22] i still had you know sin in my life and
[11:25] it got to a point to where
[11:27] i was still struggling musically i
[11:29] didn't really believe in myself fully
[11:31] yet but i knew i had a gift and i
[11:33] started getting to the point to where
[11:35] my music desire i really still wanted to
[11:37] be that big shot in hollywood you know i
[11:40] wanted to i really believed that i had a
[11:41] chance to become famous you know rich
[11:44] off of music i i still had worldly
[11:46] desires like i wanted to be rich you
[11:48] know i wanted
[11:49] you know to to be famous i wanted to
[11:52] basically get back at all the people
[11:53] that did me wrong in my life you know
[11:55] by just
[11:56] being rich you know and just being that
[11:58] guy in the world
[12:00] at that time i still didn't really like
[12:02] gospel music you know i i didn't like it
[12:04] or how it sounded really so i just i
[12:06] liked my worldly music still
[12:08] and i wanted to make worldly my own
[12:10] music you know i wanted to make whatever
[12:12] i wanted to make you know so i i i
[12:14] didn't want to do gospel music
[12:17] and it was and i got to a point to where
[12:19] i would try to just write it you know
[12:21] nothing will work and i'll be so
[12:24] frustrated in my house or at home
[12:27] and i would just literally just almost
[12:28] get mad at god like i started getting to
[12:31] a point where i was
[12:32] almost
[12:33] angry with god because i had to give up
[12:36] all the things that i loved you know
[12:38] like i was giving up a lot of things but
[12:40] i didn't give up everything like and
[12:41] music was the thing i couldn't give up i
[12:44] i was i was angry i got to a point where
[12:46] i got real angry
[12:48] and then i remember
[12:49] uh pastor jesse saying in a sermon about
[12:52] how
[12:53] sin in the church if one person is still
[12:56] sinning it can hinder the whole church
[12:57] and i remember
[12:59] at that around that time the church was
[13:01] going through a lot of financial
[13:03] struggles and a lot of problems in the
[13:05] church
[13:06] which with hindsight wasn't even related
[13:08] to me but that's another story but um i
[13:11] i felt like it was me
[13:13] because i was i was still leaving church
[13:15] sinning doing my own music you know i
[13:17] would still i started smoking uh weed
[13:20] again you know i started falling back
[13:23] my mom with that with with the guy that
[13:26] was getting to me too you know because
[13:29] it was just like a bad situation so i
[13:31] started letting the worldly worries back
[13:32] in i was still young too i'm 19. just
[13:35] got out of high school so i still had
[13:36] the whole world you know to explore i
[13:39] haven't even experienced anything in
[13:40] adult life really so i was still young
[13:42] and ambitious
[13:44] and and then one day i came to church
[13:46] and i remember sister naomi was speaking
[13:48] in tongues and that's never happened
[13:50] before so i immediately i felt guilty i
[13:53] was like oh that's about me like god's
[13:55] about to expose me right in front of
[13:56] everybody i'm like oh this is it
[13:58] you know i was like i gotta get i gotta
[14:00] get out of here i gotta leave this
[14:01] church man
[14:02] and really
[14:04] that was the reason too but it was also
[14:06] because i was mad at god and i wanted to
[14:08] do my own music and make it i feel like
[14:10] i was wasting my talent by doing gospel
[14:12] music because to me i didn't really like
[14:14] it at the time so and i didn't see it as
[14:16] a way to actually help others
[14:18] you know i didn't see my god making
[14:20] gospel as a way to heal people or
[14:22] anything so
[14:24] i was looking at it more of a selfish
[14:26] reason
[14:26] but i wanted to be rich
[14:28] to help the people that i loved though
[14:31] so but it was more i just wanted to be
[14:33] famous too so i eventually left i
[14:34] remember the day i left like brother
[14:36] jesse
[14:37] he bought me a car around this time too
[14:39] my first car bought me my car it was a
[14:41] nissan sentra i got my license
[14:44] and literally the day i got my license
[14:46] is the day i left the church and i
[14:48] remember literally i got my car i went
[14:50] home and then the the next sunday came
[14:53] up
[14:53] and instead of going to church i went
[14:55] and met up with my friend kwame in akron
[14:57] i was living in canton at the time and i
[14:59] just didn't go to church and and then
[15:01] after that day
[15:03] i stopped talking to everybody like i
[15:05] never responded to no text nothing i
[15:07] didn't ever go back
[15:09] and i remember i remember the day i
[15:11] didn't go to church i literally said to
[15:13] myself i was like
[15:15] my god is literally gonna tear up or let
[15:18] the devil tear up my life until i come
[15:20] back my life is gonna go into a downhill
[15:22] spiral i literally said it so maybe i
[15:24] manifested that by speaking it or it was
[15:27] uh it became it was true though but yeah
[15:29] so i said that on the day i left and and
[15:31] it really happened so this is where like
[15:34] i thought my life was bad growing up
[15:36] before i met the message it was it
[15:37] turned into complete chaos i'll tell you
[15:39] it was terrible so
[15:41] i left the i left the message and really
[15:43] started going through my real trials man
[15:45] so yeah that reminds me of proverbs 13
[15:47] 15. good understanding giveth favor but
[15:50] the way of transgressors is hard
[15:53] so god had been gracious to you and you
[15:55] started struggling and not growing
[15:59] and then you chose the way of
[16:00] transgression and now you'll probably
[16:01] tell us and proceed to tell us how life
[16:03] became even harder than it was before
[16:05] you come to to know about god boy
[16:08] yeah and that and that actually shows
[16:10] god's grace it reminds us of first
[16:11] corinthians where the bible says you
[16:13] know churches could now we didn't do
[16:15] this but churches can turn disobedient
[16:17] ones over to satan for the destruction
[16:19] of their bodies that their souls might
[16:21] be saved
[16:22] but i never felt led to do that with you
[16:24] all right i never felt like you
[16:26] transgressed against us and failed to
[16:29] repent plus we didn't do the three we
[16:30] never did the three-step process like
[16:31] jesus talks about you know we couldn't
[16:33] even you wouldn't text us back right so
[16:35] we couldn't have any conversations
[16:37] one thing i would add too when i bought
[16:39] you that car
[16:40] um it was a joy to do that
[16:42] for a year and a half brother you had we
[16:45] picked you up for church
[16:47] and uh you never missed a service i
[16:49] don't think you missed one service maybe
[16:50] two maybe one or two you know but
[16:52] you made almost every service and you
[16:55] had worked you paid ties offerings you
[16:57] done everything right and i felt led the
[16:59] lord to buy that car for you the reason
[17:02] i say that is because somebody in the
[17:03] church they're not here anymore but
[17:05] somebody criticized me for that and they
[17:07] said see it was a waste and they kind of
[17:09] made a sound like well austin he never
[17:11] believed in the first place and i said
[17:12] no i said brother i don't agree with
[17:14] that
[17:15] i said i knew
[17:16] austin i said i spent time with austin
[17:19] we prayed together we spent a lot of
[17:20] time together i said i don't know what
[17:22] happened but i said i don't regret it
[17:23] this will come into another part later
[17:25] in the story when we saw you before you
[17:26] moved out to arizona
[17:28] i just want to let the listeners know
[17:30] that when we give to others it's always
[17:32] like giving to the lord right we'll
[17:34] never regret giving because giving is
[17:36] manifesting eternal life right amen
[17:45] so what happened on the day that you
[17:47] left the message because you went a
[17:48] little bit over it
[17:50] about how you met your uh your old
[17:51] friend so you want to go into detail
[17:53] before you move to arizona
[17:55] yeah
[17:56] yeah so uh upon leaving a message mind
[17:59] you the back of my head the whole time
[18:01] while i went through all these things
[18:02] and i left a message for about it was
[18:04] total probably five six years i was i
[18:06] left so
[18:08] but back in my head the whole time while
[18:10] i went through these things i'm about to
[18:11] explain briefly is
[18:13] that like
[18:14] i believed everything i felt guilty for
[18:16] leaving you know like i literally felt
[18:18] so bad for leaving i felt like i let
[18:20] everybody down i really missed everybody
[18:22] in the back of my mind but i knew god
[18:25] god's power was so strong that if i were
[18:27] to text anybody or try to come back
[18:29] i would just be playing
[18:31] spiritual warfare you know just so i
[18:32] just wanted to do it my way and not have
[18:35] anybody in my ear telling me like just
[18:38] to you know they forgive me that you
[18:40] know i didn't want to hear none of that
[18:40] i just want to do it my way so i left
[18:43] the church and
[18:44] around that time i was living
[18:47] at
[18:48] my own house
[18:50] that brother jesse helped me get
[18:52] actually
[18:53] right next door to my mom's house on
[18:54] esther avenue actually i remember it and
[18:57] uh i remember times were getting pretty
[18:59] bad you know my mom was just in another
[19:00] abusive relationship and stuff so that
[19:02] was messing with me and then but
[19:04] eventually i i moved out of that house
[19:07] and
[19:08] i think i moved back in with my mom and
[19:10] her boyfriend again
[19:12] or i was living with them and i remember
[19:14] i was working at the speedway around the
[19:16] corner
[19:17] and
[19:17] one night they had a bad argument and i
[19:20] like went off on the guy and he
[19:21] basically kicked me out
[19:23] and i bit and i quit that speedway job
[19:25] so i left and i was i was back homeless
[19:27] again
[19:28] and these times were real
[19:30] i wasn't really on drugs yet but i was i
[19:31] barely remember these times these are
[19:33] like the very beginning of the hard
[19:35] times
[19:36] i got home i was homeless again and i
[19:38] was back in akron
[19:40] and
[19:41] i was living in my car
[19:44] and i remember i had i was still playing
[19:45] guitar doing music you know just writing
[19:47] my own songs
[19:49] and i remember getting really close to
[19:50] my friend kwame and we just started
[19:53] selling a lot of weed
[19:55] doing scams oh yeah i was i was i was
[19:57] living i was breaking into abandoned
[19:59] houses living in them you know just kind
[20:01] of being a young hard-headed guy in the
[20:04] streets
[20:05] and i was just living
[20:06] how i wanted to for i completely
[20:09] went back on everything i all the
[20:11] progress i made on god you know i
[20:12] started smoking cigarettes again i
[20:14] started smoking weed
[20:16] and that kind of was like that for a
[20:18] while you know i was stable then though
[20:20] i got another job
[20:22] i was kind of stable
[20:24] for like a year after i left the church
[20:26] and then we get to like year number two
[20:29] after i left and and now you know i
[20:32] i was homeless again
[20:34] and i found an apartment
[20:36] i got a bunch of cash together and i
[20:38] basically told the landlord i would pay
[20:40] six months in advance just to let me
[20:41] move in that day
[20:43] because my credit was terrible and it
[20:45] worked he let me get it so it was like a
[20:46] three bedroom apartment in west side
[20:48] akron
[20:49] and i called my friend kwame that was
[20:51] working at the same place as me and i
[20:52] was like hey man let's move in
[20:54] so he moved in with me and that's when
[20:57] everything really started happening you
[20:58] know after after i was not homeless
[21:01] anymore everything was cool we had a lot
[21:03] of money you know i was starting to get
[21:05] a little
[21:06] audience and akron because i would do
[21:07] like
[21:09] shows and akron competitions music
[21:11] competitions i would win in first place
[21:13] and it started to work you know so
[21:16] that's when i kind of was on defense
[21:18] mode and hustle mode when i was homeless
[21:20] so i was putting my feelings on the back
[21:22] end but once i got the house and all the
[21:24] money came in that's when i started to
[21:25] feel everything again
[21:27] and depression hit like no other like i
[21:29] never felt this depressed in my life and
[21:31] then i started getting in into drugs
[21:33] heavy i started using music as an excuse
[21:36] to do drugs like be like i was like i'm
[21:39] a rock star you know i'm
[21:41] i'm when i when i get high i can write
[21:43] songs better and it gives me the ability
[21:45] to go on stage and win competitions you
[21:48] know and
[21:48] so i but really i was just depressed
[21:51] and i was just telling myself that
[21:52] because i was believing a lie and the
[21:55] whole time in the back of my head i was
[21:56] like i'm living a life you know i
[21:58] believe i still believed everything in
[21:59] the church so i knew i was living wrong
[22:01] and that i was going to hell and that
[22:02] none of this mattered so that was also
[22:04] my biggest anxiety and depression
[22:05] because i was like at any moment if i
[22:07] die i know i'm going to hell straight up
[22:09] and
[22:10] i mean i didn't know but i assumed and
[22:13] uh
[22:14] so i thought you know that was weighing
[22:15] on me heavy no matter what i did it felt
[22:17] like i couldn't win and it felt like i
[22:19] was working against god like
[22:20] supernatural things would happen that
[22:22] was just not work nothing was working in
[22:24] my favor
[22:25] like i was not happy or not at all and
[22:27] it just kept getting worse and worse
[22:28] progressively but i wanted to do the
[22:30] music so bad so i remember this is like
[22:33] maybe four months into me doing drugs
[22:36] heavy now i mean i got into xanax so bad
[22:39] i was blacking out i couldn't even
[22:41] remember days i would lose like
[22:42] thousands of dollars at once like one
[22:44] time i remember i lost like four
[22:46] thousand dollars at the mall it just
[22:47] fell out of my pocket like i just lost
[22:49] like three thousand dollars here that it
[22:51] was terrible i would just lose money
[22:54] we'd have massive house parties you know
[22:56] people would steal stuff from our house
[22:58] and i didn't know because i would be out
[22:59] of it and uh i started really wanting it
[23:02] so bad to be famous
[23:04] but in the back of my head i'm like if i
[23:06] go to hollywood i'm going to hell you
[23:07] know it was it was like a
[23:09] i don't really know what i was thinking
[23:10] because i knew it wasn't for anything i
[23:12] was like i believed god was real and
[23:14] that everything was the truth so i knew
[23:15] i was working against god and still
[23:17] there was some force in me that was like
[23:19] i gotta get to hollywood i thought that
[23:21] i would get it to hollywood my way get
[23:23] rich my way and then once i'm
[23:25] established then repent and go to gospel
[23:28] and teach my
[23:29] i had my own you know god was laughing
[23:31] at me so
[23:32] it got worse i started getting more and
[23:34] more depressed my i started ignoring my
[23:36] mom i started really resenting my mom at
[23:38] this point and not really talking to her
[23:39] much and then uh so i just kind of left
[23:42] her to deal with that guy on her own you
[23:44] know
[23:45] and i was just i started treating all my
[23:47] friends bad and my drug fueled rages
[23:49] like
[23:50] the people that really cared about me i
[23:52] would be so cruel to them
[23:53] i remember
[23:54] i i was in the basement for some reason
[23:57] really high
[23:58] downstairs and we found this old antique
[24:00] mirror behind a wall in my basement for
[24:02] summer it was weird it was like i had a
[24:04] pole to this mirror
[24:06] and my friend kwame was like oh that's
[24:08] it's it's it's a haunted mirror just
[24:10] making a joke but i was like no i really
[24:12] feel the pool so i remember one night i
[24:14] started studying a lester crowley which
[24:17] is like the most famous satanist
[24:20] one day i just started getting songs
[24:22] flowing i would do drugs and then like
[24:24] songs would feel like they would come
[24:26] from a different realm and they would
[24:27] just they would flow out of me i'll just
[24:29] take my pen and it's almost like my pen
[24:31] would just write music itself and i'll
[24:32] write these crazy lyrics
[24:35] and then i would i would go and i'll go
[24:37] perform it at different competitions
[24:39] around akron and i'll win first place
[24:41] every time and i was winning cash prizes
[24:42] like five hundred thousand dollars two
[24:44] thousand dollars all the time and i was
[24:46] like oh it's really working so i started
[24:48] doing it more
[24:50] and
[24:51] started selling a lot of drugs and
[24:52] basically
[24:53] it became to the point to where i was
[24:56] buying drugs
[24:57] and not selling them anymore i was just
[24:59] doing them all and i was just doing it
[25:00] so much and it just got to the point to
[25:02] where everything fell apart and i
[25:04] remember just a couple crazy instances
[25:06] like one time i crashed my car into a
[25:09] mcdonald's
[25:10] and i didn't see it at the time but god
[25:12] was protecting me through all of this
[25:14] but yet
[25:15] i did all i remember
[25:16] is just seeing flames and firemen
[25:19] pulling me out
[25:21] and
[25:22] i i woke up the next morning at home i
[25:24] wasn't in jail
[25:26] i didn't get charged with anything no
[25:28] ticket i didn't get in trouble at all i
[25:30] just woke up the next morning and i was
[25:32] like guys i'm gonna go drive to the
[25:33] store get something to drink you guys
[25:34] want something and everybody just
[25:35] started yelling at me they're like with
[25:36] what car dude they told me to look
[25:39] outside
[25:40] and the fire hydrant in front of our
[25:41] house was gone there's a whole bunch of
[25:43] black marks in the street and then they
[25:45] were like bro you crashed into
[25:46] mcdonald's so i went you know and there
[25:48] was stuff in mcdonald's going on i was
[25:50] like how am i not in jail or the police
[25:52] and they're like i don't know you just
[25:54] came walking home last night and you
[25:55] were like
[25:56] you said you didn't know where your car
[25:57] was and i was like i don't know
[25:59] so that's one instant that god protected
[26:01] me uh i remember one time i got so fed
[26:05] up i was just trying to kill myself so i
[26:06] got a whole bunch of ecstasy pills
[26:09] and i took like
[26:10] at work
[26:11] i was taking them all day while i was
[26:13] working at marco's pizza
[26:14] all day long and then and i was making a
[26:17] pizza delivery and i remember
[26:19] right when i got to the guy's house i
[26:21] just remember feeling super dizzy gave
[26:23] him his pizza apologized and then i just
[26:26] drove home didn't even go to work i just
[26:27] drove straight home because i was like
[26:28] oh it was happening but nothing happened
[26:31] realized it was meth it was meth in
[26:33] those ecstasy pillows though so i should
[26:35] have definitely been dead taking that
[26:37] many pills at once
[26:38] but all that happened was just i was
[26:41] just up for 84 hours i remember counting
[26:43] i was up for 84 hours straight but i was
[26:45] just like in my head like what is what
[26:47] is going on why can't i die
[26:49] she said billy
[26:50] promise me you won't worry about me
[26:52] insurance i just about i had a pistol in
[26:54] my hand a few minutes before i snapped
[26:56] it all the way around trying to commit
[26:57] suicide the same day i tried to lay my
[26:59] hand on a 33 000 volt line when i was
[27:01] working as a electrician you know my
[27:04] story and the first thing you know i was
[27:05] on the ground sitting there sweating not
[27:07] knowing what happened had been god
[27:09] reserving this ministry for you people i
[27:12] went right then
[27:14] no matter how much we cry out and think
[27:17] this that other nothing can
[27:23] [Music]
[27:26] sometimes you feel like
[27:28] as i did one time put a pistol against
[27:30] my head to commit suicide
[27:32] but i couldn't do it
[27:34] i took my glove off the lead on a high
[27:36] voltage line where i was working but i
[27:39] couldn't do it
[27:41] something still helped
[27:43] the same god that was with elijah
[27:47] that same god today
[27:50] you see me under the judiciary tree my
[27:52] wife and baby there you are in the grave
[27:54] and my daddy and my brother and all i
[27:56] was about to call myself
[28:01] up later to the juniper tree
[28:03] it's hard
[28:06] i got to a place i saw beside myself
[28:09] i tried to make a gun shoot my brains
[28:11] out and it wouldn't do it
[28:14] see there's work yet to be done
[28:18] something has to be done god wasn't
[28:21] finished
[28:24] he'll always take care of you
[28:28] you know i would take my i brought a i
[28:30] bought a new glock
[28:32] i took it
[28:33] and i put it to my head but i was too
[28:35] scared to pull the trigger so i felt
[28:37] like a failure because i'm like i can't
[28:38] even pull the trigger
[28:40] i would stand on top of parking decks or
[28:42] parking garages try to jump off and it
[28:45] didn't work because i just was too
[28:46] scared to die because i didn't really
[28:47] want to die but i wanted to paint the
[28:49] end and i knew what was going to end the
[28:50] pain going to church but i just didn't
[28:52] want to do that
[28:53] i felt like i was too deep now i felt
[28:55] like everybody was mad at me in the
[28:56] church i'm two three years now out of
[28:59] the church i'm in the midst of
[29:01] drugs that i've never done before all my
[29:04] all my friends are mad at me i felt like
[29:05] i'm ruining my life and then it just
[29:07] came to a climax point to where
[29:09] everything just like
[29:11] i just broke down
[29:13] and one of the last nights i took some
[29:14] fentanyl xanax
[29:16] and my friend kayla said i just stood up
[29:19] and i just fell face first into my table
[29:22] and she said she like sat me on a couch
[29:23] and just had an ice pack on me all night
[29:25] while she was watching me she said she
[29:27] was my breathing was really low
[29:29] but i was just begging them not to call
[29:31] 911 i guess and i was like i'm fine but
[29:33] i was i was i survived so that morning i
[29:35] woke up because she was leaving and so
[29:37] was garrett and they were like we're
[29:38] done and i kind of was like in a rage
[29:40] fuel i felt like i didn't do anything
[29:41] wrong like out that's how out of it i
[29:44] was like
[29:45] i was mad at them for wanting to leave
[29:46] and i went off on everybody so i grabbed
[29:48] the knife and kx tackled me so we were
[29:50] fighting on the ground for a knife and
[29:52] how embarrassing this is talking about
[29:54] it we were fighting on the ground for a
[29:56] knife and he was like what are you doing
[29:57] i've never seen you act like this he's
[29:59] like what are you doing i'm just
[30:00] i'm like i'm over it and then i just
[30:03] it didn't work he took the knife from me
[30:05] so i remember i just bolted out the door
[30:06] into the woods and he called 9-1-1 and
[30:10] my mom told me that he called her it was
[30:11] like he was like i'm so sorry i had to
[30:12] call the police i didn't know what else
[30:14] to do you know he's trying to kill
[30:15] himself
[30:16] and so i remember i took i broke a glass
[30:19] bottle in the woods and i like
[30:20] trying to cut my wrists
[30:23] but then also i was scared at the same
[30:24] time so i couldn't do it
[30:26] that was like the climatic point
[30:28] basically the ambulance came and i
[30:30] agreed to go with them and they put me
[30:32] in a mental hospital
[30:34] call me corncracker because that's from
[30:36] kentucky you know and and uh
[30:39] i was i really was terribly dressed and
[30:41] they'd make fun of my hair hanging
[30:43] printer as long as it is now and um all
[30:46] down over my face now i just have an
[30:48] awful time you know and they would beat
[30:50] me around and slap anytime anybody gets
[30:52] their temper up their ball crowd just
[30:53] get old with me and slap me down here
[30:54] i'll come see and um so then in a fight
[30:58] and we got we gave him i even had knife
[31:00] fights and everything else and he took a
[31:02] winchester rifle and tried to shoot it
[31:04] pumped it right into four or five boys
[31:06] and beat me and i could hardly stand up
[31:08] i would have killed every one of them
[31:09] that meant for god picked up the shells
[31:11] all ground put it back in the gun and
[31:12] just shoot as good as they ever did
[31:15] i've been a murderer a five man probably
[31:18] of five boys was only about 12 years old
[31:20] i tempered
[31:27] after i got out of the mental hospital
[31:30] i remember repenting i remember finally
[31:33] going and i repented
[31:35] so i went home called my grandma i was
[31:38] like nana i got to get out of here she
[31:40] lives in arizona so i told her i got to
[31:42] get out of here
[31:43] then i'm going to end up dead if i stay
[31:45] here and she said she would come and get
[31:47] me and she was literally here within
[31:48] like a couple days
[31:50] so she came i basically told all my
[31:52] friends i was like hey guys i'm out of

[32:09] happening and that i was leaving to go

[33:00] break down you know i just started
[33:02] breaking down i'm like hey guys i'm so
[33:03] sorry for leaving and they told me they
[33:05] don't regret anything and that it's okay
[33:07] they're not mad you know and i told him
[33:09] what happened that i had to leave to get
[33:10] my mind right and he was like okay
[33:12] you know so we all we all kind of had a
[33:14] little prayer session i repented finally
[33:17] it was it was true repentance even
[33:19] though i didn't i still went into sin
[33:21] but
[33:21] it was like i was done with this part of
[33:23] my life done with drugs and
[33:26] and that really just ended that story in
[33:28] ohio like i after that i left his house
[33:31] it was super emotional time but i left
[33:33] his house and went on got on the flight
[33:36] went to arizona and then
[33:38] that's a whole nother story i was in
[33:40] arizona for like three years yeah about
[33:42] three years
[33:43] you know brother and your story you can
[33:44] see a lot about us the spiritual state
[33:47] that you were in uh jesus taught in
[33:49] matthew chapter 12 that each one of us
[33:51] is like a house
[33:53] and we've got to fill our houses with
[33:55] the strong man of faith we've got to
[33:57] fill our our bodies and our minds with
[34:00] good things well in your case you know
[34:02] when you
[34:04] fell away and backslid you know your
[34:06] faith got bound up it got paralyzed uh
[34:09] they you know whenever you started
[34:11] believing you know for
[34:13] um you know fame and music popularity
[34:17] and riches
[34:18] you know when you let those thoughts in
[34:19] that bound up your faith and then think
[34:21] about how many devils came in
[34:24] that would cause you to do that amount
[34:25] of drugs and cause you to get into
[34:27] witchcraft and
[34:29] tempt you with suicide
[34:31] all these things are just a result of
[34:33] you know you opening up your mind to the
[34:35] wrong spirit
[34:36] but then here right before you leave to
[34:38] arizona you come to my house
[34:41] and uh it was like you never left right
[34:43] you know to to me it was like he's back
[34:46] that's what it felt like too it felt
[34:47] like i never left yeah i remember we sat
[34:49] down there you and i alone down in my
[34:52] little family area downstairs and
[34:54] and you were kind of wondering you know
[34:56] can god forgive me i'm like absolutely
[34:57] god i forgive you yeah brother branham
[34:59] said uh the way you know you haven't
[35:01] gone too far is if you still have a
[35:03] desire to serve the lord you had this
[35:05] desire to serve the lords that's how you
[35:06] know you hadn't gone too far
[35:08] you hadn't sold your soul to the devil
[35:10] you know you were just deceived and you
[35:12] were just tempted
[35:13] i remember saying that prayer brother we
[35:15] cried together
[35:17] we repented i led you in prayer we had a
[35:19] great hug we had a great embrace there
[35:22] and then you flew off to arizona yeah
[35:24] but i think about brother think about
[35:25] all those times like you were saying you
[35:27] almost died this night you almost died
[35:28] that night and i wonder how many of
[35:30] those nights these girls put prayer
[35:32] requests in for you on those nights
[35:34] where you should have died because of
[35:36] drug overdose you should have died
[35:38] because of suicide but yet death escaped
[35:41] you
[35:41] every time death couldn't take you
[35:43] because of the prayers of the saints
[35:45] yeah i mean it was legitimately like
[35:48] that i mean i literally just don't
[35:49] understand how i'm alive like it doesn't
[35:51] make sense yeah it makes no sense uh and
[35:54] so all we can say is god started
[35:56] protecting you more after you left the
[35:58] message
[36:00] to protect your life
[36:02] and uh because god knew you'd eventually
[36:04] come back
[36:05] it's like the prodigal son right you
[36:06] know you started off good you started
[36:08] off in the house of lord you know when
[36:10] you got saved but then you wanted to go
[36:12] out and experience the world and god had
[36:14] to break you down break you down and
[36:16] what was the reason that the son didn't
[36:17] die because god knew he would come back
[36:19] you know the father knew he would come
[36:20] back
[36:21] and so that's the beautiful part about
[36:23] your testimony you know
[36:24] your life got even worse after leaving
[36:27] the message but even in that god knew
[36:28] you'd want to serve him so god had extra
[36:31] grace the bible said god gives us more
[36:33] grace
[36:34] the bible says the headstone comes down
[36:36] with shoutings of grace grace unto it
[36:39] so god you know like all of us too but
[36:42] you know especially in your case you can
[36:43] see how god poured out an extra measure
[36:46] of grace upon your life to protect your
[36:48] life yeah there's so many circumstances
[36:50] i mean that's that's just scraping the
[36:52] surface this is i could have went so
[36:53] much more deeper for time's sake just to
[36:56] give a
[36:57] visual of how crazy it got you know
[36:59] that's it's lots of grace i mean it's
[37:02] i can't explain some of the things that
[37:04] i went through and i'm still here or i
[37:05] mean i should either be dead or in jail
[37:07] there's so many times that he made me
[37:09] get no
[37:10] legal problems i mean i had my license
[37:13] suspended yeah but i never got arrested
[37:16] never had warrants i should have got a
[37:18] dui i should definitely went to jail got
[37:21] arrested 100
[37:22] my license might even have been
[37:24] suspended at that point i don't remember
[37:26] but
[37:27] it's only god like
[37:30] i don't even it's it's scary that i
[37:32] don't even remember some of these things
[37:33] but
[37:35] it's only god brother it's only god man
[37:37] so we can see god protecting you from
[37:40] death
[37:40] god protecting you from prison
[37:43] god protecting you from
[37:45] suicide yeah i mean god protected you
[37:47] from everything so again we just we just
[37:50] give all the credit to god
[37:52] because god
[37:53] god protected your life and this reminds
[37:55] me how brother branham you know
[37:57] um he tried to commit suicide
[37:59] brother ram tried to murder other people
[38:01] and each time god stepped in
[38:04] god wouldn't let the gun go off he was
[38:06] going to shoot those two boys when they
[38:08] made fun of him and beaten him up
[38:10] he went out to shoot him and the gun
[38:12] wouldn't go off
[38:13] and then when the boys left he shot it
[38:15] and the gun went off wow
[38:17] one time he tried to commit suicide up
[38:18] on a uh electric pole and right when he
[38:22] was gonna connect the electricity he
[38:25] passed out and he woke up
[38:27] on the ground
[38:28] alive
[38:30] so in other words god had to step in
[38:31] numerous times because god had a plan
[38:33] for his life
[38:34] and so that tells us obviously god has a
[38:36] great plan for your life
[38:38] definitely feeling like it now for sure
[38:41] yeah
[38:48] we just finished part two of this
[38:49] testimony and we have another part that
[38:51] we want to finish up with with brad
[38:53] austin going to arizona and i hope that
[38:55] you can stay tuned to listen to the rest
[38:56] of the testimony
