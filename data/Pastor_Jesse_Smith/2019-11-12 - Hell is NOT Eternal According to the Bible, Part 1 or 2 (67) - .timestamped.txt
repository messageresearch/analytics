[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] greetings friends in the Mattress name
[0:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:11] this video is to prove by the Bible that
[0:13] hell is not eternal and unbelievers will
[0:16] not burn eternally without end in hell
[0:19] or in the lake of fire because those are
[0:22] two different things
[0:24] to summarize unbelievers cannot burn or
[0:27] suffer torment for eternity because they
[0:30] do not possess eternal life which is
[0:33] God's Spirit eternal life is a person or
[0:36] God and God is a spirit according to
[0:40] Jesus in John 4:24 God's Spirit is the
[0:43] only eternal unending life unbelievers
[0:49] may suffer torment in Hell which is a
[0:51] prison house for many thousands of years
[0:53] but it will not last eternally after the
[0:57] white throne judgment unbelievers may be
[0:59] tormented in the lake of fire and burned
[1:01] for many years but at some point they
[1:04] will be annihilated and done away with
[1:06] because they rejected the person of
[1:08] eternal life Jesus Christ God is too
[1:12] merciful and loving to require
[1:14] unbelievers to suffer an eternal number
[1:16] of years without end
[1:18] for only disbelieving one lifetime on
[1:21] earth
[1:23] here's logical proof of these claims if
[1:26] a sinner is going to the lake of fire
[1:28] and suffer for the same amount of time
[1:31] as you are going to heaven and enjoy its
[1:34] blessings then the sinner has the same
[1:37] kind of life you have already as a
[1:39] believer but that's not true
[1:42] sinners do not possess eternal life
[1:44] which is God's Spirit now may the Bible
[1:48] fully convinced you and I on this
[1:50] subject
[1:52] let's begin with hell is not the same as
[1:55] the lake of fire hell and the lake of
[1:58] fire are not the same hell is the
[2:00] current holding place for unbelievers
[2:02] where they go after death while they are
[2:05] waiting their final judgement at the
[2:07] white throne judgment hell's located in
[2:09] the heart of the earth also called
[2:11] prison by Peter in 1st Peter 3:18
[2:15] through 20 Peter says Jesus after he was
[2:19] crucified went down into hell in his
[2:21] spirit body or form also called a
[2:24] theophany and preached to the spirits in
[2:27] prison who disobeyed Noah's warning for
[2:31] Christ also hath once suffered for sins
[2:33] the just for the unjust that he might
[2:36] bring us to God being put to death in
[2:38] the flesh but quickened by the spirit by
[2:41] which also he went and preached unto the
[2:43] spirits in prison which sometimes were
[2:46] disobedient when once the long-suffering
[2:47] of God waited the days of Noah while the
[2:50] ark was a preparing wherein few that is
[2:53] eight souls were saved by water the
[2:57] Bible tells us what Jesus's spirit was
[2:59] doing on the Saturday following Good
[3:02] Friday his Spirit descended to the heart
[3:05] of the earth or hell Matthew 12:40
[3:08] supports this saying for as Jonas was
[3:11] three days and three nights in the
[3:13] whales belly so shall the Son of Man be
[3:15] three days and three nights in the heart
[3:18] of the earth Paul recorded Jesus's
[3:21] dissention as well saying now that he
[3:23] ascended what is it but that he also
[3:26] descended first into the lower parts of
[3:29] the earth Ephesians 4:9
[3:31] while in Hell Jesus took the keys of
[3:34] hell and death from Satan according to
[3:36] revelation 1:18 and then led many of the
[3:39] Old Testament Saints who were in
[3:41] Abraham's bosom in the heart of the
[3:43] earth back up to Jerusalem and they were
[3:46] seen by many following Jesus's
[3:48] resurrection on Easter morning
[3:50] revelation 1:18 I am he that liveth and
[3:54] was dead and behold I am Alive for
[3:56] evermore amen and have the keys of hell
[4:00] and of death matthew 27:51 253 and
[4:05] behold the veil
[4:06] of the temple was rent in twain from the
[4:08] top to the bottom and the earth did
[4:10] quake and the rocks rent and the graves
[4:12] were opened and many bodies of the
[4:14] saints which slept arose and came out of
[4:17] the graves after his resurrection and
[4:19] went into the holy city and appeared
[4:21] unto many Jesus's parable of the rich
[4:26] man and Lazarus the beggar provides more
[4:28] detail about Hell and also Abraham's
[4:30] bosom the rich man died and in hell he
[4:34] lifted up his eyes being in torments all
[4:36] unbelievers in Hell are currently
[4:38] suffering a level of torment just as
[4:41] prisoners today suffer torment when
[4:43] locked up in prison notice that Jesus
[4:46] led captivity captive or led many of the
[4:49] faithful Old Testament Saints out of
[4:52] Abraham's bosom and resurrected them
[4:54] fulfilling Psalms 68 18 as Paul taught
[4:58] in Ephesians 4:8 Ephesians 4:8 wherefore
[5:04] he saith when he ascended up on high he
[5:06] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[5:08] unto men revelation 20 verses 13 and 14
[5:14] begin to show how hell is not eternal
[5:16] for it is cast into the lake of fire
[5:19] along with death and the sea gave up the
[5:22] Dead which were in it and death and
[5:25] he'll delivered up the Dead which were
[5:26] in them and they were judged every man
[5:28] according to their works and death and
[5:31] he'll were cast into the lake of fire
[5:34] this is the second death the lake of
[5:39] fire is the second death the place where
[5:41] unbelievers are sentenced to after the
[5:44] final judgment at the white throne
[5:45] judgment according to Revelation 20
[5:47] verse 14 and revelation 2:11 he that
[5:52] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[5:53] saith unto the churches
[5:55] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[5:58] the second death next hell had a
[6:03] beginning God and his children did not
[6:06] how was prepared and had a beginning and
[6:09] now we know that it has an ending in the
[6:12] lake of fire all things with the
[6:14] beginning have an ending Matthew 25:41
[6:17] says how was prepared or had a begin
[6:20] then shall he say also unto them on the
[6:23] left hand depart from me ye cursed into
[6:26] everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[6:29] and his angels now if it was prepared
[6:32] then it wasn't without a beginning if it
[6:35] had a beginning then it can't be eternal
[6:37] before moving on
[6:39] note that Melchizedek who was God acting
[6:42] as Abraham's priest in a flesh body in
[6:44] Genesis 14 was without beginning of days
[6:48] so God is without a beginning Hebrews 7
[6:52] 3 without father without mother without
[6:56] descent having neither beginning of days
[6:58] nor end of life but made like unto the
[7:02] Son of God abideth a priest continually
[7:06] notice also in first Timothy 6:15 paul
[7:09] says god only has immortality or eternal
[7:12] life which in his times he shall show
[7:16] who is the blessed and only potentate
[7:18] the king of kings and Lord of lords who
[7:22] only hath immortality dwelling in the
[7:24] light which no man can approach unto
[7:26] whom no man hath seen nor can see to
[7:30] whom be honor and power everlasting amen
[7:33] quoting william branham there is only
[7:36] one kind of eternal life God has it if
[7:39] we have God we have eternal life in and
[7:42] through him so you see the word eternal
[7:45] or everlasting can be applied in various
[7:48] ways but when it applies to God he being
[7:51] what he is it has one meaning it is the
[7:54] duration of God you can't apply it like
[7:57] that to any other thing God alone is
[7:59] eternal and because he lives we live
[8:02] with him now you might say brother Jesse
[8:05] you had a beginning so you're not
[8:07] eternal while it's true my humanity had
[8:10] a beginning my soul did not because the
[8:13] Bible says I was in Christ or in the
[8:16] mind of God before the foundation of the
[8:18] world
[8:19] this means God's thought about me and
[8:21] every believer is eternal Ephesians 1:3
[8:26] 2:5 blessed be the God and father of our
[8:29] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[8:31] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[8:32] places
[8:34] Christ according as he hath chosen us in
[8:37] him before the foundation of the world
[8:40] having predestinated us unto the
[8:43] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[8:45] himself according to the good pleasure
[8:48] of his will every Christian is eternal
[8:52] because they are eternal thoughts of God
[8:54] then when we are born on this earth and
[8:57] later become believers we receive
[8:59] eternal life in our souls when we're
[9:01] born again by the baptism of the Holy
[9:03] Ghost all born-again Christians already
[9:06] possess eternal life this is true
[9:08] because first John 5 11 through 13 says
[9:11] and this is the record that God hath
[9:14] given to us eternal life and this life
[9:17] is in his son he that hath the son hath
[9:21] life and he that hath not the son of God
[9:24] hath not life these things have I
[9:27] written unto you that believe on the
[9:28] name of the son of God that you may know
[9:31] that ye have eternal life and that you
[9:33] may believe on the name of the Son of
[9:35] God yes Holy Ghost field Christians were
[9:39] in the mind of God before the world was
[9:41] founded they are part of the eternal God
[9:44] who had no beginning revelation 13:8 and
[9:47] 17:8
[9:48] say overcomers of the Beast had their
[9:51] names written in the book of life of the
[9:53] Lamb before the foundation of the world
[9:55] again proving true Christians have an
[9:58] eternal quality about them thanks to
[10:00] God's amazing grace revelation 13:8 and
[10:04] all that dwell upon the earth shall
[10:06] worship Him whose names are not written
[10:08] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[10:11] from the foundation of the world
[10:14] revelation 17:8 the Beast that thou
[10:17] sawest was and is not and shall ascend
[10:20] out of the bottomless pit and go into
[10:22] perdition and they that dwell on the
[10:25] earth shall wonder whose names were not
[10:27] written in the book of life from the
[10:29] foundation of the world when they behold
[10:31] the Beast that was and is not and yet is
[10:37] the next truth is that unbelievers will
[10:40] be destroyed with an ending point
[10:43] neither hell nor the lake of fire are
[10:45] eternal or unending because scripture
[10:48] says Satan how and unbelievers will be
[10:51] destroyed or brought to an ending point
[10:54] 2nd Peter 2:12 says sinners are made to
[10:57] be taken and destroyed not tormented
[11:01] eternally but come to destruction but
[11:05] these as natural brute beasts made to be
[11:08] taken and destroyed speak evil of the
[11:10] things that they understand not and
[11:12] shall utterly perish in their own
[11:14] corruption Jesus teaches the same
[11:17] destruction for sinners in Matthew 10:28
[11:20] saying and fear not them which kill the
[11:24] body but are not able to kill the soul
[11:26] but rather fear him which is able to
[11:28] destroy both soul and body in hell Satan
[11:33] will have an ending point when he is no
[11:35] more or doesn't exist according to
[11:37] Ezekiel 28 1900 the among the people
[11:41] shall be astonished at thee thou shalt
[11:44] be a terror and never shalt thou be
[11:46] anymore Malachi 4:1 - 3 describes the
[11:51] judgment of sinners following the Battle
[11:53] of Armageddon and burning of the Earth's
[11:55] surface leaving them neither root nor
[11:58] branch as ashes under the soles of
[12:01] believers feet at the beginning of the
[12:03] millennium Malachi 4 1 2 3 4 behold the
[12:08] day cometh that shall burn as an oven
[12:10] and all the proud yea and all that do
[12:13] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[12:15] that cometh shall burn them up saith the
[12:17] Lord of Hosts that it shall leave them
[12:19] neither root nor branch but unto you
[12:22] that fear my name shall the Sun of
[12:24] righteousness arise with healing in his
[12:26] wings and he shall go forth and grow up
[12:29] as calves of the stall and ye shall
[12:31] tread down the wicked for they shall be
[12:33] ashes under the soles of your feet in
[12:35] the day that I shall do this saith the
[12:38] Lord of hosts
[12:41] lastly let's look at four commonly
[12:43] misunderstood scriptures the first
[12:46] misunderstood scripture is marked 329
[12:49] which says but he that shall blaspheme
[12:51] against the Holy Ghost hath never
[12:53] forgiveness but is in danger of eternal
[12:56] damnation this verse does not teach
[12:59] unbelievers are tormented eternally
[13:01] without end in hell or the lake of fire
[13:04] notice the wording eternal damnation in
[13:07] the Greek damnation means separation
[13:10] judgment or decision the separation of
[13:14] unbelievers will be eternal but not
[13:16] their torment God's judgment or decision
[13:19] upon unbelievers will be eternal but not
[13:23] their torment in other words God's
[13:25] decree against unbelievers will be
[13:27] eternally true and righteous even after
[13:31] their souls are annihilated destroyed
[13:33] and done away with souls of unbelievers
[13:36] will not live eternally because they do
[13:38] not possess Christ eternal life next
[13:42] mark 9 verses 43 and 44 are commonly
[13:46] misunderstood which say and if thy right
[13:49] hand offend thee cut it off it is better
[13:52] for thee to enter into life maimed than
[13:54] having two hands to go into hell into
[13:57] the fire that never shall be quenched
[13:59] where their worm dieth not and the fire
[14:02] is not quenched people often
[14:05] misunderstand two things here fire that
[14:08] never shall be quenched and the worm
[14:10] that dieth not first concerning the fire
[14:13] the fire may be eternal because it may
[14:17] be a manifestation of God's power and
[14:19] presence for Hebrews 12 29 says for our
[14:22] God is a consuming fire this fire may
[14:26] never be quenched as an eternal memorial
[14:28] of God's holiness impurity but that
[14:31] doesn't mean the souls of unbelievers
[14:32] will not be annihilated as 2nd Peter
[14:34] 2:12 has already proven unbelievers are
[14:37] going to be taken and destroyed or
[14:39] annihilated they will be done away with
[14:42] second concerning the worm that dies not
[14:45] there are two options about this
[14:47] statement it may be teaching that the
[14:49] worms will only be living for hundreds
[14:51] or thousands of years because eternal
[14:53] life only comes from faith in Christ
[14:55] or it may mean the worms do indeed have
[14:58] a form of eternal life just like other
[15:00] animals will have such as the army of
[15:03] white heavenly horses mentioned in
[15:05] Revelation 19 verses 11 and 14 it seems
[15:09] all nature including plants animals and
[15:12] insects will return to the Garden of
[15:14] Eden conditions and exists in perfection
[15:17] for eternity for God's glory the tree of
[15:21] life will produce fruit every month so
[15:23] plants will have a form of eternal life
[15:25] according to revelation 22 verse 2
[15:29] Hebrews 6 2 is a third commonly
[15:32] misunderstood scripture it says of the
[15:35] doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of
[15:37] hands and of resurrection of the Dead
[15:40] and of eternal judgment many stumble
[15:44] over the phrase eternal judgment but
[15:46] this scripture has the same meaning as
[15:48] mark 3 29 which says eternal damnation
[15:51] in Hebrews 6 to eternal judgment means
[15:55] God's judgment decree sentence or
[15:57] decision is going to stand for eternity
[16:00] meaning he will never change it it does
[16:03] not say eternal torment or torture God's
[16:08] pure righteous judgment about each
[16:10] person's destiny will be upheld for
[16:12] eternity unbelievers will cease to exist
[16:15] at some point after their torment and
[16:18] will never live again proving God's
[16:20] judgment is eternal Jude 1 verse 7 is
[16:25] the for scripture commonly misunderstood
[16:27] which says even as Sodom and Gomorrah
[16:31] and the cities about them in like manner
[16:33] giving themselves over to fornication
[16:35] and going after strange flesh are set
[16:39] forth for an example suffering the
[16:41] Vengeance of eternal fire in Genesis 19
[16:46] sodom and gomorrah suffered the
[16:48] Vengeance of eternal fire historically
[16:51] speaking sodom and gomorrah stop burning
[16:53] shortly after its destruction
[16:55] as it is not burning today so eternal
[16:58] fire refers to the fiery manifestation
[17:01] of God's presence just like Mark 943
[17:04] speaks of when it says the fire that
[17:06] shall never be quenched our
[17:08] God is a consuming fire and he manifests
[17:11] as a holy fire to display his holiness
[17:14] and power Hebrews 12:28 and 29 wherefore
[17:19] we receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[17:21] moved let us have grace whereby we may
[17:24] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[17:26] godly fear for our God is a consuming
[17:29] fire in closing I hope you can now see
[17:34] that hell is not eternal because it's
[17:37] cast into the lake of fire after the
[17:39] white throne judgment also hopefully you
[17:43] see torment of sinners or unbelievers in
[17:45] the lake of fire is not eternal because
[17:48] they do not possess the Spirit of Jesus
[17:50] Christ which is eternal life the
[17:53] supernatural eternal fire is eternal
[17:56] because it is a manifestation of God's
[17:58] presence but the punishment and torment
[18:01] for unbelievers will not last eternally
[18:05] if you have any questions concerns or
[18:08] testimonies about this video please

[18:16] Christ be the desire of your heart
