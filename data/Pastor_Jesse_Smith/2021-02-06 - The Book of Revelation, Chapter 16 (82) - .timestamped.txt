[0:03] revelation chapter 16.
[0:06] [Music]
[0:07] the themes of this chapter include the
[0:10] pouring out of the seven vials of the
[0:11] wrath of god
[0:13] and a blessing pronounced by christ for
[0:15] those who watch for his coming
[0:19] the pouring out of the seven vowels is
[0:21] detailed in 20 out of the 21 verses in
[0:24] this chapter
[0:26] the seven vowels have a strong
[0:27] similarity to the ten plagues that god
[0:30] executed on egypt when israel left egypt
[0:33] in the days of moses
[0:37] the first vow will be grievous soars
[0:39] upon the men who take the mark of the
[0:40] beast
[0:41] similar to the boils of the sixth plague
[0:44] upon egypt
[0:46] the second vow will be the sea turning
[0:49] into blood
[0:50] similar to the first plague upon egypt
[0:54] the third vow will be the rivers and
[0:56] fountains of water turning into blood
[0:59] again similar to the first plague upon
[1:01] egypt
[1:03] the fourth vow will be the sun scorching
[1:05] man with great fire and heat
[1:09] the fifth vow will be darkness upon the
[1:11] seat of the beast
[1:12] which is the vatican in rome for the
[1:15] beast is a kingdom
[1:16] according to daniel 7 and the kingdom of
[1:19] rome rules today
[1:20] not by military force but by religion
[1:23] and this darkness plague is similar to
[1:25] the ninth plague upon
[1:26] egypt the sixth vowel will be the
[1:31] drawing up of the river euphrates and
[1:33] the three
[1:33] unclean spirits like frogs that gather
[1:36] the kings of the earth and the whole
[1:38] world unto the battle
[1:39] of the great day of god almighty which
[1:42] we believe is
[1:42] armageddon the seventh and final
[1:46] vial will be poured out right before the
[1:48] battle of armageddon
[1:49] and will contain the greatest earthquake
[1:51] the world has ever seen
[1:53] rome that great city will be divided
[1:56] into three parts
[1:58] islands will flee away and mountains
[1:59] will not be found
[2:01] great hail will fall upon the men of the
[2:03] earth as they continue to blaspheme god
[2:06] and this is similar to the seventh
[2:08] plague that contained hail
[2:10] from egypt
[2:13] only verse 15 has a different theme
[2:15] which is the blessing pronounced
[2:17] by christ for his wife or bride the new
[2:20] testament church who is currently
[2:22] waiting for the rapture behold i come as
[2:25] a thief
[2:26] blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth
[2:28] his garments
[2:29] lest he walk naked and they see his
[2:31] shame
[2:32] this blessing is likely to christ's
[2:34] bride because first thessalonians
[2:36] 4 verses 15 through 18 and first
[2:39] thessalonians 5 verse 2
[2:41] and verse 4 speak of christ coming back
[2:44] as a thief the same as in revelation
[2:47] chapter 16
[2:48] verse 15 the fact this blessing is in a
[2:52] tribulation text
[2:54] does not mean the new testament church
[2:56] goes through the tribulation
[2:58] it seems god left this blessing in the
[3:00] text because he knew believers would be
[3:01] reading this prophetic book
[3:03] for the next two thousand years awaiting
[3:06] his second coming
[3:10] the symbols and key revelations include
[3:13] the mark of the beast
[3:14] the image of the beast repentance
[3:18] the seed of the beast the dragon beast
[3:21] false prophet and the battle of the
[3:24] great day
[3:25] of god almighty
[3:28] the mark of the beast is a symbol of
[3:30] accepting the doctrines
[3:32] and doing the will of the one world
[3:34] religion
[3:36] the image of the beast is symbolic for
[3:39] the united council of catholic and
[3:40] protestant churches
[3:42] that hold false doctrines and will seek
[3:44] to destroy true
[3:46] christians repentance is a key
[3:49] revelation in this chapter
[3:51] because under the fifth vowel the
[3:53] tormented group
[3:54] with pains and sores still refuses to
[3:56] repent of their deeds
[3:58] repentance has a three-fold effect and
[4:00] includes one
[4:02] a change of mind two a hatred for past
[4:05] sins
[4:05] and three a making amends for past sins
[4:10] please see our video series on true
[4:12] repentance for an
[4:13] in-depth teaching into this doctrine
[4:16] acts 2 verse 38 tells us the first step
[4:19] to getting right with god for salvation
[4:21] is to
[4:22] repent and be baptized
[4:25] so we can clearly see that the beast
[4:27] worshipers do not even care to reach the
[4:29] first step
[4:30] towards loving god because they love
[4:32] their sins more than the holiness of god
[4:35] just as jesus taught in john 3 verses 19
[4:38] through 21
[4:41] and this is the condemnation that light
[4:43] has come into the world and men love
[4:45] darkness rather than light because their
[4:48] deeds were evil
[4:49] for everyone that doeth evil hateth the
[4:51] light neither cometh to the light
[4:54] lest his deed should be reproved but he
[4:56] that doeth truth cometh to the truth
[4:58] that his deeds may be made manifest that
[5:01] they are wrought in god
[5:04] the seed of the beast is symbolic for
[5:06] the vatican in rome
[5:08] for that is where satan's seat is
[5:10] located currently
[5:11] satan's first seat was in babylon or
[5:13] modern-day iraq
[5:15] then he moved his seat to pergamos
[5:17] according to revelation 2 verse 13
[5:20] in modern day turkey and his thirsty is
[5:23] now the vatican
[5:24] in rome according to revelation 17 verse
[5:26] 9.
[5:28] the dragon and beast and false prophet
[5:31] are revealed as the following
[5:34] the dragon is satan himself according to
[5:36] revelation 12 verse 9.
[5:39] the beast is the demonic spirit behind
[5:42] the kingdom of rome
[5:43] or the vatican according to daniel 7
[5:46] verse 23
[5:49] the false prophet is the future pope who
[5:51] eventually becomes the person of the
[5:53] antichrist
[5:54] and deceives the world by his deceiving
[5:56] miracles
[5:57] according to revelation 19 verse 20.
[6:00] this is true because the roman catholic
[6:02] church is the woman who sits upon the
[6:04] beast
[6:05] revelation 17 verse 3 and the pope is
[6:08] the head of the woman
[6:09] or roman catholic church
[6:12] the battle of that great day of god
[6:14] almighty is symbolic
[6:15] of the battle of armageddon because
[6:18] verse 16 tells us this
[6:20] armageddon is located at the modern day
[6:22] plain
[6:23] of azraelon in northern israel
[6:26] the bible name for this location is the
[6:28] valley of jezreel
[6:30] a famous location of the great victories
[6:32] of barrack over the canaanites
[6:34] and of gideon over the midi knights
[6:40] the timing of events is as follows
[6:43] the first six vowels take place sometime
[6:46] after the seven trumpets
[6:48] and the sixth vowel is what gathers the
[6:50] beast armies to the battle of armageddon
[6:52] according to verses 12 through 14 and
[6:55] 16.
[6:56] it seems the seventh and final vow is
[6:58] poured out shortly before the battle of
[7:00] armageddon
[7:01] because men are still alive and
[7:03] blaspheming god
[7:04] because of the plague of the hail see
[7:06] verse 21
[7:09] the battle of armageddon is when nearly
[7:11] all men and women
[7:12] who took the mark of the beast are slain
[7:15] in judgment
[7:16] by the sword that proceeds out of the
[7:17] mouth of christ jesus
[7:19] according to revelation 19 verses 18 and
[7:22] 19.
