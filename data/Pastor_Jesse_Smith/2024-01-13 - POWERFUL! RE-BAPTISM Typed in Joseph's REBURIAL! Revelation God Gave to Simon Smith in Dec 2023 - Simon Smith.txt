TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I command everyone of you on here on tape that hasn't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ be baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ amen greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share a wonderful Bible Revelation of rebaptism from the Old Testament and this is a brand new revelation that I had never heard of the Lord revealed it to my brother Simon who's also a teacher and missionary to Thailand and God revealed it to him in early December 20123 while he was on a missionary trip in Thailand so I asked my brother Simon if I could make a video about this wonderful Revelation I think it'll be a great blessing by God's grace I'll go through this wonderful Bible Revelation of rebaptism of course we know rebaptism in the New Testament according to acts 19: 1-7 but it is beautifully typed in the Old Testament through the life of Joseph in the Book of Genesis Exodus and then when his bones are finally buried in the promised land in shikim or chicham however you say it it's a city in Israel in the lot of Manasseh before getting into this Revelation I do want to take a few moments and share how this is an example a beautiful example I believe of how brother bandam said we would be given more information about the same Revelation this is found in the church age book pages 83 and 884 brother brandham wonderfully teaches us that God can't give a first revelation than a second brother Bram said he gives the people more information to help them receive and understand the same Revelation so that's what we have today as message Believers we have the revelation of the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ full of Merion and water not calling on titles father son Holy Ghost but calling on the one name to the father son Holy Ghost which is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so a person that's been baptized any other way once they receive the knowledge of this true Lord Jesus Christ water baptism should be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so if a person was baptized in titles father son Holy Ghost and immersed they need to be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or if they were sprinkled with the titles father son Holy Ghost they need to be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and this idea about rebaptism which brother Brandon preached of course proves there is a message of the hour that needs to be received and it's found in the Bible of course brother's accusers say there's no such thing as a message of the hour and that's a bunch of nonsense these people are not Bible preachers they don't have gifts of God to preach and teach the word of God like brother bradam had to gift to be a prophet Apostle Pastor teacher and evangelist I believe brother bradam had all the five gifts the five preaching Gifts of Ephesians 4:1 the proof text for messages of the hour is Acts 19 1-7 it's a very familiar text to those of us who know the message of the hour Paul comes to Ephesus and he finds Believers there we know there was at least 12 cuz 12 received the baptism of the Holy Ghost but Apollos had already taught them the word of God in all the Old Testament scriptures about Jesus as Messiah and they were Believers but Paul came and asked them that wonderful question have ye received the Holy Ghost since you believed of course they said no we didn't know there was a Holy Ghost and then Paul asked them what were you baptized unto and they said John's baptism of course that's the baptism for repentance and remission of sins according to Mark 1:4 then Paul told them about the Lord Jesus Christ baptism and as soon as these Ephesians received the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost 12 of them received the Holy Ghost according to acts 19:7 and so the accusers of brother brandham are ignorant of the Bible Revelation about the message of the hour what they fail to see is that God has always had a message of the hour think about if you lived in the days of Noah you had to receive his message of the hour in order to be saved what about the days of Abraham you had to receive his Revelation about circumcision and so forth to be saved then the days of Moses you had to receive his message because it was further revelation of the same message then the days of David you had to receive the further Revelation anyone that's read 1 Chronicles or 2 Chronicles knows David instituted Temple worship and musicians that was not in Moses's message that was a further Revelation given to David through the davidic Covenant God made a New Covenant and gave more Revelation about the Messiah he gave that to David So in David's day you had to receive the message of your hour two more Old Testament examples of receiving the message of your hour was in the days of zerubabel God used zerubabel to rebuild the Jewish temple after Israel's dispersion out of the promised land due to all their sins and zerel had the message of the hour through the two prophets Hagi and Zechariah remember friends they built a brand new Temple it was so much smaller in comparison to Solomon's Temple that the elders wept and cried but the Bible said they had to receive the day of small things and that's in Zechariah 4:9 and 10 Ezra 3 12 and 13 no doubt there were Jews there saying we need to have a temple like Solomon's but the message of the hour was a day of small things God was still restoring he was restoring Temple worship so you had to receive the message of your hour and next was John the Baptist John the Baptist demanded everyone to repent and be baptized in water well you don't find that in the law of Moses where did Moses ever ask anyone to be baptized in water for remission of sins you don't see that you see the Waters of Separation The sprinkling of water but now John the Baptist demands people go down into the water be buried in water and be raised up in water so again you have to receive the message of your hour moving forward to the church age we can see how a lot of the revelations were lost beginning in the 2 and third especially the fourth Church age the depths of Satan but then in the fifth 6th and 7th we have the restoration of the Gospel of St Paul through Martin Luther any honest person would recognize Luther's message was restoring justification by faith and you had to receive that message of his hour and come out of the previous teaching and move on into the message of the hour that God revealed to Martin Luther and then to John Wesley then to isua street with William Seymour and now to the B restoration Ministry that God gave to William brandham with thus sayith the Lord and again as I said in my previous videos there's six scriptures that brother Brandon fulfilled in order to finish the mystery of God restore our hearts back to the apostolic fathers there's so much Bible proof If a heart is just humble and will open itself up to the true revelation of the Bible brother Ram's message restored Pauline Doctrine it restored the doctrine of the fathers by the grace of God and another example about more information on the same Revelation is the birth of the Messiah Jesus Christ the first revelation about his birth was Genesis 3:15 then of course Isaiah prophesied of him in many scriptures but most apparently Isaiah 53 Micah said he'd be born in Bethlehem Isaiah also said he'd be born of a virgin Isaiah 7 Hosea said he'd take a flight to Egypt with Mary and Joseph Jeremiah said people would weep at the massacre of the infants of Bethlehem and then Malachi 3:1 said he'd be anounced by John the Baptist God's messenger Now by God's grace we'll get into this wonderful Revelation here's a chart I made so the Revelation that God revealed to my brother Simon is that Joseph of the Old Testament son of Jacob was a type of being buried twice his two burials represent the two baptisms of the New Testament so let's start at the top of this chart Joseph is the type his first burial of course was in Egypt according to Genesis 50: 24 and 25 then Moses took his bones out in Exodus 13:19 but he was first buried in Egypt this is a type of the New Testament believer so the antitype of the first burial is the first baptism in the New Testament it was John the Baptist baptism it was a baptism unto repentance and remission of sins it's according to Mark 1:4 then of course Acts 19 1-5 Paul states that plainly the second burial Joseph had was in chichim in the promised land that's according to Joshua 24:32 Joshua and the people in Israel they brought Joseph's bones and they were finally buried in the promised land this is a type of the New Testament antitype of the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism and this baptism also gives you the baptism in the soul which is also called the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the new birth and this is called the promise of the father so catch that word promise in Joseph's life he was buried in the promised land on his second burial in the New Testament believer's life he's buried in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with the promise to receive the soul baptism of the Holy Ghost and this Holy Ghost Soul baptism the new birth is the promise of the father according to Luke 24:49 acts 1:4 and then Peter says they receive this promise of the father in Acts 233 Jesus said this would be a soul baptism in Matthew 11 11 29 and then we see the Fulfillment of this in our proof text of Acts 19 1-7 the Ephesians had already been baptized in the baptism of John they've had their first baptism or their first burial but there was a message of the hour they had to receive and when they received the message of the hour through St Paul now they could receive the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus and then the Soul baptism the promise of the father so we see Joseph back in the promised land and then we see the Ephesians re receiving the promise of the father it was on Joseph's second burial and it was on the and it was on the Ephesians second burial or baptism in water that they receive the promise or we'd say possess the spiritual Promised Land by God's grace the final part of this beautiful revelation God revealed to my brother is that because Joseph had this second burial in the promised land he got a reward for it and the reward was a bodily resurrection and a Ascension to Glory this is awesome Matthew 27:52 and 53 said many of the Saints had a bodily Resurrection when Jesus resurrected We Believe Joseph was there we also believe job was there Abraham Sarah many of the Old Testament Saints the Bible said job also prophesied of this in job 19:25 and 26 and then the Bible said Jesus then LED them into Glory he led captivity captive according to Ephesians 4:8 so because of his second burial he got the reward of Resurrection that's exactly what we see with the New Testament believer the reward for being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost the promise of the father is the first resurrection with Ascension to glory and the first resurrection is found in Revelation 20: 1-5 this is known as the Rapture it's the meeting in the air with the Lord Jesus Christ and all the dead in Christ Saints and the living Saints whose body are transformed at the moment of the Rapture that's 1 Thessalonians 4:1 17 and the final proof text of this is Romans 6: 4 and 5 the Bible says if we are buried with him by baptism and if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection so there it is the promise of resurrection and believers who don't know the message of the hour just think there's one Resurrection but we know there's two resurrections the the first resurrection is the rapture Resurrection as Revelation 20: 1-5 says the second Resurrection is the resurrection unto the white Throne judgment and the second Resurrection is in Revelation 20: 12-15 when the dead small and great stand before God every person that ever lived will be resurrected and receive judgment either eternal life or Eternal damnation in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing when brother Simon shared this with me I was so blessed this is another example of more Bible information on the same Revelation this is just another proof to me that God is in this message of the hour because all these Bible doctrines brother R gave us from the scripture are typed in the Old Testament the Bible said the law was a shadow the Old Testament was a shadow and we see the reality in Christ Joseph's life was a shadow his two burials show we must repent but then we also must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost we must be buried in the promise the promise for the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism and before we close I did remember I was reminded that brother Bram gave us a quote and he said thus sayith the Lord you need to be re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if you were previously baptized in titles father son Holy Ghost let's listen to the quote th sayth the Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah huj the baptism using the title of father son Holy Ghost is false amen thus sayith the Lord amen amen amen I command every one of you on here on tape that hasn't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ be baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ amen Paul in Acts 59 or 195 said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and said we know not where it be any Holy Ghost said what was you baptized amen they said we've been baptized but not in Christan Christian baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost is not Christian baptism amen no Christian was ever baptized like that in the Bible amen or for hundreds of years after the Bible it's a Catholic Creed and not a Christian doctrine show me in the Bible amen it's a it's a fraud it's a working of devils amen I don't mean to say the people it's baptized like that are that way God's got a many person out there today that don't know no better but the hour has come amen we've got to get back to the word if we expect God to work in this day like live then so friends this is true God has given us a genuine bible-based Prophet we love brother brandom we love his ministry how he point us back to the word of God he said prove all things he said test me by the word and acts 17 says we should search the scriptures daily whether these things be so and the more we search the Bible and brother Ram's quotes the more we know he was a prophet of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
