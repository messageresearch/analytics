TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ do eagles represent prophets the answer is yes based upon two scriptures and it's also apparent jesus christ himself uses eagles to represent believers and specifically the believers alive at the time of his second coming there is a group of people who have left the bible-based teachings of brother william branham who i'll call accusers of brother branham and they claim that the bible does not compare god's prophets to eagles they state this of course in a sad attempt to discredit brother branham as a true prophet of god the purpose of this video is to show brother branham was right and his accusers are wrong eagles represent the prophets moses and aaron there are 34 uses of the word eagle or eagles in the king james version 30 in the old testament and 4 in the new testament it's interesting to note god uses the eagle to represent swiftness and strength in both evil and good people the eagle also represents watchfulness in believers if you have questions about those scriptures contact me personally or do your own concordance word search to prove eagles represent prophets you look at the very first use of the word eagle from exodus 19 verse 4. this verse is alluding to moses and aaron as eagles and both men were prophets exodus 19 verse 4 says ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself notice god used two eagle wings to bring israel out of egypt to himself god appears to be the eagle in this verse as albert barnes taught as well and he also likened himself to an eagle in deuteronomy 32 verses 11 through 13 which says as an eagle stirth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings so the lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with him he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock back to exodus 19 verse 4 notice the two wings of the eagle first samuel 12 verses 6 through 8 is the second portion of scripture that alludes to moses and aaron being the two wings or prophets that brought israel out of egypt verses 6 and 8 declare and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers out of the land of egypt when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place so we see similar wording in both scriptures about both wings and two prophets bringing israel out of egypt notice exodus 19 verse 4 says how i bear you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself and first samuel 12 6 and verse 8 says moses and aaron that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt notice the same words of brought you and brought your in reference to how god brought israel out of egypt he used moses and aaron the two eagle wings many scriptures call moses a prophet such as deuteronomy 34 verse 10 so there's no debate about that but some might question aaron as a prophet but exodus 7 verse 1 records god himself calling aaron moses prophet exodus 7 verse 1 says and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet the prophetic gift must have been upon moses's family for miriam also had the gift of prophecy according to exodus 15 verse 20 which says and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances it's easy to see the similarities between a prophet and an eagle and how they can be both used interchangeably as both have amazing eyesight the ego and the natural and the prophet in the spiritual the bible calls prophets seers because of the heavenly visions they see which correlates to the amazing eyesight of eagles who can see their prey from a mile away first samuel 9 verse 9 says before time in israel when when a man went to inquire of god thus he spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was before time called a seer jesus calls end time believers eagles the gospels have two instances of jesus calling believers eagles which are matthew 24 28 and luke 17 verse 37. these are parallel passages so they are records of the same event both texts give us a full context of how christ jesus represents end time believers as eagles first here's what matthew 24 verse 28 says and notice the context is also the second coming of the son of man for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together moving to luke 17 verses 34 through 37 notice the context is again the second coming of jesus christ which will be the pre-tribulation rapture for jesus gives three situations in which one person is left and the other is taken it says i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be gathered together any honest bible reader concludes that believers will be gathered around the meat of god's word at the time of jesus's second coming meat in the new testament is likened unto both the perfect will of god by jesus christ in john 4 34 and also deep mature teachings that differentiate mature believers from immature believers john 4 verse 34 says jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work mature meat-eating believers are able to discern good and evil in their daily lives according to hebrews 5 14 but strong meat belonged to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil there is also the truth of the carcass or body being fresh meat or the message of the hour peter calls this present truth in second peter 1 verse 12 saying wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth there have been times throughout the church ages when truth was lost to the believers but not to god god is infinite and never loses truth or revelations but truth was lost in the church ages such as the doctrine of the one person godhead in my latest book the twelve new testament mysteries revealed there's a section fully teaching this truth on pages 421-425 seven scriptures speak of a full restoration of truth at jesus's second coming those scriptures are matthew 17 11 acts 3 20 through 21 joel 2 verses 23 through 26 daniel 12 4 daniel 12 9 revelation 10 verses 7 through 11 and matthew 24 verse 14. so this evidence points to the fact that some truth would be lost during the 2000 year-long time of the gentiles as jesus called it in luke 21 24 or seven gentile church ages ecclesiastes 3 verse 6 also shows how there are times to get and times to lose this speaks of both natural and spiritual as revelation 2 verses 4 and 5 speaks of leaving your first love and jesus promises it can be restored see my book for the full teaching and if you'd like a free copy and can't afford one i'll be happy to mail you one the reality that there are ages is firmly taught in the bible despite either the lies or ignorance of brother branham's accusers who have left brother branham's message in the following scriptures you find the truth ephesians 3 verse 5 and colossians 1 verse 26 which speak up past ages and ephesians 3 verse 21 which speaks of future ages if paul in the bible speaks of past and future ages then he must have been living in an age himself which he was the ephesian church age more bible proof about eagles four more scriptures prove eagles can refer to god his prophets and true believers ephesians 4 verse 11 places prophets as an office in the five full ministry which jesus christ himself set up and ordained to edify the body of christ it is undeniable there is a prophetic preaching gift within the body of jesus christ and first corinthians 12 10 also teaches any member of the body of christ can have the gift of prophecy even if he or she is not a preacher further every true born again holy ghost-filled christian has the spirit of prophecy in their lives according to scriptures revelation 19 verse 10 and john 16 13 a believer has a testimony of jesus christ which is the spirit of prophecy revelation 19 10 for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy john 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come friend god shows the believers things to come as i've seen it in my life on numerous occasions whether through a dream or a word from the lord just in my simple humble insignificant little life the spirit of jesus christ has foretold the future in the following ways first on numerous occasions we've needed prayer for serious needs and believers have spoken words of comfort for telling the outcome of the events before they've happened second both my wife and i have had dreams warning believers of their fall from the truth and we share them with the individuals who did not take heed to the dreams and those individuals fell into the sins they were warned of in the dreams third before giving birth to one of our children my wife had a dream giving us the name for the child and the details of his birth that there would be no midwife present and the dream came to pass exactly in that manner fourth one friend of mine told me twice i have prophesied to him and didn't realize it regarding a season of rest that was coming and the removal of an administrator we needed in order to preach with freedom the gospel in a public school if end time believers are eagles as jesus says all believers are eagles throughout all the ages for god is father eagle as he declared in deuteronomy and within the family of believers are prophet eagles whose main ministry is to foretell the future the eagle anointing the final scriptures about eagles are in revelation 4 verse 7 and revelation 6 verses 7 through 8. in revelation 4 verse 7 we see four beasts around jesus's throne and the fourth and final one is the flying eagle and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle in revelation 6 verses 7 through 8 this fourth beast shows john the fourth horse rider of the four seal and the rider is death and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast saying come and see and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth although mysterious to some god has shown us the revelation of these four beasts for they are throne guards to jesus's throne these four beasts are also seen in ezekiel chapters 1 and 10. here are some visuals and they are not my original work if i can find the references i'll place them in the video two examples are evident in the old testament the 12 tribes were arranged in four groups around the ark or throne of god's presence and historians like matthew george easton author of easton's bible dictionary say jewish historians claim the four groups had four banners with the lion ox man and eagle the second example is the four gospels in the book of acts the book of acts represents the presence of god acting in the church and their acts teaching and doctrines are all guarded by the four gospels of matthew mark luke and john in other words jesus's life power and teachings in the four gospels paved the way for the book of acts the apostles in acts were completely ordained and directed by jesus christ and in complete harmony with his three and a half year ministry recorded in the four gospels note that the holy ghost had brother branham speak this truth about the four beasts as thus saith the lord in march of 1963. let's listen to the quote but the antichrist is cunning he's got all kinds of things that represents christianity only got off on the other side something against the original doctrine of it that's what makes him antichrist so the reformers when the beast went forth in the form of a of a man to combat that i don't forget this class don't forget it see remember all the days of your life i think these beasts are correct it's thus saith the lord brother branham said the four beasts were anointings of the holy ghost believers who lived in the time of the gentile church ages would need to overcome satan and his antichrist spirit this is accurate especially in light of the seven seals which the fourth beast the flying eagle reveals in his words to john the flying eagle revealed the identity of the fourth horse rider which was death death is a spirit and must be the antichrist spirit for god's spirit or spirit of christ is life romans 8 verse 2 plainly teaches this for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made us free from the law of sin and death so the flying eagle anointing is the anointing of the holy ghost upon end time believers as they watch and pray for jesus's second coming first john chapter 2 verses 22 and 23 is more proof that the fourth horse rider is the antichrist and he is equivalent to the spirit of death because the antichrist spirit denies the father and son the son is the word and the word is truth and life proving this death rider is the antichrist spirit for he denies the truth of the word remember that the spirit of the son is life first john 2 verse 22 and 23 say who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father but he that acknowledges the son hath the father also the timing of this fourth beast the flying eagle points to the end time right before the rapture of the new testament church right before god returns to the jews this is seen in the order of the seven seals the first four seals have horse riders while the fifth sixth and seventh do not have horse riders the fifth seal in particular gives us proof of the timing of the events the fifth seal focuses on the jews for they are the souls under the altar that do not have the testimony of jesus but the testimony of the word of god or old testament this means the first four seals deal with the gentiles during the time of the gentiles or seven church ages the pale horse rider or fourth and final horse rider has a ministry of death and destruction and is combated by the fourth beast the eagle anointing since eagles represent prophets like moses and aaron and new testament prophets and believers this shows a prophetic anointing is upon christians in the last age the evidence of this prophetic anointing is the ministry of william branham who spoke with thus saith the lord accurately in my latest book i detail 30 thus saith the lord's statements and they're found in the 13th and final chapter on pages 751 through 762. this is the flying eagle age right before god returns to the jews in which holy ghost-filled christians are anointed with the spirit of prophecy today's christians also called jesus's bride in the bible are hot or on fire for jesus as expressed in revelation 3 verse 16 due to their hearts being turned back to the apostolic fathers as taught by malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 we have thus saith the lord for doctrine and prophecy and we love it overcome by it and live by it in closing i hope this video has been a blessing please contact me with any questions or concerns [Music] god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
