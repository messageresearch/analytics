[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] wait a minute what is it it's the thing
[0:06] that Jesus said even the angels of
[0:09] heaven didn't know nothing about it
[0:13] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:18] the purpose of this video is to prove
[0:20] hopefully once and for all by God's
[0:23] grace that God's Prophet brother Bynum
[0:25] did not plagiarize the seventh seal from
[0:28] Charles Tay's Russell nor Clarence
[0:30] Larkin before we look at the seventh
[0:33] seal let's recall that so far within the
[0:35] first six seals
[0:37] there have been 33 differences between
[0:39] brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell
[0:42] and Clarence Larkin
[0:43] on the first four seals while the Rams
[0:46] accuser compared brother Branham to
[0:49] Charles Taze Russell only
[0:52] and there were 26 differences between
[0:54] brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell
[0:56] on the first four seals
[0:58] then on the fifth and sixth seals
[1:00] brother Ram's accuser compared brother
[1:03] Branham to Clarence Larkin only
[1:05] and there were seven more differences so
[1:07] 26 plus 7 comes to a total of 33
[1:11] differences between brother Ram's
[1:13] Revelation from God and the incorrect
[1:15] teachings of Charles Taze Russell and
[1:18] Larkin on the first six seals
[1:21] and of course there were some
[1:22] similarities between brother Bynum and
[1:24] Clarence Larkin and Charles Taze Russell
[1:26] on the first six seals but the
[1:28] difference is greatly outweighed the
[1:30] similarities
[1:32] and remember this number 33 does not
[1:34] include the differences between brother
[1:36] Brenham and Clarence Larkin and Uriah
[1:39] Smith on the first four seals and also
[1:41] does not include the differences between
[1:43] brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell
[1:46] and Uriah Smith on the fifth and sixth
[1:49] seals so imagine the number of
[1:50] differences between brother Branham and
[1:53] those men on the other seals is likely
[1:55] in the 40s 50s or perhaps 60s
[1:59] and now with this video on the seventh
[2:01] seal there are five more differences
[2:03] between brother Branham and Charles Taze
[2:05] Russell and Clarence Larkin on the
[2:07] seventh seal for a grand total of 38
[2:09] differences
[2:13] let's begin with the accusation
[2:16] on May 5th 2022 brother Rams accuser
[2:19] made a video called the theft of the
[2:22] seventh seal did William Branham
[2:23] intentionally mislead his followers and
[2:26] his accusations were quote it should be
[2:28] no surprise however that what he did say
[2:30] on the seventh seal was also copied from
[2:32] the writings of Charles Taze Russell and
[2:33] Clarence Larkin end quote
[2:36] and then brother Graham's accuser
[2:38] displayed the following words quote the
[2:40] revelation of the Seven Seals is simply
[2:42] cut and paste plagiarism end quote
[2:46] so obviously these are false accusations
[2:49] but of course I do want to say that
[2:50] brother Branham obviously used some of
[2:52] Larkin's work and wording on the seventh
[2:55] seal but as you'll see there was two
[2:57] great differences between brother
[2:58] Branham and Clarence Larkin
[3:00] also on brother Brown's accusers video
[3:03] from May 5th 2022 he used the quote from
[3:06] Brother Branham from the seventh seal
[3:08] where brother Adam said now I want to
[3:10] make this real clear everything ever
[3:12] believed on them and has read of other
[3:14] people has been contrary to what came to
[3:16] me in the room
[3:18] now in a previous video I said that this
[3:20] quote was likely brother and I'm using
[3:22] hyperbole
[3:23] so in one sense this quote could be
[3:25] hyperbole because brother Ram said
[3:27] everything he ever read and so of course
[3:30] brother random used some of Larkin's
[3:32] work especially on the Sixth Seal and as
[3:34] we'll see here some work on the seventh
[3:36] seal so this statement by Brother
[3:38] Branham is likely hyperbole but in
[3:41] another sense the statement by Brother
[3:43] Branham can be true so if brother random
[3:45] was just speaking generally about the
[3:46] Seven Seals then overall the 38
[3:49] differences he had with Larkin Russell
[3:52] and Uriah Smith make his Revelation very
[3:55] different as a whole in the general
[3:57] sense
[4:00] now let's begin comparing brother
[4:01] random's Revelation on the seventh seal
[4:03] and Charles days Russell
[4:05] there are three main differences between
[4:07] Charles Taze Russell and brother Branham
[4:10] on the seventh seal
[4:12] first Charles says Russell said the
[4:15] Christian Church goes through
[4:16] persecution during the Great Tribulation
[4:19] period on page 143 of his book called
[4:23] The Finnish mystery Russell said quote
[4:25] about the space of half an hour on the
[4:29] scale of a year for a day this would
[4:30] mean but a week and indicates that as
[4:33] soon as the full number to complete the
[4:35] body of Christ have been sealed with the
[4:36] present truth persecution in a public
[4:38] way and on an unprecedented scale may be
[4:42] expected to begin almost immediately end
[4:45] quote
[4:47] now of course this differs from Brother
[4:49] Branham brother Ram said the bride of
[4:51] Christ does not go through persecution
[4:54] let's listen to two quotes one from the
[4:56] Feast of trumpets and then the second
[4:58] from questions and answers part one
[5:01] but here you again the bride will not go
[5:04] through that time
[5:06] [Applause]
[5:07] the church will but not the bride can't
[5:10] you see it
[5:12] ministers can't you see that brethren
[5:16] he said the church has to go through the
[5:18] persecution for the for the Perfection
[5:20] of it the blood of Jesus Christ
[5:22] perfectses the bride
[5:26] brother Branham will the bride go
[5:28] through the persecution as the early
[5:30] Apostolic Church did no I just explained
[5:33] that a few minutes ago no next thing is
[5:35] a Rapture now
[5:39] how anyone can get the church going
[5:40] through the tribulation I don't know but
[5:42] once you've got to go through the
[5:44] tribulation for it when God has not a
[5:46] sin I mean I don't mean the church the
[5:48] church will go through the tribulation
[5:49] but I'll talk about the bride the bride
[5:52] oh God
[5:54] bleached out it's not even a uh not even
[5:57] a snare of it nothing left
[6:00] before God
[6:02] but what's the intribulation to purify
[6:04] them but the others do the church does
[6:06] go through the tribulation but not the
[6:07] bride
[6:11] now of course brother Branham taught the
[6:13] foolish virgin goes through persecution
[6:14] but not the bride of Christ
[6:17] and Charles Hayes Russell did not teach
[6:19] this difference between the wise and
[6:21] foolish virgins
[6:23] the second difference is that Charles
[6:25] Hayes Russell taught the 144 000
[6:27] believers who were sealed in their
[6:29] foreheads in Revelation chapter 7 was
[6:32] the Christian church as Russell's book
[6:34] says that Russell was likely from the
[6:36] tribe of Judah
[6:38] and of course brother random differed
[6:39] with this
[6:40] let's read Russell's quote on page 130
[6:43] Russell wrote quote of the tribe of
[6:46] Judah were sealed twelve thousand Judah
[6:48] signifies celebrated lauded praised
[6:50] nothing is more praiseworthy than
[6:52] Justice noble-mindedness the doing to
[6:55] everybody as one would wish to be done
[6:57] by our Lord was the just one of the
[6:59] tribe of Judah all who knew Pastor
[7:02] Russell intimately recognized that
[7:04] Justice was the foundation principle of
[7:06] his character end quote
[7:09] and now play two quotes that show
[7:11] brother Ram taught the 144 000 was
[7:13] Israel or 144 000 Jewish believers who
[7:17] get sealed with the baptism of the Holy
[7:19] Ghost when Jesus returns to the Jews
[7:22] the first quote is from the 17th week of
[7:24] Daniel and the second quote is from the
[7:26] sardisian church age chapter 7 from the
[7:28] church age book let's listen to the
[7:30] quotes
[7:42] for now Israel is back in Palestine and
[7:45] soon the Lord will seal 144 000 of them
[7:51] the third difference is Charles Tays
[7:53] Russell said the seventh seal was
[7:55] fulfilled in Revelation 7 verse 2.
[7:57] notice that Russell said the seventh
[7:59] seal was actually the Seal of the Living
[8:01] God from Revelation 7 verse 2 that's
[8:05] different from Brother Branham brother
[8:06] Branham said the seventh seal is
[8:08] fulfilled and begins at the Rapture of
[8:10] the Gentile Church in Matthew 24 36.
[8:14] let's quote Russell on page 143 of his
[8:17] book he said quote had opened the
[8:19] seventh seal the Seal of the Living God
[8:21] Revelation 7 verse 2 the opening of The
[8:24] Seven Seals Progressive the opening and
[8:26] unfolding of the truth goes on as the
[8:28] Saints are sealed end quote
[8:31] of course brother Branham uses Matthew
[8:33] 24 36 to say the seventh seal begins at
[8:37] the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[8:39] the Gentile Church it is the day and
[8:41] hour of the coming of the Lord Jesus
[8:43] Christ here are two quotes that plainly
[8:46] say that the first is from Christ is the
[8:48] mystery of God revealed 1963 and the
[8:50] second is from Souls that are imprisoned
[8:52] now again from 1963. let's listen to the
[8:55] quotes
[8:57] God's great mystery
[9:00] of how it's a secret he kept it a secret
[9:02] nobody know nothing about even the
[9:04] angels didn't understand it he he didn't
[9:06] reveal it that's the reason under our
[9:08] seventh
[9:10] um uh mystery when the seventh sea was
[9:13] open there was silence
[9:15] Jesus when he was on Earth
[9:18] they won't know when he would come he
[9:19] said it's not even the son himself don't
[9:22] know when it's going to happen see God
[9:24] has this all to himself
[9:26] it's a secret
[9:28] that's reasonable silence in heaven
[9:30] first base the Empire and seven Thunders
[9:32] are their voices and John was even
[9:34] forbidden to write it see the cunning of
[9:37] the Lord that's one thing he hasn't
[9:39] revealed yet and how he will come and
[9:42] when he will come it's a good thing that
[9:43] he doesn't
[9:46] a lamb took his book from the seventh
[9:49] seal is ready for it to be open The
[9:51] Sixth Seal remember he hid the seventh
[9:53] seal promise
[10:00] no one knew
[10:02] it was the coming of the Lord
[10:06] so our conclusion with Russell is that
[10:09] brother random did not plagiarize
[10:10] Charles Taze Russell as brother Ram's
[10:12] accusers video showed yes Russell
[10:15] believed the Revelation 10 verse 7 7th
[10:18] Angel was also the seventh angel of
[10:21] Revelation 3 verse 14. so that's the one
[10:24] thing brother Branham and Charles days
[10:26] Russell agreed on but of course Charles
[10:28] Tay's Russell was not that seventh angel
[10:30] brother Branham was that seventh angel
[10:32] and again there are three main
[10:34] differences between brother Bynum and
[10:36] Charles Taze Russell the first is that
[10:38] the Christian church does not go through
[10:40] the persecution in the tribulation the
[10:42] second is that the 144 000 are Jews who
[10:46] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:47] when Jesus returns during the Great
[10:50] Tribulation period and not the Christian
[10:51] church
[10:53] and the third is that the seventh seal
[10:54] is the day and hour of Jesus's Rapture
[10:57] of the bride of Christ and not the
[10:59] ceiling of the 144 000 Jews in
[11:02] Revelation 7 verse 2.
[11:04] now let's compare Clarence Larkin and
[11:07] brother Branham on the seventh seal
[11:10] to begin with anyone who studied the
[11:12] seventh seal from Brother Branham and
[11:14] Clarence Larkin know that brother
[11:15] Branham quoted a few of Larkin's
[11:18] statements on the seventh seal such as
[11:21] Larkin saying the seventh seal extends
[11:23] down to the ushering into the millennium
[11:26] and the Seven Seals like a rocket fired
[11:28] in the air that may burst into seven
[11:30] stars and also of how the half hour
[11:33] silence was a nerve-breaking tension
[11:36] but in this video I want to show the two
[11:38] main differences between brother Branham
[11:39] and Clarence Larkin on the seventh seal
[11:42] the first is the very definition of the
[11:44] seventh seal Larkin said the definition
[11:47] is simply the period of Silent
[11:49] preparation before the trumpets
[11:51] Larkin said quote it was the period of
[11:54] Silent preparation for the awful
[11:55] judgments that were to burst forth in
[11:57] the earth under the trumpets and vials
[11:59] end quote
[12:02] so as you can see here's Larkin's
[12:04] timeline of the seventh seal
[12:07] notice it's in the first half of
[12:09] Daniel's 70th week
[12:12] and here the Seven Seals the silence and
[12:14] the golden sensor and also includes the
[12:17] golden altar
[12:18] and notice how the Seven Seals after the
[12:20] Sixth Seal the physical changes and the
[12:23] interval where a blood wash multitude is
[12:25] saved and also the 144 000 are sealed
[12:30] so brother bran did not teach this
[12:33] brother Ram said the seven seal begins
[12:36] with the day in hour of the Rapture of
[12:39] the Gentile bride and brother Ram
[12:41] defines the Seven Seals all the time
[12:43] from the Rapture a till the future home
[12:46] let's listen to the quote
[12:59] the things written in the seventh seal
[13:02] book
[13:03] sealed up of the Plan of Redemption from
[13:07] before the foundation world and every
[13:10] bit ends
[13:11] it is the end it is the end of the
[13:15] struggling world and end of struggling
[13:17] nature it's the end of everything in
[13:20] there is the end of the trumpets it's
[13:22] the end of the vials it's the end of the
[13:24] Earth it's a it's even the end of time
[13:28] time Runs Out
[13:31] the Bible said so
[13:32] Matthew the seventh chapter I mean
[13:35] Revelations the seventh chapter and one
[13:38] the seven first
[13:40] lyrics it's the end of the church age
[13:43] it's the the end of a seventh seal it's
[13:47] the end of the trumpets it's the end of
[13:49] the vowels and even in the ushering in
[13:53] of the millennium
[13:56] that's on the seventh seal
[13:59] recall the two previous quotes from
[14:01] Christ's mystery of God revealed Souls
[14:04] that are imprisoned now where brother
[14:06] Adam said the seventh seal was the
[14:07] coming of the Lord also here's another
[14:09] quote from the seventh seal sermon
[14:11] itself where brother Graham says the
[14:13] seventh seal is the day and hour of
[14:15] Jesus is coming for the Gentile bride
[14:17] let's listen to the quote
[14:20] at that time
[14:23] chance stand right he said go at it
[14:27] Jesus never spoke of it
[14:31] John couldn't run
[14:33] Angels know nothing about it
[14:36] amen what is it it's the thing that
[14:40] Jesus said even the angels of heaven
[14:43] didn't know nothing about it
[14:46] he didn't do it himself amen he said
[14:49] only God would know it amen
[14:52] but he told us when we begin to see
[14:54] these signs coming up
[14:58] yeah
[15:01] so without a doubt Larkin and brother
[15:03] Branham disagreed on the definition of
[15:05] the seventh seal brother random seven
[15:07] seal was more than just a period of
[15:09] Silent preparation it includes the
[15:11] moment of the Gentile Rapture and then
[15:13] the seven year Great Tribulation period
[15:15] followed by the battle of Armageddon
[15:18] followed by the fervent Heat
[15:20] that burns the outside of the earth
[15:22] before the Saints walk out into the
[15:24] Millennium and then it includes the
[15:26] millennium
[15:27] and also the Battle of Gog and Magog at
[15:30] the end of the millennium
[15:31] and then also seems to include the great
[15:33] white Throne judgment
[15:34] and then the seventh seal ends when the
[15:36] future home begins
[15:42] the second difference between brother
[15:43] Branham and Clarence Larkin is the
[15:45] timing Larkin said the seventh seal is
[15:47] after the Sixth Seal
[15:49] again let's look at Larkin's chart here
[15:53] so you can see the seventh seal starts
[15:56] about the middle of first half of
[15:59] Daniel's 70th week
[16:01] after the rise of the Antichrist and
[16:04] also after the ceiling of the 144 000
[16:06] Jews
[16:09] brother Ram did not teach this brother
[16:11] random said the seven seal starts at the
[16:14] Rapture of the Gentile Church it is the
[16:16] unknown day and hour when Jesus comes to
[16:19] snatch away the Gentile bride
[16:21] so brother Ram 7 seal starts well before
[16:23] Clarence Larkin's seventh seal
[16:27] regarding the timing of the seventh seal
[16:28] notice on
[16:30] Larkin's chart here you can see Larkin
[16:33] seven seal starts where the red
[16:36] highlight is
[16:37] and it's at about the middle of Daniel's
[16:41] first half of his 70th week
[16:44] but notice also the green highlight
[16:46] that's where brother branham's seventh
[16:48] seal starts
[16:51] and if anyone studies brother random
[16:53] seals very carefully you'll understand
[16:55] that the fifth sixth and seventh seals
[16:57] begin almost simultaneously for example
[17:01] we've heard how brother random said the
[17:03] Seven Seals the day and hour of the
[17:04] Rapture that's true immediately after
[17:07] the seven seal starts the Sixth Seal
[17:09] starts because then God goes back to
[17:12] Israel after he's raptured his Gentile
[17:14] bride off the Earth
[17:16] and the six seal as brothers also said
[17:18] was the entire 70th week of Daniel
[17:21] so right after the Rapture of the
[17:23] Gentile Church the seven seal opens it's
[17:26] the moment of the seven seal opening and
[17:28] then after the church is raptured up the
[17:30] Sixth Seal begins
[17:31] and then also sometime after the Rapture
[17:34] the souls that are under the altar in
[17:36] the fist seal cry out and say Lord how
[17:38] long until our blood is Avenged on them
[17:41] that are on the earth so that's a little
[17:43] deeper understanding on the fifth six
[17:45] and seven seals that brother gave us but
[17:47] of course also remember on the fifth
[17:49] seal those Jewish Souls included Jews
[17:52] from the time of Jesus crucifixion
[17:54] through the entire church ages including
[17:56] those Jews martyred in the Holocaust and
[17:59] then we'll include Jews that have to be
[18:01] martyred during the Great Tribulation
[18:03] period
[18:04] so here's a timeline of what brother
[18:06] random seventh seal would look like
[18:08] seven sea would open at the day and hour
[18:11] of Jesus Rapture the bride would go up
[18:13] and then the Sixth Seal would instantly
[18:15] begin which is the seven year Great
[18:16] Tribulation period
[18:18] shortly after the Sixth Seal the fifth
[18:21] seal the mapping in reality form where
[18:23] the souls would cry out for vengeance
[18:26] and then the Sixth Seal would end after
[18:27] the battle of Armageddon but the seventh
[18:29] seal would keep going on into the
[18:31] Millennium the Battle of Gaga Magog the
[18:34] great white Throne judgment and then
[18:35] time would be no more at the future home
[18:37] and that's when the seventh seal would
[18:39] end when time would be no more
[18:43] friends one reason there's so much
[18:45] confusion about whether the seven seal
[18:47] is open or not is because people don't
[18:49] understand that brother Branham said
[18:50] there's three forms to each seal
[18:53] the ram said this in the first seal he
[18:55] said quote the first seal opened the
[18:57] first seal when it was open in the
[18:59] symbol form it thundered now what about
[19:01] when it's opened in its reality form
[19:03] first is with God next it's in a symbol
[19:06] then it's revealed three things end
[19:08] quote
[19:10] so here's a simple chart I made years
[19:12] ago that show the dates of each form so
[19:15] the first seal was also the first
[19:17] Thunder of the seven Thunders the symbol
[19:20] form was given us around 90 A.D the
[19:22] reality was in
[19:24] 30 to 385 A.D and the Revelation was
[19:27] March 18 1963 when brother random
[19:30] preached it
[19:32] the second seal was also the second
[19:33] Thunder its symbol form was 90 A.D the
[19:37] reality form was through about 385 to
[19:39] 1095 A.D and the Revelation form was
[19:41] given to us on March 19 1963.
[19:45] the third seal was also the third
[19:47] Thunder the symbol form was given around
[19:49] 90 A.D to Saint John the reality form
[19:51] was about 1095 to 1906 A.D and the
[19:55] Revelation form came on March 20th 1963.
[19:58] the four seal was also the fourth
[20:00] Thunder the symbol form was given to us
[20:02] in 90 A.D from Saint John the Rowdy
[20:05] Forum was from 1906 to the present time
[20:08] and the Revelation form was given to us
[20:10] on March 21 1963.
[20:13] the fifth seal was also the fifth
[20:15] Thunder the symbol form was given by
[20:17] John in 90 A.D the reality form is still
[20:20] in the future it's right after the
[20:21] Rapture where those literal Jewish Souls
[20:24] under the altar will cry out for
[20:25] vengeance
[20:27] the Revelation form was given on March
[20:29] 22 1963.
[20:31] The Sixth Seal was also the sixth
[20:33] Thunder the symbol form was given by
[20:35] John 90 A.D the reality form is still in
[20:38] the future it is the entire seven-year
[20:40] Great Tribulation period
[20:43] and the Revelation was given on March 23
[20:46] 1963.
[20:48] now this seal the seventh seal was also
[20:50] the seventh under
[20:52] brother random observed there was no
[20:54] symbol given for the seventh seal but
[20:56] only one description the silence in
[20:58] heaven
[21:02] [Music]
[21:03] you omitted revealing even any symbol of
[21:07] the seven ones
[21:09] perfect secret with God
[21:11] notice and we're going to read in the
[21:15] Bible in the the seventh seal that's
[21:19] found in Revelations the eighth chapter
[21:22] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[21:25] there was silence in heaven about the
[21:27] space of a half hour
[21:31] and that's all we have
[21:34] the reality form is in the future it's
[21:36] the unknown day and hour of Jesus
[21:38] Rapture of the Gentile bride of Christ
[21:41] the Revelation form was given to us on
[21:43] March 24th 1963 when brother Brandon
[21:46] said he saw a fold of it was open
[21:49] and of course that was the understanding
[21:51] that it was the day and hour of the
[21:53] Rapture according to Matthew 24 verse 36
[21:56] as brother Branham quoted in the sermon
[21:59] let's listen to the quote
[22:02] notice
[22:10] Jesus never spoke of it
[22:13] John couldn't run
[22:15] Angels know nothing about it
[22:18] amen what is it
[22:20] it's the thing that Jesus said even the
[22:24] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[22:26] about it
[22:27] okay
[22:29] he didn't do it himself amen he said
[22:32] only God would know it amen
[22:34] but he told us when we begin to see
[22:36] these signs coming up right
[22:39] all right now you're getting somewhere
[22:44] and next let's compare brother Branham
[22:46] and Uriah Smith on the seventh seal
[22:49] brother Branham and Uriah Smith agreed
[22:51] that the seventh seal was the personal
[22:53] appearing of Christ on page 453 of his
[22:56] book Uriah Smith said quote the personal
[22:57] appearing of Christ must therefore be
[22:59] allotted to the next seal end quote
[23:04] nowhere brother Bynum and Uriah Smith
[23:06] differed is that Uriah Smith said the
[23:08] raptured saints were the 144 000 of the
[23:12] tribes of Israel in Revelation chapter 7
[23:14] and he said the Seal of the Living God
[23:16] was the fact that these 144 000
[23:19] Christians
[23:20] kept Saturday as the Sabbath day
[23:24] on page 443 Uriah Smith said quote we
[23:28] conclude then that the angel ascending
[23:30] from the East having the seal the Living
[23:31] God is a Divine messenger in charge of a
[23:34] work of Reform to be carried on among
[23:36] men in reference to the Sabbath
[23:38] the fourth Commandment the Agents of
[23:40] this work on the Earth are of course
[23:42] Ministers of Christ for to men is given
[23:45] the commission of instructing their
[23:46] fellow men in Bible truth end quote
[23:50] of course brother Branham disagreed as
[23:52] we've already showed brother Brandon
[23:53] believed the 144 000 were Jewish people
[23:56] or the Israelis that will accept Jesus
[23:58] Christ as Messiah and be seal with the
[24:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost in their souls
[24:02] and of course this means Uriah Smith
[24:03] believes the Rapture is after Revelation
[24:06] chapter 7 verse 2 the sealing of the 144
[24:09] 000 and that's much different than
[24:11] brother Brandon brother Brown believe
[24:12] the Rapture was before God seals the 144
[24:16] 000 Jews
[24:18] another difference is that Uriah Smith
[24:20] said the half hour of Silence was seven
[24:22] days urisma said quote the length of
[24:25] this period of Silence if we consider it
[24:26] prophetic time would be about seven days
[24:29] end quote
[24:32] now of course brother Rand never told us
[24:34] the length of the silence when the
[24:36] seventh seal opened all he told us is
[24:39] that it was Jesus coming down from
[24:40] heaven with a dead in Christ and the
[24:43] heavens had to be silent because God's
[24:45] spirit was in Christ and Christ left
[24:47] heaven to come down and Rapture the
[24:49] Saints
[24:50] so let's listen to the quote it's from
[24:52] the sardisian church age 1960.
[25:04] where is this big fell of God damn amen
[25:07] see he's in Christ
[25:11] so we conclude brother Brown did not
[25:13] plagiarize Uriah Smith on the seventh
[25:15] seal
[25:17] in closing
[25:19] friends I hope this video has been a
[25:21] blessing now we're at the total of 38
[25:23] differences between brother Branham and
[25:26] Charles Taze Russell and Clarence Larkin
[25:28] on the revelation of the Seven Seals
[25:31] so we can say without a doubt that Jesus
[25:33] the Lord Jesus Christ by his Holy Spirit
[25:36] and also through his Angel revealed the
[25:39] revelation of the Seven Seals to brother
[25:41] Branham
[25:42] let's pray again for brother Ram's
[25:44] accusers as I have not heard from any of
[25:46] them regarding my videos on these Seven
[25:49] Seals but Lord willing in the future
[25:51] I'll share them with them
[25:53] and hopefully they'll humble themselves
[25:55] and repent if not I'll keep praying for
[25:57] them by God's grace
[25:59] father God please be with brother bram's
[26:01] accusers God I pray the truth on these
[26:03] videos would be so clear that brother
[26:05] Ram's accusers would repent of their
[26:08] misinterpretations of their Slanders and
[26:11] would humble themselves in your holy
[26:12] presence
[26:13] may they do honest research and may they
[26:16] speak what is honest and true
[26:17] Lord Jesus all things are possible with
[26:19] you so Lord I ask that their hearts
[26:21] would be humbled and they could repent
[26:23] and correct their false assumptions
[26:26] their false research
[26:28] and lies about your true Prophet brother
[26:30] Branham ask all this in the Holy Name of
[26:32] Jesus Amen
[26:35] if you have any questions concerns or
[26:37] testimonies about this video please
