[0:26] youtube the video sharing company owned
[0:29] by google
[0:30] is one of the most popular websites on
[0:31] the internet it is astounding that over
[0:34] 1 billion hours of video are watched
[0:36] daily on youtube
[0:38] nearly 2 billion users access this site
[0:41] which is over a third of all the people
[0:43] on the internet
[0:45] christians should use youtube as a
[0:46] platform to spread the gospel of jesus
[0:48] christ
[0:50] through videos christians can provide
[0:52] humble direct answers to the questions
[0:54] people have
[0:55] about jesus christ and the bible
[0:59] believers should also avoid all sinful
[1:01] content on youtube
[1:03] david wrote by the holy spirit that i
[1:05] will set no wicked thing before mine
[1:07] eyes i hate the work of them that turn
[1:10] aside
[1:11] it shall not cleave to me a
[1:14] spirit-filled and spirit-led
[1:15] christian will not purposely place evil
[1:18] content
[1:19] before his eyes but rather cast down any
[1:22] video that exalts itself
[1:24] against the word of god my desire for
[1:27] outreach
[1:29] although i did not publish my first
[1:31] youtube video until october 2014
[1:34] there had been a burning desire in my
[1:36] heart to create and distribute
[1:38] christ's glorifying content since 2004
[1:42] during the 10 years leading up to 2014 i
[1:45] dreamed of spreading the truth of god to
[1:47] anyone who would listen
[1:48] it was such a burden that in 2005 i
[1:51] asked my pastor
[1:52] if we could hold special saturday night
[1:54] services in order to record
[1:56] sermons that would teach people about
[1:58] the bible he agreed and we recorded two
[2:01] audio sermons about the dangers of
[2:03] television and the two seeds
[2:05] or wheat and tares one friend of mine
[2:08] burned these audio files onto cds
[2:10] and we distributed the sermons to
[2:12] friends and strangers
[2:14] i was immediately hooked on outreach
[2:19] in 2006 i became pastor of the church i
[2:22] currently pastor in akron ohio
[2:25] one of our first ministries was copying
[2:27] and distributing audio sermons and
[2:28] teachings
[2:29] the ministry lasted for a few years and
[2:31] then stopped as our family sizes
[2:34] increased
[2:34] and caused us to focus more on
[2:36] establishing
[2:38] godliness in our growing families the
[2:40] burden to share the gospel continued
[2:42] though
[2:43] and as 2014 approached i began slowly
[2:46] tinkering with video editing
[2:48] filming and script writing i could not
[2:50] escape the deep call i was hearing to go
[2:52] beyond
[2:53] audio and create my own teaching videos
[2:56] to spread the gospel of my savior
[2:58] jesus christ in march of 2014
[3:02] after many hours of preparation i
[3:04] finally had enough courage to publish my
[3:06] first video
[3:07] on vimeo titled water baptism by
[3:10] scripture alone
[3:11] i chose vimeo because i felt it was a
[3:13] safer platform at the time
[3:16] after uploading eight more teaching
[3:18] videos i was surprised to see that i had
[3:20] not received any online abuse
[3:22] and decided i should move to a more
[3:24] widely used website
[3:25] youtube i am so thankful for the results
[3:28] i have witnessed since
[3:29] joining youtube with over half a million
[3:32] views and 6
[3:33] 000 subscribers to my youtube page i
[3:36] rejoice in the hand of god
[3:37] to spread his truth via the internet
[3:41] god has provided numerous testimonies
[3:42] that have resulted from the 50 plus
[3:45] youtube bible teaching videos i have
[3:47] uploaded
[3:48] i want you to know how the revelations
[3:50] about god's standards for a modest
[3:52] outward appearance have helped change
[3:54] lives around the world
[3:55] reaching countries i could have never
[3:57] stepped foot onto
[3:59] my prayer is that these testimonies will
[4:01] help inspire you
[4:02] to experience the life-changing power of
[4:04] jesus christ's word
[4:06] for yourself in every area of your life
[4:09] including your outward appearance
[4:11] each of us need a testimony of our own
[4:13] experience with our lord jesus christ
[4:16] in order to overcome satan and they
[4:19] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[4:21] and by the word of their testimony and
[4:23] they love not their lives
[4:25] unto the death
[4:29] testimonies most christians find
[4:32] testimonies to be an extremely powerful
[4:34] source of encouragement
[4:36] our faith is uplifted challenged and
[4:38] raised after hearing how god
[4:40] has helped another believer jesus
[4:43] christ's real presence
[4:44] is more powerfully felt when believers
[4:46] share how god faithfully
[4:48] and personally answered their pleas
[4:51] i have extracted the following
[4:52] testimonies from my youtube channel
[4:55] and email account that related to a
[4:56] modest outward appearance
[4:58] the first two testimonies though are not
[5:01] about the outward appearance but i felt
[5:02] you would benefit from hearing
[5:04] how the truths of god's word make
[5:06] believers speechless
[5:08] and save lost souls general comment
[5:11] about all the videos
[5:14] your videos play a huge role in my life
[5:16] i've got no words to say
[5:18] i've become speechless about your help i
[5:21] think i better say i love you my pastor
[5:24] ns november 2016.
[5:30] comment about the water baptism video
[5:33] your youtube channel not only helped me
[5:35] to know god better
[5:36] but also guided me to follow god's will
[5:39] hopefully your videos will save and help
[5:41] a lot more lost souls like me
[5:44] thanks to you for making those videos
[5:47] you save my soul
[5:49] dp november 2017
[5:53] make up video testimonies i fasted three
[5:57] days and asked god to show me about
[5:59] makeup and i just opened my youtube
[6:01] and here you are talking about makeup it
[6:04] was amazing
[6:05] god answered my prayer many thanks
[6:07] brother
[6:08] you really helped me i will share this
[6:10] video with other sisters
[6:12] lh september 2017.
[6:16] thank you for this video it made me
[6:17] realize there is no such thing as
[6:19] modest makeup and there are churches
[6:22] twisting verses of the bible
[6:23] to keep their members ka january 2018
[6:31] i'm not wearing makeup no more tj
[6:35] january 2018 i'm throwing away my makeup
[6:40] gm october 2017.
[6:44] thank you for this video i don't wear a
[6:46] lot of makeup
[6:47] but i'm completely done with what i was
[6:49] using
[6:50] ls october 2017.
[6:55] the argument you made based entirely on
[6:58] god's holy and perfect word
[6:59] has convinced me hl august 2017
[7:07] i need to share with you what has
[7:09] happened with me since i commented on
[7:11] this video
[7:12] as i said i was a makeup guru i loved
[7:15] how i could transform and look like
[7:17] someone else
[7:18] but god one morning shortly after i
[7:20] wrote to you god said
[7:22] why not skip the makeup this morning and
[7:24] spend that extra time with me
[7:26] i obeyed and loved it little by little
[7:29] makeup became less and less attractive
[7:31] sometimes it wouldn't even go on right
[7:34] and i would have to wash it all off
[7:36] every day i noticed how in the evening
[7:38] as it was wearing off
[7:39] my face looked worse than it did without
[7:41] any makeup on
[7:43] then one day i was reading scripture and
[7:45] the thought came to me and said
[7:47] why do you paint your face to gain man's
[7:49] approval
[7:50] so i thought and that was why i did wear
[7:53] it
[7:53] i love the attention i got and the
[7:55] compliments every week about how pretty
[7:57] i
[7:58] was i stopped wearing makeup cold turkey
[8:01] after that
[8:02] yes i felt naked and self-conscious at
[8:04] first
[8:06] i have now gone about two months without
[8:07] it and i don't miss it most days
[8:10] i don't feel naked without it either i
[8:13] don't get near the compliments
[8:15] from men or women as i used to but
[8:17] that's okay
[8:19] because that could lead me down a wrong
[8:20] path anyways
[8:22] gm july 2017.
[8:28] long dresses for women video testimonies
[8:32] i've been struggling for many years
[8:33] regarding my wardrobe
[8:35] i have read the scriptures and listened
[8:36] to opinions expressed by christians
[8:38] throughout these years regarding this
[8:40] subject i have searched the internet
[8:42] seeking for answers finally i picked up
[8:45] my phone yesterday
[8:46] and i came across pastor jesse smith's
[8:48] message
[8:49] regarding long dresses in the bible
[8:51] after listening to this message i
[8:53] cleaned out my
[8:54] closet completely i would like to thank
[8:56] you for clarifying the importance of
[8:58] dressing modestly
[9:00] i am really grateful to god and to this
[9:02] ministry for today i can say i no longer
[9:04] wish to dress as i did
[9:06] but according to the bible mc
[9:09] january 23 2016.
[9:13] two days later m.c wrote more
[9:16] she a friend from church was extremely
[9:19] happy that i shared this video with her
[9:21] once again i am very grateful to god and
[9:24] yourself
[9:24] for the impact this video has had in my
[9:27] life i was able to visit our
[9:29] neighborhood goodwill
[9:30] and purchase some skirts and dresses at
[9:32] a very reasonable price
[9:34] i shared this testimony with a family
[9:36] member and she offered to purchase some
[9:38] additional skirts
[9:39] dresses for me from goodwill on friday
[9:42] praise god god never fails mc
[9:46] january 25th 2016.
[9:52] i watched this video many months ago and
[9:54] your message left a seed inside of my
[9:56] soul
[9:57] i have been wearing skirts and dresses
[9:59] for the last few months
[10:00] and i feel liberated i cannot go back to
[10:03] wearing pants because the holy ghost
[10:05] makes me feel
[10:06] dirty thank you for putting this
[10:08] profound message
[10:09] on the internet ka january 2018.
[10:14] i truly wanted to thank you for the
[10:16] video on women dressing modestly and how
[10:18] unscriptural it is
[10:19] for females to be wearing pants you
[10:22] presented the message quite well
[10:24] and it was educational and enlightening
[10:27] in the last few weeks the lord has laid
[10:28] it on my heart to totally dress
[10:30] in modest apparel long skirts and
[10:32] dresses
[10:33] and to ditch all the pants and shorts
[10:36] what a shame that very few churches take
[10:38] a stand on modesty
[10:40] you are to be commended for speaking the
[10:42] truth in love it seems that 99.9
[10:46] of american women wear pants and don't
[10:48] give it a second thought
[10:49] it was a blessing watching your
[10:51] teachings on that subject
[10:53] i appreciate the work you put into it
[10:55] again thank you
[10:57] lf october 2016.

[11:15] thank god for this message before i used
[11:18] to cut my hair like a boy

[11:24] word

[11:32] modest clothing video testimonies i have
[11:35] just watched your video on youtube
[11:37] concerning what christians should wear
[11:39] and what the bible teaches about
[11:40] nakedness i just wanted to say what a
[11:43] good video it is
[11:44] i am tired of christians making excuses
[11:46] for exposing legs
[11:48] and other parts of themselves and trying
[11:50] to use the bible to justify it
[11:52] i was very glad to find your video which
[11:54] explains it in such a clear way
[11:57] md july 7th 2016.
[12:01] i watched the videos on your youtube
[12:04] channel about modest clothing
[12:06] immediately i was aware that i needed to
[12:07] make adjustments on the clothing that i
[12:09] currently own
[12:11] i am so blessed to have come across your
[12:13] channel by the way
[12:14] gn may 28 2017.
[12:21] thank you for delivering your message in
[12:22] a kind loving way
[12:24] it's confirmation i actually asked god
[12:28] how do you want me to dress then i
[12:30] stumbled upon your video
[12:31] glory to god ms november
[12:35] 2017 thank you dear
[12:38] i'm transformed jc september 2017.
[12:45] frequently asked questions answering
[12:49] viewers questions on my youtube channel
[12:50] has been one of the most challenging
[12:52] and rewarding experiences it is very
[12:55] challenging at times because
[12:56] i am limited in my knowledge and
[12:58] experience
[13:00] despite the uneasy feeling at the pit of
[13:02] my stomach when i read a question i've
[13:03] never heard before
[13:05] the uncertainty drives me to dig deeper
[13:08] in the word and history
[13:10] in order to find the truth as a result
[13:12] the reward is learning more about god's
[13:14] word
[13:15] which i am then able to preach to my
[13:17] congregation
[13:19] i love how this process challenges me to
[13:21] be more like the bereans
[13:23] who search the scriptures daily in order
[13:25] to know the truth
[13:28] each topic below makeup long dresses and
[13:31] hair length
[13:32] will include three or more questions and
[13:34] answers
[13:35] i try to choose the most frequently
[13:37] asked and most challenging questions
[13:40] at times the punctuation and grammar
[13:42] were edited for clarity
[13:46] makeup questions question number one
[13:50] god bless your heart for trying to
[13:51] correct the body of christ
[13:53] but the scriptures you cited spoke to
[13:55] the heart of evil jezebel
[13:57] and the rebellion of israel what about
[13:59] esther who took an entire year to
[14:01] prepare for the king
[14:03] p.s january 2018
[14:06] answer dear friend thank you for the
[14:09] respectful tone of your comment
[14:12] first the three scriptures i quoted on
[14:14] my makeup youtube video
[14:16] clearly identified face painting as an
[14:19] evil trait
[14:20] as god never asked anyone to face paint
[14:23] and all three women were under the
[14:24] judgment of god
[14:25] for their idolatry second esther never
[14:29] painted her face
[14:30] there seems to be a huge
[14:31] misunderstanding among churches with
[14:33] esther
[14:34] as she never used facial cosmetics she
[14:37] was purified using oils
[14:39] but not face painting esther cannot be
[14:42] used as an example
[14:44] to support makeup wearing as she was
[14:46] never given cosmetics
[14:48] esther 2 9 and 212 state that she was
[14:51] given
[14:52] things for purification which were oils
[14:55] of myrrh
[14:56] and sweet odors it never says she was
[14:58] given makeup to paint her face
[15:03] question two what about a lady who has
[15:06] defects
[15:07] like acne or scars from an accident or
[15:10] surgery
[15:11] what about a bad burn that can be
[15:13] covered with
[15:14] full cover foundation a little blush
[15:18] come on what about if it's your daughter
[15:21] or your wife with aging spots
[15:23] feeling ugly in front of you rc
[15:26] november 2017
[15:30] answer thank you for the questions first
[15:33] i am very happy you
[15:34] refrain from lipstick and other makeup
[15:37] second
[15:38] i would encourage those with scars to
[15:40] seek god about this topic
[15:42] but since we know god never changes so
[15:44] it would seem god would give them the
[15:46] same answer
[15:47] makeup is a heathen trait that should be
[15:49] avoided when people see their scars the
[15:52] women could use them for a testimony
[15:54] about the grace of god for keeping them
[15:56] healthy or alive
[15:58] third we teach women and men should
[16:01] never wear
[16:02] any makeup under any condition i know
[16:05] that seems harsh to you
[16:07] but we obey based upon our love for
[16:09] jesus and his holy bible
[16:11] you said a little blush is acceptable
[16:14] but to me
[16:14] i respectfully say that your words
[16:16] remind me of a little leaven
[16:18] leavens the whole lump from first
[16:20] corinthians 5 verse 6
[16:22] a little bit of sin is still sin and
[16:25] will grow
[16:26] into more sin a little bit of
[16:28] worldliness is still worldly
[16:30] we must not love the world neither the
[16:32] things that are in the world
[16:35] last if my wife or daughters feel ugly
[16:37] due to aging spots
[16:38] i will reassure them that i love them
[16:40] unconditionally
[16:42] and that they are fearfully and
[16:43] wonderfully made in god's sight
[16:46] and mine
[16:51] question number three god tells us to
[16:54] obey his commandments
[16:55] so obviously those are sins is wearing
[16:58] makeup and trousers sinful
[17:00] they're obviously out of order as god is
[17:02] an orderly god
[17:04] but are they truly sins or is it
[17:06] semantics
[17:08] just curious bj november 2017
[17:13] answer thank you for the question
[17:16] crossdressing or men wearing skirts and
[17:18] women wearing pants
[17:20] is a sin and even more an abomination
[17:23] according to deuteronomy 22 verse 5.
[17:26] makeup is a sin as well as god told
[17:29] israel not to learn the ways of the
[17:31] heathen
[17:32] in jeremiah 10 verse 2.
[17:35] make up wearing is an expression of
[17:37] pride
[17:38] also a proud look what could be more
[17:40] prideful than wearing a false face to
[17:42] impress
[17:43] others is an abomination according to
[17:46] proverbs 6
[17:47] verses 16 and 17
[17:53] long dresses for women questions and
[17:55] answers
[17:57] question number one pastor jesse smith
[18:00] if you have answered this before excuse
[18:02] me i don't have the strength to read all
[18:04] the comments below
[18:06] this rule of no cross dressing was made
[18:08] back in the times when men wore
[18:10] robes jesus included men and women
[18:14] wore what we would call skirts now the
[18:16] women wore head coverings and men
[18:18] covered their heads
[18:19] when they were praying or traveling in
[18:20] the heat
[18:22] so when did this rule pertain to pants
[18:24] if originally men and women
[18:26] both wore robes with belts tied around
[18:28] the waist
[18:29] pl december 2017
[18:33] answer yes the rule of deuteronomy 22 5
[18:37] was made around
[18:38] 1300 bc faithful jews have observed
[18:42] separate garments for men and women
[18:44] ever since orthodox jewish women wear
[18:47] long skirts to this day
[18:49] jesus never sinned according to hebrews
[18:51] 4 verse 15
[18:53] so we know even he kept the rule of
[18:55] deuteronomy
[18:56] 22 5. the robes in the days of jesus had
[18:59] multiple layers such as when jesus spoke
[19:02] of coats and cloaks in matthew 5 verse
[19:04] 40.
[19:05] but the robes had to have been different
[19:07] for men and women
[19:08] for god commanded a difference in
[19:10] garments from what i have read
[19:12] the women's garments were longer than
[19:14] the men's and dragged against the ground
[19:17] plus the outer robes were styled
[19:19] differently so an observer could tell
[19:21] instantly if the person was a male or
[19:24] female at first glance
[19:27] throughout all history since the days of
[19:29] moses all believers whether jew or
[19:31] christian
[19:32] have had a separation of garments for
[19:34] men and women
[19:35] as for pants men began to wear them in
[19:38] the 1600s
[19:39] and have worn them ever since women did
[19:42] not start wearing pants regularly
[19:44] until the 1970s in our judeo-christian
[19:47] culture
[19:48] the founders of the faith chose pants
[19:50] for men and dresses for women
[19:52] and god honored them by making the
[19:54] united states the greatest
[19:56] and most prosperous nation in the
[19:58] history of the world
[19:59] i believe god did this because the
[20:01] founders love christ the bible
[20:03] and holiness now the united states has
[20:06] fallen from god
[20:07] but in each culture they have the
[20:09] responsibility from god to wear separate
[20:11] garments
[20:12] since the bible does not literally say
[20:14] pants and dresses
[20:16] recently bruce jenner's decision to
[20:18] cross-dress open the eyes of the true
[20:20] bible believers
[20:22] to the need for men to dress like men
[20:24] and women to dress like women
[20:26] jenner is committing an abomination by
[20:28] dressing like a woman
[20:30] the same outcry against his immorality
[20:32] was the same outcry in the 20th century
[20:35] when women began wearing pants read the
[20:38] book
[20:38] women and pants by cynthia gregg and
[20:41] catherine smith
[20:44] question number two so if we are going
[20:46] to be consistent in using the
[20:48] deuteronomy 22
[20:49] 5 passage should we follow the same
[20:51] teaching
[20:52] with all of these other items of
[20:54] clothing like pants t-shirts socks
[20:57] underwear skirts and blouses dh
[21:00] december 2016
[21:03] answer first i would say that if you
[21:06] question the validity
[21:07] of the pants on women you need to study
[21:10] deeper into the subject
[21:11] i hope you will devote some time into
[21:13] searching for the truth
[21:15] for if you do you will find it god
[21:17] promised to reveal truth to those who
[21:19] would seek for it
[21:20] second as for every item of clothing i
[21:23] cannot say that we must make
[21:24] every item separate for the bible does
[21:27] not teach that as far as i know
[21:29] but on a personal level yes my wife and
[21:31] i do not wear any of the same clothes
[21:34] she does not wear my shirts we have
[21:37] separate socks
[21:38] and all other garments she looks like a
[21:40] woman
[21:41] and her outer garments reveal her female
[21:43] gender
[21:44] i look like a man and my outer garments
[21:46] reveal my masculine gender
[21:49] lastly think of the social disgust when
[21:51] bruce jenner came out as a woman
[21:53] in 2015. one reason this was so evil was
[21:57] because he was
[21:58] breaking deuteronomy 22 5 dressing as a
[22:00] woman
[22:01] which is an abomination the public
[22:04] discussed
[22:05] that many expressed at generous
[22:07] cross-dressing with the same disgust
[22:09] that society expressed
[22:11] when women began wearing pants in the
[22:13] 1940s
[22:14] through 1960s it is historical and
[22:17] factual
[22:18] let me know if you want the resources
[22:23] question 3 why can't pants be modest
[22:26] what about women that work out it can be
[22:29] rather dangerous to work out in long
[22:31] skirts
[22:32] i do agree with modesty i just don't see
[22:35] why it has to be long skirts all the
[22:37] time
[22:38] i can be perfectly modest and covered in
[22:40] pants
[22:41] plus most jobs that young girls can get
[22:44] entry level
[22:45] will require you to wear slacks bb
[22:48] february 2016
[22:51] answer thank you for the comment first
[22:55] pants on a woman can technically be
[22:56] modest loose
[22:58] or not tight and covering the loins
[23:00] thighs
[23:01] and lower legs but yet there still must
[23:04] be a separation in men and women's
[23:06] garments
[23:07] according to deuteronomy 22 5 so we do
[23:09] not believe women should ever wear pants
[23:12] technically a dress on a man could be
[23:14] modest but the fact the man would be
[23:16] wearing garments pertaining to a woman
[23:18] would break the word of god
[23:20] and be wrong second i know numerous
[23:22] women who work out in full length skirts
[23:25] it is only dangerous if a person
[23:27] participates
[23:28] in dangerous exercises i think the
[23:31] wisdom of god would tell our hearts
[23:33] to not endanger our bodies and avoid
[23:36] exercises that are dangerous
[23:38] surely you can find alternative
[23:40] exercises that are less dangerous
[23:42] and get the same results third
[23:46] it has to be long skirts for women all
[23:48] the time because god said so
[23:50] jesus kept all the law and never sinned
[23:54] he honored all the old testament
[23:56] including deuteronomy 22
[23:58] 5 all the time jesus wore garments that
[24:01] pertained to men
[24:02] all the time we should follow his
[24:05] example wouldn't you agree
[24:07] fourth if a job required a woman to wear
[24:10] men's clothes
[24:10] she should look elsewhere for a job in
[24:12] order to honor god's word
[24:15] any job that required a believer to
[24:16] disobey the commands of god
[24:18] would not be in the plan of god for
[24:20] their life i believe
[24:22] if we honor god god will honor us and
[24:25] provide a job for us
[24:26] as he is jehovah jireh our provider
[24:33] hair length questions question number
[24:35] one
[24:37] how about if the ends of the hair are
[24:39] split
[24:40] frazzled or damaged is just trimming
[24:42] those ends to encourage a woman's hair
[24:44] to grow even longer
[24:46] and healthier an exception cm
[24:49] august 2017 answer
[24:53] friend we do not find any trimming of
[24:56] women's hair in the entire bible
[24:58] from cover to cover from genesis to
[25:00] revelation
[25:01] at our church we teach that a woman is
[25:03] not instructed to cut trim
[25:05] or shave any hair from her head because
[25:08] we never see god
[25:10] instructing godly obedient women to do
[25:12] so in the bible
[25:14] also there are some differing opinions
[25:16] that trimming hair keeps hair healthy
[25:19] i have heard from numerous christian
[25:20] women who never trim their hair
[25:22] that say their hair is healthier because
[25:24] they do not trim the split ends
[25:26] hair must be taken care of and cared for
[25:29] daily
[25:30] so as not to encourage breaks having a
[25:32] healthy diet and lifestyle will also
[25:35] limit the amount of split ends
[25:37] at our church we simply teach the bible
[25:39] which never gives any godly woman the
[25:41] command to cut or trim her hair
[25:44] in any way
[25:48] question number two how long do you
[25:50] think a man's hair is allowed to be
[25:52] what would you say is the maximum length
[25:55] cb
[25:56] december 2017 answer
[25:59] that's a good question sir i would say
[26:02] the longest hair length for a man would
[26:03] be to the neck or shoulder area
[26:06] but that is just my own idea recall that
[26:08] jewish priests were to have short hair
[26:11] and paul commanded christian men to have
[26:13] short hair according to ezekiel 44
[26:16] 20 and first corinthians 11 verse 14.
[26:19] as men we always want to make sure we
[26:21] are the leaders in holiness and modesty
[26:24] men's hair must show that there is a
[26:25] separation between male and female
[26:28] that is why i recommended that men in
[26:30] our church cut their hair
[26:31] quite short so that their male gender is
[26:34] instantly perceived
[26:35] by those that look at them
[26:40] question number three um didn't jesus
[26:43] have shoulder length hair
[26:45] e m november 2017
[26:50] answer we do not know the exact length
[26:53] of jesus's hair
[26:54] but again even shoulder length hair on a
[26:56] man is not
[26:57] uncut hair uncut hair is what god
[27:00] commands for all women
[27:02] in first corinthians 11 verses 1 to 16.
[27:06] women are called to not cut their hair
[27:08] ever
[27:09] men are called in the new testament to
[27:12] cut their hair
[27:13] if you cut your hair you are obeying the
[27:15] bible
[27:16] since you are a man you should seek to
[27:18] keep your hair short
[27:19] for a woman's hair should be uncut if
[27:22] you grow your hair long and do not cut
[27:24] it
[27:24] you are disobeying the bible god wants
[27:26] women to have
[27:27] uncut hair so the shorter the hair that
[27:30] men have
[27:31] the more different they will look than
[27:32] women god wants a separation and
[27:35] difference between men and women in
[27:36] their hair
[27:37] duties in life and even outer garments
[27:40] many images of christ show him with
[27:42] shoulder-length hair
[27:44] but that length would be much shorter
[27:46] than the women of his day
[27:47] who probably had uncut hair down to
[27:50] their waist
[27:51] if not longer
[27:55] question number four is god unfair
[27:57] because i do not have long hair
[27:59] i'm an african american woman mc
[28:02] august 2017 answer
[28:07] friend god is not unfair i am sorry if
[28:10] there is a misunderstanding about my
[28:12] video
[28:12] i apologize that my video did not
[28:14] address the issue
[28:16] of how some women of different races
[28:18] cannot grow long hair
[28:20] god wants all women to have uncut hair
[28:22] no matter the race
[28:24] the actual length does not matter god
[28:27] wants women to have
[28:28] uncut hair god never asked a godly woman
[28:31] to cut her hair
[28:32] in the entire bible as long as a woman's
[28:35] hair is uncut
[28:36] we know god's word is kept and fulfilled
[28:39] god is pleased with women as long as
[28:41] they do not cut their hair god is not
[28:44] asking
[28:45] for 12 inches of hair length 24 inches
[28:48] or any other specific number of inches
[28:51] he is
[28:51] only asking for uncut hair the most
[28:58] frequently asked question after
[29:01] answering hundreds of questions
[29:02] on youtube and via email there has been
[29:06] one question that has
[29:07] been asked more than any other in
[29:09] regards to a modest
[29:10] outward appearance the question has been
[29:13] asked in various ways
[29:14] but at its core can be stated as the
[29:17] following
[29:18] since the bible says that god looks upon
[29:20] the heart and not the outward appearance
[29:22] why should i care about my outward
[29:24] appearance
[29:26] the question is suggesting that first
[29:28] samuel 16 verse 7
[29:30] teaches christians should not worry
[29:32] about the outward appearance
[29:34] but that is certainly a misapplication
[29:36] of scripture
[29:37] which states but the lord said unto
[29:40] samuel
[29:40] look not on his countenance or on the
[29:43] height of his stature
[29:44] because i have refused him for the lord
[29:47] seeth not as man seeth
[29:50] for man looketh on the outward
[29:51] appearance but the lord looketh
[29:54] on the heart at first glance
[29:57] this question might seem to have some
[29:59] validity but the wisdom of the holy
[30:01] spirit gives us
[30:02] at least three reasons why first samuel
[30:05] 16
[30:06] 7 does not excuse christians from having
[30:08] standards
[30:09] for their outward appearance first
[30:12] this question has taken first samuel 16
[30:16] verse 7
[30:16] out of context and applied it in a way
[30:19] that god did not intend
[30:21] in context first samuel 16 verse 7 is
[30:24] god's correction to his prophet samuel
[30:26] about how he chooses a king samuel was
[30:29] in bethlehem
[30:30] at jesse's to anoint the next king of
[30:33] israel to replace saul
[30:35] the rebellious king samuel had seen some
[30:37] of jesse's sons
[30:39] and assumed that eliab jesse's oldest
[30:42] son
[30:42] would be the lord's anointed or future
[30:44] king based upon his physical stature
[30:48] but the faithful god corrected samuel by
[30:50] letting him know that he did not choose
[30:52] kings based upon their countenance or
[30:54] height
[30:55] god revealed that he chose kings based
[30:57] upon the condition of their hearts
[30:59] and david was a man after the heart of
[31:01] god
[31:02] the context of first samuel 16 verse 7
[31:05] is not about makeup
[31:06] hair length separate garments for men
[31:08] and women or modest clothing
[31:11] a bible teacher anointed of the holy
[31:13] spirit would rightly divide
[31:14] first samuel 16 verse 7 and place it in
[31:17] its
[31:18] proper context which is god's
[31:20] requirement when choosing a righteous
[31:22] king
[31:23] applying first samuel 16 verse 7 to say
[31:25] that god is not interested in our
[31:27] outward appearance
[31:28] would be a complete misapplication
[31:32] second first samuel 16 verse 7 cannot
[31:36] disall
[31:37] or negate the numerous commands of god
[31:39] elsewhere in scripture
[31:40] about our outward appearance remember
[31:43] first timothy 2 9
[31:45] paul commanded women to wear modest
[31:47] clothing he lived around 1 000 years
[31:50] after samuel and still commanded
[31:52] christian women to wear modest clothing
[31:55] there's no record of paul writing that
[31:56] christians do not need to care
[31:58] about their outward appearance since god
[32:01] cared only about their hearts
[32:03] remember first corinthians 11 verses 1
[32:06] to 16
[32:07] paul taught that it is a shame for a man
[32:09] to have uncut hair
[32:11] and for a woman to have trimmed hair i
[32:13] could keep reminding you of all the
[32:15] scriptures
[32:16] from previous chapters in this book that
[32:18] command believers to conform their
[32:20] outward appearance
[32:21] to god's loving preferences but i will
[32:24] stop here because i trust
[32:25] that the holy spirit has shown you the
[32:27] heir of using first corinthians 16
[32:30] 7 to give people a license to present
[32:33] themselves with a worldly
[32:35] sinful outward appearance
[32:38] third the outward appearance often not
[32:41] always
[32:42] reveals the condition of the heart and
[32:44] the bible is full of examples
[32:47] cain the murdering son of the wicked one
[32:50] changed his facial countenance after god
[32:52] rejected his disobedient sacrifice
[32:55] and eventually left the presence of god
[32:57] in full rebellion to the word of the
[32:59] lord
[33:00] saul's countenance changed for the worse
[33:02] when the evil spirits were troubling his
[33:04] mind
[33:05] evil hoarse women used seductive facial
[33:08] expressions in order to
[33:10] tempt men into acts of adultery and
[33:12] fornication
[33:13] the clothing of harlots revealed their
[33:15] occupation
[33:17] the maniac of gadaro was naked because
[33:19] of the influence of the legion of demons
[33:22] inside of him
[33:23] based upon these five examples it would
[33:25] be foolish to say god does not care
[33:28] about the outward appearance
[33:32] of course the outward appearance does
[33:34] not always reveal the true condition of
[33:36] the heart
[33:37] as the pharisees proved during the
[33:39] earthly ministry of the lord jesus
[33:40] christ
[33:41] jesus said that these evil wicked
[33:44] hypocritical
[33:45] children of hell had a clean beautiful
[33:48] outward appearance
[33:49] but were full of dead men's bones this
[33:52] truth is evident today
[33:54] as many of the world's major religions
[33:56] require that their leaders
[33:57] and followers dress modestly and yet
[34:00] their idolatry
[34:01] hatred and rejection of the gospel of
[34:03] jesus christ
[34:05] proves that they too are the children of
[34:07] hell the spiritual children of their
[34:09] father
[34:10] the devil undoubtedly
[34:13] god cares much about the outward
[34:15] appearances of his children
[34:17] as i have demonstrated through the
[34:18] scores of scripture
[34:20] cited in this book's previous chapters
[34:23] god does
[34:23] indeed look upon our heart condition but
[34:26] our obedience to or rejection of the
[34:28] rightly divided word of god
[34:30] reveals our heart condition to those
[34:32] around us
[34:33] let us obey the bible's doctrines about
[34:36] our outward appearance
[34:38] from the heart but god be thanked
[34:41] that ye were the servants of sin but ye
[34:44] have obeyed
[34:45] from the heart that form of doctrine
[34:47] which was delivered you
[34:52] conclusion god is still spreading his
[34:55] word through many channels
[34:57] one of which is youtube just as the
[35:00] printing press of the 19th century
[35:02] drastically increased spreading the
[35:04] truth of god's word
[35:05] today the internet does the same
[35:09] along with the spread of truth though
[35:11] comes questions
[35:12] which the vigilant christian will be
[35:14] prepared to answer
[35:16] the holy bible has all the answers we
[35:18] need for the questions people have
[35:20] about the way of holiness if we search
[35:22] the scriptures as jesus commanded
[35:25] as the bereans modeled we will find the
[35:27] life-giving answers to all inquiries
[35:30] about the ways of god this is why
[35:33] regular church attendance is absolutely
[35:35] necessary
[35:36] for a genuine christian paul taught that
[35:38] the five preaching gifts in the house of
[35:40] god
[35:41] would answer all of our questions
[35:43] bringing believers to completion and
[35:45] stability in the faith
[35:47] david the man after the heart or will of
[35:50] god
[35:50] had the same respect for the house of
[35:52] god david knew god's faithfulness in
[35:55] revealing his will
[35:56] to his people in the house of god he
[35:59] knew god would reveal his will through
[36:01] the teaching of his word
[36:02] in his house saying one thing have i
[36:05] desired of the lord
[36:07] that i will seek after that i may dwell
[36:09] in the house of the lord all the days of
[36:11] my life
[36:12] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[36:14] inquire in his temple
[36:17] we know god does the same today as we
[36:19] gather in our churches
[36:20] and feast upon the preaching of truth
[36:24] while i am thankful for the internet
[36:25] helping to spread the gospel
[36:27] i know it is a secondary tool of god the
[36:30] lord's primary tool
[36:32] is live preaching with the anointing and
[36:34] power of the holy ghost
[36:36] as jesus commanded in the great
[36:37] commission the disciples
[36:39] obeyed this command preaching the gospel
[36:42] and the lord worked with them
[36:43] giving them supernatural signs our
[36:46] church will continue to do the same
[36:48] and experience the same results by god's
[36:52] grace
