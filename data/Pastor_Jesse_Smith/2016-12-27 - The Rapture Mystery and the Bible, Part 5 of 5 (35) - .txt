Description:
In Part 5, this video series concludes by teaching on the "HOW" of the rapture - how the rapture will be done. The rapture will be done by the power of Jesus Christ through a shout, voice, and trump as seen in 1 Thessalonians 4:16. The "shout" is in progress now and the voice of the archangel and trump of God are coming to resurrect the sleeping Christians and empower a body change for the living Holy Ghost-filled Christians.
