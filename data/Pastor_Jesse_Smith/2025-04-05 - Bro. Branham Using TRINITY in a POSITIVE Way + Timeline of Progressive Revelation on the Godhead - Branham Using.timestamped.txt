[0:03] But now the true trinity of God being
[0:07] one manifested in Christ who was life.
[0:10] God in a trinity is one and without a
[0:14] trinity he's not God.
[0:17] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:21] this video is to show quotes from God's
[0:23] prophet brother William Brandham where
[0:25] he uses the word trinity in a positive
[0:27] manner. And this video will also show a
[0:30] general timeline for his growth in the
[0:33] revelation on the Godhead. Here's just
[0:35] four quick points before we get into
[0:37] that chronological list of quotes. The
[0:40] first point is that we admire brother
[0:41] Ram's growth in the knowledge of God. As
[0:44] second Peter says, we must grow in grace
[0:47] and the knowledge of the Lord. So we can
[0:49] see individually here, brother Ram
[0:50] received revelation from God about who
[0:53] God is. God is one person, not three
[0:55] persons. Initially, brother Bram
[0:57] believed God was three persons, but then
[1:00] he received greater revelation and
[1:01] realized God is one person. And then
[1:03] brother Ram calls it the capstone
[1:05] revelation of the Godhead that Jesus is
[1:08] God. And he says that in the church age
[1:10] book. Of course, this is also important
[1:13] part of the church ages. The church ages
[1:15] started off with a full revelation, but
[1:17] then it was slowly lost, especially the
[1:19] revelation on the godhead and water
[1:21] baptism. But then it began to be
[1:23] restored. By the sixth church age, the
[1:25] Philadelphia church age, they had held
[1:27] fast to the name of Jesus Christ. And
[1:30] then in the seventh church age, the full
[1:32] revelation of the Godhead and water
[1:34] baptism was restored by the gracious
[1:37] plan of God. So we must look at our
[1:39] lives the same way. We are going to
[1:40] continue to grow in grace and knowledge
[1:42] of the Lord Jesus Christ. God is going
[1:44] to give us more information about the
[1:46] same revelations as brother M taught in
[1:49] the church age book. Second, this video
[1:51] will show again how ridiculous it is for
[1:53] people to say that every word on Brother
[1:55] Ram's tapes are thus sayith the Lord.
[1:58] That's a lie. That's heresy. As we're
[2:00] going to show here in 1951, Brother Ram
[2:03] said he loved the third person of the
[2:05] Trinity, the Holy Ghost. But then by
[2:07] 1961, he says three persons is of the
[2:10] devil with thus sayeth the Lord. And
[2:12] it's so sad, as some of my videos have
[2:14] showed, the current Brandom Tabernacle
[2:15] believes every word is thus sayith the
[2:17] Lord. So they're enslaved in heresy.
[2:20] They're trapped in heresy. Here's a
[2:21] screenshot of an email I received from
[2:23] the pastor from September 17th, 2020.
[2:28] And I said, "Could you please ask Joseph
[2:30] if he believes the third person of the
[2:32] Trinity burns in his heart?" As brother
[2:33] M said in 1951. And I got a reply from
[2:36] Joseph. He said, "Dear brother Smith, I
[2:38] believe every word he spoke on the tapes
[2:40] for it's the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:42] Hebrews 13:8."
[2:44] So, this is a
[2:46] non-answer, but based upon the way it's
[2:48] written, it seems like he believes that
[2:51] brother Brandham loved the third person
[2:53] of the Trinity. And so, I don't know
[2:55] what that means. Does that mean Joseph
[2:56] loves the third person of the Trinity? I
[2:58] don't know. So, this topic again proves
[3:00] that not every word on the tapes is thus
[3:03] sayith the Lord. Brother Bram was a
[3:04] human. He had human opinions, his own
[3:06] human thoughts. Brother Brham said he
[3:08] wasn't infallible. So true believers
[3:10] will not get under the anointing that
[3:12] idolizes brother Brandham and the words
[3:15] on the tapes of brother Brandham. They
[3:17] will stay free from that antichrist
[3:19] spirit. The third point is that the
[3:21] trinity doesn't pertain to salvation
[3:24] since it's a mystery according to
[3:25] Colossians
[3:27] 2. It's the mystery of God and of the
[3:30] father and of Christ. Now, of course,
[3:32] some are going to disagree with me and
[3:33] they're going to use a quote from 1965,
[3:36] anointed ones of the end time where Bram
[3:38] said, "If you don't believe Jesus is
[3:40] God, you're lost." But it depends on how
[3:42] you interpret that quote because there's
[3:44] lots of trinitarians who believe Jesus
[3:46] is God. They don't believe he's a second
[3:48] God. They believe he's a second person,
[3:50] but not a second God. They're not
[3:52] outright tritheists or they're not into
[3:56] trism. They're just confused. They don't
[3:58] understand the revelation. And brother
[4:01] Ram said, "It takes a real revelation to
[4:02] understand the Godhead." I was asked
[4:05] about this quote in my 2020 debate with
[4:07] Rod Bergen. And my answer was that this
[4:10] quote where brother Ram says,
[4:11] "Trinitarians are lost." This was just
[4:13] Brother Ram's human opinion. There's no
[4:14] thus sayith the Lord attached to it.
[4:17] Because you have previous quotes where
[4:18] Brother Ram says, "He believes they're
[4:20] saved." And that's what this video will
[4:22] show as well by God's grace. And even in
[4:24] the 1961 sermon where brother Ram twice
[4:27] said, "Thus sayith the Lord,
[4:28] trinitarianism is of the devil twice,
[4:30] brother Ram said that trinitarians can
[4:32] be saved." In fact, he said, "I believe
[4:34] that many thousands of trinitarian
[4:37] people who believes in three gods is
[4:39] saved because they don't know any
[4:41] difference." So, brother Ram left this
[4:43] window open for God's mercy and grace to
[4:45] extend to people when they don't know
[4:47] better. But once they hear the truth,
[4:48] then they are accountable to that. And
[4:51] consider that Martin Luther and John
[4:52] Wesley were trinitarians, church age
[4:55] messengers. And I know the revelation
[4:57] wasn't available in their day, but God
[4:58] still winked at their ignorance as the
[5:00] Bible says. And God will wink at
[5:02] ignorance until the person receives the
[5:05] knowledge of the
[5:06] truth. I thought it might be important
[5:08] just to run over a list of these major
[5:10] and minor topics that Brother talked
[5:12] about. In the quotes on majors and
[5:14] minors, I can only find one major topic
[5:18] that brother Ram talked about and that
[5:19] was salvation through faith in the blood
[5:21] of Jesus Christ. Every other quote on
[5:24] tape makes every other subject a minor.
[5:27] Such as brother Ram said, "Divine
[5:28] healing is a minor. Dancing, shouting,
[5:31] speaking in tongues are minors. The
[5:33] coming of the Lord, whether the Lord
[5:35] comes with a cloud or another way, he
[5:37] said that doesn't pertain to salvation."
[5:39] Brother Ram said communion doesn't
[5:41] pertain to salvation. And brother Ram
[5:43] seeing uh sensations like oil in your
[5:45] hands and seeing rainbows and all kinds
[5:47] of sensations. He says all sensations
[5:49] are minors. Now there is one quote in
[5:52] the church age book where brother talks
[5:54] about major doctrines such as godhead,
[5:56] water baptism etc. So the church age
[6:00] book has major doctrines. But nowhere in
[6:02] the church age book does brother Ram say
[6:04] a person can't be saved that doesn't
[6:06] have the revelation of the godhead in
[6:08] water baptism. So that's why I still
[6:11] believe trinitarians can be saved
[6:13] because in most cases they're ignorant
[6:15] of the truth. They just don't understand
[6:17] it. And perhaps that's what they were
[6:18] called to be. Perhaps they were called
[6:19] to be foolish virgins in the mind of God
[6:22] before the foundation of the world. God
[6:23] has wise virgins and foolish virgins.
[6:26] God has holy people, wise virgins or
[6:29] righteous people, foolish virgins.
[6:31] And now the fourth point, let's look at
[6:33] the positive uses of the word trinity by
[6:35] brother Bram. There's lots of them, but
[6:37] I just have three simple examples. In
[6:38] 1960 in Abraham, brother Ram said,
[6:40] "Everything in the Bible is a trinity."
[6:42] And then he goes through your body,
[6:44] soul, spirit. You live in three rooms,
[6:47] kitchen, living room, bedroom. Brother
[6:49] Ram said, "God is a trinity. Father,
[6:51] son, holy ghost is a trinity." And then
[6:54] there's three comingings of the Lord.
[6:55] Brother said, "Christ comes in a trinity
[6:57] to redeem his bride, to receive his
[7:00] bride, and then to rule and reign with
[7:01] his bride in the millennium." Let's
[7:04] listen to the quote. See, everything in
[7:06] the Bible is in a trinity. You know
[7:08] that. I said the other day, you're in a
[7:09] trinity. Soul, body, and spirit. You
[7:11] live in a trinity. The kitchen and the
[7:14] living room, the bedroom. You might have
[7:16] eight or 10 different rooms, but
[7:17] bedrooms and spare this, but you only
[7:19] live in three rooms. God, Father, Son,
[7:22] Holy Ghost, and a Trinity. And we find
[7:24] out the coming of Christ is in the
[7:26] trinity. He came first to re redeem his
[7:29] bride. Comes next to receive his bride.
[7:31] Come next with his bride is king and
[7:33] queen to reign through the millennium.
[7:35] You know that everything is in a
[7:38] trinity. And we are in a trinity. We
[7:40] have a mortal body, a glorified body uh
[7:44] I mean a celestial body and then a
[7:46] glorified body. Three stages brings us
[7:49] back to our perfection again. like in
[7:52] Eden.
[7:54] Second, in April 1965, Brother Ram calls
[7:58] God, quote, "The true trinity of God
[8:01] being one manifested in Christ." End
[8:03] quote. So notice Brother Ram's words
[8:05] here. The true trinity of God is Father,
[8:08] Son, Holy Ghost. But he uses Trinity in
[8:10] a different way. I went online and
[8:13] looked on Miam Webster's website, and
[8:16] there's three definitions of the
[8:17] Trinity. The second one is what Brother
[8:19] Ram's using. It's a group of three
[8:21] closely related persons or things. Not
[8:24] persons. Brother Ram is not saying God
[8:26] is three persons. Brother Ram is saying
[8:27] God is three closely related things or
[8:30] manifestations is the key word because
[8:32] those are the words the Bible uses. 1
[8:34] Timothy 3:16 said God was manifest in
[8:37] the flesh. So the son is a
[8:39] manifestation. Then 1 Corinthians 12
[8:41] says the manifestation of the spirit or
[8:42] the holy ghost is given to us to profit
[8:44] with all. So God appears in our lives as
[8:48] the Holy Ghost, Christ in us, the hope
[8:51] of glory. So here's the quote. It is the
[8:53] rising of the sun, 1965, the true
[8:55] trinity of God. Let's listen to the
[8:57] quote. But now the true trinity of
[9:02] God, being one, manifested in Christ who
[9:06] was light and broke the seals and
[9:09] conquered the enemy and rose up the one
[9:12] true and living God.
[9:15] I am he that was dead and I'm alive
[9:19] forever more has the keys of death and
[9:22] hell
[9:24] God in one made man and dwelt among us
[9:28] and conquered every enemy
[9:32] and it proved that the trinity of Satan
[9:35] was conquered and that the trinity of
[9:37] God was made known because only God
[9:39] alone had power to bring life back
[9:42] again. He was that Emmanuel.
[9:47] God had been manifested in the flesh.
[9:52] Then third and finally and in knoweth
[9:54] and not August 1965, brother Ram said
[9:56] that's God. Quote, God in a trinity is
[9:59] one. And without a trinity, he's not
[10:01] God. He can't be manifested any other
[10:03] way. End quote. And then brother Ram
[10:06] shows how we are as humans three parts.
[10:09] Body, soul, spirit. And remember, we're
[10:11] made in the image of God according to
[10:12] Genesis chapter 1. So we have three
[10:15] parts to us or three elements to us, but
[10:17] we're not three persons. We're one
[10:19] person with three elements or aspects to
[10:21] us. And so is God. God is one person who
[10:25] manifests himself in three ways. Father,
[10:27] Son, Holy Ghost. So let's listen to the
[10:29] quote from knoweth not. That's
[10:33] God. God in a trinity is one. And
[10:37] without a trinity, he's not God. You
[10:40] can't be manifested any other way. And
[10:42] neither can you be manifested without
[10:44] being the Trinity person that you are.
[10:47] That's body, spirit,
[10:50] soul. Without either one of them, you're
[10:53] not complete. Amen. See, if you didn't
[10:56] have a soul, you'd be nothing. You
[10:58] didn't have a spirit, you wouldn't be
[11:00] nothing. If you didn't have a body, just
[11:03] be a spirit, not a body. So God is
[11:06] complete in the
[11:08] triunityity of a being. Not triunityity
[11:12] of beings but one being in a
[11:15] triunityity. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
[11:17] is one true manifested God.
[11:21] Now let's look at a brief timeline of
[11:24] quotes on the Godhead from Brother Bram
[11:26] to show his revelation. In 1961, Brother
[11:29] Ram's talking about when he first got
[11:31] baptized, which would have been around
[11:33] 1931 or 1932, depending on your
[11:35] timeline. And brother Ram said before he
[11:38] even heard of the oneness, twist,
[11:39] threeness, four gods, whatever they got,
[11:41] I believe there was one God. And I
[11:43] believe that his name was Jesus. And I
[11:44] was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[11:46] by a missionary Baptist preacher cuz I
[11:49] asked him to do it. I've preached it
[11:51] ever since. So when brother was
[11:52] baptized, he didn't even know about all
[11:54] the Godhead debate. He just said, "I
[11:56] want to be baptized in the name of
[11:57] Jesus." Let's listen to the quote. When
[11:59] I was just a boy, before I ever heard of
[12:02] one, two, three gods, four gods, what
[12:05] they got, I believe there was one
[12:07] God. Now, I believe that his name was
[12:10] Jesus. And I was baptized in the name of
[12:12] Jesus Christ by a missionary Baptist
[12:14] preacher because I asked him to do it.
[12:16] I've preached it ever since. There's no
[12:18] scripture in the Bible. You bring me one
[12:20] scripture where anybody was ever
[12:21] baptized in any other. Show me one place
[12:24] in the Bible where anybody's ever
[12:25] baptized using the titles of father,
[12:27] son, holy ghost.
[12:30] Now in 1950, we have the first third
[12:32] person quote where brother talked about
[12:34] a third person of the trinity. It's in
[12:36] God and his people in Little Rock,
[12:38] Arkansas. So it seems Brother Ram
[12:40] believed in three persons. Let's listen
[12:42] to the quote. Lord God came down that
[12:45] third person out into the flesh again
[12:48] and live tonight in his people.
[12:50] Hallelujah.
[12:53] God himself, God the Holy Ghost living
[12:57] in his
[12:59] people. And I think I said the wrong
[13:02] year earlier. I said 1951, but it's
[13:04] actually 1952 where brother Ram said he
[13:06] loved the third person of the Trinity.
[13:08] This is from Early Spiritual
[13:10] Experiences, Hammond, Indiana. Brother
[13:13] Bram said, "We love him, that great
[13:14] third person of the Trinity who burns
[13:16] through our hearts." This is the quote I
[13:17] asked brother Joseph about and he said,
[13:18] "I believe. I believe everything on the
[13:20] tape is a revelation of Jesus Christ."
[13:22] Let's listen to the quote. Truly, we're
[13:25] not much in this world. We're looked
[13:26] down
[13:27] upon, but God, we believe we're accepted
[13:30] in Christ Jesus, and he in return has
[13:33] given us the Holy Ghost. We love him.
[13:36] That great third person of the Trinity
[13:38] who burns through our hearts, and we
[13:41] love him.
[13:43] Oh holy spirit I thank you for your
[13:46] divine leading. Now then we fast forward
[13:49] to July 1960. This is one of the final
[13:51] times brother Ram talks of the third
[13:53] person in a positive manner. It's from
[13:55] what it takes to overcome all unbelief
[13:57] our faith in
[13:59] Washington. Brother Ram says now
[14:01] remember that Jesus I'm talking about is
[14:02] the third person which is the Holy
[14:04] Spirit which is in us God in us. Let's
[14:06] listen to the quote as to be here with
[14:09] us tonight in each one of us. Now
[14:12] remember the Jesus I'm talking about is
[14:15] the third person which is the Holy
[14:17] Spirit which is in us. God in
[14:21] us. Now we get to the definitive sermon
[14:24] from 1961 Revelation 4 part 3. Here's
[14:27] where brother A says trinitarianism is
[14:29] of the devil with thus sayith the Lord
[14:31] and then repeats it. He says it the
[14:33] first time in paragraph 174 and then he
[14:35] repeats it again in paragraph 177. And
[14:39] we're going to listen to this quote and
[14:40] listen twice where he says trinitarians
[14:42] can be saved. He said, ' Do you believe
[14:45] all these people that are trinitarians
[14:46] are of hell? No sir, I believe they are
[14:48] Christians. And then down in paragraph
[14:51] 178, I believe that many thousands of
[14:54] trinitarian people who believe in three
[14:55] gods is saved because they don't know
[14:58] any difference. So very important quote
[15:00] here. Brother Ram comes out publicly
[15:01] with thus sayeth the Lord. This is not
[15:03] brother Ram speaking. This is God
[15:05] speaking. But then he offers grace to
[15:07] those trinitarians who don't know
[15:08] better. Let's listen to the quote. Now
[15:11] my precious brother, I know this is a
[15:13] tape also. Now don't get excited. Let me
[15:17] say this with godly
[15:19] love. The hours approach where I can't
[15:22] hold still on these things no more. Too
[15:24] close to coming. See,
[15:28] trinitarianism is of the devil.
[15:32] I say that. Thus saith the Lord. Amen.
[15:36] Look where it come from.
[15:39] It come from the Nyan council
[15:43] when the Catholic Church become in
[15:45] rulership. The word trinity is not even
[15:48] mentioned in the entire book of the
[15:50] Bible.
[15:53] And as far as three gods, that's from
[15:56] hell. There's one God.
[16:00] It's exactly right. Now do you say then
[16:04] you believe it all these people as
[16:06] trinitarians are of hell? No sir, I
[16:08] believe they are
[16:10] Christians. But the hour is approaching
[16:13] brother where they are sincerely wrong.
[16:18] I ask in brotherly love for any person
[16:22] that hears me on this tape around the
[16:26] world that will come to me and show me
[16:31] one text of scripture or
[16:35] one paragraph in any history that's
[16:39] authentic
[16:40] history where that any person was ever
[16:43] baptized in the name of the father son
[16:45] and holy ghost until the organizing of
[16:47] the Catholic church, I'll change my
[16:49] doctrine.
[16:52] Thank you, Lord.
[16:55] Every person was baptized in the name of
[16:57] Jesus Christ. And my precious brethren,
[17:01] your eyes are blinded to those
[17:04] things. Pray God give you life. Now, if
[17:07] you got scripture to support it, I'll be
[17:09] looking for you're listening for your
[17:11] call.
[17:13] [Music]
[17:14] You're you beyond this tape, you're
[17:18] willfully walking in spiritual ignorance
[17:21] if you don't challenge me on that.
[17:27] You want to know what's light and what's
[17:28] dark? Let's ask God.
[17:31] Remember, I say, "Thus saith the Lord."
[17:34] Amen.
[17:36] Oh, blessed be. If you be me to be his
[17:39] servant, and if that wasn't according to
[17:40] the word, it would be wrong. Then if it
[17:43] is according to the word, it's your duty
[17:45] to come straight in the
[17:49] See what
[17:50] happens. It's a era. I believe that many
[17:55] thousands of trinitarian people who
[17:58] believe in three gods is saved because
[18:01] they don't know any difference. We're
[18:03] going to get to that on down in the
[18:04] message.
[18:06] The next quote I want to show is one
[18:07] month later in February in Long Beach,
[18:10] California. Brother Brandham shows
[18:12] respect to trinitarians. Now, this is an
[18:14] interesting quote because the month
[18:15] before he blasts trinitarianism as of
[18:18] the devil, but a month later when he's
[18:19] outside of his home church in his
[18:21] congregation, he shows grace to them and
[18:24] he says that's fine that you call the
[18:26] Holy Ghost the third person of the
[18:27] Trinity. So, one month before he said,
[18:29] "It's thus sayith the Lord, it's of the
[18:30] devil." But then a month later says,
[18:32] "It's fine if you're trinitarian." So
[18:34] again, I believe this is why
[18:36] trinitarians are saved because brother
[18:37] Ram had grace and mercy on them when he
[18:39] would go and preach in their own
[18:41] congregations, not in his own church.
[18:43] But he showed respect to congregations
[18:45] that were not his own. Let's listen to
[18:47] the quote. Then that same word, Christ
[18:50] the promise, the Holy Ghost,
[18:53] you call it the third person of the
[18:54] trinity. That's fine. That's what it is.
[18:57] Christ the Holy Ghost in you.
[19:00] He was in a pillar of fire once.
[19:03] that he come as made flesh. Now he's
[19:06] come in your flesh. The next quote is
[19:09] this anointed ones the end time where I
[19:11] was asked about it in the debate and
[19:13] brother Ram said you put him a third
[19:15] person, second person or any other
[19:16] person besides God, you're lost. And so
[19:19] again, I have to balance this quote with
[19:20] the other quotes. This quote has no thus
[19:23] sayith the Lord. But I believe Brother
[19:24] Ram is making a valid point. If someone
[19:26] says Jesus is the second person and they
[19:29] say he's not God, then I believe that
[19:31] person would be lost because they're
[19:32] denying the deity of the Lord Jesus
[19:34] Christ. They're just making Jesus just
[19:36] like a regular human prophet. But he was
[19:38] more than a prophet. He was a God
[19:40] prophet, the God prophet. So I think you
[19:42] have to balance this quote out with all
[19:44] the other quotes. It has to agree with
[19:45] the other quotes. There's no thus sayith
[19:47] the Lord here. Let's listen to the
[19:48] quote. He said, "Mr. Brandon, we refuse
[19:52] all revelations."
[19:55] I said, ' Then you have to refuse Jesus
[19:56] Christ, for he is the revelation of God.
[20:02] God revealed in human flesh, unless you
[20:05] see it, you're lost.
[20:07] Jesus said, "Except you believe that I'm
[20:09] He, you'll die in your sin."
[20:13] He is the revelation of God, the spirit
[20:16] of God revealed in human form.
[20:20] You can't believe that, you're lost. If
[20:22] you put him a third person, second
[20:24] person, or any other person besides God,
[20:26] you're lost. Except you believe that I
[20:29] am he, you'll die in your sins.
[20:33] Revelation. And now, lastly, I'll skip
[20:35] ahead to the church age book here in
[20:38] chapter one. Brother Ram says, "It takes
[20:39] a real revelation from the Holy Ghost to
[20:41] see the truth about the Godhead." So
[20:44] again, Brother Ram says, "It takes a
[20:45] real revelation." And remember, in the
[20:47] church age book, Brother M never says
[20:49] all trinitarians are lost. Let's listen
[20:52] to the quote.
[20:54] I admit that it takes a real revelation
[20:56] from the Holy Ghost to see the truth
[20:58] about the Godhead these days when we are
[21:00] in the midst of the perverting of so
[21:02] much scripture. But the prevailing
[21:04] overcoming church is built on
[21:06] revelation. So we can expect God to
[21:08] reveal his truth to us. However, you
[21:11] actually don't need a revelation on
[21:12] water baptism. It is right there staring
[21:15] you in the face.
[21:18] The final quote is from chapter nine,
[21:20] the lessian church age. Brother Ram
[21:22] says, "We have come back to the capstone
[21:23] revelation, the most important
[21:25] revelation of Godhead in the whole
[21:27] Bible. That is Jesus is God. He and the
[21:30] father are one. There's one God and his
[21:32] name is the Lord Jesus Christ."
[21:33] Beautiful quote. Now, I do think some
[21:35] people take this quote too far. I don't
[21:37] believe Brother Ram is saying that the
[21:38] Godhead is the most important revelation
[21:41] in the whole Bible. I believe salvation
[21:44] is the greatest revelation in the whole
[21:45] Bible. Faith in the blood of Jesus
[21:48] Christ is the most important revelation.
[21:50] We are saved by grace, not of works,
[21:52] lest any man should boast. Brother
[21:54] continually said, "Salvation is a major
[21:57] doctrine because it's eternal
[21:59] redemption. It's eternal salvation." And
[22:02] then here's four quotes that came to my
[22:04] mind just now. First, Brother Ram said,
[22:06] "The greatest thing is being saved."
[22:08] This goes along with how salvation is
[22:10] the greatest revelation. Brother Ram
[22:12] said, "The greatest desire any of us can
[22:14] have is to be saved." Because we saw it
[22:17] with Sister Hadtie. Her greatest desire
[22:19] was to see her boys saved. In the third
[22:21] quote, Brother Ram said, "What would be
[22:22] greater than the assurance that we're
[22:24] saved?" So, nothing is greater than the
[22:26] assurance or faith that we're saved, and
[22:28] faith is a
[22:29] revelation. And then in 1963,
[22:32] Perseverance, Brother Ram said,
[22:33] salvation is the greatest miracle. Let's
[22:35] listen to the four quotes. In our mind
[22:39] lays hundreds of great things that you
[22:41] have done. And the greatest of all we
[22:45] can think of is when you saved us from a
[22:49] life of death where in us dwelt death
[22:52] because of sin and trespasses.
[22:56] I said, "Sister Hattie, just say
[22:57] whatever you want to." She said, "The
[22:59] greatest desire in my heart is my two
[23:00] teenage boys that they may be saved." I
[23:02] said, "I give them to you in the name of
[23:04] Jesus Christ." It's the overlap right
[23:08] there. All such thing has
[23:11] happened that thou can't
[23:13] believe. Do you love him with all your
[23:15] heart? Isn't he wonderful? What could we
[23:18] do without him? Not just what could you
[23:20] do? Could you tell me anything that
[23:22] would be greater? If you can show me
[23:24] something greater than that, then I'll
[23:26] I'll I'll sell out what I got and long
[23:29] for that that you show me that's greater
[23:31] than this.
[23:33] Uh this is the greatest thing that I
[23:34] know of. To know with the assurance that
[23:37] we are saved to know that the very God
[23:39] that made the heavens and earth would
[23:41] humble himself and come down and dwell
[23:43] among us and do for us. God's done
[23:46] something for you. He saved you. That's
[23:50] the greatest miracle there is.
[23:53] And then there's so many quotes where
[23:55] brother Ram says trinitarians can be
[23:56] saved. So this quote about the capstone
[23:59] revelation, the most important
[24:00] revelation of Godhead in the whole
[24:02] Bible. So to me, brother Ram's saying
[24:05] the revelation that Jesus is God is the
[24:07] most important Godhead revelation. I
[24:10] don't believe Brother Ram's talking
[24:11] about the Godhead being greater than
[24:12] salvation. So that's just my own humble
[24:14] opinion. That's just my own thought.
[24:16] Please correct me if I'm wrong because
[24:18] all the other quotes from Brother Ram
[24:19] say salvation is the most important
[24:22] major doctrine, major revelation. And so
[24:26] many quotes say trinitarians can be
[24:28] saved. Let's listen to the quote.
[24:31] And now in this last age, we have come
[24:33] back to the capstone revelation. The
[24:35] most important revelation of Godhead in
[24:37] the whole Bible. That is Jesus is God.
[24:41] He and the father are one. There is one
[24:44] God and his name is the Lord Jesus
[24:47] Christ. He is the God of the Amen. He
[24:50] never changes. What he does never
[24:53] changes. He says it and it stands fast.
[24:57] One final quote from the church age book
[24:59] is that brother Ram says when the mark
[25:01] of the beast is literally laid down in
[25:03] the tribulation period he said the mark
[25:05] in the head means that they will have to
[25:06] take the doctrine of the world church
[25:08] system which is trinitarianism
[25:10] etc. So this is what I believe brother
[25:13] was talking about in 1961. There's going
[25:14] to come a time where we can't hold back
[25:16] anymore. There's going to come a time
[25:18] when believing the trinity will actually
[25:20] get someone lost. But that time is not
[25:22] right now. It will be during the great
[25:24] tribulation period. But thank God by the
[25:26] promises of God, those who are baptized
[25:28] with the Holy Ghost will be gone in the
[25:29] rapture. They won't be here during the
[25:31] great tribulation period. So let's
[25:32] listen to that quote. It's from chapter
[25:34] 10 of the church age book, a resume of
[25:36] the ages. Let's listen to the
[25:38] quote. This mark in the head means that
[25:41] they will have to take the doctrine of
[25:43] the world church system, which is
[25:45] trinitarianism, etc., and the mark in
[25:48] the hand, which means to do the will of
[25:50] the world church. With this great power,
[25:53] the church systems will persecute the
[25:55] true bride. This image will try to keep
[25:57] the bride from preaching and teaching
[25:59] etc. Her ministers will be forbidden to
[26:02] give comfort and truth to the people who
[26:03] need it. But before the antichrist in
[26:06] person takes over this complete world
[26:09] system of churches, the true church will
[26:11] be taken away from this world to be with
[26:13] the Lord. God will catch away his bride
[26:16] for the great marriage supper of the
[26:17] lamb.
[26:20] In closing, friends, I hope this video
[26:21] was a blessing by the grace of God,
[26:23] seeing the positive uses when brother
[26:25] Ram uses the word trinity in a positive
[26:27] light. It's also great to see how a
[26:29] prophet of God can grow in revelation.
[26:31] And of course, we can see that in the
[26:32] Bible. Every prophet grew in revelation.
[26:35] Every prophet made human mistakes. Every
[26:37] prophet needed the grace of God. Every
[26:40] prophet needed revelation, continual
[26:42] life-giving revelation from the Lord
[26:44] Jesus Christ. And brother Random meets
[26:46] that same qualification. He's a sinner
[26:48] saved by grace. But of course, a mighty
[26:50] prophet, the Leosian church age
[26:52] messenger, the prophet to the seventh
[26:54] church age, the prophet anointed with
[26:56] the spirit of Elijah to turn our hearts
[26:58] back to the apostolic fathers. So we
[27:00] rejoice in the revelation that Jesus
[27:02] Christ has given to us through the
[27:04] prophet brother William Mary and
[27:05] Brandham. Praise God for the revelation
[27:08] of who Jesus is. He's the first and the
[27:10] last as brother Bam taught in the church
[27:12] age book as the book of revelation
[27:14] teaches. So the first church age had the
[27:16] revelation of Jesus Christ. So does the
[27:19] last church age. We have the revelation
[27:20] of Jesus Christ that he is God manifest
[27:23] in the flesh. Not a second person but
[27:25] the one person of the Godhead. If you
[27:28] have any questions, concerns or
[27:30] testimonies about this video, please
[27:31] contact
[27:33] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[27:36] be the desire of your
[27:39] heart. Very happy to be here this
[27:41] afternoon and again in defense of the
[27:43] gospel of Jesus Christ. to bring the
[27:46] good tidings, the good news that Jesus
[27:48] raised from the dead, living among man
[27:50] today, his church. The same Jesus that
[27:54] was yesterday will be today and
[27:56] forever. He's never failed.
