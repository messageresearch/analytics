[0:03] let the Holy Spirit search her Minds
[0:05] with the words you'll agree with the
[0:08] message that's just one or two things
[0:10] that mention when there's hundreds of
[0:14] them greetings friends in the matchless
[0:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:19] purpose of this video is to show Bible
[0:21] proof that followers of the bible-based
[0:24] revelations that God gave to brother
[0:26] brandham are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[0:29] and I say this is humbly I believe we
[0:31] have absolute Bible proof that we are
[0:34] the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ by
[0:36] the grace of God and of course by the
[0:39] scripture my name is Jesse Smith I'm
[0:41] pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship
[0:43] here in akan Ohio for the past 17 years
[0:46] and I defend the Bible revelations that
[0:48] God revealed to his Prophet his genuine
[0:50] Prophet brother William brandham 1909 to
[0:53] 1965 and I also defend William branham's
[0:56] Godly Christian genuine
[0:58] character the inspiration for this video
[1:01] came about 3 years ago when I finished
[1:03] writing my 2021 book The 12 New
[1:06] Testament Mysteries revealed Rapture
[1:08] wisdom for Christ's bride in chapter 4
[1:11] specifically I show The Mystery of the
[1:13] Holy Ghost filled church as the Bride of
[1:15] Jesus Christ and since then I've had
[1:17] this thought numerous times that that
[1:19] chapter helps prove by the Bible that
[1:22] there is a genuine group who is the
[1:24] Bride of Jesus Christ they are the Holy
[1:27] Ghost filled Christian believers who who
[1:30] follow the Bible revelations that Jesus
[1:32] revealed to his Prophet brother brandham
[1:34] this video kind of ties in with the
[1:36] previous videos I did on why I am a
[1:38] message believer Parts 1 and two and
[1:41] also ties in with a recent sermon I
[1:43] preached on Christmas Eve
[1:46] 20123 room for Jesus before I preached
[1:49] that Christmas text I share this thought
[1:52] about the hundreds of differences
[1:53] between the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:56] all the other Christian churches I was
[1:58] reminded of this thought
[2:00] this idea of absolute proof we are the
[2:02] Bride of Jesus Christ when I listen to
[2:05] The Invisible Union of the Bride a
[2:07] sermon brother branam preached in
[2:08] November
[2:10] 1965 in this sermon from brother
[2:12] brandham he was giving a hypothetical
[2:15] situation where someone would say that
[2:17] message you're preaching brother brandom
[2:19] is wrong and brother randam then says
[2:21] look at yourself so the criticizers of
[2:24] brother brandham the critics of me and
[2:26] other faithful message Preachers by the
[2:28] grace of God he said look at yourself
[2:30] let the Holy Spirit search your minds
[2:33] with the word of God and you agree with
[2:35] the message so the critics of brother
[2:37] brandham and the critics of true message
[2:40] Believers would agree with the message
[2:42] if they actually looked at their Bible
[2:44] with an honest heart brother Bram said
[2:46] let the spirit get into you see if
[2:48] that's right or not and brother Bram was
[2:50] talking about was water baptism in the
[2:53] name of the Lord Jesus Christ right or
[2:54] not and you reference acts 238 well any
[2:58] accuser or critic of brother brandham if
[3:00] they just open up their Bible they would
[3:01] know that that is the correct water
[3:03] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:05] Christ because all five examples of
[3:07] baptism from the book of Acts include
[3:09] either Lord Lord Jesus or Jesus
[3:12] Christ and Colossians 3:17 says we
[3:15] should do all things in the name of the
[3:17] Lord Jesus Christ so the revelation of
[3:19] the Bible is that there's only one name
[3:21] to be baptized there's one name to the
[3:23] father son Holy Ghost that's the Lord
[3:25] Jesus Christ and then brother Ram said
[3:27] that's just one of the things he
[3:29] mentioned when there's hundreds of them
[3:32] in other words there's hundreds of true
[3:33] doctrines that are right in the message
[3:36] and then that means there's hundreds of
[3:37] false doctrines in all other churches
[3:40] and that's the truth that's what I
[3:41] emphasize in chapter 4 of my 2021 book
[3:45] then brother Ram just gives a few more
[3:46] examples does the bible agree with women
[3:48] bobbing their hair no does the bible
[3:51] agree with three baptisms in the title
[3:54] father son Holy Ghost no does the bible
[3:57] agree with women wearing men's clothing
[3:59] no no brother Braham said well just take
[4:01] them three there when there's hundreds
[4:04] of them search it out in the light of
[4:06] God's word and that's what brother Ram's
[4:08] accusers will not do they will not be
[4:10] honest and search out the scriptures
[4:12] with an open heart and agree with the
[4:15] Bible revelations the true Bible
[4:17] revelations that brother Randon was
[4:18] teaching the people so I'll play the
[4:20] short version of this quote and then at
[4:22] the end of the video I'll play the full
[4:24] version of this quote let's listen to
[4:26] the quote in Arizona and everyone you're
[4:29] at look at yourself for a few
[4:31] minutes you say that message you're
[4:33] preaching brother brandom is wrong look
[4:35] at yourself a little
[4:37] bit let the Holy Spirit search your
[4:40] minds with the
[4:43] words you'll agree with the
[4:46] message let Christ the anointed word
[4:49] search out your own
[4:51] conscience let him get into you see if
[4:53] that's right or not that's just one or
[4:55] two things that mention when there's
[4:57] hundreds of
[4:58] them does a Bible agree with the woman
[5:00] bobbing her hair no does the bible
[5:03] believe agree with three baptisms in the
[5:06] name of father son Holy Ghost no such a
[5:08] thing does the bible agree with woman
[5:10] wearing man's clothing I just take them
[5:13] three there one these hundreds or more
[5:16] search it out in the light of God's
[5:19] word also here at the beginning I do
[5:21] want to say that each false Doctrine is
[5:24] leaven or sin it's an evil spirit in the
[5:26] church Paul even calls one false
[5:29] Doctrine a canker or a flesh eating
[5:31] disease and so all the churches outside
[5:34] the message that break some of these
[5:36] Bible commands these Bible teachings
[5:39] have a cankerous disease or they have
[5:42] leaven in their Church sin in their
[5:44] church and so of course they cannot be
[5:47] the Bride of Jesus Christ the more
[5:49] leaven or the more false doctrines the
[5:51] worse spiritually the church is also
[5:54] love how brother R said the Antichrist
[5:56] refuses the true bride Doctrine so
[5:58] notice the bride ofes Jesus Christ has
[6:00] true Bible Doctrine brother Ram said the
[6:02] Antichrist opposes the spiritual bride
[6:05] the word so notice the spiritual bride
[6:07] is in the word all the way as brother
[6:09] Ram said in other places the baptism of
[6:12] the Holy Ghost makes you in the word all
[6:14] the way let's listen to those
[6:16] quotes the Antichrist refuses the true
[6:21] bride Doctrine and therefore he takes
[6:24] his own bride now and builds her up
[6:27] under a Creed of his
[6:31] own takes his own bride and makes her a
[6:35] denomination she gives birth to other
[6:39] denominations as quoted in this Holy
[6:42] Scripture gives birth to
[6:45] daughters and
[6:49] um she don't she becomes just like her
[6:52] mother natural worldly
[6:56] denomination opposing the spiritual
[6:59] bride the
[7:00] word make no mistake about it a person
[7:03] that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost
[7:06] into the body of Christ receiving the
[7:08] fullness of the spirit will be in the
[7:10] word all the way that is the evidence of
[7:13] being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas
[7:16] failed multitudes fail right there and
[7:20] when they fail to go on in that word
[7:22] their names are taken off the Book of
[7:24] Life 2 John 1: 8 and9 back this up verse
[7:29] 9 especially says whoever transgresseth
[7:32] and abideth not in the doctrine of
[7:34] Christ hath not God he that abideth in
[7:37] the doctrine of Christ he hath both the
[7:39] father and the son as some of my videos
[7:42] have showed in the past it's sad when
[7:43] message preachers say we don't need
[7:45] doctrine or doctrines not to be
[7:47] emphasized the Bible actually says the
[7:49] opposite the Bible says if you have the
[7:52] true Doctrine or as brother ramam said
[7:54] true bride Doctrine from the Bible you
[7:57] have both the Father the invisible
[7:58] spirit and the son Jesus Christ the body
[8:01] of God the high priest in other words
[8:03] you have a true relationship with God
[8:05] Almighty if you have the true Doctrine
[8:08] that's why the Bible says God gives
[8:09] double honor to those men who labor in
[8:12] Doctrine remember also brother Braham
[8:14] said balum and Moses had the same
[8:16] anointing both could prophesy correctly
[8:19] the difference was Moses's teaching or
[8:22] Moses's Doctrine so that's what
[8:24] separated the two anointed ones in Moses
[8:26] day that's what will separate the two
[8:28] anointed ones in this day
[8:29] the true bride of Christ will have the
[8:31] true anointing of God Supernatural signs
[8:33] Miracles and wonders and also true
[8:35] teaching or true Doctrine here's the
[8:39] outline for the video first we'll look
[8:41] at the portion from my 2021 book from
[8:44] chapter 4 proof that we are the
[8:47] bride remember friends no accuser of
[8:50] brother Brenham has read my 2021 book to
[8:53] try to refute it they say because it's
[8:56] false so why should they spend their
[8:58] time on it why could say the same about
[9:00] their nonsense and their lies and their
[9:02] slander and their propaganda but yet I
[9:04] still listen to it in order to debunk it
[9:08] and to defend the true Gospel of Jesus
[9:10] Christ that he revealed to his Prophet
[9:12] brother brandham and to defend brother
[9:14] bram's Christian character second then
[9:16] I'll give a list of over 100 Bible and
[9:19] Pauline doctrines brother brandham
[9:22] restored to the true bride of
[9:24] Christ third I'll close and then fourth
[9:27] I'll play the full length of the quote
[9:29] from the invisible
[9:31] Union let's begin with the proof we are
[9:34] the bride from chapter 4 of the 12 New
[9:37] Testament Mysteries revealed the entire
[9:40] fourth chapter would be a benefit to
[9:42] listen to and study by the grace of God
[9:44] as I go through all the scriptures in
[9:46] the Bible that speak of Jesus having a
[9:47] bride and then showing how the gospel
[9:50] blueprint cannot be changed as Paul
[9:52] taught in Galatians 1 6-12 and then
[9:54] here's where we show the proof that the
[9:56] bride has all of Paul's Doctrine
[9:59] like brother ROM restored to us
[10:01] beginning on page 185 I go over the
[10:04] bride submissive character to every word
[10:06] of Christ so if we take Ephesians 5:22
[10:10] through 33 Paul shows how a natural
[10:14] bride should respect her husband and of
[10:17] course if we take the spiritual
[10:18] application of this the true bride of
[10:20] Jesus Christ will respect Jesus Christ
[10:23] her husband in the same
[10:25] manner so the first attribute is that
[10:28] the the true bride of Christ only has
[10:30] one headship that's from Ephesians
[10:33] 5:23 and so the message churches who are
[10:35] born again have only one headship that's
[10:38] Jesus Christ the word the bride's only
[10:41] headship is the revelation of the Holy
[10:43] Bible and this is our absolute brother
[10:45] brandham is not our absolute brother
[10:47] Bram said the Bible is our absolute the
[10:50] other churches and their false doctrines
[10:52] prove they are not the bride because
[10:53] they love homosexual relationships they
[10:56] support adulterous relationships
[10:58] fornication relationships destroying
[11:00] babies through birth control pills they
[11:03] allow women preachers they allow
[11:04] substance abuse they allow sinful
[11:07] viewing of movies and television shows
[11:10] they allow shameful hair lengths they
[11:12] allow false conversions teaching only
[11:14] one work of Grace and they allow
[11:16] immodest clothing all those false
[11:19] doctrines break Paul's gospel and
[11:22] remember Paul said if you change one
[11:23] word of it those were 10 words of it
[11:25] those were 10 commands of it if you
[11:27] break one of it you're curs cursed and
[11:29] so these people in churches outside the
[11:32] message they're either temporarily or
[11:34] permanently cursed because of their
[11:36] Disobedience and breaking of the real
[11:38] word of God now if they're ignorant God
[11:40] will have mercy on them and then if they
[11:41] want to know the truth God will guide
[11:43] them into all truth like he did with me
[11:45] he guided me out of a Baptist Church he
[11:47] guided me out of the Pentecostal church
[11:49] I was raised in because I was hungering
[11:51] and thirsting for True righteousness and
[11:54] God is not a respector person so God
[11:55] will guide any person who's hungry and
[11:58] thirsty for righteousness into the true
[12:00] word of God for their day the second
[12:02] attribute for the bride is complete
[12:04] submission in everything according to
[12:06] Ephesians 5:24 so not only is Christ our
[12:09] head but then we submit to all the
[12:12] scripture all the New Testament
[12:13] scripture that Jesus revealed to brother
[12:15] Brenham that we should obey and of
[12:18] course all brother brenham's major
[12:19] doctrines are what Paul
[12:21] preached the third attribute is
[12:23] submission to Christ's washing process
[12:27] as Ephesians 5:26 says says the bride of
[12:29] Christ today is washed By the Waters of
[12:31] the word service after service day after
[12:34] day the fourth attribute is being glued
[12:37] to or joined to Christ according to
[12:39] Ephesians
[12:41] 5:31 a man would be joined to his wife
[12:43] so we must be joined or glued to Christ
[12:46] and so that's why we stay close to the
[12:48] word of God that's why we also stay
[12:49] close to the family of God we gather
[12:51] more as we see that day
[12:53] approaching the fifth and final
[12:55] attribute is the attitude of reverence
[12:57] Ephesians 5:33
[12:59] a lot of people that have left the
[13:01] message or disbelieve the message have
[13:03] no respect for brother brandham or the
[13:05] true genuine Christians inside the
[13:07] movement of the message they claim to
[13:09] have reverence for the Bible but they
[13:11] really don't because they break all
[13:12] these commands we'll get to them in just
[13:14] a little bit by God's grace of course I
[13:16] already explained 10 of them and it's
[13:18] also seen in the way they dress when
[13:19] they go to church or even if they do
[13:21] attend church regularly or not there's
[13:23] no reverence for God then many of them
[13:25] even drink coffee during the service and
[13:27] eat during the service
[13:29] that's a lot of
[13:31] irreverence and then in chapter 4 I go
[13:33] through judging Christian groups and
[13:35] denominations by their fruits Jesus told
[13:37] us to judge righteous judgment in John
[13:40] 7:24 of course I don't judge anyone's
[13:42] Eternal destination I judge their
[13:44] current fruits based upon their Creeds
[13:46] their We Believe statements and their
[13:49] works of course as Jesus said in the
[13:51] chapter I listed the sizes of Christian
[13:53] groups Roman Catholic being the largest
[13:55] with 1.3 billion Protestant with 900
[13:58] milli million Eastern Orthodox with 270
[14:01] million Anglican with 110 million
[14:04] Oriental Orthodox with 62 million and
[14:06] all others 37 million and none of these
[14:10] groups keep all those 10 commandments
[14:12] those 10 Pauling Commandments I listed
[14:14] earlier none of them except the message
[14:17] group that's in the all others category
[14:20] and I'm talking about the message
[14:21] believers who are actually born again I
[14:23] know there are some message churches
[14:25] that are in sin those are awful churches
[14:27] I would not advise anyone to go to those
[14:29] churches if they're full of Leaven or
[14:31] full of sin and then I listed five more
[14:34] New Testament commands all those
[14:35] churches break water baptism full
[14:37] immersion and water in the name of the
[14:39] Lord Jesus
[14:40] Christ receiving the baptism of holy
[14:43] ghost in the soul the third work of
[14:44] Grace God is one person not three
[14:48] persons separate garments for men and
[14:52] women and then the supernatural power of
[14:54] all nine gifts of the Holy Ghost
[14:57] operating
[14:59] next in the chapter I go through more
[15:01] details of how the Roman Catholic Church
[15:03] cannot be the bride I list the specific
[15:06] false doctrines they hold and I go down
[15:09] that same list starting with the biggest
[15:11] groups all the way down next under the
[15:14] Protestants I show how Baptists are the
[15:16] largest Protestant groups and how they
[15:18] cannot be the bride Lutheran are the
[15:21] next they cannot be the bride 7th Day
[15:22] Adventist cannot be the bride
[15:24] Pentecostals cannot be the bride
[15:26] Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons cannot
[15:28] be the bride because of all the Bible
[15:30] commands that they break then I show how
[15:33] Eastern Orthodoxy cannot be the bride
[15:37] nor anglicans nor Oriental
[15:39] Orthodox not for one moment do I say
[15:42] there are no saved Believers in the
[15:43] groups because God has children in every
[15:46] organization anyone trusting in the
[15:48] blood of Jesus Christ is saved but if
[15:50] they hold some of these false doctrines
[15:52] what they do is deny the second work of
[15:54] Grace
[15:56] sanctification and then I show in the
[15:58] book who is the bride and where is she
[15:59] located the bride is the Holy Ghost
[16:01] filled church that follows the true
[16:03] Bible revelations of God's end time
[16:05] Prophet William brandham and she's
[16:07] located all around the world wherever
[16:09] Believers are gathered in the name of
[16:10] the Lord Jesus
[16:12] Christ now for the next section let's
[16:14] look at a list of over 100 Bible
[16:17] doctrines or Pauline doctrines brother
[16:19] brandham restored to us from St
[16:22] Paul now remember friends there could be
[16:25] hundreds of them as brother brandham
[16:26] said I only spent an hour or two working
[16:29] on this list of 110 false doctrines of
[16:32] other churches and I know cuz I have a
[16:35] Roman Catholic cism book it's at least
[16:38] 500 pages I know if I went through there
[16:40] and listed all the false doctrines there
[16:42] would be hundreds in there and then
[16:44] think if I went through the Mormon
[16:46] beliefs all the Mormon beliefs all the
[16:48] Jehovah's Witnesses false doctrines
[16:51] Pentecostals Lutheran brother brandom's
[16:54] statement would be proven true there are
[16:55] hundreds of differences between the true
[16:58] bride of Jes Jesus Christ who keeps all
[17:00] of Paul's gospel compared to all the
[17:02] other churches who break Paul's gospel
[17:05] and remember Paul said you'll be judged
[17:07] by his gospel in Romans 2:16 so we want
[17:10] to be judged now we want to be chasen
[17:12] now as Hebrews 12 says as Sons and
[17:15] Daughters of God because Jesus chastens
[17:17] all those he loves as he also said in
[17:20] Revelation 3 as many as I love I rebuke
[17:23] and chasen I want Jesus's rebukes and
[17:25] chastening now because that's one way he
[17:27] shows me as love of course he shows me
[17:29] love in so many other ways but
[17:31] correction is just one form of love so
[17:34] let's begin the first six true doctrines
[17:37] that we should preach but most churches
[17:39] reject are found in Hebrews 61 and2
[17:42] number one repentance from dead works
[17:44] most churches do not teach for believers
[17:47] to repent from their dead Works they let
[17:49] them keep sinning number two Faith
[17:52] toward God most churches have faith in
[17:54] Creeds and
[17:55] denominations then there's four types of
[17:58] baptism isms or immersion versus
[18:00] sprinkling Soul baptism the human Spirit
[18:03] baptism and the baptism of fiery trials
[18:07] a lot of churches don't teach all four
[18:10] baptisms two more doctrines of the
[18:12] laying on of hands for ordaining and
[18:14] praying for the
[18:16] sick resurrection of the Dead there's
[18:18] actually two future resurrections not
[18:20] just one and eternal judgment hell is
[18:24] not Eternal but the Judgment that God
[18:26] gives upon a soul does last last
[18:28] eternally the final sentence whether
[18:31] saved or
[18:33] lost so that's the first 10 here's
[18:35] numbers 11 through3 and these deal with
[18:38] the prophetic aspect there's a false
[18:40] Doctrine no more prophets after Jesus of
[18:43] course there are there's a false
[18:45] Doctrine no message of the hour of
[18:47] course there is there is a teaching
[18:50] there seven angels of Revelation 3 or
[18:52] seven literal men there's a teaching
[18:54] seven letters are prophetic to the seven
[18:56] Church ages each of the Seven Seals is a
[18:59] revelation from Jesus Christ to brother
[19:01] brandom so there's seven right there
[19:04] there's six verses that prophesy brother
[19:06] Ram's restoration Ministry acts 32021
[19:10] Matthew 17711 Malachi 45 and6 Luke 1730
[19:14] Revelation 10 1:7 and Amos
[19:18] 37 and all the other churches teach
[19:20] these verses
[19:22] incorrectly the seven Thunders are the

[19:36] Prophecy numbers 31 to 50 include five
[19:40] about salvation and Holy Ghost baptism
[19:42] for example the three works of Grace
[19:44] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[19:46] Jesus Christ tongues are not the
[19:48] evidence of the Holy Ghost baptism water
[19:50] baptism does not save and we're saved by
[19:53] grace through faith in Jesus blood we're
[19:55] not saved by works some Churches like
[19:58] the Catholic Church teach salvation
[20:00] through
[20:02] works there's eight doctrines about
[20:04] modesty men's hair is one women's hair
[20:06] is another makeup is forbidden high
[20:10] heels are forbidden tattoos are
[20:12] forbidden separate garments for men and

[22:09] 70 weeks the true Revelation on that the
[22:11] mark of the beast is spiritual making
[22:14] people reprobates the Bible says the
[22:16] future mark of the beast during the

[22:39] Christ
[22:40] aresh three locations after

[23:05] former and latter Reign four classes of
[23:08] Believers the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[23:10] all nine are in operation today Grace
[23:13] can be failed or rejected the Bible says
[23:16] and names can be blotted off The Book of
[23:19] Life numbers 91 through 100 are the
[23:21] spirit of Jezebel that's the fourth
[23:23] stage of
[23:24] iniquity Jesus has the keys of death
[23:28] Jesus leading captivity captive the L of
[23:31] the Pharisees are equivalent to today's
[23:34] false
[23:34] teachings the three areas of Temptation
[23:37] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride
[23:39] of life brother R's Ministry was the
[23:41] last sign to the Gentiles before the
[23:44] Rapture fasting
[23:47] almsgiving
[23:49] prayer and the second death is complete
[23:52] Annihilation so the true teaching on the
[23:54] second death I thought I gave 10 extra
[23:58] doctrines just to show how brother BR
[23:59] was right when he said there was
[24:00] hundreds I just gave you a list of 100
[24:03] so here's 10
[24:04] more every believer should have a pastor
[24:08] Mormons add an entire book to the
[24:11] Bible social drinking is
[24:14] acceptable and I know that because I've
[24:16] talking to numerous friends of mine who
[24:17] are Lutheran who believe that but of
[24:19] course that's
[24:20] wrong the future homes Revelation about
[24:23] the three works of Grace which Clarence
[24:25] Larin did not
[24:26] teach and then the four kingdoms from
[24:29] Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Daniel chapter
[24:31] 2 which were the times of the Gentiles
[24:33] and brother brandham correctly
[24:34] identified the third and fourth kingdoms
[24:37] the Bible identifies the first and
[24:39] second
[24:40] kingdoms here's five false doctrines
[24:43] related to jeffersonville's false
[24:44] movement of the tape Church movement the
[24:47] tape boys replace living preachers
[24:49] that's a lie of
[24:50] course tapes are the absolute that's a
[24:53] lie tapes are the token that's a
[24:56] lie being a part of a tape church is the
[24:59] evidence of the token that's a lie and
[25:01] they say every word on tape is thus say
[25:03] the Lord that's a lie so there friends
[25:06] is 110 true teachings that brother
[25:09] random restored from Paul's gospel the
[25:13] fact true Holy Ghost filled message
[25:15] Believers keep all 110 of these
[25:18] teachings proves they are the Bride of
[25:20] Jesus Christ because the Bride of Jesus
[25:22] Christ is submissive to Christ in all
[25:23] things in all things he wrote In His
[25:26] holy word they keep all of Paul's gospel
[25:29] that's why the multitude screamed out
[25:31] we're resting on the fact that brother
[25:33] Brandon preached what Paul preached
[25:35] that's the truth and we're thankful for
[25:37] that by the grace of God and we say this
