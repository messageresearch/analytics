TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] even the Satan our great adversary is such a smart one until he even put sometimes the church before God Satan knows how to make it attractive he's a he's a genius at his job greetings friends in the mattress name of the purpose of this video is to answer the question is the phrase dumb devil and acceptable phrase for Christians to use or is it a prideful sinful statement I believe the answer is it's a sinful prideful statement to make which is why I have not used that statement nor do I encourage anyone else to use that statement now friends I would admit anyone in comparison to God is not intelligent is not smart anyone compared to God really knows nothing so we all know Satan is nothing compared to God the Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ is infinite so that means he's infinitely greater than the devil but we don't see this prideful attitude in the scripture of Paul Peter James and John calling Satan a dumb devil and again remember friends some of these preachers that are saying dumb devil are the same ones that have called themselves the greatest preachers of all time or among the greatest preachers of all time and that is just complete utter nonsense message preachers today especially the ones that are very wealthy do not suffer in any capacity like the Saints from the Bible days it's not even close they don't sacrifice as much as the Saints from the Bible days and it's not even close so again we should pray for these ministers to repent of their pride of calling themselves the greatest of all time and they need to repent because it's basically the manifestation of the spirit of Pride again in their lives I want to begin by saying we are not to be afraid of Satan and we're not to be worried about Satan because the Bible says greater is Christ that's within us than he that's in the world and Saint Paul said I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me but the reality of it is as Holy Ghost filled Christians or Christians who are in the process of being Sanctified we do not always obey the Holy Spirit we do not always walk in the anointing of the Holy Spirit and so in those moments the enemy can tempt us and make us fall and make a spring reproach upon the holy name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we don't want that to happen and as first Peter 5 8 and 9 say we're to be alert and sober minded because the enemy is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour notice the scripture says to be alert to be cautious to be aware of the enemy and the Bible tells us to resist him standing firm in the faith and friends we know that the word of God will defeat Satan any time any place anywhere as God's Prophet brother Branham said here it is I want you to see it and get it now the word of God written word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time it's written there it is everybody wouldn't have gifts Jesus brought it down to a place where those who do not have gifts and do not have very much Faith did you say it is written there it is and stand right on that but I have noticed a trend over the last few years of certain message preachers popular famous message preachers using this phrase dumb devil and I do not believe it is an appropriate phrase to use I believe it's a prideful sinful statement to use and one evidence of that is that I've seen three of these preachers go through awful situations and I just wonder if these awful situations are the result of this prideful statement calling the devil dumb two of the situations are cancer related and one situation was a divorce situation so I believe the wisdom of God along with the quotes of God's Prophet brother Branham teach us that we have to respect our enemy of course we do not have to obey our enemy we do not have to fall to our enemy although brother Andrew said we'll sin daily we don't have to be a slave to our enemy but it's clear obviously we should not exalt ourselves in a prideful sinful way and call the devil dumb when there are no quotes in the Bible that say that and there's no quotes from Brother Branham that say that so again it's sad the preachers who say they most closely follow brother Bradham they most closely obey the Bible are saying things and doing things that the Bible does not say nor does brother Branham say I'll share a few more scriptures about what the Bible teaches regarding the enemy the Bible says Satan would hinder some of Paul's travels that's in first Thessalonians 2 Verse 18 wherefore we would have come unto you even I Paul once again but Satan hindered us so notice Paul doesn't call the devil dumb or the devil doesn't know what he's doing he admits that the enemy hindered him from coming God allowed the enemy to hinder Paul's travels and God knew Satan would do that but yet he allowed it another verse is Jude 1 verse 9 Yet Michael the Archangel and contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses thirst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuked thee so notice even Michael the Archangel showed some level of respect for Satan Satan was wondering where the body of Moses was of course we know what happened God resurrected Moses body took it up to heaven and then we know about 1500 years later he did make it to the promised land as brother Branham said and he talked with Jesus and of course Elijah was there as well on Mount Transfiguration but even Michael the Archangel would not give a railing accusation against the devil he just said the Lord rebuked thee that's why I feel like some of these message preachers have done when they call Satan dumb devil it's like a railing accusation against Satan and not even a holy Heavenly Archangel would bring a railing accusation against the enemy here's seven quotes from Brother Branham I'm going to play and in these seven quotes brother Branham literally says the opposite of what message preachers are saying today brother Brown never said dumb devil brother Brandon said Satan is smart and a genius to hear some of the phrases brother Branham used good adversary great adversary smart one satanu the Bible as good as Jesus did he's good at the job more than a match for a human being you're not a match for him he's a genius at his job so let's go through these quotes in chronological order in 1959 be certain of God by the ram said Satan our great adversaries such a smart one let's listen to the quote even the Satan our great adversary is such a smart one until he even put sometimes the church before God you might have a great church it may be a great building art may be a great denomination and again it made me a great congregation but let nothing come before God in your heart anything and before God is an idol next quote is from 1961 in uncertain sound brother random said Satan knows how to make it attractive he's a genius at his job let's listen to the quote but sin is attractive any way you take it see it as attractive to the human being because he's a subject of of the Fallen race that we are and it's attractive Satan knows how to make it attractive he's a he's a genius at his job and he if he can't get it out there in the world Affair he brings it right into the church he comes right over on our own ground that's the reason Brethren sisters we should recognize him it's time that the church was spiritual to recognize no God not by Creed not by denomination but by experience amen being filled with the Holy Ghost in the greatest battle ever fought in 1962 brother Branham said he's praying and he mentioned Satan he said I know that you're more than a match for a human being but you're not a match for my Lord let's listen to the quote [Music] of the devil foreign [Music] next in 1962 wisdom versus faith brother instead of Satan knew the Bible as good as Jesus did but it wouldn't work for Satan let's listen to the quote two great forces come together knowledge and faith Jesus knew who he was Satan knew the Bible as good as Jesus did but it wouldn't work for Satan no matter how much knowledge you have it will work now take that back to Sunday's big organization thank heaven they say well we got the word let me see it work you Catholics you say you're the original let's see it show me your Works without you or show me your words back or without your faith not straight Mindy see what the word said next in putting on the whole armor of God in 1962 brother random said he's good at the job he's a good adversary let's listen to the quote now in order to do this he has to make it very appealing reasons and that's why Satan does he's good at the job and he's a good adversary sir and he makes it appealing he had to make it appealing to you he said now look a deer uh you know you don't know what's right and wrong and uh you you must remember that if this fruit is Pleasant to the eye it it'll make one wise and all oh if that isn't a good bait and then again I'm putting on the whole armor of God LeBron said you can't do it in yourself now you're not a match for him but if you'll just just outdo it get the word in you then it'll all be taken care of let's listen to the quote talking speaking I'm working oh my that's it I'll do the do I'll do the work just let them humble himself let us empty up amen that's it you can't do it in yourself now you're not a natural but if you miss that God do it get the word in you then it'll be taken care of in closing friends hope this video has been a help I've been a blessing as I've shown over the past few years I've seen such a spirit of Pride on lots of message preachers and this is just one more manifestation of that and I could be wrong but it seems to be some connection with the preachers that use this dumb devil statement it seems like the devil is then allowed to attack them in some very serious ways but again I'm not completely certain about that I certainly don't want any of the viewers or myself or anyone to take any chances in taking a prideful attitude and exalting ourselves so highly that we underestimate our adversary when brother Ram said he's a worthy adversary and he's a genius at his job again we've got to remember first Peter 5 6-8 humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time notice God is always saying humble ourselves not pridefully exalt ourselves casting all of our care upon him for he careth for us we must be sober be villigent because your adversary that devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world see friends we got to be sober we got to be diligent sober means to be calm and collected in spirit temperate Vigilant means to give strict attention to to watch to be cautious to be active to take heed less through remission and indolence some destructive Calamity suddenly overtakes one so we don't want to get a Carefree attitude and mock Satan and exalt ourselves so highly like we're the ones who actually defeat Satan we're not it's the word of God that defeats Satan through our lips we've got to believe it yes but it's not by our own human strength it's by the word of God the anointing of the Holy Ghost friends we must steadfastly resist the enemy so it's the enemy who anoints preachers with a prideful spirit and then these preachers exalt themselves against the enemy with an evil spirit they exalt themselves against an evil spirit it's just like brother man told us that's how countries have wars the demon powers anointing one country will have jealousy or some type of bitterness or some type of Feud with another country that's Anointed with other demons and they'll go to war we know God is not the author of these wars God allows them of course it's in the sermon Victory Day 1963 brother Ram said those Spirits get jealous of one another and what do they do they cause War that's right because every nation is controlled by Satan let's listen to the quote and then those Spirits get jealous of another spirit and what do they do they call us War that's right now you see every nation is controlled by Satan the Bible said so he's a god of the Nations Satan took Jesus up top the mountain and said showed him all the kingdoms is in the world all the kingdoms and out of time and said these are mine I do with them anything I want you he said I'll give them over to you if you worship me Jesus said get behind me Satan Francis of a humble holy ghost-filled Christian Life and God will exalt Us in due time let's not exalt ourselves now like many message preachers are doing let's humble ourselves now and then God will exalt Us in his due time if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
