[0:03] Now, Brother Junior Jackson had a right
[0:06] to disagree with that. He wants his
[0:08] church, the people all want to speak
[0:09] with tongues and things IN OUR AUDIENCE.
[0:11] THAT'S BROTHER Junior's [music] uh
[0:13] troubles. THAT'S THAT'S UP TO HIM. BUT
[0:16] JUNIOR JACKSON BELIEVES THIS MESSAGE THE
[0:17] SAME AS ANY OF THE REST OF us does. He's
[0:20] one of us and it's not a dead bird to go
[0:22] there.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in [music] the
[0:25] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:28] The purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:30] viewer's question about the operation of
[0:32] gifts, especially tongues,
[0:34] interpretation, and prophecy that go
[0:36] forth during the main service. This is
[0:38] an excellent question. And so, by the
[0:40] help of the Lord, we'll look to the
[0:42] scripture [music] and quotes from God's
[0:43] prophet, Brother Brandham, regarding
[0:45] this subject. This topic is related to a
[0:48] recent video [music] I made where I
[0:50] talked about how we've only had three
[0:52] tongues and interpretations in our
[0:55] church during the entire nearly [music]
[0:57] 20 years of having a local church. One
[0:59] of the times tongues manifested, it was
[1:02] interpreted and it seemed to be from the
[1:03] Lord with two or three [music]
[1:04] witnesses. The other two times we had
[1:06] tongues. We prayed for an interpretation
[1:08] but there was no interpretation. And so
[1:10] we just rejoice that a person was
[1:11] edified and then we just wait upon the
[1:13] Lord for the next time the Lord wants to
[1:15] speak. The Bible said, "Do all speak
[1:17] with tongues?" And of course the answer
[1:18] is no. Not all speak with tongues. Not
[1:20] all prophesy. Not all are apostles and
[1:22] so forth. Let's get to the biblical
[1:24] foundation for this subject. It's in 1
[1:28] Corinthians 14 26-33
[1:31] and then verse 40. I could be wrong,
[1:34] friends, but if there's any other
[1:35] biblical New Testament text that
[1:38] outlines how to manage the gifts of the
[1:40] spirit in the local congregation, please
[1:42] let me know. I guess I'd also add verses
[1:44] 24 and 25 from 1 Corinthians chapter 14.
[1:48] But if all prophesy and there come in
[1:50] one that believeth not, or one
[1:52] unlearned, he has convinced of all, he
[1:53] has judged of all. And thus the secrets
[1:55] of his heart made manifest. And so
[1:58] falling down on his face, he will
[1:59] worship God and report that God is in
[2:01] you of a truth. So here we see a sinner
[2:04] walking into a church assembly. His
[2:07] secrets of his heart are made manifest
[2:09] and then he falls down and admits that
[2:11] God is there. That's a true operation of
[2:14] the gifts of God. But then in verses 26
[2:17] through 33 and verse 40, Paul gives more
[2:20] details on this. Now friends, again
[2:22] correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems
[2:23] like there's basically only four
[2:26] guidelines for the operation of gifts.
[2:28] The first guideline is found in verse
[2:30] 27. If any man speak in an unknown
[2:33] tongue, let it be by two or at the most
[2:35] by three and that by course and let one
[2:37] interpret. So the first guideline is
[2:41] only two or three tongues and
[2:42] interpretations or prophecies.
[2:45] The second guideline is in verse 29.
[2:48] Once those prophecies have gone forth,
[2:50] they need to be judged by judges.
[2:52] Brother Ram calls it either gifts of
[2:54] wisdom or gifts of discernment as the
[2:56] recent video showed. Let the prophets
[2:58] speak two or three and let the other
[3:00] judge. The third principle is found in
[3:02] verse 32. Verse 32 says, "The spirits of
[3:05] the prophets are subject to the
[3:07] prophets." Brother Ram uses this verse
[3:09] to establish the fact that those who
[3:12] speak with tongues, interpret and
[3:14] prophesy, can control those tongues as
[3:17] far as when they're supposed to be
[3:18] given. Brother Ram says they're not
[3:20] supposed to interrupt the preacher
[3:22] because the spirit of God is speaking
[3:23] through the preacher during the
[3:24] preaching. They have their turn to come
[3:26] after the preacher. And so they can
[3:28] control and hold that tongue
[3:30] interpretation or prophecy until after
[3:32] the spirit is done speaking through the
[3:34] preacher. Now you people speak with
[3:36] tongues and it's got gifts of tongues.
[3:39] God bless you. You're needed in this
[3:41] tabernacle. I want you here. But now the
[3:44] the things in order, don't never do it
[3:46] while the preachers are preaching. If
[3:48] you do, you're out of order. See, you
[3:50] mustn't do it. For the Bible said the
[3:52] spirit of the prophet is subject to the
[3:55] prophet. And when a man is preaching,
[3:58] he's got the floor. He's got the
[3:59] audience. The Holy Spirit's going to
[4:00] speak through him. When he's finished,
[4:02] then it's the time for the message. You
[4:04] see? So don't get out of order. If you
[4:06] do, then you interrupt and you you
[4:08] grieve the Holy Spirit, which the
[4:10] message is going forth.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; And the fourth guideline is to establish
[4:15] order. That's found in verse 40. Let all
[4:18] things be done decently and in order. So
[4:20] four simple guidelines for the operation
[4:22] of tongues interpretation. Now friends,
[4:24] anything else you want to add to that is
[4:26] a Christian liberty. Now if you say your
[4:30] way to handle gifts is the only way and
[4:33] everything else is wrong. Now you've
[4:34] become a legalist. You've added to the
[4:36] word of God. Remember lechiviousness is
[4:40] having lawlessness or no rules. The
[4:43] other extreme to that is legalism where
[4:45] you make your ways your own man-made
[4:47] traditions. You make that the unbending
[4:49] way. So it seems like from this question
[4:52] from the brother overseas that a lot of
[4:54] churches in his country have gotten into
[4:56] legalism. In other words, they say if
[4:58] you don't do gifts and operate gifts the
[5:01] way we do, you're wrong. And that's sad,
[5:04] but again, that's like the foolish
[5:06] Galatians that have brought legalism
[5:08] back into grace. And just as Paul
[5:10] wondered whether the Galatians were born
[5:12] again, well then we can wonder the same
[5:14] thing. Are these people really born
[5:15] again that are making all these
[5:17] legalistic false doctrines? Now remember
[5:20] friends, in 1957, brother Ram said,
[5:22] "Every doctrine, everything else of the
[5:24] Bible that we have in the church must be
[5:26] based upon the word of God. Must come
[5:28] from the word of God. not just one place
[5:30] but from Genesis to Revelation it must
[5:31] say the same thing because we cannot
[5:34] base our thoughts upon one little
[5:35] scripture for the Bible said in the
[5:36] mouth of two or three witnesses let
[5:38] every word be established. So we just
[5:41] established all those verses those four
[5:43] guidelines from 1 Corinthians chapter
[5:45] 14. And again as far as I know and I
[5:48] could be wrong correct me if I'm wrong.
[5:49] As far as I know, there's no other
[5:51] teachings in the New Testament that
[5:53] teach a different order of the tongues,
[5:55] interpretations, and prophecies in the
[5:57] local assembly. St. Paul set him in
[6:00] order. He said to change anything he
[6:02] preached would be a curse upon the
[6:04] person in Galatians 1:es 6-12. And he
[6:08] even says it here in chapter 14. What
[6:10] came the word of God out from you or
[6:12] came unto you only? If any man think
[6:14] himself to be a prophet or spiritual,
[6:16] let him acknowledge that the things that
[6:17] I write unto you are the commandments of
[6:19] the Lord. Now, let's get to these
[6:21] questions here. By God's grace, it looks
[6:23] like there's one 2 3 4 five simple
[6:26] questions. Now, based upon that biblical
[6:28] foundation, the first question is, are
[6:31] all gifted people required to meet in a
[6:33] separate room before the main service?
[6:35] Now, that's how brother Brandham wanted
[6:37] it. But if you go back to the scripture,
[6:38] does the scripture tell us that? The
[6:40] answer is no. So, this is an area of
[6:42] Christian liberty. If a church wants to
[6:44] have all the gifted people meet in a
[6:45] room before service, brother Brandham
[6:47] recommended that. And the reason he
[6:49] recommended that was to let the spirit
[6:52] be able to fully preach the sermon
[6:54] during the church service assembly so
[6:57] that the preacher wasn't interrupted by
[6:58] tongues interpretation and prophecy.
[7:01] Brother Bram tells us that plainly in
[7:03] questions and answers part two 1964. So
[7:06] this idea about the gifted people
[7:08] meeting in a separate room before the
[7:10] main service, that was brother Bram's
[7:12] liberty. That was his opinion. It was
[7:15] not a thus sayeth the Lord because you
[7:16] don't find that in the scripture. Nor do
[7:18] you find a thus sayith the Lord quote
[7:19] from brother Brandham. So the main issue
[7:21] is that the Bible does not mandate
[7:24] gifted people meet in a separate room
[7:26] before the service. Brother Brandham
[7:28] explained why he put the gifts in a
[7:29] separate room. Brother Ram said he had
[7:31] trouble with people with tongues
[7:34] interpretations of prophecies
[7:35] interrupting the preacher. So that's why
[7:37] he did church order in that manner. He
[7:40] said brother Junior Jackson had a right
[7:41] to disagree with him showing brother Ram
[7:44] did not have thus sayith the Lord on
[7:45] this church order preference or area of
[7:48] liberty. It's important to note that
[7:50] look brother Ram tried to let the
[7:51] tongues interpretation and prophecies
[7:54] stay out in the main service before he
[7:57] put them in a separate room. So brother
[7:59] Brand was willing to take a risk,
[8:01] willing to try something under the
[8:03] liberty of the Holy Spirit. It didn't
[8:05] work out for him. So that's why he put
[8:06] the gifts in a separate room before the
[8:08] service. And then remember, Brother Rand
[8:10] poured on a rebuke and told the people
[8:12] they ought to be ashamed of themselves
[8:14] for criticizing the way Junior Jackson
[8:16] and JT Parnell might have operated their
[8:18] churches with their gifts in a different
[8:21] manner. He really wanted to pour on a
[8:23] rebuke for people that were legalistic.
[8:26] So again, anyone who's legalistic, shame
[8:28] on you, according to brother Brandham.
[8:30] The second question was, should there be
[8:32] prophecies during the main service?
[8:36] So again, we can see according to the
[8:37] Bible, yes, they're allowed as long as
[8:39] they're done decently and in order. So I
[8:41] guess some churches will allow no
[8:44] prophecies in the main service. Well,
[8:46] that goes against 1 Corinthians 14 and
[8:48] the example we read about the prophecy
[8:51] going forth and the man falling down and
[8:53] saying, "Surely God is among you."
[8:55] Again, Brother Bram never gave us thus
[8:57] sayith the Lord, that there should never
[8:59] be a prophecy in the main church
[9:01] service. Anyone who says different is
[9:04] not saying what brother Brandham said,
[9:06] nor are they saying what 1 Corinthians
[9:07] 14 says. They're creating their own
[9:10] legalistic rule, their own man-made
[9:13] tradition. if they're saying there can
[9:14] never be prophecies in the main service.
[9:17] Third, should there be shaking of hands,
[9:20] welcoming of visitors or anything in the
[9:23] main auditorium?
[9:26] Now, I can find nothing in the scripture
[9:28] in the New Testament that specifically
[9:30] addresses this. So, I think this falls
[9:32] under the area of the sovereignty of the
[9:35] local church, the Christian liberty
[9:37] given to the pastor and the local
[9:39] assembly. So apparently some churches in
[9:42] another country are saying you can never
[9:44] welcome people. You can never shake
[9:46] hands after the service. It's so
[9:48] ridiculous. It's such a legalistic idea.
[9:51] Where does the Bible command that? The
[9:52] Bible doesn't command that. The Bible
[9:54] does say God is to be had in great
[9:56] reverence in the assembly of the saints.
[9:58] That's true. But again, 1 Corinthians 14
[10:00] says we should be able to say amen in
[10:02] the church. We should be able to say
[10:03] amen at the giving of thanks, of
[10:05] tongues, interpretations, and so forth.
[10:07] Now, there's only one service I've ever
[10:09] heard from Brother Brandham where he
[10:10] said, "Don't shake hands. Don't talk to
[10:12] anybody." It was at the end of souls
[10:14] that are in prison now. And remember,
[10:15] Brother Ram said he went to the pulpit
[10:17] with a presumption that perhaps there
[10:19] was no more time left to be saved. So,
[10:21] I'll try to find that quote and put it
[10:22] in here by the grace of God. Brother Ram
[10:24] was saying, "Don't shake hands. This is
[10:25] a serious time. Don't smile." But then
[10:28] there's many other quotes where brother
[10:29] Ram says, "Let's dismiss and shake
[10:30] hands."
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Now, not one smile.
[10:36] This is not smiling time. No. [music]
[10:39] &gt;&gt; With a deepness of sincerity.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; While that song's playing, let's shake
[10:44] hands with that. Somebody by said, "God
[10:46] bless you, Christian." With sincerity.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Here's one from 1953 at the Brandom
[10:52] Tabernacle Israel in the church. Brother
[10:54] Ram said, "God bless you." Now you're
[10:55] dismissed in God's love and blessing.
[10:57] Now, all of you members of the
[10:58] tabernacle, shake hands with these
[11:00] people here. Be sure that every one of
[11:01] you shake their hands. Welcome them
[11:03] back. May the Holy Spirit do the same.
[11:05] Now just make up. Forget all your
[11:07] differences. Make up. All right. And
[11:08] then he sings at the name of Jesus,
[11:10] bowing, take the name of Jesus with you.
[11:13] Here in the unpardable sin, 1954 in
[11:16] Jeffersonville, Brother Bram says,
[11:17] "Let's shake hands with everybody. Don't
[11:19] stand at one person very long. Just
[11:20] reach over and get another. Glad to have
[11:22] you, brother. Come back. Glad to have
[11:24] you, sister. God bless you. Shake hands
[11:26] with everybody. If you want to visit,
[11:28] you can go home and visit, but let's
[11:29] shake hands with everybody. See, go
[11:31] around and shake hands with everybody.
[11:33] then go out of the building rejoicing.
[11:35] Won't you do that? God bless you. While
[11:37] we bow our heads, Brother Ruddle, back
[11:39] there, will you dismiss us in prayer if
[11:40] you will, Brother Ruddle? So, there's
[11:43] many other examples like this. I think
[11:44] there's 28 examples that have shake
[11:47] hands and dismiss in it. So, to me, it
[11:50] seems on this issue of do we welcome
[11:52] people? Do we shake hands? It all
[11:55] depends what is going on in the
[11:57] congregation. Is it a time for
[11:59] repentance like the souls that are in
[12:00] prison time where there should be no
[12:03] talking? It's serious time. We're
[12:06] checking up on our souls or like these
[12:08] other times when you're just leaving the
[12:11] church rejoicing. Is it repentance or
[12:13] rejoicing that tells you what to do at
[12:15] the end of a service? But there should
[12:17] be no legalistic requirement where we
[12:19] never welcome, we never shake hands in
[12:22] the auditorium. Even in Ecclesiastes 3,
[12:25] the Bible said there's a time to embrace
[12:27] and a time to refrain from embracing.
[12:29] There's a time to shake hands. There's a
[12:31] time not to shake hands. That's what we
[12:32] see in these quotes from God's prophet,
[12:34] Brother Brandham. Souls that imprisoned
[12:36] now is a time not to embrace. And these
[12:38] others examples like the unpardable sin
[12:40] 54. There's a time to embrace, shake
[12:42] hands, and leave the assembly rejoicing.
[12:46] The fourth question was, is each local
[12:48] church autonomous and sovereign? The
[12:51] answer is yes, as long as they stay
[12:52] within the boundaries of the scripture
[12:53] we read, 1 Corinthians 14, and as long
[12:56] as the liberties they decide to do not
[13:00] cause anyone to stumble. So I would
[13:02] imagine it could cause somebody to
[13:04] stumble if, like brother Ram said, you
[13:06] carry on in a big long conversation in
[13:09] the auditorium. Brother Ram calls that
[13:11] visiting. Brother Ram said, don't visit
[13:13] in there. Brother Bram said, shake
[13:15] hands, greet one another, and rejoice in
[13:18] the congregation, but don't visit. Don't
[13:20] do a whole visit, a whole conversation.
[13:22] And so if people get too loose and they
[13:24] get too loud and too silly in the
[13:27] congregation, that could cause people to
[13:28] stumble, especially if there's people at
[13:30] the altar seeking God, repenting of
[13:33] their sins, praying. So you have to have
[13:36] a sensitivity to the Holy Spirit at the
[13:38] end of every service and of course all
[13:40] throughout the service.
[13:42] The last question is should every church
[13:45] say if it's good enough for Brandham
[13:47] Tabernacle then it's good enough for
[13:48] every church
[13:50] and I would say the answer to that is no
[13:52] because brother Ram said the brand
[13:54] tabernacle would lose its strength and
[13:55] it has
[13:58] the common statement should be if it's
[14:00] good enough for the book of acts church
[14:02] then it's good enough for every church
[14:04] if it's good enough for the New
[14:05] Testament Bible scriptures then it's
[14:07] good enough for us we should prove all
[14:10] things by the scripture as Paul said and
[14:12] as brother Brandham said, brother Ram
[14:13] said, "Prove all things by the
[14:15] scripture. Every doctrine must come from
[14:17] the Bible. Our standard for everything
[14:19] that we do should come from the Holy
[14:22] Bible." Brother Ram said we can't add
[14:24] one word to the Bible nor take one word
[14:26] away from the Bible. Brother Ram said
[14:28] anything that should be done should come
[14:31] from the Bible.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; So the Bible is perfectly true and
[14:34] that's what we stand on the Bible. It
[14:36] must be thus sayeth the Lord. Now, we do
[14:40] believe that God can do things that's
[14:42] not written in this word because he's
[14:44] God. He does whatever he wishes. But
[14:47] yet, I like to see anything when it
[14:49] comes in the line of a doctrine come out
[14:50] of the Bible. Amen. Because I believe
[14:53] that the Bible is the full revelation of
[14:55] Jesus Christ. The Bible said that's what
[14:57] it is. It is the revelation of Jesus
[15:00] Christ. Nothing is to be added to it or
[15:03] anything taken from it. So, I like to
[15:05] stay right into what it says and what it
[15:07] promises. If he'd just do what he
[15:09] promised, that's all I care to see
[15:11] anyhow. And I know I'll see him.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; So, in closing, friends, I'll play this
[15:16] quote from Questions Answers, part two,
[15:18] 1964, where Brother Brandon pours it on
[15:21] the people who called the members of
[15:23] Junior Jackson's church dead birds.
[15:26] Brother Brandham rebuked them because
[15:28] basically they were prideful that their
[15:31] handling of the gifts was better than
[15:32] Junior Jackson or JT Parnell's churches.
[15:36] Brother Ram said, "Shame on them for
[15:37] that." And Brother Ram said, "The
[15:39] pastors have a right to operate their
[15:41] gifts different." And Brother Ram never
[15:43] says, "Thus sayith the Lord in here." He
[15:45] said, "They're going to have trouble."
[15:46] Because that was Brother Ram's
[15:47] experience, but he didn't say, "Thus
[15:48] sayith the Lord." And again, remember,
[15:50] Brother Ram tried to let the gifts
[15:51] operate during the regular church
[15:53] service out in the congregation, but he
[15:55] found it didn't work. So, he put it in
[15:57] the main room. So, friends, it's a joy
[15:59] to have the message of the hour. Brother
[16:01] Brand pointing us back to the word of
[16:02] God. We appreciate that brother Brandham
[16:04] pointed us back to the scripture so we
[16:07] can answer questions like this from the
[16:08] scripture. We just got to make sure we
[16:10] don't get tied up into legalism,
[16:13] man-made traditions, self-righteousness,
[16:17] foolishness. But thank God Jesus said
[16:20] the Holy Ghost will guide us into all
[16:21] truth. And thank God Jesus said you'll
[16:24] know they're my disciples because of
[16:25] their love one for another. Let's have
[16:28] the love of Jesus Christ. Let's give our
[16:30] brothers Christian liberty and let's let
[16:32] the scripture be our absolute. So,
[16:34] here's the quote from God's prophet,
[16:35] Brother Brandham.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Uh, also in here, I might bring this
[16:38] out. I see my I don't think my brother's
[16:40] here tonight, but somebody made fun of
[16:43] somebody leaving the tabernacle and went
[16:45] down to brother Junior Jackson's for a
[16:47] church. Said they went down amongst the
[16:49] dead birds.
[16:51] Aren't you ashamed to make a remark like
[16:54] that? Ever who you are, if you're my kid
[16:56] here in Christ, I'm ashamed of you.
[16:59] Don't do a thing like that. JUNIOR
[17:01] JACKSON IS MY BROTHER.
[17:04] Don Ruddle is my brother.
[17:07] Well, the reason of it because when I
[17:08] set the church here in a certain order
[17:10] when I come back to see if I could get
[17:12] the manifestation of the gifts, half of
[17:14] them pulled away from it.
[17:16] Because when you would start to speak or
[17:19] preach or something, it got it was
[17:21] getting in such a place that you could
[17:22] hardly preach unless there was somebody
[17:24] spoke in tongues, somebody
[17:24] interpretation.
[17:26] And half of it never even come to pass.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Now I believe in speaking in tongues. I
[17:32] believe in interpretation. BUT IT MUST
[17:34] BE SOMETHING DIRECTLY TO THE CHURCH. NOT
[17:36] THE LORD is coming soon OR SOMETHING
[17:38] WHICH IS ALL RIGHT. BUT DON'T USE vain
[17:40] repetitions. Jesus said
[17:42] &gt;&gt; as heathens do.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; It must BE SOMETHING. GO TELL BROTHER SO
[17:46] AND SO A CERTAIN thing he done and and
[17:48] get go tell brother sister so and so
[17:50] when she did a certain thing down the
[17:52] other day, she transgressed the laws of
[17:54] her husband's the vow to her husband.
[17:56] Unless she makes this light right, the
[17:58] Holy Spirit will cut her off.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; There you've got thus sayaith the Lord.
[18:01] THEN BRING THAT SIN IN.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; That's when we got a church like it was
[18:06] when Ananas survived. Come in.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[18:09] &gt;&gt; then we got a church that stands solid.
[18:12] Oh, YOU SAID, "BROTHER BRAM, ONE GUY I
[18:14] TOLD HIM, HE SAID, WELL, YOU PUT US TOO
[18:15] MUCH ON THE SPOT." I SAID, "AIN'T I ON
[18:17] THE SPOT UP THERE?"
[18:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; THE STRANGERS ARE NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
[18:21] THAT'S RIGHT. BUT I GOT FAITH AND
[18:23] CONFIDENCE IN MY GOD WHO SENT ME TO DO
[18:25] THIS. AND NEVER ONE TIME HAS it been
[18:27] wrong or never will be as long as it's
[18:29] God.
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Right? Not speaking in tongues and
[18:34] things like that. I believe that those
[18:35] tongues and people got them gifts if
[18:37] they're real genuine Christians and
[18:38] interested in it. They'll meet
[18:40] themselves TOGETHER BECAUSE AND GIVE THE
[18:42] TONGUES and interpretations and see what
[18:44] they CAN DO TO FURTHER THE KINGDOM OF
[18:45] GOD.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT A MINISTRY OF THEIR OWN. BUT IT
[18:49] DON'T BELONG here in the middle of the
[18:50] audience where the sinners are being
[18:52] dealt with and so forth. The Bible said
[18:54] they say you're unlearned. Sometimes
[18:56] they get so irreverent with it and and
[18:58] so forth. Not our gang hadn't. But I'll
[19:00] let them go ahead a while. I said,
[19:01] "WATCH IT." NOW, I told the brethren,
[19:03] his witnesses know this. I SAID, "LET IT
[19:05] ALONE. AFTER A WHILE, I'LL we'll find
[19:08] OUT WHETHER IT'S OF GOD OR NOT. IF IT
[19:10] CANNOT STAND CHASTISEMENT, THEN IT'S A
[19:12] BASTARD CHILD."
[19:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; It's exactly what the Bible said. AND
[19:15] WHEN THE CHASTISEMENT COME, WHAT
[19:17] HAPPENED?
[19:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Did I tell you that long ago?
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Ask the pastor here. He said, "What
[19:23] about this and that?" I said, "Just let
[19:24] it alone. They're babies. WE CAN'T JUDGE
[19:27] IT, BUT WATCH WHEN IT REALLY COMES TO
[19:29] PIN DOWN TO THE WORD."
[19:30] &gt;&gt; NOW, Brother Junior Jackson had a right
[19:33] to disagree with that. He wants his
[19:35] church, the people all want to speak
[19:37] with tongues and things IN THE AUDIENCE.
[19:38] THAT'S BROTHER JUNIOR'S UH TROUBLES.
[19:41] THAT'S THAT'S UP TO HIM. BUT JUNIOR
[19:43] JACKSON BELIEVES THIS MESSAGE THE SAME
[19:45] AS ANY OF THE REST OF us does. He's one
[19:47] of us and it's not a dead bird to go
[19:49] there. Junior Jackson is a man of God
[19:52] that I love with all my heart.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; It's not here tonight so I can really
[19:56] pour it on the way I want to. And and
[19:59] Don Ruddle, I don't think Don's here
[20:00] tonight cuz they got church of their
[20:02] own. But if I seen every person COME TO
[20:04] THIS TABERNACLE, WALK OUT AND GO TO DON
[20:06] RUDDLE or or Brother JT Parnell or
[20:09] brother any of these BROTHERS HERE
[20:10] THAT'S OUR BROTHERS here and fellow
[20:12] CITIZENS OF THE KINGDOM. I'D BE SO
[20:14] HAPPY. I WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO. I'D SAY,
[20:16] "LORD, FILL US BACK UP AGAIN. LET'S POUR
[20:18] IT OUT AND FILL UP ANOTHER ONE."
[20:20] &gt;&gt; I'd love it. I'D LOVE TO SEE THOSE BOYS.
[20:23] THEY'RE MY THEY'RE MY CHILDREN.
[20:26] NOW, JT or or any of the rest of them
[20:28] don't have to believe just like I do.
[20:30] They don't have to do that. AS I TOLD
[20:32] YOU THIS MORNING, I DON'T EVEN AGREE
[20:34] WITH MY WIFE or she don't agree with me.
[20:36] [clears throat] What if I went to table
[20:38] and Junior got apple pie and I got
[20:40] cherry pie? Brother, we're both eating
[20:42] pie. We'd agree that. BUT
[20:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WE BOTH PREACH THE SAME
[20:46] GOSPEL.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; HIS CHURCH DISCIPLINE, YOU KNOW, PETER
[20:50] AND PAUL HAD DIFFERENCES.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Not in their doctrines, but the way
[20:54] Peter was behaving himself.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; They had a a little difference in it,
[20:58] but it never separated them.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; They were brothers. Well, sure, we're
[21:03] going to have differences. Not
[21:05] differences. I DISAGREE WITH ASSEMBLIES
[21:06] OF GOD. I DISAGREE WITH their sisters.
[21:09] But there's a many assembly of God. Man
[21:11] is a precious brother. I disagree with
[21:14] THE ONENESS DOCTRINE, BUT THERE'S A MANY
[21:15] OF THOSE MEN ARE PRECIOUS MAN.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; If you have any questions or concerns,
[21:19] please contact me.
[21:23] God bless you and may Jesus [music]
[21:24] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[21:30] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[21:32] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[21:36] good news that Jesus raised from the
[21:38] dead, living among man today, his
[21:40] church. The same Jesus that was
[21:42] yesterday will be today and forever.
[21:46] It never failed.
