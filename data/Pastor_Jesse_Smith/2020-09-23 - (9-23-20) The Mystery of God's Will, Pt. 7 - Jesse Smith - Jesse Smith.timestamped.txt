[30:51] [Music]
[30:58] [Music]
[31:16] so
[31:19] [Music]
[31:30] [Music]
[31:46] [Music]
[31:55] [Music]
[32:19] let's open up our bibles here
[32:23] first corinthians 12 let's continue on
[32:25] this will of god
[32:26] series we'll look at part seven here
[32:28] tonight
[32:31] i still want to do that uh kind of go
[32:33] over the debate
[32:34] uh just gotta get more time to kind of
[32:37] look at it
[32:38] been a busy week you know things at
[32:40] school are really getting busy and then
[32:41] the kids are coming back on monday so
[32:43] it's really busy there but god is simple
[32:47] and there's always enough time to
[32:49] worship the lord praise god there's
[32:51] always enough time to
[32:53] meditate on jesus praise the lord so
[32:56] first corinthians 12
[32:58] we'll look at the gifts and the lord
[33:00] willing we'll get into some of the
[33:01] rewards and consequences
[33:04] of the mystery of god's will paul said
[33:06] the mystery of god's will
[33:08] is made known to the saints praise god
[33:10] we know it's to get saved
[33:12] and to get filled with the holy ghost
[33:13] that's just a general way to say it
[33:15] god's will is holiness for without
[33:18] holiness no man shall see the lord how
[33:20] do you get holy get saved
[33:21] get sanctified get baptized and then get
[33:24] filled with the holy ghost praise god
[33:26] first corinthians 12.
[33:44] by god's grace i think i'll read uh
[33:48] why don't i read four five six and seven
[33:50] and then as a church we'll read eight
[33:52] nine and ten because those are the
[33:54] scriptures about the gifts of the holy
[33:56] spirit
[33:57] so let me read four five six and seven
[33:59] now there are diversities of gifts but
[34:02] the same
[34:02] spirit there are differences of
[34:04] administrations but the same lord
[34:07] and there are diversities of operations
[34:09] but is the same god
[34:11] which worketh all in all
[34:15] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[34:17] given to every man
[34:18] to profit with all so everyone has
[34:22] at least one gift of the holy spirit
[34:25] and as we know like jesus is parable if
[34:27] someone's not faithful with their talent
[34:29] that may be given to someone else
[34:32] the man talked about the the woman uh uh
[34:35] preacher of course
[34:36] i don't know how she got that one but
[34:38] then it went over to her husband
[34:40] uh i think we've seen in our church you
[34:42] know god's gift on piano
[34:45] transfer over to malachi i think we've
[34:47] seen that in our church just one simple
[34:49] example
[34:50] was on our previous piano player and now
[34:52] has kind of come over
[34:54] uh to malachi so we're thankful for that
[34:57] by god's grace not that our previous
[35:00] piano player locks any gift but we
[35:03] needed a gift and god supplied a gift
[35:05] praise god so
[35:07] we thank the lord for that
[35:10] so verse eight let's read eight nine and
[35:12] ten together i know it's a little bit of
[35:14] reading but let's try that we got it on
[35:15] the screen if you need it
[35:16] let's read that on three one two three
[35:19] four to one
[35:20] is given by the spirit the word of
[35:23] wisdom
[35:24] to another the word of knowledge by the
[35:27] same spirit
[35:29] to another faith by the same spirit
[35:32] to another the gifts of healing by the
[35:35] same
[35:35] spirit to another the working of
[35:38] miracles
[35:39] to another prophecy to another
[35:42] discerning of spirits
[35:44] to another diverse kinds of tongues
[35:47] to another the interpretation of tongues
[35:50] and i'll read verse 11 but all these
[35:52] worketh
[35:53] that one and the self-same spirit
[35:56] dividing to every man severally
[35:58] as he will praise god aren't you glad
[36:01] god's a god of variety
[36:03] he doesn't have everybody just operate
[36:05] the same way with healing or
[36:07] the same way with wisdom or knowledge or
[36:09] prophecy they can be different
[36:11] and there's beauty in variety let's have
[36:13] one more word of prayer if you ever need
[36:14] on your heart let's make it known unto
[36:16] god here tonight
[36:17] heavenly father lord i lift my hands to
[36:18] you i'm in need of you lord i have needs
[36:20] in my life lord and uh i have needs that
[36:23] i want to meet for the church lord god i
[36:25] want to i want you to meet their needs
[36:27] and
[36:27] we know the way to do it is through the
[36:29] preaching of the word so father i pray
[36:31] your people lord would pull on your word
[36:33] tonight lord and
[36:34] physically bless those who press their
[36:35] way out to the house of god
[36:37] bless those live streaming lord god
[36:39] those that will hear it on archive
[36:41] the father may our hearts and as paul
[36:42] said in philippians may we have one mind
[36:45] lord god may we be
[36:46] uh same minded lord
[36:49] everything lord god servant to one
[36:51] another a real body
[36:53] of christ a real church that cares about
[36:56] one another's needs lord god that we can
[36:58] do it selflessly
[37:00] by charity lord that nothing would be
[37:01] done selfishly the lord
[37:03] done by the holy spirit for lord what
[37:05] good is it to move a mountain
[37:07] if we don't have charity lord god so
[37:08] help us to have charity
[37:10] to follow uh the holy spirit charity
[37:13] and desire spiritual gifts bless us now
[37:15] in your divine presence in jesus
[37:17] christ's name
[37:18] and the saint said amen praise god god
[37:20] bless you as being seated praise the
[37:22] lord
[37:27] so let me uh just briefly real quick i
[37:29] just want to just
[37:30] look at the highlights of this chapter
[37:32] so far i took a little bit of time off
[37:34] and we had sunday off we
[37:35] really enjoyed the time with brother
[37:36] keith and i really enjoy his gift i know
[37:38] he's an older man and
[37:40] i i just love it because he's so
[37:42] different from everybody else
[37:44] talk about variety that's a good a good
[37:46] example and i love how he's
[37:48] he was telling me out there by the cars
[37:50] like brother jesse said everything i
[37:51] told is exactly the truth
[37:53] he said i've been through all those
[37:54] things and he said i need to tell him
[37:56] and i i want to tell him and i said i
[37:59] said my children
[38:00] really love your stories brother and
[38:02] they really blessed my heart too they
[38:04] really encouraged me i think of that
[38:05] man if he's 73 and he can still be out
[38:07] there preaching and he's you can tell
[38:08] each time he comes he gets a little
[38:10] slower you know walking around it's a
[38:12] little harder
[38:13] you ever see that it's kind of hard to
[38:14] them for take that step up here
[38:16] but he's still precious he's still
[38:18] pressing the battles right he ain't
[38:19] giving up he ain't quitting
[38:21] he knows god has him here for a purpose
[38:23] and he's fulfilling his purpose
[38:25] he told me out there he said i'd
[38:26] probably die if i stop preaching
[38:29] because you you lose your purpose right
[38:31] you you lose
[38:32] uh your focus and uh your purpose your
[38:35] vision in life
[38:36] and i think that's a great testimony so
[38:37] i want to keep having him back
[38:39] uh we're so blessed and my so many
[38:40] people came up for prayer so i thank the
[38:42] lord for that
[38:43] and i'm sure god answered uh some of
[38:46] those prayers i hope he did
[38:47] one of the prayers from one of the
[38:50] saints was that they would know their
[38:52] gifts
[38:52] i thought that was a great as a fitting
[38:54] request for our little series we've been
[38:56] on with the will of god
[38:58] because as we know it's god's will he he
[39:01] entrusted you with some valuable
[39:04] uh gold or silver now i imagine it's
[39:06] gold right because
[39:07] gold is deity the baptism of the holy
[39:09] ghost is deity god's spirit in you
[39:11] part of that is a gift of god right or
[39:14] gifts of the holy spirit
[39:16] so god has imparted deity in our lives
[39:20] and we want to be faithful with them and
[39:21] that's my prayer that god would help us
[39:23] all to be
[39:24] faithful with all of our gifts
[39:27] the bible said he has made known
[39:29] ephesians 1 9 he's made known to us
[39:32] the mystery of his will and it's a holy
[39:34] calling so
[39:35] the way you get holy is to get saved
[39:38] justified declared righteous right so
[39:40] there it is holy calling
[39:42] and the bible said god would that every
[39:43] man be saved and then
[39:45] the bible said let everyone who wants
[39:47] the holy ghost and everyone who wants to
[39:48] be even more holy the high calling
[39:50] come to me i'll give him the waters of
[39:52] life amen
[39:54] and so we saw god's will though means
[39:56] choice desire or pleasure
[39:59] and god first puts a desire in
[40:01] everybody's heart
[40:02] and uh he reaches out to them and he
[40:06] he he commands and uh he he
[40:09] he he desires right he requires everyone
[40:12] to reach out
[40:13] to him and respond to his love praise
[40:16] god
[40:17] and so we know god has a sovereign will
[40:18] it's going to be done unconditional
[40:21] but then we know uh god makes his known
[40:23] will to man
[40:24] through the word of god and through
[40:26] visions and dreams and then he has a
[40:28] progressive will that we
[40:29] must search out and i'm searching out
[40:32] for that tonight praise god i know
[40:33] brother cam i haven't heard update but i
[40:34] know he's searching up the next step for
[40:36] his life
[40:38] and i'm sure you are too you just want
[40:39] to know what god wants you to do
[40:41] god controls the nations he raises them
[40:44] up pulls them down
[40:46] and then he makes his will known to us
[40:49] praise god and then uh he wants everyone
[40:53] to be saved he invites everyone to be
[40:54] saved and filled with the holy spirit
[40:56] god makes known uh his will through our
[40:59] daily spiritual bible reading you know i
[41:01] read a good
[41:02] scripture today why don't i pull it up
[41:04] real quick uh
[41:05] first kings nine i don't know the verse
[41:07] but if you just pull that up
[41:08] i was just really in shocked when i read
[41:11] this
[41:12] first kings nine was my chapter this
[41:14] morning
[41:17] and the scripture says that they it says
[41:20] again that
[41:21] israel uh this is
[41:24] uh solomon's prayer the second time that
[41:27] god appeared to solomon
[41:33] let me see if i can find it uh it says
[41:36] again
[41:36] yeah now verse 20 and 21
[41:41] and all the people that were left of the
[41:43] amorites hittites para
[41:45] perazzites hivites and
[41:48] jebusites which were not of the children
[41:50] of israel their children that were left
[41:53] after them in the land whom the children
[41:56] of israel
[41:56] also were not able utterly to destroy
[42:00] upon those did solomon levy a tribute of
[42:03] bond service unto this day now
[42:05] how does that relate i just want to say
[42:07] it like this
[42:08] uh remember when god told
[42:11] joshua to take the land remember he said
[42:13] drive out all of them how many remember
[42:15] that
[42:15] you drive out the perizzites the
[42:17] amorites
[42:18] uh the canaanites he said drive them all
[42:21] out now let me look up the year on that
[42:22] real quick because that just kind of
[42:23] came to my mind
[42:29] so joshua one that just take a about 10
[42:32] seconds here hopefully i can
[42:33] find it quickly what year was that
[42:37] so joshua 1 is about wow 1451 bc
[42:41] and now solomon is praying here in 992
[42:44] bc so almost
[42:46] 500 years later 500 years later
[42:49] god tells solomon you know you've got to
[42:52] put these
[42:53] other nations on tribute because they
[42:55] didn't drive them out
[42:57] now church if you know joshua 1 god said
[43:00] every place you put the soul of your
[43:02] foot shall be your possession let me
[43:04] know what i'm talking about
[43:05] and he said the coast he said from the
[43:07] coast from the river jordan all the way
[43:08] to the
[43:09] uh the red sea and that was thus saith
[43:12] the lord so what am i trying to say
[43:14] i'm trying to say god's will sometimes
[43:16] is conditional
[43:17] god said if you can just possess the
[43:19] land if you can
[43:21] take the land and overcome by obeying he
[43:24] said you have the potential to do this
[43:27] amen and church we have great potentials
[43:29] in this day praise god
[43:30] joshua had great potentials but they
[43:32] didn't reach them all
[43:34] joshua was faithful but the the rest of
[43:36] the people they didn't reach
[43:38] uh the the borders or coast they were
[43:41] supposed to
[43:42] because many times god's will god has to
[43:44] give you your own choice
[43:46] god can't force you to do something how
[43:48] many could say amen to that
[43:50] god couldn't force israel to drive out
[43:52] all the amrites it's up to
[43:54] them and there's many so many promises
[43:57] right there's so many promises like
[43:59] repent and be baptized
[44:00] and you shall receive the holy ghost how
[44:02] many people have we seen
[44:04] walk up to that promise but then walk
[44:06] away
[44:07] the bible says if you just really repent
[44:10] and and if you just really believe this
[44:11] word
[44:12] you will receive the holy ghost and the
[44:14] promise is there
[44:15] the promise is there to possess the land
[44:17] amen
[44:18] but the people people shy away from it
[44:21] they're
[44:22] they're they're too fearful to do it
[44:23] they get comfortable in their daily
[44:24] lives
[44:25] my prayers lord don't let me be
[44:27] comfortable let me be a conqueror
[44:29] let me drive out all the amorites the
[44:31] parasites the canaanites
[44:32] the hittites the gergescites god help me
[44:35] praise god to drive
[44:36] out all the inhabitants of the land that
[44:39] i can be a real overcomer
[44:41] and i can possess all that god calls me
[44:43] to possess praise god
[44:45] amen my 500 years later church look at
[44:48] that i'm going to mark that off in my
[44:49] bible real quick here
[44:51] i'll probably reference that again
[44:55] that was 500 years before god gave a
[44:59] conditional promise
[45:02] and that was his will that was his
[45:03] perfect will if you want to do god's
[45:05] perfect
[45:05] will he told joshua's generation drive
[45:07] everybody out don't leave any left right
[45:10] don't leave any left but 500 years look
[45:13] they
[45:13] look at that church 500 years later they
[45:15] had compromised
[45:17] they were okay god's people were okay
[45:20] with compromising with sin
[45:21] is that the testimony the bride of jesus
[45:23] christ is gonna have
[45:25] i don't think so praise god i don't
[45:26] think her testimony is
[45:28] well it's okay if we smoke and drink a
[45:30] little bit
[45:31] or watch you know a little bit of
[45:32] netflix here and there or you know
[45:34] listen to a little bit of rock and roll
[45:36] or rapid
[45:37] i don't think that's going to be the
[45:38] testimony of the true bride of christ
[45:40] praise god i think the true bride of
[45:42] christ is going to be
[45:43] living by every word that proceeds out
[45:45] of the mouth of god
[45:48] glory and so i just thought i'd bring
[45:52] that back up because that's a great
[45:53] scripture i read it this morning
[45:55] it applies perfectly the will of god
[45:58] many times it's conditional god's not
[46:00] going to force us like brother ram said
[46:02] god wants to see what you're going to do
[46:04] about it praise god god wants to see
[46:06] what you
[46:06] and your freemore agency will surrender
[46:09] to him
[46:15] so again just like it joshua just like
[46:18] god bringing
[46:19] israel out and joshua leading them in so
[46:21] is the statue of a perfect man you got
[46:23] to grow up
[46:24] into the things of god you've got to
[46:25] progress in the things of god you got to
[46:28] get closer and closer to god just like
[46:30] they got closer and closer
[46:31] to the possession you and i must grow up
[46:34] into christ and get closer
[46:35] and closer in the possession and church
[46:38] that just
[46:39] that just applies to joshua as well once
[46:41] they're in the land they still got to
[46:42] drive people out
[46:43] and once we get the holy ghost we still
[46:45] got to drive habits out right
[46:48] we still got to drive troubles out and
[46:50] and temptations out
[46:51] we still have a battle to fight praise
[46:53] god
[46:55] thank the lord
[46:58] remember we have two principles that
[46:59] govern the will of god
[47:01] uh it'll be perfectly with his known
[47:04] will in the bible
[47:05] but it must happen in his time in season
[47:07] we saw that a while back in part three
[47:10] it's always with the word
[47:12] and always in the right season and then
[47:14] along with that
[47:16] there's always service involved
[47:18] submission
[47:19] and suffering in the will of god all of
[47:22] those
[47:23] accompany god's perfect will and how do
[47:26] you find it romans 12 says you find it
[47:28] by
[47:28] bringing your body and making it a
[47:30] living sacrifice
[47:31] praise god unto god you have to set
[47:34] aside your body that means everything
[47:35] you
[47:36] you eat right everything you think every
[47:39] everywhere you go
[47:40] uh everything you put in front of your
[47:42] eyes everything every all the clothes
[47:44] you put on
[47:45] everything about your body has to be a
[47:47] living sacrifice unto god
[47:49] and then with that you'll be dedicated
[47:51] to the word and your mind will be
[47:53] transformed
[47:54] by the renewing of your mind by the word
[47:56] of god
[47:57] praise god that's how you find the
[47:59] perfect will of god very
[48:00] simple just consecrate dedicate your
[48:03] entire
[48:04] life to god i know it's a hard thing to
[48:06] do in this hour
[48:07] but of course it doesn't really matter
[48:09] what we got to overcome
[48:10] as long as we know how to overcome and
[48:13] that's by the word amen
[48:15] now we saw
[48:19] you need to fight we we need to find i
[48:21] need to find
[48:22] god's perfect will for my relationships
[48:24] vocations
[48:25] locations ministries and gifts
[48:28] uh i got some good feedback on those i'm
[48:30] glad that people enjoyed those but let's
[48:34] finish up here let's just review the
[48:35] gifts real quick
[48:37] uh the wisdom is is advice that's very
[48:40] timely
[48:41] and you know it was a word of wisdom
[48:43] when it the what you
[48:44] desire comes to pass and you can see the
[48:46] blessings from that decision
[48:48] afterwards it was the right time it was
[48:50] the right thing to do
[48:52] the word of knowledge unlocks something
[48:55] for you it opens a door for you
[48:57] it gives you information from the bible
[49:00] and helps you to enter into a promise
[49:02] praise god and then we we looked last
[49:05] time at faith
[49:06] faith is a substance that
[49:09] is god's desire and power to move
[49:13] problems or sicknesses or adversaries
[49:16] like
[49:16] mountains just by speaking god's word
[49:20] amen that's the gift of faith praise the
[49:23] lord
[49:24] now let's look at tonight so this is
[49:28] new in review uh let's look at gifts of
[49:31] healing
[49:32] now healing is deliverance from the
[49:35] oppression of the devil
[49:37] of both the mind and the body
[49:40] because it's mental torment that often
[49:42] causes physical ailments right
[49:46] many times people have physical pain
[49:49] because of their mental pain or their
[49:51] spiritual pain
[49:52] right things they have allowed to
[49:54] torment them and that
[49:56] it affects their lives like a lot of
[49:58] doctors will tell you
[49:59] my doctors even told me stress will
[50:02] cause heart trouble
[50:03] just mental stress right just worrying
[50:06] about this and worrying about that
[50:07] just letting stress get to you will
[50:10] cause heart trouble so
[50:12] spiritual oppression causes physical
[50:14] oppression
[50:16] right you just gotta let the weight just
[50:18] gotta like the bible said just let off
[50:19] the pressure praise god
[50:21] just cast your cares upon the lord for
[50:23] he cares for you
[50:24] praise god amen that's what the
[50:27] house of god does that's what worshiping
[50:29] does that's what praising god does amen
[50:31] it just lets off the pressure get your
[50:33] mind off those things that it casts all
[50:36] those things aside
[50:37] and you come into the presence of the
[50:39] king of kings and lord of lords praise
[50:41] god
[50:42] mental torment will often cause physical
[50:44] torment
[50:47] and there's many gifts of healing such
[50:49] as laying on of hands
[50:51] speaking the word natural remedies
[50:53] lately we've heard like brother amen's
[50:55] uh
[50:56] father and stepmother uh they went to a
[50:59] brother who has a gift of healing
[51:01] uh to pray touch their foreheads and
[51:03] they pass out remember that we told the
[51:05] story a couple months ago that
[51:06] they just have that prayer the anointing
[51:08] gets so strong on them
[51:09] they can just lay hands on and people
[51:11] fall over i've done that a few times
[51:14] as far as praying for people and they've
[51:15] fallen over just under the anointing of
[51:17] the holy spirit
[51:19] but that's a different kind of gift
[51:21] right there's many
[51:23] kinds of gifts
[51:26] so divine healing isn't spontaneous
[51:30] and that differentiates it from miracles
[51:33] now remember king saul had mental
[51:36] torment
[51:37] he was so jealous of david uh and he was
[51:41] so jealous he couldn't get that picture
[51:42] of his mind of all the women playing
[51:44] tambourines and
[51:45] saying saul's killed his thousands and
[51:47] david is ten thousands
[51:49] he was such a jealous person right he
[51:51] couldn't get over his jealousy oh how
[51:53] could the women
[51:54] sing for david when i'm the king instead
[51:57] of being happy that they're
[51:58] they weren't slave to philistines he got
[52:00] jealous over the man that
[52:02] had faith to overcome if he was so
[52:04] concerned why didn't he rise up in faith
[52:06] because he was a slave to fear right
[52:10] so instead of being happy that somebody
[52:12] got a victory
[52:14] he got frustrated about it right and he
[52:17] got
[52:17] angry about it he got a a murderous
[52:20] spirit about it instead of being happy
[52:22] for the victory of god
[52:23] oh church i hope no matter what age no
[52:25] matter what gender
[52:26] when someone gets a victory our i hope
[52:28] our church will just rally around it
[52:30] and praise god for it amen no matter if
[52:33] it's
[52:34] older like brother keith or younger uh
[52:36] or even younger than me
[52:37] you know children it don't matter to me
[52:40] uh we we want to see devils driven out
[52:42] we want to see goliath removed amen
[52:44] we want to see the canaanites driven out
[52:46] we want to see the amorites driven out
[52:48] we want to see god's people in liberty
[52:50] and victory praise god
[52:52] amen
[52:55] not be jealous of other people
[53:00] now with preachers it's you know
[53:03] the thing with preachers that i found
[53:04] too is that uh
[53:06] any new preacher comes in i've got to
[53:09] battle the devil because it seems like
[53:10] everybody
[53:11] pays better attention you know or they
[53:14] they seem to be happier when the new
[53:16] preacher comes
[53:18] and so that's one thing i've noticed
[53:19] that i've gotta be very careful and that
[53:21] that's
[53:21] and that's why church i'm one of the
[53:22] loudest ones saying amen right
[53:25] like when that's why i'll sit on the
[53:26] edge of my seat physically on purpose
[53:29] so that i'm not looking at the man i'm
[53:31] looking past the man
[53:33] and looking at the god preaching through
[53:34] the man
[53:36] and i want to support that man and that
[53:38] gift of god in his life
[53:40] so i purposely have to train my mind and
[53:42] body to do that
[53:44] uh to get the victory praise god just
[53:46] because we all battle something
[53:49] so saul was able uh to get under the
[53:52] anointing that david was playing on the
[53:54] piano
[53:55] right i'm sorry not piano on the uh the
[53:58] string instruments
[53:59] the harp and liar and worship and then
[54:02] those evil spirits
[54:04] delivered him from his mental trouble
[54:08] how many ever been delivered from stress
[54:10] be because of music
[54:13] just listening to the right music just
[54:15] putting on the worship of god in the
[54:17] home or in your car
[54:18] and you can start worshiping i don't
[54:20] know how many times have i driven to
[54:21] work
[54:22] and uh i'll just be all worried about
[54:24] work or something frustrated
[54:26] about all the work or load or and some
[54:28] i'll just put on a song and it just
[54:30] seems like
[54:30] all that pressure goes away and i can i
[54:32] can smile again and i can just be happy
[54:34] and
[54:35] i can walk into work feeling good about
[54:37] it praise god
[54:38] because the spirit of god uh delights in
[54:41] worship
[54:42] it doesn't delight in worry frustration
[54:44] or jealousy
[54:46] like saul let uh come upon him he let he
[54:50] invited those demons upon him
[54:52] and so it tormented him that was first
[54:56] samuel 16 where david
[54:59] so music is a gift of healing and notice
[55:02] church is not usually the first
[55:04] song right it takes a couple songs
[55:07] right because if if it was instant
[55:09] that'd be a miracle
[55:11] but it's you know as even with when i
[55:12] gave my heart to lord you know kim's
[55:14] cam's car i borrowed his car unless it
[55:16] was christian music it wasn't the first
[55:17] song that gave my heart to the lord it
[55:19] was
[55:19] it was numerous songs over months and
[55:22] months and months and then
[55:23] i probably started listening to that in
[55:24] september of 1999
[55:27] and then i gave my heart to lord
[55:28] beginning of the year 2000.
[55:30] you know so it wasn't something that was
[55:32] instant but it took
[55:34] time and uh we got to give god time
[55:37] praise god that's a gift
[55:38] of healing so malachi lydia and amen and
[55:41] kesha was singing and haven was singing
[55:43] all the ones that we're starting to see
[55:44] and gifts
[55:45] naomi sing in different ones my wife
[55:47] singing song specials
[55:48] and jose and whenever whenever god
[55:52] leads you to sing uh it's for the people
[55:55] it's to help the people
[55:56] to be healed praise god and to worship
[55:58] god amen
[56:00] is to clear the minds of any clutter
[56:02] right
[56:03] it's a to clear the minds and clean out
[56:05] the holy spirit i'm sorry
[56:06] clean out the evil spirits by the holy
[56:09] spirit in our minds
[56:11] to open the doors uh to all of our
[56:13] thought lives right
[56:14] every area of our thoughts to open the
[56:16] conscience memory reason affection
[56:18] imagination
[56:19] the songs are supposed to open those
[56:21] doors right and clean out whatever's
[56:23] wrong in there
[56:24] in order that the christ might live in
[56:26] our minds
[56:28] we might in other words we might uh
[56:31] we might uh just hold captive the word
[56:35] of god right we might we would just
[56:36] uh hold the word of god in our thoughts
[56:38] praise god
[56:40] couldn't think of the exact word i was
[56:41] thinking of
[56:44] now this is a new one i don't think i've
[56:46] ever read this one
[56:47] uh let's go to ezekiel 47 12. this might
[56:49] be brand new
[56:51] this is where my wife has been a
[56:52] blessing god many times use
[56:55] leaves and plants as medicine
[56:58] and figs were used to heal boils at
[57:01] times in the bible
[57:03] so ezekiel 47 12 we got three scriptures
[57:07] on this
[57:08] where you can see god used plants and
[57:11] natural things herbal remedies i think
[57:14] and by the river upon the bank thereof
[57:16] on the side and that side shall grow all
[57:18] trees for meat whose leaf shall
[57:19] not fade neither shall the fruit thereof
[57:21] be consumed it shall bring forth
[57:23] new fruit according to its months
[57:25] because they're waters they issued out
[57:26] of the sanctuary
[57:28] and the fruits thereof shall be for me
[57:31] and the leaf thereof for medicine
[57:35] okay uh go to second kings 20 verse
[57:38] seven
[57:39] second kings 20 verse 7.
[57:42] i'm right there
[57:46] and isaiah said take a lump of figs and
[57:50] they took and laid it on the boil and he
[57:52] recovered why didn't he just say
[57:54] speak the word brother why did he just
[57:55] say that because god has a different
[57:58] variety praise god
[57:59] god wants to use that for his glory amen
[58:04] uh let's go to isaiah 38 21.
[58:08] isaiah 38 21
[58:14] many times god will use something
[58:16] natural right
[58:17] in order to bring about a healing for
[58:20] isaiah had said let them take a lump of
[58:23] figs and lay it
[58:24] for a plaster paster on the boil
[58:27] and he shall recover and the church said
[58:30] just but it's got to be led of the lord
[58:32] right it's got to be led to the lord
[58:34] when the lord leads it right uh you
[58:36] apply the figs or the leaves and
[58:38] uh what the scripture says and it brings
[58:41] healing i believe moses right came to
[58:45] the waters of mara if i'm not mistaken
[58:47] and then he three throw a rod in there i
[58:49] can't remember that story right now
[58:51] but the bitter turn to sweet waters i
[58:53] forget what he cast into the water
[58:55] but there's something natural right
[58:56] bitter waters and he casts something in
[58:59] and they become sweet they become good
[59:02] waters
[59:03] and god used that water to give his
[59:06] children a drink
[59:07] praise god so see god does these
[59:10] gifts of healing there's many varieties
[59:12] of it
[59:14] so those are good to read i think that's
[59:16] the first time i've ever
[59:18] read those in a live service but that is
[59:20] a gift of healing so someone has the
[59:22] ability
[59:23] to know about herbs and leaves and figs
[59:26] and they can put
[59:28] a salve together and it can be used for
[59:30] the glory of god
[59:31] to bring about healing
[59:34] all right now jesus christ now promises
[59:37] to heal the sick when we lay hands on
[59:39] them in mark 16
[59:41] verses 17 and 18. of course we've seen
[59:44] that many times
[59:45] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[59:47] recover
[59:49] praise god i forget who was telling me
[59:53] there i can't remember the testimony
[59:55] but they literally felt uh might have
[59:56] been amen yeah it might have been amen
[59:58] and who the last time
[59:59] amen was sick he woke up in the middle
[1:00:01] of the night sick and sister hua laid
[1:00:03] uh her hand on brother amen and she said
[1:00:06] her hand got numb and she said she felt
[1:00:08] the power of god flowing in the brother
[1:00:10] amen and amen was healed
[1:00:12] that's a good testimony praise god i
[1:00:14] said i said that's something to be
[1:00:15] rejoicing about praise god
[1:00:17] there's uh divine healing he said lay
[1:00:20] hands on the sick
[1:00:21] and they shall recover
[1:00:25] paul prayed and then laid his hands on
[1:00:28] publius's father and he was healed of
[1:00:31] fever and a bloody flux
[1:00:33] and his intestinal infection all he did
[1:00:36] was
[1:00:37] praise and speak loud and lay his hands
[1:00:40] and his
[1:00:40] intestines healed amen how many believe
[1:00:43] god is
[1:00:44] almighty praise god just by placing a
[1:00:46] hand on someone's shoulder or forehead
[1:00:48] or
[1:00:49] joining hands the power of god can flow
[1:00:52] out of that person
[1:00:53] it's called healing virtues amen
[1:00:55] hallelujah
[1:00:56] virtue float out of jesus amen and just
[1:01:00] by laying
[1:01:00] on someone's hand on their shoulder it
[1:01:03] can the power of god can flow down
[1:01:05] into their stomach and heal their
[1:01:07] stomach praise god that's our god amen
[1:01:09] the great healer
[1:01:12] the giver of every good and perfect gift
[1:01:16] and i forgot to review it but i'll get
[1:01:18] to get there in just a minute
[1:01:20] you know i've seen two women on two
[1:01:23] separate occasions
[1:01:24] uh i prayed for them they either had arm
[1:01:27] weakness or
[1:01:28] arm paralysis um
[1:01:31] and i prayed i forget the sister's name
[1:01:34] we used to come here we prayed for her
[1:01:35] arm
[1:01:36] tanya thank you so hers was an instant
[1:01:39] she went home
[1:01:40] when we prayed and used the keys of the
[1:01:42] kingdom she went home that night and
[1:01:43] while cooking supper
[1:01:44] uh she said she felt her arm get healed
[1:01:46] and she raised her hand and she said she
[1:01:48] couldn't use it at work that friday she
[1:01:49] couldn't use her work because it was
[1:01:50] kind of
[1:01:51] weak or paralyzed but then when we
[1:01:53] prayed for her she went home
[1:01:55] cooking dinner and the power came back
[1:01:57] praise god
[1:01:58] so we thank the lord for that one time i
[1:02:00] was preaching in pennsylvania i think i
[1:02:01] told this story
[1:02:02] i was preaching on our face seeking
[1:02:04] god's face and i'd preach
[1:02:06] on how uh we see god's face which means
[1:02:09] his presence
[1:02:10] in fact uh the shoe bread actually means
[1:02:13] the bread
[1:02:13] of his presence which is awesome you
[1:02:16] start eating on the word of god
[1:02:18] and if you come into god's presence you
[1:02:20] come into his face praise god
[1:02:21] amen that's what we should be doing
[1:02:23] tonight praise god amen feasting on
[1:02:25] god's word and we feel closer to god
[1:02:28] that's the bread of his presence but
[1:02:31] anyways i preach it on the christian's
[1:02:33] face seeking god's face
[1:02:34] and then i preach how the sinners turn
[1:02:36] their face from god
[1:02:38] i was preaching on even jezebel and how
[1:02:41] she painted her face
[1:02:42] and how god doesn't want pain on our
[1:02:44] faces
[1:02:45] uh he wants the glory of god on our
[1:02:48] faces like moses had the glory of god
[1:02:50] and sister beatrice this old woman was
[1:02:53] sitting in the back with her husband she
[1:02:54] had pants on and makeup and short hair
[1:02:57] and she said she felt she told the
[1:02:58] pastor afterwards she said she felt
[1:03:00] somebody tap her shoulder
[1:03:02] and she thought it was her husband and
[1:03:03] she she couldn't raise her arm she had
[1:03:05] armed paralysis
[1:03:06] she felt something tap her shoulder and
[1:03:08] she raised her shoulder and she was
[1:03:10] completely healed
[1:03:11] brother jim invited her back but they
[1:03:13] never come back to church
[1:03:15] and she had pain on her face now you
[1:03:17] tell me that's god's mercy to someone
[1:03:19] that god would deliver the word and give
[1:03:21] them a vindication of healing
[1:03:24] they didn't even come up for prayer it
[1:03:26] was while the word was being preached
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:28] now that might be a miracle actually
[1:03:30] because it was instant
[1:03:32] so i think i've got to change that one
[1:03:33] in the book uh if it happened
[1:03:35] instantly that's a miracle and i never
[1:03:38] got a chance to shake her hand brother
[1:03:40] jim just
[1:03:40] testified about it afterwards
[1:03:45] uh when i was sick one time with throat
[1:03:47] sickness brother samson shedding prayed
[1:03:48] for me
[1:03:49] i couldn't sing during the song service
[1:03:51] but after church i was singing as loud
[1:03:52] as i ever did
[1:03:54] uh and i felt healed i felt god heal my
[1:03:56] throat
[1:04:00] and then i told the testimony of my wife
[1:04:02] having migraines and
[1:04:03] i was preaching on healing and she the
[1:04:06] thought came to my wife's mind that
[1:04:08] i'm a daughter of god i eat the
[1:04:10] children's bread
[1:04:11] i don't get the crumbs i eat the
[1:04:13] children's bread and my wife said
[1:04:15] through a healthier lifestyle
[1:04:17] and through faith she's not suffered
[1:04:18] with migraine sins by god's grace
[1:04:21] now let me go back to what i want to
[1:04:23] review
[1:04:25] remember this church that in ephesians 4
[1:04:28] 12
[1:04:29] there's five purposes of the five-fold
[1:04:31] ministry to perfect the saints that's
[1:04:33] equip the saints so give them equipment
[1:04:37] and church what other equipment can i
[1:04:38] give you than the word of god
[1:04:40] i can buy you books i could buy you all
[1:04:43] kinds of nice
[1:04:44] trinkets right i give the kids changes
[1:04:45] for easter or something i gave them the
[1:04:47] trinkets last year with easter
[1:04:50] but that's not the gifts we're trying to
[1:04:51] equip with we're trying to equip with
[1:04:53] knowledge
[1:04:54] of the gifts of the word of god right
[1:04:56] understanding we're trying to
[1:04:58] equip the saints with knowledge and
[1:05:00] understanding of the gifts in their life
[1:05:02] so they can operate them properly
[1:05:05] glory so perfecting of the saints that's
[1:05:08] the equipping of the saints
[1:05:09] the work of the ministry to undertake
[1:05:12] the ministry
[1:05:13] so preachers are supposed to help us
[1:05:15] understand how to
[1:05:16] undertake a ministry how do i
[1:05:19] how do i continue a ministry that's what
[1:05:22] the preaching of the word is supposed to
[1:05:23] do
[1:05:25] and that's what we've been preaching on
[1:05:26] right purpose over the last few years
[1:05:28] find your purpose and then dedicate your
[1:05:31] body
[1:05:31] uh present your body a living sacrifice
[1:05:35] unto god
[1:05:36] so if you've got a gift of healing if
[1:05:37] you've got a gift of knowledge
[1:05:40] we should set aside time to pray about
[1:05:42] that right
[1:05:44] that's for the work of the ministry to
[1:05:46] undertake
[1:05:47] the ministry so we're equipped by the
[1:05:51] knowledge of god to know what the gifts
[1:05:53] are
[1:05:55] and then we're we're supposed to
[1:05:56] undertake we're supposed to recognize
[1:05:58] mine
[1:05:58] i have a ministry i need to be faithful
[1:06:01] with that
[1:06:02] and if and i know i know the bride of
[1:06:05] jesus christ is gonna
[1:06:06] they're gonna believe that quote brother
[1:06:08] branham said that every person is just
[1:06:10] as important as the preacher tonight
[1:06:13] tonight church every person person is
[1:06:16] just
[1:06:16] as important as the preacher because
[1:06:19] everybody has a part
[1:06:20] in the service
[1:06:24] so preaching is to equip us show us the
[1:06:26] equipment
[1:06:27] right tell us about the equipment tell
[1:06:29] us how to use it
[1:06:32] undertake the ministry find a ministry
[1:06:34] and be devoted to the ministry and stay
[1:06:36] with the ministry
[1:06:39] and to edify the body of christ promote
[1:06:41] growth this is how you grow in the word
[1:06:43] of god this is how you grow in your
[1:06:45] in your mind battles right this is how
[1:06:47] you grow uh into faith and
[1:06:49] and become a better christian this is
[1:06:51] how you live a more sanctified life
[1:06:53] help the saints grow promote growth in
[1:06:55] their lives
[1:06:56] this is how you go from faith to virtue
[1:06:58] and knowledge and and temperance and
[1:07:00] patience and godliness and brotherly
[1:07:01] kindness
[1:07:02] you stay in the word you daily read your
[1:07:04] bible you daily pray
[1:07:06] and you daily obey praise god amen
[1:07:10] peter said god gives the holy ghost to
[1:07:12] them that obey him praise god
[1:07:14] jesus said the father will give you the
[1:07:16] holy ghost if you ask
[1:07:18] praise god and jesus said if you abide
[1:07:20] in me and my words
[1:07:22] he said then ask what you will and it
[1:07:24] shall be done praise god
[1:07:26] but you got to abide like a wheat plant
[1:07:28] you got to abide in the word that means
[1:07:30] every day
[1:07:30] the plant stays in position the plant
[1:07:33] stays uh
[1:07:34] uh gathering in the nutrients and minus
[1:07:36] minerals
[1:07:37] we stay in the word we stay feasting on
[1:07:39] the things of god and we grow up into
[1:07:41] god
[1:07:44] the fourth thing it does is it makes us
[1:07:47] agree
[1:07:48] on faith agreement of faith the unity of
[1:07:51] the faith
[1:07:52] agree on beliefs
[1:07:56] and i think with uh i think with
[1:07:57] numerous people now this is just my
[1:07:58] observation
[1:07:59] i think with numerous people it's just
[1:08:01] trying to help them to believe which
[1:08:03] gifts they have
[1:08:04] right what gifts do i have
[1:08:07] what do i see working repeatedly in my
[1:08:09] life what have i seen once working in my
[1:08:12] life
[1:08:13] what do i see working over and over
[1:08:17] and help them believe right to be
[1:08:19] unified that we believe this gift lays
[1:08:21] in our lives
[1:08:22] it's god's will for me to do this
[1:08:26] this is the work of the preaching of the
[1:08:28] fivefold ministry
[1:08:30] and lastly the unity to be welcome in
[1:08:32] the unity of the knowledge of the son of
[1:08:34] god
[1:08:34] that's precise truth that's why i think
[1:08:37] it's so important to know precisely what
[1:08:38] is the gift of faith
[1:08:40] what is the gift of healing what is the
[1:08:41] gift of wisdom and knowledge
[1:08:43] if the when you stay in the in the mind
[1:08:46] of the holy spirit he directs you to
[1:08:48] precise truth
[1:08:50] right we're all we're all kind of
[1:08:51] guessing at certain things for a while
[1:08:53] but
[1:08:53] but if we stay in tune with the holy
[1:08:55] spirit we should precisely know
[1:08:57] what god has called us to do
[1:09:06] all right so i just want to review that
[1:09:07] and let me uh read this one too i got
[1:09:10] another one i wanted to read here i
[1:09:12] don't know if you remember this from the
[1:09:13] church age book paul irenaeus
[1:09:15] ephesus smyrna the submergent church age
[1:09:18] with uh the messenger iranians
[1:09:21] he was militant against any form of
[1:09:23] organization
[1:09:24] also his life history where he served
[1:09:26] the lord was one of much manifestation
[1:09:28] in the holy spirit and the word was
[1:09:31] taught with unusual clarity
[1:09:33] and conformity to its original precepts
[1:09:37] his churches in france were known to
[1:09:38] have the gifts of the spirit among them
[1:09:40] for the saints spoken tongues prophesied
[1:09:43] raised the dead
[1:09:44] and healed the sick by the prayer of
[1:09:46] faith
[1:09:48] he saw the danger of any kind of
[1:09:50] organizat organized brotherhood among
[1:09:52] the elders
[1:09:53] pastors etc he stood solely for a
[1:09:56] unified
[1:09:57] spirit-filled gift manifesting local
[1:09:59] church
[1:10:00] and god honored him for the power of god
[1:10:03] manifested among the saints amen
[1:10:05] hallelujah praise god
[1:10:08] church that's what i believe our church
[1:10:09] can have
[1:10:11] we can have unusual clarity how do you
[1:10:13] know because sister beecher if i've had
[1:10:15] numerous people in the last two weeks
[1:10:17] contact me about the clarity
[1:10:19] that i taught the message in that debate
[1:10:21] they were blown away they're like wow i
[1:10:23] never heard the message explained like
[1:10:24] that that's exactly the way i believe it
[1:10:27] church i believe here we have a special
[1:10:29] thing i believe cam church brother
[1:10:31] brooks is church
[1:10:32] these churches have a special thing we
[1:10:34] have unusual clarity of the word of god
[1:10:38] we just we just got to continue to
[1:10:40] surrender ourselves
[1:10:41] put ourselves on the altar of god which
[1:10:43] is our reasonable service
[1:10:46] right and ask god to help us to grow up
[1:10:48] and grow into the understanding of our
[1:10:50] gifts that we can come to church
[1:10:52] expecting god to do something
[1:10:53] supernatural praise god
[1:10:55] hallelujah we have we have unusual
[1:10:58] clarity
[1:10:59] with this message praise god i've had
[1:11:02] numerous people
[1:11:03] contact me about that on youtube and
[1:11:05] email and
[1:11:06] uh facebook messenger people that are
[1:11:08] they're they're
[1:11:09] uh i got a i got a voicemail
[1:11:13] where the brother said that was
[1:11:14] outstanding or he said spontaneous i
[1:11:16] forget what he said
[1:11:17] he was just blown away by and that's
[1:11:19] just that's not to exalt me or anything
[1:11:21] it's not because there's nothing good in
[1:11:23] me without jesus we can do nothing but
[1:11:26] if we're staying close to jesus we
[1:11:27] should have
[1:11:28] unusual clarity of the word of god
[1:11:31] the word should make sense amen the
[1:11:34] message should be
[1:11:35] the apostolic faith restored praise god
[1:11:38] i never set my timer so let me do that
[1:11:40] now
[1:11:42] i just looked up at the clock for the
[1:11:43] first time my iranians
[1:11:46] he taught the people so clearly what the
[1:11:48] gifts of the spirit are
[1:11:50] and that's why this chapter i believe
[1:11:52] will be so important to you and i
[1:11:55] if we can really focus on what
[1:11:59] the word of god says and honestly look
[1:12:01] at our lives
[1:12:02] and see what gifts have manifested in
[1:12:03] our lives
[1:12:07] so like i said for my life i've really
[1:12:09] wanted to speak in tongues but i never
[1:12:10] have i've asked god to let me speak in
[1:12:12] tongues
[1:12:13] i felt like i could but i just i didn't
[1:12:15] want to make it up
[1:12:16] everybody i've talked to said you don't
[1:12:18] you don't have to make it up it just
[1:12:19] flows out of you
[1:12:20] everybody i've talked to that speaks in
[1:12:22] tongues so i never i just never
[1:12:24] tried to do it but i've seen gifts of
[1:12:27] gifts of faith right that's in my
[1:12:28] testimony
[1:12:30] i've seen wisdom people have told me
[1:12:31] that did i have any knowledge
[1:12:34] no i didn't have any knowledge oh but i
[1:12:36] oh yeah but i've given people scriptures
[1:12:38] they got delivered from cigarettes
[1:12:40] and they got delivered from video games
[1:12:41] and i preached different things where
[1:12:42] people got delivered so i believe that
[1:12:44] would be a word of knowledge
[1:12:46] uh i've seen people healed in my
[1:12:47] ministry
[1:12:49] i've seen miracles
[1:12:53] now some of these are more than others
[1:12:55] right repeated things over and over
[1:12:58] uh from time to time they happen
[1:13:04] and maybe we'll do that on sunday if i
[1:13:05] pre if i'm preaching what what
[1:13:07] because i mean we might have a guest
[1:13:08] minister there's a brother brother
[1:13:09] randy's in town at cams and he might
[1:13:11] swing by we'll see
[1:13:12] god bless you nature god bless you so he
[1:13:14] might he he's got
[1:13:15] you know he's got a certain schedule
[1:13:17] he's got to keep so i don't know if he's
[1:13:18] coming by or not we haven't
[1:13:19] uh finalized plans but maybe on sunday
[1:13:22] we lord willing if i preach we could
[1:13:23] take some time to look at
[1:13:24] gifts and just look at our lives and you
[1:13:26] know spend some time praying about that
[1:13:28] because irenaeus was known as a
[1:13:30] supernatural church
[1:13:34] and we want to be known as a church that
[1:13:36] has a supernatural
[1:13:38] praise god how many can say amen on that
[1:13:42] we want to be known as a church that has
[1:13:44] a supernatural among us just like
[1:13:46] iranians as church
[1:13:48] but it's going to take putting ourselves
[1:13:50] on the altar right
[1:13:52] and then letting the word of god
[1:13:53] transform our minds
[1:13:57] it's a spirit-filled unified gift
[1:14:00] manifesting
[1:14:01] local church look at that what a phrase
[1:14:04] amen
[1:14:05] lee vale must have put that one together
[1:14:06] of course he got off as he went later on
[1:14:08] in life
[1:14:08] that's one of those things those guys
[1:14:10] tried to debate me on what about lee
[1:14:11] vale what about
[1:14:12] gene and leo they were actually turned
[1:14:13] into child molesters and homosexuals
[1:14:15] i said well that doesn't just because
[1:14:17] there's one bad person or a couple bad
[1:14:19] people around your ministry
[1:14:20] doesn't mean the ministry's bad if
[1:14:22] that's the case then judas what about
[1:14:24] judas and jesus
[1:14:26] right that's why i told him on the
[1:14:27] debate i said you we've all seen that
[1:14:29] meme
[1:14:30] i already seen that meme where judas had
[1:14:32] the best pastor there was and he still
[1:14:34] deserted the gospel i mean you can have
[1:14:37] the best pastor in the world
[1:14:38] but it's up to you many of the promises
[1:14:41] are conditional god's not going to force
[1:14:43] you
[1:14:44] you've got to desire it praise god
[1:14:46] you've got to love god's word more than
[1:14:48] the things of this present world amen
[1:14:53] and so who knows maybe sounds like lee
[1:14:55] vale was living a good life while
[1:14:56] brother bran was here i don't know what
[1:14:57] happened afterwards
[1:14:59] jean and leo maybe they were living a
[1:15:01] good life while brother man was here i
[1:15:02] don't know
[1:15:04] but once for sure after brother bam left
[1:15:06] yes they had a huge backslide in
[1:15:08] into some of the most awful things you
[1:15:10] could ever imagine
[1:15:11] that doesn't mean uh that they were
[1:15:13] doing it while brother brown was here we
[1:15:15] don't know
[1:15:18] so that's why church we earnestly
[1:15:19] contend for the faith and that's why
[1:15:21] church we have to wait for the holy
[1:15:22] spirit to give us an answer we don't
[1:15:24] know what people are going to say
[1:15:25] we must just be humble in the present
[1:15:27] hour not attacking people
[1:15:29] not trying but just in love say god give
[1:15:32] me something that will help them
[1:15:34] because love you can't help somebody
[1:15:35] unless you love them
[1:15:39] and numerous people tell me that that
[1:15:40] they of all the people they could feel
[1:15:42] the love of god in my life
[1:15:46] so that's all glory to god that's not
[1:15:48] it's all god's glory
[1:15:50] so see church we want to be a gift
[1:15:52] manifesting church
[1:15:53] and have unusual clarity wow the word is
[1:15:56] so clear about the gift of faith
[1:15:58] it's so clear about the gift of healing
[1:16:02] it's so clear about miracles it's so
[1:16:04] clear about prophecy and tongues and
[1:16:06] interpretation
[1:16:07] word of knowledge and is so clear now i
[1:16:10] can put it to
[1:16:11] action in my life that i can see god
[1:16:13] move through my life
[1:16:15] that's what we want in our church
[1:16:18] miracles are instant spontaneous
[1:16:20] manifestations of healing
[1:16:22] or other phenomenons performed by faith
[1:16:25] so see faith and miracles are
[1:16:26] often closely associated
[1:16:29] galatians 3 5 says he therefore that
[1:16:33] ministereth to you
[1:16:34] the spirit and worketh miracles among
[1:16:36] you
[1:16:37] doeth heed it by the works of the law or
[1:16:39] by the hearing of faith
[1:16:41] so how do people do miracles they just
[1:16:43] preach god's word and people hear it
[1:16:46] and they receive it praise god in other
[1:16:48] words they just got to come to church
[1:16:50] knowing i'm going to get something from
[1:16:51] god today god has revealed to me
[1:16:54] he's going to do something in my life
[1:16:56] but they got to be in contact with god
[1:16:58] at home praise god because paul says
[1:17:00] among you see among
[1:17:02] you in the church of galatia how do
[1:17:04] these people do miracles among you
[1:17:06] they get anointed with the spirit they
[1:17:08] say what the spirit wants them to say
[1:17:10] and the hearers are ready to receive the
[1:17:12] miracle praise god
[1:17:16] hallelujah jesus had innumerable
[1:17:20] number of healing miracles he stopped a
[1:17:22] woman's bleeding
[1:17:23] he delivered souls from life-threatening
[1:17:25] fevers
[1:17:26] he raised the dead turned water to wine
[1:17:29] multiplied fish and bread
[1:17:32] he cast out certain demons
[1:17:35] by fasting in prayer
[1:17:39] jesus used peter and john to do a
[1:17:41] notable miracle causing a lame man to
[1:17:43] walk and leap
[1:17:44] in acts chapter 3. special miracles
[1:17:48] were performed in paul's life using
[1:17:50] handkerchiefs
[1:17:51] paul touched to drive out demons from
[1:17:54] the sick praise god
[1:17:55] like with brother bang's dad amen
[1:17:58] glory thank the lord amen
[1:18:02] the bank said he just remember he just
[1:18:03] took the tape and he taped that
[1:18:05] brother prayer cloth to his dad's arm
[1:18:08] he just taped it there two days later he
[1:18:10] woke up praise god amen
[1:18:13] that might be divine healing praise god
[1:18:15] it wasn't instantaneous
[1:18:17] divine healing special maybe that's a
[1:18:18] special
[1:18:20] divine healing god you're my mom of
[1:18:23] liver cancer
[1:18:25] in 1988 instantly
[1:18:28] i saw a kidney stone healed in guyana
[1:18:30] arthritis healed in guyana
[1:18:32] instantaneous things didn't take long
[1:18:35] instantaneous
[1:18:38] all right prophecy is the ability to
[1:18:40] foretell the future
[1:18:43] and church when you tell someone that
[1:18:44] when we know the future the bible says
[1:18:46] it gives edification
[1:18:48] exhortation and comfort to know the
[1:18:52] future
[1:18:54] one thing that i thought was striking
[1:18:55] was benjamin's grandpa after benjamin's
[1:18:58] former girlfriend was shot 10 times i
[1:19:01] went to her hospital room and i thought
[1:19:03] oh how is she going to make it she was
[1:19:04] so bloated
[1:19:06] and uh benjamin called his grandpa's
[1:19:08] grandfather prayed
[1:19:10] and he said don't fret she's going to be
[1:19:12] all right and i honestly had a hard time
[1:19:14] believing that when i heard that
[1:19:16] she was on life support coma mom's there
[1:19:19] weeping and crying
[1:19:20] i pray with them you know and leave
[1:19:23] and then two years later i was with
[1:19:25] benjamin we go over there to see
[1:19:27] benny and this here's a skinny little
[1:19:30] girl you know
[1:19:31] young lady i'm like how in the world is
[1:19:33] that one the same as the
[1:19:35] one i saw at the hospital room
[1:19:38] and you know dressed like a morally i've
[1:19:40] got to turn the lift the other way you
[1:19:41] know
[1:19:42] little children running around there to
[1:19:44] me that was prophecy
[1:19:45] she's going to be all right
[1:19:49] anyone would have thought it's
[1:19:51] impossible shot 10 times
[1:19:54] so to me that looks like it's prophetic
[1:19:56] and what a and
[1:19:57] you know i remember i was with benjamin
[1:19:59] he looked like he got comforted by that
[1:20:03] because prophecy comforts you it's going
[1:20:05] to be all right
[1:20:07] it's going to be all right
[1:20:11] see they can be spontaneously pronounced
[1:20:14] allowed with thus saith the holy ghost
[1:20:16] like agabus remember in acts people of
[1:20:18] acts 21
[1:20:19] 11 or it can be just through a prophetic
[1:20:22] dream the dreams can foretell the future
[1:20:26] like nebuchadnezzar in daniel chapter
[1:20:28] two that was prophetic right the four
[1:20:31] uh the four parts of the image the times
[1:20:34] of the gentiles right the gold
[1:20:36] head and the uh the silver chest and
[1:20:39] then the
[1:20:39] the brass and then the iron that was
[1:20:41] prophetic but it was over
[1:20:43] thousands of years three thousand years
[1:20:46] and when he was come this is agabus he
[1:20:49] took paul's girdle and bound his own
[1:20:50] hands and feet and said thus saith the
[1:20:52] holy ghost
[1:20:53] so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the
[1:20:56] man that owneth this girdle and shall
[1:20:58] deliver him into the hands
[1:21:00] of the gentiles now what a statement
[1:21:02] thus saith the holy ghost
[1:21:03] praise god so agabus he declares the
[1:21:07] prophecy
[1:21:08] it says thus saith the lord and it comes
[1:21:11] to pass
[1:21:13] what a supernatural power what a comfort
[1:21:15] that is praise god
[1:21:17] what a edification what a building up
[1:21:19] that is to know that god is foretelling
[1:21:21] you something that's going to come to
[1:21:23] pass
[1:21:23] see church we we just can't hear about
[1:21:25] it we got to desire it remember the
[1:21:28] bible said
[1:21:29] if you are following love if you and i
[1:21:31] are following the holy ghost we'll
[1:21:33] desire spiritual gifts pray god
[1:21:35] you can't you can't separate if if our
[1:21:38] church is truly born again
[1:21:40] they'll desire all these love gifts from
[1:21:43] the heavenly husband praise god
[1:21:45] these are love gifts to his wife
[1:21:51] and i've got a zeal i hope you do too
[1:21:54] i've got a zeal
[1:21:55] i want to see our church desire more
[1:21:58] gifts
[1:21:58] and do something about it pray about it
[1:22:02] create an atmosphere during the worship
[1:22:04] create an atmosphere during the
[1:22:05] preaching of the word
[1:22:06] because some of these miracles are
[1:22:08] performed just by hearing the word
[1:22:10] amen just by hearing the word remember
[1:22:12] brother brian
[1:22:13] he prayed for that uh mary ellen used to
[1:22:16] come here remember mary ellen i don't
[1:22:17] remember she was
[1:22:18] a sweet woman but she was i remember she
[1:22:20] was sitting right there i think it was a
[1:22:22] third seed over
[1:22:23] and brian prayed for her she fell and
[1:22:25] she hurt her tailbone and could hardly
[1:22:27] walk i remember when she walked in here
[1:22:29] and she you know stumbled in here and
[1:22:31] brian hawkins prayed for her she said
[1:22:33] and the wednesday she come back and
[1:22:35] testified of it she said as soon as she
[1:22:36] sat down all the pain left her tailbone
[1:22:39] that she had for over a week
[1:22:42] right just by hearing brian preach about
[1:22:44] jesus christ it might have been the line
[1:22:46] of judah sermon
[1:22:48] and the jesus christ the lion of the
[1:22:51] tribe of judah the
[1:22:52] ferocious one the power of god and and
[1:22:55] she had faith
[1:22:57] heard the word and just a prayer and
[1:22:59] received it right there praise god
[1:23:01] amen
[1:23:05] now i've kind of got back to divine
[1:23:07] healing or miracles
[1:23:08] but i was on prophecy
[1:23:12] see prop when prophecies are pronounced
[1:23:14] in a public gathering
[1:23:15] they're to be judged by two or three
[1:23:17] witnesses pull it up please first
[1:23:18] corinthians 14
[1:23:20] 29 now this doesn't happen very much
[1:23:23] right hardly ever but if we believe it
[1:23:26] how many believe in restoration
[1:23:27] if this is the hour if if if restoration
[1:23:30] is thus saith the lord
[1:23:31] then one of these generations is going
[1:23:33] to come to church and they're going to
[1:23:34] have this happen praise god
[1:23:37] they're going to have to list they're
[1:23:38] going to have to be mature enough to
[1:23:40] have somebody raise up could be a child
[1:23:42] could be an adult
[1:23:43] and say thus saith the lord and then
[1:23:45] after that
[1:23:46] the people who are judges got to come
[1:23:48] together and say was that the lord or
[1:23:49] not
[1:23:52] so likewise he accept the utter by the
[1:23:54] tongue words easy to be understood
[1:23:56] how shall it be known what is spoken for
[1:23:58] ye shall i'm sorry that wasn't
[1:24:00] i said the wrong one it's 14 29 i'm
[1:24:03] sorry honey 29
[1:24:04] 14 29
[1:24:09] talk about maturity
[1:24:13] now all of you judge the preaching just
[1:24:16] by your attitude right
[1:24:18] and sometimes your amens like when the
[1:24:20] people are amen and i'm like okay that's
[1:24:22] that was the holy spirit and sometimes
[1:24:23] i'll preach and you won't amen
[1:24:26] and you're trying to judge was that the
[1:24:27] right thing or the wrong thing
[1:24:29] but you'll hear it with me too i will
[1:24:30] amen some things some people say you
[1:24:32] know
[1:24:32] because i'm not sure if that's god or
[1:24:34] not you know so we're constantly judging
[1:24:36] not not uh
[1:24:37] not worried or anything not living in
[1:24:40] fear but just trying to write is that
[1:24:42] the truth or not
[1:24:43] is that the do i want to believe that
[1:24:44] and accept that and trust in that or not
[1:24:46] or is that just somebody's opinion
[1:24:51] like for example brother keith said it
[1:24:52] was sin not to vote for donald trump no
[1:24:54] i don't believe that uh i respect that
[1:24:58] um i didn't vote for trump the first
[1:25:01] time and i didn't think i was committing
[1:25:02] a sin because i didn't trust the man
[1:25:05] i he's and he and i are good friends and
[1:25:07] not donald trump
[1:25:08] keith and i and uh and but that's just
[1:25:12] his opinion
[1:25:12] you know i didn't say amen to that we
[1:25:14] were just chatting about that
[1:25:15] this time i probably will uh because
[1:25:18] he's kept his word he's got many
[1:25:19] promises
[1:25:20] and he's backed up israel and we've
[1:25:22] never had a president like that
[1:25:23] well not at least in my lifetime i don't
[1:25:26] know what ronald reagan did but you know
[1:25:28] since that
[1:25:28] the ones that i've been aware of i
[1:25:30] haven't seen it now
[1:25:32] let the prophet speak two or three and
[1:25:34] let the other judge
[1:25:37] so we believe the book of acts is going
[1:25:39] to be restored we have to have some
[1:25:41] people that are willing to stand up
[1:25:42] against a brother or sister if they say
[1:25:44] it wrong and say no that was wrong
[1:25:46] you have to have enough love for them
[1:25:49] and enough love for truth that we don't
[1:25:51] let things slide
[1:25:52] and take the wrong spirit if we're going
[1:25:55] to grow into the true church of god
[1:25:59] but see we got a desire we got to desire
[1:26:01] someone to prophesy right we have to
[1:26:03] desire
[1:26:04] somebody to give us a word of knowledge
[1:26:10] gotta follow charity and desire these
[1:26:13] things
[1:26:16] now for some reason i had first
[1:26:17] thessalonians 5 19. can you pull it up
[1:26:20] honey
[1:26:20] let me turn there real quick i got first
[1:26:22] corinthians 5 19.
[1:26:27] uh for some reason that's not oh okay i
[1:26:29] remember that one now yeah
[1:26:30] the spy is not prophesized
[1:26:33] yeah so quench not the spirit
[1:26:36] now how many message churches are guilty
[1:26:38] of that
[1:26:40] in other words people don't clap like
[1:26:42] they're really they really don't really
[1:26:43] sing like they're into it
[1:26:44] they just the same thing happens oh we
[1:26:47] always got to do three songs and prayer
[1:26:49] and then two more songs and preaching
[1:26:51] see people are sometimes we just get in
[1:26:53] the routine
[1:26:54] of pharisee-like worship right
[1:26:58] but we gotta let the holy spirit have
[1:26:59] his way praise god
[1:27:01] we gotta just uh just feel free to love
[1:27:04] god and worship god amen
[1:27:07] so you've you've heard me a few times
[1:27:09] i'll say after a preacher i'll say let's
[1:27:10] just see if the lord will say anything
[1:27:12] we'll just have a little moment of
[1:27:12] silence remember that you got a few of
[1:27:14] those
[1:27:15] just because i'm i feel the presence of
[1:27:16] god so strong i just want to see if
[1:27:18] maybe god will speak something to
[1:27:19] somebody or maybe somebody could walk
[1:27:21] over
[1:27:22] and give somebody a word of wisdom or a
[1:27:23] word of correction or a discernment
[1:27:26] right discern a spirit we had a sister
[1:27:28] from this church i'm not going to say
[1:27:29] who was
[1:27:30] but they felt like numerous times that
[1:27:33] god gave them a word of discernment for
[1:27:35] someone in the congregation
[1:27:37] but didn't want to go give it to them
[1:27:39] because they weren't sure or maybe
[1:27:40] didn't want to offend them but i
[1:27:41] encouraged the person i said
[1:27:44] that'd be good to do that if you feel
[1:27:47] led of the lord
[1:27:49] they felt like it and recently we've
[1:27:51] been talking and some people feel led to
[1:27:53] speak in tongues that's something we're
[1:27:54] praying about too
[1:27:55] i've had two people tell me recently
[1:27:57] they feel led to speak in tongues and
[1:27:58] i've tried to tell them pray about it
[1:28:00] and then if you feel it it's going to
[1:28:01] come out
[1:28:02] just be open to it in other words don't
[1:28:05] quench it don't stop it
[1:28:07] just let your whole body be taken over
[1:28:09] by the holy spirit praise god
[1:28:11] now when i prayed for the sick church
[1:28:13] this is something i got to pray about
[1:28:15] too
[1:28:15] when i pray for the sick the times i've
[1:28:18] seen healings
[1:28:19] many times i'm praying really loudly
[1:28:22] you know i'm not like whispering
[1:28:25] although god could do that
[1:28:26] but i just noticed i looked over the
[1:28:27] past and i have a video of one time
[1:28:29] where her sister
[1:28:30] uh sister uh her name was beatrice too
[1:28:33] mr beatrice from columbus i was praying
[1:28:35] for her and i was going like this
[1:28:38] and she got healed her knee her back her
[1:28:40] nerve trouble uh
[1:28:42] god healed like three or four things in
[1:28:44] one prayer that was done in columbus
[1:28:46] i got the video of it of her just me
[1:28:48] praying for her
[1:28:49] and i just noticed and then i think of
[1:28:50] the times when people got
[1:28:52] healed in trinidad and guyana i was just
[1:28:55] really loud so i don't know
[1:28:56] so i'm almost feeling like i if i'm
[1:29:00] under the spirit i've got to surrender
[1:29:01] all my voice all my emotion
[1:29:04] i've got to just surrender all my body
[1:29:06] right we don't want to quench the holy
[1:29:08] spirit we want to let the holy spirit
[1:29:09] flow
[1:29:14] and this is a new area right gifts
[1:29:15] aren't you know we're not prose at gifts
[1:29:17] right we're not
[1:29:18] super mature with gifts
[1:29:21] but we are somewhat mature because we're
[1:29:23] not getting off on the wrong end either
[1:29:24] right
[1:29:26] we're not trying to practice miracles
[1:29:29] but here malachi
[1:29:30] pull out your shoe and let me try to
[1:29:32] you're you're you know you got one
[1:29:33] leg longer than the other i'll try to
[1:29:34] push it back in you know just that's
[1:29:36] what people do
[1:29:37] charismatic churches or like they told
[1:29:39] me just say i love you jesus i love you
[1:29:41] jesus let me pretty soon you'll speak in
[1:29:42] tongues that's what i tried to do
[1:29:45] you know we're not so we're mature to
[1:29:47] some degree but church we got to go
[1:29:49] higher in christ amen
[1:29:51] because if you're really following love
[1:29:53] your desire for god's
[1:29:54] powers his supernatural powers to flow
[1:29:57] through your life
[1:29:58] and the lives of the saints the bride of
[1:30:00] christ fellowship
[1:30:02] i just better let me close up here
[1:30:07] yeah quench not the holy spirit verse 21
[1:30:09] despise not prophesying
[1:30:12] so there was something going on in their
[1:30:13] church where they just despised when
[1:30:15] people would
[1:30:16] foretell events isn't that sad
[1:30:20] now this should tell us all the opposite
[1:30:22] so we should hunger for the holy spirit
[1:30:24] not quench the holy spirit but we should
[1:30:25] welcome the holy spirit right
[1:30:27] we should we but we got to act like it
[1:30:29] we got to come here and
[1:30:30] act like lord you're welcome here we
[1:30:32] want to see your power we want to see
[1:30:33] your glory
[1:30:34] we want to see you help people heal
[1:30:36] people give them wisdom and knowledge
[1:30:38] and
[1:30:39] and faith and we want us we want to see
[1:30:41] you new miracles amen
[1:30:44] and we've got to say lord send us a
[1:30:46] prophecy send us a word of the lord
[1:30:48] to go before us verse 21
[1:30:52] prove all things hold fast that which is
[1:30:54] good so i've used this scripture
[1:30:55] just to prove doctrine but really in
[1:30:58] context
[1:30:59] it's proving the prophecies right it's
[1:31:02] proving that
[1:31:02] if god did something supernatural here
[1:31:04] you can prove it by the results it bears
[1:31:07] right that's that's in context what it's
[1:31:10] talking about but
[1:31:11] yes it applies because remember the
[1:31:13] bereans search the scriptures daily
[1:31:15] whether these things were so so every
[1:31:18] day
[1:31:19] they proved it what paul was saying it
[1:31:20] was the scripture
[1:31:22] every day they proved it every day they
[1:31:24] read their bibles to make sure their
[1:31:26] their prophet was saying the word of god
[1:31:28] amen
[1:31:30] praise god that's right
[1:31:33] jesus foretold peter's three denials he
[1:31:35] foretold it
[1:31:38] against prophesied of a famine
[1:31:43] and that kind of reminds us of that
[1:31:44] corona virus prophecy but it was given
[1:31:46] after the fact right
[1:31:48] we didn't hear it beforehand
[1:31:53] the one thing that was spiritual was i
[1:31:54] told my wife and i were talking and
[1:31:56] she's a witness of it too
[1:31:57] we're talking about taking a break from
[1:31:58] bible club and right after we were
[1:32:00] talking about taking a break from bible
[1:32:02] club that's when the
[1:32:03] i told that i even told the bible club
[1:32:04] parents that i said we're going to take
[1:32:05] a break from bible club and then the
[1:32:06] coronavirus came in and we've had a huge
[1:32:08] break from it
[1:32:11] so that that was one thing where i look
[1:32:12] well that looks pretty
[1:32:14] spiritual you know i need i need a break
[1:32:16] i just need time to get in the word
[1:32:18] i just need time and god sent this huge
[1:32:21] break
[1:32:23] uh it looks a little bit
[1:32:26] phillip had four virgin daughters who
[1:32:28] prophesied imagine that four
[1:32:30] people that could prophesy in the church
[1:32:33] see look and notice it points out their
[1:32:35] physical consecration because
[1:32:37] if you operate gifts you got to have
[1:32:38] spiritual consecration too
[1:32:40] and they go together right present your
[1:32:42] body a living sacrifice unto god
[1:32:45] they go together
[1:32:50] and brother brooks told about the
[1:32:51] numerous pastors passing away in 2013
[1:32:54] that was
[1:32:54] a time time stamp prophecy
[1:32:58] he said he said i'll tell you that in
[1:32:59] the name of the lord i remember that it
[1:33:00] was like in january 2013.
[1:33:02] then we saw lee vale joseph coleman and
[1:33:05] i think it was lonnie jenkins i think it
[1:33:06] was numerous brothers
[1:33:09] uh some of them want good brothers good
[1:33:10] brothers some of them off the word
[1:33:14] and then my wife and i i told you have
[1:33:15] the prophetic dreams where we went to
[1:33:17] warn individuals
[1:33:18] of satan's snares and both uh turned it
[1:33:21] down and
[1:33:21] both fell into the same thing that we
[1:33:24] had warned them about
[1:33:27] and let's stand to our feet i'm gonna
[1:33:28] stop right there let's stay north
[1:33:30] because i don't want to go too late
[1:33:37] if we follow the holy ghost we will
[1:33:40] desire spiritual gifts
[1:33:46] that's what i love about how god's been
[1:33:48] leading me to write this book and now
[1:33:49] i'm done
[1:33:50] i'm right now i'm just working on one of
[1:33:51] the appendix i'm waiting on the sister
[1:33:53] from alabama to send me her edits i'm
[1:33:54] waiting for
[1:33:55] cam dave uh dustin and simon no pressure
[1:33:58] on them if they're watching no pressure
[1:33:59] they have church tonight anyway but now
[1:34:01] i'm just waiting on everybody else send
[1:34:02] me your edits
[1:34:04] and uh it's ready to go but that's one
[1:34:06] thing because this is the first place
[1:34:08] i've ever seen gifts of the holy spirit
[1:34:11] clearly taught like what do you say
[1:34:14] about iranians let me get that
[1:34:16] again he said uh
[1:34:19] unusual clarity and conformity to the
[1:34:23] word of god
[1:34:24] i hope as i preach on gifts i hope
[1:34:26] they're becoming more clear to everybody
[1:34:28] that's my prayer that they're clear and
[1:34:30] then you can start looking at your life
[1:34:32] and see wow i see some of that talent
[1:34:33] here
[1:34:34] i see some of that talent there
[1:34:37] and god help me to be faithful
[1:34:41] with those talents musicians if you'll
[1:34:44] come
[1:34:52] i think i want to read that scripture
[1:34:53] here yep first corinthians 14 1
[1:34:56] follow after charity and desire
[1:34:58] spiritual gifts but rather
[1:35:00] that you may prophesy so we need to come
[1:35:02] to church
[1:35:04] right let's not say the bible we need to
[1:35:06] come to church desiring all the gifts
[1:35:07] but especially god give us a prophecy
[1:35:11] now we've heard so many people prophesy
[1:35:13] about presidents well you got a 50 50
[1:35:15] chance
[1:35:16] that's not really a hard prophecy right
[1:35:20] but it would be wouldn't it be so
[1:35:21] comforting or edifying to know something
[1:35:24] about the future
[1:35:25] i'm not even talking about their
[1:35:26] presidential race i'm just talking about
[1:35:27] something in the future
[1:35:30] like what about a prophecy that god was
[1:35:31] going to save uh my mother and bring her
[1:35:34] into
[1:35:34] the messenger you know just think about
[1:35:35] something like that would that be so
[1:35:36] uplifting
[1:35:38] wouldn't that be so powerful that make
[1:35:40] you excited to come to church i mean
[1:35:42] you're
[1:35:42] you're happy to come to church but i'm
[1:35:44] talking about excited and really zealous
[1:35:45] to come to church
[1:35:47] to hear from god that's what and
[1:35:50] see the message churches i've lost that
[1:35:52] everybody you talked to brother brooks
[1:35:54] uh sister karen any beatrice we talked
[1:35:56] about last week
[1:35:58] people used to come to church so excited
[1:35:59] right and there was still a little bit
[1:36:02] of that when we first came in
[1:36:04] what i mean by that people really
[1:36:06] praying they'd pray before service and
[1:36:07] after service
[1:36:08] people just get on their knees and pray
[1:36:11] especially the young people we
[1:36:12] i remember that they still do it kind of
[1:36:14] a camp church some of the saints will
[1:36:15] stick around
[1:36:16] they'll pray on their knees
[1:36:20] but that that's what everybody who's
[1:36:21] been around the message says there was
[1:36:23] such
[1:36:24] desire for and then they had more
[1:36:25] miracles well why is there less because
[1:36:28] people are not following charity
[1:36:31] right they're not following the baptism
[1:36:33] of the holy ghost because they aren't
[1:36:34] born again
[1:36:36] but the bible says if you follow the
[1:36:38] holy ghost charity
[1:36:40] you'll desire spiritual gifts and more
[1:36:42] prophecy
[1:36:43] more prophecy
[1:36:47] thank the lord
[1:36:51] and i'll just be honest i don't know how
[1:36:53] we're going to get there i'm trusting
[1:36:54] god to get there
[1:36:57] charis i'll just keep preaching on it
[1:36:59] wednesday after wednesday
[1:37:02] sunday after sunday and god's going to
[1:37:05] do it at some point
[1:37:06] we don't cover this church in vain right
[1:37:09] how many times has god answered our
[1:37:10] prayers
[1:37:11] helped us bless us we know he's here
[1:37:14] praise god
[1:37:16] and we're the ones that got to get in
[1:37:18] the in order with the word
[1:37:20] and then we got to wait for the time and
[1:37:21] season to do it
[1:37:23] but in the meantime we can be a church
[1:37:25] of unusual
[1:37:27] clarity on these supernatural things
[1:37:30] and we can conform to the apostolic
[1:37:33] teachings of god's word
[1:37:38] i long for the day i long for the day
[1:37:41] when saints come
[1:37:43] 40 brother man said 45 minutes early
[1:37:45] hour early and
[1:37:46] come specifically to pray and see if
[1:37:48] there's any prophecies
[1:37:49] tongues interpretations can you imagine
[1:37:52] that
[1:37:53] the brotherhood said they'd have to he
[1:37:54] said when it's done right you write out
[1:37:55] the prophecies
[1:37:56] and you bring them before i've said them
[1:37:58] on the pulpit and they're announced
[1:38:00] beforehand and judged
[1:38:02] can you imagine that
[1:38:10] think about what we had this week right
[1:38:12] the supreme court justice died and she
[1:38:13] was one of the most
[1:38:14] pro-abortion justices ever
[1:38:17] that god had mercy on your soul but what
[1:38:20] what if we were to come to church
[1:38:21] uh that's uh two sundays ago and said
[1:38:24] thus saith the holy spirit
[1:38:26] this one of the supreme court justices
[1:38:28] is gonna die and this one's going to be
[1:38:30] appointed now what about that
[1:38:32] and we would have to stand there and
[1:38:34] judge that say wow i don't i'm not sure
[1:38:36] not from god or not
[1:38:40] and you know the president's going to
[1:38:41] announce it on saturday who he's going
[1:38:42] to nominate for that
[1:38:44] can you imagine that though that that's
[1:38:47] i don't know how that would relate to
[1:38:48] the church the living god but
[1:38:50] i'm just giving you a solid example
[1:38:51] something told beforehand
[1:38:55] and then it's got to be judged before
[1:38:56] the church can you imagine being the one
[1:38:57] to judge that
[1:38:58] you better be prayed up
[1:39:02] but then if you make a mistake you
[1:39:03] better be ready to repent
[1:39:05] and say lord try me again try me again
[1:39:09] i judged it wrong i made a mistake maybe
[1:39:12] i didn't
[1:39:13] i wasn't in my bible that week or maybe
[1:39:16] i had some unconfessed sin i had to
[1:39:18] confess that's why i missed the judgment
[1:39:21] you imagine coming to church like that
[1:39:22] would that be glorious
[1:39:25] that's what my heart longs for i know
[1:39:27] yours does too let's have a word of
[1:39:38] prayer
[1:39:40] follow after the baptism of the holy
[1:39:42] ghost

[1:40:08] god to supernaturally help us
