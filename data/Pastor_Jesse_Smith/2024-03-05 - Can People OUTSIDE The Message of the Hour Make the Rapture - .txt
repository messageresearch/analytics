TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you want to make the Rapture amen how many's interested in making the Rapture say God I want to make it with all my heart greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question he ask can people outside the message of the hour make the Rapture my brief summary of my answer by God's grace is that I think no people outside the message of the hour cannot make the Rapture that's based upon the holy scriptures the King James Bible but I also want to say it's possible God could Rapture people outside the message if they were born again since God can do anything hi friends my name is Jesse Smith I'm Pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio been pastoring here for 17 years and by God's grace I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to to his true Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 and I also defend brother branham's Godly Christian character so let's begin with the Bible proof that I believe scripture teaches only Believers inside the message of the hour can go in the Rapture now it's clear according to two Parables a person must be born again which means their soul is filled with the Holy Ghost in order to go in the Rapture of course there could be more scriptures but we find these two examples in Jesus's two Parables the first is the wise and foolish virgins from Matthew 25 1-13 and the second is the parable of the King's son in Matthew 22 1-14 in the wise and foolish virgin Parable the wise virgin was the only one to go out and meet the bridegroom so we believe that's a type of getting caught up to meet the Lord in the air according to 1 Thessalonians 4: 16 and 17 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with a trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain should be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord so that scripture about getting caught up to meet the Lord in the air we see the parallel of that in the parable of the wise and foolish virgins only the wise go out to meet the bridegroom and of course the only difference between the wise and foolish was the oil so oil types the Holy Ghost according to Zechariah 4 the Bible says not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord that's Zechariah 4:6 then of course there's two anointed ones and they're likened into two trees two olive trees so of course olive trees produce olives and olives give us olive oil and it was the oil from the olives that was giving light to the seven lamps on the Candlestick in Zechariah 4:2 now let's go a little further here by God's grace looking at more Bible proof so I ask myself this question can people receive the Holy Ghost outside the message so see you have to have the Holy Ghost to go in the Rapture but can you get the Holy Ghost outside the message now my Bible answer is no and that's according to Acts chapter 2 where the Holy Ghost fell on the people inside the message of the hour we'd say and then Acts chapter 8 the Samaritans who receive the Holy Ghost after Peter and John prayed for them these Samaritans had to have contact with the preachers from the message of the hour we see the same thing in Acts chap 10 with Cornelius and his house they had to receive the preachers preaching the message of the hour which was Peter and then they received the Holy Ghost and then Acts chapter 19 the Ephesians they were Justified and Sanctified following Apollos but they needed to hear Paul a preacher of the message of the hour in order to be born again so it seems from the scripture that only people inside the message of the hour or in contact with preachers of the message of the hour can be born again but I also want to say God could fill people with the Holy Ghost outside the message so for example I've met a Muslim a former Muslim who said Jesus appeared to him in a dream and vision he got converted and then he found a message church and received the Holy Ghost in the message church since preachers often can't get into Muslim nations it seems like Jesus is appearing to some of them through dreams and Visions which is an awesome thing that God is doing God is so gracious and merciful so it seems God could reveal himself to people outside the message but then the Bible says that we're to come out of her my people so every True Believer would want to come out of any false religion the mother Harlot religion or any of her daughters it's according to Revelation 18:4 then Hebrews 10 says we should gather more as we see that day approaching that's Hebrews 10:24 and 25 so it seems any person filled with the Holy Ghost with then want to gather with Holy Ghost filled Christians and leave false churches and to go along with that it seems the Bible is teaching Holy Ghost filled Saints are gathering together with other Holy Ghost filled Saints and they're Gathering unto Christ unto the Rapture like 2 Thessalonians 2:1 says our gathering together unto him and then Ephesians 4 8-6 says the five full ministry will bring us all to the unity of the faith so again Holy Ghost filled Believers being unified and then 1 John 2:19 says they went out from us because they were not of us so anyone who's not elect will leave the elect and of course we see this in the parable the King's son as well which we'll get to in a moment the Rapture o is with an elect group a chosen group just like in Matthew 27:52 the Bible said many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and were seen of many and brother Brandon pointed this out in the Seven Seals series the Bible said many Old Testament Saints not all the Old Testament Saints it was an elect group the group that was living near Jerusalem that's why Joseph said he wanted his bones buried in the promised land so he could be a part of the Rapture the resurrection of his day and of course that was the fourth Rapture we're taught there's six raptures in the scripture so even for the fourth Rapture the Believers had to be in an elect group in order to be in the Rapture they had to be planted in the promised land they' to be buried in the promised land and we believe that's a type of being buried with Christ by baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then being filled with the Holy Ghost here in the New Testament and now looking at these two Parables you know the wise and foolish virgin Parable the wise virgins had to have prepared oil to go to meet the bridegroom the Bible said they took oil as they went forth to meet the bridegroom both the wise and foolish heard the Midnight Cry and Jesus end that Parable by saying watch therefore so the foolish virgin were not watching like the wise so it appears again only people inside the message with the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be watching for the Rapture and then secondly the king's son's Parable I love this Parable Matthew 22 1-14 in verses 1-8 it shows how Israel rejected Christ and then the Gentiles are spoken of in verses 9-14 I like the scripture the king visits the Gathering for the final separation of the guests the guests who have the wedding garment and the guests who don't have the wedding garment and one man is found without a wedding garment I believe this wedding garment types the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is also the oil from the wise and foolish virgin Parable because both Parables teach there's one thing the believer needs in order to make this marriage supper of the Lamb we'd say in the Virgin Parable it was oil in this Parable it's the wedding garment so these two symbols must be the same thing the baptism of the Holy Ghost just as Ephesians 4:30 says we're sealed by the Holy Ghost unto the day of our Redemption Romans 8 says the Holy Ghost is the first fruit of the resurrection and so this man without the wedding garment is speechless he has no testimony of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's taken away and again Jesus says watch therefore and I believe this Parable teaches that the Holy Ghost will come down through the church I believe in the rain which is rapturing Faith the time of the squeeze and the Holy Ghost will separate the foolish virgin from the wise virgin and I believe this is more proof that people that are born again inside the message of the hour only those people who are born again will make the Rapture so I hope this answer is sufficient by God's grace it's the best to my understanding right now and of course I'm always open to correction I think I'll close this video by just showing the six reasons the Rapture is pre-tribulation I've a video about this so I'll leave a link in the description also wrote about it in my 2021 book beginning on page 709 and going to page 718 reason number one the Great Tribulation is described as trouble for Israel trouble for the foolish virgins trouble for the Sinners but not for the Holy Ghost filled bride second reason is there's no mention of Christ's bride or church in the tribulation text in the Book of Revelation the third reason is the bride or the true church is specifically promised a pardon from God's Divine wrath the fourth reason is the bride or true church is foreshadowed to receive a pardon from God's Divine wrath the fifth reason is Jesus and Paul taught the Rapture was imminent at an unknown day and hour as an approaching Thief while other views can number or count to the day of Jesus's return and the last reason number six the Rapture is the removal of the grace of God for Gentiles in preparation for the antichrist's public Revelation and God's return to the Jewish people you want to make the Rapture am how many's interested in making the Rapture say God I want to make it with all my heart hold to God's unchanging hand are your heads bowed in this in mine knowing that we are bowing our heads to the dust from which we were brought someday will return knowing that you got a soul in there that has to answer to God and if you feel that you're not just ready for that Rapture that if it would come tonight and you'd want to be remembered in prayer just raise your hand we have no place to make an altar call your altar is in your heart anyhow raise your hand God bless you you you my feeling I'm not ready brother brand I I really I I I want to be a Christian I've tried to be but there's always something missing I I know that I'm just not where I should be have mercy God I raise my hand be merciful to me now some 20 30 hands has been up already in this little group more is going up dear God you know what's behind that hand down there out of the heart I pray dear God there's only one thing I'm responsible for that's to tell the truth and dear God they want to be saved they want to really they they don't want this something it's just some emotions some workup some uh uh denominational system some Creed some Dogma that's been added they understand father that it takes a pure unadulterated word of God everything else will pass away even heavens and earth but it won't if we be that word the Earth will pass from beneath us but we can never pass away because we are that word the Bride of the groom I pray for each one that you will grant to them Father as my sincere prayer and excuse me Father for being so nervous tonight jumping up here late and being shaky and saying words broke up and cut up somehow another great Holy Spirit splice them together in your own Divine Way and deliver them to the hearts of the people from my heart and the motive and the objective that in my heart I have towards you won't you Lord and Save which can be saved draw to you Lord and may we be ready for
