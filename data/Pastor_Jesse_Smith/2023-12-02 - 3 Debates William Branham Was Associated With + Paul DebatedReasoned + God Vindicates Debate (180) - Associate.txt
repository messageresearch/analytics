TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] when he Fe the paper that I was in a debate greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show that God's Prophet brother William brandham was associated with at least three debates according to his own words over the last few years I found that some people do not think debates are helpful or let of the Lord and of course that's wrong according to the Bible and also according to God's Prophet brother brandom and so I felt the inspiration to make this video by the grace of God so here's the outline we'll look at the three debates brother Brandon was associated with second we'll look at the biblical foundation for debate third we'll listen to quotes from Brother brandom about these three debates he was associated with and then fourth we'll share some personal testimonies from my life about the debate I had in 2020 and I hope will'll be a blessing to you the three debates brother random was associated with the first debate brother random was associated with was the 1950 Houston Texas debate it was a Divine Healing debate between Dr best and brother Bosworth and Friends remember brother brandham permitted this debate to happen he permitted his name to be published in the newspaper associated with this debate and then God Vindicated this debate as God himself in the form of the pillar of fire took a picture with his Prophet brother William brandham so I'll just briefly play this quote from 1950 at Thy word brother brandom said all the Christians came by the hundreds by playing trains and everything when they saw in the paper that I brother brandham was in a debate let's listen to the quote and there they come find hundreds and hundreds of miles by plane trains and everything come special when you see the paper that I was in a debate the second debate brother Brandon was associated with was a debate on tongues and he actually had moderators in the debate and the debate was about whether tongues was the evidence of the Holy Ghost or not in the debate brother brandom said love was the evidence of the Holy Ghost and that's scriptural and that ties in with all the other quotes of brother brandham because if you have the love of Jesus Christ you will receive the message of your hour the Holy Ghost will guide you into all truth of the scripture so let's listen to the quote from 1960 debate on tongues briefly listen to these statements where he said so in the debate the brother on the other side was the visitor in the debate let's listen to the quote so in the debate the gracious brother he uh in being the visitor I said now I'm willing to discuss this with you if you will stay strictly with the scripture and don't leave the scripture the third debate brother brandham Associated himself with was a debate with with a Lutheran Dean named Dr hegry I believe I might be mispronouncing that and brother Ram talks about this debate in that sermon debate on the tongues from 1960 and this debate was on whether or not Satan can heal and of course brother random said Satan cannot heal let's listen to this quote very briefly I said now that answer is like Dr AG up there time you about Luther you know when I told him he remember the debate that we had you know there on the about the um uh it tell me about that witch woman you know that prayed for the sick and they got healed and said God couldn't heal you her know that so now that we've seen the three debates brother and was associated with let's move on to biblical foundation for debate there's numerous scriptures that could be used such as first Peter 3:15 be always ready to have an answer for the reason of the hope that's within you 1 Thessalonians 5 prove all things the book of First John try every Spirit but I think one of the main scriptures is Acts 17 1-3 Paul went into the synagogue of Jews and verse 2 said Paul as his manner was went in unto them and three days and three Sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures opening alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead then verse four says some believed so there was fruit to Paul's debates and notice Paul debated every Saturday in the Greek Lexicon the word reason means to mingle thought with thought to ponder revolve in mind to converse discourse with one argue discuss of course we know the Holy Ghost filled Church age messenger St Paul the prophet of God was not arguing in the negative sense because there's of course a Godly way to argue and then there's an ungodly way to argue because the word argue in the dictionary simply means to give reasons or cite evidence in support of an idea action or Theory typically with the aim of persuading others to share one's view notice there's no mention of anger or hatred in this definition it simply means giving your reasons or evidence in support of your idea in the Greek the word opening Paul was opening means to Rouse in one The Faculty of understanding or the desire of learning Paul was led by the Holy Ghost to try to help them understand or learn how Jesus died and Rose from the grave grave according to the scriptures remember learning is not bad learning is actually the result of Revelation because in Matthew 11:29 Jesus said come and learn of Me Jesus used the word learn so there's nothing wrong with learning because learning is the result of Revelation Revelation is unveiling so if something's unveiled you learn what's underneath and that's according to the scripture the word alleging means to set before one in teaching to set forth to explain so when Paul would explain things he was teaching the Jews about how Christ fulfilled all the prophecies about him and some believed praise God for that the other verse for debate and godly debate of course is Isaiah 1:16 to18 I'll just skip down to 18 this is the verse brother brandom uses come now and let us reason together sayith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow and there God is saying let us reason in the Hebrew it means prove decide judge rebuke reprove correct be right convince or convict brother Bram said this is what brother Bosworth said at the 1950 Houston debate he said I'm not here to debate of course meaning with anger or sinful debate but with holy debate which is reasoning by the Holy Ghost and brother brand said this in 1952 experiences brother brandom said that brother bosor said we're here tonight to discuss or to come and reason together upon the words of God let's listen to the quote so Mr Bosworth got up a gallon old soldier at the cross stood this is straight and 30 he stood there and he said we are not here tonight to Fu or to debate he said we are here tonight to discuss or to come and reason together he said upon the words of God he said I have 600 different statements concerning Jesus Christ today and his attitude towards the six is so now that we have the biblical Foundation set let's look at quote from Brother brandham this quote at Thy word 1950 brother brandham tells about brother Bosworth getting permission to go to the debate and brother Bram said you can go if you don't argue and then he said his name was in the newspaper that advertised the debate and brother Bram said quote I was in a debate so anyone that says brother brandham wasn't in a debate doesn't know the quotes brother Ram said quote I was in a debate let's listen to the quote ask brother B let me go if you don't argue said I'll not argue so they call the debate and the papers all cared headlines and everything and there they come flying hundreds and hundreds of miles by plane trains and everything come special when they see the paper that I was in a debate the second quote is from God commissioning Moses 1953 brother Bram said Doctor best got real mad angry and he turned around and slapped another preacher in the face so notice Dr best got angry of course that's a sin and then he slapped somebody that's abuse that's violence from a devil and yet when brother brandham came down to pray to close the debate the Holy Ghost took a picture with brother brandham in one place brother Bram said it was the angel of the Lord so even in the midst of Satan anointing Dr best and other people the Holy Ghost come down calm down the audience and God took his picture with his Prophet brother brandham let's listen to the quote so after a while he kept saying and the moderators called him down he didn't answer one question or nothing he called and he got real angry and he turned around and slapped another preacher in the face and when he did that and he had hired the Douglas Studios of Houston that come out and take six 8 by 10 glossy pictures of him now here's the remark he said I'm going to skin that old man take his hide off of him and hang him up on the skin on the my study door rubs some salt in it for a memorial and Divine Healing sounds like a Christian doesn't it so then he said that about brother boswood but the skinning went the other way the next quote is from 1950 God revealing himself to the people brother Ram said regarding the 1950 debate I will not say a thing I'll listen to Dr Bosworth and them holding the scripture discussion then brother Bram says don't never argue with people so here he gives a definition the negative definition of debate because there's a positive definition for debate and then a negative definition brother Ram says never argue and fuss never get in the evil spirit of debate and then I love what brother Rand said he come down from the balcony at the end of the debate and he said don't no one feel sorry or feel bad at Mr best so although Dr best had an evil spirit on him brother Bram told the audience don't feel bad at Mr best in other words love your enemies Trust to win them over with love let's listen to the quote I was sitting way up high I said I will not say a thing tonight I'll listen to Dr Bosworth and them holding the scripture discussion but don't never argue with people you just stand still and let God do the thing I wouldn't argue wouldn't debate with no one I don't believe in it in the first place I can only state watch truth if you want to believe it all right if you do not there'll be others who will believe it isn't that right and don't ever argue don't debate God's word not to be busted over like that every person has her right idea and those who believe all right those who do not believe just the same and just then something is picked me up like that and when it picked me up I knew I was to go forward and I come down out of the balconies walk to the platform just as walk the platform I said it's too bad that people have to argue over the word of God I said don't no one feel sorry or feel bad at Mr be because that's all right but I said that's not the Baptist belief because I was rocked in a Baptist cradle in myself and I know the Baptist believe in Divine Healing now praying for the sick and I said that's not a Baptist belief that's Mr best belief alone next quote early spiritual experiences 52 brother Ram again tells how brother Bosworth wanted to have the debate and brother BR said if you promise me you won't fuss and brother Bram said all right so brother Bram said all right to a debate as long as there was no fussing let's listen to the quote I thought that's pretty funky like old Caleb let me go take that City I kind of admired the old brother I looked back few minut I said all right brother Bosworth if you promise me you won't fuss now he's sitting here listening at me and he said I won't fuss I'll just give him the gospel I said all right the next quote from experiences 1952 brother Rand talked about watching brother Bosworth debate and brother Ram said oh my there it is I never thought of that in my life that old Caleb standing there anointed see so brother Bosworth cornered Dr best in the debate with the word of God showing if the names of Jehovah apply to Jesus then Divine Healing still applies in the New Testament brother brandom called Dr Bosworth an old Caleb remember Caleb was the one who went in the promised land with Joshua he had another Spirit which was the Holy Spirit he was just as strong at 85 as he was at 45 and brother Bram compares the man who was debating standing on the scripture Dr Bosworth with Caleb let's listen to the quote he said Mr be I'll ask you one question if you'll answer me yes or no whatever way you answer me then the discussion will be over he said was the Redemptive names of Jehovah applied to Jesus yes or no I drunk down I oh my there it is I never thought of that in my life that old Caleb standing there annoyed him it was different from that Seminary experience setting back there from reading and writing arithmetic he had never thought of those things in the next quote it's from expectancy 1952 here's actually a fourth debate brother brandom said he was associated with so I'm sorry I didn't catch this till now but I'll still put on the video there's three debates because that's how I started the the recording but here brother brandom says he would debate and which doctors would be standing near him during a debate brother Bram said I could stand there amongst the witch doctors debating because he knew my loved ones in America were praying for him let's listen to the quote sometimes when you're debate heing witch doctors and everything else standing nearing Skeptics and unbelievers and everything trying first thing falls on my mind is my loved ones in America is praying somebody's bound to be praying because they got literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people at pledge they would pray and that many people there's prayer going before God constantly fing see what I mean constantly moving all the time so this next quote sby of a good cheer 1954 brother Brams talking about brother Bosworth debating brother Bram said it did him good to hear Dr Bosworth teach because he could still tie up Satan in the scriptures brother Ram said he heard brother B worth in discussions and debates and he preaches in such a way Satan just can't stand around where he's at so notice brother raham says a man Anointed The Holy Ghost Satan cannot stand around that man when that Holy Ghost anointed man is debating let's listen to the quote usually I don't do this and um and enjoyed the ministry of my brother Bosworth his preaching his teaching he he was teaching this gospel when I was a probably before I was born and I does me good to hear him how he can still tie Satan up in the scriptures and I've heard him in discussions debates and I tell you he preaches the word in such a way the Satan just can't stand around where he's at when it comes to the word he certainly is not as loud maybe as some but he certainly knows what he's talking about next let's look at the debate brother Brandon had with initial evidence not being tongues he said he had moderators uh the first quote was from debate on tongues third paragraph 1960 August 7th brother brandham said that brother Leo was anxious to get brother bram's memory of this debate on tape and that's what they did in Yakama Washington let's listen to the quote now when I first began in this debate that brother Leo is anxious to get on tape here I suppose I see it flickering I guess he's got it running now um I would not U Want You brother Leo to use this to hurt or anything but just I know you wouldn't and I wouldn't say to you brother if a man speaks with tongues all right if he doesn't speak speak with Tong that still is no sign he hasn't got it the next quote it's paragraph 8 brother brandham said in the debate he was willing to discuss the scripture as long as at the end they could shake hands and Ste and still feel Brothers one to another let's listen to the quote so in the debate the gracious brother he uh in being the visitor I said now I'm willing to discuss this with you if you will stay strictly with the scripture and don't leave the scripture and I said then at the end of the discussion if you can shake my hand and we'll still feel Brothers one another because if you don't I wouldn't do it see I said because perhaps when it's over you're going to feel the same way you do and I will do the next quote brother brand said they had moderators businessmen they just took down the facts so this proves brother random was an active participant in at least one two or three debates let's listen to the quote but being we got uh moderators here at sworn business manual and so forth that they just they're just they're not interesting either side they're just taking down what facts no matter what their decision is it's just is five or six man just on certain scripture when this scripture is given who takes it who really throw the light on it that's one it tells so next quote brother brandom said this debate lasted 5 hours from 7 until about 2:00 a.m. in the morning it was lengthy debate let's listen to the quote so that taken up most of his time and then it was my time we was from about 7:00 till about 2: in the morning so um was lengthy so um then when he come back he had about 30 35 minutes on that then uh they arrested the people then let me speak again let me speak so I never left his scriptures I Stay right with his scripture that's the only way he can correctly sensely I'm just as open to know what's truth as anybody else in the final two quotes from Jehovah Gyra 56 brother brandom said brother Bosworth won the debate in Houston in 1950 and then brother brandom said he won the debate on tongues in paragraph 30 he said but this fellow lost the debate you know so I just want you to see how brother brandham could say who won debates whoever stayed with the word of God won the debates let's listen to the quotes now the Lord has seven compound Redemptive names we we know that and Jehovah jyra is the one the Lord will provide for himself a sacrifice then he is still Jehovah gy that's how Mr Bosworth won the debate that night with the Baptist minister at Houston Texas when the angel of the Law's picture was taken when on that very one thing that so then but this not a lost the debate you know of course there's a lot more but you see what I'm talking about come right back to the beginning right back to the beginning lastly let's look at testimonies now Friends by God's grace in 2020 it was September I had a debate defending brother brandom as a genuine prophet of God most of the feedback I got from the debate was positive but of course there was some negative feedback even from message Believers and that's fine Brother random said Jesus had to live above all the criticism so any Christian who's trying to do something is going to be criticized but by the grace of God I felt led to do that debate I felt led of the Holy Ghost after prayer fasting preaching the word especially after seeing how Paul defended the gospel in Philippians 1:7 and Philippians 1:17 while I was preaching that in Philippians 1 I felt the Holy Ghost anoint me to say I was born to defend this message and then as I left the pulpit I got an email invitation for that debate so I truly felt it was led of the Lord for me to do that debate one negative feedback I got was the daughter of a famous message pastor and she called the debate stupid and normally I don't use that wording but that's her words and it's so sad that she would say that when people say harsh things like that it shows how much they don't know about the message because as his video showed brother brandom supported debates and then God Vindicated debates and of course the foundation for all that is the Holy Bible with St Paul with Isaiah with John's words Paul's words and Peter's words of course by the grace of God so over these last three years since the debate I've got a few testimonies where message believers who were struggling with whether to stay in the message or not watched the debate and decided to stay in the message and then the debate and the following podcast and videos defending brother brandham helped a few people stay in the message and for that I'm eternally grateful by the grace of God and even this week I got an email email thanking me for the debate from a brother in Ghana Africa he said he's been praying for the last few years that God would provide us someone to defend this message and then he found my debate just this week and when he found it he wept he said I wasn't able to thank God enough he said I thank God for answering my prayer and he said brother Smith I don't need a dime from you as a content black preacher of this message I only need a small favor do me this favor keep the message defended and the Lord Jesus Christ glorified if we don't meet on this side we shall meet on the other side keep it up I love you and God bless you bye friends these type of emails make everything worth it by the grace of God and I appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ vindicating the debate he led me to have in 2020 of course he'd already Vindicated the debating of St Paul and of course God's Prophet brother brandham in Houston in 1950 in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing on the topic of debate now of course there could be many other quotes I know there's quotes about how debates can be negative but I wanted to clearly show through these quotes from brother brandham that he supported debates done in brotherly love and kindness and being able to shake hands at the end of the debate and tell somebody they're still your brother that's how I ended my 2020 debate I told the brothers God bless you I'll be praying for you and I don't know if they'll stay true to Christ or not I don't know if they'll fall away from the faith or not but I wanted to treat them as a brother and so I tried to embody what the Holy Ghost had said through St Paul and also brother brandom so if you have any other quotes about debates you'd like to share with me just put them in the comments by God's grace I'll try to respond to them when I can if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
