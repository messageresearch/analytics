TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ does genesis 4 verse 1 disprove the serpent seed doctrine it reads and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord the answer is no genesis 4 verse 1 does not disprove the serpent seed and here's the reason why genesis 4 verse 1 is the literal interpretation of the symbolism in genesis 3 verse 6. by god's grace i briefly addressed this question in my 2021 book the 12 new testament mysteries revealed on pages 625 and 626 if you're new to the serpent seed doctrine and have questions about it please see the description section below for links to my three-part video series about this important subject before we get into genesis 4 verse 1 please know there are at least nine proofs of the serpent seed doctrine which are also in my 2021 book on pages 616 through 625 they are proof or evidence number one the bible supports the serpent seed doctrine from genesis to revelation evidence number two the two trees in the midst of the garden were not literal trees because the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not good for food evidence three the tree of life was jesus's spirit because there is only one way to eternal life evidence for the serpent seed doctrine explains the purpose of the virgin birth of jesus evidence number five adam and eve covered their loins after eating the forbidden fruit evidence six god's punishments for eve's sin centered on her sexual reproduction and longing for adam evidence number seven the serpent was human-like before the fall evidence number eight cain was the serpent's son and not adams and evidence number nine the seed of the woman was a literal man jesus and so was the seed of the serpent a literal man cain now back to genesis 4 verse 1. yes friends genesis 4 verse 1 is the literal interpretation of the symbolism in genesis 3 verse 6. in genesis 4 verse 1 everyone understands the word new means sexual relations but this verse is only a repeat of genesis 3 verse 6 wherein eve shares the fruit with adam the previous nine evidences support this because the fruit of adultery and eve's sexual relations with adam produce two seeds and remember god is the one who originated the two seeds or serpent seed doctrine in genesis 3 verse 15. god said he would put enmity between thy seed the serpent's seed or offspring and her seed the woman's seed or her offspring so again the serpent seed doctrine did not originate from brother branham or any other man god is the one who gave us the understanding that there were two seeds in the garden of eden genesis 4 verse 1 repeats genesis 3 verse 6 with a literal interpretation along with further information about the act including cain's name and gender simply put genesis 3 verse 6 is symbolic and genesis 4 verse 1 is literal the bible often switches from symbolic to literal interpretation as easily seen in a couple examples think of revelation chapters 17 and 18 as the first example in chapter 17 verses 3 and 4 you see a seven-headed beast and an evil woman symbolically described but their literal interpretations are found in chapter 17 verse 9 and chapter 18 verse 10 because the seven heads mean seven mountains and the woman represents that great city or rome a second example is again in genesis genesis has multiple events repeated in succeeding chapters with additional information provided such as chapters 1 and 2. genesis 1 verses 26 through 31 records mankind's creation on day 6. but genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and verses 21 and 22 gives more information about the same event by detailing how god created adam and eve's bodies from the dust of the earth and breathe life into them so here are three examples wherein the bible switches from symbolic to literal interpretation and this is undeniable friends as the bible says in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established the serpent see does not pertain to salvation before finishing this video friends believers do not need to accept the serpent seed doctrine to be saved since it does not pertain to salvation justification by faith is the doctrine needed for salvation but the serpent see doctrine shines more light upon the gospel story and it takes away the confusion about the original sin knowing the forbidden fruit was adultery and not an apple helps you understand why god sent jesus christ via the virgin birth sin came into the world through sex so our deliverer messiah jesus christ who delivered us from sin's curse had to be virgin born and free from the sin nature in order to take all our iniquities upon him and pay our sin debt yes friends the serpents see doctrine answers the question why did jesus christ have to be virgin born he had to be virgin born because he had to bypass the way sin came into the world sin came in the world through lust or adultery between even the serpent so jesus christ had to come to the world in a sinless way in a way that would not give him the sin nature he had to come by virgin birth he was conceived of the holy ghost let's listen to brother branham's quote that says serpenty does not pertain to salvation and the seed of the serpent that's the killer many people don't believe that but if you'll just read in genesis the bible said that the serpent had a seed and i'll put enmity between the serpent seed and the woman's seed so the serpent had a seed and the serpent's seed was spiritual then jesus was not a man so the woman's seed was spiritual they both had seeds and the enmity is still there a serpent had a seed and if you just take your bible and get out and be real reverend before god i believe god will reveal if you and if you do not understand it i'm i'm available any time to do my very best to help you by a letter or by or by a personal interview or anything that i could do to help you of course we realize that that doesn't save a man neither does it condemn a man but it only brings life upon the subject that we're all trying so hard to get the people to see everybody it only brings life in closing if you have any questions about genesis 4 verse 1 please reach out and contact me i'll try to do my best to answer your questions again we're thankful for the revelation the light that shines upon the bible thanks to the revelation of the serpent seed doctrine if you have any questions comments or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
