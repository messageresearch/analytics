TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to show that brother branham's statements about 1977 were predictions only and 1977 was not a prophecy as we listen to brother branham very carefully we can find at least three reasons why he thought the year 1977 was significant and those three statements along with the 21 mentions of this subject point to the fact that this was just a prediction and not a prophecy and of course i could be wrong this is my opinion based upon the quotes that i can hear and i'm always open to correction so i believe believers would greatly benefit from hearing all the quotes on this subject as i've talked with different ministers recently and i think this video would be a help to many by god's grace and if there are any quotes about 1977 that you don't hear on this video please share them with me and no doubt they'll help me or enlighten me by the grace of god here's the outline for the video first we'll look at the timeline and the content of the 21 mentions brother branham gave about 1977 and this includes 19 times he said this was a prediction second we'll look at the three reasons why brother branham thought 1977 was divinely inspired as he said in the church age book and of course there could be more reasons but i found three and lastly we'll refute the two incorrect explanations about 1977. the timeline of all 21 mentions about 1977. the first three mentions of 1977 were in the sermon teaching on moses from may 13 1956 you'll hear brother branham say the word predict three times and also specifically say i don't say the lord told me this let's listen to the quote and remember i predict that before the great total annihilation which i don't say the lord told me this but i believe there will be something happen either between now or at that time and 77 it may come back without but between now and 77 i predict that either a great destruction or total annihilation of the empire earth between now and 77 i predicted it in 1933 the fourth time he mentions 1977 is in the sermon by faith moses july 20th 1958 brother branham again says the word predict twice in this quote and he specifically says this is not the lord saying this let's listen to the quote and then there will come a total annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out and that i predict now this is not the lord saying this the other about the woman in his is the lord but i predicted in 1933 that the world would be total annihilation before 77. i'd like to point out that this was the quote where brother brandon predicted total annihilation in the united states with just tree stumps left before 1977 so this statement clearly proves brother brandon was just predicting because total annihilation did not happen before 1977. there was never a time in the united states before 1977 when only tree stumps were left it seems brother brandon was just greatly convinced a world war iii type of war was going to take place in america before 1977 and of course that did not happen but that's okay brother i'm still a prophet he never said thus saith the lord the fifth mention is from the sermon condemnation by representation from november 13th 1960 brother branham specifically said predict let's listen to the quote i remember lord that's what the lord showed but i predict this will take place before 1977. this prediction our base because of the all-rushing slot that's coming now how fast it was moving how long it'll take until this nation meets its place the sixth mention is from the sermon conference from november 25th 1960 brother ram said the word predict and he specifically said not in the trance this statement is very important as we'll see later in this video it seems from brother brown's tapes brother adam never had a vision about 1977. let's listen to the i turned to quote and i've seen in the united states as a smoldering something that burned up and down beneath there i said not in the trance but i predict remember this i guess this is taste too i predict that these things will take place between now 19 and 33 and 19 and 77 which will give us 16 more years if not prediction tracks right the seventh mention was from the sermon the ephesian church age from december 5th 1960 brother brahm said the word predict once and he also said not the lord told me so the lord did not say anything about 1977. that was brother ham's own thought let's listen to the quote [Laughter] but i predicted according to a vision that was shelby some uh years ago that five of those things as i was seven has already taken place about the eighth mention is from the fire tier and church age december 8th 1960 brother branham said the word predict let's listen to the quote his stumps are burning rocks blowed out the whole united states is like as far as i could see where i was standing and i said i predict according to the way time is moving it'll be sometime between this year 33 and 77 and it'll have to squeeze a little hard to get through there the ninth and tenth mentions are from the sermon the laodicean church age from december 11 1960. brother branham said predict four times in these quotes and said three important statements he said i don't say it will be he said i could miss it a hundred years and he said i could be wrong the fact that he said i could be wrong proves there was no prophecy related to 1977 because thus saith the lord could never be wrong and the year 1977 was never spoken with thus saith the lord let's listen to the quote we believe that the lady ocean church started in 80 1906. i predict i remember predict especially today i don't say it will be but predict that it will end by 19 and 77. that the church will go completely into apostasy and shall be ousted out of the mouth of god and the second coming or the rapture of christ might come anytime and i can miss that a year i can miss it 20 years i can listen 100 years i don't know where but i just predict that according to a vision he showed me and taking the time the way it's progressing i'd say it'll be sometime between 33 and 77 at least this great nation is going to strike a wall that's going to glow into bits see now that's pretty close awful close i could be wrong in the next sermon the 70th week of daniel we have the most times brother branham ever spoke about 1977 in one sermon there are eight mentions of 1977 in this sermon preached on august 6 1961. brother branham says predict three times and he specifically said don't misunderstand and say brother branham said jesus will come in 1977. let's listen to these quotes now counting the time we find that we have exactly listen 17 years left and we will have the same span of time given to us as god dealing with us in the power of the holy spirit since 1833 until 1977 the same span of time of 1954 years god deals with us the same as he did with the jews amen amen how about that hallelujah from the first jubilee of leviticus 25 8 and 1977 will be the 70th jubilee making exactly 3 430 years we got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees and what will it be oh brother watch close now don't miss it it'll be the jubilee of the going up of the gentile pride and the return of christ to the jews when they go out of bondage that was in 1933 and i predicted that there would be some great tragedy happen to this united states before or by the year of 1977. how many remembers me saying that look at the hand i'll predict at the time i don't know why i'm saying it but i predicted that'll all happen between right now 19 and 33 and 19 and 77 and not knowing it god knows my heart i never know it until yesterday that 1977 is the jubilee and exactly the same amount of time run out that you give with israel and everything at the end i do not want anyone to go away misunderstanding this hate's still plain i don't want anyone to misunderstand don't misunderstand that i'd say brother bannon said jesus will come in 1977. i never said no such thing amen jesus may come today but i have predicted that between 33 and 77 something would take place this sermon in particular the 70th week of daniel is the sermon where brother branham gives us two reasons why he thought 1977 was significant and of course i'll speak on that in the next section of this video i also want you to notice the seventh week of daniel was the last time on tape brother branham said the year 1977. that's quite significant so that includes 1962 63 64 65. the next four years of brother iran's ministry he never mentioned the year 1977. and then in the book the exposition of the seven church ages brother brandon mentions 1977 three times in the church age book brother branham said the word predict three times for a total of 21 mentions throughout his entire ministry he specifically wrote i did not say prophesy and i do not prophesy let's listen to the quotes the laodicean age began around the turn of the 20th century perhaps 1906 how long will it last as a servant of god who has had multitudes of visions of which none has ever failed let me predict i did not say prophesy but predict that this age will end around 1977. if you will pardon a personal note here i've based this prediction on seven major continuous visions that came to me one sunday morning in june 1933. based on these seven visions along with the rapid changes which have swept the world in the last 50 years i predict i do not prophesy that these visions will have all come to pass by 1977 and though many may feel that this is an irresponsible statement in view of the fact that jesus said that no man knoweth the day nor the hour i still maintain this prediction after 30 years because jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so i repeat i sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and usher in the millennium the three reasons brother branham possibly thought 1977 was divine inspiration based upon the quotes i've read and listened to it seems there are three reasons brother branham strongly emphasized 1977 but of course there could be more and i'm open to receiving other quotes from viewers if i'm not aware of them notice i'm only using quotes from the tapes and not personal stories that are not recorded on tape i'm using brother rams recorded words only before sharing these three reasons i must point out two truths about the 1977 prediction that many fail to understand first brother ram said he did not know why he said 1977 after he first received the seven major visions of 1933. this means brother branham did not have a vision about 1977 for if he did he would have known why he made a 1977 prediction he specifically says i don't know why i'm saying it so brother ram didn't seem to know why he said 1977. let's listen to the quote i said the way progress i got back to one of their wall and run to the other wall i said the way progress is going on i'll predict at the time i don't know why i'm saying it but i predicted that'll all happen between right now 19 and 33 and 19 and 77. secondly 1977 was not in the trance wherein he saw the seven major visions this quote proves again that the 1977 prediction was not part of any vision from the lord jesus let's listen to the quote and notice he said not in the trance then our time to look and are seen in the united states as a smoldering something that burned up and down beneath there i said not in the trance but i predict remember this i guess this is take two i predict that these things will take place between now 19 and 33 and 19 and 77. so we conclude brother branham never had any visions at least recorded on tape related to the 1977 prediction reason number one why brother branham emphasized 1977 brother random seemed to think that jews and gentiles would have the same amount of time to receive their covenants in the quote you'll soon hear from the 70th week of daniel brother branham says the jews and gentiles each got 1954 years to receive the covenants from god brother brahm said from the time god gave the covenant to abraham in genesis 12 verse 3 until the time of jesus's rejection in a.d 33 he said that time was 1954 years and then brother adam said from 33 a.d to 1977 would be 1954 years now of course if you do the math 1977 or 1977 minus 33 or 80 33 is 1944 so it seems brother band was 10 years off in this calculation so this miscalculation again shows how this 1977 prediction was just that it was a human prediction and of course if i've done anything wrong on my math or anything please let me know i'm always open to correction let's listen to the quotes a striking statement from the time god made the promise to abraham don't miss this from the time god made the promise to abraham genesis 12 3 to the time of christ being rejected in 1833 by the jews according to galatians 3 16 and 17 and according to usher's ushers ursus chronology of the hebrews the power of god was with the jews exactly 1954 years god dealt with the jews 1954 years according to the chronology of the jews and according to galatians 3 16 and 17 it got many more scriptures but just did that then after they rejected christ he turned to the gentiles to take a people for his name do now counting the time we find that we have exactly listen 17 years left and we will have the same span of time given to us as god dealing with us in the power of the holy spirit since 1833 until 1977 the same span of time of 1954 years god deals with us the same as he did with the jews amen how about that reason number two brother branham thought 1977 was the time god would return to the jews because it was supposedly 3430 years since the first jewish jubilee in the same sermon the seventh week of daniel brother branham said the first jubilee took place at about 1453 bc and this was spoken of in the bible in leviticus 25 verse 8. and so if you do the math 70 jubilees would be 70 times 49 or 3430 years and if you add the years from 1453 bc to 1977 that matches the 3430 years that it would take to cover 70 jubilees so in other words brother branham was saying god had to return to the jews after the 70th jubilee and of course that was brother iran's prediction that did not come to pass the jews are still blinded to the new covenant but it shows again how brother ben was trying to use math and historical biblical dates to predict the year that the lord might return brother branham may have been using math and dates because as you'll recall brother branham said in the church age book that jesus did not say we could not know the year month or week of his coming and notice also in this next quote you'll hear brother branham say he learned about the 70th jubilee from historian named paul boyd which again shows brother branham was not a plagiarist let's listen to the quotes now mark down in your book a little scripture here i want to give you leviticus 25 beginning with the eighth verse god called the jubilee every 49th year the 50th year was a jubilee we know that we understand that from the first jubilee of leviticus 25 8 and 1977 will be the 70th jubilee making exactly three thousand four hundred and thirty years jubilee means release oh we're watching for the coming of that glad millennium day when our blessed lord shall come and catch his wedding brought away oh the world is growing crying for that day of sweet release when our savior shall come back to earth again did you get that yes god has dealt with us exactly the same amount of time that he dealt with the jews from the time he gave abraham the promise until the rejecting of the messiah in 80 33. was 1954 years and now we have 17 years left we had about 1930-something years we got 17 years left until 77 will be the 70th jubilee since the beginning of jubilees and what will it be oh brother watch close now don't miss it it'll be the jubilee of the going up of the gentile pride and the return of christ to the jews amen when they go out of bondage amen don't you see from all the world together there for that day hallelujah see where we're at we don't know what time it might happen oh brother we're at the end of it now listen to your old timers here in the in the church has been here for a long time i want you to notice something i never learned this until yesterday i picked it up from historian paul boyd and then i traced it back to the scriptures picked up these other dates here and so forth and got it and run it traced it through before moving on to the third reason i also want to show a quote from the end of this sermon the seventh week of daniel wherein brother branham said this 1977 prediction was a scriptural teaching he said just absolutely perfectly scriptural proof so based upon these two numerical predictions that pointed brother branham to the year 1977 although the first one was off by 10 years brother random made it sound like it was a vindicated bible-based teaching as you listen to the quote notice brother random is convinced the end is so close he says we may never live to get back again tonight to the evening service there on august 6 1961. so again this shows how a bible-based prophet like brother branham could believe something was just absolutely perfectly scriptural and be wrong but that's okay brother branham said i could be wrong about the 1977 prediction he said that numerous times let's listen to the quotes little children we never know we may never live to get back again tonight we may never live to see one another again i don't know but the end is so near the end is so close here's the scripture there's this absolutely perfectly scriptural proof now if there's something you didn't understand write me a note let me know about it see say something some of your brethren out there on the tapes and the other parts if there's someone i can help you let me know reason number three brother branham thought no democracy had ever lasted 200 years and therefore thought the united states of america could not last 200 years after the year of its inception 1776 which 200 years later would have been 1976. in this masterpiece quote from july 5th 1964 brother ram said no democracy had lasted 200 years i haven't studied this extensively but it seems accurate as the ancient greeks had a democratic rule for almost two centuries according to the encyclopedia britannica website and the ancient greek golden age of democracy was around 430 bc but again we can clearly see how brother ram felt the nation would not survive or live to see 1977. let's listen to the quote as we see the days darkening as we see the shadows falling when i predict it's just a few more turns of the sun this nation's gone do you know yesterday fourth of july thomas jefferson had signed the declaration of independence him and the other uh lord that was with him and the liberty bell rang and we was declared an independence as a nation according to history there has never been a democracy at any time last over 200 years that was 17 and 76 july the 4th and we're just 11 years left will it make it no can't 11 years if it does it'll break all history so i believe these are the three reasons why brother branham wrote his prediction about 1977 was with divine inspiration in the church age book first he thought the jews and gentiles would have the same number of years to receive their covenants 1954. he thought 1977 would be the 70th jubilee for the jews and god would return to the jews and third the historical fact that no democracy had lasted over 200 years remember brother branham felt he had bible verses to support his prediction namely the historical dates related to abraham in genesis 12 3 galatians 3 verses 16 and 17 and acts 15 verse 14. and he had scripture for the historical dates related to moses and the jubilee in leviticus 25 verse 8. and then thirdly he had the historical dates related to the ancient greeks before finishing this section i want to share one more brother random quote related to predicting the end of time in november 1963 brother graham said our calendar said there were 36 more years for the work to be over he was finishing his sermon the three kinds of believers trying to get every person to be saved and said the end would be either 36 years 15 years or 20 years which would be 1999 1978 and 1983 respectively it's clear brother branham was doing everything in his power to influence young and old to repent and be saved before it was their time to die and meet god or before the great tribulation period set in brother adam lived in a tumultuous time politically as he mentioned atom bombs and president kennedy's assassination in this quote he even prayed and asked god for forgiveness for his mistakes asking for strength to make the gospel more plain to the ears let's listen to the the power to quote like enoch and not have to die but just take an afternoon's walk and go home with him but god i do believe that it will happen because i know there's to be a rapture in the last days and the works to be cut short the father so says our calendar 36 more years and the work will be over and you'll have to come sometime within that or there'll be no flesh saved and then we're told by the chronologists and the people who search such things that we are absolutely advanced many many years from that many years on up they're telling us by the calendars that we're way up further than that maybe there's only 15 or 20 years left i don't know but i know even according to our calendar we're almost there i see where there cannot be any hope left for there is coming if they ever start turning those bombs loose on each other lord there will be no battlefront they'll they will destroy one another the lord is hanging there and yet the bible says the whole heavens and earth will be on fire god i see the hour appearing i think of assassination of the president and then see that other evil man come in without letting the man have a trial and shot him down in cold-blooded murder oh god one's as guilty as the other they have no right to do that evil in our own nation supposed to be a christian nation what a poor example we are lord of christians forgive us lord of our sins help us oh god especially your church i i'm only trying to do this because i feel your commission is for me to do it so father here i am doing the best i can with forgive my feeble mistakes lord i pray that you shall grant me strength i'll be able to make it more plainer to the people refuting two incorrect explanations about 1977. i've heard numerous interpretations about the 1977 prediction but two of them i've heard most often and i believe both are clearly wrong first some say the 1977 statement was a prophecy or divinely inspired and that the world literally changed in 1977 both naturally and spiritually this is the more widely held belief of the two beliefs so was 1977 a prophecy i believe the answer is no 19 times brother branham said it was a prediction plus he said the following quotes about this prediction quote i don't say the lord told me this this is not the lord saying this not in the trance not the lord told me i don't say it will be i could miss it a hundred years i could be wrong don't misunderstand and say brother branham said jesus will come in 1977. i did not say prophesy i do not prophesy end quote again brother brahm said i could be wrong about 1977. prophecies spoken with thus saith the lord could never be wrong so this again proves 1977 was just a human prediction and not a prophecy also did the world literally change in 1977 well in one sense it did but in another sense there was no significant change that was unlike any other year what i mean by that is that i think it's safe to say the world changes every year with 2020 being a prime example of how quickly the world can change especially regarding the shutdowns and the mask and vaccine mandates so i don't think the position is valid to say 1977 changed the world unlike any other year some have said that 1977 changed the world because the apple company began and also elvis died and a few other reasons but the same can be said for other years what about 1973 when abortion became legal never before had millions upon millions of babies been aborted some would say that was a more drastic change than anything that happened in 1977. didn't the murder of millions upon millions of unborn children change the world for the worse didn't the world change when the amazon company began in 1994 without a doubt didn't the world change in 2015 when the supreme court ruled homosexual marriages were legal of course that was a change for the worse but yet wasn't it a more significant change than elvis dying or the beginning of the apple company also people have asked me what about the supposed vision brother branham had about 1977 it's been spread abroad about a supposed vision brother branham had of 1977 and in his vision it was pitch black after or around 1977 but friends there is no quote from brother branham on tape about this supposed vision some who hold this position do not seem to realize what they're doing they're actually contradicting themselves for example some of these same believers say say what the tapes say yet those who say say what the tapes say are in the case of 1977 saying don't say what the tapes say related to 1977 say what an unknown or unnamed brother said about a supposed conversation he had with brother branham in my humble opinion i cannot support this blatant contradiction how can we say say what the tapes say in some cases and in other cases we can say don't say what the tapes say say what this brother from another country said and then there's a second contradiction as well some of these same believers say you can't correct a prophet and yet they are correcting brother branham's words that clearly state 1977 was not a prophecy and just a prediction and that brother brahm did not know why he said 1977. so again they say you can't correct a prophet but when they speak about 1977 they are trying to correct a prophet they're trying to make his words a prophecy yet brother adam clearly said they were just a prediction remember i've already shown in this video the three reasons brother branham gave for believing 1977 was an end date for the united states of america and two of them come from the 1961 sermon daniel's 70th week wherein brother branham explained by dates and counters why he was amazed the dates of both abraham's covenant and moses's jubilee years seemed to work out to 1977. the second less-held view is that the 1977 statement was a prophecy and we are now in the millennium due to the church age book quote about ushering in the millennium as you heard earlier this is the less held view friends brother branham clearly said the laodicean church age goes on until the rapture of the church let's listen to the quotes brother branham have you made statements recently concerning that church age has ended ladies no i never said it's ended if i did you misunderstood it i said it wrong it is this is the last church age it's the end of church ages the lady will see it it hasn't ended when it ends the church is gone so as long as the church is here it hasn't ended i think a church has ended and as blacked out the bride is called we have already entered into the tribulation period no no no you i wish i could just have more time on that thing see the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease lady asea goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping version for three and a half years while israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation sets in upon israel and then comes the battle of armageddon which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennium reign after that comes a white throne judgment after that comes the new heavens and new earth and the new city coming down from god out of heaven eternity and time blends together also the rapture is the time of the church ages being capped off with christ coming brother brandon may have taught the capstone was already put on but then he changed it in 1961 brother branham taught the capstone was the rapture here's the quote daniel said he watched this gentile age until a stone come out of the mountain that wasn't cut with hands they have never put a capstone on that pyramid [Music] you see it and what did it do it hit the image right smack in the feed and broke it to pieces hallelujah amen what happened at that time the coming of that stone up with the church in the glory at the rapture cause it ended and then in 1965 brother graham said the capstone had still not come let's listen to the quote sometimes the capstone will return the head of all of it and receive the writing to himself which the woman is taught from the man a part of the man next if 1977 was the end of the united states that means daniel's 70th week began in 1977 so that means the first half of the seven year tribulation period lasted from 1977 to the middle of 1980 and then the second half of it lasted from the middle of 1980 to 1984. so does this mean we're now in the 38th year of the millennium the answer is no also if we're in the millennium where is the video proof of the two jewish prophets preaching during the last three and a half years of the great tribulation period which would have been from 1977 to the middle of 1980. where's the video proof they turned water to blood and ceased the rain for three and a half years and the proof that they died resurrected and went in the rapture to heaven as revelation 11 declares of course there is no proof because this never happened yet in this next quote brother branham said a thousand years of peace has not happened and this was spoken in 1964. brother brahm said there would be no sin during the millennium anyone who believes we're in the millennium is totally deceived because they sin every single day and brother branham and the bible say there'll be no sin in the millennium because satan is bound in the bottomless pit and he cannot influence people to sin let's listen to the quote so sin will still be on the other side of milan but not doing the millennium see doing millennium is peace see but sin will be dealt with the other side of millennium and then time fades out and now the opening of the seven seals that was given by the holy spirit the seven seals only was to make knowing what had been left off in the dispensations behind us also notice in the next quote from 1953 brother branham says we'll reign here with christ for a thousand years if we're in the millennium where is brother branham currently physically ruling and reigning here on the earth the answer is he's not because we're not in the millennium let's listen to the has done quote the penalty of death done been taken off and now we just go right into his presence and someday return back and be made immortal and live on this earth a thousand years of jesus christ amen i believe that i'm strictly a millennial i believe in the millennium i believe all these hebrew prophets and through the ages spoke on the golden age of millennium coming and i believe we're gonna have it and we'll reign here with him a thousand in closing friends i hope this video has been a blessing over the years i've been asked about the 1977 prediction many many times i've even preached on it a number of times but i felt led this was the time to really study it out as deeply as i ever had and i trust by the grace of god that you can now see that it was a prediction and not a prophecy of course you and i are going to come across people we may disagree with so the main thing to do is have christian love brother branham said we ought to be able to disagree bitterly with someone but then at the end of the conversation think as much of them as christ thinks about them which christ thinks a lot about them because christ died for them so i'm going to end the video with that quote what this world really lacks what the churches lack and what the message lacks in many cases is divine love and also brotherly kindness jesus said because iniquity shall abound the love of god shall wax cold so if there is one place you should find the real love of god it should be in the true bride of jesus christ the true bride no doubt agrees about many things in the scripture there may be a few things here there that the members don't agree about but even in disagreeing they should express the love of jesus christ one toward another let's listen to the quote you don't want to get like oswald see if you can't disagree with a man and things then shake his hand and still have the same feelings towards him then there's something wrong with you if i can't disagree with the men bitterly from one side to the other and still think as much of him as as christ would then there's something wrong with my spirit i haven't the spirit of christ if he says well brother branham i believe that you are teaching is this uh all right brother let's come together to reason you and i we'll take it ourselves we'll go over here in the room to ourselves we'll reason out and he just cuts me to pieces and i have to say things back to him if in my heart i can't feel the same about him and he's still my brother and i'm trying to help him then i'll never help him there's no way for me to help him if i don't love him what's used to going over there telling the first place first brother i don't love you and let me get that out of my heart right here before we go in there because i can't help you until i love you if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
