[0:03] Many times someone has said, "Brother
[0:06] Bram, why is it you always take the Old
[0:09] Testament?" Nearly always taking a text,
[0:11] you'll go back to the Old Testament. I
[0:14] do it because I like typology. God never
[0:18] used idols. He always used man. God
[0:22] don't use machinery, mechanical devices.
[0:24] He uses man, individuals.
[0:28] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:33] this video is to see a parallel with the
[0:35] current Brandham tabernacle leadership
[0:37] and how they've closed the doors, the
[0:39] physical doors of their church. And I
[0:42] believe this was foreshadowed by King
[0:44] Ahaz in the Old Testament. And of
[0:46] course, this video is made in brotherly
[0:48] kindness in hopes that the leadership at
[0:51] Brandham Tabernacle and the people there
[0:53] will repent and get back to public
[0:55] worship, opening their doors and
[0:58] inviting their congregation back into
[1:00] the house of God rather than telling
[1:02] them to stay at home and neglect
[1:05] gathering more as we see that day
[1:07] approaching. So the main Bible verse
[1:09] that I believe Brandham Tabernacle is
[1:12] neglecting as far as the focus of this
[1:15] video is Hebrews 10 24 and 25. The Bible
[1:19] said, "Let us consider one another to
[1:21] provoke unto love and to good works, not
[1:24] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:26] together as the manner of some is, but
[1:28] exhorting one another and so much the
[1:30] more as you see that day approaching."
[1:33] So we see the importance of saints
[1:35] gathering together. It stirs us up to
[1:39] love better, to love one another, to do
[1:41] more works for the kingdom of God, for
[1:43] the Lord Jesus Christ. And we should do
[1:45] it more, gather more as we see that day
[1:47] approaching. The manner of some is to
[1:50] forsake assembling. And that's a sin.
[1:53] So, Holy Ghost fil Christians are
[1:54] gathering more as we see that day
[1:56] approaching, not laying out of church.
[1:58] And if I'm not mistaken, Brandham
[2:00] Tabernacle hasn't gathered physically
[2:02] since March of 2020. So over 5 years
[2:06] they've sat at home and not gone to
[2:08] church. Despite all the quotes where
[2:10] brother Random says, you can't be as
[2:13] good of a Christian if you stay at home
[2:15] and don't physically go to church. And
[2:17] despite the quotes where brother Ram
[2:18] said, even if I just agreed with one
[2:21] thing with a church, I'd still go to
[2:24] that church to show everybody which side
[2:26] I'm on.
[2:28] People say I can stay at home, be just
[2:30] as good a Christian as I can at church.
[2:31] You can't. The Bible said not forsake or
[2:34] assemble ourselves together and that
[2:36] much more as we see the time coming. If
[2:38] you're a Christian, you long to go where
[2:40] other Christians are and fellowship with
[2:41] other Christians. So you cannot stay
[2:44] away from church and live the same life.
[2:46] It can't do it because it's like I I I
[2:49] I'm hungry, but I'll never go to a
[2:50] table. I just I'll never eat. I just
[2:52] ain't going to do it. See, you've got to
[2:54] go and feed on the word of God and
[2:55] fellowship one with another. If I lived
[2:58] in a city and they had nothing there but
[3:01] u uh well some church I don't want to
[3:05] call any names but just any church that
[3:07] only believe one thing that Jesus was
[3:09] divine all the rest up is wrong. I'd go
[3:11] to that church if I can't get a whole
[3:14] loaf of bread. I I'll take a slide. I'll
[3:17] go listen worship the Lord and show him
[3:19] that I'm doing my part. I want them to
[3:21] know I'm alive. I'm I'm want everybody
[3:23] to know what side I'm on. assemble with
[3:26] the Christians and their worship and and
[3:28] serve the Lord. And now you've got tapes
[3:31] on that. You got tapes on what we
[3:33] believe. You got tapes on discipline of
[3:35] the church. How we behave oursel in the
[3:38] church of God. How we got to come here
[3:39] together and set together in heavenly
[3:41] places. Don't stay home. Amen. If God is
[3:46] in your heart, you can't hardly wait for
[3:47] them doors to open out to get in here to
[3:50] fellowship with your brothers. If you
[3:52] don't don't feel that way, then I tell
[3:54] you, it's time you got to praying
[3:56] because we're in the last days where the
[3:58] Bible exalted exhorted us to to much
[4:01] more as we see that day approaching to
[4:04] love one another with Christian love and
[4:06] divine love to symbol ourselves together
[4:08] in heavenly places and and and Christ
[4:11] Jesus and love one another. This will
[4:14] all men know you're my disciples when
[4:16] you have love one for the other. That's
[4:18] right. Stay right together.
[4:21] Now that shows that at the beginning
[4:24] they had nothing to start with. For if
[4:27] you love God, you can't you couldn't
[4:29] wire you away from church. They couldn't
[4:31] chain you away from it. They can't hide
[4:34] a believer from God.
[4:38] So what spirit is on the current bride
[4:40] tabernacle leadership that tells them to
[4:42] lay out of church and not show everybody
[4:45] what side they're on? Also, Luke 4:16
[4:49] tells us what Jesus's attitude towards
[4:52] church attendance was. His custom was
[4:54] always to go into the synagogue on the
[4:56] Sabbath. So, we know the Lord Jesus
[4:59] never neglected physically gathering for
[5:02] worship, public worship. And yet,
[5:04] Brandham Tabernacle on their blog posts
[5:06] say they are the greatest congregation
[5:09] of all time. And yet, they can't even
[5:11] gather together and worship.
[5:14] So this thought just came to me one
[5:15] morning while studying and I was
[5:17] thinking of how the Brandham tabernacle
[5:20] has been abandoned both the original
[5:22] Brandham tabernacle and the renovated
[5:25] young Foundations building.
[5:28] And I felt the spirit of God just ask me
[5:31] that question. Has this ever been done
[5:32] before in the Bible? So I started
[5:34] searching and yes this has been done
[5:37] before. God's temple has been abandoned
[5:39] before and that was during the time of
[5:41] King Ahaz. Ahaz ruled around 7:35 to
[5:46] 7:15 BC. Around 8th century BC. He was
[5:50] the son of King Jotham. He was the
[5:53] father of Hezekiah. According to 2 Kings
[5:56] 16:1-4, he did that which was not right
[5:59] in the sight of the Lord. He did a lot
[6:01] of wicked things. But the one thing that
[6:03] caught my attention was found in 2
[6:06] Chronicles 28:24. And Ahaz gathered
[6:09] together the vessels of the house of God
[6:10] and cut in pieces the vessels of the
[6:13] house of God and shut up the doors of
[6:16] the house of the Lord. And he made him
[6:18] altars in every corner of Jerusalem. So
[6:21] what caught my attention was he shut the
[6:23] doors of the house of the Lord. And so
[6:26] while I'm studying, while I'm meditating
[6:28] on these things, this seemed to be the
[6:30] foreshadowing of what current Brigham
[6:32] Tabernacle is doing. Anybody can go on
[6:34] Brandham Tabernacles website and see
[6:37] when they started this renovation of the
[6:39] Young Foundation Center. I think it was
[6:41] 2022. The work has been finished for
[6:44] quite a while now. I reached out by
[6:46] email to some of the workers there at
[6:49] Voice of God if I'm not mistaken, and
[6:51] they told me the construction's been
[6:53] done for a long time, but that the
[6:55] current pastor doesn't feel led to
[6:57] physically gather. But if you read the
[6:59] website, that was the whole point of the
[7:00] million dollars of renovations was
[7:04] because they had so many people moving
[7:05] into Jeffersonville to physically attend
[7:07] church that they needed to make a bigger
[7:09] church. Now, I hope the church opens up
[7:11] this Sunday. It probably won't, but I
[7:14] hope it does cuz then the people are
[7:15] getting closer to God, closer to obeying
[7:17] the word of God. But it's just sad that
[7:20] the current Brandham Tabernacle and the
[7:21] renovated Young Foundations building are
[7:24] sitting empty every Wednesday, every
[7:26] Sunday. The people are not gathering
[7:29] more as we see that day approaching. So
[7:31] they're breaking the scripture. King
[7:34] Hezekiah when he opened the house of God
[7:37] stated again that the people had turned
[7:39] their backs on the habitation of the
[7:42] Lord. This is in 2 Chronicles 29:6-7.
[7:46] And have turned away their faces from
[7:48] the habitation of the Lord and turned
[7:50] their backs. Also they have shut up the
[7:53] doors of the porch and put out the lamps
[7:56] and have not burned incense nor offered
[7:58] burnt offerings in the holy place unto
[8:00] the God of Israel. So the temple was
[8:02] physically closed and religious services
[8:05] ceased due to the sins of the
[8:08] leadership. And I believe that's what's
[8:09] happened at Brenham Tabernacle. The
[8:11] physical gathering and physical public
[8:14] worship to the Lord Jesus Christ has
[8:16] ceased due to the sin mainly of
[8:18] idolatry. And that idolatry is making
[8:21] every word on brother Ram's tapes, thus
[8:23] sayith the Lord. That's a lie. That's
[8:25] heresy. That's idolatry. Brother Ram
[8:29] said it was an awfulest thing to do. It
[8:31] was Tommy to make him completely
[8:33] infallible. Let's listen to the quote.
[8:35] They're claiming here that some brethren
[8:37] up there that said that I sent them up
[8:39] there and they're preaching that man
[8:41] should leave their wives and hunt for
[8:43] their spiritual mate and that um that I
[8:47] am perfectly infallible that there's
[8:49] nothing and what were some of the
[8:51] awesome
[9:04] prophesying and understand that one man
[9:06] should leave this wife and go marry that
[9:07] one. Uh this church knows that we don't
[9:09] stand for no such Tommy rod as that. We
[9:12] believe in the Bible.
[9:14] So I want to look at some parallels here
[9:16] with King Ahaz and the current Brandom
[9:18] tabernacle. There's about five
[9:20] parallels. The first one is idolatry.
[9:22] This is found in 2 Chronicles 28 2-3.
[9:27] Verse two said he made molten images for
[9:29] Balum. Moreover, he burnt incense in the
[9:32] valley of the son of Henam. Then in
[9:34] verse four, sacrificed burnt incense in
[9:38] the high places, on the hills, and under
[9:40] every green tree.
[9:43] So the parallel I'm taking is that
[9:45] Brandham Tabernacle has made an idol of
[9:48] brother Brandham's tapes. They say every
[9:51] word on tape was thus sayith the Lord.
[9:53] And that's a lie. He says that you have
[9:55] to realize
[9:58] that brother every brother Joseph
[10:00] believes everything that brother Brandon
[10:02] says is sayeth the Lord.
[10:09] Amen.
[10:11] I believe everything says the Lord.
[10:16] Brother Ram said there's mixups on the
[10:18] tapes and he said when that happens he
[10:20] said these four beautiful words look in
[10:22] the Bible because the Bible has no
[10:25] mistakes. The Bible is our absolute. The
[10:27] other day I got something mixed up. I
[10:29] happened to hear it. It's I caught it
[10:31] right there and it's on the tape and I I
[10:32] probably hear from it. Boy was a great
[10:34] teaching there. I didn't touch the edge
[10:35] of it but if you happen to catch that on
[10:38] your tape remember look in the Bible you
[10:39] see. So the Bible is perfectly true and
[10:42] that's what we stand on the Bible. It
[10:45] must be thus sayaeth the Lord. It's got
[10:48] to come to one final absolute.
[10:52] And my absolute is the word, the Bible.
[10:57] The second attribute was the temple was
[10:59] closed. 2 Chronicles 28:24.
[11:03] I read this earlier. And shut up the
[11:06] doors of the house of the Lord. And he
[11:08] made him altars in every corner of
[11:10] Jerusalem. So that's what Brandham
[11:12] Tabernacle has done. They've shut the
[11:14] doors to Brandham Tabernacle and the
[11:15] renovated Young Foundation's building.
[11:18] Now every house of their members becomes
[11:21] an altar or becomes a place of worship.
[11:24] And I just think it's so sad. Brother
[11:26] Random thought the boycott, the future
[11:27] boycott of the World Council of Churches
[11:30] and the One World Economical Movement
[11:33] would force churches to close doors. But
[11:36] that's not what's happened to Brandham
[11:37] Tabernacle. Brandom Tabernacle has
[11:40] closed their own doors. And that's
[11:41] extremely sad. It wasn't the enemy that
[11:44] closed the doors of Brandham Tabernacle
[11:46] and the Young Foundation's building. It
[11:48] was the leaders of Brandom Tabernacle
[11:50] that closed the door. That's why I
[11:51] believe there's this similarity between
[11:54] the current Brandom Tabernacle
[11:55] leadership and King Ahaz. And then
[11:58] worship was stopped. This is the third
[12:00] attribute that's similar. We know this
[12:02] is true because in 2 Chronicles 29 28
[12:07] and 29 when Hezekiah reestablished the
[12:10] worship then the congregation worshiped
[12:12] and all that were present including the
[12:14] king bowed themselves and worshiped.
[12:17] This is the Bible says and all the
[12:19] congregation worshiped and the singers
[12:21] sang. So singing was restored once
[12:24] Hezekiah restored the temple but there
[12:27] was no singing during the time of Ahaz.
[12:29] no singing in the house of God. And the
[12:32] trumpeters sounded, and all this
[12:33] continued until the burnt offering was
[12:35] finished. And when they had made an end
[12:37] of offering, the king and all that were
[12:38] present with him bowed themselves and
[12:41] worshiped. So all the worship was
[12:43] stopped. There's no singing in Brham
[12:45] tabernacle anymore. There's no prayers
[12:47] offered in the young Foundation's
[12:49] building. It just sits empty. So there's
[12:51] idolatry. The physical doors are closed
[12:54] and there's no worship service. Fourth,
[12:57] the priesthood is neglected. This is 2
[12:59] Chronicles 29
[13:01] 11. So when Hezekiah reopens the temple,
[13:06] he says in verse 11, "My sons, be not
[13:09] now negligent, for the Lord hath chosen
[13:11] you to stand before him to serve him,
[13:13] and that you should minister unto him
[13:14] and burn incense." So his father Ahaz
[13:18] did the opposite. His father Ahaz told
[13:21] the ministers and the priesthood to
[13:23] neglect their service. He shut them out
[13:25] of service. And the parallel obviously
[13:28] here is that the Brandham tabernacle
[13:30] tells preachers to sit down and just
[13:32] press play or stand up and press play.
[13:35] It doesn't matter. The sin that's taking
[13:37] place is they're telling preachers not
[13:39] to preach. The Bible never says avoid
[13:41] the five-fold ministry, the living
[13:43] preachers. The Bible never says to limit
[13:45] the five-fold ministry. The Bible never
[13:48] says press play and obey. But they
[13:50] always press play and disobey. What the
[13:53] Brandham Tabernacle is currently doing
[13:55] is promoting that preachers bury their
[13:57] talents in the earth. Like in Matthew 25
[13:59] 26. And friends, any preacher that's a
[14:02] real preacher that buries his talent in
[14:04] the earth and just presses play and
[14:07] won't preach is going to be called
[14:08] wicked and slothful servant according to
[14:10] the Lord Jesus. And brother Random said,
[14:13] "We need more preachers." And he never
[14:15] changed that after he said it in
[14:18] questions and answers 1964. So we'll
[14:20] listen to that quote. And then they
[14:22] asked, "Brother Brandham, should you be
[14:23] the only one preaching?" And he said,
[14:24] "No, there's men all around the world."
[14:26] He says, "Get in the ministry. We need
[14:28] them." And then he says, "Also, I'm
[14:31] right behind the preachers." So, we know
[14:33] if Brother Brand was alive today, he'd
[14:35] be behind the living preachers. He
[14:37] wouldn't be behind the button pushers.
[14:39] He'd be behind the true five-fold
[14:41] ministry. Let's listen to the quotes.
[14:43] Now, Brother Brandham, is it true that
[14:46] no one should preach but you?
[14:50] We have seen
[14:53] your
[14:54] We have seen you ordained man. We do
[14:59] don't believe you would do that if there
[15:02] were not if they were not to preach.
[15:06] Mercy, brother, sister, ever who told
[15:09] you that nobody's preached for me, I'd
[15:10] sure be a poor subject of God's with all
[15:13] that. No. Every man or that feels a call
[15:17] of God upon his life, get into the
[15:19] ministry, start preaching. We need them.
[15:23] Man of God are anointed all over the
[15:25] world to preach the gospel. See, I'm
[15:27] just one little pebble on the beach
[15:30] among many big stones. See, so I just
[15:34] many more eligible, more worthy, more of
[15:38] anything to preach than me. I'm just one
[15:41] little humble person laying out here.
[15:44] I'm one grain of wheat and a whole
[15:45] garner. See, so it's just, you know what
[15:49] I mean? Any man that's called of God
[15:52] needs to preach the gospel. Would we
[15:54] still be on fire and preach the gospel
[15:57] or is the time over? No, keep preaching
[16:00] this. As hard as you can preach,
[16:01] brother, stay with it. I'm right behind
[16:03] you. Fifth, and finally, there's a
[16:05] parallel in 2 Chronicles 29:10.
[16:09] Here we see Hezekiah renewing the
[16:11] covenant. He says, "Now it is in mine
[16:13] heart to make a covenant with the Lord
[16:14] God of Israel that his fierce wrath may
[16:17] turn away from us." So the opposite of
[16:20] this is true. King Ahaz transgressed the
[16:23] covenant or changed the covenant or
[16:26] neglected the covenant. And that's
[16:28] exactly what current Brandham tabernacle
[16:30] has done. And as my past videos show,
[16:32] they've changed the covenant. The sign
[16:34] of the covenant currently is the token
[16:37] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[16:39] But Brandham Tabernacle has changed it.
[16:42] Their leadership literally says the
[16:44] tapes are the token. So that's the fifth
[16:47] and final attribute that's the same as
[16:49] the days of King Ahaz with the current
[16:52] Brandom Tabernacle leadership. They've
[16:54] broken the covenant. They've changed the
[16:57] sign of the covenant. Now it's just the
[16:59] ability to push play. That's a lie.
[17:02] That's heresy. So let's listen to the
[17:04] quotes where brother Random says, "The
[17:06] Holy Ghost is the token." Brother Ram
[17:09] never said pressing play was the token.
[17:12] Let's listen to the quote. But they got
[17:15] to catch the vision. You got to play the
[17:18] tapes. They're the token
[17:23] that come from the body of our Lord
[17:25] Jesus Christ. Water, blood, and life.
[17:28] Amen. And the whole church, the bride
[17:30] together has been made up through
[17:32] justification, sanctification, and the
[17:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the
[17:37] token, as Hebrews 11 says, all these who
[17:41] wander about sheep skins and the church
[17:44] in this day that's received the token of
[17:47] the baptism of the Holy Spirit, that the
[17:49] blood has been shed, and that the Holy
[17:52] Ghost is upon the church.
[17:54] In closing,
[17:56] friends, hope this video was a blessing
[17:58] by the grace of God. You know, I did not
[17:59] plan to study this topic. This thought I
[18:02] believe came to me inspired by the Holy
[18:04] Spirit. Recently, when I listened to
[18:05] Brother Ram preaching about the invasion
[18:07] of the United States, he said, "Brother
[18:09] Brand, why is it you always take the Old
[18:10] Testament?" He said, "Because I'm a
[18:12] typologist."
[18:15] He said, 'The only way that I know to be
[18:17] somewhere near right is to see what the
[18:19] pattern was, to look off the blueprint
[18:21] and see what it was, and then I know
[18:24] what that was will be something similar
[18:26] to what this is here because it's just a
[18:29] shadow of it. And I always look back to
[18:31] the Old Testament to see what the
[18:32] children of Israel did, see what the
[18:33] punishment of sin was, see what the
[18:35] justice of the prophets was, and see
[18:37] what all those things were. And then I
[18:39] have an idea what this is here which is
[18:42] foreshadowed what will be in the general
[18:44] windup at the end.
[18:47] So that was inspired to me when I
[18:49] preached the invasion of the United
[18:50] States. And then while meditating on
[18:52] this topic the thought came to me where
[18:54] is the pattern of closing the church
[18:56] doors in the Bible and it's King Ahaz.
[18:59] But Hezekiah gives us hope. And so that
[19:02] gives us hope. If the current bread and
[19:03] tabernacle won't repent, perhaps they
[19:06] will in the future will pray for them.
[19:08] But perhaps the next generation will
[19:10] like the Bible shows regarding King
[19:11] Hezekiah, maybe they'll open the doors
[19:14] of the house of God and allow real
[19:15] preachers to use their preaching gifts.
[19:18] As brother Ram said, God never permitted
[19:20] mechanical devices to preach the gospel.
[19:23] God never use idols. He always used man.
[19:27] God don't use machinery, mechanical
[19:29] devices. He uses man, individuals.
[19:32] Hallelujah. Excuse me. I didn't name the
[19:34] holler that round. Notice I'm not
[19:36] excited. Oh, I know right where I am.
[19:38] Right. I just feel good. So, let's close
[19:41] with a prayer for current Brennham
[19:43] Tabernacle.
[19:45] Dear God, I pray for the current
[19:46] Brennham Tabernacle leadership. God, may
[19:48] they take warning from this if they see
[19:50] it. Lord God, we can see they have a
[19:52] cult mentality. They don't listen to
[19:54] anyone else except their pastor and the
[19:56] tapes, which means they won't accept
[19:59] correction. So Lord, I just pray their
[20:00] hearts would open. If they have true
[20:03] hearts, if they're hungry and thirsting
[20:04] for righteousness, they'll have a heart
[20:06] to hear this. And not just from me, but
[20:09] from anyone else who will speak the
[20:10] truth to them in love. Lord, you know
[20:12] this is done in love and brotherly
[20:13] kindness. Also as a warning, the Bible
[20:16] said them that sin rebuked before all.
[20:19] And Lord Jesus, if you anointed Brother
[20:20] Brennan to warn those people out in
[20:23] Arizona in 1964 about their cult
[20:26] tendencies, Lord, you're the same
[20:28] yesterday, today, and forever. You'll
[20:29] anoint people to do it today. So God, be
[20:32] magnified, be glorified. We pray for
[20:34] repentance for this generation of the
[20:35] brand tabernacle. And Lord, we pray for
[20:38] a Hezekiahike revival where they'll open
[20:40] the church doors and let real preachers
[20:42] in to preach the gospel. Lord, let thy
[20:45] will be done on earth as it is in heaven
[20:47] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[20:52] If you have any questions, concerns or
[20:54] testimonies about this video, please
[20:55] contact me. God bless you and may Jesus
[20:59] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[21:02] very happy to be here this afternoon and
[21:04] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[21:07] Christ to bring the good tidings the
[21:10] good news that Jesus raised from the
[21:12] dead living among men today his church
[21:15] the same Jesus that was yesterday will
[21:18] be today and forever
[21:20] is never failed
