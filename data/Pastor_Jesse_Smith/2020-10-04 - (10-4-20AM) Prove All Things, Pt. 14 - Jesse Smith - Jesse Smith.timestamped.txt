[32:15] heavenly father
[32:32] acts chapter 17 verse one
[32:43] jesus is such a wonder how could he
[32:45] cleanse our sins and then
[32:47] place the holy ghost within us what a
[32:49] wonder what amazing
[32:51] thing jesus has done
[32:56] i'll have slides after we read the text
[32:58] here so uh
[33:00] acts 17 we'll do one through three let's
[33:02] look at uh prove all things again we
[33:04] looked at it wednesday
[33:05] i'd like to continue on that by god's
[33:08] grace
[33:24] i think we'd all know that as satan
[33:27] fights against us and battles us it
[33:29] actually makes us stronger right
[33:36] and so i found that as i go back and
[33:37] listen to uh
[33:39] the little debate we had that it's
[33:41] sharpening uh
[33:42] me it's making me uh more clear on the
[33:45] scriptures
[33:46] and the truth and it as the scripture
[33:48] says it dissolves all
[33:50] doubts so we're thankful for that that
[33:52] the holy spirit
[33:53] dissolves all doubts so acts 17
[33:57] 1-3
[34:00] we'll just read one through three but
[34:01] look at verse four only some of them
[34:03] believe
[34:04] not everyone believed that paul would
[34:06] debate
[34:07] only some of them believed and so we
[34:10] know that all those who are
[34:12] predestinated to believe
[34:13] they will be saved the father will not
[34:15] lose one praise god
[34:17] we know that all that the father has
[34:19] given me will
[34:20] come it's our duty just to sow the seed
[34:23] and then any good ground that it falls
[34:25] upon it will bring forth praise god
[34:27] amen so let's read acts 17
[34:30] 1-3 let's read all three those together
[34:33] praise god
[34:34] i'd like to hear your voices as well
[34:36] let's read one through three
[34:37] on three one two three now when they had
[34:41] passed through
[34:42] amphipolis and apollyanna
[34:45] they came to thessalonica where was a
[34:48] synagogue of the jews
[34:51] and paul as his manner was went in
[34:54] unto them and three sabbath days reason
[34:57] with them
[34:58] out of the scriptures opening and
[35:00] alleging
[35:01] that christ must needs have suffered and
[35:04] risen again
[35:05] from the dead and that this jesus whom i
[35:08] preach
[35:09] unto you is christ look at this verse 4
[35:12] and some of them believed
[35:14] now remember jesus had already told
[35:16] peter he said flesh and blood
[35:19] has not revealed this unto you but my
[35:21] father which is in heaven
[35:23] amen well then how did paul convince
[35:25] some of these people
[35:26] if only the father can reveal it it was
[35:29] the father working through paul
[35:31] amen so god needs someone today right
[35:34] to be led by the holy spirit each one
[35:36] you and i as
[35:37] we witness and uh testify to others as
[35:40] we witness the holy spirit will reveal
[35:42] it
[35:42] to all those who want to see it praise
[35:44] god all those that want to be saved
[35:46] may god add his blessings to the reading
[35:48] of his word you may be seated praise god
[35:52] that thought just struck me i actually
[35:53] didn't prepare that thought what a what
[35:54] a beautiful thing god using man to save
[35:57] man brother ram said he
[35:58] always does that he works in partnership
[36:01] with man to save man praise god so if
[36:04] you could switch over there we'd like to
[36:05] show some quotes today and some
[36:07] scriptures
[36:08] by the grace of the lord you know the
[36:13] message from wednesday was such a
[36:14] blessing you know even to my children
[36:16] come up and told me after service how
[36:17] much they enjoyed that so
[36:19] i thank the lord it really helped me
[36:20] even last night i was praying that i was
[36:22] saying lord
[36:23] your strength is perfect when i'm weak
[36:27] because when i'm weak then i'm strong
[36:29] i'm depending solely upon his power
[36:31] because i have none of my own amen
[36:33] praise god
[36:34] that uh that's beautiful scripture there
[36:36] from uh ii corinthians 12
[36:39] what a blessing that is just uh uh
[36:41] pulsates in our hearts brother braham
[36:43] said that the word of god pulsates
[36:45] in our hearts because it is life the
[36:46] word of god is life
[36:49] amen so let's uh start there by god's
[36:52] grace i'm gonna put up my computer in
[36:54] case i need to look up any scriptures
[36:55] it's real handy to find that
[36:57] okay so we'll look at part 14 today by
[37:00] god's grace
[37:01] so i look uh here at the word of god and
[37:05] i just want to highlight just a few of
[37:06] those things remember it was paul's
[37:08] manner so it was paul's
[37:11] custom it was his habit paul's way of
[37:14] doing missionary work
[37:16] is to go into was to go into the jewish
[37:19] synagogues
[37:21] and and witness and wait for his turn to
[37:23] talk
[37:24] i remember paul was an older man he had
[37:26] a reputation amongst many
[37:27] uh people as a faithful jew but when he
[37:30] became a christian he became an enemy to
[37:32] many of the jews
[37:33] but yet he would go to the synagogue
[37:35] every saturday
[37:36] and in this case in thessalonica he went
[37:39] there three sabbaths in a row
[37:41] so three weeks in a row and he would
[37:43] reason with them
[37:44] out of the scriptures showing how
[37:48] the bible said jesus needed to suffer he
[37:51] needed to die
[37:52] for our sins that he could raise to
[37:54] forgive us praise god
[37:55] and the bible said he hadn't so he
[37:57] argued from the word see this
[37:59] needed to happen so god had to do this
[38:02] and so paul was doing a a scriptural
[38:04] debate
[38:05] showing by the word how these things
[38:07] that happens now look god
[38:09] god did it and then so god did jesus
[38:12] crucifixion
[38:13] and then he comes around after to show
[38:14] what he did praise god we're in the same
[38:16] today god sent a prophet
[38:18] right god finished the mysteries of god
[38:20] and here we are trying to declare of
[38:21] what god already did
[38:22] praise god but one of these days we're
[38:24] going to catch up praise god and
[38:26] the prophecy is going to catch up to us
[38:28] and we will be able to say
[38:30] amidst the latter rain that this day
[38:32] this scripture is fulfilled
[38:34] amen if that happened on the day of
[38:37] pentecost they said this day the
[38:38] scriptures fulfilled joel chapter two
[38:40] how about us with that other portion of
[38:42] joel chapter two praise god
[38:45] amen if jesus could recognize this day
[38:48] praise god
[38:49] uh what about this day and i was
[38:51] preaching that amen a few years ago at
[38:52] cam church i was preaching on this day
[38:54] the scriptures fulfilled
[38:55] and i was saying how this day the
[38:56] scriptures fulfilled how the
[38:59] jesus christ is getting a bride ready
[39:01] for the rapture
[39:02] and i was just showing the separation
[39:04] time and i said this
[39:05] day this scripture is fulfilled and a
[39:07] sister was visiting and she started
[39:08] speaking in tongues
[39:10] and we stopped the service right there
[39:11] were praising god and worshiping and
[39:13] called the prayer line come up for
[39:15] prayer see there's something about a
[39:16] church when you can catch the revelation
[39:18] of of what god is doing right now how
[39:21] many people how many want to be able to
[39:22] see what god's doing right now praise
[39:24] god
[39:24] and we're living in the midst of it this
[39:26] is the bride's revival praise god
[39:28] and if we recognize it as that then
[39:30] we'll live like that amen
[39:32] and then we know the day and hour that
[39:34] we're living in praise god
[39:36] now i want to look at this here uh is
[39:39] his
[39:40] habit was to go in amongst them now the
[39:42] reason we don't do that
[39:43] uh is because uh the other denominations
[39:46] are having church while we're having
[39:47] church
[39:49] right i've always wondered you know my
[39:52] mind i like to
[39:52] i like to maybe model this and maybe i
[39:54] will one day if i ever
[39:56] uh stop pastoring or something like that
[39:58] and try to try to go out and witness to
[40:00] others
[40:01] but i've always liked that idea of paul
[40:03] going to the churches that should have
[40:05] received the message of the hour
[40:06] and trying to argue with them to get
[40:08] them to receive the message of the hour
[40:11] i've always liked that because i know
[40:12] that's thus saith the lord how many
[40:14] believe that
[40:14] that is thus saith the lord this is how
[40:17] the first church was started remember we
[40:18] got to be returned back
[40:20] to the apostolic faith so perhaps at
[40:22] some point
[40:23] this will be our our manner of which
[40:25] maybe after they shut our doors
[40:27] right would that be something i just
[40:30] thought of that never thought of that
[40:32] but uh this was paul's manner for
[40:33] missionary work when there were no
[40:36] christian churches there were no message
[40:37] churches he was trying to start them
[40:39] praise god
[40:40] and after he started them of course he
[40:41] sent letters after he left he said
[40:43] the two letters to the churches in
[40:45] thessalonica uh
[40:46] establishing them in the faith praise
[40:50] god
[40:50] now that word reason uh it means there's
[40:53] no
[40:53] so when you look at the lexicon
[40:56] different he uh different english
[40:57] phrases
[40:58] uh are listed and it shows you know
[41:00] three four fives there's six different
[41:02] phrases
[41:03] this word reason takes one of them is
[41:05] reason
[41:06] so there's two scriptures that use this
[41:08] greek word like that
[41:10] and so this reason uh paul reason he
[41:13] uh let's look at the first definition
[41:14] thinks different with oneself now that
[41:16] wasn't what he was doing
[41:18] mingling thought with thought that's
[41:20] what he was doing paul was trying to
[41:22] mingle
[41:22] new thoughts to them praise god in
[41:25] church if i can do that today
[41:26] if the holy spirit can help me today it
[41:28] will help you if i can
[41:30] if i can help you think about god's
[41:32] thoughts
[41:33] that will bring life to you because the
[41:35] word is
[41:36] life amen and it's a thought life
[41:39] remember paul told the
[41:40] philippians one mind one accord it's a
[41:43] thought life so that's why we gather
[41:44] that's why we take out all this time on
[41:46] sunday to gather to hear the thoughts of
[41:48] god
[41:49] and to receive that thought of god
[41:51] receive that seed of god
[41:53] water with praise and it will bring
[41:55] forth of its own kind
[41:56] amen amen it means to ponder
[42:00] to revolve in your mind think about it
[42:03] over and over that's how many times i
[42:04] get sermon thoughts
[42:05] uh some will just it won't leave me
[42:07] it'll be there monday tuesday maybe to
[42:09] leave a couple days come back thursday
[42:11] or friday
[42:12] come again on saturday or sunday morning
[42:14] just come your mind comes
[42:16] back to these thoughts you want to
[42:17] revisit those thoughts
[42:19] now here's what paul clearly was doing
[42:21] he was doing some of those two
[42:22] he was conversing and discord discourse
[42:25] with one
[42:26] argue and discuss and you can argue
[42:29] right you can argue with the right heart
[42:31] the bible says you can be angry and sin
[42:33] not
[42:34] right so you can be angry arguing and
[42:37] not sinning
[42:39] didn't the bible say jesus looked at the
[42:40] pharisees and the bible said
[42:42] he was angry at them remember that in
[42:44] the scripture
[42:45] there was times he had uh i forget it
[42:47] wasn't the word angry but it was a
[42:49] a word where jesus was angered with the
[42:51] pharisees
[42:52] he perceived their thoughts and he had
[42:54] anger against them
[42:55] and there's times to do that right there
[42:57] may be times to do that
[42:59] now church though we like to err on the
[43:01] side of love
[43:03] right how many can say amen to that amen
[43:06] you wouldn't
[43:06] you know right away we think oh if
[43:07] somebody's mad then they're they got the
[43:09] wrong spirit
[43:10] well it depends jesus surely didn't have
[43:12] the right spirit i'm sorry
[43:13] jesus surely had the right spirit right
[43:15] when he was angry
[43:17] when he had the cords and he went
[43:19] through the temple and beat out the
[43:20] money changers did he have the right
[43:21] spirit
[43:22] yes he did it didn't seem like it to
[43:26] others but he did he had the right
[43:27] spirit
[43:29] and so we got to take that same attitude
[43:31] now as i was studying this morning
[43:33] i remembered brother branham preached a
[43:36] whole sermon on his debate
[43:38] with the preacher about tongues as in of
[43:39] initial evidence
[43:41] so people that say oh brother ram didn't
[43:43] believe in debates well they just don't
[43:45] they just forgot maybe brother brahm had
[43:47] numerous debates
[43:49] uh and so this one he tells while he's
[43:51] in washington he's telling about the
[43:53] debate
[43:53] this is not the debate uh i don't i
[43:56] don't have it on
[43:56] uh recording as far as i know so brother
[43:59] ram said so in the debate the gracious
[44:01] brother him being the visitor so he must
[44:02] have visited branham tabernacle
[44:04] i said now i'm willing to discuss this
[44:06] with you if you'll stay
[44:08] strictly with the scripture and don't
[44:10] leave the scripture
[44:11] and i said then at the end of the
[44:12] discussion that you can shake my hand
[44:15] and will still feel brothers one to
[44:17] another
[44:19] so these are the debates we like and the
[44:21] church said amen
[44:22] but there could be a debate where you
[44:24] could get angry
[44:25] and you still have the holy spirit
[44:28] because jesus did
[44:34] he said because if i you don't i
[44:36] wouldn't do it because
[44:37] i said because perhaps when it's over
[44:39] you're going to feel the same way you do
[44:41] and i will too so brother knew this
[44:43] brother amen most people are not going
[44:45] to be changed through a debate
[44:47] but he said he still wanted to stand up
[44:50] for the truth about the word of god
[44:52] that tongues is not the evidence tongue
[44:54] is evidence of the holy spirit anointing
[44:56] you to speak
[44:57] but it's not evidence that the person's
[44:59] born again
[45:01] and he knew at the end of the day most
[45:03] people are not going to be swayed
[45:05] but some will believe praise god amen
[45:07] some will believe
[45:08] amen now
[45:12] the next and the very next thing now
[45:14] look at this isn't this interesting
[45:16] he had a debate and he had moderators so
[45:18] and we had a debate this week didn't we
[45:20] was that this week the presidential
[45:22] debate
[45:23] seems like a year ago but all the
[45:25] busyness that happens this week
[45:27] and they had a moderator right i thought
[45:29] he did an awful job i watched a little
[45:30] bit that's my opinion
[45:33] because it was like trump was debating
[45:34] two people but being we got moderators
[45:39] here that sworn businessmen because
[45:41] that's what i went through too i felt
[45:42] like i was debating two people
[45:44] i was but being we got moderators here
[45:48] that sworn
[45:48] businessmen you know and so forth that
[45:51] they're they're just
[45:52] they're not interested in either side no
[45:54] that's not the case
[45:55] with all moderators they're just taking
[45:57] down what's facts
[45:59] so their moderators that brother debate
[46:00] would just write down the scriptural
[46:02] facts
[46:03] about what they were saying he said no
[46:05] matter what their decision
[46:06] is it is just five or six men just form
[46:09] certain scripture way
[46:10] the scripture is given who takes it who
[46:13] really throw the light on it
[46:15] that's the one that tells you see so
[46:16] brother ram had moderators
[46:18] afterwards who would say who won or lost
[46:21] the debate and he said he won the debate
[46:23] [Laughter]
[46:25] see did you know that did you know that
[46:26] random debates and people said they
[46:28] judged him whether he won or lost
[46:30] see most people don't think about that
[46:32] because maybe we haven't heard it but he
[46:33] did
[46:34] i'll show it to you
[46:38] now here while he's talking about the
[46:40] debate on tongues
[46:42] he actually goes to a different debate
[46:43] he had he at least had three debates i
[46:46] found
[46:46] and then brother bosworth were the
[46:48] pillar of fire that's at least four
[46:50] debates he was there at that debate
[46:52] okay now that answers like dr hegery
[46:56] up there that time you know the lutheran
[46:58] dean you know i told him you remember
[46:59] the debate that we had
[47:01] so brother graham had a debate with a
[47:02] lutheran doctorate
[47:06] praise god you remember the debate we
[47:09] had you know there on
[47:10] he was telling me about the witch woman
[47:11] you know that prayed for the sick and
[47:14] got healed and said god couldn't heal
[47:16] you've heard the story so brother man
[47:17] had at least these two debates one
[47:19] is tongues the evidence of the holy
[47:20] ghost and the second one
[47:22] uh divine healing is it real or not and
[47:25] then of course the question came up
[47:27] uh can demons heal the brotherhood tells
[47:29] us no
[47:31] he said but people if they approach that
[47:33] woman with the attitude of real faith
[47:35] mother
[47:35] said they can get healed now that's
[47:38] quite a subject that's a whole other
[47:39] message
[47:40] but brother ram does say that he he says
[47:42] that could happen
[47:44] he said he was telling me about the
[47:46] witch woman you know prayed for the sick
[47:47] that god healed and god
[47:48] and said god couldn't heal you've heard
[47:50] the story see you mean that i
[47:52] said sure so see brother branham
[47:55] had other debates was that new to
[47:57] anybody anybody was that new to
[47:58] then yeah good good so brother ram had
[48:00] numerous debates
[48:04] so here's where he says he won so then
[48:06] but this fellow
[48:07] lost the debate you know of course
[48:10] there's a lot more but you see what i'm
[48:12] talking about there see
[48:13] come right back to the beginning right
[48:15] back to the beginning
[48:18] so my man was saying that he won the
[48:19] debate he had moderators that judge and
[48:22] the moderators
[48:23] would look at the scriptures and say
[48:24] well we think by the brandon one
[48:27] and so brother branham had his opinion
[48:29] and then the moderators had opinions
[48:30] about who won or lost the debate right
[48:34] and so do i i'm sure
[48:35] people on the other side to believe this
[48:36] the sign side i'm sure they say
[48:38] rod won but i disagree i think i won by
[48:41] the word of god
[48:42] not that it matters but it matters about
[48:45] what who thinks or
[48:46] about god who thinks or got who you
[48:48] think or god
[48:49] forgive me it matters about what god
[48:52] thinks who won
[48:54] i can't say it forgive me i guess all
[48:56] chopped up in my words this morning
[48:57] forgive me
[48:59] it only matters about who's who god
[49:01] thinks won that's mine that's what i was
[49:02] trying to say
[49:03] it only matters about god god
[49:07] god determines who the winner is praise
[49:08] god and our word will win every time
[49:10] praise god
[49:11] amen in fact i i texted the brother
[49:15] who hosts the debate he was my moderator
[49:18] but he didn't inject any of his thoughts
[49:20] and i said who do you think won he
[49:22] thought he thought
[49:22] he said he said for sure this message
[49:24] has all the questions
[49:25] i'm sorry all the answers to the
[49:27] question he said this message won
[49:29] i said praise the lord that's exactly
[49:30] what i felt i felt better coming out of
[49:32] there
[49:32] and i had brother john graham called me
[49:34] up this week and he said i enjoyed the
[49:36] debate
[49:36] he said will you debate him again i said
[49:38] absolutely
[49:40] because i know this word right got it
[49:42] god loves battle praise
[49:44] god god is a he's mighty in battle
[49:46] hallelujah amen
[49:48] he don't back down brother said i
[49:49] remember they challenged billy graham
[49:51] one time
[49:51] and the muslim said well we'll bring
[49:53] sick people before us and you
[49:55] and we'll see who healed him and billy
[49:57] graham just left him away
[49:59] and brother bam said well he said i
[50:01] appreciate that he said but
[50:03] he said uh if i was billy graham i think
[50:05] i would have said if i didn't have the
[50:06] faith to do it i would call somebody who
[50:08] had the faith to do it
[50:10] because god is a god of showdowns praise
[50:12] god god is a god
[50:14] of battles amen he's a mighty conqueror
[50:17] he's a man of war the bible says praise
[50:19] god
[50:20] amen and yes it's a war of words but did
[50:22] brother random engage in wars of words
[50:24] yes he did amen he had at least
[50:27] those debates right there
[50:31] all right
[50:34] okay so those are the quotes i just had
[50:35] a few new quotes on debates i wasn't
[50:37] sure
[50:38] if you were aware of those or not uh i
[50:40] didn't read the one there's one i read
[50:42] when i preached it a few wednesdays ago
[50:44] brother man brother brahma had the
[50:45] debate remember against 300 ministers
[50:47] about the water baptism and the serpent
[50:49] seed how many remember that he said i
[50:50] wasn't going to go up billy said don't
[50:52] go up
[50:53] he said but the angel lord said go on up
[50:55] he said they're going to have these
[50:56] questions for they're going to try to
[50:57] trap you in your doctrine
[50:59] and the angel said do not fear i'm with
[51:01] you and the man said whenever he says
[51:03] that
[51:03] i don't fear anymore i know god is with
[51:06] me praise god
[51:07] amen and so he had at least those three
[51:10] debates
[51:12] and then he attended the debate on uh at
[51:15] the houston coliseum there
[51:16] in 1950. okay now that was uh
[51:20] just getting through our first i'm sorry
[51:22] no we're still finishing rod's second
[51:23] question
[51:24] uh the weight of doubt is overwhelming
[51:27] on brother branson's ministry what do we
[51:29] do with deuteronomy
[51:30] 18 20 to 22.
[51:34] so on wednesday we looked at some of
[51:36] those uh visions brother branham had
[51:38] and i hope it's making sense to you
[51:39] church that that with each vision you
[51:41] have to see is this conditional or is
[51:43] this unconditional
[51:44] you have to look at it that way like my
[51:46] wife shared that scripture
[51:48] from jonah if you just read jonah three
[51:50] it
[51:51] doesn't look like there's any condition
[51:53] to it let's read it jonah 3 4. let's
[51:55] read it it was just such a fresh thought
[51:56] so i appreciate my wife sharing that
[51:58] many times i'll have that my wife will
[51:59] share a scripture with me right before i
[52:01] preach
[52:02] and it's a help jonah 3 4.
[52:08] jonah 3 4. daniel hosea
[52:11] joel and amos obadiah jonah
[52:15] micah nahum
[52:20] so yeah look at the word of god here do
[52:22] we does the word of god record
[52:24] any conditions no it doesn't
[52:28] so look at verse uh
[52:32] uh verse 1 and the word lord came unto
[52:34] jonah the second time saying arise go
[52:36] into nineveh
[52:37] that great city and preach unto it the
[52:39] preaching that i bidding let me just
[52:40] stop right there
[52:41] how many know sometimes when you disobey
[52:42] god's word he'll bring the same thing
[52:44] around and say
[52:45] you need to do it now all god did was
[52:48] repeat the same thing you already said
[52:50] and sometimes you wonder why does
[52:51] sermons go service after service
[52:55] oh we already heard that well maybe
[52:56] god's waiting for some of us to obey it
[52:59] i know that's true you know with people
[53:01] that have left and where god has tried
[53:03] to warn them ahead of time and they just
[53:04] don't want it so they leave
[53:06] that's fine they can do whatever they
[53:07] want but i'm just saying if someone
[53:09] doesn't obey it god is merciful
[53:11] he'll give them another chance to obey
[53:13] it amen because god is merciful
[53:15] hallelujah if you would have been
[53:16] joining wouldn't you appreciate god's
[53:18] mercy
[53:20] he just got spit out of a whale's belly
[53:22] right arise go to
[53:24] that great city and preach unto it the
[53:26] preaching that i bid thee so he didn't
[53:28] want to preach it
[53:30] he didn't want to preach it so he
[53:31] rebelled against it and so god had to
[53:33] take him through a harsh trial
[53:35] he said i had to be taken down to the
[53:36] depths of hell jonah said
[53:38] so sometimes church our lives will seem
[53:40] like awful
[53:42] right sometimes our lives will seem
[53:45] awful because we haven't obeyed praise
[53:47] god
[53:47] but if we obey then god will raise us up
[53:50] amen
[53:51] amen to raise us up out of that
[53:53] situation to show us
[53:54] he's rich in mercy praise god and then
[53:57] he'll say
[53:58] do it again i'm going to tell you again
[54:00] do it i'm going to tell you the second
[54:02] time please do
[54:03] what i asked you to do already oh verse
[54:06] 3
[54:06] and jonah arose and went under nineveh
[54:08] according to the word of the lord now
[54:10] nineveh was an exceeding great city of
[54:11] three days journey
[54:12] and jonah began to enter in the city a
[54:14] day's journey and he cried and said
[54:16] yet forty days and nineveh shall be
[54:19] overthrown
[54:19] period do you see any conditions in
[54:22] there does anybody see any ifs in there
[54:25] i don't see any now of course we know
[54:27] this there may have been more recorded
[54:30] right
[54:30] i'm sorry there may have been more
[54:32] spoken uh when jonah literally preached
[54:34] this
[54:35] but as far as this scripture it looks
[54:37] like thus saith the lord i'm destroying
[54:39] it in 40
[54:40] 40 days but keep reading your bible
[54:44] what happens now all the people could
[54:48] have said thus saith the lord we're
[54:49] going to die in 40 days
[54:50] thus saith the lord and if they just
[54:52] said what that said
[54:53] they would have thought there was no
[54:54] conditions for it
[54:59] and so see church with every vision of
[55:01] brother branham we've got to look at it
[55:03] and say is this conditional
[55:04] or is this unconditional but see believe
[55:07] the sign don't do that
[55:08] they look at one and oh if it's failed
[55:10] or if apparently brother
[55:11] didn't obey it well then he's not a
[55:13] prophet well jonah didn't obey this
[55:15] first one
[55:16] and he was still a prophet right
[55:21] now look at verse five and so the people
[55:23] of nineveh believed god and proclaimed a
[55:25] fast and put on sackcloth from the
[55:28] greatest of them even to the least them
[55:29] and we know in chapter four
[55:32] uh jonas mad because god didn't destroy
[55:34] it
[55:36] and god has to plead with jonah you need
[55:38] to have mercy
[55:39] in church that's our that's our story
[55:41] right we don't want to be prideful
[55:43] message believers
[55:44] we want to be message believers that
[55:45] have mercy on people and compassion
[55:48] i feel for the catholics don't you i
[55:51] feel i've been to there you know last
[55:52] year i went to a funeral it's awful
[55:54] i feel for those people uh it hurts my
[55:57] heart to know that people are in those
[55:59] type of systems it makes me sad it it
[56:02] makes me pray for them
[56:04] what was i saying yesterday i saw
[56:06] something i just almost broke down and
[56:07] cried i was so sorry
[56:08] that these people were in such a
[56:09] condition at a church
[56:12] oh yeah it was that one
[56:16] i almost started crying i was watching
[56:17] where uh they marry people at branham
[56:20] tabernacle they have a living minister
[56:22] and then they say okay now after they
[56:24] get the you know the husband
[56:25] or i'm sorry the wife up there they step
[56:27] the minister steps off and say now we're
[56:29] gonna let our
[56:30] pastor william branham marry them
[56:33] and church i about started crying i was
[56:35] there in my car i just i just was
[56:36] leaving aldi and i was gonna plug it in
[56:37] and listen to it i
[56:38] i thought my can you imagine and the
[56:41] brother had a good point that was
[56:42] exposing this can you imagine if we went
[56:44] to a methodist church today
[56:47] and a preacher got up there and said
[56:48] okay we're gonna have a wedding and okay
[56:50] now we're gonna
[56:50] our pastor john wesley preached and he
[56:52] sat down
[56:54] and and pretend they're pretending and
[56:56] thinking that john wesley is actually
[56:58] there preaching
[57:00] and i've seen brother branham's sons do
[57:02] that i've seen both of his sons do that
[57:04] on tape
[57:05] they'll say okay now i'm gonna step
[57:06] aside i'm gonna let our pastor our daddy
[57:08] preach the gospel
[57:09] my church my heart hurt i thought how
[57:11] can someone that loves jesus be under
[57:13] that delusion
[57:15] see there's something underneath that
[57:16] right it's some type of pride or
[57:18] there's something hiding under there
[57:20] that's really awful now the brother said
[57:22] it might be necromancy which is
[57:24] playing with spirits the dead
[57:26] interceding with the dead it may be
[57:29] right but this one thing i know paul
[57:31] never said
[57:32] uh paul never said uh you know
[57:35] anything like that paul told timothy he
[57:37] said preach the word praise god
[57:40] amen he didn't say imagine a dead man
[57:42] there he said
[57:43] you preach the word amen
[57:47] church that's the delusion people are
[57:48] under in this day
[57:50] around our message and so we need to
[57:52] have compassion how many want to have
[57:53] compassion
[57:54] on them god be merciful bring them out
[57:56] of this how can they picture that
[58:00] and there's quotes my man said i won't
[58:02] always be your pastor that was in
[58:04] future home 64. the man said i won't
[58:06] always be your pastor
[58:08] all right so let me move on
[58:11] we ought to be thankful for what god has
[58:13] given us praise god
[58:15] we have a how many are thankful for the
[58:17] word of god being rightly divided to us
[58:19] amen i'm so thankful for that we have to
[58:22] pretend things or imagine things and we
[58:24] can church everything we can do
[58:26] by god's grace we can point right to the
[58:28] bible and say that's what they did in
[58:30] the bible
[58:33] now brother rod gave some additional
[58:34] points after he wouldn't condemn
[58:37] bruce jenner for cross-dressing i don't
[58:39] condemn his soul but i condemn that
[58:41] action as a sin
[58:42] it's an abomination and i said that
[58:44] clearly i don't condemn his soul
[58:46] but it's a sin it's an abomination and
[58:50] though
[58:50] so he said uh rod never backed up
[58:52] brother branham
[58:54] like he did moses striking the rock and
[58:56] this is one of those times
[58:57] where i didn't have anything planned and
[58:59] the holy spirit gave me what to say
[59:03] he said brother ram never had see if he
[59:05] was a real prophet god would have backed
[59:07] him up anyway well now there's another
[59:08] thought on that
[59:09] god didn't always back up what the
[59:11] prophets did
[59:13] god didn't bring to pass everything that
[59:15] every prophet ever said right
[59:19] not every single there was times he did
[59:21] it but not
[59:22] every single time
[59:26] and so as i was sitting there the holy
[59:28] spirit brought this quote to me
[59:29] brother branham said i was in balaam's
[59:31] shoes i've never heard that quote before
[59:35] let me see if i can find it real quick
[59:37] here oh
[59:39] there's my little guy there so let me
[59:42] just type in to prove it to you here
[59:46] in balaam's shoes i didn't have a chance
[59:48] to look this up
[59:51] okay so let's look at this here this is
[59:52] from 1947.
[59:56] let's let me read this quote to you here
[59:58] oh it's quite a quote how it must have
[1:00:00] been
[1:00:00] so good to me to let me get by with such
[1:00:03] as that
[1:00:04] when even i wouldn't make any believe it
[1:00:06] or not
[1:00:07] just bring them on you see because i
[1:00:09] knew the strength and the power of god
[1:00:10] let me pause right there so brother i'm
[1:00:12] saying it early in his
[1:00:14] ministry he got so zealous
[1:00:18] and he was so impressed by the miracles
[1:00:20] he said
[1:00:21] bring me the hardest cases first to try
[1:00:23] to raise people's faith
[1:00:26] and brother brahm said that was wrong he
[1:00:28] should not have done that
[1:00:30] so that's what he's saying here now that
[1:00:32] just the very fact
[1:00:33] he could do that proves he's a prophet
[1:00:35] of god right
[1:00:37] and how did god let me get but i said
[1:00:39] god let me get by with that i do not
[1:00:41] know
[1:00:42] because jesus christ there was many
[1:00:43] mighty works he could not do is that
[1:00:45] scripture
[1:00:46] because of their unbelief and look what
[1:00:47] he was look at the power was in him
[1:00:50] and then merely with the gift of healing
[1:00:52] challenged anything
[1:00:54] belief or unbelief come on up and he let
[1:00:56] me look at this for six
[1:00:57] months get by with that so six months
[1:01:01] he he disobeyed what the angel lord told
[1:01:03] him to do
[1:01:05] right that began to break my heart when
[1:01:08] i seen that
[1:01:09] what i had done and i tried to hold up
[1:01:11] before you people and preach i couldn't
[1:01:13] do it it just melted me right on down
[1:01:15] and i come to the pulp and i seen then
[1:01:17] that i was preaching and telling
[1:01:18] how bad balaam was and i was standing in
[1:01:22] balaam's
[1:01:23] shoes i was doing the things the angel
[1:01:28] lord
[1:01:28] met me up there and said don't do it
[1:01:36] now church that's a humble man right
[1:01:38] there because balaam was lost and went
[1:01:40] to hell
[1:01:41] but brother adam will see church brother
[1:01:43] i'm saying even a prophet
[1:01:45] sometimes i can he can disobey the word
[1:01:47] of the lord
[1:01:49] and he could he could be acting like a
[1:01:51] disobedient prophet but yet he's still a
[1:01:53] true prophet
[1:01:55] what did balaam do god said don't go up
[1:01:58] to barrack
[1:01:59] so balaam went against it and he said
[1:02:01] can i go again
[1:02:02] he said can i go oh fine go ahead and go
[1:02:06] right so balaam disobeyed the first word
[1:02:08] the angel of the lord gave brother man
[1:02:10] the first word
[1:02:11] don't do that don't bring the hardest
[1:02:12] cases first brother brandon did it
[1:02:14] anyway
[1:02:16] and yet god still blessed him how many
[1:02:20] remember when baal went up to barrack
[1:02:22] did god meet with him in the tent or not
[1:02:24] yes or no do you say it out loud
[1:02:25] did god meet with balaam in the tent
[1:02:28] yeah
[1:02:29] he was disobedient he disobeyed the
[1:02:31] first word he went to barack and when he
[1:02:33] got to barrack he said bert
[1:02:34] build seven altars uh kill seven
[1:02:37] bullocks seven birth sacrifices
[1:02:39] and i'll go talk to god tonight did god
[1:02:41] talk to him yeah
[1:02:42] yeah he did
[1:02:46] so this idea that uh brother branham oh
[1:02:49] god never backed up brother branham even
[1:02:51] when he was disobedient like moses when
[1:02:53] moses smote the rock
[1:02:54] yes god did not in everything
[1:02:58] but in some things
[1:03:02] now it's probably a quote you haven't
[1:03:03] heard too many times preaching the
[1:03:04] message right
[1:03:07] but it's in the it's in the message
[1:03:09] right it's amongst his
[1:03:10] so to me that's humility that's a man
[1:03:12] that i can appreciate
[1:03:13] because sometimes like paul sometimes
[1:03:15] well johnny i do things that i hate and
[1:03:17] i wish i would not have done it
[1:03:20] sometimes i can say but amen oh wretched
[1:03:22] man that i am
[1:03:24] but thanks be to god who gives me the
[1:03:26] victory through jesus christ my lord
[1:03:28] amen that's a man that i can respect
[1:03:31] right there
[1:03:32] an honest man and yet god did those
[1:03:34] great miracles
[1:03:36] all right let me pull back up the
[1:03:37] keynote here sorry
[1:03:41] i didn't plan to show that but i just
[1:03:42] thought it might help you okay there we
[1:03:44] go
[1:03:47] so see that's wrong god did back him up
[1:03:49] in some cases
[1:03:54] and then the holy spirit brought that to
[1:03:55] my remember it says john 14
[1:03:57] 26 said i not plan to say it but i loved
[1:04:00] it i was all nervous for a little while
[1:04:01] but then
[1:04:02] all the nervous went away i just waited
[1:04:03] for the holy spirit church that's what
[1:04:05] that's all i enjoy doing don't you two
[1:04:07] just wait on the presence of the lord
[1:04:10] amen
[1:04:12] just wait on him he'll show up praise
[1:04:13] god hallelujah
[1:04:17] now let's go to the next okay so the
[1:04:19] second question now my second question
[1:04:21] was about the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:23] i said since you believe someone gets
[1:04:25] the holy ghost at the moment of
[1:04:26] salvation
[1:04:29] do you negate that means to do away with
[1:04:32] so do you
[1:04:33] do do you do away with the examples from
[1:04:35] the acts
[1:04:36] or the book of acts of receiving the
[1:04:37] holy ghost after you believe
[1:04:40] so i said what do you do with all those
[1:04:41] examples and i even used jesus apostles
[1:04:45] they believed in jesus they found him
[1:04:47] for three and a half years but they
[1:04:48] weren't born again to the day of
[1:04:49] pentecost
[1:04:51] right so that was one example i used
[1:04:54] now let me pull up i got to open up
[1:04:56] something real quick i forgot i wanted
[1:04:57] to share this
[1:04:59] okay so next so here were his reasonings
[1:05:03] and i think they're wrong of course
[1:05:09] there we go
[1:05:12] so our brother believes
[1:05:16] that there's only two kinds of believers
[1:05:18] saved and lost
[1:05:19] well brother branham said there's three
[1:05:20] kinds when he preached it and then the
[1:05:22] church's book he says there's four kinds
[1:05:25] right so there i believe there's four
[1:05:27] because it fits the four kinds of
[1:05:29] grounds
[1:05:29] there's four kinds of conditions uh holy
[1:05:32] righteous unholy unrighteous you know
[1:05:35] there's and revelation 22
[1:05:37] 4 is the earthly number and brother ram
[1:05:39] grew in revelation
[1:05:41] so he said there's only two kinds
[1:05:44] he says the disciples now this is
[1:05:46] interesting he said disciples weren't
[1:05:47] converted
[1:05:49] until acts 2 4 and i agreed with that
[1:05:51] because jesus said that
[1:05:52] he told peter he said wait he said when
[1:05:54] you're converted strengthen your
[1:05:55] brethren
[1:05:56] in other words go up to pentecost wait
[1:05:58] there get all emptied out until heaven
[1:06:01] comes down to fill you up praise god
[1:06:03] amen that's what he said wait till
[1:06:05] you're converted praise god
[1:06:08] i believe with that but he's he's
[1:06:10] confused
[1:06:12] now go to romans 8 9. he says romans 8 9
[1:06:15] says you cannot be a christian without
[1:06:18] the spirit now i
[1:06:19] i agree with that but not his
[1:06:21] interpretation of it romans 8 9.
[1:06:28] romans 8 9. now remember i told you last
[1:06:30] week this is the holy ghost chapter
[1:06:32] it starts off with the holy ghost ends
[1:06:33] with the love of god who can separate me
[1:06:35] from the holy ghost the love of god
[1:06:38] hallelujah height nor death nor anything
[1:06:41] can separate me
[1:06:42] from the love of god which is in christ
[1:06:44] jesus our lord
[1:06:46] verse 9 but ye are not in the flesh but
[1:06:50] in the spirit
[1:06:51] if so be that the spirit of god dwell in
[1:06:53] you now if any man have not the spirit
[1:06:55] of christ
[1:06:56] he's none of his now there's a couple
[1:06:58] way you can ways you can apply this
[1:07:02] when you have justification you have the
[1:07:04] holy spirit in your mind
[1:07:07] but you don't have it in your soul right
[1:07:11] and is it is a justified person truly
[1:07:14] god's child
[1:07:15] yes yes how about sanctification
[1:07:19] if you've got the holy spirit in your
[1:07:20] mind and you're in the process of being
[1:07:22] sanctified
[1:07:22] are you god's child yes you are
[1:07:27] but he you know he's saying this
[1:07:29] scripture means as soon as you're
[1:07:31] justified
[1:07:31] you're filled with the holy spirit we
[1:07:33] know that's not the case
[1:07:35] it's not the case because if you have
[1:07:38] the first two works of grace you still
[1:07:40] have the holy spirit
[1:07:42] in your mind
[1:07:45] now the mystery part of that because the
[1:07:47] holy ghost is a mystery right
[1:07:48] the mystery part of that you can be like
[1:07:50] judas you can be justified and
[1:07:52] sanctified
[1:07:53] but then deny it and trample foot the
[1:07:55] son of god
[1:07:56] and your name gets blotted off the book
[1:07:58] of life
[1:07:59] that's the great mystery of it right by
[1:08:02] manchester you can
[1:08:02] you can climb up that pyramid and then
[1:08:05] fall off
[1:08:08] the bible says the holy spirit you were
[1:08:10] sanctified with you counted a
[1:08:11] unholy thing the bible says that let's
[1:08:13] read it uh
[1:08:14] hebrews 10 just to prove it to you the
[1:08:17] bible says you can be sanctified by the
[1:08:19] holy spirit
[1:08:20] but then trample under it in other words
[1:08:22] you can make it all the way to
[1:08:24] jordan but if you don't cross over
[1:08:26] you're not in the promised land amen
[1:08:30] hebrews 10.
[1:08:39] verse 29 hebrews 10 29 clearly says it's
[1:08:42] a clear bible teaching
[1:08:48] of how much sore punishment suppose ye
[1:08:50] shall he be thought worthy you had
[1:08:52] trodden underfoot the son of god
[1:08:53] and hath counted the blood of the
[1:08:55] covenant wherewith he was sanctified
[1:08:58] here's a man that was sanctified by the
[1:09:00] holy spirit i mean separated right
[1:09:02] the word actually means separated and
[1:09:04] cleaned
[1:09:06] so a man can be cleaned right but then
[1:09:08] he can go back and get dirty
[1:09:12] but see when you're born again it seals
[1:09:14] that dirt out praise god
[1:09:16] of your soul amen
[1:09:20] and have done despite the spirit of
[1:09:22] grace so god's grace leads you into
[1:09:24] justification
[1:09:25] sanctification but if you don't follow
[1:09:27] on into the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:29] and you trample it down
[1:09:30] then the bible said there's punishment
[1:09:32] for that and jesus said if you don't
[1:09:35] overcome
[1:09:36] and return your first love i'll blot out
[1:09:38] your name off the book of life
[1:09:42] it's a great mystery but i'll say this
[1:09:43] i'm glad to know the mystery
[1:09:46] amen i'm glad to know the mystery and
[1:09:49] church and in many cases
[1:09:51] i don't know you and i don't know many
[1:09:54] times if people are saved or not
[1:09:58] remember the member of the preacher
[1:10:00] brother ramsey brother man talked about
[1:10:02] he got to a spot where he wouldn't serve
[1:10:04] god anymore and he was working in a car
[1:10:06] shop and he told the black brother he
[1:10:07] said go buy me some alcohol and he said
[1:10:09] god forbid i'd buy a servant alcohol
[1:10:12] but the ramp said he died god took him
[1:10:13] off the scene because he died he stopped
[1:10:14] preaching all these things but brother
[1:10:16] man said he was saved
[1:10:18] now i don't understand that the
[1:10:20] brotherhood said he was saved
[1:10:22] somehow brother bam saw it or something
[1:10:24] he preached and all these things
[1:10:25] but then he backslid and went away
[1:10:29] and i and brother man said he must have
[1:10:30] gotten saved somehow at the end now that
[1:10:32] would line up with first corinthians six
[1:10:34] right
[1:10:34] or yeah first corinthians six if a
[1:10:36] brother's backslidden
[1:10:38] uh get the leaven out of the church that
[1:10:40] his soul uh
[1:10:41] deliver him to satan that his soul might
[1:10:42] be saved
[1:10:46] it's a great topic it's a great subject
[1:10:48] but it's the word of god amen
[1:10:51] and then the brother said he told me he
[1:10:52] said the works of grace terminology is
[1:10:54] not in the bible well i disagree with
[1:10:56] that it's right in the bible
[1:10:59] the holy spirit he said the holy spirit
[1:11:01] is received just by believing i disagree
[1:11:03] with that
[1:11:05] as far as in the soul now here's what's
[1:11:07] striking and people have told me this
[1:11:09] before
[1:11:09] in fact the first year i was a teacher
[1:11:11] at copley i was working the summer
[1:11:13] painting
[1:11:14] i paint the classrooms and i worked with
[1:11:16] a science teacher from the middle school
[1:11:18] who since retired
[1:11:20] and we got into that debate it was it
[1:11:22] was fun it was one of the best debates i
[1:11:23] ever had paint in and just
[1:11:24] listen to we could listen to jesus music
[1:11:26] you know we're debating while we're
[1:11:28] painting
[1:11:30] and i said well yeah i said did you ever
[1:11:32] read the book of acts
[1:11:33] uh they believed and then they got the
[1:11:35] holy ghost and he said he said you can't
[1:11:37] use stories for doctrine
[1:11:40] i said well then why was it written then
[1:11:45] wasn't it a true story
[1:11:48] didn't the bible say they believed in
[1:11:49] samaria but then they hadn't received
[1:11:51] the holy ghost so he said
[1:11:52] call peter and john that's the example i
[1:11:54] used i said call those brothers who got
[1:11:56] the holy ghost
[1:11:57] lay hands on them and they'll get the
[1:11:58] holy ghost praise god
[1:12:00] is that a true story is that a fairy
[1:12:02] tale church that's a true story
[1:12:04] but he's saying you can't use the book
[1:12:06] of acts and then and then they say
[1:12:08] it's a history book you can't use
[1:12:10] history for doctrine
[1:12:12] you can't use history to prove current
[1:12:15] teaching
[1:12:15] history validates current teaching
[1:12:17] praise god
[1:12:20] and so the brother says the same things
[1:12:23] oh they're just stories
[1:12:25] and they can't be used for doctrine i'll
[1:12:28] tell that but
[1:12:28] i'll say it like this church every bible
[1:12:30] story can be used for doctrine
[1:12:32] the bible says that remember the holy
[1:12:33] scriptures paul told timothy the
[1:12:35] scriptures are profitable for doctrine
[1:12:37] right for instruction for training in
[1:12:39] righteousness that the man may be
[1:12:41] perfect
[1:12:42] thoroughly furnished unto every good
[1:12:44] work
[1:12:46] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:12:50] and then he said as soon as you believe
[1:12:51] the spirit flows
[1:12:53] out of you well that's not true you got
[1:12:56] to wait to your seal with the holy ghost
[1:12:57] then the spirit
[1:12:58] then the water flows out of you all
[1:13:01] right
[1:13:02] so let me look at a few of these so
[1:13:04] here's my reply i probably already said
[1:13:06] a lot of my reply but let me just go
[1:13:07] through it here
[1:13:08] quickly what was this my second question
[1:13:10] or was this
[1:13:12] oh yeah uh his second question
[1:13:16] um i said it's a mystery
[1:13:24] uh yeah i don't know i'm not sure if i
[1:13:26] got it
[1:13:27] i'm not sure if i have my notes on that
[1:13:28] anyways i'll just go off it in mark 16
[1:13:31] i'm going to read this in mark 16 the
[1:13:32] bible said god
[1:13:33] works with us mark 16.
[1:13:39] god needs someone to say or he needs
[1:13:40] someone to help him right because
[1:13:42] he can't force people so he uses man to
[1:13:44] save man
[1:13:46] you don't have to do it but he does it
[1:13:48] to give us something to do praise god
[1:13:50] he gives us a job to do he gives us
[1:13:52] talents praise god
[1:13:55] mark 16 19 and then after that the lord
[1:13:58] had spoken unto them
[1:13:59] he was received up into heaven and sat
[1:14:01] on the right hand of god
[1:14:02] and they went forth and preached
[1:14:04] everywhere the lord working with them
[1:14:07] and confirming the word with signs
[1:14:10] following
[1:14:11] so the holy god works with you how many
[1:14:13] glad god works with you
[1:14:15] amen you can talk for god praise god you
[1:14:18] can work for god
[1:14:19] you can do something for god amen
[1:14:21] because god is working
[1:14:23] with you all right
[1:14:27] uh and then there's that scripture where
[1:14:28] paul said uh
[1:14:31] the work i do the works of god uh
[1:14:34] mo i labor more abundantly but not me
[1:14:37] but the grace with me let me look at the
[1:14:39] grace of god with me
[1:14:42] labor okay yeah it's first corinthians
[1:14:45] 15
[1:14:46] 10 but by the grace of god i am what i
[1:14:48] am
[1:14:49] and his grace which was bestowed upon me
[1:14:52] was not
[1:14:52] in vain but i labored more abundantly he
[1:14:56] worked more abundantly than they all
[1:14:59] than peter and james and john paul
[1:15:01] labored more than all them
[1:15:03] yet not i but the grace of god which was
[1:15:05] with me praise god
[1:15:07] amen so what was laboring with him grace
[1:15:10] was laboring that's why brotherhood said
[1:15:12] five is labor and grace amen
[1:15:14] grace labors when you have grace and
[1:15:17] receive god's favor it makes you want to
[1:15:19] labor
[1:15:20] it makes you want to work to show your
[1:15:22] appreciation to god
[1:15:25] hallelujah
[1:15:28] hebrews 4 verse 9 this
[1:15:31] whole chapter is about entering into the
[1:15:33] baptism of the holy ghost hebrews
[1:15:35] chapters 2 and 3 talks about israel
[1:15:37] trying to get to the promised land
[1:15:38] which finishes it and shows that the
[1:15:40] holy ghost is the promised land for the
[1:15:42] believer today
[1:15:43] verse nine there remained therefore a
[1:15:45] rest to the people of god
[1:15:47] this is what i tell those sabbatarians
[1:15:49] all the time
[1:15:51] they already had the sabbath day but the
[1:15:53] bible said they need a rest
[1:15:57] no i mean they'll argue well they'll
[1:15:59] email till they're blue in the face
[1:16:00] because i've eaten with them till
[1:16:01] i'm about blue in the face say we you
[1:16:04] need to rest
[1:16:05] i said i said i've got i've got a
[1:16:07] two-fold rest on sunday
[1:16:09] right uh i rest for my labors right i
[1:16:11] don't work my
[1:16:12] regular job my teaching job i rest that
[1:16:15] way
[1:16:15] and plus i don't work at my house i
[1:16:17] don't move the grass i don't
[1:16:19] uh so i'm so i'm resting my body but
[1:16:21] actually i'm preaching so i'm really not
[1:16:22] resting my body but you guys get to rest
[1:16:24] your body
[1:16:25] now unless you're sweating like me and
[1:16:27] you know you're saying amen so loud
[1:16:28] you're sweating like me
[1:16:29] but you don't have to but
[1:16:33] i guess that's true when i'm not
[1:16:34] preaching i guess that's true praise god
[1:16:36] and i get to sit listen to somebody else
[1:16:37] preach
[1:16:39] but in some sundays i don't work my body
[1:16:42] and i don't work the job
[1:16:44] and so i fulfill i have a sabbath day
[1:16:47] sunday's my sabbath day right
[1:16:51] but like paul said paul said the priests
[1:16:54] transgressed the sabbath because they
[1:16:55] worked on the sabbath they had to offer
[1:16:58] sacrifices and do the
[1:16:59] altar of incense and they work but jesus
[1:17:02] said it's okay
[1:17:03] because they're certain they're serving
[1:17:05] god's purpose
[1:17:07] and so even though i work i'm still
[1:17:09] serving god's purpose i'm not breaking
[1:17:11] the word amen
[1:17:12] oh hallelujah praise god hope that makes
[1:17:15] sense
[1:17:16] but see how can they say that
[1:17:19] that the saturdays the rest when the
[1:17:21] bible said there still was a
[1:17:23] rest remaining for he that has entered
[1:17:26] into his rest verse 10
[1:17:27] has also ceased from his own works as
[1:17:30] god did from his
[1:17:31] let us picnic
[1:17:34] is that the right word lydia does that
[1:17:37] say picnic
[1:17:38] let us vacation therefore to enter into
[1:17:41] that rest
[1:17:43] the word church labor huh
[1:17:46] we're supposed to labor to enter into
[1:17:48] the baptism of the holy ghost i remember
[1:17:49] when i preached edin
[1:17:51] uh which sister was that sister walker
[1:17:54] emailed me afterwards and said i needed
[1:17:55] to hear that
[1:17:56] because we we have to we have to make
[1:17:58] our flesh submit to the holy spirit
[1:18:00] it's hard it's a labor sometimes right
[1:18:03] like you've got to really
[1:18:04] work at it right
[1:18:07] there's certain things i've got to i've
[1:18:08] got to work at it not to give into that
[1:18:10] sin you've got to work at it
[1:18:13] right because you've got to bring this
[1:18:15] body into subjection
[1:18:17] so the bible says let us labor not
[1:18:20] vacation
[1:18:23] to enter into that rest just like a
[1:18:26] woman giving forth a baby labor
[1:18:29] labor to bring the rest right lest any
[1:18:31] man fall after the same example of
[1:18:33] unbelief
[1:18:34] so see those that don't believe don't
[1:18:36] labor but if you believe you labor
[1:18:38] praise god in other words you work
[1:18:40] with grace you let grace work in your
[1:18:44] life
[1:18:48] i believe it with all my heart i believe
[1:18:50] this message with all my heart
[1:18:52] that's beautiful praise god for the word
[1:18:55] of god so what is the rest
[1:18:56] the word of god the word of god is quick
[1:18:59] powerful sharper than any two-edged
[1:19:01] sword piercing even the dividing asunder
[1:19:04] of the soul
[1:19:05] and the spirit and of the joints and of
[1:19:07] the marrow i love that see
[1:19:08] the word of god helps your soul helps
[1:19:10] your mind helps your body praise god
[1:19:13] amen god's word heals your body it
[1:19:16] transforms your mind
[1:19:17] and it fills your soul amen
[1:19:21] this is beautiful man it's just it's
[1:19:23] perfect for the three parts of a human
[1:19:25] soul body spirit and and rod doesn't
[1:19:28] believe in that either brother johnny
[1:19:30] told me he said i don't believe in that
[1:19:31] soul body spirit
[1:19:32] i thought boy that's why you can't get
[1:19:33] the revelation of it you can't get the
[1:19:36] revelation of it
[1:19:39] you'll miss it that's why they can't see
[1:19:41] the baptist holy ghost because they
[1:19:42] can't see
[1:19:42] that man has three parts and then they
[1:19:45] can't see god's one person
[1:19:46] father son holy ghost yet one person we
[1:19:49] are body soul spirit
[1:19:50] yet one person same thing right
[1:19:55] that's one of the questions coming up so
[1:19:56] maybe we'll get to that this morning
[1:19:57] running out of time here
[1:19:59] ah what a beautiful scripture and as a
[1:20:02] discerner
[1:20:02] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:20:06] so brother man had that gift so he
[1:20:08] laying in here is the messiah
[1:20:10] sign right the discernment of spirit
[1:20:12] brother man could judge people's
[1:20:13] thoughts
[1:20:15] because that's what discerning is
[1:20:16] judging it's judging the thoughts and
[1:20:19] intents of their heart
[1:20:21] i like verse 13 neither is there any
[1:20:23] creature that is not manifest in his
[1:20:24] sight
[1:20:25] but all things are naked and open unto
[1:20:27] the eyes of him
[1:20:29] with whom we have to do so god sees he's
[1:20:31] the word
[1:20:32] he sees right through everything any
[1:20:34] little charade people can put on a
[1:20:36] little act
[1:20:37] any little pretending on any little
[1:20:38] guile god sees through all that
[1:20:40] and church the word will see through it
[1:20:42] too when you give some the word test
[1:20:44] we'll look at that tonight that brother
[1:20:46] said that's how you know the bride
[1:20:48] give the people the word test
[1:20:51] he said after the word i'm kind of
[1:20:52] getting to my sermon tonight so
[1:20:54] sometimes i can't just i can't avoid
[1:20:56] that
[1:20:56] it all kind of flows together man said
[1:21:00] he said the miracles
[1:21:01] come after the word amen but the word
[1:21:05] comes first in other words
[1:21:06] the true interpretation of god's word
[1:21:08] comes first
[1:21:09] and then god sends the miracle amen
[1:21:13] you know the example program gives
[1:21:15] elijah with the shulamite woman
[1:21:17] who's gonna die and he said give me he
[1:21:20] said go make me the cake first
[1:21:24] amen go believe go act on the word first
[1:21:27] act on the true word first
[1:21:29] get your doctrine right and then the
[1:21:31] miracles will come later praise god
[1:21:34] i'm going to preach that tonight again
[1:21:35] so you got to bear with me again tonight
[1:21:37] i'll reason quote but that's how you
[1:21:40] know with the showdown
[1:21:42] when the showdown comes between jesus
[1:21:43] and denomination but man said that's how
[1:21:45] you know he said give him the word test
[1:21:47] if you want to listen that's the
[1:21:48] spoken words original seed i just
[1:21:50] listened to the last uh
[1:21:51] hour last night beautiful ah we'll go
[1:21:55] over tonight a little bit by god's grace
[1:21:57] that's where the the lord said pick up
[1:21:59] your pen and write so see church it's
[1:22:01] always the word first that's why with
[1:22:02] rod
[1:22:03] i he and he even says this on the debate
[1:22:05] brother man he has miracles he said i
[1:22:07] still see miracles in my life
[1:22:09] so he had miracles while he was a
[1:22:10] oneness he was raised in the oneness
[1:22:12] church he had merit he saw miracles
[1:22:13] and then he came to message for 40 years
[1:22:15] he said he saw miracles there and now
[1:22:16] he's out of the message he sees miracles
[1:22:18] there so it's not the miracles first
[1:22:20] it's the word first
[1:22:23] amen let's put god's word first let's
[1:22:26] put the revelation first praise god and
[1:22:28] then the miracles will come
[1:22:30] but see if if they cry out long enough
[1:22:32] god's going to send rain
[1:22:34] no matter what sea you are because the
[1:22:37] rain falls on the just
[1:22:38] and the unjust
[1:22:42] the rain just quickens what seed is
[1:22:43] inside
[1:22:45] i hope you're enjoying this today church
[1:22:46] i'll share them i love it
[1:22:48] oh my iron sharpens iron praise god
[1:22:52] amen and we just get sharper and sharper
[1:22:55] who can see right down what is the truth
[1:22:57] on that
[1:22:57] that's the word praise god
[1:23:00] so what labored in paul's life grace
[1:23:03] grace does work oh and i brought out too
[1:23:07] i brought out that mark 14 where jesus
[1:23:09] said
[1:23:09] the kingdom of heaven is like a wheat
[1:23:11] plant and it grows up uh
[1:23:13] uh the something and then the stalk and
[1:23:15] then the corn
[1:23:16] and the kingdom of god is within you so
[1:23:18] the kingdom of god is the baptism of the
[1:23:20] holy ghost it grows in three stages in
[1:23:22] your life
[1:23:22] but i'm saying with the statue of men
[1:23:24] you grow into the next phase
[1:23:27] you grow up into it praise god
[1:23:33] thank you lord now let me let's read
[1:23:36] that one
[1:23:36] foolish virgin are blessed even they're
[1:23:39] justified but they're still blessed
[1:23:41] they're still god's children they're not
[1:23:43] as bright but they're still god's
[1:23:44] children
[1:23:45] go to matthew 25 34
[1:23:51] was the thief on the cross still god's
[1:23:54] child yes
[1:23:55] yes did he live the life peter lived and
[1:23:58] john
[1:23:58] no he only was a believer for the last
[1:24:01] few hours or minutes of his life but he
[1:24:03] was still saved
[1:24:04] he didn't live close to the life they
[1:24:06] lived but he's still a child of god
[1:24:10] matthew 25.
[1:24:16] 34 25 34
[1:24:21] then shall the king say unto them on the
[1:24:23] right hand come ye blessed of my father
[1:24:26] inherit the kingdom prepared for you
[1:24:28] from the foundation of the world so they
[1:24:30] have
[1:24:30] a certain portion in the new jerusalem
[1:24:32] not in the city
[1:24:34] but it must be outside this city they
[1:24:36] have some portion in
[1:24:37] jesus's kingdom his rulership his domain
[1:24:40] right
[1:24:42] and when was it prepared before the
[1:24:44] foundation of the world
[1:24:45] and this is the group that didn't even
[1:24:47] know they were doing good to jesus
[1:24:48] brothers
[1:24:50] they're shocked they're surprised on the
[1:24:51] day of judgment when did we ever visit
[1:24:53] you
[1:24:53] when did we clothe you when did we feed
[1:24:55] you he said when you did it to the least
[1:24:57] of those message believers you did it
[1:24:59] unto me praise god
[1:25:01] that's right
[1:25:06] so we can see that plainly by the grace
[1:25:07] of god amen
[1:25:09] now go to acts uh acts eight
[1:25:24] i read a quote yesterday where bam said
[1:25:26] uh imperfect faith he said now brother
[1:25:28] man
[1:25:28] he said i'm just hitting the highlights
[1:25:29] he said you dig down deeper in these
[1:25:31] things and bring out more of it
[1:25:33] that's what we're supposed to do we're
[1:25:35] not supposed to stop at revelation 10 7
[1:25:37] malachi 4 5 and 6.
[1:25:38] we're that's great that's where you
[1:25:39] start but then you dig down and find the
[1:25:41] rest of it praise god
[1:25:42] there's more of it that we can bring out
[1:25:44] and it teaches the same revelation
[1:25:46] just more of it
[1:25:49] acts 8
[1:25:53] verse 12 but when they had believed
[1:25:56] philip preaching the things concerning
[1:25:57] the kingdom of god
[1:25:58] and the name of jesus christ they were
[1:26:00] baptized both
[1:26:02] men and women then simon himself
[1:26:04] believed also when he was baptized he
[1:26:06] continued with philip
[1:26:07] and wondered but holding the miracles
[1:26:09] and the signs which
[1:26:10] they had done go to verse 16 for as yet
[1:26:13] he was fallen upon none of them only
[1:26:15] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:26:16] lord jesus
[1:26:17] then laid their hands on them and they
[1:26:19] received the holy ghost
[1:26:21] now you know simon i said this on
[1:26:23] wednesday simon wanted to give the holy
[1:26:24] ghost to people
[1:26:25] but look at verse 12. he wants to buy
[1:26:27] i'm sorry verse 20. he wants to buy it
[1:26:29] with money
[1:26:30] but peter said to him thy money perish
[1:26:32] with thee now he just got baptized
[1:26:35] and peter's like your money's gonna
[1:26:36] perish with you he just got saved
[1:26:39] wouldn't you be happy
[1:26:40] but peter recognizes his heart isn't
[1:26:42] cleaned out
[1:26:44] right he's not sanctified at all
[1:26:48] he just got baptized because that was
[1:26:51] thought that the gift of god may be
[1:26:52] purchased with money
[1:26:54] so your thoughts can cause you to be per
[1:26:56] can cause you to perish
[1:26:58] see people's thoughts about god and the
[1:27:00] holy ghost look at that
[1:27:02] the baptism holy ghost can cause them to
[1:27:04] perish now of course this is coveting as
[1:27:06] well right
[1:27:07] he's covered something that wasn't given
[1:27:08] to him and he thinks he can buy a
[1:27:10] spiritual gift with money
[1:27:14] so how far did he get on the statute
[1:27:16] perfect man not very far
[1:27:18] he might have got the faith he might
[1:27:20] have got the virtue if he hung around
[1:27:21] there for a little while you know
[1:27:22] i'm one of them believers praise god i
[1:27:25] wanna
[1:27:26] but when it come down he surely didn't
[1:27:28] get the knowledge
[1:27:29] because he didn't have knowledge to know
[1:27:30] that you know god has to give you that
[1:27:33] ability to pray for people to get the
[1:27:34] holy ghost
[1:27:35] that has to be a gift of god
[1:27:39] verse 21 thou s neither part nor lot in
[1:27:42] this matter
[1:27:43] for thy heart is not right in the sight
[1:27:45] of god repent now what church
[1:27:46] this is the same this is the same this
[1:27:49] is the same man that said acts 2 38
[1:27:51] repent and be baptized right
[1:27:53] are you that just struck me are you with
[1:27:54] me he just said repent and be baptized
[1:27:57] they got baptized
[1:27:58] he said can i buy the holy ghost he said
[1:28:00] repent
[1:28:02] go back to where you started you never
[1:28:04] did repent all the way
[1:28:06] isn't that striking see how many people
[1:28:10] among us brother johnny have we've seen
[1:28:11] over the years
[1:28:11] amen people get baptized and they never
[1:28:14] repented to begin with
[1:28:16] and so they'll say things that are just
[1:28:18] oh how could you say that about brother
[1:28:20] branham or how could you
[1:28:21] how do you say it about jesus
[1:28:25] and then the the thing to do is go back
[1:28:27] you never repented to begin with
[1:28:30] again we don't know how far he got until
[1:28:32] he had to go back and repent
[1:28:34] he might have got faith anybody got some
[1:28:36] virtue but then satan stole it away
[1:28:38] somehow
[1:28:39] we don't know but he says repent
[1:28:42] and he just told him acts 2 38. now
[1:28:45] that's not in the story but we know
[1:28:46] that's how that's what he's on the day
[1:28:47] of pentecost
[1:28:51] repent therefore this thy wickedness and
[1:28:52] pray god so you want to repent you got
[1:28:54] to pray
[1:28:57] if perhaps the thought of thine heart
[1:28:59] may be forgiven me
[1:29:01] for i perceive that thou art in the gall
[1:29:03] of bitterness and in the bond of
[1:29:05] iniquity he was a slave to iniquity so
[1:29:07] he knew better iniquity is when you know
[1:29:08] better right
[1:29:10] so he knew better he just got saved
[1:29:12] baptized
[1:29:14] following the believers but then when he
[1:29:15] saw people get the holy ghost
[1:29:17] he's so coveted after that it was an
[1:29:19] evil thing it was bitterness in his
[1:29:20] heart
[1:29:21] now think about that bitter towards
[1:29:23] peter and john because they have a gift
[1:29:25] i don't have doesn't that come around us
[1:29:27] sometimes in the message
[1:29:30] yeah i've had people tell me i wish i
[1:29:31] was a preacher and they were women
[1:29:34] i've had a woman tell me she wished she
[1:29:36] was a preacher because then she could
[1:29:37] preach and bawl people out
[1:29:40] in the message yes i know i had people
[1:29:43] tell me that
[1:29:45] well how do you get there you don't
[1:29:46] start there if you really if you really
[1:29:47] repent you don't start there
[1:29:50] you get iniquity got to get the evil
[1:29:53] spirit on you
[1:29:54] and that takes you in the bond takes you
[1:29:56] in bondage
[1:29:58] to iniquity you know it's wrong but you
[1:30:00] do it anyway
[1:30:01] because you worship that spirit
[1:30:09] now look i like verse 24. then answer
[1:30:11] simon said pray ye to the lord for me
[1:30:13] now
[1:30:14] that's actually i don't know if i like
[1:30:15] that scripture or not that as far as his
[1:30:17] attitude
[1:30:18] that none of these things which you have
[1:30:20] spoken come upon me oh yeah that's good
[1:30:21] scripture but
[1:30:22] the reality of it is the man needed to
[1:30:24] pray himself
[1:30:26] yeah we appreciate other people praying
[1:30:28] for us but really when it comes down to
[1:30:29] repentance we're the ones who got to
[1:30:30] repent
[1:30:32] right mom can't repent for me preacher
[1:30:34] can't repent for me
[1:30:35] you've got to repent for you
[1:30:40] now you don't you don't need to go to
[1:30:41] acts 10 but an accident cornelius was
[1:30:43] praying fasting and giving alms
[1:30:45] before he was born again i had a person
[1:30:47] know me last week and said why can't i
[1:30:48] get the holy ghost i said are you
[1:30:49] praying fast and giving alms he said no
[1:30:51] i said go read acts chapter 10. you want
[1:30:54] the holy ghost do what the bible says
[1:30:56] do what jesus says because the cornelius
[1:31:00] was praying fast and giving alms
[1:31:02] seeing angels and yet wasn't born again
[1:31:06] well they're out of us people live in
[1:31:07] laodicea they want to live like the
[1:31:09] world and try to get the blessings of
[1:31:10] god
[1:31:11] you've got to deny the world the world
[1:31:13] must be crucified unto you
[1:31:15] and you to the world praise god amen
[1:31:18] i've given up multiple meals just for
[1:31:20] this service this morning and not to
[1:31:22] brag on me but just let you know
[1:31:23] if i've got to do that just to get
[1:31:24] spiritual minded what about the rest of
[1:31:26] us praise god
[1:31:30] people think as soon as they believe the
[1:31:31] message they're born again that's a
[1:31:32] bunch of nonsense
[1:31:34] they've got to walk the road they've got
[1:31:36] to walk through the red sea they've got
[1:31:38] to walk through the wilderness they've
[1:31:39] got a crossover praise god amen
[1:31:41] with no fear about what's going to
[1:31:42] happen once you're born again
[1:31:44] see they get scared what's mom going to
[1:31:46] say what's the family going to say i
[1:31:47] don't know if i can leave the church
[1:31:48] well then go back to egypt
[1:31:50] because we're going to canaan's land
[1:31:52] amen come and go with me
[1:31:53] to my father's house praise god and go
[1:31:56] back
[1:31:59] you don't want to go then go back that's
[1:32:01] really my house
[1:32:02] we'll possess the promised land joshua
[1:32:05] said that
[1:32:06] amen we'll possess it
[1:32:11] i wonder how many times i've repeated
[1:32:12] that let's go back to that thought
[1:32:14] earlier god will repeat something jonah
[1:32:15] how many times have i preached
[1:32:17] praying fast come to church early and
[1:32:19] pray or stay stay after church and pray
[1:32:20] longer and how many times have i
[1:32:22] repeated that
[1:32:22] perhaps that's maybe the holy spirit
[1:32:24] trying to get us to obey it
[1:32:27] because it's thus saith the bible
[1:32:30] right thus saith the bible god gives the
[1:32:33] holy ghost to them that obey him
[1:32:36] that's the state of the bible
[1:32:39] i want to be a faithful bible preacher
[1:32:41] praise god
[1:32:46] let me look at the next thought here
[1:32:47] yeah and i preached this i think uh
[1:32:50] maybe
[1:32:50] naomi and beatrice might remember i
[1:32:51] preached this on a wednesday night
[1:32:53] a few wednesday nights ago it's really
[1:32:56] this is a fresh revelation to me
[1:32:58] i've never realized the evil of telling
[1:33:01] people
[1:33:02] you are born again as soon as you just
[1:33:04] believe
[1:33:05] i've never realized it but now it's
[1:33:06] starting to become one of the biggest
[1:33:08] sins i can think of i don't know if it's
[1:33:10] pride or i don't know what it is
[1:33:12] i'm just trying to replace it as far as
[1:33:14] sins can you imagine
[1:33:15] amen telling somebody they just repented
[1:33:17] their sins can we can we imagine telling
[1:33:20] them
[1:33:21] you are all you did was say a sinner
[1:33:25] sinner's prayer repeat after me jesus i
[1:33:28] love you
[1:33:29] i believe in you come in my heart amen
[1:33:31] oh now you
[1:33:32] are sealed you're filled you're
[1:33:34] circumcised your clothes
[1:33:37] and this is what rod and the group do
[1:33:39] nothing against him but i'm just saying
[1:33:40] this is my debate right
[1:33:42] you're born you're quickened you're
[1:33:44] baptized and all the rest well my wife
[1:33:46] and i can tell you we were in college
[1:33:47] campuses
[1:33:48] we saw many people that went said the
[1:33:50] sinner's prayer and they weren't nothing
[1:33:52] of this
[1:33:53] the only thing that was born in them was
[1:33:55] a greater desire to watch movies and
[1:33:57] smoke and drink and live like the world
[1:34:00] nothing was really born to them so what
[1:34:02] evil what sin is that
[1:34:06] where they tell people you're filled
[1:34:08] god's spirit is flowing out of you
[1:34:10] and you just said a sinner's prayer what
[1:34:12] evil is that
[1:34:14] i'll tell you what it is one thing it's
[1:34:16] a form of godliness
[1:34:17] but denying the power thereof there it
[1:34:19] is there it is
[1:34:20] it's the white and suffolker jesus said
[1:34:22] you are white and beautiful supplicers
[1:34:25] you're a beautiful cave where dead
[1:34:26] bodies go or a beautiful gravestone
[1:34:28] whatever
[1:34:29] that application is you're beautiful on
[1:34:31] the outside but inside you are full of
[1:34:33] corruption
[1:34:36] what spirit what evil spirit would tell
[1:34:38] people
[1:34:39] god's life is flowing out of you
[1:34:42] and you are sealed and the world is
[1:34:44] circumcised unto you
[1:34:47] and yet they'll go enjoy all every
[1:34:49] pleasure of the world
[1:34:52] that's the evil spirit church that's an
[1:34:55] evil spirit
[1:34:56] giving them a form of godliness and
[1:35:00] denying the power
[1:35:01] the blood of jesus christ denying the
[1:35:04] power thereof
[1:35:06] the lord willing the holy spirit will
[1:35:08] give me more insight on that i need to
[1:35:10] make that a major doctrine
[1:35:12] is it because the holy ghost how many
[1:35:13] know the holy ghost baptism is a major
[1:35:14] doctrine
[1:35:15] well this is the evil of it this is the
[1:35:17] evil that goes against the true teaching
[1:35:20] is that you already got all these things
[1:35:22] you imagine telling israel
[1:35:24] you just you're walking out of egypt you
[1:35:26] know with the they got they got uh
[1:35:27] earrings on
[1:35:29] you're already in canaan's land what
[1:35:31] kind of wickedness would that be
[1:35:33] you're just possessed your land you're
[1:35:35] already there go ahead and possess it
[1:35:37] right now
[1:35:38] and yet egypt is like a few feet away
[1:35:40] that's what they're doing
[1:35:42] they haven't really crossed through the
[1:35:44] waters where all the task masters die
[1:35:48] when my cussing died and i never cussed
[1:35:50] again and my cigarette smoke and died
[1:35:52] all the task masters are dead praise god
[1:35:55] they never even pastored that
[1:35:58] and yet they're telling you you are in
[1:35:59] the promised land you are a possessor of
[1:36:01] all these promises
[1:36:03] maybe potentially but not literally
[1:36:09] i'm really grateful for the message of
[1:36:10] the hour oh i think i am
[1:36:13] because two years ago bible club we had
[1:36:14] a brother come in nice brother
[1:36:16] but he believes us and he told
[1:36:19] five-year-olds we
[1:36:20] had kindergarteners there first second
[1:36:21] third fourth so we had five grade levels
[1:36:23] there and he said
[1:36:25] he said if you he said how many believe
[1:36:27] and the all the kids raised their hand
[1:36:28] because they did
[1:36:31] yeah they raised their hand while
[1:36:32] they're like playing with suckers and
[1:36:34] you know
[1:36:37] and he said jesus said the works that i
[1:36:39] do you'll do also and greater these
[1:36:42] greater works than these shall you do
[1:36:43] and he said children don't you know you
[1:36:45] might walk into
[1:36:46] hospitals and bring out every sick
[1:36:48] person out of the hospitals because
[1:36:49] you're already filled with the holy
[1:36:51] spirit and you can do greater works than
[1:36:52] jesus i'm
[1:36:53] i'm literally sitting there like oh god
[1:36:55] i feel pain in my heart like this is so
[1:36:57] wrong
[1:36:57] it's so wrong and so when i i always
[1:37:01] close it because i'm the leader that i
[1:37:02] just go up there and i say
[1:37:03] jesus uh forgive us we love you help us
[1:37:06] to you know be
[1:37:07] kind help us to grow in knowledge of
[1:37:08] your word like what can i say
[1:37:10] and there's parents all standing in the
[1:37:11] back
[1:37:14] but you know he was in and out i was
[1:37:15] there every week so i think they got the
[1:37:16] idea so i taught him
[1:37:17] i taught him the three works of grace
[1:37:19] later so they knew
[1:37:22] i don't care what he says i know what
[1:37:23] the bible says
[1:37:25] but what evil is that to tell someone
[1:37:28] you have
[1:37:29] all the blessing you're in canaan's land
[1:37:31] and they're just a few feet away from
[1:37:33] their egyptian lifestyle
[1:37:36] that's wickedness that's a lie
[1:37:43] let me see what okay let me close with
[1:37:45] this one here i'm a little over an hour
[1:37:47] let me close with this one here
[1:37:50] you enjoying this praise the lord me too
[1:37:52] i really
[1:37:53] am i i just love this message i love how
[1:37:55] it defeats every
[1:37:57] foe praise god now so he gave one last
[1:38:00] additional point
[1:38:02] he criticized the idea that
[1:38:06] receiving the word for your day is
[1:38:07] receiving the holy ghost baptism he
[1:38:09] criticized that
[1:38:12] because remember he says you can't use
[1:38:14] acts because those are stories now
[1:38:16] can't use jonah now it's just a story
[1:38:18] you can't use that
[1:38:19] no you can use it so let's read these
[1:38:24] this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:38:26] you have to believe
[1:38:27] all the word for your day if you want to
[1:38:29] be born again not if you want to be
[1:38:31] saved
[1:38:32] if you want to be born again okay let's
[1:38:34] go to acts 18
[1:38:35] 24 please acts 18 24. this proves it
[1:38:38] beyond all shadow doubt
[1:38:43] brother ram said these were shouting
[1:38:44] baptist brother amen
[1:38:46] apollos was preaching and the bible said
[1:38:49] he was mighty mightily convincing them
[1:38:50] that jesus was the christ
[1:38:52] can you imagine a mighty teacher he's
[1:38:54] just proven he said look at this i
[1:38:56] imagine he was using psalm 16 and isaiah
[1:38:58] 53. look at this and he was mildly
[1:39:00] teaching them eloquently he never
[1:39:02] stuttered like i do i stutter all
[1:39:03] morning right
[1:39:04] you just saw me stutter and everybody
[1:39:06] laughs at me and i laughed too
[1:39:07] so i deserved to be laughed at but uh
[1:39:10] this man never stuttered
[1:39:11] he was so eloquent he could write he
[1:39:13] could rightly divide it and point to
[1:39:15] everything and lay it all out and people
[1:39:17] were excited and happy to come
[1:39:19] under sanctification the ephesians were
[1:39:24] acts 18 24 and a certain jew named
[1:39:27] apollos born at alexandria
[1:39:29] an eloquent man boy i wish i got that
[1:39:31] gift but i don't sorry
[1:39:33] i guess you all lose out and mighty in
[1:39:35] the scriptures came to ephesus but
[1:39:37] that's one thing i do desire i do desire
[1:39:38] to be mighty in the scriptures
[1:39:40] this man was instructed in the way of
[1:39:42] the lord and being fervent in the spirit
[1:39:44] so he was real zealous
[1:39:46] i want to do that too so i can get some
[1:39:48] of these but i surely can't get the
[1:39:49] eloquent one
[1:39:51] ah now that's my desire now being fervor
[1:39:53] in the spirit
[1:39:54] he spake and taught diligently the
[1:39:56] things of the lord knowing only
[1:39:58] the baptism of john he didn't know the
[1:40:02] full
[1:40:02] word of his hour
[1:40:07] and he began to speak boldly in the
[1:40:08] synagogue look at that bold
[1:40:10] he going a bunch of those jews i'm
[1:40:12] sanctified i'm justified he'd preach
[1:40:14] jesus
[1:40:16] boldly that's why we've seen a lot of
[1:40:18] message preachers fall away they were
[1:40:19] bold but they never got
[1:40:21] born again right you can be bold
[1:40:24] you can be eloquent my we got eloquent
[1:40:26] preachers thank god for them
[1:40:27] thank god for apollos but the idea is
[1:40:30] don't stop with sanctification
[1:40:31] go all the way in cross over jordan let
[1:40:34] the word go before you
[1:40:36] drive out all the enemies of your life
[1:40:38] praise god and possess the promises god
[1:40:40] gave for you
[1:40:44] i'm going to say amen to that amen glory
[1:40:48] hallelujah that's what we need
[1:40:53] he began to speak boldly verse 26 in the
[1:40:54] synagogue whom
[1:40:56] when aquila and priscilla had heard they
[1:40:59] took on the hit on
[1:41:00] him unto them rather and expounded unto
[1:41:02] him the way of god more perfectly now
[1:41:04] see women preachers will use this one
[1:41:06] and say
[1:41:06] well see uh priscilla was a preacher too
[1:41:09] she instructed apollos no i don't think
[1:41:12] that's what it means
[1:41:13] if that's what it means then that
[1:41:14] contradicts what paul said in 1st
[1:41:16] corinthians 14 and 1st timothy 2.
[1:41:19] so she might have testified and she
[1:41:22] could testify and say now listen apollos
[1:41:25] i was i was sanctified too
[1:41:28] but once aquila and i heard the message
[1:41:30] of paul
[1:41:32] and a peter we got the holy ghost it's
[1:41:35] real
[1:41:36] there's more than just that bold and
[1:41:38] there's more than that there's
[1:41:39] an in living the spirit of jesus christ
[1:41:41] is living in me
[1:41:43] and through her testimony she can
[1:41:44] instruct how many believe that
[1:41:46] it's just like john chapter 4 with the
[1:41:49] woman at the well right
[1:41:50] she went in the scene and said come and
[1:41:52] see a man that told me
[1:41:53] everything i ever did is not this the
[1:41:55] messiah
[1:41:57] it's a testimony praise god
[1:42:03] thank the lord hallelujah
[1:42:08] so no pursuit didn't preach him a sermon
[1:42:10] can you imagine we're still saying
[1:42:12] aquila can you sit down hubby i'm gonna
[1:42:14] preach now
[1:42:17] i don't think i can imagine that
[1:42:21] that's what would have had to happen
[1:42:22] verse 27 and when he was disposed to
[1:42:24] pass into a chao
[1:42:26] the brethren wrote exhorting the
[1:42:27] disciples to receive him who when he was
[1:42:29] come
[1:42:30] help them much which had believed
[1:42:31] through grace
[1:42:34] for he mightily convinced the jews and
[1:42:37] that
[1:42:38] publicly now look he's a public debater
[1:42:39] look at that that's why i like that guy
[1:42:41] ray comfort
[1:42:42] he gets on that have you ever seen him
[1:42:44] he gets on that uh
[1:42:45] soapbox uh over there in california
[1:42:48] every saturday
[1:42:50] and he video records it and he debates
[1:42:52] all these atheists
[1:42:54] up and down i love it i've always told
[1:42:56] my wife if the lord tarries
[1:42:58] and i don't think california is going to
[1:43:00] fall in the ocean i'm going to go out
[1:43:00] there and get training on that
[1:43:02] i would love i'm starting to get into
[1:43:03] debating i think that's a good idea
[1:43:05] because that's what they did in the
[1:43:06] bible the bible said
[1:43:09] he publicly showed by the scriptures
[1:43:12] that jesus was the christ amen
[1:43:14] and we can publicly show that this
[1:43:16] message is jesus christ amen
[1:43:19] but ram said i may not do it but this
[1:43:22] message will introduce jesus
[1:43:24] christ to the world amen
[1:43:27] that's what he said and look away to
[1:43:28] jesus 1963 i think december 29th
[1:43:36] so see he publicly convinced them verse
[1:43:39] one of chapter 19. we'll finish with
[1:43:40] this
[1:43:43] yeah i'll just stop right there cause
[1:43:44] i'm gonna i'm ready about an hour and 15
[1:43:46] minutes here
[1:43:48] and it came to pass that while apollos
[1:43:50] was at corinth
[1:43:51] paul having passed through the upper
[1:43:53] coast of ephesus
[1:43:55] i'm sorry came to ephesus and finding
[1:43:57] certain disciples he said unto them have
[1:43:59] ye received the holy ghost since he
[1:44:00] believed
[1:44:02] and they said to him we have not so much
[1:44:04] as heard whether there be any holy ghost
[1:44:08] yet brother amen they heard everything
[1:44:10] about jesus
[1:44:11] is the resurrected messiah he's the
[1:44:13] crucified lamb he's the risen lamb
[1:44:15] all these scriptures he fulfilled they
[1:44:17] rejoiced they were so bold and happy
[1:44:20] about it but they never knew there was
[1:44:21] more they never knew there was more word
[1:44:24] for their age
[1:44:26] so god sent it to them i love that amen
[1:44:29] that's the reason god sent the message
[1:44:31] to you and i because he knew he wanted
[1:44:32] it praise god
[1:44:34] he knew he wanted to go further with god
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:37] god we he knew it so he sent it to us so
[1:44:39] we could become and the bible said he
[1:44:41] gives us his word
[1:44:42] that we can become the sons of god
[1:44:45] we already were sons of god but when the
[1:44:47] holy ghost comes then
[1:44:49] we fulfill it we manifest it that we are
[1:44:51] the sons and daughters of god
[1:44:53] amen glory
[1:44:59] and he said to them unto what then were
[1:45:00] you baptized and they said unto john's
[1:45:02] baptism
[1:45:03] so baptism is connected to the baptism
[1:45:05] holy ghost
[1:45:07] you're you have to be correctly baptized
[1:45:10] and then if you weren't like in acts
[1:45:11] chapter 10
[1:45:12] like a po like corneos then you'll
[1:45:14] immediately get baptized
[1:45:16] peter commanded them to be baptized
[1:45:18] after they're already baptized to the
[1:45:19] holy ghost
[1:45:22] verse 4 then said paul john barely
[1:45:24] baptized with the baptism of repentance
[1:45:27] saying unto the people that they should
[1:45:28] believe on him which should come after
[1:45:31] him that is
[1:45:32] on christ jesus and when they heard this
[1:45:35] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:45:36] lord jesus
[1:45:37] and when paul laid his hands upon them
[1:45:39] the holy ghost came on them
[1:45:41] and they spake with tongues and
[1:45:42] prophesied and all the men were about
[1:45:45] 12.
[1:45:46] i love this apollos is out of town so a
[1:45:49] guest minister comes in
[1:45:52] he preaches the message of the hour and
[1:45:53] the people get the holy ghost
[1:45:55] i wonder who got it first i wonder if
[1:45:57] apollo's got it while he was out
[1:45:59] where was he at in verse corinth
[1:46:03] i wonder if apollos the pastor got the
[1:46:05] holy ghost in corn
[1:46:06] while his home church got it there with
[1:46:08] paul in ephesus
[1:46:11] oh my that's beautiful praise god
[1:46:15] see this proves church you have to
[1:46:18] receive the word of your day
[1:46:20] to receive the holy ghost now jesus can
[1:46:22] come
[1:46:23] jesus could come and and in a vision of
[1:46:25] someone and they could get saved and
[1:46:27] sanctified and maybe filled with holy
[1:46:29] ghost
[1:46:29] but that that's a possibility but one
[1:46:32] thing's for sure
[1:46:34] many people need a man they need a
[1:46:36] preacher a physical man
[1:46:38] to preach them the word of the hour and
[1:46:41] god sends his own men
[1:46:42] to work for him to preach the word of
[1:46:44] the hour that the people can receive the
[1:46:46] word of their hour
[1:46:47] and receive it and be baptized with the
[1:46:49] holy ghost
[1:46:51] like when i was in guyana let's say
[1:46:53] murphy when i was in guyana i had a
[1:46:55] brother
[1:46:57] i loved this brother because when i
[1:46:59] would be preaching they had you know
[1:47:00] they had a doorway and there was no door
[1:47:02] on it
[1:47:02] and it's like 90 degrees and i'm
[1:47:04] preaching i'd be preaching and
[1:47:06] the spirit would be rising he'd go like
[1:47:08] this he go
[1:47:09] that's solid that's solid brother jesse
[1:47:12] he was just that's that was his way of
[1:47:13] preaching
[1:47:14] i said that was the way of preaching
[1:47:15] with me rather and i love that brother
[1:47:17] but he come up afterwards i said brother
[1:47:19] you just said you're so happy
[1:47:20] why are you so happy he said i was a
[1:47:22] muslim
[1:47:23] he said i was drunk with alcohol on the
[1:47:26] couch
[1:47:27] watching a movie he said and jesus
[1:47:29] christ appeared to me he starts crying
[1:47:30] while he's saying this
[1:47:32] he said jesus christ came to me in a
[1:47:34] vision i was high on weed i was drunk
[1:47:36] he said jesus christ came to me and said
[1:47:39] something like this
[1:47:41] i'm real and i want you to serve me
[1:47:44] and he said he fell on his knees he was
[1:47:47] drunk and high
[1:47:48] and he said brother amen when his niece
[1:47:50] hit the floor it all left him
[1:47:52] all the drunkenness all the it all left
[1:47:54] him but he didn't stop there sister
[1:47:56] beatrice
[1:47:57] he went to church and pretty soon he met
[1:47:59] some message people
[1:48:01] amen and then he came to the message
[1:48:04] church and got born again praise god
[1:48:06] amen
[1:48:07] that's what i'm saying jesus can save
[1:48:09] people himself just by visions
[1:48:11] but jesus is not going to just throw you
[1:48:13] out there to just do it all by yourself
[1:48:15] he attaches you to the body amen the
[1:48:18] body of believers praise god
[1:48:20] because we are a body and we need each
[1:48:22] other and we're the body of christ
[1:48:24] amen so the ephesians
[1:48:28] got the holy ghost by receiving a part
[1:48:30] of the body of christ that when they
[1:48:32] received
[1:48:32] paul they received christ musicians if
[1:48:36] you'll come
[1:48:39] i don't know about you church but that's
[1:48:41] solid
[1:48:43] praise god that this sermon
[1:48:46] is solid amen it's the word of god
[1:48:50] it is the word of god lord willing
[1:48:52] tonight we'll maybe i'll just continue
[1:48:54] on this oh yeah i thought about doing
[1:48:55] the showdown
[1:48:55] i may do that one i got just got to get
[1:48:57] a few thoughts together on that one but
[1:49:00] i had a lot i was gonna go through
[1:49:03] question three for both of us did i get
[1:49:06] to question four
[1:49:11] okay i got the question for okay
[1:49:14] yeah okay so i left off so i left off at
[1:49:16] two and a half hours into the debate
[1:49:18] it's about three and a half hours so i
[1:49:19] got about
[1:49:20] no i'm just gonna hit the highlights of
[1:49:21] there by god's grace
[1:49:23] are you grateful for the solid word of
[1:49:25] god amen i'm glad to stand on the solid
[1:49:27] rock of god's word
[1:49:30] i'm glad we're amen i don't have to lie
[1:49:31] to these kids and say oh you got
[1:49:33] baptized you're filled with the holy
[1:49:34] ghost i'm glad i don't have to lie
[1:49:35] through my teeth like that what kind of
[1:49:37] preacher would i be
[1:49:40] i encourage him you're saved now go on
[1:49:42] to sanctification
[1:49:44] remember sunday school lily i taught you
[1:49:46] a maokai that one year i said where do
[1:49:48] you think you are i gave them three
[1:49:49] little boxes
[1:49:50] are you in justification sanctification
[1:49:52] or matches
[1:49:53] that's the holy ghost and they had to
[1:49:55] decide
[1:49:56] because they need to know that you don't
[1:49:59] stop after justification
[1:50:02] you don't stop after just going through
[1:50:03] the red sea well then it's hot then you
[1:50:05] need some man and then you need some
[1:50:06] water

[1:50:09] wants to live in the desert
[1:50:11] i want to live where there's milk and
[1:50:13] honey praise god
[1:50:15] i live where i got my own place it's not
[1:50:18] sandy

[1:50:27] where i can live in other words i want
[1:50:28] to live where god wants me to live
