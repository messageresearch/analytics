[0:03] And if a woman won't have a baby for her
[0:05] husband,
[0:07] she'll take a daughter or cat or
[0:09] something.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; She's got to mother something.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; It's a nature. But to bear a child for a
[0:16] husband and raise it to the service of
[0:18] God, that's entirely all out of her
[0:21] line.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; Mother has in the church bounty of dogs.
[0:29] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:31] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:34] this video [music] is to show how God's
[0:35] prophet brother William Brham recognized
[0:38] a trend amongst American women who did
[0:41] not want to have children as early as
[0:43] 1952. [music]
[0:44] And then the American vice president JD
[0:46] Vance had recognized this as well around
[0:50] the year 2021.
[0:52] God's prophet, Brother William Brandham,
[0:54] connected this trend with a prophecy
[0:57] from the Lord Jesus that's connected to
[0:59] the tribulation period. And so, it's a
[1:01] tribulation anointing that is upon women
[1:04] today because we're approaching the
[1:06] great tribulation period. And this
[1:08] tribulation anointing is causing them to
[1:10] not want to have children. Brother
[1:13] Brandham recognized this anointing in
[1:15] its seed form as early as 1952. And then
[1:18] this is only increasing. So, we'll look
[1:20] at this subject here. by the grace of
[1:22] God. Now, the origin of this video was a
[1:24] few weeks ago I was listening to the
[1:26] invisible union of the heavenly
[1:28] bridegroom and the earthly bride because
[1:30] it has a thanksgiving message in it and
[1:32] I came across again this beautiful
[1:34] section where brother Brandham is
[1:36] talking about this end time prophecy
[1:38] from the Lord Jesus and in that section
[1:41] is one of my favorite quotes where he
[1:43] says acts 238 youngans and that's the
[1:46] only kind of children the word can bring
[1:48] forth. It's a beautiful, memorable
[1:51] masterpiece type of quote, I would say,
[1:53] by the grace of God. And then I had
[1:55] remembered that over a year ago, the
[1:58] liberal American media was all upset at
[2:01] JD Vance for saying that American
[2:04] democratic leaders were a bunch of cat
[2:06] ladies. And so, I thought I'd make a
[2:08] video about this by the grace of God
[2:09] because it does connect to the scripture
[2:11] again with the tribulation anointing as
[2:14] we'll see. This is a compound prophecy
[2:16] from the Lord Jesus Christ out of Luke
[2:18] chapter 23 by the grace of God. Friends,
[2:21] please know that I'm not trying to
[2:23] support the Republican party. Of course,
[2:25] I have always voted Republican and only
[2:27] Republican, but I realize both parties
[2:30] are ultimately controlled by the devil.
[2:33] So, I'm voting for the lesser of two
[2:34] evils. I understand that. Matthew
[2:36] chapter 4 is proof of all governments
[2:40] being motivated by Satan. As brother Ram
[2:42] said with thus sayith the Lord when
[2:45] Satan offered the Lord Jesus the
[2:47] kingdoms of this world and Jesus did not
[2:50] correct him. So Satan ultimately has
[2:52] control over the majority of government
[2:54] workers but there are some good
[2:55] government workers and there are some
[2:57] glimpses of hope every now and then such
[2:59] as when Ro versus Wade was overturned.
[3:01] I'd been praying for that for a few
[3:03] years with weeping and crying at the
[3:05] altar at the church and God mercifully
[3:08] overturned Ro v.
[3:10] through the United States Supreme Court.
[3:13] So, I'm thankful for that. I'm thankful
[3:14] for the southern border being closed
[3:16] down, thankfully. And I'm thankful that
[3:18] our religious freedoms here in the
[3:19] United States have been protected by the
[3:21] grace of God. And there's nothing wrong
[3:23] with voting as long as you do the best
[3:24] you can by your conscience through the
[3:26] Holy Ghost. Brother Ram said he voted
[3:28] for Nixon when it was Kennedy versus
[3:30] Nixon, but Nixon lost.
[3:34] So, there's nothing wrong with voting.
[3:35] God's ultimately in control. But
[3:37] recently when I was listening to this
[3:38] sermon, the invisible union, I
[3:40] remembered how brother Bam rebuked these
[3:42] women for not wanting children. And then
[3:45] I connected that with JD Vance who was
[3:47] rebuking the Democratic Party. And
[3:50] friends, the Democratic Party even had
[3:52] mobile abortion clinics set up at their
[3:55] Democratic National Convention. So this
[3:58] shows they are the party of death and
[4:00] not the party of life. And of course,
[4:02] the DNC supports surgeries on children's
[4:06] bodies. And I'm just having to watch my
[4:08] words here because I'm on YouTube. And
[4:10] JD Vance pointed this out well before
[4:13] the 2024 presidential election back in
[4:16] 2021. I'll play a clip here of how JD
[4:19] Vance is explaining why he said the cat
[4:21] lady's comment. He said because the
[4:24] Democratic party is becoming anti-family
[4:26] and anti-child. Let's listen to the
[4:29] quote. run in this country via the
[4:31] Democrats, via via our corporate
[4:33] oligarchs by a bunch of childless cat
[4:35] ladies who are miserable at their own
[4:37] lives and the choices that they've made.
[4:38] And so they want to make the rest of the
[4:40] country miserable, too. And it's just a
[4:41] basic fact. You look at Kla Harris, Pete
[4:44] Budajage, AOC, the entire future of the
[4:47] Democrats is controlled by people
[4:49] without children. This is about
[4:50] criticizing the Democratic has lied
[4:52] about this that this is not about
[4:54] criticizing people who for various
[4:55] reasons didn't have kids. This is about
[4:57] criticizing the Democratic Party for
[4:59] becoming anti-f family and anti-child.
[5:02] So with that introduction, friends,
[5:04] let's look at a Bible foundation of how
[5:05] God honors motherhood and of course
[5:07] fatherhood as well, but this particular
[5:09] video is focusing on motherhood. Read
[5:11] the entire chapter of Proverbs 31 and
[5:13] you'll see how God honors a Proverbs 31
[5:15] woman. Not only does she take care of
[5:17] the children in the home, she provides
[5:20] clothing, food, but I believe even later
[5:22] on in life, she can get into business
[5:24] deals because the Bible said she'll
[5:26] consider a field and purchase it. And I
[5:28] love verse 28. It says, "Her children
[5:30] arise up and call her blessed and her
[5:32] husband also, and he praiseth her." So,
[5:36] motherhood is honorable. It's fruitful.
[5:38] It's worthy of public praise within the
[5:41] family and before God. Here's one of my
[5:44] favorite verses I found recently. And
[5:45] what I mean by that is in the past
[5:47] couple years Psalm 144 9-12 I'll just
[5:51] read 9 and 12 I will sing a new song
[5:54] unto thee oh God upon a sultry and upon
[5:56] and an instrument of 10 strings will I
[5:58] sing praises unto thee in verse 12 that
[6:00] our sons may be as plants grown up in
[6:03] their youth and that our daughters may
[6:04] be as cornerstones polished after the
[6:07] similitude of a palace. So this
[6:10] scripture struck me and I think I
[6:12] preached it on Mother's Day a few years
[6:14] ago. the daughters of Israel would
[6:16] become as cornerstones. And this
[6:18] reminded me of the quote from brother
[6:19] Brandham where he said, "My wife is my
[6:21] backbone. She's the backbone of my
[6:23] family."
[6:28] The cornerstone is the foundation of a
[6:30] palace or a building. The backbone is
[6:33] the foundation or the stability of the
[6:36] human body. And so we see the scripture
[6:38] connect a woman to a cornerstone. And
[6:40] what's also very powerful is that Jesus
[6:42] Christ is called the cornerstone. And so
[6:44] here we see how God created both male
[6:46] and female. In the beginning, Adam was a
[6:50] spirit and Adam had inside of him the
[6:53] feminine nature. And then God pulled Eve
[6:56] out of Adam. And so God designed this
[6:59] feminine attribute to be inside of Adam
[7:02] and it still expresses the glory of God.
[7:04] So these dominant attributes and these
[7:06] submissive attributes, they all come
[7:07] from God. And here the woman is likened
[7:10] unto a cornerstone. She's the
[7:12] foundation. I could say amen to that for
[7:14] my family. My wife is the foundation of
[7:17] my life, my family, my ministry. Or as
[7:19] brother Ram would say, she's the
[7:20] backbone of my ministry and my family by
[7:23] God's grace. So again, look how God
[7:25] honors motherhood. Look how God honors
[7:27] mothers, calling them cornerstones, just
[7:30] like the Lord Jesus Christ is our
[7:32] cornerstone. So the value of a woman is
[7:35] great. I believe that's what Song of
[7:38] Solomon says. She's more valuable than
[7:40] fine rubies. It's hard to put a value on
[7:44] a godly, holy ghostfilled Christian
[7:46] woman, Christian mother by the grace of
[7:48] God. Isaiah 66:13 says, "As one whom his
[7:52] mother comforteth, so will I comfort
[7:54] you, and ye shall be comforted in
[7:56] Jerusalem." So God is saying he's going
[7:59] to comfort Israel as a mother comforts.
[8:03] And this reminds us of the quotes of
[8:04] brother Brandham about a mother's love.
[8:06] Nothing is greater than a mother's love.
[8:09] And love is the greatest gift according
[8:10] to 1 Corinthians 13. If you have faith,
[8:13] hope, and charity, the greatest of these
[8:14] is charity. And in context, Isaiah 66 is
[8:17] speaking of the sealing of the 144,000.
[8:20] So now we get the idea of the baptism of
[8:22] the Holy Ghost. When a person receives
[8:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's as
[8:26] if they're getting a mother's comfort or
[8:28] God's comfort. And the Holy Ghost is
[8:30] called the Comforter. Isaiah 66:8 shows
[8:33] us this. Or shall a nation be born at
[8:35] once. For as soon as Zion travaleth, she
[8:37] brought forth her children. This is
[8:38] speaking of the 144,000. The nation will
[8:41] be born in one day. And we also see that
[8:44] in Revelation 7 where the 144,000 are
[8:46] sealed in their foreheads by the Holy
[8:48] Ghost. Isaiah 66:12 brings in the
[8:51] Gentiles. So this shows also a
[8:53] connection with the millennium that
[8:55] follows shortly after the 144,000 are
[8:58] sealed. For thus sayith the Lord,
[9:00] behold, I will extend peace to her like
[9:01] a river and the glory of the Gentiles
[9:03] like a flowing stream. So we know during
[9:06] the millennium all the nations will be
[9:08] under the governance of the Lord Jesus
[9:10] Christ as he sits in the millennial
[9:12] temple ruling the nations with a rod of
[9:14] iron. So that's when the glory of the
[9:16] Gentiles flows like a stream. All
[9:19] nations will bring their glory to
[9:21] Jerusalem to the millennial temple. So
[9:24] again, God will comfort Israel like a
[9:26] mother comforts her child. And then we
[9:29] see how Timothy in 2 Timothy 1:5 had the
[9:33] faith of his mother and grandmother when
[9:35] I called to remembrance the unfeign
[9:37] faith that is in thee which dwelt first
[9:39] in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother
[9:42] Ununice and I persuaded that in thee
[9:44] also. So this shows the power of
[9:47] parenting how parents can help mold and
[9:51] shape the faith of their children. This
[9:53] is the blessing of God going from one
[9:55] generation to the next. And that's what
[9:58] God promised in Exodus 34. Not only
[10:01] would he visit the iniquity from one
[10:03] generation to the next for those who did
[10:05] not repent, he would also visit the
[10:07] blessing of one generation to the next
[10:10] generation. And so we see that
[10:12] vindicated and identified in the life of
[10:15] Timothy. And lastly, Psalm 127:3, lo,
[10:19] children are inheritage of the Lord, and
[10:22] the fruit of the womb is his reward. So
[10:24] women having children is the reward of
[10:26] God. Motherhood is directly tied to
[10:29] God's blessing and covenant inheritance.
[10:33] Children are a heritage of the Lord.
[10:34] Children are the possession of the Lord.
[10:36] So God just gives us children as his
[10:38] reward and we just take care of them for
[10:40] a little time as brother Brandham said,
[10:42] and then they're able to walk with God
[10:44] themselves by the grace of God. So now
[10:47] let's look at brother Bram's use of
[10:49] prophecy regarding the trend of the
[10:51] United States women despising
[10:54] motherhood. Bar was using Luke 23 27-31.
[11:00] This is Jesus on his way to be
[11:02] crucified. And in verse 28, Jesus turned
[11:06] to the women which were bewailing and
[11:09] lamenting him. And he said, "Daughters
[11:10] of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep
[11:12] for yourselves and for your children.
[11:14] For behold, the days are coming in which
[11:16] they shall say, blessed are the barren
[11:18] and the wombs that never bear, and the
[11:20] paps which never gave suck." Then shall
[11:22] they begin to say to the mountains fall
[11:24] on us and to the hills cover us. For if
[11:26] they do these things in a green tree,
[11:28] what shall be done in the dry? Now this
[11:31] was fulfilled during the days of Roman
[11:35] general Titus who sieged the city of
[11:38] Jerusalem around 70 AD. But there's also
[11:40] a compound prophecy for the tribulation
[11:42] as well. Notice in verse 30 of Luke 23,
[11:45] they'll say to the mountains, "Fall on
[11:47] us." Well, that should remind us
[11:49] immediately of Revelation 6:es 15 and 16
[11:54] in the section on the sixth seal. The
[11:57] Bible said in verse 15, "The kings of
[11:59] the earth, the great men, the rich men,
[12:00] chief captains, hid themselves in the
[12:02] dens and in the rocks and the
[12:04] mountains." In verse 16, "And said to
[12:05] the mountains and rocks, fall on us and
[12:08] hide us from the face of him that siteth
[12:10] on the throne and from the wrath of the
[12:11] lamb." So here we see the very same
[12:14] words, fall on us. So those who are
[12:16] under judgment in the days of Titus said
[12:18] fall on us mountains and then those who
[12:21] will be judged during the great
[12:22] tribulation will say to the mountains of
[12:24] rocks fall on us. And in both time
[12:26] periods there was this statement that
[12:29] the women were blessed not to have
[12:31] children. So if that happened in the
[12:33] days of Titus and it's going to repeat
[12:35] also in the great tribulation but
[12:37] thankfully the bride of Jesus Christ who
[12:38] is filled with the Holy Ghost will not
[12:40] be here on the earth. She is promised a
[12:42] pardon from the wrath of God. According
[12:44] to 1 Timothy chapter 5, the tribulation
[12:47] is God's wrath being poured out upon the
[12:49] earth, the disbelieving earth. The bride
[12:51] of Jesus Christ will be snatched away or
[12:53] caught up snatched away quickly in the
[12:55] moment in the twinkling of an eye and
[12:57] taken to the marriage supper of the
[12:59] lamb. Now, let's look at three quotes
[13:00] from God's prophet, brother Brandham.
[13:02] The earliest quote from God's prophet,
[13:04] brother Brandham, that he noticed this
[13:07] trend of women not wanting children was
[13:08] in 1952, August 10th. I am the
[13:11] resurrection and the life in Chicago,
[13:13] Illinois. He was talking about the Old
[13:14] Testament saints and said they had
[13:17] prayed for God all these years to take
[13:18] away her reproach and she could bear
[13:20] children as it was an honor for any
[13:22] Hebrew woman to have a child. Think of
[13:24] that. It was an honor to have children
[13:26] and for about half of America it's a
[13:28] dishonor but not for the believers of
[13:30] course. But the man said how they've
[13:32] changed that now. It's almost a dishonor
[13:34] to have a child. Now isn't that right?
[13:36] You might not say amen but it's the
[13:37] truth. The woman had rather pay $100 for
[13:40] a little old smashed nose dog and give
[13:42] it a mother's love out here than to fool
[13:45] with a baby. How sad that was in 1952.
[13:48] How sad it is now today with all the cat
[13:50] ladies and dog ladies who would rather
[13:53] have pets than children. Let's listen to
[13:55] the quote.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; I see an old man and a woman way past
[13:59] the age of bearing. the woman was. And
[14:01] she said they had prayed for God all
[14:04] these years to take away her reproach
[14:06] and she could bear children as it was an
[14:08] honor for any Hebrew woman to have a
[14:10] child. How they changed that now. It's
[14:12] almost un dishonor to have a child. Now,
[14:15] isn't that right? You might not say
[14:18] amen, but it's the truth. A woman had
[14:20] rather pay $100 for a little old
[14:22] smashing old dog and give it a mother's
[14:24] love out here than the fool with a baby.
[14:27] How you know that's the truth. walking
[14:29] down the street with a little sweater on
[14:30] it. And I've seen one of the biggest
[14:32] clinics I ever seen nearly out here was
[14:34] a dog clinic.
[14:36] I don't see it. I can't see it. All
[14:39] right. Anyhow, that's up between you and
[14:42] God.
[14:44] Next, in 1958, handwriting on the wall,
[14:46] June 18th, Brother Random said,
[14:48] "Motherhood is marred. The church is
[14:50] gone to the dogs." And I think that has
[14:52] both a spiritual and natural meaning
[14:54] because dogs in the Bible were
[14:55] homosexuals and sodomites. He said,
[14:57] "Motherhood and great principles like
[14:59] that is broken when mothers pay $100 for
[15:02] a little snotty-nosed dog and take it in
[15:05] the house and give it a mother's love
[15:07] and ride around in an automobile and
[15:09] practice birth control." So, Brother Ram
[15:11] again rebukes that. And notice even
[15:13] message believers today will take birth
[15:15] control to limit the number of children
[15:17] they're having. Friends, that's a sin. I
[15:20] have a video about that. I'll leave a
[15:21] link to that in the description by the
[15:22] grace of God. But it shows how those
[15:25] worldly attitudes and even the
[15:27] tribulation anointing gets on people who
[15:29] are afraid to have children or don't
[15:31] want to have children for whatever
[15:32] sinful reason they choose to. Let's
[15:34] listen to the quote.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; And it isn't communism THAT'S HURTING
[15:38] AMERICA. IT'S OUR OWN RIGHT AMONG US OR
[15:42] something that breaks the backbone of
[15:45] this nation. Mother has been ming the
[15:48] church of dogs.
[15:53] All the great things that we stood for,
[15:56] the great principles and things has rise
[15:58] beneath us.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; So it's our own boils that killed us,
[16:04] not communism or any other nation.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Sin is a reputation.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[16:14] Motherhood and great principles like
[16:16] that is broken when mothers pay a $100
[16:20] for little snotty little dogs, excuse
[16:22] that expression, and take IT IN THE
[16:24] HOUSE and give it a mother's law and
[16:27] ride it around in automobile and
[16:29] practice breast control. Any nation will
[16:31] shake under such stuff as
[16:34] &gt;&gt; amen. Not women are allowed to be
[16:37] stripped in the streets and walk down
[16:39] such things as uncensored television
[16:42] tests of old bugger. Four or five time
[16:45] married women prostitutes in the station
[16:48] and little girls take them for example.
[16:53] And here the final quote which kind of
[16:54] inspired this video was invisible union
[16:56] 1965 November 25th. It's on a Thursday
[17:00] night. I think it was Thanksgiving night
[17:02] if I'm not mistaken. Brother Ram talks
[17:04] in paragraph 117 about Eve didn't mean
[17:06] to do wrong. She was deceived. And
[17:08] brother Ram said that's exactly what
[17:09] happened to the women today. They're
[17:11] deceived by television. Of course,
[17:13] internet today, smartphones,
[17:15] magazines, modern girls, things they see
[17:18] on the street. But the Ram said, "She's
[17:19] dead and doesn't know it. She's far from
[17:22] God." Which I thought was powerful. It
[17:24] combines two scriptures. 1 Timothy 5:6,
[17:26] "But she that liveth in pleasure is dead
[17:28] while she liveth." Speaking of the widow
[17:30] woman that won't serve the Lord or runs
[17:33] off of some other rich man who's an
[17:35] unbeliever just to have financial
[17:37] support. So she is not born again if she
[17:39] does that. A woman that lives in sinful
[17:42] pleasure is not born again. And then
[17:45] brother Ram said and don't know it. I
[17:46] believe that's from Revelation 3:17.
[17:49] They say they're rich and increase with
[17:50] goods have need of nothing and knowest
[17:52] not that thou art wretched, miserable,
[17:54] poor, blind and naked. This is the
[17:56] leosian condition of today. So, Brother
[17:59] Ram says, "A lot of American women today
[18:01] are dead spiritually. They're not born
[18:02] again, and they don't know it. And
[18:05] they're far from God. They look to the
[18:08] world to be influenced by the world
[18:10] instead of the word of God." Let's
[18:12] listen to the quote.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Eve didn't mean to do wrong. It wasn't
[18:15] willfully, but she, the Bible said in
[18:18] second Timothy, 1 Timothy 3, she was
[18:20] deceived.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; And deceived is not when you willfully
[18:24] do it. It's when you're deceived into
[18:25] doing it. And that's just exactly what's
[18:27] happened today.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; She's been deceived by television, by
[18:32] magazines, by these people, THESE ALL
[18:35] THESE FINE THINGS THAT THEY'RE GOING out
[18:37] on the street, modern girls. They look
[18:39] at magazines and they look at pictures.
[18:41] They look on the street. They see the
[18:42] CLOTHING IN THE SHOPS. HOW SATAN, THAT
[18:45] GREAT INSTRUMENT of the of hell, has
[18:47] come down amongst the people and
[18:48] deceived them into these things.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; And the woman thinks she's all right.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; And she's dead and don't know it. Amen.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; She's far from God.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; See how she lost all this and how subtle
[19:01] it was.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Then in paragraph 119 120, brother Ram
[19:06] said, "Jesus spoke of this condition."
[19:08] And then he quotes Luke 23, he said,
[19:11] "Today it's a disgrace for her to have a
[19:13] child." Let's listen to the quote.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Today, I want you to notice Jesus spoke
[19:18] of it. Also, if you'd like to read it,
[19:21] Jesus made mention that this thing would
[19:22] come to pass. Did you know that in his
[19:25] last hours, just before his crucifixion,
[19:27] let's just read it. St. Luke the the
[19:29] 23rd chapter and just for a moment, like
[19:32] a Sunday school lesson, begin with the
[19:34] 27th verse. I believe I got marked out
[19:36] here. Jesus going to Calvary. Listen as
[19:38] I read it. All right. St. Luke 23:27.
[19:42] I believe that's where we have it. My
[19:44] notes got it that way. Yeah, here it is.
[19:47] And there followed him a great company
[19:49] of people and women, which also bewailed
[19:52] and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto
[19:55] them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem,
[19:58] weep not for me, but weep for yourselves
[20:01] and for your children.
[20:03] For behold, the day days are coming that
[20:07] they shall say, "Blessed are the barren,
[20:12] and the womb that never bear, and the
[20:15] paths which never gave."
[20:19] Think today the disgrace for to have a
[20:22] child.
[20:23] Then shall they begin to say, "TO THE
[20:26] MOUNTAINS, FALL ON US AND HIGH AND THE
[20:28] HILLS, COVER US." For if they do these
[20:31] things in a dream green tree, what shall
[20:33] they do in a track?
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Next, in paragraphs 121-25,
[20:40] the Ram said Jesus was speaking of a day
[20:42] when the women wouldn't want children.
[20:44] They want a dog or a cat and she'll have
[20:47] an operation performed to himself or her
[20:51] that'll keep them from having children.
[20:53] They don't want no children. Jesus spoke
[20:56] of this. Brother Ram said, he said,
[20:57] "It's the coming of the Lord." So the
[21:00] coming Lord is the rapture,
[21:02] pre-tribulation rapture to snatch away
[21:03] the bride and then that tribulation sets
[21:06] in with the tribulation anointing. But
[21:08] Ram said they pay great sums of money
[21:10] for cats, dogs to mother. She must
[21:12] mother something because it's her
[21:14] god-given nature to her. That's why
[21:16] these cat ladies get cats or puppies or
[21:18] whatever they get, birds, rabbits,
[21:20] whatever. They have a god-given nature
[21:22] to be a mother. And since they won't
[21:25] accept children, they don't want
[21:26] children. They've got to mother
[21:28] something. Let's listen to the quote.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; Speaking of the day that when women
[21:32] would no more want children. They want a
[21:35] dog or a cat
[21:38] &gt;&gt; or something like that,
[21:40] &gt;&gt; but she don't want children anymore.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Why? She's old Mother Hubard if she has
[21:45] a child.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; See, she don't want That's the That's
[21:49] the remarks of Hollywood. He don't want
[21:51] his woman to be an old mother hovered.
[21:55] So she'll he'll have some operation
[21:57] performed to himself or her one that'll
[22:00] keep her from having children. They
[22:02] don't want no children. JESUS SPOKE OF
[22:05] IT. AND WHAT DID HE SAY? AT that time
[22:07] they'll begin to cry for the rocks and
[22:08] the mountains to fall on her.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; She practice birth control so she can go
[22:14] to parties. She can't be bothered with a
[22:16] baby nursing her.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; It'll disform her when she's
[22:21] pregnantated. It'll be disarm her. She
[22:23] won't look like she used to. and her
[22:24] husband ignorant enough to let her go
[22:26] that way and she won't give him a child.
[22:30] Jesus spoke of it and he said that when
[22:32] they doing this at that time they'll go
[22:35] to crying land for the rocks to fall on
[22:37] him it's coming of the Lord. Next
[22:40] paragraphs 126 through 129, Belram talks
[22:43] about the mother bear, he had observed
[22:45] numerous times while hunting. And he
[22:48] says, "If her breeding doesn't take and
[22:51] she don't have any cubs, she'll hunt
[22:53] them up, the last year's cubs, and
[22:55] mother them all summer long because it's
[22:57] a god-given instinct. She has to mother
[22:59] something." So, Brother Am goes to the
[23:01] animal world to prove a principle of
[23:02] motherhood and then applies it to
[23:04] American women who have to mother
[23:06] something. Let's listen to the quote.
[23:08] They pray great sums of money for cats,
[23:10] dogs to mother. That's right.
[23:13] &gt;&gt; She must mother something because it's a
[23:15] god-given nature to her.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; I notice a hunt big game. An old bear in
[23:21] the fall of the year when she has been
[23:23] bred to the male bear. She's got cubs
[23:25] that is born, they're pretty good size
[23:27] cubs, maybe weigh 100 pounds or better.
[23:30] She'll make them scat and hibernate to
[23:32] themselves because she's going to bring
[23:34] forth some more cubs. They're born in
[23:36] February. The bear knows nothing about
[23:38] it. They're born in little sacks. How
[23:40] that God has them open these little
[23:41] sacks themselves. Little like little
[23:43] cellophene sacks. They find their way
[23:44] around their mother sound asleep. She
[23:46] hasn't eaten anything since October. And
[23:48] this is February. They come around and
[23:50] nurse her to the middle of May. Then
[23:53] when she sees her cubs are pretty
[23:54] goodized cubs, weigh maybe 15 10 15
[23:57] pounds a piece. They've nursed her. Why
[23:59] she gets the milk? That's God's idea.
[24:01] She lives herself and produces milk for
[24:03] the cubs. And then if her breeding
[24:05] doesn't take
[24:07] and she don't have any cubs, she'll hunt
[24:09] up that year last year cubs and mother
[24:11] them all summer long because it's
[24:14] God-given instinct. She has to mother
[24:16] something.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Next in paragraphs 130 and 131. Brother
[24:20] Ram says that's a woman that won't have
[24:22] a baby for her husband. She'll take a
[24:24] dog or cat because it's a nature that
[24:26] God gave to her and she'd be disgraced
[24:29] if she had a child with this sin-loving
[24:31] society of 1965 type of women. And
[24:35] that's what we have today, the
[24:36] sin-loving society of this 2025 type of
[24:40] women that don't want children. They'd
[24:41] rather be cat ladies. And brother Ram
[24:44] said that's a true picture of the modern
[24:45] church today. The modern church doesn't
[24:47] want these screaming, shouting,
[24:49] tongue-speaking Acts 2:38 youngans
[24:51] around her. She don't want any of them
[24:53] whooping and crying and screaming,
[24:54] "Amen. Hallelujah." Why, that would
[24:57] immediately put her out of her
[24:58] denomination. They'd throw her out real
[25:00] quick. Amazing, memorable, masterpiece
[25:03] quote. Let's listen to the quote.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; And if a woman won't have a baby for her
[25:07] husband,
[25:09] SHE'LL TAKE A DAUGHTER OR CAT OR
[25:11] SOMETHING.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; She's got to mother something.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; It's nature. But to bear a child for a
[25:18] husband and raise it to the service OF
[25:20] GOD, THAT'S ENTIRELY all out of her
[25:23] line.
[25:28] She should all should she'd be so
[25:29] disgraced if she did by her sinloving
[25:32] society. This 1965
[25:34] type of women, a true picture of the
[25:38] modern church today.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; NEITHER DOES THE MODERN CHURCH WANT ANY
[25:42] OF THESE YEARS SCREAMING, SHOUTING,
[25:44] tongue speaking. Acts 2:38 young ones
[25:46] around her.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; She don't want any of them
[25:51] &gt;&gt; moving and crying and screaming. Amen.
[25:53] Hallelujah. Or such a child would
[25:55] immediately put her out of her
[25:56] denomination.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; They had one like that in one of the
[26:00] churches. Why? They throw her out right
[26:02] quick.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU LET SUCH STUFF AS GO ALONG?
[26:05] NEXT, in paragraphs 132 and 133, Brother
[26:08] Ram said, "The church is pregnant with
[26:10] something, and she's bringing forth
[26:11] members all the time, but she doesn't
[26:14] want the scream and holler and blabber
[26:15] in Acts 2:38, miserable creatures that
[26:18] she thinks they are because they would
[26:20] embarrass her." But the true church
[26:22] loves that. Our church, any true church,
[26:25] loves when the young people scream,
[26:27] holler, blabber, receive the baptism of
[26:30] the Holy Ghost, whoop, cry, scream,
[26:32] shout, dance, speak in tongues, whatever
[26:33] they do. when they get born again. The
[26:35] true church loves that. Brother Ram
[26:37] said, "The church doesn't want to be
[26:38] pregnant with the word because that's
[26:41] the only kind of children the word can
[26:43] bring forth." Again, this is another
[26:45] memorable, powerful quote. There's only
[26:47] one kind of children the true church can
[26:49] bring forth. That's Acts 2:38. Young,
[26:51] screaming, crying, shouting, hollering,
[26:53] speaking in tongues, holy ghostfilled
[26:55] believers, born of the spirit of God.
[26:57] Brother Ram said it has the spirit of
[26:59] God in it. an old-fashioned sanctified,
[27:02] Holy Ghost-filled child screaming,
[27:04] hollering, shouting, praising God. Let's
[27:06] listen to the quote.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; You see, she's pregnantated with
[27:09] something
[27:11] &gt;&gt; because she's bringing forth members all
[27:12] the time,
[27:13] &gt;&gt; but she don't want them screaming,
[27:15] hollering, blabbering.
[27:18] Acts 2:38.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Miserable creatures that she thinks they
[27:21] are. It would certainly embarrass her.
[27:24] It would ruin her her educated ethical
[27:27] scientific society church that she
[27:29] belongs to throw her out at the next
[27:32] council.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; She can't have it. So she don't want to
[27:35] be pregnantated with THE WORD BECAUSE
[27:37] THAT'S THE ONLY KIND THAT THE WORD CAN
[27:39] BRING FORTH.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Lord of the spirit of God. It has the
[27:44] spirit of God in it.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; No intellectual church joined CREEP
[27:48] GOING BOBBED HAIR PAINTED FACE. There's
[27:51] no such a thing as THAT IN ALL. YOU
[27:53] DON'T FIND THAT IN the word of God.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; You find an oldfashioned sanctified Holy
[27:58] Ghost fililled child born of the spirit
[28:01] of God screaming, hollering, shouting,
[28:03] praising God.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 134 135. Brother Ram said the
[28:08] Jezebel society calls these painted face
[28:12] shortwearing women cats. He said, I
[28:15] think they call it cats. She claims
[28:17] she's married to the second Adam, but
[28:19] brother said she's married to the first
[28:21] Adam, the world. Let's listen to the
[28:23] quote.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; That's all together out of the reaches
[28:26] for her. She don't want that. Oh no,
[28:29] sir. No, indeed.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; What does she do that? So, she brings
[28:32] forth a pair of painted face
[28:34] shortwearing
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Jezy Bell Society illegitimate cats they
[28:39] call them, I think.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; I think they call it cats. Look at that
[28:46] cat going there. They say or something
[28:47] like that. You know,
[28:49] she was born or married or connected
[28:52] with her first husband, the first Adam
[28:55] by the adulterous wife of Eve. Adam's
[28:58] first wife. You say adulterous? She sure
[29:00] was.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; But oh, she claims that this Adam, this
[29:05] first Adam's dead. Oh, sure. He died a
[29:09] long time ago. I'm reborn again, she
[29:11] says. and I'm certainly married to THE
[29:13] SECOND ADAM, CHRIST THE WORD.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; In paragraphs 136 through 138, Brother
[29:19] Ram said, "Watch what the modern church
[29:21] loves. You'll see who she's in love
[29:23] with. She's in love with the church and
[29:26] not the word." Her own fruits prove what
[29:29] she is. She claims she's born the second
[29:32] time to Christ, but her lover is Adam
[29:34] because she loves the world. Bill Ram
[29:37] said, "If the church brings forth a
[29:38] child of the second Adam, he acts the
[29:40] second Adam's way of acting like they
[29:42] did on the day of Pentecost." That's the
[29:44] really true second Adam's children. So,
[29:46] I love that brother Ram always takes the
[29:48] baptism of Holy Ghost back to the day of
[29:50] Pentecost. That goes along with the thus
[29:52] sayith the Lord quote from the church
[29:54] age book where brother Brandham said,
[29:55] "Thus sayith the Lord, the fullness of
[29:57] Pentecost will be in the bride of Jesus
[30:00] Christ before the rapture." And that's
[30:02] the truth. The true bride of Christ has
[30:04] to go back to Pentecost in order to go
[30:06] up in the rapture. We got to go back
[30:08] then we go up. Brother Ram says the
[30:11] worldly church has painted face, bobbed
[30:14] hair, women wearing men's clothes and
[30:17] trousers. It's a shame for her to do
[30:19] that. Brother Ram said that's what the
[30:21] word says. I'm only pointing out nature.
[30:24] Let's listen to the quote.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; Huh? Notice what she loves. Watch her
[30:29] lover. You don't see who she's in love
[30:31] with. The word says this, but she said,
[30:33] "My church says this." Then who she in
[30:35] love with?
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Who is her husband?
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Her own fruits prove what she is.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. Shows what she is.
[30:46] Notice she was born first to Adam
[30:49] because that's her natural birth. See,
[30:51] and she never left that. That's a lover
[30:53] of the world. She claims that she's born
[30:55] the second time to Christ. But her
[30:57] lover, notice, is Adam yet because she
[31:00] loves the world.
[31:02] AND ANOTHER ANOTHER THING, NOTICE WHAT
[31:04] KIND OF CHILDREN SHE'S BEARING.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; That tells what their papa is.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Was first Adam or second Adam.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; If the church brings forth a child of
[31:16] the second Adam, he acts the second
[31:18] Adam's way of act like he did on the day
[31:19] of Pentecost. That's the real true
[31:21] second Adam's children. See, that's
[31:23] right. Their nature is like his and
[31:26] hers. Yes, sir. her daughter's painted
[31:30] face, bobbed hair, wearing man's
[31:31] clothes, trousers. The Bible said for
[31:33] her not to do it. She cuts her hair.
[31:35] It's a shame to her. You say, "Shut up
[31:36] on that." That's what the word says.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; I'm only pointing out nature.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; That's what she does.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; And the last quotes from paragraph 139
[31:46] through 141. Brother Ram said, "God
[31:49] never did organize a denomination. He's
[31:51] always been against it. His words
[31:52] against it." So the modern church that's
[31:54] organized is against the word of God and
[31:57] is just as illegitimate as Cain was.
[32:00] Let's listen to the quote. Her sons, her
[32:02] sons born out of her rely upon
[32:05] education, schooling, some Bible school
[32:07] socalled, some great college supposed to
[32:09] be a long time ago, had some out some
[32:12] sort of an incabator style.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Denominational seekers, religious
[32:16] king-like, just illegitimate to the word
[32:18] as Cain was,
[32:22] &gt;&gt; just as ill illegitimate as Cain was.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Denominational seekers, you see what it
[32:28] is? God never did organize a
[32:30] denomination. He's always been against
[32:32] it and rose against it.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; But they hold right on to it. So you see
[32:36] what they're bringing forth. That shows
[32:37] who their papa and mama is. Exactly.
[32:40] It's exactly just as illegitimate as
[32:42] Cain was. That's kind of a child he
[32:44] brought forth from Eve that got away
[32:46] from the word. Then you see what she
[32:47] brought. That's just exactly what the
[32:49] church has brought. The same thing.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; In closing, friends, hope this video was
[32:53] a blessing by the grace of God. But
[32:54] again, it raises our faith that we who
[32:56] believe were baptized with the Holy
[32:58] Ghost and are born again love godly
[33:00] Christian motherhood. We love the
[33:02] baptism of Holy Ghost as well. So we
[33:04] love spiritual parenthood and natural
[33:07] parenthood because that's what God
[33:09] loves. Jesus Christ is the same
[33:11] yesterday, today, and forever. So Jesus
[33:14] Christ loved parenting, fatherhood,
[33:16] motherhood. Remember Jesus had at least
[33:19] seven siblings in his family. You find
[33:20] that in the Gospels. I recently showed
[33:23] that to some saints by the grace of God
[33:26] in Matthew 13:55 and 56. Jesus was the
[33:30] oldest child and then there was James
[33:32] and Joseph, Simon and Judas. Right?
[33:35] There's five. And then sisters, so at
[33:38] least two sisters, five, six, seven. So
[33:40] there was at least seven children in
[33:42] Jesus's family. So God sent Jesus into a
[33:46] large family by the grace of God. God
[33:48] loves family. God loves fatherhood and
[33:50] motherhood because that's what God is.
[33:52] God is a father. So friends, let's fall
[33:55] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost.
[33:56] It'll point us back to the word of God.
[33:58] We'll continue to have large families.
[34:00] We'll wait for the coming of the Lord or
[34:02] we'll have as many children as God
[34:03] ordained us to have. We'll obey the word
[34:06] of God. We won't fall under the
[34:08] pre-tribulation anointing. And if we do
[34:10] that, if we fall under the real
[34:11] anointing of the Holy Ghost, we'll be
[34:13] the elect lady, not the cat lady.
[34:16] Scripture calls the bride of Jesus
[34:17] Christ the elect lady. Let's be that
[34:19] elect lady, that holy ghost filled
[34:21] woman. And let's bring forth Acts 2:38
[34:24] young and screaming, shouting, praising
[34:26] God. That's the only kind the word can
[34:28] produce.
[34:30] If you have any questions, [music]
[34:31] concerns, or testimonies about this
[34:32] video, please contact me.
[34:35] God bless you and may Jesus [music]
[34:37] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[34:41] I'm very happy to be here this afternoon
[34:42] and again in defense of the gospel of
[34:45] Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings,
[34:48] the good news that Jesus raised from the
[34:50] dead, living among man today, his
[34:52] church. The same Jesus that was
[34:55] yesterday will be today and forever.
[34:59] He has never failed.
