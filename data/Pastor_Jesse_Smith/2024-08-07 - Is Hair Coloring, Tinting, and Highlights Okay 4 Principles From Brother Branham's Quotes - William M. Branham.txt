TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I can't say for women about that putting color in their hair I have no scripture about against that I can only stay with the scripture are you ready and to you on the tape here it is sisters if there is a questioning it don't do it greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this vide is to answer a viewer's question about is it wrong to color one's hair this is a great question about modesty and Holiness that's a topic I've written a book about by God's grace and this topic in particular I did not mentioned in my 2019 book restoring Christian modesty so I want to make this video here by God's grace as a help to others hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of Jesus Christ that the Lord Jesus revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William brandham 190 9 to 1965 also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so as a brief answer to the question there are cases where it's okay for a woman or man to color their hair I would think in most cases men wouldn't want to color their hair but I guess there could be some cases a man might want to I can't think of one but I just want to be humble and leave that open but the most cases it seems there are women who want to color their hair so it seems the case where it would be okay for woman to color her hair is if her hair got gray due to age and she wanted to color it back to its original color as far as I know that would be the only reason a woman would want to color her hair and before we get started on a personal note uh my wife and daughters do not color their hair my wife still has most of her original hair color and she doesn't feel led to color it to hide the very few gray hairs she does have and all my daughters are quite young I would not let them put highlights in their hair to color their hair that's my personal preference I do not believe highlights are natural in most cases so in my family highlights would not be natural so I would not let my young teenage or adult daughters put highlights in their hair and I'd also recommend my wife would not put highlights in her hair of course she's never asked that she's never desired that I'm just letting you know my standards as a pastor and a minister of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ so let's look at the question here from the brother says please what is your understanding of hair coloring based on the bible message and history thank you in advance for your feedback Shalom so the Bible regarding the Bible and hair coloring I cannot find any direct mentions of hair coloring in the Bible I could be wrong so if I'm missing something please let me know we're simply told from the scripture in the New Testament that women should not cut their hair that's 1 Corinthians 11 1-16 I have two videos on this topic so I will leave links to them in the description and also the Bible tells us women should not pay for very expensive hairstyles I have a video on that as well these are the scriptures from Paul and Peter that talk about broided hair if you watch the video you'll see there's nothing wrong with braiding hair those scriptures refer to expensive hairstyles just like it refers to expensive jewelry so those are the two main principles we have about women's hair women's hair should not be cut and women should not pay large amounts some money for worldly hairstyles now regarding history I only did a very quick search because really the Bible is what matters most to me and I'm on limited amounts of time here I only found one site it said the Egyptians were the first to color their hair and notice it was Egyptians they were the enemies of God in most cases God's people the Hebrews were not the ones that were coloring their hair and according to this website that was about 1500 BC the website also says around 300 BC in the Roman Empire prostitutes were required to have different hair colors to indicate their profession some Warriors apparently colored their hair in order to intimidate opponents on the battlefield around 300 BC then it seems nothing really changed until the 1800s when hair dye was discovered apparently by a chemist named William Perkin and then it was in the 20th century when modern hair coloring originated Hollywood took it and ran with it of course they encouraged bob hair as well next we want to look at quotes from God's Prophet brother William brandham uh William brandham said in a summary he said there's no Bible that forbids hair coloring and he offered his advice to those who followed his bible-based teachings I compiled four principles to keep in mind so I find these four principles in brother ROM's quotes and I may be missing some quotes as well so please let me know if I missed any quotes about hair coloring the first principle is from the first quote the first quote is from questions and answers part one 1964 and in this quote we're actually going to get the first two principles the first principle is freedom brother random said women want to look pretty it's their nature so there's freedom in this area but there's also responsibility so that's the first point women do have freedom to color their hair as long as it's for the right reasons uh but then the second Point brother brand makes is he defines real Beauty and real beauty is found in 1 Peter 3: 3-6 it's the meek quiet and gentle spirit so I'm going to read those scriptures now before I play the quote whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plating the hair so plating the hair was the expensive hairstyle and of wearing of gold that's where we see expensive jewelry or a putting on apparel all women must put on apparel so this must refer to expensive apparel Let It Be The Hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God great price so now we'll play the quote it's quite a long quote again brother Rams asked directly about this questions answers part one let's listen to the quote if it is wrong for me to is it wrong for me to run a a beauty shop I'm a beautician and don't believe in Christians cutting her hair but I cut others and I guess it's t NT tent that means the color I guess is it color also sister dear I would I wouldn't know what to tell you listen I can't say for women about that putting color in their hair I have no scripture against that I can only stay with the scripture see the scripture don't say for them not to do that the scripture says she must have long hair that's right and after that I don't know where to go see I I don't know nothing about that now a little Minister that's present year somewhere I know a dear friend of mine we was talking together the other day at the blueb when we was having dinner he said my wife's kind of shamed to come before you very saintly Godly little woman and she's a a pretty little lady grandmother and but she's a nice clean real my wife's just crazy about this woman and um and uh I think she's a real real woman she I don't know if she's sitting here I guess she is I think her husband's here and he said to me said she let her hair grow out actually she heard you preach and she seemed it was right but said she's been using some color in her hair and she's trying her best get all that color grow out before she comes around where you are I look sister dear I highly respect that I have an honor for a woman that'll do that for some woman just to come up and do her hair anyway or spit on your feet and walk around irant no respects at all remember Jesus said what you do to these you've done it to me am see and I respect that you and God will bless you for that but sister about the hair color or something like that I I don't know I I can't back that up with the scripture so I that's just up to you you see you if you want to do it that's perfectly all right with me as far as I know a church has no such Customs if you want anything that's not in this Bible Well you just that's up to you you see but I just give you my advice you see as far as I would know you know it's just the nature of a woman to want to look pretty she's supposed to be that way you know in every life there is the male is the prettiest but the human race take any bird cow take a bunch of cattle which is the prettiest like old crumpled horn cow or the big bull take a deer which is the Little D or the buck take a bunch of elk which is the prettiest the male or female moose whatever you want to do take it take it in the bird taking the chicken the rooster or the hen take it the bird the little big pretty cardinal are the Little Speckled H sat on their nest and raise their eggs see everything in the whole race always the the male is the prettiest but the female to the human why she callused the fall amen Satan chose her right there and beauty is of the devil am Satan was the most beautiful angel he was a cheran that overshadowed look how the difference women is getting out of what they used to be how many remembers Pearl reading of pearl Bryant let's see your hand some of you older people sure see supposed to be the most beautiful woman in America any little teenage snickle Fritz on the street would be twice as pretty as she now why that's just exactly what the Bible said when the sons of God saw the daughters of man were fair that is a bunch of Renegades that sent that flood upon the Earth that God destroyed the whole human race see so exactly and today everything's paced upon Hollywood and and beauty and things like that when beauty is the secret thing of the heart not the outward appearance let them Adorn themselves not with outward appearance but inward of Meek Gentle Spirit that's that's a Christian so now on your question sister I don't know just what to tell you next let's look at a second quote and in the second quote we get the third principle the third principle is avoid hair coloring if there's any question or doubt about it and then brother gives us a warning scripture it's Isaiah 3:16 through 26 this is the scripture about the hottie Daughters of Zion and their 21 external accessories that they wore in in their pride and remember in Isaiah 4 God judged them and God took away all their outward beauty of course it was so-called Beauty it wasn't the true beauty that God gives a woman to be modest and holy so now we have three principles women do have some freedom but it's with responsibility they must remember what true beauty is a Meek and quiet spirit and not outward adorning and third if there's any question avoid it so let's listen to this quote it's from questions answers part 2 64 let's listen to the quote I believe this morning the question come up about um uh uh painting the hair you know with a with a color now I I if I I can't say anything about that I don't know but I I I have no scripture to say not to to color your hair that's that's all you women you like to look nice and you should look nice and brother bram's not against you children you're my children I I I love you and I I don't want to be balling you out I I wouldn't do it for nothing I'm only trying to help you but now look let me just ask let me say this and answer to that question are you ready and to you on the tape here it is sisters if there is a question in it don't do it but if you're if you're filled with God's spirit and led to go do it as long as it don't interfere with the scripture and don't interfere with a question you're perfectly satisfied that that's the will of the Lord then go ahead and do it see because there's no scripture to say no see about it I don't don't say nothing like that in the Bible I know Isaiah 5 I believe it just talk about women how they would wear changeable apparel and everything like that but that was pride and stuff hold on if you do that for Pride then it's wrong see examine your heart before God if there's no scripture for in the way the spirit leads you you go ahead and do it but now when it comes to whether you should have long hair or short hair you have long hair that's Survival here's my third and final quote I'm going to use and we get the four principle the fourth principle is use human color hair and you want to avoid non-human colors like blue pink purple and I'm using a quote from brother Brandon where brother br's talking about how makeup uses a lot of inhuman colors or nonhuman colors because those colors are not human which means they're beastly they're against God's creative nature they're against God's created pattern so this quote's from 1961 remember Ram's talking about makeup but let's apply this to hair as well we know God is against all makeup there's four or five verses that condemn makeup wearing and also prideful looks but here we have this principle that makeup wearing is not humanlike it's not natural it's unnatural so let's apply that to the hair color that's why I say I would not allow my family and also teach our church our sisters not to put highlights in their hair cuz that's usually not a natural thing let's listen to the quote Be not Afraid night 1861 and I thought I wonder if that's some kind of a manicure they're putting on their eyes you know uh and they make and then I I asked somebody else and they said yes that's that's um uh something um that they put on their face and I when I come home I told my wife about it I said honey that they didn't even look human see it it looked like something had come off of some other planet or fell out of the Marg somewhere or something I said I never seen something and today we was up there and there said a lady like that and and mey looked around my wife and she said is that it Bill I said that's it she said boy wouldn't that scare you in the night time I said he give you he give you chills and fever sure would in closing friends hope this video was a help by the grace of God this is an excellent question dealing with modesty Holiness and outward appearance as a message Pastor I don't get out very much I don't get many invitations which is totally fine I'm God gave me an invitation to be the pastor at our church here in aaran so I'm very thankful for that but I have had a few interactions about this topic the only sister I ever saw purposely put highlights in her hair for fashion her family became very worldly and all of her children are very worldly uh her daughters crossdress they wear pants they cut their hair they wear really light makeup and try to hide it from people and even that woman's husband the woman who has the highlights he told me he could handle having a TV in his house and he would watch college football games and who knows what else he watched but I just look at the crup fruits of this woman with her highlights in her hair and then the crup fruits from her family and Jesus said a tree is known by its fruits so friends as Christians we just want to stay as far away from sin and Temptation and worldly Temptations as possible we're thankful God's Prophet gave us his best advice we have those four principles let's use them by the grace of God if I miss something let me know but let's continue to Adorn our elves with that which is of a great price in the sight of God the humility of the Holy Spirit the meek and quiet spirit for our sisters and a humble prayerful gentle loving Spirit from our brothers if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
