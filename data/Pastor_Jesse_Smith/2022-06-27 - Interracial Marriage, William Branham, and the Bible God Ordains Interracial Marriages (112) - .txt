Description:
The Bible plainly teaches God ordains interracial marriage between believers, with at least 5 Old Testament examples, and Timothy as a New Testament example. 

It seems God's prophet, William Branham, was against interracial marriage for at least two reasons: (1) it was illegal at the time, and (2) the Civil Rights Era was a violent, tumultuous time.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the name above all names the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to teach the bible truth about interracial marriage which is that god allows and accepts interracial marriage when he ordains it among two believers like he did with moses and zipporah and the second purpose of this video is to understand why god's prophet william branham was against interracial marriage it seems from my observations that brother branham was against interracial marriage for two reasons first because it was illegal in the united states in his lifetime but became legal in 1967 and second because the era of the civil rights movement was a violent and tumultuous time to live in here's the outline for the video first we'll look at how we must recognize opinions of brother branham second we'll look at bible doctrine about interracial marriage third we'll look at positive things brother ram said about moses and zipporah fourth we'll look at negative things brother branham said about interracial marriage and the cultural context fifth we'll look at answers to questions about interracial marriage and sixth we'll look at a few inconsistencies among some message believers before starting the first section i want to thank message minister jason demars for his video about this topic which was a great help to me as i prepared this video also i wanted to say if you want to listen to two sermons i preached on this subject you can find them on the bride of christ fellowship akron youtube channel they were preached on june 19th and june 22nd 2022 respectively we must recognize opinions of brother branham friends we must recognize the human opinions of brother branham are not absolute truths as numerous videos of mine from the past have shown brother adam clearly taught his followers to be careful and discern between his human side his opinions that could be altogether wrong and the divine side or the prophetic gift which would be accompanied with thus saith the lord as he said in the sermon he cares to ucare 1963. brother branham repeatedly said he was not infallible brother branham said the tapes had mix-ups and he made mistakes like saying 700 did not buy the need to bail instead of 7000 all the time and just so you know i won't be playing all these quotes from brother branham because i put them in many of my videos from the past but if you need those quotes let me know i'll be happy to share them with you and i also want to conserve time in this video those who make brother branham and his tapes infallible are either one not saved and thus have a reprobate mind and worship the deity or idolatry spirit or two they are saved but not born again since they're not being led into all truth by the holy ghost as jesus promised and they also have very little discernment to judge between truth and error this would also mean these saved ones have a sinful complex of pridefully exalting brother branham and his tapes the third option is they could be born again but they have this one awful sinful mental complex of exalting the tapes to infallibility which is possible according to scripture as peter had an awful complex against eating with gentiles and would not do it as recorded in galatians 2 verses 11 to 15 which paul rebuked him for having regarding this sinful complex of making the tapes infallible this complex causes people to be either under a delusional spirit or a lying spirit because they're not doing what the bible and brother branham said to do and those two things are first proving all things by the scripture and second making all doctrine run from genesis to revelation friends we must prove all things by the scripture and scripture does not forbid interracial marriages when both persons are believers in the one true god jehovah who we also know as the lord jesus christ because jehovah of the old is jesus christ of the new testament second brother branham said all doctrine should be taught from genesis to revelation and there is not a doctrine banning interracial marriages taught from genesis to revelation the truth that doctrine must run from genesis to revelation is found in isaiah 28 verses 9 and 10. god said in order to understand doctrine he said precept must be upon precept line upon line here a little there a little those who make every word on tape infallible are contradicting themselves and brother branham and creating a state of confusion and god is not the author of confusion this is true because numerous quotes from brother branham specifically say his words were not thus saith the lord and yet message believers will say every word was thus saith the lord completely contradicting brother branham and yet they say they believe every word brother branham said was thus saith the lord again proving they are delusional or insane or just liars here's a few examples regarding the 1977 prediction brother banner said quote which i don't say the lord told me this end quote in 1951 the sermon the angel lord brother brahm said quote now this is not the lord speaking this is your brother brother branham end quote regarding marriage and divorce in 1964 brother ram said quote let me say this not the lord let me say it end quote and then picking him up a little later in the paragraph quote now remember this is me not the lord see end quote next let's recognize two major observations regarding the quotes that show brother branham was against interracial marriage and again i believe brother ram's stance against interracial marriage was his opinion only and not a bible doctrine the first observation is brother ram never said thus say the lord interracial marriage is wrong now some may say brother branham sounded very serious and stern about this subject that may be true but emotion and zeal and seriousness does not always mean god was speaking through brother branham i have two examples about this regarding the 1977 prediction when brother branham was teaching on it in the 70th week of daniel he got so excited he was shouting and singing he even broke into the song oh we're watching for the coming of that glad millennial day when our blessed lord shall come and catch his wading right away of course we know the world did not come into total annihilation by 1977. a second example is brother rand's prediction that martin luther king jr would lead millions into a hitler-like death trap and brother branham said this in the sermon the third exodus from june 1963. brother iran was so serious and stern about this prediction that he said quote and remember i'm on tape end quote and then of course a month later in the sermon he cares do you care brother branham was asked if this was a prophecy or not and that is when he said no he said i have nothing on it from the lord it's just my opinion he said i could be altogether a wrong in my opinion about martin luther king jr and the second major observation is that brother branham rarely if ever used scripture to teach interracial marriage was wrong and of course i'm open to correction i'm going to go over brother ramsey's quotes against interracial marriage later in the video and if you see definite scriptures and those quotes that i'm missing please let me know i believe brother brown was so stern in his stance against interracial marriage because of two facts first interracial marriage was illegal in the united states until 1967 and second the civil rights movement was a time filled with extreme violence against blacks and also some interracial couples to prove the first point that brother brown was a law-abiding citizen and therefore would be against interracial marriage because it was illegal let's listen to this quote from the sermon life 1962 in the quote you'll hear brother branham say i abide by the laws and before we listen notice that brother branham never says the lord told him to say this or it was thus saith the lord so we know it wasn't that it wasn't thus saith the lord in this quote brother branham says you ought to leave it the way god made it and i believe that's his opinion because should moses and zipporah have not married and instead stayed the way god made them one hebrew and one ethiopian the answer is no moses and zipporah should have married because it was god who chose them to be married and brother branham himself said that brother ram said god chose zipporah for moses as we'll show later in this video and there one day we find out that even miriam a prophetess and aaron the high priest made fun of moses why because she was an ethiopian and felt wasn't enough women of our own a group to marry instead of going down there and marrying that woman that wasn't moses choice that was god's choice for moses and also recall how god rebuked miriam and aaron for speaking against moses marriage to zipporah the ethiopian but now let's listen to the life quote where brother ram said he wanted to abide by the laws against interracial marriage let's listen to the quote i said it's not for me to say the boss government said let it be what it is permit them to marry and so forth i said that's that's up to them as an american i i abide by the laws to me don't leave it the way god had it later in this video i'll show how the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s was a time filled with extreme violence against some blacks and some interracial couples before moving to the next section i want to clearly state that i believe everyone corrects brother branham whether they admit it or not and if they say they don't correct brother branham then they're either honestly ignorant of many of brother band's quotes because of all the changes in brother bam's opinions or slips of tongue and other human mistakes or they're possessed with a lying spirit or delusional spirit or we'd also say a reprobate mind now friends the reason i can be so stern with that statement that some people are possessed with a delusional spirit is because i have a running list of over 50 human opinions and mistakes brother branham made which lord willing i might make a video about later or a podcast and i don't compile this list to discredit brother branham because i believe brother branham was a true prophet of god but i compiled this list to show brother branham had human opinions that were not infallible and this agrees with what brother branham said he wasn't infallible he had human opinions that were not god's opinions and this list also shows the wicked spirit of idolatry that is upon many people who claim to believe brother branham but in reality they do not believe him and what's worse is they don't believe the bible i'm going to name some of these 50 plus human opinions of brother branham just so you have an idea of what i'm talking about first example is the martin luther king jr death trap we just mentioned which brother banner said was his opinion the 1977 prediction of total annihilation in the united states his son joseph branham as a prophet but yet he said that's my prayer anyhow brother graham's prayer for billy paul to be a full prophet but later said he wasn't called to be a minister brother brown's desire for rebecca his daughter to take his place brother ram statement that there can't be another generation in arizona due to the high birth rates of children with mental retardation brother branham's opinion that matthew 24 would be fulfilled in his generation which would mean a return of god to the jews and an ushering end of the tribulation period brother branham's agreement with a woman's dream that he'd be killed by gunshot by the false church as he was going into a meeting brother branham's opinion that billy paul was the promised joseph brother random statement that the third person of the trinity burned in his heart and he loved the third person of the trinity brother branham's teaching that the promised land typed the millennium brother brandon's statement that the human body is made up of 80 percent water and petroleum brother branham's statement that christ died a sinner brother random statement that elisha was on mount transfiguration brother random statement that rebecca met her bride brother random statement that the rapture was in second thessalonians chapter four but there is no second thessalonians chapter four and lastly brother random statement that jesus never said to go and teach the gospel but yet jesus said that in matthew 28 verse 19. friends i have and i will continue to pray for those who are either willingly or ignorantly exalting the tapes of brother branham sometimes it's very frustrating for me because i'll interact with these kind of people online or in letters and they will not directly answer my simple questions and they'll often call me names and speak evil words but i recognize that's just the evil spirit that's upon him and i know i must love my enemies and bless them who persecute me as the lord jesus christ commanded now we'll move on to the next section and we will do what the bible and brother branham said we will see that the doctrine of interracial marriage runs in continuity from genesis to revelation bible doctrine about interracial marriage the exact words interracial marriage are not in the king james version bible the word race is used four times in the king james but it's not used for any ethnic group it's a word used only for running competitions instead the word nations is used such as in the case of deuteronomy 7 1-6 and joshua 23 12-13 and you will find god forbid the jews to marry among different nations because of their idolatry and the fact that their unbelieving spouse would turn them away from following jehovah the one true god notice specifically in these verses from deuteronomy 7 and joshua 23 these nations were also middle eastern nations meaning they had the same similar physical features as the israelites yet god still forbid their marriages this means god's focus was on the spiritual differences and not the physical differences some message people say you can only marry someone who looks like you but god said don't marry the neighboring nations that look like you due to spiritual reasons not physical reasons the bible is clear that there are only three requirements for marriage and recall that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever first for both the old testament and new testament believer they had to marry a believer not an unbeliever for the new testament believer this is found in first corinthians 7 39 and for the old testament believer that's found in deuteronomy 7 1-6 and again joshua 23 verses 12 and 13. also here's a quote from brother branham where he said no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances should always marry believers and of course this lines up with the scripture let's listen to the quote and then it among is own people he went over and married a sinner an idolater worship of idols he married jezebel and she was not a believer and no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances should always marry believers the second requirement for the new testament believer is the believer can have no living spouse or else it's adultery according to matthew 5 32 now in the old testament it was different israel could have divorces and remarry even if they had a living spouse and jesus said that was because of the hardness of their hearts so the second requirement is different it only applies to us the new testament believers the third requirement applies both to old and new testament believers is the requirement for an honest vow which in the new testament means confessing any previous fornication before marriage as seen in matthew 5 32 and matthew 19 verse 9. in the old testament they also had to have a honest vow according to numbers chapter 30 verses 1 through 16. marriage within different nations or interracial marriage was possible in the old testament when the gentile spouse became a jew as a proselyte or through spiritual conversion we can see that god had plans for gentiles to come into the abrahamic covenant in genesis 17 verses 12 and 27 all the male gentiles had to be circumcised like the jews in order to come into the covenant and then numbers 19 verse 10 says any sojourner or stranger which would be a gentile that would come among the jews would have to be sprinkled with the waters of separation in order to be a worshiper so this spiritual conversion is called spiritual admission by brother branham in the church age book on page 227 he said ruth came in to the tribes of israel through spiritual admission it's noteworthy that the number of gentiles among the jews had increased from the days of abraham to solomon to the amount of 153 600 and that's according to second chronicles 2 verse 17. now let's look at five examples of godly marriages between different nations or nationalities and we could say these are five examples of interracial marriages amongst believers in the old testament and remember jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the first example is joseph and azenath from genesis 41 verse 45 joseph married a gentile and so his children were a half jew half gentile as brother branham said in the first seal so friends was this wrong for joseph to marry azenath or did god ordain this marriage it seems god ordained this marriage because joseph told his brothers you did not send me here to egypt god sent me here and as further proof god bless joseph's two sons put them among the 12 tribes of israel and then we learn in revelation 4 verse 4 that these two sons have two of the 24 seats that surround the throne of the lord jesus christ the second example is moses and zipporah moses of course was a hebrew and zipporah was an ethiopian in the hebrew lexicon ethiopian means from cush which is the southernmost people's located in africa it's the descendants of cush located around the southern parts of the nile near ethiopia numbers 12 verse 1 and 8 say that mirim and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he had married and of course if you know the story god did not like miriam and aaron speaking against moses and god said wherefore then were you not afraid to speak against my servant moses notice they were speaking against god's servant and his marriage to an ethiopian so i encourage everyone not to speak against a godly marriage that might be interracial because you'd be committing the same heir that miriam and aaron made and as you'll see later brother branham called zipporah a black woman said she was the only one that saved moses life and that god chose zipporah to be moses's wife therefore god chose believers from two different races to marry and he blessed their union the third example is rahab and salmon from the time of joshua both exodus 32 verses 11 12 and verses 16 and 17 and deuteronomy 7 1-6 specifically forbid marriage to a canaanite yet salmon married rahab who was a canaanite this was possible and acceptable to god because rahab became a believer in israel's god jehovah as proven by hebrews 11 31 so this leads us to understand that god's prohibition against interracial marriage was only due to spiritual differences and if someone of a different race converted or became a proselyte to judaism then the jew could marry that person from a different nation and then god would allow interracial marriage and of course the proof of god's blessing upon this interracial marriage was that rahab brought forth boaz who married ruth and they brought forth obed and then jesse and then david on down until jesus christ came out of their lineage a fourth example is boaz and ruth from the time of the judges notice deuteronomy 22 verses 3 through 6 says no moabite could enter into the congregation of the lord now friends are we to believe ruth could not enter into the congregation of the lord into the outer courts of the tabernacle of the lord or is it most likely ruth was allowed to worship jehovah through her conversion and through the waters of separation since out of her loins become david and eventually the messiah jesus christ recall matthew 1 verse 5 as both rahab and ruth are listed in matthew's genealogy of the lord jesus christ so god was not ashamed to put a canaanite and a moabite in the lineage of the messiah so this leads me to believe that god would allow a moabite to come into the congregation of the lord if they converted if they repented their sins and became a true follower of jehovah god so again remember the birth order rahab and salmon brought forth boaz boaz married mamobite ruth and they brought forth obed then jesse then david on down to the messiah jesus christ the fifth example is uriah the hittite and bathsheba both deuteronomy 7 verse 3 and exodus 34 11-17 forbid marriage to hittites yet bathsheba married uriah the hittite and he proved to be a mighty man in david's army with a great zeal for israel's god and israel's army this marriage could have only been possible through uriah's conversion to judaism now i want to look at an example from the new testament that shows god can save and fill a believer who is the result of an interracial marriage and the example is timothy according to philippians 2 verses 19 through 22 paul knew no one who had natural care for the philippian state like paul had paul said that timothy was as a son with the father with him so paul was like a father of the faith and timothy was like his son in the gospel paul plainly says no man was more like-minded to him than timothy so no one was more like the prophet of god than timothy according to acts 16 1-3 timothy was the offspring of a greek and jew timothy's dad was greek timothy's mother was jew so he was half jew half greek so this example again proves children who come from a mixed marriage are no different than any other children they can still be saved sanctified filled with the holy ghost they can be extremely spiritual they can be very like-minded compared to the prophet of god they can have the same faith and have the same mind as the prophet of god it's a mind that loves the lord jesus christ i want to look at five other important verses the first one is acts 17 verse 26 the bible said god made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth so we're taught by the bible there's one blood of people upon the earth which proves interracial marriages are not hybrid in the sense of mixing different seeds for all human blood is the same blood and all human seed is the same seed because interracial couples can reproduce and have more children second the new testament king james version bible puts no difference between races as there's no difference between the jew and the gentile and we are all abraham's spiritual seed that's according to romans 10 verses 12 and 13 and galatians 3 verses 26 through 29 what matters now is that we are a spiritual nation that's according to first peter 2 verse 9 which says but ye are chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation third according to romans 2 verse 16 god will judge the secrets of all men's hearts by jesus christ according to paul's gospels notice we won't be judged by every word on brother branham's tapes especially since brother ram said there were mix up on the tapes since paul never commanded a ban on interracial marriages then there is no ban on interracial marriages and since paul's gospel cannot be changed it cannot be added to or taken away as brother random said and as brother ram quoted in galatians chapter 1 verses 6 through 12 we cannot add a ban on interracial marriage to the new testament remember the church age book chapter three brother brahm said one of these days there's going to come a prophet to the later scene church age and you will know if he's the real one sent from god or not yes you will for if he is of god he will be in that word exactly as god gave it to paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota then brother ram said get back to the word or you are lost he won't build on a private revelation or interpretation but on the word so friends if you just look in the word of god if you look at paul's gospels even you'll never see a ban on interracial marriage you only see bans against marrying an unbeliever you see a ban against marrying a second spouse when you already have a living spouse and you see a ban against dishonest vows but you never see a ban against interracial marriages in the old testament or the new testament as long as both believers were just that believers before scripture is that i can only find one mention of skin color in the bible and that's in song of solomon now there could be more and if i'm not aware of them let me know it's in song of psalm 1 verses 5 and 6. of course this is the shulamite who was courted and then engaged and then married to solomon in verse 5 she said i am black but calmly verse 6 says look not upon me because i am black and she tells the reason why her skin was darker it was because her family forced her to work outside in the hot skin tanning sun so we know from the context that royalty probably didn't work outside they were so rich and more powerful so they never had to work outside in the hot sun so their skin would be lighter toned than just the common people or the laborers now the fact that this is the only mention of skin color proves again that god never had a ban on interracial marriages because of skin color the fifth scripture is in revelation 5 verses 9 and 10 and this scripture shows that despite the fact that there are some interracial marriages amongst believers god will still have redeemed believers from every kindred tongue people and nation now this scripture proves the majority of married believers will marry within their nations because that's where they live and remain and it's more likely they're going to marry someone that they have interaction with in their own nation but not all believers are required to marry within their own nation because there's no scriptural command against interracial marriage from the lord jesus christ revelation 5 verse 9 says and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth as we close this section remember brother ram said he preached what paul preached and we were resting on that so friends we cannot rest on brother rams humans opinions we must rest upon the bible because the bibles are absolute and the bible is our one and only absolute there is only one absolute and the holy ghost will only point you to the word of god so our conclusion is if we do what brother branham and the bible taught us to do prove all things by the scripture we come to the conclusion that there are times when god chooses to put couples together from different nations or different races and i want to ask this question what if you never heard brother branham preach against interracial marriages and you knew only the bible teaching about interracial marriage what conclusion would you come to it's likely you come to the same conclusion that i just presented that god allows interracial marriage as long as between two believers as proven by the scriptures and also there's numerous people that i know including myself that were not raising the message and while growing up we knew there was nothing wrong with interracial marriage it was something to be celebrated just like any other marriage as long as the couple were genuine believers in jesus christ before we came to the message all we knew was the bible and we knew the bible taught that interracial marriage was acceptable like in the case of moses and zipporah so i hope you consider that perspective and i hope it helps you out by god's grace positive things brother brahms said about moses and zipporah so now we'll listen to five quotes from brother branham about moses and zipporah and it will show how god placed him together and remember friends according to hebrews 13 verse 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever god will always bless interracial marriages as long as he leads them together and of course that applies to any marriage whether interracial or not in this first quote brother ram said zappora was the only one that saved moses physical life so consider that god chose zipporah an ethiopian because he knew she would save his life let's listen to the quote the questioner asked does this scripture mean that god aimed to kill moses are his son and why god was after moses and support was the only one that saved him there for sephora got a sharp rock and went and cut the foreskin over her baby and threw it before moses and said a bloody husband to me is that right and god would have talked his life but perhaps an angel was standing in her there catch it quickly see as the fourth one circumcised the baby said moses you're so concerned about everything else about your journey but your own boy hasn't been circumcised next brother ram said it was wrong for aaron and miriam to make fun of moses for marrying an ethiopian now in this quote friends brother branham will use the terminology colored girl now of course that's not politically correct today so i apologize if that offends anybody but that terminology was acceptable during brother graham's lifetime let's listen to the quote was made fun of my sister and his brother one time because he married a colored girl ethiopian girl it didn't make fun and god happened to be present and heard it was that right he just was present and heard it that's right and when he did he said bring him in here he said don't you fear god [Applause] the next quote brother bram said moses married a negro girl and again i'm sorry if the word negro offends anyone i know it's not politically correct but it's on tape and this was the language people used during brother graham's lifetime but again this shows brother branham said moses married a black woman let's listen to the when she quote because moses married this negro girl and said both of the other girls to be married and so forth he had done it and god wasn't pleased with that and smaller with an adversary in the next quote 1961 brother ram said god chose zipporah for moses and that god demands respects for his servants of course he talks about how aaron and miriam disrespected moses due to his marriage so may god help us all to respect the marriages that god brings together whether interracial or not let's listen to the quote and there one day we find out that even miriam a and aaron the high priest made fun of moses wife because she was an ethiopian i thought wasn't enough women of our own group to marry instead of going down there and marrying that woman that wasn't moses choice that was god's choice for moses and when they made fun of it that angered god in such a way until he struck miriam the prophecies full of leprosy moses own sister what about that her of confidence but what was she doing she was making fun and an irreverence to god's messenger the messenger of the covenant of that name in this last quote it doesn't mention moses and zipporah but brother and does say god breeds people together how he wants them so if god had foreknowledge about moses and zipporah god determined who their grandparents and parents would marry and then brought moses and the poor together to be married and have children according to the plan of god god wanted a certain testimony for moses and zipporah and so god does the same today god has certain testimonies for certain people and god can allow interracial marriages today for a specific testimony let's listen to the quote and in the millennium there's elohim sitting on the throne that's right with all his subjects around him and he predestinated before the foundation were like a man building chimes or making chimes the motor each bell's got to ring different from the other the same materials but so much iron so much uh steel so much brass to make it give the tang that's what god did he bred this one to that one to this one to that one to this one to that one till he got exactly what he wanted that's how it come down god will unveil himself in a pillar far down through the prophets and into the son of god which he was god it's the same god bringing out exactly from perfection to perfection from glory unto glory that's where the church goes negative things brother branham said about interracial marriage and the cultural context he lived in some wonder why brother brown was so strongly against interracial marriage and in my opinion it seems there were two factors first it was illegal in the united states until 1967 and history shows interracial couples could be arrested for being married and the second reason is the civil rights era from the 1940s to 1960s was often a violent hateful and tumultuous time to live in for some people i want to briefly look at the cultural context brother branham lived in and i'm going to reference an article from the history channel's website before reading some of these examples i want to let listeners know if you have children you may want them to step out of the room because some of these events from history are very violent and sad and graphic so in 1954 brown versus the board of education ended racial segregation in schools yet many schools remain segregated in 1955 an awful thing happened a black 14 year old was brutally murdered for allegedly flirting with the white woman and this brought international attention to the civil rights movement in 1955 rosa parks refused to give up her seat to a white man on a montgomery alabama bus that started a year-long bus boycott in 1957 president dwight eisenhower had to send federal troops to escort students into the little rock central high school in little rock arkansas also in 1957 president eisenhower signed the civil rights act of 1957 to help protect voter rights in 1960 sit-ins became popular as a non-violent form of protest in 1963 president jfk had to send in the national guard to the campus of the university of alabama to allow two black students to enter and register august 1963 was when martin luther king jr gave his i have a dream speech in front of the lincoln memorial in washington d.c sadly in september 63 a bomb at the 16th street baptist church in birmington alabama killed four young girls and injured several others this bombing fueled angry protests 1964 president johnson signed the civil rights act preventing employment discrimination due to race color sex religion or national origin in march 1965 bloody sunday took place when 600 civil rights marchers walked to selma alabama to montgomery in order to protest black voter suppression local police blocked and brutally attacked these marchers in 1968 martin luther king jr was assassinated on the balcony of his hotel room in memphis tennessee i want to reference a second article this article is from the life magazine 1963 which message believers will be very familiar with because of the because of the supernatural cloud from february 28 1963 in the magazine it seems there's a very biased article as the article makes blacks out to be a very hateful and aggressive group now of course we know this certainly was not the case because many of the protesters simply wanted justice for some of the murders that we mentioned earlier and of course there were numerous others many of the blacks just wanted equal treatment in the military when eating in public attending the same schools etc friends these are some of the saddest pictures i've seen it pains all of our hearts to see blacks so mistreated and again the reason i'm showing this is so you can understand the context in which brother ram lived and preached he saw so much violence and hatred and he knew the hatred and violence was inspired of the devil so he encouraged believers to marry within their own nationalities which was also a legal requirement at that time as well now we'll listen to portions of quotes from god's prophet brother branham again you'll hear brother branham call black people colored or negros and i'm sorry if that is offensive to anybody please know this language was commonly used in the civil rights era but is not politically correct language today you will hear brother branham say some very serious and harsh words about interracial marriage some of the serious words are when he says it's wrong which is true in one sense because it was illegal and he'll say it's not right which was technically true in the legal aspect of it but again these statements don't seem to agree with the scriptures also you're going to hear brother ram say some harsh words like he called interracial marriage horrible and he called it hybriding and he said it's ruining the race of people and it's against nature and it's one kind of evil going on in the world today i believe it's likely brother bran was so harsh against interracial marriage due to the violence he witnessed in both america and in africa that he talked about and he would read about the violence in newspapers as well this violence made brother branham speak harsh things against martin luther king jr and brother brandon thought he would lead millions into a hitler-like death trap because he thought it looked like a communist style takeover of the united states government but remember brother ram said he could be altogether wrong about martin luther king jr and had nothing on it from the lord i do want to play one quote from questions and answers 1964 where brother brandon made a great observation he noted how communists from the past and even fascists like hitler used racial wars or racial hatred in order to take over political power we can even see that today in the united states where one party the democratic party often uses attacks of racism against the republican party and so we see how government leaders use racism as a way to take more power from the people or keep power whenever there's a crisis or a tragedy sinful government leaders will use that crisis in order to grab more power so let's listen to the is it i'll quote you that it's communism and not them colored people that's how communism has always come in to take over they do that in every nation that's how they do it getting you fighting amongst one another revolution then they take can without a shop they don't want to blow this country up they want it they can warm wheat it in and now they see the case appearing out and know what the old revolution was and thought they started another revolution to prove my porn is clear after they have integration they have it now legally lawfully they're causing more trouble now than in the first place see it shows that it is communism and not them precious souls that's born of the spirit of god now we'll listen to numerous quotes from brother branham about interracial marriage how he's against it but pay attention to the amount of bible verses or bible references or bible quotes that he uses you'll hear there are very little scriptures referenced and this proves brother ram's stance against interracial marriage was most likely his opinion especially considering the five examples from interracial marriage in the old testament and also timothy's holy devotion to the prophet of god paul as a child of a mixed marriage in the first quote from condemnation by representation 1960 brother branham calls interracial marriage terrible and not right now again i would ask was it terrible that god allowed moses and zipporah to marry did god do a terrible thing when he let moses and zappora marry of course the answer is no brother branham also calls this interbreeding and asked how can the world go on much longer so it seems brother ran was burdened by all the racism and violence surrounding the civil rights movement let's listen to the quote [Music] i got hundreds of precious colored friends this born again christians but on this line of segregations and things we're talking about hybriding the people what tell me what fine custard fine christian colored woman want her baby to be on my ladder by white man what white woman would want her baby to be in my ladder by a colored man god means what i believe it's right what are we doing friends men think they know all about it but people would be a better off you just let them away there away god made them let the brown race marry the brown race the white race mirror the white race the dark race the yellow race and whatever more stay the way god made them if a vile god made it it was white let it remain white if it's blue black brown whatever the flower is let it alone if corn was raised a certain way yellow corn don't mix with white corn if you do you mix it up then it can't bring itself back again if a mew was or jack was a jack the jelly to begin with let him stay that way don't mention with horses you make a renegade hybrid oh it's such a curse go back to where god started let's go back to the beginning amen go back to where god brought us what we're supposed to be oh this inner breed how can the world go on my shoulder no wonder the vision of the lord says here that i've seen it finally come to a spot where she's just one big smoldering heap she's blown up we're on the road out friends there's no way no way there's no way around it we got to come to it face it the next quote is from 1961 here brother ram said racial disintegration is evil and he noticed all the fusses and fights and stews in the civil rights movement so i would humbly ask was it evil for moses and zipporah to marry of course the answer is no don't forget brother ram said god chose zepora from moses so god could not make an evil choice let's listen to the quote so when he began to read in the book and see that the time was drawing night at full faith [Applause] what are we doing when nations are praying let's see a lord man's heart failing for fear perplexed of time all these things are handwriting on the wall racial disintegration all kinds of evil going on in the world [Applause] that one little nation for the size of cuba down here can destroy the world in 10 minutes here in 1962 we'll again listen to the quote from life preached in salem oregon brother ram said you ought to leave it the way god had it he's a god of variety notice again no scripture and no thus saith the lord statement let's listen to the quote i'm a southerner the big boss up here says this nation what they say is all right i think in the segregation condition of the sound some of them said to me one time said brother brandon being a southerner what do you think about segregation i said it's not for me to say the boss government said let it be what it is permit them to marry and so forth i said that's that's up to them as an american i i abide by the laws to me or to leave it the way god had it he made a white man black man brown man he's a god of variety let him stay the way god made them that's what i think if i was a black man i want to i want to stay in my class of people uh chinese yellow i i won't stay that way then i'm anglo-saxon white let me marry amongst the white teach my children the same and this day they're kind of a flower and a color that god made us at the beginning after all he's the one that made it here in 1963 brother branham said we should never cross that up he said interracial marriages makes hybrid he says you're ruining the race of people now of course this is brother brown's opinion and we have to take that statement back to the bible and ask ourselves did moses ruin his race by marrying zipporah of course the answer is no let's listen to the quote i believe god is a god of well i'd say he's a god of variety he makes big mountains and little mountains he makes deserts he makes forest he makes white man black man red man we should never cross that up it becomes a hybrid and any hybrid cannot rebreed itself you're ruining the race of people here's another quote from 1963 brother bam says you get against nature if you interbreed he said don't cross them up so again if we take that back to the scripture did god go against himself when he put moses and zappora together did god interbreed and did god cross up moses and zipporah in order to get gershom and his brother i believe the answer is no let's listen to the quote but this man if i can only speak to him leading those precious people under the name of religion into a death trap where he's going to kill him thousands times thousands of them they don't they just get the natural sign this man the colored brother when that great uprise come in louisiana i was there at the time when the there's a colored minister precious old brother stood up out there and said uh asked the militia could i speak to they're my people and this old minister stood up right there said i want to say this morning i never was ashamed of my color my maker made me what i am that's what he wants if you remain that's what he wants every man to remain he makes white flowers and blue flowers and all colors of flowers don't interbreed them don't cross them up you get against nature in 1964 brother ram said i don't believe in it but again notice there's no scriptural reference there's no thus saith the lord he said i believe you should just stay what we are i don't believe in mixing marriages well that makes me ask should moses and zipporah remained unmarried should they have stayed just the way they were or did god want them to be married of course the answer is god wanted them to be married was it a mistake moses and zipporah were married or did god choose zipporah for moses as brother ram said in another quote the answer is it was not a mistake let's listen to the quote now i don't believe in mixing marriages i believe that a white man should not marry a colored girl or a colored girl marry a white man or a yellow marry a colored or a white or i believe the brown black white and races of people are like a flower garden of god and i do not believe they should be crossed up i believe that's the way god made them and i believe that's the way they should remain what it fools me and i've seen some real pretty colored girl intelligent nice looking kid just as pretty as any woman you want to see what does she want to marry a white man and have milan children what would an intelligent color girl want was such a thing as that it because that something a communist how would a a fine uh uh a colored man want to marry a white woman and have a lot of children i don't believe i believe you should stay just what we are but we we're servants of christ and god made me if he made me my color black i'd be happy to be a black man for god if he made me yellow i'll be a happy yellow man for christ if he made me uh white i will have a white man for christ if he may be brown or red an indian whatever it is i'd stay my same color that would be me i want to be like my maker made me the final quote is from 1965 brother ram says intermarrying was wrong so we must balance this quote and take it back to the word again brother adam gave no scripture and no thus saith the lord in this statement we have to ask ourselves was it wrong for moses to marry zipporah or joseph to marry azenath or timothy's mom to marry timothy's dad and of course the answer is no let's listen to the quote as uh i believe it's gestural told moses one time that it's just too much for you so we've got um plenty of brothers here on your problems and every one of them has been legitimate and there are fine things that has to be taken care of and i would recommend our pastor or brother man and other ministers of our faith here and you can go to them they tell you just exactly the thing to do some people their children intermarrying or things that's wrong and these men could help you just the same as as anyone else cause they're servants of christ and go to them and i'm sure they will they will give you the help that you need answers to questions about interracial marriage the first question is isn't moses and zipporah a type of christ and the church only and not an example of natural marriage i believe the answer to that is no and the reason is because we have four other examples from the old testament that i've already showed plus the example of timothy being half greek and half jew and yet being a real holy ghost-filled christian and again if you just read the bible without having heard brother rams preaching about interracial marriage you'd understand god had no prohibition against believers intermarrying within different nationalities a second question what about the attention that interracial marriages draw well my answer to that is that's just natural whenever someone's physically different or visibly different they draw attention from others and as a certainty anyone who's different is gonna receive extra attention moses's marriage drew attention from aaron and miriam but god stood with moses and so god will do the same for believers whenever they stand out just like when our sisters are the only women in the store or at a beach wearing modest clothes our sisters automatically stand out but god is standing with them the fact is most people marry within their own country or their own nation among people that look like them it's just simply probability that people will marry someone who looks a lot like them from their own nation but it's not a bible principle that intermarrying is wrong and for those people who are intermarried and get unwanted attention they have to remember that god brought them together and god will give them the perfect love that casts out all fear or all negative attention just like moses and zipporah if god helped them to overcome the criticism of miriam and aaron god will help today's couples that he leads to inner mary overcome the criticism that they live under i remember the words of jesus with god all things are possible you can also remember the words of paul i can do all things through christ who strengthens me if an interracial couple is being criticized then it's a opportunity for them to love their enemies and bless those who persecute them none of us enjoy being persecuted or being mistreated but it's going to happen in life especially as christians especially as we get closer to the coming of the lord right before the mark of the beast gets laid down when the beast system is going to want to kill all the christians who believe the truth of the gospel so may god help us all to have perfect love to cast out all fear question three are children affected when they are born from an interracial marriage i would say yes and some of the effects are positive and some of the facts are negative it can be positive when they come in contact with different cultural practices which the children easily adapt to and they also may enjoy such as differences in food personalities or family traditions the negative effect is when they come in contact with negative or hate-filled people so it's the duty of the parents to train their children to be prepared for criticism or unwanted attention by the leading of the holy spirit the parents can prepare their children to do as jesus said if someone curses them they can bless them in return they can also walk away from negative people and they can certainly pray for people who make fun of them or persecute them as a personal testimony when i was growing up i was darker skinned than most of the people in the farm community that i was raised in and so i was called at least two different racial slurs as half mexican and half english i was called the slang word for a mexican american i was also called the slang word for a black person so i was called the s word for mexican american and i was called the n word for a black person because i got so dark during the summer times and because of the name calling i would go home crying and it really hurt my feelings to be name called these slang terms but by god's grace my mom prayed with me i was able to learn to overcome the name calling and eventually thank god the name calling stopped after a few years and i remember the scripture from hebrews where the bible said god will never leave us nor forsake us so despite being mistreated i always knew that god was with me and god helped me to overcome all the evil treatment that i had to endure so i thank the lord for his grace upon my life question four why don't you just take a prophet's opinion about interracial marriage well first the bible doesn't tell us to take every prophet's personal opinions on every single matter the bible says in acts 17 verse 11 the bereans believed paul but they took everything paul said back to the scriptures to make sure everything he said was found in the bible they searched the scriptures daily whether these things were so so the bereans believed the prophet messenger for their age but still searched the scriptures regarding the things he said that's the same thing we do with brother branham and when i search the scriptures i find god bringing interracial couples together on at least six cases and think about this if believers would have been required down through the ages to believe everything a prophet said even their human opinions then everybody would have had to believe jacob the prophet when he thought joseph was dead but joseph wasn't dead joseph was alive in egypt also everyone would have had to believe nathan when he told david to do all that was in his heart and yet god corrected nathan on his human opinion so see friends there's no bible teaching that says believers should believe every single human opinion of the prophet of god second brother abraham specifically told us to be careful not to make his opinions divine statements especially in relation to martin luther king jr and the civil rights movement and third it is not healthy to take every opinion of any man over our own opinion if the bible says different than the preacher's opinion especially since brother bran told us to be very careful when listening to him to discern between the human and the divine side and brother man told us he was not infallible and he was subject to making mistakes and being wrong people that take brother branham's opinion over their own every single time is a dangerous movement towards cult-like behavior remember in cults you cannot question anything the leader says because cults essentially make their leader infallible it's wrong to make any leader infallible except the lord jesus christ now true prophets like brother ram can speak thus saith the lord and those thus say the lord's statements are infallible but not every word brother branham said on tape was infallible jesus christ promised the holy ghost would lead and guide us into all truth so the longer the holy ghost filled believers are here the more truth they will receive by revelation of the spirit the more discernment they'll have between brother brahms opinions and the divine statements that he stated with thus saith the lord inconsistencies among some message believers i only have two inconsistencies i've noticed amongst message believers the first is that message believers will contradict themselves by saying black can't marry white but then they'll let the brown marry white here's a quote from brother branham where he says the brown have to marry the brown the white have to marry the white the black have to marry the black let's listen to the quote the people would be a better offense god made them let the brown race marry the brown race the white race mere the white race the dark race the yellow race and whatever more stay the way god made them if apollo god made it it was white let it remain white if it's blue black brown whatever the flower is let it alone if corn was raised a certain way yellow corn don't mix with white corn if you do you mix it up then it can't breathe and set back again so friends despite this brother random quote some message churches will let brown marry white which shows their hypocrisy because they're picking and choosing which quotes they want to believe while ignoring others and then they'll hypocritically say i only say what the tapes say or they'll say you can't correct a prophet and yet they are correcting brother branham by ignoring his quotes that are against their own opinions the second inconsistency is related but some of these message people will ignore the zipporah and moses quotes and yet these people will constantly say say what the tapes say so it's hypocritical and inconsistent to say say what brother am's tapes say and then ignore the quotes that you don't agree with and of course there are many examples of this which lord willing in the future will address as i said earlier i already have over 52 proofs from brother rams tapes that not every word on tape is thus saith the lord in closing i hope this video has been a helpful video by the grace of god i know for some people this is a controversial subject but please consider all that the bible says and what brother branham said about these subjects remember the bibles are absolute brother adam came to point us back to the bible brother branham said malachi 4 5 and 6 would restore the apostolic doctrine to the saints there must for be thus saith the lord malachi the fourth chapter that's exactly what he said would be a sign just before the coming of the great and terrible day of the lord i'll send you elijah so when we read the old testament and new testament we can see how god allowed interracial marriage at times and god cannot change as malachi chapter 2 says for i am the lord thy god and i change not and of course we all know hebrews 13 verse 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
