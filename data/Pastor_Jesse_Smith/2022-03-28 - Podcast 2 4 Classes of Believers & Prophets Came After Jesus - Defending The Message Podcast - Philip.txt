TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] god bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith and here's our other co-host um i'm amen god bless you everyone we just want to thank you guys for coming and joining us today for our podcast today and we're here to defend the faith and defend the message today we're going to do two topics the first topic will be the four kinds of grounds from jesus's parable from matthew chapter 13 and our second topic will be the fact that more prophets were to come after jesus and before we get started lord willing in future podcasts will be covering topics and questions related to the two extremes around the bible-based message god gave to his prophet brother william branham one extreme falsely accuses and attacks brother branham calling him a false prophet in charlatan and the other extreme worships william branham by exalting his tapes to infallibility claiming every word he spoke on tape was thus say the lord which is heresy today though we're covering these two subjects jesus's foregrounds parable and the fact that prophets came after jesus as promised in our first podcast we're going to start with the foregrounds in jesus's parable of the four grounds found in matthew 13 verses 3 through 9 and then 18-23 he gives us four kinds of grounds that the word of god falls upon the first is called the wayside ground the second is stoney the third is thorny and the last is a good ground and then jesus interprets these for us the first kind is the wayside the wayside hears the word of god the seed falls on the ground but then satan immediately snatches away the second kind is a stony ground where the word of god is received at first with joy but then in times of temptation and doesn't grow and he had no deep root within himself the third kind is the thorny ground where the seed falls down and begins to grow but it's choked out by all the cares of the world and the last ground is the good ground which jesus calls a good honest heart and this kind of seed produces of its own kind and brings forth fruit this parable helps us understand the classification of where every person falls in the entire world they either fall on a good one which is the wise virgin a thorny heart which is the foolish virgin the stony heart which is the workers of iniquity who at one time might have been sincere but sold out the faith and fell away or the wayside ground those who never really believed and never even tried really to follow god but they did hear the word of god and they were accountable for it so that's why this is a great revelation it's part of the mystery of the kingdom of heaven as jesus said and remember he promised to finish all the mysteries of god so that's why we're so thankful that god has restored this revelation in this time this parable proves there are two kinds of hearts that are saved and two kinds of hearts that are lost the two saved hearts are the wise and foolish virgins jesus mentioned in matthew 25 verses 1-13 and the two lost hearts are the make-believers a judas iscariot who was the son of perdition and eventually lost and unbelievers this subject is a progressive revelation that god revealed to brother branham over the course of his ministry and then just before he went off the scene he clearly taught this revelation in the church age book saying there were four classes of people on page 279 and it's in chapter 7 while writing the section on the book of life there are two different kinds of christians i remember i had a topic with my dad once where he kind of argued and disputed that oh all christians are the same which is not true and that oh we all believe in the same god we'll all go to heaven if we all believe in him but in the bible it clearly states that there are two different kinds of christians let's go through something some common examples in the bible of of a holy man and of a righteous man but a good example would be abraham and lot and a big very important scripture is first peter 4 18 and it says and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and sinner appear saying that there are righteous christians but they are barely saved also in the tribulation there would be righteous christians that are very safe that would have to die for their faith and if you look at abraham lot's example lot barely escapes solomon gomorrah you know with noah he barely escaped the flood which enoch was a perfect type of the wise virgin and we go back to the parable of the wise and foolish virgins kali states that there's wise christians and foolish christians but both of them were both sanctified unto god but one didn't have the holy ghost yeah brother amen that's a great example of lot he's a great example of a foolish virgin notice he was scarcely saved out of sodom he and his daughters which is a type of the foolish virgin being spared from the wrath of the tribulation period they'll suffer and die as martyrs as brother adam said during the first half of the tribulation period but they will not suffer the second half of the tribulation where the trumpets and vials are sounded and poured out but notice abraham the type of the wise virgin was far away from sodom he wasn't even close to it and we're to be the anti-type of abraham where we stay away from denominationalism and we live a humble holy ghost-filled separated life away from those who don't have the same revelation we have of the message of the hour you want to go to what brother bram said about there's always three kinds of grounds within every church yeah brother that quotes from three kinds of believers 1963 november 24th brother branham preached three kinds of believers quote the first is believers make believers and unbelievers now this is quite a subject he said but as sure as we sit here tonight that group is always gathered together wherever the people gather we find this group and always have found them and we probably always will have them until the coming of the lord and i want us tonight to picture ourselves as i speak of these three groups and see what group that we are in end quote so notice brother brahms said we've always had these three kinds of believers now again you can make the three believers fit into the four classes because wise and foolish virgins are both believers the make-believers would be the judas escara type that believed for a while also the workers of iniquity that fall away and the unbelievers will be the kind that never professed faith in god such as pharaoh from the days of moses the sodomites from the days of lot and any other bible person who never had faith in god i mean i'll go back to some of my experiences where i've met plenty of different people from churches and you can always see like some people love god some people they don't want to be there some people go there because their family goes there you kind of see like oh this person doesn't really believe in god so what kind of what kind of ground is he on you know or this person really loves god but yet he still compromises in this area yeah brother amen that's a great example you can discern what kind of heart reaction they have to the gospel i remember back back going to my old church it's we were always saying oh you guys don't want to be like judas so i will always have that thought like maybe i'm a judas because i compromise on this part but i still saving god you know and they try to put that on you and i'm glad i came to this message where i don't actually feel like that no more it's you have freedom from the fear of being of a judas which you know you won't betray god in the end but that's something they come up with when they have when you're in a denomination that's what you battle are you am i a judas am i going to sell out god at the end of my life or anything yeah that's a beautiful thought and i think any honest christian would admit that they battle that at some point am i going to sell out the lord am i going to betray christ am i going to be a judas but jesus's revelation shows us how there's four kinds of grounds and we can just look at our lives like paul said we can examine ourselves whether we're in the faith or not and the bible says make your calling election sure so each day we choose to overcome each day we choose to repent of our sins and more faithfully serve jesus christ and our life is what proves which classification we're in and brother i just had a fresh thought about judas's spirit in relation to the foregrounds of course he was the stony ground that rejoiced in the ministry of jesus for a while until offenses came and he had no deep root within himself the bible says we should be rooted and grounded in love so judas didn't have a real deep love for christ and the word and the gospel and i just thought of this too the best kind of ground the good ground was good and honest so judas was not that good ground he was not the thorny ground he was the stony ground and this scripture just came to me from john chapter 12 where the bible said judas didn't even care for the poor remember when the expensive ointment was used to anoint jesus's head and feet judas complained about it and said it should have been sold and given to the poor but he was not being honest he did not have a good and honest heart look how easy it would have been for him to go confess to jesus or one of the 11 other apostles and say i just need to be honest i don't care for the poor can you pray for me can you help me i need to repent of my selfishness i need to repent of my greediness so i hope that's a help to somebody by god's grace because it really shows the importance of having a good and honest heart brother amen gave some great examples here i want to go through a couple more brother amen mentioned how there were four kinds of believers in the days of enoch you had enoch noah and then borderline believers that maybe listened to noah for a while but then fell away but then you had the unbelievers and the mockers that were lost so four kinds in enoch's day and noah's day then you had four kinds in abraham's day you had abraham the wise virgin type lot the foolish virgin type he was saved the bible said that in second peter chapter two mrs lott was lost or she was the make-believer or the borderline believer then you had the sodomites who never believed in the first place that were totally lost brother brahm said when jesus died there was not three crosses but four so in 1953 brother brown was already telling us about this revelation although it didn't really come to a fruition to the end of his ministry when he had the church age book written and put those words in there on page 279 about there's a fourth class or another class of believers so here's an example brother branham growing in progressive revelation jesus had a cross he was the type of the wise virgin the saved thief who was saved right at the end is a type of the foolish virgin who didn't live the same type of life as jesus lived but he was still saved then you had judas who hung on for a while judas the make-believer hung around for a while but sold out christ and was lost and then you had the lost thief who never believed in jesus to begin with another one i found today was in the days of micaiah he was the wise virgin he stayed with what elijah said you had jehoshaphat who kind of compromised with ahab a little bit and didn't really live the life he should have lived he's a type of the foolish virgin you had ahab who would repent a little bit and kind of believe for a while but then of course ended up being lost married to jezebel and then you had jezebel who never did believe it all so again there you have the four classes of believers where do you think nicodemus and joseph lands that's a good question about nicodemus and joseph of arimathea in fact that'd be a good subject for a future podcast because we could research their history and see what does history say about their life and did their life produce a genuine repentance and following of christ for example did they repent of following the jewish sanhedrin and then get saved sanctified baptized filled with the holy ghost or not so that'd be a good subject i think brother branham to the best that he knew in the church age book he said perhaps nicodemus would be saved because brother ann must have not studied his history of course i haven't either but yeah that'd be a good subject to study out and see what was the fruits of their life did they did their hearts end up being a good heart well here's another scripture that supports the four kinds of ground which is revelation 22 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still he that is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let them be holy still so it clearly sees that there's a holy christian there's a righteous christian there are filthy people who's pretty much as a judas and the unjust or the people that never believed in the first place and notice this is in revelation 22 right this is the end of the bible this is the the final prophecy before the book is finished and jesus is letting us know there's always been four kinds of people since the beginning of time even we can see it like in the days of enoch and days of abraham and there's going to be these four kinds all the way up to the end of human history and we're approaching that very quickly here as we're closing in on the times of the gentiles as jesus said in luke 21 verse 24 and after the rapture of the bride of christ then god is going to leave the gentiles and go back to the jews so we're talking about the ending with the white throne judgment a good point is that the holy christians or the ones that believed in the full word they were already been judged so they would be judging with jesus and says in revelations 3 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i overcome and sat down with my father in his throne just hearing that makes me joyful knowing that we get to sit with christ and that we get to we're able to judge with him and we'll be in one accord with him so we're already judged here and we've already made our path straight and those who didn't are those who loved god but didn't go with him all the way and everyone else who didn't believe right the foolish virgins are going to have to be judged at the white throne judgment because they live foolishly during their time all here on earth and remember paul told the corinthians in 1st corinthians chapter 6 he said do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world now paul also said every man must stand before the judgment seat of christ so we understand that to mean the holy ghost-filled raptured saints they'll go up to the marriage supper of the lamb and sometime up there in heaven while the earth is experiencing the awful tribulation period the holy ghost filled believers will all stand before christ and their lives will be judged but they will be receiving rewards during that judgment because their lives were already judged by the word they were washed by the waters of the word here during this lifetime and then after the thousand-year millennium the battle of gog and magog at the white throne judgment the holy ghost-filled saints sit with jesus on the throne as jesus promised there was brother amen read in revelation 3 21 of course that promise goes not just to today's holy ghost filled believers but all the believers down through all the seven church ages because the bible says he that overcomes inherits all things let's talk a little bit about the millennium that's a good topic to talk about i believe the millennium is only for those who have the holy ghost who who are the wise virgins and the foolish christians would not be able to go to the millennium as i believe the millennium is the honeymoon period for the bride of jesus christ and for jesus and that's when he'll be ruling for a thousand years in revelations 25 through 6 it says but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that have part in the first resurrection on such the second death have no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and still reign with him a thousand years in the millennium you're spending a thousand years of christ i don't think you'll be judged at the right time judgment if you're already reigning with christ that's exactly right the bible says we live for a thousand years we reign with him because as verse 4 says in revelation 20 these believers did not worship the beast which is the spirit of rome today nor their image and then paul said in the book of romans as well we reign in this life by jesus christ so we rule over sin the flesh the devil the world and we do that by yielding to the holy spirit and then we live like paul said we don't live by our faith but we live by the faith of the son of god and so that's where we'd say foolish virgins they're virgin to the word they're virgin to all the word that they believe but they've been foolish not to redeem their time and get the oil which is the baptism of the holy ghost but they're still virgin they never had intercourse or spiritual fornication with idols but they were foolish they failed to believe all the promises of god that the wise virgin received and prepared for so because of that they cannot live the bible said the rest of the dead live not again so the rest of the dead includes all the sinners it includes the foolish virgin that were not born again of the holy ghost and the jews who are blinded to the messiah but are still saved as god's prophet brother i'm taught in the fifth seal as well so it's only the holy ghost-filled saints down through the ages that live and reign with christ during the thousand years and it's a reward because jesus said if you invest in your talents if you have five talents invest in the five you get ten he said because you've done this i'll make your ruler over ten cities or so we see the rewards of christ when you're faithful and reign over sin in this life he allows you to rule and reign during the millennium i have a lot of friends and denominations that obey the word but they don't obey every single thing because their denominational beliefs or their pastor says oh no we don't believe that or an example would be like oh we don't believe in days and miracles anymore because we think it's past which is not true but what does the bible say you would believe your pastor or would you believe what the word of god says that really separates who is a wise virgin and a foolish virgin is someone who believes the word all the way no matter what it says oh really good scripture is jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i mean so many people just overlooked that if jesus healed people in the past that jesus saved people in the past jesus said you will be able to do this and that according to scripture it still applies to today and the future that's a misconception with denominations we're saying the days of miracle is past but don't you believe jesus jesus said it's not passage that he's the same yesterday forever and these signs shall follow them that believe and god's prophet brother brahm said jesus and paul ordained the gifts in the bible and they never took him out so how can a church take them out how can a church deny the word of god like that so exactly right he's the same yesterday today and forever when you have that principle from hebrews 13 8 and also from the book of malachi where he says i am the lord and i change not if you're really in love with god if you really hear what the spirit is saying to the churches you'll hear the fact that the holy spirit is saying i still send signs these signs still follow them that believe because they're born again they have the life of jesus christ inside their souls and you see in denominations where there's not a lot of miracles it's because they don't believe in the first place remember jesus said i can't perform many miracles because of their unbelief and that's the same thing with denominations if you don't believe that god can do this then you won't see it happening amen and that shows the denominational system is dead like revelation 3 1 says they have a name that they live but they're dead they call themselves lutherans methodist church of christ they have a name they're trying to live but they're spiritually dead to the things of god so within those denominations you have a few that are saved because jesus said in matthew 7 14 few will find the narrow road to salvation it's a dead system the denominational system is dead but there's a few in there that will find it and they'll be the foolish virgins they're foolish because they should have came out of there they should have left that they should have believed more of the word and got born again but at the same time god is merciful to them just like he was merciful to lot down there in sodom lot didn't partake in the homosexuality he called it wickedness well the same is true today you have christians in denominational systems that they condemn wicked sins and abominations but they're foolish and they don't leave the system but the bible still calls a lot of righteous man that's why we can look at denominations and in in love say there's some righteous in there and we pray for them to come out just like abraham prayed for lot it's really sad to see when you ask them like are you a christian and they say no i'm a methodist i'm a baptist what's that god do with being a christian a christian is someone who follows the word of god and believes the bible and we don't see that nowadays where there's so many few christians that actually genuinely believe the word of god and it's getting smaller and smaller every day the denomination has really pretty much taken over the whole world where everything's just a system now it's just you go to church and you'll be saved which is false yeah that's exactly scriptural you know jesus said few there be that find it then paul gave us prophecy and said the last days will be perilous or troublesome times he said before the antichrist is revealed there's a great falling away so in order to fall away from christianity you have to be gathered around christianity in order to fall away and that's what we're seeing today a great falling away and paul also prophesied in 2nd timothy chapter 3 that evil men and seducers will wax worse and worse deceived and being deceived so we know less and less people will be saved and times are getting spiritually darker all the time but that just means the light and truth of jesus christ will shine brighter and brighter and we shouldn't be discouraged to keep praying for our friends and our families hoping that they'll come into the word of god you know the greatest gift is to be saved and to have salvation in jesus exactly and god reminded our church of that recently right we had a brother who was with us five years ago his name is brother austin he left the church he got discouraged the enemy got a short-term victory over him but we kept praying and week after week month after month year after year for five years request after request was made that god would bring him back and then in december 2021 after five years god brought our brother back and god has done sign after wonder after miracle proving that god is the one that brought him back and god is the one that's going to sanctify him so again that should be our heart just like abraham's heart abraham's heart was to pray for lot right to pray for the foolish virgin so that's our desire we want to pray for the foolish virgin as well and by grace we're believing austin is a wise virgin just like we believe for ourselves but this is an example to never give up praying for our friends and family sometimes it takes a long time for the prayer to come to pass but know that god always keeps his word and god will give them the opportunity to come back to the word of god and do time in season now i kind of want to look at this thought about how a lot of people don't understand the four kinds of grounds because they don't believe the church age book or haven't read the church age book but i'd like to deal with some of these thoughts here for a few moments most people who follow the message of william branham have heard him say there's always three kinds of believers and that's true but as brother branham went on in his revelation as we said in the church age book he says there's a fourth class but both statements can still work with scripture so what i mean by this if you say there's three kinds of believers brother branham said there was believers there was make-believers and unbelievers well that still fits with the four classes as long as you put the two kinds of believers the wise and the foolish inside the believer's class and then the make-believers would be the ones that were lost like judas or mrs lott then you have the unbelievers who were never saved like the sodomites or even pharaoh from moses's day who never believed and again as i mentioned earlier brother branham talked about the four crosses in 1953 so 12 years before he passed away god had given him insight into these four kinds of believers and then it's laid out beautifully in the church age book where he's in the section on the book of life and he says there's a section called the lamb's book of life those names can never be removed those were the ones that were predestinated before the foundation world that's the wise virgin he said but in that foolish virgin group god records the names of believers and some of them will remain but some can also be blotted out like we saw with judas brother branham said judas's name was blotted out because he believed for a while but then in the hour temptation he sold out christ and jesus said those who don't overcome their names will be blotted out of the book of life yeah that just proves that the there's a false doctrine of once they've always saved which is clearly not scriptural or not supported in scripture and we see it in the old testament and the new testament because in the book of exodus moses stands in the gap for israel says blot my name out and let israel be saved and god said no moses he said i'll only blot out those who sinned against me so we see again jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever in the old testament names had to be blotted out if people refused god's covenant and the same is true in the new testament names are blotted out if people sell out the blood covenant of jesus christ some people say there's not four kinds of classes but i think we prove by the scripture there are revelation 22 11 second timothy 2 20 matthew 13. those are three clear examples and we see four kinds of believers in four different time periods jesus's time enoch's time abraham's time and makai's time and i must apologize i now realize i didn't mention paul's bible teaching of the four kinds of vessels that supports jesus's four grounds parable and it's found in second timothy two verse twenty it says but in the great house there are not only vessels of golden of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honor and some to dishonor again this is a beautiful scripture showing four kinds of vessels perfectly supporting jesus's foregrounds parables so in this case the gold and the silver would be the two kinds of saved believers the gold would be the wise virgin and the silver would be the foolish virgin the other two kinds would be the two kinds of lost people the wood and earth the wood would be the make-believers like judas iscariot and the earth would be the unbelievers like pharaoh the sodomites and others from bible examples and notice the bible says some to honor the gold and silver vessels were honorable vessels very useful vessels and then the wood and earth vessels would be dishonorable vessels and of course these four kind of vessels go along with the four conditions every soul finds themselves in according to revelation chapter 22 verse 11 the holy and righteous would be the wise and foolish and the filthy and unjust the filthy would be the make-believer the unjust would be the unbeliever so some people might wonder about the jews the blinded jews that brother branham preaches about in the fifth seal brother branham said these blinded jews are still saved and that's scriptural the bible says they're under the throne in heaven they're not in hell they're in heaven and they're crying out how long o lord holy and true dost thou not avenge our blood upon those that dwell upon the earth and then the lord graciously answers back and says more brother need to fulfill the number of martyrs and of course we know that to be the remaining jews that need to die for their faith in order for the blood curse that israel put upon themselves at jesus cross to be fulfilled and then brother ram taught us in the church age book that these jews get their white robes at the great white throne judgment so based upon all this bible truth in bible revelation the jews have to be foolish virgin they're not born again because they deny christ but they are saved because they're virgin to all that they believe they're doing all the commands under the mosaic law and this is scriptural it's a scriptural principle that god will honor all of his previous covenants you find that in leviticus 26 verses 41 and 42 god promised israel that if they're scattered he would remember the covenant of abraham now that's amazing jews that are under the most recent covenant mosaic if they're disobedient to that one god will still honor his previous covenants so according to the thus saith the lord revelation god gave to brother branham regarding the seven seals if you look at the fifth seal the blinded jews who were faithful to the testimony of the word of god will be saved they did not have the testimony of jesus christ so you have to read revelation chapter 1 and revelation chapter 5 and you'll see how john differentiated between the testimony of jesus christ new testament testimony and the testimony of the word of god which was the old testament testimony and so we see god in his loving gracious heart he's able to save the blinded jews of the new testament and give them a place in heaven under the altar in the sixth dimension and then promise them white robes at the great white throne judgment so the blinded jews will not be sitting on the throne with christ because they were blinded to christ during their lifetime but jesus in his mercy will give them white robes because they were faithful to the word of god that they knew let's go quick through the prophets after jesus so when i first came to this message i did not know that there's prophets after jesus but it's clearly supported in the bible there's a really good scripture that i think we all hear as beware of false prophets clearly states in the new testament there are false prophets that we should be aware of and they're saying there's prophets then there has to be a true prophet too exactly great point brother in ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16 the bible says jesus when he ascended to heaven he sent down gifts and these gifts would bring the church to maturity to completion to a unity of faith and one of those gifts is a prophet so that's a great point there's going to be a lot of false prophets trying to imitate the true prophets and we're so thankful we have the fivefold ministry gifts apostle prophet teacher pastor evangelist jesus christ then established the gift of a prophet he gave gifts unto men and they're never taken away in the rest of the scripture and then 30 years after jesus went to heaven and sent these gifts jesus spirit had paul write the bible and ordain the gifts when he wrote the letter to the ephesians and the letter to the corinthians and this fulfills what jesus said in john 16 verse 13 the holy ghost will tell you things to come how is the holy ghost going to tell us things to come unless there's a prophet to tell us that and that lines up with amos 3 verse 7 surely the lord god will do nothing but he reveals his secret unto his servants the prophets there's also in revelations where jesus has the seven stars in his hand which represents the seven prophets the seven messengers in each church age and we already have our seventh one which is brother branham and he already died and passed away and we're still living through his ministry and his message very good seven eyes represent seven seers in the bible prophets are called seers so we can clearly see how paul and brother branham were genuine prophets and so that means the other five iranius martin columba luther wesley the other five must have had prophetic gifts as well now of course we need to do more research on them but they clearly were stars in the hand of jesus and they're also called jesus's eyes according to revelation 5 6 so that understanding of the prophetic times they were living in and able to identify the word of god for their age preach it and then that word was spread out to the rest of their generation or their church age another point is that there are also many prophets too not major prophets like the seven messengers but also the many prophets a good example that is paul and agabus we can clearly see how paul was a prophet paul prophesied of perilous times in second timothy 3 1 the times when the church would not endure sound doctrine in second timothy 4 3 the rapture in first thessalonians chapter 4 the falling away the church before the antichrist in second thessalonians 2 verse 3 no doubt a major prophet wrote most of the new testament and said all men would be judged by his gospel so that's a major prophet you can't add one word or take one word away from paul but then you have agabus who no doubt was a mighty man of god but we'd call him a minor prophet there's two examples where agaves foretold the future acts 11 28 he foretold the great dearth or famine that was to come upon the land and that prepared the saints to gather up food and send it to the saints who had need it was thus saith the lord and it came to pass second he told paul in acts 21 verse 10 that paul would be delivered to the gentiles now of course paul knew that but god used agabus to give another word because in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established and agabus thus saith the lord came to pass yeah so as we're showing there's lots of examples of prophets after jesus we showed paul was a prophet agabus was a prophet now let's look at a few more saint john the divine was a prophet 60 years after jesus ascended to heaven jesus christ by the holy ghost visited john john saw him in his supreme deity as revelation chapter 1 records and he went on to write 22 chapters of prophecy some of which have come to pass but not all so clearly saint john was a prophet and as another vindication john was with peter and james on mount transfiguration and saw the vision of jesus moses and elijah so again prophets see visions they foretell the future peter's another example he saw mount transfiguration he also saw the vision in acts 10 of the sheep coming down with beasts and god said do not call unclean what i've cleansed and then in second peter chapter three he prophesied of scoffers in the last days and he also prophesied of the day of the lord coming with fervent heat now it might help our listeners too to hear a more recent example of prophecy before we get into brother branham's prophetic ministry in 2011 i'd already been pastoring here in akron for five years but we were at some special meetings in napoleon ohio they were highly anointed meetings god was healing people setting them free delivering them but after the meetings a pastor whose name i'm not going to mention out of respect because i haven't asked him if i have his permission to share this came up and told me the holy ghost told me numerous well-known message preachers are going to die in 2012. now of course i was shocked to hear that very rarely do we get a prophecy or thus saith the lord whether it's in church or between others and that's fine because we shouldn't be trying to impersonate them and try to make ourselves profits but this is one time i can definitely say that god gave us a genuine prophecy in those meetings in 2011 and sure enough as 2012 came three of the most well-known preachers around the message passed away in that year and then there were numerous other ministers that passed away during that year but it was god showing us that the gift of prophecy this case would be a gift of minor prophecy we're still in operation we've had a few dreams that were prophetic in nature over the years and two of them i can think of now were warnings and seem to be prophetic the first one is a dream i had about a friend who was at the time in the message believing everything but i dream about him and he was playing tennis in all pink it was a skin tight very feminine type of tennis outfit and in my dream i saw his wife longing to be like him standing at a fence surrounding the tennis court just staring at him well i went and shared this with the brother and he kind of brushed it off it didn't mean anything to him a number of years later this couple left the message and we were still friends on social media and they put up a post of both of them playing tennis and the brother had his shirt off which we believe is a very immodest thing to do because he was a pretty muscular brother and that might cause sisters to lust after him but then his wife of course had shorts on a tight tennis outfit in a very seductive outfit and so to me it appears my dream was prophetic because it gave the brother a warning that if he didn't live closer to the lord he would fall away from the truth of the gospel and that came to pass second my wife had another dream about a warning which she gave to his sister in the dream the sister had fallen away from the faith and was wearing pants when my wife was burdened she went to the sister and shared it the sister laughed it off which was a very sad thing and then a couple years later the sister had fallen away she left the message and has now worn pants for probably 15 or 20 years so again this dream seemed very prophetic in nature as well those are just two humble examples but any holy ghost-filled christian or any christian in general who respects the supernatural knows that god still prophesies today now there's no major prophet today because brother branham went off the scene 56 years ago in 1965 but we still have minor gifts of prophecy and that lines up with the scripture as well from first corinthians 12 where there's a gift of prophecy in the church still what do you think about some of these churches like bethel and hillsongs saying or teaching their people you can prophesy this over your life what do you think about that that's a great question but it seems like they're taking an old testament idea about schools of the prophets because there were school of the prophets in the old testament but from what i've seen on the youtube videos it seems they're trying to manufacture prophecies and of course if you look at all their doctrine some of it might be true but a lot of it contains leaven or heresies and that reminds us of balaam who who did have genuine prophecies that came to pass but in his doctrine he taught fornication and idolatry and therefore was called a false prophet so again that lines up with what you said about jesus jesus said many false prophets will come well here here's schools of many people claiming to be prophets but they have no real bible vindication of it what amazes me is that they're teaching people how to prophesy and the bible clearly states not everyone is a prophet yeah paul said do all prophesy do all of gifts of healings do all speak with tongues and the sad part is or their schools making a lot of money off these people that are that are being taught by man to prophesy but the bible clearly says a prophet is born a prophet is not taught how to be a prophet like god told jeremiah before you were born i ordained you a prophet so this shows a denominational spirit is working in that movement trying to create man-made prophets rather than god sent prophets these modern so-called prophets from bethel or hillsong they generally prophesy about revivals in foreign countries i've heard they prophesy over people's lives and who knows if they ever come to pass it's likely they don't but jesus said by their fruits you'll know them and what do these people teach they teach the prosperity gospel god wants you rich and always wants you healthy and wealthy and some of them like the bethel people they do grave soaking so they lay on the graves of dead believers thinking that the anointing that was on the dead person is going to come on them and of course they have no modesty standards the women cut their hair they wear makeup they cross dress they allow women preachers which the bible forbids in first timothy chapter 2 and so again you look at their fruits jesus said you would know the false prophets by their fruits their corrupt fruits so it's likely many of these bethel or hillsong so-called prophets are not prophets although some of them could be minor prophets they could have genuine gifts of prophecy as again i haven't listened to every single one of their prophecies but if they teach false doctrine even after prophesying correctly then we would call them false prophets some people point to hebrews chapter 1 verses 1 and 2 and say there's no more prophets the bible says god spake in times past unto the fathers by prophets but hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son so some people say god is not speaking by prophets anymore and they would say we wouldn't need a william branham today or we wouldn't need any prophecy gifts today of course this is a huge misunderstanding it's a huge false doctrine that we would not need prophets anymore now the main proof that they misinterpreted this text is because this book of hebrews was written between 60 a d and 80 a.d if this meant there was no more prophets then why did jesus go to john and give him the entire book of revelation in 80 90 or 80 95 or some people say 100 a.d so it doesn't mean that that's proof right there that all this is saying is that god used jesus christ to fulfill all the prophets and also to fulfill the law and to preach that the kingdom of god is at hand and of course the kingdom of god fell on the day of pentecost through the keys that jesus had given to peter and peter opened the door of faith to the jews and the gentiles and the samaritans and then god sent paul to finish the whole council of god and then you throw john in there as well another prophet and jesus was using all of these prophets to speak to his people so again you've got to understand hebrews 1 in the light of the rest of the scripture you had agabus you had paul you had peter john there's four more prophets at least that came after jesus and we can look back through history and see other prophets as well and of course a more modern day prophet brother branham in this day so we're thankful that jesus christ is still alive he's the same yesterday today and forever and we're thankful that the spirit of jesus christ is the spirit of prophecy well let's look at a real prophet brother branno when i first came this message i didn't know who brother branham was or i didn't know there was prophets after jesus and i was really skeptical about brother brown when i first came in but then the more i listened to it the more he pointed back to the bible and to the word of god and it really made me believe that wow this man is a genuine prophet he had miracles signs and wonders and everything he did pointed back to the bible and that's where a lot of people that knew brother branham or like churches that didn't like brother brown because they didn't line up with their thinking or their doctrines brother braham said a lot of things that were contradictory to a lot of teachings from the churches like serpent seed and like water baptism but when you look in the scripture you find out that he was telling the truth if you do your homework and if you really want to know the truth and you you go through it then you'll find the truth that he was he was telling he wasn't lying he was telling the truth on the word of god and restoring it back to the original yeah that's a great testimony brother that's a lot like mine too when i first came the message i just was introduced to bible studies and i could see all these revelations were right serpent seed godhead water baptism non-eternal hell the seven church ages all these things and we finally asked where'd you get it from and they said william branham well like any person we went online that was back in 2001 or 2002 well most of the sites were against brother branham they still are but as brother amen said when you seek god with all your heart soul mind and strength holy ghost will guide you into all truth as we started testing the things brother branham said we found so many of them back in the scripture now what i mean by that is not every word on his tapes is thus saith the lord there are some human mistakes he made there's some human thoughts and opinions that time has showed we're not right but those things were not spoken in the name of the lord so brother brahm is still a true prophet of god but what vindicated him were numerous things but especially that thus saith the lords that came to pass and all that thus saith the lord bible teachings that he gave us you know in my 2021 book i listed at least 30 thus saith the lord statements from brother branham in that final chapter to try to prove to everyone afresh that god had sent a prophet to this generation and we should listen to brother branham as he points us back to the word of god six thus saith the lords were about the 12 new testament mysteries in other words 12 of those new testament mysteries were spoken with thus saith the lord brother braham gave us eight doctrines spoken with us saith the lord brother branham has three prophecies that were thus saith the lord that are in the process of coming to pass first there will be no greater gift to the gentiles than brother branham's gift second the immoral condition of the united states churches and third there will be no return to the apostolic ministry from denominations they will not repent and return back to the word of god and then we listed 11 future prophecies brother brahm gave us about united states rome russia vatican mark of the beast and advances in science some people forget about prophecies that were related to healing or perhaps passing away in 1955 brother branham told florence humes that she would be healed of her tuberculosis in the name of jesus christ he condemned satan and it's on tape and you can hear it he said to prove to you that this is right go away yourself the next two mondays and you'll gain weight well she did that was a prophecy of healing in the name of jesus christ well she went and did that she already had three kids she ended up having five more she had 25 grandchildren over 40 great-grandchildren by god's grace i had a chance to meet her around 2010 about five years before she passed away second in 1958 brother branham gave marilyn hickey a prophecy that she would have a baby when she couldn't have any brother ram didn't even know that the holy ghost had to show him a vision that she couldn't have children and she was 26 years old and said thus saith the lord if you'll believe you're going to have a baby well she had to believe she had to believe 10 years but then she finally had a child so god was faithful another thus saith the lord spoken and came to pass a third one was where brother bannon prophesied of sister shakarian's death i know accusers of brother branham don't really think that's a prophecy but it's actually scriptural in second kings chapter 1 verses 1 through 17 elijah foretold king ahaziah's death and that's what brother branham did in 1965 he foretold florence shakarian's death now the reason that was so powerful was because all the full gospel pentecostal people were prophesying of her healing but brother branham saw a vision of her passing so brother branham had to stand against all these false prophecies and proclaim the true prophecy and it came to pass so again we see brother branham had the spirit of elijah brother brandon predicted the future for healings and also answers to people's prayers he gave us an interpretation of the bible with us saith the lord and at times he had to predict people's passing as well all these are proofs that god sent brother branham as a genuine prophet to this day and a great scripture that validates it is revelation 10 verse 7 in the days of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished this seventh angel has to be a gentile prophet because when he receives the open book from jesus christ the bible says in the next verses in verses 8 through 11 in revelation 10 that john or the bride or the church must eat those revelations and then go prophesy again to every people nation kindred tongue in other words god sends his open book revelation to a gentile prophet who preaches it on the earth and then the bride of jesus christ receives that and finishes the great commission and takes it to all the gentile nations just as jesus said in matthew 24 the gospel must be preached to every nation and then the end will come and also fulfills luke 21 verse 24 where jesus said jerusalem will be trodden under until the times of the gentiles are finished so we can clearly see there has to be a gentile prophet who finishes the mystery of god brother branham finished all the mysteries of god that are called mysteries in the bible he's left the scene he's done his part and now we're like john we're eating those revelations and prophesying them again until the times of the gentiles is fulfilled this is a video that we that you saw that church one time where this guy was saying i am elijah son from god you can see that there are people that are looking for the coming of elijah but they don't know that he already came yeah brother that was tony palmer now was very sad he passed away in 2014 just a few months after he said he had the spirit of elijah upon it so again here's an example of people claiming to be prophets and i even put this in my 2021 book that numerous people have claimed to have the spirit of elijah but if we just look at that tony palmer example and brother branham both claim to have the spirit of elijah but which one really had the spirit of elijah tony palmer was saying he had the spirit of elijah to unite all the word of faith and denominational churches back with the mother harlot rome so clearly by his fruits and by his association with all those wolves and false prophets we knew he was not telling the truth while we are so sad for his family and we pray for them that they'll be saved we can recognize he did not have the true spirit of elijah on the other hand brother branham had numerous thus saith the lords for healing that came to pass we see three prophecies that are coming to pass today and of course there's probably hundreds more healing prophecies that came to pass than what we're aware of but then we can see all of us thus saith the lord from the bible on doctrine being right and we can see how he finished the mysteries of god we can see how he had the spirit of elijah he foretold things in the name of the lord he was a man of the wilderness like elijah was he preached against immoral women like elijah did against jezebel and john the baptist did against herodias so brother branham had all the attributes of the spirit of elijah plus he had the supernatural vindication of thus saith the lord with prophecies coming to pass and his major bible doctrines being vindicated by thus saith the lord and then being able to be found right in the bible yeah it was in 1954 when brother branham said quote and then finally she the roman catholic church was the mother of harlots she gave birth unto churches after her because they couldn't have been boys they had to be girls and we find out that the protestant church is the product of the catholic church by searching the scriptures and looking at your history book we see that the protestant church is the product and the protestant can't holler at the catholic because the both says they are harlots and that's flat but that's thus saith the lord end quote so again tony palmer could not be anointed with the spirit of elijah because the spirit of elijah had already come upon brother branham with thus saith the lord to warn the people not to unite with the roman catholic church and the protestant churches that hold the roman catholic church doctrine like the trinity doctrine and that was just like elijah in the days of ahab and jezebel elijah preached against jezebel just like brother branham preached against the roman catholic church the roman catholic church is the modern day jezebel according to revelation 2 verse 20 so it's a clear scriptural type again showing how the spirit of elijah was upon brother branham in truth so in summary it's been a great podcast here hope you enjoyed learning about the four heart reactions to the gospel and also it's clear there were more prophets to come after jesus christ four examples just from the bible and then we can have other examples from church history such as with brother branham again if you

i want to leave you with this quote from brother branham where he says the same thing in 1953 in the sermon called the ministry of christ brother ram said he was there to preach and defend the gospel of jesus christ such a beautiful quote so i'll leave you with this quote god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your among man heart his church the same jesus that was yesterday will defeat his day and forever and never fail [Music]
