[0:02] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:08] this video is to give a brief summary of
[0:10] why I believe the mysterious Arizona
[0:13] cloud from February 28
[0:15] 1963 was of Supernatural origin
[0:20] and I'm making this video at the request
[0:22] of a viewer
[0:24] previously on April 22nd 2022 I put a
[0:28] short six minute segment about the
[0:30] Arizona cloud in my 107th video called
[0:34] the round bear Vision was a conditional
[0:37] promise plus brief responses to other
[0:40] accusations and this segment is around
[0:42] the 54 minute and 40 second mark
[0:46] I'll add this six minute segment to the
[0:48] end of this video as this first part of
[0:51] the video will be a brief summary of the
[0:53] content so it's a little more organized
[0:56] I'll begin with four reasons why I
[0:58] believe the cloud was of a supernatural
[1:01] origin
[1:02] first brother Branham had a reputation
[1:04] as a faithful Bible teacher friends I've
[1:08] been a Christian since about the year
[1:10] 2000 and I've never heard a man Teach so
[1:15] much Bible truth which has led to so
[1:17] much Revelation from the Holy Spirit as
[1:20] brother William Branham I've been
[1:22] listening to brother Branham since the
[1:24] year 2002 and I've been preaching his
[1:27] Revelations from God and Bible teachings
[1:30] since 2004 and I continue to teach the
[1:34] Bible revelations God gave to brother
[1:35] Branham to this day
[1:37] of course there are numerous minor
[1:40] doctrines brother Adam taught or may
[1:42] have believed that may or may not be
[1:44] correct but on brother Ram's major
[1:46] doctrines he was completely correct and
[1:49] then he would speak thus saith the Lord
[1:51] that they were correct and we know
[1:53] they're right because they're true
[1:54] according to the Bible
[1:57] the sad part is many of other brands
[1:58] accusers don't even listen to brother
[2:01] Brandon's sermons with an honest heart
[2:02] they don't hear him pleading with
[2:05] Sinners to repent and give their lives
[2:07] to Jesus Christ for 15 or 30 or 45
[2:10] minutes
[2:11] they don't hear brother Brandon weeping
[2:13] and rejoicing and giving God praise when
[2:15] Sinners get saved
[2:17] they only listen to criticize brother
[2:19] Branham which I believe is a sin that
[2:22] they're committing
[2:23] I cannot over emphasize the importance
[2:26] of brother branham's Bible revelations
[2:28] that he taught us they've influenced my
[2:30] entire life they've transformed my life
[2:33] have made over 160 videos about brother
[2:35] Brandon's Bible teachings and also
[2:37] written two books about brother Brands
[2:39] Bible teachings
[2:40] brother Ram's preaching about the Bible
[2:43] and Bible teachings has made the Bible a
[2:45] brand new Bible to me because I was
[2:47] raised in the Assembly of God
[2:49] denomination my entire life
[2:51] and the Bible made no sense but as soon
[2:53] as I heard brother Adam's Revelations
[2:55] the Bible finally made sense and God
[2:58] showed me his power and Revelation
[3:00] through the word of God which brother
[3:03] Brandon preached ultimately all the
[3:05] credit goes to the Holy Ghost of course
[3:07] because as brother Adam said no man can
[3:09] interpret the word of God Jesus Christ
[3:11] has to interpret God's word and then
[3:14] reveal it to the prophets
[3:16] which God did God revealed it to brother
[3:18] Branham in our day
[3:20] the second reason I believe the cloud
[3:22] was of Supernatural origin is because
[3:24] brother random gave two prophecies about
[3:26] the cloud
[3:28] and he prophesied according to the
[3:30] vision that God gave him about the seven
[3:32] angels and he prophesied on December
[3:34] 30th 1962 and January 14 1963
[3:39] saying the Visions were in the name of
[3:42] the Lord and you can hear those quotes
[3:43] towards the end of this video
[3:45] third reason I believe the cloud was of
[3:47] Supernatural origin is because of Bill
[3:49] rostrand's scientific evidence
[3:52] bill rostran is a message believer I
[3:54] believe from South Carolina if I'm not
[3:55] mistaken I've never met him
[3:57] but he has almost six hours of Bible
[4:00] teaching
[4:01] and also scientific facts proving the
[4:04] cloud was made by a supernatural origin
[4:08] and the fourth reason I believe the
[4:09] cloud was of Supernatural origin is
[4:11] because of the supernatural revelation
[4:14] of the Seven Seals that God gave to
[4:16] brother Branham
[4:18] brother Ram's accuser say brother random
[4:20] plagiarizes Seven Seals that is utter
[4:22] nonsense
[4:23] I don't know how they can say that with
[4:25] a straight face I have videos proving
[4:28] all Seven Seals brother random taught
[4:30] were revealed to him by the Holy Ghost
[4:32] and there are over 38 differences
[4:34] between brother rand's Revelations on
[4:36] the Seven Seals and Clarence Larkin
[4:38] Charles Taze Russell and Uriah Smith's
[4:40] teachings on the Seven Seals and Friends
[4:42] there's even more than 38 differences
[4:44] because with each of the seals brother
[4:46] man's accusers only compared brother
[4:48] Rand to one of those Bible teachers and
[4:50] not the other two
[4:52] moving on now I want to share four
[4:54] additional points about the cloud topic
[4:57] that need to be addressed first this
[4:59] case is ultimately brother Ram's
[5:01] accuser's word against brother branham's
[5:03] word and brother Brandon is not here to
[5:06] share his side of this discussion
[5:09] and remember friends government data and
[5:11] records are not infallible according to
[5:15] Matthew chapter 4 and Jesus Satan is in
[5:18] charge ultimately of every government so
[5:20] how can we make government records or
[5:22] NASA records or any government records
[5:25] infallible of course any honest person
[5:28] will agree with that government records
[5:30] are not infallible and remember friends
[5:32] brother M's accusers were not there
[5:35] on February 28 1963 in Arizona to
[5:39] witness firsthand that the cloud was
[5:41] formed by a Thor rocket they're just
[5:43] taking someone else's word for it they
[5:46] were not eyewitnesses the second point
[5:48] is that brother Braham never said with
[5:50] thus saith the Lord he was under the
[5:52] cloud on February 28
[5:54] 1963. of course the record show he was
[5:57] probably in Texas I believe pleading for
[6:00] a young man's life to be spared but
[6:02] whether he was there or in Texas or some
[6:04] other location it doesn't matter because
[6:06] brother Branham never said thus saith
[6:08] the Lord I was under the cloud
[6:10] third point is that brother Branham
[6:12] could have been under the cloud by
[6:13] vision
[6:14] and that happened to Ezekiel in Ezekiel
[6:16] 8 verse 15 of course I've been
[6:19] criticized and kind of made fun of just
[6:21] for saying this could be a possibility
[6:23] but if we're Believers in the Bible and
[6:26] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[6:27] and forever and it's very possible
[6:29] brother random could have been in Texas
[6:30] and had a vision and he could have been
[6:32] transported by Vision to be under the
[6:35] cloud that's what happened to Ezekiel
[6:37] Ezekiel was sitting in his house in
[6:40] chaldea
[6:41] which was probably over 100 miles away
[6:43] from Jerusalem and he was translated in
[6:46] the vision from chaudia to Jerusalem
[6:49] the fourth and final point is that
[6:50] brother bran did not say cloud before
[6:53] the event happened we admit that but
[6:56] brother random called the cloud a snow
[6:58] white pyramid on December 30th 1962 and
[7:03] of course any honest person would admit
[7:05] the cloud looks like a snow white
[7:07] pyramid
[7:08] so by God's grace now I'll play the six
[7:10] minute segment previously released on
[7:14] April 22nd 2022 it covers a lot of the
[7:18] same information I just stated
[7:20] but I wanted to State those facts in a
[7:22] more organized way of course there's
[7:24] probably more questions about the cloud
[7:26] but I believe these four reasons and
[7:29] then the Four Points about the cloud
[7:31] experience are enough to prove to any
[7:33] honest person that the cloud was of a
[7:35] supernatural origin so if you have any
[7:37] questions concerns or testimonies about
[7:40] this video please contact me and friends
[7:42] it's easiest to contact me through my
[7:45] email address
[7:46] so here's the six minute segment from
[7:48] April 22nd 2022 God bless you and may
[7:52] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
[7:56] the February 28 1963 Arizona cloud
[8:01] again this case is ultimately brother
[8:04] Ram's word against brother Adam's
[8:06] accusers words
[8:07] brother Ram's accusers cannot fully
[8:09] prove with absolute certainty that the
[8:12] cloud was formed by a rocket they try to
[8:14] make their data and paperwork and
[8:16] absolute but that doesn't mean it is
[8:19] also I cannot prove that the cloud was
[8:22] formed by seven angels I'm taking
[8:24] brother Brown's word because of his
[8:25] bible-based teaching
[8:27] because of the cloud Prophecy from sirs
[8:30] is this the end time December 30th 1962
[8:34] Bill rostrand's evidence
[8:36] that the Arizona Cloud was formed by
[8:39] Supernatural means and not human means
[8:42] and the supernatural Revelation and
[8:44] Vindication that God gave to brother
[8:46] Branham regarding the Seven Seals
[8:48] sermons
[8:50] but there's a brother in the message
[8:51] named Bill Rostrum and you can watch his
[8:54] videos proving that the cloud could not
[8:56] have been formed by a Thor rocket I've
[8:59] listened to the entire messages which
[9:00] was over six hours and all the
[9:03] scientific facts are proven and show
[9:05] that the shape of the cloud where it was
[9:07] located the time it appeared the density
[9:09] of the material required to make it all
[9:12] point to the fact that this was not a
[9:14] man-made Cloud it was not made by a Thor
[9:16] rocket it was a supernatural cloud
[9:20] another point is that brother Branham
[9:21] never said thus saith the Lord I was
[9:23] under the cloud when the photo was taken
[9:26] so we cannot jump to a conclusion and
[9:28] make every word of brother Branham thus
[9:29] say the Lord
[9:31] some people attacked brother Brandon
[9:32] because they say he wasn't there under
[9:34] the cloud when the photo was taken but
[9:37] to me that doesn't matter because
[9:38] brother Graham never said thus say the
[9:39] Lord I was under the cloud when the
[9:41] photo was taken a very important point
[9:44] is that the vision of the cloud and its
[9:46] fulfillment was in the name of the Lord
[9:48] it was prophesied on December 30th 1962
[9:51] and January 14 1963. here's the first
[9:55] quote saying it's in the name of the
[9:56] Lord let's listen to the quote
[10:04] I'm standing in an awful place if you
[10:07] but knew it
[10:09] remember I tell you in the name of the
[10:12] Lord I told you the truth
[10:15] in the next quote from January 14th
[10:18] President of vision sent him here of
[10:20] course that was the vision of the
[10:22] pyramid and constellation of seven
[10:24] angels let's listen to the quote
[10:27] I'm here in Phoenix tonight in the name
[10:31] of the Lord
[10:33] I would would not try to explain what's
[10:37] happened many of people that take the
[10:39] tapes be sure to get that one what time
[10:42] is it sir uh just before left home a
[10:45] vision secondly here because I don't
[10:48] know why I don't I'm not a tape salesman
[10:52] and I don't uh stress those things we
[10:55] get them and we gotta tape a business
[10:57] around the world way into the jungles
[11:00] and everywhere they have a little
[11:01] something you put in the ears they got
[11:03] and can tape it into the tape and stand
[11:05] there and translate that right into the
[11:06] language and it goes around the world
[11:08] and um but the one that I had that uh
[11:12] what time is it serves or is this the
[11:15] time sir some uh Saturday night three
[11:17] weeks ago at the church after all my
[11:20] life of seeing visions I've never had
[11:23] anything like this before in my life and
[11:26] I don't know what it is I'm just here
[11:28] but he sent me here I don't know what it
[11:32] means I've just I'm just here
[11:35] and here on March 24th 1963 brother
[11:38] Branham said the vision was fulfilled
[11:41] with thus saith the Lord let's listen to
[11:43] the quote
[11:51] I could truly say that to the best of my
[11:56] understanding and according to the word
[11:58] of God and the vision and the Revelation
[12:00] the interpretation thereof is thus saith
[12:04] the Lord
[12:07] another point I want to make is that
[12:09] brother Branham could have been under
[12:10] the cloud on February 28th by
[12:12] translation just like Philip God could
[12:15] have transported his physical body there
[12:17] for a moment and then brought him back
[12:19] or he could have been transported there
[12:21] by Vision like Ezekiel in Ezekiel 8
[12:24] verse 15 Ezekiel was taken to Jerusalem
[12:27] in the visions of God while sitting in
[12:29] his house in chaldia which was probably
[12:31] over 100 miles away ezekiel's Vision was
[12:34] not a translation like Philip because
[12:36] ezekiel's body stayed in chaldia
[12:38] Philip's body was literally translated
[12:40] to another area according to acts 8
[12:43] verses 39 and 40. and of course I've
[12:45] been mocked and made fun of because of
[12:47] these two possibilities that I believe
[12:48] in but at the same time they are
[12:50] biblical possibilities
[12:52] an important point is that brother Brown
[12:53] did not say the word cloud before the
[12:55] event but he did call This Cloud a snow
[12:58] white pyramid so brother Ram's accusers
[13:00] failed to recognize this saying there's
[13:01] no prophecy about it but there is
[13:04] he just didn't say the word cloud he
[13:06] said Snow White pyramid let's listen to
[13:09] the quotes
[13:10] I could see those angels those shaped
[13:14] back wings
[13:16] traveling faster than sound to travel
[13:18] they come from
[13:20] eternity in a split like a twinkle level
[13:23] enough
[13:24] The Bachelorette is a twinkle they were
[13:27] there
[13:28] I didn't have time to count I didn't
[13:30] have time or this look Mighty ones great
[13:35] powerful angels Snow White
[13:38] means sitting heads and they were
[13:42] and what it did I was caught up into
[13:45] this pyramid
[13:47] constellation
[13:49] and I thought now this is it
[13:53] I was dumbed all over
