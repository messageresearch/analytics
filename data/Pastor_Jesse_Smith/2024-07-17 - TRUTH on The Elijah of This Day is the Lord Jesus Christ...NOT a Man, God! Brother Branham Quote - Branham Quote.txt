TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] but the Elijah this day is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he is to come coring to Matthew 7 uh Luke 17:30 if the son of man is to reveal himself among his people not a man God but it'll come through a prophet greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to help Believers understand brother Ram's statement when he said the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ not a man God there's been many accusers of brother brandom who have Mis understood this quote and then misapplied this quote and they've tried to say that brother Brandon was exalting himself as the Lord Jesus Christ in this quote I believe that is an error and this video will prove their Folly this video will prove their misunderstanding of those statements by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that Jesus revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late William brandham a genuine prophet of God who lived from 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character the quote from brother brandham in question is from November 27th 1965 trying to do God a service without it being God's will I'm going to play a short portion of the video that many people are misunderstanding brother Ram says but the Elijah this day is the Lord Jesus Christ not a man God but it'll come through a prophet let's listen to the quote in question but the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus christall he is to come according to Matthew the 7 Luke 17:30 if the son of man is to reveal himself among his people not a man God but he come to a prophet so friends that was the quote you heard and this is one of the most misunderstood quotes of brother brandham so this video is devoted to showing four reasons why brother brandham was not saying he was a lord Jesus Christ but was emphasizing the Holy Ghost anointing the prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ before getting into those four reasons I want to say there's a similar video that might help you if you're wondering about another often misunderstood and misapplied quote it's the quotes where brother brandom said the word of Pentecost won't work for today I'll leave a link to this video in the description this is video number 90 it was called the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for this day defending the message twice brother Ram said this but what does it mean in the video you'll see it clarifies the meaning it proves brother brandom and the bible teach we still need the baptism of the Holy Ghost for today but brother Randon was talking about we need the prophetic Rapture related scriptures fulfilled in our lives in order for us to go in the first resurrection or the Rapture that's the point brother Brandon was making and and that's true we need more than the baptism of the Holy Ghost scriptures to go in the rapture we actually need the scriptures about the Rapture to be fulfilled in our lives we need to fulfill the scripture by the grace of God death will be swallowed up in life from 1 Corinthians 15 so brother R is making a great point we need more scriptures to be fulfilled if we want to go in the Rapture thank God we're born again thank God we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost as Jesus taught in Acts 1:6 and as they experien in Acts 2:4 but we need God to fulfill the scriptures of the Rapture in our lives to go in the Rapture so let's begin with reason number one on this quote of Elijah of today the first reason most people misunderstand this quote is because they miss the context the context is the emphasis brother places on the spirit of Elijah which is the holy spirit anointing a man and brother brandom says there is five times the spirit of Elijah comes so the first reason is brother random is simply saying the spirit of Elijah is equal to the Holy Spirit and the holy spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ in the spirit form so let's prove this I'm going to play the context of brother Ram's quote so we got to go up two paragraphs before brother Bram said this about the Elijah of the day is the Lord Jesus Christ in these first two paragraphs paragraph 210 and 211 brother brandham emphasizes Amos 37 and that's God revealing a secret to a prophet and then he emphasized Malachi 45 and six brother bram's Ministry Elijah Ministry and then he talks about how the spirit of Elijah came five times notice his emphasis is on the spirit of Elijah is to come too God uses that Spirit brother talking about the spirit anointing a prophet let's listen to those two paragraphs now anyone knows that Amos 37 said that God promised that he would never do nothing until first he revealed it to his Prophet through the church ages we've had reformers but promised by Malachi 4 that there would be a prophet in her land in the last days because it has to fit that pattern before the end time com before Jesus come the first Elisha come Elijah of Malachi 3 Matthew 11 says so if you can understand it this is who were spoken of behold I send my My Messenger before me now he's prophesied all theologians believe that that in the last day the spirit of Elisha is to come too it has to come five times God uses that Spirit Elisha Elijah John the Baptist and for the Gentiles church and then for the Jews Revelations 11 chapter that's God g r a c e f a i t h j e f u s the letter five can't stop at four it has to go to five now let's look at the main paragraph in question here it's paragraph 212 notice at the beginning of this paragraph brother Bram says that wasn't Elijah that was the spirit of God on Elijah Elijah was just a man so brother random is emphasizing the difference between the prophet the man and the Holy Ghost anointing that man brother BR was saying Elijah is just a man so in context brother Bram is saying I'm just a man but the spirit of God on me is the Holy Spirit the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Elijah is the holy spirit which is the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ so let's listen to that section before he says the Elijah of this day let's listen to the quote now he promised that so that sets the Bible just exactly to this day in the Sodom and Gore and Elijah was not that wasn't Elijah that was the spirit of God on Elijah Elijah was just the man now we've had Elijah and Elijah's popes and Elijah's manels and Elijah everything now that we've heard all the context now let's listen again as brother Ram says but the Elijah this day a lord Jesus Christ he's to come according to Luke 17:30 the son of man to reveal himself among his people not a man God but it'll come through a prophet and here's what the accusers Miss but it'll come through a prophet so God is going to to come through a prophet according to Luke 17:30 just like God came through Elijah and Elisha and John the Baptist and the Elijah of Revelation 11 let's listen to the quote but the Elijah this day is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he is to come according to Matthew 7 Luke 17:30 if the son of man is to reveal himself among his people not a man God but it'll come through a prophet now immediately following this quote of the Elijah this day brother Ram goes into how God doesn't send two Major Prophets at the same time I've always wondered about this quote you know God did send two Minor Prophets we'd say in the days of Hagi and Zechariah also Ezekiel and Daniel lived at the same time but they were in different locations so brother Bram never said thus sayith the Lord on that statement so it's not a major it's certainly a minor but notice brother Bram says God has to get one man under his control and then he says it again so he has with Elijah the spirit of Elijah he used that Spirit but the same God controlling it all the time to fulfill his word so again it's on the Holy Spirit controlling the Prophet The Prophet is not the holy spirit it's the spirit controlling the prophet let's listen to the quote now he never had two Major Prophets at the same time never in the world see no matter how much these two two heads can't it has to be one head God has to get one man under his control there's one God there was Father Son and Holy Ghost but one God over all notice he just used them offices so has it with Elijah the spirit of Elijah he used that Spirit but the same God controlling it all the time to fulfill his word now we can move on to reason number two now reason number one is enough to show that the accusers of brother brandom are wrong they're confused perhaps on purpose I don't know but reason number two is prophets can reference the scriptures they fulfill in the context brother R is referencing the scriptures that he's fulfilling he said Amos 3:7 Malachi 4:5 and6 Luke 17:30 a little later in the sermon brother Ram then mentions how he's an anti-type of elaser referencing Genesis CH 24 I believe if I'm not mistaken so before we listen to this El eer quote from the same sermon remember John the Baptist said in John 1:23 he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah so it is biblical for prophets to reference the scriptures they fulfilled just like John the Baptist and this is recorded in numerous places like Matthew 3:3 Mark 13 Luke 3:4 remember brother Ram said his ministry would be a prophet Ministry the Holy Ghost would come through a prophet just like John the Baptist just like brother Ram talked about John the Baptist fulfilling the first part of Malachi 45 and 6 turning the hearts of the fathers to the children so let's listen to this quote it's a little later in the sermon trying new to God of service brother cites Malachi 45 and6 and then he cites Genesis 24 El eer let's listen to the quote but now is the bride calling now it's when the Seven Seals has been opened now when the complete things that the reformers left has to be open and only Malachi 4 can do that because it take the Revelation straight from God to an individual to do so it can't come to a group never did one man that's what God promised in the shadows of the coming for his bride an El reason number three brother Ram's accusers misunderstand this quote is because they fail to see that brother random emphasized his Humanity in this very sermon numerous times the first is in paragraph 97 brother Ram said I'm getting to be an old man I know my time ain't too long I know that someday this heart's going to make its last beat and I'm entering into a great dark chamber they called Death so brother R is not saying he's the Lord Jesus Christ he's saying Jesus Christ was anointing him with the spirit of Elijah because he even can see he's going to die at some point and very fittingly he passed away less than a month later God must have shown him it was his time to go and he recognizes he wants to repent for every sin and he wants to be pure by the grace of God and wrap himself in the righteousness of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote I'm getting to be an old man and I know my time ain't too long if Jesus parries I I could stay a little while but I know that someday this heart's going to make its last beat and I'm entering into a great dark chamber there called death but when that comes I don't want anything to have to look back for and try to repent for I want when to come to that time to be clean and pure by the grace of God I want to wrap myself in the Robes of his righteousness when I enter there with this one thing in my mind I know him in the power of his resurrection and when he calls I'll come out from among the dead and live with him forever then there's another quote later in paragraph 302 brother Ram says after God sends a messenger they take his message because he just lives a little while so again brother Ram knew he was a messenger and he knew he'd just live a little while brother R was not saying he was a lord Jesus Christ he said he was anointed by the Lord Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote about Messengers live just a little while always it's right at the end of the church age where they got the things so the ecclesiastics so messed up until God sends a messenger and that's the message of that church a then they take his message because he used to lived a little while and God then they take his message and still are caring on with the rest of it they make a a denomination and then they come make another denomination another messenger take another one you all seen in my book it'll all be dra out in the seven Church Ages which he told me which I stand by as a witness to God to be judged at the day of judgment for it come from God not from my thinking another quote is from paragraphs 338 and 339 brother Bram is giving the altar call and he says how many want the Lord to fill your heart with his presence that you could live by God's presence and brother Ram says twice I cannot fill it God bless you I cannot fill it God can fill it so brother random again emphasizes his Humanity I can't fill you only the Holy Ghost can fill you let's listen to the quote the place is packed in Jam overflowed I couldn't call you to an altar there's no alar here to call you you but the alar is in your heart won't you let that little conviction that Jesus Christ is real move right up close today and call the rest of his body to you manger and your heart if he isn't there would you raise your hand in a sign to him saying Lord F me fill me with your word and with your presence that I might live by you father every head is bowed every eyes closed all across the nation raise your hands you're in the visible audience and out there to and I offer prayer for it's all I can do I cannot feel it God bless you I cannot feel it God bless you God can feel it God BL your hands going up here in the visible audience every feel it f me odar f me the fourth and final reason is that brother Ram never exalted himself as far as I know so some people have told me that brother Ram exalted himself on tape I've never seen that I've been studying brother Ram's quotes for over 22 years here's just a few examples of how brother Ram humbled himself in the seventh seal brother brandom says you forget anything about me I'm a sinner saved by grace not fit to live I ain't saying that to be humble there's not one sound thing at all in me let's listen to the quote we don't want never put a man in it you forget anything about me I am your brother a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth and I say that to be humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all here's another one from the anointed ones of the time July 25th 65 brother brandom shows again I wasn't the one that appeared down at the river I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells them that happens as perfect as they are like the video I have of six thus sayi the Lord's brother R told before the fact proving he's a prophet of God he said it wasn't what I knew it wasn't me it was the manifestation of the son of man it's not a man it's God you're not feeding on a man so I love this quote it's a very famous quote popular quote brother Ram saying it's not me I'm just surrendering to the spirit of God let's listen to the quote I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfectly are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I Just Surrender myself too that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was a manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was a mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man here's some other quotes I've read recently that have just blessed me so much in the serpent seed 58 brother brandham said if there's one thing I have to do to be saved Jesus Christ died in Vain by Grace I'm saved let's listen to the quote brother if there is one thing that I have to do Jesus Christ died in vain amen Grace I am saved and not by by myself but by the will of God and by the goodness of God in the next quote brother Ram said I'm always a failure but God never fails that's because brother Ram said I don't speak my words I speak his words let's listen to the quote say aren't you afraid of failing I'm never I'm always a failure he never does I don't speak my words I speak his that's the reason you're always right see that's the reason I asked the world show me one time it didn't come to pass show me one time of the thousands of things that he said not one time did it fail and it never will because it's God not man here's a final quote from 1962 and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy brother is praying to God and then in the prayer he breaks into rebuking Satan he said I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of God knowing I have no power within myself I haven't power to stop you but I do have authority of God's word as a servant to preach it and Duty bound to that Authority again brother R saying I have no power it's only the authority of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote Satan I'm against you because you're an enemy of my Lord You're an enemy of his word and I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of God as a mortal being knowing that I have no power within myself I have a power to stop you I haven't power to make any of these women clean up any of these men that's listen to this taper or wherever I have no way of making them clean up I'm powerless but I do have the authority of God's word as a servant to preach and Duty bound to that Authority near this policeman out here have power to stop a car but he has authority to do it in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God remember friends the elect cannot be deceived according to Matthew 24:4 if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect it's impossible for the elect to be deceived and of course this means deceived into blaspheming or deceived into leaving the truth we know there will be foolish virgins who don't accept the message but they the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ and they do not blaspheme the Lord Jesus Christ but those of us who want to be wise virgins with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we cannot be deceived when people try to slander brother brandham or or misapply his quotes or twist his quotes the spirit of God will guide us into all truth as Jesus Promised in John 16:13 remember friends the deception is greatest here at the end time that's according to 2 Timothy 3:13 evil men and seducers shall act worse and worse deceiving and being deceived so we need the Holy Ghost with the spirit of discernment to recognize the Antichrist Spirit call it out and just like brother Ram taught us prove all things saying you're not saying what Paul said you are therefore false that's why I love that video the Holy Spirit inspired me to make about 110 false doctrines of the denominational churches that brother brandham corrected and of course there's way more than 110 that's just what I found during that short study that video proves we have the true Bible Doctrine the original Bible doctrine that s St Paul taught we have it by the grace of God because the Lord Jesus Christ revealed it to his Prophet brother random to finish the mystery of God to restore all things according to Revelation 10:7 Matthew 17:11 here's what I find friends people that leave the message in my humble opinion it's my guess that they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough perhaps they don't call on God enough as brother brandham said when brother Bram indicted the denominations that's what he said that agrees with Proverbs 2: 3-6 the Bible says if you cry after knowledge and you lift up your voice for understanding and seek it as silver and search for it as hid Treasures then you'll understand the fear of God then you'll find the knowledge of God for the lord giveth wisdom think of this in relation to this video these people accusing brother Braham they didn't even go up one two or three paragraphs above the statement to get the context of what brother Brandon was saying nor did they read after that quote and then listen to the rest of the sermon where brother Rams emphasizing his humanity and how only Jesus Christ can fill a person so this shows these accusers don't dig down deep enough and get in the spirit of Revelation let's listen to the quote now what did they do they didn't know it today men walk ignorantly they don't know that's a truth they think it's some kind of a ISM they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation they don't pray enough they don't caught up on God enough and remember friends I'm not talking about all of brother Ram's accusers I'm only talking about some of them and I don't know which ones they are only they know which ones they are the ones that falsely accuse and don't dig down deep enough and study the word of God and don't pray enough again not all brother Ram's accusers only some of them friends if these accusers of brother Ram prayed more and got in the Holy Spirit they would know you can't add to the Bible and call God three persons you can't take away from the Bible and allow women to pre preach to men and allow women to cut their hair or men to grow their hair long and uncut if they got in the spirit of the Holy Ghost they'd see in the book of Acts there's five water baptism examples where they're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ or Lord Jesus or Lord but we know it's a revelation of the one name of God the Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost if they got in the spirit of Revelation they'd see the 110 or more doctrines that brother Ram straightened out by the power of the Holy Ghost in order to fulfill the scriptures Revelation 10:7 Matthew 1711 acts 320 and 21 Malachi 4:5 and 6 Luke 17:30 Amos 3:7 friends we're thankful that we've received brother brandham because brother man's Ministry was God's compassion on his people just like all prophets God sent were his compassion on the people according to 2 Chronicles 36:15 the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his Messengers because because he had compassion on his people but the sad part is in verse 16 a lot of the accusers of brother Brandon fulfilled this scripture but they mock The Messengers of God and despise his words and misuse His prophets so let's pray for those who accuse brother Brandon falsely father God I pray for the accusers of brother Brandon once again Lord God I just pray all those that can repent of their slander their reviling their evil words of calling brother brandom Antichrist Lord I just pray they would repent and be forgiven by the grace of of God lord father forgive them they don't know what they're saying Lord God so I pray for your mercy on brother R's accusers Lord God you told us to pray for those who despise us speak against us so I pray for those who mock your Prophet mock his bible-based teachings misuse his quotes misapply his quotes I pray they'll come to genuine repentance in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I ask it amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
