TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in my father's house is many kinds of mansions I don't believe that when we get to heaven that we will be just everybody look just exactly alike I don't believe it at all will be uh blondes or brunetts or or little or or all big or or all Giants I believe that God is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got Plains he's got got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it and he made the season summer winter spring autumn he made the season that show us he's a god of variety he made you in a variety some man are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic and others are fine others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people and in his kingdom see look at St Peter and judge him by Andrews see Andrew is that prayer Warrior just stayed on his knees all the time and the Apostle Peter was one of those fire brands that preached and and so forth and Paul was more scholarly like more of the uh like the prophet or something and set back and see Moses wrote the first four books of the Old which he wrote the Old Testament the rest of it was the laws and kings and Psalms and so forth and what someone wrote of the prophets but Moses wrote the laws the first four books of the Bible Genesis Exodus IUS of Deuteronomy and then Paul wrote the New Testament that's true Matthew Mark Luke and John wrote the acts of what taken place and so forth but Paul separated law and Grace and put it into its place see he was the writer of the New Testament he gave us the writings of the New Testament set in the word of God and order now notice many many mansions many kinds of mansions like many kinds of Hills like many kinds of rivers Springs Lakes they were here when you come here first because the kindness of your heavenly father place them here because some man likes mountains some people likes Waters some likes deserts so you see your coming he knew your nature and what you would be so he made it just the way that you could enjoy it oh I think that's a wonderful father see uh though that he made it like this I'm glad he made mountains I I like the mountains and I I I like that where the other so I can't stand all they must have empted his mortar box out there well he Ed out so I could enjoy it you see so then I like the PLS where I see a long ways well the two different Natures both of us Christians but the father knew that you would be here and prepared everything for you before you got here amen your first coming here he had it ready for you when he got here isn't that marvelous to think of what he done now now but remember these are only temporal gifts in pipe now we know that Moses in right building the Tabernacle in the wilderness or preparing it he said he made all things after the order of what he saw in heaven see so the Earthly things only express what the Eternal things are am and if this Earth that we live in today being so great as we love it love to live and breathe the air and see the flowers and things if if that if this year is the expression one that's dying is only expressing one that's Eternal when you see a tree struggling pulling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that when you see a man you're struggling to live somebody in a hospital or on a sick bed or in an accident struggling and the death rattles in their throat and pull in and crying and screaming for Life what does that mean there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that see it just doesn't do it now there are temporal gifts to us these things only expressing that there is one where it's the Eternal one that's what Jesus has gone away to prepare the Eternal one for us now they only express there's a greater of the same kind because these are a same kind Paul didn't have any trouble with the church of Ephesus they were schols they were men who understood but his trouble wasn't with the Roman Church and he exalts them before God and talks of their faith but the trouble he had was with k k was the place that that he had the trouble for they could not take the word each one wanted a sensation said why is it when I come among you one's got a tongue and one's got a Psalm and one's got a this and got a that some kind of a little foolish sensation he said you're Believers but you're not established now you know Paul wouldn't have preached things to the Corinthian Church and come back and preach the Ephesian Church something else and the Church of Thessalonians something else he preached the same gospel everywhere but that Ephesian church he could speak to them some of the great Mysteries that God had revealed to him down in Arabia he could preach predestination to him he could preach that to Corinthian Church well they still had they didn't have a on out their hands or some kind of sensation or something other they wouldn't believe what the word said they had to have a tongue or Psalm or some kind of little signs or something but Paul couldn't preach solid Doctrine to them I said this brother sister this may be the last sermon I ever preach but I'll be free of all man's blood listen brother Paul could not preached to them I said I found two things in my life I found the Fundamentalist Baptist Presbyterian I found the Pentecostal being a Baptist myself was already in the Baptist Church I turned them down to come be with you I love you and I've seen the ER of some of your some of your doings but I come with you so I could bring you back I went with you not because I'm turned out of a Baptist Church no sir find out if that's right or on I was not turned down the Baptist Church I chose to come with the Pentecostals cuz I love you and I come with you so I could try for the Bible to shake you from your aor and bring you back to a solid Faith God's unlovable word and The Hours come one of the American Pentecost is either on some kind of fantastic or ISM are so cold and starchy you can't touch them at all that's a you CL hardly in the middle of the road anymore and I notice I find that the Baptist people positionally and the Lutheran Presbyterian they are Bible scholars they positionally know where they stand but they got the word without the spirit they haven't got any faith with that word they got and new Pentecostals has got the faith but you don't know where you're standing if you know the Bible you wouldn't be so wishy-washy to fall for [Applause] everything you know that's true now if we could only get Pentecostal faith in Baptist theology or Baptist Theology and Pentecostal Faith would have it it's just like a man's got money in a bank and he don't know how to write a check and y's got ain't got no money to bank and he knows how to write a check that's just as foolish if we could only get the man that's got the money in the bank knows where he's standing by the word it would be settle we could draw dividends off of the glory of God by the death of Christ where signs wonders of the Bible would follow and we wouldn't need any of these kind of silly things you know that's the truth what's the use of accepting a counterfeit that the Devil Hand you when the skies and Heavens are full of blessings trying to give to you why would I eat out of a garbage can when I can eat at a nice table certainly and I laid that a whole lot on the preachers that's right they R old garbage can out somewhere and they every want to get like a bunch of cockroaches in the summertime that's right I don't say that for jokes this is not a joking place this this is where the word of God's going forth listen brother if you want to make roaches scatter just turn the light on one time why is it there bugs of Darkness it takes the light of the Gospel to show up things exactly right the light of the Gospel you believe in SS and wonders brother benam absolutely but it's got to be Bible SS and wonders because the devil's got a counterfeit in the last days to to see the People by and I'm on the lookout for it right I'm warning you stay clear the Corinthians they just could believe anything but they didn't believe the right thing but now look do you believe the Ephesian Church spoke in tongues certainly do you believe they had signs and wonders yes sir but they know how to play them they their pastors know how to S them and put the church in order but the Corinthians didn't each one had to do this and do that and do this and do that they had the gifts Paul said uh you got great gifts I'm thankful for them but they didn't know how to use them that's the way it is in the church today and it's one long enough till the devil's begin to slip in and give you some false signs and wonders could you imagine brother we need the Bible an oldfashioned St Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost the real true spirit of God
