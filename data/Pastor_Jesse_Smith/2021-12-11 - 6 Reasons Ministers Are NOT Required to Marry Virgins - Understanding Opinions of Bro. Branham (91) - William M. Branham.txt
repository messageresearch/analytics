Description:
Message believers must discern between the "human side" and "divine side" of God's prophet, William Branham, as he taught himself in his July 1963 sermon titled "He Cares, Do You Care?" Through the Holy Ghost's discernment,  we have at least 6 reasons New Testament ministers are NOT required to marry virgins, like Old Testament priests were required to do in Leviticus chapter 21. 

8 additional examples are shown--4 doctrines and 4 opinions--of how believers must discern Brother Branham's "human side" from his "divine side."

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ are new testament ministers or preachers required to marry virgins i believe the bible-based answer is no and this video will present six bible proofs for this understanding and friends i want to say i have no personal hidden agenda here my wife and i both met these purity requirements when we took our wedding vows on our wedding day also friends i preached a full sermon on this subject so i'll leave a link in the description if you'd like to listen to the sermon it's about one hour long let's begin with an introduction this introduction may be helpful for viewers who may have not heard this subject addressed before some message churches or churches who follow the bible-based teachings of god's prophet brother william branham teach that ministers must marry virgins according to one and only one sermon the marriage and divorce sermon from february 1965 while i respect both sides on this position scripturally i cannot see how the new testament requires ministers to meet this requirement i believe this statement by brother branham was his opinion as he never preached this teaching before or after february 1965. this is not a major doctrine in my opinion such as with salvation or the baptism of the holy ghost i believe it's a minor and as always i'm open to being corrected see divine healing is a minor you can never major with a minor see salvation is the main thing to the soul divine healing is just a minor thing he's a great man but he he just can't agree with me i appreciate that if there's sincerity though you don't just want these push over just have to grieve everything you say he's got his own convictions and he stands for i appreciate that and he's a good man of oh i am not a teacher a scholar at all but this man's full teacher and scholar but i i can't agree with him because i don't see him but it doesn't pertain to salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the lord before we listen to this quote from the marriage and divorce sermon consider how brother branham plainly taught that not every opinion of his was correct as he taught every teaching had to be proved true from genesis to revelation because that priesthood ended but god's urem today is god's word the word is his urine thunder war unto him that will add or take away anything from this bill this is god's eternal truth and in the day where there's people saying oh we don't need the bible it's been translated 15 times or more how do we know it's right so the heavens and earth passed away god's word will never pass away every doctrine and everything else of the bible that we have in the church must be based upon the word of god must come from the word not just one place but from genesis to revelation we have to say the same thing because we cannot base our thoughts upon one little scripture all the bible said in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established and we have numerous examples of brother branham's doctrines and opinions changing over the course of his ministry such as these eight examples i'll start with four doctrines first the godhead doctrine brother branham believed in three persons in the godhead for many years but later changed to believing in only one person the godhead truly we're not much in this world we're looked down upon but god we believe we're accepted in christ jesus and he in return has given us the holy ghost we love him that great third person of the trinity who burns through our hearts and we love him is of the devil i say that just say it the law [Applause] the court come from it come from the nicene council when the catholic church become in rulership the word trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the bible and four is three gods that's from hell there's one god in my hand second regarding the baptism of the holy ghost at first he believed the baptism and filling were two separate events but later after the seals were opened he believed it was the one and self-same event i never thought there's a person believe that like me until this morning i heard charles fuller as it's going down he believes too that the new birth is not the baptism the holy ghost the new birth is being born holy ghost is a baptism and all right when god has given you the true baptism of the holy spirit then the life of jesus christ is within you now that's true every theologian i have to admit that to be history it's a new birth you're born in you of the holy ghost in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the holy ghost it is one and the same what is the baptism with the holy ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ it is the new birth a third doctrine was man's three parts at first brother branham believed the human spirit or mind was the innermost part of man's being but later he believed it was the soul inside of the body is the soul and that soul is controlled by imaginations conscience memory reasons and affections that's the thing that controls the soul but the spirit is only has one sense the spirit oh let's get it the spirit has one sense that senses either dominates it is faith or doubt look here you are a outside person you have five senses that contacts that outside body god gave you five senses not to contact him your earthly home see speed or smelling here then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five outlets conscience love and so forth five outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contacts are physical your spiritual context is spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul that soul is that gene a fourth doctrine was on the first seal at first brother branham believed it was the holy spirit but later preached it was the antichrist spirit with thus saith the lord the sixth chapter deals with the with the white horse which was the holy spirit went forth conquering the conqueror then come the pale horse death and hell followed it and each one of those riders on the horses now after these things after this great destruction first frank forces the holy ghost across the earth conquering and to conquer then come the one in the great famine time measure wheat fruit paint two measures of barley for a penny and um so forth but don't put my oil in wine and then on down to the open these these seals oh is that white horse rider you're not blind you see who it is that antichrist and that deceitful spirit has gone now and crept in now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so i could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of god and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the law for opinions that seem to be human opinions only were first in 1951 brother branham believed billy paul was his promised joseph and that sarah was the baby he thought would be the promise joseph and of course we know later he had a son named joseph my little boy which is with us now soon be 16 years old even he seemed to be a good boy he reminded me him as very lovely little fellow but i talked to him about being baptized and making his public confession of christ he lived good and everything little fella but about a week after that i walked into the house and you come without me asking me anything said daddy i want to be a christian i want to serve the lord my joseph was right with me i didn't know it a little baby that i thought would be joseph a little girl and i called her sarah i'm thankful for her i love her with all my heart i had a boy and a girl in which way it went would be all right and i believe that god is calling my little boy back there who would be a minister of the gospel seeing the wisdom of god now i more understand if you ask god god will give you the desire of your heart i don't believe if the little baby would have been born to come up to the age to be a minister jesus will be here before that time i believe and god just hold it over on my little boy back there a second opinion is that brother brandon believed the usa would be totally annihilated before 1977 with only tree stumps remaining and we know this prediction didn't come to pass and it wasn't spoken with thus saith the lord and it'll a great woman will rise up and be president or something like that in the nation and then there will come a total annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out and that i predict now this is not the lord saying this the other about the woman in his is the lord but i predicted in 19 and 30 33 that the world would be total annihilation before 77. so i didn't know then if they had something that could annihilate it like they got now but i seen the nation and total annihilation just stumps and trees and things like that so it's on its road third brother branham believed we could not have another generation after his generation because of mental retardation increasing among school children in arizona and of course we've had another 40-year generation so we see how this was his opinion look at this teenage insane well we haven't i told you the other day they've taken analysis there of the schools in arizona where i live and eighty percent of those children in school is mentally what will their children be we and a fourth opinion was brother branham believed martin luther king jr would lead millions into a death trap into a revolutionary war type of battle over school segregation in the south but he said i could be altogether wrong in my thought about martin luther king and of course there was no death trap where millions died in the south during martin luther king jr's lifetime one thing i that brother martin luther king will certainly soon wake up he loves his people there's no doubt but if you just only see where his inspiration what good would it do if you went to school in a million of you laying the other dead wouldn't just be going to school just the same not for for hunger if it was for something other slaves a man to be a martyr to give his life for such a cause a worthy cause and that would be a worthy cause but just to go to school and i i don't see it i don't think the holy spirit's agreeing with him at all on that it's got the people all worked up in a bunch of valley who you see just just like hitler did over in germany led him right into a death trap and precious germans and they're laid by the billions or millions piled up on top one another that's exactly the same thing and remember i'm on tape you see that maybe after i'm gone that's exactly what's going to happen now precious people die down there like flies starts a revolutionary both white and colored will fight again and die like flies and walk y'all it's all over a bunch of dead people did you prophesy that there be a million negroes uh killed did you just announce that there would be this happening now see i've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the law even divisions or anything no i just was talking about martin luther king on this great disaster that they're having in the south with the the colored people and that's reason i see that not that there is any uh any prophecy concerning it i have nothing on it from the lord and be sure now if i say anything from the lord like that to tell you it's always i'm speaking now but when he speaks i say it's not me it's thus saith the lord and i can't say it until he tells me i could be altogether wrong in my thought about martin luther king i don't know i can't say that's just my opinion now with this understanding of how brother branham's doctrines and opinions could change let's listen to brother ram's quote about marriage requirements for ministers in marriage and divorce 1965. now let us in view of these vindicated truths of god search a little further if you want to all right now this may hurt just a little bit till we get down to the bottom of it let me just go to show you the truth of it there is no minister that can marry a widow do you know that you want to read that all right you get leviticus leviticus 21 7 and ezekiel 44 22. and they'll show you that the priesthood was not to marry a woman has been touched by man this type is of the virgin bride of jesus christ because they handled the fire of god the priesthood aaron's sons we haven't got time to read it all and get out the noon we got 20 minutes yet and that was aaron's sons that handled the the fire of god so they could not marry a woman that had been touched by another man the unchanging god said soul they could not marry another woman at a woman being touched by a man showing in type here if you want to see it that's the church of the living god is purely unadulterated the word of god and now the denomination has been handled by man solomon can marry any woman that wasn't married he could marry any woman he wanted to a priest could marry only a woman that was a virgin solomon like david he married what was her name abigail which is a man called a fool he had a nice wife and he died and abigail was married to david he was a king not a priest thing so he he married but a priest could not do that because it touched a god a woman of his wife that was already been some man's wife so that shows the urgency of the church of the lord jesus christ of bridal had to be unadulterated the word not one word missing nowhere certainly could you imagine a correct bride one breast all from the other something another wrong you know that's not going to be the bride of christ she's perfect she's everything the word not one word failing anywhere no one reason some message believers cling to this quote is because they know the quote at the end of the sermon for brother branham in which he says the sermon was thus saith the lord all the way through but we have to understand this statement carefully to mean only the revelations in the sermon where thus saith the lord let's listen to this quote oh are you happy i told you the truth thus saith the lord all the way through now let us stand and raise our hands as we sing it again i love him i love him for his grace i love him for his mercy i love him for his word and the word of the lord came to the prophets [Music] friends be careful not to misinterpret this thus saith the lord's statement not every word in the marriage divorce sermon was from god and here's one clear example regarding jacob in which brother branham said he had at least a dozen wives but according to genesis jacob had only four wives and he promised his father-in-law he would not take other wives let's listen to this jacob quote and reference the scriptures look at jacob out of whom come the patriarchs he had at least a dozen wives he married two sisters and had concubine wives besides that common-law women that he lived with and those patriarchs was born right out of those concubine women is that right see you have to make the word run smooth oh i got pages on them if a clergyman ever questions me on it and then we get together we can talk but surely if he's got any spirituality at all he can see right here it's the truth there's no question to him friends in genesis 31 verses 47 through 55 laban makes jacob swear he won't take any more wives than the four he already had in genesis 32 verse 22 and chapter 35 verses 23-26 and chapter 46 verses 5-27 these verses seem to show jacob's twelve sons by these four wives and we can't find jacob having a dozen or more wives anywhere else in scripture new testament minister requirements here are 20 requirements for new testament ministers and there could be more please notice only two pertain to his marriage which include one having one wife first timothy three verse two and two his wife being a christian in subjection to the word of god and her husband's rule in their household according to first timothy 3 verses 4 and 5. as a new testament author paul was never led to the holy ghost to write a merry virgins only requirement for new testament ministers from leviticus chapter 21. perhaps paul wasn't led to do this because paul's own i blemish according to galatians 4 verses 13 through 15 would have disqualified him from being a new testament minister according to leviticus 21 20. let's look at the full list of 20 new testament minister requirements first in 1st timothy 3 verses 1 through 7 there are 15 requirements for a pastor or minister and i found five other requirements as well so number 16 is the minister must be born again or have a burning bush experience a 17th one is the minister must be called by god to be a minister the 18th 19th and 20th requirements are from the church age book where brother branham says all ministers must strive to have the same requirements as saint paul which the 18th would be the power of the spoken and written word the 19th would be fruit of the ministry and the 20th would be being completely true to the word of god six reasons why i believe ministers are not required to marry virgins in the new testament reason number one this teaching is based upon one sermon only friends if you add up the total amount of time brother branham talked about this doctrine it was a total of two minutes and 14 seconds if my calculations are correct so this idea about new testament ministers and the marriage requirement is not expounded upon at all either before this sermon or after this sermon i cannot find one additional quote from brother branham before or after this sermon that support this teaching friends consider that the bible says in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word should be established so only have one witness of this teaching and it's in one sermon so i do not believe this teaching meets the requirements the bible establishes for doctrine brother branham said he was up all night preparing for this sermon so it seems perhaps he didn't have enough time to study these scriptures out all the way and just shared what he had found now i'll hope that the audience will not be nervous and i'm trusting to god that i will not be nervous or i've had a tremendous night a lot of strain or i realize that the things that i say this morning will be held against me in the day of the judgment and i i couldn't sleep and i know if i don't say them it'll be held against me in the day of judgment what's interesting is that there is one quote on the other side of this topic in which brother branham tells a woman who is guilty of prostitution that she would make a very good wife to a preacher let's listen to the quote and she said i they sent me to the good shepherd's home which is a catholic institution she said i served my time there three or four years and turned to be a catholic said when i come out of this institution said then i was a catholic i started right back at drinking and prostitution again the law picked me up and gave me four years in the woman's penitentiary when i was in there i served well and kept away from the things because i was i could not find the things in there to drink and so forth said when i come out it didn't do me one bit of good i joined another church i've joined two three churches and said now they finally declared me insane and i said have you ever thought of getting married and have a loving kind husband and a little babies like all real mothers long or real women like to have little ones like see your little girl pushing her little baby cart with a little dolly in it and you know of course she used to be a mother too that's reshaped the mother or something and i said you're in your heart you are telling me that you love to be mary and have a husband i said you're a beautiful girl you'd make a real sweetheart for some little tired preacher of god she said i couldn't promise to preacher no one else nothing in this condition mr branham i said but i want to tell you something your sins may be as black and smutty as hell but i know there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath the fuzzers all their jokes and stains it can make you as white as snow so because we don't have two or three witnesses in the scripture or quotes from brother branham plus a quote on the other side of this issue i do not believe it can be proven to be a genuine doctrine from the holy scriptures reason number two no new testament scripture teaches this doctrine the word virgin is used 14 times in the king james version of the new testament and it was never used in the requirements for a minister of the gospel or preacher and again i could add those 20 requirements into this section but i've already covered that so you're aware of those truths and you're aware that the new testament never commands ministers to marry virgins reason number three the levitical priesthood was forever changed when brother branham taught this subject he was referencing leviticus chapter 21 which shows the physical requirements of priests and the high priest now to balance this subject out i do agree that god can just use one scripture from the old testament and require in the new testament such as deuteronomy 22 verse 5. but if we look at the full context of leviticus 21 we'll find that these priesthood requirements are either types and shadows or are done away with first of all leviticus 21 verses 5 and 6 priests could not make baldness on the top of their head nor shave off the corner of their beard nor make any cuttings in their flesh so if this was applied to the new testament any minister who cut his hair and made it bald would be disqualified and any minister who didn't have a fully grown out beard would be disqualified as well verses 7 and 8 and leviticus 21 say a priest could not take a wife that is a or profane nor shall they take a woman put away from her husband recall that the new testament marriage requirement is that the husband must be the husband of one wife according to 1st timothy 3 verse 2. according to leviticus 21 verse 9 the daughter of a priest who played the or profaned herself and father should be burnt with fire and of course we cannot find that requirement in the new testament for ministers nor would we want to because we would hope the spirit of conviction would come upon the daughter and she would repent of her sins and be saved and god would wash her life clean through the blood of jesus christ in leviticus 21 verses 18 through 21 we have a most compelling argument to show how these old testament requirements cannot be applied to the new testament for the bible says the priest cannot have the blemish of blindness or blemish in his eye if this blemish in the eye requirement was also required in the new testament paul would be disqualified because he had a blemish in his eyes according to galatians 4 verses 14 and 15 and galatians 6 verse 11. and of course we know paul was not disqualified from being a minister he was a prophet teacher pastor in ephesus and he was the church age messenger to the age of ephesus more details from leviticus 21 could be shown but i'll stop there and hope these a few examples have proven to you that the levitical requirements are not applied to the new testament ministers and this is because hebrews chapter 7 verses 11 and 12 state that the priesthood being changed we're no longer under the levitical aaronic priesthood we're under the priesthood of the lord jesus christ who's a priest forever after the order melchizedek reason number four the obvious double standard among message people i have talked to it seems there's a double standard and that is that only the women are required to be virgins and not men but that would break the old testament scripture and it would also break the type of jesus christ and the church jesus christ was never married so he was a virgin and a preacher is the anti-type of christ the husband also any levitical priest as well as any jewish man could not be impure when they married this is according to deuteronomy 22 verses 28 through 30. the man had to marry the first woman that he laid with also in deuteronomy 22 verses 22 through 27 it was death for a man to lay with another man's wife and it was death to rape a woman and also leviticus 21 verse 15 says the high priest could not profane their seed so some who uphold this doctrine that ministers must only marry virgins contradict the word of god when they let men who are not virgins preach the word of god friends please know that god would desire that all would be virgins when they marry according to first thessalonians 4 verse 3 that's his perfect will but of course god allows people to choose their own choice through free more agency and god gives them his permissive will but it's clear that many who hold this doctrine and require women to be virgins should also require the men to be virgins as well if they're going to be consistent reason number five this doctrine can be a form of legalism saint paul teaches that injecting any legalistic teaching into the gospel is 11 and 11 leavens the whole lump in other words one small false doctrine will lead to many more false doctrines causing the believers to become in bondage to many sins galatians 6 13 shows paul addressing the issue of circumcision and he said the evil men brought in circumcision that they made glory in your flesh i think it's clear some message ministers have used this teaching of ministers marrying only virgins to glory in their own flesh they've used it to hurt sisters and brothers and prop themselves up as being holier than other people when the new testament never commands this requirement i believe those who make this a legalistic requirement the wrong scripture the scripture of those who have left the message as brother branham taught in the ephesian church age in chapter 3 in the church age book brother bran taught that the false vine was rulership by man and they took control over the people instead of doing it god's way and they came out with a holy priesthood standing between god and the people they went right back to the old aaronic system but see what was happening back there that false vine was getting a hold and it was teaching that rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed it taught a control over the people but instead of doing it god's way they simply took authority invested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between god and the people they went right back to the old aaronic system so i believe that's what some ministers have done around this message they've made this minister's mary virgins doctrine such an important issue that they've hurt many people in the process of it and created their own legalistic aeronic system and personally i've seen two men who are legalistic regarding this teaching make massive errors in their ministry the first one ultimately rejected holiness and other teachings and has now left the message and some of his children don't even believe in god anymore the second minister is still a pastor here in the usa and through this legalistic requirement has hurt many people in his church causing a church split he's broken up marriages and families and allowed them to remarry which is against the word of god as he basically lords over the heritage and in fact this minister was the only minister in my 17 years of preaching who interrupted me when i was preaching on this subject my prayers go out to these ministers and all ministers who make this a legalistic teaching many men and women have suffered under a legalistic application of this teaching and so we're praying for god's people to be healed and delivered from legalism reason number six the blood of jesus christ changes the virginity requirement to spiritual virginity and forgives all sexual sin hebrews 8 6 says the new covenant or new testament is a better covenant established upon better promises additionally hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21 say jesus's blood the blood of the everlasting covenant will make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen this better blood covenant that makes christians perfect in every good work is clearly seen when comparing the requirements for old testament priests versus new testament preachers old testament priests had at least 22 requirements in leviticus chapter 21 while new testament ministers had about 15 requirements in 1st timothy 3 verses seven plus the five i observed in other scriptures notice the contrast between the requirements old testament requirements were mainly natural requirements such as marrying virgins not making your head bald not being lame or blind and so forth new testament requirements are mainly spiritual and deal with a man's spiritual character such as being vigilant apt to teach patient and blameless through the revelation of jesus christ we now see god has changed the virginity requirement from a natural virginity to a spiritual virginity this simply means the soul of the new testament preacher and his wife soul are born again by the baptism of the holy ghost the born-again soul of the christian has a spiritual seed that cannot sin as first john 3 verse 9 teaches whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god this soul virginity is the new requirement for a minister and his wife and it's also the same requirement for every believer to be a part of the bride or wife of jesus christ as the following scriptures show second corinthians chapter 11 verses 1-3 would to god you could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband then i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent begot eve through his subtilty so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ notice paul said it was possible for the church members at corinth to become spiritual chaste virgins yet this was the same church that had a man sleeping with his stepmother in 1st corinthians chapter 5 had adulterers fornicators homosexuals and even child molesters and paul wrote that all their sins could be washed away by the blood of jesus christ through the holy spirit in first corinthians chapter 6 verses 9-11 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate or child molesters nor abusers of themselves with mankind or homosexuals nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god so through these two portions of scripture we see the truth that jesus blood forgives all sexual sins if truly repented of and makes true believers chaste virgins in their souls unto god but of course those who committed sexual sins are not virgins in their flesh as they still have to live with the consequences of their previous sins but when forgiven and filled with the holy ghost they become virgins in their souls if the blood of jesus christ washes away the sexual and spiritual sin from his church his bride and makes her a virgin to him who is the word then surely god can do this with a new testament woman who would be married to a new testament preacher notice the type jesus christ is the husband a virgin husband and he calls us his virgin bride yet many of us have been impure sexually before marriage and yet he forgives us of that and still calls us a spiritual virgin and on the spiritual level many of us have been handled by a man-made denomination and yet jesus is able to draw us out of those man-made creeds and organizations and call us virgin by the word of god so if jesus can make his own wife who is many times a natural and spiritual fornicator a virgin to him how much more could jesus christ forgive a natural preacher and his wife of their sexual sins and make them virgins to him as well of course we know the physical act of fornication will have consequences and the physical act can never be done away with but the fact is jesus christ's blood can forgive those mistakes and make the heart and soul of the believer a virgin to jesus christ just as the scriptures say notice romans 7 verses one through six the bible says we were previously married to the law but then says that we should be married to another even christ so this proves all believers were once manhandled by another system whether the jews under the law or the gentiles who had the law written in their hearts according the book of romans in other words all people were either married to the law or a life of sin before coming to jesus christ but the bible says we've died to our first husband and now we're married to jesus christ and paul says we're chaste virgins to christ in fact in the sermon spoken word is original seed brother branham said christ the word is virgin so the bride will have to be just like him virgin by the word the true bride like nerdy will have a virgin wound for the bride of the word which is christ when christ the word comes to the bride shall be the same as his the virgin by the word in closing i hope this video has been a blessing to you this subject has been on my heart for many years i'm hoping the holy spirit will take this word to where it needs to be delivered so people can feel forgiven they can have a true understanding of the word of god and they can be assured that they meet the requirements for a new testament minister and his wife may god help your soul my soul and every soul who loves jesus christ to be washed by the blood of jesus christ and that we can be presented as chaste virgins unto jesus christ at the marriage suffer the lamb if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
