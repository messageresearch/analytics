In this updated version of our video from 2015, Part 1 now covers how obeying the Bible command about wearing modest clothes is not legalism. Instead, obedience to God's command for modest clothes is an act of love for God. This video then covers the first two Bible guidelines for modest clothing, which are (1) cover all body areas of nakedness and (2) wear one thick layer of clothing or multiple layers of thinner clothing. Part 2 of this series will cover the third and fourth Bible guidelines for modest clothing.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] y especially to avoid sexual attention most people consider teaching on a topic like modesty as a form of legalism but that could not be further from the truth because the definition of legalism is excessive adherence to law or formula we must teach modesty because the Bible teaches it just like we must teach that murder and drunkenness are sins we are not being legalistic just because we teach followers of Jesus Christ to observe the commandments of Jesus Christ in fact we are actually fulfilling the Great Commission of Jesus if we are teaching his disciples to observe all his commands Matthew 28:20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world Amen the real issue with people disliking teaching about modesty is that they do not want to to obey the Bible but Jesus said your love for him was displayed by your obedience for his words John 14:21 he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them is he that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him if you love Jesus you will gladly obey the Bible in this case with your modest clothing if you love sin you will reject the Bible's teaching on modesty and dress immodestly before we teach the four guidelines we must show how the Bible defines areas of the body some areas need no explanation such as the head feet hands and arms what needs explanation are the following areas to summarized modest clothing that God desires based upon the Bible We Believe Christians today should wear clothes that fully cover the breasts belly loins and thighs at all times the breast belly loins and thighs are all body areas considered nakedness in the sight of God according to Genesis 3: 7 11 and 21 and Isaiah 47: 1-3 the four Bible guidelines we will present help ensure that Christians will be modestly dressed covering all nakedness if they obey the Bible's teaching these four Bible guidelines are cover all areas of nakedness wear one thick layer of clothing or multiple layers of thinner clothing wear gender specific clothing wear clothes like Jesus's Heavenly garments loose long and flowing the four Bible guidelines the first Bible guideline is we should wear clothes that cover areas that God considers nakedness the following scriptures teach this guideline line Genesis 37 and 21 Isaiah 47: 1-3 the Bible teaches that Adam and Eve were both naked without clothes before sin entered the world as soon as they partook of the forbidden fruit it caused them to sew fig leaves together to make aprons which were loin coverings the loins refer to the reproductive parts around the area of the hips loins are nakedness in Hebrew the word apron means loin covering Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons but once the voice of God came walking in the garden and acknowledged Adam and Eve's sin God made coats of skins to fully cover more of their nakedness Genesis 3: 21 unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them we learn that God covered the nakedness of Adam and Eve with more clothing than Adam and Eve have chosen for themselves God's ideas about modesty are always better than man's ideas as we will see God usually asks humans to wear more clothing than they think they need we know this because the word coats means a long shirt-like garment like a tunic that covers from the breast down to nearly the feet Adam and Eve at first chose to cover only the loins the hip area with the reproductive parts but God chose to cover nearly the entire body including the breasts belly loins and thighs in Isaiah 47: 1-3 Isaiah told the virgin daughter of Babylon or the people in the city of Babylon that God would allow their nakedness to be uncovered which included bare legs bare legs in this context meant uncovering the thighs uncovered thighs are nakedness so we learn from God's holy word that men and women should cover their breasts belly loins and thighs with clothes because any of these body erors left uncovered are nakedness in the eyes of God the second Bible guideline is where one leg lay of thick clothing material or wear multiple layers of clothing the following scriptures teach this guideline Genesis 3:21 Matthew 540 and John 21:7 in Genesis 3: 21 we learn that God clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skins these skins were probably lamb skins because we believe the first animal sacrifices on Earth which were done by God himself would have most likely been Lambs as a foreshadowing of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ who is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world according to John 1: 29 lamb skin clothing would be very thick this clothing would not reveal the form of the body making it very modest clothing an easy example of the thickness of this type of clothing is to picture in your mind sheering or sheep skin boots God wanted thick clothing that did not reveal the form of the body as you read later in the Bible you will find Jesus talking about layers of clothing in Matthew 5:40 as he spoke about coats and cloaks Matthew 5:40 shows that God desired either one thick layer of clothing or multiple layers of thin clothing probably to accommodate the different weather patterns on the earth the Greek word for coat means a tunic an undergarment usually worn next to the skin the coats Jesus spoke of were thin shirt-like garments like tunics worn next to the skin these coats were the undergarment layer like underwear today but with much more cloth or material than our modern-day underwear because it was like a very long t-shirt the cloak was the outer garment or outside garment worn on top of the tunic or coat undergarment another word for cloak is robe which is like the Scarlet robe the Roman soldiers put on Jesus in Matthew 27:28 this robe or clo cloak was an outer garment usually worn over the tunic the Greek word for cloak means the upper garment the cloak or mantle it is important to note here that God considered a person to be naked when they took off their outer garment or their cloak or robe if the outer garment was taken off then the person would be viewed in only their thin undergarment clothing this guideline is seen in numerous places in the Bible but most easily seen in John 21:7 therefore that disciple whom Jesus Lov saith unto Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he GED his father's coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea the Greek word for coat means an upper garment a frock which fishermen used to wear at their work the Greek word for naked means clad in undergarments only the outer garments or cloak being laid aside notice that Peter had his outer garment off the Fisher's coat and the Bible recorded Peter as being naked the way to apply this today is for us to be sure we have at least two layers of clothing on or have one thick layer of clothing on and abstain from walking around in our underwear in public this would include not walking around in public or even appearing in public beaches in bathing suits as most bathing suits and shorts only have one layer of thin clothing which is certainly immodest according to the Bible swimsuits almost always reveal the form of the body which is immodest and almost always expose areas of the body that God considers nakedness please continue viewing part two of this video series God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
