[33:36] galatians 3. like to look at um
[33:39] you know on sunday i said i'd like to do
[33:41] the bride tree but i think i'll save
[33:42] that for sunday
[33:44] i just today i kind of felt led to study
[33:45] on the blessings and cursing so i'd like
[33:47] to look at that again tonight
[33:49] so look at blessings and cursings part 2
[33:51] tonight
[34:00] so let's go to galatians chapter 3.
[34:09] verse 6 galatians 3 6 and uh i don't
[34:12] have slides yet but i'll have slides
[34:14] later uh
[34:14] keisha just a moment
[34:24] as you're turning there galatians 3 6
[34:26] i'd like to
[34:28] just share a quick testimony from ben
[34:30] narad you know we were he and i were
[34:32] texting my wife and i and him were
[34:33] texting in
[34:34] about the weekend and my wife said what
[34:37] a great
[34:37] time we had with ben's mom and
[34:41] brother ben said i was real happy she
[34:42] got to come with me
[34:44] he said i've been bragging about all of
[34:46] you no we don't want to brag
[34:48] but we know he means it in love but
[34:51] she told me coming home i wish i live
[34:53] closer i love that church
[34:55] and those people he said you folks made
[34:59] a wonderful impression on my mom thank
[35:01] you for that
[35:01] they've been through a lot with message
[35:03] churches throughout the years
[35:04] it was special to me to hear her say
[35:06] that
[35:08] so i know a little bit about what
[35:09] they've been through so i just want to
[35:11] encourage everybody thanks for your love
[35:13] to sister no rod i know when she walked
[35:15] in here she was really nervous and
[35:17] stoned really straight faced and by the
[35:19] time she was leaving she was i don't
[35:21] know if you saw when she was leaving
[35:22] she was asking if my girls could come
[35:24] and stay the night with her
[35:26] she could take some of my little girls
[35:27] home but she was so happy so thank you
[35:30] for the love
[35:31] you know that everybody pours out upon
[35:32] our our friends and our guests
[35:35] i just thought that was a nice testimony
[35:36] i thought my
[35:38] i thought the the saints would be happy
[35:39] to hear that by god's grace
[35:42] so let's uh go to galatians 3 6.
[35:46] i'd like to read a little bit of a
[35:47] portion tonight uh
[35:49] galatians 3 6. i'll read for a little
[35:52] while and then i think we'll
[35:53] read a few verses together by god's
[35:56] grace so let me read here
[35:58] verse six even as abraham believed god
[36:00] and it was
[36:01] accounted to him for righteousness
[36:06] know ye therefore that they which are of
[36:08] faith now that of course means
[36:09] assurance or trust and we know it means
[36:12] revelation
[36:13] so you can trust god right the same are
[36:16] the children
[36:17] of abraham all right so we look at
[36:20] ourselves not just as children of
[36:22] our parents but we are actually the
[36:24] spiritual children of abraham
[36:26] the father of faith and the scripture
[36:29] for seeing that god would justify the
[36:31] heathen through faith
[36:32] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[36:36] so god preached the gospel to abraham
[36:38] the good news
[36:40] saying in thee shall all nations
[36:43] be blessed verse 9
[36:47] so then they which be of faith are
[36:49] blessed
[36:50] with faithful abraham verse 10.
[36:55] for as many are i'm sorry as are
[36:58] of the works of the law are under the
[37:00] curse for it is written
[37:02] cursed is everyone that continueth not
[37:04] in the things
[37:05] which are written in the book of the law
[37:07] to do them
[37:08] verse 11 but that no man is justified by
[37:12] the law and the sight of god it is
[37:14] evident for
[37:15] the just shall live by faith
[37:19] and the law is not of faith but the man
[37:21] that doeth them
[37:22] shall live in them
[37:25] let's read 13 together okay let's read
[37:28] that together on three
[37:29] one two three christ hath redeemed
[37:32] us from the curse of the law being made
[37:36] a curse for us for it is written
[37:39] cursed is everyone that hangeth
[37:42] on a tree verse 14
[37:46] that the blessing of abraham might come
[37:48] on the gentiles
[37:49] through jesus christ what is the
[37:51] blessing that we might receive the
[37:53] promise of the
[37:54] spirit the holy spirit through faith the
[37:58] blessing is
[37:58] the baptism of the holy spirit because
[38:00] peter said it's to you
[38:02] your children to them that are far off
[38:04] even as many
[38:05] as the lord our god shall cause god's
[38:07] still calling today
[38:08] then the blessing of abraham is still
[38:10] for us today amen
[38:12] may god add his blessings to remus word
[38:14] you may be seated praise god
[38:15] and occasionally i think you can switch
[38:16] over here
[38:20] so let's look at part two by god's grace
[38:30] tonight
[38:35] also real quick i did talk with the uh
[38:37] uh the missionary brother maxwell lee
[38:38] this week it's been a couple years since
[38:40] we talked but
[38:41] i just want to update you on him he's
[38:42] doing really well and uh they've been
[38:44] going down into
[38:45] south america and um i'm sorry they
[38:48] haven't i'm sorry this year they haven't
[38:49] because of covet
[38:51] he said but they're still getting
[38:52] reports back that the saints that uh
[38:54] they won to the lord the last year
[38:56] are still moving on he said they're
[38:58] getting many more baptisms and
[39:00] devils are being cast out and the sick
[39:03] are being healed and
[39:04] and even a chief even a chief of a tribe
[39:07] uh was baptized in the name of the lord
[39:09] jesus christ and his testimony was this
[39:11] his testimony was he read the bible and
[39:14] saw every time the apostles baptized
[39:17] it was in the name of jesus christ and
[39:18] he said lord if this is true
[39:20] send me a preacher that's preaching it
[39:22] and a year later
[39:23] this missionary that i was talking to
[39:25] came to him and
[39:26] told him the true baptism and baptized
[39:28] him in the name of the lord jesus christ
[39:30] so
[39:30] just awesome to see that the book of
[39:32] acts is still going on praise god
[39:34] we got our little part here in akron but
[39:36] it's still spreading
[39:38] out around the world and we can do our
[39:39] part to pray we can do our part to send
[39:41] missionary offerings
[39:43] and spread the gospel of jesus christ
[39:46] praise god
[39:47] so let's uh let's look and see how jesus
[39:51] took again
[39:52] all the curses okay so we read galatians
[39:54] 3
[39:55] and we saw how all the curses
[39:59] were placed upon jesus jesus became
[40:03] a curse for us praise god so
[40:06] if you have your bibles let's go to
[40:07] deuteronomy 21
[40:09] uh verse 22 and 23. i'd like to read
[40:13] these again
[40:16] just to kind of refresh ourselves with
[40:19] these what a
[40:20] beautiful uh promise we have through the
[40:23] cross
[40:24] of christ deuteronomy 21
[40:28] 22 and 23
[40:35] now verse 22 deuteronomy 21 22
[40:39] and if a man have committed a sin worthy
[40:41] of death
[40:42] and he be to be put to death
[40:45] and thou hang him on a tree
[40:49] his body shall not remain all night
[40:53] upon the tree pardon me
[40:58] but thou shalt in any wise bury him that
[41:02] day for he that is hanged
[41:04] is a curse of god
[41:07] that thy land be not defiled which the
[41:10] lord thy god giveth thee
[41:12] for an inheritance okay so the bible
[41:14] clearly says
[41:16] any man that's hanged is cursed now we
[41:19] know jesus
[41:20] was hanged unworthily right uh he didn't
[41:23] do anything wrong but he became the
[41:25] sacrifice
[41:26] the curse for us and i believe brother
[41:28] simon preached that one time i thought
[41:30] it was a good thought
[41:31] that's the reason uh the bible said
[41:33] jesus could not be
[41:34] holden of death because he wasn't worthy
[41:37] of death
[41:38] right so death couldn't hold him but
[41:41] instead
[41:42] as an innocent sacrifice he took all the
[41:44] payment
[41:45] for death right and then because of that
[41:48] he could conquer over death
[41:49] i believe the bible said it was not
[41:51] possible
[41:52] that he could be held of death let me
[41:55] look that up real quick
[41:56] um
[41:59] i believe it was acts chapter 2.
[42:03] so let me see if i can uh yes it was
[42:05] acts 2 24. you don't have to turn there
[42:07] but the bible said whom god hath raised
[42:09] up having loose now isn't that
[42:11] interesting remember
[42:12] jesus said the bible said god raised
[42:15] them up but jesus said
[42:16] destroy this body and i'll raise it up
[42:20] well who raised up jesus which person of
[42:21] the trinity raised them up
[42:23] was it the second or the first it was
[42:26] neither it was the one and only praise
[42:27] god
[42:28] whom god hath raised up because jesus
[42:31] was god's image
[42:33] having loosed the pains of death
[42:36] because it was not possible that he
[42:38] should be holding of it praise god
[42:41] so death could not hold jesus it could
[42:44] not be a
[42:44] power overcome over him it could not
[42:47] master him
[42:48] it could not rule him it could not take
[42:51] seas of him
[42:52] praise god it could not hold him in his
[42:54] hand amen
[42:55] it could not continue to hold him
[42:58] because
[42:58] he was he didn't fit the qualifications
[43:01] right
[43:02] he didn't die uh worthy of it he died
[43:05] unworthy of it because he was a worthy
[43:07] sacrifice praise god
[43:09] and so because of that he was still
[43:10] cursed to be on a tree
[43:12] but he was actually taking our curse in
[43:14] other words you and i
[43:15] shouldn't be hung on a tree praise god
[43:17] you and i deserve to be hung on a tree
[43:20] but jesus took the curse and the bible
[43:23] said
[43:24] that jesus took the curse uh so that the
[43:27] blessing might come upon
[43:28] us through justification right and
[43:30] through the promise of the holy spirit
[43:33] amen so when we believe in jesus
[43:36] sacrifice
[43:37] the bible says that the blessing of
[43:39] justification
[43:40] comes upon us we're justified we're
[43:42] declared righteous
[43:44] from our sins and the blessing of
[43:45] abraham comes upon us amen
[43:48] let's read isaiah 53 because that's
[43:50] another
[43:51] great chapter i'll never get tired of
[43:54] reading this chapter by god's grace
[43:57] because it tells all that jesus did for
[43:59] me isaiah 53
[44:01] 1.
[44:06] and let's recall these i looked at them
[44:08] a few weeks ago but let's just look at
[44:09] them again
[44:10] verse one who hath believed our report
[44:12] and to whom is the arm
[44:14] of the lord revealed i'm sorry what the
[44:18] world is going on here
[44:21] sorry i'm turning this thing off i tried
[44:23] numerous times to turn
[44:24] turn off the wi-fi and everything
[44:26] forgive me verse 2 for he shall grow up
[44:29] before him as a tender plant
[44:31] and as a root out of a dry ground and
[44:34] has
[44:34] no form nor comeliness and when he shall
[44:37] when we shall see him there's no beauty
[44:40] that we should desire and i was telling
[44:41] a brother on
[44:42] uh youtube on the comments that he was
[44:44] saying was was jesus darker and what
[44:47] what kind of long hair did he have and i
[44:48] said well he was probably dark skinned
[44:50] right because most
[44:51] most jews were dark skinned with black
[44:54] hair
[44:56] i said he probably was but i said that
[44:58] really doesn't matter doesn't matter
[44:59] really how long his hair was
[45:01] but one thing about it is it wasn't
[45:03] beautiful it wasn't pretty right
[45:05] he wasn't an attractive man as we'd say
[45:07] he had no beauty that
[45:09] anyone even the common person the lowest
[45:11] of persons the poorest of persons
[45:13] he had nothing beautiful about him that
[45:15] we would desire now think about the
[45:17] people you know
[45:18] which one would you say there's no
[45:19] beauty in that person
[45:21] which one would you say right you and i
[45:24] we're common people we're middle class
[45:25] people
[45:26] which one of us would look at a lower
[45:28] class and say that person is really not
[45:30] beautiful at all
[45:31] we don't like to use the word ugly but
[45:33] which one we say
[45:34] they're probably not very beautiful
[45:36] right that's jesus jesus
[45:38] had no beauty that we would desire him
[45:40] and yet all the cartoons and the
[45:41] pictures make him so beautiful
[45:43] right yeah jesus had none of that
[45:47] he was despised and rejected a man a man
[45:50] of sorrows and acquainted with grief
[45:53] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[45:56] he was despised and we have seen him not
[45:58] you know there's many times church this
[45:59] summer
[46:00] i would go to certain stores and i'd see
[46:02] beggars right and we you know
[46:04] we have that first we have that first uh
[46:07] feeling to kind of
[46:08] like shun them right we want to hide our
[46:10] faces from them
[46:12] well this is what jesus says now we want
[46:14] to have an open heart right to
[46:16] uh we want to have an open heart to
[46:17] beggars and to the sick and everything
[46:19] like that but
[46:19] you know most of us feel that way when
[46:21] we see somebody who's really down and
[46:23] out
[46:23] they're dirty we know they're uh uh we
[46:26] know they're a beggar
[46:27] you know we want to hide our faces from
[46:29] them well that's what everyone did with
[46:31] jesus
[46:33] he had no beauty and we want to hide our
[46:34] faces we wouldn't want to look at him
[46:38] think about that the most holy person
[46:40] right the most god in flesh the most
[46:42] worthy person became so ugly
[46:46] that we didn't want to look at him
[46:49] now we're getting look we're looking at
[46:50] the curse right he became the curse
[46:54] so think about that next time you don't
[46:55] want to look at somebody may god help us
[46:58] to remember the reason we don't look at
[46:59] them maybe is because they're cursed
[47:02] and we could help them out of the curse
[47:04] right
[47:05] as we saw we all saw this we helped a
[47:07] couple of young brothers a few years ago
[47:09] get out of curses for a while
[47:10] but then they chose to go back in them
[47:11] remember we helped them get out for a
[47:14] while and they admitted to being out of
[47:16] it and
[47:16] being blessed but then they fell back
[47:18] into curses
[47:20] so that's real right it's real if
[47:22] somebody will come and believe us if
[47:24] someone will come and believe the bible
[47:25] as we're pointing the bible
[47:26] then they will come out of the curse
[47:29] right and they'll be blessed
[47:31] as long as they stay in the blessing as
[47:33] long as they choose to be in the
[47:34] blessing
[47:37] but see they hid our faces he was
[47:39] despised and we have seemed him not
[47:41] surely hath bore our grease and carried
[47:43] our sorrows yet we didn't seem him
[47:45] stricken smitten of god
[47:47] and afflicted but he was wounded for our
[47:50] transgressions
[47:52] see he was bruised for our iniquities
[47:55] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[47:57] him and with his stripes
[47:59] we are healed praise god see all of our
[48:02] transgressions all of our iniquities
[48:04] everything that we deserve to be cursed
[48:06] with he took the curse
[48:08] praise god but he was
[48:12] verse 6 all we like sheep have gone
[48:14] astray we have turned everyone to his
[48:16] own way
[48:16] and the lord laid on him the iniquity of
[48:19] us all
[48:21] so as he as he hung on the tree god put
[48:24] all the curses on it think about that
[48:26] all the curses of adultery all the
[48:29] curses of
[48:31] of lying and stealing and murder think
[48:33] about i've been reading through the old
[48:34] testament think about all those murders
[48:37] the bible said all all the men and women
[48:39] that got killed by the edge of the sword
[48:41] that was common in the bible i've been
[48:42] reading
[48:43] i'm in kings right now the edge of the
[48:45] sword and this group died and that
[48:47] all the curses of all those were laid
[48:49] upon jesus
[48:51] as he hung on that tree because the
[48:52] bible said curse it is he
[48:54] that hangs on a tree and church it
[48:57] wasn't a surprise
[48:58] he knew he was going to get it he knew
[49:00] he had to face it and he tried to pray
[49:02] to avoid it
[49:03] but yet he humbled himself may god help
[49:05] us to humble ourselves right
[49:08] to serve god and not be afraid of
[49:11] maybe the pain that we're going to have
[49:12] to go through but trust god
[49:14] that if god called us to it then he can
[49:17] bring us through it praise god
[49:19] amen my all this iniquity
[49:23] was laid upon the iniquity of king saul
[49:25] right the iniquity of david the
[49:27] adulterer of david
[49:28] all the iniquity of noah's drunkenness
[49:30] that how you can name all of them right
[49:32] the iniquity of adam and eve right all
[49:34] their iniquity could be laid upon christ
[49:37] and the best part is be paid for praise
[49:39] god
[49:40] amen and be forgiven this is what jesus
[49:44] did
[49:45] taking all of the curses think about
[49:47] that the
[49:48] the mistake of eve being deceived into
[49:50] adultery and receiving the wrong seed
[49:52] all that was placed upon jesus he took
[49:56] her punishment
[49:58] we serve a mighty god hallelujah amen
[50:02] he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he
[50:04] opened not his mouth he's brought as a
[50:06] lamb
[50:06] to the slaughter as a sheep before her
[50:08] shears is dumb so he opened not his
[50:11] mouth
[50:12] even with your curses on him even with
[50:15] my curses on him he never complained did
[50:17] he
[50:18] he not he opened not his mouth he didn't
[50:21] complain
[50:22] and he even told the women he said don't
[50:23] cry for me he said
[50:25] he said be concerned about yourself
[50:27] right because one day this city will be
[50:29] encompassed about
[50:30] and pray that your flight be not in
[50:31] winter praise god
[50:33] he was so unconcerned about himself that
[50:36] he was even in the midst of carrying the
[50:38] cross
[50:40] or maybe having help at that time by
[50:41] simon the cyrene
[50:43] he was able to feel the pain for other
[50:45] people praise god
[50:46] may god help us to feel pain for other
[50:48] people right to put ourselves in other
[50:50] people's shoes
[50:52] that's what jesus did to take our curse
[50:54] that we might have this blessing today
[50:56] amen hallelujah
[50:59] he was taken from prison and from
[51:01] judgment who shall declare his
[51:03] generation
[51:03] for he was cut out i'm sorry cut off out
[51:07] of the land of the living for the
[51:08] transgression of my people
[51:10] was he stricken he was cursed he was he
[51:13] made his grave with the wicked
[51:14] and with the rich in his death because
[51:16] he had done no
[51:18] violence neither was there any deceit in
[51:20] his mouth
[51:21] now look at that church he didn't speak
[51:23] any deceit yet he got slapped in his
[51:25] mouth
[51:26] look at that his mouth was perfect but
[51:28] he got smote in the mouth
[51:30] didn't deserve it that's a curse
[51:34] when he when he was holy they treated
[51:36] him like he was unholy
[51:38] right and yet we say evil things and god
[51:41] is merciful to us
[51:43] right we don't get cursed we may get
[51:45] punished but we don't get cursed
[51:47] like long term we say we're sorry and
[51:50] that's the end of it now we may have to
[51:51] suffer a little bit of the consequences
[51:54] but yet he his mouth was perfect yet he
[51:57] got slapped across the face
[52:01] my verse 10 yet it please the lord to
[52:05] bruise him
[52:06] he hath put him to grief and when thou
[52:09] shalt make his soul an offering for sin
[52:12] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[52:14] his days
[52:15] and his plea and the pleasure of the
[52:16] lord shall prosper in his hand
[52:19] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[52:22] and shall be satisfied
[52:24] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[52:25] servant justify many how many justified
[52:28] tonight
[52:29] amen you ought to say amen loud to that
[52:31] how many justify tonight
[52:33] amen because of jesus because he took
[52:36] your curse
[52:37] you're declared righteous amen it's a
[52:39] legal action it's a legal exchange
[52:42] praise god
[52:43] god gave him our our curses and god gave
[52:46] us his righteousness amen he said
[52:49] justify many for he shall bear
[52:52] their iniquities bear their curses
[52:56] therefore will i divide him a portion
[52:58] with the great he's worthy amen
[53:01] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[53:03] strong because he hath poured out his
[53:05] soul unto death
[53:06] and he was numbered with the
[53:08] transgressors and he bear the sin of
[53:10] many
[53:10] and made intercession for the
[53:13] transgressors hallelujah
[53:15] amen now look at that even with
[53:18] even with all the curses on him look at
[53:20] that church that proves his body had no
[53:22] sin in it
[53:24] even with the curses on him he said
[53:25] father forgive them
[53:27] they don't know what they're doing even
[53:29] with curses on him
[53:30] he prayed a blessing to them praise god
[53:34] think about that even though he's cursed
[53:37] he still blessed them
[53:38] and he interceded for them in the midst
[53:41] of his being cursed
[53:43] hallelujah and church sometimes some
[53:46] people have
[53:46] find it so hard to just say something
[53:48] nice about somebody they're upset with
[53:50] right because of a complex or because
[53:53] they did this to me
[53:55] years ago months ago weeks ago they
[53:58] can't even say one nice thing about that
[54:00] person and yet here's jesus
[54:01] all of your sin all of my sin on him and
[54:04] he still prays father forgive them
[54:06] that are that are crucify me they don't
[54:09] know what they're doing
[54:11] see look at that amazing love that's the
[54:13] kind of love that we need praise god
[54:15] that's the kind of love we should
[54:16] manifest to other people praise god
[54:19] amen he still interceded
[54:23] the bible said intercession for the
[54:26] transgressors
[54:27] intercessions for malachi smith praise
[54:29] god amen
[54:31] intercessions for lydia smith and acacia
[54:33] smith
[54:34] right to making intercession for you and
[54:37] i
[54:37] praise god he took your curse
[54:40] that you might be blessed amen
[54:43] hallelujah
[54:44] thank you jesus now look did he did he
[54:47] take all the curses
[54:49] yeah the bible said the lord laid the
[54:50] iniquity of all of us on him
[54:53] so that we can be blessed praise god now
[54:57] i want to finish deuteronomy 28 curses
[55:01] right we read a few
[55:02] so let's take your bibles let's go to
[55:03] deuteronomy 28 and i could use some
[55:05] readers malachi lydia casey if you got
[55:07] your bibles
[55:08] it's okay if you don't but if you got
[55:09] him i could use some reason
[55:12] i would like to finish this chapter you
[55:14] know i've been listening to
[55:15] preaching and teaching about blessings
[55:17] and curses and
[55:18] i think it'd just be great to read
[55:20] through all these
[55:22] just to have an idea remember church
[55:23] they had to listen to all these curses
[55:26] and blessings
[55:27] before they went in the promised land if
[55:28] you remember they had to admit
[55:30] as they crossed over jordan after they
[55:32] crossed over jordan they had to admit
[55:34] these are all the blessings
[55:35] and all the blessings will come upon us
[55:38] if we obey
[55:38] but if we disobey what's going to come
[55:41] on them
[55:42] all the curses when they cross the
[55:45] jordan they had to admit that
[55:47] remember that the remember the stones
[55:48] they had stones they had
[55:50] they had i think the hand of god wrote
[55:52] the law in those stones
[55:54] and they had to pass through and they
[55:55] had to accept god's blessings but also
[55:58] god's cursings
[56:02] all right so deuteronomy 28 now remember
[56:04] this quote
[56:05] uh really you don't need to chase the
[56:07] blessings what you need to do is meet
[56:08] the conditions
[56:09] god will take care of the blessings amen
[56:12] so i want to we did this already we read
[56:14] deuteronomy 27 a couple of sundays ago
[56:17] uh and we we looked at even verse 44
[56:20] 48 but i'd like to read 15 on and just
[56:23] kind of
[56:24] just kind of get an idea these are the
[56:25] conditions which will bring
[56:27] uh curses in the land
[56:31] okay so when we start with lydia lydia
[56:33] are you there hon can you read why don't
[56:35] you read 15
[56:36] down to 20.
[57:22] every aspect of their lives would be
[57:24] cursed
[57:25] right the bible said all that their hand
[57:27] would do they'd find a curse in it if
[57:29] they didn't
[57:30] diligently hearken unto the ways of god
[57:35] their body their animals their jobs
[57:38] right
[57:38] everything they set their hand to do
[57:40] they would see a a curse in it
[57:42] they wouldn't see a blessing they'd see
[57:44] a curse malachi
[57:47] 21-26 please
[58:05] they shall persuade
[58:18] the lord shall cause you to be smitten
[58:19] before thy
[58:32] all right now you see we begin with
[58:34] pestilences right so that's like the
[58:36] coronavirus and i
[58:37] i made that little observation jesus
[58:39] prophesied pestilences would come
[58:41] remember that observation this uh
[58:44] coronavirus mostly
[58:45] affects the elderly and that would be
[58:47] the generation
[58:48] that actually turned down revival in
[58:50] 1956 it would actually be that
[58:52] generation
[58:53] that could be well i don't think it's
[58:55] coincidence but some people might say it
[58:56] is i just thought of that
[58:58] a few months ago but then also no doubt
[59:01] it affects the body
[59:02] and then the weather as well in the land
[59:06] and then uh their battles they would
[59:09] lose
[59:11] and look at america losing all these
[59:13] wars not really winning hardly anything
[59:15] right since uh world war ii they've
[59:18] hardly won anything is that right malka
[59:21] do you think of anything that they have
[59:22] won
[59:27] okay just some small operations yeah we
[59:30] know like with uh
[59:32] vietnam and different ones korea they
[59:34] never even won a war
[59:35] they just went in there and then left
[59:39] so interesting to see that now uh 27 in
[59:42] case you want to read something
[59:44] are you able to okay do you want to read
[59:46] 27
[59:47] through 30.
[1:00:25] thou shalt be
[1:00:38] amen god had done such
[1:00:42] great things think about that he brought
[1:00:43] him out of egypt he's part of the red
[1:00:46] sea
[1:00:46] he brought him through the wilderness he
[1:00:48] brought him into the promised land
[1:00:51] i'm sorry he brought him to the borders
[1:00:52] of the promised land right and here he's
[1:00:54] telling them
[1:00:55] these blessings you get if you obey but
[1:00:58] these are the curses you get
[1:01:00] if you disobey it goes down to their
[1:01:03] marriages right they're animals
[1:01:05] uh uncurable diseases
[1:01:09] all right verse 31 thine ox shall be
[1:01:12] slain before thine eyes and thou shalt
[1:01:14] not eat thereof thine ash shall be
[1:01:16] violently taken away from before thy
[1:01:18] face
[1:01:18] and shall not be restored to thee thy
[1:01:21] sheep shall be given unto thine enemies
[1:01:23] and thou shalt
[1:01:24] have none to rescue them thy sons and
[1:01:26] thy daughters shall be given
[1:01:27] unto another people and thine eyes shall
[1:01:30] look and fail with longing for them all
[1:01:32] the day long
[1:01:33] and there shall be no might in thine
[1:01:35] hand no strength
[1:01:36] the fruit of thy land and all thy labor
[1:01:38] shall a nation which thou knowest not
[1:01:40] eat up
[1:01:41] and thou shalt be only oppressed and
[1:01:43] crushed always so look no victory
[1:01:45] now think about that church all the
[1:01:47] people that come to message churches
[1:01:49] and do they have the victory see we
[1:01:51] should have the victory
[1:01:53] if anybody has the victory it's those
[1:01:54] that are obeying the word of god praise
[1:01:57] god
[1:01:57] doesn't mean they're not without
[1:01:59] challenges right or battles
[1:02:01] but they're gaining the victory praise
[1:02:03] god but those under these curses are
[1:02:05] constantly the bible said being overcome
[1:02:10] no might in their hand they're only
[1:02:12] being oppressed and crushed
[1:02:13] always always losing they can't get the
[1:02:16] victory over
[1:02:17] temptation they can't just just can't
[1:02:18] get the victory that's a sign of a curse
[1:02:21] because of disobedience look at that
[1:02:24] verse 34
[1:02:25] so that thou shalt be mad for the sight
[1:02:27] of thine eyes which thou shalt see
[1:02:29] look anger see anger anger despair look
[1:02:33] at all these curses
[1:02:35] uh bodily incurable diseases defeat on
[1:02:39] every side
[1:02:41] my and all this could be avoided
[1:02:45] if they just had reverence for god's
[1:02:47] word
[1:02:49] simple respect right simple respect
[1:02:52] just don't set up idols in your house
[1:02:54] right
[1:02:56] simple things very very simple things to
[1:02:58] do
[1:02:59] just worship give god a tenth right and
[1:03:01] then give god an offering
[1:03:03] just simple things talk to your children
[1:03:05] constantly about the word of god
[1:03:08] very very very simple things there's so
[1:03:11] much that
[1:03:12] could have been avoided if the people
[1:03:14] would have just obeyed diligently and
[1:03:16] hearken under the voice of god
[1:03:21] look at verse 35 the lord shall smite
[1:03:23] thee in the knees and in the legs with a
[1:03:25] sore botch that cannot be healed
[1:03:26] from the soul of thy foot unto the top
[1:03:28] of thy head
[1:03:30] but like how brother graham said i want
[1:03:31] the holy ghost from the top of my head
[1:03:32] to the soul of my foot
[1:03:35] amen praise god the curse comes upon the
[1:03:38] top of the head to the bottom of the
[1:03:40] feet for those who despise the word of
[1:03:42] god
[1:03:45] verse 36 the lord shall bring thee and
[1:03:47] thy king which thou shalt set over thee
[1:03:49] unto a nation which neither thou nor thy
[1:03:51] fathers have known
[1:03:52] and there shall thou serve other gods
[1:03:55] wood and stone and thou shalt become an
[1:03:57] astonishment a proverb and a byword
[1:04:00] among all nations whither the lord shall
[1:04:02] lead thee
[1:04:04] thou shalt carry much seed out into the
[1:04:06] field and shalt gather but little in
[1:04:08] for the locusts shall consume it
[1:04:12] thou shalt plant vineyards and dress
[1:04:14] them but shalt neither drink of the wine
[1:04:16] nor gather the grapes for the worm shall
[1:04:18] eat them
[1:04:19] thou shalt have olive trees throughout
[1:04:21] all thy coasts but thou shalt
[1:04:22] not anoint thy self with the oil for
[1:04:25] thine olive shall cast
[1:04:27] his fruit thou shalt beget sons and
[1:04:30] daughters but thou shalt not enjoy them
[1:04:32] for they shall go into captivity all thy
[1:04:36] trees
[1:04:36] and fruit of thy land shall the locust
[1:04:39] consume
[1:04:40] the stranger that is within thee shall
[1:04:42] get up above thee very high and thou
[1:04:44] shalt come down very low
[1:04:45] look at that there everybody else seems
[1:04:47] to be blessed and you're going down seem
[1:04:49] to be cursed
[1:04:52] he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not
[1:04:54] lend to him he shall be the head and
[1:04:55] thou shalt be the tale church we ought
[1:04:57] to consider a blessing
[1:04:58] when we can lend people some money right
[1:05:01] or food and really many times we
[1:05:04] shouldn't ask for it back jesus said
[1:05:07] verse 45 moreover all these curses shall
[1:05:10] come upon thee
[1:05:11] and shall pursue thee and overtake thee
[1:05:12] till thou be destroyed because not unto
[1:05:15] the voice of the lord thy god
[1:05:17] to keep his commandments and the
[1:05:18] statutes which he commanded thee
[1:05:21] and remember this beautiful verse down
[1:05:22] to 47 because thou serve us not the lord
[1:05:25] thy god with joyfulness
[1:05:26] and with gladness of heart for the
[1:05:28] abundance of all things
[1:05:30] there therefore shalt thou serve thine
[1:05:32] enemies which the lord thy god shall
[1:05:33] send against thee
[1:05:35] in hunger and thirst and nakedness and
[1:05:37] in want of all things
[1:05:38] and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy
[1:05:40] neck until he have destroyed thee look
[1:05:42] slavery
[1:05:43] total addiction instead of complete
[1:05:45] freedom they're complete slaves
[1:05:47] oh he whom the son is set free is free
[1:05:50] indeed amen
[1:05:52] but these can't say that these this
[1:05:54] group can't say that
[1:05:56] because they've they they've cursed or
[1:05:58] they've cursed god they've rejected the
[1:06:00] very thing
[1:06:01] that brings them victory and because of
[1:06:03] that they're cursed
[1:06:07] lydia can you read uh
[1:06:10] talks about the nation that will come
[1:06:14] basically eat the fruit of all their
[1:06:16] lands and the fruit of their body
[1:06:20] go down to verse 53 lydia creed 53
[1:06:25] uh to 50.
[1:06:30] why don't you go to 53 to 60. i'll give
[1:06:32] you a lot of reason because you're a big
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:44] girl
[1:07:40] continuously
[1:07:51] those are some very uh detailed and
[1:07:54] very sad punishments and i read about
[1:07:57] them uh just last week in the second
[1:07:58] king
[1:07:59] uh that literally happened in israel now
[1:08:02] that was over
[1:08:03] uh 500 years after after this
[1:08:06] that these some of these curses would be
[1:08:08] so compounded after year and year
[1:08:10] of idolatry and disobedience and
[1:08:12] wickedness
[1:08:13] that they would stoop to the very depths
[1:08:15] of these curses
[1:08:17] and that would be a sign that they were
[1:08:18] cursed they were not diligently
[1:08:20] seeking god they weren't serving god
[1:08:23] with joyfulness and gladness of heart oh
[1:08:25] i'm so glad
[1:08:26] i can come to church and smile and
[1:08:28] praise god and be happy
[1:08:30] because it's a joy to serve god it's not
[1:08:32] a it's not a grievance it's a joy to
[1:08:34] serve god amen
[1:08:36] but for them it wasn't it was a it was a
[1:08:39] pain to serve god it was a bother to
[1:08:41] serve god
[1:08:42] for them and so god let them uh
[1:08:45] suffer the punishments verse 61
[1:08:48] also every sickness and every plague
[1:08:50] which is not written the book of this
[1:08:52] law them will the lord bring upon thee
[1:08:54] until thou be destroyed look at that
[1:08:56] even the things that aren't in here
[1:08:57] you're going to inherit
[1:08:59] right because of disobedience
[1:09:02] verse 62 and ye shall be left few in
[1:09:04] number whereas
[1:09:06] ye were as the stars of heaven from
[1:09:07] multitude because thou wouldest not
[1:09:10] obey the voice of the lord thy god what
[1:09:13] does it all come down to
[1:09:14] obedience joyful obedience right obeying
[1:09:17] god even when it's hard
[1:09:18] but doing it with love in your heart
[1:09:20] knowing that god has a purpose
[1:09:22] he may not show me now but someday he'll
[1:09:23] show me and i know god cannot make a
[1:09:25] mistake
[1:09:26] god plans everything perfect perfectly
[1:09:28] and his purposes are
[1:09:30] sure and amen hallelujah thank god
[1:09:34] verse 63 and it shall come to pass that
[1:09:36] as the lord rejoiced over you to do you
[1:09:38] good and to multiply you
[1:09:40] so the lord will rejoice over you to
[1:09:42] destroy you and bring you to naught and
[1:09:44] ye shall be plucked from off the land
[1:09:46] whither thou goest to possess it
[1:09:49] and the lord shall scatter thee among
[1:09:51] all people from one end of the earth
[1:09:53] even unto the other
[1:09:54] and there thou shalt serve other gods
[1:09:57] which neither thou nor thy fathers have
[1:10:00] known even wood and stone
[1:10:02] i'm just going to stop real quick i was
[1:10:04] looking at the news recently and i
[1:10:05] forget which country was in africa
[1:10:08] just made a deal with israel and israel
[1:10:10] is going to pay the money
[1:10:12] to fly all the israelis from that
[1:10:14] african country
[1:10:15] back to israel in other words we still
[1:10:18] have saints coming back to israel praise
[1:10:20] god
[1:10:20] there are still some of the 144 000
[1:10:23] coming back praise god that's what we're
[1:10:25] waiting on praise god
[1:10:27] we're waiting on on all the 144 000
[1:10:30] to get in israel we're still waiting on
[1:10:31] the message to get to every nation
[1:10:34] and when everybody gets in their place
[1:10:36] then jesus will get in his place
[1:10:38] at that meeting in the air praise god
[1:10:40] amen but everybody
[1:10:41] has to be in their place hallelujah
[1:10:45] verse 65 malcolm kingdom 65
[1:10:49] to the end please
[1:10:56] the lord shalom
[1:11:24] foreign
[1:11:31] all right thank you quite a quite a
[1:11:34] chapter isn't it church
[1:11:36] you start off with uh how many blessings
[1:11:38] start off with blessings in the first 14
[1:11:40] verses and the rest of the chapter
[1:11:42] goes through all the cursings as we read
[1:11:45] through there now
[1:11:46] i want to um remember let's just
[1:11:49] summarize the blessings again
[1:11:50] just summary if you obey god diligently
[1:11:53] he would exalt you
[1:11:54] right because he exalts the humble oh
[1:11:57] you have
[1:11:58] spiritual reproduction physical
[1:12:00] reproduction
[1:12:01] you have health victory you're the head
[1:12:03] not the tail and you're above
[1:12:05] not below all those blessings just for
[1:12:08] lovingly coming to church and serving
[1:12:10] god every day every
[1:12:11] every time you go to church and happily
[1:12:13] praising god in your house and the
[1:12:15] church said
[1:12:16] oh that's all just for just wanting to
[1:12:19] please god
[1:12:20] with a loving heart a glad heart a
[1:12:22] joyful heart god promises you all the
[1:12:24] blessings amen
[1:12:26] he said so much you can't even contain
[1:12:28] it i'll pour out the blessings
[1:12:29] from heaven now we just read through the
[1:12:32] list i didn't get a chance i wanted to
[1:12:34] list all of them i didn't got a chance i
[1:12:35] just thought we'd read it
[1:12:36] now i want to bring this up here before
[1:12:38] we move on i was listening to a minister
[1:12:40] of preaching he's uh
[1:12:42] and he had many years of experience with
[1:12:44] blessings and curses
[1:12:45] he gave another independent list so
[1:12:48] i think a lot of these though can be
[1:12:50] connected to deuteronomy 28
[1:12:53] mental breakdowns have you ever heard of
[1:12:54] a mental breakdown i've known pastors
[1:12:56] have had mental breakdowns
[1:12:58] that could be a curse because someone
[1:13:00] wasn't diligently obeying
[1:13:02] the word lord and remember we just read
[1:13:04] that sorrow of mine remember that sorrow
[1:13:06] of mind it was right there in verse
[1:13:07] 65 a trembling heart no ease
[1:13:12] your heart's not stable you're nervous
[1:13:14] all the time
[1:13:15] heart trouble heart disease sorrow of
[1:13:18] mind
[1:13:19] so this minister uh of the p
[1:13:22] the preacher passed away but he said
[1:13:24] mental breakdown chronic sickness
[1:13:26] especially if they're headed
[1:13:27] hereditary because the the blessings go
[1:13:30] from generation to generation
[1:13:32] but also the curses go from generation
[1:13:34] to generation
[1:13:37] also when doctors cannot find a cause
[1:13:39] for a sickness
[1:13:41] it could be a curse it could be
[1:13:43] something somebody else did or something
[1:13:45] they did down the line further down the
[1:13:47] line female trouble we saw this baroness
[1:13:50] was a curse
[1:13:50] right not not being able to have babies
[1:13:52] was a curse miscarriage tendency
[1:13:55] that's all what deuteronomy says
[1:13:58] yeah so female trouble divorces and
[1:14:01] family breakups remember the bible
[1:14:03] talked about
[1:14:03] your children will be taken from you
[1:14:05] sold in slavery
[1:14:07] see divorces uh that's a cause of a
[1:14:10] curse i think about my family
[1:14:13] i feel like this church i feel like my
[1:14:14] parents are under a curse i'm going to
[1:14:16] be praying that god will show me
[1:14:17] so we can help deliver them from the
[1:14:19] curse right
[1:14:21] i believe that with all my heart
[1:14:24] uh family breakups and everything like
[1:14:25] that but i thank god that although you
[1:14:27] know my parents may be under it i know
[1:14:29] our
[1:14:29] uh the siblings have overcome it by the
[1:14:31] blood of jesus christ
[1:14:32] i believe that with all my heart because
[1:14:34] we're all still married we all have
[1:14:35] families and everything like that
[1:14:37] god's blessing is upon our lives
[1:14:39] financial insufficiency remember he said
[1:14:41] you'll plant all kinds of seeds but
[1:14:43] you'll hardly reap anything
[1:14:46] church you know you know people people
[1:14:50] can't some people can never get ahead
[1:14:52] with finances
[1:14:53] now it may be a test like it may be a
[1:14:55] test like lazarus right the poor the
[1:14:57] the beggar he was a child of abraham
[1:15:00] because he went down to abraham's bosom
[1:15:01] he was saved
[1:15:02] it could be a test like that but if
[1:15:04] people just can't have
[1:15:05] financial blessings year after year
[1:15:08] after a year
[1:15:09] it's time they go searching their lives
[1:15:11] right
[1:15:13] and see are they diligently hearkening
[1:15:15] to the word of the lord
[1:15:16] are they obeying god's word or not
[1:15:21] people that are accident prone the same
[1:15:23] accidents happen again and again and
[1:15:25] again
[1:15:26] they just can't seem to get the victory
[1:15:28] suicide and
[1:15:29] unnatural death tendencies
[1:15:33] uh when when people die in families and
[1:15:36] it just seems so strange or it seems
[1:15:38] unnatural it's a time for people to seek
[1:15:41] god
[1:15:42] right it's a time to ask heaven why
[1:15:46] the church i don't know i don't know
[1:15:47] about this but let me just be honest
[1:15:49] most message churches i've gone to over
[1:15:51] the years not all of them but
[1:15:53] many of them you can feel the people are
[1:15:56] in a backslidden condition
[1:15:58] i don't know about you but the ones that
[1:16:01] many many of the ones i go to
[1:16:02] you can almost feel it you can almost
[1:16:04] feel and then you know when
[1:16:06] when you preach repentance thankfully
[1:16:09] some many people sometimes lots of
[1:16:11] people come up for prayer
[1:16:12] because they're already in a backslidden
[1:16:14] condition
[1:16:16] right so when as a minister when you see
[1:16:18] that the church is calling on god
[1:16:19] they're not pawn
[1:16:21] like that one time i recently preached
[1:16:24] uh and i preached was really really
[1:16:26] preaching hard on you know the lust of
[1:16:28] the eyes and everything like that and a
[1:16:29] young man come up
[1:16:30] and he confessed that he was doing uh he
[1:16:33] was doing pornography
[1:16:34] himself with this with his brothers and
[1:16:36] sisters
[1:16:37] and you wonder and and find out the
[1:16:39] whole family's under a curse the whole
[1:16:41] family is under a curse
[1:16:42] it's broken up with the law and children
[1:16:44] are taken away by
[1:16:46] uh lawyers and everything it's it's just
[1:16:49] so unnatural
[1:16:50] and you can feel that you and people
[1:16:53] will sit in churches
[1:16:54] and yet some of those i even talk to his
[1:16:56] parents later on and they'll quote
[1:16:57] brother branham and they'll
[1:16:59] quote all these things but then when i'm
[1:17:00] talking to them they try to correct
[1:17:02] me like i don't know more about it which
[1:17:05] i'm not trying to know more about it
[1:17:06] but the fact is we all know the curse is
[1:17:09] on the family
[1:17:10] and yet the leader of that family is
[1:17:12] trying to rebuke me and correct me
[1:17:14] and teach me which i can be taught i
[1:17:17] want to learn
[1:17:19] but if you can see a curse is upon a
[1:17:21] family then you
[1:17:23] you you know then that person needs to
[1:17:25] humble themselves
[1:17:26] and seek god's face and stop trying to
[1:17:28] correct people and try
[1:17:29] start trying to see how god can correct
[1:17:31] them
[1:17:32] because the curse is upon them and that
[1:17:35] just struck me tonight i didn't think
[1:17:37] about that until i was preaching it
[1:17:39] i'm have to tell the pastor about that
[1:17:40] family
[1:17:43] because the family's broken up uh
[1:17:45] there's all kinds of
[1:17:46] sexual sins and everything like that uh
[1:17:50] it's just awful just awful
[1:17:54] now i want to um i want to look at a few
[1:17:57] things here
[1:17:58] let's see i don't know if i want to get
[1:17:59] to that quite yet i might say that to
[1:18:01] the end here
[1:18:02] yeah i think i'll say that to the end
[1:18:03] let me uh scroll down here
[1:18:07] i'm going to skip down to uh some new
[1:18:10] ones i haven't really preached yet
[1:18:12] i marked it with a symbol so i wouldn't
[1:18:14] miss it like a a star
[1:18:16] so just wait yeah there's a star okay i
[1:18:18] just i wouldn't want to miss it on my
[1:18:19] notes
[1:18:20] okay so all right so let's look at some
[1:18:23] more we read that now
[1:18:24] let's look at this one here some of
[1:18:26] these may surprise you church
[1:18:28] some promised land blessings and curses
[1:18:31] i didn't have time like i think i'm in
[1:18:32] exodus 21 17 right now that's where i'm
[1:18:35] at i'm going through the whole bible
[1:18:36] with curses i went through all the new
[1:18:38] testament
[1:18:38] now i'm going through the old testament
[1:18:40] now he said and joshua observed them at
[1:18:42] that time say
[1:18:43] cursed be the man before the lord that
[1:18:45] rises up and builds this city jericho
[1:18:47] he shall lay the foundation thereof in
[1:18:50] his firstborn
[1:18:51] and his youngest son shall be set up the
[1:18:54] gates of it
[1:18:55] now i don't know did you know this
[1:18:57] joshua cursed the man that would rebuild
[1:19:00] jericho
[1:19:02] and then in first kings 16 hundreds of
[1:19:05] years later
[1:19:06] a man did rebuild it and these exact
[1:19:08] things happened to him
[1:19:12] so see church we got to be careful what
[1:19:13] we do we have to be we need to know what
[1:19:16] god's word is blessed
[1:19:17] and we didn't know what god's word is
[1:19:18] curse praise god
[1:19:20] let's go to first kings let's read that
[1:19:22] first king 16 34.
[1:19:28] so you can see it first kings 16 34.
[1:19:34] if brother branham has cursed something
[1:19:36] then let's stay away from it praise god
[1:19:39] everybody everybody can say amen to that
[1:19:42] if a prophet joshua cursed something
[1:19:44] even in passing he don't even uh you
[1:19:47] don't even say thou sayeth lord did he
[1:19:48] say thus saith the lord in this
[1:19:49] scripture
[1:19:50] no he just pronounced the curse
[1:19:58] all right first kings 16 34.
[1:20:06] now this is in the days of uh
[1:20:09] ahab i believe yeah verse 34.
[1:20:13] in his days did heiel the bethlehemite
[1:20:16] build jericho he laid the foundation
[1:20:18] thereof
[1:20:19] in abaram his firstborn and set up the
[1:20:22] gates thereof
[1:20:23] in his youngest son sigub
[1:20:26] according to the word of the lord which
[1:20:28] he spake by joshua the son of none
[1:20:31] so that was in uh bc 925
[1:20:35] let's see when joshua spoke that i
[1:20:36] didn't get the exact number of years but
[1:20:38] let's look at that
[1:20:40] just because i they got that nice
[1:20:42] feature in my scopia bible where you can
[1:20:43] see the
[1:20:45] number of years okay so is 14 wow 1451.
[1:20:50] yes over 550 years later 550 years later
[1:20:57] joshua said curse is a man that rebuilds
[1:20:59] it his sons will die and that's exactly
[1:21:01] what happened
[1:21:04] how many believe god's word is inspired
[1:21:06] whether it's got thus saith the lord
[1:21:08] behind it or not this don't have they'll
[1:21:10] say the lord is certainly inspired
[1:21:12] but this he just said cursed be this man
[1:21:14] before the lord
[1:21:15] just a prophet issuing a curse it was
[1:21:18] inspired
[1:21:19] and the man's family the man's sons died
[1:21:23] and when he rebuilt jericho so see some
[1:21:25] more promised land curses
[1:21:28] then there was a famine in the remember
[1:21:30] i mentioned this a few
[1:21:31] weeks ago when there was a famine in the
[1:21:33] days of david three years can you
[1:21:35] imagine church
[1:21:36] three years three years do you even can
[1:21:39] you even name one thing you did in 2017
[1:21:41] three years ago can you even name
[1:21:43] i have a hard time thinking about what
[1:21:44] happened in 2017.
[1:21:46] well for three years it was famine it
[1:21:49] didn't rain in israel during the days of
[1:21:51] david
[1:21:52] and yet he was a man after god's own
[1:21:53] heart wasn't he
[1:21:56] year after year and david inquired the
[1:21:57] lord finally david said lord why is this
[1:21:59] happening
[1:22:00] and the lord answered it is for saul and
[1:22:02] for his bloody house
[1:22:04] because he slew the gibeonites
[1:22:08] and so notice israel as a nation god
[1:22:10] deals with them as a nation
[1:22:11] was punished for saul's bloody rule
[1:22:14] verse 3 shows david trying to make
[1:22:15] atonement
[1:22:16] a church this is why i believe america
[1:22:18] still has blessings
[1:22:20] because we're not judged by as a nation
[1:22:22] we're judged by individuals
[1:22:24] now you all know what happened what's
[1:22:27] happening in california
[1:22:28] they're having the worst fires that's
[1:22:29] ever happened now they may be cooling
[1:22:32] down now
[1:22:32] i haven't heard much about it but in
[1:22:34] 2020 they just went through the worst
[1:22:37] fires and burnings and loss of
[1:22:39] population they've ever had
[1:22:42] why because god's going to sink that
[1:22:43] place right because of all the evil
[1:22:46] there
[1:22:46] well look at all the i think about this
[1:22:48] look at all the blessings in ohio
[1:22:50] look at all the good message churches we
[1:22:52] got in ohio we've got at least a handful
[1:22:56] isn't that interesting so see their
[1:22:59] israel is by
[1:22:59] nation but whereby individual
[1:23:03] and look at the blessings god has
[1:23:04] bestowed upon us
[1:23:06] i just think it's striking i really do
[1:23:11] and in my in my lifetime church i can
[1:23:13] only think of a couple really bad
[1:23:14] summers where we had droughts
[1:23:16] 1988 was one of them i remember that a
[1:23:19] couple years ago we had a pretty bad
[1:23:21] drought but i mean it wasn't
[1:23:22] it's not like we were short on water or
[1:23:23] anything you know the rain the snows
[1:23:25] came and
[1:23:26] and uh bless us later on but look at
[1:23:29] that three years can you imagine
[1:23:30] three years no rain
[1:23:34] and lack of food and why is it because a
[1:23:37] curse
[1:23:38] for a man who just killed a family a
[1:23:40] group of giving knights
[1:23:42] the curse rested upon the people for
[1:23:45] three years
[1:23:46] now didn't the bible say the blessings
[1:23:48] go from generation to generation
[1:23:50] so do the curses
[1:23:53] this went from saul to the next
[1:23:56] generation
[1:23:58] and could david stop it no he couldn't
[1:24:00] stop this one
[1:24:04] interesting now this is quite a story
[1:24:07] this is one of the most uh i'll say it
[1:24:09] like this uh
[1:24:11] this was a fresh revelation
[1:24:15] here's what he says and again listen the
[1:24:18] anger of the lord was a kin was kindled
[1:24:20] against who
[1:24:22] israel so what did god do god moved
[1:24:26] david against them
[1:24:29] to say go number israel and judah do you
[1:24:31] remember this story
[1:24:33] how many people how many men died in
[1:24:34] this story remember 70
[1:24:36] 000 men died now we've had what over 220
[1:24:40] 000 from coronavirus
[1:24:42] in america with this pestilence it only
[1:24:44] lasted three days
[1:24:47] three days and seventy thousand people
[1:24:50] died
[1:24:51] we've had chronovirus wetford march
[1:24:53] april may june july
[1:24:55] august of dem rock film eight months
[1:24:58] right and it's more than it's almost
[1:24:59] tripled it right it's tripled it almost
[1:25:03] but this was seventy thousand remember
[1:25:05] god gave david three choices the prophet
[1:25:07] gave him three choices either your
[1:25:08] family
[1:25:09] or i think it was like six months of
[1:25:11] plagues or three days
[1:25:13] and david's like three days three days
[1:25:17] now church we're not going to read the
[1:25:18] whole story tonight because i i want to
[1:25:20] finish in a little bit
[1:25:21] but here is this was a revelation to me
[1:25:23] god never works
[1:25:25] outside a freemore agency and the church
[1:25:27] said
[1:25:28] nor can he tempt uh that should be he
[1:25:31] nor can he tempt man
[1:25:33] so god can't tempt david right so it
[1:25:36] looks like god is moving david
[1:25:38] it's like god's making him sin but
[1:25:40] that's that's just a figure of speech
[1:25:43] god can't tempt david
[1:25:46] so church this means god god was going
[1:25:49] to foresee david backsliding
[1:25:51] god knew david was going to backside he
[1:25:53] wanted in pride he wanted to number the
[1:25:55] people
[1:25:56] so god was going to work through by his
[1:25:58] foreknowledge work through david's
[1:26:00] backsliding
[1:26:01] to punish israel for their long-term
[1:26:04] backsliding can you imagine that
[1:26:06] isn't that powerful that blew me away
[1:26:11] what a fresh revelation that god
[1:26:14] he can't work outside a freemore agency
[1:26:17] so to punish israel
[1:26:18] he had to wait for a time when he knew
[1:26:20] david was gonna backslide
[1:26:22] and then use that to punish israel
[1:26:29] so church let's have this in our heart
[1:26:31] god will never
[1:26:33] punish those that have integrity of
[1:26:34] heart
[1:26:36] right is that what god told the king the
[1:26:38] philistine king
[1:26:40] he said i've seen the integrity of your
[1:26:43] heart
[1:26:44] that you didn't want to sin against me
[1:26:46] right
[1:26:47] so i kept you from sinning against me
[1:26:50] god will never make god will never lead
[1:26:53] or tempt any man who really wants to do
[1:26:54] what's right
[1:26:55] god will never let him do wrong because
[1:26:57] he wants to do right
[1:26:59] hallelujah so what does that mean if you
[1:27:01] and i want to make the rapture
[1:27:02] and we really do want it with sincerity
[1:27:04] god's gonna make a way for us amen
[1:27:07] if we've got integrity that means we
[1:27:09] really want it
[1:27:10] my that was so striking to me wow it
[1:27:12] looks like god is moving david but god
[1:27:14] wasn't
[1:27:15] god knew david wanted to backslide so
[1:27:18] god
[1:27:18] allowed it to happen he let satan tempt
[1:27:21] him right
[1:27:21] so see he he must have known satan
[1:27:23] accused and david there
[1:27:25] he said go ahead just like he would joke
[1:27:26] go ahead and accuse go and
[1:27:28] attempt david with that because i've got
[1:27:30] to punish israel for
[1:27:32] their wrongdoings as well
[1:27:35] so in other words there's nothing wrong
[1:27:37] with god
[1:27:38] god is fair god is just and the church
[1:27:41] said
[1:27:43] praise god that's a that is that's
[1:27:45] beautiful that came to me last week i
[1:27:47] wanted to preach it last sunday but i
[1:27:48] wasn't preaching
[1:27:49] we had a good time in the lord though
[1:27:50] wonderful time in the lord
[1:27:54] now here's another one church where a
[1:27:56] lot of people fail today they trust in
[1:27:58] the economy
[1:27:59] rather than god thus saith the lord look
[1:28:02] at that no there's a good thing i'll say
[1:28:04] the word right there
[1:28:05] cursed be the man that trusts in man
[1:28:08] see who are you trusting are you
[1:28:10] trusting your boss
[1:28:12] are you trusting the government for
[1:28:13] social security
[1:28:16] is that is that who our trust is really
[1:28:18] in
[1:28:19] the bible said cursed is the man that
[1:28:21] trusts in man
[1:28:22] and makes his flesh his arm and whose
[1:28:25] heart dependeth
[1:28:26] i'm sorry departed from the lord
[1:28:29] for he shall be like the heath which
[1:28:31] like a tree or bush in the desert
[1:28:33] and he shall not see when good cometh
[1:28:35] but shall inhabit the parched places in
[1:28:37] the wilderness
[1:28:38] in assault land and not inhabited
[1:28:42] now church does that sound like
[1:28:43] nebuchadnezzar remember when god had to
[1:28:44] humble nebuchadnezzar
[1:28:45] he wasn't out in the desert but he was
[1:28:47] out with the beasts
[1:28:49] right because he was trusting in himself
[1:28:51] he said i've done this kingdom
[1:28:52] this is my work and god said it's not
[1:28:57] blessed is the man that trusteth in the
[1:28:59] lord and whose hope
[1:29:00] is in the lord aren't you glad you're
[1:29:02] trusting the lord tonight are you
[1:29:03] trusting in jesus christ tonight
[1:29:05] amen that's the only one we can trust
[1:29:08] and praise god
[1:29:09] even if uh the socialists win the
[1:29:11] election in november
[1:29:13] right even if even if they win november
[1:29:16] our trust is not in
[1:29:17] who wins in november our trust is who is
[1:29:20] who's already won up in heaven praise
[1:29:22] god
[1:29:23] he won a long time ago praise god he won
[1:29:26] when he defeated death
[1:29:27] and resurrected hallelujah amen
[1:29:31] our hope is in jesus christ
[1:29:35] like they want to say they want to say
[1:29:36] store up food right they say store foods
[1:29:38] soar up guns
[1:29:40] concentration camps right they try to
[1:29:41] get everybody to be afraid
[1:29:44] but it's a curse of trust in man it's a
[1:29:46] curse of trust in the government
[1:29:48] we put our trust in god and god will
[1:29:50] make a way
[1:29:51] he'll provide he'll protect all glory to
[1:29:54] god god knows all things
[1:29:55] god is with us he's not against us god's
[1:29:57] blessing will be with his people praise
[1:29:59] god
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:06] i think i'll hold off on that one let me
[1:30:07] go back up and i'm going to close with
[1:30:09] this
[1:30:09] uh already preached about an hour man
[1:30:11] where's the time go
[1:30:14] let's close with uh sometimes how
[1:30:16] objects are connected to cursings
[1:30:19] okay all right passes already sorry
[1:30:23] no i didn't yeah sure sometimes
[1:30:27] objects are connected with cursings
[1:30:29] let's close with that because i think it
[1:30:30] has a
[1:30:31] as a really nice closing for us to think
[1:30:34] about here
[1:30:37] okay so first of all how do you remember
[1:30:39] the story well before that
[1:30:43] when we talk about curses on objects
[1:30:45] it's not the physical
[1:30:47] object really that has the curse but
[1:30:50] it's the individual's acceptance of the
[1:30:52] curse
[1:30:54] right it's kind of like water at
[1:30:57] baptism water doesn't save you it
[1:30:59] doesn't have any power of its own right
[1:31:02] but it's the it's the blessing that
[1:31:04] comes from being baptized
[1:31:06] from obeying god's word right so the
[1:31:08] blessing is not really in the water the
[1:31:10] blessings in the obedience
[1:31:12] well so it is with the curses
[1:31:16] right like there's a story of a man of a
[1:31:18] preacher that had
[1:31:19] he had dragons up on his walls right
[1:31:22] because his grandpa went to china
[1:31:23] visited china bought these dragons and
[1:31:25] he put him up on his wall and then the
[1:31:28] preacher said
[1:31:29] that he could never get ahead
[1:31:30] financially and then the holy spirit
[1:31:33] said you've got dragons on your wall
[1:31:35] who does a dragon represent
[1:31:38] whose dragon represent revelation 12
[1:31:41] 9 satan he said get rid of him
[1:31:45] although it hurt the preacher's heart he
[1:31:46] took down the the dragons his grandpa he
[1:31:49] loved his grandpa who passed away
[1:31:51] got rid of him and he said the next year
[1:31:53] he didn't change anything
[1:31:54] and his finances his income doubled
[1:31:58] and he didn't change anything that's
[1:32:00] quite a testimony
[1:32:02] but you understand it's not the dragon
[1:32:04] that's
[1:32:05] that has the spirit right it's it's it's
[1:32:08] accepting something that hasn't that has
[1:32:11] an evil connotation to it right
[1:32:13] it's the connection it's not that
[1:32:14] physical object
[1:32:16] but it's accepting something and oh this
[1:32:18] would look good in my house and not
[1:32:20] really realizing
[1:32:22] what comes with that okay
[1:32:25] so i just want you to see that it's just
[1:32:28] like those swine remember the swine that
[1:32:30] jesus sent the demons into
[1:32:31] the swine there's nothing really wrong
[1:32:33] with the swine
[1:32:35] right it's the spirit that comes upon
[1:32:37] the swine
[1:32:38] same thing with pictures and objects
[1:32:40] right
[1:32:42] it's not really the object but it's the
[1:32:44] spear that comes along with it if you
[1:32:45] accept it
[1:32:47] okay like here's a good example like i
[1:32:49] didn't put up there but how many ever
[1:32:50] heard of the ouija board
[1:32:51] well i never played it but we had some
[1:32:53] preachers that
[1:32:54] uh played it and then when they were
[1:32:56] sinners but got delivered and they
[1:32:57] testified that god's brought them out of
[1:32:59] the occult
[1:33:00] i don't know if you remember that
[1:33:01] children or not but we have had a
[1:33:02] preacher share that with us and he's got
[1:33:04] the victory over it
[1:33:04] and god's done great supernatural things
[1:33:06] afterwards in his ministry
[1:33:09] but anyways when you do the ouija board
[1:33:11] you have to admit and open yourself
[1:33:13] up to contacting demons and spirits well
[1:33:17] there's nothing the board itself doesn't
[1:33:19] have that but it's when you open
[1:33:20] yourself
[1:33:21] up to those spirits right through the
[1:33:23] board but it's not the board itself
[1:33:26] it's the spirits that come with the
[1:33:27] board right it's the spirits that come
[1:33:29] with you
[1:33:30] with someone trying to talk to demons
[1:33:32] okay so does that make sense i hope i
[1:33:34] said the right way
[1:33:35] i hope everybody understands that all
[1:33:37] right
[1:33:39] now here is a a good example brother
[1:33:41] braham told a couple to burn a shirt
[1:33:44] to deliver their child from epilepsy i
[1:33:46] remember that story
[1:33:47] so there when a couple had a child that
[1:33:49] had epilepsy brother man said go
[1:33:51] burn the shirt and when they burned the
[1:33:53] shirt the epilepsy left
[1:33:55] so that that proves that family must
[1:33:59] have had
[1:34:00] uh some connection they must have
[1:34:02] accepted some lie or they must have
[1:34:03] accepted some disease
[1:34:04] that came along with that clothing it
[1:34:07] wasn't the clothing itself
[1:34:09] but it must have been some sickness that
[1:34:11] came along
[1:34:12] or the epilepsy through that shirt or
[1:34:15] through something they'd said or
[1:34:16] something they'd done
[1:34:18] because a shirt is not a demon right a
[1:34:20] shirt is not a demon can we all say amen
[1:34:21] to that too
[1:34:23] but the shirt represented something they
[1:34:25] need to repent of right
[1:34:29] and there could have been a spear that
[1:34:30] spirit followed that shirt maybe that
[1:34:32] maybe someone cursed that shirt and they
[1:34:33] gave it to the family it could have been
[1:34:34] that
[1:34:36] but it wasn't really the shirt it was
[1:34:38] something they accepted
[1:34:39] and and they might have just opened
[1:34:41] themselves up to it not really thought
[1:34:42] oh this
[1:34:43] person our family gave us can i say like
[1:34:45] this a disney shirt can i just say it
[1:34:46] like that
[1:34:48] because a disney shirt might have a
[1:34:49] curse on it right
[1:34:51] especially if it's got a half naked
[1:34:52] women on it right or woman on it right
[1:34:55] or a murderer like a character who's a
[1:34:57] murderer on it might have a spirit on it
[1:35:01] now brother brooks said one of his
[1:35:03] children had epilepsy
[1:35:05] and they took the shirt that was on the
[1:35:07] child and burn it and the
[1:35:09] epilepsy left the child we know another
[1:35:12] couple that said the same thing though
[1:35:14] but that didn't bring the victory so it
[1:35:16] goes like this
[1:35:17] uh we have to find god's leading for
[1:35:20] every healing
[1:35:21] every healing won't be the same does
[1:35:22] everybody understand laying
[1:35:24] you know anointing people with oil that
[1:35:25] won't work every time right
[1:35:27] that's not because there's nothing in
[1:35:28] the oil right it's just through obeying
[1:35:30] god's plan god's will
[1:35:33] so i want you i want you to balance that
[1:35:35] out not every time somebody fast are
[1:35:37] they going to get the answer
[1:35:39] but you can get the answer through
[1:35:40] fasting right you can get a answer to
[1:35:42] prayer through fasting
[1:35:44] and i'm going kind of long serious so
[1:35:46] let me finish up i only got a couple
[1:35:47] more slides
[1:35:48] all right next one now notice
[1:35:53] cursed objects come in houses and then
[1:35:55] the house can be cursed that's what
[1:35:56] we're talking about earlier with the
[1:35:58] the picture of dragons the graven images
[1:36:01] of their gods shall ye burn with fire
[1:36:03] thou shall not desire the silver or gold
[1:36:05] that's on them nor
[1:36:06] take it to thee lest thou be snare
[1:36:08] therein for it is abomination the lord
[1:36:10] thy god
[1:36:11] neither shalt thou bring an abomination
[1:36:12] into thine house lest
[1:36:14] thou be accursed thing like it but thou
[1:36:17] shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt
[1:36:19] utterly abhor it
[1:36:20] for it is a cursed thing at church this
[1:36:23] the sad thing is many of our
[1:36:25] curses today are on phones right and
[1:36:27] tablets
[1:36:30] and i don't know it'll be up to god if
[1:36:32] that person has to get rid of the tablet
[1:36:34] or just get rid of the lust in their
[1:36:36] heart
[1:36:38] because clearly anything you allow in
[1:36:40] your house that's cursed
[1:36:41] makes you cursed praise god
[1:36:45] punished if you accept sin in your house
[1:36:48] you have to suffer the punishment of it
[1:36:53] okay like i know the one preacher who
[1:36:56] fell away from the message
[1:36:58] he let his children bring rock and roll
[1:37:00] into the house
[1:37:01] and then his eye one of his eyes went
[1:37:03] crooked afterwards i don't know if you
[1:37:04] knew that sister
[1:37:05] one of his eyes went crooked afterwards
[1:37:06] and he's on medication he's got all
[1:37:07] these health problems
[1:37:09] i don't know if that is but it sure
[1:37:10] looks like it is
[1:37:12] he invited rock and roll
[1:37:15] and then his children one of his child
[1:37:17] is divorced now and married a second
[1:37:19] time all the all the women in their
[1:37:20] family cut their hair where
[1:37:22] wear short shorts and pants now but look
[1:37:24] at that he let rock and roll and rap
[1:37:26] into his house and it got to the place
[1:37:29] when he was still pastoring in the
[1:37:30] message
[1:37:31] his teenage children wouldn't even sit
[1:37:33] in the sanctuary they had to sit in the
[1:37:35] pastor's office and wouldn't even hear
[1:37:36] the word of god
[1:37:38] that's how bad it was that's that's how
[1:37:41] much that rebellious spirit
[1:37:42] had accursed their house
[1:37:45] i don't know about you but i don't want
[1:37:46] curses i want blessings on my house
[1:37:48] praise god i want my children to rejoice
[1:37:50] in the word of the lord amen
[1:37:52] hallelujah i don't want to hide them
[1:37:54] from the word i want them to rejoice in
[1:37:56] the word amen
[1:37:57] with joyfulness and gladness of heart
[1:37:59] but that's in the message
[1:38:01] that happened the message see
[1:38:04] you let a curse in it's going to curse
[1:38:06] your house
[1:38:10] all right i'm almost done i'm close with
[1:38:12] it i'm closing with this last one church
[1:38:14] did you know this
[1:38:15] there's a connection to communion with
[1:38:17] blessings and curses remember this
[1:38:21] it's not the bread and wine that has the
[1:38:23] curse on it
[1:38:24] it's the disobedience if people eat it
[1:38:28] and drink it
[1:38:29] unworthily remember the scripture
[1:38:35] let a man examine himself
[1:38:38] because if he eats and drinks unworthily
[1:38:41] it's
[1:38:41] damnation to himself not discerning
[1:38:44] the lord's body
[1:38:48] now how many people in the corinthian
[1:38:50] church had curses on them
[1:38:53] anybody read that out loud
[1:38:56] this is the same church that had that
[1:38:58] man sleeping with his stepmom
[1:39:01] same church this wasn't a few people in
[1:39:05] the church that had curses
[1:39:07] many of them had curses and because they
[1:39:12] didn't
[1:39:13] because they they took the bread and the
[1:39:15] wine without
[1:39:16] repenting of their sins they got weak
[1:39:19] and
[1:39:20] sickly doesn't that sound like the
[1:39:21] promised land does that sound like the
[1:39:23] promised land church
[1:39:24] don't you know we're in the promised
[1:39:26] land praise god the spiritual promised
[1:39:28] land amen
[1:39:31] isn't that something isn't that striking
[1:39:33] to you that's striking to me
[1:39:35] that if if people when i when i break
[1:39:38] that bread sister beatrice if they
[1:39:39] didn't examine their hearts that'll be a
[1:39:41] curse to them
[1:39:43] and they might get sick
[1:39:46] and they might even die
[1:39:51] because they don't judge themselves you
[1:39:53] say it's a curse brother jesse yeah
[1:39:55] brother brahm said so
[1:39:58] he says what are you you're a christian
[1:40:00] you live before everybody as a christian
[1:40:02] if you take that communion and don't
[1:40:04] live as a christian you're not
[1:40:05] discerning the lord's body
[1:40:06] you're putting a stumbling block in
[1:40:07] somebody else's way see as they
[1:40:10] see you trying to do that and then not
[1:40:12] living what you're supposed to live
[1:40:13] see you're not discerning the lord's
[1:40:15] body now watch it what the curse of it
[1:40:17] is
[1:40:19] watch the curse of what it is let's
[1:40:22] stand to our feet praise god
[1:40:23] i better stop brother branham call it a
[1:40:27] curse
[1:40:30] we'll read the quote we'll read this
[1:40:31] other quote on
[1:40:34] sunday
[1:40:36] church communion has a blessing or a
[1:40:48] curse
[1:40:52] musicians you can come by god's grace
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:58] let's meditate on that as we're just as
[1:41:00] we close and ultimately dismiss
[1:41:02] that we are in the promised land we're
[1:41:05] in a spiritual promised land
[1:41:08] and every decision we make
[1:41:11] can either be a blessing or a curse
[1:41:18] if we let cursed things in our homes
[1:41:20] there's going to be some curse in our
[1:41:22] home
[1:41:30] it could be something upon our body
[1:41:33] it could be a broken family it could be
[1:41:36] a mind battle
[1:41:37] right
[1:41:40] it could be a mental breakdown sorrow of
[1:41:43] heart it could be a heart trouble
[1:41:46] all because we don't judge the word the
[1:41:49] right way
[1:41:51] and we allow something cursed to enter
[1:41:52] in and that curse or that sin that comes
[1:41:54] in is the evil spirit
[1:41:56] and that evil spirit begins to destroy
[1:41:57] the house
[1:42:00] how many want a peaceful house how many
[1:42:03] want to judge themselves worthy of the
[1:42:05] gospel
[1:42:06] that's my prayer that's why i want that
[1:42:09] more than anything else
[1:42:10] god's blessings to be upon me
[1:42:14] uh we just pray that song the lord the
[1:42:16] blessing lord bless you and lord keep
[1:42:17] you
[1:42:18] make his face shine upon you let's have
[1:42:20] a word of prayer
[1:42:21] how many would say brother just pray for
[1:42:22] me that i'll keep everything cursed out
[1:42:25] of my house and my house will be blessed
[1:42:28] god bless the hands i'm not even opening
[1:42:30] my eyes here tonight but
[1:42:32] i'm sure every hand would be up even

[1:42:45] i want to be blessed i want to serve god
[1:42:47] with joyfulness
