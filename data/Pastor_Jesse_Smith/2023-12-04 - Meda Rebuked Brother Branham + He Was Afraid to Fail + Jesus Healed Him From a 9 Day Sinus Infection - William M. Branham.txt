TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I wanted to go back but I felt a little nudge and I said well for the Brethren's sake I'll set them meating as soon as I arrived in this Valley my throat closed right up and I didn't speak for nine days till the meetings passed by brother ruddle he may be here this morning too one of the brothers in this Tabernacle him and juny Jackson uh and them I was supposed to have meeting for him and the meet my throat just closed up and the first thing you know I tuck a fever of about 105 and I was going to the meeting first and um doc Sheen said to me I said my throat is horse he said I give you something to loosen up them lxs and you go ahead and preach I talk something give me and what it was they pull that sinus down and block it then I laid in the bed for n days but just a high burning fever many my brethren here come to me many famous brothers come prayed for me here come brother Grim Snelling here come brother rutle all these brothers you're all gathered in praying and everything else me praying trying my best couldn't even whisper I wonder what's it all about my lovely little wife sitting there her and I'm praying for me just kept on saying this the same they couldn't understand now he gave me some medicine to take but I didn't take it because it was dope and then I just let it go and I just kept thanking Lord surely and then after the meetings is all over on a Monday that was last meeting was supposed to be on Saturday and then I believe in that old Monday I tried to get up I was so weak I couldn't go through the room I sat down you know I'm so thankful for a god-given wife aren't you Brethren a real wife a real companion I sat down I motioned to her and got her over close to me I said mey sometimes I wonder I said I wonder what's the matter I said why would them meetings be there and God let me lay like this I said why was it and I said sometimes I wonder if he even called me she said ain't you ashamed of yourself and she told me said Bill don't you know that God knows what he's doing with you just just be quiet and so I went in that kind of rebuked me a little you know so I went in laid down on the bed she'd come in to change the sheets and she'd got the the things on her arm and when she started out I look and there was a I seen an old a great big Armory building that the sun had shined down and bursted out on the ground brought it to Pieces the sun shining down from heaven and there come three women and a man come up and they had all like a little bitty like little some kind of little shooting guns like and he said that drives nails and said we you hold these pieces up brother BR and we'll build this Armory back up for you and I said all right I'll do that but something said don't do it well I reach down to get a piece like this to build it up like this and just then a voice spoke to me and said now they're on the road to get you to go back don't you believe it said they're ever so sincere and they're coming to you with thus sayeth the Lord but they're wrong see Fred sofman many of them here was right there and I told him about it and less than an hour the people drove right up to my door I said these three women and a man that's exactly right they come with us sayith the Lord yes sir they I said of course you know what to tell him sincerely wrong see fine people but sincerely wrong then I thought well what can I do what must I do and then mey come in she gone back and brother Freddy went and told people and then after a while I was in there on the on the bed and I thought why does it happen that way why can't I speak why can't I talk to somebody or something I was laying there media come in was going back out of the room and I looked and I seen something make a flicker over to one side and I look and there was my wall opened up and I seen Jesus how many ever ever heard me say I've seen Jesus twice in my life in a vision and I believed I would see him again before the the end time see see him again now I looked and the skies was right out there just looked like looked through the wall and there was the Bible standing right like this great big Bible standing in the sky well there something got light around the Bible and out of the Bible come a real pretty Golden Cross and it stood out like this and the lights coming from all around it and out of that cross he walked the Bible reflected the cross the cross reflected him and he come walking out and walked right down to where it was at I can see it just as plain I see the that cross reflecting his hair standing there hung down over his face he looked down at me like that and he said to me you are waiting for your new ministry to be confirmed to you he said I've already confirmed it to you it's already confirmed you've got to accept it and I didn't listen to him just a minute it come into my mind I didn't hear that it just come into my mind like a man that he's been a sinner all his life and he knows there's a Bible knows there's a God but all it wants to hear is a sermon then something tells him it's you then that same word's been there all the time yet it's confirmed to him then he says Lord forgive me but it won't do no good until he accepts his salvation then he goes out as a Christian no matter how much he cries how much he begs he's got to accept it and the he said to me that you've got to accept it the same way you've got to believe it I'm afraid of defeat anything I'm afraid I'll bring a reproach I'm always afraid of watching think I'll call the wrong thing cuz I took warning of the Bible how that Moses is given great power and he smoked the rock instead of speaking to it I remember Elijah because he went baldheaded them little children teasing about being baldheaded he put a curse on those children and 42 of them was killed by bears see not it wasn't the Holy Spirit but it that Prophet angered and I I've went through all the things coming to that and there he stood talking to me and he said but you walk with too many he said to walk with me you walk alone I'd seen that I've been catering too much to denominations and everything you see somebody trying to tell you what to do and what not to do you got to follow him amen now remember the vision that he gave me about the fishing you know and how that you couldn't teach Supernatural signs the Pentecostal babies you remember there it was and I'm right at the brim of this new message no more than the vision left me I said amen Lord and my wife and stand there almost fainted and I jumped up out of the bed I could talk as good as I ever did just in a second every bit of the fever left me I called up doc she I said likey look at me he said what and I come over there and he looked at me looked through those signs and said tell me what happened brother Brandon I said you believe my story said how I could I doubt it it's happened that's it see that's it friends God knows how to hold you on an ash Heep he knows how to do something for you until he can get the message over to you see to get to do something today I don't know how much defeat I went in not long or was listening to a radio broadcast and there's a minister preaching on the resurrection from 1 Corinthians 15 and he was preaching the resurrection and he stopped right in the middle of his sermon and he said you know so many people are afraid of defeat he said when General Patton lost a bunch of soldiers said then they told him he sent back and he wanted some more and they sent him up some more he got them killed he sent for some more and when he got them third Bunch up there said every time a bullet would whine they'd run out tin or run under something that they're scared he said Sam me up man not kids he said I want man that's ready to die I don't want somebody's afraid to die if the cause we're fighting for is not worthy to die for then keep them away from me I want man he said but you've lost two or three battles he said I I haven't lost a war I've just lost a battle something spoke in my heart I remember eising Hower said when I throw a bullet commanded and they throw a shell in the gun they pulled it off and it was a fizzle it didn't work said I didn't quit and surrender I throw the bullet out and put another one in tried it if it didn't work I put another one in until one did work that's the way it's got to be done I don't know how it'll be but God is my judge over this Pulpit I don't know how many Fizzles and how many how many battles I lose but I'll not lose the war he told me he'd be with me I'll Stand till I see that Ministry confirmed and see in operation I begin this morning by the grace of God I don't know where it'll work here where it'll work somewhere else how it'll work or what it'll take place but I'll walk right down prayer lines praying for the sick until I do know what's happening I've seen it happen to three times
