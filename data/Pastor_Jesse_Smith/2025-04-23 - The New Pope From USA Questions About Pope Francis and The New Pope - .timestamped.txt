[0:03] I believe one of these glorious days
[0:06] when this United Confederation Church
[0:08] goes together and the new pope is
[0:10] brought out of the United States and put
[0:12] their accordion of prophecy.
[0:15] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:19] this video is to answer two questions
[0:21] related to the death of Pope Francis and
[0:24] the next pope that will be elected. Will
[0:26] the next pope be from the United States?
[0:29] And the second question is about how we
[0:30] should express the destiny of Pope St.
[0:34] Francis. So I think I'll start with the
[0:36] easiest question to answer. Is it right
[0:39] for a believer to say a false prophet
[0:41] has died? Pope Francis has died. A new
[0:44] addition to hell. Is this expression
[0:47] right? Pastor
[0:49] Smith. This is a great question. I
[0:52] personally think this is a little bit
[0:54] harsh. Truly, the Pope is a false
[0:57] prophet. When the pope speaks from St.
[1:00] Peter's Basilica, it is believed that
[1:03] he's speaking from the Lord. So that
[1:05] would make him a prophet. But the Pope
[1:07] does not speak for God Almighty. So yes,
[1:09] I believe the Pope is a false prophet.
[1:12] Now, the words a new addition to hell,
[1:14] that's going a little too far in my
[1:16] humble opinion because no man really
[1:18] knows the final destination of a person.
[1:20] We don't know if the Pope repented
[1:22] before he passed away. If he didn't,
[1:24] it's likely that he wasn't saved. It's
[1:26] likely that he did go to hell because of
[1:29] all the false teachings and false
[1:31] doctrines that he propagated throughout
[1:32] his entire life. You can find lots of
[1:34] videos where the pope believed all
[1:37] religions lead to heaven. Of course,
[1:38] that's a lie. Jesus said he's the only
[1:41] way. He's the way, the truth, and the
[1:42] life. According to John 14:6, the Pope
[1:46] made a declaration about blessing
[1:48] same-sex marriages. We believe that's
[1:50] heresy. You cannot bless what God has
[1:52] cursed. God has called homosexuality an
[1:54] abomination. And God taught that in the
[1:57] Old Testament and the New Testament. You
[1:59] find that Romans chapter 1 and 1
[2:01] Corinthians chapter 6 along with other
[2:03] verses. So I would just say yes, a false
[2:05] prophet has died and it's likely he went
[2:08] to hell unless he repented of his sins.
[2:11] We hope he repented of his sins. The
[2:13] Bible said God does not delight in the
[2:15] death of the wicked. I believe that's in
[2:16] the book of Ezekiel. It's Ezekiel 33:11.
[2:20] Say unto them, as I live, sayaeth the
[2:21] Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
[2:23] death of the wicked, but that the wicked
[2:24] turn from his way and live. Turn ye,
[2:27] turn ye from your evil ways, for why
[2:29] will you die, oh house of
[2:31] Israel? Next, we'll get to the second
[2:33] question. Since the pope died, brother
[2:36] Brandham said, "We will have one from
[2:37] the USA. Is it about to be fulfilled?"
[2:40] And I don't know the answer to this
[2:42] question. I've only found one quote
[2:44] about this. It's from 1954. Now, I did
[2:47] try to search a little bit for it.
[2:49] There's seven quotes on the new pope and
[2:52] this is the only one where brother
[2:54] talked about a new pope from the United
[2:55] States. There's five quotes on pope plus
[2:58] the word federation. And there's two
[3:00] quotes on thus sayith the lord and pope
[3:02] but neither of them say thus sayith the
[3:04] lord. There will be a pope from the
[3:05] United States of America. So we don't
[3:07] know for sure as far as we don't have
[3:09] the assurance of thus sayith the lord.
[3:11] But we do have this quote from 1954.
[3:13] It's from December acts of the holy
[3:15] spirit. It's an evening service. I
[3:17] listened to the whole sermon yesterday
[3:18] and brother Ram only mentioned the pope
[3:20] one time in this service. It was in
[3:22] paragraph 87. Brother Ram's talking
[3:24] about how all the stones Solomon used
[3:26] were scattered about and these are the
[3:29] stones Solomon used to build his temple
[3:31] and they're all brought together and
[3:32] pieced together perfectly. Brother Ram
[3:34] was using that as a type of how the
[3:36] bride of Jesus Christ would be from all
[3:38] nations and brought together before the
[3:40] rapture. He used that symbolism many
[3:42] times. Then brother Ram said,"I believe
[3:44] one of these glorious days when this
[3:45] united confederation of church goes
[3:47] together and the new pope is brought out
[3:48] of the United States and put over there
[3:51] according to prophecy. Then they'll form
[3:53] an image like unto the beast. I tell you
[3:55] the true church of God will be drove
[3:57] together." So brother Ram says there is
[4:00] some prophecy. Now I don't know that
[4:01] prophecy. If someone knows of that
[4:04] prophecy, please share it with me. I'll
[4:05] share with all the viewers here by the
[4:07] grace of God. My best guess is that
[4:10] brother Ram is referring just to the
[4:11] prophecy in the Bible. Daniel 2 shows us
[4:14] that Rome will rule at the end time. And
[4:16] brother Ram said, "Thus sayith the
[4:17] Lord." Rome will rule at the end time.
[4:19] Not Russia, not China. Rome will rule
[4:21] with thus sayith the
[4:23] Lord. And then we know Revelation 17:3
[4:26] says, "This woman rides the beast and
[4:28] the beast is the spirit of Rome and the
[4:30] woman is the Roman Catholic Church." So
[4:32] the gentile power ruling will be the
[4:34] spirit of Rome at the end time and the
[4:36] Roman Catholic Church will have the
[4:37] power of this spirit of Rome. And who is
[4:41] the head of the Roman Catholic Church?
[4:42] It is of course the pope of Rome. And
[4:45] then Revelation 13
[4:47] 11-18 shows the United States of America
[4:50] laying down the mark. Brother Ram taught
[4:52] on numerous occasions that Revelation 13
[4:54] 11-18 is the spirit of Rome in the
[4:58] United States. And then brother Ram said
[5:00] in spoken word is the original seed in
[5:02] 1962 which he also repeats in the church
[5:04] age book when the Holy Spirit told him
[5:06] to pick up the pen and write. Brother
[5:08] Ram said according to Revelation 13:16
[5:10] the bride will be forced to stop
[5:14] preaching. So that's one important sign
[5:16] I believe that the bride will know the
[5:19] squeeze is on. the raptures very near
[5:22] when the bride is forced to stop
[5:23] preaching by this ecumenical movement or
[5:26] the federation of churches with the
[5:28] Roman Catholic Church. So I think with
[5:30] these three scriptures, brother Ram was
[5:32] trying to show that he believes since
[5:34] the United States will be a major player
[5:36] in the end time, the spirit of Rome is
[5:38] now in the United States. Brother Ram
[5:40] said JFK and Jacle Kennedy was a move of
[5:45] the Roman Catholic Church to get power
[5:47] in the United States. That based upon
[5:49] these verses, a pope would have to come
[5:51] out of the United States. Now, that's
[5:53] just my best guess. I don't know for
[5:54] sure, but let's first listen to the
[5:56] quote from 1954, Acts of the Holy
[5:58] Spirit, the new pope is brought out of
[6:00] the United States according to prophecy.
[6:03] Let's listen to the quote. And when this
[6:05] cut this way and one that way, they
[6:07] couldn't understand. But when they went
[6:09] to put it together, the whole thing was
[6:11] laying on the ground. And they put it
[6:13] block on block on block and didn't have
[6:16] to cut no more. I believe one of these
[6:18] glorious days when this United
[6:21] Confederation Church goes together and
[6:23] the new pope is brought out of the
[6:25] United States and put on their accordion
[6:26] of prophecy. Then they'll form an image
[6:29] black into the beast. And I tell you,
[6:30] the true church about to be drawn
[6:32] together. the real true believers out of
[6:35] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[6:37] Pentecostals, Nazarene, Pilgrim,
[6:39] Holiness, whatever they'll be will go
[6:41] together, cemented by the love of God.
[6:43] That'll make the body of the Lord Jesus
[6:45] Christ. Amen. All the believers and
[6:48] agnostics and shallow mind. It'll be
[6:50] cast to one side. They'll go right away
[6:53] into the Confederation Churches.
[6:56] Here's another good quote I thought I'd
[6:57] share. It is a thus sayith the Lord from
[6:59] hearing, recognizing, acting on the word
[7:01] of God. February 21st, 1960, Brother Ram
[7:04] said, "The churches, though unite with
[7:06] Catholicism, thus saith the Lord." Let's
[7:09] listen to the quote. Now, the church
[7:12] life is at the
[7:13] end. The normal church, the church, now
[7:17] this may stick just a little bit, but
[7:19] the church carnal, the Esau church,
[7:22] she's come to her end. What's she doing?
[7:24] Heading up in the Federation of
[7:26] Churches,
[7:28] which will finally join with Romanism to
[7:30] fight Catholic. uh with Catholicism to
[7:33] fight
[7:34] communism. Pope John is calling for all
[7:37] the churches to come back and they will
[7:41] and they'll unite themselves together
[7:43] just exactly what thus sayeth the Lord.
[7:45] You say, "Wait a minute, Brother Bram,
[7:47] you're getting off the line. If I am,
[7:48] God wrote his Bible off the line." You
[7:51] have to be Michael on this case. Amen.
[7:54] So, friends, in closing, this is a great
[7:55] question. This question comes up every
[7:57] time there's a new pope since I've been
[7:58] in the message. It's happened twice.
[8:00] 2005 when Pope Benedict became the pope
[8:03] and then 2013 when Pope Francis was
[8:06] elected as the new pope. So we'll see
[8:08] who the new pope is. Perhaps it'll be
[8:10] Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New
[8:12] York. He came he became famous when Pope
[8:15] Francis visited him. I think it was in
[8:16] 2015 there in New York and he became
[8:19] more prominent during COVID doing a lot
[8:22] of media
[8:23] tours. So this is just my humble
[8:26] thought. He seems to be the most
[8:28] prominent American bishop or
[8:31] archbishop. So perhaps it'll be Timothy
[8:33] Dolan. But some reports say the pope has
[8:36] to be able to speak lots of languages.
[8:38] So I don't know how many languages
[8:40] Timothy Dolan knows. So I really don't
[8:42] know. That's just my best guess by the
[8:44] grace of God. So if you have other
[8:45] quotes from brother Bram that talk about
[8:47] prophecy regarding a American pope,
[8:50] please share with me. I'd love to see it
[8:52] and I'll share it by the grace of God.
[8:54] Friends, let's keep watching and praying
[8:56] for the coming of the Lord. He appears
[8:57] to all those that love his appearing. As
[9:00] St. Paul said, as the Lord Jesus told
[9:02] us, he said, "Watch and pray that you
[9:04] enter not into temptation." So, that's
[9:06] powerful advice for us in any time and
[9:08] season of our lives. Watch and pray.
[9:10] Prayer and the Holy Ghost will help us
[9:12] overcome
[9:13] temptation. If you have any questions,
[9:15] concerns, or testimonies about this
[9:16] video, please contact
[9:19] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[9:22] be the desire of your heart.
[9:25] very happy to be here this afternoon and
[9:27] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[9:29] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[9:32] good news that Jesus raised from the
[9:34] dead, living among man today, his
[9:37] church. The same Jesus that was
[9:39] yesterday will be today and
[9:42] forever. He is never failed.
