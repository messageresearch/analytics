[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] other day i got something mixed up i
[0:04] have to hear it yes i called it right
[0:06] there and it's on the tape if you happen
[0:08] to catch that on your tape remember look
[0:09] in the bible you see
[0:13] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:15] of the lord jesus christ
[0:17] the purpose of this video is to prove
[0:19] that the tapes of god's prophet brother
[0:21] william branham are not infallible
[0:24] as the leadership at branham tabernacle
[0:26] declares
[0:28] and of course they're wrong
[0:30] friends i rejoice in the tapes because
[0:32] the tapes contain many scriptural truths
[0:35] and the tapes point me to the absolute
[0:37] which is the word of god and of course
[0:39] the absolute is a person as well it's
[0:42] jesus christ and the bible is the
[0:44] absolute in written form but jesus
[0:46] christ is the absolute in a person in
[0:49] the spiritual form
[0:51] friends i believe brother branham is a
[0:52] genuine prophet of god as i have over
[0:55] 100 youtube videos that teach that along
[0:57] with two books i've written along with
[0:59] 18 years of preaching the bible
[1:01] revelations that god showed to his
[1:03] prophet brother branham
[1:05] for those of us who believe god sent
[1:06] brother branham as a genuine prophet of
[1:08] god we are trying to stand in the middle
[1:10] of the road right now as there are two
[1:12] erroneous extremes around those who
[1:14] claim to follow brother graham's message
[1:17] one extreme is the branham tabernacle
[1:19] and the tape church movement and
[1:21] essentially they worship the tapes and
[1:23] exalt the tapes to infallibility it's my
[1:25] humble opinion they also worship brother
[1:27] branham as well which is of course an
[1:29] awful sin the sin of idolatry
[1:33] the other extreme is the group that
[1:34] denies brother branham as a genuine
[1:36] prophet of god some of these have left
[1:39] his bible teachings
[1:40] and so as true believers of the bible
[1:42] we're standing in the middle and we
[1:44] believe brother branham was a genuine
[1:45] prophet of god but we do not worship him
[1:47] nor do we exalt the tapes to
[1:49] infallibility
[1:51] and again i want to apologize
[1:53] if there's any distracting noises while
[1:54] i'm recording this video i'm recording
[1:56] it at home of course and sometimes the
[1:59] air conditioner will turn on and
[2:01] sometimes my children are running around
[2:02] upstairs or playing you might hear them
[2:05] as well but of course parents will
[2:06] understand that
[2:08] this subject is so important that i may
[2:10] make another podcast about it as well
[2:12] and add the audio from this youtube
[2:15] video into the podcast
[2:16] and then add additional thoughts to the
[2:18] podcast lord willing
[2:20] so this video is focused on defending
[2:22] the bible truth against those who exalt
[2:25] the tapes to infallibility and i humbly
[2:28] say this veto defends against those who
[2:30] worship the tapes and those who worship
[2:32] brother branham
[2:34] and of course they worship brother
[2:35] branham by saying
[2:36] every word on his tape was thus saith
[2:38] the lord
[2:39] if every word brother branham said on
[2:40] tape was thus saith the lord then
[2:41] brother random is equal to the lord
[2:43] but of course we know that's wrong
[2:45] that's a false teaching
[2:47] here's the outline for the video
[2:49] first we'll look at seven obvious proofs
[2:51] not every word was thus saith the lord
[2:54] second we'll look at seven types of
[2:56] human mistakes brother branham made
[2:59] next we'll look at correcting false
[3:01] beliefs about the tapes
[3:04] fourth we'll look at 60 plus honest
[3:06] mistakes on the tapes of brother branham
[3:09] and we'll close with a plea for tape
[3:11] worshipers to repent
[3:15] seven obvious proofs not every word on
[3:17] tape is thus saith the lord
[3:20] i'm going to try to go through these
[3:22] quickly friends as some of these topics
[3:24] i've covered in previous youtube videos
[3:26] but the first reason is brother branham
[3:27] said in certain cases he would say this
[3:30] is not from the lord or this is not thus
[3:32] saith the lord he would repeat phrases
[3:35] that were telling us it was just his
[3:37] opinion or he has nothing on it from the
[3:39] lord
[3:40] one example is from 1951 the angel lord
[3:43] brother ram said quote now this is not
[3:46] the lord speaking this is your brother
[3:47] brother branham end quote
[3:50] so the numerous quotes like these prove
[3:53] not every word was thus saith the lord
[3:55] because brother am specifically said it
[3:57] wasn't thus saith the lord and if
[3:58] branham tabernacle says every word on
[4:00] the tape is thus saith the lord yet
[4:02] brother ram says it's not thus saith the
[4:03] lord then they do not believe brother
[4:05] branham which is obviously the case and
[4:07] it's always been that case they say they
[4:09] believe brother branham but brother
[4:10] branham said your actions prove you
[4:12] don't these people claim to believe
[4:15] every word that you say to be true but
[4:17] they don't
[4:19] they don't believe it their own actions
[4:21] prove that they don't
[4:24] proof number two brother ram said there
[4:26] are mix-ups on the tapes in questions
[4:29] and answers part 1 1964
[4:31] brother branham said quote like the
[4:33] other day i got something mixed up i
[4:35] happen to hear and it's i caught it
[4:37] right there
[4:38] and it's on the tape and i'll probably
[4:40] hear from it but if you happen to catch
[4:43] that on your tape remember look in the
[4:45] bible end quote
[4:48] i love this quote because brother
[4:49] branham admits the tapes have mistakes
[4:51] but he gives us these four beautiful
[4:52] words look in the bible that's what the
[4:54] holy ghost was given for to point us to
[4:56] truth to guide us into all truth as
[4:59] jesus christ said in the book of saint
[5:00] john
[5:02] god's word has no mix-ups but the tapes
[5:04] have mix-ups according to brother
[5:05] branham so brother ram's tapes cannot be
[5:08] equal to the bible they cannot be
[5:09] infallible
[5:11] third brother random said he made those
[5:13] kind of mistakes all the time on the
[5:15] tapes like mixing up numbers
[5:18] for example in questions and answers on
[5:20] the seals 1963
[5:22] they asked brother branham quote did you
[5:23] mean to say 7 000 who had not bowed
[5:26] their knee to balaam or 700
[5:28] end quote
[5:29] of course you're probably familiar with
[5:30] this brother random said 700 instead of
[5:33] 7 000 and the people asked him about it
[5:35] and brother branham apologized he said
[5:37] quote
[5:38] seven thousand i meant to say forgive me
[5:40] for that end quote
[5:42] and then brother graham said he made
[5:43] these mistakes all the time
[5:45] so from the context we know he misquoted
[5:48] scriptures or misspoke numbers many
[5:51] times on the tapes
[5:52] brother ram said quote i just said 700
[5:55] instead of 7 000 i make them mistakes
[5:58] all the time
[5:59] end quote
[6:02] so if brother branham is telling the
[6:03] truth here then all the time there's
[6:05] going to be mix-ups on the tapes when
[6:07] brother iran was trying to cite a verse
[6:09] or remember a certain number from the
[6:10] bible and we find that to be the case as
[6:13] this video will show with over 60 proofs
[6:15] of brother adam's honest mistakes on the
[6:17] tapes
[6:18] and of course there could be more
[6:19] mistakes on the tapes
[6:21] fourth brother random said his words
[6:23] will fail not might fail and we know
[6:26] god's word can never fail brother rahm
[6:28] said this in 1950 expectation quote i
[6:31] believe that we must read the word of
[6:33] god each service see my words will fail
[6:36] as all mortals but god's word cannot
[6:38] fail it's forever lasting true end quote
[6:44] so there's many quotes like this brother
[6:46] branham differentiates
[6:47] his words from the word of god brother
[6:49] rams human words will fail but god's
[6:52] words can never fail
[6:54] fifth brother adam defined thus saith
[6:56] the lord as having no mistakes as he did
[6:59] in this quote from 1961
[7:01] expectation
[7:02] and obviously as we've already seen he
[7:04] admitted to making mistakes on the tapes
[7:06] but in this quote brother ram said quote
[7:09] there's where you must solemnly base
[7:10] your faith on thus saith the lord
[7:13] and now god being infinite and cannot
[7:15] make a mistake and he's perfect
[7:17] therefore all of his all of his promises
[7:19] must be perfect as he is perfect end
[7:22] quote
[7:25] so god cannot make a mistake so if the
[7:27] tapes have mix-ups or mistakes
[7:29] then god did not speak every word that's
[7:31] on the tapes
[7:32] and that's the truth that's what brother
[7:33] brahm taught and that's what we believe
[7:36] six brother ram said to make him
[7:37] infallible was
[7:39] one of the awfulest things you could do
[7:42] he said this in the key to the door 1962
[7:45] quote they claim in here that some
[7:47] brethren up there that said that i sent
[7:49] them up there and they're preaching that
[7:51] men should leave their wives and hunt
[7:53] for their spiritual mate and that
[7:55] that i am perfectly infallible that
[7:57] there's nothing
[7:58] and oh some of the awfulest things you
[8:00] ever heard end quote
[8:04] friends it is one of the most awful
[8:06] things to say brother branham was
[8:07] infallible and that's exactly what
[8:09] branham tabernacle is doing it's an
[8:11] awful spiritual state to be in so as i
[8:14] said we'll pray for them at the end of
[8:15] this video
[8:16] and the seventh proof is what you're
[8:18] going to see later on this video i'm
[8:20] going to show over 60 proofs of brother
[8:22] brahms human mistakes on his tapes that
[8:25] prove he was not infallible and not
[8:27] every word on the tapes are thus saith
[8:29] the lord
[8:30] seven types of human mistakes brother
[8:32] branham made
[8:36] now of course there could be more kinds
[8:37] of human mistakes brother adam could
[8:39] make on the tapes but this is what i
[8:41] found so far and of course i still
[8:43] believe brother branham was a genuine
[8:45] prophet of god
[8:46] all prophets of god make mistakes in
[8:48] their own human nature in their own
[8:51] human mind
[8:52] but when a prophet speaks thus saith the
[8:54] lord that cannot be a mistake that
[8:56] cannot fail because it's god's word
[8:59] and of course not every word brother
[9:01] brahm said was thus saith the lord so
[9:03] the first type of mistake is what he
[9:04] calls a slip of the tongue
[9:06] there's numerous examples of this as
[9:07] you'll see later on but one example is
[9:09] brother branham said
[9:10] rebecca
[9:12] met her bride now if that's true rebecca
[9:14] met another woman to marry
[9:16] which we know would be an abomination
[9:19] or as rebecca rolled the camel and
[9:22] jumped off the camel right between the
[9:24] house of abraham
[9:26] out in the field she met her brine
[9:30] oh god in the church will meet our bride
[9:32] in the air
[9:33] for we wish alive and remain shall not
[9:35] prevent or hinder those which are asleep
[9:39] brother ram said this on numerous
[9:40] occasions rebecca went to her bride of
[9:43] course later he would say it right
[9:44] rebecca met her bride groom but we can't
[9:47] deny what the tapes say there are times
[9:49] when brother graham said rebecca met her
[9:51] bride so this is just the slip of the
[9:53] tongue brother and meant to say
[9:54] bridegroom
[9:56] the second kind of human mistake is a
[9:57] misquote from the scripture
[9:59] for example for the rapture brother
[10:01] branham cited
[10:02] 2
[10:03] chapter 4. of course friends there is no
[10:06] second thessalonians chapter 4.
[10:08] and the second is fulfilled in second
[10:11] thessalonians the fourth chapter let's
[10:13] just take a read we just read a few
[10:14] minutes ago see i would not have you
[10:16] either brother concerning those asleep
[10:20] some people may want to think that there
[10:22] is but then brother branham would be
[10:23] adding to the word of god and no man can
[10:26] add to the word or take away from the
[10:27] word without awful repercussions
[10:30] third sometimes brother branham was
[10:32] forgetful like all humans
[10:34] and this is easily seen in different
[10:36] stories that he tells sometimes he
[10:37] forgets the details
[10:39] for example in the man from windsor the
[10:41] story changes numerous times but that
[10:43] doesn't stumble us because we know
[10:45] brother ram's a human and he's forgetful
[10:47] the main point of the story is that god
[10:49] was protecting his prophet and the power
[10:51] of jesus christ is eternally greater
[10:53] than the power of satan
[10:56] fourth a mistake is that brother branham
[10:58] is fallible and he doesn't know all
[11:00] things
[11:01] so for example in one quote brother bram
[11:02] said the human body is made up of 80
[11:04] percent water and petroleum
[11:07] the body's got to have the water in
[11:10] order to stay alive
[11:12] you're 80 something percent
[11:14] uh water petroleum anyhow and you've got
[11:17] to take these sources in to keep you
[11:20] alive
[11:23] but friends any study on petroleum will
[11:25] tell you
[11:26] petroleum is extremely toxic to any
[11:29] living thing friends petroleum is a
[11:31] liquid mixture that is refined to
[11:33] produce fuels like gasoline kerosene
[11:37] and diesel oil so in other words there's
[11:39] no gasoline or kerosene or diesel in the
[11:41] human body
[11:43] and so there's no petroleum in the human
[11:45] body and if it's injected to the human
[11:47] body there's awful things that take
[11:48] place the nervous system is affected
[11:51] it's also known to be a carcinogen as
[11:53] well
[11:54] a fifth type of human mistake is just a
[11:56] human opinion or prediction
[11:59] one example is like 1977 brother branham
[12:02] said total annihilation would come to
[12:04] the world by 1977 and of course we know
[12:06] that did not happen
[12:08] also brother branham's opinion about
[12:09] martin luther king jr leading millions
[12:12] into a hitler-like death trap that did
[12:14] not happen either
[12:16] a sixth type of mistake is brother
[12:17] ramsey's own dishonesty as he told us
[12:19] about his lie to the irs
[12:22] and so we clearly see a human lie cannot
[12:25] be thus saith the lord because god does
[12:27] not lie the scripture says
[12:30] and a seventh type of human mistake is
[12:32] exaggerations
[12:34] for example brother ram changes the
[12:35] number of people that were at the 1933
[12:38] ohio river baptism
[12:40] and there's numerous quotes from brother
[12:41] branham where he admits that he
[12:42] exaggerates at times such as in the
[12:45] second miracle 1951 he said quote may
[12:48] god help me not not to exaggerate but
[12:50] just be as honest as i believe from my
[12:53] heart end quote and also straight as the
[12:55] gate 1959 brother ram said quote i'm not
[12:58] very good at making a or estimating
[13:01] crowds because i usually exaggerate on
[13:03] it end quote
[13:08] correcting false beliefs about the tapes
[13:12] i'm going to go through four false
[13:14] beliefs i often hear about the tapes
[13:16] that are wrong and try to bring
[13:17] correction to
[13:18] them first people say you cannot correct
[13:21] a prophet and you cannot judge a prophet
[13:24] so there are no exceptions
[13:26] according to these people now of course
[13:28] some of them are getting this quote from
[13:30] the rapture in 1965 but they're
[13:31] misunderstanding the quote brother ram
[13:34] said quote but nobody set before a
[13:35] prophet
[13:36] because he was
[13:38] he was absolutely the word of god end
[13:40] quote
[13:43] so if you cannot correct a prophet the
[13:45] prophet is infallible he's equal to god
[13:49] and if you cannot correct a prophet then
[13:50] peter was not a prophet but we know he
[13:52] was
[13:53] because paul corrected peter in
[13:55] galatians chapter 2.
[13:57] peter would not have fellowship with the
[13:58] gentiles because he was fearful of the
[14:00] jewish teachers and so he would not eat
[14:03] with the gentiles
[14:04] but paul corrected him to his face
[14:07] and friend anyone knows peter was a
[14:08] prophet he prophesied in second peter
[14:10] chapter 3 about the day of the lord and
[14:13] the fervent heat that would consume the
[14:14] earth and even brother branham called
[14:16] peter a prophet in 1961 god being
[14:19] misunderstood quote
[14:21] then god had a prophet there who could
[14:23] stand up and speak peter said you men of
[14:26] jerusalem and you that dwell in judea
[14:28] don't misunderstand this
[14:30] end quote
[14:32] so if you believe a prophet cannot be
[14:34] corrected then you're making brother
[14:36] rams own words contradict themselves
[14:38] because brother ram said peter was a
[14:40] prophet and yet he was corrected by paul
[14:43] if you cannot correct a prophet then you
[14:45] would have to come to the conclusion
[14:46] that brother brahm lied or was deceived
[14:49] numerous times when he said he was
[14:51] corrected by his wife brother sherrod
[14:54] and other people and of course i have an
[14:56] entire video about this topic if you'd
[14:58] like to watch that please contact me
[15:00] it's on my youtube channel
[15:02] friends even saint paul
[15:04] was wrong in his human mind at times
[15:06] for he did not know he was addressing
[15:08] the high priest in acts 23 verses one
[15:11] through five
[15:12] so if you say a prophet can never be
[15:14] corrected you're contradicting acts 23
[15:17] verses one through five
[15:18] friends some people are so delusional
[15:20] they said you don't even need to check a
[15:22] genuine prophet of god
[15:24] that's completely contrary to the
[15:25] scripture first thessalonians 5 says
[15:27] prove all things brother graham said
[15:29] test me by the word brotherham said we
[15:31] must prove all things by the scripture
[15:34] and acts 17 verse 11 records the holy
[15:36] spirit saying the bereans were more
[15:38] noble than the thessalonicans because
[15:41] they searched the scriptures daily to
[15:43] find out whether the things paul said
[15:44] were correct or not so the holy spirit
[15:47] gives a spiritual attribute of royalty
[15:49] to those people who will take what the
[15:51] prophet said and make sure it was right
[15:54] every day by searching the scriptures
[15:56] remember friends brother ram said his
[15:58] wife was his correction you can look
[15:59] that quote up quote my wife she's my
[16:02] correction
[16:03] end quote
[16:05] also there's a quote from be not afraid
[16:07] 1961 where brother graham's wife
[16:10] admitted brother branham could be wrong
[16:11] on so many things brother ram said quote
[16:14] my wife she said you can say so many
[16:17] things wrong and that's right she sure
[16:19] is right on that end quote so brother
[16:22] adam even admits he can say so many
[16:24] things wrong
[16:25] and yet branham tabernacle will say
[16:27] every word is right every word is thus
[16:29] saith the lord
[16:32] in the sermon the god who's rich in
[16:33] mercy 1965 brother branham noted that
[16:36] there were theologians sitting behind
[16:37] him and he said quote maybe they will
[16:39] correct me when i'm wrong i hope so end
[16:42] quote
[16:44] so friends here's a true prophet of god
[16:46] brother branham hoping the theologians
[16:48] would correct him when he's wrong
[16:49] brother was not lying
[16:51] he was humble he knew he was a human he
[16:54] made regular human mistakes like all of
[16:55] us and he hoped to be corrected
[16:58] that's the same thing i desire or any
[17:00] other preacher
[17:01] we're going to make human mistakes so we
[17:03] want to be corrected when we're wrong
[17:05] friends if brother adam gave no specific
[17:08] or clear explanation of why he changed
[17:10] the teaching then you'd have to assume
[17:12] both opposing statements were true
[17:15] since they can only say what's on the
[17:17] tapes and cannot correct a prophet and
[17:19] this would lead to many
[17:20] misunderstandings for example the white
[17:22] horse rider in 1960 and 1961 brother
[17:25] brahm said it was the holy ghost and
[17:27] then in 1963 he said it's the antichrist
[17:29] spirit so if you believe every word is
[17:31] thus saith the lord then that one symbol
[17:33] has two meanings it's the antichrist
[17:36] sometimes that's the holy ghost
[17:37] sometimes
[17:38] friends people who believe this are
[17:40] tossed back and forth just like
[17:41] ephesians 4 says they're not sitting
[17:43] under the holy ghost filled five full
[17:46] ministry so they're tossed by every wind
[17:48] of doctrine
[17:50] and of course the truth is the white
[17:51] horse rider was the antichrist spirit
[17:53] because brother ram taught that with us
[17:54] saith the lord and the four horse riders
[17:56] were combating the four beasts
[17:59] so the four forms of the antichrist were
[18:01] battling the four forms of the holy
[18:02] ghost
[18:03] friends some of these people who say you
[18:05] cannot correct or judge a prophet
[18:07] are contradicting themselves because
[18:09] they say you can't judge a prophet
[18:11] and yet then they say brother ram grew
[18:13] in revelation
[18:14] if brother ram didn't say he grew in
[18:16] revelation on a certain specific topic
[18:18] then you can't assume it and you can't
[18:20] correct it
[18:22] so again when people make these false
[18:24] statements they're contradicting
[18:25] themselves
[18:27] i've witnessed preachers say this they
[18:28] say you cannot correct a prophet but
[18:30] then they'll only preach one side of a
[18:32] subject when brother branham has two
[18:34] different opinions on the same subject
[18:36] like the promised land what did israel
[18:38] take in the promised land represent in
[18:40] one case brother graham said it typed
[18:42] the baptism of the holy ghost but in
[18:44] more quotes he said it typed the
[18:45] millennium well which one's right the
[18:47] only one that makes sense because there
[18:49] was wars and death and fighting in the
[18:51] promised land is that the promised land
[18:53] types the baptism of the holy ghost
[18:55] there be no wars or killings or any of
[18:57] that during the millennium because it's
[18:58] a time of a thousand years of peace
[19:01] second you can correct brother branham
[19:03] but not on doctrine
[19:06] so doctrine is the only exception
[19:08] now of course this is wrong because paul
[19:10] corrected peter who was a prophet
[19:12] on doctrine in galatians chapter 2.
[19:15] also brother cheryl corrected brother
[19:16] branham on his doctrine of receiving
[19:18] gifts at first brother branham would not
[19:20] receive gifts
[19:21] he taught the people that but then after
[19:23] brother showed him some scriptures about
[19:26] how other people can be blessed
[19:28] with heavenly rewards if he received
[19:30] their gifts brother ham changed his ways
[19:33] a third false belief is that brother
[19:35] random had vindicated opinions i heard a
[19:38] preacher say this online
[19:40] he was talking about men wearing shorts
[19:42] and said brother ram's opinion was that
[19:43] men should not wear shorts and this
[19:46] brother said i'll take brother ram's
[19:47] opinion because his opinions are
[19:48] vindicated
[19:50] well this is wrong in two ways human
[19:52] opinions are never vindicated as
[19:54] absolute truths because they're not thus
[19:56] saith the lord when there's room for
[19:58] human opinion that's called a christian
[19:59] liberty and saint paul talks about that
[20:02] i wrote about that in my 2019 book about
[20:04] restoring christian modesty and the
[20:06] different christian liberties that we
[20:07] have
[20:08] and second the preacher didn't realize
[20:10] that it's actually a bible doctrine that
[20:12] men and women should not wear shorts
[20:14] because we can prove from the book of
[20:16] isaiah that exposing the thigh is
[20:18] nakedness so that is a bible doctrine
[20:21] so the brother didn't understand that
[20:24] modesty is a bible doctrine and called
[20:26] it an opinion so of course the preacher
[20:28] was wrong
[20:29] and just to back this up brother braham
[20:30] said his opinion was like anyone else's
[20:33] like in marriage in divorce 1965
[20:35] quote it can't be my own opinion because
[20:37] my opinion is just like anybody else's
[20:40] end quote
[20:42] also brother brown was open to anyone
[20:44] correcting him even the janitor by the
[20:47] scripture in church order 1963 brother
[20:49] ram said quote i don't care if you're
[20:52] one of the trustees or or if you're the
[20:54] janitor whoever you are your duty bound
[20:56] to me as a brother in christ to tell me
[20:58] when i'm wrong scripturally if there's a
[21:00] question let's sit down and solve it out
[21:02] together end quote
[21:05] so brother ram never exalted himself
[21:06] above the trustees or the janitor he was
[21:09] a humble holy ghost-filled christian
[21:11] like all of us should be and he
[21:12] recognized that his opinions were no
[21:14] better than anybody else's
[21:16] remember friends in the sermon he cares
[21:18] do you care in 1963 regarding the martin
[21:21] luther king jr prophecy brother ram said
[21:23] he had nothing on it from the lord he
[21:26] said he could be altogether wrong in his
[21:28] thought about martin luther king jr he
[21:30] said quote i don't know i can't say
[21:32] that's just my opinion end quote
[21:35] so again there's no such thing as a
[21:37] vindicated opinion there is such a thing
[21:39] as the vindicated word of god because
[21:41] that's spoken with thus saith the lord
[21:43] but human opinions fall under the area
[21:45] of christian liberties
[21:47] and fourth and finally a false statement
[21:49] is you should only say what the tapes
[21:51] say
[21:52] friends people that say you should only
[21:53] say what the tapes say are contradicting
[21:56] themselves and you could use many
[21:57] examples again with the white horse
[21:59] rider in 1977
[22:01] but one i found recently is with the
[22:02] sixth major vision
[22:04] preachers will say say what the tapes
[22:06] say but then they won't agree with the
[22:08] other numerous quotes
[22:10] about the sixth vision such as when
[22:12] brother ram said the sixth vision was
[22:14] not a woman but a church and yet they'll
[22:17] say the sixth vision was fulfilled by a
[22:19] woman kamala harris why aren't they
[22:21] saying what the tapes say when the tapes
[22:23] say the sixth vision is not a woman a
[22:26] few other examples are the tapes say
[22:28] billy paul was the promised joseph in
[22:30] 1951. why don't they call billy paul the
[22:32] promise joseph and not joseph branham
[22:34] why aren't they saying what the tapes
[22:36] say the tapes say arizona could not have
[22:38] another generation due to the high birth
[22:41] rates of mental retardation
[22:43] and the tapes say the entire world would
[22:45] be annihilated by 1977 and of course we
[22:48] know that wasn't the case
[22:49] so the people who say say what the tapes
[22:51] say are not saying what the tapes say
[22:54] they're only picking and choosing what
[22:55] they want to say about what's on the
[22:57] tapes
[22:59] 60 plus proofs not every word on
[23:02] brethren's tapes was thus saith the lord
[23:06] friends by god's grace i'll go year by
[23:08] year and i'll show brother graham's
[23:10] quotes that again show not every word
[23:11] was thus saith the lord so beginning in
[23:14] 1951
[23:16] believe us thou this brother ram said
[23:18] quote my joseph was right with me when
[23:20] and i didn't know it the little baby
[23:22] that i thought would be joseph is a
[23:24] little girl and i called her sarah end
[23:26] quote
[23:27] so here brother random calls billy paul
[23:29] as promised joseph but joseph was born
[23:32] four years later in 1955. so what is the
[23:34] truth the truth is brother branham was
[23:36] assuming billy paul was his promise
[23:38] joseph because he hadn't had him yet
[23:40] and the truth was brother bran was wrong
[23:42] his promise joseph would come four years
[23:44] later
[23:46] second from 1951 believers thou this
[23:49] same sermon brother ram said quote and
[23:51] maybe my little boy would fully be a
[23:53] prophet sent from god i pray to that end
[23:55] quote
[23:56] so brother ram prayed for billy paul to
[23:58] be a full prophet now of course this was
[24:00] not thus saith the lord because eight
[24:02] years later and let us see god 1959
[24:05] brother ram said quote but he seems like
[24:08] he doesn't have a call to be a preacher
[24:10] end quote so billy paul is not a full
[24:13] prophet
[24:14] let alone even a preacher
[24:16] so what's the truth behind this prayer
[24:17] from 1951 it was just brother graham's
[24:20] human desire his fatherly desire
[24:22] of course it was wrong billy paul never
[24:24] became a full prophet
[24:26] moving to 1952
[24:29] in february believing god brother
[24:31] branham said
[24:32] quote prayer it even changes everything
[24:35] it will change the mind of god
[24:37] end quote
[24:38] so here brother rahm said you can change
[24:40] god's mind but later in numerous
[24:42] occasions brother ram said god can never
[24:44] change his mind about anything
[24:46] in the sermon 1965 does god ever change
[24:49] his mind about his word brother braham
[24:51] said quote god never changes his mind
[24:52] about anything end quote
[24:55] then later he says quote he will let you
[24:57] go his permissive will but he won't
[24:59] change his mind he won't change his plan
[25:02] he won't change his word for you no sir
[25:05] you've got to change end quote
[25:07] so what's the truth the truth is prayer
[25:10] cannot change the mind of god brother
[25:12] later said prayer was to change our
[25:14] minds to the perfect will of god
[25:16] now of course brother brown was speaking
[25:17] of hezekiah when he said there in 1952
[25:20] that prayer can change the mind of god
[25:23] but if we look at that case honestly
[25:25] hezekiah was praying for the permissive
[25:27] will of god and god gave it to him
[25:30] and brother of course recognized that
[25:31] later
[25:32] so god didn't change his mind but god
[25:34] gave hezekiah the permissible of god
[25:36] just like he gave balaam the permissive
[25:38] will of god
[25:40] next in early spiritual experiences 1952
[25:43] brother branham said the third person of
[25:44] the trinity burned in his heart
[25:46] and he loved him quote we love him that
[25:49] great third person of the trinity who
[25:50] burns through our hearts and we love him
[25:53] end quote
[25:55] nine years later brother graham said
[25:56] trinitarianism is of the devil
[25:59] he said quote trinitarianism is of the
[26:01] devil i say that with thus saith the
[26:02] lord end quote
[26:04] so what is the truth the truth is there
[26:07] is no third person of the trinity
[26:09] as brother ram gave us thus saith the
[26:10] lord on this topic
[26:12] and so brother ram grew in his
[26:13] understanding brother iran changed his
[26:15] doctrine he was a trinitarian but then
[26:17] he moved to a bible-believing one-person
[26:20] godhead believer
[26:22] moving on to 1953 in march
[26:26] brother ram said the promised land typed
[26:28] the millennium quote and the fourth was
[26:30] when they went into the promised land
[26:31] which was the millennium end quote
[26:34] seven years later in adoption part one
[26:36] brother branham said the promised land
[26:38] did not represent the millennium quote
[26:41] now canaan does not represent the age of
[26:43] the millennium it only represents the
[26:45] age of the overcomer the dispensation of
[26:46] overcoming because in canaan they killed
[26:49] and burned and took cities and there'll
[26:51] be no death in the millennium end quote
[26:54] so which one is the truth the truth is
[26:56] the one from adoption 1960 where byram
[26:59] said canaan does not represent the
[27:00] millennium it represents the holy ghost
[27:02] baptism for believers
[27:04] next in june of 1953 brother braham said
[27:07] christ died a sinner
[27:09] and of course i believe this was a slip
[27:10] of the tongue
[27:12] because he seems he said it right in the
[27:14] other times when he spoke on this
[27:15] subject
[27:16] brother ram said quote and when they
[27:18] killed him and he died a sinner end
[27:20] quote friends hebrews 4 15 says jesus
[27:24] was in all points tempted like as we are
[27:26] yet without sin so jesus christ did not
[27:29] die a sinner but he did die with the
[27:31] sins of the entire world upon him
[27:35] brother ram got this right in 1954 in
[27:37] god perfecting his church quote he died
[27:40] a sinner and not sin that he had done
[27:42] but my sin and your sin on him drove him
[27:45] to the cross end quote also in june of
[27:48] 1953 brother ram said christ broke the
[27:51] law himself again i believe this was a
[27:53] slip of the tongue
[27:54] christ did not break the law christ
[27:56] fulfilled the law
[27:57] quote they couldn't keep the law christ
[27:59] was come and broke the law himself
[28:02] because grace had already provided a
[28:03] savior
[28:04] moses provided a way of escape end quote
[28:07] so i believe this was a slip of the
[28:08] tongue
[28:09] the truth is christ never broke the law
[28:11] he fulfilled the law
[28:13] christ did break the traditions of the
[28:15] elders which were not the word they were
[28:17] not the law
[28:18] like the washing of hands and washing of
[28:20] pots and so forth but christ never broke
[28:22] god's word
[28:24] in november 1953 brother brahm said
[28:27] jesus never did commission to teach the
[28:29] word of god
[28:30] quote he didn't say go teach the word he
[28:33] said go preach the gospel
[28:36] he never did commission go teach the
[28:38] word end quote
[28:40] friends if you read matthew 28 19 jesus
[28:42] said quote go ye therefore and teach all
[28:44] nations end quote
[28:46] so the truth is brother branham was just
[28:48] confused on this or he was wrong
[28:50] later he probably grew in his revelation
[28:51] and understanding of this but jesus
[28:53] christ did say go and teach all nations
[28:57] go and teach the word of god
[28:59] next in 1954 i only have one quote
[29:03] it's from march what think he christ
[29:06] brother ram said quote moses a very
[29:08] outstanding character of the bible the
[29:10] greatest of all the prophets end quote
[29:13] so here brother ram said moses was the
[29:14] greatest of all prophets but one year
[29:17] later he said john the baptist was the
[29:18] greatest of prophets and then three
[29:20] months after that he says jesus was the
[29:22] greatest of all the prophets so what is
[29:24] the truth jesus is the greatest prophet
[29:26] of all because he was a god prophet but
[29:28] john the baptist was the greatest of the
[29:31] old testament prophets even greater than
[29:33] moses and that was according to jesus
[29:35] christ in matthew chapter 11. brother
[29:37] branham said quote when jesus came he
[29:39] was considered
[29:40] john was the greatest of all the
[29:42] prophets because the rest of them spoke
[29:44] of jesus but john said behold the lamb
[29:46] of god that take away the sin of the
[29:47] world end quote
[29:50] and then in blind bartimaeus 1955
[29:52] brother graham said quote and the
[29:53] greatest of all the prophets and all the
[29:55] king and lord and master of them was
[29:58] jesus end quote
[30:00] next in 1955 there's only one quote i
[30:03] found that was an honest mistake or
[30:04] change of doctrine
[30:06] it was in being led of the holy spirit
[30:08] in 1955 but the ramp said quote couldn't
[30:11] you believe you can lose your salvation
[30:13] backslide from god so can you the
[30:15] healing end quote
[30:17] i agree with this quote that brother
[30:19] brahms said you can lose your salvation
[30:20] i believe that because of other quotes
[30:22] brother brown gave specifically about
[30:24] judas iscariot and questions and answers
[30:26] part 1
[30:27] 1964 quote was judas iscariot's name
[30:30] blotted out of the lamb's book of life
[30:32] or was it ever on it yes it was on it
[30:35] and was blotted out end quote
[30:38] so judas's name was on the book of life
[30:40] but it was blotted out not the lamb's
[30:42] book of life as brother i'm taught later
[30:44] no names can be blotted off the lamb's
[30:46] book of life but getting back to you can
[30:48] lose your salvation in 1957 brother
[30:51] brahm said you could not lose your
[30:52] salvation quote and god wouldn't save
[30:55] you here knowing he was going to lose
[30:56] you down you might be worked up and
[30:59] think you are saved here that might be
[31:00] true but let me tell you something when
[31:02] you're really saved god don't save you
[31:04] here and know he's going to lose you
[31:06] there end quote
[31:08] so on this topic of losing your
[31:10] salvation you have quotes on both sides
[31:11] which one is true well according to the
[31:13] scripture the one that's true is a
[31:15] person can lose their salvation because
[31:17] jesus said in revelation chapter 3 that
[31:19] if people do not overcome he will blot
[31:21] out their names out of the book of life
[31:23] and of course there's many scriptures in
[31:25] the book of hebrews about people that
[31:26] were sanctified and yet then did despite
[31:29] the spirit of grace and trotted
[31:31] underfoot the son of god they lost their
[31:33] salvation
[31:34] they tasted of the good word of god but
[31:36] then they left the faith and it could be
[31:38] no more renewed unto salvation
[31:42] next in 1957
[31:45] in march brother ram said rebecca his
[31:47] daughter would take his place in seeing
[31:50] visions
[31:51] quote little rebecca who i believe is
[31:53] going to maybe take my place someday
[31:56] she's seen her first vision just
[31:58] recently end quote now of course we know
[32:01] sister rebecca did not take brother
[32:02] branham's place seeing visions and
[32:04] giving discernments in the prayer lines
[32:07] and prophesying with us saith the lord
[32:08] so this was brother ram's own human
[32:10] opinion his own desire as a father
[32:13] next in june of 57 brother ram plainly
[32:16] said his idea was not thus saith the
[32:18] lord
[32:19] in faith once delivered to the saints he
[32:21] said quote i don't know this may this
[32:23] just is my feeling not thus saith the
[32:25] lord this is william branham i feel that
[32:27] my ministry is closing in america see
[32:29] about finished end quote
[32:32] so if branham tabernacle makes this
[32:34] quote thus saith the lord they're
[32:35] contradicting their own prophet because
[32:37] brahm said this is not thus saith the
[32:38] lord
[32:40] next in october of 57 brother ram said
[32:43] the new birth is not the baptism of the
[32:45] holy ghost quote no when you believe on
[32:47] the lord jesus christ you then have the
[32:50] new birth when you believe on the lord
[32:52] you receive a new thought a new life but
[32:54] it isn't the baptism of the holy ghost
[32:56] end quote
[32:57] he also said this later in 1962 the key
[33:00] to the door quote but new birth is not
[33:02] the baptism of the holy spirit end quote
[33:05] brother branham of course corrected this
[33:07] in the church age book he wrote what is
[33:10] the baptism with the holy ghost it is
[33:11] the spirit baptizing you into the body
[33:13] of christ it is the new birth it is the
[33:16] spirit of god coming in and filling you
[33:19] after you have repented having heard his
[33:21] word and been baptized in water as an
[33:23] answer of a good conscience toward god
[33:25] end quote
[33:27] so the truth is the new birth and
[33:28] baptism of the holy ghost are one in the
[33:30] same
[33:31] in 1958 i only have one quote it's from
[33:35] july by faith moses brother branham
[33:38] predicted total annihilation for the
[33:40] whole world before 77 quote and then
[33:44] there will come a total annihilation the
[33:45] entire nation will be wiped out and that
[33:48] i predict now this is not the lord
[33:50] saying this the other about the woman it
[33:52] is is the lord but i predicted in 1933
[33:55] that the world would meet total
[33:56] annihilation before 77 end quote
[33:59] and then later on he said quote but i
[34:01] seen the nation in total annihilation
[34:03] just stumps of trees and things like
[34:05] that left end quote
[34:07] so friends total annihilation did not
[34:09] come to the world before 77 and total
[34:12] annihilation did not come to united
[34:14] states before 77 with only tree stumps
[34:16] left
[34:17] in 1959 it only had one quote
[34:20] in this quote from thinking on our way
[34:22] brother branham admitted to lying to the
[34:23] irs and of course his lie to the irs was
[34:26] not thus saith the lord he said quote
[34:28] something said to me can you lay your
[34:30] lying hands on that child and i've lied
[34:32] to you and i cause my wife to lie end
[34:35] quote
[34:36] the lord did not tell brother ram to lie
[34:38] so the brotherhood's lie was not thus
[34:40] saith the lord
[34:42] moving ahead to 1960
[34:46] in march the sermon y brother ram said
[34:48] mary had the egg for the conception of
[34:50] jesus's body in her womb quote and in
[34:53] this case mary had the the egg but the
[34:56] germ the blood cell
[34:57] come from god the creator who made it
[34:59] end quote of course brother ram later
[35:01] said god created both the egg and the
[35:03] germ or the sperm
[35:06] in may of 1960 brother ram said elisha
[35:10] was on mount transfiguration and not
[35:12] elijah so the truth is bill brotherham
[35:15] had a slip of the tongue or maybe was
[35:17] forgetful
[35:18] the truth is elijah was on mount
[35:20] transfiguration
[35:22] quote and elisha had went to heaven 500
[35:25] years before that but on mount
[35:27] transfiguration they were found talking
[35:29] with jesus end quote
[35:31] again in may of 1960 brother ram said
[35:35] 16 men died at ai
[35:37] but it was 32 according to joshua
[35:40] chapter 7 verse 5. in adoption part 1
[35:43] brother ram said quote took the life of
[35:45] 16 men i think it was 16 maybe more i
[35:47] believe it was 16 men that was dead end
[35:50] quote
[35:52] again in may of 1960 bill graham said he
[35:55] was a cockle burr
[35:56] but changed to a wheat
[35:58] but of course later in the church age
[36:00] book brotherhood said you always were
[36:02] wheat seed
[36:04] so adoption part one quote i was a
[36:06] cockle bur i was born in sin shaped
[36:09] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[36:11] born amongst sinners father and mother
[36:13] and all my whole family sinners i was a
[36:15] cockle burr but all of a sudden i became
[36:18] a wheat grain end quote
[36:21] brother bran also taught this later in
[36:22] the token 1963 he said quote his desires
[36:26] and ambitions is of heaven because he's
[36:28] changed from a cocklebur to a wheat end
[36:31] quote
[36:32] then the church age book brother ram
[36:34] says you always were what you were he
[36:37] says quote you always were a sheep you
[36:39] never were a pig or a dog turned into a
[36:41] sheep that is impossible for every kind
[36:44] of life produces the same kind
[36:46] and there is no change in specie end
[36:49] quote
[36:50] so in the natural a cockle burr can
[36:52] never change into a wheat grain and
[36:55] brother brahm uses that same thinking
[36:56] that same logic in the church age book
[36:58] to say you were never a pig changed into
[37:01] a sheep
[37:02] he said it's impossible to change the
[37:04] life of the seed
[37:06] and that's true in december 1960 brother
[37:09] brandon said rebecca met her bride
[37:12] so if this is thus saith the lord
[37:14] rebecca married a woman but we know this
[37:17] was a slip of the tongue from brother
[37:18] branham quote for as rebecca rode the
[37:21] camel and jumped off the camel right
[37:22] between the house of abraham out in the
[37:25] field she met her bride end quote
[37:29] and again there's numerous quotes like
[37:30] this and of course there's quotes on the
[37:32] other side where brother bram said
[37:33] rebecca met her bridegroom so he
[37:35] corrected that slip of the tongue
[37:38] also in december 1960 brother graham
[37:40] said the white horse rider was the holy
[37:42] spirit
[37:43] quote the sixth chapter deals with uh
[37:46] with the white horse which was the holy
[37:47] spirit went forth conquering to conquer
[37:50] first went forth was the holy ghost
[37:52] across the earth conquering and to
[37:54] conquer end quote
[37:57] also in the patmos vision brother braham
[37:58] said the same
[37:59] he said the white horse rider was the
[38:01] same
[38:02] in revelation 6 as revelation 19.
[38:05] he said quote when the white horse no
[38:08] it's six when the white horse rider went
[38:10] forth he was given a bow to conquer and
[38:12] to conquer and a sword went out of his
[38:14] mouth what was he the white horse rider
[38:16] of revelation notice the sword out of
[38:19] his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword
[38:21] the word end quote
[38:23] so in that quote brother ram says
[38:25] the white horse rider was the same
[38:26] person in revelation 6 and revelation 19
[38:29] but of course later in 1963 brother ram
[38:32] said the revelation 6 white horse rider
[38:34] was the antichrist not the same white
[38:36] horse rider as revelation 19 which was
[38:38] jesus christ the word of god
[38:42] this is the end of part one as there
[38:44] will likely be one or two more parts in
[38:46] this short series
[38:49] lord willing in the next part i'll show
[38:51] 42 more honest human mistakes brother
[38:54] brandon made for a total of 63 human
[38:56] mistakes that i've compiled to date
[38:59] and then offer a plea and prayer for the
[39:01] tape worshipers to repent
[39:03] i'm also going to publish the audio of
[39:05] this series on our defending the message
[39:07] podcast in order to help believers who
[39:09] struggle with knowing whether or not to
[39:11] trust branham tabernacles current
[39:13] leadership in all humility i believe
[39:16] they are not trustworthy due to their 21
[39:19] false doctrines they currently propagate
[39:22] in order to exalt the tapes to
[39:23] infallibility and exalt brother branham
[39:26] to the greatest prophet who ever lived
[39:28] without any biblical authority to do so
[39:30] and they also either purposely or
[39:32] ignorantly forget to add except for
[39:34] jesus
[39:36] thank you friends for all your support
[39:38] and positive feedback god bless you and
[39:40] may jesus christ be the desire of your
[39:42] heart
