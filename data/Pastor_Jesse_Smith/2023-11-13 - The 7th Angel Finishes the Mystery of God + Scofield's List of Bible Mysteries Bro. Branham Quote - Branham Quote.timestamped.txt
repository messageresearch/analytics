[1:54] Mysteries are now in the 11th verse and
[1:58] he answered and said un them because
[2:00] it's given to you his
[2:02] disciples because it is given to you to
[2:06] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[2:08] heaven but not to them but to them it is
[2:13] not given the Mysteries here's the
[2:17] mystery a mystery is
[2:21] scripture is a previously hidden
[2:26] truth now divinely revealed

[4:04] of god even

[4:09] the Incarnate fullness of the godhead
[4:14] embodied in whom all Divine wisdom and
[4:18] godliness is restored to man ninth

[4:47] 7 that's some of the Mysteries that this
[4:51] Angel is supposed to wind up all the
[4:54] Myster all the mysteries of God and the
[4:57] other may I say this with reverence
[5:00] and not referring to myself but
[5:02] referring to the angel of God the
[5:04] serpent seed that's been a hidden
[5:05] Mystery all through the years the grace
[5:08] straightened out not disgrace but real
[5:10] true Grace no such a thing as an eternal
[5:13] burning hell you'll burn for millions of
[5:16] years but anything it was eternal had
[5:18] never beginning our end and hell was
[5:20] created amen all these Mysteries the
[5:23] mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:26] without sensation but the person of
[5:28] Christ performing in you the same works
[5:30] that he did the mystery of water baptism
[5:33] where the extreme trinitarianism has
[5:36] brought it into titles of father son
[5:38] Holy Ghost and the Mystery of the
[5:39] godhead being fulfilled in the baptism
[5:42] of the name of Jesus Christ according to
[5:44] the book of the revelations that the
[5:46] church in this time was to receive
[5:48] there's some of the Mysteries the pillar
[5:50] of fire returning back
[5:55] amen that's the thing that's supposed to
[5:57] take place and we see it
[6:00] am praise the Lord oh how we could go on
[6:05] naming the Mysteries seeing that Pillar
[6:07] of Fire that led the children of Israel
[6:09] the same one that struck down Saul on
[6:12] his road down to Damascus and the same
[6:15] one coming with the same power doing the
[6:18] same things and revealing the same word
[6:20] staying word by word with the Bible
