TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] But he sets some in the church, teachers, apostles, prophets, gifts of healing, working of miracles, and all those things are set in the church. Do you believe that? Amen. I never need to stay worthy to be set out of the church. He set them in the church for the perfecting of the church. And to be in the church until he comes again. And to be in the church until he comes again. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show how the Bible and God's prophet brother William Maron Brandham teach that preachers are to keep preaching until Jesus returns. We're so thankful that we have the word of God, the Bible, the holy scriptures, which is our absolute. And then God in his mercy in the 20th century sent a genuine Bible-based prophet William Mary Brandham who pointed us back to the word of God restored the faith of the apostolic fathers according to Malachi 4:es 5 and 6 Matthew 17:11 Acts 3 20 and 21. It's been 60 years since God took brother Random home. And as we wait for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, we want to remain faithful to what the Bible teaches and what God's prophet pointed us to, the Holy Scriptures. This video will also go along with recent videos about the false doctrines coming out of Brandom Tabernacle. One of their main false doctrines is that everyone should stop preaching and just press play and obey. That's a false doctrine. That's heresy. And so, the truth of God's Bible will be declared in this video by God's grace. Let's start with a brief Bible foundation of how preachers are going to remain until Jesus comes. The first verse is the great commission. Matthew 28:19-20. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost. We know there is one name to the father, one name to the son, and one name to the holy ghost. And that's the name above all names according to Philippians chapter 2. That's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 10 days later after Jesus said this, Jesus filled Peter with the Holy Ghost. As John the Baptist said, Jesus would baptize believers with the Holy Ghost. And then Peter in Acts 2:38 told new believers to repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. But verse 20, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. So Jesus says, "You're going to go, therefore, teach all nations." Teaching is one form of preaching. We know there's five preaching gifts. And notice they're going to teach until the end of the world. Jesus will be with us, all the believers, and all the apostles and preachers, pastors, evangelists, teachers, until the end of the world. 1 Corinthians 1:18 says, "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God." And then down in verse 21, for after that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God. It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. So 1 Corinthians 1:18 and 21 support the great commission. God chooses preaching to save believers and all nations must hear the preaching by living men and then the end will come. As Jesus said in Matthew 24, Jesus said in Matthew 24:14, "In this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come." And of course, this means living preachers, not dead preachers. Dead preachers cannot preach. They've already entered into their eternal reward. This is speaking of living preachers. Romans 10:14 and 15 say, "How can they call on him in whom they have not believed? How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? How shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach except they be sent? How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things. Ephesians 4 8-16 is an entire passage on the five-fold ministry. But verses 11, 12, and 13 show how preachers will preach until we all come in the unity of the faith, which means the coming of the Lord. And he gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Paul also told Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2, "Preach the word, be instant, in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine." So Paul as a prophet ordained preachers after him just like God's prophet brother Brandham ordained preachers after him. Paul didn't say sit down and just read my letters the whole time. No. Paul told Timothy you preach the word. Paul also said in Colossians 1:28 whom we preach speaking of Christ in you the hope of glory the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We preach Christ, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect or mature in Christ Jesus. So the maturity of the believer comes through the preaching, the hearing of the word, taking heed to warnings. Every person must receive the teaching, the wisdom of God, and that brings maturity. Notice God manifests his word through preaching, not through pressing play, but through preaching. Titus 1:3, "But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our savior." So there's a very simple and short Bible foundation of how preachers are to preach until Jesus returns. He said, "Lo, I'm with you until the end of the world. This gospel must be preached to every nation. Then the end shall come." I'd also like to play a quote from Brother Ram's book, The Exposition of the Seven Church Ages in chapter 7. Brother Random said, "Christendom has become a labyrinth." He said, "What can help?" He said, "Only the one thing is needful." He's quoting Luke 10:42 where Mary came and sat and listened to Jesus preaching. Brother Ram said, "Return to Christ, looking to Christ as the only leader." Notice, not Joseph Brandham, not even brother Brandham. Christ is the only leader and walking in his footsteps, setting aside all other ways until we all reach the goal. and have come to the unity of the faith. So, brother Ram quotes Ephesians 4:13 till we all come in the unity of the faith. That's about the five-fold ministry. So, the one thing is needful. Come and hear the word of God being manifest through living holy ghostfilled preachers. That's how we come to the unity of the faith. As the heavenly master built everything on the ground of scriptures, so should we leave all peculiarities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of God which belongs to us all. With the Bible in our hand, brother Ram says we should cry, I believe what God has revealed in this book. I will obediently keep his commands. I hope for that which he has promised. Christians give ear. This is a beautiful section brother Random wrote by the grace of God. And notice with our Bible in our hand, the Bibles are absolute. God's commands are to preach until Jesus returns, not press play, sit down, and neglect your preaching gifts. God promised that preachers would preach and then the end would come. Now, I'd like to show six quotes from God's prophet, Brother Brandham, where he says, "Preachers must preach until Jesus returns." And again, Brother Ram never changed this. Brother Ram kept the same message because it was a Bible-based message. And I'll go in chronological order here. By the grace of God. The first quote is from March 1954, the resurrection of Jerus. Brother Random quotes Ephesians 4:11, speaking of the five-fold ministry. I never did say where they'd be set out of the church. So, brother So, notice Brother Ram said the gifts would never be set out of the church. Yet, Brandham Tabernacle, the current leadership, is setting the preaching gifts out of the church. But brother Ram said, "I never did say that." He set them in the church. So Jesus set those preaching gifts in the church for the perfecting of the church and to be in the church until he comes again. Beautiful quote, brother Ram, supporting the Bible teaching on the five-fold ministry. Let's listen to the quote. It's the same Lord. See, but he sets some in the church. Teachers, apostles, prophets, gifts of healing, working of miracles, and all those things are set in the church. You believe that? Amen. I never he say where they be set out of the church, he set them in the church for the perfecting of the church and to be in the church until he comes again. Second, from July 1954, God's provided way of healing. Brother Ram said preachers are doing their part to encourage people's faith. Preachers can't heal. He said but we have a part in doing it. That's preaching the gospel. That's one part in doing it. Brother Ram said these signs and wonders and everything. So everything is speaking of the five-fold ministry. The preaching is gifts and everything in the church to stimulate the church to keep the church together for every attribute of Jesus life until he returns again in glory. So notice preachers doing their part until he returns again in glory. Let's listen to the quote. Now these meetings and people gathering that's what it's for is to encourage faith to bring faith up. We couldn't heal certainly not but we have a part in doing it. That's preaching the gospel. That's one part in doing it. Another part would be speaking with tongues. That's part if it's by revelation. And a gift of prophecy. That's another uh thing. Then uh signs and wonders and everything is gifts and everything in the church to stimulate the church to keep the church together for every attribute of Jesus life until he returns again in glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. Again in July 54, God providing healing for this generation. Brother Ram said, "And he Jesus commissioned human beings to go to all the world and preach the gospel and demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost until he returns as a sign." Of course, brother Ram quoting Matthew 28:19 and 20, the great commission, human beings. So, not just Brother Random. It's not just press, play, and obey. It's human beings preaching until he returns. It's a sign of Jesus's great commission being fulfilled. Let's listen to the quote. And he commissioned human beings to go to all the world and preach the gospel and demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost until he returned as a sign. Yeah, it's God's provided sacrifice. Tonight is the person of the Lord Jesus in the person of the Holy Spirit here tonight proving himself to be Jehovah Gyra, the Lord's provided sacrifice for your healing tonight. Third, again in July 54, God providing healing for this generation. Brother Ram again quotes the great commission. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. How far? To all the world. And when this gospel is gone to all the world, then I will return. Brother Random again supports preachers preaching. And then the preaching going to every nation, then the end comes. Preachers will preach all the way to the end. Let's listen to the quote. He's our kinsman redeemer. Amen. God made flesh kin folks to us in order to redeem us from the curse of sin and sickness and tonight has sent the Holy Spirit to dwell with the church and show signs and wonders of healing and salvation until he returns again. Amen. How long was it to last? Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Go ye into all the world and demonstrate this power to every creature. These signs will follow them that believe. How far? To all the world. Yes. And when this gospel's gone to all the world, then I will return. That's right. These signs shall follow them to all the world in my name. They shall cast out demons. They shall speak with new tongues. Or if they take up a serpent or or drink a deadly thing, it would not harm them. And if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover. Jesus said that that would be the same sign. The fifth quote is a beautiful one from Perseverance 1962. Brother Ram said, "I believe there's a church coming into that perfection." He quotes the five-fold ministry, apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists for the perfecting of the church. He said, "The pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord." So, Brother Ram says, "The five-fold ministry will work right up to the coming of the Lord. We'll have preachers right up to the coming of the Lord." The preachers are never going to sit down and just press play. They're not going to neglect their gifts. They're not going to be wicked and slothful servants as Jesus said. Let's listen to the quote. Now I believe that there's a church coming into that perfection, that ministry of perfection where the offices were apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists for the perfecting of the church, then pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord. I believe that and I believe we're nearing that time now. I believe it so. And sixth and finally in October 62, the statue of perfect man. Brother Ram's closing the service. He's praying. He quotes Ephesians 4:11 during the prayer. For God is set in the church, apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists, all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for that perfection of the coming of the son of God. So we see brother Ram saying the five-fold ministry will bring the church to the perfection they need to be in the maturity they need to be in for the coming of the son of God. Preachers will preach until the coming of the son of God. Let's listen to the quote. For God has set in the church apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors, and evangelists all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it to that perfection of the coming of the son of God. Each one of these stones are material off of that one. This is material of this. Each one of these virtues belong to him and they're pouring out of him down to him. Amen. And next, real briefly, I'll just go over quickly some of these quotes I've been putting on videos recently where brother Ram supported preachers all the way up till his death and questions and answers on the seals. Should evangelists continue on the field? Brother Ram said, he said, "In this hour, of course, certainly by all means, don't change a thing." So, brother Ram said, "All the evangelistic work should continue and should never change. Don't change a single thing about the five-fold ministry." Yet, what has random tabernacle done? They've changed almost everything about the five-fold ministry. And notice, Brother Ram said, "If you do that, you'll get scrupled up. You become odd, peculiar. People walk into a church and they don't hear a living preacher. They hear a tape playing." That's a cult mentality. That's cultish behavior. He said, "Continue on your evangelistic service. just as you always did. In questions and answers part 364, brother Brandham, is it true no one should preach but you? He said no. Every man that feels a call of God upon his life get into the ministry and start preaching. We need them. Any man that's called of God needs to preach the gospel. Questions and answers part 464. Would we still be on fire and preach the gospel or is the time over? No. Keep preaching just as hard as you can preach, brother. Stay with it. I'm right with you. And then in birth pain 65, Bill Ram said, "These men, if they pick up this and goes out with it, they can make more sense to it. See, to bring it to a place you would, I just want to lay this seed and hope they can make it come to life." Now, the final section of this video, I just want to show three quotes where Brother Bram said, "We're still waiting for his coming." So, I know there might be some false teachers out there that will look at the quotes I've used that say, "Preachers must preach until he comes again," and they'll say, "Well, Jesus already came or something like that. The Lord has already come, so that's why we don't need preachers anymore." That's a lie. That's not found in the scripture, and it's not found in Brother Ram's quotes. We just saw six quotes where Brother Ram said, "The five-fold ministry will keep preaching until Jesus returns along with all those Bible verses." So here's three quotes where brother Ram says Jesus has not come yet. We're still waiting on the coming of the Lord and the coming of the Lord is still at hand. So only deceive people or people that are lying on purpose would say the Lord has already come and and therefore we don't need preachers. The first one is questions and answers part 364. Brother Random said that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the majesty on high and will come again in great power and glory. So this is 17 months after brother man preached the seven seals and he's still saying that Jesus is in heaven and he will come again. He hasn't come he will come again. Let's listen to the quote. To make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist. Amen. See, for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the majesty on high and will come again in great power and glory. But next is from what is the intraction on the mountain. I love this. July 65. Brother Ram's on the phone hookup with lots of churches. And he says all these churches in different states are all waiting for the coming of the Lord. That means the Lord hasn't come. Therefore, preachers should keep preaching. Brother Ram said Arizona was waiting for the coming of the Lord. Texas, Illinois, New York, Connecticut, Indiana, all waiting for the coming of the Lord. Let's listen to the quote. We send greetings from the east coast to the west to all our friends in Christ who's listening in. We send greetings over in San Jose, Brother Borders, the group up there. We send greetings up in the mountains, Prescott, Arizona, to Brother Leo Mercer and his group that's up there waiting for the coming of the Lord. We send greetings to those in Tucson that's gathered tonight waiting for the coming of the Lord. down in Houston, Texas, to those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord. Up in Chicago, to those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord up on the east coast, New York and Connecticut and the great groups up there that's waiting for the coming of the Lord. We don't have room here to seat them. So, we just have to send them the word through the the medium of the telephone. We send greetings to brother Junior Jackson tonight and his group down in Clarksville, brother Ruddle up on 62 and his group waiting for the coming of the Lord. And we're gathered here tonight at the home church, the tabernacle waiting for the coming of the Lord. And then finally, just three weeks before brother Ram passed in San Bernardino, California, Brother Ram said, "We preach the coming of the Lord is at hand. Let's get to the fields down there and notify the heathen. See, do something about it. So, weeks before he died, Brother Ram is still looking for the coming of the Lord. The Lord had not come in 1963. The Lord has not come yet. We're still waiting for the coming of the Lord. Therefore, we should keep preaching. Do something about the lost who have never heard the gospel. Let's listen to the quote. We preach the coming of the Lord is at hand. Let's get to the field and notify the heathen. do something about it. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Yesterday, this thought came to me about going through all the quotes where brother Ram said, "Preach until Jesus returns." So, we're thankful for those six quotes. Of course, there's probably more, but those are the first six I could find. Then, of course, the Bible fully backs it up, fully supports that preachers should preach until the Lord returns, until the great commission is fulfilled. And the end of the great commission is the gentile rapture, the pre-tribulation rapture by the grace of almighty God. We're thankful that Revelation 22 says, "The spirit and the bride say come." The voice of God is in the current five-fold ministry as far as preaching leadership. But as brother Ram said, every person can be the voice of God as they're yielded to the Holy Ghost. I and my father are one, not three. We are one. Amen. Glory. Glory to God. God is in him. God speaks to him. He's the war his own. But he is God's voice through human. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And every believer in tonight is likewise possessed. So possessed so completely given over to his words become like the words of Christ. He speaks and the word is made flesh. He speaks and the word is manifested. The works that I do shall you do also. These signs shall follow them that bleed. And as I've maintained for numerous years, the sign that the rapture will be upon us will be Revelation 13:16. As brother Ram taught in spoken word, his original seed 62. Brother Ram said, "I believe according to Revelation 13:16 that the bride will be forced to stop preaching." So, we see preachers will keep preaching. It seems right up until the time of the squeeze, the time right before the rapture where Jesus will pour out the latter reign, which Brother Ram calls rapturing faith in the church age book. Hopefully, by God's grace, we'll see the dead in Christ rise first. And that's because at Jesus's resurrection, the Old Testament saints, many of them arose and were seen in the city. So perhaps that will repeat here at the Gentile rapture by the grace of God. That would be such a stimulating event, would certainly raise our faith and give us rapturing faith. We're so thankful for the promises of God, the word of God. Let's continue to do what brother Random said. With our Bible in our hand, we should cry. I believe what God has revealed in this book, especially related to the five-fold ministry for this video. I will obediently keep his commands. I'll keep the commands of Jesus to keep preaching until all nations have heard the gospel. I hope for that which he has promised. He will bring us to a unity of the faith as promised in Ephesians 4:13. He'll do it through the preaching of the five-fold ministry. If you have any questions or concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. It never fails. [Music]
