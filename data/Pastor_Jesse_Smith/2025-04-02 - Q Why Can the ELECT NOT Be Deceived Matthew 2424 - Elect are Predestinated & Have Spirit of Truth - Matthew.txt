TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I different with our great famous brother Billy Graham in his message other day he said that the Antichrist has already deceived the elected but I do not believe that because it's not possible they were elected and their names put on the book of life before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about Matthew 24:4 why can the elect not be deceived it's a great question so by God's grace we'll try to answer it by the holy scriptures and by the quotations from God's Prophet brother William Maran brandham so the outline has about four sections first we'll look at the answer the two reasons the elect cannot be deceived as far as what I found there could be more second all Christians can be deceived in the human Spirit but not the soul and it would be a temporary deception not a long-term deception third we'll look at brother bram's use of Matthew 24:24 in the sermon called the anointed ones of the end time from 1965 and lastly we'll look at the closest Ministries that deceive one interesting note brother Bram said deceive the elect if it were possible 191 times and 1965 was the year he said it the most with 51 quotes and remember today is the greatest this day of deception according to Paul in 2 Timothy 3 it's verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived there has never been a day of Greater deception than today so it's so important that we have the spirit of Truth which is one of the reasons that the elect cannot be deceived so here's the full question why can the elect not be deceived Matthew 24:24 says if it were possible the elect cannot be deceived and that means both wise and foolish cannot be deceived that's a great point please make a video on why the true Christians will not take the mark of the beast so let's look at the scripture Matthew 24:24 for there shall rise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now the reason it says if according to my humble opinion is that the foolish virgins are scarcely saved as lot is the type of the foolish virgin in the Old Testament lot basically had to be pulled out of Sodom by the angel but Abraham wasn't anywhere near Sodom remember Abraham was able to look from a far distance and see the smoke Rising after God had destroyed Sodom and gomorah with fire and brimstone so Abraham the type of the wise virgin was nowhere near Sodom and Gomorrah now the word scarcely in Greek means with difficulty or hardly again we can see how uh lot was hardly saved out of Sodom and even his wife turned around to look back at Sodom and then Jesus uses that he uses an example of an unbeliever remember Lot's wife as Jesus said in Luke 17 so we can use the good testimonies of Believers or we can use the failures of unbelievers as motivation to always believe Christ always obey the Lord Jesus Christ and remember friends we always have two kinds of Believers that are saved and two kinds of Believers that are lost brother R told us three kinds of Believers but then the church book he said there's another class of believer which is the foolish virgin now we find this in many places but one in particular is revelation 2211 it starts off with the unjust which are the people that were never saved then it goes to the filthy like Judas a scarat they were saved for a while but then they forfeited their salvation and became unclean those are the two types of lost people unjust filthy then you have two kinds of save people righteous like lot and then and holy like Abraham or the example from the cross of Jesus was Jesus was a type of the foolish virgin and then the save Thief was a type of the foolish virgin just scarcely barely saved now the first reason why the elect cannot be deceived is because a predestination God's choosing in his mind before the foundation of the world we see this in Ephesians 1: 4 and 5 Revelation 138 their names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world therefore they cannot go along with the Beast system and then Romans 8: 29-35 that speaks of predestination and the five steps of predestination as I have a video on that if You' like a link to that I'll leave it in the description by the grace of God I'll play a quote here from but it wasn't so from the beginning and brother brandham cites Romans 8 and Revelation 13:8 as a reason the elect cannot be deceived let's listen to the quote and just about the time the Christ poured out his holy spirit it come on the scene the Antichrist come on the scene just about the time in the last days when the Holy Spirit begin to reveal himself the Antichrist reveals himself and about the time the coming of Christ the an of spirit comes also the Antichrist spirit so we see they Wen one with another Jesus said so close to it would deceive the very elected if it was possible uh different with our great famous brother Billy Graham in his message other day he said that the Antichrist has already deceived the elected but I do not believe that because it's not possible they were elected and their names put on the book of life before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain now who it is I don't know see but the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the Antichrist will deceive all upon the Earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world so you see we're pulling and sing to try to find where those people are that their name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life all that he forew he called those that he knew called he justified those who he justified he has already glorified so what do we got to fear about the thing of it is you say well will this live loose that shows that your name isn't on the book that's exactly right that proves that you wasn't when you try to live any kind of life and that you want to live that shows you haven't got it if you're a real Christian you'll live the real life because the Life of Christ is in you and you can do nothing else but Live the Life of Christ there's a few other verses that might be helpful acts 17 verse 26 says God has bounds that we cannot pass in the natural so he must have the same boundaries in the spiritual God will only let us go so far in the natural boundaries where we live where we travel where we go the Bible said he has determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their inhabitation so God determined our church age whether oldest or new testament and then how far we would go physically and Also spiritually God's already determined the wise virgin and the foolish virgin in his mind before the foundation of the world and this all goes back to his plan like Romans 9:21 says hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel under honor and another under dishonor so God has power over his creation and Friends our own life will prove whether we're a vessel of Honor or dishonor honor if we love the Lord Jesus Christ that proves we're a vessel of Honor if we want to believe all the word of God that's proof that we are a vessel of Honor we're the elect we're the Holy Ghost filled Saints brother Ram said one proof of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that you want to be in the word all the way you want to obey all the word of God so that's the first reason the second reason is because we have the spirit of Truth or God sends us the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul it's also called The Seed of God that God sends to be inside of us so the first reason is predestination the second reason is that we actually receive the seed of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our souls the baptism of the Holy Ghost is also called the spirit of Truth by Jesus it's called The Seed of God in 1 Peter 1:23 and a seed can only bring forth of its own kind so if we have the seed of God we'll bring forth the life of Jesus Christ these verses are John 14:17 the world cannot receive the spirit of truth that's why they can be deceived John 152 6 the comforter is the spirit of Truth so if we're the children of Truth we have truth inside of us therefore we cannot be deceived John 16:13 the comforter will guide us into all truth and that's the truth that's available for our hour as 2 Peter 1:12 says we live in the present truth so whatever truth is presently available the wise virgin will receive it just like the Ephesians and acts 18 and 19 they received all of Apollo's truth until Paul came around and then they realized oh there's a baptism of the the Holy Ghost after it was preached to them they believed it Paul laid his hands on them in Acts 19 1-6 and they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God for the present truth and another example is Martin Luther and John Wesley and William Seymour they could only receive the truth that was available for their day and they lived it Faithfully God will reward them and then I love 2 Thessalonians 2:13 it says we're chosen to Salvation through the belief of the truth so because we have the spirit of Truth we believe the truth that proves were chosen for salvation that proves we were predestinated in the mind of God before the foundation of the world 1 Peter 1 122 I love it too the soul is purified through the obeying of the truth so because we obey it purifies our souls makes our souls ready for heaven 1 John 4:6 we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of air so we can see the two spirits in the framework of the church by the grace of God and we can believe the spirit of Truth and again 1 Peter 1:23 we're born again by the in eruptible seed the word of God we have God's Own seed and the Bible says that seed cannot sin so we have a part of God's own life his holy spirit in our souls and that Holy Spirit in our soul that seed never sinned in the first place and it cannot sin the Bible says 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for it seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God that's speaking of the soul the soul that's born again does not sin but we sin in our human Minds when we lose a temporary battle in the battlefield of our minds in this next section it's going to be short but we do get deceived in our human Spirits yes a holy ghost philed believer a wise virgin can be deceived but only temporarily in the human mind or human Spirit we see this in Galatians Chapter 2 Peter was clearly born again he was a spokesman on the day of Pentecost he a spokesman to the Jews Gentiles and also Samaritans in the book of Acts but then he got the spirit of fear and he discriminated from the Gentiles and Paul had to come and correct him and rebuke him to his face but then he accepted the correction another example is how brother Bram lied to the IRS so brother Braham just got so worked up he said he felt like his head was spinning around so much stress with all the IRS meetings and questioning that he told his wife to tell the IRS agents he wasn't there but then of course the Holy Spirit corrected him he repented and made it right and one example that might work for some of us some people sometimes get prideful but 1 John 1:8 says if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in this notice John includes we he includes himself with we if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and of course again that would be a temporary deception in our human Spirits sometimes there are some dishonest message Believers and they take the quote too far that says as if you never did it in the first place and they'll say oh I don't have any sin I don't sin and if they're born again their soul doesn't sin but their human mind certainly does brother Ram says we sin every day and if someone's born again that could only take place in the human spirit in the next section let's look at brother Brams text for the anointed ones at the end time 1965 brother Brams first scriptures are Matthew 24:24 and then Matthew 5:44 and 45 how the rain falls in the just and the unjust and the Holy Ghost anoints false teachers at times then brother Randon goes to Hebrews 6 1-8 about rain falls on thorns and herbs and the Bible examples he uses are Moses and balam brother Ram says they're twins one was the true seed Moses one was the false seed balum then he uses micaa versus zedekiah in First Kings 22 it was so close it seemed but the elect could not be deceived both were prophesying but one was right one was wrong Jeremiah and hananiah are the third example Jeremiah chapter 28 and then David and usza from 1 Chronicles 13 David was anointed but got off by one word it caused the death of usza he was so close usza was so close but he broke the word of God then brother Ram cites 2 Timothy 3 1-9 brother Ram said it was it would be so deceptive in the last days then brother Ram talked about the pope Antichrist who would do lying signs of Wonders Revelation 19:20 and 2 Thessalonians 28-10 and then brother Ram referenced the Egyptians Janice and jambers that could impersonate the first three plagues by the enchantments the rod into the serpent watered of blood and frogs out of water but they could not impersonate plagues 4 through1 including the healing boils and that gets into the truth that Satan cannot heal so hope that was a blessing to review some of brother M's main scriptures and examples from the anointed ones of the end times preached August 25th in the AM 1965 lastly let's look at the closest Ministries that deceive again 2 Timothy 3:13 says this is the greatest age of deception now these are just my opinions but there are some Ministries that are easily detected as being sinful and they wouldn't deceive message Believers such as Kenneth copelan and Benny Hinn they claim to be prophets or claim to hear from God but they've lied so many times with us say the Lord that that wouldn't deceive the elect but I think the closest Ministries that deceive the elect today are the brandham Tabernacle and Joseph brandham Ministry because they can have Supernatural testimonies and healings even perhaps someone raised from the dead a couple years ago but if they break even one word of God such as physically not attending church which they haven't attended church for 5 years then they're off the word of God and of course I have a video series with 24 plus lies coming out of brandom Tabernacle if false Doctrine is not corrected then it only grows like leaven or spreads like a canker Paul says and so the false doctrines of Bram Tabernacle have grown very much now I believe these followers of Bram Tabernacle can be saved but I would imagine they'd have to repent of their idolatry they worship the tapes they worship every word on the tapes and claim that every word is thus say the Lord even when brother Ram said this is not the Lord this is Brother brandom which he said on numerous occasions no doubt there's also five-fold preaching message Ministries that are deceptive when they start calling themselves the greatest of all time which I have a video about that if you'd like to watch that I believe that's getting into the first step of the four-step Antichrist process that's the Deeds of the nickol adans it's a saying and if this advances and it turns into an unbending doctrine that they teach and that would be the second step the doctr the nicians so we got to be very careful I have a video on the Deeds of nicians how to overcome that a sermon on that as well so I'll leave a link to that in the description by the grace of God in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God great question hope the answer was sufficient we're predestinated as Believers in the mind of God and then then God sends the Holy Ghost into our souls as a confirmation we are born again friends keep loving the truth growing in Grace and knowledge of the Lord growing in truth seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and everything else will be added unto you thank God we're the elect we were chosen in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the Good Tidings the good news that Jesus raised from the dead living among men today his church the same Jesus that was yesterday will it be today and forever is never failed
