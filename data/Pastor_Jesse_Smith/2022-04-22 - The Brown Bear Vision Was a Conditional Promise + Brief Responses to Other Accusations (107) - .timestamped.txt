[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matches name of
[0:10] the lord jesus christ the purpose of
[0:13] this video is to defend william branham
[0:15] as a true prophet of god despite his
[0:18] disobedience to the vision god gave him
[0:20] about the brown bear
[0:22] i will show 10 undeniable bible truths
[0:26] about conditional visions
[0:28] conditional prophecies
[0:30] and also conditional prophetic promises
[0:33] to nations and individuals
[0:36] that can fail due to someone's
[0:38] disobedience
[0:40] i'll also show six important
[0:42] observations about the brown bear vision
[0:45] that must be considered before making a
[0:47] judgment about brother branham
[0:50] the truth of this matter is that it is
[0:52] undeniable that some of god's promises
[0:55] and prophecies
[0:56] whether revealed through a vision or
[0:58] through the written word or through
[1:00] hearing god's audible voice
[1:02] or through hearing a preacher in a
[1:04] church service are conditional and
[1:06] require human obedience to come to pass
[1:09] i conclude after much bible study and
[1:12] prayer that william branham's thus saith
[1:14] the lord brown bear vision was
[1:15] conditional
[1:16] while other thus saith the lord visions
[1:18] and prophecies given to him were
[1:20] unconditional
[1:22] please do not prematurely condem brother
[1:24] branham for disobeying a vision
[1:27] before first examining yourself
[1:29] as second corinthians 13 verse 5 says
[1:32] to see if you have recently disobeyed a
[1:35] conditional word from the lord whether
[1:37] delivered to you through a dream a
[1:39] vision through a preacher preaching to
[1:41] you or any other form of delivery
[1:45] the obvious conclusion is that we are
[1:47] all guilty of disobeying conditional
[1:50] words from the lord at some point in our
[1:52] lives
[1:53] and also remember that we all sin every
[1:55] single day which is disobedience to the
[1:58] vision
[1:59] or word of the lord
[2:01] recall jesus's words in john 8 7
[2:04] he that is without sin among you let him
[2:06] first cast a stone
[2:08] here's the outline for this video
[2:11] first we'll briefly review why brother
[2:13] branham was a true prophet
[2:15] next we'll refute the brown bear
[2:17] accusations
[2:19] third i'll give brief responses to other
[2:21] accusations
[2:23] and lastly i'll give questions for
[2:25] brother branham's accusers that they
[2:27] either cannot or will not answer
[2:29] honestly
[2:31] briefly reviewing the proof brother
[2:34] branham was a true prophet
[2:36] friends i believe there's undeniable
[2:38] proof brother branham was a genuine
[2:39] prophet of god
[2:41] i summed up this six-fold evidence on my
[2:44] sixth youtube video
[2:45] called three prophecies of william
[2:47] branham
[2:48] the six-fold evidence is
[2:51] first live a godly life of holiness
[2:54] second teach the word of god in its
[2:56] purity
[2:57] third have converts to christ as fruit
[2:59] of his ministry
[3:01] fourth reveal secrets from the bible
[3:03] that were previously hidden
[3:05] fifth have the anointing of the holy
[3:07] ghost for supernatural signs and
[3:09] prophecies
[3:11] and sixth foretell the future in the
[3:13] name of the lord
[3:15] for time's sake i'm going to speak a
[3:16] little bit on the fourth fifth and six
[3:19] proofs
[3:20] the fourth proof about revealing secrets
[3:22] from the bible previously hidden
[3:25] this requirement is found in amos
[3:26] chapter 3 verse 7.
[3:28] brother branham was used by god to
[3:30] reveal the seven seals which were the
[3:32] voices of the seven thunders
[3:34] and they were not plagiarized from
[3:36] clarence larkin or charles tay's russell
[3:40] which if the lord is willing i'll make a
[3:41] detailed video about that i'm actually
[3:43] studying about that right now
[3:45] brother branham also revealed the twelve
[3:48] bible-defined mysteries
[3:50] such as the rapture the baptism of the
[3:52] holy ghost and more
[3:54] six of these bible-defined mysteries
[3:55] were spoken with thus saith the lord
[3:58] no other preacher even comes close to
[4:00] this
[4:01] and in fact i've never heard a preacher
[4:03] other than brother branham speak a
[4:05] mystery of god with thus saith the lord
[4:07] and if i'm not aware of it please share
[4:08] it with me i never heard billy graham
[4:11] say thus saith the lord
[4:12] nor have i heard any of the following
[4:14] preachers give uh thus saith the lord
[4:16] with a genuine bible mystery revealed
[4:18] such as benny hinn td jakes joel olsteen
[4:22] john macarthur charles swindle
[4:24] rick warren
[4:26] charles or andy stanley john piper
[4:29] or timothy keller
[4:31] brother branham is the only one who
[4:32] meets this fourth requirement to reveal
[4:35] secrets previously hidden
[4:37] the fifth proof is anointing for
[4:39] supernatural works
[4:40] according to first chronicles 16 verse
[4:42] 22 acts 5 verse 12
[4:45] acts 10 verse 38 mark 16 verses 17 and
[4:49] 18
[4:50] and john 16 verse 13.
[4:53] william branham had many supernatural
[4:55] signs and i've met two individuals who
[4:57] experienced this both have passed away
[4:59] already their names were florence humes
[5:02] healed of tuberculosis in 1955 and tom
[5:05] brown who had his thoughts and intents
[5:08] of his heart supernaturally discerned by
[5:10] brother branham in a private meeting in
[5:12] which brother branham gave him the
[5:13] answers to his questions before he even
[5:15] asked his questions
[5:17] by the holy ghost anointing brother
[5:19] branham foretold many healings such as
[5:22] florence humes and marilyn hickey and
[5:25] you can watch your testimony on youtube
[5:27] and there's numerous other people that
[5:28] have had healings foretold by brother
[5:30] branham
[5:31] and these prophecies were on tape and
[5:33] you can listen to them for free on
[5:35] youtube
[5:36] brother branham's ministry produced many
[5:38] amazing healings such as congressman
[5:40] upshaw
[5:41] being healed and coming out of his
[5:43] wheelchair
[5:44] also georgie carter's healing from
[5:46] tuberculosis after being bedridden for
[5:48] eight years just to name a few
[5:51] by the same holy ghost anointing brother
[5:53] branham foretold sister chicarian's
[5:55] death in 1965
[5:57] god's prophets sometimes foretell deaths
[6:00] such as elijah foretelling king
[6:02] ahaziah's death in second kings chapter
[6:05] 1 verses 1 through 18.
[6:08] brother branham had a worldwide healing
[6:09] and discernment ministry noted by
[6:11] historians
[6:12] historians say brother branham's healing
[6:14] ministry was legendary as god used it to
[6:17] initiate the post-world war ii healing
[6:19] revival
[6:20] most notably by the dictionary of
[6:22] pentecostal and charismatic movements
[6:25] and this was written in 1988
[6:27] quote the person universally
[6:30] acknowledged as the revival's father or
[6:32] pacesetter was william branham the
[6:34] sudden appearance of his miraculous
[6:35] healing campaigns in 1946 set off a
[6:38] spiritual explosion in the pentecostal
[6:40] movement which was to move to main
[6:42] street usa by the 1950s and give birth
[6:46] to the broader charismatic movement in
[6:47] the 1960s which currently affects almost
[6:50] every denomination in the country end
[6:53] quote
[6:54] after the angel of the lord met brother
[6:56] branham in may of 1946 healings
[6:59] multiplied through his state then the
[7:01] nation and then the world
[7:03] observed brother branham's ministry
[7:04] began first well before other
[7:06] evangelists because god ordained it oral
[7:09] roberts began his own healing campaigns
[7:11] in 1947 and billy graham rose to
[7:14] national acclaim in 1949
[7:16] after only four years of supernatural
[7:18] ministry over one thousand ministers
[7:21] gathered at a voice of healing
[7:22] convention in 1950 to recognize
[7:25] branham's influence on the healing
[7:27] revival they praised god and paid
[7:29] tribute to brother branham for inspiring
[7:31] them to start praying for the sick
[7:34] as moses was given two signs to prove he
[7:36] was god's deliverer god commissioned
[7:38] brother branham with two signs as well a
[7:40] sign in his hand to identify sicknesses
[7:43] and discernment to know the secrets of
[7:45] hearts
[7:46] quote the power of a branham service
[7:48] remains a legend unparalleled in the
[7:50] history of the charismatic movement end
[7:53] quote
[7:54] the largest stadiums and auditoriums in
[7:56] the world were filled with worshipers
[7:58] and jesus christ mightily healed and
[8:00] saved his people
[8:02] the supernatural holy ghost anointing on
[8:04] brother branham moved him to speak with
[8:06] thus saith the lord over 30 times
[8:09] regarding doctrine and prophecy and this
[8:12] anointing turned our hearts back to the
[8:14] apostolic fathers of the faith according
[8:16] to malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 and
[8:19] this is because brother branham had the
[8:21] spirit of elijah anointing him to
[8:23] fulfill the scriptures
[8:25] this spirit of elijah had at least five
[8:27] characteristics brother branham acted
[8:29] and spoke with thus saith the lord
[8:31] second he condemned religious man-made
[8:34] organizations
[8:35] third he condemned immorality in women
[8:38] and of course also men
[8:41] fourth he was a man of the wilderness
[8:43] and fifth he was human he was fearful
[8:45] and doubted when the anointing left his
[8:47] human spirit just like elijah and john
[8:49] the baptist
[8:51] regarding the sixth proof brother
[8:52] branham foretold the future in the name
[8:54] of the lord a requirement from
[8:56] deuteronomy 18 verse 22 and james 5
[8:59] verse 10.
[9:01] as mentioned earlier brother branham
[9:02] foretold healings in the name of the
[9:04] lord jesus and they came to pass
[9:07] he also foretold three prophecies that
[9:09] are in the process of coming to pass
[9:11] which are the immoral condition of the
[9:13] united states churches
[9:15] second no greater ministry would rise to
[9:17] the gentiles other than his
[9:19] and third denominations would never
[9:21] return to apostolic doctrine and they
[9:24] will also take the mark of the beast
[9:26] brother branham also shared his vision
[9:28] of the seven major visions from 1933
[9:32] three of which i believe are fulfilled
[9:34] and of course i could be wrong on that
[9:36] but i'm certainly open to correction
[9:38] first he foretold mussolini's invasion
[9:40] and death
[9:41] second he foretold hitler's rise in
[9:44] death
[9:44] and also the siegfried line
[9:47] and third he foretold fascism nazism
[9:50] being swallowed up into communism
[9:52] i personally still believe we're waiting
[9:54] for the fourth fifth sixth and seventh
[9:56] visions to come to pass and want to
[9:58] share this quote regarding the
[10:00] sixth vision which many people believe
[10:02] have come to pass but i personally don't
[10:04] believe that
[10:05] in once more lord
[10:07] on november 17th 1963 brother branham
[10:10] talked about the sixth vision and he
[10:12] said it would be a woman that would
[10:14] stand up and would govern the united
[10:16] states and he said not actually a woman
[10:18] but a church
[10:20] so again this proves you have quotes
[10:21] from brother branham on both sides of
[10:23] the issue
[10:24] in some places he makes it sound like
[10:25] it's going to be a literal woman who
[10:27] will be president or vice president but
[10:29] here in this quote he said not actually
[10:31] a woman but a church
[10:33] let's listen to the quote
[10:35] and how that did permit women to vote
[10:38] and in doing so that would let the wrong
[10:40] president
[10:43] and in this would be a woman stand up
[10:46] that would govern in the united states
[10:49] not actually a woman but a church
[10:54] then i've seen her with nothing but
[10:56] ashes
[10:59] it's going to happen
[11:04] there are also numerous future
[11:06] prophecies from brother branham that we
[11:08] are waiting to come to pass relating to
[11:10] the mark of the beast rome the vatican
[11:12] the united states and believers
[11:15] if you'd like to watch a video i made
[11:16] about it it's my 14th video it's called
[11:18] thus saith the lord future prophecies of
[11:21] william branham
[11:22] refuting the brown bear accusations
[11:26] friends i preach this brown bear subject
[11:28] to my home church in 2013
[11:30] and again in 2020
[11:32] and i made a document about it in 2013
[11:36] which i share with other brothers who
[11:37] had asked me questions about the brown
[11:39] bear vision
[11:40] now back in 2012 when the accusers of
[11:43] brother branham went public i wasn't
[11:45] comfortable addressing all the questions
[11:47] because i hadn't studied out these
[11:48] questions
[11:50] my focus at that time was on doctrine
[11:52] which i'm thankful the lord led me to
[11:53] that area
[11:54] because accusers of brother branham
[11:57] normally fail bitterly in sound biblical
[11:59] doctrine
[12:00] for example some of them allow women
[12:02] preachers they believe in women angels
[12:05] they believe there's no modesty standard
[12:07] they reject a life of holiness they
[12:10] enjoy viewing sinful movies they believe
[12:12] in only one work of grace
[12:14] and they believe god is three persons
[12:16] without any scripture saying that
[12:19] i want to show six observations about
[12:21] the brown bear vision
[12:24] observation 1 a vision is simply a word
[12:27] from the lord
[12:28] and every word of god is thus saith the
[12:30] lord
[12:31] to understand the brown bear vision we
[12:33] have to understand the bible's teaching
[12:35] on visions
[12:36] the bible teaches visions are words from
[12:38] the lord
[12:39] genesis 15 1 says the word of the lord
[12:42] came unto abram in a vision
[12:44] first samuel 13 1 says the word of the
[12:46] lord was
[12:47] precious in those days there was no open
[12:50] vision
[12:51] in acts 26 19 saint paul clearly showed
[12:55] that people can either be disobedient or
[12:58] obedient to a heavenly vision he said he
[13:00] was not disobedient to the heavenly
[13:02] vision
[13:04] but both the saved and lost can obey and
[13:06] disobey visions from god
[13:09] the simple truth is a vision is another
[13:11] form of the word of god and there are
[13:13] consequences or rewards to disobeying or
[13:16] obeying the vision or word of god every
[13:20] word of god is thus saith the lord every
[13:22] word of god cannot fail but some of
[13:24] god's words are promises with conditions
[13:27] and others are without conditions as
[13:29] we'll soon see
[13:30] such as in the life of king saul
[13:32] joshua's generation
[13:34] i believe the brown bear vision was
[13:36] based upon conditions
[13:38] brother branham did not meet the
[13:39] conditions so not all of the vision came
[13:41] to pass but lots of it did
[13:44] observation 2 brother branham never said
[13:47] the exact phrase thus saith the lord i
[13:50] will shoot the bear
[13:52] there are only two quotes about the
[13:53] brown bear and brother branham never
[13:56] said the exact phrase of thus saith the
[13:58] lord i'm going to shoot it and hang it
[14:00] on my wall
[14:01] in the first quote brother branham only
[14:03] said thus saith the lord it will be
[14:05] let's listen to the quote
[14:08] many of you remember the vision that i
[14:09] had where i
[14:10] had shot the grizzly bear nine foot
[14:12] grizzly bear and the church remembers me
[14:15] telling it here and a caribou i had
[14:17] another member it's on tape here i've
[14:18] seen a great huge brown there yeah that
[14:21] might be a kodiak and it wouldn't work
[14:23] in canada because they're not there and
[14:25] see but wherever it will be it'll be it
[14:28] will be that's thus saith the lord
[14:33] the truth is the great huge brown bear
[14:35] was
[14:36] part of the vision came to pass
[14:39] god did his part of the vision as
[14:40] brother branham said later
[14:42] the group of brothers saw the brown bear
[14:44] that god had manifested
[14:46] this means brother branham's accusers
[14:48] are making the shooting of the brown
[14:50] bear an unconditional prophecy when in
[14:52] fact it never was
[14:55] because the shooting wasn't directly
[14:56] spoken with thus saith the lord
[14:59] so again brother rahm's accusers are
[15:01] misinterpreting his quotes as usual
[15:04] in brother branham's second quote about
[15:06] the brown bear he did presume he would
[15:08] shoot the bear but he never said thus
[15:11] saith the lord
[15:12] so we cannot make brother branham's
[15:13] statement an unconditional prophecy
[15:17] william branham's thoughts were not all
[15:18] thus saith the lord so we cannot make
[15:20] the second quote of prophecy because
[15:22] there was no thus saith the lord spoken
[15:24] by brother branham brother branham
[15:26] simply believed he was going to shoot
[15:28] the brown bear but shooting it was not
[15:29] thus saith the lord let's listen to the
[15:31] quote
[15:50] that's
[15:52] right this is very important
[15:55] presuming the future or making a human
[15:57] prediction that is wrong
[15:59] does not disqualify one from being a
[16:01] true prophet which is proven by the
[16:03] bible
[16:04] because in john chapter 21 verses 22 and
[16:07] 23
[16:08] there went a saying abroad among the
[16:10] brethren that john should not die until
[16:13] jesus return
[16:15] so jesus's own disciples were making
[16:17] predictions about the future that john
[16:19] wouldn't die before jesus returned
[16:22] and of course those were just human
[16:23] predictions
[16:25] so we can't say jesus disciples were
[16:27] false disciples because they had human
[16:29] predictions that were eventually wrong
[16:31] all of us have human predictions that
[16:33] don't come to pass so we cannot condemn
[16:35] brother branham for having this human
[16:36] prediction
[16:37] brother branham's accusers condemn him
[16:39] because his vision was so detailed
[16:42] with his hands on the hips and so forth
[16:44] and the fact it did not fully come to
[16:46] pass but they fail to recognize bible
[16:48] examples of believers failing detailed
[16:50] promises of god given to them by vision
[16:53] or the written word or the spoken word
[16:55] as you'll soon see
[16:57] such as in the case of joshua's
[16:58] generation failing to drive out all the
[17:01] canaanites and possess the full borders
[17:03] of the promised land which were
[17:05] extremely detailed prophecies
[17:07] and yet the believers fail part of those
[17:09] prophecies
[17:11] observation 3
[17:13] condemning brother branham for failing a
[17:14] vision means you must condemn yourself
[17:17] for your own failures of disobedience
[17:21] if you condemn brother branham as a
[17:22] false prophet for disobeying a vision
[17:24] you had better condemn yourself as a
[17:26] false believer if you've ever disobeyed
[17:28] god's word lied stolen lusted failed to
[17:32] witness to someone the lord placed on
[17:33] your heart
[17:34] failed to give to the poor and needy
[17:36] when prompted by the holy ghost because
[17:39] all your actions have consequences on
[17:41] the future
[17:42] and you missed out on future rewards
[17:44] now friends i know that i fall into that
[17:46] category and so do you as well we've all
[17:49] failed leadings of the holy spirit that
[17:51] if we had obeyed we would have gained
[17:53] the rewards for
[17:54] so please don't condemn yourself i'm not
[17:56] going to condemn myself
[17:58] i'm going to simply follow the bible
[17:59] commands of repenting
[18:01] and then moving forward with christ
[18:03] jesus our lord just as brother branham
[18:05] did
[18:07] observation 4 god forgave brother
[18:09] branham of disobeying the brown bear
[18:11] vision and stayed with his ministry
[18:13] guiding him into all truth such as the
[18:15] seven seals marriage and divorce
[18:17] anointed ones at the end times and many
[18:19] more
[18:21] brother branham repented of disobeying
[18:23] the brown bear vision so god forgave him
[18:25] according to his divine promise in 1st
[18:27] john 1 verse 9 which says if we confess
[18:30] our sins he is faithful and just to
[18:32] forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us
[18:34] from all unrighteousness
[18:36] we should rejoice when god forgives
[18:38] others for we want to be forgiven too
[18:41] we rejoice god forgave abraham and isaac
[18:44] for their lies he forgave david of his
[18:46] murder and adultery he forgave moses of
[18:49] his murder and prideful exaltation of
[18:51] himself and all the other forgiveness
[18:53] examples brother brahms accusers have
[18:55] misapplied deuteronomy 18 verses 21-22
[18:59] saying not to hear brother branham
[19:01] because he failed the brown bear vision
[19:03] but they're wrong for the following
[19:04] reasons
[19:05] first god stayed with brother branham
[19:07] giving him numerous thus saith the
[19:09] lord's statements after the brown bear
[19:10] vision honoring his prayers for the sick
[19:12] as well
[19:13] second brother branham's vision was
[19:15] conditional not unconditional
[19:17] just like isaiah's thus saith the lord
[19:20] that hezekiah would die yet another thus
[19:22] saith the lord came and said he'd be
[19:24] healed
[19:25] notice isaiah's first thus saith the
[19:27] lord did not come to pass
[19:29] also jonah's pronounced judgment upon
[19:31] nineveh did not come to pass due to
[19:33] their repentance
[19:35] regarding hezekiah's healing notice it
[19:37] was thus saith the lord you shall die
[19:40] but thus saith the lord was changed
[19:41] because of the permissive will of god
[19:43] like with balaam
[19:45] we know god does not change his mind but
[19:47] he does allow mankind to receive his
[19:49] permissive will based upon their own
[19:51] freemore agency
[19:53] and notice that thus saith the lord you
[19:55] shall die
[19:56] was not given to a nation as brother
[19:58] rams accusers like to point out it was
[20:00] given to an individual
[20:02] so that means thus saith the lord
[20:04] prophecies can be given to individuals
[20:06] and also be conditional
[20:08] brother branham's accusers seem to say
[20:10] only prophecies given to nations can be
[20:12] conditional which is wrong
[20:15] notice about jonah's warning against
[20:16] nineveh he never said it was conditional
[20:19] but the people of nineveh understood it
[20:21] was conditional
[20:22] so we have to apply that same principle
[20:24] to brother brahms ministry
[20:26] some of the prophecies brother branham
[20:27] made whether by vision or thus saith the
[20:29] lord could have been conditional even if
[20:31] they didn't sound like it or even if
[20:33] brother adam didn't say they were
[20:34] conditional
[20:36] so we have to treat all prophets the
[20:37] same
[20:38] they all have to be tested by the word
[20:40] of the lord as the bible says prove all
[20:42] things try every spirit
[20:46] observation five
[20:48] brother branham failed one vision the
[20:50] brown bear vision but obeyed many
[20:52] visions for the glory of god
[20:55] consider the many visions that brother
[20:56] branham obeyed
[20:57] and that came to pass such as the
[21:00] commission of the angel and his two
[21:01] signs like moses
[21:03] also the vision of georgie carter's
[21:05] healing from tuberculosis
[21:07] brother brown's vision of the miraculous
[21:09] healing of congressman upshaw came to
[21:10] pass
[21:11] brother branham's vision of florence
[21:13] humes healing from tuberculosis came to
[21:15] pass where he saw her weighing herself
[21:17] two mondays in a row
[21:19] brother graham's vision of florence
[21:20] chicarian's death came to pass despite
[21:23] numerous preachers prophesying of her
[21:24] healing
[21:26] and also the visions that the
[21:27] denominations would never break up and
[21:29] come back to the apostolic truth
[21:31] and the vision that no gift would ever
[21:32] rise to the gentiles greater than his
[21:35] and the vision of the immoral condition
[21:36] of the united states church
[21:38] all these visions have come to pass or
[21:40] are in the process of coming to pass
[21:44] observation 6
[21:45] god can interpret his word any way he
[21:47] wants
[21:49] an important example is elijah being
[21:51] told by god to anoint three people but
[21:53] he only anointed one
[21:55] does this mean even god's own prophecies
[21:58] can fail
[21:59] of course not
[22:00] but brother branham's accusers would
[22:02] like you to ignore the scripture first
[22:04] kings 19 15-17
[22:07] because it shows the truth that god can
[22:09] interpret the visions he gave to brother
[22:11] branham in any way he wants
[22:14] god gave elijah this command in first
[22:16] kings 19 verses 15 through 17.
[22:20] first the lord said elijah would anoint
[22:22] elisha
[22:24] and then he said anoint hazel to be king
[22:26] over syria in verse 15. and then in
[22:28] verse 16 he said anoint jehu to be king
[22:30] over israel
[22:32] if you read the bible the only one
[22:34] elijah did anoint was elisha according
[22:37] to second kings 2 9-15 when the double
[22:40] portion fell on elisha
[22:42] it seems elisha anointed haziel king
[22:45] over syria in second kings 8 verses
[22:48] 13-15
[22:50] and it seems a son of a prophet anointed
[22:52] jehu king over israel in second kings 9
[22:55] 1-13
[22:57] elijah only anointed elisha the other
[22:59] two things he did not physically fulfill
[23:02] that's because elijah left the scene
[23:04] because we know god's word can't fail
[23:07] this proves god can interpret his word
[23:08] any way he wants
[23:10] now this relates to the brown bear
[23:12] vision because god's vision given to
[23:13] brother branham of the brown bear could
[23:15] be interpreted as conditional
[23:18] again this would be an example like
[23:20] isaiah's conditional thus saith the lord
[23:21] to hezekiah who was an individual and
[23:24] not a nation
[23:25] and also jonas thus saith the lord
[23:27] warning of destruction to nineveh which
[23:29] turned out to be conditional
[23:32] ten bible truths about visions and
[23:34] conditional promises
[23:37] example one
[23:38] abraham
[23:40] his life shows a prophet can disobey a
[23:42] prophetic vision but still be a prophet
[23:45] and this closely relates to brother
[23:46] branham because brother brahm disobeyed
[23:48] a vision as well just as abraham did
[23:51] abraham was called a prophet in genesis
[23:53] 20 verse 7
[23:54] but he disobeyed two aspects of his
[23:56] heavenly vision about dwelling in canaan
[23:58] in genesis 12 verses 1 through 4.
[24:02] first abraham allowed lot to go with him
[24:04] out of shinar after being told
[24:06] specifically to separate from his
[24:07] kindred
[24:08] and god did not visit abraham until
[24:10] after he obeyed and separated from lot
[24:13] as genesis chapters 13 and on prove
[24:17] god was patient until abraham fully
[24:19] obeyed the original vision or word from
[24:21] the lord
[24:22] second abraham left canaan during the
[24:24] famine according to genesis 12 verses 10
[24:27] through 20. this disobedience led to
[24:29] abraham's first lie that sarah wasn't
[24:32] his wife and also the plaguing of
[24:34] pharaoh's house
[24:36] so we learn from abraham's example that
[24:38] genuine prophets who are saved and go to
[24:40] heaven can disobey heavenly visions
[24:43] and they will suffer the consequences
[24:45] but they will remain god's prophet
[24:48] balaam is a simple example of how a
[24:50] genuine prophet but of course we call
[24:52] him a false prophet because of his false
[24:54] teachings and the fact he went to hell
[24:56] in second peter 2 verses 15-17
[25:00] can disobey a heavenly vision as balaam
[25:02] refused god's first word of the lord or
[25:05] first heavenly vision about not going
[25:07] with balak but then god allowed him to
[25:09] go
[25:09] this is recorded numbers 22 verses 12
[25:12] through 21.
[25:14] back to abraham god still blessed
[25:16] abraham later in his life despite his
[25:18] disobedience to the two details of his
[25:21] vision of living in canaan
[25:23] away from his kindred
[25:25] because abraham was a prophet god bless
[25:28] brother branham despite his disobedience
[25:30] to the brown bear vision
[25:32] as he told in september 1962
[25:35] because god still revealed the seven
[25:36] seals to him marriage and divorce and
[25:39] numerous other subjects to brother
[25:40] branham and also healed his wife's tumor
[25:43] by the spoken word in late 1963 and also
[25:46] healed him of a stomach issue
[25:48] in late 1965.
[25:51] if disobeying a prophetic vision
[25:53] disqualifies brother brennam then you
[25:55] have to disqualify abraham for twice
[25:57] disobeying his vision from the lord in
[25:59] genesis chapter 12.
[26:02] example two
[26:03] the believers in joshua's generation
[26:06] this example shows regular believers can
[26:09] disobey two prophetic visions yet still
[26:12] be saved and forgiven hence the
[26:14] description of israel served the lord
[26:15] all the days of joshua from joshua 24 31
[26:20] this vision shows brother random can be
[26:22] forgiven of failing conditional promises
[26:27] moses and joshua were given prophecies
[26:29] from god that israel could drive out all
[26:31] the inhabitants
[26:33] numbers 33 verses 51-53
[26:37] and possessed the entire promised land
[26:39] including the coasts one of which
[26:41] included the river euphrates according
[26:43] to joshua 1 verses 1-9
[26:46] but because some tribes disobeyed the
[26:49] voice of god some nations were not
[26:51] driven out of the land
[26:52] read the entire chapter of judges too
[26:55] and not all the borders were possessed
[26:58] this does not mean joshua and moses were
[27:00] false prophets
[27:02] it means the people did not fully obey
[27:04] the visions and words from the lord
[27:07] joshua 24 31 proves
[27:10] that although the tribes did not drive
[27:12] out all the inhabitants they were still
[27:14] saved
[27:15] because it makes it seem joshua's
[27:17] generation was faithful
[27:19] saying and israel served the lord all
[27:21] the days of joshua and all the days of
[27:23] the elders that overlived joshua and
[27:25] which had known all the works of the
[27:27] lord that he had done for israel
[27:31] note also that joshua fulfilled his part
[27:33] but other tribes failed thus saith the
[27:36] lord vision of taking all the borders
[27:38] joshua 1 verse 4 showed the potential
[27:41] borders if israel obeyed this was a
[27:43] conditional promise given to joshua by
[27:45] vision or god speaking to joshua
[27:48] according to joshua 1 verse 1.
[27:50] these borders were not fulfilled until
[27:52] david's time in second samuel 3 verse 8
[27:55] nearly 400 years later
[27:58] schofield's bible says 398 years
[28:01] joshua filled all god's will and land
[28:04] for he and his house according to joshua
[28:06] 11 verse 23 but numerous tribes did not
[28:09] obey all the vision
[28:11] such as ephraim not driving out the
[28:13] canaanites in joshua 16 verse 10
[28:16] manasseh not driving out the canaanites
[28:18] in joshua 17 verses 12 through 13. the
[28:21] benjamites did not drive out the
[28:23] jebusites according to judges 2 verses
[28:25] 21 through 26
[28:27] and zebulun asher and naphtali and dan
[28:30] did not drive out the canaanites in
[28:32] judges 2 verses 21 through 36.
[28:36] friends notice the men of ephraim dan
[28:38] asher etc could have all said we have
[28:41] thus saith the lord from visions from
[28:44] god given both to moses and joshua that
[28:47] we can possess all the borders of our
[28:49] land and we can drive out all the
[28:51] inhabitants they could have said we're
[28:53] going to drive them out according to the
[28:55] visions that were thus saith the lord
[28:58] part of those statements would have been
[28:59] true but it was based upon the condition
[29:02] of obedience
[29:04] as it turned out those tribes would have
[29:05] failed
[29:06] portions of the visions god gave to
[29:08] moses and joshua but that did not mean
[29:11] they were lost
[29:12] they simply failed the vision of the
[29:14] lord and would need to repent that's
[29:16] exactly what brother branham did when he
[29:18] repented of failing the brown bear
[29:20] vision here's the quote
[29:22] and i find out
[29:24] if god has spoken anything
[29:27] then we
[29:28] must
[29:29] go with that word
[29:31] in order to make it be fulfilled
[29:34] we've seen that as i told you last night
[29:36] i have a vision just recently
[29:38] that if i had to be there in the morning
[29:41] to be there and telling me six months
[29:43] before to be on that spot
[29:46] and stand there and say go down there
[29:47] three times with them and i just walked
[29:50] on the other man and the vision passed
[29:52] right through exactly god's part i was
[29:54] there standing
[29:56] so we want to remember you've got to
[29:58] stand on the word stay right with the
[29:59] word where the word leads you go right
[30:01] with the word and you'll bring out all
[30:03] right i'm sure
[30:08] my hands lord's up what will i do
[30:11] now father i've got many things that i
[30:14] do wrong i've just confessed my sin this
[30:16] morning before the church as i confessed
[30:19] to you on top of the mountain the other
[30:20] morning when it was blowing and snowing
[30:22] and up there on top of the mountain i
[30:25] cried out and asked you to forgive me
[30:27] for my stupidity and how i dreaded to
[30:31] come before my brethren who some of them
[30:33] regard me as your prophet servant and
[30:35] lord how i hated to come to for them and
[30:37] tell them of a stupid act that i would
[30:40] do a thing like that but god is good for
[30:42] my soul that i confess my sins and not
[30:45] hide them
[30:46] so to be honest with you and right
[30:48] before the people i have confessed it
[30:50] lord i'm wrong i'm all together wrong i
[30:54] pray forgiveness
[30:58] example three king saul
[31:01] his life shows a minor prophet can
[31:03] disobey written prophetic promises and
[31:06] miss out on future rewards yet still be
[31:08] saved
[31:10] saul's example most closely relates to
[31:12] brother branham regarding missing out on
[31:14] the blessing of shooting the brown bear
[31:18] it seems saul was a minor prophet
[31:19] according to first samuel 10 verses 11
[31:22] and 12. but saul disobeyed the written
[31:24] prophecy of deuteronomy 17 verses 14
[31:27] through 20 which said israel's king
[31:30] would prolong his kingdom for he and his
[31:32] children
[31:33] the prophet samuel interpreted this
[31:34] prophecy in first samuel 13 verse 13
[31:38] after saul disobeyed the lord and was
[31:40] rejected from being king saying
[31:43] and samuel said to saul thou has done
[31:45] foolishly thou has not kept the
[31:47] commandment of the lord thy god which he
[31:49] commanded thee for now would the lord
[31:51] have established thy kingdom upon israel
[31:53] forever
[31:55] this verse proves king saul lost the
[31:57] reward of the kingdom forever if he
[31:59] would have obeyed so he missed out on
[32:01] the blessing of the vision because of
[32:03] his disobedience
[32:05] brother rana missed out on the blessings
[32:07] of his prophetic vision because of his
[32:09] disobedience
[32:10] but again god never left brother branham
[32:12] and he remained a genuine prophet of god
[32:15] this principle is also true in the new
[32:17] testament as first corinthians 13 verses
[32:20] 14 and 15 prove
[32:22] as they say some rewards can be lost due
[32:24] to disobedience
[32:25] now i believe this is speaking of the
[32:27] foolish virgin
[32:28] but it says if any man's work abide
[32:30] which he hath built thereupon he shall
[32:32] receive a reward if any man's work
[32:34] should be burned he shall suffer loss
[32:36] but he himself shall be saved yet so as
[32:39] by fire
[32:41] and of course we know saul was saved
[32:43] because the prophet samuel was called up
[32:45] and told him that saul would be with
[32:47] samuel the next day after his death and
[32:50] of course samuel was in abraham's bosom
[32:52] where the saved went because there was a
[32:54] great chasm between the saved and the
[32:56] lost in the heart of the earth
[32:59] example 4
[33:01] prophets can doubt visions and disobey
[33:03] visions
[33:04] this helps us understand how brother
[33:06] branham did not think some visions were
[33:08] fulfilled the experiences of john the
[33:11] baptist and peter
[33:13] both who were prophets
[33:14] prove prophets can doubt visions and
[33:16] disobey visions and yet still be genuine
[33:19] prophets
[33:20] john the baptist saw the spirit of god
[33:22] descend and remain on jesus in a vision
[33:25] according to john 1 verses 32 through 36
[33:28] but later in prison doubted his vision
[33:30] according to matthew 11 verses 2 and 3.
[33:33] this will help us later to see how
[33:35] brother branham could doubt if his
[33:36] visions were fulfilled like the tent
[33:38] vision and the vision of the three
[33:40] hundred thousand in a foreign meeting
[33:42] which i believe were both fulfilled
[33:45] more on that later
[33:47] moving on to peter in acts chapter 10
[33:49] verses 9 through 17 peter didn't
[33:52] understand his vision
[33:54] even doubting it like john the baptist
[33:56] and peter even denied the voice
[33:59] it seems peter for a short time was
[34:01] disobedient to the heavenly vision
[34:03] which said rise
[34:05] kill and eat
[34:06] acts 10 17 says while peter doubted in
[34:09] himself what this vision which he had
[34:11] seen should mean
[34:13] now of course god later interpreted this
[34:15] vision for him by taking him to the
[34:17] gentile house of cornelius and god was
[34:19] proving he had now accepted the gentiles
[34:22] and god also helped him understand this
[34:24] vision in galatians 2 where peter had
[34:27] separated himself from eating with the
[34:28] gentiles and paul corrected peter
[34:31] because of his segregation from gentile
[34:33] believers because paul told us the food
[34:35] of god and the creatures of god were
[34:37] made to be received with thanksgiving
[34:40] example five
[34:42] david
[34:43] as a minor prophet david suffered
[34:45] because he disobeyed prophetic written
[34:48] promises
[34:49] so this proves prophets can disobey thus
[34:51] saith the lord the word of god yet still
[34:53] be prophets
[34:56] king david was a minor prophet according
[34:58] to acts 2 verses 29-30 because nathan
[35:02] was the major prophet of his day
[35:04] but david was disobedient to the command
[35:06] about kings not marrying many wives and
[35:09] suffered because of it
[35:11] david's sin with bathsheba also had many
[35:13] evil consequences
[35:15] deuteronomy 17 verse 17 said neither
[35:18] shall he multiply wise to himself that
[35:20] his heart not turn away neither shall he
[35:23] greatly multiply to himself silver and
[35:25] gold
[35:26] again david being a minor prophet he
[35:29] even numbered the people disobeying
[35:31] scripture regarding that
[35:33] first god never told david to number the
[35:35] people and second david seemed to have a
[35:37] selfish motive in numbering the people
[35:39] for prideful reasons
[35:41] second samuel 24 verse 10 says david's
[35:44] heart smote him after he had numbered
[35:46] the people and david said unto the lord
[35:48] i have sinned greatly and that i have
[35:49] done and now i beseech the o lord take
[35:52] away the iniquity of thy servant for i
[35:54] have done very foolishly
[35:55] both major and minor prophets can
[35:57] disobey visions or words of the lord
[36:00] they can do foolishly but god is
[36:02] faithful and just and merciful to
[36:04] forgive all their trespasses
[36:07] example 6 solomon
[36:10] solomon suffered because he disobeyed
[36:12] the vision of the lord this closely
[36:14] relates to brother branham because both
[36:16] men saw visions and purposely disobeyed
[36:18] them
[36:20] solomon was purposely disobedient to the
[36:22] command about kings not marrying many
[36:25] wives and suffered because of it just
[36:27] like david was disobedient to that
[36:29] written command
[36:30] but also solomon purposely disobeyed a
[36:33] vision of the lord that he had in 1st
[36:36] kings 9 verses 1 through 9 when the lord
[36:39] appeared to solomon the second time and
[36:41] warned him if he should turn from
[36:44] following god him or his children and
[36:46] would not keep god's commandments and
[36:48] his statutes and go and serve other gods
[36:50] and worship them god would cut off
[36:52] israel out of the land
[36:54] solomon was purposely disobedient to a
[36:57] thus saith the lord vision of god
[36:59] because of his disobedience god stirred
[37:01] up two adversaries against solomon at
[37:03] the end of his life according to first
[37:04] kings 11
[37:06] 14 and verse 23.
[37:09] example seven
[37:11] as previously mentioned isaiah's
[37:13] prophecy of hezekiah's death shows how
[37:15] thus saith the lord's statements can be
[37:17] conditional to individuals
[37:20] this is very important because brother
[37:21] man's accusers say conditional promises
[37:24] are for nations only but again we see
[37:26] that the scripture and god's prophets
[37:28] are correct
[37:30] example eight shows the prophetic
[37:32] promise of salvation is conditional
[37:36] friends three verses proclaim the future
[37:38] promise of salvation to all or whosoever
[37:41] calls upon the lord but it is
[37:43] conditional
[37:45] joel 2 32 says whosoever shall call upon
[37:48] the name of the lord shall be delivered
[37:50] acts 2 21 repeats this saying whosoever
[37:53] shall call upon the name of lord shall
[37:55] be saved romans 10 13 says for whosoever
[37:58] shall call upon the name of the lord
[37:59] shall be saved
[38:01] friends these are true promises but
[38:03] they're conditional and they must be
[38:04] balanced
[38:05] millions if not billions of church goers
[38:08] have and are confessing that they shall
[38:10] be saved
[38:11] they are essentially saying it's thus
[38:13] saith the lord i'm going to be saved
[38:14] because i've called
[38:16] but this promise is conditional as
[38:17] matthew 7 verse 21 through 24 says
[38:21] and exodus 32 verse 33 and revelation 3
[38:25] verse 5 say
[38:27] because these verses prove only those
[38:28] who call upon the name of the lord and
[38:31] do the will of god are saved
[38:33] matthew 7 21 says not everyone that
[38:36] saith unto me lord lord shall enter in
[38:37] the kingdom of god but he that doeth the
[38:39] will of my father which is in heaven
[38:43] exodus 32 33 says
[38:45] the lord said unto moses whosoever has
[38:47] sinned against me him will i blot out
[38:49] out of my book
[38:51] revelation 3 verse 5 jesus said he that
[38:53] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[38:55] white raiment and i will not blot out
[38:57] his name out of the book of life
[39:01] any honest person who reads the
[39:02] scripture will realize the promise of
[39:04] salvation is conditional
[39:06] and those who disobey the conditions of
[39:08] this promise will miss out on the future
[39:10] blessing of eternal life
[39:13] example 9 the prophetic promise of being
[39:16] filled with the baptism of the holy
[39:18] ghost is conditional
[39:19] and those who disobey this prophecy will
[39:22] miss out on the future blessing of being
[39:23] clothed or endued with power from on
[39:26] high and also miss out on ruling and
[39:28] reigning with christ during the
[39:29] millennium
[39:32] acts 2 38 seems to say all those who are
[39:34] baptized
[39:36] in the name of jesus christ shall be
[39:37] filled with the holy ghost but of course
[39:39] this promise is conditional peter said
[39:43] repent and be baptized every one of you
[39:45] in the name of jesus christ for the
[39:46] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[39:48] the gift of the holy ghost
[39:51] anyone who's been around the lord jesus
[39:52] christ baptism has seen many people be
[39:55] baptized but then fall away into sinful
[39:57] disobedience
[39:58] never manifesting the baptism of the
[40:00] holy ghost in their daily lives
[40:03] yet the baptized one could honestly and
[40:05] truly say it's thus saith the lord from
[40:07] the word of god acts 2 38 that i'll
[40:09] receive the baptism of the holy ghost i
[40:12] shall it will be
[40:14] but again the reception of this promise
[40:15] is conditional based upon genuine
[40:17] repentance
[40:19] acts 8 shows the reality of this using
[40:21] the example of simon the sorcerer he was
[40:24] baptized believing in the lord jesus in
[40:26] acts 8 verse 13
[40:28] but later he tries to buy the gift to
[40:30] pray for others to receive the holy
[40:32] ghost
[40:33] and peter says in verses 20 through 23
[40:36] his money would perish with him his
[40:38] heart was not right in the sight of god
[40:41] he needed to repent of this his
[40:42] wickedness and pray to god if perhaps
[40:45] the thought of his heart would be
[40:46] forgiven him
[40:47] peter perceived he was in the gall of
[40:49] bitterness in the bond of iniquity
[40:52] now this scripture disproves brother
[40:54] branham's accusers who believe in one
[40:56] work of grace they believe a person is
[40:58] filled with the holy ghost as soon as
[40:59] they repent and say the sinner's prayer
[41:02] which is a false teaching
[41:04] simon the sorcerer had repented and been
[41:06] baptized but look at the condition of
[41:08] his heart his heart is still in
[41:10] wickedness it's in bitterness it's still
[41:12] in iniquity he was still going to perish
[41:15] yet he was already baptized in water
[41:17] yet his heart was not right in the sight
[41:19] of god
[41:20] yet simon the sorcerer could have said
[41:22] according to the thus saith the lord
[41:24] future promise
[41:25] of acts 2 38 and my obedience to it it's
[41:28] thus saith lord i'm going to receive the
[41:30] baptism of the holy ghost
[41:32] so it's clear to any honest christian
[41:34] that the promise of receiving the third
[41:36] work of grace the baptism of the holy
[41:37] ghost is a conditional promise
[41:40] acts 5 32 said god gives the holy ghost
[41:42] to them that obey him
[41:44] obviously simon the sorcerer had not
[41:46] obeyed god enough to receive the baptism
[41:48] of the holy ghost
[41:50] example 10 the prophetic promise of
[41:53] divine healing is conditional and those
[41:55] who disobey miss out on the future
[41:57] blessings of health and healing
[42:00] psalm 103 verse 2 and isaiah 53 verse 4
[42:04] seem to say god heals all diseases as
[42:06] also proven by matthew 8 16
[42:09] which says jesus healed all manner of
[42:11] sickness and all manner of disease
[42:13] jesus disciples were given all power to
[42:16] heal all diseases as well according to
[42:18] matthew 10 verse 1
[42:21] so a sick person could potentially say
[42:23] it's thus saith the lord according to
[42:25] the vision or word of god that god will
[42:27] heal all my diseases but we learn from
[42:30] scripture that god's divine promise of
[42:32] divine healing can be missed due to
[42:35] disobedience because the bible said
[42:37] jesus could not do many mighty miracles
[42:39] because of people's unbelief or
[42:40] disobedience so we learn divine healing
[42:43] is based upon faith and obedience and
[42:46] the conditions must be met according to
[42:48] matthew 13 verses 57 and 58 matthew 17
[42:52] verses 19 through 21 mark 6 verses 5 and
[42:55] 6
[42:56] and luke 4 verses 18 and 19.
[42:59] at other times friends god does not heal
[43:01] us to keep us humble as in paul's case
[43:04] in second corinthians 12 7 as paul was
[43:06] even given a buffeting messenger from
[43:08] satan
[43:10] and then there's other times god might
[43:11] not heal us to take us home to heaven
[43:14] there are many many more examples of
[43:16] conditional bible promises such as james
[43:19] 1 verses 5 and 6
[43:21] regarding the promise for abundant
[43:23] wisdom if a person asks without wavering
[43:27] that's a conditional promise
[43:29] also isaiah 26 verse 3 promises a
[43:32] peaceful mind if a person keeps their
[43:34] mind on god
[43:36] but again that's a conditional promise
[43:40] brief responses to other accusations
[43:43] lord willing i may make individual
[43:45] videos about the following accusations
[43:47] but i'd like to give a few short words
[43:50] here about them
[43:51] because this will help preachers or
[43:53] people who contact me with questions
[43:54] right now
[43:56] the vision of three hundred thousand in
[43:58] a meeting
[43:59] it's my humble opinion that brother
[44:01] branham seemed to misunderstand the
[44:03] vision thinking it was unfulfilled up
[44:05] until the time he died but i believe
[44:07] it's most likely the vision was
[44:08] fulfilled
[44:10] in his 1954 trip to bombay india in
[44:13] which he was told by the mayor of bombay
[44:15] that nearly 500 000 attend the meetings
[44:18] let's listen to the quote
[44:21] [Applause]
[44:28] is
[44:31] [Applause]
[44:33] [Music]
[44:33] [Applause]
[44:40] [Applause]
[44:46] this number of half a million could have
[44:47] been exaggerated
[44:49] and so it seems the 500 000 meeting
[44:51] could have been the 300 000 meeting
[44:54] remember it's possible for a prophet to
[44:56] doubt whether his vision or prophecy had
[44:59] come to pass as the example with john
[45:01] the baptist showed
[45:02] and also peter's doubt about his sheep
[45:05] vision in acts chapter 10 verse 17.
[45:09] it's clear brother branham wasn't sure
[45:10] where the meeting would be
[45:12] he said in india or somewhere east of
[45:14] africa somewhere where indians are at
[45:17] somewhere in that eastern country let's
[45:19] listen to the quote
[45:21] market in your bibles
[45:23] that you hear of this
[45:26] that i was in india or somewhere east of
[45:29] africa
[45:30] tanzania somewhere where indians are at
[45:33] somewhere in that eastern country which
[45:34] i believe will be india itself or there
[45:37] will be
[45:38] 300 000 people
[45:41] either they will be attending the
[45:42] meeting or if they'll be the archbishop
[45:45] told me that brother bam
[45:47] that that's 300 000 conversions
[45:53] another thing to keep in mind is that
[45:55] someone else could have fulfilled
[45:56] brother brandon's vision of the 300 000
[45:59] in one meeting this is scriptural
[46:01] because god gave elijah instructions to
[46:03] anoint three people but he only anointed
[46:06] one of them and other people fulfilled
[46:08] the rest of the vision
[46:10] this is also seen in revelation 10 verse
[46:12] 11 because john is told to prophesy
[46:15] again of the open book to every people
[46:17] nation tongue and tribe but he did not
[46:18] fulfill that command it's the gentile
[46:21] church who fulfills that command which
[46:23] is the fulfillment of the great
[46:24] commission
[46:26] second the tent vision brother ram never
[46:28] thought this vision was fulfilled but we
[46:30] can't forget the interpretation of the
[46:32] angel who was always scriptural and said
[46:35] god would meet brother branham in the
[46:36] prayer closet
[46:38] so i believe this vision was fulfilled
[46:40] during the week brother branham preached
[46:42] the revelation of the seven seals
[46:44] because brother ram shut himself in for
[46:46] prayer and study and god surely met him
[46:49] let's listen to the quote where brother
[46:51] branham said the angel the lord
[46:52] interpreted the tent vision for him
[46:56] me the same voice the angel's voice
[46:59] he said i'll meet you in there
[47:02] and this is the third pull
[47:06] but nobody will know nothing about it
[47:09] and i said
[47:11] well i don't understand why i end there
[47:15] why that he said it will not be a public
[47:18] show
[47:20] this time
[47:22] and i said i don't understand going into
[47:25] that closet like that and he said is not
[47:28] it written by our lord
[47:30] when thou prayers do not like the
[47:33] hypocrites who like to be heard before
[47:35] man but enter into the secret closet and
[47:39] pray to the father who seeth in secret
[47:42] and he who sees in secret shall reward
[47:44] thee openly
[47:46] it's perfectly to the scripture every
[47:48] time it is
[47:50] and
[47:51] i said i understand
[47:55] here's the quote where brother branham
[47:56] said it was a tremendous week for him
[47:57] preaching the seven seals
[47:59] because he would be in the room
[48:01] constantly studying and praying
[48:04] this has been a tremendous week for me
[48:07] i'm tired my mind is tired
[48:10] because i i was the best that i could do
[48:13] and something strange going on every day
[48:16] i would be amazed to walk in the room
[48:18] and be there for a few minutes
[48:20] and see something is turning completely
[48:22] around
[48:23] and here i go in there i pick up the
[48:25] notes i pick up books of dr smith you're
[48:28] a smith and all
[48:30] the writers and read and read down in
[48:33] their books i said now here's the sixth
[48:34] seal here's the fourth seal now what
[48:37] does this man say he'd say what was this
[48:38] there that i look over here and get
[48:40] another man he said it was such and such
[48:43] and it looked like it just
[48:44] it just didn't work right and i thought
[48:46] well what is it lord i walk up down the
[48:49] floor along i kneel down pray go back
[48:51] pick up the bible sit down read walk
[48:53] back and forth then all of a sudden when
[48:55] i got quiet you're just unfolding like
[48:58] that then i grab a pen right quick go
[49:00] right down
[49:04] then i'd take the rest of the day go
[49:06] down and chase this out and see if it
[49:09] tied all the way down through the
[49:10] scriptures then it proved all things
[49:13] right
[49:14] i got this shirt i think now there's
[49:15] many people had visions there's many
[49:17] been revelations if it's contrary to the
[49:19] word leave it alone
[49:20] that's right leave it alone
[49:24] and remember friends it's biblical that
[49:26] prophets do not always understand their
[49:27] visions like john the baptist doubted
[49:30] his vision of jesus while he was in
[49:32] prison
[49:33] notice also the angel said the third
[49:35] poll wouldn't be a public show like the
[49:37] first two meaning his plans to re attend
[49:40] and hold meetings
[49:41] were likely a misinterpretation from the
[49:43] start
[49:44] because public services were used to
[49:46] show his first two polls
[49:48] the gift in his hand and also second the
[49:50] discernment of spirit
[49:52] another powerful point is that the tent
[49:54] vision
[49:55] showed an altar call and hundreds of
[49:57] people
[49:59] weeping sitting by the altar receiving
[50:00] the lord jesus let's listen to the quote
[50:04] keep your line straight
[50:07] and these kind of times i said yes
[50:09] so i got the line ready to throw again
[50:12] and just as it did at that time he taken
[50:13] me away again
[50:15] and he stood me up in the air over a
[50:17] great auditorium or a big tent oh i've
[50:20] never seen such a tent spread way out
[50:23] and in that there was a look like
[50:25] admittedly calling hundreds of people
[50:27] real soft and sweet they were weeping
[50:29] standing with the altar receiving the
[50:31] lord jesus
[50:32] and i said that looks better
[50:37] now what's amazing is that the week that
[50:38] brother adam preached the revelation of
[50:40] the seven seals he said there was over a
[50:42] hundred baptisms
[50:44] so it seems the tent vision prophecy of
[50:45] hundreds being saved was fulfilled
[50:48] during the week of the seven seals let's
[50:50] listen to the quote from the seventh
[50:51] seal
[50:53] and now
[50:54] i
[50:55] was asking billy he was so long about
[50:57] coming and getting me he said there had
[50:59] been a another group baptized which runs
[51:01] over a hundred this week
[51:04] of uh people being baptized in the name
[51:07] of our lord jesus christ amen so we are
[51:10] are thankful and god bless you
[51:16] the seven major visions
[51:19] here's a few points about the seven
[51:20] major visions it's my opinion brother
[51:23] branham said different things about
[51:24] these prophecies because he was trying
[51:26] his best to remember all the details of
[51:28] the 1933 prophecy
[51:31] he was not altering the prophecies
[51:33] but recalling them
[51:35] in my opinion it seems the church age
[51:37] book version of the seven major visions
[51:39] is the most accurate recalling since
[51:41] brother branham worked with levail to
[51:43] put into print what brother branham
[51:44] agreed was the closest statements to the
[51:47] thus saith the lord
[51:48] visions as possible remember brother
[51:50] branham was not a scholar he did not
[51:52] have time to sit around and memorize
[51:54] things like people do today he was
[51:56] constantly on sick calls prayer lines
[51:58] etc
[52:00] this may explain why brother branham
[52:02] said different things about the seven
[52:03] prophecies which shows he was just
[52:05] trying to remember all the details
[52:08] third brother brahm lived in the vision
[52:10] dimension he had lots of visions which
[52:12] means a lot of mental strain
[52:14] he said i live a big part of my life in
[52:17] another dimension
[52:18] and this is a life that brother rams
[52:20] accusers don't know about because they
[52:21] don't have visions constantly like
[52:23] brother branham had
[52:25] so they don't seem to have compassion
[52:26] and consideration upon brother branham
[52:29] and also regarding the seven major
[52:31] visions we have to be very careful what
[52:33] we make thus saith the lord because not
[52:35] every word surrounding the actual words
[52:37] of thus saith the lord was in fact
[52:39] inspired from god what i mean by that is
[52:41] words a few sentences before or few
[52:44] paragraphs before or a few sentences
[52:46] after or a few paragraphs after
[52:49] none of us including brother rams
[52:50] accusers know the exact prophecies
[52:52] brother branham made in 1933 because
[52:55] they were not recorded on tape
[52:57] after the fact brother branham tried to
[52:59] write them down and remember them so we
[53:01] give brother brahm the benefit of the
[53:02] doubt as he was trying to remember the
[53:05] seven prophecies to the best of his
[53:07] recollection
[53:09] the ohio river municipal bridge vision
[53:13] this prophecy is ultimately brother
[53:15] branham's word versus his accuser's word
[53:19] brother m's accusers cannot fully prove
[53:21] with absolute certainty that 16 men
[53:24] never died because they were not there
[53:26] every day during every moment of the
[53:28] construction
[53:30] they seem to make their micro fish
[53:31] research and absolute but that doesn't
[53:34] mean it is
[53:35] now also i cannot prove sixteen men died
[53:38] but i'm taking brother branham's word
[53:39] because of his bible-based teaching and
[53:42] the vindications he was a genuine
[53:43] prophet of god
[53:44] brother brahms accusers failed to
[53:46] recognize they cannot prove by egyptian
[53:49] historical records
[53:50] that moses led two million israelis out
[53:52] of egypt there's no historical record of
[53:55] that in egypt so should we refuse the
[53:57] bible records
[53:59] of moses and the exodus
[54:01] no
[54:02] we cannot exalt human research and
[54:04] historical records to infallibility
[54:07] like brother ann's accusers are doing
[54:09] with the research they've done
[54:11] at jeffersonville libraries
[54:13] and other government agencies
[54:15] you also have to take into account that
[54:18] john or jack vissing gave a testimony
[54:21] about the ohio municipal bridge and you
[54:23] can watch that on youtube as well
[54:25] where his family members remember men
[54:28] dying during the construction of the
[54:29] ohio municipal bridge
[54:32] so again ultimately it's brother
[54:33] branham's word against the accuser's
[54:35] word
[54:36] and i'm going to stand with god's
[54:37] prophet brother branham
[54:40] the february 28 1963 arizona cloud
[54:45] again this case is ultimately brother
[54:47] brahms word against brother rams
[54:49] accusers words
[54:51] brother rams accusers cannot fully prove
[54:53] with absolute certainty that the cloud
[54:56] was formed by a rocket
[54:57] they try to make their data and
[54:59] paperwork an absolute but that doesn't
[55:01] mean it is
[55:03] also i cannot prove that the cloud was
[55:05] formed by seven angels
[55:07] i'm taking brother braham's word because
[55:09] of his bible-based teaching
[55:11] because of the cloud prophecy from sirs
[55:13] is this the end time december 30th 1962
[55:17] bill rashtran's evidence that the
[55:20] arizona cloud was formed by supernatural
[55:23] means and not human means
[55:26] and the supernatural revelation and
[55:28] vindication that god gave to brother
[55:29] branham regarding the seven seals
[55:31] sermons
[55:34] but there's a brother in the message
[55:35] named bill rostrom and you can watch his
[55:38] videos proving that the cloud could not
[55:40] have been formed by a thor rocket
[55:42] i've listened to the entire messages
[55:44] which was over six hours
[55:46] and all the scientific facts are proven
[55:48] and show that the shape of the cloud
[55:50] where it was located the time it
[55:52] appeared the density of the material
[55:54] required to make it
[55:55] all point to the fact that this was not
[55:57] a man-made cloud it was not made by a
[56:00] thor rocket it was a supernatural cloud
[56:04] another point is that brother branham
[56:05] never said thus saith the lord i was
[56:07] under the cloud when the photo was taken
[56:10] so we cannot jump to a conclusion and
[56:12] make every word of brother branham thus
[56:13] saith the lord
[56:15] some people attack brother branham
[56:16] because they say he wasn't there under
[56:18] the cloud when the photo was taken
[56:20] but to me that doesn't matter because
[56:22] brother graham never said thus say the
[56:23] lord i was under the cloud when the
[56:25] photo was taken
[56:26] a very important point is that the
[56:28] vision of the cloud and its fulfillment
[56:30] was in the name of the lord it was
[56:32] prophesied on december 30th 1962 and
[56:35] january 14th 1963. here's the first
[56:38] quote saying it's in the name of the
[56:40] lord let's listen to the
[56:43] my quote
[56:44] is god let us turn on the light
[56:48] i'm standing in an awful place if you
[56:50] but knew it
[56:53] remember i tell you in the name of the
[56:55] lord i've told you the
[56:59] in the next quote from january 14th
[57:02] brother braham said a vision sent him
[57:03] here of course that was the vision of
[57:05] the pyramid and constellation of seven
[57:08] angels let's listen to the
[57:11] i'm quote
[57:12] in phoenix
[57:13] tonight
[57:14] in the name of the lord
[57:17] i
[57:18] would will not try to explain what's
[57:21] happened
[57:22] many of people take the tapes be sure to
[57:24] get that one
[57:25] what time is it sir
[57:27] just before i left home a vision sent me
[57:30] here
[57:31] i don't know why
[57:33] i don't i'm not a tape salesman and i
[57:36] don't uh uh stress those things we get
[57:39] them and we gotta take a business around
[57:41] the world way into the jungles and
[57:44] everywhere they have a little something
[57:45] you put in the ears they got and can
[57:47] tape it into the tape and stand there
[57:49] and translate that right into the
[57:50] language and it goes around the world
[57:52] and um but the one that i had that uh
[57:56] what time is it served or is this the
[57:58] time sir
[58:00] i was saturday night three weeks ago at
[58:02] the church after all my life of seeing
[58:05] visions i never had anything like this
[58:08] before in my life i don't know what it
[58:10] is i'm just here but he sent me here
[58:14] i don't know what it means i'm just i'm
[58:16] just here
[58:19] and here on march 24 1963 brother
[58:22] branham said the vision was fulfilled
[58:24] with thus saith the lord let's listen to
[58:26] the quote
[58:28] now the vision
[58:29] plus the word plus the history plus the
[58:32] church ages and all blend together so i
[58:36] could
[58:37] truly say
[58:38] that to the best of my understanding and
[58:40] according to the word of god and the
[58:43] vision and the revelation
[58:45] the interpretation thereof is thus saith
[58:48] the lord
[58:51] another point i want to make is that
[58:52] brother branham could have been under
[58:54] the cloud
[58:55] on february 28th by translation just
[58:57] like philip
[58:59] god could have transported his physical
[59:00] body there for a moment and then brought
[59:02] him back
[59:03] or he could have been transported there
[59:05] by vision like ezekiel
[59:07] in ezekiel 8 verse 15 ezekiel was taken
[59:10] to jerusalem in the visions of god while
[59:12] sitting in his house in chaldea which
[59:14] was probably over a hundred miles away
[59:16] ezekiel's vision was not a translation
[59:18] like philip because ezekiel's body
[59:21] stayed in chaudia
[59:22] phillips body was literally translated
[59:24] to another area according to acts 8
[59:26] verses 39 and 40.
[59:28] and of course i've been mocked and made
[59:30] fun of because of these two
[59:31] possibilities that i believe in but at
[59:33] the same time they are biblical
[59:34] possibilities
[59:36] an important point is that brother brahm
[59:37] did not say the word cloud before the
[59:39] event but he did call this cloud a snow
[59:41] white pyramid so brother rams accusers
[59:44] failed to recognize this saying there's
[59:45] no prophecy about it but there is
[59:48] he just didn't say the word cloud
[59:50] he said snow white pyramid
[59:52] let's listen to the quotes
[59:54] i could see those angels
[59:57] those shaped back wings traveling faster
[1:00:01] than sound could travel they come from
[1:00:04] eternity in a split like a twinkling of
[1:00:07] an eye
[1:00:08] not enough to bachelor i just twinkle
[1:00:10] they were there
[1:00:12] i didn't have time to count i didn't
[1:00:14] have time or they just looked
[1:00:17] mighty ones great powerful angels snow
[1:00:20] white
[1:00:22] wings setting heads and they were
[1:00:26] and what it did i was caught up into
[1:00:29] this pyramid
[1:00:31] of constellation
[1:00:33] and i thought now this is it
[1:00:36] i was numbed all over
[1:00:41] questions brother rams accusers cannot
[1:00:43] or will not answer correctly or honestly
[1:00:48] in the spirit of meekness friends i
[1:00:49] encourage you to ask brother branham's
[1:00:51] accusers if they ever reach out to you
[1:00:53] for any comments or questions
[1:00:55] to at some point ask them these humble
[1:00:58] simple bible questions which they will
[1:01:00] either ignore
[1:01:01] answer dishonestly
[1:01:03] or answer incorrectly
[1:01:06] the first question is about the trinity
[1:01:08] ask which bible verse calls jesus a
[1:01:10] second person or the holy spirit a third
[1:01:13] person with those exact words
[1:01:16] the honest and correct answer is none
[1:01:18] which means the trinity dogma is a
[1:01:20] man-made creed added by men god did not
[1:01:23] call to write or interpret his holy word
[1:01:26] as a follow-up question
[1:01:28] you could ask if the bible doesn't say
[1:01:30] those words then why are you adding to
[1:01:32] the bible which carries severe
[1:01:34] repercussions
[1:01:36] and you could also ask and why does your
[1:01:38] trinitarian creed contradict the giants
[1:01:40] of the faith who wrote the bible
[1:01:43] a related question would also be why do
[1:01:45] you exalt the trinitarian giants of the
[1:01:47] last 500 years like luther wesley and
[1:01:50] others above the giants who wrote the
[1:01:52] bible
[1:01:53] this question will show brother
[1:01:54] branham's accusers will not honestly
[1:01:56] answer questions about the unbiblical
[1:01:59] trinity dogma
[1:02:00] so in this case brother brahms accusers
[1:02:02] are adding to the word of god which
[1:02:03] carries severe repercussions
[1:02:07] a second question would be which
[1:02:09] scripture in the new testament or old
[1:02:11] testament shows god asking a godly woman
[1:02:14] to cut her hair
[1:02:15] the honest and correct answer would be
[1:02:17] none because god never did ask a godly
[1:02:19] woman to cut her hair
[1:02:21] a related question to ask would be if
[1:02:23] god didn't ask a godly woman to cut her
[1:02:25] hair why do you allow your wives and
[1:02:27] daughters to cut and trim their hair
[1:02:30] in this case brother m's accusers would
[1:02:31] be taken away from the bible because
[1:02:33] first corinthians 11 verses 1 through 16
[1:02:36] clearly prove women were never to cut
[1:02:38] their hair and men were supposed to cut
[1:02:40] their hair short and remember paul said
[1:02:42] we would all be judged by his gospel
[1:02:44] according to romans 2 verse
[1:02:46] 16. a third question would be which
[1:02:49] verse in the old testament or new
[1:02:51] testament shows god allowing a man or
[1:02:53] woman to paint their faces
[1:02:55] the honest and correct answer would be
[1:02:57] none
[1:02:58] but it's likely brother brahms accusers
[1:03:00] won't answer this honestly because if
[1:03:02] they were honest they would recognize
[1:03:04] the four verses that condemn makeup
[1:03:05] wearing which are jeremiah 4 verse 30
[1:03:08] ezekiel 23 verse 40 second kings 9 30
[1:03:12] and proverbs 6 verses
[1:03:15] 16-17
[1:03:17] yet some of brother branham's accusers
[1:03:19] allow their wives and daughters to wear
[1:03:21] makeup and yet there's no biblical
[1:03:22] support for that
[1:03:24] so again in this case they're taking
[1:03:25] away from the word of god they're
[1:03:27] ignoring or explaining away those four
[1:03:29] verses that condemn wearing makeup
[1:03:33] a fourth question would be which bible
[1:03:35] verse allows cross-dressing
[1:03:37] an honest and correct answer would be
[1:03:39] none
[1:03:40] because we know god condemned it in
[1:03:42] deuteronomy 22 verse 5 and there's no
[1:03:44] new testament scripture that tells us
[1:03:46] this abomination is undone or god no
[1:03:49] longer thinks cross-dressing is an
[1:03:50] abomination anymore you can also tell
[1:03:52] brother ram's accusers according to
[1:03:54] american history a woman wearing women's
[1:03:56] pants from the women's section of the
[1:03:58] department store is still cross-dressing
[1:04:00] because they're simply wearing pants and
[1:04:02] if they doubt that they need to read the
[1:04:03] book called women and pants by cynthia
[1:04:06] gregg and catherine smith from 2003 i
[1:04:09] have this book and it fully explains the
[1:04:11] uproar that happened in america when
[1:04:13] women started wearing pants
[1:04:15] and again brother brahms accusers are
[1:04:17] taken away from the scripture
[1:04:21] a fifth question would be why do you
[1:04:23] deny the three works of grace which
[1:04:25] allows new converts to be deceived when
[1:04:27] you tell them they are already born
[1:04:29] again by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:31] when the new testament is clear that the
[1:04:33] holy ghost baptism comes sometime after
[1:04:35] a person initially believes
[1:04:38] an honest and correct answer would be
[1:04:40] that they're denying the second and
[1:04:41] third work of grace which essentially
[1:04:44] produces many false conversions you
[1:04:46] would point them to acts 19 verses 1
[1:04:48] through 6 ephesians 1 13 along with four
[1:04:52] new testament bible examples of
[1:04:53] believers who were saved but not yet
[1:04:55] born again which are mary peter
[1:04:57] cornelius and the ephesians in acts
[1:04:59] chapter 19.
[1:05:01] you can see all this on my video called
[1:05:03] you can be saved but not born again by
[1:05:05] the holy ghost baptism in your soul
[1:05:07] it's video number 101
[1:05:10] and again brother brahms accusers are
[1:05:11] taking away from the scripture by
[1:05:13] teaching there's only one work of grace
[1:05:16] a sixth question would be why don't you
[1:05:18] read brother jesse's two books that
[1:05:20] prove biblical modesty guidelines and
[1:05:23] the new testament mysteries that god had
[1:05:25] brother branham fulfill since you love
[1:05:27] research so much
[1:05:28] and since brother jesse offered them for
[1:05:30] free to some of your leaders on his 2020
[1:05:33] debate
[1:05:35] an honest and correct answer would be
[1:05:36] that they don't want to research the
[1:05:38] other side of the debate because perhaps
[1:05:40] they're afraid of the truth as it seems
[1:05:42] they're only doing selective research
[1:05:45] and only researching to prove their own
[1:05:47] narratives
[1:05:49] as a i guess preacher recently told me
[1:05:51] the fact they will not research the
[1:05:53] other side proves they are not objective
[1:05:55] and they only want to push their own
[1:05:57] narrative their own false conclusion and
[1:06:00] of course i'm giving this offer to
[1:06:01] anyone who wants to read my books i'll
[1:06:03] mail them to them for free this is the
[1:06:05] sad truth about brother ramsey's
[1:06:06] accusers they fail to research the other
[1:06:08] side when i visited many of their sites
[1:06:10] listened to almost all their podcasts
[1:06:12] and youtube videos
[1:06:14] i'm not afraid of the truth as message
[1:06:16] believers we're not afraid of the truth
[1:06:18] because the truth will set us free and
[1:06:20] prove brother branham was a genuine
[1:06:21] prophet of god
[1:06:23] a seventh question would be
[1:06:25] when will you repent of falsely claiming
[1:06:27] brother branham pretended to speak in
[1:06:29] tongues because brother jesse's video
[1:06:31] shows your false assumptions
[1:06:33] the honest and correct answer would be
[1:06:35] they will repent as soon as they watch
[1:06:37] my video which shows they misunderstood
[1:06:39] brother branham brother branham just
[1:06:41] mixed up two testimonies and brother m's
[1:06:43] accusers jumped to a false conclusion in
[1:06:45] order to slander him
[1:06:47] the video made about that is called
[1:06:49] william branham did not pretend to speak
[1:06:50] in tongues defending jesus message and
[1:06:53] messenger it's video number 84.
[1:06:57] an eighth question would be when will
[1:06:59] you repent of teaching there are women
[1:07:00] angels
[1:07:01] an honest and correct answer would be
[1:07:03] they would want to repent as soon as
[1:07:05] they watch my video about how there are
[1:07:07] no women angels the video clearly shows
[1:07:09] zechariah's vision of women with wings
[1:07:11] represented nations and not women angels
[1:07:14] because there are not two or three
[1:07:16] witnesses of women angels in the
[1:07:17] scriptures but we do have two or three
[1:07:19] witnesses of women representing nations
[1:07:22] and the video to reference would be
[1:07:24] women angels and women preachers it's
[1:07:25] video number eight
[1:07:27] so in this case brother brahms accusers
[1:07:28] are adding to the word of god which
[1:07:30] carries severe repercussions
[1:07:33] a ninth and final question would be who
[1:07:35] fulfilled revelation 10 verse 7 if
[1:07:37] brother branham did not fulfill it
[1:07:40] an honest and correct answer would be
[1:07:41] brother branham did fulfill it
[1:07:43] the seventh angel cannot be a heavenly
[1:07:45] angel because angels do not preach
[1:07:48] mysteries to men and no other prophets
[1:07:50] declared an angel would finish the
[1:07:52] mysteries but the true prophets and
[1:07:54] jesus did foretell the spirit of elijah
[1:07:56] would finish the mysteries and restore
[1:07:58] all things according to joel chapter 2
[1:08:01] verses 23-26
[1:08:03] malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 daniel 12 4
[1:08:07] matthew 17 verse 11 and luke 17 30.
[1:08:11] you can suggest they read my 2021 book
[1:08:13] called the 12 new testament mysteries
[1:08:15] revealed and in chapter 13 i give an
[1:08:18] overview of brother random's ministry
[1:08:19] and how he was a genuine prophet of god
[1:08:21] and i showed how six of the twelve of
[1:08:23] the new testament mysteries were
[1:08:25] preached by brother branham with thus
[1:08:26] saith the lord
[1:08:28] none of the following preachers have
[1:08:29] done this billy graham oral roberts
[1:08:32] kenneth copeland
[1:08:33] john piper
[1:08:35] john macarthur timothy keller
[1:08:37] joel osteen td jakes none of them have
[1:08:40] the only preacher who fulfilled
[1:08:41] revelation 10 7 was william branham
[1:08:46] in closing
[1:08:48] friends i think this video has proven
[1:08:50] beyond a shadow of a doubt that many
[1:08:52] bible prophecies visions and written
[1:08:54] promises are conditional
[1:08:57] and they can be conditional promises to
[1:08:59] an individual or a nation
[1:09:01] william branham was a genuine prophet of
[1:09:03] god as all the evidence shows
[1:09:05] and yet the same time he was human and
[1:09:07] he made mistakes and he disobeyed words
[1:09:09] from the lord but that's a universal
[1:09:11] problem that all christians have
[1:09:14] they love the lord jesus christ some of
[1:09:16] them are baptized with the holy ghost in
[1:09:18] their souls and the bible says in first
[1:09:20] john 3 that the seed of god does not sin
[1:09:23] but then paul says no good thing dwells
[1:09:25] in my flesh
[1:09:26] and paul says i have a war going on in
[1:09:28] my mind
[1:09:29] i want to serve the law of god but also
[1:09:32] have sin battling me in my mind as well
[1:09:34] the scriptures and history prove brother
[1:09:37] branham was a genuine prophet and if i
[1:09:39] can be a help to you especially if
[1:09:41] you're a pastor or minister
[1:09:42] with these subjects feel free to reach
[1:09:44] out to me by email please and lord
[1:09:47] willing i'll get back to you as soon as
[1:09:48] i can by the grace of god
[1:09:51] if you have any questions concerns or
[1:09:53] testimonies about this video please
[1:09:55] contact me
[1:09:58] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[1:10:00] the desire of your heart
