TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] happy to see today is our first Pastor brother James Jones from Indianapolis back there [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is part two in a series proving that Jim Jones did not believe the bible-based message that God gave to his Prophet brother William Branham I'll begin with a disclaimer about the sensitive nature of this episode please do not allow children to listen to this episode as I have to cover some of the incredibly Wicked sins committed by Jim Jones but of course I'll just give a general overview of them and not include details and I'll also share some audio of Jim Jones himself as a review here's the outline of this series in part one we looked at the first three sections of this series first we looked at the accusation and character of brother Ram's accusers second we looked at the one brother random quote about Jim Jones and their Association and the third section was brother branham's nine warnings to Pastor Jim Jones and his associate pastors from October 1956. in this video we'll cover sections four and five section 4 is historical facts about Jim Jones and section 5 is a summary where we'll contrast the difference between Jim Jones and brother Branham and listen to audio from Jim Jones but before beginning section 4 I want to share two things that I believe will help the viewers understand that brother Branham had nothing to do with Jim Jones gross wickedness first I want to play audio from Jim Jones himself proving Jim Jones was an enemy of brother Branham as I mentioned in part one of this video series it's clear Jim Jones was against brother Branham in this audio you're about to hear you'll hear Jim Jones say he prophesied of brother random's death and said brother Branham would lose his head in Texas and also said that brother Branham told Jim Jones that Jim Jones could not preach the truth of the Bible of course these are lies from Jim Jones and the proof of that is that brother Branham did not lose his head in the car accident that led to his death in Texas in December of 1965. this proves Jim Jones was a false prophet and later we'll see how he falsely prophesied of a nuclear attack on Indianapolis in 1967 and of course that failed and a second proof from this audio is that brother random spent his entire life preaching the truth of the Bible and was unafraid and unashamed to preach the truth of the Bible the Gospel of Jesus Christ many times brother Brennan would preach one two three four or more hours on one sermon and from my personal experience no Bible teacher I've listened to has taught me more about the Bible than brother Branham let's listen to the audio from Jim Jones they won't tell you the truth because the black book is the easiest gravy trained that they've ever been on yes Alan came to me all Robert spoke this Billy Graham came right to us arms Jack and me and play through Hotel said I don't believe a thing in that Bible hardly right but he said it's the way to make a living Billy Graham who I prophesied his death Billy Branham rather said his head would be I said you lose his head his head was cut off in Texas he said you can't preach the truth about that Bible he said preach reincarnation you cannot preach the truth about the Bible you will be in trouble I said I choose to treat you preach the truth he said well I'll be around while you will be in trouble well I'm still here and his head is cut off of his body [Music] now friends this audio proves Jim Jones was an enemy of brother Branham from his own words and Jim Jones and brother bran were not in fellowship and remember there's only one brother random quote about Jim Jones and then that sermon showed that brother random knew little to nothing about Jim Jones because brother Ram said he didn't know whether the pastor would appreciate brother random preaching about women wearing modest clothing and women not cutting their hair and Friends remember brother random spent the last seven years of his life from 1958 to 1965 never having any fellowship with Jim Jones not mentioning him not giving him any support proving again brother Branham Is Not Guilty by association with Jim Jones and the second thing I want to share is an example of weak research from Brother Graham's accusers and one accuser in particular one of brother Ram's accusers apparently wrote a book about brother Branham and Jim Jones and on one of his videos he shows an introduction page it seems from this book and uses a quote from Brother Branham from 1956 from the sermon that Jim Jones was mentioned by Brother Branham and in this quote from Brother Branham it's at the close of the service and brother Brown said the spirit of God would be poured out and that it might fill people with the Holy Ghost or it might send forth a Ministry brother Adam's accuser tries to use this quote to say brother Brandon was sending forth Jim Jones's Wicked Ministry and of course this is an assumption it's a lie it's a misinterpretation of brother Ram's quote notice brother random's Accuser failed to read on or fail to continue listening to brother branham's quote because just a few short paragraphs after brother Ram said this brother and recognized what the pouring out of the Holy Spirit was and it was not to send forth Jim Jones's Ministry it was for healing forgiveness and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to all those who believed in the congregation this mistake of failing to read on or failing to listen on is a very common mistake of brother Ram's accusers just like I showed in the series on the Seven Seals where there were over 38 differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin and Charles Taze Russell and Uriah Smith on the Seven Seals and in most of those cases brother Ram's accusers just had to continue reading and the differences between brother Branham and those three men were just one paragraph or sometimes just one sentence away but that of course proves brother Ram's accusers research is biased on purpose so here's a picture of brother Ram's accusers book from his own video here's the cover of the book and apparently this is the introduction page or some page in the beginning of the accuser's book and the quote he uses from Brother Branham says quote I believe that God's going to pour out here in a few moments something I don't whether it's going to be a spontaneous healings whether it's going to be a filling with the Holy Ghost whether it's going to be a sending forth of a Ministry I don't know but something's fixing to happen remember I told you I never felt this right in the prayer line ask anybody here's men that's been with me since I was early in the ministry you've never seen that it picked up and I feel strong enough look like till run a mile C run through a troop and leap over wall I never felt that way never come back like that something started something's happening end quote so notice it's clear brother Branham said I don't know what the outpouring of the spirit is going to be and yet brother Ram's accuser says the outpouring was brother random sending forth Jim Jones's Ministry and of course that's a lie shortly after this quote from Brother Branham you hear Brother random singing the song there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins and then in paragraph 86 brother Branham sees the pouring forth of the Holy Spirit and he says quote here it is why it's all over the building everywhere end quote so let's listen to both quotes the quote where brother random says he doesn't know what the pouring out is going to be and then we'll hear the quote where he knows what the pouring out is the pouring out is for healing and for Sinners to be forgiven and the Holy Spirit going to baptize this place illuminate it and then brother random condemns the devil in the name of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quotes fourth of a Ministry I don't know but something's fixing to happen remember I told you and to report this right in the prayer line ask anybody yours man's been with me since I was early in the ministry you've never seen that it picked up and I'll feel strong enough look like though just run a mile and see where they run through a troop Leaf over a wall I never felt that way never come back like that something started something's happening and I see the vision of people swarming down the aisle with her hands up and here they are just exactly where it was showing division one more time to sing before we go to prayer [Music] won't you come to the power I'll raise my hand to you won't you come up here Jordan let me join with you in prayer if God will hear my prayer for the blood and the wickedness all right [Applause] I want to ask you something do you feel strange I I'm not going by feelings but I'm going with that vision and Something's Happened Here do you believe that if there's anybody crippled or flicked I'll be your healed something I'm happy to ever Sinners forgiven I believe the Holy Spirits go to baptize this place illuminated are you ready people are you ready to receive it look at the people standing up this automatically there it is [Music] [Music] so this example again shows the cognitive dissonance of brother Ram's accusers rather than recognizing the truth about this particular quote and the pouring out of the spirit being Divine Healing forgiveness for Sinners and the baptism of the Holy Ghost for those who wanted the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Ram's accusers cognitive dissonance caused him to misinterpret this quote about a possible sending forth of a ministry as brother random supporting Jim Jones which brother Brown did not support Jim Jones brother Brown did not send forth Jim Jones's Ministry the cognitive dissonance of brother Ram's accuser caused him to automatically misinterpret this quote about sending forth a Ministry Yet brother I am saying I don't know what the spirit is going to pour out brother Ram's accuser automatically makes false assumptions and false interpretations of brother Brown's quotes on purpose in order to relieve his mental anxiety that perhaps brother random was a true prophet of God now let's get to section 4 on historical facts about Jim Jones friends this is a brief overview I'm only using three online sources but all three sources seem to agree on all the facts about Jim Jones and then all these facts agreed with the audio that I'll share in the next section the audio from Jim Jones himself so the first website says in 1955 Jones left the Assemblies of God after starting there in 1953 this site says Jones left and established wings of healing a new church that would later be named The People's Temple now this website says Jones held his first joint meetings with William Branham in 1955 but again I can't confirm that all I know is that the tapes of brother Branham say brother random preached there in 1956. the same website populartimes.com said in 1956 Jones was ordained as an independent Assembly of God Minister by Joseph Matson Boze I cannot confirm that statement about Boze but then this website said Jones had meetings with brother Branham and that is true because we see the proof of that on tape but of course brother Brandon Warren Jones at least nine times in that sermon and Jones did not take heed to the warnings populartimes.com again said in 1958 Jones made a second visit to Father Divine in 1958 to learn more about his practices then Jones bragged to his congregation that he would be like the successor of Father Divine and if you do research on Father Divine he was a false teacher who exercised excessive control over his congregants and friends this show is just two years after being in meetings with brother Branham Jim Jones had already left brother Ram's influence and went to a false teacher in 1960 again populartimes.com says Jones gradually separated from Pentecostalism and the laterane movement and then in 1960 people's Temple joined the Disciples of Christ denomination and remember brother warned Jones not to denominate or join a denomination in the 1956 sermon again showing Jones did not listen to brother Branham then in 1963 populartimes.com said that Jones gave a prophecy to his Indiana congregation that the world would be engulfed by nuclear war on July 15 1967 leading to a new socialist Eden on Earth and that the temple must move to Northern California for safety so of course this is a false Prophecy from Jim Jones then in 1964 Jones joined and was ordained a minister by the Disciples of Christ then in 1965 a second website NZ herald.co writes that by 1965 when Jones was in his mid-30s he drifted away from traditional Christian teachings describing himself as a messiah and claiming he was The Reincarnation of figures like Christ and Buddha so notice Friends by 1965 brother Ram's last year on Earth Jim Jones was no longer teaching Christianity he was a self-proclaimed Messiah and claimed to be The Reincarnation of Christ and Buddha a third website the gospel coalition.org said in 1965 Jim Jones told his parishioners quote if you're born in a socialist Community then you're not born in sin end quote and of course this is a Lie the Bible says we're all born in sin Romans 3 says we've all fallen short of the glory of God because of our sin and brother Branham said numerous times at least 10 times were all born in sin so we can clearly see by 1965 Jim Jones was not teaching Christianity he was disagreeing with the Bible itself and exalting socialism to the absolute truth and not the Bible in the early 1970s The Gospel Coalition website said Jones abandoned all pretense of being a Christian minister and Jones began preaching he was The Reincarnation of Buddha Gandhi Vladimir Lenin and Jesus the website says quote he would preach sermons lasting six hours or more in which he showed a preoccupation with sex the website goes on to say quote Jones a bisexual reportedly had numerous affairs with both men and women in his congregation his former bodyguard claimed that Jones appointed one of his secretaries to arrange for women church members to sleep with him he was also arrested in Hollywood Theater on lewd conduct charge after an undercover Los Angeles policeman said Jones had tried to molest him end quote populartimes.com said in 1974 after a period of negative publicity and reports of abuse at people's Temple Jones ordered the construction of the Jonestown commune in Guyana in 1974 and convinced or compel many of his followers to live there with him in March of 1977 a story in the new West magazine exposed the abuses at the people's Temple the article included allegations by Temple defectors a physical emotional and sexual abuse shortly after this Jim Jones fled the USA and went to live with some of his followers in Guyana and then tragically in November 1978 Congressman Ryan led a fact-finding mission to Jonestown to investigate allegations of Human Rights abuses his delegation included relatives of Temple members and NBC camera crew and reporters for several newspapers the group arrived in the Guyanese capital of Georgetown on November 15th but tragically on November 18 1978 Jim Jones's security guards murdered all of Congressman Ryan's party and then that led to the mass suicide of Jones and his followers this mass murder suicide resulted in the deaths of over 909 inhabitants of Jonestown it was the greatest single loss of American civilian life the massive loss of life on September 11 2001. some of Jim Jones last words were caught on tape and I'll play in a little bit but one of his quotes was quote without me life has no meaning just relax and you'll have no problem end quote here again we see Jim Jones exalting himself as equal to God of course this proves Jim Jones was a demon-possessed wicked person in closing friends for time's sake I got to stop right here this is the end of part two but Lord willing I'll finish this series with part three later in the next week by the grace of God I'll end with this quote I heard brother random say this recently it's from the anointed ones at the end time 1965 and it just related so well to brother branham's warnings to Jim Jones and what eventually played out in Jim Jones's life brother random says every Prophet cursed denominations and of course Jim Jones was warned by Brother random not to get into denomination yet he went into denomination and then again brother Branham used the example of Ahab and how Ahab reaped what he sowed he listened to lying prophets which led to his death and just like brother Brandon Moore and Jim Jones Jim Jones was the lying Prophet that led he and his over 900 followers to their deaths and brother Graham said all you false teachers so saith God someday you'll reap what you're sowing you blind leaders of the blind end quote what an astonishing warning from the Holy Spirit to all false teachers including Jim Jones that they will reap what they sow Jim Jones sowed all these awful sins he was a demon-possessed man and sadly he reaped what he sowed let's listen to the quote from Brother Branham the holy spirit is the prophet of this hour and vindicating his word proving it the Holy Spirit was the prophet of Moses hour the Holy Spirit was a prophet of America's hour the Holy Spirit which wrote the word Crimson compared to her I didn't happen in the time in America Ahab was killed and the dogs licked his daughter according to the word of God all you forces Dear God [Music] I'm not angry I'm just telling you the truth in that room with the Holy Spirit as they say in that manner have I ever told you anything wrong but what God proved it to be right amen [Applause] before it's too late if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music] foreign
