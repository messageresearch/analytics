[0:05] this is coming into that third Flor
[0:08] amen I'm believing this and I want to
[0:11] ask you a sincere question you that pass
[0:14] through the prayer line can you actually
[0:16] believe and feel now that there is
[0:19] something happened in you since you've
[0:20] had hand fade on your
[0:22] L Hall there he is this is what we
[0:26] waited for now this is not this is just
[0:28] starting to bloom now see just started I
[0:31] did this for a
[0:33] purpose I did this for a purpose I'm
[0:35] working out
[0:37] something taking this charge of faith
[0:39] and going right back to it again and
[0:41] come in see to kind of raise faith in a
[0:44] bracket where you never noticed it that
[0:46] way before not a faith but a perfect
[0:48] Faith Build It Up in your and watch a
[0:51] perfect god with a perfect heart keep a
[0:55] perfect Promise by perfect words which
[0:57] is sharper than a 28 sword and
[1:00] thoughts of the heart amen what we're
[1:03] coming out to the Perfection because the
[1:05] people has to come to this in order for
[1:07] the Rapture amen that's what's holding
[1:10] away right now is waiting for that
[1:12] church to come in to that perfect
[1:14] Rapture in faith looking for it means a
[1:17] lot of Shaving down for me it means a
[1:20] lot for you but together we'll make it
[1:22] by the grace of
[1:24] God
[1:26] [Music]
[1:28] am
[1:35] but what about the true seed it will
[1:38] happen just as we have said the people
[1:40] of God are being made ready by the word
[1:42] of truth from the messenger to this age
[1:45] in her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[1:47] for the spirit will bring the people
[1:49] right back to where they were at the
[1:51] beginning that is thus saith the
[1:55] Lord it is thus saith the Lord for that
[1:58] is what Joel to 23- 26 says be glad then
[2:03] ye children of Zion and rejoice in the
[2:05] Lord your God for he hath given you the
[2:08] former rain moderately and he will cause
[2:10] to come down for you the rain the former
[2:13] rain and the latter rain in the first
[2:15] month and the floors shall be full of
[2:17] Wheat and the fats shall overflow with
[2:20] wine and oil and I will restore to you
[2:22] the years that the Locust have eaten the
[2:25] canker worms and the caterpillar and the
[2:27] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[2:30] among you and you shall eat in plenty
[2:32] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[2:34] the Lord your God that hath dealt
[2:37] wondrously with you and my people shall
[2:39] never be
[2:41] ashamed now it says God is going to
[2:43] restore the Lutheran age did not restore
[2:46] the church it started a Reformation the
[2:49] Wesleyan age did not restore the
[2:51] Pentecostal age did not restore but God
[2:55] has to restore for he cannot deny his
[2:57] word this is not the resur direction of
[3:00] the church it is the
[3:02] restoration God will take the church
[3:04] right back to Pentecost of the beginning
[3:07] now notice in verse 25 it tells why we
[3:09] need restoration the Locust cankerworm
[3:13] caterpillar and Palmer worm have eaten
[3:15] all but the root and a small bit of the
[3:17] stem now we are told that all these
[3:19] insects are all one and the same in
[3:21] different stages that is right they are
[3:25] the Antichrist spirit manifested in
[3:26] organization denomination and false
[3:29] Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor
[3:31] little root and stock is going to be
[3:34] restored God isn't going to plant a new
[3:36] church but is going to bring his
[3:38] original planting back to Original Seed
[3:41] he is doing it as started in verse 23 by
[3:44] the teaching or former rain next will
[3:47] come the Harvest rain or rapturing
[3:58] faith
[4:01] so
[4:03] now I am going to say something to you
[4:07] now that I haven't said all
[4:09] along that is the thing that we have
[4:13] looked forward to for so long or at
[4:15] least many years four five years or
[4:18] maybe longer the third pull has now been
[4:22] Vindicated and I'm sure you all know
[4:25] what it is now remember it the never be
[4:30] an impersonation of that because it
[4:31] can't be it cannot be now it's
[4:37] inexistent
[4:39] and I have I am warned of this that
[4:45] soon right at this time now it's just
[4:48] happened so it could identify its
[4:52] presence among
[4:53] you see but it will not be used in a
[4:57] great way until this Council begins to
[5:02] tighten up and when it does when that
[5:06] does the Pentecostals and so forth can
[5:09] almost impersonate anything can be done
[5:12] but when that time comes when the
[5:14] squeeze comes down then you'll see what
[5:17] you've seen temporarily be manifested in
[5:20] the fullness of its
[5:23] power
[5:25] now I must continue in evangelism
[5:30] just as I was commissioned first I must
[5:33] continue on
[5:34] therefore you've had the word and you
[5:37] know what to look for how to stand I
[5:41] must continue on in evangelism and
[5:44] friends of mine keep still and just keep
[5:48] moving on for the hour is approaching
[5:52] swiftly see that when something is going
[5:54] to be done now you might see some little
[5:59] odd things happen for me nothing sinful
[6:02] I don't mean that but I mean something
[6:04] odd to what the regular Trend because
[6:07] where I reached to now in the ministry
[6:10] I'm dropping back here watching that
[6:13] spot and waiting for the time to use it
[6:18] but it's going to be
[6:20] used and everyone knows that for as
[6:24] certain as the first was identified so
[6:28] has the second been identified and if
[6:31] you'll think real closely you who are
[6:34] spiritual as the Bible said here's the
[6:35] him that has wisdom the third is
[6:38] properly
[6:39] identified we know where it is so the
[6:42] third pull is here it is so sacred that
[6:45] I mustn't say much about it as he told
[6:48] me in the beginning said this say
[6:51] nothing of it you remember that years
[6:52] ago it speaks for
[6:55] itself but to I've tried to explain the
[6:58] others and I made a mistake this will be
[7:00] the thing that to my opinion I don't say
[7:03] the Lord tells me this this will be the
[7:05] thing that'll start the Rapture in faith
[7:07] for the going
[7:09] away and I must lay quiet for just a
[7:13] little while now remember and who's
[7:15] listening this tape you might see such a
[7:17] change in my ministry right away
[7:19] dropping back not going up dropping back
[7:22] we're right at the edge now and it can't
[7:24] be can't go any further we have to wait
[7:26] just a minute until this happens over
[7:28] here to catch up then the time comes but
[7:31] it's thoroughly identified there's
[7:34] coming a Time upon in this nation to
[7:37] where this nation is going to exercise
[7:40] all the power that the Beast had before
[7:42] it which was Pagan Rome when it become
[7:44] Papa
[7:45] Rome that's this nation will do that
[7:49] Revelations 13 plainly explains it the
[7:52] lamb come up out of the Earth the other
[7:54] beasts come up out of water thickness
[7:55] and multitudes of people this lamb come
[7:57] up where there was no people a lamb
[8:00] represents uh religion uh the Lamb of
[8:04] God and remember it spoke like a lamb it
[8:07] was a lamb and then after a while it be
[8:11] received power and spoke like a dragon
[8:15] and exercis all the the dragon power the
[8:18] dragon had before him and the dragon is
[8:21] Rome always so don't you see Roman
[8:26] denomination a mark Protestant
[8:30] denomination uh image unto the beast
[8:33] making a power that'll force all
[8:36] Protestants like a union you'll have to
[8:38] be into this Council of churches or you
[8:42] won't be able to have fellowship or to
[8:46] well it's it's practically that way now
[8:48] you can't go to a church and preach L
[8:50] you have a fellowship card or some
[8:52] identification and now on Persons like
[8:55] ourselves we're going to be cut out of
[8:57] all that altoe that's exactly because
[8:59] they won't be able to do it it's
[9:01] tightening and then when that time comes
[9:04] and the Press comes to a place where
[9:06] you're pressed out then watch what I'm
[9:08] fixing to tell you in a few minutes
[9:10] watch the third pull then and it'll be
[9:13] absolutely to the total lost but it it
[9:16] will be for the bride in the church now
[9:19] we're closer than it seems to be I don't
[9:23] know when but it's real real close I may
[9:27] be building a platform for somebody else
[9:30] to step
[9:31] on I may be taken before that time I
[9:35] don't know and that time may be this
[9:37] coming week that the holy spirit will
[9:40] come with and bring Christ Jesus he may
[9:43] come this next week he may come yet
[9:45] tonight I don't know when he will come
[9:48] he doesn't tell us that but I do believe
[9:51] that we are so close that I will never
[9:53] die with old age yet at 54 years old
[9:56] I'll never die with old age until he's
[9:58] here
[9:59] unless I'm shot killed or something
[10:01] other some way killed this old age
[10:03] wouldn't kill me until he's come and I
[10:06] believe that and I want to say this I've
[10:08] never said it before but according to
[10:11] scripture according to what he said 30
[10:13] years ago 33 years ago on the river down
[10:16] there in 19 and33 rather what he said
[10:20] everything has happened just exactly I
[10:23] may not do it but this message will
[10:26] introduce Jesus Christ to the world for
[10:28] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[10:31] the first coming so is the message to
[10:34] forun the second coming and John said
[10:37] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[10:39] the sin of the world so it's it
[10:41] paralleled it in every way and I know it
[10:44] will the message Will Go
[10:47] On
