words let me have a heart like your heart lord how many want that by god's grace i want a heart just like jesus praise god that's what we desire we always want to know more about the lord praise god let's take our bibles and lord willing we'll do i like to look at blessings and curses again today so let's go to deuteronomy 28. i believe we'll start there deuteronomy 28 verse one jeremy 28-1. reverses one and two let's read one and two together it's a little bit longer verse but uh what beautiful promises uh for the saints who keep the conditions of god's promises in the holy land praise god in the promised land and we as we saw in part two a lot of these carry over to the christian life praise god so let's read verses one and two on three one two three and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god praise god let's have a word of prayer you have a need under your heart just make it known unto the lord here as we seek his blessings we seek his mercy of course there's a channel for that it's called repentance and obedience so let us pray together heavenly father we're so grateful for these promises lord these blessings that you promised to your people father as we saw on wednesday night lord israel was exalted above every nation a peculiar treasure because they kept your commands lord god you foreknew that abraham would want to serve you and obey you he'd be willing to leave his family behind and follow after you lord so we've done the same we know we're a peculiar people this morning lord born again of the holy spirit lord wash in the blood of jesus christ and hungering and thirsting for your righteousness today so bless your people lord quench their holy thirst today lord as our souls are thirsty for more of you today father grant it lord and i just pray god in our hearts would hearken diligently to every word of god lord that we can enjoy your blessings father god and lord just live in them and share them with others lord god and do our part lord to finish the great commission we ask all these things in jesus christ's name from the saints said amen praise god god bless you as being seated there praise god i do have some uh slides here uh okay so we'd like to look at this thought on blessings and curses here uh this morning i was thinking about going a different way but as i just studied yesterday i just uh kind of come back to this and um i have a whole lot more scriptures to go i'm searching the whole bible on the word curse and i'm at exodus 21 17. i've already done the new testament but i'm stuck right there at exodus uh 21-17 because there's so much about blessings and curses and so i trust that the lord will help me to deliver the message today i'm going to try not to yell and scream and shout and praise god i'm just so happy to be here i'm going to try to contain myself because i am honestly i'm still a little tired uh this week i went back to work you know all week all five days and just a little tired uh but i just had to preach by the thing i just had to buddy just had to get to see my god that's yeah that's even having a chance to greet you buddy god bless you sir good to see you thanks god so god bless everybody this morning uh so let's look at uh this this uh scripture it's a beautiful beautiful scripture i just want to quickly uh briefly review uh part two if you got your bibles let's go to second samuel 24. i just some of these were so astonishing to me uh i just i felt like we need to read them over again i just thought they were just so amazing uh to me church is fresh revelation whenever i find something that uh it just it pieces the the story of god it pieces the mind of god together like brother and i talked about a puzzle whenever you find a revelation and it's god's revelation when you put it into the picture of god it makes the picture clear and that's what i find as i study the scripture the picture's becoming clear praise god amen amen and i was sharing a few things with amen i'll share in a little bit but just about some scriptures now this scripture is so beautiful uh because to background a little bit god was needing to punish israel because he deals with them as a nation but he needed a reason to do it right he needed a reason to do it so god god god knows that david wants to number the people or i'm sorry he's been tempted of the devil uh to want to number the people and so god knows david is going to give in to that it's a sin it's awful sin but god is going to use that knowing david is going to sin and number the people god's going to use that occasion to bring punishment upon the rest of the nation okay it's such a it's such a striking thing and it proves this god will always use human free more agency bias for knowledge in other words in other words god is only going to use people's free will god is not going to force things upon people until the judgment praise god but ultimately that was their choice anyway right so to me it magnifies free more agency sometimes i listen online and i hear preachers make it sound like almost like we don't even have a choice if that's the case then we're all just mindless robots and we really don't love god we're just programmed to do it but it's not that way it's we have the choice it's we have the free moral ability to choose to love god and because we choose to love god we are his dearly beloved praise god we are his special people praise god uh because he said whosoever will let him come and so god is off he offers it to everybody the bible said god would not that any man perish but god wants all to be saved but he know they won't so by his foreknowledge he has a special people he calls them his bride amen he calls him his nearly beloved he calls him his his peculiar people his chosen nation his holy seed amen and he calls them they are predestinated to be his bride but it's because they're choosing god's ways over satan's ways now look at verse 1 and again the anger the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david of course god don't tempt any man so this is written in mysteries right this is written in a way that it would maybe confuse the critic well see god is god is leading david to to sin and that's not true he's not so it's just written a little bit strange right and he moved david against them to say go and number israel and judah for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was with him go now through all the tribes of israel from dan even to beersheba and number ye the people that i may know the number of the people see david at this point he got a little you know he's already committed with a adultery with bathsheba he's getting you know all the blood was upon his house the the the chastisements and here he's a little he's a little he's either a little fearful or prideful praise god because he wants to number his people and see how big he's become right we got to be careful not to number ourselves right or not not to think too big of our numbers praise god and so see it was a sin and he says uh he said now verse 3 and job joab said unto the king now the lord thy god added to the people how many so ever they be a hundredfold that the eyes of the lord the king may see it but why that the lord my king delight in this thing so see joab look at look at how god will send you a friend to correct you when you're wrong right and look i love it god had joab must have been a real strong-willed man because he didn't he didn't bend or he didn't just say okay he wasn't a yes man like okay king okay okay i've got a lot of yes men and women around the message right there they're afraid to stand up for the truth of god even when a leader is wrong right they're scared to stand up against it but thank god that there's some that are just so devoted to god's word that they'll even stand up to the king praise god and stand upon the truth of his word so he says ah we shouldn't why are you delighting in your numbers why are you delighting in the numbers why don't you just be happy with god's increase and not get excited about your numbers so who wins whose word is going to win the king or joab notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against joab and against the captain the host and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people israel and they passed over jordan and pitched in area or on the right side of the city that lies in the midst of the river of gad and toward jay zier and i'm going to skip down a little bit verse 9. and joab gave up the sum of the people i'm sorry number of the people under the king and there were in israel 800 000 valiant men that drew the sword and the men of judah were 500 000 men now look at verse 10 and david's heart smote him after that he numbered the people and david said lord i have sinned greatly in that i have done now here's a man after god's own heart praise god he makes a mistake and as soon as the holy spirit reveals it to him he said be merciful to me amen he had such a trust in god that in every victory he'd dance and rejoice and praise the lord but in every failure he was humble enough to say i'm guilty i'm the one that sinned greatly how many want to be humble like that praise god oh god help us to be sensitive to the holy spirit that when we see we made a mistake we can say i'm sorry lord i'm the one that's greatly sinned he said i have done very foolishly finishing verse 10. actually i skipped a few sentences in there and now i beseech the o lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly so david admits i should have known better i did know better and i went i went against joab's warning i went against that i've sinned greatly remember god had remember verse one he had to punish israel somehow so he uses somebody else's uh uh human weakness in order to punish other people right now only the only person that could do that is someone who's infinite right may god help us not to get revenge on others right help us not to think well if i mistreat somebody it must have been god's uh judgment against them let's not be like that because you probably won't do like david didn't say i've sinned greatly afterwards right when people have the wrong motive and objective we don't want to see anybody suffer right but god uses it to punish the people see god will always use people's free more agency to accomplish all of his purposes now look at verse 11. for when david was up in the morning the word lord came unto the prophet gad david seer saying i like that amen the word when did it come in the morning amen i know it comes at night sometimes too but look at this the word of god came in the morning here we are in the morning in the house of god amen that's when god's word comes amen many times go and say unto david thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose the one of them that i may do it to thee now look at this so god came to david and told him and said shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee three months before thy enemies while they pursue thee or that there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what answer i shall return to him that set me and david said unto god i am in a great straight let us fall now in the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let me not fall into that hand of man so seven years of famine three months of running from your enemies now he'd already been through that with years with saul right or three days of pestilence so he chooses the three days of pestilence and we know the story i believe 70 000 uh died yes verse 50 says uh so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to beersheba 70 000 men remember they already had three years of famine because of saul's bloody treatment of the gibby knights so he'd already been through three years of family didn't want to do seven he'd already run from saul he didn't want to do that didn't want to run from men again so he takes the three days of pestilence i tell him my chronovirus lasted about two and a half days by the way not quite three days that fever lasts about two and a half days my back ached like crazy i had an awful headache for about a day and a half uh but by that by the half of the two and a half day point i was washing this to change diapers i changed at least one day for a day so thank the lord for his mercy now david here he uh he smotes himself because he knows it was wrong to want to know the number of the people for his sake praise god and so we see that uh god will always deal through man's free more agency in other words church we shouldn't blame god for anything if anything happens if whatever happens we should be able to say the lord gives the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord but i'm not going to blame the holy one of israel i won't blame him because he does all things well praise god he is good and his mercy endureth forever glory now i also want to look at uh a few things here uh did you notice from the old testament to the new testament so now back to deuteronomy 28. so while you're turning deuteronomy 28 yeah i wanted to read that at the bottom that whole story of david god never works outside of three more agency nor can he attempt man he worked through david's backsliding to punish israel for their long term for their long-term backsliding now deuteronomy 28 now remember 27 has all these curses for secret idols helping and judging uh the weak and then sexual sins it gives all these curses so it kind of gives starts with some prelude of curses and then it goes into all the blessings the blessings are verses 1 to 14. but i specifically wanted to show uh the the summary here and then verse 33. so the summary of blessings is if you and i diligently serve god every day not just sundays praise god not just wednesdays but if we diligently serve god every day he'll exalt us spiritually in other words people you might we not we won't be exalted physically right because that would make us prideful like david's numbering issue there but he will exalt us in a spiritual fashion where people will have to acknowledge that there's something different about our lives right we're not low in the faith we're exalted in the faith we're not people of dishonor we're people of honor see reproduction spiritually saving souls uh filling with the holy ghost and naturally health victory we're the head not the tail and we're above not below praise god amen if we're above then every demon is under our feet praise god like like paul told the romans satan will soon shortly he'll be put under your feet praise god hallelujah but now i just want to uh just i want to go back there the curses are are so many we read them a couple the last time i preached on a wednesday night here at the church there were just so many curses uh and there was such a connection uh like even with the health of man so i i don't know if i got the right scripture down there but if you go to verse 33 look at uh deuteronomy 28 33 and as i was reviewing yesterday i just thought i just really want the church to see this uh and myself i want us all to see this because we should be a church of conquerors we should not be a church of defeated christians praise god we are not less than conquerors we are more than conquerors amen right we're not uh just weak and beggarly and just trying to get by we're supposed to be overcomers but one of the curses of not serving god was to be a constantly oppressed and constantly losing the battles so i want to just emphasize that that we're not losers we're winners praise god we might lose a few battles but we're going to win the war praise god amen now it was verse 33 the fruit of thy land and all thy labors shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up and thou shalt only i'm sorry thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed always see we we we need to start recognizing in our lives and maybe in other people's lives people that are in continual victory or people that people that are in continual defeat we should be in continual victory praise god and if we see ourselves getting defeat then we need to diligently hearken to the word of god amen amen and if we see people diligently i'm sorry diligently disobeying or if we see people constantly being defeated then we've got to just give a word to try to encourage them and raise them out of their unbelief amen remember the bible said if a man's overtaken in a fault go to him in meekness and try to restore him to the faith but protect yourself unless you get tempted as well i'll partially paraphrase that from galatians 6 but i think you understand so we should be able to look at the pattern of our of your life can you and i look at the pattern of our life for 2020 i was telling amen to bad guys i said this 2020 has been nothing but a blessing i mean i was sick about you know three days with coronavirus mother and that it's been an awesome year praise god a lot of victories amen a lot of blessings in my life where god has provided and helped and and give me more time and rest i don't think i've ever had this much rest physically and rest from work you know with uh going home with the remote learning i've just had more rest all right because i went back to school on monday banging i felt like my head was going to spin off at the end of the day i got about you know 2018 kids asking me questions all that all day just like this i felt like my head was going to spin off by the end of the day thank god i got a nice wife and children at home that loved me praise god it can help me to rest a little bit because it's just so much stress but uh i just wanted to remind us of this that it's so important that we should see a pattern of victory amen like joshua they had a pattern of victory until aiken let in those babylonian garments and the wedge of gold till he stole something until he brought something accursed in the camp oh god help us to have holy things in the camp help us to look at holy things on our phone praise god help us to read holy books in our houses praise god amen see it should be victory upon victory upon victory so see they only had this uh when they disobeyed it was just constant struggle constant struggle constant losses i'm just a slave and uh i can't i can't do anything to get out of this situation oh i i don't know about you but i know a chain breaker praise god amen i know way maker today his name's jesus praise god amen and you go to him and you confess your sins you confess your wrongs and he'll lift the curse off your life and he'll put the blessing on it amen by his grace by his blood now i i thought there's more i wanted to say but on that one but i think i'll just move on uh that we can understand this we must understand that we should be victorious we should be more than conquerors we should be overcomers praise god now um yeah we have a constant victory and we should overcome uh constant losses yeah in deuteronomy 28 let's read that one 21-22 now look at verse 21 this was pestilence so this reminded me of coronavirus i'm just i'm just kind of been on that lately right the lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee until you have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess it so the pestilences the corona viruses of those days was going to kill them or take them off the land verse 22 the lord shall smite thee with a conception that was a lung disease right so you have trouble breathing and i had a little bit of trouble breathing and with a fever i had a fever and with inflammation i don't know if i had that and with an extreme burning and with the sword and with the blasting with the mildew and they shall pursue thee until thou perish so this curse would just be continually continually worse and worse they can't recover they can't get the healing they can't get the victory because it's a curse because they've disobeyed the word of the lord praise god now look at that and this is what struck me so hard was that in the new testament we have the same thing if we don't take the communion the right way then we get the same thing many are weak and sickly among you praise god isn't that striking isn't that amazing to us the same god in the old testament who said if you're in my land and you don't live right you're getting bodily uh diseases you're getting sickness all these things until you die the same god in the new testament says if you don't live in the holy ghost promised land the right way you'll die as well and many how many how many died in that corinthian church did he say a few or many he said many let's read it first corinthians 11 29 and 30. first corinthians 11 29 30. and i'm going to skip ahead to the slide where brother graham says that so you can see it some people might say oh that's not the message brother jesse oh yeah it is yeah it is you just haven't studied it far enough i didn't study it either until her lately program calls it a curse so we'll get to that in just a moment but let's read 20 when i say 29 30 11. yeah we can read 28. but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body that's the church the saints for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep look at that many corinthian saints died because they didn't treat the saints right now remember what they have they had sleeping with their mother-in-laws they had getting drunk at the lord's table can you imagine well brother brother bang this encourages me so much we've got to be a book of acts church because we don't have anybody getting drunk at the lord's table except with the holy ghost hallelujah amen look at this we don't have anybody sleeping around the church whatever these i've heard of churches that do thank god god spared us right but look at this to me this just proves we are part of the book of acts church we're not seeing as much as we like but we are we're living higher than they lived amen that corinthian church i'm talking about praise god look who brother brahm says what are you you're a christian you live before everybody as a christian and if you take that and don't live as a christian you're not discerning the lord's body you're putting a stumbling block in somebody else's way see as they ch as they see you trying to do that and then not living what you're supposed to live so you're not in a certain lower body now watch what the curse of it is and then he reads the scripture your brother and believe there was curse in the new testament yes yes he did right [Music] and there's numerous numerous scriptures on this let me show you one real quick if i can just find this there was one that was a real special one i went to well i'm sorry just didn't say special but it's just so simple so i got lots of preach here i just uh i got to try to follow the leading of the lord here there's one that was really yeah here it is this is what i want to show you church there's really a curse for or in other words a punishment for every time we disobey god's word in other words the punishment it's not like a curse like oh i'm cursed forever right we talked about it in the first service on this series there's permanent curses like cain the serpent right the cursed children the sinners but then there's temporary curses like what paul said said many are weak and sickly among you because they don't discern the lord's body i don't know about church after service make sure you're treating everybody real good praise god you want god's blessing to continue you smile adam you treat him real good you know you listen see if you can help them out and then and then do it tomorrow too praise god treat god's speech because that's amen that's god with skin on praise god amen you know there's bang has a gene from god's mind a peace of god is in him praise god and how i treat him is how i treat jesus christ if he was here amen praise god so he said if you don't discern the i'm trying not to preach hard to with my voice he said if you don't discern the lord's body it brings a curse and many people in the corinthian church couldn't even treat their fellow christians with dignity and respect and they live any kind of life they go there get drunk at the lord's table and leave and paul said many die because of it thank god we got the holy ghost that's all i can say praise god i've never been part of one church that had drunk people at the lord's table i'd like to ask beatrice about that she's been the message a long long time maybe brother jose too had they ever seen such debauchery but paul saw it paul had to deal with it how many how many of you like to clean that mess up at the church i wouldn't i'm thankful we got a holy church here praise god i'm thankful we don't have those issues to clean up i thank the lord jesus christ for that now here so he says let's read it now the natural first bride of the human race before her husband come to her she fell from grace by listening to satan's lie after god had her forfeit fortified behind his word if she'd have stayed behind the word she'd have never fell now that's in the natural notice the natural and what's the curse the actual curse of coming out from behind god's word so see the word of god is a shield right faith right the word of god is a sword but brother man says if you put those armor pieces down and you try to fight and serve god or live without god's protection you come out from behind the word and you're cursed automatically in other words you disobey god's word it's going to bring a punishment upon your life right one of those they listed sickness we didn't even get to the mental ones there's like there's mental problems in deuteronomy 28 people no doubt that's why people go crazy around the message because they disobey god somewhere down the line and they fail to listen to the holy spirit and they fail to be like david i'm the one who's greatly sinned forgive me lord and restore me forgive me of my iniquity see they're too prideful to admit they made the mistake god help us to be humble and admit when we make mistakes and then see god restore us back into fellowship amen amen because you and i for honest we do it every week praise god right we fall short oh why'd i do that i didn't like my testimony there at school or i didn't like my testimony there my with my home god forgive me i was wrong but lord restore me and lord help me to wake up and when i see my family to be able to show the love of christ to them or when i go to work help me to show the love of christ never when i go to school to show the love of christ let me be ready to produce a better because i'm the one that sinned i'm the one that did wrong i knew better i was walking in iniquity remember church let's not get on our high horses let's remember some of the things brother branham did yet he had the holy ghost he lied to the irs uh he said god you owe me an understanding when that woman died after uh she had drowned and got brought back to life and god said the brother man said god like pulled down a black sheet and wouldn't talk to him for two weeks he said don't ever demand something from god right the angel told him don't you make a show of this of the second poll and brother man the angel said you did and you made a public show of it and you caused all these imitations remember the angel lord told brother man then he said because you tried to describe the gift in your hand then you tried to describe the discernment he said because you tried to describe spiritual things you have people up on the platform pretending to sniff devils remember brother man said they'd have a broom and say shoe devil shoe devil i smell devil or sweep a devil out the angel said brother branham calls that so let's not make brother graham out to be god he's not god he's a man he was saved by god he was god's servant he was a faithful servant he made mistakes he fell short but then he was wrong like paul did praise god he said thank you to god who gives us the victory through the lord jesus christ amen god gave the prophet victory brother man he'll give us victory amen that's right some people think i'm harsh on brother i'm not i'm just i'm just trying to get it to us that god gave him grace god will give us grace in other words you can have the holy ghost and do something just you're totally ashamed of but yet god will invite you back if you'll repent and say sorry praise god you can never lose if you're if you've got the holy ghost you'll never lose the seal to the day of your day you'll never lose that seal but you'll lose his favor you lose his blessings now let me go back here it's already 12. let me set timer here i don't want to go too long okay so let's go back okay so we went back here let's uh find the next few thoughts i'd like to deliver here do you enjoy the blessings of god on your life hallelujah hallelujah i'm so thankful for the blessings of god um so i just i just thought you'd want to see that church isn't that isn't that special we are in a spiritual promised land but many of these same punishments apply if we don't obey the word of god but all the blessings apply if we do oh i love it church isn't that beautiful that's a this is to me this is fresh revelation praise god it's it's so fresh and it applies directly to our lives right now okay then i want to bring this out you know this minister unless he was a pentecostal preacher he passed on but he dealt a lot with blessings and curses he said a lot of these are from curses mental breakdowns chronic sicknesses especially if they're hesitary also when doctors cannot find a cause to sickness female trouble barrenness miscarriage tendency divorces and family breakups financial insufficiency accident prone suicide and unnatural death tendencies he just noticed in his decades-long ministry 50 years of ministry many of these are caused by curses which means people need to repent of something from their past and they haven't dealt with something from their past and because they know better they should have god is spanking them which we saw god carries a stick doesn't he remember hebrews chapter 12 the rod any son that he doesn't chasten that means smite with the rod is not a son of god so see god has to allow some of our brothers and saints in the message to get some of these things if they won't honor god and respect god that's true that's in deuteronomy 28. now let's read this one this is a beautiful one uh zechariah 5 if you got it let's go there i want to i just want to take time to get some of these i think they'll be a help to you remember chapter four was the vision of the candlesticks with the two prophets right not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord and we all know that's where the bible shows that oil represents the holy ghost amen right so that's a scripture we use to understand new testament things like the parable of the ten virgins what's that oil represent the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit of god so if we can gain that from zechariah 4 what can we gain from zechariah 5. we can gain a lot and we can gain a lot about blessings and curses and the condition of your home the literal place where you lay your head i don't start thinking about the pillow because you're gonna fall asleep right think about your home i love my home let's not fall asleep yet okay zechariah five verse one now look at this then i turned and lifted up my eyes and looked and behold a flying roll now the flying represents swiftness and this is what we see we can see like preachers now especially preachers because they're in the public eye right they're the parts of the body that everybody sees but god remember god said that's not the part i give the most honor to and the church said amen the part of the body everybody sees that's not what god gives the most honor to it's the unseen parts the laity i appreciate it a while ago now notice the flying represents swiftness uh yeah let me read verse two sorry i forgot my thought i was over there i went to something else i forgot my thought a flying roll and he said to me what see us thou and i answered i see a flying roll the length thereof is 20 cubits and the breath thereof 10 cubits then he said to me this is the curse so this flying rose what it's a curse this flying book or scroll is a curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth for everyone that stealth shall be cut off as on this side according to it and everyone that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it so see when people lie when people steal or when they sin in general god has a flying role god has a judgment a written judgment against people how many people got these bibles laying in their homes brother almost every american right owns the bible i say almost but a large majority of americans own a bible and god likens curses to flying rolls that fly into people's houses and look what it does to their home watch what it does to their home life in other words what i'm trying to say is we should have and i've been on this for a while off and on but we should have such godly homes where the angels of god could visit us should they need to visit us i'll say like this if there's one place where we can have peace it should be the home now the more children you get the harder it is just take my word for it so what i mean sometimes on saturday i got to come to the church and study here if not i'll get sweet little children coming up and that interrupted me every couple of minutes you know which i don't mind that it's hard to get any studying done when you got that going on uh but it's a it should be a place of peace and rest in other words your home should be like the church it should be calm and sweet and peaceful and you should feel the presence of god there amen and guess who's taking care of it dad and mom who's whose job is it to be the deacons at the house at the house yeah is that it's that fifth gospel preacher that gospel mom and that preacher dad right that leader the priest of the home it's his their jobs their jobs to keep the church clean sometimes you gotta get out that whip right brother vane the cord not too much yet but sometimes you got to get that out to keep the house clean and in reverence for the lord uh verse four and i will bring it forth who's gonna send that scroll god god sayeth the lord of hosts and it shall enter into the house of the thief did you know this quote brother brahm said i never did steal anything in my life you know he said this except i stole god's time he said and he talked about when he was a sinner instead of being at the church he said when i was a sinner i was out washing my ford he said i stole god's time now what about us when when we feel the leading of the lord and we should be studying in our homes or praying more but then we go off into worldly pleasures or something like that understand what i'm saying we still got that's that's our time to reconnect with jesus right and we got to make sure we don't steal that away right that hinders our walk with god how we know that enters our walk with god if we don't take that time and give that time to jesus to to love him and worship him and then he gives his love back to us we've stolen from him we've stolen from him because nothing is more important than what time time nothing is more important than time so he said redeem it redeem the time because these days are evil he said verse finishing verse 4 and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that swear falsely by my name oh my we just had that happen and it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones there people wonder why is my family falling apart why is my home falling apart i would check your words i would check what you've taken with your hands i would check how you're spending your time god said he's going to send it brother god said i'm going to send that role in there it's a curse it's a written it's a written word of a curse because they've stolen they've spoken wrong in the name of the lord and their house is gonna crumble right that's why i thought it was so important church so we can represent that now what did it say yeah did you catch that it went over the whole earth so that has to be gentiles he said this role is going to go over the whole earth people's lives fall apart homes relationships crumble down because of curses not diligently obeying the word of god in church i think we all understand some of the hardest words to say is i'm sorry it's my fault those five words blame it on somebody else don't talk about ignore it but that's true i'm sorry it's my fault david could do that and god honored him so see when we see homes and families consumed with destruction consumed with with uh broken relationships consumed by sin there is a cause remember we showed that scripture there's a cause for every curse there's a cause god don't send it without cause and if it comes and if a trouble happens and you can't find the cause then you know the cause is for god's glory amen like job amen hallelujah you know it's for god's glory he's trying to humble you down and break you down so you depend on him more so you can be strong in his strength when you're weak then you're strong in christ he's trying to break you down to get you to build you up with more trust more obedience more diligence in the things of god hallelujah thank you jesus okay now what did i do just a moment i think okay yeah i want to close with this now i say close 17 minutes give me 17 minutes because i do want to close with this i do by god's grace um so when i started looking up brother braham quotes with the word curse the most i found that i've found so far haven't gone through all of them the most i've found are with balaam trying to curse israel israel which we're all very familiar with that but i thought we'd review it again and just see some of these uh beautiful words and promises in the scripture and i think it'll help us by the grace of the lord you know cam and i were talking about it and cam actually pointed me to this chapter uh while we were there at my mom's 70th party that's where i got covered uh at least i got some good nuggets out of it too my mother man just let you know buddy you really inspired me i was when i was laying there on that first day i was so tired but i kept saying this is lying vanities this is lying vanities i didn't feel a miracle but i did feel he i felt healed about two and a half days later but that so inspired me i just kept saying it's a lie you know cause i was basically all by myself laying in the room you know i couldn't get comfortable one way or the other you know um but that really inspired me uh because of the testimony with his dad just call it lying vanities lying vanities and here i am back in the house of god amen thank the lord it's it's a lie from the from from hell thank god for his grace so let's look at balak's desire to curse israel now and he took his parable and said baalik the king of moab has brought me from aram out of the mountains of the east saying come curse me jacob and come defy israel see people that are against us they want god to be angry with us or they want god to hate us you can see it with a lot of this political thing right that's just minor look how much they hate people that are conservative right they so i said baelix a modern-day democrat if i could say that not all democrats i should say uh maybe modern-day antifa or matter modern-day violent black lives matter person because it they want they look at a godly group and they hate them and they want god they want judgment on them instead of blessing remember we're supposed to bless those who curse us right but here we have them we have the the violent uh sinful side moabites right trying to curse god's people he said come curse me jacob come defy israel and balaam says how shall i curse whom god is not cursed or how shall i defy whom the lord hath not defied i'd say he's a false prophet but he had a lot of wisdom in this case for from the tops of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him and lo the people shall dwell alone now brother baby says see that proves they weren't a denomination this church didn't live with anybody else they stayed separated to themselves praise god i remember this years ago john or john i don't know if you went but john graham and i and our families went to this pentecostal church on a new year's eve we met with them and they liked some of our sermons online and i said well brother i said why are you in the pentecostal denomination and he said we're in here we don't like the organization but we're in here for fellowship and i tried to tell him i said organizations are not of god but he just kind of went on and we lost our friendship uh we lost our relationship but just kind of went off but see part of being a real believer is being alone right we don't want to mix with those churches because we're going to mix and get some bad ideas from them they're going to rub us the wrong way right and so there's part of us we don't like to be alone but we have to be alone and then when we're here we're really not alone because jesus is with us and we have the saints here praise god amen so it's like we're alone from them but we got plenty of fellowship with god and his people he said and shall not be reckoned among the nations god purposely said don't you go mix back in with those nations you stay separate you stay alone so say see being alone is a good thing as long as jesus is with you it's a good thing praise god amen he said who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the righteous look at this mercy and let my last and be like his look at balaam look at this church he had a desire to be saved he was lost right we know he's lost because ii peter 3 he says that but he had a desire when he looked at god's people he said who ca look how look at them he said let me die the death of the righteous lest my last and be like his so see people see people want to be like you a lot of churches want to be like you but guess what a few months later what happened he got that money temptation right he went off uh to the feast of bao pior and he got 24 000 men to commit fornication and they died before the lord 24 000. so look at this look how people are so close he was so close to being saved but then he must have because of the money he must have crossed the line between mercy and judgment uh how many people i mean how many times have you heard such a holy statement is that let me die the death of the righteous in other words let me die like a holy man let me give my life for jesus christ in other words that be for us look at those words we see how money can take us away from our pure desires money just more money takes us away from wanting to die let me die like a saint to ah maybe i'll trick him into uh committing sin so i can get some more money in my pocket i can be a rich man and uh remember the the sinners want to be like you because remember even pharaoh he said take your flocks and your herds and he said bless me also but you know he wasn't gonna be blessed see sinners they know you're living right thank god amen you are a city on a hill that cannot be hidden praise god and they know you live a godly life they know you live a righteous life and they want to be like you but they can't be like you because they surrender to the lust of the flesh the pride of life and lust of the eyes but even pharaoh said bless me with some of that blessing no the only way to get that is to obey god's word amen you want god's blessing you've got to come god's provided away amen pharaoh you want god's blessing you better go get the passover lamb hallelujah praise god amen you better obey the prophet's message you want the you want the prophet's blessing you better obey the prophet's message in the word see one of god's blessing we don't want to meet god's conditions see it's just simple obedience it all comes down to i like that quote from the preacher uh his name's derek prince he says really you don't need to chase the blessings amen hallelujah what you need to do is meet the conditions god takes care of the blessings amen i don't know church i must be in a financial season where god's blessing me financially i had a brother calling me up from illinois yesterday brother bank he's like for five years i'm enjoying your videos he said i'm sending you 500 to support your ministry i don't know it just seems like remember i got a i got two checks in the mail lately three four checks in the mail just uh there's this money coming i must need it for something probably like the bob said i'll probably fly away pretty soon right brother bang but it's just like it's just coming so there must be a purpose for it but see we don't have to worry about the blessings worry about the word of god amen can be concerned about your relationship your sensitivity to the holy spirit and then god will take care of the blessings i'll say like this in that fellowship of amen you'll find the blessing that's a greater blessing than money praise god that fellowship that peace that passes our understanding that's more of a blessing than the money praise god amen hallelujah or whatever desire car house clothes whatever you need whatever you need the the fellowship with christ is much greater than those other extra blessings i'd rather have a church brother bank where i don't have to deal with people sleeping around getting drunk at communion can you imagine that you imagine i walked in here drunk i like to serve the lord's the lord's supper but i'm stumbling around because i was drinking the wine in there before the service what who could who could have any confidence in god who could have any peace in their heart i think it's so special that we have god's love here don't you think so yeah that we have a real love for god a real obedience to god a desire to serve him and pleasing to diligently obey the word of god i think that's such a treasure it really is now he continues the lord met balaam put a word in his mouth gogin to balak say thus and he took the parable rise up balak and here hearken unto me thou son of the poor god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent he has said and shall he not do it or have he spoken and shall not he make it good amen behold i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed it and i cannot reverse it amen amen look at this he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob why brother tells us because of the lamb because of the blood praise god god doesn't behold our our purposeful sins because of a sacrifice neither have he seen perverseness in israel yet i can show you the scripture i can show you the 10 times where israel complained against god and god said because of these 10 times you're not going to promise land that's actually before this but yet over as a whole god looked at the group overall he says i haven't beheld it i haven't seen it he says because the blood the lord his god is with him and the shout of joy of a king is among them so this is what god tells balaam to tell baalik he was a man calls him an old intellectual church member who didn't believe in shouting and praising god he said tell them that god doesn't see their iniquity god doesn't see their sin because they're forgiven he said and they have the shout of joy in their camp that's what this message is that's what this message produces it produces happiness it produces joy it produces victory blessings and it keeps us from the curses and it makes us want to praise god more oh hallelujah thank you jesus it produces joy in their lives and god says that's one of the proofs that i'm with these people because they have a shout of joy among them praise god so you're all used to it now i just scream and shout all the time during song service right you know i do that because i got the shot of the king in the camp praise god i'm living in victory now if i was living in my sins or living in curses that'd be different i probably feel a lot different but when i when i please god love god and obey god and repent and all these things and i come to church i hear him sing about knowing god more praising god he's the king of my heart what else can i do let's shout and say thank you you are the king of my heart praise god you are the king of my life jesus christ is my king amen how can i not praise him how can i not lift my voice and wear it out for his glory god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn now look the joy of the lord is your strength according to nehemiah so look how it's connected you want to be strong in the lord get happy about what jesus did get happy jesus died for your sins get happy jesus sent your sins away praise god get happy he sent the holy ghost ready get happy realize what we got praise god amen the joy of the lord why can't i be stronger at work why can't i be stronger my family we need the joy of the lord we need a shout we got to shout to god and praise god and recognize what he's done he's brought us out of egypt i was one of those brother johnny that the holy spirit said come out of babylon come on in my come out of her my people come out of the assemblies of god that shall be not a partaker of her sins and pledge and i'll receive you saith the lord praise god i was one of those that heard it praise god i came out and i'm glad i did and i ain't going back i'm here to stay i'm out here all alone here to stay with god and his blessings hallelujah thank you jesus i'll keep shouting for jesus praise god not for denomination not for a creed but for the word of god for jesus christ the living god so if you're weak you better start praising god he inhabits the praises not the complaints he habits the praises of his people amen right the praises and in that praise his presence comes in his presence is the fullness of joy the fullness of strength see they were peculiar so are we and we have treasure and earth and vessels remember the bible said if you will obey my voice and keep my covenant you'll be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for the earth is all the earth is mine now it sounds like israel's god's favorite or dearly beloved she was by god's foreknowledge god espoused israel or engaged israel to himself in ezekiel 16 verse 8. so see israel was his treasure i preached on that on wednesday night now look look look how look how david builds up to the treasure praise the lord ye the lord praise you the name of the lord praise him o ye servants of god three times he's gotta say praise him praise him praise him either stand in the house of the lord and the courts of the house of god praise the lord sometimes church i'm convinced maybe some of us are singing but we're not praising are you with me and i'm guilty too when i you know i have battles and things like that we're all guilty but i don't want to just sing i want to praise him amen praise him and praise and say thank you jesus i said hi you're the king of my heart you're you're you're my own all you're my king and my god my my lord praise him praise the lord for he is good sing praises unto his name for it's pleasant why don't you feel pleasant at home it's time to sing praises to him that's what the bible says this is where the certain sister from don south keeps texting me same thing pray for me perfect i'm discouraged i'm depressed i said praise him praise him bob says praise him and don't say it one time keep saying over and over to the real praises start flowing from your soul for the lord so why should we praise him four for this for the lord have chosen bang unto himself and bride of christ fellowship for his peculiar treasure [Music] oh you don't think that applies to man it does apply to ben peter says it applies to vain he says you which believe in jesus are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation ah peculiar so let's go back and put your name in it as well as banks for the lord have chosen amen i can use these brothers because i kind of pick on them a little bit but they know i love them right guys i never hurt you in any way but lord i've chosen malachi unto himself i can pick on my kids too but the guy that chosen jose unto himself and israel for his special treasure why because you believe in his son you believe and he is precious to you see church there was a time when we were not a people but now we are god's people like i was saying to vayne he's born again he has a if he if he's got god's life there then that life is a part of god and so he's a person of god he's of the family the body of jesus christ i must treat him with utmost respect which had not obtained mercy but now we have mercy how much time i got like i got two minutes okay so maybe everything i'm enjoying this are you enjoying this i can see how i'm blessed to be god by god's grace i can see the blessings of god and that's why i want to remain church amen i don't want to leave the land i want to stay right here i want to stay right in the blessings of god almighty for we don't preach ourselves but jesus christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who command the light to shine out of darkness has shined where in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us so what power do you have god himself i have god's treasure in my life it's not my power it's his power it's his treasure it's his spirit praise god no wonder the bible said they were a peculiar treasure because now we are the treasure because we have god's life inside of our souls can you see that israel was a treasure but now we're a peculiar treasure unto god because we allow god's spirit to reign over our lives in church we're troubled on every side yet not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair we're persecuted but not forsaken this is the scripture right after that the previous one cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body i'm skipping that last verse see our lives are a paradox it's this holy spirit against the flesh and we always show christ his life and his death when we take up our cross we show his death so see church possessing god's treasure keeps your troubles from distressing you why aren't you distressed brother jesse what you had covered why aren't you distressed because i've got god's treasure in my heart you're you have perplexities but they don't cause you despair because you've still got treasure you have persecutions people say all kinds of things about you but i don't feel forsaken so i've got god's treasure i fall sometimes but i'm not destroyed because i've got god's treasure in my heart that's what the scripture says that's the whole point that's the passage we have we have all these trials but we've still got god's treasure so in other words we can live with it and we can overcome it by god's grace that's the anorphy now as we're standing let me read this amen there is no curse against you okay we're gonna get to this lord willing maybe tonight jezebel sister now we tried to curse elijah he's like she's like i'm gonna kill him by the end of the day but did that happen did that curse work didn't work at all elijah went out there found a little juniper tree and god said send the angels with the softest hands up there and go give him food that he's gonna live off of for 40 days see people can try to curse you all they all they want but it ain't gonna work because you're under the blood of jesus christ you're under the blessings of god let them say whatever they want they curse you you bless them because maybe in the blessing they'll humble themselves and receive christ brother amen and brother bang there's no divination against you nobody can try to work up some type of a curse to try to curse you according at this time it should be said of jacob in israel what hath god wrought see this is what bana was telling the the king bala he said look you can't curse them you can't put anything on them they can do all the enchantments they want you can't curse them because they are god's workmanship now i couldn't make one of these but if this was god's workmanship he just make sure it's smooth and you know it worked and all the buttons work right he said you can't curse that because that is in god's hands god is currently working that how many are in god's nail scarred hands tonight i'm sorry this morning i think it's wednesday night oh that would be the greatest best thing we could have is to be in his hands he's working on him we've seen that song he's still working on me well then good thank god he is right because then you can't be cursed because you're in the hands of god amen he's working on you right now you are wrought you're made of god you're handcrafted by the nail scarred hands well i better stop yep remember the bible said where is workmanship musicians if you come i just better stop right there i'll just keep going what five minutes over so forgive me church sorry about that do god's blessings mean more to you now praise god praise god that was my desire that god would as i prayed this morning god feed your sheep and as i minister this that's our that's my prayer lord help us to appreciate your blessings and remain right there let's just bow our heads for a moment i'm going to say lord i want to be diligent to hearken to all your commands lord i know you're going to exalt me spiritually i'll live a higher i'll live a high calling in christ you're gonna bless my spiritual reproduction my natural reproduction i'm gonna be victorious i'm gonna be the head and not the tail i'm gonna be above and not below let's pray together father in heaven you see the hands you see our hearts that are raised as well lord father we want to see a pattern of blessing in our life we want to see patterns of victory [Music] let them freely choose to obey more and more lord help us to stay in the land let us meet the conditions and lord i pray this when we're wrong when i sin when we purposely sin the church forgive us help us [Music] thank you i just want to thank your lord for this church [Music] god [Music] but lord we desire more desire to diligently hearken each day

joy [Applause] say thank thank you [Applause] [Music] everyone let's sing a song together is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hello [Music] yes [Music] so there's a song he wrote by the holy spirit a few years ago it's just it's called it's just who you are i don't know if we have it it's okay if we don't but the whole point i'm saying that is because the song says i love you not because of what you've done but because of who you are in other words i don't serve you just for the blessings i serve you because you're god amen because of your godly character do we have that it's just who you are i'll look for it later but i just that just came to my mind i'm preaching on the blessings and we're thankful for the blessings but there's greater than that it's the person of jesus christ amen it's knowing him praise god amen and knowing him in his power his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings oh to think that the god of heaven would fellowship with me praise god the god of heaven would fellowship with you we should be so grateful for that praise god so great are you grateful today that god wants to fellowship with you praise god hallelujah your presence is [Music] [Music] so [Music] what [Music] oh [Music] [Music] all my days [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] blue [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] me [Music] [Music] so [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is my righteousness [Music] is [Music] me [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] me [Music] is [Applause] me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music]
