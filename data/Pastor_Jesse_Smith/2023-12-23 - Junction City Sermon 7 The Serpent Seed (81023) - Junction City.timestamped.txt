[0:00] so last time we looked at anointed ones
[0:02] at the end times and hopefully that was
[0:03] a blessing brother irin said you heard a
[0:05] very similar sermon from Brother Kyle
[0:07] that's wonderful it's nice how the Holy
[0:09] Spirit gave a second witness to that I
[0:11] like that that wasn't planned except by
[0:13] God hallelujah I had no part in that but
[0:16] I'd like to uh look at the seed of the
[0:18] serpent of course this is the um brother
[0:21] brandham calls it this is the
[0:24] killer so this is the doctrine that will
[0:26] sometimes kill fellowship with other
[0:28] people will not want to fellowship with
[0:31] you anymore if you believe this I just
[0:34] heard him say it today it's from
[0:36] 1961 um and it's because people aren't
[0:39] very spiritual and they um they don't
[0:42] want to dig deep into the deeper truths
[0:44] of God and people will disfellowship
[0:47] with you you know if you believe uh
[0:49] certain things and this of course um
[0:52] this of course the truth of this upsets
[0:54] the LIE coming out of most churches most
[0:56] churches say Eve went over took a bite
[0:58] of Apple and then she covered herself
[1:01] you know well that's not in the Bible
[1:04] the Bible says that she partook of the
[1:06] fruit but we're not told what fruit it
[1:07] was the Bible didn't say it was an
[1:09] apple and then she gave whatever fruit
[1:12] she partook of she gave it to her
[1:13] husband and they covered their private
[1:15] parts right so whatever they partook of
[1:19] caused them to know they were naked and
[1:22] of course eating an apple doesn't cause
[1:24] anyone to realize the shame of their
[1:26] nakedness if it did let's pass out the
[1:28] apples let's go down to the beaches and
[1:30] passed out out the apples praise God
[1:32] like that's a joke brother Bradon made
[1:34] let's pass out the apples if it does
[1:36] that way these men and women can put
[1:38] some clothes on right because they walk
[1:40] around 3/4 or four fifths naked right uh
[1:44] it's a shame of
[1:46] course but uh we want to uh look at this
[1:49] here and um teach it I'll try to I I
[1:52] want to try to shorten it a little bit I
[1:54] got a uh got a of course a long drive
[1:57] home tonight but then I have a a wedding
[1:58] rehearsal tomorrow and a wedding to
[2:00] preach on Saturday so I got to preach
[2:02] twice on Sunday so I got a busy weekend
[2:04] coming up here uh but it's wonderful you
[2:06] know before I marry people we have to do
[2:09] uh six or seven counseling sessions I
[2:11] make sure I teach them as much as I can
[2:12] about marriage I will not marry a person
[2:15] unless they go to my church and they sit
[2:17] through me kind of lecturing them on six
[2:20] lessons if you want me to marry you you
[2:22] better be prepared to be married praise
[2:24] God because I'm not going to marry
[2:26] somebody unless they really know what
[2:27] it's all about by God's grace but this
[2:30] couple's a lovely couple you might
[2:32] remember Austin and Le I don't know if
[2:33] you remember them or not but um that's
[2:35] the brother who left the message for
[2:37] five years came back God delivered him
[2:39] from drug addiction alcohol addiction
[2:42] you name it addiction um and now he
[2:45] sings for Jesus and he's really a
[2:47] faithful servant there at the church uh
[2:50] he's a wonderful brother now this
[2:53] serpent seed also explains why sexual
[2:55] sin is so prevalent in it's always been
[2:58] not just today it's always always been
[3:00] that way right Jesus said as it was in
[3:02] the days of Sodom and lot so shall it be
[3:04] in the days of the son of man right so
[3:07] the same sins the days of Noah's uh and
[3:10] the days of Sodom with Abraham and lot
[3:13] the same sins are prevalent today it's
[3:16] because sexual sin was the first sin the
[3:19] actual physical sin committed in the
[3:23] Bible now if you want to get real deep
[3:26] the first spiritual sin was just
[3:27] disbelieving God's word it was Eve dis
[3:29] believing God's word that was the that
[3:32] was the first spiritual sin but then the
[3:34] first physical sin or the the fruit that
[3:37] was partaken of of course was adultery
[3:40] that was the first sin in the Bible now
[3:43] if you want to go even further than that
[3:44] the first sin ever was in heaven when
[3:46] Lucifer tried to exalt himself above God
[3:50] right and he deceived a third of the
[3:52] Angels the Bible said with his tail he
[3:54] drew a third of the angels to follow him
[3:56] talk about a church split uh the chch
[3:59] the first Church split was in heaven
[4:01] Satan of course split the church but uh
[4:05] we can see here uh the serpent seed we
[4:07] read our
[4:09] text um the Bible says that sin came
[4:12] into the world through
[4:14] lust okay so any of us would look at an
[4:16] apple and you know even if we're really
[4:18] hungry wouldn't we wouldn't lust after
[4:20] an apple right uh let's read that second
[4:23] Peter uh 1
[4:25] verse4 2 Peter 1
[4:28] verse4 a lot of people don't realize
[4:31] this it was a great uh Revelation to
[4:36] me it says whereby are given unto us
[4:39] exceeding great and precious promises
[4:41] that by these you might be partakers of
[4:43] the divine
[4:45] nature having escaped the corruption
[4:47] that is in the world through lust so
[4:51] corruption came into the world through
[4:53] lust that means the first sin that was
[4:56] committed came through lust right and
[4:59] lust is a forbidden
[5:01] craving okay so Eve had to had given
[5:05] into the first lust the first craving
[5:09] forbidden craving and of course it was
[5:12] adultery now I want you to also go let's
[5:14] go to uh 1 Timothy Chapter 2 since this
[5:17] thought just come to my mind
[5:19] here 1 Timothy
[5:25] 2 actually let's go to verse 12 1
[5:27] Timothy
[5:28] 2:12 so Eve lusted after the fruit but
[5:33] we know it wasn't an apple because the
[5:35] Bible doesn't say an apple and an apple
[5:37] doesn't produce the same effects
[5:40] today 1 Timothy 2:12 but I suffer not a
[5:44] woman to teach nor a serp authority over
[5:46] the man but to be in silence that's why
[5:48] a woman will never come to the pulpit
[5:50] and preach to men right in a real Church
[5:53] why because of what Eve did verse 13 for
[5:56] Adam was formed or first formed then Eve
[5:58] and Adam was was not deceived but the
[6:00] woman being deceived was in the
[6:03] transgression so Eve was deceived into
[6:07] lusting after the forbidden fruit she
[6:09] was deceived into it but Adam wasn't
[6:12] when Adam partook of the fruit he knew
[6:14] exactly what he was
[6:16] doing okay U now verse 13 of course
[6:20] notwithstanding she shall be saved in
[6:22] childbearing if they continue in faith
[6:23] and charity and Holiness and sobriety
[6:25] now some people misunderstand that verse
[6:27] they think I'm only saved if I have
[6:29] children and that's a
[6:30] misunderstanding of the
[6:32] scripture okay but we know that uh her
[6:37] her salvation of course comes by grace
[6:39] through faith and then she must keep a
[6:41] Godly condition of a woman she must keep
[6:43] The Godly requirements of a woman in
[6:45] other words praise God doesn't mean a
[6:47] woman is saved by having children that
[6:49] that would be a false Doctrine because
[6:52] the Bible said we're saved by grace
[6:53] through faith not of our works but it's
[6:56] a gift of God hallelujah how many
[6:58] thankful for that gift today
[7:01] Hallelujah just God just gives the gift
[7:03] out if you want salvation he gives you
[7:05] the gift I receive it praise God
[7:07] hallelujah I didn't earn it I just
[7:09] received it praise God now we see
[7:14] now sin comes in the world through lust
[7:18] and Eve was deceived into partaking of
[7:21] this
[7:22] fruit this of course fruit was
[7:26] adultery
[7:27] okay now
[7:30] notice uh as if you would uh remember
[7:33] back in Genesis 3:15 this was God
[7:35] speaking God said I will put hatred or
[7:38] enmity between thee The Serpent and the
[7:41] woman and between thy seed the Serpent's
[7:44] Seed and her seed Eve seed it shall
[7:47] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[7:49] his heel now the word seed means
[7:52] Offspring or descendants or children God
[7:55] said I'm going to put hatred between the
[7:57] Serpent's children and Eve's children
[8:00] children now how could somebody deny
[8:02] that praise God the serpent has children
[8:05] right Hallelujah and of course whose
[8:09] child was the serpent it was
[8:11] Cain Cain was the the son of The Serpent
[8:15] and Eve okay that's also uh plain in the
[8:20] scripture so let's read that since we
[8:22] got it let let's go to uh 1 John 4:12 I
[8:25] believe it is 1 John
[8:28] 4:12
[8:39] no that's that's the wrong verse
[8:43] here give me a
[8:46] second is it 312 thank you
[8:50] okay
[8:52] Hallelujah 1 John 312 brother John you
[8:55] want to read that when you get it
[8:55] brother 1 John 312 King who was of that
[8:58] Wicked one and LW his brother and
[9:00] wherefore slew he him because his own
[9:03] Works were evil and his brother's
[9:05] righteous amen praise God so the Bible
[9:08] plainly says Cain is of the wicked one
[9:11] now none of us are going to call Adam
[9:13] Wicked are we no he's a he's a he he
[9:16] sined right but he was a Son of God the
[9:18] Bible calls Adam the Son of God
[9:21] hallelujah so none of us would call Adam
[9:23] Wicked in fact Jesus calls Satan the
[9:25] wicked one three times in the Book of
[9:28] Matthew 13
[9:30] so here John by the Holy Spirit gets a
[9:32] revelation Cain was not of Adam Cain was
[9:36] of the wicked one
[9:38] Hallelujah all right so we've just laid
[9:40] a little bit of a groundwork there and
[9:43] notice God is the one who originates
[9:45] serpent seed you know some people are so
[9:46] surprised by that they they think where
[9:48] do you get serpent seed from um God how
[9:51] about God is that good enough for you
[9:54] God is the one who originated the
[9:56] serpent seed he said I'm going to put
[9:58] hatred between your seed Serpent and the
[10:02] woman's seed all
[10:04] right so it's God that originates this
[10:08] do this this teaching
[10:10] rather and uh let's now uh let's just go
[10:14] through these uh evidences in my book I
[10:16] wrote a book couple years ago I have a
[10:19] serpent seed section in there and
[10:20] there's nine
[10:21] evidences that this is a truth this is a
[10:24] true teaching and so hopefully tonight
[10:26] in the next uh 45 minutes or so you know
[10:28] by God Grace we can go through these uh
[10:31] these nine evidences
[10:35] okay and just so you know it is
[10:37] scientifically possible for a woman to
[10:40] conceive two twins by two different
[10:43] fathers okay it's called hetero super
[10:47] funication that's a big fancy word I can
[10:49] hardly say it sometimes hetero super
[10:53] funication and you can look it up it's
[10:54] in the journal forensic Sciences you can
[10:56] look it up in in any Journal
[11:00] um when a woman ovulates uh if she's
[11:02] with two men in a certain space of time
[11:05] she can get twins from two different men
[11:07] and there's many there's many many uh
[11:10] Val validated cases of that where the
[11:12] two children have two different DN right
[11:15] same mother different fathers that's
[11:17] exactly what Cain and Abel were uh same
[11:20] mother different fathers Cain's father
[11:23] was a serpent Abel's father was Adam all
[11:27] right that's
[11:30] true and uh before I forget if I don't
[11:33] get to it there's also articles that
[11:35] came out about 8 years ago in
[11:37] 2015 University of Georgia and other
[11:39] universities found that snakes have DNA
[11:42] that prove they once had arms and
[11:45] legs it's in their
[11:48] DNA and and these these these sinful
[11:51] scientists will say well see uh they
[11:53] evolved they used to have arms and legs
[11:54] and they evolved and now they don't need
[11:56] arms and legs but we know what it is
[11:59] they don't know what it is but we know
[12:00] what it is the serpent was an upright
[12:03] creature before that he got
[12:05] cursed and when God cursed him for what
[12:07] he did to Eve God took away his arms and
[12:10] legs and he said on your belly you'll go
[12:12] the rest of these days
[12:15] hallelujah God is true God's word is
[12:17] Right Hallelujah as time goes on God's
[12:20] word becomes more true in other words
[12:21] it's validated more and more praise God
[12:23] it's always true but it we get more
[12:25] proof and evidence that it is true
[12:27] praise God Amen
[12:29] hallelujah thank God I found that you
[12:31] know my children a few years ago we got
[12:33] National Geographic magazine and it
[12:35] opened it up and they said Daddy my son
[12:37] comes R me dad look it says snakes had
[12:39] legs and it has a picture of this
[12:41] cartoon snake and he's got you know his
[12:43] tongue sticking out and I'm like wow the
[12:45] National Geographic is preaching the
[12:46] message
[12:48] Hallelujah now they weren't really doing
[12:51] that but they got a revelation through
[12:54] science God left that evidence in the
[12:56] snake's DNA that's exactly right now the
[13:00] first evidence is the Bible supports the
[13:03] serpent seed teaching from Genesis to
[13:06] Revelation okay I just showed you
[13:08] Genesis where we learn of the serpent
[13:10] seed Jesus wrote about the serpent seed
[13:13] I'm sorry Jesus spoke of the serpent
[13:15] seed and it was recorded in Matthew
[13:17] Chapter 13 it's the
[13:20] parable of the four kinds of grounds
[13:23] right I'm sorry it's a parable of the
[13:24] wheat and the tears I'm sorry the
[13:27] parable of the wheat and the tears now I
[13:29] don't have time to read it so I'm just
[13:30] going to read what I wrote about it here
[13:33] Jesus describes the children of God as
[13:35] wheat seeds they're called Good
[13:37] Seed all right while the tears are
[13:40] called Children of the wicked
[13:42] one okay Jesus planted The Good Seed
[13:46] Satan planted The Bad Seed okay in the
[13:49] parable but notice it's one field with
[13:53] two Planters can everybody see that one
[13:56] field gets wheat one field gets tears
[13:58] our Farmers ought to be able to say Amen
[13:59] to that
[14:02] right and that's how it was in in the
[14:04] Garden of Eden Eve was the one
[14:07] field and the two sers the two seeds
[14:10] came from The Serpent and Adam one field
[14:14] two
[14:15] sers okay hope that's plain hopefully
[14:17] everybody can see that by God's
[14:21] grace and notice you have children of
[14:24] God but you have children of the devil
[14:26] as well
[14:29] so Jesus preached the serpent seed
[14:31] Hallelujah because Jesus was God's Spar
[14:34] Hallelujah I was going to preach on the
[14:36] godhead tonight too but I thought well I
[14:37] think I'll do serpent seed this be the
[14:39] last time I'm with you for this summer
[14:40] summer's coming to an end and I'm
[14:42] starting work in a couple weeks here um
[14:45] I thought I thought this would be
[14:46] important one to teach here now I do
[14:48] want everybody to read 2 Corinthians 11
[14:50] let's go to 2 Corinthians 11:2 you know
[14:52] when I first heard this church this blew
[14:55] me this blew my mind away I'd say it
[14:57] blew me out of the water you know you
[14:58] know I just I could not believe you know
[15:01] I I was raised in church for 19 years
[15:04] and then I I then I got saved and I was
[15:06] serving God for two years and I never
[15:08] saw a serpent seed until my brother
[15:10] showed it to me and of course he heard
[15:12] it from brother
[15:13] Brandon and if it just just just him
[15:16] pointing out these verses it felt like
[15:18] scales fell off my eyes like St Paul
[15:21] like how could I have not seen this
[15:23] before was I
[15:24] blind what was wrong with me well what
[15:27] was wrong with me I wasn't saved praise
[15:29] God hallelujah I was in one way I was
[15:31] blinded by the God of this evil world
[15:33] the Bible says Satan right once I became
[15:35] saved once I started trust in God and
[15:37] believing in God then God could reveal
[15:39] more and more to me he could and that's
[15:41] what he's doing with you you as well
[15:43] he's revealing more and more to you and
[15:45] I want God to re reveal more and more to
[15:47] me as I go on praise God I don't want it
[15:49] to stop praise God I want to keep going
[15:51] Hallelujah don't stop Jesus Keep
[15:53] revealing yourself to me praise God Amen
[15:56] Hallelujah Second Corinthians uh 11 2
[15:59] and
[16:00] three now Paul is comparing the church
[16:03] to Eve this church in
[16:05] Corinth and you know if you read your
[16:07] Bible they were not a perfect
[16:09] Church they had a lot of problems they
[16:12] were taking each other they were suing
[16:14] each other going to the
[16:15] judges the one man was sleeping with his
[16:18] stepmother it was just awful uh some
[16:20] people were trying to speak in tongues
[16:22] uh without any interpreters in the
[16:23] church and Paul's like got to stop
[16:25] that if you don't have an interpreter
[16:28] keep silent because it's just it's
[16:29] confusion
[16:31] right now he says for I am jealous over
[16:34] you with Godly jealousy for I have
[16:36] espoused you to one husband that I may
[16:38] present you as a Chase virgin to Christ
[16:40] so Paul says I'm jealous that you're
[16:42] turning away from the faith I'm jealous
[16:44] of you because I'm the one that preached
[16:45] and you got saved I was the one that
[16:48] preached the gospel and now you're
[16:49] turning away from my teaching he said
[16:52] but when when you got saved you were
[16:54] like a virgin to Christ I engag you to
[16:57] Jesus and he's like what happened well
[17:00] he tells us in the next
[17:01] verse but I fear lest by any means as
[17:04] the serpent begal Eve through his
[17:06] subtility so your mind should be
[17:08] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[17:12] Christ isn't that something Paul
[17:15] compares the Corinthians were virgins
[17:17] until Satan started working on their
[17:19] minds and he's saying they lost their
[17:21] virginity right just like who Eve he
[17:24] said it right there just like Eve in
[17:27] other words Satan did this same thing to
[17:29] the Corinthian Church that Satan did to
[17:32] Eve she was virgin but then he deceived
[17:34] her and what happened she lost her
[17:36] virginity now so I know some the these
[17:39] things are plain but it's the truth
[17:40] anyhow sometimes I got to be plain like
[17:42] this but it's still holy because these
[17:44] are Bible words I'm just pre I'm just
[17:46] saying what the Bible says praise God
[17:49] all right so Moses preached serpent seed
[17:52] or wrote about serpent seed God God did
[17:55] in Genesis Jesus did in Matthew Paul
[17:58] Paul mentioned serpent seed in 2
[18:01] Corinthians Peter oh yeah we already
[18:03] read second Peter chapter 1 Peter says
[18:05] sin came in the world through lust so
[18:07] Peter preaches serpent seed and then we
[18:10] already read uh 1 John 3:12 how Cain was
[18:13] of that Wicked one so
[18:15] John so look at this I got five
[18:18] preachers all preaching serpent seed do
[18:20] you think it sounds does it seem like
[18:21] it's pretty biblically accurate Saints
[18:24] of course everybody's writing about it
[18:27] the Bible never look up the word Apple
[18:28] in your concordance the Bible never says
[18:30] that they ate an apple right it never
[18:33] says that so we can't say what the Bible
[18:36] says we've got to say what the Bible
[18:38] says hallelujah we can we should only
[18:40] say what the Bible says praise
[18:42] God Amen now Cain was of that Wicked one
[18:46] Adam was not Wicked he was a Son of
[18:49] God Jesus calls Satan the wicked one in
[18:52] Matthew 13:19 and Matthew
[18:55] 13:38 and even John called Satan the
[18:58] wicked one three times in 1 John 2 13-
[19:03] 14 and 1 John 5:8 we're not we don't
[19:06] have time to read all
[19:07] these and church I'm not going to read
[19:09] this but Cain has a separate lineage
[19:11] from Abel how many know that God God has
[19:15] them record totally different lineages
[19:17] they're not even in the same lineage but
[19:18] they're Brothers why AR they're in the
[19:19] same lineage because they got different
[19:22] fathers right they have different
[19:25] fathers so uh we're not going to read it
[19:28] but Cain's genealogy is in Genesis
[19:31] 4 it's not the same as Abel's right and
[19:35] Abel of course he died but Seth took his
[19:38] place Seth's genealogy or Adam's
[19:40] genealogy is in Genesis
[19:42] 5
[19:44] Hallelujah so they have different
[19:47] genealogies God separates the children
[19:49] of the devil here and the children of
[19:51] God amen amen how many know the Bible
[19:55] calls Eve the mother of all living how
[19:56] many know that it's Genesis 3:20 does
[19:59] the bible ever call Adam the father of
[20:01] all living
[20:03] no brother brand brought that out no
[20:06] Adam is never called the father of all
[20:08] living cuz he's not he wasn't the father
[20:11] of
[20:11] Cain but Eve was the mother of all
[20:15] living
[20:17] Hallelujah these are all important uh
[20:20] Bible truths oh yeah and brother Iran I
[20:22] have three videos on this topic plus I
[20:25] wrote about in the book so if you want
[20:26] more on it there's there's there's a lot
[20:28] of on it by God's grace there's whole
[20:29] lot on it and brother Simon does a good
[20:31] job he can teach even deeper than I can
[20:33] on this topic he'll just bring out more
[20:34] and more scriptures
[20:38] Hallelujah and then remember in
[20:40] Revelation 12:9 let's read that
[20:42] Revelation
[20:44] 12:9 what nickname is Satan
[20:47] given anyone remember before you read it
[20:51] you can Shout It Out anyone you remember
[20:52] what's what what nickname is Satan
[20:54] given you remember it Sister Sarah
[20:58] Dragon yeah that old serpent that old
[21:00] Dragon yeah the old serpent yep dragon's
[21:02] right too good one he actually has four
[21:04] titles he has four nicknames in that
[21:06] scripture Genesis 129 very good
[21:11] sister and the Great Dragon that's right
[21:13] good sister Sarah yes the Great Dragon
[21:15] was cast out that old serpent called the
[21:17] devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[21:19] whole world so see he's called that old
[21:22] serpent because you know what happened
[21:24] Satan got in the serpent in the Garden
[21:26] of Eden he possessed that animal just
[21:29] like when those demons went into the
[21:31] swine in the days of Jesus right and ran
[21:34] them off the cliff remember
[21:35] that Satan can possess any living thing
[21:39] right and his demons can possess any
[21:40] living thing so Satan the Bible said he
[21:44] was in the garden of God the Bible says
[21:45] that plainly in uh ex Ezekiel 28 he was
[21:49] in the garden of God and then he
[21:51] possessed The Serpent and he he spoke
[21:54] through the serpent he deceived Eve
[21:56] through the serpent seduced her
[21:59] uh and then uh part they partook of the
[22:02] fruit of adultery and then he had a son
[22:05] the serpent had a son now it wasn't now
[22:07] let me get this clear too it wasn't
[22:09] Satan's son because Satan's not a man
[22:11] just be clear on that Satan's a spirit
[22:13] and Spirits don't have children and the
[22:15] church
[22:16] said so Cain wasn't Satan's son although
[22:21] Satan possessed the serpent to have him
[22:24] Cain was the Serpent's
[22:26] son all right is that is that is that
[22:29] clear Satan himself is a spirit he can't
[22:32] procreate with a woman because he's a
[22:35] spirit he can possess their bodies but
[22:37] he can't he can't uh he can't reproduce
[22:40] is the word I'm looking for is that
[22:42] clear all
[22:45] right so there there's there's a lot of
[22:47] Truth in here this is digging deep down
[22:49] the word of God this is not skin
[22:52] milk this is uh this is uh chewy meat
[22:55] this is real good organic meat right
[22:56] here by God's grace
[22:58] see it's organic there's nothing
[23:00] injected in here brother Howard so in
[23:02] other words same as God was manifested
[23:05] In the Flesh in Jesus Satan was
[23:08] manifested in the serpent beautiful
[23:11] beautiful he's got it yep good
[23:12] Revelation everybody
[23:14] yep both seeds that God talked about
[23:16] came apart from male
[23:19] instrumentality in other words uh uh
[23:21] from physical intercourse uh between a
[23:24] man right because it was serpent the
[23:26] serpent was not a man and the serpent uh
[23:30] he wasn't a he wasn't fully man the
[23:31] serpent laid with Eve and had Cain and
[23:35] the woman's seed who is the woman seed
[23:38] Christ and the Christ was conceived in
[23:41] Mary of the Holy
[23:43] Ghost right so Cain and Christ both did
[23:47] not have a Earthly human father right
[23:49] because the serpent was not fully
[23:52] human he was partially but not not
[23:55] fully okay that's very good brother very
[23:57] good
[23:58] good good thought it's good
[24:01] understanding that you got
[24:04] there now remember the Bible say Satan
[24:06] is the father of lies and he's a
[24:08] murderer from the beginning as John 8:44
[24:12] says okay so there's your first evidence
[24:15] the first evidence again is the serpent
[24:17] seed is taught Through the Bible from
[24:19] Genesis to
[24:20] Revelation Amen in Genesis it's Satan in
[24:23] the serpent in Revelation uh Satan is
[24:26] called that old serpent
[24:28] because he possessed that serpent from
[24:30] the
[24:31] beginning all right now the second proof
[24:34] is the two trees in the midst of the
[24:36] garden were not literal trees okay now
[24:40] there was a garden with natural trees
[24:42] like apple trees lemon trees you name
[24:44] all the good trees citrus trees but the
[24:46] Bible said there was two trees in the
[24:48] midst of the garden but they were not
[24:51] literal trees that those two trees were
[24:53] symbolic of the Holy Spirit or Jesus
[24:56] Spirit God's spirit
[24:58] and Satan's Spirit that's what those two
[25:00] trees represent and the proof of that is
[25:03] in Genesis 2:9 let's read Genesis
[25:09] 2:9 so the Bible is speaking here in
[25:12] Parables which Jesus said that's Jesus
[25:15] did that a lot of his teaching was
[25:16] through
[25:17] Parable I'm going to prove it to you at
[25:19] the end here I'll show I'll show it to
[25:22] you now look at verse n and out of the
[25:25] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[25:27] tree that is Pleasant to the sight and
[25:29] good for
[25:30] food look there's a semic in there the
[25:33] tree of life also in the midst of garden
[25:36] and the tree of knowledge of Good and
[25:39] Evil now notice they said the trees were
[25:41] good for food how many how how many
[25:43] recognize that every tree God planted
[25:46] was good for food but if e partook of
[25:49] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[25:50] was it good for food if she
[25:52] died
[25:54] no any tree that will kill you is not
[25:57] good for
[25:58] food is that
[26:00] right e partook of the tree of knowledge
[26:03] good and evil and it killed her so it
[26:06] wasn't good for food so that means that
[26:08] tree was not a literal tree it was a
[26:11] spirit right amen isn't Jesus don't we
[26:15] know Jesus is the Tree of Life didn't he
[26:17] say I am the way the truth and the
[26:22] life the Bible even calls him the branch
[26:24] of David
[26:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[26:28] there's many symbols of Jesus he's the
[26:30] rock he's the water he's the tree he's
[26:31] the branch I mean whatever whatever
[26:34] symbol he represents himself he said I'm
[26:36] the Mana praise God I'm the bread amen
[26:38] he he he said I'm the wheat seed
[26:40] whatever you have need of whatever we
[26:41] need that's what he is praise
[26:44] God and church yeah I'll get to this in
[26:46] a little bit yeah I'll just say it right
[26:50] now
[26:53] um the third evidence that's the second
[26:55] evidence any tree that will kill you is
[26:57] not good for food so the tree of
[26:58] knowledge of good evil was not like all
[27:00] the other trees in the garden it was not
[27:02] good for food that means it wasn't a a
[27:04] natural tree it was a symbolic tree it
[27:07] was the spirit of
[27:09] Satan now the third proof is that the
[27:12] third proof of the serpent seed the tree
[27:14] of life was Jesus's spirit because
[27:18] there's only one way to eternal
[27:21] life there's only one way to eternal
[27:25] life so now denominational people they
[27:29] think there's a tree of life and tree of
[27:30] knowledge good and evil and Adam and Eve
[27:32] will go up to the tree of life and just
[27:33] eat like an apple for for eternal life
[27:35] that's
[27:37] impossible God never gave anybody
[27:40] eternal life by eating
[27:42] food
[27:44] right if if the tree of life was like a
[27:47] orange tree let's say that means there's
[27:49] two ways to eternal life there's eternal
[27:52] life through S salvation through the
[27:54] blood sacrifice like Jesus and there's
[27:56] eternal life through eating eating of
[27:58] fruit but that's wrong there's not two
[28:01] ways to eternal life there's only one
[28:03] way to eternal life praise God there's
[28:05] always only been one way eternal life
[28:08] that's by grace through faith it's a
[28:10] sacrifice right God gives us a sacrifice
[28:13] he forgives our sins so that's another
[28:15] proof the Tree of Life had to be the
[28:18] spirit of God because there's not two
[28:20] ways to eternal life there's only one
[28:22] way hallelujah amen
[28:26] hallelujah
[28:28] oh
[28:29] my thank you
[28:32] Jesus so if the tree of life was like a
[28:35] pear tree that would mean there's a
[28:36] second works-based way to in to inherit
[28:40] eternal life there's not there's not a
[28:43] we can't earn salvation it's a gift
[28:45] praise God eternal life has always been
[28:48] a gift it always will be a gift praise
[28:50] God hallelujah now the fourth evidence
[28:54] this is to me this is the most powerful
[28:56] one of course you know you can have your
[28:59] own opinion that's fine the serpent seed
[29:02] explains the purpose of the Virgin birth
[29:04] of Jesus Christ did you ever wonder
[29:06] growing up why did Jesus have to be born
[29:08] virgin birth
[29:10] why why what's so what was so different
[29:14] about
[29:16] that I never even thought about it right
[29:18] I mean I never even wondered why until I
[29:21] came to this message the revelation of
[29:23] the Bible and now I know why Jesus had
[29:26] to be born virgin birth
[29:31] since Mankind's fall into sin came by
[29:35] Sex God had to redeem Man Without a sex
[29:38] act and give them divine power over the
[29:41] sin nature praise
[29:43] God sin came in the world through a sex
[29:46] act so righteousness had to come in the
[29:49] world without that act amen hallelujah
[29:52] praise God and you know the Bible says
[29:54] in the Book of Job uh that every man man
[29:57] born of a woman is a a few days in full
[29:59] of trouble in other words and and even
[30:02] David said David said in sin my mother
[30:04] conceived me well you know the history
[30:07] David wasn't a bastard child David's uh
[30:11] father Jesse is a good man Jesse was a
[30:13] good man praise
[30:15] God Jesse and his wife uh they were
[30:18] married there was nothing sinful in
[30:19] their marriage so what was David saying
[30:22] David was saying through the sex act the
[30:24] sin nature passed into me through my
[30:26] mother my mother and father
[30:29] right I mean as much as I wish Sister
[30:32] Sarah my children were were perfect
[30:34] they're
[30:35] not my son's now 16 brother uh irin
[30:41] probably know and I see him battling the
[30:43] same things I did when I was 16 I'm like
[30:45] oh my goodness this I'm like seeing this
[30:47] is like deja vu or something like that
[30:50] he he's acting the same way I did
[30:52] battling the same things and I'm like oh
[30:54] this is this is
[30:55] strange it's strange to see it
[30:57] you know my in other words the sin
[30:59] nature that was in me as much as I love
[31:00] God I still got a sin nature I got to
[31:02] battle every day this Rascal I got to
[31:04] fight off every day it it came through
[31:08] my wife into him and now he's got that
[31:10] same
[31:11] nature ah but there's a greater nature
[31:14] from a greater father than me I'm
[31:16] nothing I'm a nobody I'm just a human
[31:19] father but our heavenly father gives us
[31:21] power over the sin nature amen amen and
[31:24] that's where my son can get victory over
[31:26] the sin nature he can get it from his
[31:27] Heavenly Father
[31:29] hallelujah
[31:33] amen
[31:35] hallelujah that if you want to write it
[31:37] down it Psalms 51:5 David said behold
[31:40] I'm shapen in iniquity and Inc did my
[31:43] mother conceived me but his parents were
[31:45] married it wasn't a sin he means the sin
[31:48] act or I'm sorry the sin nature passed
[31:50] through into him through his parents'
[31:53] Union their physical
[31:56] Union
[31:58] so God's lamb Jesus Christ had to come
[32:00] to Earth through the Virgin birth to B
[32:02] to bypass the way s sin came into the
[32:06] world see the sin nature wasn't passed
[32:09] down to Jesus because he wasn't
[32:11] conceived of man he was conceived to the
[32:13] Holy Spirit praise God Amen and because
[32:17] of that sin could not have dominion over
[32:19] him praise God hallelujah because he
[32:22] didn't have a natural father who
[32:23] struggle with sin he God had to bypass
[32:26] the seual act and God had to conceive
[32:28] Jesus of the Holy Spirit and that's why
[32:31] Jesus was holy praise God
[32:34] Amen that's why he was a spotless lamb
[32:37] without blemish Hallelujah without spot
[32:40] without blemish because he wasn't
[32:41] conceived the same way we we were in
[32:44] iniquity the sin passing the sin of
[32:47] iniquity the sin nature passing through
[32:49] our parents into
[32:51] us
[32:53] hallelujah because Jesus didn't have a
[32:56] sin nature he could live a sinless
[32:59] life Jesus did not have a sin nature we
[33:02] know he had a word nature because the
[33:04] Bible said the word became flesh and
[33:07] dwelt Among Us how many know that John 1
[33:09] verse4 right the word became flesh the
[33:12] Holy Spirit created a flesh body and
[33:15] dwelt Among Us with no sin on the inside
[33:18] yes it could die yes it could uh feel
[33:20] pain and yes he could be tempted but he
[33:22] wasn't a he did not have a sin nature he
[33:25] had the word nature in other words let
[33:27] me explain like this Brothers uh when
[33:29] we're tempted what do we often do we
[33:31] often give into that you know the first
[33:33] thing we do is we give into that that
[33:35] temptation but Jesus when he was tempted
[33:37] the first thing he would do is go to the
[33:40] word amen right we we we we uh as men
[33:44] women we give into our flesh right we
[33:47] just easily give into that we just turn
[33:48] to our flesh but Jesus was not that way
[33:51] Jesus turned to the word he turned to
[33:53] prayer amen he turned to the father
[33:55] Hallelujah because he had a different
[33:56] nature natur he didn't have a sin nature
[33:58] he had a word
[34:00] nature
[34:02] Glory so the purpose of the Virgin birth
[34:05] had two purposes it prepared a sinless
[34:08] lamb sacrifice to pay for all our sins
[34:11] and begin a new human race
[34:14] hallelujah
[34:19] amen that's right now let me see the
[34:22] second
[34:25] one
[34:27] yeah yeah sinless sacrifice and then a a
[34:31] a new human race now we're not going to
[34:33] read it but in Revelation 5 how many you
[34:35] familiar with Revelation 5 John's
[34:37] weeping because there's a book in heaven
[34:39] and no man's worthy to take the book The
[34:42] Bible said no man in heaven so that
[34:43] would include Moses Enoch Elijah this is
[34:46] some pretty good names right there
[34:49] right no man on Earth no man under the
[34:52] Earth so in the heart of the earth no
[34:55] man was worthy to take the book why
[34:57] because all those men were born of a sex
[34:59] act Hallelujah you see that every man
[35:03] was born of of a sex act so the sin
[35:06] nature passed into him and John was
[35:08] crying he was weeping no man's worthy to
[35:10] take that book and loose the Seven Seals
[35:12] we preached on praise
[35:14] God but who prevailed the Bible the the
[35:17] Elder said weep not the Lamb of God has
[35:20] prevailed Hallelujah the Lamb of God
[35:22] Jesus Christ and he come forth and he
[35:24] looked like a lamb that had been slain
[35:26] and the Bible said Thou Art Worthy to
[35:28] take the book and loose the Seven Seals
[35:31] thereof oh my Hallelujah that's so
[35:34] beautiful other words the only person
[35:36] who could open the book and reveal God's
[35:38] Mysteries was the one who was born with
[35:40] a virgin birth hallelujah oh my that's
[35:43] beautiful praise
[35:45] God that's why the serpent Seed doctrine
[35:48] is so
[35:49] important God had to
[35:51] bypass a sex act or we call intercourse
[35:54] or reproductive act God had to bypass
[35:57] that in order to create a new human race
[36:00] Glory praise God and then Jesus was
[36:04] worthy than to take the book loose the
[36:06] Mysteries and send them down to earth
[36:08] praise God as you heard last week with
[36:10] Revelation 10 right in the cloud
[36:14] amen all right now I want to read these
[36:18] these ones um go to Revelation
[36:23] 3:14 let's read Revelation
[36:25] 3:14
[36:28] [Music]
[36:37] [Music]
[36:40] brother uran you want to read that
[36:41] brother Revelation
[36:45] 3:14
[36:52] chur
[36:54] begin amen wonderful so Jesus Christ was
[36:58] the beginning of the creation of God why
[37:01] because he wasn't
[37:02] born by a sexual act of man and woman he
[37:06] was born conceived of the Holy Ghost he
[37:09] was a new creation amen praise God and
[37:12] what did he have he had a sinless body
[37:14] with no sin nature and then what
[37:17] happened he died he rose and then he got
[37:18] a resurrected the Bible called it a
[37:20] glorified body notice he's the beginning
[37:24] guess what you're the ending amen Jesus
[37:27] was the beginning and you and I all the
[37:29] Believers are the ending of the creation
[37:31] of God in other words the last creation
[37:32] he's going to create is Believers he's
[37:34] going to restore our bodies and make us
[37:37] give us new bodies glorified bodies
[37:39] bodies that can never die bodies that
[37:42] can never sin Jesus was the first one
[37:44] without sin and we will be the last ones
[37:46] without sin praise God hallelujah oh
[37:51] my thank you
[37:54] Jesus it's beautiful
[37:58] now uh the fifth evidence is Adam and
[38:01] Eve covered their loins after eating the
[38:04] forbidden fruit let's read that Genesis
[38:07] 36 and
[38:17] 7 all
[38:19] right verse six and when the woman saw
[38:22] that the tree was good for food now
[38:23] that's spiritual food that's not
[38:25] physical food food right cuz this is
[38:28] symbolism right here CU remember that
[38:30] tree was not good for literal food
[38:33] because if she ate it she died so it
[38:35] wasn't literal F fruit it was spiritual
[38:38] fruit and that it was pleasant to the
[38:40] eye so see he was an attractive
[38:43] Serpent and a tree to be desired to make
[38:46] one wise Satan had deceptive false
[38:49] reasoning she took of the fruit thereof
[38:52] and did eat and gave also unto her
[38:53] husband with her and he did eat
[38:57] and the eyes of them both were open and
[38:59] they knew that they were
[39:01] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[39:04] and made themselves
[39:06] aprons now the word apron means a loin
[39:09] covering and loin is the reproductive
[39:11] areas in the middle of your body okay so
[39:14] as soon as now this is it's just
[39:17] ridiculous churches think they eat an
[39:19] apple and they cover their private
[39:22] parts that doesn't make any sense why
[39:25] would you do that when I eat an apple I
[39:27] got to wipe my mouth right because all
[39:29] the juices and that's what you
[39:32] do but they eat they whatever fruit they
[39:35] partake of it makes them cover their
[39:38] their their loins they sew together
[39:40] leaves and make like little shorts or
[39:42] whatever skirts or whatever and they
[39:44] know they're naked in other words the
[39:47] shame of their act that that that shame
[39:50] Came Upon
[39:52] them this was not a apple tree friends
[39:56] right right this was a Act of adultery
[40:00] now what's interesting I'll just lay
[40:01] this in I don't know where Adam was some
[40:03] people think Adam might have been taking
[40:05] a nap while Eve came over there and then
[40:08] after Adam woke up he came to find her
[40:10] and she'd already partaken so he's like
[40:12] well I I've got to partake of this and
[40:14] and brother does say that brother does
[40:16] say that Adam knew what he was doing he
[40:18] chose to die because Eve was a part of
[40:21] him right and that and that fits the
[40:24] type of Christ right we are Christ's
[40:26] bride we're sinful yet Jesus chose to
[40:29] take our sin upon him praise God Amen
[40:32] and die for our sins Amen brother said
[40:34] Adam loved her so much he just couldn't
[40:36] live without her which makes sense she
[40:39] was a part of him right they were one am
[40:43] when God first made them I'll just go
[40:45] like this they were one Spirit they were
[40:46] one Soul just hovering over like brother
[40:49] like the Holy Spirit they but then God
[40:52] put flesh on Adam but Eve was still on
[40:54] the inside of him and then God had to
[40:57] put him to sleep right take out a rib
[40:59] and then pulled out Eve Spirit pulled
[41:01] out Eve Spirit form Eve and now these
[41:05] two right I'm sorry now this one was was
[41:08] two now right but they were one Soul or
[41:12] one spirit in the
[41:16] beginning all
[41:18] [Music]
[41:20] right now if you know the Bible the
[41:23] Bible
[41:24] says uh the Bible says God does eye for
[41:27] eye tooth for tooth right so in other
[41:30] words the punishment always fits the
[41:32] crime so if Adam and Eve sins sin with
[41:35] their mouth by eating an apple why
[41:37] didn't God make them hoods to cover
[41:39] their
[41:40] mouth right why didn't God do that
[41:44] because whatever the sin is the
[41:47] punishment has to meet the
[41:48] crime if you poke somebody's eye out you
[41:51] lose your eyes if you sin with your
[41:53] mouth your mouth gets smacked right or
[41:55] whatever
[41:57] but God didn't do
[41:59] that the
[42:01] punishment uh the punish yeah the
[42:04] punishment and shame yeah we'll get to
[42:06] the punishment later the shame came in
[42:08] the the loins or the reproductive parts
[42:11] because that's what they use when they
[42:14] sinned because God has the law eye for
[42:17] an eye tooth for a tooth punishment
[42:19] always fits the
[42:20] crime right we saw that with David David
[42:22] laid with basba in private right so
[42:24] what' God say God said then son's going
[42:26] to lay with all your wives in public the
[42:28] punishment fit the
[42:30] crime right Moses remember last time
[42:33] Moses magnified himself and he smoked
[42:35] that rock God said because you did that
[42:37] you're not going in the promised land
[42:39] right you magnified yourself so you're
[42:41] not enjoying the glory of going into the
[42:43] promised land the punishment always has
[42:45] to fit the
[42:47] crime all
[42:50] right oh yes let's read this this is a
[42:52] good one Ezekiel
[42:54] 16:35 and 36
[42:56] Ezekiel 16:35 and
[43:06] 36
[43:08] Ezekiel
[43:19] 16:35 now look at this language here
[43:21] look at the language Ezekiel
[43:25] uses
[43:27] in this script in these scriptures
[43:29] sexual sin always produces shame when
[43:32] it's outside of the marriage covenant
[43:34] right
[43:36] always right because God's punishments
[43:38] have to fit the crimes look at verse 35
[43:41] wherefore oh Harlot hear the word of the
[43:43] Lord thus sayith the Lord God because
[43:45] thy filthiness was poured out and thy
[43:47] nakedness discovered through thy
[43:49] whoredoms with thy lovers and with all
[43:51] thy the idols of thy Abominations and by
[43:53] the blood of thy children which thou did
[43:54] give unto them therefore will I gather
[43:56] thy lovers and God's going to uh destroy
[43:59] that but notice notice those words there
[44:02] thy nakedness was discovered through
[44:04] what whoredoms now look at that that's
[44:07] that's the Bible interpreting itself
[44:09] praise God
[44:10] Amen God said you discovered your
[44:13] nakedness you felt the shame of
[44:14] nakedness because of your sexual sin
[44:17] Glory that's that's the Bible trueu
[44:20] praise God now who's going to argue with
[44:21] that praise God and actually have a good
[44:24] argument you can't you can't argue with
[44:26] that it's plain Bible truth and brother
[44:29] Ram he preached it the Holy Spirit
[44:31] showed it to him he preached it and then
[44:33] a lot of people left him because they
[44:35] can't accept
[44:37] truth now I'm going to read you a quote
[44:39] here brother Ram said you don't have to
[44:41] you you don't have to believe this to be
[44:47] saved so I don't know how many knew that
[44:49] by God's
[44:51] grace but you don't have to believe
[44:53] serpent seed uh to be saved
[44:56] this is the same quote where he says the
[44:58] serpent seed is the
[45:00] killer he said yeah the seed of the
[45:02] serpent that's the killer many people
[45:04] don't believe that he said but if you'll
[45:06] just read Genesis the Bible said the
[45:08] serpent had a
[45:11] seed and then he said what Howard said
[45:14] he actually almost said exactly what you
[45:15] said he said and if the serpent seed was
[45:17] spiritual then Jesus was not a man so
[45:19] the woman's seed was spiritual they both
[45:21] had seeds and the emnity is still there
[45:23] the serpent had a seed and I love I love
[45:25] what brother random says he says and if
[45:27] you'll just take your Bible and get down
[45:29] and be real reverent before God I
[45:31] believe God will reveal it to you see
[45:34] that's the thing people aren't reverent
[45:36] with their Bibles they're not reverent
[45:38] before God so they'll never see it
[45:40] they'll just say oh John's crazy or
[45:43] irin's crazy or Howard and Daniel Jesse
[45:46] they're just crazy people they won't be
[45:49] reverent and really get down and read
[45:50] the Bible and seek God praise God they'
[45:53] rather go to the football game tonight
[45:55] or the I saw him playing the baseball
[45:56] game down there that's fine if you just
[45:58] do it once a week or something like that
[45:59] but I'm saying don't skip church don't
[46:01] skip prayer meeting amen seek God read
[46:04] your Bible pray be devoted unto God seek
[46:07] God and the Bible says if you seek him
[46:08] with all your heart you'll find him
[46:10] praise God
[46:14] Amen now here's what brother Ram says I
[46:18] love this I love brother Ram says and if
[46:20] you do not understand that he said I'm
[46:22] available any time to do my very best to
[46:25] help you
[46:26] [Music]
[46:28] don't you love that brother R is never
[46:30] like well I don't have time for you I
[46:32] don't have time for your questions look
[46:34] how humble he's like if I can help you
[46:37] in any way just let me know I'll help
[46:41] you today would be text me anytime shoot
[46:44] me an email anytime I'll try to help you
[46:47] right how many emails would brother be
[46:50] getting today if he was on Earth he'd
[46:52] get a lot for me brother John I'd be
[46:54] filling up his inbox
[46:58] now look now look look what brother R
[46:59] says next course we realize that doesn't
[47:03] save a
[47:04] man serpent seed has nothing to do with
[47:08] salvation like if if someone says I
[47:10] don't believe in serpent seed they can
[47:11] still be
[47:12] saved because salvation is through what
[47:15] the blood of Jesus Christ right brother
[47:18] said we realize that doesn't save a man
[47:20] neither does it condemn a man so if
[47:22] somebody doesn't believe it they're not
[47:23] going to get
[47:24] judged has nothing to do with
[47:27] salvation but I love this but it only
[47:29] brings light upon the subject that we're
[47:33] all trying so hard to get to the people
[47:36] to see see it only brings light
[47:39] hallelujah amen I love that what are we
[47:42] trying to see we're trying to see Jesus
[47:44] Christ today praise God Amen right we
[47:48] know about Jesus in the past with the
[47:49] anabaptist we know what Jesus in the
[47:51] past on the day of Pentecost but we need
[47:53] to know Jesus today praise God that's
[47:55] the day we're living in and when you see
[47:58] serpent seed now it helps us it shines
[48:00] light on what we're all trying to see
[48:02] we're trying to see Jesus Christ
[48:06] today isn't that
[48:10] beautiful
[48:12] hallelujah
[48:17] amen I mean there's another one Jeremiah
[48:19] 1326 says therefore will I discover thy
[48:22] skirts upon thy face that thy shame may
[48:24] appear
[48:27] so God says basically I'm going to show
[48:29] your shame I'm going to show that you're
[48:30] an adulterer uh you've you've removed
[48:33] your skirts for some men and I'm going
[48:35] to show your shame that's Jeremiah 13:26
[48:38] in other words you're going to feel
[48:39] shame because of your sexual sin and
[48:41] that's what Adam and Eve did they felt
[48:43] shamed they knew they were naked so they
[48:44] cover their
[48:47] nakedness we're getting close to the end
[48:49] here now well kind of close evidence
[48:51] number six is God's punishments for Eve
[48:55] sins
[48:56] centered on her reproduction and her
[48:59] longing for Adam did you catch that when
[49:02] you read the Bible go to Genesis
[49:05] 3:16 Genesis
[49:09] 3:16 remember the punishments must
[49:12] always fit the
[49:14] crimes so if Eve sinned in a sexual way
[49:18] then God would have punished her in her
[49:19] sexual reproduction well that's exactly
[49:21] what he did praise
[49:23] God Amen Hallelujah it's exactly what he
[49:26] did is it is it amazing yeah wow exactly
[49:30] same thing I say
[49:32] unbelievable God's punishments always
[49:35] fit the
[49:38] crimes oh it's beautiful the revelation
[49:41] of God's word is beautiful Genesis
[49:45] 3:16 what does God tell the woman and
[49:47] unto the woman he said I will greatly
[49:50] multiply thy sorrow and thy
[49:54] conception we just had a sister give
[49:56] birth last Sunday she only had a 5-h
[49:58] hour labor that was pretty good
[50:02] she that's not too bad right that's not
[50:05] too bad she had a 24-hour one one time I
[50:08] thought God bless that woman God bless
[50:10] that woman but where does God punish her
[50:13] in her pain in her conception of what
[50:16] conception of what
[50:18] seed why because she received the wrong
[50:21] seed in the beginning amen because she
[50:24] took the seed of the serpent God said
[50:26] I'm going to bring pain in every one of
[50:28] your daughters who bring who gets any
[50:31] seed they're going to have pain in
[50:33] conceiving and bringing forth the child
[50:35] and the church
[50:38] said every daughter of Eve now every
[50:42] daughter of Eve has pain in the bringing
[50:45] forth of seed because of what Eve did in
[50:47] the
[50:48] beginning that's thus saith
[50:51] God right why because of she received
[50:55] the wrong wrong
[50:58] seed that was verse 16 oh yes and in
[51:01] sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children
[51:03] you're going to have pain when you bring
[51:05] forth seed because you received the
[51:06] wrong seed in the beginning you took the
[51:08] serpent seed first instead of
[51:12] Adam that's
[51:13] right and now and then notice this God
[51:16] has to adjust her her her uh her desire
[51:20] why would God have to adjust her desire
[51:23] didn't she already desire Adam no
[51:26] this shows she desired the serpent
[51:28] because God has to make her desire her
[51:30] husband
[51:32] now oh look at verse
[51:35] 16 and thy desire shall be to thy
[51:37] husband and he shall rule over
[51:40] thee right all these are consequences
[51:43] you got pain in conceiving seed because
[51:45] you receiv received the wrong seed now
[51:46] you're going to desire Adam because you
[51:48] didn't desire him at first you desired
[51:50] remember the Bible said she looked at
[51:52] the tree it was beautiful to look on and
[51:54] she desired
[51:56] well R said the servant was a handsome
[51:58] fell so way handsomer than all of us in
[52:05] here look at that God has to say now you
[52:08] got to desire Adam because you didn't
[52:09] desire Adam at first does everybody
[52:11] understand
[52:15] tonight you got paying bringing forth
[52:17] seed because you received the wrong seed
[52:19] and now you must desire your husband
[52:21] because you didn't desire him at the
[52:22] beginning you desired the
[52:24] serpent
[52:26] all
[52:30] [Music]
[52:36] right and again if Eve ate an apple why
[52:39] didn't God punish her mouth and all the
[52:41] apple
[52:42] trees God's punishments focus on her
[52:45] human reproduction her reproduction of
[52:48] seed and the body parts of the loins
[52:51] used for that
[52:54] process
[52:55] my goodness you know I've heard
[52:57] preachers you know I heard a preacher
[52:59] say it on his podcast he's in the
[53:00] message he's like I I don't know how
[53:02] ever I ever missed this for all these
[53:04] years how did I not see that when I was
[53:06] growing up how do we not see it well
[53:08] there's a time and season for all things
[53:10] praise God but in other words once you
[53:13] see it you can't unsee it they
[53:16] say you can't not see what happened
[53:20] there because God puts hatred between
[53:22] the seed lines and then God says the
[53:25] serpent has children he has Offspring
[53:27] well how do you get Offspring by eating
[53:29] an apple how did that
[53:31] happen how did that
[53:34] happen do you have people have children
[53:36] by eating apples no they
[53:41] don't see so it just shows most most
[53:45] churches don't want the truth they're
[53:47] not hungering and thirsting for truth
[53:50] amen they don't want the
[53:54] truth
[53:55] now that word desire means longing or
[53:57] craving there it is so God said your
[53:59] longing Eve is now going to be to Adam
[54:01] you're going to Crave Adam now because
[54:03] what' she do she craved the serpent
[54:05] earlier okay that's what the word means
[54:07] look it up in the Hebrew you can look it
[54:08] up she craved she had a forbidden
[54:10] there's there the corruption came in the
[54:12] world through lust there it is right
[54:13] there just like Peter
[54:21] said now how many would raise your hand
[54:23] and say it's starting to become more
[54:24] clear is any would anybody say that okay
[54:25] a couple more some of those children
[54:26] raise their
[54:29] hands hopefully not hopefully not
[54:34] yet even even in my church you I have
[54:36] the little ones in there I usually don't
[54:38] preach this very very clearly until they
[54:40] get to a certain age you know
[54:43] so um and of course we never really
[54:46] explain it fully until they get to a
[54:48] certain
[54:49] age also note let's read Genesis
[54:54] 3:20
[54:57] oh yeah we read this before right and
[54:59] Adam called his wife's name Eve because
[55:01] she was the mother of all living now
[55:03] just stop for a moment in Genesis
[55:06] 3 the denominations don't even think
[55:09] anything sexuals happened they just
[55:10] think they ate an apple how can she be a
[55:13] mother already if she only ate an
[55:16] apple the denominations don't recognize
[55:19] Eve having relations until chapter 4
[55:22] when it says Adam knew Eve his wife but
[55:25] Adam already calls her a mother in
[55:26] chapter three praise God she's already a
[55:29] mother why because God said she's got
[55:31] seed right the Serpent's God's seed
[55:33] she's God's
[55:35] seed Adam already calls her a mother not
[55:39] by eating an
[55:41] apple but by receiving the Serpent's
[55:47] Seed that's a blessing again all this is
[55:49] in my book if you want it's also in the
[55:51] church age book right brother R uran
[55:53] have you read the whole church age book
[55:56] or most of it or some of
[55:57] it okay so it's in uh it's in the
[56:00] chapter about the tree of life so I
[56:02] think it's the seventh or eighth or
[56:03] ninth chapter I think the sard sardian
[56:06] church age brother Braham goes through
[56:08] when when it says I'll give you the Tree
[56:09] of Life brother Braham says okay now let
[56:10] me show you the tree of life and let me
[56:12] show you the tree of knowledge good and
[56:14] evil and lays out the serpent seed in
[56:17] that book it's a phenomenal
[56:21] book all
[56:23] right the seventh evidence we're almost
[56:26] at number nine see we're getting close
[56:27] now we're only two away now evidence
[56:29] number seven is the serpent was
[56:31] humanlike before the
[56:34] fall so
[56:35] before God cursed the serpent he was
[56:38] very similar to a
[56:40] human the proof of that is in Genesis
[56:43] 3 he has three humanlike attributes the
[56:46] Bible said he was more subtle that means
[56:49] shrewd Sly or
[56:51] crafty he was the sest of all the
[56:54] animals
[56:55] the serpent was
[56:58] okay um second he was the only Beast
[57:02] that could talk in the garden think of
[57:04] that Adam could talk with the serpent he
[57:05] could have we don't know if he did but
[57:06] he could have because the serpent had
[57:08] the ability to
[57:10] talk when Eve is talking to the serpent
[57:13] Eve's not like oh a snake's talking to
[57:15] me ah what where's Adam where's
[57:17] Adam so see she had to been aware that
[57:20] the serpent could
[57:22] talk or else like me I would have
[57:24] screamed like what I'm I'm out here too
[57:27] I'm not talking to any talking
[57:29] snake I rebuke that snake in Jesus
[57:33] name but it just shows they were used to
[57:36] talk they were just having a
[57:37] conversation it was everything was
[57:39] normal there's no sin
[57:41] yet so the serpent was slier more Sly
[57:44] than slyer is not a word I'm making up
[57:46] words here the serpent was more Sly I'm
[57:48] a school teacher too what a
[57:51] shame I better get straightened out cuz
[57:53] school starts in a week and a half have
[57:55] here he was more Sly than any other
[57:58] animal and he could
[58:00] talk and he could reason he could say oh
[58:03] no you surely won't die he had the
[58:05] ability to reason and give reasons why
[58:07] he was
[58:08] right not just like a par a par can say
[58:10] hello Don hello Donnie hello Jesse hello
[58:13] hello John a parot can just
[58:16] mimic but a serpent gave you reasons
[58:20] why right so the serpent was so close to
[58:23] being human but what wasn't fully
[58:29] human and third uh the Bible says the
[58:33] serpent was an upright creature because
[58:35] in verse 14 God cursed him and said
[58:37] you'll go on your belly the rest of your
[58:39] days how many know that right okay so
[58:43] the curse put him on his belly that
[58:45] means before he wasn't on the ground he
[58:47] was an upright creature and science said
[58:49] he had DNA for arms and legs now who
[58:52] goodness gracious who couldn't see this
[58:54] praise God we should put this all over
[58:55] the Internet and guess who's going to
[58:56] watch five people cuz nobody
[58:59] cares they want to hear about the
[59:01] football game the baseball game with a
[59:03] way to make a million dollars on your
[59:06] phone which never
[59:10] works they don't people don't want it
[59:13] but God's people want the truth amen
[59:15] hallelujah the Bible said God said my
[59:17] word will not return void wherever I
[59:20] send it it will accomplish that what
[59:22] it's purpose to accomplish Hallelujah in
[59:24] other words God knew you'd want the word
[59:26] so somehow he made a way you could hear
[59:28] serpent seed the godhead the Seven Seals
[59:30] the water baptism in the name of Jesus
[59:32] Christ God had a way to get his word to
[59:35] you you ought to be happy about that
[59:37] praise God I'm happy about that
[59:40] amen amen think about that all the all
[59:44] those years for 21 years brother Howard
[59:45] I didn't even know about the serpent SC
[59:47] but God knew I'd believe it when I was
[59:49] exposed to it so God made a way I could
[59:52] hear it in fact this is the first sermon
[59:54] ever heard from the message was the
[59:56] serpent seed
[59:58] W
[59:59] Hallelujah I tell you I had a hard time
[1:00:01] going to sleep that night CU I was like
[1:00:03] wow what else is in the Bible I've never
[1:00:05] heard a man preach like
[1:00:07] that I think we stayed up till like 1 or
[1:00:10] 2: a.m. listen to those
[1:00:12] sermons that's that was some fresh
[1:00:14] Revelation right there by God's
[1:00:17] grace Hallelujah yes it was the
[1:00:20] University of Georgia in two in October
[1:00:22] 2015 I got the article if you want it
[1:00:26] discovered snakes once had legs they
[1:00:28] have DNA that controls the development
[1:00:31] and growth of Limbs it's already in
[1:00:34] every snake let's go find a snake after
[1:00:36] service
[1:00:39] brother if we if we had a mic if we had
[1:00:41] a microscope we could look under there
[1:00:43] there'd be DNA if we had a real good
[1:00:44] microscope there' be DNA it says has the
[1:00:48] ability to create
[1:00:49] limbs why because at one point the
[1:00:51] snakes were the serpent was upright and
[1:00:54] he looked a lot like a man and he had
[1:00:57] seed that could reproduce with human
[1:01:01] with a
[1:01:02] human now there's no animal like that
[1:01:04] brother says science is always looking
[1:01:06] for that missing link right that's what
[1:01:08] brother says where's the missing link
[1:01:09] between animal and man it was the
[1:01:12] serpent but God cut off that Missing
[1:01:15] Link and now they they'll never find it
[1:01:19] they never find
[1:01:22] it okay
[1:01:26] evidence number eight Cain was the
[1:01:28] Serpent's son and not Adams we've
[1:01:29] already covered
[1:01:30] this um so we aware this one not as Cain
[1:01:35] who is of that Wicked one who and slew
[1:01:37] his brother and wherefore slew him
[1:01:39] because his own Works were evil and his
[1:01:41] brothers were
[1:01:43] righteous so E's womb had two separate
[1:01:46] seeds from two separate impregnations
[1:01:49] and they were
[1:01:51] twins Cain's conception was some time
[1:01:53] before
[1:01:56] Ables and I have an article from July
[1:01:59] 1994 I was 14 years old when they wrote
[1:02:01] the article uh and it talks about uh
[1:02:03] heteros super
[1:02:05] funication it's it's proved by science
[1:02:07] this happens all the time with s when
[1:02:10] with sinful men and women right two
[1:02:13] seeds one
[1:02:14] woman
[1:02:18] twins all right um now I want to lay
[1:02:22] this in here brother R told us in the
[1:02:24] day days of Noah brother Bram said
[1:02:25] either Noah's wife was of the seed line
[1:02:28] of the serpent or Noah's sons married
[1:02:31] women who were of the sea line of the
[1:02:33] serpent so brother R said all of us are
[1:02:36] now intermixed with that with like a
[1:02:39] sinful
[1:02:40] nature okay which that's that's good
[1:02:45] news that's good news now why is it good
[1:02:47] news because it means you're not your
[1:02:50] salvation isn't dependent on who your
[1:02:52] mom and dad was Glory amen your
[1:02:55] salvation is depend on that God is your
[1:02:57] heavenly father praise God Amen
[1:03:00] Hallelujah your natural seed life
[1:03:02] doesn't determine if you're going to be
[1:03:04] saved or not anymore it used to it
[1:03:07] doesn't anymore that's why God had to
[1:03:09] send the seed of God which is the Holy
[1:03:11] Ghost praise God Amen let's go there
[1:03:14] first Peter 1:23 and brother how why
[1:03:17] don't you read that for us when you get
[1:03:18] there 1 Peter
[1:03:19] 1:23 now I have preached on the baptism
[1:03:22] of the Holy Ghost here right I talk
[1:03:24] about the filling of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:26] another way to say that is to receive
[1:03:28] God's
[1:03:29] seed the Holy Ghost is also called a
[1:03:32] seed it's called water fire it's called
[1:03:35] it's called n a dove it's called many
[1:03:37] oil it's called many things but it's
[1:03:39] also called a
[1:03:41] seed and so now God says I love it God
[1:03:44] says it doesn't matter who your parents
[1:03:45] were doesn't matter what seed line
[1:03:47] you're of now what matters is that you
[1:03:49] receive my seed amen and the Bible said
[1:03:53] whosoever will let him come and drink of
[1:03:56] the Waters of Life freely amen amen so
[1:03:59] everybody has a chance to be saved now
[1:04:01] we know very few will Jesus said few
[1:04:03] there be that find the narrow road that
[1:04:04] leads to life but all those who desire
[1:04:07] salvation can be saved and they can be
[1:04:10] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:13] amen
[1:04:15] glory all right brother Howard can you
[1:04:17] read that
[1:04:19] um what did I
[1:04:22] say yeah 1 Peter 1:2 there you go sorry
[1:04:24] I forgot I got so many thoughts going
[1:04:26] through my mind go ahead brother being
[1:04:28] born again not of corruptable deed but
[1:04:30] of Incorruptible by the word of God
[1:04:33] which liveth and abideth forever and the
[1:04:35] church said amen what are you born again
[1:04:38] by receiving God's seed into your
[1:04:43] soul so now it doesn't matter our mom my
[1:04:46] mom and dad doesn't matter what doesn't
[1:04:48] matter that has nothing to do with
[1:04:49] whether I'm saved or not now it did in
[1:04:51] the Old Testament remember God got mad
[1:04:54] at it in the days of Noah God said
[1:04:56] that's one reason I am destroying the
[1:04:57] Earth is because the sons of God saw the
[1:04:59] daughters of men right brother amen
[1:05:02] right and God said because of that I'm
[1:05:04] destroying the Earth well guess what
[1:05:06] even God's own children
[1:05:08] intermarried with the serpent seed line
[1:05:11] because Noah's sons either Noah and his
[1:05:13] sons are just Noah's sons they all
[1:05:15] married a woman who is of the serpent
[1:05:18] seed line and church everyone here today

[1:05:30] Creation Museum he is of the sea line of
[1:05:33] Shem they trace his DNA back now that's

[1:06:27] other night and it says uh I've been
[1:06:30] born again into a family and now his
[1:06:32] blood runs through my veins now not
[1:06:35] natural but I got spiritual life I have
[1:06:37] the life of the Holy Ghost running
[1:06:39] through my body amen hallelujah in other
[1:06:41] words I've got the the the life of my
[1:06:43] father is inside of me the spiritual DNA
[1:06:46] is working itself out in my life

[1:06:51] to grow up and we're going to see is she
[1:06:52] going to look like Mom or dad or like a
[1:06:55] mixture of both the DNA is going to come
[1:06:57] out pretty soon I can see a little bit
[1:06:59] of Miriam and Mah maybe a little more
[1:07:02] dad there you know see the DNA is coming
[1:07:05] out the same thing's true in the
[1:07:06] spiritual praise God the longer you love

[1:07:10] more you'll be like Christ hallelujah
[1:07:13] amen because you're born of his Seed

[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:22] hallelujah that's what I want to want
[1:07:23] people to see Jesus in me praise God I
[1:07:26] don't want them to see Jesse they're
[1:07:28] going to see my mistakes eventually but
[1:07:30] as long as I can I want them to see
[1:07:32] Christ in me because that's that's who
[1:07:35] I'm born of that's my
[1:07:38] DNA Hallelujah my spiritual DNA all
[1:07:41] right evidence number nine we got there
[1:07:42] already see that that wasn't too long
[1:07:44] that was that about an hour by God's
[1:07:46] grace yeah it's been an hour sorry it's
[1:07:49] been an hour and 10 minutes so I'm gonna
[1:07:50] try to
[1:07:51] closer I think this is what Howard was
[1:07:53] saying too the seed of the woman was a
[1:07:55] literal man Jesus right God told Eve
[1:07:58] you're going to have seed well that seed
[1:07:59] was eventually
[1:08:01] Jesus two uh 4,000 years
[1:08:04] later and so the seed of the serpent was
[1:08:06] a literal man as well so some people
[1:08:09] will look at you know Genesis 3:15 and
[1:08:11] they'll say well God was just talking
[1:08:13] about a spiritual seed the the Serpent's
[1:08:15] spiritual seed but no it had the serpent
[1:08:17] had to have a literal seed because Eve
[1:08:19] had a literal seed isn't that
[1:08:22] powerful it everything lines up with
[1:08:24] this it lines up to be the truth praise
[1:08:27] God I've never seen this Doctrine fail
[1:08:29] I've never seen this teaching fail all
[1:08:31] these people give me comments and emails
[1:08:33] on YouTube never has it ever fallen now
[1:08:35] I don't have all the
[1:08:36] answers but God has all the
[1:08:39] answers Hallelujah and they can't deny
[1:08:42] what the Bible says what are you going
[1:08:44] to say well well I I don't want to hear
[1:08:45] that verse well that proves you lost the
[1:08:47] debate there if you don't want to if you
[1:08:49] don't want to acknowledge the Bible if
[1:08:50] you don't want to believe the Bible you
[1:08:51] don't have to but that means you lost
[1:08:52] the debate that means you're
[1:08:55] wrong
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:08:58] right okay a couple more scriptures here
[1:09:01] I'm almost done um go to Proverbs 30:20
[1:09:05] this is the one I I read I think I think
[1:09:07] I preached this the first time I was
[1:09:09] with you Proverbs 30:20 I was going
[1:09:11] through a list of the Mysteries brother
[1:09:13] B brought
[1:09:15] us Proverbs 30:20 some of you might
[1:09:18] remember
[1:09:20] this so this verse is what Eve did this
[1:09:24] is what Eve did always think of Eve when
[1:09:27] you read Proverbs 30:
[1:09:29] 20 this is what Eve did she committed
[1:09:31] adultery with the serpent remember is
[1:09:35] God God made her punishment in her loins
[1:09:38] her reproduction and God changed her
[1:09:40] craving to Adam instead of the
[1:09:44] serpent Proverbs 30:20 such is the way
[1:09:47] of an adulterous woman she eateth and
[1:09:50] wipeth her mouth and saith I have done
[1:09:52] no wickedness so this this is symbolism
[1:09:55] a woman goes commits adultery with a man
[1:09:57] the Bible said the Bible said the
[1:09:59] symbolism is like eating and wiping her
[1:10:01] mouth so eating was symbolic of adultery
[1:10:05] okay is that right and Eve ate whatever
[1:10:08] she ate of it produce two different seed
[1:10:10] lines two different
[1:10:11] offsprings okay can everybody see that
[1:10:14] it's a Bible principle that eating
[1:10:16] represents marriage
[1:10:20] relations right now do you need another
[1:10:22] or how familiar are you with of Solomon
[1:10:24] do you know you know that's in the Song
[1:10:25] of Solomon
[1:10:26] too Solomon had his wedding night and
[1:10:29] the Bible said I'm Solon said I'm going
[1:10:31] into my garden and I'm going to eat my
[1:10:32] Pleasant fruits in my garden he's
[1:10:35] talking about his wife his wife was a
[1:10:37] garden isn't Eve a
[1:10:39] garden don't don't our married sisters
[1:10:41] don't our married sisters bring forth
[1:10:43] fruit of the loins fruit of the
[1:10:46] womb is that
[1:10:51] right y'all thinking really deep aren't
[1:10:53] you
[1:10:56] that's the word of God that's right it
[1:10:58] is the word it's
[1:11:01] truth and just so you know we're not
[1:11:02] going to read it but it's Song of
[1:11:03] Solomon 5 verse1 that's the wedding
[1:11:06] night uh and Solomon says I've come into
[1:11:08] my garden I've eat I've eaten my spices
[1:11:11] I've drink my uh juices and all these
[1:11:13] things he's talking about the wedding
[1:11:16] night because eating and drinking is
[1:11:19] symbolic of marriage
[1:11:21] relationship bedroom relationship
[1:11:25] all
[1:11:26] right all right last thing I want to
[1:11:29] share go to Genesis
[1:11:32] 41 now this may be kind of new to you so
[1:11:35] bear with me here hope this isn't over
[1:11:37] our heads too much so most church
[1:11:40] members will read Genesis 4:1 and
[1:11:42] they'll say oh here's the first uh
[1:11:44] marriage relationship between Adam and
[1:11:46] Eve but remember Adam already called her
[1:11:48] a mother in the previous
[1:11:50] chapter she's already a mother before
[1:11:52] chapter 4:1
[1:11:55] won my goodness and I got this recorded
[1:11:57] if you guys want a recording of this
[1:11:59] later I can share it to brother Irving
[1:12:01] want to go back and listen to this of
[1:12:02] course I wrote I got videos I got books
[1:12:04] about it brother R preaches sermons on
[1:12:06] it it's a
[1:12:08] blessing it says and Adam knew his wife
[1:12:11] Eve and she conceived in be Cain and
[1:12:13] said I have gotten a man from the Lord
[1:12:16] now the word new Adam new means sexual
[1:12:21] relations now the revelation is this
[1:12:24] here's the Revelation Church Genesis 41
[1:12:27] repeats what Genesis
[1:12:31] 3:6 said with a literal
[1:12:35] interpretation along with further
[1:12:37] information about the act so Genesis 4:1
[1:12:41] is actually what happened in Genesis
[1:12:43] 3:6 when Eve gave the fruit to her
[1:12:48] husband okay in Genesis 3:6 Eve gave
[1:12:51] fruit to Adam that was really having
[1:12:54] marriage relationship well Genesis 4:1
[1:12:57] is just a literal interpretation of that
[1:13:03] symbolism I know that's kind of deep
[1:13:06] there but it's the
[1:13:09] truth the Bible often
[1:13:13] switches between symbolic to
[1:13:16] literal and I've got numerous
[1:13:20] examples in in Revelation 17
[1:13:24] the mother Harlot is described as having
[1:13:27] a seven-headed
[1:13:28] beast and she's an evil woman in
[1:13:31] Revelation 17 how many know that it's a
[1:13:33] Roman Catholic
[1:13:35] Church it says she's got seven heads and
[1:13:37] she's a woman but is she really a woman
[1:13:41] she's a
[1:13:43] church so the Bible lists the symbolism
[1:13:46] first and then it gives the literal
[1:13:48] interpretation
[1:13:50] later hallelujah praise God
[1:13:54] amen just like genesis Genesis gave the
[1:13:57] symbolism eating the fruit in Genesis
[1:14:00] 3:6 and then it gives the literal
[1:14:02] interpretation in Genesis 4:1 symbolism
[1:14:05] then literal the same thing in
[1:14:06] Revelation 17 symbol form and literal
[1:14:10] praise
[1:14:11] God
[1:14:15] hallelujah so what are the seven heads
[1:14:17] represent on the mother Harlot the Seven
[1:14:19] Mountains on which she sits the seven
[1:14:21] ancient Hills of Rome
[1:14:27] okay so that's some deep that's some
[1:14:30] deep uh Revelation there it's also in
[1:14:32] Genesis chapter
[1:14:34] 1 in Genesis chapter 1 God records
[1:14:38] Mankind's creation on day six right Adam
[1:14:41] and Eve are created in Genesis chapter 1
[1:14:43] but Genesis 2 gives the literal
[1:14:45] interpretation of it God puts Adam in a
[1:14:49] flesh body breathes life into him but
[1:14:53] remember that God already described that
[1:14:54] in Genesis chapter 1 the symbolism was
[1:14:57] first and the literal interpretation
[1:14:59] came
[1:15:02] later now if you didn't catch that don't
[1:15:04] feel bad I didn't catch that till a
[1:15:06] couple years ago s been in the message
[1:15:08] says 2001 the end of 2001 it's really
[1:15:12] 2002 so I caught this in
[1:15:16] 2021 said have been about 19 years it
[1:15:19] took me 19 years to catch it so don't
[1:15:21] feel bad if you don't if you didn't
[1:15:22] catch it but you can text me like
[1:15:24] brother R said you can text me with any
[1:15:28] questions all right so remember you
[1:15:31] don't have to know serpent seed to be
[1:15:35] saved and you're not condemned if you
[1:15:37] don't understand it all it does is bring
[1:15:40] light upon what we're trying to see
[1:15:43] we're trying to see the Bible restored
[1:15:45] we're trying to see the mysteries of God
[1:15:47] finished how many you understand that
[1:15:48] that's Revelation 10:7 says all the
[1:15:50] Mysteries will be finished praise God
[1:15:52] let's stand to our
[1:15:54] feet you're very good audience I kept
[1:15:57] you an hour and 15 minutes and you're
[1:15:58] very good very good
[1:16:01] listening again if you have any
[1:16:03] questions on that
