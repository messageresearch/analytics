[4:32] she's pretty he'll think she's a
[4:35] jezebel he'll think behind those red
[4:38] lips is poison fangs that would stain
[4:42] and the Bible said her Gates is the
[4:44] gates of hell and a man walks into him
[4:46] like an ox going to his Slaughter
[4:48] there's a thinking
[4:50] man
[4:51] filter what do you
[4:54] desire when the woman comes down the
[4:56] street dressed like that and you man
[4:58] turn your head gaze around like that
[5:01] you're not using a thinking man's filter
[5:04] amen because when you do that you're
[5:06] committing
[5:08] adultery for the filter said whosoever
[5:10] lookth upon a woman to lust after her
[5:13] have committed adultery with her
[5:15] already turn your head thinking

[5:32] her oh yes the word of God is the
[5:36] thinking man's filter anyone knows that
[5:40] that's what your soul is filtered
[5:41] through the word of God and it makes
[5:45] when you come to God when a thinking man
[5:49] comes to God's filter it gives him a
[5:52] holy man's
[5:54] taste right when you come through God's
[5:57] filter then your taste
[6:00] is a holy man's
[6:03] taste it makes a righteous man's taste
