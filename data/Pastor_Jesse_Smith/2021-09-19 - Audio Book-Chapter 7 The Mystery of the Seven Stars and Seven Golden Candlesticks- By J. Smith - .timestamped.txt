[0:00] chapter 7 the mystery of the seven stars
[0:03] and seven golden candlesticks
[0:05] chapter seven contains footnotes numbers
[0:07] 972-1166
[0:12] the mystery of the seven stars which
[0:14] thou sauce in my right hand and the
[0:16] seven golden candlesticks the seven
[0:19] stars are the angels of the seven
[0:20] churches and the seven candlesticks
[0:23] which thou saust are the seven churches
[0:26] revelation 1 verse 20.
[0:30] the book of the revelation of jesus
[0:32] christ the climatic finale of the new
[0:34] testament
[0:35] contains the seventh mystery of the
[0:37] seven stars and seven golden
[0:39] candlesticks
[0:40] the number seven is referenced 36 times
[0:42] in revelation as its spiritual meaning
[0:45] is completion
[0:47] genesis 1 shows god creating for six
[0:49] days but completing his work and resting
[0:52] on the seventh
[0:54] the greek meaning of revelation is
[0:56] laying bear disclosure of truth
[0:58] appearance in revelation jesus lays bare
[1:02] or unveils his plan to bring redemption
[1:05] restoration and completion to humanity
[1:08] through seven churches seven spirits
[1:11] seven golden candlesticks seven stars
[1:14] seven lamps of fire seven seals seven
[1:17] horns seven eyes seven trumpets seven
[1:20] angels seven thunders
[1:22] a seventh angel seven thousand men
[1:25] seven heads seven crowns
[1:28] seven last plagues seven golden vials
[1:30] seven mountains seven kings and a seven
[1:33] stone
[1:36] while some shy away from revelation
[1:38] jesus promises blessings upon those who
[1:40] read hear and keep it in its third verse
[1:44] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[1:47] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[1:49] those things which are written therein
[1:51] for the time is at hand
[1:53] if you are born again you have no fear
[1:55] of misinterpreting revelation because
[1:58] jesus promised his spirit would guide
[2:00] you into all truth
[2:02] through divine inspiration john's
[2:04] writing from the isle of patmos pulls
[2:06] back the curtain to dramatically unveil
[2:08] jesus and his true bride along with
[2:11] lucifer and the false bride the mother
[2:13] harlot
[2:15] at the onset of this chapter i strongly
[2:18] advise you to read william branham's an
[2:20] exposition of the seven church ages for
[2:23] a thorough explanation of revelation
[2:25] chapters one through three
[2:27] i've always considered this book the
[2:29] second most important text i've read
[2:31] outside the holy bible i will share more
[2:34] about this monumental book at the end of
[2:36] the chapter
[2:39] the confusion about the mystery of the
[2:41] seven stars and seven golden
[2:43] candlesticks
[2:45] jesus leaves no confusion about the
[2:47] meaning of the seven stars and seven
[2:49] golden candlesticks because revelation 1
[2:52] verse 20 declares the stars are angels
[2:55] and the candlesticks are seven churches
[2:58] ephesus smyrna pergamos thyatira
[3:02] sardis philadelphia and laodicea
[3:05] the confusion about the stars and
[3:07] candlesticks centers around two
[3:09] questions
[3:10] what are the identities of the seven
[3:12] star angels and were the messages to the
[3:15] seven churches only for those local
[3:18] churches around 95 a.d
[3:21] or were they prophetic to future ages
[3:23] and generations
[3:25] the revelation of the mystery of the
[3:27] seven stars and seven candlesticks is
[3:30] jesus ordained seven men to declare
[3:33] truth and model holy living during the
[3:35] time of the gentiles or seven church
[3:37] ages
[3:39] scripture and history validate the seven
[3:42] stars or angels our men jesus anointed
[3:45] to let their lights so shine before men
[3:48] in their generations
[3:50] these seven preachers most closely
[3:52] adhered to paul's gospel blueprint the
[3:55] letters to the seven churches apply both
[3:57] to seven local churches but are also
[3:59] prophetic warnings and blessings about
[4:02] the conditions christians would
[4:03] experience in future time periods
[4:08] biblical evidence for the revelation of
[4:09] the seven stars and seven golden
[4:12] candlesticks
[4:13] beginning with the seven stars jesus
[4:15] calls them seven angels but they were
[4:17] seven literal men not heavenly angels
[4:20] the first proof of this is found in
[4:22] revelation 2 verse 1
[4:24] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[4:27] write
[4:28] why would jesus tell john to author a
[4:30] handwritten letter to a heavenly angel
[4:33] at ephesus
[4:34] god speaks directly to heavenly angels
[4:37] sending them from his throne to minister
[4:39] to believers who shall be heirs of
[4:41] salvation
[4:42] the lord does not need to write letters
[4:44] to angels
[4:46] the truth is jesus was assigning john to
[4:48] write to an earthly man at ephesus who
[4:51] would preserve the letter for upcoming
[4:53] generations to whom it would also apply
[4:56] to
[4:58] secondly the seven angels are symbolic
[5:00] of human preachers because men are
[5:02] sometimes referred to as angels in
[5:04] scripture
[5:05] the hebrew definition of angel is
[5:07] messenger and jesus appropriately calls
[5:10] john the baptist god's messenger in
[5:13] matthew 11 verse 10.
[5:15] the prophet david is twice called an
[5:17] angel of god in first samuel 29 verse 9
[5:21] and 2nd samuel 19 27. paul says the
[5:24] galatians received him as an angel of
[5:26] god even as christ jesus in galatians 4
[5:30] 14.
[5:31] a final witness is revelation 22 verses
[5:34] 8 and 9 as the angel sent to john to
[5:38] show him the prophecies was actually a
[5:40] fellow servant of his
[5:42] a prophet who kept the sayings of
[5:44] revelation
[5:46] a third fact is god uses men to help
[5:49] save men
[5:50] angels assist men but men are god's
[5:53] primary tool for sharing his way to
[5:55] salvation
[5:56] romans 10 verse 14 says how shall they
[5:59] hear without a preacher
[6:01] mark 16 20 explains jesus disciples
[6:05] preached everywhere
[6:06] the lord working with them and
[6:08] confirming the word with signs following
[6:12] fourthly notice the location of the
[6:14] stars they are in jesus right hand
[6:17] both moses and jesus to find god's right
[6:20] hand as his power and authority strictly
[6:23] reserved for christ and not angels
[6:26] according to hebrews 1 verse 13
[6:29] but jesus promised men would inherit
[6:31] god's power to witness his resurrection
[6:35] lastly abraham seed faith-filled humans
[6:38] are referred to as stars in genesis 15
[6:42] verse 5.
[6:43] daniel 12 3 likens the saved and soul
[6:46] winners to stars saying
[6:48] and they that be wise shall shine as the
[6:51] brightness of the firmament and they
[6:53] that turn many to righteousness as the
[6:55] stars forever and ever
[6:58] john the baptist god's messenger is
[7:00] likened unto a star
[7:02] a burning light in john 5 35.
[7:06] he was a burning and a shining light and
[7:09] ye were willing for a season to rejoice
[7:11] in his light
[7:14] jesus interprets the seven golden
[7:15] candlesticks as the seven churches of
[7:18] the seven gentile cities located in
[7:20] turkey
[7:21] no jewish churches are mentioned because
[7:24] john wrote this around 95 a.d
[7:26] and god had already blinded israel
[7:29] because of their unbelief and turned to
[7:31] the gentiles nearly 50 years prior
[7:34] jesus christ calls god's focus on saving
[7:36] the gentiles the times of the gentiles
[7:39] in luke 21 24
[7:42] in matthew 21 verses 33 through 46
[7:46] jesus plainly teaches he is going to
[7:48] take the kingdom from israel and give it
[7:50] to the gentiles
[7:52] verse 41 says
[7:54] he will miserably destroy those wicked
[7:56] men and will let out his vineyard unto
[7:58] other husbandmen which shall render him
[8:00] the fruits in their seasons
[8:02] the wicked men are the jews and the
[8:05] other husbandmen are the gentiles and
[8:07] they render their fruits to jesus in
[8:09] their individual season or church age
[8:13] jesus in luke 21 24
[8:16] and paul teach the times the gentiles
[8:19] have an ending point
[8:20] paul says god will return to offering
[8:22] the jews the holy ghost kingdom when the
[8:25] fullness of the gentiles become in
[8:28] after the last elected foreign gentile
[8:31] saint is sealed by the holy ghost into
[8:33] the kingdom god raptures the bride
[8:35] church and returns to israel
[8:39] another term for the times of the
[8:40] gentiles is the seven church ages
[8:43] because jesus lists seven churches not
[8:46] less or more
[8:47] and his many member gentile bride is
[8:50] called his church on many occasions but
[8:52] most notably in romans 16 verse 16
[8:56] ephesians 3 verse 21 and ephesians 5
[9:00] verses 23 through 32
[9:03] is the term church ages biblically
[9:06] acceptable
[9:07] yes paul twice says the old testament
[9:09] had ages in ephesians 3 verse 5 and
[9:13] colossians 1 verse 26
[9:15] and it's apparent the 2000 year new
[9:18] testament time period does also
[9:21] the apostle speaks of future ages beyond
[9:23] his in ephesians 3 verse 21
[9:27] unto him be glory in the church by
[9:29] christ jesus throughout all ages world
[9:32] without end
[9:34] if there are past and future ages there
[9:37] must always be ages
[9:40] scripture foretells the 2000 year
[9:42] gentile church ages in hosea 6 verses
[9:45] 1-3
[9:47] come and let us return unto the lord for
[9:50] he hath torn and he will heal us he has
[9:53] smitten and he will bind us up after two
[9:56] days will he revive us
[9:58] in the third day he will raise us up and
[10:00] we shall live in his sight
[10:02] then shall we know if we follow on to
[10:04] know the lord his going forth is
[10:06] prepared as the morning and he shall
[10:09] come unto us as the rain as the latter
[10:12] and former rain unto the earth
[10:16] the prophet says god will revive israel
[10:18] on the third day or after two days or
[10:21] two thousand years of dealing with the
[10:22] gentiles
[10:24] one day represents one thousand years in
[10:26] god's sight
[10:28] second peter 3 verse 8 says one day is
[10:31] with the lord as a thousand years and a
[10:33] thousand years as one day
[10:35] god will revive the 144 000 israeli
[10:39] remnant with the seal of the holy ghost
[10:42] after he is done with the raptured
[10:43] gentiles
[10:45] in acts 2 verse 17 peter says the spirit
[10:48] will be poured out in the last days or
[10:50] last 2000 years
[10:52] before the great tribulation and
[10:54] millennium
[10:55] paul says in the last days perilous
[10:57] times shall come and the last two
[10:59] thousand years have been extremely
[11:01] dangerous for christians god has blinded
[11:03] israel for the past two thousand years
[11:05] or two days
[11:07] to graft in the gentiles to take a bride
[11:09] for his name's sake
[11:12] our lord likens the seven gentile church
[11:15] ages unto the seven branches of the
[11:17] golden candlestick moses constructed for
[11:20] the tabernacle in the wilderness in
[11:22] exodus chapter 25.
[11:24] six candlesticks proceeded out of the
[11:26] main central candlestick and all seven
[11:29] had lit fiery wicks drenched in the same
[11:32] oil
[11:33] this foretold every church age would
[11:36] burn with the same holy ghost anointing
[11:38] that fell at pentecost as oil represents
[11:41] the holy ghost in zechariah 4 verses 1
[11:44] through 6.
[11:46] peter guaranteed the oil or gift of the
[11:48] holy ghost was for all seven church ages
[11:52] in acts 2 verses 38 and 39
[11:55] 39 reads for the promise is unto you and
[11:58] to your children and to all them that
[12:00] are far off even as many as the lord our
[12:03] god shall call
[12:05] each successive church age burns
[12:07] brightly with the light of the holy
[12:09] ghost
[12:11] in revelation 1 verses 13 through 16
[12:14] jesus's location standing in the midst
[12:16] of the seven candlesticks with the seven
[12:19] stars in his hand proves his constant
[12:22] presence with the one jew gentile church
[12:25] during the seven church ages
[12:27] observed jesus the stars and the
[12:29] candlesticks are associated together in
[12:32] unity the same jesus in his same holy
[12:35] ghost power would be with every church
[12:37] in every age until the end
[12:40] before christ left his disciples he said
[12:42] lo i am with you alway even unto the end
[12:46] of the world
[12:47] as god's spirit was with the apostles so
[12:50] it is with believers today christ
[12:52] promised the spirit of truth would dwell
[12:54] with us and in us
[12:56] in john 14 17.
[13:00] three applications for the seven letters
[13:04] john seven letters from jesus to the
[13:05] seven gentile churches have at least
[13:08] three applications
[13:09] applying literally prophetically to the
[13:12] future gentile ages and also to
[13:14] individual christians
[13:18] the seven letters applied literally to
[13:20] christians around 95 a.d
[13:24] john 7 letters applied directly to
[13:26] christians living in the seven gentile
[13:28] cities around 95 a.d
[13:31] for example scripture confirms both
[13:34] ephesus and laodicea had established
[13:36] churches in ephesians 1 verse 1 and
[13:39] colossians 2 verse 1 and colossians 4
[13:43] verses 13 through 16 respectively all
[13:46] seven cities have historical routes to
[13:48] christianity
[13:50] one notable example is the council of
[13:51] laodicea held in the 4th century
[13:55] jesus knew the exact spiritual
[13:56] conditions of those churches admonishing
[13:59] some while rebuking others
[14:02] john's letters to the seven asian
[14:04] churches seemed to be jesus's final call
[14:07] for them to repent because all asian
[14:09] churches had rejected paul by the end of
[14:12] his ministry which was around 67 a.d
[14:16] this thou knowest that all they which
[14:18] are in asia be turned away from me of
[14:20] whom are figelus and hermogenus
[14:24] here in 95 a.d the gracious savior gives
[14:27] them one final offer to repent
[14:31] the seven letters were prophetic to
[14:33] future ages
[14:35] second the seven letters were prophetic
[14:37] to the future spiritual conditions of
[14:39] the seven church ages
[14:40] revelation 1 verse 3 declares its
[14:43] prophetic nature blessed is he that
[14:45] readeth and they that hear the words of
[14:46] this prophecy verse 19 of the same
[14:49] chapter repeats this prophetic aspect
[14:52] write the things which thou has seen and
[14:54] the things which are and the things
[14:55] which shall be hereafter here you see
[14:58] how john wrote about the current
[14:59] spiritual conditions of those churches
[15:02] in his lifetime yet they foretold future
[15:05] conditions much of the remainder of this
[15:07] chapter shows the divine parallels
[15:09] between seven cities to the seven future
[15:12] ages christians would live through
[15:15] three clear-cut examples prove the seven
[15:18] letters prophesied of future events and
[15:20] conditions
[15:22] first jesus warned the church in smyrna
[15:24] would have tribulation 10 days but must
[15:27] be faithful unto death in revelation 2
[15:30] verse 10. the 10 days are historically
[15:32] accurate in one or two ways
[15:35] either as the 10 persecutions on the
[15:38] anti-nicean church or diocletian's
[15:41] 10-year persecution
[15:43] beginning with nero and ending with
[15:45] diocletian there were 10 major christian
[15:47] persecutions from 64 a.d to 303 a.d
[15:52] since one day can be symbolic of a year
[15:54] the ten days jesus warned christians
[15:57] about can also be the dreadful
[15:59] decade-long christian persecution
[16:01] initiated by the roman emperor
[16:03] diocletian from 303 to 13 a.d
[16:09] emperor constantine the first is
[16:11] credited with bringing an end to this
[16:13] madness
[16:14] many holy martyrs died but thanks to
[16:16] jesus's warning through john's letter
[16:19] 200 years beforehand their faith unto
[16:21] death attitude inspired christianity to
[16:24] abound even more
[16:27] second jesus foretold there would be an
[16:29] open door missionary age to the church
[16:31] of philadelphia or time period from 1750
[16:35] to 1906 a.d
[16:37] during this age the world saw the
[16:38] greatest missionary efforts through men
[16:41] like william carey in india and david
[16:43] livingstone in africa the final example
[16:46] is the lukewarm condition of the final
[16:48] church of laodicea which represents
[16:50] today's churches falling away from the
[16:52] faith putting jesus spirit outside of
[16:55] their churches
[16:56] this prompted jesus to ask if he would
[16:58] find faith on the earth at his return in
[17:02] luke 18 verse 8
[17:04] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[17:06] shall he find faith on the earth
[17:10] the seven letters speak prophetically to
[17:12] individuals in all ages
[17:16] the third application of the seven
[17:17] letters is they prophetically speak to
[17:19] both individuals and individual churches
[17:22] in every age
[17:24] every honest christian knows what it's
[17:26] like to desire to return to his first
[17:28] love as taught in the ephesian letter
[17:31] thanks to jesus you know how to return
[17:34] do your first works
[17:36] smyrna's letter inspires today's
[17:38] persecuted christians as jesus says i
[17:41] know thy works and tribulation
[17:43] fear none of those things which thou
[17:45] shalt suffer
[17:46] holy ghost-filled saints from all ages
[17:49] have benefited from laodicea's warning
[17:51] about lukewarmness and constantly strive
[17:54] to be on fire for jesus sake
[17:56] of course first john 3 verse 9 teaches
[17:59] that a born-again believer's soul
[18:02] cannot sin or become lukewarm but we
[18:04] become weary and lukewarm in our minds
[18:07] paul and peter admonish us to stir up
[18:10] our minds which means to kindle up in
[18:13] flame one's mind in the greek
[18:16] individual churches today and throughout
[18:18] history have gone through the ephesus to
[18:20] laodicea cycle with ephesus representing
[18:23] the best condition and laodicea the
[18:26] worst you'll soon see how revivals start
[18:28] with great potential but once organized
[18:31] denominated and limited by man god's
[18:34] spirit departs to the next group and the
[18:37] organized group dies
[18:39] true holiness loving churches have and
[18:42] will remain in the ephesus condition
[18:44] breaking the lukewarm cycle keeping
[18:46] jesus as their first love
[18:51] how the star messengers are identified
[18:53] and their names
[18:55] identifying the seven stars or men
[18:58] anointed by the holy ghost to influence
[19:00] each church age over the past two
[19:02] thousand years
[19:04] is done by this principle
[19:06] god and his ways are unchanging
[19:08] hebrews 13 verses 7 and 8 best express
[19:12] this principle
[19:13] remember them which have the rule over
[19:15] you who have spoken unto you the word of
[19:17] god
[19:18] whose faith follow considering the end
[19:21] of their conversation
[19:22] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[19:25] today and forever
[19:27] ecclesiastes 3 verses 14 and 15 agrees
[19:31] saying i know that whatsoever god doeth
[19:34] it shall be forever nothing can be put
[19:37] to it nor anything taken from it and god
[19:40] doeth it that men should fear before him
[19:43] that which hath been is now and that
[19:45] which is to be hath already been and god
[19:48] requireth that which is past
[19:51] and of course malachi 3 verse 6 reads
[19:54] for i am the lord i change not
[19:57] our unchanging god has and always will
[20:01] choose and equip one man to lead and
[20:03] influence the rest of his church age
[20:06] with god's revealed word
[20:07] he is the one major leader who teaches
[20:10] other local leaders who then lead their
[20:12] people
[20:14] paul taught this pattern to timothy in 2
[20:16] timothy 2 verses 1 and 2.
[20:19] thou therefore my son be strong in the
[20:21] grace that is in christ jesus and the
[20:24] things that thou has heard of me among
[20:26] many witnesses the same commit thou to
[20:28] faithful men who shall be able to teach
[20:31] others also
[20:33] indeed he is the star in jesus's
[20:35] nail-scarred hand
[20:38] observing old testament history you find
[20:40] seth leading the way for the godly seed
[20:43] to praise and seek god that lasted until
[20:45] god chose noah to influence his age via
[20:49] warning of oncoming destruction followed
[20:51] by abraham moses and joshua among others
[20:56] even in the days of the judges god
[20:58] followed this pattern when the spirit of
[21:00] the lord came upon athnil to lead israel
[21:03] delivering them from their enemies
[21:06] sadly after the death of each judge
[21:09] israel would backslide into sin and
[21:11] bondage until the people would cry out
[21:13] to god for deliverance
[21:15] graciously the lord would send them
[21:17] another deliverer
[21:19] a similar pattern exists in the new
[21:21] testament church ages
[21:22] as each messenger came on the scene at
[21:25] the beginning of the church age with the
[21:27] purpose of bringing revival to the
[21:29] people and in the later church ages
[21:32] restoration
[21:34] each star messenger meets three
[21:36] requirements exemplified by paul's
[21:38] ministry true teaching of god's word
[21:41] powerful manifestations of the written
[21:43] and spoken word and soul winning
[21:47] using paul's life he was true to the
[21:50] word christ revealed to him even
[21:52] correcting peter when he erroneously
[21:54] disassociated himself from fellowship
[21:57] with gentiles
[21:58] paul said anyone who altered the gospel
[22:00] was accursed and charged timothy to
[22:03] invest all his time in rightly dividing
[22:05] the word of truth
[22:07] any spiritual person according to paul
[22:09] would recognize god's word came to him
[22:12] and thus should be obeyed
[22:14] what came the word of god out from you
[22:16] or came it unto you only if any man
[22:19] think himself to be a prophet or
[22:21] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[22:23] things that i write unto you are the
[22:25] commandments of the lord
[22:28] holy ghost power in the form of the
[22:30] written and spoken word constantly
[22:32] flowed from paul's life as seen in him
[22:35] casting out devils loudly instructing an
[22:38] impotent man to walk for the first time
[22:41] and raising uticus from the dead
[22:43] paul's written word was just as powerful
[22:46] authoring most of the new testament and
[22:48] causing the corinthians to repent in
[22:51] godly sorrow from his written rebukes in
[22:53] 2 corinthians 7 verses 8 through 12
[22:58] no one can calculate how many souls paul
[23:00] led to christ but there is undoubtedly
[23:03] much fruit to his ministry
[23:05] in this area paul knew he was nothing
[23:08] behind the very chiefest apostles having
[23:11] labored more than any other possible
[23:13] through three grueling missionary trips
[23:16] the apostle told his corinthian converts
[23:18] they were the seal of his apostleship in
[23:20] the lord and informed both the
[23:22] philippians and thessalonians they were
[23:25] his joy and crown
[23:27] paul said he had godly jealousy over his
[23:30] converts desiring their chaste virginity
[23:32] to christ while making mention of them
[23:35] in every prayer
[23:37] soul winning mattered more to paul than
[23:39] money and every worldly temptation
[23:43] as church history demonstrates jesus's
[23:45] seven star messengers to each church age
[23:48] who met the three major requirements are
[23:51] ephesus paul 5 to 67 a.d
[23:56] smyrna iranius
[23:58] 130 to 202 a.d
[24:02] pergamos
[24:03] martin
[24:04] 315 to 399 a.d
[24:08] thyatira columba
[24:10] 521 to 597 a.d
[24:14] sardis martin luther 1483 to 1546 a.d
[24:21] philadelphia
[24:23] john wesley
[24:24] 1703
[24:26] to 1791 a.d
[24:29] laodicea william branham 1909
[24:33] to 1965 a.d
[24:38] how the dates and lengths of the church
[24:40] ages are determined
[24:42] the following dates and lengths of the
[24:44] seven church ages are approximate
[24:46] determined by matching jesus's seven
[24:49] city descriptions with major events in
[24:52] church history
[24:53] figure 19 shows clarence larkin and
[24:55] william branham agree on most dates and
[24:58] lengths with slight differences between
[25:01] ephesus philadelphia and laodicea
[25:04] note also the star messengers ministered
[25:07] during the beginning of their respective
[25:08] church ages as proof of god's
[25:11] longsuffering allowing time for their
[25:13] revivals and revelations to fully spread
[25:17] the ephesian church age lasted from
[25:19] about 53 a.d to 170 a.d
[25:23] its starting point was paul's three-year
[25:25] ministry in ephesus in which many
[25:28] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[25:30] the ephesian church was founded on
[25:32] paul's third missionary journey along
[25:34] with churches in philippi thessalonica
[25:37] berea and corinth among others
[25:40] detailed in acts chapters 16-20
[25:45] ephesus means permitted in the greek and
[25:48] larkin adds the synonymous phrase to
[25:50] relax to its definition which matches
[25:53] jesus's main concern for this age this
[25:56] age started in great zeal but decades
[25:58] later many left their first love
[26:02] the sumerian church age began around 170
[26:05] a.d and ended about 312 a.d
[26:09] smyrna means myrrh in the greek
[26:12] which speaks to mer's use as a costly
[26:14] perfume and embalming antiseptic mer's
[26:18] connection with death aligns perfectly
[26:20] with jesus's prophecy that this time
[26:23] period would be an age of martyrs
[26:25] be thou faithful unto death and i will
[26:27] give thee a crown of life
[26:30] this age fittingly began with the
[26:32] martyrdom of justin martyr and his six
[26:34] disciples and ended with the gruesome
[26:37] 10-year christian persecution under
[26:40] diocletian beginning in 303
[26:44] the pergamine age lasted from around 312
[26:47] a.d to about 606 a.d
[26:50] it began with emperor constantine the
[26:52] first
[26:53] reign over the western empire which
[26:56] later expanded to the entire roman
[26:58] empire in 324 a.d
[27:01] as jesus foretold in revelation 2 verse
[27:03] 14
[27:04] many in this age would succumb to an
[27:07] unholy religious union similar to the
[27:10] one of balaam and balak the union of
[27:13] church and state
[27:14] false christianity in rome united with
[27:17] constantine who stopped christian
[27:19] persecution
[27:20] donated property to christians and had
[27:22] many churches constructed
[27:24] however he remained a murderer as he had
[27:27] his eldest son and wife killed after his
[27:30] supposed conversion
[27:32] constantine's conversion to christianity
[27:34] then was likely false and incomplete
[27:38] the thighterian age was the longest age
[27:41] beginning around 606 a.d and finishing
[27:44] about 1520 a.d
[27:47] thyatira means odor of affliction in the
[27:49] greek and christian persecution long
[27:52] lingered during the dark or middle ages
[27:55] pope boniface iii's acceptance of the
[27:58] title universal bishop in 606 a.d
[28:02] signaled the beginning of the darkest
[28:04] time period in church history
[28:06] as the jezebel spirit took the roman
[28:08] church to the depths of satan through
[28:11] fornication idolatry and many more
[28:14] doctrines of devils
[28:16] it is my humble opinion that the
[28:18] thyrotyrin age began earlier though
[28:21] around 560 a.d
[28:23] in order to allow for its star messenger
[28:25] columba to have labor during its time
[28:28] period
[28:29] additionally a holy ghost and power
[28:31] movement in frygea from 560 to 565
[28:36] resembled the day of pentecost as all
[28:39] nine gifts of the spirit were honored
[28:41] and operated
[28:42] it seems likely thyatira began with a
[28:45] revival just as laodicea began with the
[28:48] 1906 azusa street revival
[28:52] the sardis church age began around 1520
[28:55] a.d and stopped about 1750 a.d
[28:59] on october 30th 1517 martin luther
[29:02] nailed his 95 theses to the church door
[29:06] in wittenberg germany beginning the
[29:08] protestant reformation period
[29:10] but it was three years later in 1520
[29:13] when he published three great documents
[29:15] which laid down the fundamental
[29:17] principles of the reformers
[29:19] as jesus said only a few names in sardis
[29:22] had not defiled their garments this was
[29:25] a difficult age
[29:26] wherein many fell away from their faith
[29:28] after the deaths of reformers like
[29:30] luther zwingli and calvin
[29:35] the time period of brotherly love the
[29:37] philadelphian age started around 1750
[29:40] a.d and lasted until 1906 a.d
[29:44] this age labeled as the open door age by
[29:47] christ saw men like george whitfield
[29:50] john wesley william carey and david
[29:53] livingstone evangelized the world
[29:55] teaching saints to keep jesus's word
[29:58] name and patience
[30:00] just as seasons slowly transitioned from
[30:02] one to the next the philadelphian age
[30:05] had a first sign of spring in 1739 when
[30:08] whitefield's first american preaching
[30:11] tour providentially and supernaturally
[30:14] began in philadelphia pennsylvania
[30:18] the final and current age laodicea began
[30:21] around 1906 and continues today with the
[30:24] rapture as its unknown ending point
[30:27] the 1906 azusa street revival indicated
[30:30] a new age as the gifts of the spirit
[30:33] were restored as god promised in joel 2
[30:36] 25
[30:38] and i'll restore to you the years that
[30:40] the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and
[30:43] the caterpillar and the palmer worm my
[30:45] great army which i sent among you
[30:48] sadly pentecostals in all denominations
[30:51] and independence have grown lukewarm
[30:53] upon jesus's word and spirit wanting no
[30:56] more bible revelation and kicking jesus
[30:59] out of their churches
[31:01] yet our merciful messiah still stands at
[31:04] their doors knocking trying to enter
[31:07] with loving rebukes chastening and
[31:09] fellowship
[31:12] the gaining losing and restoring of
[31:15] truth during the church ages
[31:17] before digging into specific church
[31:19] history by age it's imperative to see
[31:22] god's design for giving and restoring
[31:24] truth to the seven church ages
[31:27] although god is unchanging he never said
[31:29] the church was
[31:31] no the church would have change because
[31:33] it would be persecuted afflicted and
[31:35] tested but this was done to strengthen
[31:37] the faithful few allowing them to truly
[31:40] know christ in the power of his
[31:42] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[31:44] sufferings
[31:45] since the church loved christ and wanted
[31:48] to reign with him it was necessary for
[31:50] her to suffer like him
[31:53] the seven stars or messengers are called
[31:56] thus because of the profound spiritual
[31:58] darkness upon the earth
[32:00] jesus specifically called paul the star
[32:02] messenger to the ephesian age a light to
[32:05] the gentiles to turn them from darkness
[32:08] to light
[32:09] spiritual darkness or life under satan's
[32:12] power has covered earth since the fall
[32:15] as he is the god of this world
[32:17] but due to increased iniquity and
[32:19] deception darkness grows increasingly
[32:22] black during the spiritual nighttime of
[32:24] the past 2000 years of gentile church
[32:27] ages
[32:28] remember the end time is a spiritual
[32:30] blackout as revelation 18 verse 3 and 18
[32:35] verse 23 say all nations will be
[32:37] deceived by the beast and false prophets
[32:40] religious system in every age though
[32:43] jesus promised his followers light in
[32:45] john 8 verse 12 i am the light of the
[32:48] world he that followeth me shall not
[32:50] walk in darkness but shall have the
[32:52] light of life
[32:55] scripture proves the early church began
[32:57] with the full written word and power of
[32:59] the holy ghost and the final true church
[33:02] in the laodicean age albeit a very small
[33:05] minority will have it all restored
[33:07] before the rapture logically in between
[33:11] the beginning and end would be a time
[33:13] where the church lacked the fullness of
[33:15] word and power
[33:17] holy ghost power was at its fullness at
[33:20] pentecost for not long afterwards the
[33:22] spirit led peter to pronounce a lame man
[33:25] healed peter said silver and gold have i
[33:28] none but such as i have give i thee in
[33:31] the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[33:33] rise up and walk
[33:35] peter had divine power given to him by
[33:38] jesus
[33:39] joyfully the healed man leaped walked
[33:42] and praised god and these types of
[33:44] miracles followed all the apostles for
[33:46] they were given great power as witnesses
[33:49] of the resurrection of the lord jesus
[33:52] peter later wrote that god had given
[33:54] believers not some but all things that
[33:56] pertain unto life and godliness
[33:59] before leaving ephesus after a
[34:01] three-year apostleship there paul said
[34:04] he had declared to them all the counsel
[34:06] of god in acts 20 verse 27
[34:09] while not all churches had all of paul's
[34:11] epistles the four gospels and the rest
[34:14] of the new testament canon at first the
[34:17] born-again believers had the holy ghost
[34:19] baptism
[34:20] which jesus said guided them into all
[34:22] truth in john 16 13.
[34:26] before jesus returns to rapture his
[34:28] bride he must restore all things the
[34:31] church had at pentecost
[34:32] jesus was the first to prophesy this end
[34:35] time restoration in matthew 17 verse 11
[34:39] and jesus answered and said unto them
[34:41] elias truly shall first come and restore
[34:44] all things
[34:46] note that jesus says a man anointed with
[34:48] the spirit of elijah would restore all
[34:50] things
[34:51] this man could not be elijah the
[34:53] tishbite back from the dead to restore
[34:55] moses law because hebrews 8 13 says the
[34:59] law has decayed waxed old and vanished
[35:02] away for good the elijah jesus is
[35:05] speaking of then has to restore the new
[35:07] testament truths
[35:08] chapter 13 details this revelation
[35:12] peter also prophesied of restitution or
[35:15] restoration
[35:16] in acts 3 verses 20 through 21
[35:19] and he shall send jesus christ which
[35:22] before was preached unto you whom the
[35:24] heaven must receive until the times of
[35:26] restitution of all things which god has
[35:29] spoken by the mouth of all his holy
[35:31] prophets since the world began heaven
[35:34] will keep jesus until all things are
[35:36] restored then christ will physically
[35:38] return to earth for his bride
[35:42] joel 2 verses 23-26
[35:44] promises that the power of the holy
[35:46] ghost will be restored through the
[35:48] spiritual wine and oil of the former and
[35:51] latter reigns
[35:53] be glad then ye children of zion and
[35:55] rejoice in the lord your god for he hath
[35:58] given you the former rain moderately and
[36:00] he will cause to come down for you the
[36:03] rain the former rain and the laddering
[36:05] in the first month
[36:07] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[36:09] the vats shall overflow with wine and
[36:12] oil and i'll restore to you the years
[36:14] that the locust hath eaten the
[36:16] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[36:19] palmer worm my great army which i sent
[36:21] among you and ye shall eat in plenty and
[36:24] be satisfied and praise the name of the
[36:27] lord your god that hath dealt wondrously
[36:29] with you and my people shall never be
[36:32] ashamed
[36:34] furthermore combining daniel 12 verse 4
[36:37] and 12 verse 9 with revelation 10 verses
[36:41] 7 through 11 and matthew 24 14
[36:44] you find full support for the same
[36:47] conclusion the end of human history
[36:49] cannot come until the mystery of god is
[36:52] finished and preached in all the world
[36:54] for witness unto all nations
[36:57] this can only happen in the technology
[36:59] age for daniel said the book would be
[37:02] sealed until the time of the end when
[37:04] knowledge shall be increased
[37:07] in between the beginning and end of the
[37:09] seven church ages would be a time of
[37:11] loss
[37:12] ecclesiastes 3 verse 6 teaches there is
[37:15] a time to get and a time to lose
[37:18] many truths and the glory from pentecost
[37:20] would fade in the first four ages but
[37:23] restoration would begin in the fifth and
[37:25] sixth
[37:26] jesus says the believers in the fourth
[37:28] age thyatira would have to overcome the
[37:31] depths of satan proving this age was a
[37:34] low point of truth and power
[37:36] just as john 12 24 likens jesus unto a
[37:40] corn of wheat that had to fall into the
[37:42] ground and die
[37:43] in order to bring forth more fruit the
[37:46] true church would experience the same
[37:48] it would slowly die and lose truth and
[37:51] power through the first four ages but in
[37:53] the fifth age the sardisian age of the
[37:56] reformation the seed would spring forth
[37:58] in strength as god began incrementally
[38:02] restoring truth
[38:03] then in the final age the laodicean age
[38:06] all things would be restored
[38:09] reading revelation chapters 2 and 3 you
[38:12] see jesus addressing two vines or two
[38:14] groups in every age
[38:16] workers of righteousness and workers of
[38:18] iniquity both are religious but only the
[38:21] righteous true vine overcomes satan's
[38:24] temptations throughout the ages
[38:28] starting with the ephesian age most
[38:30] worshipers left their first love and
[38:32] needed to repent
[38:34] but the true vine hated the deeds of the
[38:36] nicolaitans that the religious false
[38:39] vine had adopted in the second age jesus
[38:42] instructed the true vine in smyrna to
[38:45] not fear the persecution coming from the
[38:47] false vine
[38:48] the false church progressed from hateful
[38:50] deeds into a full synagogue for satan
[38:54] the third age pergamos shows jesus
[38:56] having a few things not just one thing
[38:59] against the true vine showing their
[39:01] decline in faith
[39:03] meanwhile the false vine had fully
[39:05] erected a seat for satan
[39:08] in the third tyran age the fourth age
[39:11] containing the dark ages the true vine
[39:13] increased their works but christ still
[39:15] had a few things against them such as
[39:17] allowing the jezebel spirit to teach and
[39:20] seduce his servants
[39:22] jesus simply said hold fast what they
[39:24] already had they had lost much of what
[39:27] pentecost had had and it was not the
[39:29] hour for restoration
[39:31] the false vines jezebel-like doctrines
[39:34] took it into the depths of satan making
[39:36] this the darkest age of all
[39:39] it is undeniable that rome took away the
[39:41] privilege of simply knowing and reading
[39:43] scripture from millions alexander hislop
[39:46] writes in the hands of roman priests
[39:49] that ushered in the dark ages when
[39:51] through many a dreary century the gospel
[39:54] was unknown and the bible a sealed book
[39:57] to millions who bore the name of christ
[40:00] thyatira was an age of great loss
[40:04] the fifth age sardis begins a hopeful
[40:07] restoration for the believing remnant
[40:09] known as the reformation
[40:11] the reformation was possible because the
[40:13] gutenberg press produced millions of
[40:16] bibles translated by godly men and
[40:18] placed truth in many believers hands for
[40:21] the first time
[40:23] jesus admonishes a few worthy undefiled
[40:26] saints to be watchful strengthen the
[40:28] things which remain hold fast and to
[40:31] repent
[40:32] notice jesus saying there are only a few
[40:34] worthy believers in the entire age
[40:37] proving the massive decrease of true
[40:39] believers
[40:40] the false vine adopted religious names
[40:43] but were spiritually dead
[40:45] there was more growth or truth in the
[40:48] sixth age the philadelphian age
[40:50] for the true vine had a little strength
[40:52] to walk through jesus's open door and
[40:55] work for his name
[40:56] believers kept jesus's word and name and
[40:59] christ made the false vine in satan's
[41:01] synagogue bow at the feet of their open
[41:04] door ministry
[41:07] the last stage laodicea sees a huge
[41:10] spiritual decline into materialism and
[41:12] lukewarmness and the false vine removes
[41:15] jesus from their churches altogether
[41:17] christ urges the true vine to zealously
[41:20] repent these overcomers inspired by the
[41:23] message of restoration by spiritual gold
[41:26] and white raiment from jesus and anoint
[41:29] their eyes with eyes out to become hot
[41:31] or on fire for christ right before the
[41:34] rapture
[41:37] historical evidence and revelations for
[41:39] the seven stars and seven golden
[41:41] candlesticks
[41:44] the church history of the past two
[41:45] thousand years validates and parallels
[41:48] jesus's prophetic promises regarding the
[41:51] seven church ages
[41:52] in jesus's seven addresses he reveals
[41:55] aspects of his divinity his messages to
[41:58] both vines and rewards for the
[42:00] overcomers
[42:03] the ephesian church age 53 to 170
[42:07] in revelation 2 verses 1-7
[42:10] star
[42:12] paul is the angel star to the first age
[42:14] he identified 9 out of 12 mysteries and
[42:17] authored 14 of the 27 new testament
[42:20] books
[42:21] far more than any other man first
[42:23] corinthians 15 verse 10 says god's grace
[42:26] enabled paul to labor more than any
[42:29] other apostle
[42:30] jesus was going to use paul's gospel to
[42:33] judge the secrets of men and curses come
[42:35] upon anyone who changes the gospel
[42:38] christ gave to him
[42:40] not only did peter submit to paul's
[42:42] face-to-face rebuke about his
[42:44] discrimination against gentiles
[42:46] but peter acknowledged paul's letters
[42:48] were scripture in second peter 3 verses
[42:51] 15 and 16.
[42:54] some may argue that paul cannot be the
[42:56] angel to this age because he wasn't
[42:58] alive at the time jesus gave this
[43:00] revelation to john around 95 a.d
[43:04] while it is true that paul died around
[43:06] 67 a.d his legacy is immeasurable
[43:09] far exceeding any other man due to his
[43:12] mission work and doctrinal revelations
[43:14] also god often sends messengers who are
[43:17] not recognized until after they die as
[43:20] in the case of john the baptist
[43:22] jesus told his disciples that elias or
[43:25] john the baptist had already come and
[43:27] they had not recognized him in matthew
[43:29] 17 verses 12 and 13.
[43:32] it would fit jesus's pattern to send
[43:34] paul as an angel messenger but not make
[43:37] it known to others until after paul went
[43:40] to heaven
[43:42] as evidence paul is the star messenger
[43:44] to this age his epistles teach exactly
[43:47] the same message jesus gives to the true
[43:50] vine in this age
[43:51] work and labor for christ
[43:53] flee all appearances of evil hate evil
[43:57] test self-labeled apostles to prove them
[44:00] be patient repent and renew yourself
[44:03] daily
[44:05] christ divinity
[44:07] jesus begins his address to his churches
[44:09] by showing his omnipotence omnipresence
[44:12] and sovereignty
[44:14] he holds the seven star angels in his
[44:16] right hand
[44:17] symbolizing the authority and power he
[44:19] has given them
[44:20] god's son walks in the midst of the
[44:22] seven golden candlesticks
[44:24] showing his unchanging presence in every
[44:27] age
[44:28] as he says in hebrews 13 verse 5 i will
[44:30] never leave thee nor forsake thee
[44:33] he is with you just as he was with paul
[44:36] peter and all other saints
[44:40] message to the true vine
[44:42] our lord tells this age he knows their
[44:44] works tireless labor and patience for
[44:47] his name's sake
[44:48] the true vine could not bear evil ones
[44:51] and tried self-exalted liars and found
[44:54] them to be false apostles
[44:56] in love christ rebukes his church for
[44:58] leaving their first love but provides
[45:00] the simple way back repentance through
[45:02] doing the first works
[45:05] just as paul's ministry matches jesus's
[45:08] message to the ephesian age the life of
[45:10] polycarp 60 to 160 the greek bishop does
[45:15] the same
[45:16] learning at the feet of the apostle john
[45:18] polikarp deeply loved our lord jesus and
[45:21] became head of the church at smyrna at a
[45:23] young age
[45:26] polycarp could not bear false teachers
[45:28] and tried them as he would not even talk
[45:30] with marcion and valentinian who were
[45:33] the great roman leaders of false
[45:35] doctrine at the time even at 90 years of
[45:38] age polycarp determined to travel more
[45:40] than 1 500 miles to plead with anicetus
[45:45] the bishop of the first church in rome
[45:48] to repent of his participation in pagan
[45:50] easter celebrations
[45:52] in every city he visited while
[45:54] approaching rome he preached christ and
[45:56] saw miracles and healings
[45:59] once in rome polycarp visited the first
[46:02] church and witnessed their worship of
[46:04] images peter and the eucharist
[46:07] after anaicetus refused correction
[46:10] palakkar visited the second and third
[46:12] churches of rome and saw god pour out
[46:14] rome's last recorded revival
[46:17] the sick were healed demons cast out and
[46:20] dead were raised to life
[46:21] before leaving polycarp also brought
[46:24] many of the straying valentinians and
[46:27] the martianites out of false doctrine
[46:29] and into truth their first love
[46:33] polycarp returned to smyrna and
[46:35] eventually turned himself into the
[46:37] pagans demanding his life in order to
[46:40] spare other christians lives he was
[46:42] burned to death and as a testimony of
[46:44] how christ-like polycarp was
[46:47] the pagans would not allow his disciples
[46:49] to have his corpse because they said the
[46:51] disciples would claim he had revived and
[46:53] raised from the dead like the master
[46:56] christ
[46:57] at jerusalem
[46:58] so they flayed the flesh from the bones
[47:00] then ground the bones to powder and cast
[47:03] the ashes over a running stream
[47:06] yet the true vine had to diligently
[47:08] examine itself to be sure it was keeping
[47:10] its first love
[47:12] edmund broadbent writes
[47:14] as the churches increased the first zeal
[47:16] flagged and conformity to the world and
[47:19] its ways increased also
[47:22] every age must battle and overcome
[47:24] spiritual complacency
[47:26] in 156 a.d montanus who might have been
[47:30] saved under polycarp's ministry
[47:32] protested against the prevailing laxity
[47:35] in the relations of the church to the
[47:37] world
[47:38] the true vine repented and did the first
[47:40] works to return to their first love
[47:44] iniquity of the false vine
[47:46] by satan's design vast numbers of lying
[47:49] false prophets rose up in the first age
[47:52] as john recognized there were many
[47:54] antichrists in 1st john 2 verse 18.
[47:58] though jesus called for their repentance
[48:00] the false vine grew in sinful hateful
[48:03] deeds
[48:05] after first receiving the gospel around
[48:07] 36 a.d from the apostles andronicus and
[48:10] junia the first church in rome fell away
[48:13] during a 13-year period 41-54 a.d
[48:18] in which faithful apostles were banned
[48:20] from the city
[48:21] with the faithful expelled worship of
[48:24] baal and ashtaroth flourished in the
[48:26] midst of the lukewarm church members
[48:29] when the apostles returned the pagan
[48:31] infused church repulsed them
[48:33] consequently jesus removed his
[48:35] candlestick or spirit-filled preaching
[48:38] ministry from the first church in rome
[48:41] as he had warned
[48:43] in this ephesian age jesus says he and
[48:46] the true vine hate the deeds of the
[48:48] nicolaitans
[48:50] observe these are deeds
[48:51] which are defined as acts undertakings
[48:54] in the greek lexicon
[48:56] these common undetected deeds would
[48:59] later advance to become official
[49:01] universal doctrines in the pergamian age
[49:04] revelation 2 verse 15
[49:07] but in the first age satan deceived
[49:09] immature believers with seemingly
[49:11] harmless deeds
[49:14] the word nicolaitans might refer to a
[49:17] heretical group who followed a man named
[49:19] nicholas who were given over to
[49:21] prostitution
[49:22] but i found only one reference for this
[49:24] theory
[49:25] one certain meaning is found in the
[49:27] greek meaning of nicolas which is victor
[49:30] of the people satan will get victory
[49:32] over the people through religious
[49:34] leaders legalizing sinful deeds in
[49:37] churches
[49:38] jesus warned this age that the majority
[49:41] of religious people would be conquered
[49:43] by allowing sinful deeds into their
[49:46] worship
[49:47] james 1 verses 14 and 15 lists sin's
[49:50] progression
[49:52] but every man is tempted when he is
[49:54] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[49:57] then when lust hath conceived it
[49:59] bringeth forth sin
[50:01] and sin when it is finished bringeth
[50:03] forth death
[50:05] beginning in 41 a.d the first church of
[50:08] rome slowly and consistently added pagan
[50:11] deeds into their worship until they
[50:13] rejected the traditional holy passover
[50:16] observance fully embracing the pagan
[50:18] easter feast of ishtar when polycarp
[50:21] arrived around 150 a.d
[50:24] the faithful bishop also detested their
[50:27] wicked deeds of idolizing statues and
[50:30] eucharist worship
[50:32] the evil deed of changing water baptism
[50:35] since there is only one baptism
[50:37] also took place in the ephesian age as
[50:40] the first century document the ddj
[50:43] records
[50:44] the document seventh chapter removes the
[50:46] name of the lord jesus christ at baptism
[50:49] substituting the titles in the name of
[50:52] the father and of the son and of the
[50:54] holy spirit
[50:55] five examples from the book of acts show
[50:57] baptism should be performed in the
[50:59] literal name of the lord jesus christ
[51:02] the ddj also adds the false deed of
[51:05] pouring water or sprinkling at baptism
[51:08] but scripture shows only full immersion
[51:10] in water is god's acceptable baptismal
[51:13] deed
[51:14] truly changing one word about water
[51:16] baptism would eventually lead to many
[51:19] more doctrinal changes causing spiritual
[51:21] death in the false vine
[51:24] the devil also conquered the people by
[51:26] the deed of exalting the clergy above
[51:29] the laity
[51:30] clergymen were given more power than
[51:32] allotted by god
[51:34] ignatius who died early in the second
[51:36] century erd by giving to the bishop of
[51:39] prominence and authority not only
[51:41] unknown in the new testament but also
[51:43] beyond what was claimed by clement
[51:46] hebrews 13 verses 7 and 8 and 13 17
[51:51] teach god called men rule in the church
[51:54] but only by the revealed word of god the
[51:56] bible
[51:57] however men in the ephesian age had
[51:59] already begun leading by their own
[52:02] tenants rather than the word and jesus
[52:04] hated it
[52:06] the reward
[52:07] jesus promises overcomers in the
[52:09] ephesian age the blessing of eating from
[52:12] the tree of life in the midst of the
[52:14] paradise of god
[52:16] in the new jerusalem christ the tree of
[52:18] life will give his words for food as a
[52:21] spiritual partaking of the one and only
[52:23] life eternal life
[52:26] justin martyr will enjoy the reward of
[52:28] eating from the tree of life
[52:30] like spring blends into summer the
[52:32] church ages gradually overlap as seen
[52:35] through justin's martyrdom around 165
[52:38] a.d
[52:39] as the ephesian age transitioned into
[52:42] the sumerian the foretold persecution
[52:44] increased justin and his six disciples
[52:48] boldly defied the emperor and were
[52:50] beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to
[52:52] the gods
[52:53] being threatened with death justin
[52:56] overcame with these words
[52:58] through prayer we can be saved on
[53:00] account of our lord jesus christ
[53:02] even when we have been punished because
[53:04] this shall become to us salvation and
[53:07] confidence at the more fearful and
[53:09] universal judgment seat of our lord and
[53:12] savior
[53:15] the sumerian church age 170-312
[53:19] in revelation 2 verses 8 through 11
[53:22] star
[53:24] irenaeus is the star messenger to the
[53:26] second age he was born in greece and
[53:29] became the bishop of lions having
[53:31] learned the gospel from polycarp
[53:33] hazeltine writes the churches in france
[53:36] had all the gifts of the holy spirit
[53:37] operating through iranius's teaching
[53:40] including speaking in tongues healings
[53:43] and miracles such as the dead being
[53:45] raised
[53:47] it is important to note iranians had the
[53:50] true understanding of the godhead which
[53:52] would soon be lost even to genuine
[53:54] believers until its restoration in the
[53:56] end time
[53:57] irania said god was not beings but one
[54:00] being with numerous titles
[54:03] all the other expressions likewise bring
[54:05] out the title of one and the same being
[54:09] as for example the lord of powers the
[54:11] father of all god almighty the most high
[54:15] the creator the maker and such like
[54:18] these are not the names and titles of a
[54:20] succession of different beings but of
[54:22] one and the same by means of which the
[54:25] one god and father is revealed he who
[54:27] contains all things and grants to all
[54:30] the boon of existence
[54:32] the sumerian star is known for
[54:35] perpetually resisting the bishops of
[54:37] rome like victor and zephariinus because
[54:40] of their idolatrous practices
[54:43] irenaeus combated many heresies and
[54:45] authored one celebrated an extremely
[54:48] influential tract called against
[54:50] heresies john fox on page 717 of his
[54:55] classic text fox's book of martyrs
[54:58] said iranius's writings pointed to no
[55:01] transubstantiation concerning the lord's
[55:03] supper
[55:05] irenaeus's battle against victor bishop
[55:07] of the first church in rome
[55:09] to keep easter a pure worship feast led
[55:12] to his martyrdom
[55:14] victor influenced septimius cerverus to
[55:17] behead iranians in 202 a.d
[55:22] iranis teachings on authentic
[55:24] christianity salvation the gifts of the
[55:26] spirit and godhead
[55:28] along with his staunch stand against the
[55:31] first roman church make him an obvious
[55:33] choice for star of the sumernian age
[55:37] christ's divinity
[55:39] our lord builds upon his divine
[55:40] description by saying he is the first
[55:43] and the last which was dead and is alive
[55:47] jesus reveals his deity to submirna
[55:49] showing he was before all things as the
[55:52] beginning of the creation of god
[55:54] jesus is the one true god and there is
[55:56] none beside him trust jesus because he
[55:59] existed before you he preserves your
[56:02] life now and he promises you grace for
[56:04] the day of judgment and a home in the
[56:06] new jerusalem for the last eternal day
[56:10] the messiah says he was dead but is now
[56:12] alive
[56:13] he resurrected conquering the grave in
[56:16] order to give us both a natural and a
[56:18] spiritual resurrection
[56:20] if we die before the rapture our bodies
[56:22] will rise in resurrection power at the
[56:24] meeting in the air but jesus offers a
[56:27] spiritual resurrection now
[56:29] paul says christ resurrects our lives
[56:32] which were dead in sins and trespasses
[56:34] making us sit together in heavenly
[56:36] places in christ jesus
[56:39] jesus describes it best in his parable
[56:42] of the prodigal son returning to the
[56:44] father's house
[56:45] thy brother was dead and is alive again
[56:48] and was lost
[56:49] and is found
[56:52] you can be alive now spiritually with a
[56:54] promise for your body to live again in
[56:57] the first resurrection
[57:00] message to the true vine
[57:02] christ knows the works tribulation and
[57:05] poverty of this age and tells the saints
[57:08] to be faithful unto death
[57:10] the lord says fear not those things
[57:12] which thou shalt suffer which includes a
[57:14] 10-day period of tribulation
[57:18] jesus's timely warning of persecution
[57:21] fits smyrna since it means myrrh in the
[57:23] greek
[57:24] myrrh is a gum associated with death
[57:27] being used for embalming dead bodies and
[57:29] mingled with wine and offered to the
[57:31] dying
[57:32] this was the age of increased martyrdom
[57:34] jesus says be faithful unto death not
[57:37] until death
[57:39] emphasizing many believers would have to
[57:41] seal their testimony as martyrs
[57:44] although the first church of rome was
[57:46] growing in corruption and evil power
[57:49] god's anointing strengthened many to
[57:51] resist unto death and overcome torture
[57:54] men like erranus tertullian origen and
[57:58] novatianus are credited with defying
[58:01] rome's iniquity and they often paid the
[58:03] price with their blood being faithful
[58:05] unto
[58:06] death tertullian 155 to 230 a.d
[58:12] was a lawyer in rome before being
[58:14] converted through the evangelistic
[58:16] efforts of the second church of rome
[58:18] he saw the evangelist montanus and his
[58:21] disciples performed miracles in a holy
[58:24] ghost revival
[58:25] this experience led tertullian to
[58:27] receive the holy ghost baptism during
[58:29] that time after his new birth tertullian
[58:32] influenced believers through teaching
[58:34] and writing and in 197 he condemned
[58:37] baptizing the dead and baptizing infants
[58:40] tertullian took the bishop brick in
[58:42] carthage around 207 separating from rome
[58:46] and its challenges and became a great
[58:48] leader in the african churches
[58:51] while visiting one of tertullian's
[58:53] prayer meetings navocianus received the
[58:56] pentecostal gift of the holy ghost which
[58:58] changed the whole course of his life
[59:00] another visitor origen met with
[59:03] tertullian before going to rome in hopes
[59:05] of restoring them to the apostolic
[59:07] ministry
[59:09] on origen's trip home from rome he
[59:11] informed tertullian an even worse
[59:13] spiritual condition existed in rome than
[59:16] he had previous thought due to their
[59:18] adoption of many pagan customs
[59:22] tertullian believed the church should be
[59:23] holy and clean zealous of good works
[59:26] he even traveled to france to plead for
[59:28] iranius's life though unsuccessfully the
[59:32] first church of rome called tertullian a
[59:34] heretic for frequently exposing their
[59:37] devilish doctrines in his writings which
[59:39] were burned by rome not long after his
[59:41] death
[59:43] not all of tertullian's doctrines are
[59:45] accepted by christians such as the
[59:47] three-person trinity
[59:49] around 180 tertullian was first recorded
[59:52] using the latin form of trinity
[59:54] and theophilus was first to use the
[59:56] greek form
[59:58] calling god three persons does not
[1:00:00] eternally condemn a person's soul
[1:00:02] but it does show a huge step out of
[1:00:04] god's word and the original revelation
[1:00:06] given to paul and all other new
[1:00:08] testament authors
[1:00:10] however it is undeniable that tertullian
[1:00:13] defied rome's pagan corruption
[1:00:15] inspired many believers to live holy and
[1:00:18] pleaded for the life of this age's star
[1:00:21] irenaeus tertullian stumble into the
[1:00:23] unscriptural belief in a three-person
[1:00:25] god is evidence that each age lost some
[1:00:28] of the original apostolic revelation
[1:00:31] like a withering wheat plant but in this
[1:00:33] current laodicean age god has restored
[1:00:35] the revelation of his divine oneness
[1:00:39] origin 185 185-254
[1:00:43] is called one of the greatest teachers
[1:00:45] as one of the most spiritually minded of
[1:00:47] the fathers
[1:00:48] at 17 years old he witnessed his
[1:00:50] father's arrest and martyrdom for christ
[1:00:53] and would have joined him had it not
[1:00:55] been for his mother who hid his clothes
[1:00:58] to keep him from leaving his house
[1:01:01] on a trip to rome he witnessed filthy
[1:01:03] deeds firsthand like bishops and priests
[1:01:06] taking bribes to forgive sins blackmail
[1:01:09] adulteries and more
[1:01:11] origen wrote
[1:01:13] rome did not wish to retain the
[1:01:14] scriptures in their hearts so god gave
[1:01:16] them a strong delusion that they might
[1:01:18] believe a lie
[1:01:20] a great gift origin left to the churches
[1:01:23] was his list of martyrs in rome peter's
[1:01:25] name is not on the list giving many
[1:01:28] confidence that peter was not the first
[1:01:30] pope
[1:01:32] like tertullian some of origin's beliefs
[1:01:35] are denounced by christians today but he
[1:01:37] sealed his testimony as a martyr at
[1:01:39] tyree and upon his death his writing on
[1:01:42] rome's martyrs became very precious to
[1:01:45] the saints second in their hearts behind
[1:01:47] the word of god
[1:01:50] novatianus
[1:01:52] 189-253 was an evangelical christian who
[1:01:55] opposed the pagan forms of the bishop of
[1:01:58] the first roman church he became bishop
[1:02:01] of the second church of rome ordained by
[1:02:03] another martyr fabian
[1:02:05] god bless their church with tongues
[1:02:07] prophecy and the dead being raised to
[1:02:09] life cyprian was one of his adversaries
[1:02:13] accusing novatianus of forsaking the
[1:02:15] mother church or first church of rome
[1:02:19] the power of the holy ghost was changing
[1:02:21] lives in rome's second church and the
[1:02:23] first church of rome despised it they
[1:02:26] called on the emperors to rid the city
[1:02:28] of novatianus and god's move which was
[1:02:31] accomplished in 251 novatianus and his
[1:02:34] church fled but god used it to spread
[1:02:37] his gospel to the far corners of the
[1:02:39] empire with novatianus's apostle heart
[1:02:42] he helped start evangelical churches all
[1:02:45] over the roman empire in 253
[1:02:48] novatianus gave his life for jesus
[1:02:50] christ earning the martyr's crown of
[1:02:53] eternal life
[1:02:55] iniquity of the false vine
[1:02:57] jesus summarizes the false vines
[1:02:59] iniquity by rebuking their blasphemy
[1:03:02] synagogue of satan
[1:03:04] imprisonments trials and 10-day
[1:03:07] persecution of the saints
[1:03:10] like the nicolaitans of the first age
[1:03:12] and antipas of the third age there is
[1:03:15] little historical information about the
[1:03:17] lying group of false jews of this second
[1:03:19] age
[1:03:20] however jesus says they the false fine
[1:03:23] were claiming to be jews in order to
[1:03:26] gain preeminence as the original church
[1:03:28] at pentecost the holy ghost first filled
[1:03:31] jews like peter and mary
[1:03:33] and so the false vine pretended to be
[1:03:35] jews
[1:03:36] they blasphemed god and the true vine
[1:03:38] through their lies and were jews by name
[1:03:41] only
[1:03:42] no they were not jews by natural birth
[1:03:44] nor were they spiritual jews by
[1:03:46] spiritual birth
[1:03:48] a fascinating fact is that jesus called
[1:03:50] them the literal synagogue of satan
[1:03:53] meaning this group no longer hid their
[1:03:55] murderous ways
[1:03:56] like cain this false vine was full of
[1:03:58] satanic hatred for the true vine for the
[1:04:01] false vine will always hate and kill the
[1:04:03] true vine
[1:04:05] the seemingly harmless deeds of the
[1:04:06] first age had now advanced into a
[1:04:08] completely sin saturated satan seduced
[1:04:12] synagogue of sinister souls in the
[1:04:15] second
[1:04:17] chief of satan synagogues was the first
[1:04:19] church of rome
[1:04:20] polycarp's trip to rome to correct their
[1:04:23] heirs allowed him to witness their
[1:04:25] worship service first hand
[1:04:27] the lady came in lighting candles and
[1:04:29] placing them before a statue of saint
[1:04:31] peter while prostrating themselves
[1:04:35] adding to this idolatry they
[1:04:37] participated in pagan easter
[1:04:38] celebrations accepted bribes legalized
[1:04:42] adulteries and committed blackmail
[1:04:44] the clergy were exalted above the laity
[1:04:47] by their power to manifest
[1:04:49] transubstantiation
[1:04:50] the changing of common bread and wine
[1:04:53] into the literal body and blood of
[1:04:54] christ with idolatry and lies like these
[1:04:58] satan succeeded in creating his own
[1:05:00] synagogue a man-made organization fully
[1:05:03] devoid of bible truth
[1:05:06] on page 151 in hazelton's writing about
[1:05:10] tertullian's time period the first
[1:05:12] church of rome grew through the aid of
[1:05:14] the emperors
[1:05:16] rome's evil bishops would report names
[1:05:18] of genuine christians who opposed them
[1:05:21] to the emperors who would have them
[1:05:23] exiled or killed the emperors were
[1:05:25] murderous and the bishops of the first
[1:05:27] roman church loved it so
[1:05:30] carnal pretend christians of the false
[1:05:32] vine always kill the saints of the true
[1:05:35] galatians 4 verse 29 reads but as then
[1:05:38] he that was born after the flesh
[1:05:40] persecuted him that was born after the
[1:05:42] spirit even so it is now
[1:05:46] yes the saints of the submerging age
[1:05:48] were hunted down imprisoned put on trial
[1:05:52] and martyred for jesus sake
[1:05:54] the false vine continually increased
[1:05:56] their brutality so much so that
[1:05:58] tertullian was said to have used his
[1:06:00] astute skills as a lawyer to plead many
[1:06:03] times for the lives of christians on
[1:06:05] trial
[1:06:07] ten roman emperors
[1:06:08] nero
[1:06:10] trajan hadrian aurelius severus maximum
[1:06:15] decius valerian aurelian diocletian
[1:06:19] initiated 10 awful persecutions upon
[1:06:22] christians with diocletians being the
[1:06:25] worst and lasting 10 years
[1:06:27] the 10 years of extreme violence
[1:06:29] occurred through diocletian's for edicts
[1:06:33] an issue to tear down the churches to
[1:06:35] the foundations and destroy the sacred
[1:06:37] scriptures by fire
[1:06:39] and commanding also that those who were
[1:06:41] in honorable stations should be degraded
[1:06:44] if they persevered in their adherence to
[1:06:46] christianity
[1:06:48] the order that the bishops presbyters
[1:06:51] and deacons should be imprisoned
[1:06:53] the order that the bishops and other
[1:06:55] clergymen should be tortured and
[1:06:57] compelled by every means to sacrifice
[1:07:01] the order that the laity should be
[1:07:02] tortured the atrocious cruelty with
[1:07:05] which these edicts were enforced and the
[1:07:07] vast numbers of those who suffered for
[1:07:09] the faith are attested by usabias and
[1:07:12] the acts of the martyrs
[1:07:14] we read even of the massacre of the
[1:07:16] whole population of a town because they
[1:07:18] declared themselves christians
[1:07:22] the rewards
[1:07:23] our savior offers two rewards for
[1:07:25] overcomers the crown of life and escape
[1:07:28] from the second death
[1:07:30] while every reward uniquely matches its
[1:07:32] respective age every overcomer from
[1:07:35] every age inherits all the rewards
[1:07:38] revelation 21 verse 7 promises
[1:07:41] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:07:43] things and i will be his god and he
[1:07:46] shall be my son
[1:07:48] every overcomer gets an incorruptible
[1:07:50] crown of life because they overcame
[1:07:52] death's corruptable rewards during their
[1:07:55] earthly journey
[1:07:56] millions upon millions earned the crown
[1:07:58] of life as a martyr in the sumerian age
[1:08:01] but paul says there is a crown for all
[1:08:03] who love jesus's appearing in second
[1:08:06] timothy 4 verse 8. henceforth there is
[1:08:08] laid up for me a crown of righteousness
[1:08:11] which the lord the righteous judge shall
[1:08:14] give me at that day and not to me only
[1:08:16] but unto all them also that love his
[1:08:19] appearing
[1:08:21] jesus wore a crown of thorns so that you
[1:08:23] could wear a crown of life
[1:08:25] if jesus could patiently endure the most
[1:08:27] brutal death imaginable and sumerian
[1:08:30] saints like justin martyr iranius origen
[1:08:33] and novatianus could endure their
[1:08:36] persecutions you can patiently suffer
[1:08:38] through your tests james 1 verse 12
[1:08:41] teaches your blessing will be the
[1:08:42] magnificent crown of life
[1:08:44] blessed is the man that endureth
[1:08:46] temptation for when he has tried he
[1:08:48] shall receive the crown of life which
[1:08:50] the lord hath promised to them that love
[1:08:52] him
[1:08:54] overcomers are not her of the second
[1:08:56] death which takes place in the lake of
[1:08:58] fire based upon revelation 20 verse 14
[1:09:02] and death and hell were cast into the
[1:09:04] lake of fire this is the second death
[1:09:07] the first death is the end of natural
[1:09:09] life on earth one's deceased
[1:09:12] the body decays and loses its form
[1:09:14] so the second death is the end of
[1:09:16] spiritual life the life of the soul and
[1:09:18] the unbeliever's soul will lose its form
[1:09:21] and vanish away completely
[1:09:23] sinful souls have an ending point and
[1:09:25] will come to total annihilation ceasing
[1:09:28] to exist
[1:09:29] you have likely been told souls are
[1:09:31] tormented without end but that is a very
[1:09:33] shallow belief that god's word quickly
[1:09:36] rectifies
[1:09:38] without devoting substantial time to
[1:09:40] this point start with combining the
[1:09:42] truths from first john 3 15 and
[1:09:45] revelation 21 verse 8 that say murders
[1:09:48] do not possess eternal life and will
[1:09:50] burn in the lake of fire
[1:09:52] without eternal life which is the spirit
[1:09:54] of jesus christ
[1:09:56] murderers cannot burn or suffer
[1:09:58] eternally without end
[1:10:00] wicked ones may burn for millions of
[1:10:02] years or longer but at some point they
[1:10:04] will cease to exist
[1:10:07] consider how shallow it is to designate
[1:10:09] eternal life to a location heaven
[1:10:12] instead of a person for christ is the
[1:10:14] person of eternal life
[1:10:16] eternal life is not a place you go to
[1:10:19] rather it is a spirit that comes to live
[1:10:21] in you
[1:10:22] additionally if a sinner is going to
[1:10:24] burn eternally
[1:10:26] then he already has the same kind of
[1:10:27] life you have but you know the heir of
[1:10:29] that thinking
[1:10:30] jesus's life inside you is what makes
[1:10:32] you eternally different than a sinner
[1:10:35] romans 8 verse 10 declares and if christ
[1:10:37] be in you the body is dead because of
[1:10:39] sin but the spirit is life because of
[1:10:42] righteousness
[1:10:44] the sumerian saints receive the second
[1:10:46] life eternal life in their lifetimes
[1:10:49] which is the same life you receive
[1:10:51] because you surrendered your earthly
[1:10:52] life for jesus purpose
[1:10:55] being born again the holy ghost in your
[1:10:57] soul is in earnest or down payment in
[1:11:00] the greek lexicon of eternal life
[1:11:03] second corinthians 1 verse 22 declares
[1:11:05] jesus spirit has also sealed us and
[1:11:08] given the earnest of the spirit in our
[1:11:10] hearts the second death cannot hurt you
[1:11:13] because you already possess a portion of
[1:11:16] unending life
[1:11:18] look at jesus's claim that real
[1:11:20] believers pass from death to life in
[1:11:23] john 5 24
[1:11:25] verily verily i say unto you he that
[1:11:27] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:11:29] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[1:11:32] shall not come into condemnation but is
[1:11:34] passed from death unto life
[1:11:37] all fear is gone because your soul
[1:11:39] possesses an earnest of the second life
[1:11:41] eternal life
[1:11:44] the pergamy in church age 312 to 606
[1:11:49] in revelation 2 verses 12-17
[1:11:52] star
[1:11:54] martin of tours is the angel star to the
[1:11:56] pergamian age who was trained in the
[1:11:59] gospel under hillary of poitiers in
[1:12:02] france
[1:12:03] hillary filled martin's mind with
[1:12:05] apostolic teaching straight from
[1:12:07] scripture as he was not under rome's
[1:12:09] influence
[1:12:12] after the lord led martin into his
[1:12:14] individual ministry he helped his pagan
[1:12:16] mother and sister convert to
[1:12:17] christianity
[1:12:19] martin built both a school and chapel
[1:12:21] for prayer and numerous men of god were
[1:12:24] sent forth from these institutions by
[1:12:26] the holy spirit to do great works in
[1:12:29] jesus name
[1:12:31] god performed many mighty signs and
[1:12:33] miracles in martin's ministry as he
[1:12:36] dedicated himself to study prayer and
[1:12:39] fasting
[1:12:40] the laws of nature were defied to
[1:12:42] vindicate martin's stand against
[1:12:44] idolatry doors supernaturally opened
[1:12:46] solely by god's power golden light shone
[1:12:49] from his body
[1:12:51] and the dead were raised to life
[1:12:53] hazelton writes that martin's life from
[1:12:55] conversion to death was one constant
[1:12:58] miracle
[1:12:59] full of god's love martin traveled over
[1:13:01] 300 miles to plead with spanish bishops
[1:13:04] for the life of his friend
[1:13:07] martin refused any fellowship with evil
[1:13:09] men promoting the first church of rome
[1:13:12] he saw how rome's man-made creeds which
[1:13:15] allowed idolatry killing lies and more
[1:13:18] left the roman church powerless in the
[1:13:20] holy spirit
[1:13:23] after martin's death many sick touched
[1:13:25] his tomb and were healed just as god
[1:13:28] honored elisha's bones in second kings
[1:13:30] 13 21
[1:13:33] margin was not canonized by rome but
[1:13:35] certainly by god
[1:13:38] christ's divinity
[1:13:40] jesus reveals himself as he which hath
[1:13:43] the sharp sword with two edges
[1:13:45] his third revelation of his deity is his
[1:13:48] identity as the word
[1:13:50] scripture verifies jesus is the word the
[1:13:52] word is a sword the word proceeds out of
[1:13:54] his mouth like a sword and his name is
[1:13:57] the word of god
[1:13:58] you cannot separate jesus from the word
[1:14:00] for they are one and the same
[1:14:04] the word is also truth according to john
[1:14:06] 17 verse 17
[1:14:08] and jesus calls the holy spirit the
[1:14:10] spirit of truth in john 14 verse 17. the
[1:14:14] world which includes iniquity working
[1:14:16] church members and sinners
[1:14:18] cannot receive the holy spirit because
[1:14:20] they disobey god's word
[1:14:22] yet the disobedient own bibles just like
[1:14:25] the pharisees own scrolls but manifest
[1:14:28] they are not god's children by
[1:14:30] blaspheming the true understanding of
[1:14:32] the word
[1:14:33] john 8 47 says he that is of god heareth
[1:14:37] god's words
[1:14:39] ye therefore hear them not because ye
[1:14:41] are not of god
[1:14:43] the holy spirit gives a true
[1:14:45] interpretation of the word to every age
[1:14:48] and the bride or true church of jesus
[1:14:51] from each age hears it and speaks the
[1:14:53] same truth
[1:14:55] revelation 2 verse 17 says he that hath
[1:14:58] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:15:00] saith unto the churches and revelation
[1:15:03] 22 17 says and the spirit and the bride
[1:15:06] say come
[1:15:07] and let him that heareth say come and
[1:15:10] let him that is a thirst come and
[1:15:12] whosoever will let him take the water of
[1:15:14] life freely
[1:15:16] christ is the word and his bride always
[1:15:18] believes him and speaks his truth like
[1:15:21] martin and the pergamian saints
[1:15:25] message to the true vine
[1:15:27] jesus knows the true vines works
[1:15:29] dwelling place their grip on his name
[1:15:32] and stand for his faith even unto
[1:15:34] martyrdom
[1:15:36] he commands some of the true vine to
[1:15:37] repent for holding two false doctrines
[1:15:40] balaam and nicolaitans certainly the
[1:15:43] leading men of this age like hillary
[1:15:46] martin and patrick never agreed with
[1:15:48] those lies
[1:15:49] the balaam and nicolaitan doctrines and
[1:15:52] the false vine who propagated them will
[1:15:54] be covered in the next section
[1:15:57] genuine christian flocks labored on in
[1:16:00] jesus name throughout europe asia and
[1:16:02] africa
[1:16:03] despite rome being overcome with wolves
[1:16:06] in sheep's clothing working iniquity the
[1:16:09] true vine was zealous of good works
[1:16:11] knowing they were created in christ
[1:16:12] jesus unto good works
[1:16:14] they had read faith without works is
[1:16:16] dead in james 2 26 and their faith
[1:16:20] worked by love
[1:16:22] as this would be the age in which the
[1:16:23] false church united with the roman state
[1:16:26] exponentially growing in wealth power
[1:16:28] and influence
[1:16:29] broadbent notes how the true vine
[1:16:31] continued to exist by the power and
[1:16:34] simplicity of the written word
[1:16:36] there remained however through all these
[1:16:38] times one thing capable of bringing
[1:16:40] about restoration the presence of the
[1:16:43] scriptures in the world supplied the
[1:16:45] means which the holy spirit could use in
[1:16:47] the hearts of men with a power able to
[1:16:49] overcome air and bring them back to
[1:16:52] divine truth and there never cease to be
[1:16:55] congregations true churches which adhere
[1:16:58] to the scriptures as the guide of faith
[1:17:00] and doctrine
[1:17:01] and the pattern both for individual
[1:17:03] conduct and for the order of the church
[1:17:06] these though hidden and despised yet
[1:17:08] exercised an influence that did not fail
[1:17:11] to bear fruit
[1:17:13] in every dwelling place of the true vine
[1:17:16] jesus's presence dwelt there as well he
[1:17:18] blessed their works as they held on to
[1:17:20] his name and received his faith
[1:17:23] human faith is never enough as paul says
[1:17:25] he lived by jesus's faith not his in
[1:17:28] galatians 2 verse 20
[1:17:30] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[1:17:33] i live yet not i but christ liveth in me
[1:17:37] and the life which i now live in the
[1:17:38] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:17:41] god who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:17:45] peter teaches miracles and all works of
[1:17:47] faith are done through jesus's name and
[1:17:50] by jesus's faith in acts 3 verse 16.
[1:17:54] and his name through faith in his name
[1:17:56] hath made this man strong
[1:17:58] whom he see and know yea the faith which
[1:18:00] is by him hath given him this perfect
[1:18:03] soundness in the presence of you all
[1:18:07] saint patrick of ireland 372-461
[1:18:12] whose given name was suckat is a saint
[1:18:14] from the pergamian age who held onto
[1:18:17] jesus's name and kept his faith
[1:18:20] patrick was robbed of his childhood and
[1:18:22] he and his two sisters were kidnapped
[1:18:24] and sold as slaves with patrick being
[1:18:26] taken to northern ireland to herd swine
[1:18:29] it was there he repented being converted
[1:18:32] by god's spirit
[1:18:33] upon returning home to his mother in
[1:18:35] france he enrolled in his uncle martin's
[1:18:38] bible school
[1:18:39] this is the same martin of tours who was
[1:18:41] the star messenger of this age
[1:18:43] patrick grew in grace and faith
[1:18:47] having gods leading to take the gospel
[1:18:49] to ireland where he once worked as a
[1:18:51] slave he and other ministers did just
[1:18:53] that and witnessed the holy ghost
[1:18:55] through many miraculous acts
[1:18:58] one barbarian chief witnessed so many
[1:19:00] miracles through patrick's life that he
[1:19:03] and his entire household repented and
[1:19:05] received christ just as jesus promised
[1:19:08] in mark 16 verse 18 patrick took up
[1:19:11] serpents and was not hurt he laid his
[1:19:13] hands on the sick and they recovered by
[1:19:15] jesus faith just as his uncle martin did
[1:19:20] patrick was once approached by an
[1:19:22] embassy from rome to visit rome but he
[1:19:25] refused knowing their wickedness it is
[1:19:28] believed the entire island received the
[1:19:30] pure gospel of the lord jesus christ
[1:19:33] through patrick's efforts
[1:19:35] sadly one hundred thousand of patrick's
[1:19:37] spiritual children were slaughtered
[1:19:39] through the efforts of roman jesuits in
[1:19:42] 1640
[1:19:43] but their genuine faith in jesus name
[1:19:46] undoubtedly provided them a place in
[1:19:49] glory upon their martyrdoms
[1:19:52] iniquity of the false vine
[1:19:55] christ knows satan's seat of habitation
[1:19:57] and hates his two devilish doctrines
[1:20:00] balaam and nicolaitans
[1:20:03] satan's earthly seat or headquarters had
[1:20:06] three locations
[1:20:07] genesis 10 verse 10 shows it began in
[1:20:10] modern iraq in the land of shinar and
[1:20:13] became known as the kingdom of babel
[1:20:15] hislop says satan's seat moved to
[1:20:17] pergamos when the babylonian pontiff
[1:20:20] atlas iii was expelled from iraq by the
[1:20:24] medo-persian kings
[1:20:26] atlas iii reigned in pergamos from 138
[1:20:30] to 133 bc and at his death bequeathed
[1:20:33] the province to rome
[1:20:35] antipas the faithful martyr was slain
[1:20:37] with other saints in pergamos
[1:20:39] satan's temporary seat
[1:20:42] satan's third and final seat became rome
[1:20:44] in this church age as predicted by john
[1:20:47] identifying mystery babylon as the city
[1:20:50] on seven hills in revelation 17 verses 5
[1:20:54] through 9.
[1:20:55] this took place when constantine the
[1:20:57] first moved rome's capital to
[1:20:59] constantinople in 330 signaling the
[1:21:02] empire's weakened civil authority and
[1:21:05] the strengthening of its papal authority
[1:21:08] with the empire civil authority out of
[1:21:10] rome
[1:21:11] the city's religious authority grew
[1:21:13] vested in the first church of rome
[1:21:15] the ancient roman empire fell in the 5th
[1:21:18] century but its papal empire began to
[1:21:20] rise fulfilling revelation 13 verses 1-3
[1:21:25] ancient pagan rome was the beast out of
[1:21:27] the sea whose one head was wounded but
[1:21:30] healed
[1:21:31] when pagan rome fell in the 5th century
[1:21:33] everyone thought the beast was dead but
[1:21:35] it lives to this day in papal rome the
[1:21:38] roman catholic church see chapter 9.
[1:21:42] this age's first hateful doctrine the
[1:21:44] doctrine of balaam imitates balaam's
[1:21:47] teaching who infamously caused israel to
[1:21:50] stumble into idolatry and fornication at
[1:21:53] bail pior in numbers chapters 22 through
[1:21:56] 25
[1:21:57] jesus warns that some in the new
[1:21:59] testament church would join themselves
[1:22:01] to idolatry and fornication
[1:22:05] in numbers 25 a group of israelis attend
[1:22:09] a balaam designed moabite sponsored
[1:22:11] feast and stumbled in the sins of
[1:22:14] fornication and idolatry
[1:22:16] biopior was an immoral union of two
[1:22:19] groups
[1:22:19] note that moses aaron phineas and other
[1:22:22] faithful jews never attended
[1:22:25] god's anger was kindled against the
[1:22:26] israeli compromisers
[1:22:28] and 24 000 died in the judgment plague
[1:22:33] the new testament's immoral union was
[1:22:35] the church uniting with the roman state
[1:22:38] during constantine the first reign
[1:22:41] like moses despised baal pior and never
[1:22:44] joined them the true vine never united
[1:22:46] with rome but many left the true
[1:22:48] churches to unite with the roman state
[1:22:52] in 312 a.d constantine had a spiritual
[1:22:55] experience
[1:22:57] a dream or vision of jesus's cross
[1:23:00] which led him to a military victory the
[1:23:02] next year his edict of mylon freed
[1:23:05] christians from persecution and began
[1:23:07] rome's evolution into a so-called
[1:23:10] christian state
[1:23:12] constantine's early work for christians
[1:23:14] included donating lavish buildings and
[1:23:17] erecting beautiful edifices for worship
[1:23:20] courtesy of the state
[1:23:22] instead of sharing in the poverty of
[1:23:24] christ which included small group
[1:23:26] gatherings in humble homes and cottage
[1:23:28] prayer meetings the false church
[1:23:30] inherited royal palaces and gorgeous
[1:23:33] assembly halls attracting lukewarm
[1:23:36] believers instead of spirit-filled
[1:23:38] saints
[1:23:40] sadly constantine either never heard the
[1:23:42] true gospel or rejected it because his
[1:23:45] life bore many corrupt fruits one he
[1:23:48] never corrected the first church of rome
[1:23:51] it was already a pagan organization only
[1:23:53] with a christian name before this time
[1:23:56] the first church was already committing
[1:23:58] the following wickedness among others
[1:24:00] statue and eucharist worship
[1:24:02] transubstantiation
[1:24:04] bribery adulteries infant baptisms and
[1:24:08] baptizing the dead
[1:24:10] herein is fulfilled jesus is rebuked to
[1:24:12] this balaam doctrine as idolatry and
[1:24:15] sexual sin was permitted
[1:24:17] hazelton writes the first church of rome
[1:24:19] continued to develop unobserved by
[1:24:21] constantine
[1:24:23] 2 he exalted himself as the 13th apostle
[1:24:26] yet his compromise with the first church
[1:24:28] of rome and lack of signs of an apostle
[1:24:31] make him unfit of this self-imposed
[1:24:34] title
[1:24:35] second corinthians 12 verse 12 reads
[1:24:38] truly the signs of an apostle were raw
[1:24:40] among you in all patience in signs and
[1:24:43] wonders and mighty deeds
[1:24:45] 3. he had his eldest son and wife
[1:24:48] murdered in constantinople while he was
[1:24:51] way celebrating his victories in rome
[1:24:53] these murders occurred over a decade
[1:24:55] after his supposed conversion first john
[1:24:58] 3 verse 15 says no murder such as
[1:25:01] constantine has eternal life abiding in
[1:25:04] him
[1:25:06] just as baal pior had their feast
[1:25:08] constantine had his own 10-month feast
[1:25:11] in 325 a.d called the council of nicaea
[1:25:15] his purpose was to unite all churches on
[1:25:17] jesus divinity as arius's doctrine that
[1:25:20] jesus was a created being and not equal
[1:25:23] with the father was questioned the
[1:25:26] council rejected aerys doctrines which
[1:25:28] led to the council to plant the seeds of
[1:25:31] what would later become the nicene creed
[1:25:34] a scripture denying confession of a
[1:25:36] false three-person god
[1:25:38] thus the legacy of this compromise
[1:25:40] council was that preeminence was given
[1:25:42] to creeds rather than the word
[1:25:45] here the church stumbled by uniting with
[1:25:47] creeds instead of the word
[1:25:49] the idolatry adulteries and other sins
[1:25:52] of the first church of rome were deemed
[1:25:54] acceptable by their sister churches as
[1:25:56] the roman church held to the creeds of
[1:25:59] the council of nicaea
[1:26:01] the nicolaitan doctrine is the second
[1:26:03] doctrine jesus hates from this age
[1:26:06] unconverted church leaders continued to
[1:26:08] be victors over the people by exalting
[1:26:11] themselves above the laity and
[1:26:13] instituting false doctrines
[1:26:16] the doctrine of transubstantiation
[1:26:18] worked to exalt the clergy because they
[1:26:20] claimed to have a miraculous power to
[1:26:23] change bread and wine into jesus's
[1:26:26] literal body and blood
[1:26:28] additionally constantine's church state
[1:26:30] union adopted human rule in place of the
[1:26:33] guidance of the spirit which led clergy
[1:26:36] to compete for lucrative positions and
[1:26:38] power just as publicly as political
[1:26:41] leaders competed
[1:26:44] with men ruling instead of the holy
[1:26:45] spirit ruling the unconverted clergy
[1:26:48] began using state power to persecute and
[1:26:51] kill the converted through clergy
[1:26:53] influence roman emperor theodosius
[1:26:56] 380 a.d edict ordered all christians to
[1:27:00] be called catholic christians branding
[1:27:02] all their names as heretics
[1:27:05] with threat of heavy penalties against
[1:27:07] the disobedient remember jesus said the
[1:27:10] overcomers would hold fast to his name
[1:27:12] in revelation 2 13 not the catholic name
[1:27:17] priscillian a holy ghost-filled bishop
[1:27:19] of spain and six others are said to be
[1:27:22] the first saints executed by the false
[1:27:24] church in 385 a.d
[1:27:27] while surprising to some saint augustine
[1:27:30] 354 to 430 usually lauded for his
[1:27:34] theology is said to have made popes
[1:27:36] fearless in killing anyone who disagreed
[1:27:38] with them
[1:27:39] when asked of his opinion on the death
[1:27:41] of a man killed simply for reading
[1:27:43] origen's books augustine wrote it is
[1:27:47] much better that some should perish by
[1:27:49] their own fires than that the whole body
[1:27:51] should burn in the everlasting flames of
[1:27:53] gehenna
[1:27:55] through the desert of their impious
[1:27:56] dissensions
[1:27:58] broadbent agrees his teachings incited
[1:28:01] and justified methods of persecution by
[1:28:04] which papal rome equaled the cruelties
[1:28:07] of pagan rome in 411 a.d augustine
[1:28:10] appealed to his allied roman bishops and
[1:28:13] officials to settle his doctrinal
[1:28:15] dispute with the donatists which he won
[1:28:19] augustine was clearly on rome's side as
[1:28:21] he more than any other writer taught
[1:28:23] salvation alone through the church and
[1:28:25] her sacraments
[1:28:28] it is significant that the first pope
[1:28:30] rises from this age damascus
[1:28:32] 304 to 384 and it is possible that the
[1:28:36] age ended with pope boniface iii giving
[1:28:39] himself the title universal bishop
[1:28:42] like the lawyers in jesus day these
[1:28:45] popes and others took the key of
[1:28:47] knowledge from the people by limiting
[1:28:49] scripture readings to latin only
[1:28:52] bible historian dr craig lamp says the
[1:28:55] bible was available in 500 languages in
[1:28:58] 400 a.d but was only heard in one latin
[1:29:02] 100 years later
[1:29:05] our lord had worn this age repent or
[1:29:07] else i will come unto thee quickly and
[1:29:10] will fight against them with the sword
[1:29:11] of my mouth
[1:29:13] but the false vines stiffened their
[1:29:14] necks
[1:29:15] in repayment god fought against satan's
[1:29:18] new roman seat rome was captured by the
[1:29:20] goths under alaric in 410
[1:29:24] and the western roman empire ended in
[1:29:26] 476.
[1:29:27] pagan ancient rome died but lived again
[1:29:30] in the papal holy roman empire
[1:29:34] the rewards
[1:29:36] the pergamine overcomer is promised to
[1:29:38] eat of the hidden manna and receive a
[1:29:40] white stone with a new name written
[1:29:42] therein
[1:29:45] manna was angels food given to israel
[1:29:47] during their wilderness journey in
[1:29:48] exodus 16. in verse 33 god instructs
[1:29:52] moses to hide a pot of manna in the
[1:29:54] holiest of holies to be kept for your
[1:29:56] generations
[1:29:58] only the high priest could ever see this
[1:30:00] hidden manna but jesus came as the
[1:30:02] living bread from heaven to us
[1:30:05] which word we live by
[1:30:07] the pergamian saints ate hidden manna as
[1:30:09] they daily lived in jesus presence they
[1:30:12] were privileged to partake of this
[1:30:14] hidden revelation of jesus christ hidden
[1:30:17] from bishops popes and even emperors
[1:30:19] like constantine
[1:30:21] every believer also has the future
[1:30:23] promise to partake of the hidden manna
[1:30:26] jesus will give to us in the new
[1:30:27] jerusalem there he will answer all of
[1:30:30] our questions and feed us the desire of
[1:30:32] our souls throughout all eternity
[1:30:36] the white stone with a new name
[1:30:37] represents a lasting revelation of
[1:30:40] jesus's righteousness as revelation is
[1:30:43] the rock the church is built upon
[1:30:45] according to matthew 16 verses 17-18
[1:30:49] white is the righteousness of saints or
[1:30:52] jesus's righteousness he shares with us
[1:30:55] recall the false vine of this age
[1:30:57] rewarded themselves with massive
[1:30:59] beautiful structures to hold vain church
[1:31:01] services while the true vine hid out in
[1:31:04] caves dens homes woods and more
[1:31:08] the false vine wanted great natural
[1:31:10] stones in this life
[1:31:12] to build churches for their spiritually
[1:31:14] dead members but the true vine desired
[1:31:16] jesus's future reward of the spiritual
[1:31:19] white stones accompanying this lasting
[1:31:22] righteousness is your new name for you
[1:31:24] held fast the name of the lord jesus
[1:31:26] christ
[1:31:29] the third tier in church age 606 to 1520
[1:31:34] in revelation chapter 2 verses 18
[1:31:37] through 29
[1:31:39] star
[1:31:40] columba is the angel star to this age he
[1:31:43] was born of royal blood in northern
[1:31:45] ireland but thankfully his father fergus
[1:31:48] valued jesus's cross more than his
[1:31:51] physical royal blood
[1:31:53] fergus diligently taught colomba the
[1:31:54] scripture kalama became a powerful
[1:31:57] missionary after hearing jesus's audible
[1:32:00] voice call him into missionary work
[1:32:03] some historians placed columbus
[1:32:05] supernatural missionary works in second
[1:32:08] place after jesus apostles
[1:32:11] two testimonies stick out in regards to
[1:32:13] god's power to save the lost
[1:32:15] visiting one heathen city columba prayed
[1:32:18] outside the gates while magicians inside
[1:32:21] the city tried to drown out his voice
[1:32:24] god increased the volume of his prayers
[1:32:26] until the holy spirit swung open the
[1:32:28] gates so heathens could hear and receive
[1:32:31] christ
[1:32:32] a second similar testimony is told of
[1:32:35] columba praying to enter a walled city
[1:32:37] being refused entrance he turned to
[1:32:39] leave but the chief's son became
[1:32:41] violently ill and the chief called for
[1:32:44] columba to pray for his son
[1:32:46] after the chief repented god healed the
[1:32:48] son and christ won souls in the city
[1:32:52] dr craig lamp credits columbus work of
[1:32:54] preserving god's word in the dark ages
[1:32:57] with making the reformation possible
[1:33:00] in 563 a.d columbus started a bible
[1:33:03] college in iona located in western
[1:33:06] scotland it's believed the barren ionian
[1:33:09] ground turned fruitful after columba
[1:33:12] planted seeds with one hand and lifted
[1:33:14] the other in prayer to jesus
[1:33:16] lamp says columbus college would
[1:33:18] continue through the dark ages the vast
[1:33:21] majority of evangelism that took place
[1:33:23] for the next 700 years took place as a
[1:33:27] result of that bible college
[1:33:30] due to its great missionary efforts the
[1:33:33] island was nicknamed the isle of the
[1:33:35] saints from it flowed many missionaries
[1:33:37] into scotland ireland and england
[1:33:40] building missionary villages was their
[1:33:42] main method of winning souls
[1:33:44] small groups of saints who were builders
[1:33:46] preachers and teachers would raise walls
[1:33:49] around their newly formed community and
[1:33:51] make converse of those who moved into
[1:33:53] their village
[1:33:54] faithful preachers and teachers were
[1:33:56] established among the new converts and
[1:33:58] trained to repeat this method
[1:34:00] these christian villages remained
[1:34:02] independent from rome and government aid
[1:34:05] keeping the true faith alive in jesus's
[1:34:07] little flock during the awful dark ages
[1:34:10] few men of god had such lasting and
[1:34:12] far-reaching influence as columba
[1:34:16] christ's divinity
[1:34:18] jesus reveals to thyatira that he is the
[1:34:21] son of god who hath his eyes like unto a
[1:34:23] flame of fire and his feet are like fine
[1:34:26] brass
[1:34:28] he was most often called the son of man
[1:34:30] during his earthly ministry but here
[1:34:32] claims his rightful title as son of god
[1:34:35] seated on heaven's throne at the right
[1:34:37] hand of the majesty on high
[1:34:39] christ must tell this age he alone is
[1:34:42] the son of god to witness against the
[1:34:44] rise of papal power
[1:34:46] near the end of this age thomas aquinas
[1:34:49] and alvarez pelagius both observed how
[1:34:52] many saw the pope not as a man but a god
[1:34:56] with no bounds to his authority
[1:34:58] rejecting the pope's universal authority
[1:35:00] they said meant being shut out from
[1:35:02] salvation
[1:35:04] this age also saw the rise of islam
[1:35:06] which denies jesus is god's son
[1:35:09] blaspheming his holy blood as the one
[1:35:12] and only atonement but jesus full of
[1:35:14] truth is god's only begotten son as
[1:35:17] every overcomer believes
[1:35:19] who is he that overcometh the world but
[1:35:21] he that believeth that jesus is the son
[1:35:23] of god
[1:35:25] jesus's fiery eyes give warning that he
[1:35:28] looks upon the evil of this age with
[1:35:30] vengeance and will bring all wicked
[1:35:32] deeds into judgment
[1:35:34] at armageddon christ returns to destroy
[1:35:36] all his enemies with eyes as a flame of
[1:35:39] fire
[1:35:40] the son's feet of brass also speak of
[1:35:42] judgment as animal sacrifices died in
[1:35:45] fiery judgment for israel's sins on the
[1:35:48] brazen altar jesus bore his cross
[1:35:51] passing through judgment for us but at
[1:35:53] his second coming he will trample down
[1:35:55] unbelievers in judgment with his holy
[1:35:58] nail-scarred feet
[1:36:00] message to the true vine
[1:36:02] jesus knew the saints works charity
[1:36:05] service faith and patience he also knew
[1:36:08] the last works of the age would outdo
[1:36:10] the first works
[1:36:12] the lord put no other burden upon the
[1:36:13] true vine than to hold fast to its love
[1:36:16] service until his coming
[1:36:19] notice jesus acknowledged the works at
[1:36:22] the beginning and ending of the age
[1:36:24] you've read about the beginning works
[1:36:26] which included columbus foundational
[1:36:28] missionary method
[1:36:30] the thyroid tier and saints followed
[1:36:31] columbus example for at least the next
[1:36:33] 700 years as jesus also complemented
[1:36:36] their charity service
[1:36:39] faith and patience
[1:36:40] since this was the true vine their ever
[1:36:43] increasing and pleasing works were
[1:36:45] motivated by charity paul teaches any
[1:36:47] works without charity are unprofitable
[1:36:50] in first corinthians 13 verses 1 through
[1:36:52] 3
[1:36:53] jesus complimented columba and countless
[1:36:56] other saints for their love inspired
[1:36:58] works
[1:36:59] their faith worked by love
[1:37:01] jesus's love shed abroad in their hearts
[1:37:03] by the holy ghost
[1:37:06] the greater works at the end of the
[1:37:07] thyroid tyrann age included those of
[1:37:10] john wickliffe john huss johannes
[1:37:12] gutenberg and deciderious erasmus among
[1:37:16] many others
[1:37:17] risking their own lives against all evil
[1:37:20] roman adversaries these men spread god's
[1:37:23] word in remarkable fashion
[1:37:26] wycliffe 1330-1384
[1:37:30] systematically attacked catholicism as
[1:37:33] the most prominent scholar at oxford
[1:37:35] university
[1:37:36] his doctrinal lecture notes which
[1:37:38] exalted scripture alone as truth were
[1:37:41] copied and taken to other countries as
[1:37:44] ammunition against rome
[1:37:46] defying the pope and transubstantiation
[1:37:48] wycliffe fled as a refugee to
[1:37:51] lutterworth england where he spent the
[1:37:53] rest of his life working on his greatest
[1:37:55] achievement the first complete
[1:37:57] translation of the bible into english
[1:37:59] well after his death his english bible
[1:38:02] was banned by the archbishop of york in
[1:38:05] 1408
[1:38:06] he was so hated by rome that in 1428
[1:38:10] 44 years after his death pope martin v
[1:38:14] ordered wycliffe's bones to be dug up
[1:38:16] and burned and his ashes were thrown
[1:38:18] into the river swift
[1:38:21] czech preacher john huss 1370-1415
[1:38:26] came to follow wycliffe's teachings
[1:38:28] through jerome of prague who heard
[1:38:30] wycliffe at oxford
[1:38:32] huss labored for religious reforms while
[1:38:35] rebuking the pope
[1:38:36] before being burned at the stake his
[1:38:38] last words prophesied of a man to be
[1:38:41] raised up whose calls for reforms and
[1:38:44] changes could not be suppressed
[1:38:46] miraculously 102 years later god raised
[1:38:50] up martin luther who would not be
[1:38:52] suppressed and nailed his 95 theses to
[1:38:55] the church door in wittenberg germany
[1:38:57] huss's followers eventually formed the
[1:38:59] morovian brethren who played a major
[1:39:01] part in the conversion of the wesley
[1:39:03] brothers
[1:39:05] german craftsman johannes gutenberg
[1:39:08] 1390-1468
[1:39:11] dedicated his life to perfecting the
[1:39:13] printing press with reusable movable
[1:39:16] type allowing books to be printed more
[1:39:18] quickly at a lower cost
[1:39:20] jesus anointed johannes's painstaking
[1:39:24] detail-oriented work leading to the
[1:39:26] publication of the gutenberg bible in
[1:39:29] 1455
[1:39:30] through his efforts both the middle and
[1:39:32] lower classes could finally access the
[1:39:35] bible fueling spiritual awakenings
[1:39:39] the citarias erasmus 1469-1536
[1:39:44] was the best-known scholar in europe his
[1:39:47] greatest work being the publication of
[1:39:49] the greek new testament a two-part study
[1:39:51] bible that included a new latin edition
[1:39:54] in 1516.
[1:39:56] previous to this publication erasmus had
[1:39:59] seen firsthand the revivals of thousands
[1:40:02] sparked by john colette reading the
[1:40:04] scripture to people in their own
[1:40:06] language the rest of erasmus life was
[1:40:09] devoted to translating scripture and his
[1:40:12] works made possible future bible
[1:40:14] translations by luther and tyndale
[1:40:17] lamp echoes erasmus famous quote
[1:40:20] i wish that even the weakest woman might
[1:40:22] read the gospels and the epistles of
[1:40:24] saint paul
[1:40:25] i long for the day when the husbandmen
[1:40:28] shall sing portions of them to himself
[1:40:30] as he follows the plow
[1:40:34] jesus assured this age that he accepted
[1:40:36] their service
[1:40:37] recall his highest compliment is for
[1:40:39] faithful service in matthew 25 verse 21
[1:40:43] well done thou good and faithful servant
[1:40:45] thou hast been faithful over a few
[1:40:47] things i will make thee ruler over many
[1:40:49] things
[1:40:50] enter thou into the joy of thy lord
[1:40:53] it is faithful servants who jesus
[1:40:55] rewards
[1:40:57] thyatira means odor of affliction in the
[1:41:00] greek
[1:41:01] and many saints in this age fulfilled
[1:41:03] this description by giving their lives
[1:41:05] as martyrs
[1:41:06] each time a saint died christ smelled a
[1:41:09] sweet-smelling heavenly savor just as
[1:41:12] the father smelled a divine aroma when
[1:41:14] jesus sacrificed himself for us
[1:41:17] ephesians 5 verses 1 and 2 captures this
[1:41:20] truth
[1:41:21] be therefore followers of god as dear
[1:41:23] children and walk in love as christ also
[1:41:27] hath loved us and hath given himself for
[1:41:29] us an offering and a sacrifice to god
[1:41:33] for a sweet smelling savor
[1:41:36] christian persecution continued in this
[1:41:38] age which undoubtedly was the bloodiest
[1:41:40] of all ages
[1:41:42] theologian samuel schmucker estimated 68
[1:41:45] million christians were martyred from
[1:41:47] the time augustine gave his approval for
[1:41:50] persecution in the fifth century until
[1:41:52] schmucker's lifetime in the 19th century
[1:41:55] the saints in the thiater and age served
[1:41:58] christ with godly works until most died
[1:42:01] at the hands of the first church of rome
[1:42:03] their crusades and the inquisition
[1:42:06] broadband says the catholics were
[1:42:08] absorbed in enthusiasm for the crusades
[1:42:11] and the inquisition finished what the
[1:42:13] crusade had left undone
[1:42:16] iniquity of the false vine
[1:42:19] christ chides the false church for
[1:42:21] suffering jezebel to teach false
[1:42:23] doctrines
[1:42:24] seducing his servants into fornication
[1:42:26] and idolatry jezebel was given space to
[1:42:29] repent but didn't causing her to go into
[1:42:32] the depths of satan righteous jesus will
[1:42:35] judge jezebel her adulterous lovers and
[1:42:38] her children with death
[1:42:40] in this third tier and age jezebel is
[1:42:43] not a literal woman rather she is the
[1:42:45] roman catholic church
[1:42:47] in the old testament ahab married
[1:42:49] jezebel for political purposes
[1:42:52] and this union led israel into the
[1:42:54] depths of satan
[1:42:55] likewise in the new testament
[1:42:57] constantine married the state to the
[1:42:59] roman church for political reasons in
[1:43:01] the third age which plunged it into the
[1:43:04] depths of satan in the fourth age
[1:43:06] both the original jezebel and the
[1:43:09] catholics in this age were guilty of
[1:43:11] teaching sexual immorality idolatry
[1:43:14] murder
[1:43:15] silencing true preachers and erecting
[1:43:18] houses of false worship
[1:43:21] catholicism stooped to the depths of
[1:43:23] satan in this fourth age by first
[1:43:25] adopting the deeds of the nicolaitans in
[1:43:28] the first age
[1:43:29] in the third age catholicism made these
[1:43:31] deeds unbending church doctrines
[1:43:34] satan's depths meant a man the pope
[1:43:38] ruling over men instead of the holy
[1:43:40] ghost
[1:43:41] catholicism was indeed the mother or
[1:43:43] first man-made man-led demonic system of
[1:43:47] organization
[1:43:49] here it is observed that man-made
[1:43:51] organizations always produce spiritual
[1:43:54] death
[1:43:55] jesus called this jezebel system the
[1:43:57] depths of satan
[1:43:58] every denomination is spiritually dead
[1:44:01] because they have denied further
[1:44:02] revelation of the holy spirit
[1:44:04] every denomination whether catholic
[1:44:06] lutheran methodist baptist etc
[1:44:10] instantly dies when it writes its
[1:44:12] tradition-based by-laws and refuses to
[1:44:15] accept more truth
[1:44:17] jesus said so thus have you made the
[1:44:19] commandment of god of none effect by
[1:44:21] your tradition
[1:44:23] denominations limit god to moving solely
[1:44:26] based upon their interpretation of
[1:44:27] scripture
[1:44:29] like israel each denomination starts
[1:44:31] serving god but ultimately limits god
[1:44:34] failing to gain more revelation
[1:44:36] fulfilling psalms 78 verses 40 and 41.
[1:44:40] how often they provoke him in the
[1:44:42] wilderness and grieve him in the desert
[1:44:45] yea they turn back and tempted god and
[1:44:47] limited the holy one of israel
[1:44:51] as additional evidence which
[1:44:52] denomination has ever had a real
[1:44:55] word-based revival and returned to the
[1:44:57] teachings of paul peter and john
[1:45:01] none of them have and they never will
[1:45:03] for god's pattern is to call his people
[1:45:05] out of the mother-daughter system of
[1:45:08] catholics and protestants according to
[1:45:10] revelation 18 verse 4
[1:45:13] come out of her my people that ye be not
[1:45:15] partakers of her sins and that you
[1:45:17] receive not of her plagues
[1:45:20] every denomination without fail falls
[1:45:22] further and further from truth as many
[1:45:25] now are publicly accepting homosexual
[1:45:27] clergy and celebrating transgenderism
[1:45:32] in the third tier and age satan-filled
[1:45:34] popes carried out both the crusades and
[1:45:37] inquisitions slaughtering millions
[1:45:40] pope urban ii began the two century-long
[1:45:44] crusades in 1095
[1:45:46] promising total forgiveness of sins to
[1:45:49] any of his soldiers who died in battle
[1:45:52] dr lamp says the wars of the popes were
[1:45:54] carried out to capture the wealth of the
[1:45:56] world as some popes fought to steal
[1:45:59] money to build rome's extravagant
[1:46:01] basilicas
[1:46:03] fox records the papal inquisition which
[1:46:05] later inspired the evil spanish
[1:46:07] inquisition was instituted by pope
[1:46:10] innocent iii 1160-1216
[1:46:16] after peter waldow 1140
[1:46:19] to 1205
[1:46:21] preached boldly against catholicism
[1:46:23] saying
[1:46:24] the pope was antichrist that mass was an
[1:46:27] abomination that the host was an idol
[1:46:30] and that purgatory was a fable
[1:46:33] another way popes raised finances was by
[1:46:36] selling indulgences
[1:46:38] pope john the 22nd
[1:46:40] 1244-1334
[1:46:43] established a list of tariffs for
[1:46:46] indulgences in which catholics could
[1:46:48] kill a man for 1.75 cents
[1:46:51] ravish a virgin for two dollars or be
[1:46:54] absolved of all sins for twelve dollars
[1:46:59] papal debauchery ruled this age
[1:47:02] urban vi
[1:47:04] 1318-1389
[1:47:07] in rome and clement the 7th
[1:47:09] 1342-1394
[1:47:13] in france each claimed to be the true
[1:47:15] pope threatening to excommunicate the
[1:47:18] other
[1:47:19] speaking of popes in general fox says
[1:47:22] a worse set of men never corrupted the
[1:47:24] earth from the time of gregory the great
[1:47:27] in the sixth century
[1:47:28] to the latest period the popes have been
[1:47:31] more or less of abandoned principles
[1:47:34] they have been covetous popes proud
[1:47:35] popes profane popes
[1:47:38] unchaste popes dishonest popes murdering
[1:47:41] popes
[1:47:42] all of whose names and characters may be
[1:47:44] seen in any impartial history of these
[1:47:46] pretended representatives upon earth of
[1:47:50] him who was holy harmless and undefiled
[1:47:54] the lord jesus ends his rebuke to the
[1:47:57] false vine by warning he will judge
[1:47:59] jezebel her adulterous lovers and her
[1:48:02] children with death idol worshipers are
[1:48:04] often called lovers in scripture as
[1:48:06] malachi 2 verse 11 says judah was
[1:48:09] married to the daughter of a strange god
[1:48:12] the jezebel systems lovers in this age
[1:48:14] were the european governments who bowed
[1:48:17] to her evils
[1:48:18] the crusades were possible only because
[1:48:21] european nations obeyed their lover
[1:48:23] jezebel
[1:48:24] and her front man's call to war pope
[1:48:27] urban ii
[1:48:29] jezebel's children were all the daughter
[1:48:31] churches who formed through the efforts
[1:48:33] of the mothers proselytizing
[1:48:36] all churches who supported catholicism
[1:48:38] and his popes were children of the
[1:48:40] mother church and christ hated their
[1:48:42] idolatrous works
[1:48:44] having defied jesus's warning the false
[1:48:46] vine will be killed with death or
[1:48:48] eternal separation from god in the
[1:48:51] second death the lake of fire
[1:48:53] chapter 9 fully details the
[1:48:55] mother-daughter relationship between
[1:48:57] catholics and protestants
[1:49:00] the rewards
[1:49:01] christ's two rewards for the overcomers
[1:49:04] are power over nations and the morning
[1:49:06] star
[1:49:08] power over nations is the perfect reward
[1:49:11] for all overcomers but especially the
[1:49:13] thyroid tyrant saints
[1:49:15] they lived in the darkest age
[1:49:17] spiritually speaking one that was
[1:49:19] dominated by papal rome and the devil
[1:49:23] it was almost satan's millennium but it
[1:49:25] was not quite one thousand years long
[1:49:27] believers like columba peter waldow and
[1:49:30] wycliffe defied nations for they were of
[1:49:32] a holy nation being born again from
[1:49:35] above from the heavenly nation
[1:49:37] by forsaking worldly nations jesus
[1:49:40] grants the overcomers power over nations
[1:49:42] as rulers during the millennium
[1:49:45] revelation 20 verse 6 says blessed and
[1:49:48] holy is he that hath part in the first
[1:49:50] resurrection
[1:49:51] on such the second death hath no power
[1:49:54] but they shall be priests of god and of
[1:49:56] christ and shall reign with him a
[1:49:58] thousand years
[1:49:59] after suffering for christ during their
[1:50:02] earthly lives they are fit to rule and
[1:50:04] reign over nations
[1:50:07] jesus appropriately promises to reward
[1:50:09] overcomers with the morning star or his
[1:50:12] light for he is the morning star
[1:50:15] according to revelation 22 16
[1:50:18] i jesus have sent mine angel to testify
[1:50:21] unto you these things in the churches i
[1:50:23] am the root and the offspring of david
[1:50:26] and the bright and morning star
[1:50:28] christ gives his overcomers the morning
[1:50:30] star because they suffered through the
[1:50:32] dark ages
[1:50:33] in this age popes fervently worked to
[1:50:35] keep the light of god's word from the
[1:50:38] people forbidding most from hearing and
[1:50:40] reading scripture in their own languages
[1:50:43] but god anointed men to take the light
[1:50:45] of his knowledge to every hungry heart
[1:50:48] and their heavenly reward will be jesus
[1:50:50] sharing more of his light throughout all
[1:50:52] eternity
[1:50:55] in the natural the morning star is the
[1:50:57] brightest light in the sky before dawn
[1:50:59] jesus is the true morning star the hope
[1:51:02] of a new day for when his day dawns the
[1:51:05] thyre tier and saints will reign with
[1:51:07] him in the one thousand year millennial
[1:51:09] reign
[1:51:12] the sardisian church age 1520 to 1750 in
[1:51:17] revelation 3 verses 1-6
[1:51:20] star martin luther is the angel star to
[1:51:23] this age one of the most well-known
[1:51:25] christians of all time luther sparked
[1:51:28] the protestant reformation as a poor
[1:51:30] monk standing against the whole vast
[1:51:33] papal power armed only with the bible's
[1:51:36] liberating message of habakkuk 2 verse 4
[1:51:40] and romans 1 verse 17
[1:51:42] the just shall live by faith
[1:51:45] luther's legacy is so vast it is hard to
[1:51:48] measure
[1:51:49] broadbent says luther revealed christ to
[1:51:52] countless sinners through unprecedented
[1:51:55] power and courage while writing many
[1:51:57] teaching tracks for christian
[1:51:59] understanding
[1:52:01] some believe his greatest work was
[1:52:03] translating both the old and new
[1:52:05] testaments into german but luther also
[1:52:07] added much to the church's music writing
[1:52:10] to him a mighty fortress is our god and
[1:52:12] it is believed that luther operated and
[1:52:14] possessed all nine gifts of the holy
[1:52:16] spirit
[1:52:19] climatic events abounded in luther's
[1:52:21] life
[1:52:22] amazingly he decided to become a monk
[1:52:25] after surviving a violent thunderstorm
[1:52:27] following numerous years in the ministry
[1:52:29] he nailed his 95 theses to the church
[1:52:32] door in wittenberg in 1517 after
[1:52:35] witnessing a papal worker shamelessly
[1:52:38] cell indulgences in the streets
[1:52:41] three years later he publicly burned the
[1:52:43] pope's letter of excommunication for him
[1:52:46] fully aware he may lose his life at the
[1:52:48] diet of worms luther refused to recant
[1:52:51] the sardisian star uttered his most
[1:52:54] inspired words
[1:52:55] my conscience is my guide scripture is
[1:52:58] my authority and i can do no other than
[1:53:00] abide by its teachings here i stand god
[1:53:04] help me
[1:53:06] while luther helped change the whole
[1:53:07] scope of christianity his work was
[1:53:10] unfulfilled
[1:53:11] as he aged his judgment failed at times
[1:53:14] he became dogmatic to a fault
[1:53:17] anti-semitic
[1:53:18] negative and saw many of his followers
[1:53:21] leave
[1:53:22] luther wrote not a tenth part of his
[1:53:24] converts remain steadfast in the faith
[1:53:27] and said we are almost utter heathen
[1:53:30] with the name of christian
[1:53:31] in some ways his lutheran church was
[1:53:33] reformed but not fully
[1:53:36] luther kept the church state system the
[1:53:38] catholic parish model infant baptisms
[1:53:41] and baptismal regeneration
[1:53:44] despite these disappointments luther's
[1:53:47] defiance of rome and scriptural
[1:53:49] revelations mightily pave the way for
[1:53:52] every future preacher and translator
[1:53:56] christ's divinity
[1:53:58] revelation 3 verse 1 reveals another
[1:54:00] aspect of jesus's divinity saying
[1:54:03] these things saith he that have the
[1:54:05] seven spirits of god and the seven stars
[1:54:08] you already know the seven stars are
[1:54:10] god's human angel messengers to the
[1:54:13] seven church ages but you need to know
[1:54:15] what the seven spirits of god represent
[1:54:19] it is crucial to maintain god is only
[1:54:21] one spirit as taught by jesus and paul
[1:54:24] but god manifests himself in various
[1:54:26] ways
[1:54:27] such as one holy spirit working through
[1:54:29] nine different gifts of the spirit in
[1:54:32] first corinthians 12 verses 4 through
[1:54:34] 13.
[1:54:36] the seven spirits appear four times in
[1:54:38] revelation chapter one verse four
[1:54:41] chapter three verse one chapter four
[1:54:43] verse five and chapter five verse six
[1:54:46] you learn four details about them they
[1:54:49] are before god's throne
[1:54:51] belong to christ
[1:54:52] appear as lamps of fire and are sent
[1:54:55] forth into all the earth
[1:54:57] these seven spirits of god refer to the
[1:54:59] seven earthly ministries of the seven
[1:55:01] stars as proven by the word
[1:55:05] first god greatly honored their prayers
[1:55:07] when they came boldly unto the throne of
[1:55:09] grace for mercy and help
[1:55:12] second they belong to christ as paul
[1:55:14] says he was a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:55:17] in ephesians 3 verse 1.
[1:55:19] third proverbs 20 verse 27 teaches the
[1:55:22] spirit of man is the candle or lamp in
[1:55:25] hebrew of the lord fourth zechariah 4
[1:55:29] verse 10 says seven men are the seven
[1:55:32] eyes of the lord which run to and fro
[1:55:35] through the whole earth
[1:55:37] as you have seen thus far these stars or
[1:55:40] men
[1:55:41] paul irenaeus martin columba and luther
[1:55:45] had unique ministries but the same god
[1:55:47] supernaturally worked in their lives
[1:55:50] jesus heard their prayers protected
[1:55:52] fueled and sent them to the world
[1:55:55] two out of the seven stars remain to be
[1:55:57] described but you will see the same lord
[1:55:59] moving in unique ways to manifest his
[1:56:02] light to each age
[1:56:04] first corinthians 12 5 declares this
[1:56:07] and there are differences of
[1:56:08] administrations but the same lord
[1:56:12] message to the true vine
[1:56:14] christ knows their works encourages
[1:56:16] watchfulness and instructs them to
[1:56:19] strengthen the things that remain that
[1:56:21] are ready to die
[1:56:22] the saints were to remember how they
[1:56:24] received and heard the word holding fast
[1:56:27] to it and repent because their works
[1:56:29] were not perfect before god
[1:56:31] however the all-knowing messiah saw the
[1:56:34] few who walked worthy and undefiled in
[1:56:37] white garments
[1:56:39] while jesus acknowledges the works of
[1:56:41] the true vine he emphasizes they were
[1:56:44] not perfect or unfulfilled
[1:56:46] the reformation is highly acclaimed for
[1:56:48] its spiritual illumination within the
[1:56:50] dark ages and rightly so but it did not
[1:56:53] fully separate from all catholic
[1:56:55] traditions
[1:56:56] thankfully luther and other reformers
[1:56:58] purged the church from papal authority
[1:57:01] transubstantiation
[1:57:02] idolatry marioletry indulgences and much
[1:57:06] more
[1:57:07] but as noted previously luther and other
[1:57:10] leaders of this age retained some heirs
[1:57:14] notice jesus urging the faithful few to
[1:57:16] strengthen what remained because the age
[1:57:19] was ready to die
[1:57:20] remember luther said he observed the
[1:57:22] church as almost heathen showing it was
[1:57:25] ready to die or denominate
[1:57:27] historically speaking the sardisian
[1:57:29] believers were to cling to justification
[1:57:32] by faith the reformation's main theme
[1:57:35] because the majority of churches were
[1:57:37] going to die through organizing new
[1:57:39] daughter denominations
[1:57:41] the previous age thiatera saw the saints
[1:57:44] overcome jezebel the mother harlot
[1:57:46] denominational system of the catholic
[1:57:48] church
[1:57:49] basardus was the age of spiritual
[1:57:51] jezebel's daughter athaliah she
[1:57:54] represented the daughter denominations
[1:57:56] raising after the mother denomination
[1:57:59] the sardisian age saw the formation of
[1:58:02] denominational lutherans and countless
[1:58:04] other sex divisions and man-made
[1:58:07] organizations
[1:58:08] denominational zeal was causing many to
[1:58:10] die spiritually
[1:58:13] christ implored this age to remember how
[1:58:15] they first received the reformers
[1:58:17] message of justification by faith
[1:58:20] peter emphasizes the power of memory to
[1:58:23] stir up believers in 2nd peter 3 verse
[1:58:26] 1.
[1:58:26] stir up your pure minds by way of
[1:58:29] remembrance
[1:58:30] this age needed to remember how they
[1:58:32] repented and became justified under
[1:58:35] preachers like luther
[1:58:37] ulrich zwingli
[1:58:39] heinrich bollinger
[1:58:40] and john calvin to name a few
[1:58:43] justification is only the first work of
[1:58:45] grace with sanctification and the
[1:58:47] baptism of the holy ghost being the
[1:58:49] second and third work respectively
[1:58:52] god's foreknowledge recognized the
[1:58:54] majority of sardisian believers would
[1:58:56] only accept justification so he saved
[1:58:59] the full restoration of the second and
[1:59:01] third works of grace for the last two
[1:59:03] ages philadelphia and laodicea
[1:59:08] however a few worthy saints in the
[1:59:10] sardisian age were born again with a
[1:59:13] third work of grace for that is what
[1:59:15] white raiment represents
[1:59:17] putting jude 1 23 romans 13 verse 14
[1:59:21] titus 3 verse 5 and revelation 3 verse
[1:59:24] 18 together you understand that the holy
[1:59:27] spirit filled souls are likened to
[1:59:30] wearing a white robe of jesus's
[1:59:32] righteousness while alive on earth
[1:59:35] luthor and zwingli walked worthy in
[1:59:37] white robes
[1:59:40] indeed luther was born again for he had
[1:59:42] holy ghost power as a witness in germany
[1:59:45] and later risked his life defying the
[1:59:47] holy roman emperor at the diet of verms
[1:59:51] but his emphasis was preaching
[1:59:52] justification by faith to a stiff neck
[1:59:55] people who in the generation following
[1:59:58] him would relax spiritually and
[2:00:00] denominate plunging themselves into
[2:00:02] spiritual death
[2:00:04] other reformers and saints alike had the
[2:00:07] genuine new birth experience but they
[2:00:09] were all subject to the conditions of
[2:00:11] their age and thereby struggled to
[2:00:14] always magnify truth
[2:00:16] christians living today in the laodicean
[2:00:18] age do well to praise god for the
[2:00:20] strength of the reformers who triumphed
[2:00:23] over the utter corruption of the dark
[2:00:25] ages
[2:00:26] surely you can relate to the sardisian
[2:00:28] saints's battle against
[2:00:30] denominationalism
[2:00:31] for you severely battle today's lazy
[2:00:34] lukewarm conditions
[2:00:36] let us rejoice for the faithful few who
[2:00:38] walked worthy of christ in white many of
[2:00:41] whom gave their lives as martyrs for
[2:00:43] jesus holy name
[2:00:46] william tyndale 1494-1536
[2:00:50] must be remembered from this age
[2:00:52] called the prince of translators and the
[2:00:55] father of modern english
[2:00:57] tyndale's translation of the bible into
[2:00:59] english serves as one of the greatest
[2:01:01] contributions to western civilization
[2:01:04] despite enduring 11 years of being
[2:01:06] hunted down for defying the pope and
[2:01:09] seeking to give the people an english
[2:01:11] bible he diligently translated the new
[2:01:13] testament
[2:01:14] while dying through strangulation and
[2:01:17] burning at the stake tyndale prayed lord
[2:01:20] open the king of england's eyes
[2:01:23] christ jesus heard his prayer for the
[2:01:25] very next year saw king henry viii grant
[2:01:28] permission and license to john rogers to
[2:01:31] print the english bible
[2:01:33] the king later printed 20 000 english
[2:01:35] bibles composed of 97
[2:01:39] of tyndale's work
[2:01:40] called the great bible and sent a copy
[2:01:43] to every church in england
[2:01:45] the most accurate bible ever written the
[2:01:47] king james version of 1611 contains 90
[2:01:51] of tyndale's translation work
[2:01:55] praise the lord for the few saints like
[2:01:57] luther and tyndale who walked worthy of
[2:01:59] the gospel in the sardisian age
[2:02:03] iniquity of the false vine
[2:02:05] christ rebukes the false vine for having
[2:02:07] a name they lived yet were spiritually
[2:02:09] dead
[2:02:10] this group would not repent of imperfect
[2:02:13] works nor watch for christ so he would
[2:02:16] come upon them as a thief in an
[2:02:18] unexpected hour
[2:02:20] assuredly the false vine of the roman
[2:02:22] catholic church associated themselves
[2:02:25] with the name of christ but they lived
[2:02:27] contrary to his teachings
[2:02:29] they arrogantly called themselves
[2:02:30] catholics which means universal their
[2:02:33] claim was to be concerned for the
[2:02:35] universal worldwide christian church yet
[2:02:38] jesus says they were dead
[2:02:40] indeed they were spiritually dead for
[2:02:42] they were more concerned with satisfying
[2:02:44] their lusts sadly this age was known for
[2:02:48] vast papal prostitution
[2:02:51] samuel schmucker records that in the
[2:02:53] days of pope paul iii
[2:02:56] 1468-1549
[2:02:59] the popes were some of the most
[2:03:01] licentious men in history
[2:03:03] pope paul accepted indulgences for sex
[2:03:05] acts with prostitutes
[2:03:07] after licensing brothels in rome
[2:03:10] the holy city alone had nearly forty 000
[2:03:13] prostitutes in their public register
[2:03:16] imagine the total number of prostitutes
[2:03:18] throughout rome influenced europe
[2:03:22] fox says rome's monasteries and
[2:03:24] nunneries were seats of iniquity with
[2:03:26] the latter comparable to the worst
[2:03:28] brothels
[2:03:30] describing their evils in the days of
[2:03:32] henry viii 1491-1547
[2:03:36] fox wrote when these monasteries were
[2:03:38] fully explored in england the abbots
[2:03:41] priors and monks kept as many women each
[2:03:45] as any lashivious could
[2:03:47] desire and their crimes renewed the
[2:03:49] existence of sodom and gomorrah
[2:03:52] in the days of pope paul v
[2:03:54] 1550 1550-1621
[2:03:57] the roman senate objected against his
[2:03:59] proposal to suppress licensed brothels
[2:04:03] because they were worried his priests
[2:04:05] would instead seduce the senators wives
[2:04:07] and daughters
[2:04:08] yes the false vine was dead in sins
[2:04:11] despite their claim to the precious name
[2:04:13] of jesus
[2:04:16] this age also saw the false vine promote
[2:04:18] denominationalism
[2:04:20] taking the name of lutherans and
[2:04:22] hussites but failing to obey their bible
[2:04:25] instructions
[2:04:26] like catholics they had a denominational
[2:04:28] name but were spiritually dead
[2:04:31] luther observed many in his generation
[2:04:33] were already dead but the second
[2:04:35] generation would be worse
[2:04:37] as the lutheran denomination became a
[2:04:39] replica of the old catholic system
[2:04:41] the daughter harlot was just like the
[2:04:43] mother harlot
[2:04:45] most second generation lutherans did not
[2:04:48] live with luther lived and thus died
[2:04:50] spiritually this brings the pharisees to
[2:04:53] mind as they reviled jesus and his
[2:04:56] message and claimed to be moses's
[2:04:58] disciples in john 9 28.
[2:05:01] jesus said they were the children of
[2:05:02] hell
[2:05:03] in reality the pharisees added and
[2:05:06] taught their own commandments rather
[2:05:07] than moses's which jesus exposed in
[2:05:10] matthew 15 verses 1-9
[2:05:13] the lutherans did the same for if they
[2:05:15] had preached and lived what luther
[2:05:17] preached the blessings of justification
[2:05:19] by faith
[2:05:20] would have led them away from all false
[2:05:22] doctrine organization and complacency
[2:05:25] obedience to luther's teachings would
[2:05:28] have brought strength and led them into
[2:05:30] sanctification and the baptism of the
[2:05:32] holy ghost
[2:05:33] but they denominated rebelled and died
[2:05:38] repentance was available but refused the
[2:05:41] false vine should have watched and
[2:05:42] waited for jesus's spirit to convict
[2:05:44] their hearts they should have diligently
[2:05:46] prepared their lives to meet jesus in
[2:05:49] peace
[2:05:50] understanding his warning to come like a
[2:05:52] thief
[2:05:53] instead they sold out their souls to
[2:05:55] temporary earthly pleasures and false
[2:05:57] religion
[2:05:59] the rewards
[2:06:01] our lord says the overcomers will be
[2:06:03] clothed in white raiment
[2:06:05] their names will not be blotted out of
[2:06:07] the book of life but will be confessed
[2:06:10] before jesus father and his angels
[2:06:14] the souls of born born-again christians
[2:06:16] are currently adorned in white robes
[2:06:18] while living on earth as paul says we
[2:06:21] put on the lord jesus christ and his
[2:06:23] armor of light in romans 13 verses 12-14
[2:06:28] in the greek put on means to sink into
[2:06:31] clothing put on clothe oneself
[2:06:34] but jesus promises the future putting on
[2:06:36] of white robes referring to the
[2:06:38] supernatural theophany or celestial
[2:06:41] bodies that house the christian soul
[2:06:44] after death according to second
[2:06:46] corinthians 5 verses 1 through 4
[2:06:48] all overcomers will have white as light
[2:06:51] raiment like jesus wore on mount
[2:06:54] transfiguration in matthew 17 verse 2.
[2:06:58] you already learned about the book of
[2:06:59] life in chapter 6 but the special reward
[2:07:02] of your name remaining on the book of
[2:07:04] life is what jesus directs his sardisian
[2:07:07] christians to strive for this is because
[2:07:10] the overcomers confessed jesus name
[2:07:13] rather than the pope luther zwingli or
[2:07:16] any other man's name the few overcomers
[2:07:19] had jesus name and lived by it walking
[2:07:22] worthy of the gospel
[2:07:24] job 14 verses 14 and 15 captures the
[2:07:28] truth of jesus calling and confessing
[2:07:30] our names after death
[2:07:32] if a man die shall he live again
[2:07:35] all the days of my appointed time will i
[2:07:37] wait till my change come
[2:07:39] thou shall call and i will answer thee
[2:07:42] thou wilt have a desire to the work of
[2:07:44] thine hands he will call every overcomer
[2:07:47] to meet him in the air at the rapture
[2:07:50] then he will call them to sit down and
[2:07:51] feast at the marriage supper of the lamb
[2:07:54] lastly he will confess the names of the
[2:07:56] overcomers as they judge men and fallen
[2:07:59] angels at the white throne judgment for
[2:08:01] they will sit with him on his throne
[2:08:06] the philadelphian church age
[2:08:09] 1750 to 1906
[2:08:12] in revelation 3 verses 7 through 13.
[2:08:16] star
[2:08:17] john wesley is the angel star to this
[2:08:19] age being the founder of the methodist
[2:08:22] movement and champion of the
[2:08:24] sanctification doctrine
[2:08:26] he and his brother charles a gifted
[2:08:28] songwriter were two of 19 children born
[2:08:31] to samuel and susannah wesley
[2:08:34] samuel was a busy traveling clergyman
[2:08:36] and susannah saw her children as talents
[2:08:39] committed to her by god
[2:08:41] since she had servants to assist her in
[2:08:44] housework susana devoted much time to
[2:08:46] prayerful godly child training
[2:08:49] she frequently gathered her children
[2:08:51] together to read scripture and counsel
[2:08:53] them
[2:08:54] sometimes up to 200 people crowded her
[2:08:56] home to hear her readings
[2:09:00] being trained and obedient to a
[2:09:01] disciplined christian life from his
[2:09:03] youth john grew in the faith and became
[2:09:06] an ordained minister
[2:09:07] while on a missionary trip to georgia
[2:09:10] the holy lives of the moravians made him
[2:09:13] realize he was not yet converted
[2:09:15] returning to england he received
[2:09:17] inspiring words from peter bowler to
[2:09:20] continue preaching and seeking god
[2:09:22] blessed assurance descended from heaven
[2:09:24] into his soul on may 24
[2:09:27] 1738
[2:09:30] with his message of a new
[2:09:32] greater spiritual experience john was
[2:09:34] rejected by the churches he had
[2:09:36] previously preached for
[2:09:38] his old friend george whitefield
[2:09:40] introduced him to open air preaching
[2:09:42] and god blessed his efforts with amazing
[2:09:45] supernatural results as tens of
[2:09:48] thousands at a time attended his
[2:09:50] services
[2:09:52] the gifts of the holy ghost abounded in
[2:09:54] wesley's ministry as believers shook
[2:09:58] fell to the ground as dead wept and
[2:10:00] shouted as they were healed and
[2:10:02] delivered from demons
[2:10:04] the dumb spoke the insane made sane and
[2:10:07] the dead raised to life
[2:10:10] while wesley always preached
[2:10:11] justification by faith he argued
[2:10:14] christians could experience entire
[2:10:16] sanctification in this life by loving
[2:10:19] god and their neighbors
[2:10:21] meekness and lowliness of heart
[2:10:23] abstaining from all appearance of evil
[2:10:25] and doing all for the glory of god his
[2:10:28] organizational genius loosely united
[2:10:30] believers in faith societies or bands to
[2:10:34] spread christianity and yet let each
[2:10:37] individual church remain independent
[2:10:39] proving his stand against
[2:10:41] denominationalism
[2:10:43] wesley's commitment to sanctification
[2:10:45] led him to purge the societies of
[2:10:47] unworthy members as he saw fit
[2:10:50] the new life and energy of his movement
[2:10:52] could not be contained in the dead
[2:10:54] established church of england
[2:10:57] wesley traveled 4 000 miles per year and
[2:11:00] preached over 40 000 sermons in his
[2:11:03] lifetime
[2:11:04] even at 88 years old he said he felt no
[2:11:07] infirmities of old age
[2:11:09] at his death he twice cried out the best
[2:11:12] of all is god is with us
[2:11:14] god certainly was with wesley and the
[2:11:17] sanctification loving methodists
[2:11:20] christ divinity
[2:11:22] jesus tells philadelphia these things
[2:11:24] saith he that is holy he that is true he
[2:11:27] that hath the key of david he that
[2:11:29] openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth
[2:11:32] and no man openeth
[2:11:34] christ alone is all holy and all true
[2:11:37] jesus only is exalted as the holy one
[2:11:40] witnessed by devils david peter paul and
[2:11:43] john
[2:11:44] his holiness was a result of him always
[2:11:47] doing the father's bidding
[2:11:50] thankfully jesus shares his holiness
[2:11:52] with man via substitution
[2:11:54] on the cross god exchanged our sins for
[2:11:57] jesus's holiness
[2:11:59] christ became sin so that we could
[2:12:01] become holy
[2:12:02] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[2:12:05] who knew no sin that we might be made
[2:12:07] the righteousness of god in him
[2:12:10] jesus's holiness is a free gift for
[2:12:12] every believer but always remains
[2:12:14] accredited to his work
[2:12:16] no man can boast of his own holiness
[2:12:19] after healing a lame man peter who was
[2:12:21] filled with the holy ghost pleads with
[2:12:23] those marveling at the miracle to
[2:12:26] recognize it was not done through his
[2:12:28] own power or holiness
[2:12:30] only jesus's holiness heals
[2:12:32] it is the only holiness in all the
[2:12:34] universe
[2:12:36] jesus's grace imputes his holiness to us
[2:12:40] as we partake of his sufferings
[2:12:42] hebrews 12 10 says god chastens us for
[2:12:46] our prophet that we might be partakers
[2:12:48] of his holiness
[2:12:50] four verses later you read follow peace
[2:12:52] with all men and holiness without which
[2:12:55] no man shall see the lord
[2:12:57] when jesus returns in the rapture
[2:13:00] believers gifted with the holy ghost
[2:13:01] will be holy still
[2:13:03] how kind for the holy one to impute
[2:13:06] holiness to unholy men through the new
[2:13:09] birth
[2:13:11] christ is he that is true for he is the
[2:13:13] true light true bread true vine true god
[2:13:17] and true witness jesus is truth embodied
[2:13:20] in a man as he is the perfect
[2:13:22] realization of truth
[2:13:24] john 1 14 proclaims he is full of grace
[2:13:27] and truth
[2:13:28] as a source of truth christ always spoke
[2:13:31] the truth
[2:13:32] thus he corrected every false word
[2:13:34] including those spoke by his mother his
[2:13:37] disciples the pharisees pilate caiaphas
[2:13:40] and satan in john 17 verse 17 one of his
[2:13:44] final prayers before being arrested
[2:13:46] jesus said sanctify them through thy
[2:13:49] truth thy word is truth
[2:13:51] our true messiah says his true word will
[2:13:54] sanctify or separate you from all
[2:13:57] profane things
[2:13:59] the key of david is jesus's right and
[2:14:02] ability for he is the son of david
[2:14:05] to sit upon the throne of david as king
[2:14:08] of israel in the millennium
[2:14:10] jesus has other keys the keys of death
[2:14:12] and hell
[2:14:13] which allow him to raise up his own to
[2:14:16] live with him for the 1000 year
[2:14:18] honeymoon
[2:14:19] jesus will open the millennium to his
[2:14:21] worthy ones and will close it in
[2:14:24] preparation for the white throne
[2:14:25] judgment
[2:14:26] isaiah 22 22 teaches the key of david is
[2:14:30] placed on jesus shoulder
[2:14:32] the purpose of the shoulder is to
[2:14:34] provide strength and range for the arm
[2:14:36] and hand
[2:14:38] jesus hand represents power and the arm
[2:14:40] of the lord symbolizes his ability to
[2:14:42] redeem save and judge
[2:14:45] christ beautifully and powerfully saves
[2:14:47] his elect
[2:14:48] luke 15 verse 5 says he rejoices as he
[2:14:51] lays all his saved sheep on his
[2:14:53] shoulders
[2:14:55] jesus takes full responsibility for you
[2:14:57] his lamb and rests you upon his shoulder
[2:15:00] of saving redeeming power
[2:15:03] message to the true vine
[2:15:06] jesus knows the works of the faithful
[2:15:08] saints and he sets before them an open
[2:15:10] door that no man can shut
[2:15:12] christ sees their little strength
[2:15:14] obedience to his words and how they have
[2:15:16] not denied his name
[2:15:18] our lord promises to make their enemies
[2:15:20] worship before their feet and know that
[2:15:22] jesus loves them
[2:15:24] another promise is that he will keep
[2:15:26] them from the worldwide time of
[2:15:28] temptation
[2:15:29] jesus says he is coming quickly so they
[2:15:31] must hold fast what they have that no
[2:15:34] man take their crown
[2:15:37] the open door has two interconnected
[2:15:39] meanings first this was the age of
[2:15:42] unprecedented missionary work and it was
[2:15:45] paul who called a new ministry
[2:15:46] opportunity in troas an open door in
[2:15:50] second corinthians 2 verse 12
[2:15:52] furthermore when i came to troas to
[2:15:54] preach christ's gospel and a door was
[2:15:57] opened unto me of the lord
[2:16:00] broadbent says william carey helped to
[2:16:02] bring about this sense of responsibility
[2:16:04] and of love to christ and to mankind
[2:16:08] kerry's works included 41 years of
[2:16:10] ministry in india
[2:16:12] over 700 converts numerous bible
[2:16:14] translations providing education for
[2:16:17] thousands and initiating social reforms
[2:16:21] his sacrificial works inspired many
[2:16:23] other missionaries
[2:16:25] like hudson taylor and david livingstone
[2:16:27] to enter the global open door that men
[2:16:30] could not shut
[2:16:32] a second meaning for the open door is
[2:16:34] the spiritual revelation of jesus as the
[2:16:37] door of the sheep in john 10 verse 7
[2:16:40] then said jesus unto them again verily
[2:16:42] verily i say unto you i am the door of
[2:16:44] the sheep the philadelphian saints who
[2:16:47] entered into christ the door received
[2:16:50] his little strength to obey his great
[2:16:52] commission by making disciples of all
[2:16:54] nations
[2:16:56] the saints in this age confessed jesus
[2:16:59] name and had more strength than those of
[2:17:01] the reformation
[2:17:03] the philadelphian saints acted upon
[2:17:05] jesus name by producing some of the
[2:17:07] greatest sermons and works of literature
[2:17:09] in history
[2:17:11] with jesus strength gifted men like
[2:17:13] charles spurgeon jonathan edwards and
[2:17:16] john bunyan preached and wrote to
[2:17:18] magnify the name of jesus christ
[2:17:22] just as the second age had lying enemies
[2:17:25] who called themselves jews but were not
[2:17:27] these philadelphian saints battled
[2:17:29] similar liars
[2:17:31] historically speaking it is difficult to
[2:17:33] identify this group but it seems
[2:17:35] probable the synagogue of satan was the
[2:17:38] roman catholic church because she
[2:17:40] falsely claimed to be the original
[2:17:42] church
[2:17:43] either way jesus encouraged the true
[2:17:45] vine to be confident that he would show
[2:17:48] the false vine his love for true
[2:17:50] believers by making the false vine fall
[2:17:52] down at their feet at the white throne
[2:17:54] judgment
[2:17:55] liars will not bow now but every knee
[2:17:58] shall bow before jesus and his saints on
[2:18:00] judgment day
[2:18:01] first corinthians 6 verses 2 and 3
[2:18:03] promises do ye not know that the saints
[2:18:06] shall judge the world and if the world
[2:18:08] should be judged by you are ye unworthy
[2:18:10] to judge the smallest matters
[2:18:12] know ye not that we shall judge angels
[2:18:15] how much more things that pertain to
[2:18:16] this life
[2:18:18] the lord's final words to this age
[2:18:21] emphasize his soon coming saying behold
[2:18:24] i come quickly after the philadelphian
[2:18:27] age there would only be one more age
[2:18:29] laodicea
[2:18:30] jesus second coming was nearer than ever
[2:18:33] and sinful human history was coming to a
[2:18:35] close
[2:18:36] these saints kept the faith through
[2:18:38] tumultuous times such as the american
[2:18:40] revolution the napoleonic wars the
[2:18:43] french revolution and the american civil
[2:18:46] war to name a few
[2:18:49] since the true vine had kept jesus's
[2:18:51] word of patience by keeping his word in
[2:18:53] confessing his name
[2:18:55] jesus would keep them from the worldwide
[2:18:58] hour of temptation spoken of in
[2:19:00] revelation 13 verses 15 through 17.
[2:19:04] during the tribulation the image of the
[2:19:06] beast is going to try and force all to
[2:19:09] either take the mark of the beast or die
[2:19:11] this is still in the future but jesus
[2:19:13] gave this age blessed assurance that
[2:19:16] they would not see this wicked event
[2:19:18] chapter 12 outlines jesus's promise that
[2:19:21] the true vine in laodicea will not see
[2:19:23] this hour of temptation either
[2:19:25] christ will snatch his bride away in the
[2:19:27] rapture before the tribulation sets in
[2:19:30] god has not appointed us to wrath but to
[2:19:33] obtain salvation
[2:19:35] no doubt we will see the ecumenical move
[2:19:38] grow and further unite with the world's
[2:19:40] governments
[2:19:41] since the mark of the beast will come
[2:19:43] out of the united states or beast out of
[2:19:46] the earth americans will see the
[2:19:48] churches unite with the state to enact
[2:19:50] laws against true christianity
[2:19:53] jesus's bride may be forced to stop
[2:19:55] preaching
[2:19:56] she may be threatened with the loss of
[2:19:57] the privilege of buying and selling but
[2:20:00] before the hour comes for the mark to be
[2:20:02] enforced upon all christ comes to
[2:20:04] rapture her away
[2:20:07] the true vine who held fast to jesus's
[2:20:10] name and strength were to gain their
[2:20:12] crown and not allow another to take it
[2:20:15] crowns belong to rulers who reign and
[2:20:17] two bible examples illustrate this
[2:20:19] thought
[2:20:20] king saul was anointed and crowned but
[2:20:22] his impatience and self-will caused his
[2:20:25] crown to be given to david and his sons
[2:20:28] judas iscariot was given the highest
[2:20:30] office in the ministry that of an
[2:20:33] apostle but forfeited it and his place
[2:20:35] was given to matthias philippian saints
[2:20:38] persevered and kept the faith ruling and
[2:20:41] reigning by wearing the full armor of
[2:20:43] god and overcoming satan's synagogue
[2:20:47] their crown awaits them along with a
[2:20:49] seat on jesus's throne
[2:20:52] iniquity of the false vine
[2:20:55] christ says very little about the false
[2:20:56] vine in this age because the true vine
[2:20:59] had the open door and strength in his
[2:21:01] name
[2:21:02] conversely the false vine weakened as
[2:21:04] seen through the fading power of the
[2:21:06] inquisition and the fading influence
[2:21:09] rome had over rulers
[2:21:11] the rise of european nationalism and
[2:21:13] revolutions around the globe gave
[2:21:15] greater power to national leaders who no
[2:21:17] longer feared popes
[2:21:20] two portions of prophecy were being
[2:21:22] fulfilled during this time
[2:21:24] first the roman antichrist spirit was
[2:21:26] moving to the united states to become
[2:21:29] the beast out of the land from
[2:21:30] revelation 13.
[2:21:32] second the iron and clay of the great
[2:21:35] image in daniel 2 verses 42 through 43
[2:21:38] reforming the final catholic protestant
[2:21:40] kingdom
[2:21:41] this image agreed upon false doctrines
[2:21:44] but were not completely unified
[2:21:47] as jesus said the false vine were liars
[2:21:50] and their churches of satan for they
[2:21:52] continued persecuting the true vine
[2:21:54] broad meant tells of the persecution
[2:21:57] wesley and his preachers faced
[2:21:59] most violent opposition assailed the
[2:22:01] preachers from all sides
[2:22:03] righteous mobs attacked them and those
[2:22:05] who with them had confessed christ doing
[2:22:08] grievous injury to persons and property
[2:22:10] but all this was met by a courage and
[2:22:12] meekness which the adversaries were not
[2:22:15] able to withstand
[2:22:16] satan's liars name-called criticized
[2:22:19] broke up services and threatened to kill
[2:22:22] the true vine but none could close
[2:22:24] jesus's open door
[2:22:27] jesus promised he would make the false
[2:22:29] group know his love for the true ones
[2:22:31] and it seems this will be done at the
[2:22:32] white throne judgment
[2:22:34] during this age the false could not see
[2:22:36] jesus's love for his saints because of
[2:22:39] the spirit of deception and iniquity
[2:22:41] they had accepted
[2:22:42] equipped with reprobate minds and
[2:22:44] blasphemous words the false vine
[2:22:47] continued to think their killing was
[2:22:49] pleasing to god rome and the pope
[2:22:51] their evil works matched the pharisees
[2:22:54] of john 16 verses 2 and 3.
[2:22:57] yea the time cometh that whosoever
[2:22:59] killeth you will think that he doeth
[2:23:01] god's service
[2:23:03] and these things will they do unto you
[2:23:05] because they have not known the father
[2:23:07] nor me
[2:23:08] had the catholics known the father and
[2:23:10] his son's prayer for believers
[2:23:12] sanctification through truth in john 17
[2:23:14] verse 17 they would have honored
[2:23:16] wesley's move
[2:23:19] the rewards
[2:23:21] overcomers are made pillars in the
[2:23:22] temple of god and shall no more go out
[2:23:26] herein lies two truths
[2:23:28] first christ's bride will be residents
[2:23:30] of the millennial temple and never leave
[2:23:32] aside
[2:23:33] revelation 7 verses 9 through 17 shows
[2:23:37] his gentile people are like pillars in
[2:23:39] the temple for they are before the
[2:23:41] throne of god and serve him day and
[2:23:43] night in his temple and he that sitteth
[2:23:45] on the throne shall dwell among them
[2:23:48] you know there is no temple in the new
[2:23:50] jerusalem for the lamb is the temple
[2:23:52] throughout eternity
[2:23:54] second overcomers become part of the
[2:23:56] spiritual temple of god taught in
[2:23:58] ephesians 2 verses 19-22
[2:24:02] bride members are built upon the
[2:24:03] original apostles and prophets with
[2:24:06] jesus christ being the chief cornerstone
[2:24:08] of the holy temple
[2:24:11] another reward is for the overcomer to
[2:24:13] have three names written spiritually on
[2:24:15] the fleshly tables of his heart
[2:24:17] god's name the name of his city and
[2:24:20] jesus's new name
[2:24:22] god's name is simply the lord jesus
[2:24:23] christ for john 5 verse 43 says jesus
[2:24:27] came in his father's name
[2:24:29] jesus means jehovah is our salvation and
[2:24:32] his name is the name above all names
[2:24:35] jesus is the image of jehovah the father
[2:24:38] for his proper name in hebrew is jehovah
[2:24:40] or jehovah the self-existing one
[2:24:43] god city is named the new jerusalem and
[2:24:46] this name is etched upon the overcomer's
[2:24:48] heart for this is his eternal home
[2:24:51] jesus's new name is another divine
[2:24:53] mystery yet to be unveiled and will be
[2:24:56] magnificent beyond all description
[2:25:00] the laodicean church age 1906 to the
[2:25:04] present in revelation 3 verses 14
[2:25:07] through 22
[2:25:08] star william branham is the angel star
[2:25:11] to this final gentile age
[2:25:14] meaning his bible-based message from
[2:25:16] jesus christ is what the true church
[2:25:18] needs to hear today
[2:25:20] this entire book is dedicated to sharing
[2:25:22] jesus bible message for today and
[2:25:24] chapter 13 covers branham's life
[2:25:26] spiritual gifts and bible foretold
[2:25:29] ministry
[2:25:30] summarizing his ministry's worldwide
[2:25:33] lasting impact the dictionary of
[2:25:35] pentecostal and charismatic movement
[2:25:37] states
[2:25:38] the person universally acknowledged as
[2:25:41] the revival's father or pacesetter was
[2:25:43] william branham the sudden appearance of
[2:25:45] his miraculous healing campaigns in 1946
[2:25:49] set off a spiritual explosion in the
[2:25:51] pentecostal movement which was to move
[2:25:53] to main street usa by the 1950s and give
[2:25:57] birth to the broader charismatic
[2:25:59] movement in the 1960s which currently
[2:26:02] affects almost every denomination in the
[2:26:04] country
[2:26:06] as the final angel messenger to the
[2:26:08] gentiles jesus sent branham with an
[2:26:11] undeniable gift of discernment to know
[2:26:13] the thoughts and intents of hearts the
[2:26:15] holy spirit repeatedly and boldly spoke
[2:26:18] with thus saith the lord through branham
[2:26:20] as he had through prophets like moses
[2:26:23] joshua ezekiel and jeremiah
[2:26:25] numerous prophecies spoken by the spirit
[2:26:28] through branham have come to pass and
[2:26:30] many more remain to be fulfilled as the
[2:26:32] second coming of jesus nears
[2:26:36] since jesus had luther emphasized
[2:26:37] justification and wesley emphasized
[2:26:40] sanctification the savior had branham
[2:26:42] major on the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:26:45] this is the age of restoration we are
[2:26:47] walking where the apostles trod all
[2:26:50] mysteries are revealed believers hearts
[2:26:52] are turned back to the apostolic fathers
[2:26:55] jesus is returning soon to rapture his
[2:26:57] bride off the earth before judgment
[2:26:59] falls
[2:27:01] christ's divinity
[2:27:03] our lord signifies himself as the amen
[2:27:06] the faithful and true witness the
[2:27:08] beginning of the creation of god
[2:27:10] as our amen in the last age jesus
[2:27:12] demonstrates his authority of having the
[2:27:14] last word amen means so it is so be it
[2:27:19] may it be fulfilled in the greek
[2:27:21] he opened the door to the gentiles in
[2:27:23] ephesus and will close it himself at his
[2:27:26] own appointed time in laodicea his every
[2:27:28] promise to every age he will fulfill
[2:27:31] as second corinthians 1 verse 20
[2:27:33] declares for all the promises of god in
[2:27:35] him are ye and in him amen unto the
[2:27:39] glory of god by us
[2:27:41] messiah is also connecting himself with
[2:27:43] his first and last title because the
[2:27:46] word amen in the greek is also used as
[2:27:48] the verily verily when beginning a
[2:27:51] statement
[2:27:52] jesus begins and ends his messages with
[2:27:55] the same loving eternal assurance that
[2:27:58] he will do what he said because he is
[2:28:00] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:28:04] again jesus's deity is speaking it is an
[2:28:08] astounding historical fact that only the
[2:28:10] first and last church ages knew jesus as
[2:28:13] one person and not the second person of
[2:28:16] a man-made trinity dogma
[2:28:18] jesus is the invisible god made flesh
[2:28:21] he's the image of the one and only god
[2:28:24] you will never see the father but he has
[2:28:26] taken on a flesh body so that he can be
[2:28:28] touched and handled
[2:28:30] indeed the term trinity was coined in
[2:28:32] the second age mandated in the third
[2:28:35] commonplace in the fourth and ignorantly
[2:28:38] carried on through the sixth age but now
[2:28:40] in the amen age the seventh age his
[2:28:43] bride knows his full deity as he desires
[2:28:46] to be known
[2:28:47] jesus is not part of the trinity for
[2:28:49] there is no such thing he's the fullness
[2:28:52] of the godhead bodily
[2:28:54] christ is the faithful and true witness
[2:28:57] concerning faithfulness it is through
[2:28:59] his power that everything consists
[2:29:01] the visible and invisible heavens
[2:29:03] thrones dominions principalities and
[2:29:06] powers
[2:29:07] jesus's words alone set the universe and
[2:29:10] its laws in order and keeps them intact
[2:29:13] if he can maintain all this surely he is
[2:29:16] faithful to start maintain and finish
[2:29:18] his work in you
[2:29:20] philippians 1 verse 6 promises
[2:29:23] being confident of this very thing that
[2:29:25] he which hath begun a good work in you
[2:29:28] will perform it until the day of jesus
[2:29:30] christ
[2:29:32] in this age of lukewarm and lying
[2:29:34] witnesses christ is the true witness
[2:29:37] second peter 3 verses 3 through 7 says
[2:29:40] false witnesses in the last days will be
[2:29:43] willingly ignorant of jesus's second
[2:29:45] coming the earth's creation and noah's
[2:29:48] flood
[2:29:49] they will avoid and deny the truth on
[2:29:51] purpose witnessing against it but jesus
[2:29:54] is the true witness for he was with and
[2:29:57] loved of the father before the
[2:29:58] foundation of the world
[2:30:00] this means he witnessed the earth's
[2:30:01] founding
[2:30:02] jesus spirit was in noah's preaching
[2:30:05] urging mankind to repent
[2:30:07] after his crucifixion jesus spirit
[2:30:09] descended to hell to preach and witness
[2:30:12] against that wicked generation the true
[2:30:14] witness is coming again and says to
[2:30:17] watch and pray always that you may be
[2:30:19] accounted worthy to escape judgment and
[2:30:21] stand before the son of man
[2:30:24] recall chapter 1 when you learn jesus is
[2:30:27] the beginning of the creation of god
[2:30:29] before there was time space or matter
[2:30:32] the invisible god alone existed his
[2:30:35] first words likely let there be light
[2:30:37] produced a visible light in time space
[2:30:40] and matter called the logos or the word
[2:30:43] this light was jesus for he is the word
[2:30:46] and was the first creation
[2:30:48] the first creation or beginner speaks
[2:30:51] assurance he is with us in the last age
[2:30:55] message to the true vine
[2:30:57] jesus again knows the works of
[2:30:59] christians
[2:31:00] and urges them to be hot which is
[2:31:02] possible through buying gold and white
[2:31:05] raiment directly from him
[2:31:07] believers are instructed to anoint their
[2:31:09] eyes with eye salve in order to see
[2:31:12] in love jesus rebukes and chastens his
[2:31:15] own who zealously repent
[2:31:18] his last words to this age place him
[2:31:20] knocking at every heart's door
[2:31:22] willing to come and sup with them if
[2:31:24] they will hear his voice and open their
[2:31:27] hearts to his spirit
[2:31:29] although jesus message is extremely
[2:31:32] harsh to this age as it should be there
[2:31:35] is hope for the true church
[2:31:37] the overcomers works will be hot which
[2:31:39] means boiling hot metaphorically of
[2:31:42] fervor of mind and zeal in the greek
[2:31:45] thinking on the word fervent also
[2:31:47] defined as passionate intense and
[2:31:49] sincere
[2:31:50] brings to mind scriptures like the
[2:31:52] fervent bold and diligent teacher
[2:31:54] apollos
[2:31:55] recall paul's plea for christians in
[2:31:57] romans 12 11
[2:31:59] to be not slaughterful in business
[2:32:02] fervent in spirit serving the lord
[2:32:05] jesus's bride and laodicea must pray
[2:32:07] fervently as epreforus always labored
[2:32:10] fervently in prayer
[2:32:11] james 5 16 says the effectual fervent
[2:32:15] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[2:32:17] twice in his first epistle peter
[2:32:20] admonishes us to love each other
[2:32:21] fervently above all else
[2:32:25] the true vine began this age hot on
[2:32:27] april 9 1906 when the holy ghost fell
[2:32:31] upon believers on azusa street
[2:32:33] california after intense seasons of
[2:32:35] prayer in obedience to the order of the
[2:32:38] word the saints spoke in tongues and
[2:32:40] every message was interpreted in english
[2:32:43] fueled by these vigorous works believers
[2:32:45] receive the revelation that god is one
[2:32:47] person within one decade afterwards
[2:32:51] this revelation was in direct opposition
[2:32:53] to the three-person trinity the
[2:32:55] apostolic revelation of jesus's supreme
[2:32:58] deity and god's one name as the lord
[2:33:00] jesus christ was restored at the perfect
[2:33:03] time just before jesus's rapture
[2:33:05] returned
[2:33:07] the next two decades would see the false
[2:33:09] vine hinder the move of god by deceiving
[2:33:12] men into organizing denominations based
[2:33:16] upon tongues as the evidence of the holy
[2:33:17] ghost and the oneness of god no longer
[2:33:20] would god speak through them or any
[2:33:22] other organization because he said he
[2:33:24] would spew lukewarm creed-minded groups
[2:33:27] out of his mouth
[2:33:29] after the church is denominated jesus
[2:33:31] moved right on into the prophetic
[2:33:33] ministry of william branham who began
[2:33:35] pastoring in 1933 and transitioned into
[2:33:38] a worldwide healing ministry in 1946
[2:33:42] here is where god would speak his
[2:33:44] unadulterated truth to the age
[2:33:47] after winning millions of souls to the
[2:33:49] lord jesus in india africa and
[2:33:51] throughout the world jesus used brother
[2:33:54] branham to correctly interpret church
[2:33:56] history through a series he preached on
[2:33:57] the seven church ages in 1960.
[2:34:00] in march 1963 christ loosed the
[2:34:03] revelations of the seven seals and had
[2:34:05] branham preached them with the prophetic
[2:34:07] validation of thus saith the lord
[2:34:11] following branham's death in 1965 the
[2:34:13] true bride has been taking jesus's end
[2:34:16] time revelations around the world
[2:34:18] believers have experienced the
[2:34:19] continuation of god's revival by
[2:34:22] faithfully acting upon branham's
[2:34:23] revelations from the spirit
[2:34:25] the bride's eyes are anointed with
[2:34:27] jesus's eye self in fulfillment of
[2:34:30] ephesians 1 verses 17-18
[2:34:33] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[2:34:36] the father of glory may give unto you
[2:34:38] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[2:34:40] the knowledge of him the eyes of your
[2:34:42] understanding being enlightened that ye
[2:34:45] may know what is the hope of his calling
[2:34:47] and what the riches of the glory of his
[2:34:49] inheritance in the saints
[2:34:53] in this age jesus's true church is
[2:34:55] buying gold and white raiment from him
[2:34:58] through spiritual transactions of faith
[2:35:01] proverbs 23 verse 23 reads by the truth
[2:35:05] and sell it not also wisdom and
[2:35:07] instruction and understanding
[2:35:09] jesus spiritual gold is time-tested
[2:35:12] unwavering faith according to first
[2:35:14] peter 1 verse 7
[2:35:16] white raiment represents the
[2:35:18] righteousness of jesus christ manifested
[2:35:21] in a life of spiritual integrity and
[2:35:23] obedience to the holy spirit
[2:35:26] these eternal transactions are possible
[2:35:29] through jesus's rebukes and the zealous
[2:35:31] repentance of the hearers
[2:35:33] bride members in laodicea are constantly
[2:35:36] hearing convicting challenging sermons
[2:35:38] which is proof of jesus's love
[2:35:41] yet the saints rejoice in the constant
[2:35:42] correction recognizing god's unchanging
[2:35:45] method for dealing with his children
[2:35:47] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[2:35:50] and scourgeth every son whom he
[2:35:52] receiveth if ye endure chastening god
[2:35:55] dealth with you as with sons for what
[2:35:58] son is he whom the father chasteneth not
[2:36:00] but if ye be without chastisement
[2:36:02] whereof all are partakers then ye are
[2:36:05] bastards and not sons
[2:36:07] as paul promised the preaching of the
[2:36:09] five full ministry will perfect or
[2:36:11] complete jesus's bride believers will
[2:36:14] hear jesus knocking on their hearts door
[2:36:17] for his fellowship and let him in for
[2:36:19] supper
[2:36:20] the first course of christ's meal will
[2:36:22] be milk for the newborn christian
[2:36:25] according to first peter 2 verses 1-3
[2:36:28] after growing up in maturity the second
[2:36:30] course will be meet feeding the hungry
[2:36:33] heart with spiritual discernment to
[2:36:35] judge every action as either evil or
[2:36:37] good
[2:36:39] in an age where riches and mega churches
[2:36:41] are exalted and falsely connected to
[2:36:44] spiritual attainment jesus true bride
[2:36:46] will be rich in faith
[2:36:48] through passionate prayers loving care
[2:36:50] for fellow christians daily repentance
[2:36:53] and fellowship with jesus she will
[2:36:55] overcome the spiritual complacency
[2:36:58] plaguing this age
[2:37:00] the laodicean age climaxes with a true
[2:37:03] vine being raptured to the sky to meet
[2:37:05] her husband christ in the air while the
[2:37:08] world suffers through the tribulation
[2:37:11] revelation 4 verses 1 and 2 offers a
[2:37:14] beautiful type of this catching away as
[2:37:16] john represents the bride called up to
[2:37:18] heaven before the throne of god
[2:37:21] immediately after the end of the
[2:37:22] laodicean message
[2:37:24] after this i looked and behold a door
[2:37:27] was opened in heaven and the first voice
[2:37:29] which i heard was as it were of a
[2:37:31] trumpet talking with me which said come
[2:37:33] up hither and i will show thee the
[2:37:35] things which must be hereafter
[2:37:38] and immediately i was in the spirit and
[2:37:40] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[2:37:42] one sat on the throne
[2:37:46] iniquity of the false vine
[2:37:48] no other bible passage records such a
[2:37:50] scathing judgment as the false vine
[2:37:52] receives from jesus as the time of the
[2:37:55] gentiles come to a close
[2:37:57] christ's first assessment is his
[2:37:59] sickness over their lukewarm spiritual
[2:38:01] state the true vine is hot but the false
[2:38:04] is lukewarm which means tepid lukewarm
[2:38:08] metaphoric of the condition of the soul
[2:38:10] wretchedly fluctuating between a torpor
[2:38:13] and a fervor of love in the greek
[2:38:16] their wishy-washy works sometimes
[2:38:18] fervent but mostly lethargic may christ
[2:38:21] vomit calling to mind isaiah 28 verses
[2:38:24] 1-13 specifically verse 8 says baxter
[2:38:29] and israel's tables are full of vomit
[2:38:31] and filthiness so that there is no place
[2:38:34] clean
[2:38:35] isaiah says israel's pride drunkenness
[2:38:37] and perverted judgments caused the once
[2:38:40] holy tables to be covered in vomit
[2:38:44] the same conditions have repeated in the
[2:38:46] modern mother-daughter catholic
[2:38:48] protestant church system
[2:38:50] the pride natural and spiritual
[2:38:52] drunkenness and lack of sound doctrine
[2:38:54] and bible-based judgments makes jesus
[2:38:57] sick
[2:38:58] he spews these churches out of his mouth
[2:39:00] meaning he no longer speaks through
[2:39:01] their pulpits
[2:39:03] truly jesus is not speaking in catholic
[2:39:05] lutheran methodist baptist and
[2:39:07] pentecostal denominations you hear the
[2:39:10] groups compromising with and exalting
[2:39:12] sin you do not hear them issuing holy
[2:39:15] judgments with thus saith the lord like
[2:39:17] the true vine who is proclaiming the
[2:39:19] seventh angel's message to the age
[2:39:23] certainly their church members are drunk
[2:39:25] with pride for jesus records their
[2:39:27] despicable self-assessment i am rich and
[2:39:30] increase with goods and have need of
[2:39:32] nothing
[2:39:33] the false fine is delighted with
[2:39:35] physical riches and goods and feels no
[2:39:37] need for the holy ghost spiritual
[2:39:39] revivals or repentance they refuse any
[2:39:42] further revelation of scripture and only
[2:39:44] accept changes to their bylaws that will
[2:39:47] swell their number of members
[2:39:49] they will accept female clergy
[2:39:51] homosexual clergy transgender members
[2:39:54] and repeated adulterers into their
[2:39:56] vomit-filled sanctuaries it sounds harsh
[2:39:59] but it is jesus judgment upon an age
[2:40:01] that wants its own rights and rules
[2:40:04] rather than god's rules yes the false
[2:40:06] fine does not want to follow god's rule
[2:40:09] and has long forgot paul's command for
[2:40:11] the saints to walk by the same rule
[2:40:14] minding the same thing in philippians 3
[2:40:16] verse 16.
[2:40:19] the name laodicea means justice of the
[2:40:21] people in the greek and every church is
[2:40:23] making their own rules to meet the
[2:40:25] demands and rights of sinful adulterers
[2:40:28] homosexuals transgenders liars
[2:40:31] blasphemers child molesters and the rest
[2:40:35] since the mark of the beast comes out of
[2:40:36] the united states also known as the
[2:40:39] beast out of the land in revelation 13
[2:40:41] notice the drastic submission of the
[2:40:43] government and churches to the rights of
[2:40:46] sin-loving workers of iniquity
[2:40:49] while america's founding fathers were
[2:40:51] far from perfect many possessed sincere
[2:40:53] faith in christ
[2:40:55] from the time of the revolutionary war
[2:40:56] to the civil war there were numerous
[2:40:58] government proclaimed days of prayer
[2:41:01] humiliation and fasting
[2:41:03] both washington and lincoln called and
[2:41:06] participated in these holy days
[2:41:08] historian david barton reports 29 out of
[2:41:11] the 56 signers of the declaration of
[2:41:14] independence had seminary degrees which
[2:41:17] is why america's founding documents are
[2:41:19] rich in biblical references and
[2:41:21] principles
[2:41:23] like israel america quickly fell from
[2:41:26] her humble god-fearing beginnings the
[2:41:28] roaring twenties saw the rise of
[2:41:30] rebellious women who cut their hair for
[2:41:32] the first time wore makeup miniskirts
[2:41:35] smoked and danced in defiance to god's
[2:41:38] holiness
[2:41:39] most men permitted it in weakness fear
[2:41:42] and shame hollywood rose during the
[2:41:45] great depression and it has constantly
[2:41:47] ushered in cultural corruption ever
[2:41:49] since rebellious rock and roll in the
[2:41:52] 1950s planted the seeds for the sexual
[2:41:54] revolution of the 1960s
[2:41:57] the mother harlot roman catholic church
[2:41:59] mounted on and began riding her final
[2:42:02] beast the american beast out of the land
[2:42:04] when john f kennedy became the first
[2:42:06] catholic president in november 1960.
[2:42:09] prayer was taken out of schools in 1962
[2:42:13] followed by the legalization of
[2:42:14] murdering babies in 1973.
[2:42:17] abortion has now claimed over 50 million
[2:42:19] innocent lives whose blood cries to god
[2:42:22] for vengeance from american soil
[2:42:25] homosexuality was removed from the list
[2:42:27] of mental disorders in 1973 and on june
[2:42:31] 26 2015 the supreme court legalized this
[2:42:35] abomination
[2:42:37] just as jesus says this age is indeed
[2:42:40] wretched and miserable and poor and
[2:42:42] blind and naked
[2:42:44] yet he says they do not know their
[2:42:46] deplorable condition because they have
[2:42:48] purposely failed to retain god's
[2:42:50] knowledge in their minds
[2:42:52] romans 1 verse 28 proves this saying and
[2:42:55] even as they did not like to retain god
[2:42:57] in their knowledge god gave them over to
[2:42:59] reprobate mind to do those things which
[2:43:02] are not convenient
[2:43:04] looking deeper in verse 28 the false
[2:43:06] vine knew the truth at one time
[2:43:08] but is since blasphemed the truth and
[2:43:10] accepted lies
[2:43:12] they will be destroyed because they
[2:43:13] rejected god's knowledge just as hosea 4
[2:43:16] verse 6 reads
[2:43:18] my people are destroyed for a lack of
[2:43:20] knowledge
[2:43:20] because thou has rejected knowledge i
[2:43:23] will also reject thee that thou shalt be
[2:43:25] no priest to me seeing thou has
[2:43:27] forgotten the law of thy god i will also
[2:43:30] forget thy children
[2:43:33] as i conclude writing this book in
[2:43:34] february 2021
[2:43:37] america and the world are in shambles
[2:43:39] more ripe than ever for judgment through
[2:43:42] massive voter fraud america has her
[2:43:44] second catholic president joe biden
[2:43:47] signaling afresh the vatican's grip upon
[2:43:49] the nation and the world
[2:43:51] coronavirus foretold by jesus as a
[2:43:54] pestilence in matthew 24 verse 7 has
[2:43:57] weakened the world economy stolen the
[2:43:59] rights of public worshippers and taken
[2:44:01] over one million lives
[2:44:03] but this is just the beginning since
[2:44:05] jesus says all pestilences and
[2:44:07] earthquakes are just the beginning of
[2:44:09] sorrows for this rebellious sinful world
[2:44:13] violent rioting and arson has decimated
[2:44:15] some american cities with one group in
[2:44:17] portland oregon burning bibles and
[2:44:20] american flags
[2:44:21] other groups are calling for statues of
[2:44:23] jesus to come down
[2:44:25] the black lives matter movement is
[2:44:27] leading the protests which claims to be
[2:44:29] a peaceful organization but some of its
[2:44:31] members escalate their protests into
[2:44:34] violent destruction even murdering
[2:44:36] innocent children and police officers
[2:44:38] christians believe black lives matter
[2:44:41] along with all lives including the
[2:44:43] unborn but the spirit of sodom is upon
[2:44:45] the blm movement as one of its goals is
[2:44:48] to disrupt the nuclear family in order
[2:44:51] to exalt the
[2:44:53] lgbtq agenda
[2:44:55] jesus warned the sodomite culture would
[2:44:57] return in luke 17 verses 29 and 30 and
[2:45:01] the same violent holiness hating mobs
[2:45:04] from sodom have re-emerged on american
[2:45:07] soil
[2:45:09] no one knows how long it will be until
[2:45:10] canceled culture targets true christians
[2:45:13] but the false vine will fully support
[2:45:16] stopping the true vine from preaching
[2:45:17] and ministering to the needy in
[2:45:19] fulfillment of revelation 13 verses 15
[2:45:22] through 17 the false fine churches will
[2:45:25] unite with american politics to change
[2:45:27] laws forcing all churches into a
[2:45:29] unionized religion with the threat of
[2:45:31] losing money property food and life
[2:45:34] itself if not obeyed
[2:45:36] but before their ungodly bloodthirsty
[2:45:39] laws are enacted jesus will rescue his
[2:45:41] bride into heaven in the rapture
[2:45:43] christ promised this protection to the
[2:45:45] philadelphian saints so we know it
[2:45:47] carries over to this age
[2:45:49] because thou has kept the word of my
[2:45:51] patience i will also keep thee from the
[2:45:53] hour of temptation which shall come upon
[2:45:56] all the world to try them that dwell
[2:45:58] upon the earth
[2:46:00] the false vine will misconstrue jesus's
[2:46:02] prayer for oneness in john 17 verses 11
[2:46:06] through 23 in order to promote its evil
[2:46:09] one world church
[2:46:10] it is a terror harvest a deadly
[2:46:12] impersonation do not believe it for you
[2:46:15] are the genuine wheat first peter 1
[2:46:17] verse 22 says oneness with christ only
[2:46:20] comes through obeying the truth through
[2:46:22] the holy spirit and this unionized
[2:46:25] church will promote inclusion for
[2:46:27] adulterers murderers homosexuals liars
[2:46:31] pedophiles and more world leaders will
[2:46:33] promise peace and safety but sudden
[2:46:35] destruction is their worthy reward
[2:46:39] the reward
[2:46:40] the holy one promises overcomers a seat
[2:46:43] with him on his throne
[2:46:45] even as he overcame and is set down with
[2:46:47] his father in his throne
[2:46:49] jesus reminds the overcomers how he
[2:46:51] overcame satan's temptations in matthew
[2:46:54] 4. messiah overcame the wicked one by
[2:46:57] simply quoting the rightly divided word
[2:46:59] and obeying it we overcome the same way
[2:47:02] by obeying god's word while rebuking
[2:47:05] satan with god's word on our lips
[2:47:08] indeed the word is our mighty spiritual
[2:47:10] weapon we use to rule over satan the
[2:47:13] world sin and temptation
[2:47:16] no age needs the sharp cutting
[2:47:18] discerning power of the word like this
[2:47:21] age for deception is at its peak
[2:47:24] rejoice that jesus has already made you
[2:47:26] a king and priest unto god and his
[2:47:28] father
[2:47:29] just as king david smote and subdued the
[2:47:31] land with his sword you can smite and
[2:47:34] subdue every foul demon power with god's
[2:47:37] revealed word on your lips and the
[2:47:39] shield of faith protecting your heart
[2:47:41] and mind
[2:47:43] christ's final reward is a seat next to
[2:47:45] him on the millennial throne
[2:47:47] for the new age is nearly upon us
[2:47:50] certainly jesus will rule all nations
[2:47:52] with a rod of iron but recall he has
[2:47:54] promised that overcomers will rule in a
[2:47:56] similar way
[2:47:58] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[2:48:00] works unto the end to him will i give
[2:48:02] power over the nations and he shall rule
[2:48:04] them with a rod of iron as the vessels
[2:48:07] of a potter shall they be broken to
[2:48:09] shivers even as i received of my father
[2:48:13] by the holy ghost leading an authority
[2:48:16] rule over your bodily passions family
[2:48:18] situations work situations and church
[2:48:21] situations
[2:48:22] you are not just a conqueror in one area
[2:48:25] of your life you are more than a
[2:48:26] conqueror in every aspect of life
[2:48:29] through him that loved us
[2:48:31] jesus's love is calling you to rule over
[2:48:34] sin now so that you can rule over
[2:48:36] nations later you can do it by his grace
[2:48:38] he is with you even in you
[2:48:43] supernatural vindication of the seven
[2:48:45] church ages
[2:48:46] after witnessing jfk's election in
[2:48:49] november 1960 and recognizing it as the
[2:48:52] rise of catholicism in the united states
[2:48:55] the holy spirit led william branham to
[2:48:57] embark on his most in-depth study the
[2:49:00] seven church ages
[2:49:02] through much prayer and study branham
[2:49:04] preached 13 sermons related to the
[2:49:06] church ages from december 4th 1960 to
[2:49:09] january 8 1961.
[2:49:13] on the evening of the final sermon the
[2:49:15] holy spirit descended into branham
[2:49:17] tabernacle and visibly appeared as a
[2:49:19] pillar of fire to the congregation on
[2:49:22] the back wall of the church
[2:49:24] as figure 20 shows the holy spirit shown
[2:49:27] in the same seven circular patterns
[2:49:29] branham taught for the seven church ages
[2:49:32] the circles showed how the light or
[2:49:34] truth of each age would decrease
[2:49:37] until moving in an increasing direction
[2:49:39] beginning at the sardisian age
[2:49:42] this supernatural event vindicated
[2:49:44] branham was preaching heaven's
[2:49:46] revelation of the ages and not his own
[2:49:50] audio from the event is available for
[2:49:52] you to hear
[2:49:53] as awestruck worshipers tremble scream
[2:49:56] and weep at god's visible light in
[2:49:59] orderly fashion the holy spirit first
[2:50:01] shows the church ages revelation was
[2:50:03] true and then begins to anoint his
[2:50:05] prophet branham to minister to the sick
[2:50:08] through the gift of discernment
[2:50:10] here's the text versions of this
[2:50:12] magnificent incident
[2:50:14] now look this way you all now that's
[2:50:16] just like it is when it comes under
[2:50:18] glory here
[2:50:19] see see it comes it's the light over
[2:50:22] here you're moving here you see now look
[2:50:26] it's just it's just a reflection just a
[2:50:28] reflection that is see it's not the
[2:50:31] light here's the light hanging right
[2:50:32] here see right here at this woman i just
[2:50:35] happened to catch it and i thought it
[2:50:37] was over somebody now you're seeing one
[2:50:39] and i'm seeing two one of them is the
[2:50:42] natural and the other is the
[2:50:43] supernatural there's a man sitting on
[2:50:45] the outside here along this line looking
[2:50:47] over towards that light it struck him
[2:50:50] he's from seymour indiana and he's got
[2:50:53] had a stroke if you'll believe sir god
[2:50:55] will heal you of that stroke amen
[2:50:57] believe now
[2:51:01] the seven seals
[2:51:03] chronologically speaking you must
[2:51:05] understand the revelation of the seven
[2:51:06] stars and seven candlesticks in the
[2:51:09] first three chapters of revelation in
[2:51:11] order to understand the rest of the
[2:51:13] climatic book
[2:51:15] with the true understanding of the seven
[2:51:16] church ages you can now receive the
[2:51:18] revelations of the seven seals
[2:51:21] for a complete understanding of the
[2:51:23] seven seals i strongly advise you to
[2:51:25] read william branham's the revelation of
[2:51:27] the seven seals
[2:51:29] which is a transcription of the sermon
[2:51:30] series he preached in march 1963
[2:51:34] audio of the sermon series is also
[2:51:36] available online at no cost
[2:51:40] first notice the four heavenly beasts
[2:51:42] around jesus's throne are connected to
[2:51:45] the first four seals
[2:51:46] revelation 4 verse 7 records their
[2:51:49] specific order with the first beast
[2:51:51] being like a lion the second beast like
[2:51:54] a calf the third beast with the face of
[2:51:56] a man and the fourth beast like a flying
[2:51:59] eagle
[2:52:00] the order of the beasts matches the
[2:52:02] order of the first four seals
[2:52:04] in revelation 6 verse 1 the first beast
[2:52:07] tells john about the first seal and its
[2:52:10] horse rider revelation 6 3 says the
[2:52:13] second beast the one like a calf
[2:52:15] announces the second seal and the horse
[2:52:17] rider
[2:52:18] the third beast announces the third seal
[2:52:21] in revelation 6 5 and the fourth beast
[2:52:24] announces the fourth seal in revelation
[2:52:26] 6 verse 7.
[2:52:28] notice the 5th 6th and 7th seals have no
[2:52:32] beasts announcing their symbols and no
[2:52:34] horse riders if you recall chapter 2
[2:52:37] this is because the times of the
[2:52:38] gentiles are over after the fourth seal
[2:52:41] the fifth seal deals with blinded israel
[2:52:44] being promised eternal life once the
[2:52:46] tribulation ends the sixth seal is a
[2:52:48] description of the earthly effects of
[2:52:50] the tribulation and the seventh seal is
[2:52:52] the rapture of the gentile bride which
[2:52:55] ushers in armageddon and the millennium
[2:53:00] biblical numerology of number four
[2:53:03] concerning the four beasts and four
[2:53:04] horsemen of the first four seals
[2:53:07] you see the importance of the number
[2:53:08] four
[2:53:09] in biblical numerology four is a number
[2:53:12] of godly deliverance and an earthly
[2:53:14] number
[2:53:15] satan copies and perverts god's numbers
[2:53:18] so for in his work represents total
[2:53:20] corruption

[2:55:27] the first four seals
[2:55:29] the four beasts association with the
[2:55:31] first four seals represents the
[2:55:33] characteristics of the spiritual power
[2:55:36] the true church would need during the
[2:55:38] times of the gentiles or seven church
[2:55:40] ages simply put the four beasts
[2:55:43] represent four anointings of the holy
[2:55:45] ghost jesus would send to the overcomers
[2:55:47] on earth
[2:55:49] a christian spiritual power is always
[2:55:51] the baptism of the holy ghost but these
[2:55:53] four beasts express special
[2:55:55] characteristics the spirit would provide
[2:55:58] the saints to combat satan's four horse
[2:56:00] riders during the church ages
[2:56:04] in scripture earthly beasts represent
[2:56:06] earthly kingdoms such as the beasts in
[2:56:08] daniel 7 representing babylon medes and
[2:56:12] persians greece and rome
[2:56:14] but the four heavenly beasts represent
[2:56:16] the kingdom of god upon the earth as for
[2:56:19] is an earthly number
[2:56:20] jesus earthly ministry introduced the
[2:56:22] kingdom of god which his apostles
[2:56:25] received within their souls on the day
[2:56:27] of pentecost for messiah taught the
[2:56:29] kingdom of god is within believers in
[2:56:31] luke 17 verse 21
[2:56:35] identifying the four horse riders as
[2:56:37] belonging to satan is validated by
[2:56:39] looking at their works the fourth
[2:56:41] writer's name and follower
[2:56:44] the four horse riders are actually one
[2:56:46] person death revelation 6 8 says the
[2:56:49] writer's name is death and hell followed
[2:56:52] with him
[2:56:53] the writer is the cursed antichrist
[2:56:55] spirit
[2:56:56] with his identification known his
[2:56:58] four-step process of evil works are
[2:57:00] obvious
[2:57:01] conquering killing money capturing and
[2:57:05] worldwide soul destruction
[2:57:07] chapter 10 shares how today's mega
[2:57:09] churches dominate and deceive through
[2:57:11] this four-step process
[2:57:14] during the times of the gentiles satan
[2:57:17] is now taking the form of four horse
[2:57:19] riders
[2:57:20] he began as lucifer the heavenly
[2:57:22] lightbearer then entered the serpent in
[2:57:24] eden filled murderous cain and his
[2:57:26] descendants and then filled the
[2:57:28] pharisees in judas
[2:57:30] marvel not for though satan transforms
[2:57:32] from an angel of light to serpent to
[2:57:35] violent jealous worshipper to
[2:57:37] blaspheming religious clergy he is
[2:57:40] always discerned and overcome by the
[2:57:42] holy ghost
[2:57:44] yes the four horse riders are the same
[2:57:46] writer in different forms just as the
[2:57:48] four insects from joel 1 verse 4
[2:57:52] palmerworm locust cankerworm caterpillar
[2:57:55] are the same insect in different stages
[2:57:57] of life from embryo to adult
[2:58:00] the attributes of each horse rider can
[2:58:02] be perfectly aligned with the church
[2:58:04] history presented in this chapter to
[2:58:07] show the four stages of the antichrist
[2:58:09] spirit as it heads up into death here in
[2:58:12] the final age laodicea
[2:58:15] god always acts first and then satan
[2:58:17] impersonates it just as god set up his
[2:58:20] throne in heaven first and later lucifer
[2:58:22] tried to exalt his throne above the
[2:58:24] stars of god
[2:58:26] historically god sent his first
[2:58:28] anointing the lion on the day of
[2:58:30] pentecost to seal his saints and prepare
[2:58:33] them for the battle to come
[2:58:35] in a counter-attack satan rode out
[2:58:37] against the lion as a white horse rider
[2:58:40] the process repeats until the true bride
[2:58:42] is raptured off the earth and god judges
[2:58:44] the sin-soaked world in the tribulation
[2:58:48] the first seal
[2:58:50] revelation 6 verses 1 and 2 records the
[2:58:53] lamb opening the first seal and the
[2:58:55] beast has to be the lion because the
[2:58:57] second third and fourth beasts are
[2:58:59] mentioned by order in the three
[2:59:01] succeeding seals
[2:59:03] john sees a white horse and a rider has
[2:59:05] a bow but no arrows are mentioned
[2:59:08] the rider is then crowned and goes forth
[2:59:10] conquering
[2:59:12] the lion anointing is the fierce
[2:59:14] boldness of the holy ghost the saints
[2:59:17] embodied during the ephesian and
[2:59:18] sumernian church ages and even into the
[2:59:21] pergamos age
[2:59:23] proverbs 28 verse 1 declares the wicked
[2:59:26] flee when no man pursueth but the
[2:59:28] righteous are bold as a lion saints like
[2:59:31] paul iranius and martin boldly stood for
[2:59:34] christ and christ stood for them
[2:59:37] manifesting prophecies healings visions
[2:59:39] and special miracles the powerful line
[2:59:42] of the tribe of judah was with the true
[2:59:44] vine to combat and overcome the
[2:59:47] antichrist spirit
[2:59:49] the white color of the horse represents
[2:59:52] innocent deception as white often
[2:59:54] represents holiness but since the writer
[2:59:57] is the antichrist spirit his white horse
[2:59:59] represents his sly false teachings which
[3:00:03] jesus called the deeds of the
[3:00:04] nicolaitans
[3:00:06] a horse is a beast and represents power
[3:00:08] as horses are appropriately described so
[3:00:11] in job 39 verses 19-25
[3:00:16] the rider has a bow but no arrows are
[3:00:18] mentioned
[3:00:19] here you learn two truths the antichrist
[3:00:22] spirit shot his lies like arrows from
[3:00:24] the bow of his tongue
[3:00:25] as jeremiah 9 verse 3 describes
[3:00:28] and they bend their tongues like their
[3:00:30] bow for lies
[3:00:32] your shield of faith quenches all of
[3:00:33] satan's fiery darts or lies
[3:00:36] according to ephesians 6 verse 16.
[3:00:39] second you learn satan is limited in his
[3:00:41] power for he was out of arrows
[3:00:44] he is the father of lies and as long as
[3:00:46] you withstand his untruths he cannot
[3:00:49] hurt you and make any christian disobey
[3:00:51] god
[3:00:53] a crown is given to the rider
[3:00:55] representing the first official pope
[3:00:57] damascus being crowned in 366 a.d
[3:01:01] rome conquered or overcame the lady by
[3:01:04] mixing sinful deeds in worship and
[3:01:06] exalting the clergy
[3:01:09] the lion-like holy ghost anointing
[3:01:11] battled the white horse rider for about
[3:01:13] 350 years from pentecost in 30 a.d to
[3:01:17] 385 a.d this was the fight between the
[3:01:21] bold living word and false teaching
[3:01:25] the second seal revelation 6 verses 3
[3:01:28] and 4 records jesus opening the second
[3:01:30] seal and the second beast inviting john
[3:01:33] to come and see
[3:01:35] another horse rides this time a red one
[3:01:37] and he takes peace from the earth with a
[3:01:39] great sword
[3:01:41] the ox anointing is the sacrificial
[3:01:43] surrender of the holy ghost the saints
[3:01:46] expressed during the pergam age and part
[3:01:48] of the thyatiran age
[3:01:50] oxen were beasts of sacrifice and so
[3:01:52] christians in these ages gave their
[3:01:54] lives just as freely as god gave them to
[3:01:57] them
[3:01:58] recall priscillian and six of his
[3:02:00] disciples were said to be the first
[3:02:02] saints executed by the roman church in
[3:02:05] 385 a.d
[3:02:08] the red color of the horse represents
[3:02:09] the blood
[3:02:10] the rider shed with his great sword
[3:02:13] during the pergamian age church and
[3:02:15] state united through constantine and now
[3:02:18] the false church had power to kill
[3:02:19] anyone who opposed her
[3:02:21] it was augustine 354-430
[3:02:24] who emboldened popes to kill anyone who
[3:02:27] disagreed with them
[3:02:28] as rome took the bible from the people
[3:02:30] she also took peace from the earth for
[3:02:33] christ and his word is the only real
[3:02:35] peace
[3:02:37] the acts like holy ghost anointing
[3:02:39] battled the red horse rider for nearly
[3:02:41] 710 years from 385 a.d to about 1095 a.d
[3:02:46] this was the fight between sacrificial
[3:02:48] saints and the roman sword
[3:02:52] the third seal
[3:02:53] revelation 6 verses 5 and 6 records
[3:02:56] jesus opening the seal and the third
[3:02:59] beast inviting john to see a black horse
[3:03:01] rider with a pair of balances in his
[3:03:03] hand
[3:03:04] a voice in the midst of the four beasts
[3:03:06] determines prices for trade and also
[3:03:09] protects oil and wine
[3:03:12] the man anointing is the wisdom of god
[3:03:14] given to saints during part of the
[3:03:16] thyroid age and in the entire sardisian
[3:03:19] and philadelphian ages
[3:03:21] while mankind is not the largest fastest
[3:03:23] or strongest living thing he is the
[3:03:25] wisest due to the spirit and soul god
[3:03:28] imparts to him
[3:03:30] the anointing of man's wisdom was needed
[3:03:32] to prepare the saints to conquer during
[3:03:34] the reformation
[3:03:35] recall how the last works of
[3:03:37] authoritarian saints were greater than
[3:03:39] their works at the beginning of the age
[3:03:41] in preparation for reformation
[3:03:45] the black horse represents the dark or
[3:03:47] middle ages
[3:03:48] it was a spiritual midnight for
[3:03:49] believers as their numbers were depleted
[3:03:52] along with their access to and
[3:03:54] understanding of the scripture the
[3:03:56] balances in the writer's hand represent
[3:03:59] rome capturing the wealth of the world
[3:04:01] stripping her subjects of all their
[3:04:02] wealth
[3:04:03] rome grew rich by controlling religion
[3:04:06] economics and agriculture
[3:04:08] she also funded her mammoth buildings by
[3:04:10] waging the crusades beginning in 1095
[3:04:13] a.d and fighting other papal wars
[3:04:16] pope john xx showed future popes how to
[3:04:20] increase wealth through his profitable
[3:04:22] business of selling indulgences around 1
[3:04:25] 320 a.d
[3:04:28] the voice in the midst of the four
[3:04:30] beasts has to be gods since the beasts
[3:04:32] were around the throne worshiping the
[3:04:34] lord
[3:04:35] surely this is jesus's voice announcing
[3:04:38] exposing and limiting the financial
[3:04:40] aspirations of the black horse writer
[3:04:43] heaven is ultimately in control limiting
[3:04:46] rome's financial reach
[3:04:48] heaven is providing for the saints even
[3:04:50] in the dark ages
[3:04:51] we and barley have both a natural and
[3:04:54] spiritual meaning as jesus sees rome's
[3:04:56] efforts to get rich by selling natural
[3:04:59] food wheat and barley and selling false
[3:05:01] spiritual hope through indulgences
[3:05:05] the lord jesus protects the wine and oil
[3:05:07] forbidding the antichrist from hurting
[3:05:09] or injuring these two necessities
[3:05:12] of course jesus is speaking figuratively
[3:05:15] oil represents the permanent seal of the
[3:05:16] holy ghost baptism in a believer's soul
[3:05:19] and wine represents stimulation or joy
[3:05:22] from the spirit's revelation
[3:05:24] satan would not be able to hurt or
[3:05:26] hinder the true vine during these times
[3:05:29] during even the darkest times of the
[3:05:31] dark ages
[3:05:32] satan could not stop believers from
[3:05:34] receiving the holy ghost baptism and the
[3:05:36] joyful stimulation that accompanies it
[3:05:39] historically jesus protected the saints
[3:05:41] as the holy ghost revival fires
[3:05:44] continued to burn in the dark ages
[3:05:46] through men like pierre day bruise
[3:05:48] martyred in 1126
[3:05:51] and peter waldo
[3:05:53] waldo's converts called waldensies
[3:05:56] powerfully spread the holy ghost gospel
[3:05:58] to ensure monasteries and parishes
[3:06:00] existed in many countries like france
[3:06:04] italy austria switzerland germany and
[3:06:07] bohemia to name a few these saints
[3:06:10] passed on the wine and oil until the
[3:06:12] pre-reformation saints like wycliffe
[3:06:14] huss gutenberg and erasmus could receive
[3:06:18] these blessings
[3:06:20] during the sardisian and philadelphian
[3:06:22] church ages christ administered wine and
[3:06:24] oil to luther wesley and many more
[3:06:27] laborers none would dare deny the holy
[3:06:29] man anointing upon luther defying every
[3:06:33] demon-possessed roman scholar whose
[3:06:35] sword-like wisdom cut and rightly
[3:06:37] divided the truth about salvation by
[3:06:40] faith alone apart from sacraments
[3:06:43] all the spiritual warriors from these
[3:06:45] ages possessed this man anointing
[3:06:48] overcoming the black horse rider in
[3:06:50] their unique callings
[3:06:53] the man anointing combated the black
[3:06:54] horse rider for nearly 850 years from
[3:06:58] 1095 a.d to 1906 a.d this was the fight
[3:07:02] between the wisdom of god's men and the
[3:07:05] money-hungry mother harlot
[3:07:08] the fourth seal
[3:07:09] revelation 6 verses 7 and 8 records
[3:07:12] jesus opening the seal and the fourth
[3:07:14] beast inviting john to come and see the
[3:07:16] pale horse rider go forth with hell
[3:07:19] following him
[3:07:20] power will be given them over a fourth
[3:07:22] part of the earth to kill with sword
[3:07:24] hunger death and beasts
[3:07:28] the flying eagle anointing is
[3:07:30] watchfulness saints keep during the
[3:07:32] laodicean age
[3:07:34] flying eagles watch for prey and
[3:07:36] potential adversaries ruling their
[3:07:38] territory from high altitudes
[3:07:40] jesus urges believers to sit in heavenly
[3:07:42] places and watch and pray for a second
[3:07:45] coming making their hearts and lives
[3:07:47] ready for their lord's return
[3:07:49] holy ghost-filled saints are
[3:07:51] rapture-minded meaning their thoughts
[3:07:53] are on the heavenly meeting in the air
[3:07:55] spoken of in first thessalonians 4 verse
[3:07:57] 17.
[3:07:58] our affections should be set on things
[3:08:00] above like the rapture as colossians 3
[3:08:04] verses 1 and 2 declares like a
[3:08:06] high-flying eagle we must press toward
[3:08:08] the mark for the prize of the high
[3:08:10] calling of god in christ jesus
[3:08:14] jesus uses the eagle to represent
[3:08:16] end-time believers in matthew 24 verses
[3:08:19] 25 through 28 saying in verse 28
[3:08:23] for wheresoever the carcass is there
[3:08:25] will the eagles be gathered together
[3:08:28] verse 27 tells you jesus is speaking of
[3:08:30] his second coming so you must be one of
[3:08:32] those blessed eagles anointed with god's
[3:08:35] flying eagle power
[3:08:37] the lord likens himself to an eagle in
[3:08:39] exodus 19 verse 4 proving you as his
[3:08:42] born-again child are of heavenly eagle
[3:08:45] lineage
[3:08:46] psalm 103 verse 5 and isaiah 40 verse 31
[3:08:50] declare he renews your strength like the
[3:08:53] eagle
[3:08:54] his strength helps you fly or live above
[3:08:57] all earthbound temptations today and
[3:08:59] will lift you into the air to meet jesus
[3:09:02] at the rapture
[3:09:04] the pale horse represents the incurable
[3:09:06] disease of spiritual death striking
[3:09:08] billions now in the end time
[3:09:11] remember the writer's name is death from
[3:09:13] revelation 6 8 and so the antichrist
[3:09:16] spirit is death leading to eternal
[3:09:18] separation from christ
[3:09:20] in the greek pale means green and
[3:09:23] reminds us of the greenish plague of
[3:09:25] leprosy from leviticus 13 verses 47
[3:09:28] through 49. if untreated and unhealed
[3:09:32] uncleanness from leprosy cause
[3:09:34] separation from the camp and ultimately
[3:09:36] death
[3:09:38] this green pale horse also symbolizes
[3:09:41] the final earthly ride of the person of
[3:09:44] the pope antichrist whose final ride in
[3:09:46] the tribulation will result in a fourth
[3:09:49] part of the earth being killed with a
[3:09:50] sword hunger death and beasts
[3:09:54] the incarnate devil antichrist will lay
[3:09:57] down the mark of the beast and any
[3:09:59] dissenters will be killed according to
[3:10:01] his fourfold strategy while he is
[3:10:04] killing on his last earthly ride jesus's
[3:10:06] bride will be safely overhead in heaven
[3:10:09] having already flown like an eagle into
[3:10:11] the skies to meet jesus at the rapture
[3:10:15] note how the writer also kills with
[3:10:17] death
[3:10:18] this speaks of spiritual death also
[3:10:20] known as blasphemy of the holy ghost or
[3:10:23] a reprobate mind in scripture recall
[3:10:26] samuel schmucker's tally of over 68
[3:10:28] million christians who died from the
[3:10:30] sword in the 5th and 19th centuries
[3:10:34] those were natural deaths how many souls
[3:10:36] were killed with spiritual death or
[3:10:38] blasphemy of the holy ghost during those
[3:10:40] times
[3:10:41] no doubt millions upon billions died
[3:10:44] from spiritual death from rome's false
[3:10:46] doctrines of idolatry fornication and
[3:10:49] lasciviousness
[3:10:50] but in the end time
[3:10:52] death rides into a fourth part of the
[3:10:54] earth and kills nearly every remaining
[3:10:56] soul both naturally and spiritually
[3:11:00] hell always follows death like the evil
[3:11:03] rich man who despised the beggar lazarus
[3:11:05] he found himself in hell after his death
[3:11:08] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[3:11:10] and was carried by the angels into
[3:11:12] abraham's bosom the rich man also died
[3:11:15] and was buried and in hell he lifted up
[3:11:17] his eyes being in torments and seeth
[3:11:20] abraham afar off and lazarus in his
[3:11:23] bosom
[3:11:24] all beast worshippers share the same
[3:11:26] fate for denying the lamb's path to
[3:11:29] eternal life
[3:11:32] the fifth sixth and seventh seals
[3:11:36] the final three seals make no mention of
[3:11:38] horse riders or the four heavenly beasts
[3:11:41] because god's focus is off the gentiles
[3:11:44] and on the jews signaling the times of
[3:11:46] the gentiles
[3:11:48] defined by jesus in luke 21 24 are over
[3:11:52] god is again dealing with israel
[3:11:54] graciously offering them the new
[3:11:56] covenant for the second time
[3:11:59] the fifth seal
[3:12:00] found in revelation 6 verses 9 9-11
[3:12:04] chapter 2 details the revelation of the
[3:12:06] fifth seal
[3:12:07] despite most of israel being blinded to
[3:12:09] jesus's identity as the messiah he saves
[3:12:12] all faithful jews who gave or live their
[3:12:15] lives for the testimony of the word of
[3:12:17] god the old testament scriptures
[3:12:21] the sixth seal
[3:12:22] found in revelation 6 verses 12 through
[3:12:25] 17
[3:12:26] chapter 2 also details the revelation of
[3:12:28] this seal
[3:12:30] the wrathful indescribable punishments
[3:12:32] in the great tribulation upon beast
[3:12:34] worshipers
[3:12:35] the seven trumpets and seven last
[3:12:37] plagues mentioned in revelation chapters
[3:12:40] 8 9 11 15 and 16 outline each miserable
[3:12:45] destructive event
[3:12:47] this is the reality form of the pale
[3:12:49] horse's final earthly ride
[3:12:52] jesus provides matching details about
[3:12:54] the tribulation in matthew 24 verses
[3:12:57] 29-31
[3:12:59] again none of the four heavenly beasts
[3:13:02] lion ox man or eagle are mentioned in
[3:13:05] the sixth seal because the anointed
[3:13:07] saints are off the earth feasting with
[3:13:10] christ at the marriage supper of the
[3:13:11] lamb
[3:13:13] the seventh seal
[3:13:15] found in revelation 8 verses 1 through 6
[3:13:18] the seventh seal is the most mysterious
[3:13:21] verse 1 says heaven is silent when this
[3:13:23] seal opens which means the four beasts
[3:13:26] stop their unceasing day and night
[3:13:28] crying of holy holy holy before god's
[3:13:31] throne where jesus sits
[3:13:34] the only reason angels would stop
[3:13:35] worshiping jesus would be because jesus
[3:13:38] left heaven the next time jesus leaves
[3:13:40] heaven will be to meet his bride in the
[3:13:42] air at the rapture
[3:13:44] you can easily see the seventh seal is
[3:13:46] the unknown day and hour of jesus's
[3:13:49] second coming
[3:13:50] it is the moment of the last trump the
[3:13:52] third and final event of the rapture
[3:13:55] first the shout then the voice and
[3:13:57] lastly the trump
[3:13:59] at this moment believers which are alive
[3:14:01] and remain on the earth are changed from
[3:14:03] corruptable to incorruptable then rise
[3:14:06] to meet jesus and the dead in christ in
[3:14:08] the sky
[3:14:10] revelation 8 verse 6 gives proof that
[3:14:13] the judgments of god have not yet
[3:14:15] occurred because the trumpets are
[3:14:17] prepared to sound but have not yet
[3:14:19] sounded
[3:14:20] revelation 8 verse 1 shows the rapture
[3:14:22] takes place before the 7 trumpets sound
[3:14:26] the tribulation cannot begin until after
[3:14:28] the rapture
[3:14:30] revelations 7 verses 1 through 12
[3:14:33] teaches the earth cannot be hurt by the
[3:14:35] effects of the seven trumpets
[3:14:37] until the 144 thousand jews are sealed
[3:14:41] by the holy ghost
[3:14:42] clearly the faithful jews are sealed by
[3:14:45] the spirit during the tribulation after
[3:14:47] the jew gentile bride is raptured and
[3:14:50] the times of the gentiles are completed
[3:14:52] the seven seals jesus snatching away his
[3:14:54] wife off the earth while heaven is
[3:14:57] making ready for judgments upon the
[3:14:59] sinners
[3:15:01] seven is god's number of completion so
[3:15:03] the seventh seal speaks of jesus
[3:15:05] bringing an ending to the times of the
[3:15:07] gentiles or seven church ages
[3:15:10] jesus's great commission is finished
[3:15:12] every nation has heard and the elect
[3:15:15] have received the holy spirit
[3:15:17] mercy is over for the gentiles and
[3:15:19] israel's blindness will now be taken
[3:15:21] away the 144 thousand guileless israeli
[3:15:25] saints will be grafted back into god's
[3:15:27] holy tree by the baptism of the holy
[3:15:30] ghost
[3:15:32] the revelation of the seven seals
[3:15:34] brought to earth
[3:15:36] it may surprise you to know that the
[3:15:38] interpretation you just read of the
[3:15:40] seven seals was sent to the earth in
[3:15:42] march 1963.
[3:15:45] while i understand the gravity of this
[3:15:46] statement i maintain its accuracy
[3:15:49] because god's prophet william branham
[3:15:51] spoke the interpretation of the seven
[3:15:53] seals with thus saith the lord look now
[3:15:56] to see how scripture foretold the
[3:15:58] revelation of the seals coming to earth
[3:16:02] revelation 10 shows the interpretation
[3:16:04] or revelation of the seven seals being
[3:16:06] brought to earth by a mighty angel
[3:16:09] which must be christ in the form of the
[3:16:11] holy ghost because his description
[3:16:13] matches john's earlier vision of jesus
[3:16:15] in revelation 1 verses 13-16 the holy
[3:16:19] ghost met branham daily between march
[3:16:22] 18th through the 24th 1963
[3:16:25] to reveal each seal to him before he
[3:16:28] went to the pulpit to preach
[3:16:31] revelation 10 verse 2 says a little open
[3:16:33] book is in jesus hand as he reigns over
[3:16:37] the sea and earth this is the same seven
[3:16:39] seal book jesus took in revelation 5
[3:16:42] verses 1 through 5 and then loosed or
[3:16:45] opened in revelation 6 and 8 verse 1.
[3:16:49] the revelation of the seven seals had to
[3:16:52] be brought to earth by christ's spirit
[3:16:54] for he was the only one worthy to loose
[3:16:56] the seals
[3:16:58] in revelation 10 verse 3 christ cries
[3:17:01] like a lion for he is the lion of the
[3:17:03] tribe of judah seven thunders utter
[3:17:05] their voices as christ cries but john is
[3:17:08] not allowed to write what was spoken
[3:17:11] verse 7 says when the mystery of god
[3:17:14] contained in the voices of the seven
[3:17:15] thunders would be finished or performed
[3:17:18] in the days of the seventh angel
[3:17:22] the seventh angel of revelation 10 verse
[3:17:24] 7 cannot be the heavenly angelic
[3:17:26] trumpet-blowing seventh angel from
[3:17:28] revelation 11 15 because their
[3:17:31] ministries are totally different
[3:17:33] when the seventh trumpet blows in
[3:17:35] revelation 11 15 the kingdoms of this
[3:17:38] world end and christ reigns on the earth
[3:17:40] in the millennium
[3:17:41] simply put the times of the gentiles
[3:17:44] ends and there is no more saving souls
[3:17:46] or missionary work to be done once the
[3:17:48] seventh trumpet sounds
[3:17:51] but in revelation 10 verse 7 and its
[3:17:53] following verses 8 through 11 speak of
[3:17:56] further soul saving to the gentiles
[3:17:58] verse 11 says the prophecy contained in
[3:18:01] the interpretation of the seven seals
[3:18:03] must be prophesied again before many
[3:18:06] peoples and nations and tongues and
[3:18:08] kings
[3:18:10] the revelation 10 verse 7 seventh angel
[3:18:13] has to be the same seventh angel to the
[3:18:15] church in laodicea from revelation 3
[3:18:18] verse 14
[3:18:19] because both have a final worldwide
[3:18:21] message to the gentiles
[3:18:23] jesus said in matthew 24 14 that the
[3:18:26] gospel must be preached to all nations
[3:18:28] and then the end of human history would
[3:18:30] come
[3:18:32] in simplest terms revelation 10 is
[3:18:35] jesus's spirit coming to earth in march
[3:18:37] of 1963 to give the interpretation of
[3:18:40] the seven seals to william branham
[3:18:43] now you and i like john must spiritually
[3:18:46] eat the revelation of the seven seals
[3:18:48] and preach it to all nations for a
[3:18:50] witness and then the end shall come
[3:18:53] share them until the last soul is saved
[3:18:55] until the fullness of the gentiles be
[3:18:57] come in
[3:18:59] the seven thunders are the revelations
[3:19:01] contained in the seven sermons william
[3:19:03] branham preached on the seven seals
[3:19:06] when branham preached the first seal on
[3:19:08] monday march 18 1963 he shared jesus's
[3:19:12] revelation of the first seal
[3:19:14] since it was jesus's revelation it was
[3:19:16] his voice thundering upon the earth
[3:19:19] each succeeding sermon about a seal was
[3:19:22] another thunder until all seven were
[3:19:24] complete
[3:19:25] numerous scriptures teach god's voice is
[3:19:28] like a thunder
[3:19:29] second samuel 22 14 says
[3:19:32] the lord thundered from heaven and the
[3:19:34] most high uttered his voice
[3:19:36] the people who heard god's voice
[3:19:38] speaking to christ in john 12
[3:19:41] 28 and 29 said it thundered
[3:19:45] christ's voice has thundered on the
[3:19:46] earth
[3:19:47] daniel 12 4 has been fulfilled the
[3:19:50] once-sealed book is now loosed for it is
[3:19:53] the time of the end when travel
[3:19:55] technology and knowledge has increased
[3:19:58] chapter 13 will explain more about the
[3:20:00] prophecies we are to prophesy again to
[3:20:03] the world
[3:20:06] the church age is foretold in judges and
[3:20:08] joshua
[3:20:09] leaving the seven seals and returning to
[3:20:11] the church ages recall from chapter 4
[3:20:14] that the church ages were foretold in
[3:20:16] judges 14 when samson held a seven-day
[3:20:19] feast for his perspective philistine
[3:20:22] gentile wife samson's riddle is not
[3:20:24] known until his gentile bride reveals it
[3:20:27] on the seventh and final day
[3:20:29] this type that the full revelation of
[3:20:30] god's bible would be made known to and
[3:20:34] through jesus's gentile bride in the
[3:20:36] seventh church age or laodicean age
[3:20:39] revelation 10 verse 7 supports this as
[3:20:41] the mystery of god would be finished
[3:20:44] through the seventh angel messenger and
[3:20:46] then taken around the world to every
[3:20:48] gentile nation by jesus's bride
[3:20:52] additionally william branham's god
[3:20:54] ordained teaching on the church ages was
[3:20:56] foretold in joshua chapters 18 and 19.
[3:21:00] note the sermons were preached in
[3:21:02] december through january 1960 through
[3:21:05] 1961 and the book version and exposition
[3:21:08] of the seven church ages was published
[3:21:10] in december 1965
[3:21:13] i am thankful the lord revealed the
[3:21:14] foretelling of the exposition book in
[3:21:17] joshua 18 and 19 to my brother simon a
[3:21:21] faithful bible teacher and missionary
[3:21:25] joshua 18 verses 1 through 10 finds the
[3:21:28] promised land subdued before israel and
[3:21:30] joshua still needs seven tribes to
[3:21:32] possess their land inheritance he sends
[3:21:35] out men into the land to explore and
[3:21:38] bring back its descriptions to joshua so
[3:21:41] he can divide the land the men come back
[3:21:43] with a book describing the land cities
[3:21:46] and dividing them up into seven parts
[3:21:48] joshua cast lots before the lord and
[3:21:51] assigns the seven land plots to the
[3:21:53] seven tribes this assignment had to take
[3:21:56] place before the prophet joshua's death
[3:21:59] two applications are apparent
[3:22:02] the first is jesus as joshua placing his
[3:22:05] four known overcomers in the church ages
[3:22:07] of his choosing
[3:22:09] the seven part book symbolizes jesus's
[3:22:11] letters to the seven gentile cities in
[3:22:14] revelation chapters two and three you
[3:22:16] can rejoice that jesus placed you in the
[3:22:19] seventh age laodicea as you can
[3:22:21] zealously repent and execute hot fervent
[3:22:24] works for his holy name
[3:22:27] a second application is brother branham
[3:22:29] as joshua the seven part book represents
[3:22:32] his seven sermons on the seven church
[3:22:34] ages preached in december 1960 having
[3:22:38] received the revelation of the seven
[3:22:39] cities as seven church ages branham
[3:22:42] could place the believers of church
[3:22:43] history in their matching respective
[3:22:45] ages and write his exposition
[3:22:48] their historical placement had to come
[3:22:50] while the prophet was yet alive as his
[3:22:53] book was published just a few weeks
[3:22:54] before he went home to be with the lord
[3:22:59] the rewards for receiving the revelation
[3:23:01] of the seven stars and seven
[3:23:03] candlesticks
[3:23:05] you will gain at least three rewards if
[3:23:07] you receive this chapter's revelations
[3:23:09] first you will understand church history
[3:23:11] correctly for example when historians
[3:23:14] magnify constantine and paint him as a
[3:23:17] righteous christian you will know that
[3:23:19] is not the case because his corrupt
[3:23:21] fruits murder pride etc proved he was a
[3:23:25] corrupt tree
[3:23:26] also god's plan to permit the true
[3:23:28] church to lose some of its revelation as
[3:23:31] it descended into the dark ages becomes
[3:23:33] clear just as god let jesus enter the
[3:23:36] darkness of death
[3:23:37] but god's resurrection power brought
[3:23:39] jesus out of darkness and into the light
[3:23:42] just as he was going to restore the
[3:23:44] church through sardis reformation
[3:23:46] philadelphia's open door and laodicea's
[3:23:49] restitution
[3:23:51] second you will finally understand the
[3:23:54] book of revelation and thereby overcome
[3:23:56] the false vine of our age
[3:23:58] its symbols timing and themes will last
[3:24:01] make sense
[3:24:02] the same symbols john uses match those
[3:24:05] of ezekiel jeremiah zechariah and the
[3:24:08] rest of the prophets you will see
[3:24:09] jesus's separations between the times of
[3:24:12] the gentiles and his return to the 144
[3:24:15] thousand jews most importantly you will
[3:24:18] see your responsibility as an overcomer
[3:24:20] and the unsearchable rewards awaiting
[3:24:22] you in the millennium and new jerusalem
[3:24:26] third the keystone of the entire bible
[3:24:29] god and his ways are unchanging unlocks
[3:24:32] the entire book of scripture you
[3:24:34] identify the true and false vines from
[3:24:36] genesis to revelation you see jesus
[3:24:39] christ in every scripture god's burning
[3:24:41] stars his prophets and preachers
[3:24:44] illuminate every age and generation from
[3:24:46] adam to today
[3:24:48] jesus of the seven church ages is the
[3:24:50] god of every age and his marvelous grace
[3:24:52] and power extend to each
[3:24:57] the consequences for rejecting the
[3:24:59] revelation of the seven stars and seven
[3:25:01] candlesticks
[3:25:03] there are at least two consequences for
[3:25:05] rejecting these revelations
[3:25:07] first rejecting jesus stars or seven
[3:25:10] church age messengers is refusing
[3:25:12] jesus's hand-picked lightbearers
[3:25:15] john 13 verse 20 says verily verily i
[3:25:18] say unto you he that receiveth
[3:25:19] whomsoever i send receiveth me
[3:25:22] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[3:25:24] that sent me
[3:25:26] turning down jesus stars is essentially
[3:25:28] turning down christ the light of the
[3:25:30] world
[3:25:31] jesus himself was shining through those
[3:25:34] seven
[3:25:34] stars
[3:25:36] no doubt paul was not perfect as he
[3:25:38] committed sins he hated martin luther
[3:25:41] made mistakes that caused many people
[3:25:42] much pain
[3:25:44] william branham's memory was imperfect
[3:25:46] but remember all of god's servants
[3:25:48] needed his grace abraham lied numerous
[3:25:51] times and even laughed in unbelief at
[3:25:53] god's promise
[3:25:54] moses killed a man and magnified himself
[3:25:57] rather than god which kept him out of
[3:25:59] canaan david had uriah killed after
[3:26:01] selfishly committing adultery with his
[3:26:03] wife
[3:26:04] jonah ran from god's presence and was
[3:26:06] angered that he did not destroy nineveh
[3:26:09] despite each servant's weakness they
[3:26:11] were later made strong by god's power
[3:26:13] his divine patience forgave his stars so
[3:26:16] they could again shine his light
[3:26:19] jesus says all that is left for
[3:26:21] rejecting him and his stars is judgment
[3:26:24] according to john 12 verses 47 and 48
[3:26:27] and if any man hear my words and believe
[3:26:29] not i judge him not for i came not to
[3:26:32] judge the world but to save the world he
[3:26:35] that rejecteth me and receiveth not my
[3:26:37] words hath one that judgeth him the word
[3:26:40] that i have spoken the same shall judge
[3:26:42] him in the last day may god be merciful
[3:26:45] to those who reject his stars
[3:26:48] the second consequence builds upon the
[3:26:50] first for rejecting the bright stars in
[3:26:53] jesus hand makes it easier to reject oil
[3:26:56] light from the candlesticks
[3:26:58] if you miss god's messenger in an age
[3:27:00] you will miss his plans for that period
[3:27:03] for example rejecting john wesley's
[3:27:05] ministry leads one to revile the vast
[3:27:08] brotherly love inspired open door
[3:27:10] missionary efforts of the 18th and 19th
[3:27:13] centuries currently rejecting branham's
[3:27:16] bible message redirects one out of
[3:27:18] jesus's light for these tumultuous times
[3:27:21] in which we live
[3:27:22] following branham's bible revelations is
[3:27:24] truly following jesus as john 8 verse 12
[3:27:28] reads then spake jesus again unto them
[3:27:30] saying i am the light of the world he
[3:27:32] that followeth me shall not walk in
[3:27:34] darkness but shall have the light of
[3:27:36] life
[3:27:38] rejecting branham's bible message today
[3:27:41] is refusing to walk in the holy light of
[3:27:43] the seven golden candlesticks
[3:27:45] remember jesus is standing there in the
[3:27:48] midst of the candlesticks according to
[3:27:49] revelation 1 verses 12 and 13.
[3:27:52] jesus is inviting one and all to come to
[3:27:55] the truth of this age he will give mercy
[3:27:57] to those who walk in the light but those
[3:28:00] outside are liars and filthy
[3:28:02] first john 1 verse 6 and 7 declares if
[3:28:05] we say that we have fellowship with him
[3:28:07] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[3:28:10] the truth but if we walk in the light as
[3:28:12] he is in the light we have fellowship
[3:28:15] one with another and the blood of jesus
[3:28:17] christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[3:28:22] conclusion
[3:28:24] identifying jesus's seven stars and the
[3:28:27] light of each candlestick for each age
[3:28:30] helps you see god's past current and
[3:28:32] future actions
[3:28:34] he is empowering his bride to overcome
[3:28:36] the darkness of jezebel and her
[3:28:37] daughters
[3:28:39] jesus seven stars shine his truth in the
[3:28:42] midst of the darkness of iniquity
[3:28:44] christ's lights are witnesses and
[3:28:46] standards by his grace you have seen his
[3:28:48] light just in time as we are at the end
[3:28:51] of the times of the gentiles
[3:28:54] now let jesus's candlestick light
[3:28:57] reflect upon your life
[3:28:58] imitate the light of the seven stars
[3:29:01] follow the examples of the saints from
[3:29:03] ephesus to laodicea it is time to shine
[3:29:06] fulfill isaiah 60 verses 1 and 2 arise
[3:29:10] shine for thy light has come and the
[3:29:13] glory of the lord has risen upon thee
[3:29:15] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[3:29:17] earth and gross darkness the people but
[3:29:20] the lord shall rise upon thee and his
[3:29:22] glory shall be seen upon thee hallelujah
[3:29:27] action steps step one
[3:29:30] since it is most urgent for you to walk
[3:29:32] in the light of your age laodicea's call
[3:29:34] for zealous repentance
