TRANSCRIPT
========================================
then Peter here says first seven things Faith virtue see come up knowledge temper patience godl brotherly love and brotherly kindness and then the love of God a holy ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle amen amen called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place amen when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you might speak with tongues you might impersonate any gift that God's Got You might do that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith right but when these virtues grow in and you added that to that then you are a living Monument you are a living moving aisle add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge to your knowledge Temperance to your Temperance patience to your patience godliness to your godl brotherly love to your brotherly love the Holy Spirit and Christ will come because just beneath him the holy spirit is the spirit of Jesus Christ into the church to manifest those virtues bless you brother Neville so happy to be back in the church tonight just a teeny bit horse have a long message this morning and I'm sure happy it was here old and enjoyed it myself I'm bringing it and I hope you enjoy hearing amen don't forget now always remember this that these are the things that build the servant of christall Faith first than virtue and now remember the Holy Spirit cannot kep the building of God until these things are operating by the am no matter what you do those are the things that builds the body of Christ amen those things now don't forget that that this year is first is your faith virtue knowledge and so forth is to be added to it until the complete statue of Christ is made manifest then the Holy Spirit comes up on it and seals it as one body amen these things must be therefore Jesus said by their fruit they are known see fruit you could not bear fruit without these things to Bear it in you and then when all this takes the place of worldliness and and ungodliness and so forth then all unbelief is cast out and all the things of the world is passed away then there's nothing but a new creature in Christ and then a Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of your Redemption sealed into the kingdom of God I don't forget that keep that in mind now takes these things first yes then the cealing is the Holy Spirit the cap that seals us into the body and now as in the individuals these virtues and things are knowledge and tempers is added to our faith then when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit cement it together amen hall hallelujah there's the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's why it's so short today you remember the pyramid message it's the Capstone what did he do the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and seal it when we added to our faith righteousness and godliness and faith and so forth we kept adding to it till we got SA things and the seventh one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual and caps him and seals him with the Holy Spirit then if that be so he's got seven Church ages that he's had seven Mysteries that's been sounded away and they' fought for to bring back and now the cstone comes the cap off the church add to your faith virture and so forth all this in First Peter the first uh second Peter be the first chapter for it's all added to your Faith all these things godliness and Purity and Holiness and everything and then you're sealed by the Holy Ghost but it's just like somebody they people claim to have this when they haven't because they've been falsely taught the Methodist get a funny feeling used to it shake a little bit or or dance in the spirit the Pentecostal speak with tongues or or do something emotional I believe those things certainly but those things without these others is no good hey
