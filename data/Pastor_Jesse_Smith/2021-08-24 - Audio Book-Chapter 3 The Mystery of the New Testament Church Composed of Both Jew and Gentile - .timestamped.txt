[0:01] chapter 3 the mystery of the new
[0:03] testament church
[0:05] composed of both jew and gentile
[0:08] chapter 3 includes footnotes numbers
[0:13] 369-461
[0:14] mystery number 3 of 12
[0:18] how that by revelation he made known
[0:20] unto me the mystery
[0:21] as i wrote a four in few words whereby
[0:25] when ye read you may understand my
[0:27] knowledge in the mystery of christ
[0:29] which in other ages was not made known
[0:31] unto the sons of men
[0:33] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[0:35] apostles and
[0:36] prophets by the spirit that the gentiles
[0:39] should be fellow heirs
[0:41] and of the same body and partakers of
[0:43] his promise
[0:44] in christ by the gospel ephesians
[0:47] chapter 3 verses
[0:48] 3 through 6
[0:52] knowing israel's position through god's
[0:54] covenant promises
[0:56] is necessary so you can understand your
[0:58] own
[0:59] for example if you're born jewish either
[1:02] accept christ as your messiah
[1:04] or remain ever faithful to the mosaic
[1:06] covenant
[1:07] if you're a gentile god has offered you
[1:10] a part of the new covenant
[1:12] whichever background you come from jew
[1:14] or gentile
[1:15] the next mystery shows how god planned
[1:17] and produced
[1:18] one new testament church composed of
[1:21] both jew
[1:21] and gentile the confusion about jews and
[1:25] gentiles
[1:26] composing one church the confusion about
[1:29] jew and gentiles composing one church
[1:32] centers on whether or not god would
[1:34] allow a previously unholy
[1:36] sinful people the gentiles into his
[1:40] holy separated family as you read the
[1:43] old testament the lord makes it clear
[1:45] only israel is his people under the
[1:47] mosaic covenant
[1:49] deuteronomy 14 verse 2 states
[1:52] for thou art and holy people unto the
[1:54] lord thy god
[1:55] and the lord hath chosen thee to be a
[1:57] peculiar people
[1:58] unto himself above all the nations that
[2:01] are upon the earth
[2:03] again if israel only obeyed god's
[2:06] commands he would
[2:07] set thee on high above all nations of
[2:10] the earth
[2:11] and all these blessings shall come upon
[2:13] thee and overtake thee
[2:14] if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of
[2:16] the lord thy god
[2:19] would abraham's god raise up all other
[2:21] nations
[2:22] to the same honor and blessing as israel
[2:25] if so could jews and gentiles become one
[2:28] family and god
[2:29] entitled to the same benefits and
[2:31] inheritances
[2:34] the revelation of the mystery of one
[2:36] church composed of jew and gentile
[2:39] is that every born-again believer is
[2:41] part of god's family
[2:43] and entitled to all its rights benefits
[2:45] and future inheritances
[2:48] while this may not seem like a confusing
[2:50] issue to you
[2:51] it was a major issue during bible times
[2:54] this subject might not seem mysterious
[2:57] because
[2:57] you're likely living in the western
[2:59] civilization that's been established in
[3:01] judeo-christian culture
[3:03] for over 400 years the bulk of this
[3:06] chapter explores how god broke down the
[3:08] spiritual
[3:09] and physical walls that separated jews
[3:11] and gentiles
[3:12] through apostles paul and peter but a
[3:15] short section will address how
[3:17] westerners like myself and possibly you
[3:20] may be surprised or even confused how
[3:23] jews can be part of today's new
[3:24] testament church
[3:26] since we've been accustomed to gentiles
[3:28] only in the new covenant
[3:30] it can be difficult to imagine how a
[3:32] messianic jew might worship christ
[3:35] thankfully our gracious god offers
[3:37] liberties within the new covenant
[3:39] and values diversity within holiness
[3:44] biblical evidence for the revelation
[3:46] about jew and gentiles
[3:47] composing one church
[3:52] god hand-picked and separated israel to
[3:54] be holy unto himself
[3:56] exclusive of other nations thus forming
[3:59] the abrahamic
[4:00] covenant isaac was abraham's true seed
[4:02] of promise
[4:03] although abraham had seven other sons
[4:06] god further narrowed his choice on
[4:08] isaac's son jacob
[4:10] out of whom came the twelve tribes of
[4:12] israel although esau was his firstborn
[4:17] jacob's family went into egypt with 75
[4:19] people
[4:20] but came out with possibly a few million
[4:23] because the first count of israel's men
[4:25] was six hundred thousand according to
[4:28] exodus 12 verses
[4:29] 37 and 38 there were women children and
[4:32] a mixed multitude to add to this sum
[4:35] as promised god blessed the wombs of
[4:37] israeli women
[4:39] through fruitfulness and multiplication
[4:41] yet god had made provision
[4:43] for gentiles god's provision for gentile
[4:46] proselytes
[4:47] in the old testament although not
[4:51] specifically called to judaism
[4:53] gentiles called strangers or sojourners
[4:56] were often accepted as proselytes
[4:59] beginning with abraham's covenant in
[5:01] genesis 17 verse 12
[5:03] and verse 27 god prepared abraham
[5:06] and his descendants to accept proselytes
[5:09] the number of proselytes steadily
[5:11] increased until solomon
[5:13] 500 years after the egypt exodus gave a
[5:16] definite number of gentiles
[5:18] so journey with israel to be 153
[5:22] 600. male gentile converts
[5:25] were required to be circumcised in
[5:27] accordance with abraham's covenant
[5:29] proselytes enjoyed many privileges
[5:31] within mosaic law
[5:32] but males could never be priests whose
[5:35] offices were designed
[5:37] only for sons of levi all gentile
[5:40] proselytes kept moses's law
[5:42] including commands such as observing the
[5:45] sabbath
[5:46] keeping passover laws rejoicing on feast
[5:49] days
[5:50] ceremonial purifying from uncleanness
[5:53] through the red heifer's
[5:55] waters of separation god chose to use
[5:58] numerous gentiles in important
[6:00] and supernatural ways prominent gentile
[6:03] converts
[6:04] within judaism include rahab the gentile
[6:07] harlot of jericho
[6:09] the first recorded gentile proselyte
[6:12] joshua chapters two and six
[6:14] show she was spared from her city's
[6:16] destruction when she received and
[6:18] protected
[6:19] israel's two spies her record token
[6:22] signified her faith in israel's god
[6:25] rahab later married
[6:26] salman a prince of judah and
[6:28] great-grandfather of david
[6:30] putting her in the lineage of jesus
[6:32] christ
[6:34] ruth the moabitus a childless widow who
[6:37] chose to sojourn
[6:38] back to israel with her mother-in-law
[6:40] naomi after hearing israel had bread
[6:43] her godly virtue caught the attention of
[6:45] the wealthy
[6:46] bethlehemite named boaz who redeemed
[6:49] both she and naomi
[6:52] boaz was a son of solomon rahab's
[6:55] husband
[6:56] ruth and boaz wed and she bore obed the
[6:59] grandfather of david
[7:00] out of whose loins came christ
[7:03] uriah the hittite husband of bathsheba
[7:06] whom david slew in order to take his
[7:08] wife
[7:09] beforehand he was one of david's mighty
[7:11] men and chief officers
[7:14] his loyalty to israel the lord and his
[7:17] battles
[7:17] demonstrate extraordinary devotion to
[7:20] jehovah
[7:22] prophecy foretelling gentiles receiving
[7:25] god's new covenant
[7:28] building upon those gentile heroes at
[7:31] least four
[7:32] old testament prophets foretold god's
[7:34] will to unite the gentiles
[7:36] into his family through the new covenant
[7:40] god himself foretold his grace in
[7:42] genesis 12
[7:43] 3 saying in thee shall all families of
[7:46] the earth be blessed
[7:48] paul validates god's personal prophecy
[7:51] about the gentiles
[7:52] in galatians 3 verse 8 and the scripture
[7:56] foreseeing that god would justify the
[7:58] heathen through faith
[7:59] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[8:01] saying in thee shall all nations be
[8:04] blessed
[8:05] four human prophets that foretell god's
[8:07] grace to the gentiles are
[8:09] david isaiah hosea and jeremiah
[8:13] in the psalms david twice mentions all
[8:16] nations worshiping the lord
[8:18] psalm 22 verse 27 reads
[8:22] all the ends of the world shall remember
[8:23] and turn unto the lord
[8:25] and all the kindreds of the nations
[8:27] shall worship before thee
[8:29] he adds all nations whom thou has made
[8:32] shall come and worship before thee
[8:34] o lord and shall glorify thy name
[8:39] isaiah provides at least five references
[8:41] to the gentiles
[8:43] in chapter 9 verse 2 he writes the
[8:45] people that walked in darkness have seen
[8:47] a great light
[8:48] they that dwell in the land of the
[8:50] shadow of death upon them
[8:52] hath the light shined matthew 4
[8:55] verses 13-16 explains this was prophecy
[8:59] fulfilled in jesus ministry to the
[9:01] gentiles
[9:03] isaiah 11 verse 10 says and
[9:06] in that day there shall be a root of
[9:08] jesse which shall stand for an end sign
[9:11] of the people
[9:12] to it shall the gentiles seek and his
[9:14] rest shall be glorious
[9:16] jesus is undoubtedly the root of jesse
[9:20] as he brought the soul rest of the
[9:21] baptism of the holy ghost
[9:23] according to both jesus and paul
[9:26] a third reference is isaiah 42 verses
[9:30] 1 through 9 and verse 1 reads behold my
[9:33] servant
[9:34] whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul
[9:38] delighteth
[9:39] i have put my spirit upon him he shall
[9:41] bring forth
[9:42] judgment to the gentiles matthew 12
[9:45] verses
[9:46] 14 through 21 proves this was also
[9:48] fulfilled in jesus's earthly ministry
[9:52] isaiah 49 verse 6 prophesied that in
[9:55] addition to restoring the tribes of
[9:57] israel
[9:58] the messiah would shine light for the
[10:00] gentiles
[10:01] paul and barnabas quote isaiah saying
[10:03] for so hath the lord commanded us
[10:06] saying i have set thee to be a light of
[10:08] the gentiles
[10:09] that thou should us be for salvation
[10:11] unto the ends of the earth
[10:14] finally isaiah 60 verse 3 tells us that
[10:17] the gentiles shall come to thy light and
[10:20] kings to the brightness of thy rising
[10:24] acts 26 verse 23 reiterates that
[10:27] christ's resurrection would
[10:28] show light unto the people and to the
[10:31] gentiles
[10:33] hosea 2 verse 23 provides a well-known
[10:36] gentile prophecy
[10:38] and i will say to them which were not my
[10:40] people thou art my people
[10:42] and they shall say thou art my god paul
[10:45] is inspired by the holy spirit
[10:47] to cite hosea in romans 9 verses 24
[10:51] through 26
[10:53] as proof of god offering his spirit to
[10:55] the gentiles
[10:57] even us whom he hath called not of the
[11:00] jews only
[11:01] but also of the gentiles as he saith
[11:04] also in hosea
[11:05] i will call them my people which were
[11:08] not my people
[11:09] and her beloved which was not beloved
[11:13] and it shall come to pass that in the
[11:14] place where it was said unto them
[11:16] ye are not my people there shall they be
[11:19] called the children
[11:20] of the living god
[11:23] jeremiah also prophesies of the gentiles
[11:26] coming to know the true god in chapter
[11:28] 16 verses
[11:29] 19 through 21 o lord my strength and my
[11:34] fortress
[11:34] and my refuge in the day of affliction
[11:37] the gentiles shall come
[11:38] unto thee from the ends of the earth and
[11:40] shall say
[11:42] surely our fathers have inherited lies
[11:44] vanity
[11:45] and things wherein there is no prophet
[11:48] shall a man make gods unto himself
[11:50] and there are no gods therefore behold
[11:53] i will this once cause them to know i
[11:56] will cause them to know mine hand
[11:58] and my might and they shall know that my
[12:00] name is
[12:01] the lord
[12:06] jesus first offers the gospel to the
[12:08] jews
[12:10] as god's covenant people israel was
[12:13] obligated to have the first chance to
[12:15] receive the new covenant
[12:16] jesus sent his disciples only to the
[12:19] jews
[12:20] in matthew 10 verses 5 through 7.
[12:23] 12 jesus sent forth and commanded them
[12:26] saying
[12:27] go not into the way of the gentiles and
[12:29] into any city of the samaritans
[12:31] enter ye not but go rather to the lost
[12:34] sheep of the house of israel
[12:36] and as you go preach saying the kingdom
[12:38] of heaven
[12:39] is at hand jesus recognized the gentiles
[12:44] defiled condition
[12:45] in matthew 15 verses 22 through 24
[12:49] calling them dogs while calling israel
[12:52] children
[12:53] later though after israel steadfastly
[12:55] opposed his ministry
[12:57] jesus the one shepherd called the
[12:59] gentiles his
[13:00] other sheep he must bring into his one
[13:03] fold
[13:03] in john 10 16.
[13:07] jesus's parable of the wicked husbandman
[13:10] in matthew 21 verses 33-46
[13:14] tells the same story god first offers
[13:16] his kingdom to israel
[13:18] the husbandman in the parable but they
[13:20] kill the son of the husbandman
[13:22] representing christ jesus interprets
[13:25] this parable for the jews in their ears
[13:27] saying
[13:28] therefore i say unto you the kingdom of
[13:30] god shall be taken
[13:31] from you and given to a nation bringing
[13:34] forth the fruits thereof
[13:37] recall isaiah 60 verse 3 which says the
[13:40] gentiles shall come to thy light
[13:43] the light of jesus's gospel came to the
[13:45] jews first
[13:47] acts 3 verses 25 and 26
[13:50] records peter telling jews god sent his
[13:52] son jesus
[13:54] unto you first to bless them with
[13:56] forgiveness of sins
[13:58] paul taught the power of god through
[13:59] christ was preached first to the jew
[14:02] in romans 1 verse 16. the gospel was
[14:05] meant to be their light
[14:07] as the prophets foretold but once
[14:09] rejected and blasphemed
[14:11] the light went to the gentiles
[14:15] the book of acts and peter's keys to the
[14:17] kingdom
[14:19] although most jews rejected jesus and
[14:21] supported his crucifixion
[14:23] a small remnant of believers trusted in
[14:25] him and knew he was alive and raised
[14:28] from the dead
[14:29] a portion of this group waited in
[14:31] jerusalem for 10 days
[14:32] and on the day of pentecost received the
[14:34] new covenant the baptism of the holy
[14:37] ghost
[14:37] according to acts chapters 1 and 2.
[14:40] fittingly
[14:41] peter was jesus's spokesman on that day
[14:45] as three thousand souls were added to
[14:47] the faith
[14:48] jesus previously gave peter the keys to
[14:50] the kingdom in matthew 16 verses 18 to
[14:53] 19
[14:54] and at pentecost he used them first
[14:57] jesus says the kingdom of god is the
[14:59] baptism of the holy ghost
[15:00] within the believer in luke 17 verse 21
[15:05] behold the kingdom of god is within you
[15:08] both john the baptist
[15:09] and christ call the inward filling of
[15:11] the holy ghost a baptism
[15:13] in matthew 3 verse 11 and acts 1
[15:16] verse 5 respectively
[15:20] reading further in the book of acts the
[15:22] gospel begins spreading to non-jews
[15:25] beginning with the samaritans in acts 8
[15:28] verses 1 through 40.
[15:30] surprisingly it was the persecution of
[15:32] saul
[15:33] later paul which brought about the
[15:35] spread of christianity to the gentiles
[15:38] before converting to christianity saul
[15:40] indirectly
[15:41] helped spread it to the very people
[15:43] group that christ would later send him
[15:46] directly to
[15:47] paul helped the gentiles receive jesus's
[15:50] gospel both before he was converted
[15:52] and after his conversion
[15:56] acts 8 shows philip the jewish
[15:58] evangelist
[15:59] preaching with miraculous signs and
[16:01] wonders to the samaritans
[16:03] half jews despised by full-blooded jews
[16:06] causing many to repent of their sins and
[16:08] accept water baptism
[16:10] philip then calls for peter and john to
[16:12] come pray and lay hands on them to
[16:15] receive
[16:16] the baptism of the holy ghost herein is
[16:19] the second time peter uses the keys to
[16:20] the kingdom for when he and john pray
[16:23] for the samaritans
[16:24] they are born again for as yet he was
[16:27] found upon none of them
[16:28] only they were baptized in the name of
[16:30] the lord jesus
[16:32] then laid they their hands on them and
[16:34] they received the holy ghost
[16:39] peter used the keys to the kingdom a
[16:41] third time to open the door of salvation
[16:43] to gentiles in acts chapter 10
[16:46] following a supernatural vision in which
[16:48] god chose peter his soon
[16:50] intention to save the unclean gentiles
[16:52] the apostle goes with three men to the
[16:54] house of cornelius
[16:56] a roman centurion corneos was already a
[16:59] devoted follower of christ
[17:01] having a disciplined life of prayer
[17:04] fasting and almsgiving
[17:05] yet he hadn't been baptized yet peter's
[17:08] short sermon about god's divine plan
[17:11] to use jesus death and resurrection as a
[17:14] means to save and forgive
[17:16] whosoever believeth causes the holy
[17:18] ghost to fall
[17:19] on all them which heard the word this is
[17:22] amazing news
[17:23] the gentiles are now receiving god's
[17:25] blessings
[17:26] equal to the jews
[17:29] upon hearing this news the jewish
[17:31] christians in judea were upset
[17:34] and contended with peter when he
[17:35] returned to their company
[17:37] they accused peter of defiling himself
[17:39] by eating with uncircumcised men
[17:42] peter recounts the events in corneos's
[17:44] house to the apostles and brethren
[17:46] declaring that the holy ghost fell in
[17:48] corneos's house
[17:50] the same as it did on the day of
[17:51] pentecost according to jesus promise
[17:54] to baptize believers with the holy ghost
[17:58] humbled by god's spirit being poured out
[18:00] upon the gentiles as a gift
[18:02] peter says what was i that i could
[18:05] withstand god
[18:06] peter's story satisfies the apostles and
[18:09] acts 11 verse 18
[18:11] reads when they heard these things they
[18:13] held their peace
[18:14] and glorified god saying then hath god
[18:18] also to the gentiles granted repentance
[18:20] unto life
[18:23] cornelius house then is a great turning
[18:26] point for the new covenant because god
[18:28] now shares his holy spirit gift with
[18:30] gentiles
[18:31] even though the men had not kept the
[18:33] circumcision token
[18:34] of abraham's covenant
[18:38] this turning point is a new spiritual
[18:39] time and season
[18:41] jesus labels the times of the gentiles
[18:44] in luke 21
[18:45] 24 and paul tells you it lasts for only
[18:49] a limited time
[18:50] romans 11 verse 25 declares the jews are
[18:53] blinded to christ
[18:55] until the fullness of the gentiles
[18:57] become in
[19:00] paul's gentile dispensation and peter's
[19:03] apostleship to jews you learn in chapter
[19:06] 2 that the apostle paul was given a
[19:08] dispensation or stewardship
[19:11] to preach christ's gospel to the
[19:12] gentiles according to first corinthians
[19:14] 9
[19:15] 17 ephesians 3 verse 2 and colossians 1
[19:19] verse 25.
[19:20] herein we recognize paul's divine
[19:22] assignment to the gentiles
[19:25] first corinthians 9 17 says this
[19:27] sensation was committed
[19:29] or entrusted to paul for if i do this
[19:32] thing willingly
[19:33] i have a reward but if against my will a
[19:35] dispensation of the gospel
[19:37] is committed unto me ephesians 3
[19:41] verses 1 and 2 tells you the gentile
[19:43] dispensation was given to him by god
[19:46] for this cause i paul the prisoner of
[19:49] jesus christ for you gentiles
[19:51] if ye have heard of the dispensation of
[19:54] the grace of god
[19:55] which has given me to you word this
[19:58] verse proves paul's dispensation
[20:00] was the time he would oversee the
[20:02] ministry of grace
[20:03] in a stewardship given solely to him by
[20:06] jesus
[20:08] colossians 1 verse 25 explains his
[20:11] dispensation
[20:12] is a fulfillment of god's word or
[20:14] prophecy
[20:15] whereof i am made a minister according
[20:18] to the dispensation of god which is
[20:20] given to me for you
[20:21] to fulfill the word of god god
[20:24] specifically chose paul to take the
[20:26] gospel to gentiles
[20:28] while choosing peter to take it to the
[20:30] jews
[20:31] these were not two gospels but one for
[20:34] there is one faith
[20:36] scripture says both men had an
[20:38] apostleship to their respective group
[20:40] paul was god's apostles of the gentiles
[20:42] and peter was the apostle to the jews
[20:45] galatians 2 verses 7 through 9 reads
[20:48] but contrary-wise when they saw that the
[20:51] gospel of the uncircumcision
[20:53] was committed unto me as the gospel of
[20:56] the circumcision
[20:57] was unto peter for he that wrought
[20:59] effectually in peter
[21:01] to the apostleship of the circumcision
[21:04] the same was
[21:04] mighty in me toward the gentiles and
[21:07] when james
[21:08] cephas and john who seem to be pillars
[21:12] perceive the grace that was given unto
[21:14] me they gave to me and barnabas
[21:17] the right hands of fellowship that we
[21:19] should go unto the heathen
[21:20] and they unto the circumcision
[21:23] paul and peter are significant choices
[21:26] as messengers of god's new covenant
[21:28] for both men had experienced jesus's
[21:31] life-changing power
[21:32] paul had previously dragged christians
[21:34] to jail denying christ
[21:36] and urging them to blaspheme jesus peter
[21:40] had boasted of his devotion to jesus
[21:42] before denying him with cursing three
[21:44] times on the night of jesus's arrest
[21:47] paul and peter's friends families and
[21:50] acquaintances
[21:51] witness their spiritual transformation
[21:53] from failures
[21:54] to bold followers of jesus god's
[21:57] selection
[21:58] of paul as the herald of this gentile
[22:00] dispensation
[22:01] leaves no doubt to its authenticity
[22:04] because paul was originally
[22:06] a hebrew of hebrews in other words paul
[22:08] or saul
[22:09] was a staunch zealous mosaic covenant
[22:12] jew
[22:13] who likely despised gentiles for their
[22:15] uncleanness
[22:17] in our minds he would seem to be an
[22:18] unlikely choice to open the door of
[22:20] fellowship to the gentiles
[22:23] previous to christ humbling him through
[22:25] his conversion paul aggressively opposed
[22:27] any gentile
[22:28] defiling his hebrew synagogue and
[22:30] lifestyle
[22:32] saul kept moses's law along with the
[22:34] man-made traditions of the pharisees
[22:36] but once knowing christ's love paul
[22:39] counted all his efforts in man-made
[22:41] pharisee traditions as dung that he
[22:44] might
[22:44] win christ paul knew what it meant to
[22:47] violently oppose god's plans
[22:49] but later received grace from jesus
[22:51] christ
[22:52] with this experience he could freely
[22:54] preach grace to the gentiles
[22:56] who also once opposed god's holiness
[23:01] the moment paul turned to the gentiles
[23:04] acts 13 verses 14 through 52
[23:08] captures the moment paul turned his
[23:10] ministry to the gentiles
[23:12] while on his first missionary journey
[23:13] with barnabas in antioch
[23:15] jewish leaders in a synagogue offer an
[23:18] opportunity for paul and barnabas
[23:20] to speak on the sabbath god's word is so
[23:22] true
[23:23] his gifts make room for themselves if
[23:26] god sends you to speak for him
[23:27] he will provide opportunities and
[23:29] listeners
[23:31] paul stands and preaches israel's
[23:33] history beginning with the exodus from
[23:35] egypt
[23:36] then going through joshua's conquest of
[23:38] canaan the judges
[23:40] then kings building to john the
[23:42] baptist's words about the one coming
[23:44] after him
[23:45] jesus christ the apostle then shows
[23:48] forgiveness
[23:48] through jesus death and resurrection
[23:51] followed by a warning to believe it
[23:53] a week later nearly the whole city comes
[23:55] to hear paul preach
[23:57] but certain jews were filled with envy
[23:59] after seeing other jews and gentiles
[24:01] believing in christ the angry jews
[24:04] contradict and blaspheme palm barnabas
[24:07] causing the apostles to announce god's
[24:09] official turning
[24:10] from the jews to the gentiles
[24:14] then paul and barnabas waxed bold and
[24:16] said it was necessary
[24:18] that the word of god should first have
[24:19] been spoken to you
[24:21] but seeing you put it from you and judge
[24:23] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[24:26] lo we turn to the gentiles for so hath
[24:28] the lord commanded us saying
[24:30] i have set thee to be a light of the
[24:32] gentiles that thou shouldst be for
[24:34] salvation unto the ends of the earth
[24:36] and when the gentiles heard this they
[24:38] were glad and glorified the word of the
[24:40] lord
[24:41] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[24:43] life believed
[24:45] this particular event gives evidence to
[24:47] blinded jews being responsible for their
[24:49] blindness
[24:51] paul says jews judge themselves unworthy
[24:53] of everlasting life
[24:56] paul says jews judge themselves unworthy
[24:59] of everlasting
[25:00] life god did not forcefully blind israel
[25:02] outside
[25:03] of their freemore agency
[25:07] rather israel wanted to disbelieve in
[25:09] blaspheme christ
[25:11] by foreknowledge god planned for this
[25:13] moment in advance
[25:14] and prepared paul and barnabas to herald
[25:17] his loving grace
[25:18] to the spiritually hungry gentiles
[25:21] after many more missionary travels paul
[25:23] returned to antioch
[25:25] and shared how god had opened the door
[25:27] of faith to the gentiles
[25:28] in acts 14 verse 27 and when they were
[25:31] come
[25:32] and had gathered the church together
[25:34] they rehearsed all that god had done
[25:36] with them
[25:36] and how he had opened the door of faith
[25:38] unto the gentiles
[25:40] since israel would not return to him in
[25:42] obedience he would leave her
[25:44] and turn to the gentiles
[25:48] paul's gospel as christ's judgment
[25:50] standard
[25:52] to say paul's teachings are important
[25:54] would be a gross
[25:55] understatement galatians 1 verses 6
[25:58] through 12 and romans 2 verse 16 boldly
[26:01] declare
[26:02] curses upon anyone who changes paul's
[26:05] teachings
[26:05] because they will be christ's judgment
[26:07] standard on judgment day
[26:10] paul calls any variation to his
[26:12] teachings perversions
[26:14] in galatians 1 verses 6 and 7.
[26:17] then in verses 8 through 9 he gives a
[26:19] double warning of a curse
[26:21] to those who do change his original
[26:23] gospel message
[26:25] but though we or an angel from heaven
[26:27] preach any other gospel unto you
[26:30] than that which we have preached unto
[26:31] you let him be accursed
[26:34] as we said before so say i now again if
[26:37] any man preach
[26:38] any other gospel unto you then that ye
[26:40] have received
[26:41] let him be accursed you might wonder
[26:44] why such strong words verses 10
[26:47] through 13 state the reason paul
[26:50] received his initial gospel teachings
[26:52] and thereby authority directly from
[26:54] jesus christ himself
[26:56] and not from himself or other men anyone
[26:59] changing
[27:00] paul's teachings were actually changing
[27:02] christ's teachings
[27:04] which would warrant a curse as proverbs
[27:06] 30 verses 5 and 6
[27:08] and revelation chapter 22 verses 18 and
[27:11] 19
[27:12] support notice verse 8 again how paul
[27:15] says
[27:15] he and his fellow preachers we as well
[27:19] as
[27:19] angels cannot change one word christ
[27:21] taught him
[27:23] it seems likely from galatians 1 verse
[27:25] 17
[27:26] paul received his revelations from
[27:28] christ in the wilderness of arabia
[27:31] jesus didn't send paul to a seminary
[27:33] although god used those in the past
[27:36] nor did jesus send paul to learn from
[27:37] peter no
[27:39] christ had a special ministry for paul
[27:41] and needed to teach him personally
[27:43] face to face imagine paul communing with
[27:46] the same
[27:47] light that caused his conversion on the
[27:49] road to damascus
[27:51] but now he's not persecuting jesus the
[27:53] light
[27:54] but letting the light teach him the
[27:56] divine revelation of the mystery of god
[27:59] bible readers may be reminded of another
[28:01] prophet moses
[28:02] communing with the eternal light in the
[28:04] wilderness in order to receive the
[28:06] revelation of the ten commandments
[28:08] a modern example of god meeting a
[28:10] prophet in the wilderness
[28:11] is detailed in chapter 13.
[28:15] romans 2 verse 16 says god will judge
[28:17] the secrets of men by paul's gospel
[28:20] in the day when god shall judge the
[28:22] secrets of men by jesus christ
[28:24] according to my gospel of course
[28:28] paul is not claiming his teachings came
[28:30] from his own mind when he writes
[28:31] my gospel but rather from his
[28:33] dispensation or stewardship
[28:35] from jesus christ as galatians 1 verse
[28:38] 12
[28:39] and ephesians 3 verse 2 state understand
[28:42] not every word paul
[28:44] uttered from his lips nor wrote with his
[28:46] pen
[28:47] was from jesus as thus saith the lord
[28:50] satan forever labors to deceive men
[28:52] into worshiping other men as paul
[28:54] experienced and recorded
[28:56] in first corinthians 1 verses 12-15
[29:00] the apostle said he was thankful he
[29:02] baptized none of the corinthians
[29:04] for they might have said they were
[29:05] baptized by paul in paul's name
[29:08] paul's own words admit he was not
[29:10] perfect nor infallible
[29:12] only his teachings from jesus carried
[29:14] authority
[29:15] the apostle writes in romans 3 verse 4
[29:19] and verses 13 and 14 that all men lie
[29:22] and let deceit and bitter words spew
[29:24] from their mouths
[29:26] paul also said he sinned and did things
[29:28] he hated in romans 7
[29:30] verses 15-19 although paul was not
[29:33] infallible
[29:34] his revealed gospel from jesus christ
[29:37] was
[29:39] paul's revelation from jesus was god's
[29:41] divine will for mankind
[29:43] and all will be judged by paul's
[29:45] epistles this means paul's inspired
[29:48] words about doctrine
[29:49] and christian living need resounded
[29:51] today since much of christendom
[29:54] rejects jesus's revelation the following
[29:57] divine gospel truths
[29:58] will either witness for or against
[30:01] mankind on judgment day
[30:02] and should not be added to nor deleted
[30:05] from pulpits
[30:06] water baptism is full immersion in water
[30:09] not sprinkling
[30:10] and should be administered in the
[30:11] literal name of the lord jesus christ
[30:14] no person in scripture was baptized in
[30:16] the titles of father
[30:17] son and holy ghost paul baptized
[30:20] ephesians in the literal name of the
[30:22] lord jesus
[30:23] in acts 19 verse 5. the godhead
[30:26] recognized as
[30:27] a genuine divine mystery by paul is
[30:29] never referred to as three persons
[30:32] instead paul says jesus is the image of
[30:34] the invisible god
[30:36] the hebrews writer likely paul says
[30:39] jesus is the image of god's one person
[30:41] in hebrews 1 verse 3. paul taught all
[30:44] churches
[30:45] appropriate hair length men have short
[30:48] cut hair
[30:48] while women have long uncut hair
[30:51] according to first corinthians 4
[30:53] verse 17 and first corinthians 11
[30:56] verses 1 through 16.
[30:59] modest clothing was commanded to
[31:01] christian women by paul
[31:03] in 1st timothy 2 verse 9. i wrote my
[31:05] first book on this subject
[31:07] and i'll provide you a free copy if you
[31:09] cannot afford one
[31:11] women preachers were forbidden by paul
[31:13] who said
[31:15] men only can teach other men in 1st
[31:17] timothy 2 verse 12
[31:19] and 1st corinthians 14 verses 34 and 35
[31:24] paul and other apostles never asked
[31:26] anyone to invite jesus
[31:27] into their hearts for salvation but
[31:30] rather preach repentance
[31:32] in anticipation for a later infilling of
[31:35] the holy ghost baptism
[31:38] paul's extensive teaching on the
[31:40] revelation of one church
[31:43] apostle paul writes extensively on this
[31:45] revelation of jews and gentiles
[31:47] composing one church he labels this
[31:49] subject as a mystery and fittingly
[31:51] provides
[31:52] sufficient evidence proving god accepts
[31:55] both jew and gentile
[31:56] into christ's body the church the
[31:59] following scriptures detail the one
[32:00] church
[32:01] romans 16 verses 25 and 26
[32:05] first corinthians 12 verse 13 galatians
[32:08] 3
[32:09] verses 6 through 29 ephesians 2
[32:13] verses 11 through 22 ephesians 3
[32:16] verses 1 to 21 and colossians 1 verse 27
[32:21] colossians 3 verse 11 and colossians 4
[32:25] verse 3. it's essential to read the
[32:28] entire book of romans
[32:29] as chapters 1 through 5 show the
[32:31] universal need
[32:32] for jews and gentiles to receive the
[32:34] righteousness of jesus christ
[32:36] he has graciously provided then chapters
[32:40] 6 through 8 teach how the new man
[32:42] or spirit-filled believer overcomes sin
[32:45] understands the mosaic covenant and
[32:47] walks in the holy spirit
[32:49] israel's downfall and unbelief the
[32:52] mystery of her blindness
[32:53] and her prophesied return to christ are
[32:56] taught in chapters
[32:57] 9 through 11. the one faith or
[32:59] guidelines for christian living
[33:01] are expressed in chapters 12 through 16.
[33:06] in romans 16 verses 25-27
[33:09] paul ends his monumental teaching letter
[33:12] by telling believers
[33:13] god is going to establish and strengthen
[33:15] them according to the preaching of the
[33:17] revelation of the mystery
[33:19] of his gospel paul's revelation is that
[33:22] god wants all gentiles
[33:24] to obey the one faith this revelation
[33:26] was kept secret since the world began
[33:29] but now is main manifest and by the
[33:31] scriptures of the prophets
[33:33] according to the commandments of the
[33:34] everlasting god made known to all
[33:37] nations for the obedience of faith
[33:40] first corinthians 12 13 states paul's
[33:43] revelation
[33:44] that both jews and gentiles become a
[33:46] part of jesus's body
[33:48] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[33:51] for by one spirit
[33:52] are we all baptized into one body
[33:55] whether we be jews or gentiles
[33:57] whether we be bond or free and have been
[33:59] all made to drink into one spirit
[34:02] any jew or gentile with the baptism of
[34:04] the holy ghost
[34:05] is part of the family of god having the
[34:07] same benefits
[34:08] and inheritance abraham's spiritual seed
[34:13] galatians chapter 3 unpacks paul's
[34:15] revelation
[34:16] from jesus that anyone whether jew or
[34:19] gentile
[34:20] with faith in christ is a spiritual seat
[34:23] of abraham
[34:24] paul's letter to the galatians was
[34:26] probably one of his first epistles
[34:28] and shows how directly and intensely he
[34:30] attacked legalism
[34:31] and heresies in chapter 3 paul pleads
[34:34] with the galatians to avoid legalism
[34:37] especially since they started serving
[34:38] jesus by faith
[34:40] the apostle refers his readers to
[34:42] abraham and his justification by faith
[34:44] alone
[34:45] and quotes genesis 12 3 to prove
[34:48] abraham's seed is now a spiritual seed
[34:51] with the same justification it's amazing
[34:53] how much revelation god placed in this
[34:55] one short verse
[34:57] god foretold the times of the gentiles
[34:59] two thousand years in advance
[35:02] four verses teach that anyone with faith
[35:04] in jesus
[35:05] is a spiritual seed of abraham verse 7
[35:08] says
[35:09] know ye therefore that they which are of
[35:11] faith the same
[35:12] are the children of abraham verse 9 says
[35:15] so then they which be of faith are
[35:17] blessed with faithful abraham
[35:20] verse 26 says for ye are all children of
[35:23] god by faith
[35:24] in christ jesus and verse 29 says
[35:27] and if ye be christ then are ye
[35:29] abraham's seed and heirs
[35:31] according to the promise the rest of
[35:34] chapter 3 highlights jesus
[35:36] the true seed of abraham taking the
[35:39] curse of the law upon himself
[35:40] so that we might be justified by faith
[35:43] in him
[35:44] paul then emphasizes the promise of the
[35:46] spirit or
[35:47] baptism of the holy ghost in their souls
[35:50] calling it the blessing of abraham
[35:52] the baptism of the holy ghost is a
[35:54] spiritual circumcision
[35:56] the new testament token for abraham's
[35:58] seed
[35:59] romans 2 verse 29 says it's the
[36:02] circumcision of the heart
[36:04] the chapter ends by stating those
[36:06] baptized into christ
[36:07] have put on christ's righteousness and
[36:10] shall inherit all of abraham's blessings
[36:13] genuine christians are abraham's
[36:14] spiritual seed by faith
[36:16] with the spiritual circumcision given to
[36:19] the jew first
[36:20] and also to the gentile to dissolve all
[36:23] doubts
[36:23] paul uses galatians chapter 4 to further
[36:26] prove his point
[36:28] twice his emphasis is on the born again
[36:30] experience
[36:31] the holy ghost baptism of the soul
[36:33] verses 1 through 7 explained god's
[36:35] spirit
[36:36] in your heart changes you from a slave
[36:39] to a son
[36:40] which is called the adoption of sons a
[36:42] second mention is in verse 29
[36:45] as paul declares those born after the
[36:47] spirit are children of the free woman
[36:49] meaning you are abraham's true offspring
[36:52] and therefore inherit the promised
[36:54] blessings
[36:57] christ creates one body and one temple
[37:00] in ephesians chapters 2 and 3 paul both
[37:03] identifies and explains the mystery and
[37:06] revelation of god's new church
[37:09] chapter 2 begins with 10 memorable
[37:11] verses magnifying god's work in saving
[37:14] us
[37:14] by grace through faith beginning in
[37:17] verses 11 and 12
[37:19] paul tells the ephesians to remember
[37:20] their hopeless gentile condition
[37:23] prior to knowing christ they were
[37:25] without christ
[37:26] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[37:28] israel
[37:29] and strangers from the covenants of
[37:31] promise having no hope
[37:33] and without god in the world verse 13
[37:36] says they were
[37:37] far away from god but are now made nigh
[37:40] by the blood of christ in verse 14 paul
[37:44] declares jesus
[37:45] is our peace because he has made jews
[37:47] and gentiles one
[37:49] by breaking down the middle wall of
[37:51] partition between them
[37:53] paul is likely referring to the wall in
[37:55] herod's temple
[37:56] separating gentiles from jews upon the
[37:59] wall hung an inscription
[38:01] written in latin and greek warning
[38:03] gentiles of certain death if they would
[38:05] enter the inner courts
[38:07] beyond their court named the court of
[38:09] the gentiles
[38:10] in other words it was immediate war with
[38:12] jewish temple guards
[38:14] if a gentile attempted to get physically
[38:16] closer to worshipping almighty god
[38:19] jews enjoyed worship closer to god as
[38:22] the core of women and court of men
[38:23] surrounded the core of priests
[38:25] where sacrifices were offered christ's
[38:28] blood
[38:28] tears down this wall abolishing all the
[38:31] commandments against gentiles
[38:33] creating peace with god for both jew and
[38:35] gentile
[38:36] paul paints two pictures of the new
[38:38] unity in christ for jews and gentiles
[38:41] one body and one temple the cross makes
[38:44] them
[38:44] one new man in one body and christ is
[38:47] the head of this body
[38:49] this new body has access to father god
[38:52] through the one spirit
[38:54] the one holy temple is paul's second
[38:56] picture in verses
[38:57] 19 through 22 the apostle announces
[39:01] gentiles are fellow citizens alongside
[39:04] jews in the household of god
[39:06] this new holy temple has jesus christ as
[39:09] the chief cornerstone
[39:11] and the foundation of the apostles and
[39:13] prophets
[39:14] christian jews and gentiles are built
[39:16] upon this magnificent foundation
[39:19] making the temple grow together into
[39:21] god's dwelling place
[39:23] and habitation of god through the spirit
[39:26] paul's one temple imagery was divinely
[39:28] foreshadowed
[39:30] in the construction of solomon's temple
[39:32] one thousand years before christ
[39:34] this awe-inspiring temple took seven
[39:37] years to complete
[39:38] which foreshadowed jesus using seven
[39:41] church ages
[39:42] to build his spiritual temple during the
[39:44] times of the gentiles
[39:47] fascinatingly solomon didn't rely solely
[39:49] upon jewish help for its construction
[39:52] 1st kings 5 details solomon's
[39:55] partnership with a gentile king
[39:57] hiram of tyree in order to finish the
[40:00] temple
[40:01] both kings and their people jews and
[40:03] gentiles
[40:04] partnered together in making god's
[40:06] natural earthly habitation
[40:08] as a beautiful type of christian jews
[40:11] and gentiles
[40:12] composing the one temple of god's
[40:14] spiritual habitation
[40:16] the body of christ god's spiritual
[40:18] temple he dwells in today
[40:20] is currently under construction being
[40:22] built with devoted jewish
[40:24] and gentile hearts in ephesians chapter
[40:27] 3
[40:27] paul calls himself a prisoner of jesus
[40:29] christ for you gentiles
[40:31] that he should preach among the gentiles
[40:34] the unsearchable riches of christ
[40:36] and to make all men see what is the
[40:38] fellowship of the mystery
[40:41] paul was a love slave for christ's will
[40:43] his calling was to preach
[40:44] jesus's amazing multifaceted love to
[40:48] gentiles
[40:49] as verses 17-19 affirm
[40:53] the apostle wants all men to see the
[40:55] fellowship of the mystery
[40:56] or joint participation in the greek
[40:59] verses 6 and 12 declare both
[41:01] jews and gentiles participate in
[41:03] partaking of god's promises
[41:05] by having full access to jesus christ
[41:09] ephesians 3 verse 5 emphatically
[41:11] declares this revelation was
[41:13] in other ages not made known unto the
[41:15] sons of men
[41:17] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[41:19] apostles and
[41:20] prophets by the spirit you learn even
[41:23] god's prophets cannot know revelations
[41:25] until the almighty ordains it
[41:28] additionally
[41:29] there can be no hard feelings towards
[41:31] jews for their previous separation from
[41:33] gentiles
[41:34] because it was ordained by the father
[41:36] how exciting it must have been for paul
[41:38] and those ephesians
[41:40] to know god was now presently revealing
[41:43] a mystery and they were the first to
[41:45] hear it
[41:46] another revelation of the mystery is
[41:48] that the one body of christians
[41:50] both alive on earth and those in heaven
[41:52] have one family name
[41:54] the lord jesus christ as verses 14 and
[41:57] 15
[41:58] teach the name above all names is the
[42:01] lord jesus
[42:02] christ as the book of acts records
[42:04] believers being baptized in this name
[42:06] devils being cast out in this name and
[42:09] miracles being done
[42:10] in this all-sufficient name acts 4 verse
[42:13] 12
[42:13] forever proclaims there is none other
[42:16] name under heaven
[42:17] given among men whereby we must be saved
[42:22] in ephesians 3 verses 14 through 21
[42:25] paul ends the chapter offering prayer
[42:27] that the ephesians would experience
[42:29] the riches of his glory to be
[42:31] strengthened with might by his spirit
[42:34] in the inner man his emphasis is on
[42:36] christ's spirit dwelling
[42:38] inside each believer also called the
[42:40] baptism of the holy ghost
[42:42] paul wants them to know the depths of
[42:44] christ's love which allows believers to
[42:46] be
[42:47] filled with all the fullness of god
[42:49] throughout all ages the church will
[42:51] glorify christ
[42:52] for sharing his power that worketh in us
[42:57] although in prison paul beseeches the
[42:59] prayers of his
[43:00] ephesian converts to pray for all men
[43:02] including paul
[43:04] ephesians 6 verses 18 through 20
[43:07] records paul's main prayer request for
[43:09] boldness to share this beautiful
[43:11] revelation
[43:12] with anyone willing to listen praying
[43:15] always
[43:16] and for me that utterance may be given
[43:18] unto me
[43:19] that i may open my mouth boldly to make
[43:22] known the mystery of the gospel
[43:24] for which i am an ambassador in bonds
[43:27] that therein i may speak
[43:28] boldly as i ought to speak
[43:32] letter to the colossians paul's letter
[43:35] to the colossians
[43:36] another prison epistle supports the
[43:38] revelation of one church
[43:40] a city in present-day turkey about 100
[43:43] miles east of ephesus
[43:45] colosse had a christian church through
[43:47] the missionary work of paul's helper
[43:49] epiphrus this letter is perhaps best
[43:52] known for giving the most complete
[43:53] expression of jesus christ supreme deity
[43:56] in chapter 1
[43:57] verses 15-20 immediately thereafter
[44:00] paul names another mystery god now
[44:02] manifests to the gentiles
[44:04] christ in you the hope of glory this is
[44:07] the doctrine of the baptism of the holy
[44:08] ghost
[44:09] see chapter six but later in galatians 3
[44:13] verses 10 through 14 paul has to remind
[44:16] the colossians
[44:17] a holy ghost-filled believer is a new
[44:19] man and must treat everyone in christ
[44:21] one body
[44:22] with love in jesus's one jew gentile
[44:26] church
[44:27] he is all and in all and have put on the
[44:30] new man
[44:31] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[44:33] image of him that created him
[44:35] where there is neither greek nor jew
[44:38] circumcision nor uncircumcision
[44:40] barbarian scythian bond nor free
[44:44] but christ is all and in all put on
[44:47] therefore
[44:48] as the elect of god holy and beloved
[44:51] bows of mercies
[44:52] kindness humbleness of mind meekness
[44:55] long-suffering forbearing one another
[44:58] and forgiving one another
[45:00] if any man have a quarrel against any
[45:03] at the end of this letter in colossians
[45:06] 4 verses 2 and 4
[45:07] paul echoes the same prayer requests he
[45:09] gave to the ephesians
[45:11] asking for open doors to share god's
[45:13] revelation
[45:14] continue in prayer and watch in the same
[45:17] with thanksgiving
[45:19] with all praying also for us that god
[45:21] would open unto us a door of utterance
[45:24] to speak the mystery of christ for which
[45:26] i am also in bonds
[45:28] that i may make it manifest as i ought
[45:30] to speak
[45:33] blessings and challenges in
[45:34] transitioning to one body
[45:37] the revelation of the one church mystery
[45:39] brings intimacy or partnership
[45:41] between jews and gentiles as paul wrote
[45:44] in ephesians 3 verse 9.
[45:46] examining the book of acts and paul's
[45:48] epistles reveals both the blessings of
[45:51] this partnership
[45:52] and the challenges that arose while
[45:54] transitioning to one body
[45:56] or one church god's blessings were
[45:58] apparent
[45:59] in paul's dealings with gentile churches
[46:01] three heartfelt examples include the
[46:03] philippians
[46:04] thessalonians and ephesians the church
[46:07] in philippi was paul's first
[46:09] european church started during his
[46:11] second missionary journey
[46:13] his letter to the philippians has been
[46:14] called his warmest and most personal
[46:17] in chapter 1 paul thanked god every time
[46:20] he remembered this church
[46:21] convinced god would finish the good work
[46:23] he began in them
[46:25] these christians had a place in paul's
[46:26] heart so much that he greatly longed to
[46:29] see them again
[46:30] the philippians loyalty to following
[46:32] paul's message
[46:33] was evident as they withstood heretics
[46:36] and legalists in the final chapter paul
[46:39] thanks the philippians for being the
[46:40] only church
[46:42] who contacted him about his physical
[46:43] needs having sent provisions to paul
[46:46] through epiphanitis paul assures them
[46:49] god will supply their own physical needs
[46:51] receive their giving as an offering to
[46:53] his glory and record their generosity
[46:56] as a deposit in their heavenly rewards
[46:58] bank account
[46:59] paul's two letters to the thessalonians
[47:01] demonstrate a deep emotional bond
[47:04] between the jewish apostle and these
[47:06] gentiles
[47:07] despite his very short stay among them
[47:10] this church was started during paul's
[47:11] second missionary trip
[47:13] as paul passed through thessalonica the
[47:15] capital city of macedonia
[47:18] thanksgiving and prayers were always
[47:20] flowing from paul's mouth
[47:21] for these believers because of their
[47:23] unceasing work of faith and labor of
[47:25] love
[47:26] despite persecutions the apostle was
[47:29] like a gentle nurse
[47:30] an instructive father among them taking
[47:33] nothing of theirs
[47:35] but giving out love only his ministry
[47:38] was so effective
[47:39] they willingly forsook their dead idols
[47:42] to serve the living
[47:43] and true god in 1st thessalonians
[47:46] chapter 4
[47:47] paul provided much comfort to them
[47:49] regarding their deceased loved ones
[47:51] promising them a future meeting in the
[47:53] air with their brethren
[47:54] and jesus christ at his return but
[47:58] warnings about the antichrist spirit
[48:00] were communicated
[48:01] and disorderly and lazy brothers were
[48:03] given correction in his second letter
[48:05] in paul's eyes the thessalonian converts
[48:08] were his heavenly crown
[48:09] and his glory and joy paul's longest
[48:12] missionary stay was with the ephesians
[48:14] during his third and final missionary
[48:16] trip
[48:17] with whom he stayed three years
[48:18] according to acts 20
[48:20] verse 31 it was through paul's teachings
[48:23] that 12
[48:23] ephesians initially received eternal
[48:25] life or the baptism of the holy ghost
[48:28] in paul's farewell with the ephesians in
[48:31] acts 20
[48:32] verses 17-38 one of the most touching
[48:35] and emotional scenes in scripture
[48:37] unfolds paul reminds them to imitate his
[48:40] humble
[48:41] selfless sacrifice and sincerity he
[48:44] taught them the whole counsel of god
[48:46] holding nothing good back from them he
[48:48] knows he's facing imprisonment and
[48:50] likely martyrdom
[48:51] but paul urges the leaders to feed and
[48:53] protect the saints
[48:55] because satan will send wolves into
[48:56] their flock finally
[48:58] in sorrow the jewish and gentile group
[49:01] praised and weeps together
[49:03] before accompanying paul to his
[49:05] departing ship
[49:06] proving christ's unsearchable love in
[49:09] his one body of believers
[49:11] and when he had thus spoken he kneeled
[49:12] down and prayed with them all
[49:14] and they all wept sore and fell on
[49:16] paul's neck and kissed him
[49:18] sorrowing most of all for the words
[49:20] which he spake
[49:21] that they should see his face no more
[49:24] and they accompanied him
[49:25] unto the ship many challenges sprang up
[49:28] as jew and gentile christians
[49:30] transitioned into one body the first
[49:33] challenge was likely peter's
[49:34] mistreatment
[49:35] of gentile christians recorded in
[49:37] galatians 2 verses 11-21
[49:41] it seems this struggle happened before
[49:42] the jerusalem council
[49:44] because paul never cites the conclusions
[49:46] of the council
[49:47] in the letter to the galatians galatians
[49:50] tells us peter so
[49:51] feared legalistic jews that he refused
[49:54] to eat with gentiles
[49:56] the very men who had the keys to the
[49:57] kingdom from jesus
[49:59] received a vision straight from god
[50:01] about his cleansing of the gentile
[50:02] people
[50:03] and first saw the holy ghost baptized
[50:06] gentiles into the body of christ
[50:08] at cornelius house mistreated christian
[50:11] gentiles
[50:12] peter's influence was so great it caused
[50:15] barnabas
[50:16] to join him in the sinful separation but
[50:19] paul would have none of it
[50:20] was standing peter to his face in front
[50:22] of all the apostles and elders
[50:24] blaming him for hypocrisy it's believed
[50:26] peter repented and again fellowshipped
[50:28] with gentiles
[50:29] as he had before circumcision
[50:33] was the second issue in acts 15. certain
[50:36] jewish christians from judea
[50:38] were teaching gentiles must be
[50:39] circumcised to be saved
[50:41] paul and barnabas strongly resisted this
[50:44] teaching
[50:44] causing the brethren to send paul and
[50:46] barnabas to jerusalem
[50:48] to counsel with the apostles and elders
[50:50] about this doctrine
[50:52] this is often called the jerusalem
[50:54] council
[50:55] peter offers his conviction that
[50:57] gentiles are in fact saved
[50:59] and no different from christian jews
[51:01] paul and barnabas follow peter
[51:03] by sharing testimonies about god's
[51:05] miracles and wonders
[51:06] done among gentiles james gives the
[51:09] final convincing words to settle the
[51:11] matter
[51:12] and bring peace to every heart claiming
[51:14] peter's words were correct because they
[51:16] aligned with amos's
[51:17] prophecy that god would take the
[51:19] gentiles for his namesake
[51:21] in amos 9 verses 11 and 12.
[51:25] in that day will i raise up the
[51:26] tabernacle of david that has fallen
[51:29] and close up the breaches thereof and
[51:31] i'll raise up his ruins and i will build
[51:33] it
[51:33] as in the days of old that they may
[51:35] possess the remnant of edom
[51:37] and of all the heathen which are called
[51:39] by my name saith the lord
[51:41] that doeth this james's conclusion is
[51:44] not to trouble the gentiles
[51:46] with forced circumcision but give them
[51:49] four guidelines
[51:50] for the time being in acts 15 verse 20.
[51:54] abstain from pollution of idols abstain
[51:57] from fornication
[51:58] abstain from things strangled abstain
[52:01] from blood
[52:03] of course in the years to come jesus
[52:04] would reveal more truths for gentiles to
[52:06] live by
[52:07] through paul's epistles who taught the
[52:10] ephesians the whole council of god
[52:12] within his three years with them but
[52:14] here in acts 15
[52:16] the jerusalem apostles and elders
[52:18] heartily receive
[52:19] james's sentence and send letters of
[52:22] this decision to all their churches
[52:24] making the saints rejoice in their
[52:25] christian freedoms
[52:27] a third example is again about
[52:29] circumcision but worthy of an individual
[52:32] mention which is paul's circumcision of
[52:34] timothy
[52:36] some wonder why paul would refuse to let
[52:37] titus be circumcised
[52:39] yet later paul himself would perform
[52:41] timothy's circumcision
[52:43] the answer is each case had different
[52:45] conditions leading to different results
[52:49] galatians 2 verses 3 and 4 explains
[52:52] titus
[52:52] a pure greek gentile was under pressure
[52:55] to come
[52:56] under the bondage of law keeping from
[52:58] false brethren
[53:00] paul vehemently opposed the false
[53:02] brothers
[53:03] refusing to become a part of their
[53:04] heretical legalistic movement
[53:07] timothy's circumstances were much
[53:09] different because no one was pressuring
[53:10] him
[53:11] to be circumcised he was half jew half
[53:14] greek
[53:15] his father didn't permit him to be
[53:16] circumcised as a baby
[53:18] yet he was diligently trained in judaism
[53:20] by his mother and grandmother
[53:22] it appears timothy voluntarily chose
[53:25] circumcision
[53:26] for three reasons he wanted to honor his
[53:29] judaic
[53:29] upbringing he didn't want to offend the
[53:32] jews he was associating with
[53:34] and he believed his circumcision might
[53:36] cause non-believing jews to listen to
[53:38] his gospel message
[53:40] acts 16 verse 3 says him would paul have
[53:43] to go forth with him
[53:45] and took and circumcised him because of
[53:47] the jews which were in those quarters
[53:49] for they knew all that his father was a
[53:51] greek
[53:53] as paul's travel companion timothy was
[53:56] in constant contact with jews
[53:58] and he felt he could influence them if
[54:00] he had the token of abraham's covenant
[54:02] in his flesh
[54:04] timothy's selflessness in regards to his
[54:07] physical body
[54:08] in order to promote the spiritual body
[54:10] of christians
[54:11] inspires believers to prayerfully seek
[54:14] any solution
[54:15] within holiness to overcome challenges
[54:17] to spreading the gospel
[54:19] of jesus christ it seems timothy
[54:22] followed paul's example
[54:23] to go to any reasonable lengths to save
[54:25] souls
[54:27] for though i be free from all men yet
[54:29] have i made myself servant
[54:31] unto all that i might gain the more and
[54:34] unto the jews i became as a jew
[54:36] that i might gain the jews to them that
[54:38] are under the law
[54:39] as under the law that i might gain them
[54:42] that are under the law
[54:43] to the weak became i is weak that i
[54:46] might gain the weak
[54:47] i am made all things to all men that i
[54:50] might by all means
[54:51] save some the feasts
[54:54] and holy days of israel the feasts of
[54:57] israel are historical worship events
[55:00] mandated for jews but prophetically
[55:02] reveal god's redemptive plan
[55:04] for jews and gentiles in particular the
[55:07] fourth feast
[55:08] the feast of weeks reveals god's plan to
[55:10] unite jews and gentiles into one body
[55:13] one church and more time must be devoted
[55:16] to its essential details
[55:18] kevin j connors the feast of israel
[55:21] provides an extensive teaching on the
[55:23] feasts
[55:24] conor writes ceremonies and all that
[55:26] pertains to the letter and ritual of the
[55:28] law
[55:28] are empty in vain apart from the reality
[55:31] in christ
[55:33] under the mosaic covenant god instituted
[55:35] three major feasts
[55:37] two of which had two additional minor
[55:39] feasts or holy days
[55:41] for a total of seven feasting or holy
[55:44] days
[55:44] in which israeli males were to appear
[55:47] before him
[55:48] with sacrifices three times in a year
[55:51] shall all thy males appear before the
[55:53] lord thy god
[55:54] in the place which he shall choose in
[55:56] the feast of unleavened bread
[55:58] and in the feast of weeks and the feast
[56:00] of tabernacles
[56:01] and they shall not appear before the
[56:03] lord empty every man shall give as he is
[56:06] able
[56:06] according to the blessing of the lord
[56:08] thy god which he hath given thee
[56:12] leviticus 23 provides a chronological
[56:14] list of the feast and holy days
[56:16] along with imperative details israel was
[56:19] to honor in both
[56:20] celebration and mourning depending upon
[56:23] god's commands
[56:25] feast of passover feast of unleavened
[56:27] bread
[56:28] feast of chief of first fruits feast of
[56:32] weeks
[56:33] the feast of trumpets holy day of
[56:36] atonement
[56:37] feast of tabernacles god initiated these
[56:40] gatherings
[56:41] to meet with his people on his terms the
[56:44] holy one appointed the meeting place
[56:46] and sacrifices to be offered giving his
[56:48] children
[56:49] annual meeting times to abstain from
[56:51] work in order to focus on their
[56:53] relationship with him
[56:55] each of the seven feasts and holy days
[56:57] allows you to see god's historical
[57:00] and prophetic purposes for israel and
[57:02] the gentiles
[57:04] the passover beginning on the 14th day
[57:06] of the first month of the new year
[57:09] at evening each family in israel
[57:11] sacrificed a one-year-old
[57:13] male lamb they were to eat a meal the
[57:16] lamb along with unleavened bread
[57:18] its historical purpose was to be a
[57:20] memorial of god delivering them from
[57:23] egyptian slavery full details are found
[57:25] in exodus 12
[57:27] verses 1 through 29 leviticus 23
[57:31] verses 4 through 5 and deuteronomy 16
[57:34] verses 1 through 8. the passover's
[57:37] prophetic purpose
[57:38] was fulfilled in jesus death on calvary
[57:42] as he fulfilled every old testament
[57:44] detail to the letter
[57:45] truly messiah died for both jew and
[57:48] gentiles
[57:49] the sins of the entire world first john
[57:52] 2 verse 2 says
[57:54] jesus is the propitiation for our sins
[57:57] and not for ours only but also for the
[58:00] sins of the whole world
[58:02] christ delivered all from the slavery of
[58:04] sin paul teaches in first corinthians 5
[58:07] 7 believers experience a continual
[58:09] passover
[58:10] and faithfully partake of the lord's
[58:12] supper in remembrance of him
[58:15] the unleavened bread beginning on the
[58:17] evening of passover
[58:19] this bread feast lasted seven days
[58:22] emphasizing a diet totally separate from
[58:24] leaven
[58:25] it represented israel partaking of no
[58:27] egyptian influence
[58:29] as levin puffs up an entire lump of
[58:31] dough
[58:32] any israeli with leaven found in his
[58:34] house was instantly cut off from the
[58:36] congregation
[58:37] once in the promised land jewish fathers
[58:40] were to explain
[58:41] this bread feast to their children in
[58:43] memory of god's mighty hand to deliver
[58:45] israel all details are found in exodus
[58:48] 12
[58:49] verses 8 through 39 exodus 13
[58:52] verses 1 to 10 leviticus 23
[58:56] verses 6 through 8 numbers 28
[58:59] verses 17-25 and deuteronomy 16
[59:03] verses 1 through 8. jesus christ again
[59:07] fulfills the prophetic purpose of this
[59:09] feast
[59:09] for his death separated us from our sins
[59:12] or leaven
[59:13] his blood washed away all sins just as
[59:16] the jewish
[59:17] houses were washed free from leaven he
[59:20] is the true bread of life from heaven
[59:22] all christians feast on continually and
[59:25] exclusively
[59:27] christ manifested sinless perfection
[59:29] being free from leaven
[59:31] or sinful influences unlike the
[59:33] pharisees
[59:34] 11 false doctrines in matthew 16
[59:37] verses 11 and 12 paul teaches we still
[59:41] keep this spiritual feast
[59:42] not with old leaven neither with the
[59:45] leaven of malice and wickedness
[59:47] but with the unleavened bread of
[59:48] sincerity and truth
[59:52] the sheaf of firstfruits this was the
[59:55] final feast of the first month
[59:57] observed on the day after the sabbath
[1:00:00] sunday
[1:00:01] following the passover a priest waved a
[1:00:04] sheaf of barley first fruits
[1:00:06] before the lord as a forerunner that the
[1:00:08] rest of the crop
[1:00:09] would later mature for harvest
[1:00:11] additionally
[1:00:12] a lamb burnt offering was included along
[1:00:15] with a meal and drink offering
[1:00:17] this feast is taught in exodus 23 verse
[1:00:20] 19
[1:00:21] leviticus 23 verses 9 through 14
[1:00:24] and numbers 28 verse 26. prophetically
[1:00:28] this feast foreshadowed the greatest day
[1:00:30] in human history
[1:00:31] the resurrection of jesus christ which
[1:00:34] took place on a sunday
[1:00:35] the first day of the week this feast was
[1:00:38] fulfilled as god
[1:00:39] not a priest waived his resurrected son
[1:00:42] before israel as the firstborn from the
[1:00:45] dead
[1:00:46] or first begotten from the dead jesus
[1:00:49] resurrection demonstrates
[1:00:50] that all believers would also experience
[1:00:52] the resurrection
[1:00:53] at harvest time or the end of the world
[1:00:56] romans 8 verse 11 promises the same holy
[1:01:00] spirit
[1:01:00] that raised christ from the dead shall
[1:01:02] also quicken our mortal bodies
[1:01:05] paul writes every man will be raised
[1:01:07] from the dead in his own order
[1:01:09] with christ being the firstfruits the
[1:01:12] wave chief
[1:01:12] and other offerings speak of jesus death
[1:01:15] and resurrection
[1:01:16] because they are inseparable the burnt
[1:01:19] offering represents jesus's sinless
[1:01:21] death
[1:01:22] through total obedience the meal and
[1:01:24] drink offerings
[1:01:26] speak of believers continual communion
[1:01:28] with christ
[1:01:29] through the lord's supper the feast of
[1:01:33] weeks
[1:01:34] also known as pentecost in the new
[1:01:36] testament the feast of weeks occurred in
[1:01:38] the third month
[1:01:39] or 50 days after first fruits the number
[1:01:43] 50 represents deliverance
[1:01:44] liberty or freedom for israel as every
[1:01:47] 50 years they celebrated the jubilee
[1:01:49] year
[1:01:50] in which slaves were released from
[1:01:52] bondage and debts and all inheritances
[1:01:55] were restored to their original owners
[1:01:58] after moses brought israel out of egypt
[1:02:00] following the passover
[1:02:02] they worshiped god and experienced the
[1:02:03] power and terror of his presence
[1:02:06] at mount sinai fifty days after the
[1:02:09] exodus
[1:02:09] while receiving the ten commandments
[1:02:12] once living in canaan
[1:02:14] israel's week's feast included numerous
[1:02:16] sacrifices
[1:02:18] two loaves of bread baked with leaven
[1:02:20] were waved before the lord
[1:02:22] israel was commanded to bring the
[1:02:23] following free will gifts
[1:02:25] burnt meat drink sin and peace offerings
[1:02:30] this feast marked the beginning of the
[1:02:32] four month
[1:02:33] harvest season in which israel was to
[1:02:35] harvest most
[1:02:37] but not all their crops in order for the
[1:02:39] poor and stranger to have food
[1:02:41] this feast is detailed in exodus 34
[1:02:45] verses 22 and 23 leviticus
[1:02:48] 23 verses 15 through 21
[1:02:51] numbers 28 verses 26 through 31
[1:02:55] and deuteronomy 16 verses 9 through 12.
[1:03:00] acts chapter 2 fulfilled the feast of
[1:03:02] weeks also known as the day of pentecost
[1:03:05] the 50th day after first fruits
[1:03:08] pentecost symbolized spiritual freedom
[1:03:10] and liberty
[1:03:11] for souls of men by the baptism of the
[1:03:14] holy ghost
[1:03:15] ten days prior to this outpouring of the
[1:03:17] holy ghost
[1:03:18] jesus promised his disciples he would
[1:03:20] send this spiritual baptism
[1:03:22] and commanded them to wait for in
[1:03:24] jerusalem
[1:03:26] and being assembled together with them
[1:03:28] commanded them that they should not
[1:03:30] depart from jerusalem
[1:03:31] but wait for the promise of the father
[1:03:34] which saith he
[1:03:35] ye have heard of me for john truly
[1:03:37] baptized with water
[1:03:39] but ye shall be baptized with the holy
[1:03:41] ghost not many days hence
[1:03:43] but ye shall receive power after that
[1:03:45] the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:03:47] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:03:50] in jerusalem
[1:03:51] and in all judea and in samaria and unto
[1:03:54] the uttermost part of the earth
[1:03:57] israel's reception of the ten
[1:03:58] commandments type the pouring out of the
[1:04:00] holy ghost on the day of pentecost
[1:04:03] in figure 4 conor beautifully compares
[1:04:06] and contrasts
[1:04:07] many not all of the aspects of the
[1:04:10] giving of moses's law
[1:04:12] to the giving of the holy ghost old
[1:04:14] testament pentecost
[1:04:16] compared to new testament pentecost
[1:04:19] first the presence of god manifests in
[1:04:22] thunders lightnings
[1:04:23] thick clouds fire audible voice in the
[1:04:26] new testament the prince of god
[1:04:28] manifests
[1:04:29] in rushing mighty wind licks of fire
[1:04:31] speaking in tongues
[1:04:33] in the old testament pentecost occurred
[1:04:35] at mount sinai on the 50th day
[1:04:38] in the new testament it occurred in
[1:04:40] jerusalem near mount zion
[1:04:42] on the 50th day the old testament
[1:04:45] pentecost was the birthday of judaism
[1:04:47] through the old covenant
[1:04:49] in the new testament pentecost was the
[1:04:51] birthday of christianity
[1:04:53] through the new covenant the old
[1:04:55] testament pentecost had the giving of
[1:04:57] the law
[1:04:58] on tables of stone written by the finger
[1:05:00] of god
[1:05:01] the new testament pentecost had the
[1:05:03] giving of the holy ghost on fleshly
[1:05:05] tables of men's hearts
[1:05:07] written by the spirit of god
[1:05:10] at the old covenant pentecost three
[1:05:13] thousand souls died
[1:05:15] at the new testament pentecost three
[1:05:17] thousand souls were added to the church
[1:05:22] in the old testament pentecost it was
[1:05:24] the ministration of death through the
[1:05:26] law
[1:05:27] of sin and death in the new testament
[1:05:29] pentecost
[1:05:30] it's the ministration of life through
[1:05:32] the law of the holy spirit
[1:05:35] at the old testament pentecost there was
[1:05:37] glory on moses face
[1:05:40] in the new testament pentecost the glory
[1:05:42] of god
[1:05:43] is in the face of jesus christ
[1:05:46] in the old testament pentecost moses's
[1:05:48] face was veiled so
[1:05:50] people could not see the glory in the
[1:05:52] new testament pentecost
[1:05:54] believers have unveiled faces to be
[1:05:56] changed into the same glory
[1:05:58] of christ in the old testament pentecost
[1:06:02] the glory was to be done away with in
[1:06:05] the new testament pentecost
[1:06:06] the glory remains
[1:06:10] the most unique aspect of weeks is the
[1:06:12] waving of two
[1:06:14] leaven infused loaves of bread herein is
[1:06:17] the revelation of one church
[1:06:19] composed of both jew and gentile as
[1:06:22] these loaves are called
[1:06:24] a new meat offering unto the lord notice
[1:06:27] these two loaves are called one offering
[1:06:30] singular the two loaves are one
[1:06:33] substance
[1:06:34] just as the two peoples jew and gentile
[1:06:37] become one paul teaches this in first
[1:06:40] corinthians 10
[1:06:41] verse 17 for we being many are one bread
[1:06:45] and one body
[1:06:47] for we are all partakers of that one
[1:06:49] bread
[1:06:50] again the apostle says having abolished
[1:06:53] in his flesh the enmity
[1:06:55] even the law of commandments contained
[1:06:57] in ordinances
[1:06:59] for to make in himself of twain one new
[1:07:02] man
[1:07:02] so making peace when the priest waved
[1:07:06] two loaves in israel
[1:07:08] he foretold god waving both
[1:07:10] spirit-filled
[1:07:11] jews and gentiles before the world
[1:07:14] the first loaf waived was the 120
[1:07:17] born-again jewish christians on the day
[1:07:20] of pentecost
[1:07:21] soon afterwards the lord waved a second
[1:07:24] loaf
[1:07:24] the spirit born gentiles in corneos's
[1:07:27] house
[1:07:28] before peter and other witnesses the new
[1:07:31] aspect of this offering
[1:07:33] is the addition of levin which was
[1:07:35] forbidden in passover
[1:07:37] and accompanied by the threat of
[1:07:39] excommunication
[1:07:40] but in this third month of the year
[1:07:42] leaven is acceptable
[1:07:44] passover represented the sacrifice of
[1:07:46] the sinless son of god
[1:07:48] while pentecost represents the ministry
[1:07:51] of the new testament church
[1:07:52] and the sin nature that remains inside
[1:07:55] their bodies
[1:07:56] holy ghost-filled jews and gentiles
[1:07:58] still sin
[1:08:00] but do not let it have dominion over
[1:08:02] their daily lives
[1:08:04] christians now present and give their
[1:08:06] lives as offerings unto god
[1:08:08] during this new testament season leaven
[1:08:12] is a common representation for evil and
[1:08:14] sin
[1:08:15] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:17] christians become new creatures
[1:08:19] in christ jesus just as the leavened
[1:08:22] wave loaves
[1:08:23] were new offerings spirit-filled
[1:08:25] christians have both divinity
[1:08:27] christ's spirit in their souls and sin
[1:08:31] in their flesh dwelling inside them as
[1:08:34] paul explains in colossians 1 verse 27
[1:08:37] and romans 7 verse 17 and 7
[1:08:41] 20 respectively john goes as far as
[1:08:44] saying the believer's soul
[1:08:46] the nature of the human spirit anointed
[1:08:48] with the holy ghost
[1:08:50] is the christian's true identity and
[1:08:52] cannot sin
[1:08:54] whosoever is born of god doth not commit
[1:08:56] sin
[1:08:57] for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:09:00] cannot sin
[1:09:01] because he is born of god christ's new
[1:09:04] church would always have the element
[1:09:06] of sin to deal with but she was given
[1:09:08] the holy spirit
[1:09:09] to bring unity to other christians while
[1:09:12] overcoming
[1:09:13] sin's effects ci scofield
[1:09:16] describes the unique meaning of the two
[1:09:18] loaves
[1:09:19] contrasted to the one wave sheaf at
[1:09:22] first fruits
[1:09:23] observe it is now loaves not a sheaf of
[1:09:27] separate growths
[1:09:28] loosely bound together but a real union
[1:09:31] of particles
[1:09:32] making one homogeneous body the descent
[1:09:35] of the holy spirit at pentecost
[1:09:38] united the separated disciples into one
[1:09:41] organism
[1:09:42] at pentecost god united the souls of the
[1:09:45] christians
[1:09:45] through the indwelling power of the holy
[1:09:47] ghost causing them to have
[1:09:49] one heart and one soul this same unity
[1:09:53] spread to the gentiles
[1:09:54] at corneas house and then multiplied
[1:09:57] into many millions more
[1:09:59] gentiles leviticus 23 verses 15 through
[1:10:03] 21
[1:10:04] speaks of five additional sacrifices of
[1:10:07] this feast
[1:10:08] that complement the two wave loaves
[1:10:10] burnt
[1:10:11] meat drink sin and peace offerings
[1:10:15] just as a burnt offering was totally
[1:10:17] consumed in devotion to god
[1:10:19] christians give themselves wholly to
[1:10:21] god's work
[1:10:22] meat and drink offerings symbolize the
[1:10:25] bread and wine
[1:10:26] believers consume in the new testament
[1:10:29] lord's supper
[1:10:30] the sin offering represents our constant
[1:10:32] need for jesus's forgiveness of sins
[1:10:35] through his heavenly role as high priest
[1:10:38] mediator
[1:10:40] the hebrew definition for peace
[1:10:41] offerings teaches these oblations stood
[1:10:44] for voluntary expressions
[1:10:46] of thanksgiving to god which christians
[1:10:48] faithfully offer
[1:10:50] through vocal praises by him therefore
[1:10:53] let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
[1:10:56] god continually
[1:10:58] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[1:11:00] thanks to his name
[1:11:02] another aspect of the week's feast
[1:11:05] fulfilled in acts 2
[1:11:06] is the holy euphoric worship by the 120
[1:11:10] holy ghost-filled saints recall the 120
[1:11:14] were so filled with god's spirit they
[1:11:16] left the upper room
[1:11:17] around 9 a.m and headed to jerusalem
[1:11:20] streets
[1:11:21] to boldly declare the wonderful works of
[1:11:23] god the onlookers from 17 nations
[1:11:26] were so amazed by the worship they saw
[1:11:28] and heard that they concluded they were
[1:11:30] drunk with wine
[1:11:32] acts 2 is clearly the fulfillment of
[1:11:34] deuteronomy 16
[1:11:36] verses 10 through 12 which teaches
[1:11:38] israel was to rejoice
[1:11:40] with many people before the lord in
[1:11:42] remembrance of god granting them
[1:11:44] freedom from egypt romans 14 verse 17
[1:11:48] validates this the kingdom of god is not
[1:11:51] meat and drink but righteousness and
[1:11:54] peace
[1:11:55] and joy in the holy ghost scripture says
[1:11:58] two different harvests took place in the
[1:12:00] first and third months
[1:12:02] barley started in the first month at
[1:12:04] first fruits
[1:12:06] and continued through the second while
[1:12:08] wheat harvest began in the third month
[1:12:10] at weeks
[1:12:11] and lasted until the seventh month
[1:12:13] exodus 34 verse 22 says
[1:12:16] weeks was the first fruits of wheat
[1:12:18] harvest while ruth
[1:12:20] 2 verse 23 differentiates the two feasts
[1:12:23] so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz
[1:12:26] to glean unto the end of barley harvest
[1:12:29] and a wheat harvest
[1:12:31] and dwelt with her mother-in-law both
[1:12:34] feasts had first fruits waived in
[1:12:36] anticipation
[1:12:37] for the rest of the crop to mature
[1:12:40] fulfilled by jesus's resurrection
[1:12:42] and the 120 being filled with the holy
[1:12:44] ghost
[1:12:45] 50 days later the feast of pentecost
[1:12:49] initiated a
[1:12:50] four month long period of wheat harvest
[1:12:52] until the next
[1:12:53] feast trumpet began in the seventh month
[1:12:57] the week's four-month period signifies
[1:13:00] the long
[1:13:01] nearly 2000 year period from 30 a.d to
[1:13:05] present
[1:13:05] in which god would offer the new
[1:13:07] covenant to both jew and gentile
[1:13:10] until the times of the gentiles were
[1:13:12] fulfilled
[1:13:13] this left lots of time to labor and
[1:13:15] harvest before the next phase of life
[1:13:20] the former and latter reigns before the
[1:13:23] final harvest
[1:13:25] reaping the wheat harvest was the main
[1:13:27] task of the feast of pentecost
[1:13:29] just as jesus's great commission
[1:13:32] emphasizes saving souls
[1:13:33] in the field of the world's nations but
[1:13:36] no harvest is possible
[1:13:38] without both former and latter reigns
[1:13:42] rain has a symbolism in both the old and
[1:13:44] new testaments
[1:13:45] on the day of pentecost peter declares
[1:13:47] the falling of the holy spirit
[1:13:49] fulfilled joel's prophecy of god pouring
[1:13:51] out his spirit
[1:13:52] in joel 2 verse 28. hosea 6
[1:13:56] verses 1 through 3 is another evidence
[1:13:59] that god symbolizes his spirit
[1:14:01] coming down upon the people as rain
[1:14:04] his going forth is prepared as the
[1:14:06] morning and he shall come
[1:14:08] unto us as the rain as the latter and
[1:14:11] former rain
[1:14:11] unto the earth now look at the truth of
[1:14:15] the two rains necessary for harvest
[1:14:18] former and latter the purpose of the
[1:14:21] former rains
[1:14:22] were to water the seeds at the beginning
[1:14:25] of the autumnal
[1:14:26] growing season while the latter rains
[1:14:28] were the last rains
[1:14:30] necessary to bring the seed to maturity
[1:14:32] in the spring
[1:14:34] israel had a sacred year and a civil
[1:14:36] year
[1:14:37] the sacred year was from march or april
[1:14:40] to september or october
[1:14:42] the civil year was from october or
[1:14:44] november
[1:14:45] to february or march the former rains
[1:14:49] fell around
[1:14:50] october or november and the latter rains
[1:14:52] fell
[1:14:53] in the first month of the sacred year
[1:14:55] around march or april
[1:14:57] logically the latter rain had to fall in
[1:15:00] or shortly before the first month
[1:15:02] just in time for israel to harvest the
[1:15:04] barley firstfruits
[1:15:06] to be waived by the priest on the feast
[1:15:08] of first fruits
[1:15:10] the former and latter rain truth must be
[1:15:12] applied prophetically to the times of
[1:15:14] the gentiles
[1:15:15] or from 30 a.d to the present christians
[1:15:19] today are in the spiritual feast of
[1:15:20] weeks
[1:15:21] the long season of harvest before god
[1:15:23] returns to the jews
[1:15:25] in the feast of trumpets peter was clear
[1:15:28] that god was going to pour
[1:15:29] or reign his spirit upon all flesh which
[1:15:32] has been verified through the gentiles
[1:15:34] receiving the holy ghost
[1:15:36] in the book of acts and all throughout 2
[1:15:38] 000 years of church history
[1:15:40] holy ghost rain showers have fallen upon
[1:15:43] every age
[1:15:44] and its leaders from john the divine to
[1:15:46] iranians
[1:15:47] from columba to luther from wesley to
[1:15:50] wigglesworth
[1:15:52] but jesus and other prophets foretold
[1:15:54] end time conditions
[1:15:56] in the time of the gentiles before the
[1:15:58] final harvest
[1:15:59] would ultimately mere a spiritual famine
[1:16:02] due to disobedience
[1:16:04] christ asked nevertheless when the son
[1:16:07] of man cometh
[1:16:08] shall he find faith on the earth paul
[1:16:10] calls it a
[1:16:11] falling away or apostasy from truth
[1:16:14] caused by an influx of seducing spirits
[1:16:17] who grow increasingly more deceptive
[1:16:20] then amos 8 verses 11 and 12 reads
[1:16:24] behold the days come saith the lord god
[1:16:27] that i will send a famine in the land
[1:16:29] not a famine of bread nor thirst for
[1:16:32] water but of hearing the words of the
[1:16:34] lord
[1:16:34] and they shall wander from sea to sea
[1:16:37] and from the north
[1:16:38] even to the east they shall run to and
[1:16:40] fro to seek the word of the lord
[1:16:42] and shall not find it jesus describes
[1:16:45] the final wheat harvest
[1:16:47] in matthew 13 verses 24-30
[1:16:50] and verses 36-43 christians are indeed
[1:16:54] labeled wheat
[1:16:56] matching the wheat harvest of israel's
[1:16:58] natural feast of weeks
[1:17:00] and are gathered into christ's barn but
[1:17:02] the apostate tares are burned in fire
[1:17:06] since jesus's final harvest is required
[1:17:09] before the wrath and judgment of the
[1:17:11] great tribulation
[1:17:13] former latter reigns are necessary to
[1:17:15] bring the wheat to maturity
[1:17:17] james 5 verses 7 and 8 support these
[1:17:21] prophecies
[1:17:22] giving us a promise of one more former
[1:17:24] latter rain
[1:17:25] before the last gentile harvest be
[1:17:28] patient therefore brethren
[1:17:30] unto the coming of the lord behold the
[1:17:32] husbandman waiteth
[1:17:34] for the precious fruit of the earth and
[1:17:36] has long patience for it
[1:17:38] until he received the early and latter
[1:17:40] rain
[1:17:41] be also patient establish your hearts
[1:17:44] for the coming of the lord
[1:17:46] draweth nigh the holy spirit's
[1:17:49] inspiration
[1:17:50] helps us find more details about the
[1:17:52] gentile latter rain prophecy
[1:17:54] in joel 2 verses 23-26
[1:17:58] it's a fitting location because the
[1:18:00] beginning of the new covenant
[1:18:02] is also located in this chapter joel 2
[1:18:05] verses 28-32
[1:18:07] verses 23-26 describe what the former
[1:18:11] and latter rain
[1:18:12] holy ghost anointings will produce in
[1:18:15] christians lives
[1:18:16] be glad then ye children of zion and
[1:18:19] rejoice in the lord your god
[1:18:21] forget given you the former rain
[1:18:22] moderately and he will cause to come
[1:18:24] down for you the rain
[1:18:26] the former rain and the latter rain in
[1:18:28] the first month
[1:18:30] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[1:18:32] the fat shall overflow with wine and oil
[1:18:35] and i'll restore to you the years that
[1:18:36] the locusts hath eaten
[1:18:38] the worm the caterpillar and the palmer
[1:18:41] worm
[1:18:42] my great army which i sent among you and
[1:18:44] ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[1:18:47] and praise the name of the lord your god
[1:18:49] that hath dealt
[1:18:50] wondrously with you and my people shall
[1:18:53] never be ashamed
[1:18:56] the hebrew word for former can mean
[1:18:58] teacher
[1:18:59] meaning christians should expect a great
[1:19:01] teaching anointing
[1:19:03] to come in preparation for the rapture
[1:19:05] harvest
[1:19:06] chapter 13 explains his teaching
[1:19:08] ministry
[1:19:09] after the former reign god plans to send
[1:19:12] a latter reign anointing
[1:19:14] or rapturing faith as his church
[1:19:16] recognizes the conditions
[1:19:18] times and seasons of the rapture she
[1:19:21] will begin seeking god for the latter
[1:19:23] rain through prayer
[1:19:24] as zechariah 10 verse 1 says ask ye of
[1:19:28] the lord
[1:19:28] rain in the time of the latter rain so
[1:19:31] the lord shall make bright clouds and
[1:19:33] give them showers of rain
[1:19:35] to every one grass in the field
[1:19:38] jesus will then send his spirit in the
[1:19:40] same measure as the day of pentecost
[1:19:43] producing the same results this divine
[1:19:46] latter rain
[1:19:47] will restore back to the final church
[1:19:50] everything the early church possessed
[1:19:52] wheat word wine joy
[1:19:56] and oil baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:59] before the rapture harvests christ
[1:20:01] church will have the same power
[1:20:03] truth miracles and faith of the
[1:20:06] apostolic saints
[1:20:08] jesus promises to bring the last church
[1:20:10] right back to where she started at
[1:20:12] pentecost
[1:20:13] in acts 2. joel 2 verse 23 says the
[1:20:16] latter rain is sent
[1:20:17] in the first month in hebrew this phrase
[1:20:20] can mean
[1:20:20] formally at first shortly before the
[1:20:23] rapture
[1:20:24] the latter rain falls on the gentile
[1:20:26] church as it did
[1:20:27] formerly at first on the day of
[1:20:30] pentecost
[1:20:33] the feasts of the seventh month
[1:20:36] following the four month long
[1:20:37] feast of weeks came two holy days and
[1:20:40] one feast in the seventh month
[1:20:42] or september-october time period
[1:20:45] trumpets atonement and tabernacles
[1:20:48] these final holy and feast days have
[1:20:51] nothing to do with the new testament
[1:20:53] church
[1:20:53] for she is already in heaven enjoying
[1:20:55] the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:20:57] based upon first thessalonians 4 17 the
[1:21:00] church was caught up
[1:21:02] or snatched off the earth by jesus in
[1:21:04] the rapture harvest before the
[1:21:06] tribulation
[1:21:07] then god grafts israel back into his
[1:21:10] blessings
[1:21:11] and immediate focus of ministry
[1:21:14] the trumpets on the first day of the
[1:21:17] seventh month
[1:21:18] israel held a sabbath to blow trumpets
[1:21:21] and offer burnt
[1:21:22] meat and sin offerings made by fire unto
[1:21:25] the lord
[1:21:26] this day is called a holy convocation or
[1:21:29] sacred gathering or assembly
[1:21:31] trumpets were blown for many purposes
[1:21:34] but here they were to gather
[1:21:35] israel for the day of atonement or
[1:21:37] national cleansing
[1:21:39] nine days later trumpets was not a
[1:21:42] rejoicing time like weeks
[1:21:43] but rather a call to self-examination
[1:21:47] israel knew trumpets meant preparing
[1:21:48] them to appear
[1:21:50] for atonement in mourning for the tenth
[1:21:52] day was a day to afflict their souls
[1:21:55] meaning humiliation and being downcast
[1:21:58] trumpets is taught in leviticus 23
[1:22:01] verses 23-25
[1:22:03] and numbers 29 verses 1-6
[1:22:07] prophetically the feast of trumpets
[1:22:09] represents the prophetic ministry of the
[1:22:11] two witnesses
[1:22:12] of revelation 11 verses 1 through 13
[1:22:16] during the first three and a half years
[1:22:17] of daniel's 70th or final week
[1:22:20] prophet's voices are likened unto
[1:22:22] trumpets in ezekiel
[1:22:24] 33 verses 1 through 9 isaiah 58 verse 1
[1:22:28] and hosea 8 verse 1. with the help of
[1:22:32] two prophet supernatural ministry
[1:22:34] the guileless 144 thousand faithful jews
[1:22:37] will be gathered in jerusalem
[1:22:39] hearing the two prophets preach about
[1:22:41] jesus christ prepares them to receive
[1:22:44] him at atonement
[1:22:45] as always faith comes by hearing in the
[1:22:48] meantime
[1:22:49] israel's worshiping god in their newly
[1:22:51] rebuilt temple
[1:22:53] three times daniel foretells israel
[1:22:55] offering animal sacrifices
[1:22:57] as they are currently forbidden to offer
[1:22:59] them due to their lack of a temple
[1:23:02] animal sacrifices will again be allowed
[1:23:05] as part of israel's seven year covenant
[1:23:07] with the pope antichrist but he will cut
[1:23:10] them off in the midst of the weak
[1:23:11] in order to enshrine his own abomination
[1:23:14] that works desolation
[1:23:17] the day of atonement on the tenth day of
[1:23:19] the seventh month
[1:23:20] was israel's national cleansing the most
[1:23:23] holy day of the year
[1:23:25] jews came to the temple fasting and
[1:23:27] mourning in complete humiliation of body
[1:23:30] and spirit before god almighty
[1:23:32] in a day to afflict their souls
[1:23:35] along with all routine sacrifices two
[1:23:38] goats were offered to god for atonement
[1:23:41] one died on the altar and the other
[1:23:43] carried away israel's sins far away into
[1:23:45] the wilderness
[1:23:47] describes more aspects of this atonement
[1:23:50] day
[1:23:50] saying on this day only which took place
[1:23:53] but once a year
[1:23:55] the high priest entered into the holiest
[1:23:57] of all within the veil
[1:23:59] with the blood of the lord's goat the
[1:24:01] sin offering
[1:24:02] here he sprinkled the blood on the mercy
[1:24:04] seat the blood of the sin offering on
[1:24:07] the great day of atonement
[1:24:08] brought about the cleansing of all sin
[1:24:11] all iniquity
[1:24:12] and all transgression the priesthood the
[1:24:15] sanctuary
[1:24:16] and israel as a nation experience blood
[1:24:18] atonement
[1:24:19] thus being reconciled to god atonement
[1:24:22] is taught in leviticus 16
[1:24:24] verses 1-34 leviticus chapter 23
[1:24:29] verses 26-32 and numbers 29
[1:24:33] verses 7 through 11.
[1:24:36] prophetically atonement is fulfilled
[1:24:38] after the three and a half year ministry
[1:24:40] of the two witnesses when israel meets
[1:24:42] their messiah
[1:24:44] jesus christ face to face israel will
[1:24:47] acknowledge their atonement
[1:24:48] since she rejected the actual atonement
[1:24:50] two thousand years prior
[1:24:52] jesus death on the cross and heavenly
[1:24:55] acceptance
[1:24:56] having seen their two prophets raptured
[1:24:58] to heaven the 144 thousand jews glorify
[1:25:02] god
[1:25:02] as the realization of jesus as their
[1:25:04] messiah
[1:25:05] solidifies then the holy king of kings
[1:25:09] and lord of lords
[1:25:10] jesus christ physically appears to the
[1:25:13] faithful jewish remnant
[1:25:15] seeing jesus scars one brave jew will
[1:25:18] ask
[1:25:18] what are these wounds and thine hands
[1:25:21] jesus sweetly answers
[1:25:22] those with which i was wounded in the
[1:25:25] house of my friends
[1:25:27] instantly the guilt and shame of their
[1:25:29] ancestors overtakes them
[1:25:32] they are now aware how israel willingly
[1:25:34] crucified god's son
[1:25:35] the root of jesse david's righteous
[1:25:38] branch
[1:25:38] the seed of the woman this causes israel
[1:25:42] to desperately mourn as never before
[1:25:44] despite their fatal move the crucified
[1:25:47] one now calls the jews his
[1:25:49] friends amazing grace overwhelms the
[1:25:52] remnant
[1:25:53] zechariah 12 verses 10 through 14
[1:25:56] captures their bitter humiliation and i
[1:25:59] will pour upon the house of david
[1:26:01] and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem
[1:26:04] the spirit of grace and of supplications
[1:26:06] and they shall look upon me whom they
[1:26:08] have pierced and they shall mourn for
[1:26:10] him as one mourneth
[1:26:11] for his only son and shall be in
[1:26:14] bitterness for him
[1:26:15] as one that is in bitterness for his
[1:26:16] firstborn
[1:26:18] in that day shall there be a great
[1:26:20] morning in jerusalem as the morning of
[1:26:22] hadadraman in the valley of megadon
[1:26:26] and the land shall mourn every family
[1:26:28] apart
[1:26:29] the family of the house of david apart
[1:26:31] and their wives apart
[1:26:33] the family of the house of nathan apart
[1:26:35] and their wives apart
[1:26:37] the family of the house of levi apart
[1:26:39] and their wives apart
[1:26:41] the family of shimyai apart and their
[1:26:43] wives apart
[1:26:45] all the families that remain every
[1:26:47] family apart and their wives apart
[1:26:51] israel's souls are afflicted and rightly
[1:26:53] so but then god
[1:26:55] opens a fountain of forgiveness
[1:26:57] zechariah 13 verse 1 states
[1:26:59] in that day there shall be a fountain
[1:27:01] opened to the house of david
[1:27:04] and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for
[1:27:06] sin and for uncleanness
[1:27:08] being forgiven and blameless the 144
[1:27:12] thousand
[1:27:12] can be born again by the baptism of the
[1:27:14] holy ghost
[1:27:16] also called the seal of god in their
[1:27:18] foreheads
[1:27:20] isaiah 66 verse 8 prophesied of israel's
[1:27:23] incredible spiritual birthday
[1:27:25] claiming it would happen in one day
[1:27:27] saying who hath heard such a thing
[1:27:30] who has seen such things shall the earth
[1:27:32] be made to bring forth in one day
[1:27:35] or shall a nation be born at once for as
[1:27:38] soon as zion travailed
[1:27:39] she brought forth her children with the
[1:27:42] 144 thousand
[1:27:43] born again three of gabriel's six tasks
[1:27:47] listed in daniel 9 24 are now complete
[1:27:52] finish the transgression make an end of
[1:27:54] sins
[1:27:55] and make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:27:58] israel has finally been reconciled back
[1:28:00] to god she's finally received the new
[1:28:03] covenant
[1:28:04] returning to the current new testament
[1:28:06] believer we experience our spiritual day
[1:28:08] of atonement
[1:28:09] when we're born again by the baptism of
[1:28:11] the holy ghost
[1:28:13] one requirement of being born again is
[1:28:15] repentance
[1:28:16] according to acts 2 38 repent and be
[1:28:19] baptized
[1:28:20] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:28:22] christ for the remission of sins
[1:28:24] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:28:26] holy ghost
[1:28:28] in the greek lexicon repent means an
[1:28:31] abhorrence of one's past sins
[1:28:34] this abhorrence matches the afflicted
[1:28:36] soul requirement
[1:28:37] of the old testament day of atonement
[1:28:40] after genuine repentance the believer
[1:28:42] obeys god's word
[1:28:43] and is soon born again by the holy ghost
[1:28:46] acts 5
[1:28:47] verse 32 reads and we are as witnesses
[1:28:50] of these things
[1:28:51] and so is also the holy ghost whom god
[1:28:54] has given to them that obey him
[1:28:56] for this cause the church did not need
[1:28:58] to go through the tribulation period
[1:29:00] as blinded israel did her sins were
[1:29:02] already atoned for by the precious blood
[1:29:04] of jesus christ
[1:29:06] romans 5 verse 11 declares and not only
[1:29:09] so
[1:29:10] but we also joy in god through our lord
[1:29:13] jesus christ
[1:29:14] by whom we have now received the
[1:29:16] atonement
[1:29:17] the true spiritual day of atonement took
[1:29:20] place
[1:29:20] on the morning of christ's resurrection
[1:29:23] showing himself to mary magdalene first
[1:29:26] jesus said touch me not for i am not yet
[1:29:28] ascended to my father
[1:29:30] christ forbid contact to fulfill other
[1:29:33] scriptures
[1:29:34] through his death he was not only the
[1:29:36] two goats
[1:29:37] but also the spiritual red heifer of
[1:29:40] numbers 19.
[1:29:41] any priest or jew who touched the
[1:29:44] sacrificed heifer
[1:29:45] or its ashes was instantly unclean
[1:29:49] jesus knew he should not be touched yet
[1:29:51] until he presented his blood to the
[1:29:53] father
[1:29:54] after talking with mary jesus ascended
[1:29:56] to his father in heaven
[1:29:58] to present his acceptable sacrifice and
[1:30:01] obtain our redemption according to
[1:30:02] hebrews 9
[1:30:04] verses 11 and 12 but christ being come
[1:30:07] and high priest of good things to come
[1:30:10] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[1:30:12] not made with hands that is to say not
[1:30:15] of this building
[1:30:16] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[1:30:19] but by his own blood he entered in
[1:30:21] once into the holy place having obtained
[1:30:23] eternal redemption
[1:30:24] for us once received in heaven and
[1:30:27] possessing our redemption
[1:30:29] christ descended back to earth on
[1:30:31] resurrection sunday
[1:30:33] and showed himself alive to the
[1:30:34] disciples no doubt he was embraced by
[1:30:37] his beloved disciples
[1:30:39] one week later he fulfilled thomas's
[1:30:41] desire
[1:30:42] to touch his scars jesus said
[1:30:45] reach hither thy finger and behold my
[1:30:47] hands
[1:30:48] and reach hither thy hand and thrust it
[1:30:50] into my side
[1:30:52] and be not faithless but believing the
[1:30:55] sacrificial work is done
[1:30:57] jesus with a new glorified body can now
[1:30:59] be touched the book of hebrews unveils
[1:31:03] jesus's
[1:31:04] complete redemptive work as god's one
[1:31:07] and only atonement for sins
[1:31:09] christ shed blood fulfilled every
[1:31:12] oblation and sacrifice
[1:31:13] cleanse the heavenly sanctuary and
[1:31:16] allowed him to be both mediator and high
[1:31:18] priest
[1:31:19] between god and man jesus can rapture
[1:31:22] his church
[1:31:22] off the earth before the tribulation
[1:31:25] because she's already cleansed by the
[1:31:27] atonement
[1:31:28] she having no condemnation through
[1:31:30] believing
[1:31:31] and receiving the baptism of the holy
[1:31:33] ghost has already passed from death unto
[1:31:36] life
[1:31:36] her soul is sealed unto the day of
[1:31:38] redemption
[1:31:40] the tabernacles following the solemn
[1:31:44] day of atonement came the celebratory
[1:31:46] tabernacles
[1:31:47] which occurred after the final harvest
[1:31:49] of the year
[1:31:50] fruit tabernacles began on the 15th day
[1:31:54] of the seventh month and lasted eight
[1:31:56] days
[1:31:58] during the first seven days israelis
[1:32:00] would rejoice
[1:32:01] while dwelling in temporary booths made
[1:32:04] from tree branches
[1:32:05] in remembrance of god making israel
[1:32:07] dwell in booths
[1:32:09] after their exodus from egypt each day
[1:32:12] involved its own
[1:32:13] burnt meat and drink offerings besides
[1:32:16] the routine daily sacrifices
[1:32:18] unto god the eighth day was a sabbath
[1:32:21] and included a final offering made by
[1:32:23] fire as a solemn assembly
[1:32:26] and holy convocation this feast is
[1:32:29] taught in leviticus 23
[1:32:31] verses 33 through 44.
[1:32:34] prophetically israel's tabernacles
[1:32:37] foretold christ's one thousand-year
[1:32:39] millennial reign
[1:32:40] detailed in isaiah 65 verses 19
[1:32:43] through 22 and revelation 20 verses 1
[1:32:47] through 6.
[1:32:48] the sun's peaceful reign after the
[1:32:50] tribulation
[1:32:52] and battle of armageddon fulfills the
[1:32:54] true meaning of this feast
[1:32:56] this feast follows the final fruit
[1:32:58] harvest which has its fulfillment in
[1:33:00] revelation chapter 14.
[1:33:02] verses 13-16 show the son of man reaping
[1:33:06] the harvest of the earth
[1:33:08] which is the 144 thousand being sealed
[1:33:10] by the holy ghost
[1:33:12] in verses one through five they are
[1:33:14] called first fruits unto god
[1:33:16] and to the lamb in verse four later in
[1:33:19] the chapter verses
[1:33:21] 17-20 teach the gathering of the vine
[1:33:24] and its destruction through the wrath of
[1:33:26] god all sinners who took the mark of the
[1:33:28] beast
[1:33:29] experienced this awful judgment before
[1:33:31] the millennium
[1:33:33] with all the harvest complete you see
[1:33:35] the barley harvest of first fruits
[1:33:37] fulfilled by christ's resurrection with
[1:33:39] the old testament saints
[1:33:41] the wheat harvest of weeks represented
[1:33:43] the one church composed of jew and
[1:33:45] gentile
[1:33:46] lastly the fruit harvest before
[1:33:48] tabernacles
[1:33:49] represented the spirit sealed 144
[1:33:52] 000 jewish remnant back to tabernacles
[1:33:57] the seven days of rejoicing represents
[1:33:59] god getting his seventh day with his
[1:34:01] creation
[1:34:03] recall from genesis chapters one and two
[1:34:05] that god had six days
[1:34:07] or six thousand years of peace during
[1:34:09] his week of creation
[1:34:11] second peter 3 verse 8 explains a day
[1:34:14] with god
[1:34:14] equals a thousand years of man's time
[1:34:18] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:34:21] thing
[1:34:21] that one day is with the lord as a
[1:34:23] thousand years
[1:34:25] and a thousand years as one day but
[1:34:28] satan interrupted god's seventh day of
[1:34:30] rest
[1:34:31] when he possessed the serpent and
[1:34:33] begowed eve
[1:34:34] into eating the fruit who shared it with
[1:34:36] adam plunging mankind
[1:34:38] into sin bondage edenic conditions will
[1:34:41] be restored
[1:34:42] and god will have a sin-free rest day
[1:34:46] living in temporary booths will be
[1:34:48] fulfilled as christ's spirit-filled
[1:34:50] followers
[1:34:51] build their own homes harvest crops and
[1:34:54] reign over cities and nations with him
[1:34:57] isaiah 65 verses 21 and 22 read
[1:35:01] and they shall build houses and inhabit
[1:35:03] them and they shall plant vineyards and
[1:35:05] eat the fruit of them
[1:35:07] they shall not build and another inhabit
[1:35:10] they shall not plant in another eat
[1:35:12] for as the days of a tree are the days
[1:35:14] of my people
[1:35:16] and mine elect shall long enjoy the work
[1:35:18] of their hands
[1:35:21] yes the one jew gentile church
[1:35:24] will rejoice for one thousand years as
[1:35:26] satan is bound and cast into the
[1:35:28] bottomless pit
[1:35:30] with no tempter the church exercises
[1:35:33] complete joy
[1:35:34] fruitfulness peace and victory
[1:35:37] the eighth day holy convocation
[1:35:40] symbolized the beginning of the eternal
[1:35:42] covenant
[1:35:43] eight is god's number of a new beginning
[1:35:46] here
[1:35:46] the eighth day is the first day
[1:35:48] repeating which speaks of the unending
[1:35:51] cycles of eternity
[1:35:53] time is over the new jerusalem our
[1:35:56] eternal home
[1:35:57] has come down to earth out of heaven no
[1:36:00] more temporary booths
[1:36:01] or homes christ's family has made it to
[1:36:04] her eternal home
[1:36:06] everything done on earth will be done as
[1:36:08] it were in heaven
[1:36:09] since heaven has come down to earth
[1:36:13] the multi-national great multitude
[1:36:16] revelation 7 verses 9 through 17
[1:36:19] gives you a glimpse of christ's
[1:36:21] multinational
[1:36:22] new testament church gathered before
[1:36:25] god's throne
[1:36:26] calling her a great multitude which no
[1:36:29] man could number
[1:36:31] of all nations and kindreds and people
[1:36:34] and tongues christ's word sent via the
[1:36:37] great commission
[1:36:38] did not return void every nation under
[1:36:41] heaven
[1:36:42] had the opportunity to repent and those
[1:36:44] who received it
[1:36:46] have eternal life and loudly worship
[1:36:48] their savior
[1:36:49] with cries and palm waving
[1:36:52] this great praise likely takes place in
[1:36:54] the new jerusalem
[1:36:56] as jesus leads his people to living
[1:36:58] fountains of waters
[1:37:00] the sun is not needed and he wipes away
[1:37:02] all tears from their eyes
[1:37:04] matching the future home description in
[1:37:06] revelation 21 verse 4
[1:37:09] and 22 verses 1 through 5.
[1:37:12] every skin and hair color imaginable
[1:37:15] is beautifully represented in this
[1:37:17] eternal gathering
[1:37:18] this great white robed multitude is like
[1:37:21] a bride's expensive
[1:37:23] radiant flower bouquet kept and
[1:37:26] preserved for decoration
[1:37:28] in the couple's first home jesus is one
[1:37:31] jew gentile church is a timeless
[1:37:34] incorruptible
[1:37:35] bouquet bride the multitude's journey to
[1:37:38] god's throne wasn't easy
[1:37:40] the angel tells john they suffered
[1:37:42] through great tribulation
[1:37:44] yet wash their robes white in the blood
[1:37:46] of the lamb
[1:37:47] paul declares all that will live godly
[1:37:50] in christ jesus
[1:37:51] shall suffer persecution all godly
[1:37:54] saints suffer some form of persecution
[1:37:56] but it's allowed so we'll know christ in
[1:37:59] the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:38:02] since it's a church from all nations
[1:38:04] israel must be included
[1:38:06] this shows not all jews are blinded to
[1:38:08] christ as their messiah
[1:38:10] most are blinded but not all god's
[1:38:13] immutable purpose
[1:38:15] to have a church from every nation is
[1:38:17] accomplished
[1:38:18] believers from every nation are
[1:38:19] represented because god
[1:38:21] so loved the world westerners
[1:38:25] understanding easterners converting to
[1:38:28] christ
[1:38:30] the bulk of this chapter deals with
[1:38:31] gentiles coming into relationship
[1:38:33] with the god of the jews a major issue
[1:38:36] in bible times
[1:38:37] today though westerners must recognize
[1:38:40] and understand
[1:38:41] how the gospel is returning back to
[1:38:42] easterners and god allows liberties and
[1:38:45] diversities of worship
[1:38:47] within our holy calling a brief look at
[1:38:50] the last 500 years of history
[1:38:53] allows you to trace god's revivals
[1:38:55] moving from east to west
[1:38:57] and now back to the east germany
[1:38:59] experienced revival
[1:39:01] with martin luther in the 16th century
[1:39:04] 200 years later
[1:39:05] god moved mightily in england through
[1:39:07] john wesley's ministry
[1:39:09] the azusa street revival manifested in
[1:39:11] california usa
[1:39:13] 100 years after wesley but the revival
[1:39:16] has left america
[1:39:18] because she left god's word america's
[1:39:20] laws no longer honor god
[1:39:22] as she's legalized the killing of nearly
[1:39:24] 50 million babies
[1:39:26] along with the protection of homosexual
[1:39:28] marriage
[1:39:30] indeed god is currently stirring revival
[1:39:32] fires
[1:39:33] in the middle east and china voice of
[1:39:35] the martyrs canada
[1:39:37] reports middle easterners are coming to
[1:39:39] christ by
[1:39:40] thousands upon thousands the council of
[1:39:43] foreign relations
[1:39:44] says china's christian revival is so
[1:39:47] great it may have the world's
[1:39:48] largest population of christians by
[1:39:51] 2030.
[1:39:53] you've probably realized god's revival
[1:39:55] will end up back in the east where it
[1:39:57] started
[1:39:58] in jerusalem when the 144 thousand
[1:40:01] israelis are sealed with the holy ghost
[1:40:04] during the tribulation
[1:40:06] these facts demonstrate your scriptural
[1:40:07] knowledge of god's desire to have
[1:40:10] one jew gentile church no nation
[1:40:13] tyrant military or leader can stop god's
[1:40:17] predestined plan
[1:40:18] to save souls in every nation chinese
[1:40:21] muslims
[1:40:22] hindus and more are all coming into the
[1:40:25] open
[1:40:26] door of faith unto the gentiles jesus
[1:40:29] assures us
[1:40:30] he is the door and saves all who come
[1:40:33] through him
[1:40:34] in john 10 verse 9 i am the door
[1:40:37] for by me if any man enter in he shall
[1:40:40] be saved
[1:40:40] and shall go in and out and find pasture
[1:40:45] it's necessary and natural for
[1:40:47] western-born christians
[1:40:49] to rejoice in god's mighty move in the
[1:40:51] east
[1:40:52] and pray for every lost soul to find
[1:40:54] salvation in christ
[1:40:57] concerning christian liberties god
[1:40:59] allows believers to express their faith
[1:41:01] in different ways
[1:41:02] within his holy plan four examples
[1:41:05] include foods observance of holy days
[1:41:09] wine and jewelry a full teaching
[1:41:11] addresses these topics
[1:41:13] in my book restoring christian modesty
[1:41:16] god's perfect will for your outward
[1:41:18] appearance
[1:41:20] eastern christians may make different
[1:41:22] choices than westerners
[1:41:24] in food holy days wine usage and jewelry
[1:41:28] should we hear of eastern christians
[1:41:30] worshiping in ways different than our
[1:41:31] own
[1:41:32] let us not be quick to judge instead
[1:41:35] let us be quick to express patience with
[1:41:38] our eastern brothers and sisters
[1:41:40] and even reach out in love and seek to
[1:41:42] understand why they choose certain
[1:41:44] actions
[1:41:45] just as paul wrote we must respect
[1:41:48] others convictions
[1:41:49] and be thankful they are trying their
[1:41:51] best to worship jesus christ
[1:41:53] you can be confident that the god who
[1:41:55] started the work of salvation
[1:41:57] in their lives will complete it if they
[1:42:00] are sensitive to the holy spirit
[1:42:02] he will guide them into all truth
[1:42:04] specifically
[1:42:05] messianic jews may worship in ways
[1:42:08] unfamiliar to us
[1:42:09] they may keep the natural feasts and
[1:42:12] holy days of israel nazarite vows
[1:42:15] and other old testament commands while
[1:42:17] believing in jesus christ
[1:42:19] remember paul took his liberties as a
[1:42:21] jewish christian
[1:42:22] keeping jewish feasts in israel when
[1:42:25] possible
[1:42:26] and keeping vows to god these actions
[1:42:28] were no longer required
[1:42:30] under the new covenant but paul knew he
[1:42:32] had liberty to express his faith
[1:42:34] through his personal convictions paul
[1:42:37] knew jesus
[1:42:38] the god who gave him the bulk of the new
[1:42:40] testament
[1:42:41] was also the god of the old testament as
[1:42:44] jews
[1:42:45] chinese muslims and hindus all come to
[1:42:48] christ by the thousands
[1:42:49] let us rejoice in their salvation and
[1:42:52] respect their liberties
[1:42:54] westerners need humility including
[1:42:57] myself
[1:42:58] let's humbly acknowledge our extreme
[1:43:00] ignorance of jewish
[1:43:02] and other eastern traditions many gospel
[1:43:05] stories cannot be understood
[1:43:07] without valuable details from jewish
[1:43:09] culture
[1:43:10] may westerners become meek and learn
[1:43:12] from the meek one
[1:43:13] christ jesus valuing god's vast
[1:43:16] beautiful diversity the rewards for
[1:43:20] receiving the revelation of the one
[1:43:22] church of jew and gentile
[1:43:25] those who receive the revelation of one
[1:43:27] church composed of jews and gentiles
[1:43:30] gain the rewards of fellowship and
[1:43:32] promises
[1:43:33] paul says all men can see the fellowship
[1:43:35] of the mystery
[1:43:36] or partnership of the mystery all
[1:43:39] christians will benefit from godly
[1:43:41] partnership
[1:43:42] no matter our race culture or skin color
[1:43:45] holy ghost-filled christians must
[1:43:47] partner together in strengthening each
[1:43:49] other
[1:43:50] this may manifest in praying for one
[1:43:52] another and helping meet each other's
[1:43:54] physical needs
[1:43:55] as the philippians met paul's needs
[1:43:59] another form of partnership is having
[1:44:01] preachers cooperate in spreading the
[1:44:02] gospel
[1:44:03] they must work together holding joint
[1:44:05] meetings in a city
[1:44:07] rather than competing against each other
[1:44:10] the body of jesus christ edifies or
[1:44:12] builds up itself
[1:44:13] in love not jealousy and competition
[1:44:17] leaders may agree to go separate
[1:44:18] directions in their ministries
[1:44:20] yet fully support one another pastors
[1:44:23] and ministers
[1:44:24] must lead the way in this partnership
[1:44:26] just as paul
[1:44:27] and peter modeled galatians 2 verses 9
[1:44:30] and 10 reads
[1:44:32] and when james cephas and john who seem
[1:44:35] to be pillars
[1:44:36] perceive the grace that was given unto
[1:44:38] me they gave to me and barnabas
[1:44:40] the right hands of fellowship that we
[1:44:42] should go unto the heathen
[1:44:44] and they unto the circumcision only they
[1:44:47] would that we should remember the poor
[1:44:49] the same which i also was forward to do
[1:44:53] a second reward is benefiting from god's
[1:44:55] promises
[1:44:56] as paul says all spirit-filled jews and
[1:44:59] gentiles
[1:45:00] are fellow heirs and of the same body
[1:45:03] and partakers of his promise
[1:45:05] in christ by the gospel all christians
[1:45:08] are privileged with the same promises
[1:45:10] of eternal rewards as well as the
[1:45:12] earthly benefits of salvation
[1:45:14] divine healing gifts and fruits of the
[1:45:17] spirit
[1:45:17] and more god's promises give us boldness
[1:45:21] and access with confidence to heaven's
[1:45:24] only high priest
[1:45:25] jesus christ certainly the faithful
[1:45:28] prayers of both jews and gentiles
[1:45:31] can touch the heart of the invisible god
[1:45:33] through his son
[1:45:34] who feels our pains and ever lives to
[1:45:37] make intercession
[1:45:38] for us the consequences for rejecting
[1:45:42] the revelation
[1:45:43] of the one church of jew and gentile
[1:45:47] there are three possible consequences
[1:45:48] for rejecting the revelation
[1:45:50] of the one church composed of jew and
[1:45:52] gentile the sins can be labeled as
[1:45:54] prideful discrimination
[1:45:56] cursing the blessed and complacency
[1:46:00] peter pridefully discriminated against
[1:46:03] gentiles
[1:46:04] by refusing to eat with them due to peer
[1:46:06] pressure from other jews
[1:46:08] who felt gentiles were still unclean
[1:46:11] paul said peter was to be blamed
[1:46:13] which in the greek lexicon means find
[1:46:15] fault with
[1:46:16] condemn peter's sin had brought
[1:46:18] temporary fault
[1:46:20] and condemnation upon him and led by the
[1:46:23] spirit
[1:46:24] paul called it out and corrected him
[1:46:26] christians today
[1:46:27] may fall under the same prideful
[1:46:30] self-righteous spirit
[1:46:31] thinking they are more holy than other
[1:46:33] ethnic groups
[1:46:34] thus separating themselves jude 1 verse
[1:46:38] 19
[1:46:38] warns that those who permanently
[1:46:40] separate themselves
[1:46:41] show they are carnal and sensual likely
[1:46:44] not having the baptism of the holy
[1:46:46] spirit
[1:46:47] let us physically gather more with
[1:46:49] saints as we see christ's second coming
[1:46:51] swiftly approaching cursing the blessed
[1:46:55] is a second consequence to rejecting the
[1:46:57] one church revelation
[1:46:59] just as taught in chapter 2 some
[1:47:01] gentiles may think
[1:47:02] israel is forever cursed and then
[1:47:05] condemn all jews
[1:47:06] in their angry hearts for crucifying
[1:47:08] their own messiah
[1:47:10] when a person curses others in air it
[1:47:13] reveals their own corrupt spiritual
[1:47:15] condition
[1:47:16] according to 2 timothy 2 verse 26 these
[1:47:19] corrupted ones are caught in the snare
[1:47:21] of the devil
[1:47:22] and need deliverance through repentance
[1:47:25] paul teaches complacency or lukewarmness
[1:47:28] is a major consequence of knowing god
[1:47:30] has opened the door of faith
[1:47:32] to the gentiles but not taking advantage
[1:47:35] of the opportunity
[1:47:37] romans 11 verses 18 through 22
[1:47:40] explains how gentiles are tempted to
[1:47:43] boast against the branches
[1:47:44] or jews but gentiles must keep the fear
[1:47:47] of the lord
[1:47:49] since god's goodness has extended to us
[1:47:51] the gentiles
[1:47:52] we must continue in his goodness or else
[1:47:54] be cut off from god's blessings
[1:47:56] due to complacency the apostle john in
[1:47:59] revelation
[1:48:00] 3 verses 14 through 19 identifies the
[1:48:04] same spirit of lukewarmness
[1:48:06] falling upon the gentile churches in the
[1:48:08] last days
[1:48:09] in his letter to the laodiceans
[1:48:12] christians must constantly keep the
[1:48:13] spirit of revival in their lives
[1:48:16] hungry and thirsting for more of
[1:48:17] christ's righteousness
[1:48:19] a holy ghost-filled christian daily
[1:48:21] acknowledges
[1:48:22] his need to fully depend upon the
[1:48:24] spirit's leading
[1:48:25] and strength you desire to increase your
[1:48:29] obedience
[1:48:30] perfecting holiness in the fear of god
[1:48:32] you can't stay the same or grow
[1:48:34] complacent
[1:48:35] you must and will overcome the inward
[1:48:38] sin nature violently battling against
[1:48:41] your mind
[1:48:42] jesus died and rose again to give you
[1:48:45] this victory
[1:48:47] conclusion god's loving heart desires
[1:48:50] unity
[1:48:51] harmony and partnership between
[1:48:53] christians of all nations
[1:48:55] kindreds and tongues he sent his holy
[1:48:57] spirit
[1:48:58] into believers hearts to accomplish this
[1:49:00] divine oneness
[1:49:02] the true born-again church of jesus
[1:49:04] christ has always been
[1:49:06] and always will be one people by the
[1:49:08] holy ghost
[1:49:10] jews and gentiles are truly united in
[1:49:12] one body
[1:49:13] as one bread with a real merging of
[1:49:16] particles
[1:49:17] united by the fire of the holy spirit
[1:49:20] the one church fulfills jesus's prayer
[1:49:22] for perfect unity
[1:49:24] in john 17 verse 23 i
[1:49:27] in them and thou in me that they may be
[1:49:30] perfect in one
[1:49:31] and that the world may know that thou
[1:49:33] has sent me and has loved them
[1:49:36] as thou hast loved me
[1:49:40] action steps to joining and blessing the
[1:49:43] one church of jew and gentile
[1:49:45] number one repent and seek the baptism
[1:49:48] of the holy ghost
[1:49:49] for this is the fire of god that will
[1:49:51] make your soul one
[1:49:53] with every born-again jew and gentile on
[1:49:55] the earth
[1:49:56] being born again is the only way to join
[1:49:58] the one church
