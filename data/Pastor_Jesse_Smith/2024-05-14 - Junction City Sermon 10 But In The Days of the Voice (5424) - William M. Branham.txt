that's good and hope uh everybody's been been fed on the word of God real well by God's grace and uh just thankful again to be here thanks for the invitation brother Irvin and I told Brother Irvin too if you want me to come back again in in the summer every other Thursday I'll be happy to do that by God's grace I would love to drive down here and be with the Saints and preach God's word uh I know uh I know how important it is you know uh to be established in the truth of the Bible uh you know when I first heard the message I would drive three hours across the state to Lima and that's where brother Craig Bo now he's a pastor in Connecticut and brother Isaiah Brooks he's now a pastor in Iowa that's where they would give me Bible studies and answer all my questions as much as possible I mean we don't know all the answers you know but we we sure got a lot of Bible Revelation by God's grace and so I just found that you know I did that for a number of years and I wrote down everything they said brother John I just made a list and eventually after the after I got into computers you know I started typing everything out so I got all these all these wonderful Revelations saved up there and uh I'm glad they're on the computer but I'm more grateful they're on the fleshly tables of my heart praise God because if I lose them that's fine uh the ible said the Holy Ghost will give me Remembrance in everything that I have need of Hallelujah I'm not trusting in the computer I'm trusting in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah but uh that's why I want to do that you know uh if you if you would like uh sermons there throughout the summer let me know we'll be happy to come down and Minister I'm grateful my wife could join me and my two little ones I'm very thankful my wife can come with us by God's grace so thank you honey for coming I appreciate that very much so I'd like to speak again this morning but in the days of The Voice of course this is looking at the ministry of God's Prophet uh brother brandham uh a Bible Prophet as you know and I like how you're all giving out those uh books you know uh as I told you you know the first time I heard brother brandham on tape uh listening to him I had headphones on I was I was chewing tobacco so I was still a I was a Christian but not a Sanctified one I was playing video games you know I was wasting my time playing video games and as I'm playing the video games I hear Brother Braham tell his life story and I just start crying I'm like I I've never heard a man preach like this I just had to turn off the video games and just listen to brother brandom eventually God delivered me from my tobacco addiction I'm thankful for that I've been uh many years free from that now by God's grace but just the power of the holy spirit in brother bram's voice and in his ministry was enough to shake me from my bad habits my worldly habits and direct me to one thing the word of God hallelujah how many feel that way today you're thankful for God's Prophet Hallelujah to direct you to the word of God Amen glad to hear that by the grace of the Lord so uh we'll take a few uh minutes here and uh look to the word of God I want to get my uh notes here kind of settled here so the Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now I'm recording this I know brother Iran likes to record them too um I I found you know as a young believer now I'm not so young anymore believer I first heard the message at the end of 2001 so it's been about 23 years I've been in this message and uh I've been preaching it since 2004 so I just pass 20 years of preaching um but I found that it's good to record Ser services and go back and listen to them like our brother said you know it's like that there's so much Revelation I can't hardly contain it right uh it's such a load of Revelation brother brand called it a tape full of Revelation a tape load of spiritual food and due season Hallelujah and uh so if you if you do that I know God will reveal even more to you and you know the the purpose of this friends and and family of God the purpose of this the purpose of Revelation is what Jesus said in Matthew 16 that the Gates of Hell could not overcome us right when God Reveals His word to us uh then his will is made known to us and then that that Revelation is so clear to us that in the times of testing the Revelation that God showed to us is going to help us overcome amen hallelujah because again that Revelation is written on our hearts and then in that moment of test you know we we have two choices presented before us the way of transgression the way of righteousness and brother B said when it all boils down to it he said that anchor will hold in the midst of the storm so when we're going through tests and trials the anchor will hold us praise God and that anchor is the anchor into the word of God the Rock of Ages right that's what we've heard you know an anchor in a ship wants to it wants to catch on a rock hallelujah and that's what happens when we go through stormy trials the anchor in our soul it's founded on a rock and Jesus said you must build your house on a rock hallelujah your life must be founded upon the rock of Revelation amen glory so our verse here is the seventh angel now notice what happens when he begins to sound the mystery of God would be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets so this ministry of brother brandham was to finish the mystery of God and brother brandom called it all the Loose Ends how many know that brother Bram said that all the loose end end this is what he said in is this a sign of the end sir brother Ram said but it is the seventh angel that had this type of message what was it notice his type of message finishing all the mysteries of God that are written in the book The Holy Bible the seventh angel is winding up all the Mysteries that's laying loose ended all throughout these organizations and denominations the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery that's what the Bible said finishes The Mystery of the written book Hallelujah so all all these denominations have some truth in them right we know the you know if you just go by history brother Ram says in the church age book you know the Sardis Church age that Martin Luther was was the beginning of the re Reformation right and he brought out that great Revelation the just shall live by faith we're not saved by works we're saved by grace and brother Ram said if I have to do anything to be saved then Jesus Christ died in vain Hallelujah is that a that a beautiful statement if you and I have to do anything to be saved then Jesus wasn't good enough for God amen amen right but if but if if we've been given a perfect sacrifice then we have perfect forgiveness amen hallelujah like the Bible says all all we have to do is repent of our sins that's all we have to do is repent believe Hallelujah and the rest of our life is just a dedication of it's our own Living Sacrifice Hallelujah that's what Revel Romans 12 says Paul said we must present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice that's our reasonable service once once once we accept Jesus's sacrifice for our sins we're saved we're on our way to heaven hallelujah our name's on the book of life amen now we believe a greater Revelation our names on the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah amen I'm just talking about just being saved sure right the three works of Grace you got to be saved Sanctified and then filled with the Holy Ghost amen and Luther brought brought out the great revelation of justification you're saved by grace through faith Hallelujah as Ephesians 2 8-10 says amen so it's no it's it's no work that youed to be saved Jesus Paid It all all to him I owe sin had left a Crimson Stain but Jesus washed it white as snow amen oh my thank God Hallelujah for the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and then you know so the the Lutheran Church has Revelation the Revelation is justification right but then uh John Wesley brought out the the revelation of the methods the Methodist the methods of living a dedicated life he believed you could dedicate your entire life and your entire life would be set up apart for God Hallelujah in other words we we we could we could uh grow in Grace and knowledge of the lord we could live a more holy life Hallelujah and he was right we could and he developed methods or habits and uh ways to to live a more Godly life and and brother Braham calls that the Bible calls it sanctification praise God I don't know if you saw it this week but it's really sad you know um the majority of United Methodist churches now lifted the ban on homosexual clergy yeah so now it's okay in Methodist churches for homosexuals to preach from their pulpits that would anger John Wesley if he was alive today amen because it's an Abomination he preached against it Martin Luther preached against it now what was interesting was a fourth of the Methodist churches have left their denomination so thank God for that forth they got enough Revelation to to leave based upon that but that this is a great Revelation justification you must be Sanctified and then you know through uh through Aus stre in 1906 they taught you had to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now they were right in one way but they were wrong in another way you know at the beginning in 1906 they said you had to speak in tongues now just so you know by the end of that movement William Seymour he was the man that God used to start it and he was praying six to eight hours a day before the Holy Ghost fell and started that Revival I just want to tell you what a godly man he was brother Brandon honor of that man William Seymour he was blinded in one eye but God used him in a mighty way brother Bram said 1906 Revival Inus stre was the greatest Revival since the day of Pentecost and the church said now at the beginning they believ tongues were the evidence but by the end they'd have all these they had all these tests and trials by the end he realized it's not the tongues that are the evidence it's a Christ centered life that's the evidence amen hallelujah and then brother brandom comes and he says that's the same thing the evidence is uh living recognizing the day your day and it's message recognizing the message of the hour and of course that means living all the word of God because we all know I know you might not but I know a lot of people that have spoken tongues that don't serve God anymore well that that's impossible if if tongues is the evidence then uh then anyone that spoke in tongues would always serve God Faithfully they would not transgress they wouldn't leave the way of Salvation right they wouldn't leave the way of righteousness so just in those examp ex that proves tongues are not the evidence and Paul said do all speak with tongues in 2 Corinthians 12:31 I believe it is is it if I'm not mistaken you know tongues cannot be evidence it's a gift but brother R tells us we can't seek the gift we got to seek The Giver of the gifts hallelujah amen that's what we need Hallelujah that's what we're seeking and if you've been born again then you just want more of God hallelujah but if you haven't been born again you must seek the Holy Ghost you must you must seek The Giver of the gift Hallelujah a personal experience with Christ Hallelujah where you know Christ's power entered into your life amen hallelujah that's what we all must seek for by God's grace you must be born again as Jesus said Hallelujah if you want the kingdom of God in you you must be born again Hallelujah but now getting back to this thought brother BR says the seventh angel winds up all the Mysteries that are laying loose here and so we have justification we have sanctification and we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'll say like this we have the gifts in the right place too that's what we're that's what you're learning that's what we're learning tongues can be a part of it but tongues have to obey the rest of the Bible commands praise the Lord amen and uh we we we take all these all the Bible must be tied together praise God brother Ram's Ministry was to finish the mystery of God any anything that was a Myster in the word of God that was called a mystery it should be explained today it should be revealed today I want to tell you it is by God's grace Hallelujah absolutely thank you Lord now after you notice you know I want to just point out uh Revelation 10 ver1 the mighty Angel comes down and he's clothed with a cloud the rainbow is on his head his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire brother Ram tells us this is Christ Christ comes down in a theophany or a spiritual body or Christ comes down in a Angelic form which is a theophany body Hallelujah and he has that little book open in his hand and brother Ram tells us that was the Revelation the book that was in heaven Jesus Took the book he broke the seals and he comes down and he has a open book like all you got your open Bibles right now I love that amen that's what Jesus brought down an open book and brother Ram tells us that was the revelation of the Seven Seals and I preach it here to you by God's grace so we got the tape on that if you want to listen to that again and when he when he uttered when he come down he cried as when a lion Roth and seven Thunders utter their voices brother Ram plainly says two or three times he says the voices of the Thunders were the revelations of the Seven Seals so when brother random preached that first seal that was the Thunder that was the voice of God telling us what the first seal meant and then when he preached the second seal the next night in March of 1963 that was the second Thunder and then the third Thunder was the third seal and the fourth Thunder was the fourth seal how many remember that a little bit anybody got a little been a while I know that's been a while I think it was last summer you got a good memory if you remember some of that by God's grace then the fourth seal was the fourth Thunder the fifth Thunder sixth Thunder seventh Thunder and then that is what and and and then that's what we we come to you know John's not allowed to write those Revelations because they had to be revealed in the days of the seventh angel Hallelujah and once that was revealed verse 8 says John takes the book and he o and he has to eat it in verse n the angel says give me the little book take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and thy mouth sweet as honey this is the same thing God told Ezekiel God revealed to Ezekiel all these things about the four beasts in heaven Ezekiel chapter 1 and 2 and God told Ezekiel eat the book so you can prophesy again hallelujah amen and the same thing repeats here at the end God gives an open book to a prophet hallelujah amen hallelujah and he he sounds the mystery of God and now it's us it's it's John John is the type of the Bride Hallelujah the eagle anointing amen the eagle Age The Prophet age Hallelujah and John is the type of us we're supposed to eat the book it's bitter in our bellies it's it's hard to live sometimes it's hard to face rejection sometimes but we're praying Hallelujah you keep praying Hallelujah we we've we've had some great victories but we had some great rejections as well right it's it's like brother Howard said it's it's so wonderful it just flows off your lips this is like honey oh the Bible's restored we know Jesus Christ God sent us a prophet we know the right water baptism we know God's one person we know women should dress modestly and men should dress modestly and women shouldn't cut their hair and only men should preach the gospel and the Roman Catholic Church is the mother heart all these things flow off so easily but when it comes down to living it and standing for that it can be bitter in our stomachs praise God it's hard to face the rejection I'll say like this it takes a real battle to live all the word of God that we've heard amen because Satan is going to be battling on every side but that's okay God told us it was going to happen Peter said he's he Satan's going to come like like a roaring line he's not a roaring lion there's only one roaring lion Hallelujah that's Jesus amen hallelujah so nothing to fear Satan's just an imp personator brother he's just a bluff just stay with the word of God he's just trying to scare us he's just trying to shake us but the Bible said our kingdom cannot be shaken hallelujah amen Hebrews chapter 12 we have a kingdom which cannot be moved Hallelujah so we stand with the true line of the tribe of Judah the Lord Jesus Christ amen and then in verse 10 it says I took the little book out of the Angel's hand ate it up and was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter he said to me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues and kings and so this is something John did not do right so we know this this must be for someone else how is John GNA go prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and kings he wasn't he died of old age so e God wouldn't lie God wouldn't tell something wrong so this has to has a have to have a spiritual meaning God has to use someone else to do this praise the Lord now that's fitting to God did you know God did that before go to First Kings 19:15 God did this before First Kings 19:15 sister Ruth do you want to read verse 15 for us have you okay First Kings 19 yes First Kings 19:15 and the Lord said unto him go return on way to the Wilderness of [Music] anoint to be king over thank you now if you reading the scripture we're not going to take the time to do this because I just want to get to this point here God told Elijah now this is when Elijah is hiding in the cave brother Braham said that anointing left him that's why he was hiding in the cave just a few days before that he was he was so empowered he saw the fire come down from heaven consume the sacrifice he slayed 450 B prophets and that a powerful anointing left him all that boldness left him Jezebel said I'm going to kill you he ran from one woman brother said he just killed 450 prophets but then he runs from one woman because that powerful an that boldness of the Holy Spirit sometimes it leaves us right because we got to go through trials and then Elijah said God I'm the only one left just let me die God said I got 7,000 that haven't bowed their knees you don't want to die I'm going to take you home in a Rapture don't die amen you don't have to die Amen Hallelujah by God's grace there's going to be a generation that doesn't have to die Hallelujah it could be us amen hallelujah but if you read the Bible Second Kings we're not going to go there but just just hold your place in First Kings 19 but in 2 Kings 813 through1 15 it was Elisha that anointed haziel now think about that God told Elijah you're going to anoint haziel but then he doesn't do it Elisha does it now is God a liar no we would never blashe and say that but what does this show God H God hides the truth from the wise and prudent and reveals it unto babes such as would learn right God told Elijah you're going to do it but what he means is I'm going to have somebody with the same Spirit do it because I'm taking you home now that perfectly applies to Revelation 10 don't don't lose that thought you and I are the ones that are supposed to take the message to every Kindred tongue nation and people hallelujah in other words now it's your job to take it to the rest of the Amish who God is predestinated to receive it praise God I was ordained to take it to akan amen you're ordained to take it to your families your friends the people in your area praise God I think you guys told me one time there's over 300,000 Amish communities or I looked it up online and most of them haven't heard the message well guess what now that's your job to fill Revelation 10:11 Hallelujah amen how many how many believe they deserve a chance to hear the message somebody's got to somebody's got to tell them Hallelujah just like you got a chance to hear it God wants them to have a chance to hear it too in fact that's what Jesus said he said uh the kingdom of God must be preached to Every Nation Kindred people tongue and then the end will come the tribulation won't come the Rapture won't come until every group has heard this message that We Believe Hallelujah that's why you know next year is 60 years since brother man went off the scene that's a small amount of time in the eyes of God remember a thousand years is like one day with God it's only been two days since Jesus rose from the dead in God's eyes two days what was two days ago Sunday Friday what' you do Friday you probably can't remember what you did Friday I can't remember I went to work that's about all I did but in God's mind it was just two days ago in other words God is very patient he's outside of time and he's going to some people to share this message because it's scriptural it's got to be shared with those who haven't heard it praise God and then all the elect will come in but notice the point I want to make is God told Elijah to do it he didn't do it it was Elisha that did it so in other words this shows God can interpret his word any way he wants hallelujah amen Lord now uh Sister Sarah could you read verse 16 starts with and J it's in First Kings 19:16 and [Music] [Music] the wonderful thank you now ju was anointed by a son of a prophet in 2 Kings 91-113 it wasn't even Elisha it was a son of one of the prophets we don't even have his name so see God told Elijah you're going to do this but he himself didn't do it what he meant was the furtherance of the ministry hallelujah amen the furtherance of the ministry under the Same Spirit the holy spirit so that's why you and I can see ourselves in Revelation 10 Hallelujah brother brandom finished the mystery of God but now we must eat it and we must go take it to everyone that we can Hallelujah and as you know the internet does a good job of taking the message you know uh some preachers can't get into certain Muslim countries but Jesus uses using the internet or or either that or he'll show himself to them in dreams or visions I think I told you this story but I was in South America I preached uh there four times and a brother told me he was a brother he'd stand at the door and he would slap the wall I'm not going to slap these walls but when when the Holy Spirit was started moving he'd slap the the walls and when we're preaching he say that's solid brother that's solid he say bam bam bam bam bam that's solid everybody was you know getting all stirred up and everything and I was always wondering why would that brother be so stirred up and then I heard his testimony he was a Muslim never believed in Jesus brother Howard he was sitting in his he said the living room he was drunk and high smoking weed watching dirty movies I don't even know what kind of movies they were probably filthy he said all of a sudden he felt a holy presence on his left side he said he looked over there there was Jesus Christ shining in white he said he instantly fell to his knees and he was instantly sober and he wept his way to Calvary Hallelujah see if preachers can't get in one thing I tell you you can't stop Jesus from getting in you might stop a preacher amen but you ain't going to stop the Holy Ghost Hallelujah all the elect seed shall be harvested Hallelujah Jesus said all that the father has given me will come and I shall not lose one hallelujah amen and so then all he knows is Jesus is his savior he's repented he's got to leave the Muslim faith and so he goes to the nearest church it was a message church then he found his wife there they had a beautiful little family this is about uh now it's probably 11 years ago by God's grace maybe 12 I wonder what how their fam are I'm sure they're doing good by God's grace I have to asked brother Maxwell they're doing but see this this message has got to be preached to Every Nation if we believe the mystery of God is finished then we've got to share it praise God hallelujah now the only one now those thank you sisters you read three men's names right Azel juu and Elisha the only one that Elijah anointed was Elisha and that was in uh 2 Kings 9 15 a double portion came on Elisha and that meant he did double the Miracles how many know that Elisha did eight I'm sorry Elijah did eight Miracles Elisha did 16 Miracles how many know that so if you're if you ask God for a double portion that means I'm going to get double the work done and the church said amen you really pray that say God give me a double portion and you want to do double the work right Hallelujah now I hear people say it all the time give me a double portion they don't even know what they're talking about right if you're asking for a double portion if I'm asking for a double portion then I going to win twice as many souls or I'm going to baptize twice as many people or I want to preach twice as many sermons right that's what the double portion means you do double the work you do double the works for God Almighty so next time let's think and pray before we ask God for a double portion because you got to know what you're asking for and like our brother said then we got to be willing to sacrifice more the more we do for God means the more we sacrifice of our natural lives means less farming more studying preaching testifying right brother that's what God's doing in his life amen hallelujah that's right so now I I want to just lay that out because that's important for you to see you and I are in Revelation 10 brother brandham said Revelation 10:7 is history everybody say history ready history history brother Braham says it he said it and what is the attraction on the mountain 1965 you want to look it up he said That's History just a few months before he died in other words he knew God used him to tie all these Revelations together the gifts of the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my a justification sanctification the three works of Grace all the mysteries of God the Rapture I mean you just name it all these Revelations he tied them up he gave the right Revelation he said That's History right hallelujah amen he said in my ministry that's history so see church we are living in the days when the Bible's being fulfilled right we are right we are living in these days they're exciting days amen amen they're awful for the world but they're exciting to us hallelujah for those who we're in Christ Jesus so I hope you can see that now our responsibility as the bride type we're under the eagle anointing remember brother Ram said that's thus sayith the Lord remember that it was in the fifth seal brother Ram said those teachings on the four Beast remember there's four beasts around the throne let's read that Revelation chapter 4 I'll get the verse there I'm just revelation 4:7 there's four beasts they're called cherubims they're called beasts the first Beast was like a lion brother Ram said that was the boldness of the early church they were as bold as lions right one night remember in Acts chapter 3 they'd be arrested the next day they're bold as lions they're right back out in the public preaching not afraid to go to jail now how many people you know got that kind of boldness there's a few but that anointing was on all of them that was a lion anointing the boldness the power of the original Apostles the Bible said God gave them Great Signs wonders and miracles Hallelujah and the second beast was like a calf brother random said that was the anointing of sacrifice where the Christians freely gave themselves as Martyrs Hallelujah and if you if you haven't read this read the church age book it'll give you a great understanding on this and listen to the seven seal sermons and brother said what else could they do he said what else could they do but just give their lives freely because that's the anointing that they lived under you know like a sister like our sisters you can only live under the anointing for a sister you can't be a man you don't want to be a man God made you a woman right and brothers you can only live under anointing of a man and that's how it is with the Christians we can only live under the anointing that God's given us praise God God didn't give us the lon anointing uh the calf anointing the next one is a face as a man brother R said this was the wisdom of men like Martin Luther and John Wesley and uh George Whitfield and all these uh mighty intelligent Men He names them in the church age book as well uh Albert Barnes uh there's some so many other names like they're not coming to right now but he said they wrote the most books about God they preached the greatest sermons that was ever preached because they had the wisdom of man brother BR said Martin Luther had the wisdom to know that wafer that wafer of bre that the Catholics hold up that's not the body of Christ brother raham said that that cup of wine that's not the blood of Christ he said the wisdom of God gave him that praise God Hallelujah the wisdom of God but now Church we're the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle and we're under the eagle anointing how many know the Bible said that God said I'll carry Israel out of Egypt on eagles's wings how many remember that verse how did he carry him out On Eagle's Wings one was Moses one was Aaron Hallelujah I'll carry out on Eagle wings that's what the Bible said God delivered by Mo prophet and Aaron priest prophet and priesthood prophet and Ministry Hallelujah that's what we're carried out on brother Rams as a prophet and the ministry the fivefold ministry praise God carries us out didn't you know Aaron had four Sons Aaron plus his four Sons five five full ministry anybody know that yeah now remember two of them died because they tried to transgress but it was a type at the beginning it was a type you have Aaron and then his four sons and you have the prophet guiding them too that's what we have brother random and the fivefold ministry that what that's what leads us and don't forget church uh we're under five blessings from the five full Ministries so go back to Ephesians four I want to pull this out by God's grace because because you all here are led by the Holy Ghost you accept the fightful ministry remember there's churches that don't they say press play and Obey that's a lie brother Ram never told us to just press play and Obey and not have living preachers so you're under the right anointing today Hallelujah stay under that anointing there's a big deception in the land with brother Ram's family members trying to get everybody to shut down the preachers that's a lie from Hell brother Ram never said to do that the Bible never says that's the main thing the Bible never says to do that Hallelujah and I've called all the ones that will contact me I've sent them letters I sent them videos I've sent videos to brium Tabernacle books to Brom Tabernacle and they have no answers all they can do is a few quotes that they're misrepresenting they don't have any Bible to support their their teachings they try to twist some scriptures but it goes against everything the prophet of God taught now verse 11 and he gave some apostles those are missionaries and some prophets those those are revealers of Secrets and those who prophesy like brother brandom and some evangelist evangelists uh just go around from church to church and they uh they they s the people up and set them on fire and do Supernatural signs wonders and miracles pastors are of course Shepherds they stay home with the the Sheep most of the time and then there's teachers teachers can take you deeper in the word of God and give you instruction on the word of God how to do this how to do that how to understand that how to do that now what does this do church this perfects verse 12 perfects the Saints which is equipping you in other words when you feed on the fivefold ministry you'll have the tools you need to live a Christian life I've seen it for all these years Brother anytime I need something brother irin God will send anytime I'm in a struggle God will send a preacher in at the right time Hallelujah and that'll be just exactly what we need to hear I've heard it countless times in my in my 18 years as past I've so many times people come up and say wow brother Jesse thanks for having that preacher that was just what I need to hear or somebody send me a text say that was just what I was wondering about that was just what I needed to hear that's what God promised hallelujah amen it perfects the Saints it equips you it works the ministry right it gives it labor it helps it the ministry to keep going edify third edifies is the body of Christ that means to build you up how many you want to be stronger when you leave this place that's what the Holy Ghost will do through right preachers Hallelujah the right kind of preachers will make you stronger because they're pointing you to the word of God hallelujah and then verse 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith see we'll be unified on the major doctrines brother R says there's majors and minors that's true brother R said in I forget the sermon maybe it'll come to me while I'm preaching brother said there was a man that said uh brother BR I differ with you he said I believe Jesus is coming back on the White Cloud and brother Ram said another man said I believe he's coming on a white horse and brother R said that's fine whether he's coming on a white cloud or a white horse he said that's a minor thing as long as we believe he's coming hallelujah amen hallelujah he said but the major thing is salvation getting people saved helping them to miss hell Hallelujah he said that's the the major we can't miss that and brother Bram said I'm not trusting in my merits to go to heaven brother Bram said I'm not trusting in the merits because I'm a Pentecostal preacher I'm going to heaven he said I have no merits that I can trust in to go to heaven the only merits I have is the merits of Jesus Christ Hallelujah am Glory now I know all of you most of you came out of churches that they made your merits a thick book outside the Bible that was your Merit and they said if you broke any of these you're lost and going to hell that's a lie that's a lie I'm going to say one more time that's a lie Hallelujah you're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you're not saved by works or else then you can brag in heaven you're saved by grace through faith it is the gift of God hallelujah so see brother Irvin as you as you'll see too and I'm sure as you've heard with different preachers well brother Jeff might preach a little different than brother Jesse brother Jesse might have been preached different than brother Simon and we're brothers but on on the on all of them I believe this they're just minors the majors we all agree on what am I talking about the Holy Ghost is bringing us to a Unity of the faith Hallelujah am that's right I and my wife and I talk about this we all talk about it at our church too you know as we go along we just see we see what looks like more differences with other message churches but that that's only when we stop looking at all the similarities that we have right absolutely we all believe in modesty we all believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost salvation we all believe in the operation of gifts right we all believe brother R was a prophet and the Seven SE we all believe on the church ages we have so many things that are in common we got to be careful the devil wants to try to get in there and makes roots of bitterness among us we've got to stop Satan at that we can't let Satan create roots of bitterness Among Us now here's how you know go to uh wait did I finish this no I didn't finish this then we'll go to 1 Timothy 2 but till we all come in the unity of Faith so that's what I see I've been in the message what I say 23 23 years that's what I see the more I'm in it the more unified I am with other believers that believe the same thing Hallelujah that's what you'll see as well and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect that means a mature man it doesn't mean you're going to get to a spot where you never sinned brother Ram said you'll fight against the devil all the days of your life right you won't the only time you get a victory is when you get a brand new body Hallelujah unto the measure of the stature of Christ and then verse 14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive now think about that most churches are filled with preachers that are trying to deceive people and know giving them money or joining their church but the real five-fold Ministry won't try to deceive you the real five-fold ministry will try to unite you around the revealed word of God the true Revelation from Jesus Christ amen but false preachers are trying to get you to go from Doctrine to Doctrine to a different idea to different idea to this idea we never heard brother I've never said it like this but oh it's some different revelation that's not what the fivefold ministry does the fivefold ministry brings you maturity it edifies you it builds you up it brings Unity Hallelujah it brings a Perfection to the Saints ah Hallelujah I'm feeling good today hallelujah how you feeling everybody feeling good glory I feel free I always feel free when I come here hallelujah see the true Holy Ghost will give us the right Doctrine it also give us the right uh Revelations too let me share this nice little testimony we had this was uh back in March back in March there's a brother who lives in Illinois and he came down two years ago to visit us he he was a six 78y old man I think he's 80 now 70 year old man drives all the way from Illinois northern Illinois come down to our little church and he said you're my home church because I don't have a message Church where I'm at so he sends us his ties because he don't have a home Church he comes down he spends the weekend with us he's like oh I love your son Malachi you guys are my home Church well fast forward you know early this year he text me and said I'm dying the doctor said this is it he said thanks for being a a wonderful brother brother Jesse you know he sent me just a text I'm like I'm trying to stop my tears from coming I'm like does this have to be the time he goes I said brother we're going to pray for you we're going to pray so I I texted the Saints and I said just pray for brother Phil you know they met him one time we only met him one time so I said said uh you know if you feel led fast pray for this brother his uh he had infections in his blood he had kidney infection kidney failure his urine was infected his blood sugar had spiked he had high blood pressure he and the doctor said this is it this is it and so we just prayed we just trusted God and then on Wednesday that following Wednesday night we're going to church and I got a voicemail from him I thought it maybe might be his wife maybe it said that he passed away or something I couldn't listen to it because I was on the way to church and I then I forgot cuz I was getting ready to preach but I listened to it after church and he said brother Jesse he said tell your church that God change God heard your prayer and that prayer changes things that's what brother Ram taught us Prayer Changes Things he said he listed eight things God healed him from he said I I was totally dizzy he said God took away my dizziness he said my blood was infected now the infections gone he said I had a kidney infection and kidney failure the kidney infection is gone he said my urine was infected he said now my urine's cleaned out he said my blood sugar is back to normal my blood pressure is back to normal all my bed sores are healed up and an ultrasound revealed another healing but then the the voicemail called it cut off there I told the church look at that God eight is the number of Eternity amen so God just set down he put a little eternity in his body amen hallelujah and it was just simple you know prayer death death was knocking at the door but when the saints pray God hears the Saints Hallelujah I just want to encourage you no no matter how Bleak it looks and and yes there are times God you know God would take people home right we know God takes people home at times but I just want to encourage you you can be standing right there at desk door but Jesus might close that door hallelujah amen keep praying to God all things are possible to them that believe hallelujah amen now he's in a rehab place with his wife he said oh everything's back to normal by God's grace I thought he was dying I thought we're losing him God is able to change the situation praise God now we all come in the unity of faith and so see the the the the the fightful ministry Ephesians 4:14 will make us mature adults in the faith not just little kids kids right we don't want to be little kids what do little kids do I'm I'm around little kids all the day I teach first grade I got a lot I got 20 years of experience with little kids what do they do whe they're happy for a while but as soon as one of them crosses another they just turn on each other they hate each other argue and cry and scream and that's what they at least in my classes maybe you all got better classes but see they're they're babies you know no not babies but they're immature they let little things upset well one day we're BFFs and the next day we're no longer friends and then the next day we're back to BFF fffs right and it's just back and forth but God doesn't want immature Christians God wants mature Christians praise God right in other words like a mature Christian you know a preacher and I brother irin and I or brother Simon and I we may differ on something but we're still Brothers right brother Ram said you ought to be able to sit down with someone he said you bitterly disagree with and tell them the very convictions of your heart but when you're done he said if your brothers Shake hand and hug each other around the neck and say how much you love them think about what would you bitterly disagree with someone on brother said that's what a Christian can do why because we're not little children we're mature Christians by God's grace amen amen I I don't think it hurt to say this you know there are certain things I disagree with on my own brothers that we talked about it they they believe the seven Thunders are going to be in the future I believe as I told you I believe they're already uttered but you know what they're still my brothers right and I know this too if I'm seeking the Holy Ghost every day like brother John said if we're praying as a family together and we're seeking more of God then if if the Thunders will be in the future I'm the one that's going to get it too right amen because I want more of God to I want all that God has for me how many want more all that God has for you so see I know either way either way and even Church even like this to me it's a minor anyway because I know as long as my soul has the baptism of the Holy Ghost then I will go out to meet the bridegroom amen Matthew 25 amen as long as I've got the oil as long as I've got the Holy Ghost I will go out to meet Christ hallelujah amen see that's what it's all about Mak sure you're born again and then Jesus said in John 16:13 he'll guide me into all truth hallelujah in other words all the truth that I need to live a Godly Christian Life God is going to reveal to me praise God thank you think about this thought now brother brother irin mentioned John 21 I think it's in that same chapter where all there was a saying amongst the apostles and the disciples that John was not going to die until they saw Jesus come back how many remember that church how many of those disciples did you think disagreed on that and yet God let them all die going down to the Grave thinking oh I wish I could live as long as John is then I'll go in the Rapture then I'll see Jesus and church now apply that to brother Ram brother Ram thought 1977 would be the end of it God let him pass away God take him home letting him have these just human thoughts his own opinions his own convictions right God's a God in Mercy everybody understand what I'm saying you know guiding us into all truth doesn't mean you know we're going to understand and know every single thing but it means having the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Bible said having all things there it is all things that pertain unto life and godliness amen there it is let's read that amen oh that was fresh Hallelujah let me look that up all things that pertain uh 1 Peter 13 there there it is that's it right there Hallelujah that's from the Holy Spirit I believe just inspiration while I'm preaching here uh second Peter 1:3 I'm sorry second Peter 13 and then we'll go to 1 Timothy 2 I just read that this morning I thought it be a help to you by God's grace second Peter 13 2 Peter 13 brother John when you get that would you read that for us brother uh just verse 3 2 Peter 1:3 according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness and through the knowledge through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue amen how many things does he give us all things amen anything we need on this Earthly Journey For Life and godliness he's given it to us so when Jesus said the Holy Ghost will guide you into all truth that's what he means everything you need for this Earthly Journey God has richly supplied it amen it's exactly right right so now go to First Timothy 2 I just think I'll would go there uh I just saw these scriptures this morning let me see I got to find the verse here I'm sorry second Timothy 2 I'm sorry second Timothy 2 my fault pardon me second Timothy 2 yes that's right that's right verse 14 2 Timothy 2:14 that's where I wanted to show of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord a charging means to solemnly affirm or give them a charge give them a a testimony give them uh yeah testimony to attest to cause cause them to believe so cause them to believe before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit now I've seen this over the years brother Iran you know brother John people will come in and they'll try to just bring up a topic that it really isn't going to profit us anything one way or the other right and so we got to be careful not to go down rabbit Trails or subjects that are are not going to help us be more Godly there's got to be something important that comes out of this Hallelujah like I'll give you some examples like recently people have been emailing me saying you know um was brother brandom's mom actually half Cherokee or half whatever and to me this this is this is that scripture I'm not going to strive with them about this topic because it doesn't it doesn't bring any profit to my walk with God it it doesn't I want to preach God's word I only have so much time another one is you know somebody said well did Brother Ram travel around the world seven times or was it four and to me I'm like it doesn't really matter I'm not going to spend my time striving on that I can't even I can't go back and prove it to you anyway like you can't prove what you're right I can't prove I'm right and what they're trying to do is they're trying to discredit God's profit shame on them Hallelujah but what the real five-fold Ministry does is point to us to the scripture to what the Holy Spirit wants to make real in our lives that will help us grow help us edify help us to be built up in the gospel how many know the gospel means good news when you heard brother's message you heard the good news of God hallelujah amen I know I did amen hallelujah verse 15 is where irin and me the preachers study to show thy self approved unto brother irin this helped me one time the Holy Spirit revealed this unto me unto God in other words we study and we make sure God approves of my sermon before I come out and preach it it's a big difference some people want to study so their Church approves of it that's what you all came out of we're studying so that God approves of the message amen hallelujah and you got to work at it it's a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed he rightly divides the word of truth that means to cut straight he cuts that sacrifice straight he makes a straight understanding a clear distinction am a clear distinction between good and evil Hallelujah clear understanding this is clearly the Bible truth this is clearly a true Doctrine this is a straight life this is a narrow walk amen rightly dividing the word of truth that also means brother we got to cut out any false doctrines cut that out right we got to cut out uh we got to cut out uh words that strive about to no profit got to say dear brother dear sister let's not focus on that there's no way for us to prove it we got to wait till we find out in heaven but really when we're in heaven we're probably going to care anyway I don't know about you but I'm going to be caring about Jesus in heaven I'm a going to be trying to figure out how much DNA of that person how much DNA I'm going to be saying I'm just saying where's Jesus let me worship him praise God I want to see the one that died for me Hallelujah that's what I'm going to be worried about in heaven amen where's the Savior where's where's my Lord where's the one I live for my whole life where's the one I preach about all these years let me see Jesus hallelujah hallelujah verse 16 but shun profane and vain babblings that's what a lot of people do just Babble today empty discussions useless matters where is this taking us right I'm talking about people that take away not here but people that take try to take you away from the word of God and now for us usually it's centered around brother brandom you know or the the preaching that he gave us for they now here's here's the key here's what I want to bring up and they will increase unto more what un godliness so the people that are going to be trying to distract us from the word of God are going to be living more worldly all the time and brother Ray brother Irvin I've seen it since this big move in 2012 where people are leaving the message at first they respected brother Brandon but now it's been uh 12 years now they just flat out ridicule him call him names and I I listen because I I know I I want to know what I'm talking about when I preach I record there just like they're watching mine I'm watching you too oh I'm watching your brother Jesse well I'm watching you too I'm going to call you out too and at first they uh they were very very respectful but now they say uh it's okay to get tattoos it's okay to open up uh tattoo parlors even one of the main leaders now says it's okay to have non-binary relationships like I I didn't even know what that meant I had to go look it up it non-binary means well one day I'm a man so I'm going to look for a woman relationship well next I might be a woman I'm going look for a man for a relationship that's what it means this perversion and what the Bible Years brother Daniel first they were so nice to brother brand so nice and now they're just increasing to more and more ungodliness a true child of God would never swallow down the LIE of a nonbinary relationship that's perversion that's confusion that's the spirit of confusion and then now they can say oh yeah we can listen to rock and roll now Bon Joi and ACDC and oh now it's not the devil they they say now oh the devil's not behind that now it's just artwork it's just expression it's the expression of the Devils it's very easy and I I know they're going to listen to this they'll probably email me on this fine go ahead and email me I'll probably delete it you know maybe not it depends what kind of spirit they come in because Jesus said at some point let the blind lead the blind right because they both fall into a ditch and that's just some of them Church there are so many more oh yeah and women can cut their hair but the Bible says you do that it's a dishonor you know what that word means in the Greek you know what it means repulsive that's what the word dishonor means in the Greek look it up it's a repulse like you know you see something disgusting it repulses you right that's what it is for a woman to cut her hair or a man to grow out his hair uncut it's a repulse and they allow their women to cut their hair now and wear makeup and wear pants right and they they say we're free no we're free Hallelujah you're deceived amen you're chained up the Bible say it's like a dog that goes back to its vomit it's like a pig that goes back to its wallow am that's what's happening and the Bible said they'd argue about all these little minor things and their lives will get increasingly more ungodly but our lives should be getting more holy hallelujah how many appreciate the Holiness of the Holy Spirit praise God how many know you're living a more holy life now than your previous church amen hallelujah I know that's a reality Hallelujah that's why I love this message amen look at verse 17 now here's one prime example and their word will eat as that a canker so all these arguments about these little things that don't matter it don't help you live a better Christian Life will eat like a canker a canker is like a flesh eating disease it's Gang Green how many know Gang Green in the Vietnam War they used to get gang green it would eat up their body parts and slowly eat away their bones until they have to have cut off right if you got Gang Green you have to amputate the arm and the Holy Ghost says that's what these false ideas are and this these vain uh vain arguments thank you sir God bless you God will reward you for that every every cup of water in the name of Jesus gets a reward I always tell him that he's going to have good reward Hallelujah all these vein babblings these profane shun things they're arguing about taking trying to get people away from the word of God it will eat like a cancer till the body starts missing parts until they're no longer recognizable they look like a different person and that's what we've seen these people that leave the message they're different people now right they're not the same people they're missing some of what they used to be they used to be sweet and humble but now they're prideful and arrogant and aggressive what happened they had some spiritual amputations done the devil's eating eating away all their all their testimony all their love for God he's eating it away of whom is hus and philus who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection has passed already overthrowing the faith of some now look Paul gives a specific example hus and uh felus were saying oh the rapture's already happened guys just enjoy life the rapture's already happened we're in the Millennium right now or we're in the tribulation right now this Ain nothing read read about the seven trumpets to Israel brother said those seven trumpets are not for the Gentiles that's for the time of the Israel not on Israel but to judge all the the world where while God is saving Israel but look at that Paul said when when someone would say all the Rapture already happened it's a gang green that overthrows people's Faith see they're no longer having faith for Jesus is coming back Jesus is coming back and these lies have overthrown their faith and they spiritually think about that their spiritual amputees coming to church without hands no wonder they can't worship God like they ought to no wonder they can't walk straight you they just hop around the church you or they they wobble around the church they're spiritual ues they can't walk the way they're supposed to walk they can't move their hands they don't they're not they're not a real living Christian because they've accepted false doctrines that's why it's so important to have the Holy Ghost to know know the truth the truth shall set us free Hallelujah now I'm going to list some of these major ones around the message just so you're aware brother irin and all the saints some of these false caners are the tape Church worship press play and Obey which say preacher sit down just play brother R's tapes that's a canker that destroys the faith of many that's right there's another uh false Doctrine the return Ministry brother Ram has to come back and physically preach us into Rapture condition that's a lie brother R's going to come back but it's going to be when the dead in Christ rise first amen hallelujah in other words we'll see Paul we'll see Peter we'll see brother brandham and the Rapture just any moment Hallelujah that that's right another one is we're in the Millennium there's a actually a Ohio Church down near Dayton that believes that and they've got the eighth messenger and they're in the Millennium what a bunch of nonsense and they got false Doctrine in there you they got adulteries all kind of money issues and thefts and all kinds of things like that see every false Doctrine will produce this spiritual canker because false Doctrine is like leaven A little leaven leavens the whole lump if it's not cut out amen by a preacher that can rightly divide the word of truth if it's not cut out it'll make the whole church full of sin that's why you ought to Rejoice if your church is still walking holy after one year right April was the one year anniversary of when you started the church right if you're a year gone and there's no le in church you ought to say praise the Lord hallelujah amen our church will be 18 years next month and by God's grace all the leavens out we're a unleavened loaf hallelujah we're unleavened uh article of God's bread all the sin has been kept out that's a miracle of the Holy Spirit praise God that's the work of Christ in the fivefold ministry Hallelujah another one is polygamy a lot of people misunderstand marriage and divorce because they don't listen to brother an's other tapes and so they allow men to marry two three four five wives it's sin it's wickedness it's mostly in Africa but there are some in America that's another uh canker Doctrine here's another one that's more close to us dead worship preachers don't want people screaming they don't want people dancing they don't want people shouting they don't want people crying that's a canker the Bible says quench not the holy spirit amen amen hallelujah that's right amen somebody clap Hall clap don't shut it off if you feel God the Bible say the Holy Ghost is like a Living Waters boiling up in you if you feel it boiling up don't shut it off Let It Go worship God give God praise praise Hallelujah and that might set somebody else free Glory that might help somebody else get in the holy spirit amen you know that's how it is church you know it takes somebody to start getting free that everybody else feels oh now I can stand or now I can clap or now I can dance it's always like that I've been a pastor for 18 years it's always been like that it takes somebody's got to let that living water flow not hey stop stop Holy Spirit stop no Let It Go just praise God just sing just clap just Rejoice whatever you got to do just worship God hallelujah amen I still dance we just danced last Saturday night you know I always laugh laugh with all you when I preach on Dancing here it was out in your garage I danced around here I had to make sure I didn't hit my head on that uh garage door thing I just want to be free I don't want the devil to take my worship but they'll say oh that's just Wildfire something like that they'll use these quotes the wrong way no church we don't have Wildfire we have the real fire of God I've got the real fire of God I've got a living fire burning in my life how many got a burning desire to love Jesus Christ you got the fire amen don't let that fire go out amen don't let somebody stifle that don't let somebody quench that let the fire of God consume all your worries consume all your doubts Let the Fire of God consume all that and and worship God the way he deserves to be worshiped amen hallelujah some people baptize in brother Ram's name that's a sin that's a lie that's idolatry that's a heresy and there's so many other more those are just a few examples now the one that's going to probably impact us the most is the one about worship we got to make sure we're free in the Holy Spirit right that at least that's what I've seen in Ohio brother brother Irvin now the reason I say that is because when I when brother Isaiah was my pastor Irvin he met with another Pastor in Lima who's no longer in the message and that Pastor made fun of his worship and his dancing and his praising God and His crying and shouting and rejoicing and brother Rooks preached at our church the in 2007 he said he didn't name the name but he said that man's going to fall and he fell uh would have been 6 years later he fell he left the message now he he he uh reviles brother Brandon and see brother Brooks knew it because the Holy Spirit won't make fun of the Holy Spirit if the holy spirit danc in David the Holy Spirit would dance in us hallelujah when it's time to dance it don't isn't always time to dance sometimes it's time to mourn but there are times it's time to dance Hallelujah we danced around the church last Saturday night brother Brooks was there that's right yeah we had a good time in the Lord yes it worked perfectly Hallelujah that worked out really good there but see that's just a great example there and that's kind of in this area of the North in in the United States now not so much in Africa we have saints that our church that used to go to Africa they dance every service for an hour we usually have a 30 minute song service right they're used to an hourong service all dancing they got the men on this side they're going they got the women on this side they're going right I don't know I can't dance like a woman I just dance like a man you know and that's what they're used to so when they come to America they're like where's all the joy where's all the dancing well you can find at our church praise God hallelujah and they want to find it at your church hallelujah mean they how how could they dance under the blood of bulls and goats but yet we can't dance under the blood of Jesus Christ which speaketh better things and that of Abel hallelujah oh my the Forgiveness of the blood of Jesus Christ is total complete Perfection hallelujah oh my thank God for his Mercy thank God for his grace I feel like dancing today praise God I like that Jesus rules he rules our life right there amen he rules our dance he rules our services amen am that's what's going to probably affect us here in Ohio is false doctrines like that probably not the tape church but I'm saying something I'm saying because that's kind of in Ohio that spirit is in in Ohio so we want to have the freedom and the liberty of the Holy Spirit now I understand there's a time right I understand you know tongues are not supposed to inter interrupt the preaching I understand that but there's also the aspect where a church is growing and so I I we've had this happen in our church I think three or four times now A a person has spoken in tongues and maybe it wasn't right at the exact right time I that's I said that's okay let's just pray for a few minutes and see if we get the interpretation well in each case the interpretation never came but I never bash the church for that brother R said if a if if your little baby's trying to talk these little todders are trying to talk and they don't say the word right they brother you're not going to smack them and say say the word right they're just learning how to talk brother said that's how it is with gifts you're just learning how to use the gifts you're just learning how to speak in tongues you're just learning how to you know have M gift of Miracles get the prophecy you're just learning in other words you just said at the wrong time but just pray next time and maybe God will help you be a little more mature and you'll say it at the right time praise God hallelujah Glory all right well this is turning out a lot different than I thought by God's grace so praise the Lord how many love the Lord today that's my way to kind of reset I try to find a place to close up here by God's Grace it's our 11:20 now I want to say this Revelation 10:7 the seventh angel is the same angel of Revelation 3:14 so let's go to Revelation 3:14 if you have your Bibles there good job good job good job buddy Ma's holding the baby what a good worker there boy that guy's a real good worker sister Miram do you want to read that when you get it Rev 3:14 brother R said Revelation 10:7 the seventh angel is the same Angel of the seventh letter the letter to the leans and that's true it is so whenever you want to read that [Music] sister amen amen hallelujah now we can clearly see how these seventh angels are the same angel here's three proofs think about this church why would God tell John to write a letter to an angel I mean I mean I'm talking about a Heavenly Angel does that make any sense to anybody has anyone ever seen that in the Bible how does a Heavenly Angel need a letter from a man when was the last time you wrote a letter to an angel did you ever write a letter to an angel could anybody think of a time in the Bible where a human had to write a letter so a Heavenly Angel could understand it no because when God want to talk to an angel he just says Angel come here wormwood come here Gabriel Michael come here right so that's that's the proof that this Angel to the Le ofans was a a man it's a preacher because God never tells men to write letters to angels and I got a little hunch here if you're writing letters to Angels I think it's the wrong Angel right the Fallen Angels you're trying to right from God to Angels I think you're under the wrong wrong Spirit there I think you're under the Fallen Angels a second reason David and Paul were called angels in the scripture how many know that anybody ever see those verses before okay let's let's read those that'd be good uh uh go to 1st Samuel 299 sister Ruth why don't you get that 1st Samuel 299 now how how many what the word angel means does anybody know just means messenger messenger that's all it means right because that's what an angel is it's a messenger from God but men are often called angels in the Bible too what is it it's God hiding a mystery remember the Seven Stars and the Seven candlesticks they're called a mystery in Revelation chapter 1 this is a mystery God's hiding it from the denominations revealing it to the bride so sister when you're ready uh 1st Samuel 29:9 and answered and said to David I know that thou good in my sight as an angel of God notand the of philes have said he shall not up with us to the battle amen how many can say Amen to that amen David is called an angel he's like a messenger from God now next one is Galatians 4:14 Sister Sarah do you want to read that Galatians 4:14 reive amen let's say Amen to that amen so Paul and David were called Angels Messengers Hallelujah and then remember John the Baptist is called an I'm sorry messenger of the Covenant so we know John the Baptist would have been as an angel in the sight of God as well not a spiritual Angel but a human Messenger right okay so can everybody see that now you know that now brother B taught that it's in the church Age series because he dealt with the seven Church age Messengers or the seven angels to the seven churches all right everybody got that and then the other proof is the seventh angel of Revelation 10:7 he doesn't have a trumpet for judgment right the the other seven angel trumpets they all have trumpets so Revelation 10 is not a trumpet it's not a Heavenly angel with a trumpet it's a human Prophet it's a preacher who's finishing the mystery of God hallelujah if you want to see the seventh angel that has a trumpet that's Revelation 11:15 let's read that uh sister ly you want to get that Revelation 11:15 whenever you're ready and the seventh angels and there was great was it in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall re forever and ever all right praise God so when that seventh trumpet sounds the day of man is ended and the day of the Lord Has Come brother said the day of the Lord starts when Jesus comes back at Armageddon because Jesus comes back he makes war with those Nations he destroys them all now it's the Lord's day it ain't man's day anymore it ain't China's day it ain't hamas's day it ain't America's day it's the Lord's Day Hallelujah and that Lord's day starts the Thousand Year period a day with the Lord is as what a thousand years he gets that seventh day honeymoon time amen honeymoon time for Christ in the bride amen glory so see there you got it by God's grace these wonderful Revelations hiding in there so Revelation 10:7 has to be a human preacher a human messenger who finishes the mystery of God and then the Saints eat it they eat the revelations it's sweet in their mouth but bitter in their belly and they got to go prophesy again to many nations Kindred people's tongues and that's what's happened for this last 60 years since brother bram's been off the scene preachers I know some of them have have uh traveled I know brother Maxwell the one from South America he has gotten in boats Saints when there's no more buses when there's no more roads he gets in a boat and go goes down the Amazon River to churches and makes new churches and brother Daniel all he does he just preaches the Lord Jesus Christ baptism and people will get saved and they'll start new message churches just down the river they they can't they don't have Wi-Fi that just a few years that was a couple years ago such remote areas but see what is brother what is his name is Maxwell Le what has that brother done Daniel he's eaten the book it's gone down into his belly and and now he's sharing the Prophecies of brother random he's prophesying again to many nations Kindred peoples and tongues hallelujah amen hallelujah see that's what's happening now so now can everybody see their place in the word of God your place is to grow up under the strength and the edification of the five full ministry and then when God uses you God's going to use you to witness this word to people that need to hear it like our sister I appreciate that testimony and brother what that's that's your greatest desire is to share the these prophecies share these words with other people is that right amen amen all right now few more things I want to say you remember brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time I think it was in 1961 and he saw all the Saints running to him his converts right and then brother brother Ram said brother B asked you know are all these AR are all these brandom they said no they're your converts and the people shouted uh we're so glad you went brother Brandon and uh the voice said you're going to have to be judged for what you preached how many remember what the voice said does anybody remember what the voice said the voice said the preacher will be judged by what he preached and brother ramam said well I preached what Paul preached he said and all those millions of converts shouted back we're resting on that amen so there's people in heaven right now that heard brother ROM preach and they're in heaven because brother Brandon preached what St Paul preached Hallelujah in other words the revelations of the Bible that Paul preached have been restored through brother R's Ministry and then brother random preached them they receiv received it brother BR says it's the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is there's one God there's three works of Grace the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seven Church ages amen Israel's blindness all these Revelations had to be restored so that we can understand the book we can be edified we can be a mature Christian body Hallelujah we don't become cankered Christians and uh you know lose lose our strength and lose our position but no we're strong healthy Christians we're like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water Hallelujah am meditating day and night on the word of God and the Bible said all that we do all that we do will prosper so brother Howard I see some good prospering going on here by God's grace and then you got those baby on the way you're really prospering brother Hallelujah by God's grace and everybody has a time and season we just had a friend that have been married 10 years they could never have children they just had their first child down there in Texas Randy and uh Lindsay for 10 years they went through all these struggles how am I going to we can never have children can we have children God God you hear our prayers the whole time God like yeah I heard your prayers there's just a certain time in season for it right God's not worried about anything God knows the test and trials God hears your prayer Saints matter how long you got to wait God hears your prayers he'll strengthen you so see the Believers in heaven they're resting on the fact that brother Randon preached us the revelations of the Bible Hallelujah now how many know that brother brandom has at least six thus sayith the Lords that came to pass prophecies the people that I made a video about it if you haven't seen it back in August the people that leave the message they say brother R never had one prophecy they said he never even had one what a lie right in 1958 brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord he told a woman you've got to desire in your heart to have a baby you can't have a baby you've come from Denver Colorado thus sayith the Lord go home and receive your child God will give it to you if you believe well guess what she had to wait 10 years but in 1968 she had her first babyy he said go home and believe he didn't say go home and wait 10 years he just said go home and believe now how many could have waited 10 years you could if you were Abraham's seed absolutely and this woman she she's still alive she only had one child that was the one child that one brother BR gave her thus say the Lord on wow now see these Liars they're lying say oh there's no prophecies they don't know the truth right brother random foretold the death of one woman her name was Florence sharen now all the preacher she had cancer all the preachers around Florence Shear were saying she's going to be healed but brother R said no I saw a vision it's thus sayi the Lord God's taken her home and guess what she passed away now someone might the the people will say well it's not hard to predict someone's going to die of cancer well I agree agree brother brandom agreed but the point that was made is that all the preachers were saying she was going to be healed brother brandom was the only one that was saying no she's going to go she's going to pass that's why that's an important prophecy brother brand said in 1965 anointed ones he said it's thus sayith the Lord them denominations will never break up they'll never come back to the word it's thus sayith the Lord they won't they'll go into the Antichrist that's fulfilled show me one denomination that's ever broken up and say we're no longer going to be methodists we're going to come back and be message Believers and believe all the Bible the exact opposite is what's happening now they're letting homosexuals preach to them praise God Amen fourth brother Ram said I see I see the church in America dancing to rock and roll I think I told you this one before right my mom was raised in the Assembly of God and my mom said they only played piano that was in the 50s and 60s she was born 1950 and she thought I never thought in uh uh 60 no it'd be 50 years later around the year 2000 my mom went to the Assembly of God conference the teen conference and where all the teenagers go and they try to make them like dedicate their lives to God and think they're saved a lot of times they're not and she said I saw rap there they were rapping about Jesus and then rock and roll came a few years later and now they have hard I mean just crazy Wicked Music and that's what brother r said brother said I saw the Church of United States dancing to rock and roll and the women were basically almost naked right and that's what we see in churches today brother Ram predicted it in 1965 thus sayith the Lord it came to pass how many are thankful for a prophet of God hallelujah amen my I told my mom I said Mom you she don't believe in brother brand but I said you've literally seen this come to pass mom I said mom please get out of the Assembly of God denomination and she's still in there but we're still praying by God's Grace it's up to God brother Ram said Just remember thus sayith the Lord there will never in no more Gentile Church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign to the church thus sayith the Lord what a statement Amen brother braham's sign was to have people come in the prayer lines you've read about it right you've listened to it and tell them all the secrets of their heart brother R said if anything Rises greater than this you can call me a false prophet thus sayith the Lord and nothing has even come close I met two people that came in the prayer lines and brother Ram didn't know them brother R told them the secrets of their heart they got well and uh of course there's other people that know many more right they they know more people than I do but I'm just a witness I met them it was Supernatural not only did he have the word he also had the gift of discernment praise God brother calls it the sign of the Messiah because that's what Jesus did Jesus discerned the thoughts of Nathaniel's heart I saw you under the fig tree before he called you John chapter 1 he told the woman at the well you're right you don't have a husband you've had five and the one you're living with is not your husband either she said I perceive you're a prophet hallelujah amen the sign of a messiah that's what brother R he told that woman uh Marilyn hickey's her name I see you can't have children you're from some mountainous area Denver thus say the Lord if you believe you'll have a baby 10 years later she had a baby Hallelujah that's the same Jesus from John chapter 1 and John chapter 4 how do you know cuz he preached the same word the same water baptism hope I'm not wearing you out today hope you feel good by God's grace look at this one brother said thus sayith the Lord this is the 1962 look what's happening down through the years she'll continue to strip herself he said that's thus sayith the Lord can't we all see women contining to strip themselves they got yoga pants and bikinis and even less than bikinis whatever they call those things brother R said it's thus saith the Lord and look how it come to pass brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord the United States will never rise again she'll never rise again that's thus sayith the Lord should never have another Revival come to pass not even close not even close brother said now watch He's here's here's the have eight on here sorry I said six but I put six on the video there's actually eight he said now watch following it there will come a time in the name of the Lord that people will go completely insane the Bible says so they'll scream and holler great hideous things in their imaginary mind it's because of the radios and things our television programs are producing it and the church said oh my goodness people will go completely insane isn't that what we see out there in the world in the news people have gone completely insane because of the TV shows they've watched the movies they've watched right mutilating children because they think they're a boy or a girl in complete Insanity right because of what they see on movies and things uh my niece one my my niece graduated high school a couple years ago she said her senior year they had to put kitty litter boxes in the bathroom because some of the girls thought they were cats I'm talking about 16 you know 15 16 17 18 year old girls that's the insanity and that was in a small farm town that wasn't a big city that was a small farm town told brother said thus sayith the Lord they'll go completely insane right and how about these people uh in America these college these college campuses the last two weeks have you seen it they're chanting death to America death to Israel and they let it go on unreal it's total insanity when I think there was 900 Graves on uh the Sands of e eima if I'm not mistaken in World War II 900 soldiers gave their lives so that we could be free and have religion and get away from tyranny right and all these evil communism all this communism 900 gave their lives on one Beach it's complete Insanity now they're enchanting death to Freedom see they're getting under the spirit of the end time for tribulation but we're getting under the spirit of the Holy Ghost for the Rapture Hallelujah that's the spirit we're under amen the spirit of the Rapture praise God right there is eight thus sayith the Lords now there's a brother in Connecticut he's got 10 thus sayith the Lords of just healings kind of like that that woman who got her baby after 10 years he's got at least 10 thus sayith the Lords that came to pass we've not been deceived God has sent us a prophet amut aren't you glad church but now whose job is it now he's off the scene what what's your job now eat the book eat the book win some souls for
