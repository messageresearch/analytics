Description:
Revelation chapters 2 and 3 are loaded with symbols and revelations we need to know, as Christ speaks directly to us about the spiritual conditions of our day in the Laodicean letter. Thankfully, we can now the meanings of the large number of symbols and revelations because God sent His prophet, William Branham, to give us the truth behind these chapters with the authority of "Thus saith the Lord"!
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] revelation chapters 2 & 3 the theme of both chapters is the spirits words of encouragement warning and rebuke to the seven Gentile churches please recall that the teaching on these chapters were thus saith the Lord according to God's prophet William Branham now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the Word of God and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the law the timing of events in these chapters are seen here as each of the seven churches was actually a specific time period each of the seven Gentile cities named by Christ had characteristics about it that were prophetic of the future years and ages that would continue until God was done dealing with the Gentile people for salvation Jesus spoke of this time period as the times of the Gentiles in Luke 21:24 the Gentiles are currently grafted into the life of God the Holy Ghost covenant as the Jews were broken off from the holy ghost' covenant when they rejected Christ as their Messiah see the entire chapter of Romans 11 Israel will be blind to Christ as their Messiah until the last Gentile believer is born into the body of Christ and then the 144,000 Israeli believers will be saved after recognizing Jesus Christ as their Messiah Redeemer and Lord the Ephesian Church age was from 53 to 170 AD and it's angel human messenger was Saint Paul the Sumerian church age was from 170 to 312 ad and it's messenger was Saint Irenaeus the pergamene church age was from 312 to 606 ad and it's messenger was Saint Martin the Thyatira in church aids was from 606 to 1520 ad and it's messenger was Saint Columba the sardian church age was from 1520 to 1750 ad and it's messenger was Martin Luther the Philadelphian church age was from 1750 to 1906 ad and it's messenger was John Wesley the Laodicean Church age was from 1906 to the current time AD and is still ongoing and it's messenger was William Branham the symbols and key revelations in these chapters are numerous so we will only have time to teach some of them we strongly encourage you to listen to or read the book an exposition of the seven church ages written by William Branham in 1965 this book covers all the symbols and key revelations from these two chapters we begin with the key revelation of the overcomers Jesus spoke directly to each Gentile age and admonished them to be overcomers or conquerors over Satan's false religions the overcomers are those who took Jesus's words of truth and live them overcoming the temptations of Satan the false prophet or Antichrist the Beast and even death and hell these overcomers are the called the chosen and the faithful they are the wife or bride of Jesus Christ every overcomer from every age will inherit all the same things meaning they will inherit all seven rewards that Jesus listed in each church age here are the rewards for the overcomers during the times of the Gentiles the reward of eating of the Tree of Life will be a spiritual partaking of the words of life for there is only one life and that is eternal life from the person of life Jesus Christ the reward of not being hurt of the second death will mean that overcomers will not be cast into the lake of fire but will instead live with Christ in world without end all those cast in the lake of fire will be hurt and tormented for a very long time but not for eternity for sinners do not have eternal life so they cannot be punished for eternity at some point all those in the lake of fire will be annihilated and will cease to exist the reward of eating the hidden manna will be Christ revealing more of himself and his word as he will answer all of our unanswered questions for he is our manna or bread of life Christ will feed his children throughout eternity in a very personal way which was symbolized in the Old Testament by the hidden manna that God had Moses stored up in the Ark of the Covenant which was only visited once a year by one man the high priest the reward of the white stone with a new name inside of it will be the personal revelation of our true and original names that were written on the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world once we are face-to-face with Christ our new names will be made known to us as st. Paul wrote that he would know even as also I am known the reward of the power to rule over Nations will be the reward for Holy Ghost filled believers to physically rule and reign over the nations of the earth possibly during the 1000 year millennial reign with Christ upon the earth and also during the new age the new heavens and earth as spoken of in Revelation 21 verses 24 to 26 the Holy Ghost filled believers earn this right to rule because they allowed the Holy Spirit to teach them to rule over sin and temptation on earth during their earthly lives the reward of the morning star will be Jesus's personal presence that will illuminate the future Kingdom which will be so glorious that the Sun will not be needed anymore the reward of white raiment will be the shining exceeding white garments the Saints will wear which represents the righteousness of Jesus Christ the reward of the names of overcomers not being blotted out of the book of life means just that their names will not be blotted out of the book of life because they did not betray Christ and sell him out as Judas did in his transgression nor did they commit idolatry like the tribes of Dan and Ephraim and thus had the names of their tribes blotted out from under heaven the reward of being made a pillar in the temple of God means that overcomers will be given a permanent physical place near Jesus Christ for they will ever be with the Lord sharing the throne with him at his request as the physical body of Jesus will be the temple of God in the new heavens and new earth another reward will be that Christ will write upon the overcomer his own true name which has not yet been revealed and the city name of the New Jerusalem because in a marriage relationship the woman the church always takes the name of the man the husband which is Christ Jesus in our case the reward of sitting with Jesus in his throne will be the highest compliment ever paid to the humble steadfast group of Holy Ghost field Christians for Jesus will share his throne with his bride who he will use to help judge the world at the great white throne judgment this concludes the rewards for the overcomers symbols related to Jesus include the key of David the open door and the hour of temptation the key of David is symbolic of Christ's power to open and shut salvation as Jesus is the door to salvation the fact that the key is on his shoulder is symbolic of the Hebrew wedding ceremony as the bride's veil was placed upon the groom's shoulder this is symbolic of the fact that in Jesus's marriage Jesus as husband has full dominion over his bride the Gentile church and he alone bears the responsibility and care for the church with the key of David Jesus only has the key to open the hearts of the four ordained believers who will be in his bride Jesus the son of David will bring his Gentile bride to the 1000 year millennial reign of peace which is the anti-type of the peaceful reign of Solomon the son of David Jesus at the open door during the Philadelphian church age which lasted from 1750 to 1906 which was symbolic of the greatest age of missionary work in history as missionaries abounded and the word of Christ spread all over the world this great labor of brotherly love could only be done by Christ's own love the hour of temptation is a key revelation for it is the time during the tribulation period that everyone on the face of the earth will be forced to decide if they will take the mark of the beast as taught in Revelation chapter 13 verses 11 to 18 jesus promised the believers of the philadelphia and church age that they would be kept from this tribulation period because they patiently kept the words of Christ and we know this promise of Christ carries over now to the final and last year chage the Laodicean Church age symbols not directly referring to Christ are the seven angels Jezebel nor children and Satan seat concerning the seven angels we need to know that these seven angels are symbolic of earthly human messengers or preachers as mentioned earlier in Chapter 1 Jezebel mentioned revelation 2:10 is symbolic of the Roman Catholic Church for the evil spirit in that church controls or dominates the people by her own will and not the will of God which is the Word of God Jesus plainly taught how this spirit of Jezebel came to be it began with the deeds of the Nicolaitans which were seemingly harmless traditions of men that later turned into unbending false doctrines such as infant baptisms priestly celibacy praying to dead Saints worshiping statues and so forth then enter the doctrine of balaam which symbolized when the Emperor Constantine United Church and state just as Balaam United Israel with beoh peor in numbers chapter 25 the uniting of the Roman Church and the Roman state paved the way for the nearly 1,000 year dark or Middle Ages period in which the Jezebel teaching through her papal powers greatly controlled and defiled many souls through indulgences idolatry Crusades and the Inquisition the children of Jezebel or the Roman Catholic Church would then be all the denominations and independent churches that came after the mother church who share in her false doctrines such as the Trinity of three gods or persons and also any church that denies the Bible truth of one person in the Godhead full immersion in water when baptizing using the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul of man just to name a few the peoples of the earth who partake of her adultery or false doctrine will be cast into the bed of the Great Tribulation Period her children or churches who follow the mother's doctrine will be killed with death which is spiritual death the fourth and final horse rider who rides during the Tribulation Period as taught in Revelation chapter 6 verses 7 & 8 Satan C is the physical headquarters of his earthly kingdom which began in ancient Babylon or modern-day Iraq later Jesus said Satan seat moved to the city of Pergamos during the pergamene church age that lasted from 312 to 606 then Satan found his final seat which is Rome the city that sits on seven hills or mountains where Satan still sits today a final revelation from these chapters is that you and I must recognize the age that we are living in right now the Laodicean Church age which began in 1906 and continues today if you have the revelation of the age you are living in then you can be an overcomer through the power of the Holy Ghost today we must overcome a lukewarm spiritual condition which is a life that fluctuates between serving the world and serving Christ ultimately a lukewarm life will reject the perfect will of God and will do works of sin or iniquity at times while at other times will do works for God under the anointing of the genuine Holy Spirit the lukewarm church member today according to Jesus feels rich has plenty of goods and does not feel a need for more of God yet Jesus says that kind of attitude makes the lukewarm church member wretched miserable poor blind and naked Jesus gives the most bitter denunciation to the lukewarm Church due to their pride in arrogance for wanting church membership rather than the baptism of the Holy Ghost because of their pride Christ said he would spew out the lukewarm churches from his mouth meaning they will no longer speak for him they will no longer be his mouthpiece and speak with thus saith the Lord Jesus went on to teach what a hot or spirit-filled life consists of first a real believer today will be rich in faith for their faith will be tested like gold tried in the fire of afflictions second the overcomer today has white raiment which is symbolic of possessing the righteousness of Jesus Christ and living the same life that he lived last the overcomers eyes have been anointed with eye south which is symbolic of the anointing of the Holy Ghost that allows one to see truth and error to discern the deep truths of God's Word and will for their lives to be an overcomer today Jesus said we will need to accept his rebukes and chastisements because his love is corrective we must have a zeal or great desire to repent of any and all sin in our hearts and lives in the final picture of Jesus's message to our church age the latest in church age verse 20 shows that Jesus is now on the outside of the churches knocking and trying to get back into the churches in order to have supper or fellowship with them Jesus is on the outside of the churches because most churches have forsaken the preaching of his true Word and have instituted creeds denominations bylaws and traditions of men that grieve and even crucify the effects of the Holy Ghost we pray you and your church will open the door to Jesus Christ the Word of God and receive all of his love and correction through his perfect counsel if you would like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart you
