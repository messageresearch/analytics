Description:
This video shows 7 Bible-based reasons why tongues are NOT the evidence of the Holy Ghost. Tongues can be a dynamic and powerful gift of God but we must seek the Giver of the gifts first, rather than seeking the gift first. If we receive the Giver, or the Holy Ghost, then God can use the gifts He has placed in our lives when He sees fit.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose this video is to answer the question our tongues the evidence of the Holy Ghost will start right away by saying that we do not believe tongues are the evidence of the Holy Ghost we want to give seven clear Bible based reasons to prove this and we know it'll be a blessing to your heart reason number one Jesus told everyone what the real evidence of the Holy Ghost would be and it wasn't tongues Jesus said the evidence of being born again was being led by the Holy Spirit into all truth according to st. John 16 verse 13 true children of God can be taught of God according to st. John 6:45 being anointed of the Spirit to do miracles or demonstrate gifts does not prove someone is saved it simply proves the Spirit of God was present to perform a miracle or manifestation but doing the will of God and living a life without iniquity proof someone is saved according to the Lord Jesus Christ himself in Matthew chapter 7 verses 21 to 23 reason number two no Bible scripture used the literal word evidence to declare the initial evidence doctrine the word evidence is only used one time in the King James Version Hebrews 11 verse 1 this scripture has nothing to do with unknown tongues but it does have to do with our faith our faith is seen by men through our works according to James 2 verses 23 to 26 is the evidence that we have the Holy Ghost born-again experience Jesus compared the Holy Ghost to the wind in John chapter 3 verse 8 proving the Spirit is also unseen yet inside of us so this second reason goes along with the first reason the godly life you live by faith is the evidence you are born again reason number three tongs are not a sign for believers tongs are not assigned for believers according to first Corinthians chapter 14 verse 22 so they cannot be assigned to believers who are seeking the Holy Ghost baptism the Bible clearly teaches that one can be a believer and be baptized in water and yet not born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost as seen through the Ministry of Philip the Evangelist in Acts chapter 8 verses 12 through 17 this means then that anyone who's seeking the Holy Ghost with tongues as the evidence is doing wrong because they are already believers they should not be seeking an unknown tongue because they are signed for unbelievers reason number 4 st. Paul taught that not all Christians speak in tongues not all believers speak in tongues according to st. Paul in 1st Corinthians chapter 12 verse 30 it is a false teaching to try to convince every believer that they must speak in tongues it is important to note though that Paul wished all believers would speak in tongues in 1st Corinthians 14 verse 5 because of the powerful edification that the gift brings to the individual according to 1st Corinthians 14 verse 4 and the potential edification it can bring to an entire congregation if the unknown tongue would be interpreted so that everyone understood what the tongue meant with understandable words according to 1st Corinthians 14 verse 5 reason number 5 the Bible does not record tongues being manifested every time believers were born again by the Holy Ghost most the Bible teaches there were tongues three out of the five times in the book of Acts when the Holy Ghost fell and filled or baptized believers this proves tongues are not present every time the Holy Ghost comes God must have a need to manifest the power of tongues or he will not send that manifestation there were tongues present in Acts chapter 2 verses one through five Acts chapter 10 verses 44 to 46 Acts chapter 19 verses five and six but there were no tongues in Acts chapter 4 verse 31 and acts chapter 8 verse 17 so God must not have needed tongues in Acts chapter 4 verse 31 because all the believers there were Jews like Peter John and the company and spoke the same language God did not need to use tongues in Acts chapter 8 verse 17 because all the believers there were Samaritans and no doubt spoke and understood the same language reason number 6 all tongues in the book of Acts were understood but today they are mostly unknown genuine tongues from the Holy Ghost in the book of Acts were always understood when sent by God which means they were not unknown tongues all believers always understood what was said in Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 10 and Acts chapter 19 when the Holy Ghost fell and tongues were manifested the proof of this is found in Acts chapter 11 verse 15 when Peter said the Holy Ghost fell at the house of Cornelius the same way it did on the day of Pentecost all the tongues that manifested on the day of Pentecost were understood than any other tongue given when the Holy Ghost fell in the book of Acts had to be understood as well based upon the testimony of st. Peter but the sincere Bible believer has to admit that all tongues in the book of Acts were understood by the ears based upon acts 11:15 acts 2:4 through 12:10 44 to 46 and 19 1 through 6 everyone always understood the languages when the Holy Ghost fell in the Bible today there is a false teaching that says only unknown tongues come at the receiving of the Holy Ghost but that is actually opposite of what happened in Acts chapter 2 verses 4 through 12 in acts 2 the Galleon tongue spoken by the 120 Holy Ghost Vil believers were understood by the 17 people groups or languages that were present in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost Peter then preached in the Galilean language to those 17 groups and they all understood his preaching were convicted and 3,000 souls were baptized that day so the miracle was in the hearing of the listeners not in the expression of unknown tongues like many people think today in modern services today there are usually unknown tongues and no one understands what's being spoken which is completely opposite of what took place in Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 10 and Acts chapter 19 reason number seven no one knows the actual source of an unknown tongue without an interpretation or judge God desires tongues of men and angels to be manifested in his people as Saint Paul taught that the gifted tongues should be in the New Testament church according to 1st Corinthians chapter 12 verse 10 but it must be used properly and kept in order according to the entire chapter of 1st Corinthians chapter 14 the problem with unknown tongues as the absolute evidence that a person is born again is that no one knows the source of the tongue unless it is interpreted or judged according to 1st Corinthians 14 verse 29 speaking in tongues can be easily impersonated by the devil and his servants as reports from real missionaries and even religious encyclopedias describe one of the evidences of demon possession as speaking in an unknown tongue which is called glossier we cannot believe that witches and other workers of witchcraft are born again by the Spirit of God just because they spoke in an unknown tongue so unknown tongues cannot be the evidence of the Holy Ghost baptism because if it is then you would have to accept every kind of unknown tongue from any person as being evidence of being born again Saint Paul taught that he would rather speak five words with understanding than 10,000 words in an unknown tongue according to first Corinthians 14 verse 19 the Apostle taught that unknown tongues do not profit the ears unless they know the meaning of the tongues according to first Corinthians 14 verses 6 and 11 in fact Paul said a person that spoken unknown tongues would seem like a barbarian to a listener who could not understand his unknown tongues in 1st Corinthians 14 verse 11 an honest Bible reader should be able to see the importance st. Paul placed upon understanding the meaning of tongues this proves that unknown tongues without understanding the meaning of them were not the tongues that God gave on the day of Pentecost because the tongues the three thousand souls heard were understood and they knew the source the tongues were from God and were declaring the wonderful works of God and also declared that Jesus whom the Jews had crucified was Lord in Christ and was risen from the dead the three thousand souls that were saved did not think the Christians were barbarians and only speaking in unknown tongues the three thousand heard the Christians declaring the wonderful works of God and the fact that Jesus was both Lord and Christ according to Acts chapter 2 verse 11 verses 36 and 37 the Holy Ghost has not come with one mandated observation as Jesus taught in Luke chapter 17 verse 20 the Holy Ghost does come with a powerful dynamic experience that others can see in here according to Acts chapter 2 verse 33 but it cannot be limited to tongues because gifts are not evidence of being saved and gifts can be easily impersonated the pure godly and holy life a person lives after having a dynamic spiritual experience will prove they have received the genuine Holy Ghost experience the life of Christ is the evidence not an unknown tongue for I've witnessed examples of people who spoke in tongues thinking they were getting the evidence then later they turned away from God through sins like adultery and other evils a doctor's who do not repent will not inherit the kingdom of God so their life proves they were never born again they may have been anointed by the spirit to manifest the gift of tongues but that is not the same as being born again we must seek the giver before we seek his gifts our prayer is that you will seek the giver of the gifts and not the gifts only for if you receive the giver first the Holy Ghost then he will add all things unto you including any gifts when it is his time for them to be used in your life god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart if you have any questions about how times are not the evidence of the Holy Ghost or if you like more information about the true evidence of the Holy Ghost being the Holy Ghost himself and the life that follows please contact us you
