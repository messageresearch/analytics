[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matches name of
[0:10] the lord jesus christ the purpose of
[0:13] this video is to answer a viewer's
[0:15] question about columba as he asked can
[0:18] you explain why colomba did not live in
[0:21] his church age
[0:23] my answer to this question was
[0:25] quote no i cannot explain why kalama did
[0:28] not live in the age in which he was the
[0:30] messenger
[0:31] my guess is that brother branham just
[0:33] made a mistake on his dates and didn't
[0:35] have full access to all the historical
[0:37] dates brother branham never said the
[0:40] dates of the ages
[0:41] were thus saith the lord in fact on my
[0:44] larkin video on youtube i showed a quote
[0:47] from brother brandon that said he got
[0:49] the dates from historians
[0:51] end quote
[0:53] friends i cannot answer this question
[0:55] beyond a shadow of doubt because brother
[0:57] branham is not here for us to ask him
[1:00] about this subject
[1:01] but i'll share my personal opinion in
[1:03] this video
[1:04] as it is another exercise in rightly
[1:06] dividing the word of truth
[1:08] and defending jesus's message and
[1:10] messenger brother william branham who is
[1:13] a genuine prophet of god
[1:15] friends every gospel preacher is
[1:17] commissioned by the holy ghost to
[1:19] rightly divide the word of truth
[1:21] according to second timothy 2 verse 15
[1:24] and to prove all things according to
[1:26] first thessalonians 5 verse 21
[1:29] also message ministers have to rightly
[1:31] divide the quotes of brother branham as
[1:34] he taught us to be careful how we listen
[1:36] to his sermons
[1:37] discerning his human side from his
[1:39] prophetic gift
[1:40] brother branham also said we must prove
[1:42] all things not some things by the bible
[1:46] let's listen to the quote
[1:48] now we must prove all things by the
[1:52] scripture
[1:54] not what if it's contrary to my faith
[1:57] and yet the scripture says so the
[1:59] scripture is right and i'm wrong
[2:01] see
[2:02] the scripture is always right and only
[2:04] way you can do anything is come back to
[2:06] the scripture
[2:08] brother branham also said to test him by
[2:10] the word
[2:12] let's listen to the quote
[2:14] remember it's the elected is the only
[2:17] kind that'll catch it
[2:20] well you say how do you know what you're
[2:21] not right then test me by the word
[2:25] come test your denomination by this word
[2:27] let's see that prove all things the
[2:29] bible says
[2:32] and brother branham said he was not
[2:34] infallible at least twice calling it
[2:36] tomirat to make him infallible
[2:39] let's listen to the quotes
[2:59] and now i want each of you my
[3:01] dear brethren to know that
[3:04] that these answers are are given
[3:07] to the very best of my knowledge the
[3:10] very best that i would know how to
[3:12] understand and these answers
[3:15] are not infallible
[3:17] see because the scriptures is infallible
[3:21] and
[3:22] as far as i know they're aligned with
[3:24] the scriptures i hope that makes it
[3:27] plain
[3:28] and the tape is to be uh
[3:30] kept now and anyone would want it well
[3:34] they could have it but now
[3:36] i know the scriptures are infallible but
[3:39] my answers are not infallible
[3:42] so i'm sure everyone understands that
[3:44] and if it's not
[3:46] if it's not infallible then you have a
[3:48] right maybe to ask me
[3:51] at any time if there's somebody else's
[3:53] question
[3:56] but
[3:57] the lord sent me to praise
[4:00] and in there what i do know about him i
[4:03] love to express it
[4:04] with all my heart if i make mistakes you
[4:07] pray for me i'm not involved i'm your
[4:10] brother
[4:13] that they're claiming here that some
[4:15] brethren up there that said that i sent
[4:17] them up there and they're preaching that
[4:19] man should leave their wives and hunt
[4:21] for their spiritual mate
[4:23] and that
[4:24] that i am perfectly infallible that
[4:27] there's nothing
[4:29] and over some of the office things you
[4:30] ever heard and the ministerial
[4:32] association
[4:33] got a hold of it and they're writing me
[4:35] a letter about
[4:36] and
[4:37] that i sent them up there and it's
[4:40] causing a lot of confusion and some of
[4:42] them prophesying and saying if one man
[4:44] should leave this wife and go marry that
[4:46] one
[4:46] this church knows that we don't stand
[4:48] for no such tommy rod is that we believe
[4:51] in the bible
[4:54] there are some preachers that do not
[4:55] take time to answer questions and
[4:57] friends that's a very sad thing
[4:59] first peter 3 verse 15 says
[5:02] to be ready always to give an answer to
[5:05] every man that asketh you a reason of
[5:07] the hope that is in you with meekness
[5:10] and fear
[5:12] so according to the scriptural context
[5:14] one reason a preacher would not want to
[5:16] answer questions is because he was
[5:18] prideful because peter says here it
[5:21] takes meekness to answer questions the
[5:23] preacher must humble himself and look in
[5:25] the scripture or look in history or look
[5:27] in both in order to answer sincere
[5:30] questions
[5:31] the next verse first peter 3 verse 16
[5:33] says by doing this you have a good
[5:36] conscience
[5:37] so it's likely preachers that won't
[5:39] answer questions have a guilty
[5:40] conscience and are probably haunted by
[5:42] the spirit of fear
[5:44] so as always we should pray for those
[5:45] who are battling fear or any evil spirit
[5:49] the outline for this video is first
[5:51] we'll look at brother branham's apparent
[5:53] mistake on his dates in the church ages
[5:57] next i'll share my opinion on this
[5:59] subject
[6:01] third we'll look at important quotes
[6:02] from brother branham about the church
[6:04] ages and the seven seals
[6:06] and fourth we'll look at history about
[6:08] columba
[6:10] brother branham's apparent mistake on
[6:12] dates
[6:13] in the church ages
[6:15] brother branham said the authority and
[6:16] church age lasted from 606 to 1520 but
[6:20] colomba's lifetime lasted from 521 to
[6:23] 596.
[6:25] according to these dates columba did not
[6:27] even live in the church age he was
[6:29] supposed to be sent to
[6:31] brother branham's accusers will use this
[6:33] apparent mistake to mock brother branham
[6:36] and say he didn't get the memo and also
[6:39] use it to say his sermons were not
[6:41] inspired of the holy ghost
[6:43] both statements are wrong
[6:44] and the accusers have again jumped to
[6:46] conclusions without taking in all the
[6:49] evidence
[6:50] additionally accusers of brother branham
[6:52] have also falsely claimed that there is
[6:55] no such thing as church ages which is
[6:57] completely false
[6:59] scripture is clear using four scriptural
[7:02] examples that there were past ages
[7:04] current ages and future ages so there
[7:07] must be church ages for the ages of the
[7:10] gentile churches are also called the
[7:12] times of the gentiles by jesus in luke
[7:15] 21 verse 24
[7:17] ephesians 2 verse 7 says there's future
[7:20] ages that in the ages to come he might
[7:22] show the exceeding riches of his grace
[7:24] in his kindness toward us through christ
[7:27] jesus
[7:28] ephesians 3 verse 5 and colossians 1
[7:30] verse 26
[7:32] says there are past and current ages
[7:35] ephesians 3 verse 5 which in other ages
[7:38] was not made known unto the sons of men
[7:40] as it is now
[7:42] so now means a current age
[7:45] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[7:47] apostles and his prophets by the spirit
[7:50] colossians 1 26 even the mystery which
[7:53] hath been hid from ages and from
[7:55] generations but now
[7:57] this now is the current church age paul
[7:59] was living in
[8:00] but now is made manifest to his saints
[8:04] ephesians 3 verse 21 shows future ages
[8:07] unto him be glory in the church by
[8:10] christ jesus throughout all ages world
[8:12] without end amen
[8:15] these four bible verses prove that there
[8:18] are ages despite the false claims of
[8:20] brother branham's accusers
[8:22] and this proves the anti-message
[8:24] researchers also called brother random's
[8:26] accusers are only selective researchers
[8:29] selecting research only when it fits
[8:31] their narrative to attack brother
[8:33] branham
[8:34] and before moving on saints note that
[8:36] brother branham never said thus saith
[8:38] the lord every date detail and word i
[8:41] preached during the church ages was
[8:43] correct
[8:44] the truth is not every word on brother
[8:46] branham's tapes and also every word in
[8:48] his books was thus saith the lord the
[8:51] sermons and books of brother branham
[8:52] must all be rightly divided
[8:54] and proven to be true as scripture says
[8:56] in first thessalonians 5 21 and 2nd
[8:59] timothy 2 verse 15.
[9:02] my opinion
[9:04] in my personal opinion which i am always
[9:06] open to being corrected on
[9:08] i believe colomba did live in his church
[9:10] age which means brother branham probably
[9:13] forgot to compare columbus lifetime with
[9:15] the timing of the fourth church age
[9:17] thyratira which lasted from 606 to
[9:20] fifteen hundred twenty friends brother
[9:22] branham is not here that we could ask
[9:25] him about these apparent mistakes on the
[9:27] dates of the church ages so we just have
[9:29] to be humble and give our best personal
[9:31] opinion
[9:32] according to all the truth that is laid
[9:33] before us
[9:34] and colombo lived from
[9:37] 521-596
[9:39] a simple comparison shows according to
[9:41] the dates brother branham gave for the
[9:42] church ages columba did not even live
[9:45] during the age in which he was the
[9:46] messenger
[9:48] here's a visual of the dates clarence
[9:49] larkin and brother branham used for the
[9:51] seven church ages
[9:59] friends here's a quote where brother
[10:00] branham said columba came in thirteera
[10:03] and not before thyrotira so clearly
[10:06] brother branham thought columba lived
[10:07] during or in his church age so it's
[10:10] likely brother branham just never looked
[10:11] up columba's lifespan let's listen to
[10:14] the quote
[10:20] [Laughter]
[10:24] is
[10:30] [Laughter]
[10:39] in this next quote brother ram never
[10:41] claimed all the dates in the church ages
[10:42] were from the lord let's listen to this
[10:44] quote remember as i said before
[10:47] sometimes on these things
[10:49] we might disagree upon them as far as as
[10:52] the theology is concerned
[10:55] and most of my dates i take from the
[10:57] authentic uh
[10:59] historians which really not interested
[11:02] in any side they just wrote down facts
[11:04] whatever it was what the churches did
[11:07] and i of course the divine part of the
[11:09] interpretation
[11:11] i tried to place it up on there myself
[11:13] the best that i know how
[11:17] but brother branham did say the choices
[11:19] of the seven messengers was from the
[11:21] lord which is proven true because
[11:23] brother brahm did not get the names of
[11:25] the messengers or stars from larkin
[11:28] uriah smith or any other historian or
[11:30] preacher
[11:31] let's listen to the quote
[11:34] you might disagree but i sat there for
[11:36] days and days under inspiration until i
[11:38] felt the holy spirit's strength
[11:40] that's reason i know and watch these man
[11:43] that has been picked if you're a
[11:45] historian
[11:46] there's the same man that i have got
[11:48] here and know by revelation that they
[11:50] was the angels to the church they had
[11:52] the same ministry that these did at the
[11:54] beginning
[11:56] and that ministry cannot change it must
[11:59] save pentecost all the way through
[12:03] important quotes regarding the seven
[12:05] church ages and seven seals
[12:08] i feel compelled to share the following
[12:10] quotes to help followers of brother
[12:11] branham's end time message to better
[12:14] understand his ministry in the seven
[12:16] church ages and in the seven seals
[12:19] first brother branham said the
[12:20] messengers always came at the end of
[12:22] their ages
[12:23] a simple comparison of the timeline
[12:25] shows that is not the case
[12:27] it's more common that the messengers
[12:29] came at the beginning of their ages
[12:31] here's the quote about the messengers
[12:32] always coming at the end of the
[12:37] age ages its messenger
[12:39] we know that
[12:41] paul was the first messenger
[12:43] and when the first trumpet sounded
[12:46] and the first seal was tore loose paul
[12:49] was the first messenger as we
[13:01] that jesus had produced to them
[13:03] remember paul come at the end of the age
[13:05] all the messengers come at the end of
[13:07] the age
[13:08] it's at the end time
[13:11] when these things are brought forth
[13:16] at the end of the pentecost nation we
[13:19] are supposed to receive according to the
[13:21] word as god help me tonight to show you
[13:23] you hear that we are to see receive a
[13:27] messenger
[13:29] that will take all those who sins out
[13:31] there and reveal the whole secret of god
[13:34] by the master of the church
[13:39] and here's a simple chart that shows the
[13:40] messengers came at the beginning of
[13:42] their ages except for columba
[13:45] so here you see paul came at the
[13:47] beginning of the ephesian church age
[13:51] arenas finished his ministry at the
[13:53] beginning of the sumerian church age
[13:56] martin lived his entire life during the
[13:58] beginning of his church age the
[14:00] pergamian church age and again according
[14:03] to brother ramsey's dates columbus did
[14:04] not live during his church age the third
[14:06] tier in church age
[14:08] but as i wrote in my 2021 book it seems
[14:11] likely that the thyroidian age started
[14:14] around 560.
[14:16] because there was a holy ghost and power
[14:18] movement
[14:19] in frigia from 560 to 565 that resembled
[14:23] the day of pentecost as all nine gifts
[14:25] of the spirit were honored and operated
[14:28] so it seems likely thyrotira began with
[14:31] the revival just as laodicea began with
[14:34] the 1906 azusa street revival
[14:37] and of course this is my own opinion
[14:39] this is the most logical answer i could
[14:40] come up by comparing church history with
[14:43] the scriptures
[14:46] there you can see martin luther came at
[14:48] the beginning of his church age
[14:50] along with john wesley the beginning of
[14:52] his church age the philadelphian church
[14:54] age
[14:56] and lastly brother branham came at the
[14:57] beginning of his church age the current
[14:59] church age laodicea and again friends
[15:02] not to be critical but remember the
[15:03] quote from the first seal when brother
[15:04] branham said at the end of the
[15:06] pentecostal age we're supposed to
[15:08] receive a messenger
[15:09] which of course was speaking of brother
[15:11] ram's ministry
[15:12] again i don't bring these quotes out to
[15:14] criticize brother branham but just to
[15:15] show that not every word was thus saith
[15:17] the lord we must do as the bible says
[15:19] rightly divide the word of truth we must
[15:21] be honest with ourselves and we must
[15:23] remain humble and prove all things as
[15:26] the bible says and search the scriptures
[15:28] daily whether these things be so and be
[15:30] ready to give an answer to every man who
[15:32] asketh of the hope that we have within
[15:34] us
[15:36] so an honest look at the church ages
[15:38] sermons will show that not every word
[15:40] brother branham said during the church
[15:42] ages was thus saith the lord
[15:45] here in the patmos vision which was part
[15:47] of the church age series brother branham
[15:49] said the revelation 6 white horse writer
[15:53] was the word
[15:54] and he said it was the same white horse
[15:56] writer of revelation 19
[15:59] but as you probably know during the
[16:01] first seal brother ram said the
[16:02] revelation 6 white horse rider was the
[16:04] antichrist
[16:07] let's listen to the quote
[16:10] when the white horse there was six when
[16:12] the white horse rider went forth he was
[16:14] giving up a bull to conquer and to
[16:16] conquer
[16:18] and a sword went out of his mouth
[16:20] what was he the white horse rider of
[16:23] revelations
[16:25] notice the
[16:26] sword out of his mouth goes a sharp
[16:30] two-eighth sword
[16:33] a word and finally by his word when it's
[16:37] made manifest to all the sons of god he
[16:41] owned his validation down with his words
[16:50] and of course friends as you know if you
[16:52] listen to the seven seals brother ram
[16:53] said the white horse rider was the
[16:55] antichrist
[16:56] not the holy
[17:00] [Music]
[17:02] spirit antichrist that deceitful spirit
[17:06] has gone now and crept in
[17:10] so again this shows not every word on
[17:12] tape as thus saith the lord and brother
[17:14] ram could grow in revelation like all of
[17:16] us can regarding the seven seals notice
[17:19] that not every word brother branham
[17:21] preached during this seven seals series
[17:23] was thus saith the lord as proven by the
[17:26] following two quotes and of course
[17:28] there's probably more examples
[17:29] the first example is brother branham
[17:31] said there were 700 who did not bow the
[17:33] knee to bail
[17:34] but then later corrected it and said
[17:36] there were seven thousand let's listen
[17:38] to the quotes
[17:40] now wait a minute wait a minute wait
[17:41] midline's running
[17:42] and i got 700 to hit out around the
[17:44] united states you don't know where
[17:45] they're at
[17:48] god said i'm going to open up on the
[17:49] seals and show you something
[17:52] he said you know i got 700 back there
[17:56] that ain't never about anita joined any
[17:58] of them created
[18:00] denominations there's 700 of them ready
[18:03] for the ranch early
[18:07] first kings 19 brother branham
[18:10] i believe that the number who did not
[18:12] bow the knee was set yeah that's right
[18:14] 700 instead thank you that's correct for
[18:17] 767 000.
[18:20] brother
[18:21] seven thousand to the 700. i see that
[18:29] the second example is that brother
[18:30] branham said he could make someone's
[18:32] head swim and then immediately after he
[18:35] apologized
[18:36] now friends god doesn't apologize god
[18:38] doesn't make mistakes
[18:39] so brother adam's human statement that
[18:41] he could make someone's head swim and
[18:42] confuse them was not thus saith the lord
[18:45] because he apologized about it he made a
[18:47] mistake as he admitted let's listen to
[18:49] the quotes
[18:50] it just goes to show that people without
[18:54] the baptism and our call to the office
[18:57] of a minister has no business to be in
[19:00] the pulpit
[19:02] right
[19:03] i i can take that person out by the help
[19:05] of god and time is such an eye to make
[19:07] her head swim look don't know what i
[19:09] don't mean i don't sound like forgiving
[19:12] i didn't mean that lord i didn't know i
[19:13] felt he checked me on that see so i
[19:15] didn't even sit that way i'm sorry
[19:17] i believe that the holy spirit could
[19:19] reveal to that person some secret
[19:22] that sounds better
[19:24] it's just like tuning a instrument when
[19:25] you do something wrong you can tell each
[19:27] christian you said something wrong he
[19:28] didn't like that see that was putting me
[19:30] in there see
[19:31] i ain't in the picture at all i'm just
[19:33] going to be myself for nothing just him
[19:35] let him do the work
[19:38] so these examples would help anyone who
[19:40] would say well i'm taking brother
[19:42] branham's statements during the seven
[19:44] seals because they were more inspired
[19:47] while it's true brother branham felt the
[19:48] seven seals were the most inspired
[19:50] sermons of his ministry it doesn't mean
[19:52] every word in the seven seals series was
[19:55] thus saith the lord as we've just proven
[19:57] this means we still have to rightly
[19:59] divide the word of truth in the sermons
[20:01] on the seven seals
[20:03] before moving on here's a quote where
[20:05] brother brahm said colombo was the third
[20:07] church age messenger and also said
[20:09] martin was the fourth church age
[20:10] messenger
[20:11] but again according to this picture from
[20:13] the church age book
[20:14] and other quotes this was likely a slip
[20:16] of brother ram's tongue as he simply
[20:19] switched the third and fourth messengers
[20:22] let's listen to the quotes
[20:24] the third church age which was pergamos
[20:27] was saint columbia which was a great
[20:30] saint of god
[20:31] during the time of the dark age and the
[20:34] persecution of the fourth age and the
[20:37] fourth count
[20:38] saint martin of taurus the great saint
[20:42] coming from france
[20:45] here's a quote from brother branham
[20:46] where he says the revelations from the
[20:48] seven seals and the church ages were
[20:50] thus saith the lord
[20:51] as you listen to the quote consider
[20:53] these human errors that we've heard in
[20:55] the seven seals and in the church ages
[20:58] so this statement by brother branham can
[21:00] only mean that the revelations in the
[21:02] church ages and the seals were thus
[21:04] saith the lord and not every word on the
[21:06] tape was thus saith the lord
[21:08] let's listen to the quote
[21:10] now the vision plus the word plus the
[21:13] history plus the church ages and all
[21:16] blend together so
[21:18] i could
[21:19] truly say
[21:20] that to the best of my understanding and
[21:23] according to the word of god and the
[21:25] vision and the revelation the
[21:27] interpretation thereof is thus saith the
[21:30] lord
[21:33] history about columba
[21:36] to go along with the history brother
[21:37] branham used about columba in the church
[21:39] age book here's a few more details i
[21:41] found while researching columba for my
[21:43] 2021 book on pages 448 and 449 in my
[21:47] book i wrote
[21:49] the fire tier in church age 606 to 1520
[21:54] in revelation chapter 2 verses 18
[21:56] through 29.
[21:58] star
[21:59] columba is the angel star to this age
[22:02] he was born of royal blood in northern
[22:05] ireland but thankfully his father fergus
[22:08] valued jesus's cross more than his
[22:10] physical royal blood
[22:12] fergus diligently taught colomba the
[22:14] scripture kalama became a powerful
[22:16] missionary after hearing jesus's audible
[22:19] voice call him into missionary work
[22:23] some historians place columbus
[22:25] supernatural missionary works in second
[22:28] place after jesus apostles
[22:31] two testimonies stick out in regards to
[22:33] god's power to save the lost
[22:35] visiting one heathen city columba prayed
[22:38] outside the gates while magicians inside
[22:40] the city tried to drown out his voice
[22:44] god increased the volume of his prayers
[22:45] until the holy spirit swung open the
[22:48] gates so heathens could hear and receive
[22:50] christ
[22:52] a second similar testimony is told of
[22:54] columba praying to enter a walled city
[22:57] being refused entrance he turned to
[22:59] leave but the chief's son became
[23:01] violently ill and the chief called for
[23:03] colomba to pray for his son
[23:05] after the chief repented god healed the
[23:07] son and christ won souls in the city
[23:11] dr craig lamp credits columbus work of
[23:14] preserving god's word in the dark ages
[23:17] with making the reformation possible
[23:20] in 563 a.d columbus started a bible
[23:23] college in iona located in western
[23:26] scotland
[23:27] it's believed the barren ionian ground
[23:29] turned fruitful after columba planted
[23:32] seeds with one hand and lifted the other
[23:34] in prayer to jesus
[23:36] lamp says columbus college would
[23:38] continue through the dark ages the vast
[23:40] majority of evangelism that took place
[23:43] for the next 700 years took place as a
[23:46] result of that bible college
[23:50] due to its great missionary efforts the
[23:52] island was nicknamed the isle of the
[23:54] saints
[23:55] from it flowed many missionaries into
[23:57] scotland ireland and england
[24:00] building missionary villages was their
[24:02] main method of winning souls small
[24:04] groups of saints who were builders
[24:06] preachers and teachers would raise walls
[24:08] around their newly formed community and
[24:10] make converse of those who moved into
[24:12] their village
[24:14] faithful preachers and teachers were
[24:15] established among the new converts and
[24:18] trained to repeat this method
[24:20] these christian villages remained
[24:22] independent from rome and government aid
[24:24] keeping the true faith alive in jesus
[24:26] little flock during the awful dark ages
[24:30] few men of god had such lasting and
[24:32] far-reaching influence as columba
[24:36] in closing
[24:38] friends i hope this video was a blessing
[24:40] it's so important to see today that god
[24:42] sent a prophet named william branham and
[24:44] he sent him with thus saith the lord's
[24:46] statements but not every word brother
[24:48] branham said was thus saith the lord
[24:50] friends we've got to allow brother
[24:51] branham to be human but also a prophet
[24:53] of god
[24:54] and it's extremely important that we
[24:56] follow the bible commands that tell us
[24:58] to prove all things search the
[25:00] scriptures daily whether these things
[25:02] are so
[25:03] to have an answer for every man who asks
[25:05] you of the reason of the hope that you
[25:07] have within you
[25:08] and the command to rightly divide the
[25:10] word of truth
[25:11] may god help preachers and all other
[25:13] believers to be humble to be willing to
[25:16] answer questions
[25:17] and be honest before the people
[25:19] that we may be faithful stewards to the
[25:21] gospel of jesus christ
[25:24] if you have any questions concerns or
[25:26] testimonies about this video please

[25:29] [Music]
[25:31] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[25:33] the desire of your heart
