[35:14] god
[35:17] [Music]
[35:28] appreciate that let's go to
[35:32] a scripture here i'd like to look at the
[35:34] mystery of god's will you know sunday
[35:36] morning we finished
[35:38] that little series there on uh proving
[35:41] all things i'd like to get back and
[35:42] finish a couple more series
[35:44] or whether i can finish a mystery of
[35:46] god's will tonight or sunday or i'm
[35:48] sorry next wednesday
[35:49] and then try to finish the philippians
[35:51] series and then
[35:52] we'll see where the lord takes us after
[35:54] that god's grace
[35:56] so i'd like to go to uh first
[35:57] corinthians 12 let's go
[35:59] back we'll finish a couple gifts of the
[36:00] spirit tonight lord willing
[36:02] and then we'll move on past that
[36:09] thank you first corinthians 12. i don't
[36:12] have any slides in case you will be
[36:13] pulling up
[36:14] probably numerous scriptures tonight
[36:16] god's grace first corinthians 12.
[36:30] so by god's grace we're on verse 10
[36:32] first corinthians 12
[36:38] 10.
[36:48] but i can start there right
[36:54] first corinthians 12 10.
[36:58] let's all read 10 and 11 together
[37:06] thank you for helping out carrots on the
[37:08] scripture in the bible
[37:10] all right that's read ten eleven on
[37:12] three one two
[37:14] three to another the working of miracles
[37:18] to another prophecy to another
[37:20] discerning of spirits
[37:22] to another diverse kinds of tongues
[37:25] to another the interpretation of tongues
[37:29] but all these worketh that one and the
[37:32] self-same spirit
[37:33] dividing to every man severally as he
[37:36] will
[37:37] may god add his blessings to the ring of
[37:39] his word you may be seated praise god
[37:46] so let's uh look to the lord here and
[37:49] we'll uh
[37:50] minister on this thought here continue
[37:53] on the
[37:54] mystery of god's will last time it was
[37:57] part seven we looked at
[37:59] uh the first few gifts of the holy
[38:01] spirit uh we looked at uh
[38:04] wisdom knowledge faith uh then
[38:07] healing last time miracles and prophecy
[38:11] and tonight we'll look at discernment of
[38:13] spirits
[38:14] and diverse kinds of tongues and
[38:16] interpretations
[38:19] and then we're willing if we get through
[38:20] that uh just give a little
[38:22] testimony about god's will and we'll
[38:25] look at rewards
[38:26] and consequences rewards for accepting
[38:30] the mystery
[38:31] and then consequences for rejecting the
[38:33] mystery
[38:37] so by god's grace tonight we'll look at
[38:38] discernment
[38:40] now the gift of discernment it judges or
[38:43] distinguishes between the source or
[38:46] motivation behind
[38:47] actions
[38:50] uh prophecies or words so when someone
[38:54] has the gift of discernment they're able
[38:56] by god's spirit
[38:58] to tell the source why did the person
[39:01] uh act that way why did the person
[39:04] prophesy that
[39:05] why did the person say that or why did
[39:07] the person do that
[39:09] the gift of discernment judges
[39:12] the source or motivation uh behind
[39:16] an action just like first corinthians
[39:18] i'm sorry just like uh
[39:19] hebrews 4 12 says the word of god is
[39:22] cup is cut uh it cuts sharp it's sharper
[39:25] than a double-edged sword it discerns
[39:28] the joints and bones of the marrow and
[39:30] divides asunder the soul and spirit
[39:34] and so that's a perfect scripture about
[39:36] the gift of discernment
[39:37] praise god and it divides and shows
[39:41] it judges the thoughts and intents of
[39:43] the heart
[39:47] and so it's able to tell which is
[39:50] wonderful
[39:50] it's able to tell is it from the holy
[39:52] spirit or is it from a fallen spirit
[39:55] right that's what
[39:56] discernment's able to do it judges is
[39:58] this from a true spirit of god
[40:00] or is this a fallen demonic spirit of
[40:03] god
[40:03] and it's able to identify it so it's
[40:06] able to tell also whether it's a spirit
[40:07] of divination
[40:08] a lying spirit a greedy spirit
[40:12] a lustful spirit a jealous spirit
[40:16] one of those is able to divide and
[40:17] discern and tell which spirit it is
[40:20] okay so this gift it judges publicly
[40:24] also
[40:25] anything that's announced publicly like
[40:27] prophecies
[40:28] or interpretations of unknown tongues uh
[40:31] the scripture says
[40:32] first corinthians 14 29 did you put it
[40:35] up there
[40:36] first corinthians 14 29
[40:39] what a level of maturity i think we
[40:41] ended uh part
[40:42] seven with that idea what maturity
[40:45] is it going to take for uh
[40:48] someone to stand up in our audience and
[40:51] foretell the future
[40:52] or discern someone's action
[40:55] and then what maturity is going to take
[40:57] after that for people to judge
[41:00] and say that person was right or wrong
[41:03] if the lord allows these all these gifts
[41:05] to be manifested
[41:06] in the service before the coming of the
[41:08] lord
[41:09] we know it does happen at certain times
[41:11] uh hasn't happened for us in a while
[41:14] uh but nevertheless god is the same
[41:15] yesterday today and forever
[41:17] the bible said let the prophets speak
[41:19] two or three
[41:20] and let the other judge can go to the
[41:22] next verse verse 30
[41:24] if anything be revealed to another that
[41:26] sitteth by let the first
[41:28] hold his peace okay so it's it's true
[41:31] maturity gifts
[41:33] are often looked down upon sometimes by
[41:35] people but really
[41:36] when they're operated the right way it's
[41:38] the it's a true expression of christian
[41:40] maturity
[41:42] because they're able to judge and and
[41:44] discern people's intentions
[41:46] like brother ryan was able to judge that
[41:48] woman who said well i've got a word from
[41:49] the lord right after i go to
[41:51] get my hair done i got to get my my next
[41:53] permanent remember brother i told that
[41:54] story
[41:55] a woman said well i'll have a message
[41:57] from the lord billy once i get my hair
[41:59] colored and once i get my hair done the
[42:01] right way and brother man discern right
[42:03] away that was the wrong spirit
[42:05] and it kept trying to interrupt brother
[42:06] bran was preaching and lamb said he had
[42:08] to tell that person to
[42:10] sit down right because it was trying to
[42:12] interrupt the preaching of the word
[42:14] okay and so uh and then people after the
[42:17] service remember they came up to brother
[42:18] branham and they said oh you're blasting
[42:20] the holy spirit i said brother branson
[42:22] how can i blaspheme
[42:23] when the word of god says the spirit is
[42:25] subject to the prophets
[42:27] and the prophet uh knew that that that
[42:29] message wasn't to come at that time
[42:32] uh but what a maturity it's gonna take
[42:34] for us uh to be able
[42:36] lord willing in the future to be able to
[42:38] do this to publicly announce messages to
[42:41] people
[42:42] but then have to judge and sit there and
[42:44] judge and say was this from god
[42:46] or is this not from god and then uh
[42:50] live with the consequences right you
[42:51] have to live with the consequences
[42:53] and if it's uh if it was right then we
[42:55] rejoice if it's wrong then it's time to
[42:57] repent
[42:58] like i said it hasn't happened much um
[43:01] as far as publicly
[43:02] you know we see it more one-on-one in
[43:04] conversations you can
[43:06] judge people's spirits many times and
[43:08] their actions
[43:10] one-on-one uh but it does happen from
[43:13] time to time
[43:14] so this is uh the gift of like it's like
[43:17] a sword
[43:18] and it divides a man's soul and spirit
[43:21] and discerns the thoughts and tents of
[43:22] the heart
[43:24] uh now it also tells the private secrets
[43:28] of the heart like with brother branham's
[43:30] gift of discernment right and jesus
[43:32] with the woman at the well and jesus
[43:34] with nathanael right
[43:36] uh he said philip he's philip once
[43:37] nathaniel said come and see right and
[43:40] when
[43:40] philip got there jesus said i saw you
[43:42] are you under the fig tree right
[43:44] and he said i know you're the messiah he
[43:46] said if you believe this
[43:47] you're going to see much more than this
[43:48] praise god so it judged it right away
[43:52] it judged where he was it told him
[43:54] things and secrets
[43:55] that only nathanael could know only the
[43:57] woman at the well could know
[43:59] and that was a a sign of a gift praise
[44:02] god
[44:03] now you remember solomon used a sermon
[44:05] to reveal the good intentions of the
[44:07] real mother
[44:08] of the baby when another woman falsely
[44:10] claimed to be its mother
[44:11] so there it revealed the intentions
[44:13] right a real mother doesn't want to see
[44:15] their baby lost
[44:17] right but the mother uh who wasn't the
[44:19] real mother she didn't care whether the
[44:21] baby was divided or not
[44:23] but the real mother cared so the gift of
[44:25] discernment shows
[44:26] who really cares praise god it shows uh
[44:29] who is the
[44:30] the real owner of something praise god
[44:33] in this case a mother of
[44:34] children and then we already mentioned
[44:37] him nathanael
[44:38] nathanael had a guileless spirit think
[44:40] about that jesus said
[44:41] you have nothing wrong in your spirit
[44:42] think about that you have no
[44:44] pretense you're not pretending at all
[44:46] that's what jesus said
[44:48] he said you have no guile in your spirit
[44:49] what a compliment
[44:51] oh i want that to be my i want that to
[44:53] be my testimony don't you want that too
[44:55] where jesus would say you're not a
[44:57] pretender you're as genuine as they come
[44:59] praise god like they say you're true
[45:02] blue praise god
[45:04] he said nathanael was guileless there's
[45:06] no guile in your spirit
[45:08] but he also had to show the woman her
[45:10] five
[45:11] uh six men that were immoral and she
[45:14] said
[45:14] surely thou art a prophet so judge those
[45:17] spirits
[45:18] right and judge them uh peter
[45:21] exercised discernment when he revealed
[45:23] ananias's secret lie
[45:25] and sapphira secret lie and also simon
[45:28] the sorcerer's
[45:29] wicked heart condition we looked at a
[45:31] few services ago
[45:33] that was such a striking scripture my he
[45:36] bapped
[45:36] he was baptized and simon the sorcerer
[45:38] and he followed them he believed
[45:40] but then when it came time uh where he
[45:42] saw power operating
[45:44] he wanted to buy the power and peter
[45:46] said you're in the bitterness
[45:48] of heart what a bitter heart condition
[45:52] and so see church words many times tell
[45:54] what's in people's hearts right
[45:56] the things people want and i'll say like
[45:58] this the things they spend their money
[46:00] on many times reveals what's in their
[46:02] heart
[46:03] right or what they're willing to spend
[46:04] their money on like one time somebody
[46:06] told me
[46:07] oh i think it's okay to have to spend 20
[46:09] 000
[46:10] on a hairdo and i thought what kind of
[46:13] what kind of spirit is that
[46:14] i thought instantly i thought well my
[46:16] spirit judges that that's the wrong
[46:17] spirit
[46:18] when you know people are hungry and
[46:20] dying and uh starving and
[46:22] can't can't pay for their rent and you
[46:24] spend twenty thousand dollars on one
[46:26] haircut
[46:28] and i thought that instantly judged it
[46:30] and then i found culture brother branham
[46:32] said
[46:32] that's evil you know he said something
[46:34] along those lines where it's evil
[46:36] but he's just instantly see people's
[46:38] words many times
[46:40] express the conditions of their heart
[46:42] whether it's a a good heart right it's a
[46:44] heart with
[46:45] a a true heart right with understanding
[46:47] and honesty
[46:48] or it's a heart of thorns right and
[46:51] cares of the world and
[46:53] and pleasures of this world or it's a
[46:56] heart that has a
[46:57] uh a heart that has a stony ground right
[47:00] and it's never gonna produce anything
[47:02] right it's just gonna
[47:03] be there for a little while and then
[47:04] it's gonna get dried out
[47:07] so many times church we catch people's
[47:10] spirits
[47:10] by the things they say
[47:14] like the one time when the preacher fell
[47:16] away a famous preacher in ohio fell away
[47:18] uh we had i had six things i knew he was
[47:20] wrong one thing he let his children
[47:22] listen to rock and roll with headphones
[47:23] i knew that was wrong
[47:24] i discerned that right away he let the
[47:26] women cut their hair and wear makeup
[47:28] just in a little bit
[47:29] just a little bit uh a little levin
[47:32] levin's a whole lump right
[47:34] and there was uh he oh he made fun of a
[47:37] brother who our brother brooks he made
[47:38] from
[47:38] front of brother brooks there's four
[47:40] things already i can't remember the
[47:41] other two things
[47:43] uh oh yeah you talk you got the holy
[47:44] ghost when you believe the
[47:46] uh the god that brother man was a
[47:47] prophet there's five out of six
[47:50] so my my buzzer's going off constantly
[47:53] around that person
[47:54] and eventually they leave the message
[47:55] and fall away and so
[47:57] what does that the the spirit of
[47:59] discernment does that
[48:00] it judges the source behind those words
[48:04] and so peter did that he he discerned
[48:06] simon the sorcerer's wicked heart
[48:08] condition
[48:09] when he wanted to have a gift that god
[48:11] didn't ordain him
[48:13] to have uh sinners recognize
[48:16] god's spirit when their secrets are
[48:18] revealed
[48:19] through gifts of prophecy i remember the
[48:21] one time we had a brother when we first
[48:23] moved back into this sanctuary we had a
[48:25] brother visit
[48:26] he used to be from the lima area and i
[48:28] preached on king saul
[48:29] we were in this sanctuary right here i
[48:31] remember he kind of sat in the back in
[48:33] the middle
[48:34] and i still remember his name and
[48:36] everything too but i appreciate all the
[48:37] song i didn't know why i was preaching
[48:38] on saul i was preaching on that series
[48:39] on psalm david
[48:40] and i was just showing how saul fell
[48:42] short of the glory of god
[48:44] and out in the parking lot the brother
[48:46] come up and
[48:47] was crying and saying you preached my
[48:49] whole life today
[48:50] and uh he got caught in abuse case and
[48:53] he was actually heading to jail and he
[48:54] spent time in jail
[48:55] he said that was me i thought i had all
[48:58] of god's blessings in the message
[49:00] but then i i i took the wrong decision
[49:02] and it ruined my
[49:04] entire life and he said he spent years
[49:06] and
[49:07] in debauchery and years uh
[49:10] in uh uh basically regret regretting
[49:14] but what did the word what did the word
[49:15] do it discerned his life
[49:17] praise god it judged his life his jaw
[49:20] his life
[49:21] was a saw life but our lives should be a
[49:23] day in life right
[49:24] men and women after the heart of god but
[49:26] without the stumbling right
[49:28] right because we've got more power in
[49:30] the new testament praise god amen
[49:32] hallelujah amen so uh
[49:36] it's clear the word of god shows the
[49:38] secrets and so
[49:39] we had a i say like someone who's
[49:41] backslidden their secrets were revealed
[49:42] during the word of the word of god is
[49:44] being preached
[49:48] and then we had a dream of some saints
[49:51] in our church a few years ago
[49:52] they had a dream that wolves were
[49:55] attacking them
[49:57] uh and the bible says that uh evil
[50:00] spirits are like wolves
[50:02] in acts 20 29 and 30. so case if you can
[50:05] pull that one up
[50:06] so right at that very moment um
[50:09] they had these they had this dream where
[50:12] wolves were attacking them and then
[50:13] other people in the church were at that
[50:15] time were around
[50:17] and so they were connected to the wolves
[50:19] so can you pull that up acts 20
[50:21] 29 and 30.
[50:26] okay i can actually 20 29 and 30.
[50:30] all right thank you uh 29 for this i
[50:33] know that after my departing shall
[50:35] grievous wolves enter in among you
[50:37] not spring the flock
[50:40] verse 30 also of your own self shall men
[50:42] arise speaking perverse things to draw
[50:44] away
[50:45] uh disciples after them and uh
[50:48] the very moment after uh
[50:52] this this couple sent me the text i had
[50:54] just told my wife i
[50:56] i was talking about a problem in the
[50:57] church i said i said these
[50:59] i said this family's acting like wolves
[51:01] and then i got the text that very minute
[51:03] the very minute
[51:05] uh where this couple had a dream and it
[51:08] was about this situation
[51:10] and so that judged it completely because
[51:12] when the word of god came to judge it
[51:14] they admitted they were wrong and uh we
[51:16] were on the right side by god's grace
[51:18] so that's what discernment does it
[51:20] judges it reveals the source
[51:22] behind actions praise god and i love
[51:24] that god using dreams
[51:26] god using uh word and discernment he
[51:28] does it all the time
[51:31] and then another saint uh
[51:36] god help me discern uh uh they were they
[51:38] had a lying spirit on them one of our
[51:40] former church members
[51:42] when they requested permission to share
[51:44] their false teachings
[51:46] and in front of the church they want to
[51:48] do that and they kind of lied about it
[51:50] they kind of said oh i just want to give
[51:51] a testimony
[51:52] but they lied about it because they
[51:54] wanted to inject some false doctrine to
[51:56] draw disciples after themselves
[51:59] and to a church that they thought was
[52:02] right
[52:03] but see i just the holy spirit just gave
[52:04] me uh that that buzzer
[52:06] that ring went off and just discerned it
[52:08] and said that's not the right spirit
[52:10] that's not what the holy spirit would do
[52:12] i remember that one time i told you
[52:13] about down in north carolina
[52:14] we were having a wonderful time at the
[52:16] altar a member at tim humes church
[52:19] and a sister came up and tried to tug
[52:21] remember that guys
[52:22] tug the the mic right out of the
[52:24] pastor's hand the pastor said they're
[52:25] like no that's the wrong spirit
[52:27] and we had to it was really quite a
[52:29] situation and we had to go in the back
[52:31] afterwards and she
[52:32] eventually repented back there young she
[52:34] could have been 15 maybe 20
[52:36] years old and she just had a burden to
[52:39] try to correct her friend but she wanted
[52:40] to do it in the wrong way
[52:42] at the wrong time uh basically wanted to
[52:45] tell her friend that she was uh going
[52:47] into sin but
[52:48] uh that was the wrong time and place the
[52:50] wrong time in place
[52:52] that's not the right uh the the woman
[52:54] shouldn't take while
[52:55] while the pastor is trying to get people
[52:56] to repent and get them to the altar and
[53:00] someone shouldn't come up and interrupt
[53:02] the pastor right because everything
[53:04] should be done decently in an order
[53:06] praise god all right so that's just a
[53:08] few simple examples
[53:10] where the holy spirit will discern the
[53:12] right time it'll discern
[53:14] uh the spirit behind people's decisions
[53:17] or
[53:17] can give dreams to do discernment all
[53:20] kinds of things
[53:21] where it does good where it gives us
[53:23] clear discernment
[53:25] but as i said on sunday remember there's
[53:26] times we don't always have discernment
[53:28] right
[53:29] our gifts don't operate every single day
[53:31] in every single situation
[53:33] right like judas is scared at the last
[53:35] supper the disciples didn't discern him
[53:37] remember we talked about that on sunday
[53:39] and so what would you say oh the the
[53:41] disciples don't have discernment no
[53:43] god just didn't anoint them for that
[53:45] moment to have it
[53:47] right and then they had to live with it
[53:49] afterwards they heard judas left and
[53:50] they had to live with it afterwards
[53:52] they didn't have discernment for every
[53:54] moment and so it's kind of like
[53:56] uh it's kind of this idea you know we
[53:59] want god to be able to use gifts in our
[54:01] lives but we can't force god to do it
[54:03] praise god it's got to be god's time and
[54:06] it's got to be
[54:06] god's season we can't keep uh we can't
[54:10] force god to do anything
[54:12] uh we have but we have to be uh set
[54:14] aside that's what the word sanctified
[54:16] means
[54:16] set aside consecrated set in a holy
[54:19] place so god can use us
[54:21] when he wants to use us all right so
[54:24] just uh that idea there
[54:25] where discernment is an automatic of
[54:27] something that happens every single time
[54:31] all right now that's the gift of
[54:32] discernment let's go to tongues now
[54:34] tongues allow believers to speak in
[54:37] unknown or known
[54:38] human languages or even unknown tongues
[54:41] of angels
[54:43] jesus promised believers would speak in
[54:45] new tongues
[54:46] in mark 16 17 did you pull up their
[54:48] acacia it'd just be good to read that
[54:51] jesus promised believers would speak in
[54:53] new tongues
[54:54] um now they're only for public when
[54:57] they're interpreted
[54:58] and judged but if they're young gifts
[55:00] that we encourage them to be public
[55:02] right
[55:02] until uh we get an interpreter
[55:06] so mark 16 17 and these signs shall
[55:10] follow them that believe and the church
[55:11] said
[55:12] amen praise god in my name they shall
[55:15] cast out devils
[55:16] they shall speak with new tongues praise
[55:20] god
[55:21] so it's a bible promise from jesus
[55:25] now we in the message are so we're so
[55:27] sure that
[55:28] we're not going to beg god to uh every
[55:31] service to speak in tongues right like
[55:33] that was my experience growing up
[55:35] we had tongues in every service and if
[55:37] not you know the people didn't think we
[55:38] had a good service
[55:40] that was my experience and and my church
[55:43] taught well you got a
[55:45] jib jabber say something over and over
[55:48] till you speak in tongues
[55:49] right but we're talk over and over in
[55:51] the message uh
[55:52] to not make tongues and evidence because
[55:54] that was the
[55:55] false doctrine of this day right that's
[55:58] the false doctrine this day
[55:59] but yet the bible does say that this
[56:02] will be one of the signs
[56:04] that follow believers praise god and so
[56:07] it
[56:08] accompanies the gift so just like we
[56:10] should see casting out devils
[56:11] we should also have those speaking with
[56:14] new tongues praise god
[56:16] it's part of the gifts that accompany
[56:19] the church okay so you can go to the
[56:20] next verse verse 18.
[56:23] and they'll take up serpents if they
[56:24] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[56:26] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[56:28] and they shall recover we see of course
[56:30] that one the most
[56:31] uh but everything else is a part of that
[56:34] these
[56:34] all follow uh believers praise god
[56:40] now if if if the condition gets like
[56:43] denominational churches then tongues
[56:45] without interpretations create a
[56:47] barbaric
[56:48] insane atmosphere according to paul paul
[56:51] says it's just
[56:52] barbaric no one even knows what's
[56:55] talking it reminds us of the tower of
[56:56] babel right
[56:58] that's what it reminds us of when
[56:59] everyone's speaking in unknown tongues
[57:01] and there's no interpretation
[57:04] uh so without an interpreter they're
[57:06] strictly for private prayer
[57:08] and individual edification
[57:12] god now first corinthians 12 30. can you
[57:16] pull it up there acacia
[57:18] uh clearly teaches not all christians
[57:21] speak with tongues
[57:25] okay so let's read that one first
[57:27] corinthians 12 30.
[57:29] it says uh have all gifts of healing do
[57:31] all speak with tongues
[57:33] do all interpret this ends almost every
[57:35] argument i've ever had or any debate
[57:37] about tongues
[57:38] because he clearly says not all speak
[57:40] with tongues
[57:42] but yet paul supported prophetic tongue
[57:45] so let's go to
[57:46] first corinthians 14 1-5 yet he truly
[57:49] supported
[57:50] prophetic tongues this is what we were
[57:53] saying a few weeks ago when we looked at
[57:54] this series that
[57:55] this is something that our church can
[57:57] pray for right
[57:58] our church should pray for uh prophecies
[58:01] uh for
[58:02] for all the operation of the gifts
[58:05] because the most people are going to be
[58:06] helped
[58:07] when something applies to all of us and
[58:10] prophecy normally applies to all of us
[58:12] because it will foretell us what's going
[58:14] to happen so we can make writing praise
[58:16] god
[58:17] follow after charity verse 1 and desire
[58:19] the spiritual gifts
[58:20] but rather that ye may prophesy
[58:23] for he that speaketh in an unknown
[58:25] tongue speaketh not unto
[58:27] men but unto god for no man
[58:28] understandeth him but howbeit in the
[58:30] spirit he speaketh mysteries
[58:33] but he that prophesies speaketh unto men
[58:35] to edification
[58:37] to exhortation and comfort he that
[58:39] speaketh in an unknown tongue edifies
[58:41] himself
[58:42] but he that prophesieth edifieth the
[58:45] church
[58:46] okay so paul clearly says the greater
[58:48] gift is prophecy
[58:50] because it helps everybody know the
[58:52] future
[58:53] praise god and again that's something we
[58:55] have to desire the bible said the reason
[58:57] we
[58:57] may not see it is because the bible says
[58:59] we don't desire it verse 1
[59:01] desire the spiritual gifts but rather
[59:03] that ye may
[59:04] prophesy i don't know i don't know about
[59:06] you but remember when van's dad was sick
[59:08] were we desiring a healing or not we
[59:11] prayed for it every service right for
[59:12] three weeks until it came
[59:15] we'll see it seems many times the gifts
[59:17] we desire most are divine healing and so
[59:19] we see it more
[59:21] but if we desire prophecy how many
[59:24] believe we'll see it more
[59:25] i believe that if we desire these gifts
[59:28] if we desire more people to be blessed
[59:30] more people to be edified i believe god
[59:32] will hear those prayers
[59:34] i believe that
[59:37] i remember you know the last time we had
[59:39] tongues in 2010 i remember that
[59:41] if i'm not mistaken 2010
[59:45] trying to think of the exact date maybe
[59:47] it was a little bit earlier
[59:49] i remember i was preaching on uh the
[59:51] gifts of i was doing a series on the
[59:52] gifts of the holy spirit
[59:55] and i remember the wednesday night
[59:56] before that before the easter
[59:58] uh it was at that waterloo church that
[1:00:00] tiny little church
[1:00:01] hole in the wall church that wednesday
[1:00:03] night at the end of service i danced
[1:00:04] around the front
[1:00:05] and i just praised god and i went to
[1:00:07] columbus i took my family to columbus
[1:00:09] that sunday and then the brother came in
[1:00:11] brother stephen came in
[1:00:12] and we still got on tape where he gave a
[1:00:14] unknown tongue and interpretation
[1:00:17] and it told that uh some people were
[1:00:19] dying spiritually
[1:00:20] and i but but that was the thought and i
[1:00:23] thought it was so striking i was just
[1:00:24] preaching on gifts and the anointing and
[1:00:27] all these i
[1:00:28] think i preached 34 gifts or 34 sermons
[1:00:30] on gifts
[1:00:31] and as i we i just got free in the
[1:00:33] spirit and we're just worshiping
[1:00:34] and the very next service we had a
[1:00:36] operation of unknown tongues
[1:00:38] interpretations
[1:00:39] i thought wow that i thought perhaps the
[1:00:42] minds of the people were in that mode
[1:00:44] right
[1:00:45] they were they were hearing about gifts
[1:00:47] they were stirred up about gifts i know
[1:00:49] i was because i was preaching on it
[1:00:50] right
[1:00:51] and then it happened and so the bible
[1:00:54] says
[1:00:55] desire them but desire that more people
[1:00:58] may be edified
[1:00:59] that the most people can be strengthened
[1:01:02] amen hallelujah
[1:01:08] and so paul strongly supports prophecy
[1:01:13] praise god and again the most recent one
[1:01:15] i've heard was 2013 when brother brooks
[1:01:18] prophesied those uh well-known preachers
[1:01:21] dying that was the
[1:01:22] most recent prophecy that i can remember
[1:01:24] as far as we're telling the future
[1:01:27] uh on the day of pentecost 120
[1:01:30] spirit-filled believers
[1:01:31] spoke in their native galilean tongues
[1:01:34] but here's from 17
[1:01:36] different regions heard them in their
[1:01:38] own language
[1:01:39] so all tongues were known and understood
[1:01:41] the modern churches of course
[1:01:43] air greatly they have instant constant
[1:01:47] uninterrupted unknown tongues and public
[1:01:50] services and all
[1:01:51] he leads to is confusion and chaos uh
[1:01:54] which god does not offer
[1:01:56] i remember in height in college i went
[1:01:57] with a couple of football players so my
[1:01:59] buddies
[1:01:59] won this church and at the end they all
[1:02:02] just spoke in tongues and prophesied i
[1:02:03] just had my
[1:02:04] head down and one of the guys who went
[1:02:06] on to the nfl went on to win a couple
[1:02:08] super bowls
[1:02:09] he came up afterwards and asked me said
[1:02:10] jesse was that right and i had to tell
[1:02:12] no that wasn't right
[1:02:14] uh because the bible says
[1:02:17] that leads to confusion and chaos and
[1:02:20] god is not the author of that
[1:02:25] but i'll say it like this uh i like at
[1:02:27] least that they're open to spiritual
[1:02:28] things happening right
[1:02:30] i like that don't you i like how they at
[1:02:34] least come to church expecting
[1:02:36] something supernatural to happen praise
[1:02:37] god that's what we need praise god we
[1:02:39] need
[1:02:40] constant revival amen that's what we
[1:02:43] need hallelujah
[1:02:45] they're wrong with it but i thank god
[1:02:47] that they're at least coming expecting
[1:02:48] something supernatural to happen that's
[1:02:50] a wonderful testimony
[1:02:52] i think now while peter preached in
[1:02:54] cornelius house
[1:02:56] the holy ghost fell upon the hearers who
[1:02:58] spoke in tongues
[1:03:00] and magnified god i'm going to read that
[1:03:02] acts 10 48.
[1:03:05] let's read that so see this is why we
[1:03:08] had that uh sermon we preached uh last
[1:03:10] month
[1:03:11] about the see and hear principle
[1:03:13] whenever the holy ghost fell
[1:03:14] you could see it you could hear it you
[1:03:16] would magnify god
[1:03:19] uh i'll say i said you know what let me
[1:03:21] read verse 46
[1:03:22] for they heard them speak with tongues
[1:03:24] and magnify god
[1:03:26] and then answered peter can any man
[1:03:28] forbid water that they will be baptized
[1:03:30] we just sing that song magnify the lord
[1:03:32] with me right and so
[1:03:33] when the holy ghost fell it caused them
[1:03:35] to speak in tongues
[1:03:37] and also magnify god amen
[1:03:41] because jesus said it's like a well it's
[1:03:42] like a well springing up
[1:03:44] and the water flows praise god it's like
[1:03:47] it's like
[1:03:47] you turn on the faucet praise god and
[1:03:49] the water comes pouring out
[1:03:51] amen that's the that's the holy spirit
[1:03:54] when they're born again the praises come
[1:03:56] out the glory comes out
[1:03:58] and the words come out you've got to
[1:04:00] praise your heavenly father the baby's
[1:04:01] got to call out the father
[1:04:03] i'm a father papa god amen and that's
[1:04:06] the word of the lord
[1:04:08] that we see from the scripture
[1:04:12] now acts 19 what a tremendous uh
[1:04:15] testimony of the 12 ephesians they spoke
[1:04:18] in tongues
[1:04:19] and prophesied what an encouragement to
[1:04:22] that church right
[1:04:24] because remember prophecy helps out the
[1:04:26] most people so all 12 must have been
[1:04:28] helped right
[1:04:29] or a large group of them the prophecy
[1:04:32] foretold
[1:04:33] something that was going to happen and
[1:04:34] no doubt it must have happened because
[1:04:36] the holy spirit doesn't lie how many can
[1:04:37] say amen to that
[1:04:38] the holy spirit does not lie so he spoke
[1:04:42] in a tongue
[1:04:43] prophesied and no doubt it came to pass
[1:04:47] because when you speak in the name of
[1:04:48] the lord it must come to pass
[1:04:50] if the conditions are met yeah we can
[1:04:52] say that too
[1:04:54] praise god so again tongues prophecy
[1:04:58] all go together
[1:05:01] and then the bible says if you speak in
[1:05:03] tongues and there's uh
[1:05:05] not an interpreter pray for the
[1:05:06] interpretation that's first corinthians
[1:05:08] 14 13. occasion can you hold it up there
[1:05:10] first corinthians 14 13.
[1:05:15] and this will be the last verse here
[1:05:18] first corinthians
[1:05:19] 14 13.
[1:05:22] wherefore let him that speaketh in an
[1:05:24] unknown tongue
[1:05:25] pray that he may interpret and so when
[1:05:29] i've seen that at churches
[1:05:30] and they all speak in tongues they never
[1:05:32] pray for interpretation they just pray
[1:05:34] in tongues and then move on and
[1:05:36] everybody seems to be enthusiastic
[1:05:39] but there's no prayer for the
[1:05:41] interpretation well there ought to be
[1:05:43] more prayer for the interpretations that
[1:05:45] more people
[1:05:46] can understand it praise god amen
[1:05:49] now interpretation of tongues we don't
[1:05:51] need to go in that gift because it's
[1:05:52] already
[1:05:52] directly connected to diverse kinds of
[1:05:55] tongues
[1:05:57] uh it takes uh someone just someone who
[1:06:00] has freely just speaks in tongues
[1:06:02] the other person just freely knows what
[1:06:04] to say i talked to
[1:06:05] one man i forget who it was now but he
[1:06:08] had the gift of interpretation it must
[1:06:09] have been from a denominational church
[1:06:11] and he said i just opened my mouth and
[1:06:13] the words come out he said i don't even
[1:06:15] know what i'm saying
[1:06:17] so the same thing is like with uh
[1:06:19] speaking in tongues right when it comes
[1:06:20] out many times you're not even sure what
[1:06:21] you're saying it just comes out right
[1:06:23] it just flows out and so i talked to
[1:06:26] that man i was just so impressed i was
[1:06:27] like wow
[1:06:28] he just opens his mouth now talk about
[1:06:30] trusting god
[1:06:32] right but that's the same kind of trust
[1:06:33] you have in god like if you have the
[1:06:34] gift of healing
[1:06:36] and you know someone's going to get
[1:06:37] healed when you pray for them
[1:06:39] right other people might be like oh how
[1:06:42] in the world
[1:06:42] could you do that how could you be so
[1:06:44] sure well god god
[1:06:46] was possessing my body amen god was
[1:06:48] possessing my mind
[1:06:50] he was possessing my thoughts he was
[1:06:51] possessing my words amen
[1:06:54] his word was in my mouth hallelujah amen
[1:06:57] that's that's how you know right it just
[1:07:01] he just takes all over praise god you're
[1:07:03] so possessed you're so
[1:07:04] filled that you're just yielded to the
[1:07:06] holy spirit my mother
[1:07:07] what i'm saying that's the greatest
[1:07:09] thing you can do is be united right
[1:07:11] master the human ability and be yielded
[1:07:13] to the holy spirit
[1:07:16] praise god so remember we follow
[1:07:20] charity so first we seek being born
[1:07:22] again
[1:07:23] and then desire the spiritual gifts and
[1:07:26] love is our absolute motivation we're
[1:07:29] commanded to desire
[1:07:31] uh and covet the best gifts the bible
[1:07:34] said first corinthians 12 31
[1:07:36] but earn it covet earnestly the best
[1:07:38] gifts
[1:07:39] yet i show yet show i unto you
[1:07:42] a more excellent way so we
[1:07:45] follow charity desire spiritual gifts
[1:07:48] earnestly
[1:07:49] covet the best gifts
[1:07:53] and this is something that i i feel like
[1:07:55] as message believers we have to be very
[1:07:57] concerned about right uh because a gift
[1:08:00] is like a
[1:08:01] it's like a portion of god's money right
[1:08:04] a gift is
[1:08:04] the word charisma it means uh a talent
[1:08:07] right it means
[1:08:08] something divine it means the divine
[1:08:10] gift of god
[1:08:11] and if god has entrusted us with a
[1:08:13] divine gift then we need to be
[1:08:15] accountable with it praise god we need
[1:08:17] to be uh responsible for it
[1:08:21] like i told you i've been entrusted with
[1:08:23] so many thousands of dollars for the
[1:08:25] book coming up i haven't spent it yet
[1:08:27] i'm entrusted with it i got to make sure
[1:08:28] it's spent the right way it's still
[1:08:30] sitting in the bank account right the
[1:08:31] church bank account
[1:08:33] can't touch it i'm just entrusted with
[1:08:34] it i got to make sure that's used the
[1:08:36] right way praise god
[1:08:38] and so it is with our lives if we have a
[1:08:39] gift we have to make sure it's used for
[1:08:41] god's glory
[1:08:43] and the thing is we've got to make sure
[1:08:44] we're available uh
[1:08:46] and we let make ourselves available for
[1:08:48] god to use us
[1:08:50] praise god
[1:08:53] like i said i don't know when this i
[1:08:54] don't know when this revival is going to
[1:08:55] come but i hope it's sometime soon in my
[1:08:57] lifetime praise god
[1:08:59] well i'm talking about the squeeze where
[1:09:00] we start seeing the third pole we start
[1:09:02] having this pressure right this this
[1:09:04] desire to get closer to god the desire
[1:09:06] to see the gifts operate right
[1:09:07] the desire for prophecy my think of it
[1:09:11] i mean that's what we want to see right
[1:09:12] we want to see the mighty god come on
[1:09:14] the scene
[1:09:14] we appreciate all he does for us we're
[1:09:17] so thankful for all he does for us
[1:09:18] but we look at the bible and the bible
[1:09:20] says we're to covet earnestly these best
[1:09:22] things
[1:09:23] we're to desire these great things where
[1:09:24] desire to hear prophecy
[1:09:26] and if we hadn't heard it for a while we
[1:09:28] should desire it praise god
[1:09:30] because the bible says desire prophecy
[1:09:33] that we
[1:09:34] can know the future that the whole
[1:09:35] church can be blessed
[1:09:37] amen
[1:09:42] and then the other side is maybe god
[1:09:44] doesn't want to send it at this time
[1:09:46] but yet we're still we're still supposed
[1:09:48] to desire it
[1:09:50] we're still supposed to be hungering and
[1:09:52] thirsting for god's gifts to operate
[1:09:57] all right now i want to read this quote
[1:09:59] brother branham
[1:10:00] uh gave us about gifts again i pulled it
[1:10:04] up here on my phone
[1:10:05] yeah it is the man said the church must
[1:10:08] believe
[1:10:09] every word every promise every iota and
[1:10:11] claim it for themselves
[1:10:13] and exercise themselves in it if i was
[1:10:16] engaged to a girl and i was a single man
[1:10:18] and i'd send her something an engagement
[1:10:20] ring and she wouldn't wear it
[1:10:22] then that show she doesn't believe me
[1:10:24] she doesn't want to be my bride
[1:10:26] and if christ sends
[1:10:29] his church the gifts that he promised
[1:10:31] and they refuse them and say they're not
[1:10:33] so
[1:10:34] they don't want to be the bride of
[1:10:35] christ their spouse is some other lover
[1:10:38] and not
[1:10:39] christ the bridegroom so the real church
[1:10:41] keeps the promise and keeps all
[1:10:43] and accepts the gifts that god sends
[1:10:46] them
[1:10:46] amen so see that's got to be our desire
[1:10:49] like a
[1:10:50] uh a spouse woman accepting the marriage
[1:10:54] uh ring right or the the engagement ring
[1:10:57] wow i'm gonna i'm gonna use this i'm
[1:10:59] gonna i'm gonna wear this
[1:11:00] uh i'm gonna possess this and that's
[1:11:02] what our attitude has to be with the
[1:11:04] gifts of god
[1:11:05] i'm gonna wear this i'm gonna let god
[1:11:07] use me like this praise god
[1:11:10] i'm gonna let god use me publicly for
[1:11:12] his glory and also of course privately
[1:11:14] as well
[1:11:15] so we must study our way we must uh
[1:11:18] study
[1:11:18] our gifts that we have in our lives and
[1:11:21] help god
[1:11:22] to help us or ask god to help us operate
[1:11:25] in them and we want to have a double
[1:11:27] return
[1:11:28] on our investment matthew 25 21 i'll
[1:11:31] turn there
[1:11:32] matthew 25 21 with a parable the talents
[1:11:37] i think 25 21.
[1:11:48] all right let's read actually 22 i'm
[1:11:50] sorry 20 20
[1:11:51] verse 20 as well and so that he had
[1:11:54] received five talents
[1:11:56] came and brought other five talents
[1:11:58] saying lord thou deliver us unto me
[1:12:00] five talents behold i have gained beside
[1:12:02] them five talents more
[1:12:04] his lord said to him well done thou good
[1:12:06] and faithful servant thou hast been
[1:12:07] faithful over a few things i'll make
[1:12:09] thee ruler over many things
[1:12:11] enter thou into the joy of the lord he
[1:12:14] also that had received two talents came
[1:12:16] and said lord
[1:12:17] thou deliver us unto me two talents
[1:12:18] behold i have gained two other talents
[1:12:20] beside them
[1:12:21] he said unto i'm sorry his lord said
[1:12:23] unto him well done good and faithful
[1:12:25] servant
[1:12:25] thou hast been faithful over a few
[1:12:27] things i'll make the ruler over many
[1:12:30] things
[1:12:30] enter thou into the joy of the lord then
[1:12:32] he which i received the one talent came
[1:12:34] and said lord i knew that thou
[1:12:36] art a hard man see like like they say uh
[1:12:39] our brother ramsay's god carries a a
[1:12:42] stick right a big stick
[1:12:43] see they're making god out to be this
[1:12:45] this this really
[1:12:47] angry person but he has to correct us
[1:12:49] right
[1:12:50] and so this is the kind of attitude that
[1:12:52] buries a talent
[1:12:54] in the ground reaping where thou is not
[1:12:57] sown and gathering whether that's not
[1:12:59] straw and i was afraid and went and hid
[1:13:01] thy town in the earth lo
[1:13:03] there thou hast that is thine so fear
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:08] fear kept this person from operating
[1:13:10] their god-given talents
[1:13:12] and so the only way to get rid of fear
[1:13:15] is to have love right
[1:13:16] because love casts out all fear praise
[1:13:18] god
[1:13:19] how do you fall in love more jesus keep
[1:13:21] his commands praise god
[1:13:23] keep his commands uh fellowship with him
[1:13:26] open your heart to him right
[1:13:27] let jesus come in sup with him and he
[1:13:29] with you
[1:13:32] all right so we see it's uh investment
[1:13:35] into
[1:13:36] the spiritual gifts
[1:13:41] how many want to be jesus bride then
[1:13:43] we've got to wear the wedding
[1:13:45] got to wear the wedding gear praise god
[1:13:47] the engagement ring
[1:13:48] and anything else jesus gives us we got
[1:13:51] to wear it
[1:13:52] so let's go back quickly
[1:13:56] are you wearing it uh are you wearing
[1:13:58] the the ring of wisdom tonight
[1:14:01] gotta wear it gotta show it right gotta
[1:14:04] show the world
[1:14:05] are you wearing the ring of knowledge
[1:14:06] tonight
[1:14:08] we gotta show it you gotta say god thank
[1:14:11] you lord
[1:14:12] thank you let me let me be a light and
[1:14:14] everybody knows i'm married to you jesus
[1:14:17] and not bury that not take off that ring
[1:14:19] and put it away in the drawer and forget
[1:14:21] about it
[1:14:22] so nobody sees it we got to be available
[1:14:25] for god to use us praise god
[1:14:27] god say lord use me in my home use me at
[1:14:29] the church
[1:14:30] use me on the job amen
[1:14:33] use me at school are you wearing the
[1:14:36] engagement ring of faith do you have
[1:14:38] faith that moves mountains
[1:14:40] how about healing divine healing where
[1:14:42] you pray for the sick
[1:14:44] and eventually they recover how about
[1:14:47] the ring of miracles
[1:14:49] where god anoints your faith and
[1:14:51] instantly things happen right there you
[1:14:52] don't have to wait
[1:14:53] happens right there miracles how about
[1:14:56] prophecy like i said this one's hard to
[1:14:58] come by right
[1:15:01] you have the ring of prophecy where god
[1:15:03] anoints you
[1:15:05] to foretell the future or how about the
[1:15:08] ring of discernment being able to judge
[1:15:10] what is that person's motive what is
[1:15:12] that person's objective
[1:15:14] which spirit is behind this person's
[1:15:16] words or actions
[1:15:18] are we letting uh jesus's ring shine
[1:15:21] praise god
[1:15:22] and how about uh tongues are we speaking
[1:15:25] when god wants us to speak are we
[1:15:27] willing to open our mouths
[1:15:29] and speak are we willing to open our
[1:15:31] mouths and interpret
[1:15:32] right are we in the ring of god's
[1:15:34] tongue's interpretation
[1:15:39] and so that's a good uh that's a good
[1:15:41] summary of that
[1:15:42] as bill graham says if we're jesus's
[1:15:44] bride we'll wear the ring
[1:15:46] praise god we'll accept what he's given
[1:15:48] to us
[1:15:49] and we'll study it we'll invest it and
[1:15:52] we'll know what we got on how anyone
[1:15:54] know what they got on praise god amen
[1:15:56] praise god you ever heard of anybody any
[1:15:59] man giving a woman
[1:16:00] a wife an engagement ring and she don't
[1:16:03] even know what it looks like or anything
[1:16:04] i mean that's the whole point of it
[1:16:05] right so you can see what it looks like
[1:16:07] and
[1:16:07] see how pretty it is and man they spent
[1:16:09] some money on me they must really love
[1:16:11] me
[1:16:13] not that you know that right that really
[1:16:15] means anything you know as far as
[1:16:17] natural things of gold and uh you know
[1:16:19] money or diamonds or anything like that
[1:16:22] but it's the idea behind it's the love
[1:16:23] behind it
[1:16:25] and so jesus wants us to show everybody
[1:16:28] our life we have to be that city on a
[1:16:30] hill
[1:16:30] that cannot be hidden praise god so
[1:16:32] don't let your wisdom be hidden
[1:16:34] right don't let the tongues be hidden
[1:16:35] don't let the miracles or the prophecy
[1:16:37] or the faith don't let that be hidden or
[1:16:40] the word of knowledge
[1:16:42] we cannot let these things go hidden in
[1:16:44] our lives
[1:16:45] we gotta let god we gotta let we gotta
[1:16:48] wear it so then god can use it
[1:16:51] all right now uh the next part of this
[1:16:53] chapter after
[1:16:54] uh defining the gifts and giving
[1:16:56] examples uh i share
[1:16:59] how i feel i found god's will for my
[1:17:01] life i'm almost 40
[1:17:05] married with eight children how humbly
[1:17:08] how do i believe that i'm in the perfect
[1:17:10] will of god for my life
[1:17:14] how would i how would i judge that
[1:17:18] well i look at relationships i i first
[1:17:20] talk about my wife and i'm meeting in
[1:17:22] the sandbox you know we both
[1:17:23] repented and got saved on the same night
[1:17:25] and then we were both open to god
[1:17:28] changing uh our desires
[1:17:31] but we prayed about it we had multiple
[1:17:33] meetings with pastors and marriage
[1:17:35] couples we didn't jump into anything we
[1:17:36] didn't hurry into anything right
[1:17:39] we waited for god's peace to settle in
[1:17:41] our hearts and lives we looked at each
[1:17:44] other's strengths and weaknesses and
[1:17:46] uh and felt led then to get married
[1:17:50] and that's still the second happiest day
[1:17:51] of my life right after the day we got
[1:17:53] saved
[1:17:55] there's four that's 40 minutes already
[1:17:57] goodness
[1:17:58] somebody tell that clock he's a busy
[1:17:59] busy body and he needs to stop
[1:18:01] stop turning so fast uh let me try to
[1:18:04] yeah let me finish this and i'll close
[1:18:05] here
[1:18:06] uh so relationships so again you don't
[1:18:09] rush into it but yet we know people that
[1:18:10] have known right away like brother cam
[1:18:12] he and julian knew right away that at
[1:18:13] the court very long
[1:18:14] they just knew right away they were to
[1:18:16] be married by the will of god
[1:18:21] and so we have to look at our
[1:18:22] relationships is that in the will of god
[1:18:25] i like uh i shouldn't share that that's
[1:18:27] more personal i shouldn't share that one
[1:18:28] so
[1:18:28] i won't share that one um
[1:18:33] but i'll say this many times the
[1:18:35] relationship is where people fall away
[1:18:37] from the perfect will of god
[1:18:38] now understand that how sad is that
[1:18:40] people are willing to live in the
[1:18:42] permissive will of god
[1:18:43] on this earth knowingly living in the
[1:18:46] permissive will of god and just
[1:18:47] hope for heaven someday i can imagine
[1:18:50] that
[1:18:50] just for some temporary earthly
[1:18:53] pleasures
[1:18:54] they're willing to forsake god's perfect
[1:18:56] will where they could
[1:18:58] they they could manifest god's presence
[1:19:00] greater than any other way
[1:19:01] they'd rather enjoy some fleshly
[1:19:03] pleasures rather than
[1:19:04] do god's perfect will that illustration
[1:19:08] francis chan used
[1:19:09] he had a rope and it was stretched
[1:19:11] across the entire
[1:19:13] platform and he colored the very end of
[1:19:15] it red
[1:19:17] and he said this is your life this red
[1:19:19] line
[1:19:20] this red painted part of the rope way
[1:19:22] over here
[1:19:24] this is your earthly life and you're
[1:19:26] gonna live in pleasure
[1:19:27] for that little red part and and not
[1:19:30] take into consideration the rest of this
[1:19:32] rope that stretches all the way across
[1:19:34] you're gonna you're gonna try to live in
[1:19:37] pleasure and
[1:19:38] and you're gonna take a chance with the
[1:19:40] rest of that rope just in that little
[1:19:42] bit of time there at the beginning of
[1:19:44] the rope
[1:19:46] the bible says make your calling and
[1:19:48] election sure praise god
[1:19:52] the bible says set your affections on
[1:19:54] things above
[1:19:56] we should look at the rope of our lives
[1:19:58] right and see that little red
[1:19:59] line and say wow i want that red line to
[1:20:02] count for jesus
[1:20:03] so i can live eternally with jesus
[1:20:05] christ praise god
[1:20:08] i think that's a great illustration i've
[1:20:09] always wanted to get him rope and do
[1:20:10] that i just forget about it
[1:20:13] that little air that little place is so
[1:20:16] important
[1:20:18] now vocations
[1:20:22] i thought i would be a doctor boy was i
[1:20:24] wrong on that
[1:20:26] when i got to school i thought i could
[1:20:27] never do that that many classes
[1:20:30] but i walk into a classroom and i fall
[1:20:31] in love with the kids
[1:20:34] i didn't even know what i was about to
[1:20:35] do and then god
[1:20:37] opened up the teaching job for me after
[1:20:39] prayer and fasting and seeking the lord
[1:20:42] going to church
[1:20:43] there was 800 applicants for two
[1:20:44] positions and i got one of them with no
[1:20:46] with no experience
[1:20:47] so that was all god and then we do the
[1:20:50] bible clubs the last five years of
[1:20:52] course they're canceled now
[1:20:53] but hundreds of children and teens have
[1:20:55] heard the gospel
[1:20:57] because i've got the job there and i
[1:20:59] thank the lord for that
[1:21:01] and i even got to baptize three people
[1:21:03] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:21:05] i've invited them for bible studies and
[1:21:07] more to come to church they haven't come
[1:21:08] but
[1:21:09] i got to at least baptize them in the
[1:21:10] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:21:14] the first case second was pastoring when
[1:21:17] we started the church here in 2006
[1:21:20] we waited on the lord and then felt led
[1:21:22] to it brother brooks ordained it and so
[1:21:24] it's all been done
[1:21:25] according to the god we know churches
[1:21:27] where uh there wasn't a preacher that
[1:21:29] started the church the
[1:21:31] family just part of the church and no
[1:21:32] one ordained it but that's not apostolic
[1:21:35] apostolic is having a preacher ordain
[1:21:37] another preacher
[1:21:38] right because he sees the gift of god
[1:21:40] he's got to get through god
[1:21:42] and that gift of god recognizes another
[1:21:44] gift of god
[1:21:45] and so that's the way the early church
[1:21:46] started paul told titus few ordained
[1:21:49] elders in every city titus was a pastor
[1:21:52] you ordained so pastors ordained pastors
[1:21:54] right or
[1:21:55] it could be missionaries yeah apostles
[1:21:58] ordained pastors
[1:22:00] and so it started the right way i
[1:22:02] believe by god's grace
[1:22:08] and i prayed and fasted before preaching
[1:22:10] so i can look at my vocations and i
[1:22:12] believe i'm in the perfect will of god i
[1:22:14] can't think of a time where i missed
[1:22:15] god's will
[1:22:17] now the next is your location i've only
[1:22:19] lived in two places in my life toledo
[1:22:20] and akron and i didn't ask to come to
[1:22:22] akron god opened that up
[1:22:24] use football to bring me here but of
[1:22:25] course we know i know
[1:22:27] the reason was greater it was a
[1:22:28] spiritual purpose i left everything i
[1:22:31] ever knew and loved
[1:22:33] and god showed me his love and i got
[1:22:36] saved into akron or here in columbus
[1:22:38] and then back to akron and i've never
[1:22:41] felt god's leading to leave this city at
[1:22:43] all
[1:22:44] now some people remember we looked at
[1:22:46] abraham he had 15 times he moved at
[1:22:47] least 15 times
[1:22:49] each time sometimes it was his will
[1:22:51] sometimes it was god's will right
[1:22:54] but a christian is open to god's leading
[1:22:58] right
[1:22:58] god leading you somewhere else or god
[1:23:00] keeping you in one place
[1:23:01] a christian is open to that
[1:23:06] uh and many times church with with with
[1:23:08] people in the permissive with the god
[1:23:09] they're running from where they should
[1:23:11] be
[1:23:11] right like a lot of people i've seen
[1:23:13] people they move away from a good church
[1:23:17] everybody needs a home church every
[1:23:18] sheep needs a shepherd right but many
[1:23:20] times people get in the permissive will
[1:23:22] of god because they move away
[1:23:24] from where god wanted them usually for
[1:23:26] money like lot
[1:23:27] right or maybe because of hard times and
[1:23:30] it's a test like abraham when the famine
[1:23:32] came he failed the test and went down to
[1:23:34] egypt and lied about his wife and
[1:23:36] he's gotten all kinds of trouble right
[1:23:37] because of pressures
[1:23:39] and cares of the world
[1:23:42] and so it takes it takes courage it
[1:23:45] takes faith
[1:23:46] to stay where god's called you right and
[1:23:49] to find where god's called you and also
[1:23:52] to move
[1:23:52] if god calls you some other place
[1:23:58] the next is ministries my main
[1:24:02] my family's main ministries to provide
[1:24:04] three weekly church services and then of
[1:24:06] course fellowships and everything
[1:24:08] and my children serve in the music
[1:24:10] ministry can you pull up a second
[1:24:12] chronicles i'm sorry first chronicles 25
[1:24:14] 1. i remember the scripture i don't know
[1:24:16] if you remember the scripture but i want
[1:24:17] to
[1:24:17] read this one again here tonight
[1:24:23] first chronicles 25 1-6
[1:24:28] moreover david and the captains of the
[1:24:30] host separated to the service of the
[1:24:31] sons of asaph
[1:24:32] and of he-man and of uh judathon who
[1:24:36] should
[1:24:36] prophesy with harps with sultries and
[1:24:39] with symbols
[1:24:40] and the number of the workmen according
[1:24:41] to their service
[1:24:43] and in verse two he gives those who
[1:24:45] prophesied according to the order of the
[1:24:47] king
[1:24:48] verse three
[1:24:52] i'm going to skip that who prophesied
[1:24:53] with a harp to give thanks and praise to
[1:24:55] the lord
[1:24:56] so david ordains all these people some
[1:24:59] had the gift of prophesy in verse two
[1:25:01] some have the gift to prophesy with harp
[1:25:04] in verse three and some
[1:25:05] gave thanks and praise to the lord
[1:25:07] everybody had to give now look at that
[1:25:09] some people had a gift to give thanks
[1:25:12] some people had a gift to give praise
[1:25:14] amen some people had a gift to prophesy
[1:25:17] right
[1:25:18] so everybody has a place but we got to
[1:25:21] find our place amen
[1:25:24] and then the one i like is about the
[1:25:25] children verse four of
[1:25:27] command these are his sons
[1:25:30] and now go to verse five all these were
[1:25:33] the sons of haman the king's seer in the
[1:25:35] words
[1:25:36] of god to lift up the horn and god gave
[1:25:39] him and fourteen sons and three
[1:25:41] daughters
[1:25:42] all these were under the hands of their
[1:25:44] father for song
[1:25:45] in the house of the lord with symbols
[1:25:47] sultries and harps for the service
[1:25:50] of the house of god according to the
[1:25:52] king's order to asap
[1:25:54] jeduthan and haman and the number of
[1:25:57] them with their brethren that were
[1:25:58] instructed in the songs the lord even
[1:26:00] all that were cunning was 200
[1:26:02] four score and eight 288. god had 288
[1:26:07] people just focus on the music ministry
[1:26:10] talk about a revival my 288 people that
[1:26:14] were born the bible said
[1:26:15] they were born right the bible said they
[1:26:18] were under the head of their father
[1:26:20] in the house of lord for the service of
[1:26:22] the house of god
[1:26:23] they were born and david placed them in
[1:26:26] the house of god
[1:26:27] for music for thanks for prophecy for
[1:26:30] harps amen
[1:26:32] god did that praise god
[1:26:35] and so god does the same today i feel
[1:26:37] like that scripture really speaks to me
[1:26:38] with my eight children
[1:26:40] uh that our children my wife and i our
[1:26:42] children are
[1:26:43] for song in the house of the lord for
[1:26:45] the service of the house of god
[1:26:52] now if you gave me a choice tonight and
[1:26:55] i i could have all my sports talents or
[1:26:58] playing the piano like malachi i would
[1:26:59] trade and malachi could have the sports
[1:27:01] and i would take the piano
[1:27:03] my wife knows i like i pretend like i
[1:27:05] could sing like all these guys all the
[1:27:06] time
[1:27:08] right you know air guitar
[1:27:11] there's something part of me i wish i
[1:27:12] could do that and we know that's way
[1:27:15] more important right that's way more
[1:27:16] valuable
[1:27:17] than natural things but yet god had a
[1:27:19] plan for it god can use it
[1:27:21] uh to get you to where get me to where
[1:27:23] he wanted me to be
[1:27:24] but that's a ministry and uh
[1:27:27] you can see from the scripture a man had
[1:27:30] all these children in
[1:27:32] order that they could praise god amen
[1:27:34] that was his ministry his family's
[1:27:35] ministry
[1:27:36] was the praise give thanks to god
[1:27:39] worship god
[1:27:40] prophesy with harps and lift up the name
[1:27:42] of the lord that was god's will for his
[1:27:44] life amen
[1:27:47] it's my joy through the preaching and
[1:27:48] the deacon work and the financial work
[1:27:50] and some of the trusty work it's my joy
[1:27:52] to do that
[1:27:53] our church also supports missionaries
[1:27:55] the poor needy
[1:27:56] bible studies whatever people need it's
[1:27:58] been a while since we had some but
[1:28:00] uh people every now and then need them
[1:28:03] and then the video making ministry the
[1:28:05] book ministry that's uh
[1:28:07] taking the gospel spreading the truth
[1:28:10] the bible says preachers are to proclaim
[1:28:12] the gospel right
[1:28:13] we herald the gospel which means
[1:28:15] announce the gospel and that's what
[1:28:16] those ministries do they announce the
[1:28:18] true revelation
[1:28:19] they announce the word of god for this
[1:28:21] hour
[1:28:22] remember i waited on that for almost 10
[1:28:24] years i waited on that ministry of
[1:28:26] the books and the video making ministry
[1:28:29] and then also the gifts of the holy
[1:28:31] spirit i've
[1:28:32] a lot of those examples i gave were from
[1:28:34] my own life where i've seen god use me
[1:28:36] through preaching
[1:28:36] and faith healing miracles discernment
[1:28:40] but john 15 5 is is my uh life scripture
[1:28:43] jesus said i am the vine ye are the
[1:28:45] branches he that abideth in me and i
[1:28:48] in him the same bringeth forth much
[1:28:50] fruit for without
[1:28:51] me ye can do nothing praise god church
[1:28:54] you and i are nothing without
[1:28:56] jesus we have no talent we have no money
[1:28:58] we have no ability without jesus we're
[1:29:00] absolutely nothing and jesus is
[1:29:02] everything praise god
[1:29:04] when gifts are you search we feel
[1:29:06] unconscious of it right
[1:29:09] many times we're just unconscious
[1:29:11] because god
[1:29:12] gently and mercifully anoints us to help
[1:29:14] other people
[1:29:17] i told you sometimes i feel extremely
[1:29:19] zealous that's something
[1:29:21] many times that's happened i'm zealous
[1:29:24] but sometimes it's gentle sometimes it's
[1:29:25] merciful
[1:29:27] uh in any supernatural work jesus he
[1:29:30] captures our entire thought process
[1:29:32] process right
[1:29:33] the bible said be transformed by the
[1:29:35] renewing of your mind and then you can
[1:29:37] prove the perfect will of god
[1:29:39] so in all these areas right with
[1:29:40] ministries and family and location and
[1:29:42] vocation and
[1:29:44] and gifts of the holy spirit all these
[1:29:47] can be proven it's either the perfect
[1:29:49] will
[1:29:49] or it's the permissible of god but it
[1:29:52] takes a transformed mind to do that
[1:29:57] as we said you lay yourself on god's
[1:29:58] altar present your body living sacrifice
[1:30:02] lay aside your thoughts your time your
[1:30:04] plans your preferences
[1:30:06] and then be a living sacrifice with a
[1:30:09] transformed mind
[1:30:14] i'm gonna have to finish this next time
[1:30:15] let's stay in our feet because i i kind
[1:30:16] of want to go
[1:30:17] further i better stop so i got to work
[1:30:19] tomorrow i got a long day tomorrow i got
[1:30:20] like a
[1:30:20] 12-hour day tomorrow we got conferences
[1:30:22] so i don't want to kill
[1:30:24] or kill myself or anything like that
[1:30:26] musicians if you'll come by god's grace
[1:30:28] so church sharing all that i asked
[1:30:29] myself and i've asked the readers lord
[1:30:31] willing
[1:30:32] uh have i missed god's will for my life
[1:30:35] in any of those areas
[1:30:38] have i refused any open doors
[1:30:41] have i broken any command now i've
[1:30:44] fallen short in areas of my life
[1:30:46] but as far as where i live and my job
[1:30:48] and uh my family my marriage my gifts
[1:30:51] i don't i look at that and i i can't see
[1:30:54] where i have have i refused any open
[1:30:56] door i don't
[1:30:57] i haven't seen one have i broken any
[1:31:00] major command
[1:31:04] that's the question i ask myself and
[1:31:05] that's the question i want all of us ask
[1:31:07] ourselves
[1:31:11] as we look at on sunday night with
[1:31:12] blessings and curses some mistakes they
[1:31:14] will have a lasting punishment right
[1:31:17] others are smaller and they don't have
[1:31:19] that lasting impact
[1:31:24] but that's the that's the question we
[1:31:25] need to ask lord
[1:31:27] am i doing your perfect will i want to
[1:31:29] know your perfect will so let's go our
[1:31:30] heads
[1:31:31] and let's ask the lord that in a word of
[1:31:32] prayer tonight
[1:31:35] [Music]
[1:31:37] heavenly father god would just come
[1:31:39] reverently again before your throne as
[1:31:40] we
[1:31:41] bring a close to the preaching of your
[1:31:43] word
[1:31:44] lords and i have declared more of your
[1:31:47] gifts i finished the gifts
[1:31:49] as you've taught me through study
[1:31:57] as i've labored in doctrine as that
[1:31:59] scripture comes to my mind
[1:32:01] [Music]
[1:32:06] you show me all these examples you
[1:32:08] reminded me of all these examples
[1:32:12] lord your prophet said they're like
[1:32:14] weddings engage your friends
[1:32:24] we recognize god that you've sent these
[1:32:26] gifts in our lives
[1:32:28] the bible says they're given to every
[1:32:30] man and every woman the prophet
[1:32:33] [Music]
[1:32:36] so all the married men have rings on
[1:32:41] [Music]
