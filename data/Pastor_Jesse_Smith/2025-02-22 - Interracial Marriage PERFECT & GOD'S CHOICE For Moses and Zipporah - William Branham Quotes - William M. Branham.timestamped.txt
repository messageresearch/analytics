[0:02] and maram show her try too when she
[0:05] laughed because Moses married this Negro
[0:08] girl no brother what God does is
[0:13] perfect and there one day we find out
[0:17] that even Mariam a
[0:19] prophet and Aaron the high priest made
[0:23] fun of Moses wife because she was an
[0:27] Ethiopian that wasn't Moses choice that
[0:30] was God's choice for Moses
[0:33] [Music]
[0:34] amen greetings friends in the matchless
[0:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:39] purpose of this video is to share
[0:40] another wonderful quotation from God's
[0:42] Prophet brother William brandham about
[0:44] the interracial marriage of Moses and
[0:46] Zapora by God's grace this is sort of a
[0:49] follow-up to the video I put out on
[0:51] January 21st 2025 about uh addressing
[0:55] criticism for three of my videos
[0:58] released in the past which were
[1:00] interracial marriage Minister's marriage
[1:03] requirements and the Order of events of
[1:05] the seven-year Great Tribulation period
[1:07] so again this video is done of course in
[1:09] brotherly kindness and respect to anyone
[1:11] who might criticize me I love the
[1:13] quotation brother Brandon made we ought
[1:15] to be able to disagree bitterly but then
[1:17] at the end of any disagreement ought to
[1:18] shake hands hug and still think just as
[1:21] much as the individual we disagree with
[1:24] as Christ thinks of them so let's listen
[1:26] to that quote by the grace of God see if
[1:29] you can't disagree with a man in things
[1:30] then shake his hand and still have the
[1:32] same feelings towards him then there's
[1:34] something wrong with you if I can't
[1:36] disagree with a man bitterly from one
[1:39] side to the other and still think as
[1:40] much of him as as Christ would then
[1:43] there's something wrong with my spirit I
[1:45] haven't the spirit of Christ now in this
[1:47] case I'm not naming the one who
[1:49] criticizes me I don't think I've
[1:52] actually met this person who's criticize
[1:54] me but I've heard him preach live a few
[1:57] times by the grace of God I was
[1:58] thoroughly blessed and as I said in my
[2:00] previous video this brother is probably
[2:03] my favorite preacher as far as the one
[2:05] God has used to give me the most
[2:07] understanding of the Bible and brother
[2:09] bram's message by the grace of God so
[2:12] the inspiration for this video was this
[2:14] week I was studying on the book of
[2:15] Corinthians and I was listening to
[2:17] brother Ram sermon from 1957 about
[2:20] Corinthians book of Correction and
[2:22] brother random mentioned Moses and
[2:23] Zapora and how Moses married Zapora in
[2:27] Ethiopian so no doubt she was dark-
[2:30] skinned and Miriam and Aaron criticized
[2:34] Moses for this marriage and brother
[2:35] brandham said what God does is perfect
[2:39] brother Ram said God did it so God put
[2:41] Moses and Zapora together it was a
[2:43] perfect marriage God did it brother Rand
[2:46] said if I could explain it then I'd be
[2:48] equal with God I can't explain it I just
[2:50] believe it that's all that's all I'm
[2:52] asked to do so this really jumped out to
[2:54] me I'd forgotten that brother Bram had
[2:56] said this that he called Moses's and
[2:58] Zapora marriage God's work of perfection
[3:02] so just in my humble opinion this seems
[3:04] like it was the perfect will of God for
[3:06] Moses and Zapora to Mary since brother
[3:08] Ram uses that word perfect we know
[3:10] according to Romans 121:2 that there's
[3:12] such a thing as the perfect will of God
[3:15] and of course in the Old Testament we
[3:16] can see lots of examples of the
[3:18] permissive will of God such as Hezekiah
[3:20] taking the permissive will of God and
[3:22] getting 15 more years of life when he
[3:25] didn't honor God with those 15 years let
[3:27] me know if you want scriptural
[3:28] references for these examples and also
[3:31] balum took the permissive will of God in
[3:32] the Book of Numbers he was not supposed
[3:34] to go down with Bao but he went back and
[3:36] asked God for a second opinion and so
[3:38] God gave him his permissive will and
[3:40] Friends remember we can prove by the
[3:42] Bible that God approved and ordained
[3:44] interracial marriages at least six times
[3:47] here's the examples Moses and zapor
[3:49] number one Joseph and azth number two
[3:52] Ruth and Boaz number three Uriah and
[3:55] basba number four Rahab and salon number
[3:59] five and Timothy's Jewish mother and
[4:02] Greek father their marriage of course
[4:05] produced Timothy and Timothy was
[4:06] baptized with the Holy Ghost and no one
[4:08] was more like-minded as the prophet
[4:10] brother Paul as his son in the gospel
[4:13] Timothy so that's so awesome to see that
[4:15] a person born out of interracial
[4:17] marriage could be the most like-minded
[4:19] to a prophet of God even though he
[4:21] wasn't a prophet but God can save people
[4:24] who are the result of an interracial
[4:26] marriage and also baptize them with the
[4:28] baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost what a
[4:30] beautiful Story by the grace of God so
[4:33] let's listen to this quote from
[4:34] Corinthians book of Correction April
[4:36] 14th
[4:38] 1957 and maram showed her Cy to when she
[4:42] laughed because Moses married this Negro
[4:44] girl and said wasn't there other girls
[4:46] to be married and so forth he could done
[4:48] it and God wasn't pleased with that and
[4:51] smot her with an leprosy and her own
[4:54] brother screamed out and said would you
[4:55] let your sister die in that shape and
[4:58] God told Moses to come come before him
[5:00] and he went and interceded for for
[5:02] marrying she didn't live long after that
[5:05] no brother what God does is
[5:09] perfect we ain't got no business with
[5:12] our minds putting anything to it just
[5:15] leave it the way it is God did it God
[5:18] said it that settles it just take it I
[5:21] don't know how if I could explain it
[5:23] then I'd be equal with God I can't
[5:25] explain it I just believe it amen huh
[5:29] that's all I'm asked to
[5:31] do next let's listen to this other quote
[5:34] from respects October 15th evening
[5:38] 1961 where brother Ram said that was
[5:41] God's choice God's choice for Moses so a
[5:45] black woman was God's choice for Moses
[5:48] God put together and ordained this
[5:50] interracial marriage let's listen to the
[5:52] quote and there one day we find out that
[5:56] even Mariam a propheus and Aon the high
[6:00] priest made fun of moses'
[6:04] wife because she was an Ethiopian and
[6:08] thought was there enough women of our
[6:09] own group to marry instead of going down
[6:12] there and marrying that woman that
[6:14] wasn't Moses choice that was God's
[6:16] choice for Moses
[6:18] amen and when they made fun of it that
[6:22] angered God in such a
[6:24] way until he struck Miriam the prophetes
[6:27] full of leprosy Moses own sister what
[6:31] about that her a
[6:35] prophetess but what was she doing she
[6:38] was making fun in an irreverence to
[6:41] God's messenger amen the messenger of
[6:44] the Covenant of that
[6:45] day and she was irreverent and also
[6:49] Aaron the high priest the very mouthpie
[6:52] of Moses yes right so I'll just share a
[6:56] few more things here before the close of
[6:58] the video remember that Jesus Christ is
[7:00] the same yesterday today and forever
[7:01] according to Hebrews 138 so it was the
[7:03] Lord Jesus his spirit that ordained
[7:05] Moses and Zapora to Mary along with
[7:07] these other five examples in interracial
[7:09] marriages and friends again interracial
[7:11] marriage is probably a very rare thing
[7:14] amongst most people groups in the world
[7:16] today so I'm not advocating that every
[7:18] single person do an interracial marriage
[7:21] I'm simply saying that there's times God
[7:23] ordains it and allows it just as we can
[7:25] see plainly in the Bible amongst
[7:27] Believers I went back and listen to the
[7:30] sermon that criticized me from the
[7:32] wonderful brother and I'll share about
[7:35] three other statements that he made the
[7:37] first statement was preachers like me
[7:39] don't believe the messenger now I would
[7:41] say again this is nonsense the truth is
[7:44] that we have quotes on both sides of
[7:46] this interracial marriage issue so what
[7:48] do we do we take everything back to the
[7:51] word of God the Bible is our absolute
[7:53] brother Ram said the Holy Ghost will
[7:55] only point you back to the word of God
[7:57] brother Ram says the holy ghost in the
[7:58] word is the dissolver of all doubts so
[8:01] when there's doubts and we see quotes on
[8:03] both sides of a topic we got to go back
[8:05] to the word of God remember brother Ram
[8:07] taught us every Doctrine must go from
[8:09] Genesis to Revelation or agree with all
[8:12] the scriptures from Genesis to
[8:13] Revelation so that's what we do we go
[8:15] back to the word of God the real
[8:17] question that I would ask to our
[8:18] precious brother who criticizes me is do
[8:21] you believe these quotes about Moses and
[8:24] Zapora being God's choice for Moses and
[8:26] it being the perfect will of God or was
[8:28] a perfect choice of God to choose Zapora
[8:32] in Ethiopian for Moses so again I
[8:35] believe the message of the hour but the
[8:37] message of the hour is the word of God
[8:38] that God is vindicating today from the
[8:40] Bible as brother Ram said in the Rapture
[8:42] message 1965 the message of the hour is
[8:45] not every human thought on the tapes of
[8:48] brother brandham so I would encourage
[8:50] all of our viewers to understand that
[8:52] the message of the hour is the
[8:54] scriptures God is vindicating today and
[8:56] also I would just humbly say maybe it's
[8:58] not us who can see interracial marriage
[9:01] as ordained of God in the Bible that
[9:02] don't believe the message maybe it's the
[9:04] brother criticizing that doesn't really
[9:07] believe all the message because it seems
[9:09] like he's not believing these quotes
[9:11] that are on this video from Corinthians
[9:13] book of Correction and respects and that
[9:15] could be again because this precious
[9:17] brother has a complex that he's built up
[9:19] in his mind and he's unable to take this
[9:22] topic to the word of God in one place I
[9:24] remember the brother said how can I
[9:25] stare at these quotes against
[9:27] interracial marriage and meet God with
[9:29] well you have to also stare at the
[9:31] quotes from the Bible where God ordains
[9:33] interracial marriage and when you stare
[9:35] at all the quotes you'll find the
[9:36] revelation of the Holy Ghost in the
[9:38] Bible is that God ordains interracial
[9:40] marriage on certain occasions not in
[9:42] every marriage of course but only when
[9:45] God ordains it and again humbly some
[9:48] preachers are just so dogmatic they
[9:49] can't learn anything they don't want to
[9:51] learn anything they don't want to open
[9:52] up their hearts to further revelation of
[9:54] the Holy Ghost but brother man taught us
[9:56] never put a period after a belief put a
[9:58] comma and brother Ram said God will
[10:00] never change the Revelation but will
[10:02] give more information about the same
[10:04] Revelation brother Ram said that in the
[10:05] church age book the second criticism
[10:08] from the preacher was that you don't go
[10:10] along with certain things brother
[10:11] Brandon preached but again I can say the
[10:13] same thing about the brother who's
[10:15] criticizing me you're not going along
[10:17] with these other quotes that brother
[10:18] Brandon preached about interracial
[10:19] marriage brother brand said God put a
[10:22] perfect marriage together for Moses and
[10:23] Zapora an interracial marriage was
[10:25] perfect and it was God's choice to do
[10:27] that it was God's Perfect Choice
[10:29] to allow an interracial marriage so
[10:32] again why doesn't our precious brother
[10:34] go along with these quotes and one
[10:36] thought I also had was that perhaps this
[10:38] brother who's criticizing me and other
[10:40] brothers they are trying to live in both
[10:43] camps one of the camps is sinful the
[10:46] sinful Camp is brother brandom is
[10:48] infallible that's an evil spirit that
[10:50] would say that and maybe this precious
[10:53] brother doesn't even know he's going in
[10:54] that direction but he's basically trying
[10:56] to make every thought and opinion of
[10:57] brother brandom scriptural or infallible
[11:01] and that's idolatry that's wrong that's
[11:02] what Jeffersonville is doing so this
[11:05] brother who's criticizing is trying to
[11:06] live in the brother bram's infallible
[11:08] camp and then also brother bram's a
[11:10] human and we need to rightly divide what
[11:11] he said by the word of God now the only
[11:13] Camp that's right is this camp where
[11:15] brother randam is a human like he said
[11:17] and we must test him by the word as
[11:19] brother brandom said you can look up
[11:21] that exact quote brother randam says
[11:22] test me by the word test your
[11:24] denomination by the word and see who's
[11:26] right so we know brother Brandon when he
[11:28] points to the word of God will be right
[11:30] but not every single word brother bandam
[11:31] said was from the Lord I have numerous
[11:33] videos on that any honest person would
[11:35] admit that so we can't live in both
[11:37] camps we got to live in the camp of the
[11:39] scripture where the camp is rightly
[11:41] dividing the word of Truth as Paul told
[11:44] Timothy remember brother Ram said and he
[11:46] cares that you care 1963 he said I've
[11:48] always asked you to be careful how
[11:50] you're listening to me if there's
[11:52] anything that comes from the Lord it'll
[11:53] speak it it'll say thus sayith the Lord
[11:56] and remember there's no thus sayith the
[11:57] Lord on a ban against interracial
[12:00] marriage there is no thus sayi the
[12:01] Lord's statement on that so again some
[12:03] people just build complexes against
[12:05] certain subjects they're unwilling to
[12:08] learn they're unwilling to look at other
[12:09] quotes from brother brandham they're
[12:11] unwilling to look at scriptures so all
[12:13] we can do is love them and pray for them
[12:14] by the grace of God the final accusation
[12:17] was that Brothers like me are exalting
[12:20] our own intelligence above the word and
[12:22] again this is nonsense I don't have any
[12:24] intelligence of my own that's worth
[12:25] anything the only intelligence I have
[12:27] that would be worth anything would be
[12:29] what I've learned from the word of God
[12:30] by Revelation remember the word learn is
[12:32] not a bad word Jesus said you must learn
[12:34] of me in Matthew 11 so the word learn is
[12:38] just a synonym for revelation we learn
[12:40] through revelation we learn through
[12:42] unveiling and no I'm not exalting my own
[12:45] intelligence above the word because the
[12:47] word allows interracial marriage at
[12:49] least six times and there's probably
[12:50] more than that by the grace of God what
[12:53] I'm doing is I'm observing other quotes
[12:55] from Brother brandom on the same subject
[12:57] that this precious brother is ignoring
[13:00] for the sake of his complex or the sake
[13:01] of his reputation or the sake of just
[13:04] his dogmatic human nature I don't know
[13:06] brother Ram said God is some kind some
[13:08] nice some dogmatic God has all different
[13:10] kinds of personalities so I hope this
[13:13] video was a blessing by the grace of God
[13:14] again I came across this quote this week
[13:16] from 1957 beautiful quote what God does
[13:19] is perfect and isn't that such a
[13:20] beautiful statement from Brother
[13:21] brandham whatever God does is perfect so
[13:23] we rejoice in that and as always I
[13:25] continue to pray for those who criticize
[13:27] me I can take it just just like I'm sure
[13:29] that brother can take criticism we all
[13:32] have to deal with it we all have to pray
[13:33] through it and express the brotherly
[13:35] kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:38] despite our little disagreements by the
[13:39] grace of God because again this topic
[13:41] does not pertain to Salvation it just
[13:43] pertains to marriage if you have any
[13:45] questions concerns or testimonies about
[13:46] this video please contact
[13:49] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[13:52] the desire of your heart
[13:54] [Music]
