TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so I sometimes look down as every Minister down the pathway that you have walked and wonder about the things that if you have sold the seed many of you well acquainted with Johnny apple seed and of America while there was also a man in Sweden that was considered something like that he sold flowers and they say that's why they have so many pretty flowers in Sweden now and because that they sewed the flow seeds everywhere he could find a piece of ground that seeds are growing he love flowers so he just strolled the seeds around he's gone on but his flowers still live and partings leave behind us footprints on the sands of time amen God footprints that perhaps another while sailing over life solemn man a forong and shipwreck brother in seeing shall take heart again and that's what we all like to see that's something that we have did that will cause others to to benefit by what we have done a few days ago I was sitting talking to my loyal little friend here in the city a medical doctor sadare and he said how you doing bill and I said oh pretty fair I suppose I said yourself and he said oh a lot of patients that have had 15 examinations this afternoon I said well that's good as long as it's this examinations and finding nothing wrong I said you know the we got talked about back when we were boys and I said well doc I don't know just how long I'm going to be around we're both in our 50s and he said that's true bill and I said but all these years about 31 years of ministry now I have kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes so it doesn't matter when he comes amen so he said that is true I said the greatest thrill I have is living for others and he said that's what life is makes life real is when you not what you can do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others see amen that's when you're really living and if there happens to be someone Among Us who has never did that tried to live for somebody else give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life and you'll find that is more blessed than riches or anything of that can be the thought of is what you can do for someone else to make life's burdens which life in itself is a burden and it will make it a little lighter for someone else you just don't know the joy unless youve tried it once to do something for someone else
