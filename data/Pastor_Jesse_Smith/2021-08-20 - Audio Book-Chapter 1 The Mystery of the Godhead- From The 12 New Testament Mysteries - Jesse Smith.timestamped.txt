[0:00] chapter 1 the mystery of the godhead
[0:03] chapter 1 contains footnotes numbers 121
[0:08] to 283
[0:11] that their hearts might be comforted
[0:13] being knit together in love
[0:15] and unto all riches of the full
[0:17] assurance of understanding
[0:18] to the acknowledgement of the mystery of
[0:20] god and of the father
[0:22] and of christ in whom are hid all the
[0:25] treasures of wisdom
[0:26] and knowledge colossians chapter 2
[0:29] verses 2
[0:30] and 3. the most necessary place to begin
[0:33] teaching on god's mysteries
[0:35] is with god himself the author of life
[0:38] creator of the universe giver of every
[0:41] good and perfect gift
[0:42] the only wise god colossians 1 verse 18
[0:46] says christ should have preeminence or
[0:48] first place
[0:49] in all things so he will be the first
[0:51] revealed mystery
[0:52] in this book in the epigraph colossians
[0:56] chapter 2 verses 2 and 3
[0:58] speaks of the mystery of god and of the
[1:00] father and of christ
[1:02] from henceforth i will refer to this
[1:03] mystery as the godhead
[1:05] rather than the lengthier description
[1:08] notice also from the epigraph that paul
[1:10] wants christians to acknowledge
[1:12] the mysterious aspect of the godhead
[1:15] this chapter acknowledges that
[1:16] christians do not know everything about
[1:18] god
[1:19] as it clearly states the one final
[1:21] mystery that remains
[1:23] while god is infinite and we are finite
[1:25] we can know god's nature based upon his
[1:28] own word
[1:28] while rejecting satan's lies about god
[1:31] because we have the discerning power of
[1:33] god's sword his word
[1:35] scripture must unveil who god is and who
[1:38] god is not
[1:39] for god has given us the spirit of
[1:41] wisdom and revelation
[1:42] in the knowledge of him god manifests
[1:46] himself to believers through revelation
[1:48] or the spiritual unveiling of himself
[1:50] jesus told peter that the heavenly
[1:52] father could reveal jesus identity
[1:54] to peter through revelation only saying
[1:58] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[2:00] unto thee but my father which is in
[2:02] heaven
[2:03] notice that jesus's own flesh and blood
[2:05] through his own human ability
[2:07] could not reveal his identity to peter
[2:10] it took a revelation from the heavenly
[2:11] father
[2:12] for peter to know that jesus was the
[2:14] christ the same is true today
[2:16] the heavenly father must reveal jesus
[2:18] christ to a person or else he will not
[2:20] understand the godhead
[2:23] the confusion about the godhead the
[2:26] confusion about the godhead
[2:28] centers on how many persons he is since
[2:31] nearly a third of the world's
[2:32] 7.3 billion people are professed
[2:35] christians
[2:36] it can be estimated that nearly two
[2:37] billion christians are trinitarians
[2:39] believing god is three separate distinct
[2:42] co-equal persons
[2:44] a small minority believe god is two
[2:46] persons and even fewer
[2:48] say he is one person
[2:51] the revelation of the mystery of the
[2:52] godhead is god is one invisible person
[2:56] three persons is essentially tritheism
[2:59] who created the body of his son jesus to
[3:01] be as one eternal image
[3:03] and tabernacle the trinitarian confusion
[3:07] is extremely vast
[3:08] and far-reaching because it started more
[3:10] than one thousand eight hundred years
[3:12] ago
[3:13] and like the hidden leaven in jesus's
[3:14] mystery parable called the leaven hidden
[3:17] three measures of meal
[3:18] see chapter eight has had plenty of time
[3:21] to permeate into churches
[3:23] worldwide around 180 a.d
[3:26] theophilus of antioch first used the
[3:29] greek form of the term
[3:30] trinity triass and shortly afterwards
[3:33] tertullian coined the latin form
[3:35] trinitas the so-called three persons
[3:38] were declared as
[3:39] one god at the council of nicaea in 325
[3:42] a.d
[3:43] and the council of constantinople in 381
[3:46] a.d
[3:48] god's hand-picked authors of the new
[3:49] testament paul
[3:51] peter james and john never use the term
[3:54] trinity
[3:55] nor its definition of god in three
[3:57] persons
[3:58] ultimately the trinity dogma pridefully
[4:00] and erroneously exalts man's false
[4:03] interpretation
[4:04] above god's revelation given to the new
[4:06] testament authors
[4:09] there is absolutely no biblical proof
[4:11] for a trinity of three persons so god
[4:14] should not be called such
[4:16] prayerfully consider that no doctor of
[4:18] divinity
[4:19] or seminary student can produce one
[4:21] scripture in the bible
[4:23] that literally says god is three persons
[4:28] biblical proof for the revelation about
[4:30] the godhead
[4:32] the bible defines god as one invisible
[4:35] spirit
[4:36] who eternally exists as one person three
[4:39] verses say god is one
[4:41] while seven scriptures say god is one
[4:43] god
[4:44] god alone is savior and there is no
[4:46] other god
[4:47] or person beside him for he says
[4:50] i even i am the lord and beside me there
[4:54] is no savior this one god manifests
[4:57] himself in three ways to redeem mankind
[5:00] father son and holy ghost three persons
[5:03] automatically equates to tritheism
[5:06] or else language has lost its meaning
[5:08] completely
[5:09] trinitarianism then is a false doctrine
[5:13] the early church and bible authors have
[5:14] the revelation that god is one person
[5:17] with three manifestations or offices
[5:20] the apostles collective revelation was
[5:23] one god with
[5:24] three titles father son and holy ghost
[5:27] god chose his only begotten son to be
[5:29] his one human image
[5:31] the image of the invisible god placing
[5:34] the fullness of the godhead
[5:36] in the body of jesus christ all of god
[5:39] was in christ
[5:40] paul writes to wit that god was in
[5:43] christ
[5:44] reconciling the world unto himself
[5:47] thus jesus christ is supreme deity jesus
[5:50] is god just listen to deity speaking in
[5:53] jesus christ
[5:55] in john 8 verse 58 jesus says verily
[5:58] verily i say unto you
[6:00] before abraham was i am john 10 verse 30
[6:04] says i
[6:04] and my father are one not two persons
[6:08] when philip asked to see the father in
[6:10] john 14 verses 8 through 10
[6:13] jesus said have i been so long time with
[6:16] you
[6:16] and yet hast thou not known me philip he
[6:19] that hath seen me
[6:20] hath seen the father and how saith thou
[6:23] then show us the father
[6:25] believeth thou not that i am in the
[6:26] father and the father and me
[6:28] the words that i speak unto you i speak
[6:30] it out of myself
[6:32] but the father that dwelt in me he doeth
[6:34] the works
[6:36] the late reverend william branham
[6:38] references revelation 1
[6:40] verses 4 through 8 saying just listen to
[6:43] these words again
[6:44] i am the alpha and omega the beginning
[6:47] and the ending saith the lord
[6:49] which is and which was and which is to
[6:51] come the almighty
[6:53] this is deity this is not simply a
[6:55] prophet a man
[6:57] this is god and it is not a revelation
[7:00] of three gods but of one god
[7:02] the almighty additionally branham says
[7:06] but the revelation through john by the
[7:08] spirit to the churches was
[7:10] i am the lord jesus christ and i am all
[7:12] of it
[7:13] there isn't any other god. jesus was
[7:16] also fully human
[7:18] christ was a one of a kind person unlike
[7:20] any man before or after
[7:23] fully human and fully divine because
[7:26] jesus's flesh was not divine some
[7:28] interpret him as being a separate person
[7:30] from god
[7:32] but first timothy 3 verse 16 settles the
[7:35] question by saying
[7:36] god was manifest in the flesh a second
[7:39] person did not come
[7:41] but god came in another form or
[7:43] manifestation
[7:45] hebrews 10 verse 20 calls jesus's body
[7:47] god's
[7:48] veil jesus is the human form of god
[7:51] he is god's human temple christ is the
[7:55] father's image
[7:56] jesus is god's form temple image
[7:59] and veil
[8:03] eight problems with the trinity dogma
[8:05] there are eight glaring problems with
[8:07] the trinity doctrine
[8:09] first and most decimating to its
[8:11] validity
[8:12] the trinity dogma adds to the bible the
[8:15] term trinity and its definition
[8:17] god in three persons are nowhere found
[8:19] in scripture
[8:20] god's word unleashes great curses and
[8:22] consequences upon anyone
[8:24] who adds to the bible proverbs 30 verses
[8:27] 5 and 6
[8:28] commands us to not add to god's pure
[8:31] words for those who do will be found as
[8:33] liars
[8:34] paul says those who pervert the gospel
[8:37] and change it
[8:38] are cursed the new testament closes by
[8:41] warning those who add or take away
[8:43] from god's book will have plagues added
[8:45] to their punishment
[8:47] or their name taken off the book of life
[8:50] the term trinity and its definition are
[8:52] blatantly absent from scripture
[8:54] the trinity dogma is a house built upon
[8:57] sand
[8:57] and great will be its fall on judgment
[9:00] day
[9:02] the trinity is not detailed in scripture
[9:05] the catholic encyclopedia states
[9:07] in scripture there is as yet no single
[9:10] term
[9:10] by which the three divine persons are
[9:12] denoted together
[9:14] the encyclopedia of religion says
[9:16] theologians agree that both
[9:18] the hebrew bible and the new testament
[9:20] do not contain an explicit doctrine of
[9:22] the trinity
[9:23] and it is incontestable that the
[9:26] doctrine cannot be established on
[9:27] scriptural evidence
[9:28] alone millard erickson declares the
[9:31] trinity
[9:32] is not overtly or explicitly stated in
[9:35] scripture
[9:36] and must be understood by inferences
[9:38] while exercising
[9:40] systematic theology contrary wise
[9:43] jesus says he is known by revelation not
[9:46] theology
[9:47] just as the masters in israel could not
[9:49] grasp the spiritual principles of
[9:51] jesus's doctrine in his day
[9:53] trinitarian theologians miss the
[9:55] spiritual revelation
[9:56] of the godhead today
[10:00] the specific words triune and trinity
[10:02] are not
[10:03] evil words of themselves if used with
[10:06] correct biblical understanding
[10:08] these words can be used to describe
[10:09] god's three manifestations
[10:12] for example god is triune or three in
[10:15] one
[10:15] three manifestations in one god
[10:19] but god is not three persons in one or
[10:21] else language has completely lost all
[10:23] meaning
[10:24] god is also a trinity of manifestations
[10:26] if trinity is defined as
[10:29] threefold or the state of being three
[10:32] the impure words three persons cannot be
[10:35] used to understand god
[10:37] because they change god's testimony of
[10:39] himself
[10:40] my friend holden summarized it well
[10:43] saying
[10:43] god in three persons is simply
[10:45] polytheism rebranded
[10:47] as the holy trinity
[10:50] a brief study into ancient pagan
[10:52] religions shows numerous polytheistic
[10:55] religions
[10:56] worship a trinity-like group of deities
[10:59] or gods
[11:00] nearly 5 000 years ago sumerians
[11:02] worshipped a triad of deities
[11:05] anu enlil and ia
[11:08] in the new kingdom egyptian age from
[11:11] 1539 to 1075 bc
[11:15] worship was given to a triad of gods
[11:17] osiris
[11:18] isis and horus clearly god in three
[11:22] persons
[11:23] was polytheism rebranded
[11:26] especially considering the word trinity
[11:28] and its definition were not coined until
[11:30] nearly
[11:31] 150 years after christ although
[11:34] islam is a false religion i agree with
[11:37] muslims on the trinity
[11:38] for they teach the christian dogma of a
[11:41] trinitarian
[11:42] god is a form of tritheism or a
[11:44] three-god belief
[11:47] second jesus and his apostles taught and
[11:49] affirmed pure
[11:50] hebrew monotheism rather than
[11:53] trinitarianism
[11:54] two texts show jesus's affirmation of
[11:57] the hebrew understanding of the godhead
[11:59] john 4 verses 19 through 26 and mark 12
[12:03] verses 28 through 34.
[12:05] in john 4 verse 22 jesus spoke with the
[12:08] samaritan woman and told
[12:10] her we know what we worship for
[12:12] salvation
[12:13] is of the jews according to christ the
[12:16] jews worship god in truth
[12:18] and judaism has always been the purest
[12:20] monotheism
[12:21] even from ancient times mark 12 records
[12:24] jesus's conversation with the scribe
[12:27] about the greatest commandment and
[12:29] christ confirms
[12:30] that god is one not three jesus quoted
[12:33] deuteronomy 6 verse 4
[12:35] the ancient hebrew prayer known as the
[12:37] shema hear o israel
[12:39] the lord our god is one lord note that
[12:42] jesus did not add to the shema
[12:44] and say that god is three persons our
[12:47] lord always pointed people back to the
[12:49] jewish faith
[12:50] of pure monotheism
[12:53] jesus apostles and early church leaders
[12:55] had no controversy about the subject of
[12:58] the godhead
[12:58] in the first century the new testament
[13:01] especially the book of acts
[13:03] gives us a record of the councils and
[13:05] problems the apostles had
[13:07] such as their command to gentile
[13:09] christians to abstain from eating blood
[13:11] and fornication
[13:12] in acts chapter 15. but there's no
[13:15] record of the apostles having a
[13:16] disagreement about the godhead
[13:18] because they all held the hebrew
[13:20] monotheistic understanding of god
[13:23] like jesus himself the early apostles
[13:26] had the true baptism of the holy ghost
[13:28] and all agreed on the godhead and today
[13:31] all those who have the same baptism of
[13:33] the holy ghost will agree with and teach
[13:36] the godhead the same way
[13:37] as christ and his apostles
[13:41] third the athanasian creed or sixth
[13:44] century trinitarian confessional
[13:46] contains multiple contradictions to
[13:49] biblical teaching
[13:50] on the godhead creeds always cause
[13:53] confusion
[13:54] because they are written by uninspired
[13:55] men who either
[13:57] add or take away from scripture
[13:59] immediately limiting the holy one of
[14:01] israel
[14:02] psalm 78 verse 41 reads yea they turned
[14:06] back
[14:06] and tempted god and limited the holy one
[14:09] of israel
[14:11] notice the athenation creeds six
[14:13] contradictions
[14:15] the creed says we worship one god in
[14:17] trinity but jesus says we worship him
[14:20] god the one person not three persons
[14:24] in spirit and in truth worship in the
[14:27] spirit is walking in the spirit
[14:30] by denying the sinful works of the flesh
[14:33] worshiping in truth is believing
[14:35] only the bible testimony of the godhead
[14:37] which does not mention
[14:38] a three-person god jesus said thy word
[14:41] is truth in john 17
[14:43] verse 17 proving the trinity cannot be
[14:46] truth
[14:47] since it is absent from the word the
[14:50] creed says the son
[14:51] uncreated but the bible says the flesh
[14:54] of jesus was created
[14:55] or made of a woman in the womb of mary
[14:58] by the holy ghost
[15:00] also jesus calls himself the beginning
[15:02] of the creation of god
[15:04] so how can the creed call him uncreated
[15:06] undoubtedly though
[15:08] the father that dwell in christ and
[15:09] spake through christ was
[15:11] uncreated which is why jesus said in
[15:13] john 8
[15:14] 58 before abraham was i am
[15:18] the great uncreated i am dwelt in the
[15:21] body
[15:21] of jesus of nazareth the creed says
[15:25] the sun unlimited but the bible says
[15:28] jesus human knowledge was limited
[15:30] for he did not know the identity of the
[15:32] woman with the blood issue
[15:33] who touched him nor did he know the day
[15:36] and hour of his second coming to earth
[15:39] the creed says the son is of the father
[15:42] alone
[15:42] but the bible says jesus body was
[15:45] conceived of the holy ghost
[15:47] not specifically naming the father in
[15:50] the womb of mary
[15:51] the creed denies the holy ghost as the
[15:53] father of jesus
[15:55] annulling matthew 1 verse 20
[15:58] if the creed is true then jesus seems to
[16:00] have two fathers
[16:01] since the one who conceives a child is
[16:03] the father
[16:04] the truth is that the bible reveals the
[16:06] father and holy ghost
[16:08] as the selfsame person not two separate
[16:11] persons
[16:13] the crete says none is greater or less
[16:15] than another
[16:16] but the bible says jesus declared in
[16:18] john 14 verse 28
[16:20] the father is greater than i the truth
[16:24] is that the flesh of jesus was mortal
[16:26] during his earthly ministry but god the
[16:29] father is a spirit
[16:30] and has always been and always will be
[16:33] immortal
[16:35] the creed says god is three persons but
[16:38] the bible never uses that language to
[16:40] describe god
[16:41] because he is one person the word
[16:44] teaches that the father
[16:45] is the holy spirit which decreases the
[16:47] trinity's total down to only two persons
[16:50] father and son then the two will be
[16:54] decreased down to one because hebrews 1
[16:57] verse 3
[16:57] says the son is the express image of the
[17:00] one
[17:01] person of god as colossians 1 verse 15
[17:04] says christ is the image of the
[17:07] invisible god
[17:08] christ is not a second person but the
[17:10] visible image
[17:12] of the person of god
[17:15] few trinitarians are aware that the
[17:17] first part of the athanasian creed
[17:19] was visually summarized as the shield of
[17:22] the trinity
[17:23] sea figure one this image creates
[17:26] unsound doctrine
[17:27] contradicting itself a contradiction is
[17:31] defined as a
[17:32] statement of a position opposite to one
[17:35] already made claiming the holy spirit is
[17:38] god
[17:39] while also saying the holy spirit is not
[17:41] the father is a contradiction of
[17:43] opposite statements ephesians 4 verse 30
[17:46] plainly states
[17:48] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[17:50] jesus prayed holy father
[17:52] in john 17 verse 11 the father is the
[17:55] holy spirit
[17:56] for there is only one spirit the
[17:59] implications of three persons in the
[18:01] godhead
[18:02] are doctrinally dangerous proven by two
[18:04] examples
[18:05] first if the holy ghost is not the
[18:07] father then jesus had two fathers
[18:10] jesus prayed to the heavenly father but
[18:12] his physical body must
[18:14] have been conceived by another father
[18:16] the holy ghost because matthew 1 verse
[18:18] 20 says
[18:19] that which is conceived in her is of the
[18:21] holy ghost
[18:23] two fathers equals two persons which
[18:25] equals two gods
[18:27] second if the holy ghost and father are
[18:29] separate persons
[18:31] then jesus had two persons living inside
[18:34] himself
[18:34] the third person jesus said the father
[18:37] dwelt in him
[18:38] in john 14 verse 10. then john
[18:41] 1 verse 32 says the holy spirit abode
[18:44] or dwelt in christ nowhere does the
[18:48] bible tell us to believe that
[18:49] two eternal persons dwell in a third
[18:52] eternal person
[18:53] that would make three eternals or three
[18:56] gods
[18:57] the truth is that the father and holy
[18:59] ghost are the self-same person
[19:01] the father came and lived in the temple
[19:03] or body of his son
[19:05] jesus the father came and hid behind the
[19:07] veil of jesus flesh jesus was not a
[19:10] second person
[19:11] but the image of god's one person the
[19:14] word made flesh
[19:16] thus three personalities equal three
[19:18] separate person gods
[19:20] or else the english language has lost
[19:22] its meaning entirely
[19:24] three persons in the godhead equals
[19:26] three gods or tritheism
[19:28] it's simply polytheism this means
[19:31] trinitarianism
[19:32] is idolatry which breaks the first
[19:34] commandment
[19:37] fourth major bible contradictions and
[19:40] inconsistencies
[19:41] exist among trinitarians
[19:44] most dangerous are those who lean more
[19:46] towards tritheism
[19:48] the belief in three separate gods for
[19:51] example in his seminary thesis
[19:53] one pastor wrote that god exists in
[19:55] three equal beings
[19:57] and is three distinct beings these
[20:00] phrases match the very definition of
[20:02] tritheism
[20:03] even though pastors who believe this
[20:05] often try to protect themselves by
[20:07] saying
[20:08] yet god is one they are nevertheless
[20:10] contradicting scripture
[20:12] and propagating polytheism
[20:15] a great inconsistency among trinitarians
[20:19] is those who claim to worship sola
[20:21] scriptura
[20:22] latin for by scripture alone but then
[20:25] admit to understanding the godhead
[20:27] using pagan ideology for example a
[20:30] prominent evangelical trinitarian
[20:32] scholar
[20:33] wrote that trinitarians tend to
[20:35] alternate between
[20:36] tritheism a belief in three equal
[20:39] closely related gods
[20:41] and modalism a belief in one god who
[20:43] plays
[20:44] three different roles or reveals himself
[20:46] in three different fashions
[20:48] how incredibly deceptive and sad when
[20:51] bible teachers admit to accepting
[20:53] pagan ideas into christianity christians
[20:57] who claim to worship by scripture alone
[20:59] should only worship by scripture never
[21:02] rotating between
[21:03] an heir and scripture can you imagine
[21:05] the evil of rotating between
[21:07] the sanctity of life pro-life and
[21:10] abortion
[21:11] thinking that sometimes it is acceptable
[21:13] to kill a baby in the womb
[21:15] it is foolish to rotate between good and
[21:17] evil these trinitarians
[21:19] who rotate between tritheism and
[21:21] modalism
[21:22] are at best spiritual children in
[21:25] understanding
[21:26] being tossed to and fro and carried
[21:28] about with every wind
[21:30] of doctrine by the slight of men
[21:34] fifth the early trinitarians did not
[21:36] affirm that the holy spirit was divine
[21:39] until the council of constantinople in
[21:42] 381
[21:43] a.d this further proves that the bible
[21:46] writers only
[21:48] not the originators of the trinity had
[21:50] revelation on the godhead
[21:52] because luke the author of acts chapter
[21:54] 5 verses 3 and 4
[21:56] used the words holy spirit and god
[21:59] interchangeably
[22:01] peter states that ananias lied to the
[22:03] holy ghost in verse 3
[22:04] and then in the next verse luke said
[22:07] ananias lied to god
[22:09] the early epistles and bible authors
[22:11] instantly knew the holy spirit was god
[22:13] in 30 a.d whereas the misguided
[22:16] trinitarians
[22:17] did not agree to this until about 350
[22:20] years
[22:20] later sixth trinitarian images and
[22:24] artwork are often
[22:26] deceptive creating false representations
[22:28] of the godhead
[22:30] some images portray a heavenly scene
[22:32] containing
[22:33] two men sitting on two thrones an old
[22:36] man representing the father
[22:37] and a young man as christ in the air
[22:40] between them
[22:40] is a white dove symbolizing the holy
[22:42] spirit these images
[22:44] are not scriptural for no bible text
[22:47] ever describes two thrones for two
[22:49] people in heaven
[22:50] and there are no references to a dove
[22:52] flying around two men
[22:54] in heaven these untrue images create a
[22:57] false security
[22:58] in trinitarians minds as some sort of
[23:01] visual evidence for their
[23:02] extra biblical beliefs as christians we
[23:05] must use discernment in the art we
[23:06] accept
[23:07] for paul says we ought not to think that
[23:09] the godhead is like unto gold or silver
[23:12] or stone
[23:13] graven by art and man's device
[23:17] when you get to heaven and later when
[23:19] heaven comes down to earth
[23:20] you will not see two persons and a dove
[23:23] but you'll see one person
[23:25] jesus christ ruling from only one throne
[23:28] this is because no one has seen can see
[23:31] nor ever will see the father for he is
[23:34] invisible
[23:35] the book of revelation says you will see
[23:36] jesus body only
[23:38] for he is the image of the invisible god
[23:41] who suddenly appears among the eternal
[23:42] colors around
[23:44] the one throne christ's human body with
[23:46] a countenance shining as the sun
[23:49] is god's only image we will see not a
[23:51] dove
[23:52] nor a wrinkly old man
[23:56] seventh some trinitarians use two fear
[23:59] tactics
[24:00] to persuade others to believe in the
[24:01] trinity heresy
[24:03] and hell first labeling non-trinitarians
[24:07] as heretics is a serious accusation
[24:10] as the greek meaning is a body of men
[24:12] following their own tenets
[24:15] heretics ultimately filled with the
[24:16] pride of life
[24:18] will not inherit the kingdom of god
[24:20] additionally
[24:21] heresies show who god has rejected and
[24:23] christians are commanded to avoid
[24:25] heretics
[24:27] a second fear tactic is repeating an
[24:29] anonymous saying
[24:30] try to explain it trinity and you'll
[24:33] lose your mind
[24:34] but try to deny it and you'll lose your
[24:36] soul in other words if you do not
[24:38] believe in the trinity
[24:39] you will go to hell nothing could be
[24:42] further from the truth
[24:43] your eternal destiny is not based upon
[24:45] your acceptance or rejection
[24:47] of the man-made trinity dogma fear
[24:50] should never motivate blind faith in any
[24:52] doctrine
[24:53] instead christ's perfect love casts out
[24:56] all fear
[24:57] as you faithfully love god who is the
[24:59] word
[25:00] over time all your fears about your
[25:02] salvation will leave your mind
[25:04] because god promises to develop a divine
[25:07] lively hope in your heart furthermore
[25:10] bible believing christians do not deny
[25:12] anything the bible teaches
[25:14] about the father the son or the holy
[25:16] ghost
[25:17] rather believers rejoice in the
[25:19] revelation of the godhead
[25:21] and simply deny the false teaching the
[25:23] false statements surrounding the trinity
[25:25] doctrine
[25:26] essentially allow polytheism in the
[25:28] church or the worship of more than one
[25:30] god
[25:31] although is not officially stated in
[25:33] that manner
[25:34] god will not send anyone to hell because
[25:36] they rejected the trinity doctrine
[25:38] and its additions to holy writ surely
[25:41] god will do the opposite
[25:43] he'll save those who believe only the
[25:45] bible's revelation
[25:46] and eternal truths of the godhead
[25:50] eighth god sent a prophet named william
[25:52] branham see chapters
[25:53] 7 and 13 to warn christians about the
[25:56] false trinity doctrine
[25:58] in 1961 branham declared trinitarianism
[26:02] is of the devil
[26:03] i say that thus saith the lord while
[26:06] branham believed trinitarians could
[26:08] still be genuine christians he said they
[26:10] were sincerely wrong
[26:11] about the trinity recall some prophets
[26:14] god sent to warn his people
[26:16] noah to his generation jonah to nineveh
[26:19] and john the baptist to the pharisees
[26:21] likewise god's faithful heart has sent
[26:24] his prophet william branham
[26:25] to this time period to warn his people
[26:28] of the trinitarian deception
[26:30] in the name of the lord and its sinful
[26:32] addition to the faith
[26:34] this prophet taught christians to
[26:35] understand god using bible terminology
[26:38] only god manifests himself
[26:42] in three ways in his redemption of man
[26:46] the one god manifests himself in three
[26:48] ways
[26:49] father son and holy ghost manifest
[26:53] meaning show or appear in the greek is
[26:56] the key word to understanding the
[26:58] godhead
[26:58] the word manifest is specific bible
[27:01] terminology
[27:02] used 11 times in connection to jesus
[27:06] a synonym for manifest is form in the
[27:08] king james bible
[27:10] paul uses form to describe god's
[27:12] manifestation
[27:13] in christ in philippians 2 verse 6
[27:16] saying
[27:17] who being in the form of god thought it
[27:19] not robbery to be equal with god
[27:22] the greek lexicon states form means the
[27:24] form by which a person or thing strikes
[27:27] the vision
[27:28] external appearance as god the father he
[27:31] appeared in many forms to israel
[27:33] to redeem man by the cross god took only
[27:36] one form
[27:37] the man jesus christ to fill believer's
[27:40] souls on the day of pentecost
[27:42] he took the form of the holy spirit one
[27:45] god changing his form
[27:46] not three persons
[27:49] god's one person his person is made up
[27:53] of three manifestations
[27:55] father son and holy ghost man is the
[27:58] same
[27:58] he is one person made up of three
[28:00] aspects body
[28:02] spirit and soul paul says i pray god
[28:06] your whole spirit and soul and body
[28:08] be preserved blameless unto the coming
[28:10] of our lord jesus christ
[28:12] since man is created in the image of god
[28:15] after god's own image
[28:17] god cannot be three persons in one
[28:19] person because man
[28:20] is not three persons in one person to
[28:23] make god into three persons is to break
[28:25] god's image he described in genesis
[28:30] three manifestations or forms do not
[28:33] equal three persons
[28:34] especially when you consider god the
[28:36] father's many manifestations
[28:38] which include the human priest
[28:40] melchizedek a pillar of fire
[28:42] a burning bush a rock in the wilderness
[28:45] and a voice in the whirlwind
[28:47] to understand god you must use god's
[28:49] vocabulary words
[28:50] manifest or form rather than adding
[28:53] man-made words like
[28:55] three persons the three manifestations
[28:58] or appearances of god
[28:59] father son holy ghost are the same
[29:02] person
[29:02] in a different form god above us god
[29:06] with us
[29:07] god in us first god manifested himself
[29:11] as a father when he created male
[29:14] and female in genesis chapter 1 malachi
[29:17] 2 verse 10
[29:18] says have we not all one father hath not
[29:22] one god created us the father is above
[29:25] us in heaven god so powerfully
[29:28] magnificently and obviously manifests
[29:31] his creative work
[29:33] inside each and every human body that
[29:36] all men will be without excuse on the
[29:38] day of judgment
[29:39] for they witness and experience god's
[29:41] power in their own bodies
[29:43] in other words no man will be able to
[29:45] deny god's fatherhood
[29:47] on the day of judgment
[29:50] second god was manifest in flesh in the
[29:52] human body of christ
[29:54] in order to redeem and reconcile his
[29:56] people back to himself
[29:57] through the blood of jesus's cross in
[30:00] his invisible spirit form
[30:02] god could not redeem his sinful people
[30:04] because remission of sins
[30:06] came only by shed blood according to his
[30:09] own law
[30:10] invisible spirit god had to condescend
[30:12] into a flesh body
[30:14] that he himself prepared for a once for
[30:17] all
[30:17] sin sacrifice god named that body
[30:20] emmanuel
[30:21] or god with us and then came and dwelt
[30:24] in jesus body
[30:25] for jesus said the father dwelt in him
[30:28] jesus was not a second person of god but
[30:31] was
[30:32] and is the visible image of the
[30:34] invisible god
[30:36] third the holy ghost is the father
[30:38] spirit manifest in the lives of humans
[30:40] on earth chapter 6 labors on this
[30:43] subject
[30:44] in the old testament the holy ghost was
[30:46] a strong but temporary anointing on the
[30:48] believer's flesh
[30:50] and mind a soul like abraham's could
[30:52] have a small anointing on his soul
[30:54] but the soul wasn't filled with god's
[30:56] spirit
[30:58] for christians the holy ghost is god in
[31:00] us
[31:01] abiding fully in our souls as a seal
[31:04] described by jesus
[31:05] as the baptism of the holy ghost this
[31:08] baptism came after jesus
[31:10] ascended to heaven when the eternal
[31:12] spirit that was in him
[31:13] divided itself and came to live in the
[31:16] christians
[31:17] on the day of pentecost this same holy
[31:20] spirit has been dwelling in the souls of
[31:21] true christians
[31:23] ever since the holy ghost is god
[31:25] manifest in believers
[31:27] first corinthians 12 7 declares but the
[31:30] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[31:32] every man
[31:33] to profit with all
[31:37] it's essential to recognize that the
[31:38] holy ghost is the father
[31:40] because god is holy and god is a spirit
[31:44] the holy ghost is literally god the
[31:46] father
[31:48] not a third person in a trinity the
[31:50] bible never says that there are two
[31:52] different holy spirits
[31:54] so the holy spirit is god the father
[31:56] himself
[31:58] consider the multiple scriptures that
[32:00] prove the holy ghost and father
[32:02] are the same person first the body of
[32:04] jesus was conceived of the holy ghost
[32:07] proving the holy ghost is the father of
[32:09] jesus since jesus cannot have two
[32:11] fathers
[32:12] the bible-based conclusion is that the
[32:14] father and holy ghost
[32:15] are the self-same person second jesus
[32:18] said the father dwell in him
[32:20] but the bible also records that the holy
[32:23] ghost abode upon him
[32:24] and anointed him jesus did not have two
[32:27] separate persons anointing him
[32:29] but god's one spirit third god the
[32:32] father promised to pour out his own
[32:34] spirit
[32:34] not a third-person spirit on the day of
[32:37] pentecost according to joel
[32:39] 2 verses 27-29 saying
[32:42] i am the lord your god i will pour out
[32:45] my spirit upon all flesh
[32:47] god's own spirit is not a separate
[32:49] person outside himself
[32:51] the sending of the holy ghost in acts
[32:53] chapter 2 was simply god the father
[32:55] pouring out his spirit
[32:57] into the souls of believers not a third
[33:00] person coming
[33:01] but the spirit of the one and only
[33:03] living god
[33:04] being shared with humanity jesus named
[33:07] the spirits coming at pentecost as
[33:09] the promise of my father paul proved the
[33:12] holy ghost was the father when he wrote
[33:14] god hath said i will dwell in them and
[33:16] walk in them
[33:17] and i will receive you and will be a
[33:20] father unto you
[33:23] modalism and the oneness movement
[33:26] bible scholars label the true godhead
[33:28] teaching god in three manifestations
[33:31] as modalism although modalism is closer
[33:34] to the truth than trinitarianism
[33:36] christians should not accept the
[33:38] modalist label because it contradicts
[33:40] scripture
[33:41] at times modalistic monarchianism
[33:44] which emerged during the second century
[33:46] and eventually became labeled as heresy
[33:49] in the fourth century is defined as the
[33:52] doctrine that the persons of the trinity
[33:54] represent only
[33:55] three modes or aspects of the divine
[33:57] revelation
[33:58] not distinct and co-equal persons in the
[34:01] divine nature
[34:02] this definition fully agrees with
[34:04] scripture digging deeper though
[34:07] erickson says modalism teaches the
[34:09] father son and holy spirit are identical
[34:12] they are successive revelations of the
[34:14] same person
[34:15] who has three different names roles or
[34:17] activities
[34:19] this is where modalism breaks down in
[34:20] two ways
[34:22] first while the father and holy spirit
[34:24] are identical
[34:25] the father and son are not fully
[34:27] identical
[34:29] the father and son share the identical
[34:31] nature as god is his word
[34:33] and his word became flesh in christ but
[34:36] their substance is different
[34:38] father substance is an invisible eternal
[34:40] spirit
[34:41] but the son had a human substance second
[34:44] the father son and holy ghost have one
[34:47] name
[34:48] not three matthew 28 verse 19
[34:51] says there is one name not names
[34:54] for the father son and holy ghost
[34:57] scripture verifies this
[34:58] as jesus declared he came in his
[35:00] father's name in john 5
[35:02] 43 so the name of the father is jesus
[35:06] since its greek meaning is jehovah is
[35:08] salvation
[35:09] the name of the son is jesus for the
[35:11] angel of the lord told joseph to name
[35:13] the son
[35:14] jesus for he shall save his people from
[35:16] their sins
[35:18] finally jesus said the holy ghost would
[35:20] come in his name saying
[35:22] but the comforter which is the holy
[35:23] ghost whom the father will send in my
[35:26] name
[35:26] he shall teach you all things acts 4
[35:29] verse 12
[35:30] says there is salvation in no other name
[35:33] just as zechariah 14 verse 9 says there
[35:36] is
[35:36] one lord and his name one god has one
[35:40] name
[35:40] the lord jesus christ
[35:44] a third way modalism fails is its claim
[35:46] that the father suffered along with
[35:48] christ
[35:49] since he was actually present in and
[35:51] personally identical
[35:53] with the son first the father cannot
[35:55] suffer physically since spirits do not
[35:57] have
[35:58] flesh and bones second the father
[36:00] forsook jesus as christ died on calvary
[36:03] jesus cried my god my god why is thou
[36:06] forsaken me
[36:07] the holy spirit anointing inside of him
[36:10] or the father spirit
[36:12] left jesus somewhere between the garden
[36:14] of gethsemane and the cross
[36:16] the father had to leave jesus body
[36:18] because christ was
[36:19] made a curse for us and god hath made
[36:22] him to be a sin for us
[36:24] the father could not curse himself to
[36:26] redeem mankind
[36:27] so he created a human form of himself in
[36:30] order to pay
[36:31] sins ransom born again christians do not
[36:35] need
[36:35] labels for their beliefs especially
[36:37] regarding the godhead
[36:39] the book of acts is absent of believers
[36:41] debating about the number of persons god
[36:43] is
[36:44] early apostles were men full of faith
[36:47] and never called themselves
[36:49] trinitarians or modalists peter james
[36:52] john and paul didn't need creeds or
[36:54] fancy labels
[36:56] their only need was to know christ for
[36:58] once they knew christ
[36:59] who is the word he would lead and guide
[37:01] them into
[37:02] all truth there is an increasingly
[37:06] popular religious label called oneness
[37:09] which correctly rejects the trinity and
[37:11] believes god is one person
[37:13] but one does not need to attach labels
[37:15] to god's revelation
[37:17] additionally some oneness
[37:18] interpretations are false
[37:20] the largest organization in the oneness
[37:22] movement is the united pentecostal
[37:24] church
[37:25] international which represents nearly
[37:27] five million believers
[37:29] worldwide while i rejoice that oneness
[37:31] pentecostals have received much
[37:33] truth their major error is emphasizing
[37:36] speaking in tongues
[37:37] as the evidence for the baptism of the
[37:39] holy ghost
[37:40] the erroneous and unbalanced evidence
[37:43] places
[37:44] excessive emphasis on a gift of the holy
[37:46] ghost
[37:47] rather than the holy ghost himself jesus
[37:50] reveals the true evidence of the holy
[37:51] ghost in john
[37:52] 16 13 being guided into all truth
[37:57] the evidence of the holy ghost is taught
[37:59] in chapter six
[38:02] reducing persons leaves the mystery of
[38:05] plural nouns
[38:07] based upon this overwhelming biblical
[38:09] evidence it is easiest to reduce the
[38:11] trinitarian false doctrine of three
[38:13] persons
[38:14] down to two persons by starting with god
[38:16] the father and the holy ghost
[38:18] if you can see that god the father is
[38:20] the selfsame person as the holy ghost
[38:22] since jesus did not have two fathers the
[38:25] three persons
[38:26] instantly reduces down to two while two
[38:29] persons are closer to the truth than
[38:30] three
[38:31] believers are faced with the fact that
[38:33] god never said i
[38:34] am two persons so the only solution must
[38:36] be that god is one person
[38:38] this brings us to the one and only
[38:40] mystery remaining about the godhead
[38:43] jesus's usage of first first-person
[38:45] plural pronouns like we
[38:47] and us when referring to the father is
[38:50] the only remaining godhead mystery
[38:52] in john 14 verse 23 jesus says if a man
[38:55] loves me
[38:56] he will keep my words and my father will
[38:58] love him
[38:59] and we will come unto him and make our
[39:01] abode with him
[39:03] jesus uses we a plural pronoun and our
[39:07] a possessive determiner to speak of his
[39:09] and the father's coming to dwell
[39:11] in the man who keeps his words
[39:14] then in john 17 verse 21 jesus uses
[39:17] us to refer to himself and the father
[39:20] saying
[39:21] that they all may be one as thou father
[39:24] art in me
[39:25] and i in thee that they also may be one
[39:28] in us if god is not two or three persons
[39:31] why does jesus use plural pronouns
[39:34] and possessive determiners the best
[39:37] biblical answer is that jesus was both
[39:39] fully human and fully divine
[39:41] yet his human side was not divine
[39:43] therefore jesus had to use a separate
[39:45] pronoun for himself
[39:47] since he was mortal unlike the immortal
[39:50] father
[39:50] jesus experienced temptation in his
[39:52] human will but the father cannot be
[39:55] tempted
[39:56] jesus died but the father can never die
[39:59] jesus is a human but the father is an
[40:01] eternal spirit
[40:03] consequently a separate pronoun was
[40:05] needed for jesus
[40:06] yet he was not a co-equal distinct
[40:08] person from the father
[40:10] he was the express image of the father
[40:14] consider that jesus is a unique one of a
[40:17] kind
[40:17] human manifestation completely unlike
[40:20] god's previous manifestations
[40:22] melchizedek a pillar of fire a burning
[40:25] bush
[40:26] a rock in the wilderness and a voice in
[40:28] the whirlwind
[40:29] jesus was born of a woman mary unlike
[40:32] melchizedek
[40:33] who had no father or mother the truth
[40:36] about god's need to use plural
[40:38] nouns lies somewhere between the two
[40:40] extremes of
[40:41] father and son beliefs two co-equal
[40:44] persons
[40:45] and total oneness the truth is always in
[40:48] the middle of the road
[40:49] two co-equal eternal separate distinct
[40:51] persons
[40:52] is essentially polytheism and jesus's
[40:55] own words reveal his father
[40:57] is greater than he for my father is
[41:00] greater than i
[41:02] on the other end of the spectrum total
[41:04] oneness isn't biblical
[41:06] because jesus was not his own father in
[41:08] other words the body of jesus did not
[41:10] create itself
[41:11] the holy ghost who is the eternal spirit
[41:14] father
[41:15] created jesus body in mary's womb
[41:18] i've often heard the true statement god
[41:20] is not one
[41:21] like your finger god in christ are one
[41:24] but only in a scriptural way
[41:26] the father and son are one by their
[41:28] sinless nature
[41:29] the father is an invisible spirit and
[41:31] the son is the human temple
[41:33] of the father using plural nouns shows
[41:37] the difference between jesus's flesh
[41:39] body
[41:40] and his immortal invisible spirit god
[41:43] could not die as an eternal
[41:45] immortal invisible omnipotent being
[41:48] so he created a son that could die
[41:50] jesus's flesh was made to be sin
[41:53] for us or was made a curse for us
[41:56] as a substitutionary sacrifice for
[41:58] mankind
[41:59] but god's eternal spirit could not curse
[42:01] itself
[42:02] jesus was completely human and his flesh
[42:05] had its own will it had to wrestle with
[42:07] in prayer
[42:08] against every temptation but god's will
[42:11] can never be tempted by
[42:12] evil while there were great differences
[42:16] between
[42:16] jesus's flesh body and god's spirit
[42:19] there was one major similarity between
[42:20] the two
[42:22] jesus's nature or character was exactly
[42:25] the same as the father's
[42:26] hebrews 1 verse 3 says christ is the
[42:29] express
[42:30] image or exact expression precise
[42:33] reproduction of god
[42:35] according to the greek lexicon when the
[42:37] holy ghost foreshadowed mary's womb and
[42:39] created jesus body
[42:40] all of god's character was in his son
[42:43] throughout jesus
[42:44] earthly life he never sinned the
[42:46] tendency of his flesh was to always rely
[42:48] upon
[42:49] the father's word always obeying god
[42:52] always acting like god would act for he
[42:54] was god's human image
[42:58] furthermore plural nouns were necessary
[43:00] because jesus body
[43:01] was a unique one-of-a-kind manifestation
[43:04] and creation
[43:05] jesus of nazareth was unlike any other
[43:07] human being in history
[43:09] god will never make another human body
[43:11] to be his
[43:12] image for christ is his only begotten
[43:14] son
[43:15] as declared six times in scripture also
[43:18] god knew he'd be using his son's
[43:20] physical body
[43:21] throughout all eternity which is why
[43:23] jesus said
[43:24] we will come unto him and make our abode
[43:26] with him
[43:28] by using we and our god is revealing
[43:30] that christians need both the father and
[43:32] son manifestations
[43:34] throughout eternity as they are
[43:36] indispensable
[43:37] the son's physical body reveals the
[43:39] invisible father
[43:40] for the father could not be seen without
[43:42] the son
[43:45] this conclusion about plural nouns is
[43:47] both scriptural
[43:48] and so much more safer reverent and
[43:51] ultimately pleasing to god
[43:53] compared to the sin of adding uninspired
[43:56] words
[43:57] to god's eternal inspired inerrant word
[44:01] proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 says adding
[44:04] to god's word carries the accusation of
[44:06] being reproved
[44:07] as a liar by god himself rest in the
[44:10] truth that god is not the author of
[44:12] confusion
[44:13] he is not trying to confuse us by using
[44:15] plural nouns
[44:17] rather he's helping us see the necessity
[44:19] of his manifestation in flesh
[44:21] the body of jesus christ through his
[44:24] son's body god could be seen held and
[44:26] handled
[44:27] for john says that which was from the
[44:29] beginning
[44:30] which we have heard which we have seen
[44:32] with our eyes
[44:33] which we have looked upon and our hands
[44:35] have handled of the word of life
[44:38] for the life was manifested and we have
[44:40] seen it and bear witness
[44:41] and show unto you that eternal life
[44:44] which was with the father
[44:45] and was manifested unto us if god is one
[44:49] person
[44:50] and not three how should a christian
[44:51] understand scriptures like genesis 1
[44:53] verse 26
[44:55] matthew 28 verse 19 and first john 5
[44:58] 7 that reference the father son and holy
[45:01] ghost
[45:02] by using god's provided words
[45:06] understanding genesis 1 verse 26
[45:10] trinitarians often cite genesis 1 verse
[45:13] 26
[45:14] as proof of multiple persons in the
[45:16] godhead based upon the plural pronoun
[45:19] us for god said let us make man in our
[45:22] image
[45:23] after our likeness this does not prove
[45:26] multiple persons in the godhead
[45:28] again trinitarians are adding to the
[45:30] word since genesis
[45:32] 1 verse 26 does not say let three
[45:35] persons
[45:36] us make man in our image before guessing
[45:39] about the meaning of let us
[45:41] it's essential to examine make in the
[45:43] verse
[45:44] for there is only one maker not two and
[45:47] not three
[45:48] malachi 2 verse 10 says we have one
[45:50] father
[45:51] one god created us there are not two
[45:54] creators
[45:55] only one isaiah 44 verse 24
[45:59] plainly states thus saith the lord thy
[46:02] redeemer
[46:03] and he that form thee from the womb i am
[46:05] the lord that maketh all things
[46:07] that stretcheth forth the heavens alone
[46:10] that spreadeth abroad the earth
[46:11] by myself the lord alone forms humans in
[46:15] the womb
[46:16] he alone stretched out the heavens the
[46:18] lord did all this
[46:20] by himself not with two other persons
[46:24] there are two possible explanations for
[46:26] the usage of us
[46:27] in genesis 1 verse 26
[46:30] first god is referring to himself and
[46:32] the angelic host
[46:34] because the lord used us in this manner
[46:37] in two other passages genesis 11 verse 7
[46:41] and isaiah 6 verse 8. in genesis 11
[46:44] verses
[46:45] 6 through 9 the lord or jehovah says
[46:49] let us go down and there confound their
[46:51] language
[46:52] and verses 8 and 9 record the lord only
[46:55] scattering the men at babel it's likely
[46:58] god came with his angels to scatter and
[47:00] confound the men
[47:01] just as god and two angels came down to
[47:04] earth to visit abraham and lot
[47:06] in genesis chapters 18 19.
[47:11] contrary wise it's impossible that a
[47:13] three-person god visited babel
[47:15] since the bible never describes god as
[47:18] three people
[47:19] isaiah 8 verses 1 through 8 describes
[47:22] isaiah's heavenly vision in which
[47:24] he sees heavenly beings called seraphims
[47:27] but then isaiah sees only one person not
[47:30] three
[47:31] sitting on heaven's throne the lord
[47:33] yahweh
[47:35] god was spiritually cleansing isaiah in
[47:37] order to send him to his people saying
[47:39] whom shall i send and who will go for us
[47:42] notice god's use of us as it seems to
[47:45] refer to god
[47:46] and the seraphims isaiah's preaching
[47:48] ministry was a necessary warning
[47:50] from god and his angels to israel before
[47:54] the backslidden nation was carried out
[47:56] of the promised land
[47:58] the second possibility is that led us in
[48:00] genesis 1 verse 26
[48:03] refers to the combined work of the
[48:04] father and son
[48:06] and yet this would not equate to two
[48:08] individual persons
[48:10] this would coincide with jesus's usage
[48:12] of us
[48:13] in reference to the father in john 17
[48:16] verse 21
[48:18] in the beginning let us means the
[48:20] invisible father
[48:21] used his word later acknowledged as
[48:24] christ
[48:25] in john 1 verses 1 through 3 to create
[48:28] man
[48:29] just as you use your spoken words to
[48:31] create your daily activities
[48:33] the invisible god used his words to
[48:35] create man
[48:36] and all things ephesians 3 verse 9
[48:40] supports this saying
[48:41] god created all things by jesus christ
[48:44] god created by his word he created by
[48:48] speaking are your words separate persons
[48:50] from you
[48:51] no they're your thoughts expressed in
[48:54] the same way
[48:55] jesus was god's thought expressed not a
[48:58] second person
[49:00] later god's word became a man and it was
[49:02] necessary for mankind's redemption for
[49:04] him
[49:05] to have attributes different from the
[49:07] father such as
[49:08] mortality and humanity but that did not
[49:11] make him a second person
[49:13] it only made christ the visible image of
[49:16] god's
[49:17] invisible person
[49:20] additionally the father and son shared
[49:23] one image
[49:24] not two in genesis 1 verse 26
[49:27] and god said let us make man in our
[49:30] image
[49:30] after our likeness this shows god's
[49:34] tendency to use a plural pronoun
[49:36] for his manifestations while having one
[49:38] image
[49:39] since you already know god is invisible
[49:41] and christ
[49:42] is god's one image in genesis chapter 1
[49:46] god's two manifestations shared one
[49:49] image
[49:50] which was a celestial body a celestial
[49:53] body is a spirit body
[49:54] like an angelic body and is invisible to
[49:57] the human eye
[49:58] under normal circumstances the father
[50:01] and son
[50:02] shared a celestial body and each angel
[50:04] had their own separate celestial body
[50:07] when god created man in genesis chapter
[50:09] 1 man was in a spirit body
[50:11] not a flesh body for that was god's
[50:14] image at that time
[50:15] it wasn't until genesis 2 verse 7 when
[50:18] god put man's spirit
[50:20] which had both masculine and feminine
[50:21] parts in a body of flesh
[50:26] understanding matthew 28 verse 19 and
[50:29] water baptism
[50:31] in matthew 28 verse 19 jesus says go ye
[50:34] therefore and teach all nations
[50:36] baptizing them in the name of the father
[50:38] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[50:41] while this verse is probably the most
[50:43] commonly used proof of the trinity
[50:45] close examination of it actually reveals
[50:48] god's one name
[50:49] and three titles the first revelation in
[50:52] this scripture is that there is one name
[50:55] not three names for the father son and
[50:58] holy ghost
[50:59] that is to be called upon at a
[51:00] believer's baptism
[51:02] jesus did not say to baptize in the
[51:04] names
[51:05] he said name singular since god is one
[51:09] person
[51:10] jesus commanded god's followers to be
[51:11] baptized in one name
[51:13] which the book of acts interprets as the
[51:16] lord jesus christ
[51:18] ten days after jesus said to baptize in
[51:20] the one name of the father and of the
[51:22] son
[51:22] and of the holy ghost peter commanded
[51:25] thousands to be baptized in the name of
[51:27] jesus christ since peter was freshly
[51:30] filled with the holy ghost
[51:31] he would not have contradicted jesus's
[51:34] commandment about baptism
[51:36] rather peter had the revelation that
[51:38] there is one name
[51:39] for the father son and holy ghost the
[51:42] lord jesus christ
[51:44] later in acts you'll find that philip
[51:47] and paul also baptize believers
[51:49] the same way peter did in the name of
[51:51] the lord jesus
[51:52] demonstrating unity among the holy
[51:54] ghost-filled preachers
[51:56] regarding the one name believers are to
[51:58] be baptized into
[52:00] you can search the entire new testament
[52:02] and you will never find one baptism
[52:04] recorded
[52:04] using the titles father son and holy
[52:07] ghost
[52:09] biblical and historical records validate
[52:12] that jesus apostles use the lord jesus
[52:15] christ
[52:15] baptism which is referred to as the
[52:18] apostolic baptism
[52:20] beginning on the day of pentecost around
[52:22] 30 a.d
[52:23] to at least 100 a.d when christians were
[52:26] recorded as being baptized
[52:28] in the name of the lord jesus in rome in
[52:31] other words the only baptismal formula
[52:34] used by jesus apostles was the name of
[52:37] the lord jesus christ
[52:38] non-biblical records pinpoint 100 a.d
[52:42] as the general time period the false
[52:44] trinitarian baptism
[52:46] or liturgical baptism was wrongly
[52:49] injected into christian circles
[52:51] to replace the true water baptism in
[52:53] jesus christ's name
[52:56] the interpreter's bible states that the
[52:58] early apostolic church had
[53:00] no trace of the father son holy ghost
[53:03] liturgical baptism
[53:04] and that it is not to be taken as part
[53:07] of jesus's original commission
[53:09] but comes from later liturgical use
[53:13] the encyclopedia britannica states the
[53:16] trinitarian formula
[53:17] and triune immersion were not uniformly
[53:20] used from the beginning
[53:22] the new standard encyclopedia states at
[53:24] first only adults were baptized
[53:27] generally by immersion and in christ's
[53:30] name
[53:30] only by the second century baptism in
[53:33] the name of the holy trinity
[53:35] and soon the practice of infant baptism
[53:37] was introduced
[53:40] the encyclopedia of early christianity
[53:42] records the
[53:43] father-son holy ghost baptismal phrase
[53:46] is frequently attested in the second
[53:48] century
[53:49] as a formula accompanying baptism
[53:53] the interpreter's dictionary of the
[53:55] bible says the evidence from the book of
[53:57] acts
[53:57] suggests that baptism in early
[53:59] christianity was administered
[54:01] not in the threefold name but in the
[54:03] name of jesus christ or
[54:05] in the name of the lord jesus
[54:10] be re-baptized if you were baptized
[54:12] incorrectly
[54:13] in the liturgical formula according to
[54:15] the book of acts in history
[54:17] correct baptism is the preacher
[54:19] pronouncing aloud
[54:21] your baptism in the name of the lord
[54:23] jesus christ
[54:24] and not the titles father son and holy
[54:26] ghost
[54:28] you need not be ashamed if you need to
[54:30] be re-baptized
[54:31] as re-baptism is scriptural in acts 19
[54:35] verses 1-6 ephesian believers learned
[54:38] from paul
[54:39] that the water baptism required to be
[54:40] filled with the holy ghost
[54:42] was to be performed in the name of the
[54:44] lord jesus christ
[54:46] the ephesians had previously been
[54:47] baptized through
[54:49] john the baptist method of water baptism
[54:52] which purpose was only repentance or
[54:54] justification
[54:56] but upon hearing paul's preaching they
[54:58] were re-baptized in the name of the lord
[55:00] jesus
[55:01] and then filled with the holy ghost when
[55:03] i learned this in 2002
[55:05] i was re-baptized in the name of the
[55:07] lord jesus christ
[55:08] because i wanted not only repentance but
[55:11] the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:13] i hope you'll have the literal name of
[55:15] the lord jesus christ pronounced over
[55:17] you
[55:18] at your baptism or re-baptism
[55:22] some trinitarians say that believers
[55:23] should use the father-son
[55:25] holy ghost baptismal formula of matthew
[55:28] 28 verse 19
[55:30] rather than the lord jesus christ
[55:32] formula because jesus's words have more
[55:34] weight
[55:35] than the apostles although jesus words
[55:38] are infallible
[55:39] their reasoning fails for three reasons
[55:42] first
[55:43] the apostles were filled with jesus's
[55:45] spirit the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:47] when they commanded new converts to be
[55:49] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[55:52] christ
[55:53] jesus said his spirit would lead
[55:54] believers into all truth
[55:56] and that is exactly what happened the
[55:58] holy spirit taught the apostles that the
[56:00] name of the lord jesus christ
[56:02] is the one name of the father son and
[56:04] holy ghost
[56:06] second this illogical trinitarian
[56:08] argument
[56:09] pits jesus against his apostles as if
[56:12] they were enemies
[56:13] how sad to purposely create division
[56:16] among jesus and his apostles
[56:18] just to scare people into accepting a
[56:20] creed-based baptism
[56:22] over the one true water baptism the
[56:25] truth is that jesus and the apostles
[56:27] were in one accord because they all had
[56:29] the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:31] bringing them into the unity of the
[56:33] spirit
[56:35] third denying and ignoring the five book
[56:38] of acts baptism
[56:39] examples would be taken away from the
[56:41] word of god
[56:42] which carries severe repercussions
[56:46] god's one name is a revelation that was
[56:48] kept secret for four thousand years
[56:51] until god unveiled it through his son as
[56:54] far back as
[56:55] eden god prophesied of the serpent
[56:57] bruising messiah
[56:58] and three thousand years after eden king
[57:01] agur
[57:02] inquired of christ's name asking what is
[57:05] his name
[57:06] and what is his son's name if thou canst
[57:08] tell
[57:09] messiah's name remained hidden because
[57:12] part of the prophecy related to jesus's
[57:14] mission
[57:15] was to speak in parables fulfilled in
[57:17] matthew 13
[57:18] and utter dark sayings or enigmas as the
[57:22] hebrew lexicon states
[57:24] christ's words about the father son and
[57:26] holy ghost in matthew 28 verse 19
[57:29] were a fulfillment of the dark sayings
[57:32] prophecy
[57:33] god had never spoken of father son and
[57:35] holy ghost in the old testament
[57:37] making jesus's words in matthew 28 19
[57:40] an enigma or concept difficult to
[57:44] understand for the carnal mind
[57:46] but jesus opened his disciples
[57:48] understanding regarding repentance
[57:50] and baptism before his ascension that
[57:53] they
[57:54] might know god's one name matthew 28
[57:56] verse 19 is still an enigma
[57:59] to many millions of church-goers
[58:01] thankfully
[58:02] through the foretold restoration of the
[58:04] last days god has revealed the enigma of
[58:07] his son's name
[58:08] that the lord jesus christ is the name
[58:10] above all names
[58:13] many titles but one name the three words
[58:16] father son and holy ghost are titles not
[58:19] names
[58:20] god has many many titles but just one
[58:23] name
[58:24] indeed i hold at least eight titles
[58:27] father
[58:27] son brother husband uncle pastor
[58:31] teacher friend but i am not eight
[58:34] separate persons
[58:35] if you apply the false trinitarian logic
[58:38] of god being three persons
[58:40] because of the three titles in matthew
[58:42] 28 verse 19
[58:43] then satan would be four persons because
[58:46] he is called
[58:47] great dragon old serpent devil and satan
[58:51] in revelation 12 9. as satan is not four
[58:54] persons
[58:55] god is not three persons god is one
[58:58] person who manifests himself in three
[59:00] ways
[59:01] to redeem mankind our savior has
[59:04] numerous
[59:05] beautiful and meaningful titles yet he
[59:07] is one person
[59:09] in the old testament he is called
[59:11] wonderful counselor
[59:12] the mighty god the everlasting father
[59:15] the prince of peace
[59:16] the righteous branch the desire of all
[59:19] nations
[59:20] king messiah the prince redeemer the
[59:23] headstone of the corner
[59:25] and son of righteousness to name a few
[59:28] likewise in the new testament he is
[59:29] called
[59:30] rock root and offspring of david bright
[59:33] and morning star
[59:34] resurrection and the life true vine true
[59:38] light
[59:38] the word of god alpha omega the
[59:41] beginning in the end
[59:42] and the first and last as the four
[59:45] beasts repeatedly cry in the temple
[59:48] jesus is lord god almighty
[59:51] what a glorious list of jesus titles yet
[59:54] these titles are not
[59:55] his one name which is above every name
[59:58] which
[59:59] is jesus christ this is proven by the
[1:00:01] fact that demons were cast out
[1:00:03] only using the literal name of jesus
[1:00:05] christ not his titles
[1:00:08] believers were baptized only using the
[1:00:10] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:12] not the titles father son and holy ghost
[1:00:15] miracles were done
[1:00:16] only using the name of jesus christ not
[1:00:19] the righteous bran
[1:00:20] for instance it is necessary to
[1:00:23] recognize that the literal name of god
[1:00:25] the lord jesus christ is the name above
[1:00:27] all names
[1:00:29] once recognized it can be used
[1:00:30] powerfully and reverently
[1:00:32] as god desires power in the name of
[1:00:36] jesus
[1:00:38] once i recognize god's name the lord
[1:00:40] jesus christ
[1:00:42] it became a source of power to
[1:00:44] accomplish his will
[1:00:45] in my life and ministry first when i
[1:00:48] became a christian before my preaching
[1:00:50] ministry
[1:00:51] i felt god's forgiveness when i was
[1:00:52] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:00:55] christ
[1:00:56] i'd been baptized twice before once in
[1:00:59] the titles
[1:01:00] father son and holy ghost and once in
[1:01:02] jesus's name only
[1:01:04] but never felt forgiven faith in god's
[1:01:07] true name
[1:01:07] allowed me to experience his saving
[1:01:09] grace when i was buried
[1:01:11] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:01:14] second i experienced freedom from
[1:01:15] numerous addictions
[1:01:17] through jesus christ literal name as i
[1:01:19] would speak his name out loud against
[1:01:21] tobacco
[1:01:22] pornography idolatry and more
[1:01:25] before recognizing god's name the lord
[1:01:28] jesus christ
[1:01:29] i was a helpless slave to sin
[1:01:32] when my preaching ministry began i spoke
[1:01:34] the name of jesus christ
[1:01:36] through his leading and watched his
[1:01:38] power cast out devils
[1:01:40] heal the sick bring deliverance to the
[1:01:42] addicted bring forth babies for the
[1:01:44] barren
[1:01:45] and more while it may not be impossible
[1:01:48] i have not yet witnessed any miracle or
[1:01:51] movement of god's spirit
[1:01:53] by speaking aloud any of god's titles
[1:01:55] such as father
[1:01:57] son holy ghost prince of peace or
[1:01:59] righteous branch
[1:02:01] when i started speaking in god's literal
[1:02:03] name i began seeing the power and
[1:02:05] authority that accompanies it
[1:02:09] the entire bible teaches that god's name
[1:02:11] has power
[1:02:12] and believers experience it when they
[1:02:13] have faith in his name
[1:02:15] according to acts 3 verse 16 and his
[1:02:18] name
[1:02:19] through faith in his name hath made this
[1:02:21] man strong
[1:02:22] when david defeated goliath in 1st
[1:02:24] samuel 17
[1:02:26] verse 45 he said he came against the
[1:02:28] giant
[1:02:29] in the name of the lord of hosts having
[1:02:31] faith in the lord's name
[1:02:33] was the source of power and accuracy in
[1:02:36] david's stone and sling
[1:02:38] john 1 verse 12 teaches those that
[1:02:40] receive christ
[1:02:41] receive his power because they believe
[1:02:44] in his name
[1:02:45] acts 4 verse 7 emphatically declares a
[1:02:48] name is synonymous with power
[1:02:50] for it says by what power or by what
[1:02:53] name
[1:02:53] have you done this in this instance
[1:02:56] peter was being questioned
[1:02:57] how the previously lame man had received
[1:03:00] perfect soundness of health
[1:03:02] and the ability to walk in verse 10
[1:03:05] peter's answer was
[1:03:06] by the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:03:09] whom he crucified
[1:03:11] whom god raised from the dead even by
[1:03:13] him doth this man stand here before you
[1:03:16] whole the authority or power in jesus
[1:03:19] christ's name
[1:03:20] made the lame man whole
[1:03:24] humans can relate to the concept of a
[1:03:25] name representing power
[1:03:27] since human names carry reputations and
[1:03:30] have authority
[1:03:32] proverbs 22 verse 1 says a good name
[1:03:35] is rather to be chosen than great riches
[1:03:38] and loving favor
[1:03:39] rather than silver and gold your actions
[1:03:42] have a powerful influence
[1:03:44] on others which create your good name or
[1:03:47] reputation
[1:03:49] your name's authority is displayed when
[1:03:51] you purchase something with your credit
[1:03:53] card
[1:03:53] or with a check because the transaction
[1:03:56] isn't complete until you've applied your
[1:03:58] signature
[1:03:59] to the receipt or check if i sign my
[1:04:02] checks using my titles father son and
[1:04:04] brother
[1:04:05] my check will not be honored because
[1:04:06] they require the authority
[1:04:08] of my literal name another example is
[1:04:11] the name on a power of attorney document
[1:04:14] banks and businesses will honor only the
[1:04:17] one name that is certified and notarized
[1:04:20] as being a power of attorney no other
[1:04:23] titles or names have power
[1:04:25] in the same way god's literal name the
[1:04:27] lord jesus christ
[1:04:28] the name which is above every name is
[1:04:31] the only name that carries
[1:04:32] authority or power when spoken in faith
[1:04:36] paul declares that christ's power or
[1:04:38] name would be denied
[1:04:40] in the last days by egotistical
[1:04:43] self-absorbed imposters of christianity
[1:04:46] who have a form of godliness but not
[1:04:48] true godliness
[1:04:50] are christian churches teaching their
[1:04:52] members to cast out devils in the name
[1:04:54] of jesus christ
[1:04:55] as paul did in acts 16 verse 18
[1:04:59] or are they denying that power turn away
[1:05:02] from any church that denies this power
[1:05:05] very few churches teach the reality of
[1:05:07] the power
[1:05:08] in jesus name this fulfills direct
[1:05:11] prophecy about the intent of the beast
[1:05:14] or antichrist spirit in revelation 13
[1:05:17] verses 5 and 6. as satan blasphemes
[1:05:21] god's name
[1:05:22] tabernacle and the saints in heaven
[1:05:25] blasphemy means to slander or detract in
[1:05:28] the greek
[1:05:29] meaning satan reduces and takes away the
[1:05:31] value
[1:05:32] or worth of god's name the popularity of
[1:05:36] the trinity
[1:05:36] has valued and exalted the titles father
[1:05:39] son and holy ghost
[1:05:41] far above the name of jesus christ
[1:05:44] thereby blaspheming god's true name
[1:05:46] much to the enemy's delight few
[1:05:49] christians are baptized in jesus
[1:05:51] christ's name
[1:05:52] even fewer perform miracles and cast out
[1:05:55] devils in jesus christ's name
[1:05:57] instead they are taught to bless
[1:05:59] themselves using the sign of the cross
[1:06:02] in the titles father son and holy ghost
[1:06:04] and yet scripture says blessing
[1:06:06] oneself is a sign that a heart is turned
[1:06:09] away
[1:06:10] from serving god
[1:06:13] understanding first john 5 7.
[1:06:17] first john 5 verse 7 reads for there are
[1:06:20] three that bear record in heaven
[1:06:21] the father the word and the holy ghost
[1:06:24] and these three are one does this prove
[1:06:27] god is three persons
[1:06:29] no for it never says god is three
[1:06:31] persons but rather gives extra support
[1:06:34] that god is one person for it says these
[1:06:37] three
[1:06:37] are one not three
[1:06:40] what first john 5 7 does offer
[1:06:43] is more proof that god has three
[1:06:45] manifestations
[1:06:46] he uses to redeem mankind just as
[1:06:49] matthew 28 verse 19
[1:06:52] lists these three forms father son and
[1:06:54] holy ghost
[1:06:56] as evidence that son is a title and not
[1:06:59] a name
[1:07:00] the scripture calls the son the word
[1:07:02] which is a suitable alias for the same
[1:07:04] manifestation
[1:07:06] for the son is the word made flesh
[1:07:09] the gospel of john and book of
[1:07:10] revelation both teach this saying
[1:07:13] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:07:15] word was with god
[1:07:16] and the word was god and the word was
[1:07:18] made flesh
[1:07:19] and dwelt among us and he was clothed
[1:07:23] with a vesture dipped in blood
[1:07:25] and his name is called the word of god
[1:07:28] this little known truth of god's three
[1:07:30] manifestations
[1:07:32] bearing record in heaven requires
[1:07:34] attention
[1:07:35] god will use his three manifestations
[1:07:37] father
[1:07:38] son and holy ghost to serve as multiple
[1:07:41] witnesses in heaven
[1:07:42] either for or against all mankind no
[1:07:45] matter which time period men lived in
[1:07:48] before christ's earthly ministry during
[1:07:50] or
[1:07:51] after there will be a heavenly record of
[1:07:53] how they treated god's word
[1:07:55] the three bearing record in heaven
[1:07:57] cannot mean there are three persons
[1:07:58] sitting on judgment thrones in heaven
[1:08:00] for scripture never states there are
[1:08:02] three heavenly thrones
[1:08:04] or even two for that matter there is
[1:08:07] only one throne
[1:08:10] the father is the heavenly witness
[1:08:11] either in favor of or against all men
[1:08:14] who lived
[1:08:15] before jesus christ walk the earth the
[1:08:17] loving father will witness that he sent
[1:08:19] men anointed of his spirit to preach
[1:08:22] warn
[1:08:22] and lead the people enoch preached the
[1:08:25] father's warning
[1:08:26] for jude says he prophesied of these
[1:08:29] saying behold
[1:08:30] the lord cometh with ten thousand of his
[1:08:32] saints to execute judgment
[1:08:34] upon all and to convince all that are
[1:08:37] ungodly among them
[1:08:38] of all their ungodly deeds which they
[1:08:41] have ungodly committed
[1:08:42] and of all their hard speeches which
[1:08:44] ungodly sinners
[1:08:46] have spoken against him
[1:08:49] moses also served as the father's
[1:08:51] witness when he reminded israel of their
[1:08:53] covenant with jehovah
[1:08:55] saying i call heaven and earth to record
[1:08:57] this day against you
[1:08:59] that i have set before you life and
[1:09:00] death blessing and cursing
[1:09:02] therefore choose life that both thou and
[1:09:05] thy seed
[1:09:06] may live
[1:09:09] about 400 years before christ god the
[1:09:12] father spoke through the prophet malachi
[1:09:14] telling israel how he was a witness that
[1:09:16] the men had dealt treacherously
[1:09:18] with their wives and he was no longer
[1:09:20] going to receive their offerings or
[1:09:22] tears
[1:09:23] this scripture illuminates the fact that
[1:09:25] the father's eyes plainly see
[1:09:27] into our homes and that nothing is hid
[1:09:30] from the lord
[1:09:32] jesus the son is a heavenly witness
[1:09:35] because both his works
[1:09:36] and words will bear record of his
[1:09:38] ministry concerning his works christ
[1:09:41] says
[1:09:42] the works which the father hath given me
[1:09:44] to finish the same works that i do bear
[1:09:46] witness of me
[1:09:47] that the father has sent me and the
[1:09:49] father himself which hath sent me
[1:09:52] hath born witness of me jesus's
[1:09:54] preaching will have an
[1:09:55] equally weighty heavenly witness on
[1:09:58] judgment day
[1:09:58] for he says the word that i have spoken
[1:10:01] the same shall judge him in the last day
[1:10:04] jesus shockingly declared that the
[1:10:06] generation that rejected his earthly
[1:10:08] preaching
[1:10:09] would have two witnesses rise up against
[1:10:11] them in condemnation
[1:10:12] on the day of judgment the men of
[1:10:15] nineveh and the queen of the south
[1:10:18] the ninevites repentance proves heaven
[1:10:20] is recording which people truly change
[1:10:22] their hearts and lives
[1:10:23] after hearing gospel preaching heaven
[1:10:26] also records the lengths people will go
[1:10:28] to hear god's preaching as the queen of
[1:10:31] the south's
[1:10:31] testimony validates
[1:10:35] the holy ghost bears record on all
[1:10:36] mankind now
[1:10:38] because jesus's body currently sits at
[1:10:40] the right hand of the majesty on high
[1:10:43] acts chapter 5 verses 31 and 32
[1:10:46] teaches that the holy ghost currently
[1:10:47] gives witness to jesus's death
[1:10:50] resurrection and exaltation this witness
[1:10:53] is that the obedient christian is born
[1:10:55] again or given the holy ghost as a gift
[1:10:57] from god
[1:10:58] the miracle-producing presence of the
[1:11:00] holy ghost in the ministries
[1:11:02] of genuine christians is also god's
[1:11:04] witness to all generations
[1:11:06] as taught in hebrews 2 verses 1 through
[1:11:09] 4.
[1:11:10] it's immensely important to recognize
[1:11:12] the witness of the holy ghost today
[1:11:14] for jesus said speaking against it will
[1:11:16] not be forgiven
[1:11:18] in this world neither in the world to
[1:11:20] come
[1:11:23] when first john 5 verse 7 is closely
[1:11:25] examined
[1:11:26] it's clear that john was not listing
[1:11:28] three persons
[1:11:30] but rather god's three manifestations
[1:11:32] that serve as
[1:11:33] heavenly witnesses for the actions of
[1:11:35] all humanity
[1:11:39] understanding jesus's baptism does
[1:11:42] jesus's water baptism at the jordan
[1:11:44] river prove
[1:11:45] god is three persons no for if it did
[1:11:48] that would prove christianity is
[1:11:50] tritheism the belief in three distinct
[1:11:52] gods
[1:11:54] to put it simply jesus baptism shows
[1:11:56] god's power
[1:11:57] to manifest himself simultaneously in
[1:12:00] multiple ways
[1:12:01] an attribute he previously displayed in
[1:12:04] the old testament
[1:12:06] at the burning bush in exodus 3 verses 1
[1:12:08] through 6
[1:12:09] moses witnessed god manifest himself in
[1:12:12] two supernatural ways
[1:12:14] by voice and fire some might see two
[1:12:17] persons here
[1:12:18] father as the voice and holy ghost as
[1:12:20] the fire
[1:12:22] recall that the holy ghost appeared as
[1:12:24] 120 licks of fire
[1:12:26] in acts chapter 2 verses 3 and 4.
[1:12:29] but that does not mean he is 120
[1:12:32] separate persons
[1:12:33] nothing in the exodus text speaks of
[1:12:36] multiple personalities
[1:12:38] the voice and fire were not showing god
[1:12:40] was two separate persons
[1:12:42] but revealed his power to appear in
[1:12:44] different forms
[1:12:45] simultaneously paul says god's invisible
[1:12:48] spirit
[1:12:48] hides inside the light of the fire in
[1:12:51] 1st timothy 6 verse 16
[1:12:54] who only hath immortality dwelling in
[1:12:56] the light which no man can approach
[1:12:58] unto when jesus was baptized
[1:13:01] many erroneously see three persons
[1:13:05] father as the voice sun in the water and
[1:13:07] holy ghost as the dove
[1:13:09] the true understanding is that god spoke
[1:13:11] from heaven while his own spirit
[1:13:13] not a third person descended like a dove
[1:13:16] upon the man
[1:13:17] christ jesus god's three manifestations
[1:13:21] at jesus baptism do not prove three
[1:13:24] persons
[1:13:25] just as the 120 licks of fire on the day
[1:13:28] of pentecost
[1:13:29] do not prove the holy spirit is 120
[1:13:32] separate persons
[1:13:34] when understood correctly jesus baptism
[1:13:36] shows one invisible person
[1:13:38] anointing his visible human image
[1:13:41] since god the father is the holy ghost
[1:13:44] jesus baptism shows one invisible person
[1:13:46] coming to inhabit
[1:13:48] the body or temple he created
[1:13:51] imagine a hand filling a glove once
[1:13:53] inside the glove
[1:13:55] the hand does not become a second
[1:13:56] distinct hand rather it's the same hand
[1:13:59] veil behind an image like a glove
[1:14:02] jesus body is the image god's person
[1:14:05] dwells within
[1:14:06] jesus is not a second person but the
[1:14:09] single
[1:14:09] visual representation of god
[1:14:14] consider the three errors of trinitarian
[1:14:16] logic regarding jesus baptism
[1:14:19] first it's an heir to believe the
[1:14:21] co-equal son
[1:14:22] was anointed by the co-equal holy spirit
[1:14:25] you're probably where the bible says
[1:14:27] jesus was anointed of the holy ghost
[1:14:29] in acts 10 verse 38 so why does
[1:14:32] trinitarianism teach
[1:14:33] the son needs a third person to anoint
[1:14:36] him
[1:14:36] if he is already fully eternal god
[1:14:41] a fully divine person should not need to
[1:14:44] be anointed by another
[1:14:46] fully divine person here we see how
[1:14:48] trinitarianism leads to tritheism
[1:14:51] since one god needs anointed by another
[1:14:53] god
[1:14:54] the truth is that jesus's human body was
[1:14:57] powerless on its own
[1:14:58] proven by jesus's own words in john 5
[1:15:01] verse 19 verily verily i say unto you
[1:15:05] the son can do nothing of himself but
[1:15:07] what he seeth the father do
[1:15:09] for what things so ever he doeth these
[1:15:11] also do at the sun
[1:15:12] likewise jesus gave the father credit
[1:15:15] for his miracles
[1:15:16] as john 14 verse 10 says the father that
[1:15:19] dwelleth in me
[1:15:20] he doeth the works christ needed to be
[1:15:23] filled with the holy ghost
[1:15:24] and receive that filling at his river
[1:15:27] jordan baptism
[1:15:28] prior to jesus's resurrection his human
[1:15:31] body was not immortal
[1:15:33] it was mortal didn't know all things and
[1:15:36] died
[1:15:39] second trinitarianism has another
[1:15:41] problem
[1:15:42] related to the first supposedly jesus
[1:15:45] was filled with the third person of the
[1:15:46] trinity
[1:15:47] at his baptism but the doctrine doesn't
[1:15:49] explain when jesus was filled with the
[1:15:51] first person
[1:15:52] the father jesus plainly said the father
[1:15:55] dwell in him
[1:15:56] in john 14 verse 10 but the father that
[1:15:59] dwelt in me
[1:16:00] he doeth the works how could god the
[1:16:02] father be pleased with his son
[1:16:04] at his baptism saying this is my beloved
[1:16:06] son in whom i'm well pleased
[1:16:08] when he was not dwelling in jesus god
[1:16:11] the father said he would put his own
[1:16:13] spirit
[1:16:13] not another person's spirit in his son
[1:16:16] in isaiah 42 verse 1 saying behold
[1:16:20] my servant whom i uphold mine elect
[1:16:23] in whom my soul delighteth i have put my
[1:16:25] spirit upon him
[1:16:28] third trinitarianism implies jesus had
[1:16:30] two separate distinct
[1:16:32] persons living inside him despite the
[1:16:34] bible never saying two persons dwell in
[1:16:37] him
[1:16:37] scripture says both the father john 14
[1:16:40] verse 10
[1:16:41] and holy ghost luke 4 verse 1 dwell in
[1:16:45] jesus body
[1:16:46] if the trinity is true then two separate
[1:16:48] distinct persons dwell in one person
[1:16:51] but the truth is that the father and
[1:16:52] holy ghost are the self-same person
[1:16:55] jesus did not suffer with did the
[1:16:58] multiple personalities disorder
[1:17:00] truly jesus baptism shows the one person
[1:17:03] the father spirit coming to fill and
[1:17:06] lead
[1:17:07] his human image his son
[1:17:11] fourth some believe the holy ghost that
[1:17:12] descended like a dove upon
[1:17:14] jesus body exists eternally as a visible
[1:17:17] dove
[1:17:18] the book of revelation along with the
[1:17:20] rest of the bible
[1:17:21] never mentions a third person as an
[1:17:23] eternal dove roosting in heaven next to
[1:17:25] two thrones
[1:17:26] although trinitarian artwork displays
[1:17:28] this falsehood
[1:17:29] the holy ghost is not a literal dove he
[1:17:32] only appeared
[1:17:32] like a dove at jesus baptism as a sign
[1:17:35] for john the baptist
[1:17:37] to identify the lamb of god the holy
[1:17:39] spirit changed its form from dove
[1:17:41] to 120 licks of fire in acts chapter 2.
[1:17:46] at his baptism in matthew 3 verse 15
[1:17:49] jesus said he must fulfill all
[1:17:50] righteousness
[1:17:51] which has two meanings first he was
[1:17:54] setting the example of righteous
[1:17:55] obedience for new testament believers to
[1:17:58] be baptized and filled with the holy
[1:17:59] ghost
[1:18:00] which was later preached by peter in
[1:18:02] acts 2 verse 38.
[1:18:05] repentance is the prerequisite for water
[1:18:07] baptism
[1:18:08] which is followed by the spiritual
[1:18:09] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:12] in jesus case he didn't need repentance
[1:18:14] unto baptism like all believers need
[1:18:17] but he did it as an example however
[1:18:20] jesus did need to be filled with the
[1:18:21] holy spirit
[1:18:22] after his baptism as scripture says the
[1:18:24] spirit descended
[1:18:26] from heaven and then abode lived
[1:18:29] and remained on him when he came up out
[1:18:31] of the water
[1:18:33] luke 4 verse 1 says jesus left jordan
[1:18:35] full of the holy ghost
[1:18:36] and was immediately led by the spirit
[1:18:39] into the wilderness
[1:18:40] jesus was given the spirit without
[1:18:42] measure and personally verified he
[1:18:44] received the baptism of the spirit
[1:18:46] saying are you able to drink of the cup
[1:18:48] that i shall drink of
[1:18:50] and to be baptized with the baptism that
[1:18:52] i am baptized with
[1:18:54] god's righteous design is that filling
[1:18:56] or anointing
[1:18:57] comes after washing
[1:19:00] elijah's burnt sacrifice on mount carmel
[1:19:03] was first drenched with four barrels of
[1:19:05] water
[1:19:05] and then the fire of god fell from
[1:19:07] heaven moses
[1:19:09] aaron and his sons were commanded by god
[1:19:11] to wash in water before approaching god
[1:19:13] at the completion of the tabernacle in
[1:19:16] the wilderness
[1:19:17] and afterwards the glory of the lord
[1:19:19] filled the tabernacle
[1:19:21] similarly jesus's temple of his body had
[1:19:24] to be washed before the holy ghost
[1:19:26] filled him second christ was baptized in
[1:19:30] order to fulfill
[1:19:30] the righteous old testament command for
[1:19:33] burnt offerings to be washed
[1:19:35] according to leviticus chapter 1 verses
[1:19:38] 1 through 9.
[1:19:39] burnt offerings were a sweet savor unto
[1:19:41] the lord and paul says jesus
[1:19:43] hath given himself for us an offering
[1:19:46] and a sacrifice to god
[1:19:48] for a sweet smelling savor jesus being
[1:19:50] washed at his baptism
[1:19:52] was later offered as god's perfect
[1:19:54] complete and acceptable
[1:19:56] burnt offering understanding jesus's
[1:19:59] prayers
[1:20:00] in gethsemane although jesus prayed
[1:20:03] throughout his ministry
[1:20:05] his gethsemane prayers reveal his full
[1:20:07] humanity
[1:20:08] and help prove god's one personality
[1:20:11] jesus's prayers cannot prove god is
[1:20:13] three persons
[1:20:14] because the supposed co-equal co-eternal
[1:20:17] son
[1:20:17] would not need to pray to another
[1:20:20] co-equal co-eternal person
[1:20:22] the father three eternal persons is
[1:20:24] always equivalent
[1:20:25] to polytheism jesus's gethsemane prayer
[1:20:29] shows jesus was 100 human and 100
[1:20:33] percent deity
[1:20:35] yet this doesn't equal two co-equal gods
[1:20:38] the human part of the son had a separate
[1:20:40] will than the eternal father
[1:20:42] as christ says father if thou be willing
[1:20:45] remove this cup from me
[1:20:47] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:20:50] done
[1:20:51] jesus's flesh although sinless did not
[1:20:53] want to die
[1:20:54] but obediently surrendered to the will
[1:20:56] of the father
[1:20:58] jesus's humanity needed god's deity just
[1:21:01] as your humanity
[1:21:02] needs god's deity the difference between
[1:21:05] jesus and you
[1:21:06] is that jesus's humanity had a word
[1:21:08] nature while your humanity
[1:21:10] has a sin nature does the mention of two
[1:21:13] wills
[1:21:14] jesus fleshly will and the father's will
[1:21:16] equal two separate persons
[1:21:19] no but it does teach that jesus body was
[1:21:21] a one of a kind human manifestation
[1:21:23] god was manifest in the flesh that had
[1:21:26] to have a separate will and
[1:21:28] pronoun in order to die for mankind
[1:21:30] since the immortal spirit god
[1:21:32] could never die god didn't become a
[1:21:35] second person in the body of jesus
[1:21:37] he was the same person in another form
[1:21:40] god in human form
[1:21:41] manifest in the flesh the word became
[1:21:44] flesh
[1:21:45] god became flesh the father and son were
[1:21:47] one in nature
[1:21:49] the word but with different
[1:21:50] characteristics
[1:21:54] other threefold references accompanying
[1:21:57] matthew 28
[1:21:58] verse 19 first john 5 verse 7
[1:22:02] and jesus baptism are threefold
[1:22:04] references to the godhead
[1:22:06] such as both paul and john's epistle
[1:22:09] greetings and benedictions
[1:22:11] second corinthians 13 verse 14 is a
[1:22:14] widely known example
[1:22:15] saying the grace of the lord jesus
[1:22:17] christ and the love of god
[1:22:19] and the communion of the holy ghost be
[1:22:21] with you all
[1:22:22] do threefold references to the godhead
[1:22:24] like this prove god is three persons
[1:22:27] no for these references never call god
[1:22:29] three persons
[1:22:30] but they do prove how necessary it is
[1:22:33] for believers to recognize
[1:22:35] god's three manifestations
[1:22:38] recall that first john 5 7 says the
[1:22:41] father word and holy ghost
[1:22:43] are heavenly witnesses for or against
[1:22:45] all mankind
[1:22:46] proving the absolute necessity for
[1:22:48] believers to recognize
[1:22:50] god's three manifestations including the
[1:22:52] one in which they live
[1:22:54] for example we are living in the age of
[1:22:56] the holy ghost manifestation
[1:22:58] for the son of man is no longer on the
[1:22:59] earth and has ascended to the right hand
[1:23:02] of the father
[1:23:03] if we neglect or speak evil of the holy
[1:23:05] ghost today
[1:23:06] there is no hope of forgiveness for
[1:23:08] christ says
[1:23:09] but unto him that blasphemeth against
[1:23:11] the holy ghost
[1:23:12] it shall not be forgiven in jesus
[1:23:15] earthly ministry he harshly warned the
[1:23:16] pharisees
[1:23:17] to not reject his son manifestation
[1:23:20] saying
[1:23:21] for if ye believe not that i am he ye
[1:23:23] shall die in your sins
[1:23:25] the pharisees could apparently accept
[1:23:26] god in the father manifestation
[1:23:28] but not god's current manifestation in
[1:23:30] the son and so condemnation awaited
[1:23:33] their unbelieving hearts
[1:23:37] as you examine paul and john's epistle
[1:23:39] greetings you'll find their emphasis was
[1:23:41] on the father and son
[1:23:42] and not upon worshipping three persons
[1:23:45] four examples of epistle greetings
[1:23:47] mention the father and son
[1:23:49] but nothing of the holy ghost romans 1
[1:23:51] verse 7
[1:23:53] first corinthians 1 verse 3 first john 1
[1:23:56] verse 3
[1:23:57] and 2nd john 1 verse 3. does this mean
[1:24:00] paul believed in only two persons
[1:24:02] so he left out the third person of the
[1:24:04] trinity
[1:24:06] no it means it was not necessary to
[1:24:08] mention the holy ghost because paul knew
[1:24:10] the father and holy ghost are the
[1:24:12] self-same person
[1:24:14] returning to scriptures with threefold
[1:24:16] references it seems god
[1:24:18] allows this to help believers better
[1:24:20] understand the enigma
[1:24:21] of the father son and holy ghost in
[1:24:24] second corinthians 13 verse 14
[1:24:27] paul mentions the grace of the lord
[1:24:28] jesus christ and the love of god
[1:24:30] and the communion of the holy ghost
[1:24:33] although the three attributes all
[1:24:34] pertain to god
[1:24:36] grace love communion paul uses each one
[1:24:39] separately to help believers appreciate
[1:24:41] each manifestation for example paul said
[1:24:44] the grace of christ would be with
[1:24:45] believers
[1:24:46] which supports john's words that christ
[1:24:49] was
[1:24:49] full of grace and truth and by grace
[1:24:52] jesus tasted death for every man
[1:24:54] next paul emphasized the love of god
[1:24:57] john 3 verse 16 and romans 8 verses 38
[1:25:00] and 39
[1:25:01] explained god's great love that caused
[1:25:03] him to send his son to die for our
[1:25:05] salvation
[1:25:06] and speak of ten things that cannot
[1:25:08] separate us from the love of god
[1:25:11] third paul ends the verse by wisely
[1:25:13] pointing out the believer's current
[1:25:14] communion of the holy ghost christians
[1:25:17] today have communion with the holy ghost
[1:25:19] who is the self-same person as the
[1:25:21] father god's plan was for the son to
[1:25:23] have
[1:25:23] only about three and a half years of
[1:25:25] earthly communion
[1:25:27] with jesus's disciples peter james john
[1:25:30] and the rest of the apostles were
[1:25:32] privileged to commune
[1:25:33] with the son face to face but our lot is
[1:25:36] communion with christ through the
[1:25:37] comforter
[1:25:38] the holy ghost just as jesus taught in
[1:25:41] john 14 verse 26
[1:25:43] saying but the comforter which is the
[1:25:45] holy ghost
[1:25:46] whom the father will send in my name he
[1:25:48] shall teach you all things
[1:25:50] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:25:52] whatsoever i have said
[1:25:54] unto you
[1:25:58] is jesus the eternal son some
[1:26:00] trinitarians give jesus the title
[1:26:02] eternal son
[1:26:04] which probably originates from the
[1:26:05] athanasian creed the creed says
[1:26:08] the father is eternal the son is eternal
[1:26:11] the holy spirit is eternal but the
[1:26:13] eternal sun title
[1:26:15] is both absent from the bible and
[1:26:17] deceiving
[1:26:18] because it alludes to jesus and the
[1:26:20] father eternally existing as two
[1:26:22] separate persons in heaven the truth is
[1:26:24] jesus's human body
[1:26:26] did not exist until god's spirit formed
[1:26:28] it in mary's womb
[1:26:30] christ's body had a beginning but his
[1:26:32] spirit or nature
[1:26:33] the word did not jesus was and always
[1:26:36] will be the word
[1:26:37] god's nature but christ is not a
[1:26:40] separate person from god
[1:26:42] the eternal sun title is
[1:26:44] self-contradictory
[1:26:45] because the word son automatically
[1:26:47] suggests a beginning point
[1:26:49] branham says people talk about jesus
[1:26:52] being the eternal son of god
[1:26:54] now isn't that a contradiction whoever
[1:26:56] heard of a son being eternal
[1:26:58] sons have beginnings but that which is
[1:27:00] eternal
[1:27:01] never had a beginning he is the eternal
[1:27:03] god jehovah
[1:27:05] manifested in the flesh the implication
[1:27:08] of the eternal son dwelling with the
[1:27:10] eternal father
[1:27:11] and eternal spirit is the declaration of
[1:27:14] three gods
[1:27:15] which is easily detected in today's
[1:27:17] influential pastors
[1:27:19] with all due respect to rick warren
[1:27:20] whose purpose-driven life book contains
[1:27:23] many truths
[1:27:24] it also contains false trinitarian
[1:27:27] teachings
[1:27:28] the first misunderstanding is warned
[1:27:30] saying god invites us to enjoy
[1:27:32] friendship and fellowship with all three
[1:27:34] persons of the trinity
[1:27:36] this falsehood is nowhere found in
[1:27:37] scripture but the opposite is true
[1:27:40] the prophets isaiah ezekiel and john the
[1:27:42] revelator
[1:27:43] had fellowship with only one person in
[1:27:46] their heavenly visions
[1:27:48] no bible passage ever teaches believers
[1:27:50] to have present or future fellowship
[1:27:52] with three separate persons thankfully
[1:27:54] christians do not have
[1:27:56] the pressure of giving equal fellowship
[1:27:58] with three separate persons
[1:28:02] another heir is warn teaching the
[1:28:04] trinity is god's relationship to himself
[1:28:06] it's the perfect pattern for relational
[1:28:08] harmony and we should study
[1:28:10] its implications god has always existed
[1:28:13] in loving relationship to himself
[1:28:15] so he has never been lonely he didn't
[1:28:17] need a family
[1:28:19] it's true that god has never been lonely
[1:28:21] as paul says god does not need
[1:28:23] anything in acts 17 verse 25. the book
[1:28:26] of isaiah states the lord who has no
[1:28:28] equal
[1:28:29] made all things alone by himself proving
[1:28:32] creation was done by one person
[1:28:34] not three it's incorrect to say god has
[1:28:37] a relationship to himself
[1:28:39] which means he has relationships with
[1:28:41] two other trinity members
[1:28:43] the implication of a three-person god
[1:28:45] having a relationship to himself
[1:28:47] is god managing a multiple personalities
[1:28:49] disorder
[1:28:50] god is one person with no co-equal
[1:28:53] persons
[1:28:54] existing beside him god does not have to
[1:28:57] balance three personalities
[1:28:59] the truth is that god does have
[1:29:01] relationship with his manifested
[1:29:02] thoughts god is the only one in the
[1:29:05] universe that has this power and
[1:29:06] privilege
[1:29:07] as the omnipotent eternal ever invisible
[1:29:10] holy god
[1:29:11] he dwelt alone with his thoughts inside
[1:29:13] his being well before he created
[1:29:15] angels and the universe god wasn't
[1:29:18] having relationship with his thoughts
[1:29:20] because they needed to be expressed as
[1:29:22] individual persons before that could
[1:29:24] occur
[1:29:25] every christian is a manifested thought
[1:29:27] of god as second corinthians 6
[1:29:30] 16 teaches god expressed believers to be
[1:29:33] temples of his
[1:29:34] as god hath said i will dwell in them
[1:29:37] and walk in them
[1:29:38] and i will be their god and they shall
[1:29:40] be my people
[1:29:42] you were previously an eternal thought
[1:29:44] of god
[1:29:46] and now that you're expressed in a flesh
[1:29:48] body god can come
[1:29:49] and live and walk in you god fellowships
[1:29:52] with you by living
[1:29:53] inside you before god created humans he
[1:29:57] did have a relationship with his son
[1:30:00] the logos but not as a separate person
[1:30:03] jesus confirms us twice in john 17
[1:30:06] saying
[1:30:07] o father glorify thou me with thine own
[1:30:10] self
[1:30:10] with the glory which i had with thee
[1:30:12] before the world was
[1:30:14] and for thou lovest me before the
[1:30:16] foundation of the world
[1:30:18] this doesn't mean god is two persons but
[1:30:21] it shows jesus spiritual body
[1:30:23] was god's first creation since jesus
[1:30:25] says he is
[1:30:26] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:30:30] before earth and humans were created a
[1:30:32] celestial body or spirit
[1:30:34] body came out of the invisible god
[1:30:37] scholars call this body the logos which
[1:30:39] is the greek word
[1:30:40] for word in john 1 verse 1. in the
[1:30:43] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:30:45] with god
[1:30:46] and the word was god in other words in
[1:30:48] the beginning was the logos
[1:30:50] and the logos was with god and was god's
[1:30:53] visible image
[1:30:55] the logos is the holy spirit only
[1:30:57] visible
[1:30:58] this visible logos was moved by the
[1:31:01] invisible spirit hiding inside it
[1:31:03] proving the logos is not a second person
[1:31:06] but the image of god's
[1:31:08] one person this logos
[1:31:11] is personified as wisdom in proverbs 8
[1:31:14] verse 12
[1:31:15] and verses 22 through 31 listen to this
[1:31:18] loving description of the father and son
[1:31:21] the logos i dwell with prudence
[1:31:24] and find out knowledge of witty
[1:31:26] inventions the lord possessed me in the
[1:31:28] beginning of his way
[1:31:29] before his works of old i was set up
[1:31:31] from everlasting
[1:31:33] from the beginning or ever the earth was
[1:31:36] when there were no depths i was brought
[1:31:37] forth
[1:31:38] when there were no fountains abounding
[1:31:40] with water before the mountains were
[1:31:42] settled before the hills was i brought
[1:31:44] forth
[1:31:45] while as yet he had not made the earth
[1:31:47] nor the fields nor the highest part of
[1:31:49] the dust of the world
[1:31:50] when he prepared the heavens i was there
[1:31:53] when he set a compass upon the face of
[1:31:55] the depth
[1:31:56] when he established the clouds above
[1:31:58] when he strengthened the fountains of
[1:32:00] the deep
[1:32:01] when he gave to the sea his decree that
[1:32:03] the water should not pass his
[1:32:04] commandment
[1:32:05] when he appointed the foundations of the
[1:32:07] earth then
[1:32:08] i was by him as one brought up with him
[1:32:12] and i was daily his delight rejoicing
[1:32:14] always before him
[1:32:15] rejoicing in the habitable part of his
[1:32:18] earth
[1:32:19] and my delights were with the sons of
[1:32:21] men
[1:32:24] this is the glory of jesus's
[1:32:25] relationship with his father
[1:32:27] before the world was in john 17 verse 5.
[1:32:31] it's undeniable that eternal life is in
[1:32:33] the son
[1:32:34] jesus christ while jesus is not the
[1:32:37] eternal son
[1:32:38] he does have eternal life first john 5
[1:32:41] verses 11 and 12 mentions this fact
[1:32:44] twice saying
[1:32:46] god hath given to us eternal life and
[1:32:48] this life is in his son
[1:32:50] he that hath the son hath life and he
[1:32:52] that hath not the son of god hath not
[1:32:54] life
[1:32:55] the conclusion is that god's eternal
[1:32:57] life is in the sun
[1:32:59] because the invisible god created jesus
[1:33:01] body and forever dwells inside it
[1:33:07] the rewards for receiving the revelation
[1:33:09] of the godhead
[1:33:11] there are at least three rewards for
[1:33:12] receiving the revelation of the godhead
[1:33:15] the first is that you will know god
[1:33:16] intimately as he wants to be known
[1:33:18] enjoying true fellowship with the
[1:33:20] almighty monotheism
[1:33:22] is true intimate worship the ancient
[1:33:25] hebrews were strict monotheists
[1:33:27] so much so that jesus told the samaritan
[1:33:29] woman at the well that jews
[1:33:30] know what they worship jews were not
[1:33:33] guessing god was one person
[1:33:35] they knew god was one person it is only
[1:33:38] through monotheism that you can be a
[1:33:39] true intimate worshiper
[1:33:41] jesus says the father is currently
[1:33:43] seeking true worshipers
[1:33:45] worshiping god as three persons is false
[1:33:47] worship
[1:33:48] proven by the fact that many
[1:33:49] trinitarians sprinkle instead of fully
[1:33:52] immerse at baptism
[1:33:53] call upon god's titles rather than his
[1:33:56] one name
[1:33:57] and bless themselves with the sign of
[1:33:58] the cross and holy water
[1:34:01] as you worship god's one personality you
[1:34:03] are like abel bringing the correct
[1:34:05] acceptable sacrifice false worshipers
[1:34:08] bring sacrifices of their own choosing
[1:34:11] like cain when you worship god as one
[1:34:14] person the lord grants you true
[1:34:15] communion with himself
[1:34:17] you don't have to worry about communing
[1:34:18] equally with each person of the trinity
[1:34:21] you don't have to wonder why you feel
[1:34:22] like you know the father and son so well
[1:34:24] but feel distant from the holy spirit
[1:34:27] first john 1 verse 3 says truly our
[1:34:30] fellowship is with the father
[1:34:32] and with his son jesus christ when you
[1:34:35] believe on jesus christ
[1:34:36] receiving the son's work on calvary he
[1:34:38] reveals the father
[1:34:40] and the father is the holy spirit
[1:34:42] matthew 11 verse 27 declares
[1:34:45] all things are delivered unto me of my
[1:34:46] father and no man knoweth the son but
[1:34:49] the father
[1:34:50] neither knoweth any man the father save
[1:34:51] the son and he to whomsoever the son
[1:34:54] will reveal him
[1:34:56] an example of this blessed communion is
[1:34:58] in daily prayer
[1:34:59] because god's three manifestations are
[1:35:01] active
[1:35:02] the holy spirit anoints and leads
[1:35:04] christians to have access
[1:35:05] in prayer to the father invisible spirit
[1:35:09] through the son as ephesians 2 verse 18
[1:35:12] tells us we both have access by one
[1:35:15] spirit
[1:35:16] unto the father christians come boldly
[1:35:19] to speak to the father
[1:35:20] but it can be only done through the
[1:35:22] great high priest
[1:35:24] jesus the son of god jesus human body is
[1:35:27] the invisible father's
[1:35:29] heavenly representation the second
[1:35:32] reward for receiving the true revelation
[1:35:34] of the godhead
[1:35:35] is possessing god's overcoming power
[1:35:37] jesus promised this power to peter
[1:35:39] saying the gates of hell should not
[1:35:41] prevail against it
[1:35:42] it being the revelation that jesus was
[1:35:44] the christ
[1:35:46] was jesus's promise to peter true yes
[1:35:49] did hell's counsel prevail against peter
[1:35:52] no
[1:35:52] for even in peter's greatest failure
[1:35:54] publicly denying christ three times
[1:35:56] before jesus crucifixion
[1:35:59] jesus personally showed himself alive to
[1:36:01] peter before the rest of the apostles
[1:36:03] after his resurrection hell's counsels
[1:36:06] will not prevail against you
[1:36:07] even in the midst of your greatest
[1:36:08] failures because you have the same
[1:36:10] revelation about jesus
[1:36:12] as peter paul lists 17 sins that you'll
[1:36:16] overcome
[1:36:17] there could be more elsewhere in
[1:36:18] scripture by the spirit of god in first
[1:36:20] corinthians 6
[1:36:22] verses 9 and 10 and galatians 5 verses
[1:36:25] 19 through 21 idolatry
[1:36:28] effeminate child molestation abusers of
[1:36:32] themselves with mankind
[1:36:33] homosexuality covetousness
[1:36:36] drunkards revilers uncleanness
[1:36:40] lasheviousness witchcraft hatred
[1:36:43] variants emulation wrath
[1:36:46] strife seditions heresies and revelings
[1:36:51] knowing jesus christ in truth with true
[1:36:53] revelation
[1:36:54] gives you power to overcome every device
[1:36:56] of hell
[1:36:59] the third reward for receiving the
[1:37:00] godhead of revelation is the future
[1:37:02] reward of knowing
[1:37:03] jesus's new name which he will share
[1:37:05] with you
[1:37:06] god is pleased that during your life you
[1:37:08] have confessed the name of the lord
[1:37:09] jesus christ
[1:37:10] before family friends and associates
[1:37:13] like the church in philadelphia you have
[1:37:15] not denied jesus's holy name
[1:37:18] since you confess christ's name and life
[1:37:20] christ will confess your name before the
[1:37:22] father
[1:37:23] and then share his new name with you the
[1:37:25] overcomer
[1:37:26] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[1:37:28] in the temple of my god
[1:37:30] and he shall go no more out and i'll
[1:37:33] write upon him the name of my god
[1:37:35] and the name of the city of my god which
[1:37:38] is new jerusalem
[1:37:39] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[1:37:41] god and i'll write upon him
[1:37:43] my new name branham writes when all
[1:37:46] becomes new
[1:37:48] then he will take upon him a new name
[1:37:51] and that name will be the name of the
[1:37:53] bride also
[1:37:55] what that name is none dare conjecture
[1:37:58] it would have to be a revelation of the
[1:37:59] spirit given so conclusively
[1:38:01] that none would dare deny it but no
[1:38:04] doubt he will leave that revelation to
[1:38:05] the day when he desires to give that
[1:38:07] name
[1:38:08] forth suffice it to know that it will be
[1:38:11] more wonderful than we could ever
[1:38:14] imagine
[1:38:16] the consequences for rejecting the
[1:38:17] revelation of the godhead
[1:38:20] there are four possible consequences for
[1:38:22] rejecting the revelation of the godhead
[1:38:24] let me state that these consequences do
[1:38:26] not refer to all trinitarians
[1:38:28] but certainly most because jesus said
[1:38:30] few would find the narrow road of truth
[1:38:34] first many who reject god as one person
[1:38:36] and maintain he is three persons
[1:38:39] without literal bible evidence will be
[1:38:41] guilty of idolatry
[1:38:43] breaking the first commandment lying by
[1:38:45] adding to god's pure words
[1:38:47] and blaspheming god's name the first
[1:38:50] commandment says thou shalt have no
[1:38:51] other gods before me
[1:38:53] but it is also apparent in this verse
[1:38:55] that god wants no other gods with him
[1:38:58] isaiah records god saying six times
[1:39:00] there is no one else beside me
[1:39:03] and twice says he has no equal yet the
[1:39:06] trinity fabricates two other
[1:39:07] equal persons beside god the father just
[1:39:11] as ancient religions concocted a triad
[1:39:13] of divine persons
[1:39:15] the devil has succeeded in making
[1:39:17] idolaters out of the masses
[1:39:18] through their complete ignorance and
[1:39:20] rejection of scripture
[1:39:22] satan's trinity deception has made many
[1:39:24] trinitarians
[1:39:25] liars in god's sight for anyone who
[1:39:28] willingly adds to scripture will be
[1:39:29] called such
[1:39:30] as previously referenced in proverbs 30
[1:39:33] verses 5 and 6.
[1:39:35] the antichrist spirit is leading sinners
[1:39:37] to blaspheme god's name
[1:39:38] by substituting the title's father son
[1:39:40] and holy ghost
[1:39:42] in the place of the all-powerful name
[1:39:44] the lord jesus christ
[1:39:46] when jesus christ's name is denied when
[1:39:48] baptizing casting out devils and
[1:39:50] performing miracles
[1:39:51] satan has succeeded in blasphemy god's
[1:39:54] name
[1:39:56] a second long-term effect of rejecting
[1:39:58] the godhead of revelation
[1:39:59] is a slow spiritual death as taught in
[1:40:02] james 1 verse 15
[1:40:03] for sin when it is finished bringeth
[1:40:06] forth death
[1:40:07] in fact any false doctrine can have this
[1:40:09] effect as paul points out that the false
[1:40:11] doctrine that says the resurrection or
[1:40:13] rapture
[1:40:14] has already happened slowly overthrows
[1:40:17] the faith of some
[1:40:18] spreading like a canker over their
[1:40:20] spiritual lives
[1:40:22] a canker in the greek is gangrene the
[1:40:25] slow flesh and bone eating disease
[1:40:28] one false belief can cause a person to
[1:40:30] increase unto more ungodliness
[1:40:32] for accepting a second lie is easier
[1:40:35] than accepting the first
[1:40:36] jesus uses a similar illustration for
[1:40:38] false doctrine
[1:40:39] calling it leaven which also slowly
[1:40:42] spreads until all the dough is leavened
[1:40:44] if the false trinity doctrine is
[1:40:46] accepted in a church it's much easier
[1:40:48] for the rest of the church's teaching
[1:40:50] to become corrupted you can easily apply
[1:40:53] the gangrene or leaven effect to today's
[1:40:55] churches
[1:40:56] most church leaders allow their members
[1:40:57] to be lovers of pleasures more than
[1:40:59] lovers of god
[1:41:00] the following sins are more widely
[1:41:02] accepted than ever despite being
[1:41:04] plainly identified as evil in scripture
[1:41:07] adultery
[1:41:08] being married to someone other than your
[1:41:09] first spouse while your first spouse is
[1:41:11] still alive
[1:41:13] fornication having sexual relations
[1:41:15] before marriage
[1:41:16] homosexuality drunkenness cursing
[1:41:19] watching sinful movies listening to
[1:41:21] sinful music
[1:41:22] cross dressing in modest clothes women
[1:41:25] cutting their hair
[1:41:26] lying stealing and the like
[1:41:29] a third consequence is a greater
[1:41:31] likelihood of being given the status of
[1:41:33] a foolish christian
[1:41:34] rather than wise as taught by christ in
[1:41:37] matthew 25
[1:41:38] verses 1 through 12. chapters 6 and 8
[1:41:41] contain a lengthy teaching on wise and
[1:41:43] foolish virgins
[1:41:44] our lord says there are two kinds of
[1:41:46] christians wise and foolish
[1:41:48] it's possible for a foolish christian to
[1:41:50] be saved and go to heaven despite having
[1:41:52] made
[1:41:52] foolish decisions in his life in regards
[1:41:55] to the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:57] and in this case the godhead
[1:41:59] trinitarians can still be saved
[1:42:01] although it's foolish to add to the
[1:42:02] bible calling god three persons when he
[1:42:05] never reveals himself
[1:42:06] thus jesus told his own followers they
[1:42:09] were fools for not believing
[1:42:11] all that the prophets had spoken
[1:42:12] regarding his coming
[1:42:14] the same is true today because scholars
[1:42:16] and doctors of divinity
[1:42:17] will not believe god's prophets like
[1:42:19] isaiah who repeatedly declare that god
[1:42:22] is one and there is none beside him
[1:42:24] because the foolish virgins failed to
[1:42:26] get the oil or baptism of the holy ghost
[1:42:28] they could not be led by the spirit into
[1:42:30] all truth and thus
[1:42:32] continue to confess that god was three
[1:42:34] persons
[1:42:36] a fourth and final consequence is not
[1:42:38] knowing and ignorantly worshiping god
[1:42:41] on mars hill paul met athenians who were
[1:42:44] ignorantly worshiping an unknown god
[1:42:46] a friend once shared her frustration
[1:42:48] with feeling well acquainted with the
[1:42:50] father and son
[1:42:51] yet felt the holy spirit was a stranger
[1:42:54] sadly my friend had attended church for
[1:42:56] over 30 years
[1:42:57] and in the current holy spirit
[1:42:59] dispensation
[1:43:01] the old testament fatherhood and sonship
[1:43:03] dispensations have already passed
[1:43:06] admitted to not even knowing the holy
[1:43:08] spirit if my friend was sincerely yet
[1:43:11] ignorantly
[1:43:12] trying to worship the third person of
[1:43:13] the trinity after 30 years
[1:43:16] how likely is it that many other
[1:43:18] lifelong trinitarian church members
[1:43:20] feel like they do not know god or one of
[1:43:22] his persons
[1:43:24] furthermore do trinitarians always know
[1:43:26] to which person of the trinity they are
[1:43:28] praying
[1:43:29] like the pharisees many trinitarians
[1:43:30] today do not know jesus
[1:43:32] because god's word doesn't have a place
[1:43:34] in their hearts and minds
[1:43:36] trinitarians often reject the plain
[1:43:38] simple witness of scripture
[1:43:40] in order to add three persons to the
[1:43:42] bible
[1:43:45] conclusion although one mysterious
[1:43:47] element remains about the godhead
[1:43:49] god has revealed himself as one person
[1:43:51] who manifests himself in three ways
[1:43:53] to redeem mankind all dark shadowy
[1:43:56] confusion about god's number of persons
[1:43:59] scatters in the light of bible witnesses
[1:44:01] revealing
[1:44:02] one immortal invisible eternal person
[1:44:05] the lord jesus christ yes jesus christ
[1:44:08] is supreme deity
[1:44:09] jesus christ is god theologians scholars
[1:44:13] historians and preachers all admit
[1:44:15] that the doctrine of three persons is
[1:44:18] not implicitly taught in scripture
[1:44:20] and there are at least eight
[1:44:21] bible-backed reasons why the trinity
[1:44:23] doctrine is wrong
[1:44:25] indeed god never called himself three
[1:44:27] persons
[1:44:28] a three-person god automatically injects
[1:44:31] tritheism into christianity
[1:44:33] expressly seen through jesus supposedly
[1:44:36] having two fathers and being filled with
[1:44:37] two other
[1:44:38] co-equal persons what better way for
[1:44:41] satan to blaspheme god's name than to
[1:44:43] change it
[1:44:43] to titles father son and holy ghost and
[1:44:46] then convince
[1:44:47] billions of trinitarians to deny the
[1:44:49] power in the name of jesus christ
[1:44:52] ultimately accepting the trinity will
[1:44:54] likely lead to long-term spiritual
[1:44:55] sickness
[1:44:56] in churches who embrace it because any
[1:44:59] doctrinal lie
[1:45:00] spreads like gangrene or leaven
[1:45:03] accepting the revelation of the godhead
[1:45:05] brings intimacy with christ
[1:45:07] overcoming power against the gates of
[1:45:09] hell and a promise to share in jesus's
[1:45:12] new name
[1:45:12] in the new jerusalem with this
[1:45:14] life-giving prevailing godhead
[1:45:16] revelation
[1:45:17] you can now move on to the second
[1:45:19] mystery relating
[1:45:20] to god's blinding of his old testament
[1:45:23] people israel
[1:45:24] and understand why most cannot see jesus
[1:45:26] is the messiah
[1:45:29] action steps number one if you're a
[1:45:32] former trinitarian
[1:45:33] repent of purposely or ignorantly adding
[1:45:36] to god's
[1:45:36] known character rejoice in knowing god
[1:45:39] in truth
[1:45:40] as one divine person step two although
[1:45:44] the revelation of the godhead isn't
[1:45:45] required for salvation
[1:45:47] be ready to share god's true revelation
[1:45:49] with others by citing scripture alone
[1:45:51] while explaining the danger of adding
[1:45:52] three persons to god's character
[1:45:56] step three be aware to avoid lots of
[1:45:59] trinitarian references in songs
[1:46:02] for example holy holy holy statements of
[1:46:05] faith
[1:46:06] and wedding or baptismal blessings
[1:46:09] step 4 be careful when associating with
[1:46:12] trinitarians for the fact that one false
[1:46:14] doctrine
[1:46:15] often leads to many others
