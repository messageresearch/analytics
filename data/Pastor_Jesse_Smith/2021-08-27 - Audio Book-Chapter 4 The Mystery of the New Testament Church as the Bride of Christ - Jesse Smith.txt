TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 4 the mystery of the new testament church as the bride of christ chapter 4 includes footnotes numbers 462-552 this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church ephesians 5 verse 32 equipped with the knowledge that both jew and gentile compose the new testament church you will see the necessity for the next revelation of the one church as the bride of jesus christ here you grasp god's ordained position for his people as a she a feminine counterpart to his masculine role with the knowledge of our position comes the revelation of our responsibilities ministries and destiny recall the introduction chapters section on god's hide and seek romance drama your infinite loving lord has chosen you for his mate he has pre-planned your life's events so that you could come to love him accept his gift of salvation and willingly seek his leadership all the days of your life god loves romantic suspense and its fulfillment graciously setting believers as the apple of his eternal eye perhaps no simpler or significant words can be found to describe such unending love as paul says in ephesians 2 verse 4 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he hath loved us jesus daily pursues you with great love the confusion about the church as the bride of christ the confusion about the new testament church as jesus's bride centers on who she is which group of christians is the true church the evidence is not in what groups say but in the way they live the group's size name or historical accomplishments are not the determining factor in identifying it as christ's bride the character of the people is the determining factor rightly so it has been said that the beauty of a church is the character of its people a church's character is judged by how obedient the members are to jesus's commands indeed the groups that follow paul's apostolic pattern and teachings make up the one true bride the revelation of the mystery of the church as the bride of christ is the true church submits to all of jesus's commands now with the promises of ruling and reigning with her husband in the millennium this chapter shows christ as the husband and the church as the wife along with the attributes that define the true church she is set apart as the bride to christ identified by her complete submission to the apostolic blueprint given to paul by christ the fruits of all major christian groups will be examined by the bible blueprint and identified as either the bride or not you must test every group by its actions jesus says wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them and every tree is known by its fruit every tree or church group is known by its fruit you do not have to wonder if you are in the true church with christ's applied eye salve you can see plainly with jesus spirit of discernment you can prove all things and hold fast that which is good if you possess god's spirit inside you you won't believe every church instead you will try the spirits whether they are of god remember jesus promises his spirit will guide you into all truth as john 16 13 declares how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come biblical evidence for the revelation about the church as the bride of christ scripture declares jesus christ to be the husband or bridegroom in fact christ himself says he is the bridegroom in mark 2 verses 19 and 20. and jesus said unto them can the children of the bride chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days jesus also identifies himself as the bridegroom in three of his parables see chapter 8 the first is the king's son from matthew 22 verses 1 through 14. jesus places himself as the espoused son who awaits believers who will accept the father's invitation to his wedding and wear the appropriate wedding garments in the second parable the 10 virgins found in matthew 25 verses 1-13 jesus is likened to the bridegroom whose imminent coming catches five wise virgins fully prepared with oil and five foolish virgins unprepared the foolish miss his wedding due to their neglect thirdly the parable of the great supper in luke 14 verses 15-24 portrays christ as the host of a great supper which speaks of the marriage supper of the lamb from revelation 19 verse 9. messiah again connects himself with an upcoming marriage and his position as bridegroom jesus's forerunner john the baptist labels jesus as a husband john emphatically says jesus has a bride providing you with definitive proof that the one jew gentile church is to carry the bride title then john says jesus is the christ and his origin was in heaven in john 3 verses 28 through 31 ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but i must decrease he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth but he that cometh from heaven is above all yes it is logical that christ the husband must have a wife and the new testament church is emphatically identified as his bride the book of revelation mentions jesus bride twice most notable is revelation 22 17 in which the bride is speaking with the holy spirit inviting thirsty souls to come and drink of the water of life freely and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely this is the same invitation i am echoing to you in this book the second mention is john being invited by the angel to witness the holy city the new jerusalem descending from heaven upon the earth describing it as a beautifully adorned bride the city is not the bride but the home of the bride and heavenly bridegroom revelation 21 verses 2 and 3 reads and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god god search for a bride in israel then the world god's plan has always been to select a spiritual wife for himself the nation of israel was handpicked by god to be his peculiar treasure because of his love for abraham and his offspring deuteronomy 4 verse 37 and deuteronomy 7 verse 8 say god chose them because he loved their fathers and the nation of israel too ezekiel 16 records god's depiction of his loving effort to rescue israel and marry her the lord describes israel as a neglected baby in an open field laying in its own blood he saves her life and nurtures her until she's of marrying age god enters into a marriage covenant with israel she became his clothed and decked in beauty with worldwide renown sadly her pride caused her to become a harlot with every nation she became an idolater and aborted her own children to false gods israel forgot god's grace in rescuing her from her bloody polluted beginning israel would suffer for her sins but ultimately god would forgive her verse 60 says nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant israel is now suffering the consequences of her sins in the old testament as well as her rejection of her messiah jesus most jews are blinded to christ by their own unbelief when god cut or broke off the jewish branch he likened it unto a divorce from israel according to jeremiah 3 verse 8. and i saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister judith feared not but went and played the harlot also jeremiah chapter 3 contains the same story as ezekiel 16. verse 14 reads turn o backsliding children saith the lord for i am married unto you israel leaving her husband is taught in verse 20. surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband so have ye dealt treacherously with me o house of israel saith the lord yet again god's divine forgiveness is expressed in verse 22 return ye backsliding children and i will heal your backslidings behold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god the prophet hosea was used by god to portray himself as a faithful husband and israel as an adulterous wife god's prophet was told to marry the harlot gomer to show israel her marital unfaithfulness in hosea 3 the prophet buys back or redeems his estranged wife after her period of escapades hosea is confident gomer will now be faithful to him alone and god uses this relationship to affirm that israel will be faithful to him in the latter days this refers to the 144 000 jewish remnant who will accept jesus christ as messiah during the tribulation period this will lead to the fulfillment of isaiah 54 verse 5 during the millennium when jesus will be israel's husband and lord of the whole earth for thy maker is thine husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called isaiah calls israel married land in isaiah 62 verses 4 and 5. thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hefsiba and thy land bula for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee god is finally going to have a bride a beautiful jew gentile won and enjoy a joyful 1000 year honeymoon with her jesus was god's incarnation in his search for a faithful mate instead of israel accepting christ as their messiah they demanded his blood be shed and willingly accepted the guilt of his blood upon their race according to matthew 27 verse 25 then answered all the people and said his blood be upon us and on our children israel's rejection of jesus was a rejection of being called by his name god then turned to the gentiles to find a bride who wanted to be called by his name just like a natural man marries a wife and she takes his last name james recognizes god's search for a wife among the gentiles in acts 15 verse 14. simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name spiritually speaking god is now looking for a bride that will gladly accept his name and become mrs lord jesus christ just as a natural wife gets a new last name after the wedding christians get their new name after the rapture spiritual wedding marriage supper reception and millennium honeymoon jesus will write our new name upon us according to revelation 3 verse 12. him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i'll write upon him my new name the apostolic blueprint for becoming a bride member you become a bride member when you hear and receive a preacher's anointed message about jesus christ being your lord and savior in second corinthians 11 verse 2 paul tells the corinthians he espoused them or engaged them to jesus christ for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ this espousal was affirmed through paul's persuasive preaching ministry recorded in acts 18 verses 1 through 11. spent a year and a half teaching the word of god among them the apostle was like abraham's servant eliezer who was sent to get a bride for isaac eliezer shared the spousal terms with rebecca who eagerly accepted those who eagerly received paul's espousal terms which were given to him by christ immediately became jesus's espoused spiritually virgin bride i must add an important truth at this point bride members are spiritually married when they become christians but not physically married the physical union takes place at the rapture the meeting in the air as paul taught in first thessalonians 4 verses 16-17 the engagement starts when you are saved but the marriage ceremony is with christ in the air at the rapture there is also a presentation of christ's bride after the rapture sometime near the marriage supper the lamb recall paul said he would present the corinthians to christ as a chaste virgin some misunderstand paul's teaching in romans 7 verse 4 which says wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god yes you are spiritually married to christ by the vow in your heart but you are not physically with your husband his spirit is inside you like an engagement vow lives in your heart but his nail-scarred body is not with you like rebecca traveling upon her camel to meet isaac you are on your earthly journey to meet your husband but the wedding is yet in the future the baptism of the holy ghost is your power or camel carrying you to meet your bridegroom just water the camel and you'll make it water the holy spirit with praise and worship and you'll meet jesus in the air once rebecca saw isaac face to face she never left him when you finally see jesus face to face you'll ever be with the lord first corinthians 13 verse 12 reads for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known you are officially married to jesus when you have a body like his paul writes this in philippians 3 verses 20 and 21 for our conversation is in heaven for whence also we look for the savior the lord jesus christ who shall change our body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself first john 3 verse 2 also promises beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is apply paul's corinthian blueprint to the day of pentecost when three thousand souls were espoused to christ through peter's sermon observe acts 2 verses 41 through 47 and see how faithfully the bride assembled hungry for true teaching and worship and enthusiastic to help each other with physical needs then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily as should be saved every new bride member became a new creature in christ jesus each left their previous sinful way of life whether it was the curse of trying to save oneself through moses's law or a licentious lustful lifestyle jesus charged paul to direct sinners out of the darkness and into the light of being a forgiven bride member in acts 26 18 to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me paul knew this same dramatic joy of coming to christ he compared his previous life to dung while affirming the excellency of being a bride member in philippians 3 verse 8. yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things but do count them but dung that i may win christ paul once a violent blasphemer taught his miraculous salvation experience was a pattern to all future bride members in 1st timothy 1 verses 13 through 16 who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief how be it for this cause i obtain mercy that in me first jesus christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting the apostle paul embarked on three missionary trips to espouse more bride members to christ and repeatedly operated according to his blueprint first he would win new converts then he would spend significant time teaching them christ's word finally before leaving he would ordain faithful men as elders and leaders to oversee the converts the blueprint is most clearly seen on his first missionary journey in acts 14 verses 21-23 and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and iconium and antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed paul's letters record his instructions to preachers titus and timothy to keep the same blueprint for all christian churches both men learned paul's requirements for pastors also called elders or bishops and deacons in titus 1 verses 6 through 9 and 1st timothy 3 verses 1 through 13. the apostle told titus to set the churches in order by ordaining elders in every city for this cause left i thee in crete that thou should ascend order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as i had appointed thee timothy was instructed to pass down god's revelations to faithful men in 2 timothy 2 verses 1 and 2. thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also these scriptures give you god's blueprint for how people become bride members through genuine missionary work how their churches grow and how to make more bride members the unchanging gospel blueprint it's imperative to show paul's indictment upon anyone who would change even one word of the revelations jesus taught him curses were to come upon anyone who changed jesus's blueprint or pattern for saving teaching and harvesting future bride members according to galatians 1 verses 6 through 12 i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be accursed for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet please men i should not be the servant of christ but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ every word paul was given by christ to write and share with the churches must be obeyed paul was faithful in teaching the whole council of god to every church he started or visited first corinthians 4 verse 17 says for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach everywhere in every church every bride church heard the same complete gospel from paul paul told the ephesians in acts 20 verse 27 that they heard the full counsel of god and thereby were responsible for it for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god bride members will not change one word of jesus's revelation given to paul they know there is only one faith according to ephesians 4 verse 5 and jude 3 says it is the one and only faith we must earnestly contend for timothy received a direct charge from paul to keep every word of god in first timothy 6 verses 13 and 14. i give thee charge in the sight of god who quickeneth all things and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukable unto the appearing of our lord jesus christ paul wept while writing the philippians from prison due to the enemies of the cross who live contrary to his example and teachings in philippians 3 verses 17-19 brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an end sample for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things paul rebuked false teachers by saying their false doctrines spread like gangrene destroying the faith of potential bride members in second timothy 2 verses 16 through 18 but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenus and felidus who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some jesus solomon and john support paul's insistence for believing all of god's word without adding or taking anything away christ says god's word will never pass away in matthew 24 35 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away solomon teaches god will call men and women liars who add to or delete from his commands in proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 every word of god is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar john warns those who would add or delete from the bible urging strict adherents to all god's words in revelation 22 verses 18 and 19 for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book let god's word be your absolute your final word your unlimited source of strength let god be true and any word of man contrary to it a lie romans 3 verse 4 declares god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and might overcome when thou art judged the bride submissive character to every word of christ in ephesians 5 verses 22 through 33 paul uses the husband and wife imagery to express five attributes christ desires in his bride a woman is often used in scripture to represent a church or even a nation ezekiel 16 verse 7 shows god calling israel a woman and acts 7 38 says moses was part of the church in the wilderness as proven earlier by numerous scriptures jesus church is also called a bride paul's purpose for this ephesians text is found in verse 32. this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church here you find the revelation of the true bride's christian character the first attribute is christ is the one and only head of the church as ephesians 5 verse 23 says for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body john 1 verse 1 says jesus is the word meaning the true revelation of the bible bride members declared jesus spirit which wrote his word the bible is their only headship sadly most churches are headed up by man-made creeds bylaws and traditions that contradict the revelation jesus gave to paul the word doesn't rule them the conditions today match those of jesus day as the pharisees had exalted their man-made interpretations above moses's law one example is jesus rebuking them harshly for mistreating their elderly parents making the tradition of not supporting their parents their headship instead of moses's teaching but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition this people draw thy unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men many examples can be given to show how churches reject jesus's headship for both ministers and lay members but here are just 10 of the most sinful teachings churches promote homosexual relationships yet paul's revelation condemns these as abominable romans 1 verses 26 through 32 first corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11 1st timothy 1 verses 10 and 11 adulterous relationships couples married more than once yet paul's revelation demands marriage last until death and warns that adulterers will not inherit god's kingdom romans 7 verses 1 through 3 first corinthians 6 verses 9 and 10 murdering babies through abortion and birth control pills yet paul's revelation says murders will not inherit god's kingdom according to galatians 5 verse 21 women preachers yet paul's revelation forbids any woman from teaching a man first corinthians 14 verses 34 through 36 first timothy 2 verses 11 through 15. substance abuse smoking cigarettes drunkenness etc yet paul's revelation says these acts defile the body the temple of the holy ghost and should not be done as long as the world stands romans 14 verse 21 first corinthians 3 verse 17 chapter 6 verses 19 and 20 and chapter 8 verse 13. viewing sinful movies and television shows yet paul's revelation was to avoid all appearance of evil first thessalonians 5 verse 22 shameful hair lengths women cutting their hair and men growing long hair yet paul says women should never cut their hair and men should keep theirs short first corinthians 11 verses 1-16 false conversions saying converts are filled with the spirit and initial confession or working miracles is proof of salvation yet paul's revelation is that you must continue believing and you will receive the holy ghost sometime after you initially believe matthew 7 verse 21 through 23 acts 19 verses 1 through 7 galatians 4 verse 19 ephesians 1 verse 13. in modest clothing sexy revealing outfits yet paul commands modest clothing in 1st timothy 2 verse 9. surely you can see jesus christ and his word are not the head of most churches concerning these ten teachings they are completely one-sided and have no examples of god allowing them you'll never find homosexual relationships celebrated in god's eternal word nor will you find a godly woman preaching or cutting her hair may you follow the spirits leading to assemble with bride members who give jesus his rightful place as head of the church who do you know that loves jesus so much they obey god's word in all 10 of these areas a second bright attribute is complete submission in everything verse 24 says the church is subject to christ in everything bride members are happy to read the bible with a desire to know more of god's will so that they might obey it their goal is to live like jesus who knew man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god obeying her husband is not a grievous task for the bride because she is born again as first john 5 verses 3 and 4 teach for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith the bride's goal is total submission to her husband in all things she wants to be holy because jesus is holy as peter declares as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for i am holy a third bright attribute is submission to christ's washing process ephesians 5 verse 26 reads that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word jesus cleanses your life as you hear his word and obey it first peter 1 verse 22 says you are purified in obeying the truth through the spirit acts 22 16 says paul's sins were washed away at his repentance and water baptism we know water itself cannot forgive sins but rather paul's obedience caused god to forgive him overcoming sin in the midst of persecution and temptation is the washing process the bride goes through according to revelation 1 verse 5 and 7 verse 14 jesus washes his bride by anointing preachers to share his word which cleanses the hearers first corinthians 1 verse 18 declares preaching is the power of god unto salvation jesus's five preaching gifts apostle prophet pastor teacher and evangelist perfect edify and unify his bride the reason most churches do not get washed is because they do not preach and obey all of paul's revelation as shown by the 10 bulleted examples above upon obeying jesus's commands your mind is renewed or washed paul validates this in ephesians 4 verses 22 through 32 and titus 3 verses 3 through 8. verse 5 and titus 3 says christians are saved by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost as christ's bride you must be constantly washed and prepared for your wedding day your great day of presentation to your husband the word being joined or glued to in the greek lexicon to christ is the bride's fourth attribute according to ephesians 5 verse 31 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh jesus's true bride is glued to his fellowship and that of his people christians are to constantly meditate upon the lord speaking to him in unceasing prayer the bride will also gather with other believers and their physical gathering will increase as jesus's second coming nears hebrews 10 verses 24 and 25 explains and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching you cannot separate the bride from her husband nor from her spiritual family many church members are glued to their sinful television shows movies and sports too busy to fellowship with christ and his church the fifth bride attribute is the attitude of reverence as ephesians 5 verse 33 commands nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband reverence means to be in awe of in the greek just speaking your husband's name is a sacred hollowed thing to the bride her husband is great in her eyes causing her to be meek and humble she is careful which words come out of her mouth possessing quiet strength bride members own the treasure of a meek and quiet spirit just as natural wives should but let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price paul closes ephesians 5 by reminding men to love their wives so i will close this section by reminding you of jesus's love for you paul says god has great love for you and he also lists 17 things that cannot separate us from christ's love in romans 8 verses 35 through 39 jesus's commands for his bride are for her good her safety protection provision and growth romans 8 verse 28 says all things not some work together for good to them that love the lord this is forever christ's purpose for his commands our good god told the same to moses in deuteronomy 6 verses 24 and 25 and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the lord our god for our good always that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments before the lord our god as he hath commanded us your husband's commands will always work for your benefit your obedience to jesus is the greatest expression of your love for him for he delights in obedience more than sacrifice jesus pleads if ye love me keep my commands keep the true bride's attributes in mind because chapter 9 unveils the sinful attributes of the false bride the mother harlot judging christian groups and denominations by their fruits based upon paul's bride attributes the holy spirit helps us judge christian groups by their fruits you can know a person's purity by their actions you might use the word discern instead of judge but they mean the same thing it is necessary for you to prove all things and test every spirit jesus specifically warns us of men false prophets matthew 24 verse 4 states and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you please understand the following judgments upon church groups are not eternal judgments as only god judges eternal destinations i am only judging each church's adherence to paul's revelation from jesus christ as well as the rest of the holy bible with the internet it's easier than ever to judge churches through their online statements of faith jesus instructs us to judge individuals and situations with righteous judgment in john 7 24 judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment paul's prayer for the philippians is for them to approve holy things as they grew in judgment in philippians 1 verses 9 and 10. and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of christ the hebrews writer states mature christians skillfully discern or judge between good and evil baby christians refuse to judge right and wrong for when for the time you ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil in 2010 the pew research center estimated the following sizes for christian groups that combined for about 2.5 billion members worldwide as you read through this list consider which group keeps all 10 doctrines listed earlier along with the rest of god's commands roman catholic 1.3 billion protestant 900 million eastern orthodox 270 million anglican 110 million oriental orthodox 62 million all others 37 million if you are thinking none of these named groups keep all 10 doctrines you are right they are guilty of either adding to god's word or taking away from it it is with love and compassion that i claim all these churches are guilty of transgressing jesus commands jesus says we must do his commands if he truly is our lord in luke 6 46 and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say friend this is a serious subject before we examine these denominational groups remember the bride church will not have creeds bylaws or traditions that contradict paul's revelation for they are cursed if they do in addition to the ten doctrines already listed the following further illustrate how the bride church keeps all of god's commands as a woman separate from all church systems water baptisms are performed as full immersions in water calling upon the name of the lord jesus christ not by sprinkling and not by speaking the titles father son and holy spirit acts 2 verse 38 acts 8 16 acts 10 48 acts 19 verse 5 and acts 22 16. believers are taught to receive the baptism of the holy ghost in their souls the third work of grace after justification and sanctification matthew 11 29 mark 4 verses 26 through 28 john 17 verse 17 john 20 verse 22 acts chapter 1 verse 5 and acts chapter 19 verses 1-7 god is known as one person not three persons job 13 verse 8 thus the trinity dogma is wrong god says he is the only god and there is no one beside him in isaiah 43 verse 11 and isaiah 44 verses 6 through 8 jesus is the image of the invisible god the express image of his person colossians 1 15 hebrews 1 verse 3. men and women wear separate garments because cross-dressing transgender movement is an abomination to god deuteronomy 22 verse 5. this means men only will wear pants women will abstain from wearing men's garments pants even if they are women's pants and wear modest skirts and dresses supernatural power currently operates all nine gifts of the holy ghost mark 16 verses 16-18 first corinthians 12 verses 1 through 11. beginning with roman catholics chapter 9 explores the depths of their wicked doctrines they confess god is three separate co-equal persons which is polytheism they consider their communion wafer to be the literal body of the crucified jesus which is idolatrous fantasy mary is exalted higher than christ for she is called the mother of god women cut their hair and wear men's clothing with just these few examples roman catholics cannot be the bride most protestants confess a three-person god and permit adulterous marriages cross-dressing women wearing pants and women cutting their hair excluding them from being bride going further most baptists claim you are filled with the holy ghost at repentance denying the baptism of the holy ghost and allow women preachers their loud cheering at sporting events is louder than their praises in church manifesting their idolatry they are not the bride lutherans often allow members to drink alcohol heavily permit adulterous remarriages and have no modesty standards they cannot be the bride seventh-day adventists make sabbath keeping the evidence for being born again which is just as erroneous as pentecostals teaching speaking in tongues is the evidence you cannot emphasize the gift tongues more than the giver the holy spirit those groups cannot be the bride jehovah's witnesses deny supernatural healings they cannot be the bride mormons teacher born again after baptism allow women to cut their hair and add an entire testament to the bible the book of mormon which carries severe punishments on judgment day mormons are not christ's bride similar discernments for each church group could be made in order to prove who is bride and who isn't eastern orthodoxy erroneously exalts tradition to be equal with scripture celebrates the eucharist intercedes for the dead and venerates icons despite being orthodox by name this group is not jesus's bride nor are anglicans and oriental orthodox anglicans recite three powerless creeds the apostles creed nicean creed and athanasian creed and declare christ's real presence is in the eucharist oriental orthodox deny jesus's dual nature human and divine and require sacraments for salvation these few examples prove we are living in the time of the great falling away or the apostasy most churches have fallen away from paul's teachings but remember jesus will have a bride church and she will allow him to wash her with the waters of his word week in and week out preaching service after preaching service not for a moment do i say there are no saved believers in these groups listed above as god has children in every organization god doesn't accept organizations only sincere individuals within them but the saved in these organizations cannot be born again holy ghost-filled bride members if they are part of any church that rejects even a portion of god's word this is true because god searches the world for genuine worshipers who fear him through worshiping him in the spirit and truth bride members may start their christian journey in the false churches but then the lord calls them out of false church systems saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues one major purpose of being born again is for jesus to lead you into all truth so staying in a church that allows sin is against jesus's nature he sends his spirit with the intent to separate his bride from those who love pleasures more than god jesus says there are three kinds of christians workers of iniquity imposters foolish and wise chapters 8 and 12 focus on this subject but for now you must know that workers of iniquity have gifts to perform miracles under the true anointing of the spirit but their souls are void of god's anointing these impostors enjoy working in god's spirit for financial and selfish gain therefore they are lost foolish virgins will be saved at the white throne judgment but will miss the rapture marriage supper the lamb and millennium because they fail to prepare oil for the tearing bridegroom this means foolish christians today fail to receive the baptism of the holy ghost by foolishly choosing to invest their time and energy into worldly cares they are virgin in that they had no obvious interaction with idolatry lusts addictions and the like but like israel stopping at kadesh barnea for fear of the giants they failed to possess all of god's promises for fear of losing out on worldly opportunities they could have had all the truth but failed to ask for it jesus promised to give the holy ghost to them that asked in luke 11 13. who is the bride and where is she located sincere hearts want to know who the true bride is and where she is located truly the climatic book of the bible revelation holds this subject at its very core john's work is a dramatic unveiling of jesus his true bride and the false bride revelation chapter 1 reveals jesus christ the bridegroom in his sevenfold glory of supreme deity revelation chapters 2 and 3 reveal the bride's overcoming character and chapter 7 of this book is devoted to explaining this subject the false bride the mother harlot church is exposed in revelation chapter 17 and 18 as the imposter church who loves abominations and self-indulgent living more than god's word chapter 9 of this book covers the mother's attributes but also the daughter churches who hold their mother's beliefs the true bride's eternal home then descends to earth in revelation chapters 21 and 22 with the holy spirit's discernment you are able to distinguish the imposter church from the true bride church begin by using the 15 doctrinal examples listed above the word is your standard forever settled in heaven never to pass away and will judge the secrets of every heart at jesus's white throne yes jesus's true bride believes god is one person just like the apostles believed she has the supernatural power of the holy ghost working in her midst through the spirit's nine gifts new converts are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and continue on into sanctification to receive the baptism of the holy ghost sometime afterwards the bride is pentecostal by experience but not by organization her members believe in holiness and dress modestly with separate garments for both genders her women have uncut hair and men short hair as paul commanded bride members marry between men and women only and their marriages last until death they live holy lives abstaining from cigarettes social drinking and all other substance abuse i believe i'm part of this bible-based bride which is the reason i've written this book i believe every word in the bible just as it is written paul's teachings are the unchanging eternal truth of god for us to believe and live by so where is the bride her members are gathered in small churches worldwide as jesus's rapture description says some will be sleeping when the rapture happens while others will be working in the field or grinding at the mill she is part of the pew research center's all others group but separate from most of those due to her love for truth she could take the names holy ghost-filled church wise virgin church or bible-believing church but she has no official name her heavenly name is the lord jesus christ along with the family of god this is the reason she baptizes her new converts in the literal name of the lord jesus christ her members are both jew and gentile this bride group will be spirit organized through her heavenly headquarters following paul's apostolic pattern she has no earthly headquarters to enact man-made control over her members instead she is organized and unified exactly as paul organized the early church through the power of the holy spirit jesus's bride foreshadowed in eight old testament women not only did god foretell his taking a gentile wife through an old testament prophet he also used the following women's lives to type or foreshadow the bride church and her past and future events sarah rebecca aznath rahab samson's bride from timnath ruth esther and solomon's wife the shulamite a type foretells someone or some event to come in the future sarah the wife of abraham bearing isaac at 90 years old types the rapture of the jew gentile church galatians 3 verse 7 says anyone with faith in christ is a child of abraham isaac's birth foretells jesus second coming to earth because both are promised sons and isaac's birth happened about the same time as sodom's destruction jesus promised his second coming would occur at a time when the world was again in sodomite conditions according to luke 17 verses 28 through 30. since sarah's womb was dead and it was impossible for her to conceive before isaac's birth god had to transform her body with new life her body changed foreshadowed the body change christians will experience at the rapture behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we should be changed without god it is impossible for our bodies to change and meet christ in the air but with god all things are possible sarah even doubted god's promise to bring seed through her womb but god fulfilled his promise to abraham about his promised seed so will god keep his promise to christians despite their occasional doubts and fulfill first thessalonians 4 verses 15 through 18. rebecca's espousal and marriage to isaac in genesis 24 types the bride's spiritual espousal and heavenly marriage to christ the bridegroom eleazar abraham's chief servant is guided by god to find a suitable wife for isaac chapter 13 shows god's current choice for a human servant to espouse a bride church for his son jesus once rebecca is found and accepts the marriage proposal eleazar bestows upon her gifts of valuable jewelry these gifts type the nine gifts of the holy ghost given to jesus's bride as love tokens which the true bride will possess and operate for his glory eleazar endeavors to quickly return her to isaac and rebecca agrees the servant rebecca and her maidens make the long journey by camel to abraham's country the power of the camels symbolizes the power of the holy ghost that makes the church's long earthly journey possible just as the camels needed watered and fed our souls need a constant feeding of god's word during our lives when isaac comes into view he is outside his tent meditating in the field rebecca then meets him in the field typing our meeting the lord in the air at the rapture we won't meet jesus in his tent or heavenly house but in between in the air as an ath the egyptian wife of joseph types the new testament church composed of both jew and gentile her status as a gentile marrying a jew joseph types paul espousing gentile believers in a spiritual marriage with christ if you're a gentile you are the anti-type of azenath joseph's life before marrying azaneth clearly types jesus's earthly ministry joseph and jesus were both rejected by their brethren and sold for 20 and 30 pieces of silver respectively joseph's time in prison in which one inmate was killed and the other spared typed jesus on the cross the unrepentant thief soul was lost but the other thief was saved as jesus promised him paradise joseph's exaltation to second in command to pharaoh typed jesus's resurrection and placement at the right hand of the majesty on high once in his ruling position joseph married aznath likewise after jesus sat down on his heavenly throne he began to call and espouse a gentile wife to himself joseph revealing his identity to his brethren types the event of jesus revealing himself to the faithful 144 thousand jewish remnant after the rapture joseph's 11 brothers were blinded to his true identity just as israel is currently blinded to recognizing jesus as messiah this revelation came after joseph put out everyone from his presence meaning aznath was in her royal quarters not present as he revealed himself this type means jesus's true bride will be in her heavenly royal quarters as jesus descends to mount zion to reveal himself to the jews the rescue of rahab the gentile harlot from jericho's destruction types the rapture event from first thessalonians 4 verses 15-18 her gentile lineage speaks of god rescuing the gentile people in the times of the gentiles just as rahab was saved by israel's trumpet and shout in joshua 6 5 the jew gentile bride is raptured by christ's shout voice and trump of god the book of joshua shows rahab being spared from her city's destruction because in faith she received and protected israel's two spies her record signified her faith in israel's god typing the token or seal of the holy ghost baptism believers must have on display in order to go in the rapture chapters 6 8 and 12 in this book detailed jesus's two symbols for the holy ghost baptism oil and a wedding garment only rahab and those within her house were spared from death when jericho's walls fell foreshadowing the certain death for all who missed the rapture in the awful time that follows the tribulation after being rescued this once ill-famed sexually immoral woman became a faithful godly wife and mother in so much god placed her in david's lineage which produced the christ child rahab's rags to riches testimony speaks of gentile christians being dead in sins and trespasses before christ's spirit quickens and raises them to sit in the honorable state of heavenly places in christ jesus samson's philistine wife from timnath types jesus's gentile bride samson's parents were at first shocked that samson didn't take a jewish wife but judges 14 verse 4 says it was part of god's plan for samson to take a wife from among the philistines that he might destroy them and deliver israel the holy spirit revealed this revelation to my brother cameron who is also a pastor and then shared it with me god's purpose is to take a gentile bride in mercy not judgment but god must pour out his wrath upon most gentiles during the tribulation because they have rejected his spirit judges 14 3 says samson chose his wife because she pleased him jesus's bride church pleases him as well as she walks in the spirit and not the flesh this dedicated walk proves she has the spirit of christ and belongs to him paul taught believers how to please god through his commandments and sacrificing for others before marrying her the spirit of the lord comes upon samson and he slays a young lion who roared against him after a short meeting with his espoused bride samson finds bees and honey in the lion's carcass which he eats and shares with his parents without telling them where he got it the slain line represents god delivering jesus the line of the tribe of judah to be slain before the gentile marriage acts 2 verse 23 says jesus was delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god to be crucified and slain unsearchable riches spiritual treasures and delicious revelations are gained from jesus's death peter says god's word has a gracious taste john was commanded to eat the open book formerly sealed with seven seals and testified it tasted like honey in revelation 10 verse 10. finally samson hosted a seven-day wedding feast to celebrate his new bride proudly he put forth a riddle to challenge 30 philistine men promising them new clothing if they could solve it in judges 14 14 you find the riddle out of the eater came forth meat and out of the straw came forth sweetness the men were confounded for six days so on the seventh day they secretly threatened to burn the bride's father's house if she didn't get the answer from samson for them in tears the bride gains the answer from samson and shares it with the men samson realizes what has happened but still pays them the garments he promised soon after samson goes to ashkelon and slays the men taking back his garments this strange amazing story is fulfilled in the times of the gentiles from 53 a.d to the present day the seven day feast symbolizes the seven church ages see chapter seven samson's riddle represents the mystery of god spoken of in revelation 10 verse 7 that can only be revealed on the seventh and final day or 7th and last church age the laodicean church age john was told to take the open book or revealed bible truths that denominations had lost for centuries eat and prophesy them again around the world it's my humble opinion that the book you are reading contains the answer to samson's riddle or the revelation of god's holy bible and it could only be revealed in the last day just as samson's wife was the only one who had the answer to his riddle only christ's bride has the revelation of the previously seven sealed book or bible the timnath bride had to lay before samson and seek his love in order to get the revelation today's bride church stays in god's presence like mary the sister of lazarus and receives the sweet tasting bible revelations you can only find these rich sweet bible revelations being preached by jesus's bride for out of the eater jesus came forth meat and sweetness jesus's strong meat is spiritual discernment to judge between good and evil jesus's honey-like sweetness is his revealed unveiled open bible you are tasting it now and i hope you can agree with its sweetness like david did in psalm 119 verse 103 how sweet are thy words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey to my mouth samson destroying the thirty men for threatening his bride is fulfilled during the tribulation when heaven's wrath is poured out upon all those who persecuted christ's bride revelation 18 verse 20 and verse 24 captures jesus's revenge upon the false church her daughter churches and sinners rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets for god hath avenged you on her and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth ruth the gentile moabitus types the gentile church's marriage to jesus ruth's childless state as a widow represents the church's fruitless life before coming to christ and her first hopeless marriage to the law her marriage to boaz symbolizes the bride church's marriage to jesus according to romans 7 verse 4. wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god thus the death of ruth's husband represents her being loosed from the curse of the law before marrying boaz ruth's choosing to travel back to israel with her elderly mother-in-law naomi types gentile christians leaving their sinful lives and following the old paths of serving god in love naomi types the old strict teaching of judaism for it was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ naomi led ruth back to israel and ultimately to boaz a type of christ the timing of naomi and ruth's return to israel is perfect because it also types gentile salvation through the cross of jesus christ the women arrived in time for the barley harvest chapter 3 shows how the barley harvest occurred in the third month at the time of the feasts of passover unleavened bread and first fruits roots arrival of barley harvest represents gentile christians coming to faith in christ by experiencing the spiritual blessings of his death passover burial unleavened bread and resurrection first fruits recall paul said christians continually benefit from the spiritual feasts of the passover unleavened bread first fruits and even pentecost because the filling of the holy ghost the bride church like ruth came to christ in a timely manner she'll enjoy all the blessings of passover and the final harvest of pentecost the rapture in ruth's remaining story boaz redeems naomi in order to purchase and marry ruth in ruth 4 verses 9 and 10. this types jesus shedding his blood on the cross in order to purchase both jew naomi and gentile ruth acts 20 verse 28 says jesus purchased us with his own blood after their marriage ruth bears a son named obed and lets naomi nurse her son her seed this types the seed life of the gentile church the holy spirit returning to the once blinded jews after the rapture or wedding of the bride church all the israeli women rejoice for naomi who now has a kinsmen nourishment and restored life through boaz and ruth the 144 thousand jewish remnant enjoy the same a kinsmen redeemer in christ spiritual nourishment through the new testament truths and restored spiritual life through the seal of the holy ghost in their foreheads esther the jewish queen of the persian kings xerxes during 6th century bc types the new testament bride church xerxes previous queen vashti whom he put away types israel being put away or blinded as god put israel away via a bill of divorcement in isaiah 50 verse 1 and jeremiah 3 verse 8. having put israel away christ could find a people for his namesake to be his new bride mordecai esther's cousin urges her to enter the contest to become xerxes new wife mordecai the elder staunch jew again types the holy law of moses as a school master to point us to jesus christ required to be a virgin to mary the king esther's virginity types complete devotion to christ with no worldly intercourse amazingly not one evil word is recorded about esther's character second corinthians 11 verse 2 says for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ esther wins xerxes beauty contest by adorning herself according to haggy eyes requirements and nothing more haggai the king's chamberlain and keeper of the women types the holy spirit's sanctification work or second work of grace which needs nothing extraneous added to it esther lived by every word that proceeded from haggai as the bride church lives by every word of god in preparation for her marriage to jesus esther's wedding night types the christian's born-again experience as the new birth is likened in under receiving seed in 1st peter 1 verse 23 although esther was jewish her israeli identity was at first unknown to the king and all shushan in other words everyone considered her a virgin gentile esther never even lived a day in jerusalem these facts about esther type today's spiritually virgin bride church composed of jew and gentile but inwardly she's a spiritual jew meaning her heart has been circumcised by the holy ghost she is born again romans 2 verse 29 reads but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god haman's plot to kill all jews including mordecai and esther types the very end of the times of the gentiles this is when the beasts out of the earth in revelation 13 verses 11 through 18 plots to kill all both small and great rich and poor free and bond who do not take his antichrist mark his deceitful theme will be a promise of peace and safety while outlawing true christianity and instituting unionized religion just as haman's plot was foiled by esther's prayerful humble intercession so will the beast plot be foiled by the bride church's prayers esther and the jews fasted for three days before the queen put on her royal apparel and stood before the king though it could have cost her her life esther was willing to die to save her people and knew she was ordained queen for such a time as this esther's approach to xerxes types the bride prayerfully approaching christ clothed in the holy spirit's anointing in her spiritual roles as king and priest unto god esther had access to the highest authority as christians have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand just as esther felt political pressure there is coming a time of political pressure or squeezing time upon the bride church at some point in the future false churches will unite with political leaders to change laws requiring all churches to join an evil ecumenical union bride churches will feel the pressure of the movement but will be kept from actually having to decide upon the mark of the beast as jesus promised in revelation 3 verse 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth in the political squeeze the true church will do what esther did hold two wine banquets for the king wine represents the joy and boldness god's spirit brings to the believer as taught in psalms 16 verse 11 acts 2 verses 4 through 21 and acts 4 verse 31 instead of choosing fear in her time of trouble the bride will honor her king with praise joy and bold rejoicing to magnify his name dual wine banquets also speak of the former and latter reigns from joel 2 verse see chapter 3 note also how isaiah likens the rapture validated by paul in first corinthians 15 verses 51-54 unto a wine feast in isaiah 25 verses 6 through 8 and in this mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the leaves of fat things full of marrow of wines on the leaves well refined and he will destroy in this mount in the face of the covering cast over all people and the veil that is spread over all nations he will swallow up death and victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it observe esther sitting at a table with her husband and her greatest enemy haman like david wrote in psalm 23 verse 5 esther was at a table in the presence of her enemies but god's anointing upon her led her to victory and deliverance thou prepared us a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over though political pressure may come to the bride's table or churches even shutting her doors the latter rain anointing will ensure her deliverance david knew his victory came not by his own power but by god's anointing today's bride church knows the same it was on the day of the second wine banquet when esther finally revealed her petition to her husband the king who saved her from her accuser haman esther never had to suffer through the hour of death haman planned because xerxes did away with him so will the bride church be saved from living in the tribulation when the mark of the beast will be laid down christ will remove his church from the earth before the tribulation esther's story ends with mordecai's ascension to increase power and authority in the king's house the jews esther's people were given permission to defend themselves against haman's death sentence and they fought and defeated all their foes causing the creation of the celebratory feast of purim complete jewish victory in shushan types the complete victory of the 144 thousand jewish believers during the tribulation though the antichrist in every nation will come against her jesus will physically come to protect and save his covenant people whose names are on the book of life the shulamite solomon's love interest in the book of song of solomon types the bride of christ because she is his only love throughout the entire book and she is never divorced or put away as israel was she is his one and only his lily among thorns the fairest among women the shulamite was likely a jew as easton's bible dictionary says shulamite means from shunan which is a little village in the tribe of issachar song of solomon 3 verses 9-11 names solomon proving he is indeed both the shulamites lover and king chapters one through three trace their romance from its beginning to the end of their engagement the shulami asked to be drawn into fellowship by her lover despite her black sunburnt skin she is a jewish vineyard laborer and not of royal ascent as royalty do not work in the hot sun right away she connects her skin color with the gentile clan of kidar ishmaelites giving evidence she's a type of the new testament church composed of jew and gentile the shulamite loves him in her soul the center of her existence god's holy spirit reaches to the depths of the bride's soul purifying it as the seal upon her soul the couple dream of their wedding night and enjoy short vacations together in the spring until solomon's arrival for their wedding in chapter 3 verses 6-11 chapter 4 details their wedding night as the couple compliments each other's head-to-toe beauty the marriage is consummated as solomon enters his spouse his garden and tastes of his honey here physical intercourse types the baptism of the holy ghost in the believer's soul because peter likens the new birth to receiving god's incorruptable seed as a woman receives her husband's seed on the wedding night chapters five through seven detail the shulamite struggles to respond quickly to her husband and her diligent seeking of his presence the couple again compliments each other's beauty in every body part as the wife longs to get away on vacation in order to give him her love any christian can relate to the shulamites desires to appropriately respond to christ's spirit and constantly live in his presence the body of christ is completely lovely in christ's eyes for he has washed it himself with his word in the eighth and final chapter the couple's love is best described as a seal upon their hearts stronger even than death adam proved love is stronger than death for he like christ after him purposely chose to die in order to be with eve he knew she was part of him and he could not deny himself jesus's love for his people was stronger than death for he raised from the dead to justify her jesus church loves him so much she willingly gives her life for him either through martyrdom or lifelong service in bible days nothing was more permanent than a king's seal as esther 8 verse 8 says the king's proclamation sealed with his ring is irreversible the couple's love is irreversible unending and eternal jesus's love is the seal of the holy ghost upon a christian's soul it's an unending spiritual love ephesians 4 30 promises the believer is sealed unto the day of redemption romans 5 verse 5 says the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us song of solomon ends identically to the new testament as both books have brides eager for their bridegroom's return song of solomon 8 14 records the wife urging solomon to return quickly like a speedy gazelle running down a mountain saying make haste my beloved and be thou like to a row or to a young heart upon the mountains of spices after jesus promises to come quickly john agrees saying amen even so come lord jesus christ's bride is greatly anticipating his return at the rapture lessons learned through bible brides wives and women today's new testament bride can learn valuable lessons she can instantly apply to her life from the women's lives recorded in the holy bible eve the first female came from adam as she was formed from his rib she is a representation of christ's bride originating from god's mind as we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world you came from the mind of god you are one of his eternal thoughts this means your soul is eternal you came from god and you will go back to god you are a part of his word which inspires you to daily live out his word the first female was deceived into sinning by the satan-filled serpent chapter 10 details satan injecting his nature into the human race christians don't put excessive guilt and blame upon eve for any of us in her position would have done the same but the lesson is to never add or take away from god's word as repeatedly taught in scripture he's desire should have been to adam the bride church's desire must only be to christ the bride church observes eve accepting the serpent's addition to god's command and learns not to repeat her error the serpent added one word not saying ye shall not surely die true churches will not add one thing to god's commands redemption story is seen in eve's life first in adam willingly sinning adam knew he would die if he partook of the forbidden fruit but he loved eve too much to live without her she was part of him so he took her sin upon himself trusting god's mercy to redeem them eve was deceived but adam wasn't this is allegorical of christ willingly taking all sin upon himself and dying on the cross for our redemption you also see god providing an animal sacrifice to forgive and redeem them both like god providing a ram to take isaac's place god prepared a body for christ to take your place on the cross adam and eve were clothed in their sacrifice wearing coats of skins in genesis 3 verse 21 jesus's forgiven bride church is spiritually clothed in his righteousness isaiah 61 verse 10 reads i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decath himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels eve is forever connected with adam just as the bride church is connected with christ jesus is called the last adam in first corinthians 15 45 because he is the true faithful adam where adam failed jesus conquered paul writes further for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive so if jesus is the last adam the bride church must be the last eve the obedient one desiring only her husband and she cannot be deceived jochebed the mother of moses along with her husband are examples of trusting in god in the face of governmental oppression egypt was killing all hebrew babies but jochebed's faith caused her to reject fear and cast moses upon the waters in an ark rather than let him die by egyptian hands god honored her faith ordaining pharaoh's daughter to find him jacob was eventually paid by the government to raise her own son christ's bride learns to honor god's word despite persecution as peter says we ought to obey god rather than men trust god with your children's destiny and god will reward you in ways you cannot imagine go to all lengths to love protect and train the children god gives you with confidence that god has a divine commission for their lives just as moses began following god at 80 years old have faith your children will someday repent and serve god job 22 verse 6 declares train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it deborah a prophetess and wife of lapidath became a judge in israel during a period of spiritual decline when israel was without male prophetic leadership god used her accurate prophecies to inspire barrack in his victorious attacks against the canaanites like he used sarah to move abraham in sending away hagar and ishmael jesus bride learns the power of prophecy from deborah's example the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy and ezra 6 14 says believers always prosper through prophecy you should expect prophetic words as jesus in john 16 13 says the holy ghost will tell us things to come although paul says women cannot preach to men due to eve's deception the new testament does give both men and women the right to prophesy and manifest all nine gifts of the holy ghost the bride church will have all nine gifts of the spirit operating in her midst the daughter of king saul and wife of david once saved david's life by helping him escape saul's wrath but after being given in marriage to another man and then reclaimed by david she despises and mocks david's spirit-led dancing and worship as he brings the ark into jerusalem she is condemned to a life of barrenness having no children bride members glean the importance of spirit-inspired worship expressed in singing dancing shouting and more paul writes in first thessalonians 5 19 quench not the spirit david knew music led by the holy ghost would cast out devils and jesus's bride knows the same churches who reject the emotional blessings of the holy ghost will go childless meaning their members will never be born again by the spirit just as natural babies are often born with noisy crying spiritual babies are baptized with the holy ghost through a bold emotional experience see chapter six macau is best resembled by judas iscariot the betrayer of jesus when he degraded lazarus sister mary judas was upset mary used very costly spike nerd to anoint jesus's feet and wipe them with her long uncut hair in john 12 verses 1 through 8. unlike judas bride churches follow the apostolic pattern of acts 4 verses 24 through 31 by getting in the spirit and fully loudly worshiping god with their bodies and emotions despite reproach from judas iscariot type mockers hannah the wife of elkanah and mother of the prophet samuel is known for desperately and emotionally seeking god for a child that she be not barren while pouring out her soul before the lord eli the priest mistakes her emotion for drunkenness but hannah explains her sincere desire eli announces god's approval of and answer to her request and vow after weaning samuel hannah keeps her promise and leaves samuel to minister in the priesthood lessons about the value of natural and spiritual children are learned here while most professing christian churches condone the killing of millions of babies both by abortions and birth control pills true churches abhor death and value all life yes birth control pills cause millions of abortions by preventing new children embryos from attaching to the uterine wall bride churches are desperate to see new life come forth in the natural womb of mothers and in the spiritual womb of the church during my ministry i have desperately prayed for two barren couples to have children and god heard the prayers for both now we rejoice like hannah in first samuel 1 27 for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petition which i asked of him bride churches must also pray earnestly for new converts to be born again by the holy ghost baptism acts chapters 1 and 2 show the early apostles praying for 10 days before receiving the new birth paul says in galatians 4 verse 19 he was willing to again travail in birth until the galatians were truly born from above their reverting to legalistic teachings proved they were not born again at first and paul was willing to help bring them to the born-again experience they previously fell short of many more lessons abound for bride members in the lives of biblical women abigail beautiful and wise was exalted to wife of king david following her reverent approach to him and the death of her first husband evil nabal first samuel 25. the bride church's first husband the law also dies and she offers pleasing sacrifices to her royal husband king jesus romans 7 verse 4 hebrews 13 15 first peter 2 5 revelation 19 verse 16. bathsheba disgraced by adultery before legally becoming david's wife was forgiven by god blessed with four sons and helped to secure solomon's succession to the throne first chronicles 3 verse 5 first kings chapter 1 bride members rest in god's complete washing away of sexual immorality and use all their power and influence to ensure christ rules with preeminence both in the church and in their hearts first corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11 colossians 1 verse 18 colossians 3 verse 15 mary the wife of joseph and mother of jesus is the epitome of childlike faith humbly receiving the angel gabriel's promise she would conceive the christ child in her virginity and decades later receive the spirit of christ in the upper room luke 1 verses 26 through 38 acts 1 verse 14 acts 2 verse 4. her testimony inspires bride members to live as chaste virgins to jesus quickly accept god's promises and obey every word until the new birth comes acts 5 32 2 corinthians 11 verse 2 verse thessalonians 2 13 anna an elderly widowed prophetess served god with fastings and prayers night and day and gave witness of baby jesus being the promised messiah redeemer at the same instant simeon prophesied of jesus's mission luke 2 verses 22-38 bride members understand life-long faithful decades of service to god and his house yield untold spiritual rewards and experiences god is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him hebrews 11 6 mary magdalene was healed from seven demons by christ and then faithfully followed and supported his ministry being present at the cross matthew 27 verse 56 luke 8 verse 2 jesus rewarded her faith by making her the first to see him after his resurrection mark 16 verse 9. the bride church enjoys the same freedom from devils as mary and seeks to imitate her unwavering devotion despite trials with the same promise to one day see the resurrected one face to face the samaritan woman jesus meets at jacob's well instantly recognizes jesus's prophetic gift when he reveals her secrets causing her to boldly testify to her city making many more converts to christ john 4 verses 1 through 42 believers experience the same discernment ability of the living word today hebrews 4 verse 12 and women in particular learn the power of testifying to others about jesus without preaching christian women testify but do not preach first timothy 2 verses 11-15 mary of bethany a sister of jesus's close friend lazarus serves as a powerful example of hearing the word and acting upon it despite her sister's objection mary chose to sit and listen to jesus rather than complete housework and christ approved of mary's decision saying all she heard would never be taken away luke 10 verses 39 through 42 christians today realize the revelations received during the preaching are eternal and the gates of hell will never prevail against them matthew 16 verses 17 and 18. priscilla the wife of aquila shows diligence in the faith by working alongside her husband to help paul host church services in her house and testify to apollos about god's further revelations acts 18 verses 2 through 26 romans 16 verse 3 first corinthians 16 verse 19 bride members glean the importance of staying in your position supporting preachers opening your home to the gospel and the power of testimonies the proverbs 31 woman types jesus's bride i would be remiss if i left out the proverbs 31 woman few portions of scripture play such a high value upon a godly holy woman proverbs 31 verse 10 declares who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies a simple online search about the value of rubies shows a single carat can be worth two million dollars a real christian woman's value equivalent to numerous rubies far exceeds millions and billions of dollars in the spiritual sense jesus's bride was

proverbs 31 woman is singled out and exalted above all women many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all ephesians 5 27 describes christ's bride church as being free from spot

receiving the revelation of church as jesus's bride those who receive the revelation of the church as jesus's bride experience great rewards now and in the heavenly home in this earthly life bride members have eternal assurance through the seal of the holy ghost baptism the holy spirit is jesus's nature ruling their human nature they are marked in their souls as christ's bride because they were in his mind before the world was through anointed preaching she will be faithfully washed from all iniquities and transgressions confident of jesus's return for her his bride the bride is rewarded with seeing the fruits of her decisions her wise decisions as the wise virgin group are undeniable to those around her her separated holy life is acknowledged as jesus teaches in matthew 5 verse 16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven she has left both the foolish virgin churches and the mother harlot church and enjoys a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty she is not totally free from trials but her physical and spiritual separation from worldly influences yields a special oneness with her lord her husband if you and your spouse receive this revelation you'll experience all the home life blessings spoken of in proverbs 31 god's presence in your home will be your treasure as parents and children love one another in godly harmony home will resemble heaven on earth heavenly rewards include experiencing the rapture the meeting in the air chapter 12 details this climatic event of human history during the tribulation you will sit with bride members from all ages at the marriage supper of the lamb enjoying communion with your bridegroom jesus following the supper you'll reign with christ on the earth for one thousand years revelation 20 verses 4 through 6 promises this as only bride members live and reign during this time period the rest of the dead foolish virgins make believers and unbelievers do not live until the 1000 year honeymoon is completed and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years as christ's beautiful wife the bride church sits next to him on thrones judging nations for a millennium this magnifies the importance of judging truth and error now for you cannot be a judge there unless you judge righteously here you will suffer rejection mockery and perhaps even physical persecution for judging earthly matters correctly endure these sufferings and temptations so you can reign later 2 timothy 2 verses 11 and 12 promises it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us two more heavenly rewards await jesus's bride she will sit with him in judgment at his white throne and live with him in the new jerusalem just as jesus promised to raise up the queen of the south and the men of nineveh on judgment day so will he use his bride's testimonies against unbelievers revelation 3 verse 21 says you'll sit with him on that day to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne paul says your testimony will judge unbelievers and fallen angels in first corinthians 6 verses 2 and 3. in the new jerusalem jesus bride is ever with him being fed by him and serving his desires her eternal privilege is seeing his loving face forever revelation 22 verses 3 and 4 declares and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads the consequences for rejecting the revelation of the church as jesus's bride rejecting the fact that god has a special people designated as his bride leads to the deception of universalism many live under the lie that we are all god's children god loves us the same and we are all going to heaven while it is true that god's love is impartial god's love must be received when churches willingly disobey any part of god's word they forfeit either part or all of god's blessings disobedience also signifies hatred for god since jesus taught obedience signifies your love for god in john 14 verses 15 21 and 23 23-24 doctors of this revelation will have chaos in their homes as another consequence when god's word is either discredited or not preached the listeners go home unwashed without spiritual correction and power family chaos ensues as second timothy 3 verses 1 and 2 4 tells this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy husbands will love themselves more than their wives and children teenagers and children alike will violently rebel against the ones who nurtured them and gave them life instead of treasure in their homes corruption will abide for those who will eventually be saved but reject this revelation their highest spiritual attainment is the foolish virgin category as taught by jesus and paul they will squander their precious time wandering from activity to activity ephesians 5 verses 15-17 says see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is foolish virgins are not quite sure what god's will is for their lives rather than being conformed to jesus's word image like the bride was they conformed to the world standards paul pleads with us to conform our minds to jesus's words in romans 12 verses 1 and 2. i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god future consequences are most awful for those who reject and blaspheme this revelation they may even become part of a church whether the mother harlot or one of her daughters as a result their lives will be filled with demonic influences in their bodies and minds through movies television shows and more mother harlot churches are the homes of every kind of devil according to revelation 18 verse 2. choosing to be a part of the false bride brings plagues revelation 18 verse 4 warns and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues the last miserable consequence for these lost souls is eternal separation from god in the lake of fire conclusion jesus is looking for a bride that will submit to his every word and accept her responsibilities and ministries will you let jesus wash away your every sin stain through the water of his word jesus offers his cleansing and thirst quenching water to every individual if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink you need not have to wonder if you are part of jesus's bride the bible doctrines and commands that any person can read straight out of the bible must be followed those who obey are the true bride separated from the foolish and evil women christ came to seek and save his bride and you will know his voice as you hear his word preached in its fullness and truth in becoming jesus bride you find your eternal destiny and position by his side your only word will be his word his thoughts will be your thoughts just as adam said of eve this is now bone of my bones and flesh in my flesh jesus says you are a word of his word life of his life and spirit of his spirit action steps step 1 repent for disobeying any bible command and seek the baptism of the holy ghost express your desire to fully submit to every word of god if you surrender fully he'll come in fully step 2 in kindness and respect separate yourself from both foolish and false churches if you are in need of a bride church please contact me revelation 22 verse 17 says the spirit and the bride are inviting you to come and drink of the waters of life freely if you desire a true church there has to be a church god has prepared for you psalm 42 verse 7 says deep calleth unto deep if you have a deep call and desire for truth god has a response waiting for you even if you have to start a bride church yourself step 3 continue to grow in grace and knowledge of the lord through continual sanctification the bride not only begins holiness but perfects and completes it second corinthians 7 verse 1 reads having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god
