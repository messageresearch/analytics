is [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] there's [Music] let's get right into the word and i'll turn to the book of hebrews chapter 5 verse 14. [Music] certainly keep everybody in prayer that's battling and going through the different things we're all going through but uh you know we're just grateful that the lord gives us a way that we can even still fellowship even in those hard times amen being able to do a live stream and those different things lord knows we'd prefer to you know see each other in the flesh but we're certainly grateful for the spirit of the lord that's here is able to minister to everyone that has need wherever they might be we're not bound by time or we're not bound by time or space or any of those things but the lord jesus is uh he's with his people and we're just gonna just read the we'll start at verse 11 and i'll just read to the end of the chapter here of whom we have many things to say and heart to be uttered seeing your goal of hearing for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principle of the oracles of god that are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen let's just bow our heads in the word of prayer heavenly father lord we just come humbly before you this evening lord jesus we just come to receive from you what we would have need of lord no doubt each one of us would have desires in our heart lord and lord our greatest desire lord is just to draw closer to you to live more closely to your lord every day and every single minute every single hour lord that we could just be more pleasing to you lord to just pray right now in the name of the lord jesus that you would come and anoint the service lord for your purpose lord we just want to lift up your name get glory unto thyself lord jesus and we just ask that your perfect will be done this evening lord and guide us and direct us in thy precious name we pray the lord jesus christ amen amen amen you may be seated oh thank you and then so last evening we just kind of spoke a little bit on the the contrasting attributes of god and forgetting to take this off it's pretty warm in here and just spoke last evening a little bit on the contrasting attributes of god in this age and how you know he's called each and every one of us oh thank you brother thanks for the thing uh he's called he's called us to be a contrast to the things that are going on in the world in this day and no doubt as as believers we are a contrasting uh contrasting force for the darkness in the world this the the light shining in the darkness and maybe this this evening we just want to speak maybe a little bit on on you know so many times the devil as we spoke about last night the devil is his goal is to hinder the work of god we know by the grace of the lord as believers we know that he can't stop the work of god amen the the lord says the word has gone forth from his mouth and it won't return to him void the lord has spoken good things concerning the pride of jesus christ in this day he says i know i know the thoughts i have towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil i'm going to give you an expected end and we know what our expected end in this age is and that's to that's to receive a rapture that's the that's to leave this place be joined with our bridegroom by the grace of god and we know that those things have been spoken about us and we see that the word is is desiring something of us in this hour to manifest the lord jesus to the world even though they may not see it they may not understand it they don't you know jesus when he was on earth according to the flesh they didn't understand him then the ones that claimed to be received receivers of the word the pharisees and the sadducees and the great minds of the day as much as they claimed to have the word and they did according to knowledge they didn't know according to the to the spirit of revelation who god himself was when he came on the scene and so we understand that that'll it'll be that way once again because these things always repeat themselves and in this day it's going to be the same way no matter how much you can prove it by the scriptures no matter how much it vindicates itself supernaturally or otherwise there's going to be those that can't receive it but god has called us to express his life in this day he said he said the works that i do he that believeth upon me the works that i do shall ye do also and and so it's not and those things aren't just limited to just supernatural work so many times we we pare those things down and we we all that's just the miracles and that's just the healings and those things are wonderful and we believe that that's part of it but it's it's also just it's the very life that the believer leads it's the very character of god himself expressed in his people you know we understand that we you know the the we call the stature of a perfect man and those things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and divine love or charity we understand that these these things are to be expressed in the believer amen and no matter how many miracles you could perform no matter how many signs and wonders could be done except that life lives in you and is being expressed by the believer then it doesn't profit anything because paul said though i though i could speak with the tongues of men and angels and and though i could do all these mighty works if i if i don't have charity which is charity in and of itself the capstone of the pyramid the capstone of it all jesus christ himself he if you were to have charity you have all of those things because it's all embodied in jesus christ so paul is summing up the whole thing except i have all of these things in me except this charity jesus christ which we know it the holy ghost because it is god himself god is that love god is that divine love the holy ghost is that divine love living in the believer except that lives in the believer and expresses itself out it doesn't profit anything did not jesus said many will come to me in that day and say lord lord have that we've done this and we've done that because surely they could look at the scripture and said jesus but jesus you said that whosoever believeth on me the works i do shall ye do also and no doubt that there were certain works that they did perform as far as the miracles and as far as signs and wonders and those things but there was the there was so much more to it than that it just it goes beyond just the surface level but it's just it's not just an outward uh if i could say it's not just an outward uh manifestation of miracles and and certain things that you can see with the eyes but it but it's a very life and a character that lives within the believer and you can't explain it because you cannot explain the supernatural if it could be explained that way then then it then surely the intellectuals would have picked it up by now but it can't be explained in in in an intellectual fashion that's why paul said i didn't come with enticing words of man's wisdom i didn't come with these great swelling words of of speech although we could have done it paul was a pharisee of pharisees he was educated he was a man brought under i think gamalia that was one of the great teachers of the time he said as concerning the law it was blameless he could have laid it out for him when it come to those things and yet he said i didn't come to you with that but i came with power and demonstration of the spirit and he came and humbled this in meekness he said i came to you in feet and much trembling and weakness how different it is from what so many people today believe that that a person of god should be with their chest stuck out walking around well i'm i'm this and i'm bad and i'm i'm whatever it might be so much pride and things and arrogance that goes on in the world today because that's the spirit of the age is arrogance everybody wants to have well i gotta have my place i got to get you know they say oh i got to get mine i got to get i got to get this i got to get that i got to get houses and lands and cars and treasures and riches and all these things how different it is from when jesus christ came on the scene and humbled himself to a form of a servant and made himself of no reputation the very god of heaven would humble himself to wash the feet of his own children to wash the feet of his own child and even think about it watch the feet of his own children before they were even converted how powerful a thought would you think that jesus christ would come down and humble himself to that place where he could but knowing that peter was going to deny him three times and yet he could wash his feet and humble himself to that but he was showing us that that the way up is down the way to be exalted is to humble yourself how we need a lesson in that today i believe we there's so much in the world of doing that but we but but god is looking for a humble expression of himself in this age and it's not it's not just it's not just a a a as we said miracles inside we need those things i believe we need more of them to be honest i believe that there's so much of it that we shoved up to the side and made excuses for why these things don't happen i believe in them but to go along with it needs to be the character because power without character say ten so in understanding this we want to come to a place where if we're going to be that expression in this hour where god is trying to to show his character through you through the believer it's not just on the minister it's not just on the song leader or the deacon but he's wanting to show his character through each and every member of the body through each and every member of the body from from the littlest child to the oldest elder and everywhere in between those that name the name of jesus christ filled with the holy ghost god is wanting to express his life through you and the devil will try to sell you short on your place in the body because the devil is always trying to build up certain things and tear down certain things and put people out of their place making it so that one or one part of the body is less than the other or one part's greater than the other and we know paul preached on these things he said if the whole body were the eye where would be the seeing if the whole body were were fingers you know what would you do see there's certain jobs that certain parts of the body can't do i don't ask my eyes i like to cook but i don't ask my eyes to pick up an onion and chop it up in fact my my eyes usually don't like when my hands do that you start to tear up and everything but you understand i wouldn't tell my my feet to read a book for me i i i wouldn't do that i couldn't it wouldn't make any sense it doesn't even make natural sense how much more for the body of christ is he desiring to use each part of the body for its purpose and exalt the people of god in that spot to the place of the issue i'm not talking about exaltation the way we think of it because our man's version of exaltation is it's to give he prays upon them and oh good job and don't get me wrong those things are good i like to hear a good job you like to hear a good job we want to hear at the end well done that good and faithful servant we're all looking for that ultimate good job at the end but see god's version of exaltation and so many times is so different from our own how many people would have thought how the scripture could say that that the the hills would skip like little rams and the mountains would melt like wax knowing that it was john the baptist coming out of the desert preaching that hardly anybody would hear only preach for six months and then put prison and behead beheaded and god said that was the greatest man born of a woman he said there's not been a man more of a woman like john and that was god's version of exaltation was was to fulfill the purpose that god had for him god had a purpose for john the baptist and because he fulfilled that god could say i'm going to put you in the place you deserve i'm going to put you in the hall of pain but the what we have to do is we have to find our place and then we have to stick to it it's so easy to always you know we're always looking on what everybody else has got so much envy and and and jealousy when it comes to someone has this oh i want to be this not knowing all the wild they're looking back at you saying oh i want to be that you know and it's so it's amazing because the devil's really good at his job he likes to sew that discord he likes to sew those seats everywhere he likes to try to put everything out of place and try to try to make it so that you can't even function anymore because you're so obsessed with something else when the lord says all i want you to do is fulfill your place and he's got a place for you bride of christ people of the body of christ he's got a place for you to fulfill and we need to be content with such things as we have be content with what god's given us be satisfied with our portion in the body now now we're never satisfied with where we are with christ my desire every day is to get closer and closer and closer to be more like him more like him but i want to be content with the things that he's given me and so be that the lord would want to give me something else i'd say lord be it unto me according to thy word but but the lord said he said if you're faithful and little you'll be faithful in much and so many times maybe the lord wants to give you more but he says what are you doing with what i've given you already but you're too busy not satisfied with and i don't know even why we're preaching this right now apparently that's just the way the lord wanted to go this isn't anywhere where i was thinking so let's just let the lord have his way but he just says i want you to be satisfied be content with where you find yourself and then don't be looking longing for the things that other people have because it won't do you any good anyway not only will it make you miserable but it'll make you unfruitful in the place that god's called you if you're so busy looking you know each one of us is almost like a garden we the lord's planted us in a place and he's given us our little our little sphere of influence our little atmosphere and our our sphere of influence that we that we interact with there's going to be many people that sister wendy interacts with that i'll never interact with that that's her little garden that the lord's given her to watch over and to keep and to to influence for the the kingdom of god brother amen the same thing for the bang all the different ones we all have these places that god has planted us it's such a variety and it's so awesome to see how god does it how he puts us in these places and he sets us up i couldn't fulfill the place that sister wendy does i couldn't fulfill the place brother amen or brother bang or any of the any of the other ones i couldn't do it i couldn't fulfill the place of brother jesse or or or brother brother cam over there napoleon but each one of us has been planted like a tree by the rivers of living water in our little place and what we need to do is be instead of always looking oh it's looking oh man sister i wish i had sister wendy's life i wish i had this or that always looking at at her garden and desiring all the while the weeds are popping up in your own garden tend to your own tend to your own so many times you know i believe it was paul who said that instead of looking upon our own things we need to look upon the things of others and he's not see you could take that to mean the wrong thing that doesn't mean i look at sister wendy's things and say oh i want those no it's but we're we're we care for the needs of people but when it comes to our spiritual well-being so many times we get so looking at oh what about their life what's going on there and oh i want to try to fix what's going on here and and you get nitpicky over here you start looking over here and back fighting over there and gosh being over here and trying to figure this out over here and pretty soon i believe song of solomon i believe the girl the woman in song of solomon said said all the other gardens have i kept but my own have not kept and what is it so many times we get so invested in every other person's calling every other person's ministry every other person's purpose that we lose sight of the fact that we're part of this too that we have a purpose to play for our life that god has a place for you to go that god has something for you to do that is he has a a a a world an atmosphere that you're supposed to create he wants you to be looking at your little garden dig up those weeds get the foxes out of there that's spoiled to find start fertilizing the ground with the with the word start watering it with the washing of the water by the word fertilize it you know when sometimes fertilizer is not pleasant fertilizer usually stinks it's usually made out of dawn or something along those lines but what is it those are those are the experiences we go through our trials and troubles what is it doing it's laying that fertilizer all around your life why and then you come up stronger from it you start putting that new branches and pretty soon pretty soon you start putting forth fruits but what we want to do is we want that's what we want in our lives is we want to be the expression that god desires for us each part of the body has to express what it is it can't express what the other part is that's where we get in trouble so many times is that we try to do an imitation of something else to try to be try to be something else because you admire it it may even be for the right reasons oh i i certainly appreciate the way they do this and do that and pretty soon you find yourselves kind of locked into a into a prison where you model everything you're doing after that person it'll almost you almost start to talk like they do and act like they do and and you fall under their anointing as it were now now your mind's no longer your own and you got to be really careful about that because that's the influence that the world wants to put out onto people paul said follow me as i follow christ paul didn't say i want you to be just like me or i want you to do this or do that he said the opposite he said he said i i i'm glad that i didn't baptize any of you because i don't want it to become a name game of oh i'm a paul and i have a peter and i have a fist and i'm a fat and i'm of apollos he said but but i just i want the name of jesus christ to be lifted up i want to see us all come into the perfection of the body of christ so god has this expression that he wants to bring out from you as the as the part of the body he has a life that is in you his very life the same life if that same spirit that dwelled in christ jesus being you it'll rain you know as a quick in his mortal body it'll quicken your moral body amen amen as it quick in his body it'll quicken yours so that very life inside of you god has a purpose for it to express itself so god had planted that seed deep down as we say on the inside of the inside of the inside way where no one could find it but one day the light of god of the gospel the light of the gospel showed in your life quicken that seed to life god sealed it by the holy ghost and now god's desire is to take that life and let it grow let it grow let it grow and express itself to the world god wants to express himself that's why he's done so much of this if god had these attributes in himself these characteristics that he was that he wanted to express and so he created the heavens and the earth he created hit the creatures the different things that i believe brother branham expressed it in the way i don't have the quote but he expressed it i believe in a way where he said when adam was even naming the animals he was naming him by their characteristics he would see the lion make a mighty roar and something would inspire him by that character that he saw in the creature said you're a lion or he'd see a a an eagle sword up in the sky and he'd hear that eagle scream and see him flying up there and soaring and he said you're an eagle there is a character behind it god with just little tidbits if we could almost call him breadcrumbs of his character that he just places all over i mean you look at the majesty of the mountains and the the vastness of the oceans and now god you know even the the poets and and the psalmist which is you don't say it's we we only we can only use the words that we have in this mortal realm to express the greatness of god how he could say you know yeah i was even discussing with my wife or i can't remember maybe it wasn't her or something i don't remember who it was now but talking about you know the arrogance of man and how we get so we man thinks they know so much oh we're gonna do this and we're gonna go to the moon and we're gonna go to mars and we're gonna build this and we're gonna do that and we're gonna we're gonna be able to do whatever we want to do and no doubt that to an extent they certainly could because even the lord said that nothing would be restrained from them when they're in one accord and yet even then i was just thinking about i said i didn't say this to anybody in particular but i just was thinking about it you know we they say we know so much about space but we don't even know what's on the bottom of the ocean it's so deep and vast and mysterious and so no wonder even the psalmist the different ones and and the scripture writings could say he cast them into the sea of god's forgetfulness why because even even space wasn't enough for them to understand the depths of the ocean and even look at it and we even see reality portrays that because we even know almost more about space above us than we do about the oceans below it's a mystery why how god could just forget your sins underneath the blood but i'm so thankful that he can and it's not because it's not because of anything i need to understand it's only because he said so because he said you were forgiven because he said in their sins and iniquities i will remember no more i'm so grateful for that amen so god put the seed in you these characteristics out there that he's that that he's placed you know because only one had the fullness and that was jesus christ the fullness of god dwelt in that that mortal flesh that came down and yet when on the day of pentecost as an example he said like cloven tongues of fire lit upon each one god dispensing a portion of himself to each of the believers just a portion that he placed in you even before the foundation of the world what we understand we call it a word scene it was a portion of himself that he placed in there before the foundation of the world and that portion has has attributes that it wants to express and we spoke a little bit about that yesterday on how how when you when you come into a poor place and there's there's a sickness there's an attribute in the believer of healing that can reach out and meet that need it's not that you in and of yourself can meet that need see we need to separate the flesh from who we are in jesus christ and it's not that that brother randy can meet the need it's not that brother bang can meet the need but if the god that is in brother bang is able to manifest itself and come and be expressed out of the believer to meet that need that can stand in the gap at that moment just like moses when god said i will destroy all of all of israel and i'll start afresh with you moses and there was an attribute in moses that when that happened had to express itself and say oh god take me and be far be it from you god to do that and what was it it was an attribute of jesus christ manifesting itself in that moment and i believe that is the portion for every believer you may not be the fullness of it but i want you to think about even the the situation where brother bran we've all heard the story i believe when brother brandon was in the meeting and the sister came up and wanted prayer for her little baby and brother ram said you know that baby's already healed that sister right there prayed for a little while ago and god healed the baby what was it that sister had a pool there was something on the inside of her there was there was a an expression an attribute a characteristic of god of healing that wanted to manifest itself through that sister not through the prophet but through that sister god wanted to manifest healing to that child and to the child's mother to show that god is the same yesterday today and forever jesus christ the same wanted to show that just as it was when paul when peter was walking through the street he said silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give to you what was it you said that such as i have i have healing in me by the grace of the lord jesus there is healing in me not because i have anything not because i am anything in it of myself but because i believe that god has filled me with the spirit god has sealed me with the holy ghost god has put his attribute in me and and recognize that that's who i am there is a god that can meet the need and he's chosen me to be the one right now that can that can meet that need so brother branham says well that sister already prayed and you see how the devil fights and says oh i couldn't pray for that maybe she came to be prayed for by the prophet see that's what the devil's trick is when it comes to the body it's oh i you know maybe maybe that sister was just a little pinky toe when he say see we're always trying to rank things one's better than the other and that's i believe that that's just uh that's just something that gentiles do i believe is that the gentiles they always try to exercise dominion one over the other and the scripture says the gentiles they always try to exercise dominion whatever they're always trying to get one over on each other and the struggle for power and we fight that as people where we're always trying to compare ourselves one with another and you're trying to judge who you are based on who someone else is that's not going to work it's not good it's not right it'll only put you down as spiraling a spiraling downward spiral down to hell and misery and and absolute depression but if we don't compare ourselves to jesus christ if we'd all just stop trying to measure ourselves by by false measuring sticks i don't measure my life by the life of a prophet i don't measure my life against the life of brother bang or sister wendy i measure my life by the word of god i measure my life by jesus christ and him alone he is the only measuring stick that matters because if you're measuring yourself by me you might get to a place where you're satisfied with where you're at right you don't see me well enough to know all the struggles i got see you get a glimpse of me every once in a while and say oh if i could just be like that brother or put someone else here you know if i could just be like brother jesse and brother jesse is a wonderful brother but he's a man of like passions everybody's got their struggles i have my struggles you have your struggles and if you're measuring this what we call it uh i believe they call it's a rubber ruler it'll it'll never work it's too flexible it's too bendy you need to have something that doesn't move you need to have something that's unchanging you need to have a measuring stick that doesn't that does that just straight as an arrow it has no pen to it at all and that's the word of god i am i am the lord god i am the god of my i don't change he doesn't change he's the same yesterday and forever amen but we get so busy looking at each other comparing ourselves one with another and that's where the devil gets us and he makes you unfruitful because now you can't measure up to whatever the devil has put in your mind of what you're supposed to measure up to now when in reality we ought to all realize that we've all come short of the glory of god but by the blood of jesus christ he has perfected us in the name of jesus christ we've been accepted in the beloved amen and now i don't have any conscience of those things anymore i don't have to i don't have to live with the guilt anymore i don't have to think so little of myself anymore yes according to the flesh i'm nothing this flesh is rotten it's my worst enemy but in the spirit man on the inside man the one that would seal the way it believes every word of god i know i can stand and go boldly before the throne of grace and ask whatever i have need of and god will bring it to pass if i have need of it because he promised it to be so and there's nothing between me and my savior because i don't have to measure myself to the to the life of brother amen and say oh if i could just get like him and just live that way maybe something would change nothing's going to change until you realize that we've all come short and that jesus christ is the only one to measure up to we've spent so much time trying to measure up to a prophet he's not the measuring stick amen the word is the measuring stick and we've got to take that and run with it because a man will fail you every time a man will fail you every time so the devil gets on this woman well i say gets on this woman tries to really influence her and say oh well you shouldn't go pray because she came to she came to get prayed for my brother and she and it just tugged on her and took down her and jumped on her jesus you know what i just got to clear my conscience and i'm just going to go do it so it's done even if it doesn't do anything you know that's the attitude we have sometimes the lord will put something on your heart and it just sits there and it weighs heavier and heavier and finally say fine lord i'll do it i don't feel like i maybe should i don't feel worthy you're not worthy it doesn't matter according to the flesh you'll never be worthy we're counting like what did we say yesterday it's not that you can achieve it's not that you can overcome it's the fact that he already overcame for you it's not that you are perfect it's the fact that you have been accepted in his perfect in his perfection you have literally become his righteousness and he took our sin upon you or him you're sitting upon him i should say forgive me so she's fighting with this if i said it's fine i just go pray for probably didn't feel anything probably didn't think anything of it just said okay thank you lord i got that off my mind not even knowing that the baby was healed and then here comes the lord has to go through the prophet because people haven't been able to see this for themselves so the lord has to use the prophet to explain that that's not a bad thing i will sit there all you know the lord puts it on your heart to pray for someone oh i don't you know maybe i shouldn't you know that's the pastor's job to pray for him or something you know we get these ideas in our head of of what these things are and no each one of you is a member of that body each one it's not healing power it does not just rest in one individual it doesn't rest just in one office it rests with jesus christ in him alone that power and deliverance the same way the power of salvation the same way it doesn't just rest in one person it doesn't just rest in some what we call special class of people like ministers or or song leaders or whatever or whatever names that we give to offices it doesn't just rest there but but salvation it belongs to the people of god all of these attributes belong to the children and to the people of god amen i've said it a lot of times like one of my greatest things that i desire to see is to see the people of god empowered amen to to live their life for jesus christ to not to not sit there and let the devil drag him down and make him think like they can't do anything about the situation it's not about whether you can it's whether you can just believe that jesus christ is the master of every situation he's the master of all the situations you can come into contact with it doesn't matter it really doesn't matter what it looks like but if you could believe this word if you can trust in him he'll bring it to pass we get ourselves comparing but she prays and brother brown says well that the sister prayed for you already you know and the one with the baby didn't know didn't know you know maybe if we were more more sanctified or i should say maybe more more really consecrated i think it's the better word if we were more consecrated and really in the presence of god where we were just really in the channel of being able to hear from the lord all the time where we ought to be you know it's it's difficult in this age especially so many voices and atmospheres everywhere just bombarding everything but i wonder i almost wonder if maybe if we were just really right in tune with the spirit of god that that sister might have known when she when that sister prayed for oh it's over it's over but see the lord uses those as examples for us to understand so god is looking to express himself through you not just the pastor we want to keep everything on the pastures we want to keep everything on the preachers no the the preacher's job if i could say just if i could maybe just speak for what i by the grace of the lord you know evangelist job is to to reignite the fires not just so people can sit there be comfortable oh it's nice it's wonderful it's not but it's to get them so they go out the people go out and start setting everything else on fire we're going to be on firebrand we're calling we want to we want to have the holy ghost burning so hard where it's just you just can't put it out it's just it's just going and going and going and the lord is able to move when he needs to move he's able to speak when he wants to speak when he says something to you with no questions asked but when so it's easier to sit back and put it all on a one person or one group of people and we got to be careful because that's that lickolating spirit you know it's so easy to just walk right into it because because the devil makes it look so appealing oh you can be part of this but you really don't have to do i i and forget i know it's sometimes we get with this word but you don't have to do any work it is but there's work to be done there's work to be done it's not about oh i'm trying to work my way into heaven no see we've the devil has twisted it up so much that some of these words become bad words to us you know but but if we're if we're called to be christians in this hour when we are we're called to be the bride of jesus christ we're called to express this word then there's work to be done james james i believe he was the one who said he said you show me your faith without works i'll show you my faith by my works so it's it and that's not the fact that works save me but it's an answer of my conscience in who i am that if if if the spirit of god dwells in me that i would i have to work the works of god because it's who i am now there's no other choice it's like i my brother brandon explained it and said if the spirit of beethoven was in me then i'd write i'd write concertos i'd write symphonies why because that spirit that life that was in beethoven had attributes to be gifted at music so much so that my historical understanding was he was basically mostly deaf and yet he was able to write music why because there were attributes in him to do that to write great music that they still talk about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years later and if if it be that way it wasn't that he was just doing it because maybe he just felt he needed to it was part of him to do it and so is it with the people of god if the spirit of christ being you that it can't help but work the works of god and it's not that we do things in order to be saved in fact that because there's no work you can do but because we are saved we work the works of god don't be weary in well-doing and that's what we get many times is we just get weary of it but he said true religion to visit the widows and to visit the orphans and to help those that are in need if you say you know someone says i have need it said bless may the lord's blessings be upon you go be clothed and fed and you just send them on their way well what good does that do that there needs to be something done about it there's an actual work to do oh well you can say oh oh lord may your spirit just witness to the people and you don't ever go out and talk about the lord jesus well then what's it gonna do what's it gonna do there's a work to me you show me your faith without works i'll show you my faith by my works by the way i live my life will express that and that's what god is looking to do if the attributes are there it if the life of god is there then it will express itself through you amen it says lay hands on the sick they shall recover if two or three of or if if two or three of you agree on anything in my name i'll do it though these are the things that they're simple things they're very they're very just very easy to really to do because it comes natural but so many times we get caught up in oh well should i do this or should i do that and am i just am i doing it because i just know i ought to well yes you are doing it because you that's who you are and you know you want to do it but the devil tries to come right around so remember you always start to play both sides of the argument he says oh you shouldn't do it because you know you don't need to prove anything you know you're saved you don't need to prove that you're saved it's not about proving that i'm saved i don't need to prove it to anybody in fact many times it's the lord that needs to prove it to us what what who we are and these different things he's already spoken about you it's i don't have to prove anything except that i i just had to live my life for him and he'll make the proof i don't i don't i you know even me i'd say coming here i don't come here to minister to prove anything i just come to be lord willing a blessing because it seems to be my my my post of duty to be you know that and it's not anything to puff any person up or anything but it's but these things if though it were to do any of the works when it comes to the to the simple everyday things where would we be [Music] where would we be we but that's but that's what it is we drop the ball on a lot of those things because we're we're just content to say well i'm not that part of the body it must be someone else's job you forgive me i just kind of got we just went in a totally different direction this evening i was playing my plan was something else and the lord had a different plan so you know we praise the lord for that you know the people of god i believe should be empowered to understand that you have the devil's answer amen you have the answer to the devil's question when the devil when the devil comes and says oh there's this situation in your life maybe you know sickness or something and it doesn't look like there's any there's any there's any way out that bride has the devil's answer you have the devil's answer because the word's already spoken he's the lord that heals you he heals all your diseases when you have need of something in the natural jehovah jireh he will provide amen he will provide for him his own he'll provide for himself a sacrifice he'll provide for you whatever you need whatever you have need of not necessarily always what you want but what you need [Music] and so i guess just in closing this will be a short service this evening i just kind of feel like to stop there uh but god is wanting to express himself through each and every one of his people he's not looking it's not if the lord wanted the animals to preach the gospel he would have done it if he wanted the sky to to just to to be speaking down to the people and the thunderous voices to come down or or angels to manifest themselves in those ways he would have done that if he wanted you know if he wanted the inanimate objects to preach the gospel he could do it the lord said if you if you silence thieves he says god's able to be stoned to raise up children to abraham he said if you silence thieves that are trying to praise he said the very rocks would cry out he's able to do it but god had purpose in himself that he would use man to express himself and that's what he's desiring to do so when you come up against situations in your life when you come up against that person at your job that just seems tormented or or or wants to torment you for whatever reason as we said yesterday you know just if the world hate you just remember it hated the lord jesus first so when you come up these situations that people hate you without a cause you have that attribute of peace inside of you you have a characteristic of god that is wanting to see god doesn't let things just happen by accident we're not just blindly stumbling through life just hoping to get to the finish line no god has opened our eyes god orders the footsteps of the righteous it has a plan for your life he's sent you on this course and he is going to guide you all the way if you let him most of the problems we come into is because we get off track we ignore the warnings in the voice of god but god when he brings things to your life obstacles it's because he's trying to draw something out of you you know he does that even in the church god will bring people into into the into the local body even here bride of christ fellowship he'll bring ones from all different backgrounds different experiences different personalities maybe don't even get along about certain things according to the natural one might like bananas and the other one is maybe even allergic to bananas or what one likes this certain thing and the other one doesn't like this certain thing or one's personality it's more like this and but the other one seems to kind of clash with it in a certain way according to the flesh but see by those things it's like iron sharpening iron god is in fact if those things exist they're only meant to be used by god to form and to shape his people just like the devil the devil is nothing but a punching bag he's nothing but a test giver he's nothing but just a constant exam in a constant testing ground for the people of god because the the devil's already been overcome the work's already been done the devil the devil's already been put under our feet but what does he do it's almost like i mean forgive me i know maybe it sounds really crude but i've heard that that in even in nature that that animals well to teach their young how to hunt will bring injured animals to them to teach the young ones how to kill the animal and how to how to hunt and eat it and in a way that's what god the great the great lion of the tribe of judah has done for his children if he's already wounded and already bruised the head of the devil and all that all god's done with his trials come into your life if he just dragged that part out you almost feel sorry for him almost is when he he drags that old devil over to you and says no no now son or daughter i want you to finish him off i want you to show this devil what i'm going to teach i taught you how to do it you finish them off and so many times we going to to do that and the devil goes boo and tries to scare us off no we got to press on and understand that that uh our jehovah god our great father our heavenly father's already done the work for us the enemy's already been slain and beaten but he's looking for us to he wants us that's why we're more than overcomers we're more than conquerors because he's already done the work he's already done the hard part he's already done the hard thing he he sacrificed himself for you so you can have that victory and now he's dragged the devil by the scruff of his neck over to you and says now now not my son or daughter you finish him off and sure as we go on maybe the the the philistines we're facing get a little bit bigger they look a little bit more a little bit more intimidating why it's just the lord just teaching you that no matter what the situation looks like just like david how he could look back and say just like i killed the lion just like i slew the bear this this uncircumcised philistine can't do anything against the armies of the living god amen and so what is god doing he'll be bringing these things into your life and he's just trying to say i watch you i put it in you just like to that little lion cub that mama said in you is to be this hunter to slay to eat the game and god is trying to tell you i put it in you to be that eagle now to eat to to hunt to take out that devil to be able to see with with clear vision what what where where we're at and who you are and he's wanting you to grab hold of it it's not that i am doing it but i have confidence in the fact that he's already done it just like it's just like i i'd always say we're closing but it just seems like the lord inspires it but you just see the truth of it when you look all the way back even with moses god had given him the commission there in the backside of the desert he said i have come i've heard the cries of my people i've come down to deliver them and now i'm sending you so go gives him all the signs gives him all the wonders and what is that he's doing all these things training moses he'd already been through 40 years in the wilderness of training now he's even training him more as he goes and finally they get to the red sea and now it looks you know the the lord was bringing up those little weak weak looking devils and moses was just slaying them just slaying them just slaying them and all of a sudden maybe they look a little bit they look a little bit more intimidating when the death angel comes down but moses said i'm sticking with that word we're going to kill the passover we're going to follow the word of god slaves that one moves on and now all of a sudden he kind of gets to his goliath and there's the red sea standing in front of him and even moses he's not even service training anymore you would think after all that they had been through he would have had the confidence maybe not even knowing how to do it necessarily but knowing that god could do it but he he despairs and says what are we going to do and god the lord has to just like he does to us he says i thought i told you already you i've come to deliver the people i've sent you you have the commission you have the need you are that situation but speak and go forward amen why because it may look big but your situation may look a lot bigger we're getting word to a place at this end right before a rapture where these those two hundred thousand thousands out of the river euphrates all those demons loose ancient demons that's what i think we've called them these ancient demons from antilluvian times they look so big but i tell you what brothers and sisters they are just as defeated as that little demon that you never feared before in your life they are just as much under your feet they are just as much defeated the only question is do you believe the commission that god has given to you not just giving it to the preacher not just giving it to brother branham as a prophet not just giving it to this one or that one but giving it to you you have the authority you have the power in the name of jesus christ to slay the enemy because he's already dead the lord just wants you to finish the job he's already been defeated the enemy's already been defeated if we could really get that revelation if we could really get that revelation the enemy has already been defeated all you got to do is speak and go forward yeah it might not make any sense sometimes in the natural you may not understand it many times you won't understand it but the enemy's already been defeated all we got to do is understand that it's our inheritance it is our calling it is our duty to fulfill that now and to possess that land and to take back you know as we sing that song i went to the enemies camp and i took back what he stole from me it's our duty to do so because it wasn't his to begin with he just a squatter you know they still have that today even in the natural you know i've heard i've heard people pull those scams people go traveling for period to time they come back and there are people living in their house person unlocks the door they find they can't unlock the door because the locks are all changed someone came while they were gone and just lived in their house and and they this is my house and the person sitting in there is a squatter says no it isn't it's my house i don't know it's my house they said no it's not it's my house prove it and what do they got to do they got to go all the way back and they got to try to prove it well that's what the devil does with us trying to say you come to that healing and he's just sitting there on the healing so no this is mine you can't have it no that's my healing i see it right here take it back to the word it's yours it's yours the victory's already won there's nothing to fear there's nothing to worry about don't don't be looking to fill someone else's place fill the place god has for you because god has a place for you be make your calling and election sure and then wait on your ministry find out what the lord has for you in the meantime you know many times we're so busy looking to do what we call the great things so many want to preach or somebody want to do this and so many want to do that and so they're a preacher they want to they want to sing or they want to they want to be they want to be a a missionary or this and those are wonderful ideas to have if it's what the lord has for you i don't know but so many times we've elevated certain things into certain places when god says no i i want you to be right here i want you to be right here at this post of duty because this is what i've called for you and said instead of doing that and to god that's great because it's great when you can stay in the will of god when you can stay in the perfect will of god god calls that great not what you can imagine for yourself david wanted to build a temple unto the lord it was a good idea it wasn't a bad idea it was inspired but it wasn't for him to do it was for his son to do and so what did he do what instead of trying to find a way around it he accepted the word of the lord and he did what he could to as we put our shoulder to the wheel put his shoulder to the wheel so he started laying up some of the things started trying to prepare maybe something for it in the future saying lord i'll do what i can i know i'm not called to build it but maybe we can say it like this maybe i'm not called to to preach but i'm going to pray for that preacher oh every day i'm going to pray for my pastor and i'm going to get on my i may not be called to build the temple as it were but i'm going to get on my knees and pray that the lord gave him the materials to build that body because that's what god is doing he's he's fitly joining together building this body together saying look get on your knees and pray lord give him the material give him the word to speak give him the inspiration give him the songs to sing for the song leader that's so important but we we belittle it because it's our the man's ideas of great are are what god calls foolish man's eye man's idea of great is to be in the spotlight and to be this great thing god's idea of great it's like we said john the baptist six months and ended with a beheading six months of ministry got beheaded and jesus called that great but unless you have a following of hundreds and hundreds of thousands and thousands and all these certain things happening no miracles done in the ministry of john the baptist and yet god called it great so instead of letting the devil work on our minds of trying to convince us who who we think we should be let's be what god has actually called us to be let's do what god has called us to do you say well i don't know what i can do well i tell you what you can pray pray without ceasing you look at the word if remember brother branham gave us the template he said if god puts it on your heart to do something first look in the word is it in the word and if your motive and objective's right and it's in the word and you fit the qualifications or whatever it might be if you're in the place to do it then then go forward but but if but if you find well i don't know well like we said you know what about visiting the widows and the sick who oh see well that's the kind old priest well now you're going right back to that old catholic mentality that old pharisee sadducee mentality well that's the that's the that's the minister's job well are we not all ministers have we not all been called kings and priests in the sense that god has called us to be intercessors he's called us all to be able to bear that light to bear the light of the gospel to live a life sisters well as we said you know maybe i maybe i think you know this is just my own thinking so don't think i'm trying to make a doctrine out of it but i i even now it just inspired me to think that maybe one of the reasons the lord allowed sisters to have such a visual impact as far as their testimony is because the lord has not called them to preach verbally behind a pulpit so as we said yesterday that light that you're shining sisters is so great and you don't even know because you're in the light you know the the devil tries to you know he makes us blind he we're blind to it most of the time because oh this is just this is the life that the lord's given us and this is what we do but that light is great so let that light shine what about helping out the needy all these little things that oh well someone else will do that no god's called the believer to do that he's called us to fulfill that that's james said that that was pure religion and undefiled so if we we want to be believers let's let's fulfill our portion each one of us has a part to play there's no big eyes little used when it all comes down to it we're all saved by the same blood filled with the same spirit we're all we're all praising the same lord jesus we're looking for that same city whose builder and maker is god amen let's all stand [Music] i trust is an encouragement to you like i said i really just my desire is to see i want to see the people of god empowered in the spirit of god it is by empowered us not to mean to walk around you know laying hands on everybody and miracles happening i want to see those things too but empowered to understand we and we need that revelation we understand that of who we are of what our real position is what the the ivf uh full revelation of the atonement that jesus christ gave on calvary forgive me if it seemed a little bit chopped up there i just went a totally different direction from what was even in the notes or i had a thought of but we just trust it was a blessing to you let's just bow our heads inward for and then we'll have brother amen uh close with a few songs here again we just keep everybody in prayer that might be battling with the sicknesses and stuff you know it's um it's an interesting thing you know because i remember you know hear on the news and they everybody you hear on different things in the news i think they call it for a while they're calling it oh it's the unseen enemy the kovac 19 thing the unseen enemy and it's just it's just a manifestation of what we fight every day the unseen enemy that old devil that's just trying to battle the bride of jesus christ but we just pray for all those that may you know struggling with sickness and all those things the lord is a healer we thank the lord that as far as we know any of those that had been sick hadn't been really serious like you know you hear stories about and we're certainly grateful for that but even if it was you know we don't fear any of these things we're more than conquerors amen so we're just you know and just grateful to uh brother jesse for inviting us out here and uh just trust everything was a blessing to you and to all those that might be listening on the live stream you know we're grateful for the ability to do that and um we don't ever want to make that uh you know don't let the devil try to make that a a substitution you know the scripture says don't forsake the assembling of the saints you know the gathering of yourselves together we desire to fulfill that word of god and come together when when the lord you know has it done you know brother branham said that that true that christian desires to be there whenever the doors are open so you know but we're grateful for when these circumstances come that we have that you know that it's so wonderful to see how the lord i certainly i appreciate the lord because how he takes the devil's own devices and he turns it into it he turns it against him you know the devil is out there trying to make these great scientific achievements like cars and different things yeah sure it kills a lot of people but it also allows people that might not be able to get to church to get there where they couldn't have done it before and the live stream you know how the devil uses technology in such a wicked way and and computers and things but the lord can use it for good so we praise the lord for us to be able to use those things for good and i believe it was david who used goliath's own sword to chop his own head off to chop his head off so we thank the lord for that our god he's he's awesome you know and we're grateful for that so let's just power ahead in a little prayer heavenly father lord we just are grateful to you lord for your your never-ending mercies lord and your faithfulness to your your people lord maybe just really broken up and maybe didn't have maybe singularly a clear direction but we just trust oh god that the words that were spoken would be a blessing to your people lord we're desiring lord to find ourselves in our position and our posted duty lord no matter how small it would be i believe david in the psalms said that he he'd rather be a doorman at the house of god than to to be a king anywhere else and lord it seems like it's an easy thing to say but in the natural man's desire always seems to be to look for that great position notoriety and those things but lord help us to humble ourselves before you lord and lord not to think of ourselves any great thing because without you we're nothing anyway lord if it wasn't for you lord on calvary and your blood that was shed and lord if it wasn't for the word that you spoke of us before the foundation of the world and knowing us before the foundation of the word and writing our names on the lamb's book of life lord where would we be we wouldn't even be here now lord it ought to humble us so much lord that we lord i even think about how for myself just being a a person that was born even born in the united states lord being able to have freedom and and as it were in the natural have a pretty easy life lord and maybe that comes with different burdens that we have to bear as different struggles and things that the devil tries to get but lord we just never want to be overlooked the things that you've done for us lord we have a place to gather together this evening lord we're able to to live stream of service to those who aren't able to be here lord and we know their earnest desire would be to be among the saints but oh god you provided a way as you always do lord but lord let us just go forward father in our lives knowing that you have already conquered forest father that the devil is a defeated being that satan has already been defeated that all we need to do is walk forward in that confidence and and trusting in your word lord that you've already done the work but we're just desiring to be that
