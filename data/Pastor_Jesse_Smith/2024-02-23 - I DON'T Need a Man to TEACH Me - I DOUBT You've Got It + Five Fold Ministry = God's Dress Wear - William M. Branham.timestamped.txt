[0:26] spirit is the teacher why did the Holy
[0:29] Spirit put teach in the church stand to
[0:31] set the church in har the same holy
[0:33] spirit amen sure we don't need any
[0:36] seminaries to go around a big bunch of
[0:38] man to look out these things the holy
[0:39] spirit is a teacher see it's a teacher
[0:42] and it gives a some fellow a gift of
[0:45] teaching then you must be subject to
[0:47] that gift if here's some man to when
[0:50] we're going here and he's got a gift of
[0:53] healing Faith and Healing and I'm sick I
[0:56] walk up to him and say brother what must
[0:58] I do he stands there he's a prophet and
[1:01] he stands there with a gift he said thus
[1:04] sayith the Lord William Brandon you know
[1:06] you've done a certain thing day before
[1:09] yesterday in a certain place and that's
[1:11] the reason you're sick today because you
[1:13] did something I'm subject to that gift I
[1:15] ain't going to say oh you're wrong I
[1:17] don't care what you say I know who I am
[1:20] not I'll die in that condition see I've
[1:24] done something wrong now the things me
[1:27] do when I see that I'm wrong I say yes
[1:30] my dear brother the holy spirit's upon
[1:33] you and that's the truth I did wrong you
[1:36] pray for me and I'm going to ask God to
[1:39] forgive me so that I can be right with
[1:41] God now you're getting back on the
[1:43] heeing
[1:46] line now God fortified his army what
[1:49] with himself in the form of prophets
[1:53] Apostles teachers pastors what do you do
[1:57] what was God doing listen did you ever
[1:59] think what that offices of the church is
[2:02] it's God's
[2:05] dress inside dress an apostle a prophet
[2:10] a Seer for seeing before Satan never
[2:13] gets to it done told
[2:15] it what is it God dressed up in his
[2:20] church these offices is God's dress wear
[2:24] when you see those offices pastors
[2:26] teachers
[2:27] evangelist what is that that's God's Dr
[2:31] way God's presence God's spirit in
[2:37] working through man and if that office
[2:40] denies any of this word then it's not
[2:42] God dressing amen amen hallelujah that's
[2:46] that wolf and sheep's clothing watch
[2:50] that
[2:51] fell we of him but when he just takes
[2:53] what the word says remember that's God
[2:55] because to speaking his word but it says
[2:58] well it isn't oh get going sheep get
[3:02] going
[3:06] amen God only use his man to work with
[3:09] he doesn't use organizations he doesn't
[3:11] use Machinery he could have done it but
[3:14] he chose a man right he could chose the
[3:17] Stars the wind or anything to preach the
[3:18] gospel but he chose man he does not
[3:21] change himself he always the same God
[3:24] won't leave his program that's the
[3:26] reason we know that this day it's got to
[3:28] be simple amen amen see now he always
[3:32] works in
[3:33] Simplicity yes but God in the beginning
[3:36] that could have made the sun preach the
[3:38] gospel or the winds preach the gospel or
[3:41] an angel preach the gospel but he
[3:43] ordained man for that purpose and he
[3:46] never changes it he never ordained in he
[3:50] never ordained denominations he never
[3:52] ordained groups a man he ordained man to
[3:55] preach the gospel amen not Machinery
[3:58] mechanical devices or any Angelic being
[4:01] it was man and when he brought
[4:03] Deliverance to the people down there he
[4:05] sent a simple human being born of a
[4:09] simple family and a bunch of
[4:12] slaves oh my what a God he is unfolding
[4:17] himself in
[4:20] simplicity
