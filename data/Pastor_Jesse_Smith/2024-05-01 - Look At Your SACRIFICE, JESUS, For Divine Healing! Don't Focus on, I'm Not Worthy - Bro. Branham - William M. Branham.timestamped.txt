[0:06] nothing you done it's what he
[0:08] done amen you keep thinking you're
[0:11] unworthy
[0:12] here what if an old mayor back in the
[0:16] Bible time would give birth to a little
[0:19] cult or had say he had a mule and this
[0:22] mule was born and both ears was flopped
[0:25] down his tail stuff straight up his eyes

[0:33] think it's
[0:34] say boy is me they'll never feed
[0:38] me they just knock me AE when they come
[0:41] out and see me but what if his mother
[0:42] was well instructed in the law she say
[0:44] wait a minute honey wait a minute I know
[0:47] you're a horrible looking creature
[0:49] you're no good but you're going to
[0:52] live because there is a law of God that
[0:56] says you are born under a Birthright
[0:59] that's right
[1:00] you're my
[1:02] first oh

[1:30] take place in the morning when they come
[1:32] out to the pastor to see you you know
[1:34] what they're going to do they are not
[1:36] going to knock you in a head because
[1:38] you're going to live but there's going
[1:40] to have to reach over and get a lamb
[1:42] without a blemish on
[1:44] it amen and they'll take that lamb that
[1:47] don't even have a blemish on it and that
[1:50] lamb will have to die in your stead the
[1:52] priest will never see
[1:54] you amen amen GL do you see it amen

[2:03] sacrifice God don't look at you he looks
[2:05] at your sacrifice CH

[2:12] worthy you're not worthy nobody's worthy
[2:14] but he is the one I'm not counting on
[2:17] what I've done what I am I'll never make
[2:20] it but I'm looking at what he done
[2:23] that's where I'm trusting what he done
[2:25] amen He's My Sacrifice I'm not worthy of
[2:28] healing no sir Lord Heart To Die long I
[2:30] know I've never even been
[2:31] born but I live I got eternal life I'm
[2:34] going to heaven why because he don't for
[2:37] me he took my place I was not NE
[2:41] crosseyed in every kind of condition but
[2:42] he took my place spiritually speaking I
[2:44] was all twisted up and all messed up but
[2:47] he took my place so he makes me a
[2:48] perfect Son of God a perfect daughter of
[2:51] God his sacrifice did it not mine I had
[2:54] nothing to do with it I was born all out
[2:56] of shape anyhow but I I don't trust in
[2:58] what I done I trust in what what he done
[3:01] what he was that's what it was
