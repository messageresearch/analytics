[0:05] that's
[0:07] just been able to read
[0:13] and yes
[0:17] [Music]
[0:32] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:38] this video is to show the 7th and 8th
[0:41] out of 24 Lies coming out of Branham
[0:44] Tabernacle
[0:46] let's review the first six lies the
[0:49] first lies every word on tape is thus
[0:51] saith the Lord and the tapes can never
[0:53] be wrong and the tapes have no mistakes
[0:56] the second lie is all the answers are on
[0:59] the tapes
[1:00] the third lie is unquestionally believe
[1:03] every word on tape is thus say the Lord
[1:05] the fourth lie is a false vision of a
[1:09] denominational mandate for every Church
[1:11] to play the tapes
[1:13] the fifth lie is the tapes are the token
[1:16] and being part of a tape church is the
[1:19] token
[1:20] and the sixth lie is that Tate boys are
[1:22] the true five-fold Ministry and tapes
[1:24] are number one in the fivefold ministry
[1:28] so let's begin with the seventh lie now
[1:30] one of the leaders at voice of God
[1:32] Recordings claimed brother branham's
[1:35] human spirit and soul were identical to
[1:39] Jesus Christ's human spirit and soul
[1:43] this is a gross Heir and I wrote to the
[1:46] individual to try to bring correction
[1:48] but he did not address it and he did not
[1:51] repent let's watch the video so you can
[1:54] see the context in which he made this
[1:57] lie
[1:58] [Applause]
[2:00] out of this blessed book
[2:02] Saul come
[2:04] a man called William Branham
[2:06] he preached like the Bible preach he
[2:09] talked like Jesus he walked like Jesus
[2:11] he lived like Jesus but his name was
[2:14] William Branham the only difference is
[2:16] the Corporal body and anything I don't
[2:18] believe that is a seed of discrepancy
[2:24] so friends as you can see this statement
[2:27] is a lie when you really think about it
[2:29] and take everything back to the word of
[2:31] God as the Bible says prove all things
[2:34] you realize brother Branham was not the
[2:36] same as Jesus Christ in any of his three
[2:40] parts of his being remember first
[2:42] Thessalonians 5 23 says every person has
[2:45] a soul human Spirit or mind and a body
[2:50] now as you just heard this brother said
[2:52] the physical body of Jesus and brother
[2:55] Branham were different of course that's
[2:56] true but then he said the two other
[2:59] Realms of brother Ram's being were
[3:01] identical to Christ
[3:03] and that's a lie
[3:05] Hebrews 4 15 says Jesus was tempted like
[3:09] as we are in all points yet without sin
[3:14] so that means Jesus's human mind never
[3:16] sinned
[3:18] that's different from Brother branham's
[3:19] mind brother Branham said we all sin
[3:22] every day and then he said he makes
[3:25] thousands of mistakes or sins every year
[3:27] as previous videos has showed so it's
[3:30] clear brother random sinned in his mind
[3:32] every single day just as each one of us
[3:34] do so brother Ram's mind cannot be
[3:37] identical to the mind of Jesus Christ
[3:40] because Jesus Christ overcame every
[3:42] Temptation in the mind
[3:44] and committed no sins no sinful thoughts
[3:48] and regarding brother random Soul
[3:50] Brother Ram's Soul like every sinner
[3:52] saved by grace was at one time dead in
[3:54] sins according to Ephesians 2 verse 1
[3:57] and verse 5 which says and you hathy
[4:00] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[4:01] and sins verse 5 even when we were dead
[4:04] in sins hath quickened us together with
[4:06] Christ by Grace ye are saved
[4:09] so friends Jesus's Soul was never dead
[4:11] in sins and trespasses yet the Bible
[4:14] says every one of us were but then
[4:17] thankfully by God's grace Jesus Christ
[4:19] quickened us together with him
[4:22] so friends we can see this is an
[4:24] idolatrous statement to say that brother
[4:25] Brennan was identical to Jesus in his
[4:28] human mind or human spirit and soul
[4:31] this is Prophet worship plain and simple
[4:34] this is the deity spirit trying to
[4:37] worship brother Branham any True
[4:39] Believer will not worship anyone but
[4:42] Jesus Christ
[4:43] now I'm not quite sure but it seems this
[4:46] precious brother is misunderstanding
[4:48] this quote that his father often quoted
[4:51] and here's just one example from an
[4:53] exodus 1956
[4:55] brother Branham says that Jesus Christ
[4:58] is the same yesterday today and forever
[4:59] and that he's the same today in every
[5:02] way except a Corporal body so brother
[5:05] Ram is talking about Jesus the Holy
[5:07] Ghost is here today Jesus spirit is here
[5:09] today and his spirit is the exact same
[5:12] in every manner in power and character
[5:14] and Grace and forgiveness in love but
[5:18] the only difference about Jesus today is
[5:20] that his Corporal body is not here of
[5:22] course his Corporal body is now a
[5:24] glorified body and it sits on Heaven's
[5:26] Throne at the right hand of the Majesty
[5:28] on high so let's listen to the quote
[5:30] from Brother Branham
[5:34] yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13
[5:36] 8. you believe that well then if he is
[5:39] the same he's got to be the same in
[5:41] principle he's got to be the same in
[5:43] power he's got to be the same in every
[5:45] way except for Corporal body is that
[5:47] right
[5:48] or God raised up his Corporal body
[5:50] sitting on the right hand of God and
[5:52] sent down the comforter which is Christ
[5:54] again
[5:57] now friends if this leader at voice of
[5:59] God Recordings can't understand this
[6:01] simple clear quote from Brother Branham
[6:03] that it's about Jesus only and not
[6:06] brother Branham then he should not have
[6:08] a microphone in his hand and he should
[6:10] not speak publicly about the word of God
[6:13] hopefully our brother will repent at
[6:15] some point in the future but that's
[6:17] between him and God
[6:19] the eighth lie is that brother Branham
[6:22] still has a living Ministry and anyone
[6:24] that doesn't believe that is a Demas
[6:28] so Branham tabernacle's leadership uses
[6:31] name calling to accuse anyone who does
[6:34] not believe brother Branham has a living
[6:35] ministry as a Demis character and of
[6:38] course Demas in the Bible is one that
[6:41] forsook the prophet Saint Paul because
[6:44] he loved the present world
[6:47] so Branham tabernacle's leadership is
[6:49] accusing the five-fold ministry that
[6:51] will not play brother Ram's tapes as the
[6:53] number one Ministry of being edemus
[6:56] loving the present World more than they
[6:58] love the word of God and of course
[7:00] that's a lie so first let's listen to
[7:02] the quote from Brenham tabernacle's
[7:04] leadership that states this lie
[7:12] it's just the way that it is
[7:16] [Music]
[7:22] [Music]
[7:34] I know I'm gonna get it for that well
[7:36] that's all right
[7:38] I'm not against nothing
[7:41] [Music]
[8:08] [Music]
[8:15] now friends this lie is easily debunked
[8:17] first we start with Hebrews 13 8 that
[8:20] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[8:22] and forever so if Jesus Christ was the
[8:24] same yesterday or in the past we can go
[8:27] back to the days of Moses and Joshua
[8:29] because Jesus is the same today as he
[8:32] was in the days of Moses and Joshua so
[8:34] what did God do when Moses was ready to
[8:37] die and go off the scene
[8:38] according to numbers 2716 the Bible said
[8:41] let the Lord the god of the spirits of
[8:43] All Flesh set a man over the
[8:45] congregation
[8:47] and then in verse 17 it says which may
[8:49] go out before them and which may go in
[8:51] before them and which may lead them out
[8:54] and which may bring them in that the
[8:56] congregation Lord be not as sheep which
[8:58] have no Shepherd then verse 20 says and
[9:01] thou shalt put some of thine honor upon
[9:03] him that all the congregation of
[9:04] children of Israel may be obedient
[9:07] so Jesus Christ yesterday raised up
[9:10] another man Joshua when his Prophet
[9:13] Moses was going off the scene God didn't
[9:16] tell Joshua Moses is still going to have
[9:18] a live Ministry like Branham Tabernacle
[9:21] is falsely claiming today and of course
[9:23] when we read Joshua 1 verses 1 and 2 the
[9:27] Bible said no after the death of Moses
[9:28] the servant of the Lord it came to pass
[9:30] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[9:32] of nun Moses his Minister saying Moses
[9:34] my servant is dead now therefore arise
[9:37] go over this Jordan thou and all this
[9:39] people unto the land which I do give to
[9:40] them even to the children of Israel
[9:43] notice God did not tell Joshua Moses
[9:46] still has a live Ministry he's still
[9:48] living and you've got to put Moses first
[9:51] and Moses Ministry is number one and
[9:53] your ministry is number two of course
[9:55] that's ridiculous that's not what the
[9:57] Bible says dead men do not have a living
[9:59] Ministry according to Hebrews 13 8
[10:01] numbers 27 and Joshua chapter 1. God has
[10:05] always had living men as the Living
[10:07] Ministries of their days of their Church
[10:10] ages of their time periods that they
[10:12] lived in remember Romans 10 verse 15
[10:15] says how should they preach except they
[10:17] be sent as it is written how beautiful
[10:19] are the feet of them that preach the
[10:20] gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings
[10:23] of good things
[10:24] this proves Living Ministries are made
[10:27] up of living men whose feet travel to
[10:30] preach the gospel
[10:31] we all know brother Branham has passed
[10:33] away his body's in the grave so brother
[10:36] Branham does not have a living Ministry
[10:38] but God knew that that's why he raised
[10:40] up the fivefold ministry after brother
[10:42] Branham passed away and the fivefold
[10:44] ministry will continue the Bible says
[10:46] till we all come in the unity of the
[10:47] faith according to Hebrews chapter 4
[10:49] verses 8 through 16. now let's listen to
[10:52] a quote where brother Branham said you
[10:54] younger ministers have to take our place
[10:56] someday he was speaking of himself and
[10:58] brother Neville brother Ram never said
[11:00] you young ministers have to give me back
[11:02] my Pulpit even after I die like
[11:05] Jeffersonville is saying today which is
[11:06] a bunch of nonsense brother Ram never
[11:09] said Keep Me in the Pulpit after I die
[11:10] keep me number one and all the rest of
[11:13] the fivefold ministry number two or
[11:15] secondary as you listen to this quote
[11:17] from taking sides with Jesus brother Ram
[11:19] said he was grateful for preachers he
[11:22] did not rebuke them for not putting the
[11:23] tapes first even during his lifetime
[11:26] so let's listen to this quote from
[11:27] taking sides with Jesus
[11:39] Christ
[11:41] Sellersburg group and a brother back
[11:44] there that just taken brother snelling's
[11:46] place at Utica and brother Randall up
[11:48] here and brother Junior Jackson and
[11:51] those precious boys who are a fine man
[11:54] wonderful man of God they preached this
[11:57] message now they made one might disagree
[12:01] just literally I own something and other
[12:03] that's only human amongst the group of
[12:05] the ministers yet
[12:14] the rest of you brother God richly bless
[12:19] you
[12:20] you're a young man I'm getting old but
[12:22] Neville's getting old we're middle-aged
[12:25] man
[12:25] time rolls on we're gonna walk off the
[12:28] scene that's why you've got to fill our
[12:30] shoes
[12:31] man
[12:32] and so you seeing that maybe in that day
[12:35] even if we grow greater if there is a
[12:38] tomorrow
[12:40] now friends also remember quotes from
[12:42] the previous videos brother Ram said
[12:44] don't change a thing regarding the
[12:46] Evangelical preaching Ministry and yet
[12:48] Branham Tabernacle has changed almost
[12:50] everything about the fivefold ministry
[12:52] and brother Branham said he was right
[12:54] behind the preachers he told them to
[12:56] keep preaching just as hard as they can
[12:58] so those of us in the fivefold ministry
[13:00] we know if brother bran was here he'd be
[13:02] right behind us because that's the Bible
[13:04] pattern that Jesus Christ is the same
[13:06] yesterday today and forever The Only
[13:09] Living Ministries are the men who are
[13:11] still alive today
[13:12] and friends are probably familiar with
[13:13] these quotes from birth pains 1965.
[13:16] brother random said these men if they
[13:18] pick up this and goes out with it they
[13:20] can make more sense to it see to bring
[13:22] it to a place you would I just want to
[13:24] lay this seed then hope they make it
[13:26] come to life notice C
[13:28] also in things that are to be 1965
[13:30] brother random said the inspiration it's
[13:33] give to young man like your pastor here
[13:35] that's caused them as I'm beginning to
[13:37] get old and know that my days are
[13:39] numbered and know now that these young
[13:40] men can take this message and sweep it
[13:43] on to the coming of the Lord if he
[13:44] doesn't come in my generation
[13:46] and then he said in Divine Healing 1954
[13:49] when my days is finished and I've done
[13:51] my best if I be God's servant God will
[13:53] raise him up another man in that day
[13:56] when I'm gone so there's no need of me
[13:58] setting something around my theology is
[14:01] me to live in what light I have and wait
[14:03] till on God for the Next Generation to
[14:05] come he will have a man there when that
[14:08] generation comes up amen end quote
[14:11] and notice after brother Graham died
[14:12] brother Orman Neville was there to keep
[14:15] preaching just as brother am said in
[14:17] 1954.
[14:18] so friends who is the real Demas of this
[14:21] time fivefold preachers have been name
[14:23] called Demas by the leadership at
[14:25] Branham Tabernacle but who is the real
[14:27] Demas
[14:28] who is the real demon that has left
[14:30] Paul's gospel as recorded in the New
[14:32] Testament who has gotten rich off the
[14:34] gospel having loved the present World
[14:37] who's rich with millions of dollars in
[14:39] assets for preaching very little and not
[14:43] even weekly gathering with Saints though
[14:46] the Bible says we should gather more as
[14:47] we see that day approaching
[14:49] who is the one not saying what Saint
[14:51] Paul said of course that's the
[14:53] leadership at Branham Tabernacle
[14:55] brother Branham said a true Prophet
[14:57] would not change one iota of Paul's
[15:00] gospel yet Branham Tabernacle leadership
[15:02] has injected Tate boys into Joshua
[15:05] chapter 2 in Ephesians 4 verse 11 and
[15:08] they've injected these other 23 lies
[15:10] into their teachings so we can clearly
[15:13] see who is the modern day Demus today
[15:15] Demas left the prophet Paul for the
[15:18] present world and friends we who love
[15:20] the Bible are the ones staying with
[15:21] brother branham's words while overcoming
[15:24] the wicked one in this present World
[15:26] Brenham Tabernacle and vog are the ones
[15:29] leaving brother random's instructions on
[15:31] tape in this present World remember in
[15:34] the church age book brother random said
[15:36] anyone not saying what Saint Paul said
[15:38] in the Bible is false therefore the
[15:40] Branham Tabernacle leadership is under a
[15:42] false anointing
[15:44] Paul never said Tate boys are the true
[15:46] five-fold Ministry Paul never said dead
[15:49] prophets are number one in the fivefold
[15:51] ministry and the rest are secondary
[15:53] let's listen to the quote from the
[15:55] Ephesian Church age chapter 3 in the
[15:57] church age book
[16:00] s
[16:03] we're full of the Holy Ghost by the
[16:05] laying on of Paul's hands
[16:07] they look those false Apostles in the
[16:09] eye and said
[16:10] you are not saying what Paul said you
[16:13] are therefore false
[16:15] oh that sets my heart on fire get back
[16:18] to the word it is not you that really
[16:21] tries the Apostle and prophet and
[16:23] teacher it is the word that tries them
[16:25] one of these days there is going to come
[16:28] a prophet to the laodicean church age
[16:30] and you will know if he is the real one
[16:32] sent from God or not yes you will for if
[16:36] he is of God he will be in that word
[16:38] exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't
[16:41] deviate from that word for a moment not
[16:43] by one iota
[16:46] in closing
[16:48] friends I hope this video has been a
[16:50] blessing as we continue this series
[16:51] friends all these things are spoken in
[16:54] broadly kindness in hopes Brenham
[16:57] Tabernacle leadership and his followers
[16:58] will repent I don't know who will
[17:01] but if even one repents as the Bible
[17:04] says we just want to save Souls from a
[17:06] multitude of sin and here we see over 24
[17:09] lies or sins against the true Revelation
[17:12] that Jesus Christ gave to Saint Paul and
[17:14] then restored through his Prophet
[17:15] brother Branham so let's pray for those
[17:17] in the Branham Tabernacle Ministry and
[17:19] those being influenced by its false
[17:21] influence all around the world
[17:24] father God we come again in the name of
[17:26] the Lord Jesus Christ and we ask God
[17:27] that you have mercy upon this false
[17:29] movement
[17:30] may you send these truths Lord to those
[17:32] that will receive it that they may be
[17:34] set free out of the bondage of the lies
[17:37] of false Doctrine May the Holy Spirit
[17:39] convict them and may they receive the
[17:41] truth and may they come out of her my
[17:43] people may they come out of the false
[17:45] tape Church movement repent of their
[17:48] sins and Trust Jesus Christ alone for
[17:51] salvation for justification
[17:53] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[17:55] Ghost and the rapture we thank you Lord
[17:57] that your truth will prevail and all
[18:00] that the father has given me will come
[18:01] to me and you will not lose any we ask
[18:04] all these things in Jesus Christ's name
[18:06] amen
[18:09] if you have any questions concerns or
[18:10] testimonies about this video please
[18:12] contact me
[18:14] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[18:17] the desire of your heart
