let's go to acts chapter 17 like to continue on this uh series on prove all things be looking at the debate we did a couple weeks ago as well a lot of these are really good questions and really good scriptural bible studies we'll try to just condense them today by the grace of the lord acts 17 10 and 11 acts 17 10 and 11. lord willing tonight we'll look at uh just a bible study on angels but amen had some good questions about that so did some of the kids so i thought tonight we could go over that and uh look at a second bible study on angels by god's grace so let's uh read x 17 10 11. so i want to open up a few notes here real quick another questions here we had acts 17 11 10 and 11. let's read 10 and 11 together one two three and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so let's have one more word of prayer if ever need on your heart let's make it known unto god heavenly father lord we we see through this word lord god how the the conditions of the the apostles they had to leave by night they couldn't travel during the day there was such persecution lord god so father we're grateful that we have the liberty by day to preach your word to sing songs loud loudly lord as you commanded lord in the scripture to raise our voices lift our voices and play loudly lord and sing your praises lord god hallelujah we thank you lord for this opportunity and father let us have readiness of mind like these saints lord in berea that search the scriptures daily to make sure the prophet paul what he said was scriptural god may we have that kind of hunger and thirst but we have that kind of sincerity as our brother saying lord let us make room for you lord god in our minds and lord in our souls lord jesus may we make room for you today father because you're the most important one lord you're the most important thing and subject topic person of this day today lord and everyday lord god we love you we worship you anoint me anoint your people lord to hear and listen receive and believe lord in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god all right so let's uh look at some scriptures here i think i do have some slides here today by god's grace yesterday i got a call from brother dennis mcbride like i told you and he his whole purpose for calling me was to thank me for doing the debate he said he watched the whole thing and he said he was like debating out loud the whole time during the debate i thought yeah bro that's good i said he might be the next one to debate but uh um you know i got numerous emails also this week from different people even people against brother branham that said they thought my arguments won the debate and again church i'm not it don't matter who wins but what is true the word of god wins right the word of god is the standard it is the truth and is the word uh is the word of god it's forever settled in heaven and so just you know as we're as we're going through this you know just try to have an open heart mind how many want to grow in grace of the knowledge of the lord so church i'll just be honest it is through these debates that i've really grown because as i told the brother uh which one of you would have been ready to to debate brother rod bergen you know uh i wasn't ready for years uh but it was through these questions that it caused us to grow right because usually do we do we like questions wendy stick your head around i don't either i like to know all the answers i know i don't know all the answers but i like to know all the answers and so this is an area where you know this is uh you know with these people rising up and like the bible said there must come a great falling away first right and we know that's you know from the nomination but also from those around the word of the hour and so since they've fallen away this has really caused me to grow it's really challenged me uh to look into situations and i thought now how does i've done exactly what this bible says take what brother ram said and see if that's scriptural and if it is hallelujah if it isn't i'll say well that was his own opinion which he said many times it could just be my opinion right he never said i am the absolute above the bible he never said i'm equal to the bible he said jesus christ is the absolute and he prayed he point us that the the people would look to jesus christ as the absolute that's on the video that i made about the absolute but there's all kinds of quotes on that but i want to uh just look at this every day every day they would spend time and they're they take time out of their daily schedule right and they would hear they would examine what did paul say yesterday now they must have been taking those churches or else they had really good memories which sometimes i don't have a very good memory but they must have pretty good memories that they could remember what paul said in the synagogue on the saturday and then well i'll say like this they did it every day right the bible said every day so they would go after the synagogue they'd go home and read their bible that night and the church said right i don't always do that but what i'll do is i'll listen to songs like amen will sing songs and then i'll go home and while i'm washing dishes i'll listen to those songs because i want i want that joy to stay with me i just preach my heart out for three hours you know if i preach two one and a half hour sermons so i i'm really not in the mood to receive the word but some some sundays i do like i think a couple sundays ago i listened to brother tim pruitt's sermon while i wash dishes on the sunday night after even after preaching three hours i just love it you know i just love it but many times i'll just sing because i'm all like preached out you know uh but look at this is this how this is how we should act with brother branham and with preachers right with preaching the fightful ministry we should take everything they say back to the word of god and is this so or not if not we'll just forget about it and let's really trust in what we know is the word of god because men are going to have their opinions right there was a saying with amen after jesus died there's a saying john is not going to see death he's going to live to the rapture and my they could have they could have tried to find some scriptures but there would have been none right and that's what we have today people are people are uh so enthused about conversations of brother marin i mean stories of brother brown which is that's fine but we got to be dedicated to the word of god that brother branham pointed us to we've got a it's okay to think about that you know was billy paul is he really going to be alive you know when california falls in that's okay to think about but that's not thus saith the lord that's not even on the tapes praise god you know those are just things that we we hear but we have like the bible if we're really noble if we're really kings unto god if we're really priests unto god we've got to take everything we hear back to the word of god amen if not then we're backslidden right we're not in the spiritual state we should be because this is what a ready mind is and that's why i put my laptop up here i want to look up that word readiness because i didn't get a chance to do it this morning readiness of mind remember what was paul's letter uh to philippians all about the mind right one accord ready mind that he knew they were born again their soul he said you've got to get your mind in one accord so readiness of minds means zeal a zealous mind praise god they searched the scriptures because they had a zealous mind they were always thinking about the things of god it means eagerness with eagerness of mine i'm eager now look at that church i'm eager to go read my bible after i heard the prophet of god preach amen my goodness i listened to this week i listened to communion from brother branham twice it's a very short one because it's just a communion service but it made me go back to my bible and i'll show you why in a little bit for good reasons but also he just had a human error in there as well he said he said uh yeah he said yeah so we'll get to that one a little bit here so no it's that notice it's also an inclination you're so you're inclined or you're moved in your mind to go search the scriptures whether they be so and brother uh dennis was saying he said yesterday he said how you know how could you be prepared for all those things i said brother i said the reason i was prepared because god left me alone this little old church i haven't traveled anywhere and it's forced me to just study the bible right i haven't got many invitations which is okay i don't need them i got an invitation to preach here you invited me to breach every sunday so i got my lifetime invitation until you all vote me out i hope you don't unless i deserve it but uh if i told him i said the only way i could have those answers to rod was if i wrote that book especially the first question about deuteronomy 22 5. now how could i write the book i had to study it out i did take one brother if brother adam said women shouldn't wear pants i got to take that back to the word how do i prove that by the word and i had a good answer for him and he didn't say anything about it he didn't say nothing they just avoid it they just say oh you're under the law you're the law but what about all these scriptures right we'll get to that a little bit but he said that's what he noticed uh and he said how could you come up with all those things i said brother i've just been sitting there all by myself in my little office over there studying with the lord and we're just our humble little church enjoying our fellowship and one accord and god through these years gives us the answers to the devil's questions but how does it come by searching the scriptures search the scriptures daily whether those things are so you read your bible today if not i hope you do tonight i was searching into i was reading it this morning good stories about uh rehoboam and jeroboam amazing now look here's a thought that came to me this morning or was it yesterday did you know the bible said god was going to rent the kingdom from solomon did you know the bible said that but he said because of your father david i won't do it while you're alive now that is some harsh language church you have been so unfaithful i'm going to take it from you let's that's the same language as saul remember and i just read that i think that was yesterday but i read about jeroboam and rehoboam today solomon did such evil things at the end of his life right because he was old he got tired and he built up all those uh pagan houses of worship that god said i'm going to take it from you but i'm going to have mercy on you because of david now what about the blessings from generation to generation amen church let's live let's live our lives so if there is another generation god will bless our children praise god and hopefully they don't backslide hopefully they stay as true as we are if not more dedicated to christ amen hallelujah amen look at that because of david's faithfulness god let solomon not experience having the kingdom taken away during his lifetime but as soon as he died that happened right jeroboam came back from egypt he was conveniently in egypt so solomon wouldn't kill him and he come back and and asked ray bone raybone please ease up some of our burdens your dad placed on us and he said let me talk to the old guys they said yeah let me talk to the young guys no make it harder and he said my little finger will be thicker than my father's loins and the bible said they said fine we don't want nothing with david anymore look at the look at the foolishness in that give the people a break right give the people a break now that was physical work right the bible says with us we should gather more as we see that day approaching praise god amen and so you see it's very harsh language upon solomon because you know here's why i believe at church because to whom much is given much is required no man was smarter brother johnny no man had more money than that man he had the greatest kingdom there ever was he had a he had a throne it was made of ivory the bible said think about ivory tusks from those animals right rhinoceros his whole throne was made of ivory by amen with six steps plated with gold and i think there were six uh lions on each side with 12 lines no one had ever seen anything like this he was so smart and so he had every resource he had every spiritual resource and physical resource but he surrendered to the love of women and the love of their gods instead of being dedicated to christ church even if god blesses us we should remain more faithful to god amen that's what i've done god's given me more money i i give way over 10 or 11 percent than my 10 percent some people i know understand if you can only get by giving 10 that's fine i get way over it because he's blessed me so much how can i not give back to him more praise god because i and i preach it i don't want to get in the attitude of just 10 just a 10 or just 10 and a half i don't want to get in that selfish attitude i want to always be a cheerful giver because that's the kind god loves amen i don't know why i'm on that anyway that wasn't in my notes for today but this zeal see church we got it brother branson never lose your enthusiasm for the message that's that's what he means studying your bible praise god listen to what brother abraham said or listen to my sermon again be careful how many people you listen to because the more voices the more confusion that's why jesus said my sheep know my voice right that's why he places as sheep you can't if you hear too many voices you got too many ideas and god doesn't like that praise god now okay i wonder where that was okay thank you so it's it's plainly scriptural there that uh here we prove all things and we got to take everything back to the word of god everything and always know this church always remember there's majors and minors satan loves to make minors majors and that's when people will split churches and now it's different if there's a real sin in someone's church that's different if there's a real sin and it's not dealt with that's different but satan loves to make minors into majors right he does it all the time and so we've got to be careful what we make majors and minors and here and you know i've said it before i'm going to say it again but our day is different than any other day because our prophet had thousands and thousands of visions and we have more recorded times where he's talking than than this bible gives us of any other prophet so we have to be that much more careful to make sure we don't make something thus saith the lord or unconditional that might be conditional right we weren't there but amen we weren't there when god told abraham uh leave your leave your family and all these things and he obeyed the visions we weren't there years later when he lied to the king so was he credible or not yeah he was credible but he was fallible and then isaac did it twice later just like his daddy a prophet of god lied in fear in church we got to be careful the bible said the fearful will not inherit the kingdom of god so see we got to be one and that struck me with that coronavirus that struck me most people aren't going to get it right most people aren't going to be around it but it's the fear of it that satan is trying to grip over the people and there's people that look think about this there's people that have stopped going to church just because of fear and they're stopped hearing the word they backslide they get out of the bat good habits of the word and look they could not inherit the kingdom of god all because of fear right because they feed too much on the media they feed you much on on politics and things like that rather than feeding on the life-giving resource of god's word amen the fearful will not inherit the kingdom of god amen oh it's such an important thing church to be in tune and read your bible every day praise god noble that speaks of kingship right and royalty the royal seat of abraham amen the royal seed of abraham is in the word daily praise god now just so you know at this stage in my life i don't listen to brother ram every single day i don't because i'm in the process of writing and researching all the things brother random taught that i've been preaching for 16 years i used to when i was just teaching one topic at a time i don't know if you guys bang i don't know if you remember when i preached the seven seals or the church ages i had slide after slide i was in that thing every single day and night because i want to make sure i had the right revelation so right now this at this time i'm writing i'm almost done with this book uh by god's grace the rough draft's all done i'm just waiting to hear back all the edits so i don't listen to brother man every day now but i believe there will come a time when i do it again okay but i do i am in god's word every day praise god amen and so but everything i'm writing and researching are the revelations brother and brought that i already been preaching and believing for all these years so see if you're not listening to brother branham make time to do it right but make sure every day you're searching the scriptures praise god every day make sure you're searching the scriptures i know people making a law in their church if you don't listen to brother branham you're backstage that's not true because i know a lot of people that listen to brother braham every day and they are backslidden and they are and they worship devil and they worship brother branham so see you've got to find the bounce and thank god the holy spirit brings us the balance praise god amen amen that's right they can quote it better than you but they worship the man that's from hell praise god you see we got to find the bells now so i didn't got to my slides okay now real quick part 11. i just want to review real quick if you didn't see two wednesdays ago i showed in the bible how debate is actually scriptural as long as you got the right spirit paul ever is his custom was every sabbath to go debate and reason in the synagogues and there's many quotes brother brahm said the holy spirit sent him to a debate him against the 400 ministers brother branham said the holy spirit sent me to that debate he wasn't going to go he said but he said the holy spirit said don't fear i'll be with you i love those words do not fear that's what angels always say do not fear that's the angel's first message usually don't fear i'm with you praise god um but anyways i wanted to follow up with this remember the last sermon i preached in august the brothers dreams uh somebody's of god brother now i put a reminder on my phone on the last sunday of september to revisit that so hat was september on the same level as march and june johnny and i were talking about this amen and i ever talked about this i personally don't think it was so personally at least at this point i think his dream failed that's just my opinion at this point because church in march something happened that never happened before 20 million people lost their jobs and the coronavirus shut down almost our entire nation right at least the schools and restaurants right and sports that had never happened before if that was one two three knock now june was incredible as well over two billion dollars this is just what they've assessed that's an estimate two billion dollars in insurance claims from all the riots in june and september's had some riots and things but nothing like that nothing like that in fact all the ones i've been watching them too every time there was there was national guard there or they were on they were ready to go and to squelch those evil riders so i watch it now the only thing i would say for this month that could have been three knocks would have been those california fires because they were the worst in history but i just remember a few years ago they had the worst in history a few years ago so i don't know i just at this point unless there's some major thing tomorrow let's see wednesday's october 1st to me september has not been on the level like march and june was that's just my opinion so i just want to follow up with everybody on that and boy that really led off the pressure by the man because you know i'm human i don't want to miss it sister wendy i want to be ready if it's coming november i don't want to miss it if it's coming november i want to be ready last november right you understand i i don't want to i don't want there to be any question like barbara said i don't want any trouble at the river praise god i'm going to be ready well in advance praise god i've had to run the planes before and not miss him i hate that i think you don't like that either right i want to be the first one on i don't want there to be any any question am i going to make this flight or not and jesus has given us a ticket he's given us a seal the baptism the holy ghost and i want to have it now praise god amen we can all everybody can have it now he said anyone that's thirsty can drink of the living waters amen so we can know that we're ready praise god so that's just a thought that's my thought i'm not prophesying of course i'm not a prophet um but it just doesn't seem like september has been on the same level i could be wrong now let's uh i won't get through all these of course today i want to update you on this uh now the reason behind the church and i calculated there's been over three thousand views on the the video debates there's been over three thousand views so that's that's a small number compared to like the world but um anyways lots of people are are listening and that's encouraging um and i hope it's setting people free praise god i hope it's setting people free like i said i have different people emailing me texting me saying and then leaving voicemails saying it's helping them out and it's defending the faith praise god uh but i want to keep on this because and the reason is because we may do a future debate and also so you and i have the answers because you're going to have questions right you you either you're going to have the questions or people will bring the questions to you remember this is a short series i've only preached 12 sermons on prove all things hasn't been like i've been pulling this on for five years preaching on the same thing and this is all like i said this is all challenging things to me things i'm learning and it's helping me rightly divide the word of god okay so uh let's look here now my next thought uh so yeah let me summarize the debate questions here and then i'll look at there were so many unaddressed accusations in other words there were so many things our brother rod said now i call him brother somebody rebuked me on the youtube this week and said how can you call the man a brother how can you not he served in the message for 40 years he was a song leader for 40 years has he said harsh words yeah but have you ever said harsh words against somebody probably i have one time i spoke bad out in iowa cam and i were just talking i'd say cam please forgive me again i don't need to say that i get that we're talking about some other brother i said please that really sounded bad right um and jesus had the greatest expression of love what do you say father condemn them they don't know what they're doing he said forgive them and if he can forgive people spitting on him mocking him whipping him if he can forgive those kind of people what should we do if we got the holy ghost and i told the brother i said do you know do you know his eternal destination do you know it i don't do i believe he could come back or i do that's why i did it because it's my love my love drove me to try to help my brother because the bible said if you see your brother overtaking a fault mock him make fun of him and blaspheme them is that what we should do now the bible said go to him in the spirit of meekness see we don't we'll all be better we'll be better in our church if when people leave we try to call them back in love right as long as they're welcome back some people are not welcome back we still love them so it's uh i don't know the man's destination so i'm gonna keep calling brother because i know this if i'm salty he'll get thirsty if i'm salty if i'm the salt of the earth now look at that church if you're the salt of the earth in other words no one's going to be as salty and as wonderful to be around than you and i is that right you're the salt not of the country although i believe you are but you're the salt of the earth you give flavor you you give it meaning right it's not bland it's not dull you give substance to humanity people should want to be around you people should want to listen to you people should want to talk to you people should want you to pray for them praise god because you're the salt of the earth like yesterday i was talking to those brothers leo and stuart and i went over and said no no he just reached out he called at me he said are you a preacher i said yeah how did you know he said you just act like one i thought really i thought well what preachers does he know hope i don't act like them too much he said but you carry yourself like a preacher i don't know what that means but i just thought that was great that he looked at me and he saw he said that's the man of god he said so i hope that's me being salty i mean offered to push his daughter on the swings you know and i was trying real gentle with her and if anybody should be salty it should be us if anybody should make somebody uh want to be like them it should be us praise god i want to be like them oh if i'd only be like them all right if i had the patience like them amen if i had to love like them that should be us praise god because we have the love of jesus christ so uh let me look at my opening statement i'm in church i am going to go quickly through these uh what i did is i just did a uh a note for each one so my opening statement was i i basically said i'm nothing without him john 15 5. i said if i don't have an answer forgive me and then i define the message the message is not every word brother branham said brother man said the message is the scriptures god is vindicating right now that's what he said in rapture 65. okay so i labored on that and i said we have to rightly divide everything brother ram said because that's his humanity we don't exalt everything he says as thus saith the lord and i went to brother m's restoration ministry uh how he restored the mysteries and the gospel and then i showed how all history said he spearheaded the revival i said but yet god hides himself from the eyes of the lies and prudent and then i ended it by saying what the message has done for me it's delivered me from all my sins because i said i know what it's like to be in a church with the anointing sister sarah every sunday somebody spoke in tongues at our church by johnny every it was clockwork and people were weeping and crying and many people were getting closer to god so i i was used to the anointing it's that sacredness my man said it's that sacred feeling that you have and we uh almost automatically you bow your head unless you were like really backslidden and hard-hearted right but it would always bow our heads and i'd always look from the corner of my eye i can see that sister hazel was her name she said yeah she'd say i'm not you know she'd speak in tongues and one brother named ray in the back would always uh interpret but there would be different ones that would prophesy from different times of times but i would so i told them i said i was raised in a church that knew the anointing that new miracles but they didn't have the life of christ they the church we all love the anointing thank god for the anointing thank god for the rain but the rain only shows what life is inside of it amen glory so i could see this rain is given a weird light a strange life that ain't the life like i remember when they my dad would say it too i remember when the church condemned people watching movies like honey i shrunk the kids do you remember that movie though johnny we went to the drive-through to see it and then the preaching was condemning it you know but then a few years later it was okay to watch movies and we had sunday night preaching every sunday night man that preacher he my pastor preached twice but then by the end they had like uh well then it moved to bible studies and then they didn't have the services anymore just got rid of the services because people weren't coming well that's not the reason to throw in the towel that's the reason to keep going praise god amen if less people come that's the just keep going praise god somebody will come back praise god amen the people that really love god they'll come back and if not then you've just got more time with jesus praise god amen because it's another chance to be in his divine presence because he promised he said weber two or three there i am in the midst so i've seen it come in like that my mom saw it my mom saw it and she said they all they never they hated rock and roll in the assemblies of god in this in the 50s when it came in my mom was born in 1950. she saw them against rock and roll and she said slowly and i have all the pictures my mom had uh now she had a short short skirt on in the 60s but they all had long hair all the women had long hair and all had skirts on go to the 70s now they're all wearing pants and then my mom said in the year 2000 she went to their youth conference and instead of playing christian worship they had rock and roll and hip hop and the teens are dancing to rock and roll that fulfills brother brandon's vision doesn't it i saw the church dancing to rock and roll right smoking cutting their hair uh all i mean that's what the church of america was and my mom has had the i say privilege to see that firsthand but we've had the privilege to come out of it praise god amen we've had the privilege to be one of those other groups onward christian soldiers amen the bride who is just like the original one praise god amen hallelujah amen we have the privilege to be one of the originals look just like they did at the beginning praise god thank you jesus so i ended up with that now his opening statement i think i just summarized so he went he said 40 year history in the message it was a uh it was a child abuse thing that uh scandal in the church that caused him to leave the church and question the message and it was never taken to the law uh i don't see much about that because i wasn't there but anyways they said the first thing he found was kenneth hagin who this is a pentecostal preacher who is a prosperity preacher and he taught the holy laugh anointing like you get a whole when you get the anointing you do a holy laugh which is nowhere in the scripture so they said they found a prophecy where kenneth hagin said before brother ram died he was going to die in 65 because of his disobedience i doubt that highly i haven't searched that one out but i doubt that highly and look now he's putting confidence in this prosperity preacher above a man imagine this marina turned away a check for one million five hundred thousand but this man's like send me your money oh you're gonna believe him okay that's fine go ahead i'm not gonna do that and i haven't searched it out yet but here's what i want to search out in regards to this uh our precious brother rod i don't know if you watch this or not if i want to be careful i always want to be loving and kind but i'm kind of under this zealous anointing right now usually when i preach uh and then but like brother said then it leaves but i wonder if rod is giving hagen the same treatment he gave brother branham because brother rod condemns brother branham for sharing testimonies that were not recorded before the fact so my question is does haggins was hagen's prophecy can you prove it was recorded before the fact because if not now you're contradicting your own your own beliefs oh i don't i don't believe any uh prophecies unless they were clearly proven uh to be prophesied before they came to pass so my question is were you there when kenneth hagin said that prophecy no he wants it so that's see that's one thing i found out about the devil everything he accuses he's guilty of you see with the democrats today don't you everything uh now some republicans do right you shouldn't say just democrats some republicans too the very thing they accuse the other side of is the same thing they're doing right we saw this week with the justice passing away they said you never fill an empty seat in the election year and then they take it back to 2016 and the and the same people are saying we have to fill it in the election year if i haven't seen it that you know what i mean that's hypocrisy now it's different if they would come out and said i'm sorry i made that statement i didn't know better but they never they never apologized for nothing there's no humility to say i was wrong not church if i'm wrong i want to say i'm wrong i want to say jesus forgive me i made a mistake or saints i've grown in my understanding of that when i preached that back then god has shown me greater truth so forgive me i didn't mean to preach that but see you never see that from them now and then he went into all these stories were false you know brother graham his pentecostal church and his first meeting with the pentecost was a man from windsor he accused the random of plagiarism and he looked at me and he said jesse how can a teacher like you uh you want to accept plagiarism in your classroom but you'd accept plagiarism from your prophet and i thought oh you smart guy you i see that i want to address it and i want to say brother branham never even said the word plagiarized i don't even know brother brandon knew what plagiarism was plagiarism is when you take somebody else's work and claim it's yours brother ram never claimed some of those things but man never said i never got anything from larkin it was all he never said that he just didn't know about works cited or a reference page right like when i when i studied the church age book recently this summer i said i read uh i read almost all the church i booked this summer when i was writing the seventh chapter for this book brother random uh and lee vale put all these quotes brother ram used when he preached the sermons but there's no references so i had to go back in the message software and find which historical books was it the nicean fathers or was it another history book i had to go find the references so he put quotes around some of them but he didn't he didn't reference it like you would expect a scholarly paper that's because brother branham was not a scholar and that doesn't offend me he was a prophet amen he was a prophet not a scholar he was a prophet of god amen amen paul was more scholarly but amen that's why paul will when he'll quote old testament scriptures amen and he'll say when isaiah said or when hosea said or when jeremiah said why because he was a prophet he was a former scholar he's still ability but brotherhood wasn't a scholar he was just a rough prophet who saw missions all the time he prayed for the sick saw mighty miracles and he was elijah amen he was a fierce prophet like a ij man who stood there was stood against the word of god he wasn't a he wasn't a scholar the church listens testimony sometimes if you receive just say a hundred letters with prayer requests in a week how could you do anything else i had a sister i asked wendy and sarah mail out 40 letters in one week was it time consuming or was it not sarah told me it was time consuming did you have much time for anything else that week sisters anything fun you want to do that week that you that's just 40. and they didn't even write the letter brother ram had to type it on himself and the church said and there's quotes where they remember he he said i've got a thousand letters a week huh you see they're condemning brother branham for things he wasn't even a scholar they don't they're condemning without even knowing what he went through in other words they're so many of them are so prideful they don't even try to put themselves in somebody else's shoes and to try to see the other side brother graham called that brotherly kindness right he said put yourself in somebody else's shoes on the matter oh how can brother man forget all these details i forget things all the time my stories sometimes don't line up my wife always corrects me on my my wife my wife my mom's healing of cancer was it the lung or the liver it's liver i'll get it right one of these days i always say lung i don't know why let's see brother man didn't have time can you imagine trying to and then what about all the calls he said our phone rings non-stop and his wife mead had to answer and write down the prayer request billy can you go out who these people never lived this kind of life and then on top of that then he's in and out of visions like listen to brother biscuits testimony he would just stop talking with you and just sit there silent and just stare up at the at the sky and see missions and then after a thousand of those you expect him to remember every single detail about that i don't in fact i admire the man for doing all that he did because it's way more than i ever did he's prayed for way more sick people than i ever will be with johnny he's humbled himself and and answered and sent out more prayer cloths than i'll ever send out but see just a little just a little brother kindness goes a long way amen and they he said uh brother i'm so discord so instead of unity there's uh disunity he blames that on brother branham i blame that on the devil on the devil and then people not getting born again because if you got born again the gates of hell don't prevail against you so it's a dual responsibility right satan's responsible for it but also the people that don't get born again you can't just put it all on brother brandon brother ram was trying to unite people right like when when they write brother adam's questions he said ask your pastor that's unity you know this million men when brother would go into services on a sunday and he would have campaign meetings he would never have it in the morning or evening he'd always have an afternoon between services so he didn't take people away from their home church did you know that i'll just show you the quotes on that he would never pull people away from their home church brother branham brought unity to the gospel not division unity there's many quotes on it i wish i had him here but that wasn't in my notes then he said oh brother man it's not credible and we are all caught people mercy this is the freest call i've ever had ever heard of i don't tell you what to do every day i don't i don't even text you maybe once a week right a call a call is when they exalt one person and everything is uh everything is ordered by that one person right and it's it's a it's a damaging thing not a good thing now god's system yeah we do have one person over everybody that's jesus christ amen praise god and then for the church yes there is one man one singular man who brought the revelation and then it goes out to the rest but that man's not the same as jesus so we don't worship that man and we don't take every word martin luther said as thus saith the lord because he said some awful things just read his just read his writing sometime he said some really harsh things but you know so have i i'll be honest so if i i've said some harsh things i shouldn't have said so um my fir his first question for me was how do you support the king james version only uh knowing erasmus was a roman catholic so he's trying to get me on you don't like catholics i love catholics in fact i love that woman that trump nominated for the supreme court because she's married she lives looks like she lives a pretty simple life it's better than a liberal democrat mayor or judge you know and she goes to a pentecostal church a catholic pentecostal church that speaks in tongues that's good that's good because there's somebody in there but the man said god has children in every one of those so if you don't believe that that's fine but i believe what brother man said in that case because i know there's a foolish virgin group who's the bible said multitudes right he's going to separate the multitude on the right hand and left i know there's a multitude group that's going to be saved they didn't know who the bride was but they did good to the bride amen and jesus said when you did to them you did it to me praise god the least of my brethren now seemed like i was going to say something else but i can't i love the roman catholic people i hate the system you and i hate this system so i'm just going to summarize these i'm going to go quick here i told him i'm no scholar and i haven't been led to the lord to study this topic very deeply so i'm led lord to study other things it's a good thing i did to prepare for this debate but i said king james only because it's a great danger to add or take anything away from the word of god and i said in every version i've read every one of them takes something away and the bible said every word of god is pure add thou not unto his words lest thou be found a liar i don't want jesus to call me a liar i want jesus to say well done servant you told the truth and i said and i put up all these good quotes on erasmus he might not church he lived in the fourth church age so that was the darkest age of all but he was trying to get the people his whole life was spent he might just be amen he spent his whole life at a desk you know he would do other things too but his main goal was to copy the bible to get it in english for the people in other words he lived for everybody else praise god he didn't live for himself and eventually it was his writings that let martin luther uh interpret the bible in english as well and william tyndale and all these other men without erasmus work even he's a roman catholic there would have been no king james bible praise god i don't know if he was saved or not i don't know what he believed but we know that was the time the bible said they had to overcome the depths of satan so it seemed like erasmus was trying to overcome the depths of satan he was trying to get the word of god to god's people let me read your erasmus quote you've maybe heard it before he said i wish that even the weakest woman might read the gospels and the epistles of saint paul i long for the day when the husbandman shall sing portions of them to himself as he follows the plow amen hallelujah others i long for the day when wendy can sit at her job and do the printing and sing the songs to god that come right from the bible praise god amen it's not like putting people in the sermons you know kind of wakes them up a little bit wakes me up too when people call me out too but i long for the day when amen can sing unto the lord sing unto the lord psalm 98 when he can sing that while he's operating the machine i lost that's what he longed for his whole life was dedicated that sister naomi i've got to get the people the word of god this is my whole purpose in life thank god he knew it praise god thank god he didn't waste his life away and something else but he gave his life for other people showing he had eternal life amen glory now his argument was okay his argument was this and i preached on this a couple years ago maybe last year all the new bible versions have different scrolls okay they were found in the 1800s so his argument was well all the new versions have older scrolls that doesn't mean the scrolls we used weren't the right scrolls the reason our original scrolls were older is because the other ones wore out because they were getting used so much so they had to make new copies right but then their new scrolls have additions or deletions from the texas receptors okay so that's the point i made i just i even said this i left it open-ended i said well if god brings out a better version of the king james here i am show me lord i said i don't know how he'll do it but if he did do that i'd be ready to receive it but i don't believe it at least at this point and i said the reason i believe it is because it was prophesied who was it was it tyndale yeah william tyndale was burning at the stake he was a man that got a hold of uh erasmus writings 100 years later so and he he was translating the bible into english as well luther used his copies to write his english speaking version he was getting burned at the stake at his last prayer church he was getting strangled and burnt at the same time and his last words were lord open the eyes of the king of england praise god and within a hundred years god anointed king edward viii and he commissioned a man named uh john i forget his last name john to go ahead and gave him a license to print it in english when a hundred years ago it was impossible god answered the prayer of that faithful man of god his dying prayer being burned at the stake and with a hundred years god changed the social set up i still believe god can change things in america praise god i know it's destined i know that god they worship is going to destroy him but if there's another what if there's three more generations let's be faithful in our generation let's see some revival praise god amongst us let's see some righteousness restored somewhere let's see some people get saved amen we don't know we don't know what god's gonna do like i'm talking about amen when simon received the message it caused the revival in our towns there was multiple towns i think they calculated over 40 or 50 people got baptized in our revival that was in 2001 and 2002 2003 now many of them have fallen away but some of them have stayed wendy me my wife cam simon i mean randy so many uh brothers have uh and church that's a revival praise god that's a revival and so brother brooks prayed for that brother brooks i think he said he fasted how long for that i know simon was in the closet i think three months praying that every day said him the truth but brother brooks actually fasted and prayed for that revival and that's why i believe god sent it to his church and not the other lima churches there nothing against them i don't know if they were fasting or praying but see church we should we should want to believe that especially if you have children right i have children i want to see them have revival praise god we're all we all kind of want to see the rapture today but if it don't come today and if it's in a couple generations and let my children be the the spearheads of the revival praise god that's going to be my prayer that's going to be my hope praise god okay so i just and charles spurgeon the prince of preachers jonathan edwards george whitfield if you study go study these guys at some time these were mighty men of god mighty men of god and they all use the king james version bible that's what i said i've seen it operate in their lives i said it was operating brother branham's life i said i operated my life i asked my mom before i went on that debate a few hours i said mom which version did you memorize when you got healed of cancer she said the king james she said i only memorized the king james so i'll read it psalms 1 18 17. this is the scripture that my mom was healed of cancer by believing this scripture psalms 118 19 or 17 i can't i never can remember that scripture psalms 118 17 i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord and that's what my mom has done my mom has fulfilled this scripture she has declared the works of the lord so my mom memorized that's why i told ron i said my mom got healed of cancer quote in the king james version i said i go nowhere i said i'm not looking at any other bible version and i said i've i brother ma'am preach it i went and did it i cast out devils i've laid my hands on the sick they've recovered i've seen the god's word operate so i'm saying with this praise god and he said you need to read this book and i might i don't know maybe it's possible i could read the book i doubt it but i could now moving on i'm going to keep moving on now he brought up another point um he thinks king james version is not the most accurate but a good version now look at this church he has no bible absolutely he uses 60 now this this number may be lower he might have stayed or not i remember i just got lower on the lower because i'm always guilty of exaggeration so forgive me i'm many times exaggeration so just like brother brown but anyways he said i don't have one bible can you imagine that'd be so hard oh that's tough thank god the bible's in my heart praise god great god amen you don't even have a you don't have one goat so in other words if you don't understand about john then he'll go to the second one third now look his to one meet his interpretation of it instead of saying god give me your interpretation from your absolute amen another one church see that's where the real born to be born again believer is they've got the word inside them so they know my understanding of this word has to match everything else i know praise god or else god's going to give me some new understanding and maybe i was confused before but see that and church you you know the niv there was uh there was translators on the niv that were openly homosexual and that and even admitted on the debate they didn't interpret word for word from those scrolls they did thought for thought that's why they take out the man and woman and the he and she and so then anybody can be a preacher because it's not in the bible just as a preacher don't say man or woman and that's where they get their homosexual bible because david kissed uh jonathan and said the love of him is better than a woman that's where they get homosexuality but see if you read that in the king james and go over to romans 1 paul condemns homosexuality so you know david didn't have very good relationships with his wife as far as he didn't treat her maybe they didn't treat each other very well he had he had more friendship and better talks with his brothers his brother jonathan than his wife that's just how it was right but you can't say uh oh david was homosexual with jonathan that's a bunch of trash from hell but see when you've got one absolute and there's no discrepancies there's no contradictions you can rest your soul on what god has revealed and you'll never be deceived because the gates of hell won't deceive you praise god amen he only got one absolute only got one now my first question was are you i'm sorry are the following acceptable to god i said is it okay for men to wear women's clothes because i saw on his website he didn't believe deuteronomy 22 5 the way we did i said is it is it transgender movement will you condemn that i don't even know if i use the word condemn let me check this one now this will get another subject but um condemn it was a strong word uh so yeah why are you not saying that i'm sorry sorry okay i just have to move on forgive me so anyways uh would you is bruce jenner okay and where does god change deuteronomy 2 5 so his answer was well brother jess we're not under the old covenant anymore because hebrews 8 15 says the covenant is vanishing and waxing away which it does say that and deuteronomy 22 5 is invowed because and he said the message has fallen from god because you're taking old testament scriptures and putting them in the news and simon and uh barb and beth were all listening to this debate i sent him the and uh they they saw later he uses old testament scriptures to defend his beliefs in the new testament and the sisters are like look he just contradicted himself a man who says you can't use old testament for your new testament teachings he uses old testament for his new testament teachings see is that satan thing that accuses you but you're guilty of it he's accused of the brother why is he accusing other people because he's guilty right and simon was simon said while we were listening that debate brother jesse all the sisters were bringing out scriptures jesus said i come not to abolish the law but fulfill and i didn't even think of that one brother i thought ray's got those sisters i got their sharp swords out i kind of thought i wonder if those sisters should have debated him no i mean they maybe could i don't know uh they'd have to testify right they wouldn't preach maybe have the sisters on the back burner you know like anybody got any good scriptures you know but that's great they've been taught the word so well that they had look at that the holy spirit will bring an answer that's what the bible said when the bible said when you're brought before the judges he said don't take a thought what you'll say in that hour the holy ghost will give you what to say and i experienced that a few times in this debate i didn't even know what to say and it's like the holy spirit was speaking right through me and then he brought out this now go to acts 15 29 read this here you're already there in acts yeah this was his next point in church every one of these can be debunked i love this message i love the word of god because it debunks every lie from hell amen amen thank god because i love the truth baby i got the spirit of truth that's why i love it that's right you got the spirit of truth you love truth amen don't tell me a lie just tell me the truth praise god so our brother tried to use this scripture to say oh gentiles only have to obey four things he and i i said later i said if you keep reading the bible uh acts 15 29. so you remember this i preached on this uh back when we did the uh series well we're still working on it philippians paul had to come up to jerusalem to see peter and james and decide what do we do with these gentiles they got the holy ghost at cornelius house so he said well let's just give him four things james spoke up he had the last word he was anointed to the holy spirit he said just obey these four things verse 29 abstain from meats offered to idols don't think don't eat a food that was offered to idol idolatry from blood right don't eat the blood because life is in the blood and that blood pays for your forgiveness and from things strangled right so don't eat a strangled animal and then fornication for which if you keep yourselves you shall do well very well so this was the very beginning of gentile christianity and so they said we need to tell them what to do just give them these four things and so the brother was trying to say see we don't need deuteronomy 22 5 because we've only got four commands in the new testament i said when i got my i was chomping at the bit i'm like come on here church just go to acts 20. what did paul say the bible said he gave the whole council of god look at verse 20 20 20. the year 2020 and i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you glory but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house now where's the scripture about the whole council of god anybody see it is it 27 thank you yeah there it is good look at that sister good all right eagle eyes i say eagle eyes that's why i tell my girls you gotta eagle eyes find that scripture for i have not shunned to declare you that all the counsel of god church he spent three years with him you think he just taught those four things all three years now i know i can stretch out a thought a while you know i can preach to you sir one thought but do you think he just preached for four thoughts for three years no he taught the whole council of god right as jesus revealed it to him he taught the whole council and with that thinking i told him well then you have to throw out all the epistles because you don't need romans then right you don't need corinthians ephesians you don't need them see how foolish that is at church you would think he had a month to prepare you would think in the time studying that the holy spirit would have said there's more than four and i believe it did but john i did it but i believe he turned it down because the holy spirit will always guide you in the truth he said there's no ten commandments and see i just wrote the book last year you can take where's the book do i have a copy yet i don't but there's a certain fold out in the book i list all ten commandments you can find every one is still a command in the new testament and he literally said that there's the ten commandments don't apply to us anymore said boy brother you've got some problems here he said uh he said oh yeah women aren't wearing men's pants because they're wearing women's pants because they're in the woman's pants section now this is why i didn't have time to say levi's made the first women's pants in 1968. there was no women's pants before 1968. they had to make their own or wear men's that's the point i wish i would have remembered see there were so many things he was saying i just can't remember i'm just not that smart i don't have that good of memory to memorize everything he said i've heard that argument before people told me that oh i don't i don't i'm a woman i don't wear man's pants i buy it from the women's section that's because the devil had a woman's section for pants in 1968 there was none before that and i asked him plainly i stopped and said is it wrong for bruce jenner to cross us he said i cannot say right or wrong he said because everything sinners do is sin he cannot say it was right or wrong the church thinks about that and that what the bible call that brother an abomination and the remember the bible said it's an abomination remember the bible it's an abomination to justify evil and to make good evil amen praise god and you don't even have the unction don't have the nerve to say this sin is a hateful sin in the eyes of god and i asked him about homosexuality bishop he never mentioned he just went off on these other tangents and he said jesus did not throw stones like he didn't condemn people but then he admitted how jesus did condemn the pharisees he said you children of hell he admitted that but then said that jesus doesn't throw throw stones well of course nobody threw stones in the new testament except the pharisees when they killed stephen right that's the only people that threw stones but what did jesus say he said i forgive you the adulterer he said go and sin no more amen i better man i've already been preached at all okay let me close give me 10 minutes here give me 10 minutes this just feels so good i don't feel like it's been an hour and eight minutes so my reply what did i say i like to hit the some of the points here oh i wrote it up there um i said well jesus obey deuteronomy 22 5. what about you if jesus did it he never broke a law jesus preached the gospel wearing only men's garments now it's hard to say what they were you just believe they were shorter they had different outward garment they were larger girdles history says of course they had shorter hair you could tell right away it was a man and i said they gave four laws at the beginning and then paul gave the whole council i said all new testament commandments required i said we don't condem i don't condemn bruce jenner or any homosexual as far as to hell because i don't know them i don't know but i do warn them the bible said warn the unruly the bible said warn every man so that's why we try to warn as many as we can okay so i said i made that distinction i'm not here to condemn bruce jenner i just want i just was want to know is it uh wrong or not because i know his wife remembers daughters i don't know if they do but they might wear pants they might so i was trying to get to his life you know try to get to his what's your decision on it what is your word about abominations and this is good church you got to read this let's read one more romans 8 4 this is beautiful man he tried to catch me he said what is the uh what are you trying to catch me on something he said what is the curse of the law what did jesus deliver us from and i said the curse from the law he said so we have no righteousness of our own i said i said no i said there's more than that read roman romans 8 4. now church if you know your bible this is the holy ghost baptism chapter and that's the beautiful chapter where nothing nor death death nor hype no anything wrong anything in earth in heaven can keep us from the love of jesus christ amen praise god amen because look at how it starts off look at verse one this is the holy ghost chapter there's no condemnation of them which are in christ jesus who walk right after the flesh but after the baptism of the holy spirit praise god amen this is the baptism of the holy ghost chapter now look at verse four look at verse two it calls the holy spirit is a law we're under a new law not the old law we're under the law of the holy spirit praise god for the law of the spirit of life it's the law of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do right could it make me righteous right it couldn't give me overcoming power couldn't forgive me all the way he said look what the law could not do uh i lost my spot yeah in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and force and condemned sin in the flesh amen jesus condemned the sin that was against me praise god in other words he silenced all my accusers amen there's nobody accused they can't accuse me because jesus took my sins away praise god amen now yes satan can go up there now and accuse me but as long as i say i'm sorry it's in the sea of forgetfulness praise god amen if i'm anything like job sister wendy then when god looks at me he'll say that man is perfect because of the sacrifice amen because of the blood amen not because of us but because of our sacrifice amen job was a sinner he had to make mistakes but he was redeemed by the blood but when god talked about it he said that man is perfect amen that here it is he said oh we're not under the righteousness of law i said sir i said the righteous but that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us in other words the law couldn't make you righteous but the holy ghost can it makes you fulfill the word of god because love love fulfills every word of god amen and that's scriptural too we'll read that one here before we close he said oh you you're under the righteousness i said sir i said we fulfill the righteousness of the law he said who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so i was trying to say all these laws old testament laws in judah 22 5 that's the righteousness continuing to us that we fulfill praise god amen we that was a righteous act so we must obey it now because now we're fulfilling it by the spirit not by the flesh the flesh couldn't do it but the spirit can do it praise god okay go to galatians 6 and i'll close here i believe it is now this is all going off memory here by god's grace yeah verse uh 14. galatians 6 14 we'll close this by god's grace don't you love being a christian amen hallelujah i love it i love it i thought i tell mother uh brother dennis yesterday i said i was born to defend this message everybody should know what they were born to do right samson was born to defeat the philistines dave was born defeated god's people israel everybody should know what they were born to do i was born to defend this message because it's right it is the word of god for this hour i'm going to do it by god's grace galatians 6 14 but god forbid that i should glory amen save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world so i'm crucified to the world and the world is crucified to me verse 15 for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature see what the gospel does it makes you a new creature the old testament couldn't have it all the way like weekend they had a lot of good a lot of good times in the human spirit but it never got down to the soul where their sins were totally done away and they have no more conscience for sin but amen when i see high school pictures it seems like a different lifetime for me i am a new person praise god i hardly can remember enough i think long enough i remember but when i live my life i hardly remember it seems like a total different thing why because god made me a new creature in christ jesus saving i'm not the same i'm a different creature how do i know because the love of jesus christ is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit let's stand to our feet praise god so maybe lord willing uh next week we'll look at that there's many additional points there were so many points right now as i'm listening to it again i'm at one hour and 51 minutes it's a three hour and 20 minute debate so i got i'm listening to it on double speed too my goodness there were so many things the the precious brother said god help him and church here's where i come to this conclusion i told this by the dentist i said many of these people that leave the message some of them were never saved to begin with but some of them are safe they just have a complex and that's what i believe brother rod has i looked at his by facebook amen that whole time i thought what is wrong with him he's so bitter i i felt sorry for him sister wendy i thought this guy what is wrong with him like the bible said the joy of the countenance of the lord should be on your face at the end of that at the end of that meeting the other brother tim he said i just he said before he stopped i just have to stop and thank pastor jesse i said i can feel his genuine love of the holy spirit i said thank you sir i said i love you too i do with the love of jesus i don't love what he's saying i think i disagree with everything he said but i love their souls because i don't want to see them lost i want to see what i'm saying musicians if you'll come the last thing i want to say is brother dennis mcbride said he said brother jesse when i got done with that he said i could tell you were speaking from your soul nature because you spoke by love he said that man was speaking through memorization from his intellect and that's nothing but the truth church i didn't get to all these things that he said are way off he said god did not put the wrath upon jesus he said god didn't put the wrath of god upon jesus yes he did he was wounded brewed all the iniquities the grief the sorrow like they're just reading but they're like reading these popular social gospel books and just memorizing things instead of reading the bible imagine saying something like that god had to pour all the wrath upon jesus he took all of it for us that we can be forgiven praise god he took my place and so i appreciate that when dennis said that he said you were talking through your soul through divine love and the brother was talking just through human intellect let's buy our heads for a moment church i think as i bow my head i think let's search the scriptures daily can we do that how many would say brother jesse pray for me i'll have a zeal to search the scriptures i'm not looking but i'll hold his hands up my hands and i hope you understand i believe listen brother brandon i've been many times church ministry i'm at right now i'm defending everything you said i've heard for 20 years 19 years i'm searching that amen searching it daily heavenly father lord we want to be noble not as a prideful thing but we realize we have a choice [Music] a zealous mind is that so what paul said is that soul of brother branham said the church the
