TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the Mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to continue the series on hell is not eternal according to the Bible and examine Revelation 14 verses 8 through 11 I was recently asked about this scripture and I apologize I did not address it on part 1 does revelation 14 verse 11 teach those tormented for taking the mark of the beast suffer eternally the answer is no and I'll read the passage now and then provide biblical proof and there followed another angel saying Babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the line of the wrath of her fornication and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the Beast and His image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels and in the presence of the Lamb and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the Beast and His image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name those who believe in eternal torment seem to misunderstand the phrase in verse 11 that says and they have no rest day or night who worship the Beast and His name this verse does not say they are tormented for eternity without end so we cannot add that to the text it simply says the tormented ones have no rest day or night but it does not say how long this torment lasts we cannot add to the Bible nor take away from it for God will call us liars if we do according to proverbs 35 and 6 every word of God is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him add though not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar revelation 14:11 can only be understood or rightly divided and interpreted correctly using other scriptures not by adding our own thoughts unbelievers do not have eternal life and therefore cannot burn for an eternity for other scriptures that help us realize that no rest day or night is not eternal torment our two pairs of scriptures first John 3:15 and Revelation 21 verse 8 and revelation 13:8 and 17:8 beginning with first John 3:15 you learn the undeniable principle that unbelievers do not have eternal life and therefore cannot burn for an eternity first John 3:15 says who suffer hate of his brother is a murderer and he know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him if a murderer does not have eternal life he cannot burn eternally revelation 21:8 then lists other groups of sinners along with murderers who cannot have eternal life and I'll burn with fire and brimstone but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death hopefully now you can see that murders fearful unbelieving abominable whoremongers sorcerers idolaters and all liars do not have eternal life and cannot be tormented for eternity the torment spoken in Revelation 14 11 may last a long time perhaps thousands of years or longer but it will not last eternally because they don't have eternal life abiding in their souls the other two scriptures that prove torment is not eternal our revelation 13:8 and 17:8 which said the names of the worshipers of the beasts which is the evil spirit of Rome and it's false sister churches are not in the book of life the book of life is the book of eternal life so again the torment of sinners cannot last eternally because their names are not on the book that lists those who possess eternal life revelation 13:8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world revelation 17:8 the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is next God is fair and just one person questioned my statement from part one that said God is too merciful to torment unbelievers eternally without end but I stand by this statement because God's punishments always fit the crime God's punishments were never excessive in the past and they will not be excessive in the future God proves the i4i principle Exodus 21:24 I for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot God is a fair judge God will not announce unending punishment for only 100 years or so of sin that is not a fair recompense Hebrews chapter 2 verses 2 & 3 say for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation notice every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward Romans 9 14 says what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God god forbid isaiah 45:21 says tell ye and bring them near yay let them take counsel together who hath declare this from ancient time who hath told it from that time have not I the Lord and there is no God else beside me a just God and a savior there is none beside me remember that unbelievers will have an ending point second Peter 2:12 says sinners are made to be taken and destroyed which means they will come to destruction Jesus teaches the same destruction in Matthew 10:28 saying fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell Satan has an ending point and will be no more according to Ezekiel 28 1980 and never shalt thou be any more Malachi 4 verses one through three describes the judgment of sinners following the Battle of Armageddon sinners are left with neither root nor branch in closing I hope you now understand revelation 14:11 in light of the rest of the scripture please text or email me with any other questions or concerns god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
