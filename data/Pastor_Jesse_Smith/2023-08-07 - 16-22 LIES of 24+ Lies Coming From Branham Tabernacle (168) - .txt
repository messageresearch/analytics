TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's just made it read s and yes [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to continue the series about the lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle located in Jeffersonville Indiana USA please see the previous videos for lies number 1 through 15. the 16th lie coming out of Branham Tabernacle is that brother Branham is their pastor the evidence of this lie is an audio clip from a preliminary from a Branham Tabernacle service in this quote you'll hear Brandon Tabernacles Pastor say that during the squeeze they will still have their Pastor even though they can't physically gather and of course they're referring to brother Branham let's listen to the LIE thank God for that so it's important to have our home tape churches when the rest of the churches who don't know what to do we do because that we've been in training and when it happens we won't lose our church or our pastor thank you [Applause] friends the reason this is a lie is because the Bible never teaches that dead men can Pastor living men if you do a simple Bible Search the word Pastor is used nine times the word Bishop is used six times and there is not one Bible verse that says a dead Pastor or dead Bishop can Pastor living believers and as I put on a recent video about the five parallels between the Roman Catholic church and Branham Tabernacle this seems to be some sort of spiritualism because Roman Catholics claim to contact the dead Saints through prayer and so Brenham Tabernacle seems to be acting like they can contact Brother Branham through their tape Services you can find examples of Branham Tabernacle tape services and they will invite brother Branham to come preach and yet brother Branham is dead for me to be able to welcome God's proper messenger come and brings the message of the hour for truly we say we believe that we was predestinated to be played for us tonight God knew that we were going to be listening so let us open up our hearts hear the message of the hour here's God's problem [Music] and remember the Bible verses for this Joshua 1 verses 1 and 2 Deuteronomy 31 verse 14 numbers 27 15-21 all these Old Testament verses show that when God was going to take one of his servants in this case Moses off the scene God had a living man ready to take his place of course that was Joshua and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever even II Timothy 2 verse 2 Paul says teach Faithful Men the word of God so that they can teach others the word of God more evidence that Branham Tabernacles wrong is quotes from Brother Branham brother Branham said I won't always be your pastor so let's play those quotes back to back random Tabernacles lie and then brother Rams quote and when it happens we won't lose our church or our pastor what's been long and hot but people we won't always be standing here I won't always see your pastor a second quote is from 1957 Hebrews chapter 7 part 2 brother Brandon said quote I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here end quote so in this quote brother random makes it seem like he is not the pastor of Branham Tabernacle I know there's other quotes that talk about brother Neville being an associate pastor but if Branham Tabernacle says every quote is thus saith the Lord there's no mistakes on the tapes then Branham Tabernacle is contradicting this quote because in this quote brother random makes it plain he is not the pastor of random Tabernacle brother Neville was the pastor of random Tabernacle so let's listen to the quote and when it happens we won't lose our church or our pastor but the full and complete authority of the church is the pastor read that in the Bible see if that's not Bible order that's exactly right there's no one above the Elder I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here that's up to you and brother Neville your brother never wanted to preach Jehovah Witness doctoring that's up to him and you see if he wanted to preach anything he wanted to that's between you and him that's all if the congregation votes for him in there to preach that that's all right that's up to him the only thing that I do just as owning the property much more could be said about these topics but I want to move on the 17th lie is that worshipers at Brenham Tabernacle can have home Tafe churches and they do not have to gather physically at a church so the evidence of this lie is from Brenham tabernacle's blog posts on Sunday March 15 2020 random Tabernacles Pastor announced they're going to have our home tape services and not physically gathered due to coveted restrictions but even when those restrictions were lifted random Tabernacle has not gathered physically for over three years now due to construction so friends Branham Tabernacle has been breaking the word of God for nearly three years they haven't physically gathered together what's sad is that even denominational churches went against the covet guidelines and gathered more as they saw that day approaching so that's a shame and rebuke upon Branham Tabernacle not having the faith to obey the word of God rather than obey men and here's a screenshot of random tabernacle's website showing they're not Gathering due to construction so the reasons this is wrong this is a lie is because Hebrews 10 verses 24 through 25 says gather more as we see that day approaching and they are not Gathering more than they've been Gathering less as we see the day approaching of Jesus's return so this is complete Disobedience to the word of God second brother Branham never stopped Gathering people together even during their construction there was a construction project in 1963 before the seals that brother Branham never stopped the people Gathering From worshiping so again we see Branham tabernacle's current leadership doing things that brother Branham did not do friends brother random even said go to church physically even if you only get one slice because the Bible commands you to fellowship with believers and questions and answers part 164 brother Graham said and you go to church brother Brandon said if I went to a certain church that I know there's only one thing them people ever said that I believed they said they believed Jesus was the son of God I'd go hear them say that notice brother Ram says I'd go hear them say that and yet Branham Tabernacles people sit at home for over three years they're not doing what brother random did they're not doing what brother Branham said to do I know they put a pressure on you want your charm but you don't have to join but put them kids in Sunday school somewhere and you go to church don't sit at home go fishing hunting and things like that on Sunday you say well I'm not a legalism well you better be in that manner for a while dishonoring the resurrection of Christ you go to church somewhere if I if I went if I couldn't get if I went to a certain church that I know there's only one thing then people ever said that I believe they said they believed Jesus was the son of God they said it I doubt it but I go hear him say that maybe say that's this church May the next Church be something like the Baptist they say yeah I believe you have to have an experience I'll go with him that then I believe Jesus Christ the son of God I believe you have to have an experience then brother Ram said if there was an Assemblies of God church and he could eat about three or four slices with them he'd go with them all right then maybe there's a there's a now I can eat about three or four slices of bread with them see if you can't go if you can't come here to Tabernacle get some church somewhere go to it you don't have to take all they do what part of bread they're serving you serve the bread well they got the garlic while you just leave it alone see Ryan I can't make them you know that's attack sure you go to church wherever the church door opens you take off as hard as you can go if they don't believe well you don't have to partake don't join them don't join any of them churches but go to them fellowship with them how do you know it's not the Lord he said he'd make everything work together for the good and maybe it is soul in there or to be saved and you can Shine the Light to them see go on down there don't go irrigate go sweet the people can say that's such a Christian woman a Christian couple that's this Christian boy a girl I like that boy they really act like they got something see and say what is here it is then tell them would you just be salty they'll get thirsty and then brother Branham said in convinced then concern 1962 he said you cannot be as good of a Christian if you stay at home people say I can stay at home be just as good a Christian as I can at church you can the Bible said not forsake or assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the time coming if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are in fellowship with other Christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life it can't do it because it's like I I I'm hungry but I'll never go to a table I just I'll never eat I just ain't go to do it see you've got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship one with another we need one another more now than we ever did need each other is now when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself just a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to show shape with that you're getting on Dangerous Ground right then it's keeping away from church find the one of your choice and remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them that's the way to be a real Christian and we got Fellowship protection people love you and pray for you brother Graham said if the holy spirit is in you you hunger for God he said you've got the wrong Spirit if it's trying to keep you away from the church he said the spirit of God will run you right straight to the church every time the door opens for Fellowship let's listen to the quote if it's hard for church and press yourself to come to come when the church is open there's something wrong with that spirit it's trying to keep you away from God the spirit of God will run you right straight to the church ever time the door opens for Fellowship yes sir more could be said but let's move on to the 18th lie the 18th fly is that life only comes through the tapes the evidence is from July 17 2022 the blog post says quote there's nothing that can satisfy us and give us life but the spoken word of God on tape it is the only way life can come through his spoken word the voice of God for our day end quote so the first reason this is wrong is because the Bible said Jesus Christ is the life and Jesus Christ is not a tape so many verses that could be used John 14 6 John 3 16 John 3 36 first John 5 verse 13 Believing on Jesus Christ is life so life comes through believing in Jesus Christ the spiritual Act of believing Jesus's word now let's look at brother random quotes brother Brandon said you can listen to tapes and still not be quickened Tabernacle you listen to taste and yes the spirit is never Quicken you to either follow the word of God another quote from 1953 healing line brother random said only life can come through Christ who died in your stead end quote now your faith in God will what will make you well and both of you in dying condition [Music] only life can come through Christ who died in your stand questions and answers 1959 brother Braham said quote when the Holy Spirit has created in him a Living Hope of eternal life which only comes through the Holy Ghost end quote he isn't converted until his old life is dead and he is buried in Christ and is risen with him and the resurrection of newness of life when the Holy Spirit has created in him a Living Hope of eternal life which only comes through the Holy Ghost 1863 there's only one way provided by God for anything brother random says quote but the only eternal life comes through God's word that's that's the only seed that can produce eternal life end quote but the only eternal life comes through God's word that's that's the only seed that can produce eternal life Investments 1963 brother Ram said quote and life comes only through obedience to Christ he is the life end quote our heavenly father as many are on their feet they signify by this that they won't lie and life comes only through obedience to Christ he is lying he has a condition that we must need so friends there are no quotes that say life only comes from the tapes so again Branham Tabernacle is saying things the Bible doesn't say and things brother Branham never said and then brother Branham tells us life only comes through living members of the body of Jesus Christ and the examples he gives are from the book of Acts he uses Acts chapter 8 Philip preaching to the eunuch he said the germ of Life had to come through the body Philip and then Acts chapter 10 life had to come through Peter to cornelius's house and then ananias prayed for Paul the scales fell from his eyes life came through ananias to Saint Paul otheran said quote but the life come through the body of Christ end quote although an angel Philip tooing but the germ of Life had to come through the body Philip amen amen now listen the same thing took place in Acts 10 48. Peter was on the housetop an angel directed in the cornelius's house but where did the word come from the body [Applause] I feel pretty good Angel directed it but the life comes through the body of Christ Paul on his way to Damascus evasion directed him but ananas had to turn amen you have to worry so here brother random says the eternal life comes through living men and women that are born again of the Holy Ghost it does not only come through tapes as Branham Tabernacle is falsely claiming the 19th lie is that God's program is to play tapes and have the fivefold ministry stop Ministry this comes from a November 20th 2021 blog post random Tabernacle says quote 56 years ago God began his program to gather his bride together so they could hear him speak through his mighty Angel all at the same time he even had his five-fold ministry stop ministering and gather their people together and place the hook up in their churches as he wanted his bride to hear his voice all at the same time his great plan had begun end quote so again we see the subtle lie of the enemy claiming brother Branham had this secret plan to have the fivefold ministry stop preaching and have everybody just listen to him on phone hookups now of course we know this is a lie because the Bible says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and Jesus Christ gave the gospel to Saint Paul to preach it and teach it Romans 2 16 says we'll all be judged by the gospel Jesus revealed to Paul and God's program is the fivefold ministry very plain very simple to understand Ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16 the Bible says the fivefold ministry brings Unity to the church and will bring the church to Perfection which means the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ the Bible never says the fivefold ministry stops preaching at the end time so Brandon Tabernacle is saying things the Bible doesn't say they're taking away from the Bible they're taking away the five preaching gifts and they're adding their false program to the Bible so they're guiltyable taking away and adding to the Bible remember the quotes from Brother Branham brother Brown said don't change a thing about your Evangelistic services and of course that relates to the faithful Ministry evangelist is one of the five gifts the ram said don't change a thing the Branham Tabernacle is saying change it good evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change the thing if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today like if it will be 10 years from today but live life's going to be a desire don't don't get scrupled up now that's why I'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent okay come back to God continue on your Evangelistic service just as you always did also 1964 questions and answers they asked brother Branham are you the only one that should preach and brother Brandon said of course not I'm just one Pebble on the beach he says we need preachers we have seen your we have seen you ordained man we do don't believe you would do that if there were not that they were not to preach Mercy brother sister ever who told you nobody's priest with me a hot sure if you have four subjects of gods with all that no every manner that feels a call of God upon his life get into the ministry start preaching we need them man of God or anointed all over the world to preach the gospel I'm just one little Pebble on the beach among many big stones see so any man that's called or God needs to preach the gospel in 1959 my new ministry brother Branham said preaching is his program and he says God has so arranged that his program cannot move without you and I so Branham Tabernacle says tape playing as God's program brother random said preaching is God's program live God has soaring that his program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God needs us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves while the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are in God's will doing his program the Philadelphia Church age 1960 brother Brandon said it's his program the commission of the church is to preach the gospel God never did dollars to build churches never did tell us to make Schools they're all right hospitals and so forth God knows we need them at this program but the commission of the churches that preach the gospel and God hiding himself in Simplicity March 17 1963 brother Graham said God won't leave his program he ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being it was man God won't lead his program that's the reason we know that this day it's got to be civil amen now he always works in Simplicity yes but God in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel are the winds preach the gospel or an angel preach the gospel but he ordained man for that purpose and he never changes it he never already he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of any ordained man the preach the gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being it was man so much more could be said but let's move on to the 20th lie which is Brenham Tabernacle falsely claims we are now in the wedding ceremony this is from a blog post from September 24 2022. Brenham Tabernacle says quote we are now in a wedding ceremony with the bridegroom and we'll soon be leaving for our wedding supper and our honeymoon end quote so this statement completely contradicts brother random statement in Oneness 1962. brother said quote now the church now is engaged to Christ for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the Lamb end quote so Brenham Tabernacle is completely contradicting brother Branham random Tabernacle says we are now in a wedding ceremony and brother Brandon says the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the land the branch said the church is now engaged to Christ for the wedding but the wedding has never been performed yet let's listen to the quote down the church now is engaged to Christ for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the land so we see that the church is now engaged like a man engaged to his wife or could be said but the 21st lie is the tapes are God speaking lip to ear to Branham Tabernacle so this lies from December 3rd 2022 Brenham Tabernacle says quote come join us at the only place you can hear the Vindicated voice of God tell you lip to ear who he is who we are and where we're going press play end quote so the first proof this is wrong is that if we look to the Bible there are no scriptures in the Bible that say lip to ear also there are no Bible verses that say play tapes and at the end of the Gentile dispensation if you just play tapes it'll be God speaking lip to ear to you and you won't need the fivefold ministry also the Bible says God spoke to Moses mouth to mouth that's in numbers 12 verse 8 with him will I speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches in the similitude of the Lord shall he behold so the Bible terminology for this is mouth to mouth and not lip to ear so the Bible proves the lip to ear claim is false coming out of Brandon Tabernacle and second brother Ram said God never spoke to any other man like that as he did Moses brother Graham said God talked lift your ear with one prophet and brother Graham said never was a man that God ever spoke to like he did Moses outside of Christ so Branham Tabernacle is saying we get to hear lip to ear from God but brother random says the opposite God never did speak lip to ear except to Moses and Jesus brother Brown said God only talked lip to ear with one Prophet referring to Moses brother Brown said God never spoke like he did to Moses to any other man let's listen to the quotes and God spoke to him God spoke to Moses face to face lip to ear now he never spoke to any other man like that as he did Moses I hope it goes way down Moses greatest Prophet ever lived outside of Jesus Christ never was a man that God ever spoke to like he did Moses outside of Christ he talked left to ear with one prophet and spoke to the other prophet he had no control at all and spoke to his lips a 20-second lie coming out of Branham Tabernacle is that when they listen to tapes they hear from God just like Abraham heard from Melchizedek in Genesis 18. this lie was found on the blog post from December 10 2022 the blog post says quote we will all be gathered together from around the world listening to that same great Melchizedek speak to us a person who had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life God and morphe speaking to us through human lips just how he did that day to Abraham end quote so Branham Tabernacle claims God was going to speak to them just as he did to Abraham of course this is a lie the Bible proof is from Hebrews 7 1-4 Bible mentions Melchizedek without father without mother and then in verse 4 now consider how great this man was so Melchizedek was a man brother tells us it was God's spirit come down to the Earth and he borrowed flesh he took the dust of the earth and created a flesh body and Melchizedek was God in a flesh body and that body had no sin that body was never born and that body never died so from Bible proof alone Brenham tabernacle's line they did not have Melchizedek in a human body preaching to them through a tape at their service in December 2022 that's impossible God never said he was going to send the body of Melchizedek again in December of 2022. there's quotes from Brother Branham of course that contradict Branham tabernacle's current lies brother random said in reference to Melchizedek quote then later we never heard no more Melchizedek because he became Jesus Christ end quote so brother random said Melchizedek will never come again in a body like he did because he became Jesus Christ so Melchizedek in his flesh body was not at the Branham Tabernacle in December 2022 and now I realize I don't even think they were gathered at Branham Tabernacle physically so the physical body Melchizedek did not physically appear to each and every person in their home tape church services in December 2022 because Melchizedek was never more heard of as brother random said let's listen to the quote now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word and in morphed body he came in and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek then later we never heard no more Melchizedek because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was a priest but he became Jesus Christ please recognize that Branham Tabernacles propagating 100 idolatry they say playing the tapes in their home is the same as Abraham hearing from Melchizedek so they have essentially exalted the tape being equal to Melchizedek which also means brother random is equal to Melchizedek brother Branham and his tapes are equal to God this is 100 idolatry they are not hearing the same as Abraham heard from Melchizedek Melchizedek had a body that was never born and never sinned brother branham's body was born of a woman and he said he sinned every single day he said he made thousands of mistakes in a year and he said he was not worthy to live not fit to live and he said he wasn't saying that to be humble and also based upon previous quotes God will never leave the five-fold preaching program according to brother Branham and according to Saint Paul remember friends brother Ram said in the church age book the seventh Church age Messenger will not change one iota of what Christ gave to Paul and Bradham Tabernacle has repeatedly changed numerous doctrines and teachings that Jesus Christ revealed to Paul therefore they are false as the church age book says in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing the holy spirit always guides us into all truth I'm trying to shorten these videos a little bit because I feel burdened to move on to other projects to help the Saints by the grace of God so let's close with a word of prayer for those around the world who are deceived by Branham Tabernacle Heavenly Father Lord we ask God that these videos will be used to glorify your holy name and that people might be brought out of Darkness Into The Marvelous Light of the bible-based Gospel of Jesus Christ the true gospel that you revealed to your servant brother William Branham Lord May these tape church people stop worshiping the tapes may they be delivered from the spirit of air all these 24 plus lies Lord God and we know you'll do it because you said the elect cannot be deceived all those that are elect will come out of this man-made denomination this tape church denomination and Lord use this video in other videos like this to help your people escape the lies in the tape Church movement I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
