[0:02] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest
[0:05] upon him the spirit of wisdom of
[0:09] understanding the spirit of counsel
[0:11] might the spirit of knowledge and the
[0:14] fear of the Lord and shall make him of
[0:19] quick understanding and the fear of the
[0:22] Lord greetings friends in the matchless
[0:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:27] purpose of this video is to do a part
[0:29] two on this series on the fear of the
[0:31] Lord and in this video we're looking at
[0:33] the New Testament verses that speak of
[0:35] the fear of the Lord by the grace of God
[0:38] hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride
[0:40] of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio
[0:41] USA and I defend the original Gospel of
[0:44] the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed
[0:46] to St Paul and then had to restore
[0:47] through Martin Luther John Wesley and
[0:49] the late Prophet brother William Maran
[0:51] and brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965
[0:54] and also defend brother Ram's Godly
[0:56] Christian character so here's a
[0:58] screenshot of A Brief Review of part one
[1:01] we looked at Old Testament verses we
[1:03] found that the fear of the Lord is your
[1:05] choice to love good it's profound honor
[1:07] for God and hatred for sin it's your
[1:10] prerequisite for the beginning of wisdom
[1:12] it's your strong confidence in God or
[1:14] your Refuge it's your Fountain of Life
[1:17] it's your source of Happiness it's your
[1:19] path to praise or reward of God it's
[1:23] your path to Lasting Purity your path to
[1:25] Blessings your lesson to be learned and
[1:27] it's also your conclusion about life
[1:32] purpose now as we get into part two I
[1:34] want
[1:35] to slightly amend uh my definition of
[1:38] the fear of the Lord here's a
[1:40] screenshot in part one I said that the
[1:42] fear of the Lord is profound honor and
[1:45] it is but I'd like to add to that the
[1:47] Hebrew definition is morally reverence
[1:50] so moral is Right Behavior reverence is
[1:53] profound honor so the fear of the Lord
[1:55] is behaving right with profound honor as
[1:59] a meditated on this definition I thought
[2:01] of the New Testament and the words of
[2:02] our Lord Jesus who said if you love me
[2:05] keep my
[2:06] commands I knew the fear of the Lord was
[2:08] hating evil departing from evil in order
[2:11] to obey God's word so I think now I can
[2:14] say that the fear of the Lord in the New
[2:15] Testament is loving obedience obedience
[2:18] is the right Behavior spoken of in the
[2:20] Old Testament so I get this idea of
[2:23] loving obedience from the words of Jesus
[2:26] three times in John 14 Jesus said if you
[2:28] love me keep my
[2:30] commands so the keeping of commands
[2:32] would be obedience which is the same as
[2:35] the Old Testament wording of right
[2:38] behavior and of course we obey based
[2:40] upon love and not a sinful fear of the
[2:43] Lord but it's a loving fear of the Lord
[2:46] as brother Ram said we're saved by grace
[2:48] but then our works are done for our
[2:50] gratitude or appreciation or I'd even
[2:52] say our love for the Salvation that God
[2:54] has revealed to us and given to us so
[2:57] these are two different ways to to
[2:59] identify the fear of the Lord maybe in
[3:02] common terms that we'd understand you
[3:04] could call it right behavior in profound
[3:06] honor or you could just call it loving
[3:08] obedience as Jesus said in John
[3:11] 14:15 let's go through now the verses on
[3:13] the fear of the Lord in the New
[3:15] Testament I chose the ones that I
[3:16] thought would be most helpful here by
[3:18] God's grace the fear of the Lord is your
[3:20] highest respect for the one who can save
[3:23] or destroy your soul Matthew 10:28 says
[3:26] and fear not them which kill the body
[3:27] but are not able to kill the soul
[3:30] but rather fear him which is able to
[3:32] destroy both soul and Body in
[3:35] hell we give God the greatest respect
[3:38] because he has power over our souls and
[3:41] thank God he saved us by grace through
[3:43] faith Ephesians 2:
[3:45] 8-10 the next verse about the fear of
[3:47] the Lord is it's your source of God's
[3:49] mercy according to Luke 1:50 the Bible
[3:52] said and his Mercy is on them that fear
[3:55] Him from generation to
[3:57] generation when God sees that we fear
[3:59] Him him we lovingly obey him then he
[4:01] extends Mercy to us next Luke 23:40 the
[4:06] fear of the Lord is your hope in the
[4:08] last moments before death this is seen
[4:10] with the saved thief on the cross the
[4:12] saved Thief said Dost not thou fear God
[4:15] seeing Thou Art in the same condemnation
[4:17] he spoke this to the other malactor who
[4:20] was railing on Jesus earlier in Luke
[4:23] 23:39 so this fear of God that the save
[4:26] Thief had led him to ask for Jesus to
[4:29] remember him him in verse 42 and of
[4:31] course Jesus said today Thou shalt be
[4:34] with me in Paradise this shows how
[4:36] important the fear of the Lord is at the
[4:38] moment of death next the fear of the
[4:40] Lord is your motivation for perfecting
[4:42] Holiness in 2 Corinthians 7:1 the Bible
[4:45] says having therefore these promises
[4:47] dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves
[4:49] from all filthiness of the Flesh and
[4:51] spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear
[4:54] of
[4:55] God we will not be like the rejected
[4:58] church that's lovers of Pleasures more
[5:01] than lovers of God we're going to be
[5:02] lovers of God and therefore will be
[5:04] perfected or matured in the Holiness of
[5:07] God because we fear the lord the fear of
[5:10] the Lord is your key to a loving
[5:11] marriage we see that in Ephesians 5 21
[5:14] and 22 the Bible says submitting
[5:16] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[5:18] God Ephesians 5:22 says wives submit
[5:21] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[5:23] unto the Lord so in these two verses we
[5:26] see the submission that's required wives
[5:29] submit to their own husbands in the fear
[5:31] of God and so as the wife submits in
[5:34] obeying her husband the husband submits
[5:36] to Christ by loving his wife as Christ
[5:39] loved the church we see that in
[5:41] Ephesians
[5:42] 5:25 husbands love your wives even as
[5:45] Christ also loved the church and gave
[5:46] himself for it this verse should remind
[5:48] you of the verse we covered in part one
[5:50] proverbs 31:30 a woman that fearth the
[5:53] Lord shall be praised so we see this
[5:56] fear of the Lord continued in happy
[5:57] marriages in the New Testament
[6:00] next the fear of the Lord is your source
[6:02] for almsgiving prayer and fasting we see
[6:05] this in corus's life in Acts 10 verse
[6:07] two he was a devout man one that feared
[6:10] God with all his house which gave much
[6:13] alms to the people and prayed to God all
[6:15] way if we want to please God with
[6:17] almsgiving prayer and fasting then we
[6:19] need the fear of the Lord to do that
[6:21] next the fear of the Lord is your
[6:22] acceptance with God according to acts
[6:25] 10:35 Peter said but in every nation he
[6:27] that fearth him and worketh
[6:29] righteousness is accepted with him God
[6:32] accepts all those who fear Him and then
[6:34] work righteousness of course we're not
[6:37] saved by works again works are an
[6:39] expression of our gratitude for God
[6:41] saving our souls this reminds me of
[6:44] Galatians 5:6 works are an outflow of
[6:47] the love of God because Faith Works by
[6:49] love so if we have faith we'll work but
[6:52] before faith we have to have love if we
[6:54] love God we keep his Commandments if we
[6:56] love God that gives us faith and then
[6:58] that Faith causes us to work because
[7:00] Faith Works by love as its
[7:03] motivation next the fear of the Lord is
[7:06] your basis for receiving more from God
[7:08] according to acts
[7:10] 13:26 men and Brethren Children of the
[7:12] stock of Abraham and whosoever among you
[7:14] fearth God to you is the word of this
[7:17] salvation
[7:19] sent so Paul recognized because the Jews
[7:22] fear God God was giving them a chance to
[7:25] receive the New Testament the New
[7:26] Covenant so we know as message believers
[7:29] if we love God and fear God God will
[7:31] give us the further Revelation for
[7:32] rapturing Faith any other Revelations
[7:35] God wants to reveal in the end time
[7:37] we'll receive it because we fear God and
[7:39] keep his commands next the fear of the
[7:41] Lord is your essential humility as
[7:43] Gentiles whom God will eventually cut
[7:45] off we see this in Romans 11:
[7:48] 20-2 the Bible said well because of
[7:50] unbelief they were broken off and thou
[7:52] standest by faith be not high- minded
[7:55] but
[7:55] fear for if God Spar not the natural
[7:58] branches take heed he also spare not
[8:00] thee then verse 23 says God is able to
[8:03] graft Israel in
[8:05] again and we see this happening in
[8:07] Romans
[8:08] 11:25 blindness is in part is happen to
[8:11] Israel until the fullness of the
[8:13] Gentiles be come in and in verse 26 so
[8:16] shall all Israel be saved so after God
[8:20] raptures the way the Gentile bride he'll
[8:21] graft back in the 144,000 Jews and will
[8:25] save them next the fear of the Lord is
[8:28] your humility as you work out your own
[8:30] salvation Philippians
[8:32] 2:12 Paul said wherefore my beloved as
[8:35] you have always obeyed not as in my
[8:37] presence only but now much more in my
[8:39] absence work out your own salvation with
[8:41] fear and
[8:43] trembling the word trembling in the
[8:45] Greek means the anxiety of one who
[8:47] distrusts his ability completely to meet
[8:49] all requirements but religiously does
[8:52] his utmost to fulfill his duty that's a
[8:55] beautiful definition we have no ability
[8:57] to meet God's requirements
[9:00] because Jesus met all our requirements
[9:01] on the cross by the blood that he shed
[9:04] saying it is finished but then once
[9:06] we're saved we recognize God has a duty
[9:08] for us and we do everything in our power
[9:10] to fulfill God's Duty for us which is
[9:13] the greatest commandment to love God
[9:14] with all of our heart soul mind and
[9:16] strength next the fear of the Lord is
[9:18] taught by Grace So Grace teaches your
[9:21] heart to fear the lord as the hymn
[9:23] Amazing Grace speaks of and then the
[9:26] fear of the Lord is your motivation for
[9:27] acceptably serving the the Lord in this
[9:30] Grace Hebrews 1228 and 29 wherefore we
[9:34] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[9:36] moved let us have Grace whereby we may
[9:38] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[9:40] godly fear for our God is a consuming
[9:44] fire so it's through Grace that we serve
[9:47] god with reverence and godly fear Grace
[9:50] taught our hearts to fear next the fear
[9:53] of the Lord is your mindset as you
[9:55] sojourn here in your service to God 1
[9:57] Peter 1:17 and 21:17 the Bible says if
[10:01] you call on the father pass the time of
[10:04] your sojourning here in fear so we must
[10:06] pass our time in the fear of the Lord
[10:09] and if we'll do that we'll do 1 Peter
[10:11] 21:17 where we'll honor all men love the
[10:14] Brotherhood fear God honor the
[10:18] king next the fear of the Lord is the
[10:20] anointing the church walks in after
[10:22] great signs and wonders are done among
[10:25] them this is according to acts 5: 5-16
[10:28] and acts 93 31 after the death of ananas
[10:31] and saf the Bible said great fear or
[10:33] fear of the Lord came upon the church
[10:35] then the Bible said the Saints did many
[10:38] signs wonders and miracles acts 9:31
[10:41] says they walked in the fear of the Lord
[10:43] and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost and
[10:44] were
[10:46] multiplied so I've seen this in my life
[10:49] and no doubt others have seen it as well
[10:50] when God does a great sign Wonder
[10:52] Miracle brings a renewed fear of the
[10:54] Lord upon ourselves upon the Saints and
[10:58] we rejoice in that
[10:59] next the fear of the Lord is not in the
[11:01] mind of Sinners according to Romans
[11:03] 318 of course this is something to keep
[11:06] in mind as you're witnessing to people
[11:07] there is no fear of God before their
[11:10] eyes so that's why we preach the gospel
[11:12] the good news to the people first we
[11:14] must show them the bad news that their
[11:16] sins have condemned them and they cannot
[11:19] save themselves and then we share the
[11:21] good news of the Gospel of the Lord
[11:22] Jesus Christ the substitutionary
[11:25] sacrifice of our Lord Jesus and his
[11:27] grace is called a free gift in Romans 5:
[11:31] 15 16 and 18 two more verses here uh the
[11:35] fear of the Lord is the final command to
[11:37] the Lost before the mark of the beast is
[11:39] laid down it's in Revelation 14: 6-11
[11:43] the Bible said another Angel flew in the
[11:45] midst of Heaven having the Everlasting
[11:47] gospel to preach to them that dwell on
[11:49] the earth to Every Nation Kindred tongue
[11:50] and people saying with a loud voice fear
[11:53] God and give glory to him for the hour
[11:55] of his judgment is come and worship him
[11:57] that made Heaven and Earth and the Sea
[11:59] and in The Fountains of the waters and
[12:01] then verse 9 the second half of it says
[12:03] if any man worship the beast in His
[12:05] image and receive his Mark in his
[12:06] forehead or in his hand verse 10 the
[12:09] same shall drink of the wine of the
[12:10] wrath of God this again shows the
[12:13] importance of having the fear of the
[12:14] Lord just to be saved like we'd say the
[12:16] foolish virgin and again that wonderful
[12:18] example of the thief on the cross saved
[12:20] in those last moments because he had the
[12:22] fear of the Lord and then if you have
[12:24] this fear of the Lord it will lead to
[12:26] the wisdom needed to recognize the Beast
[12:28] who being rode by the mother Harlot this
[12:31] is found in Revelation
[12:33] 13:18 Revelation
[12:35] 17:9 so I put these two verses together
[12:38] Revelation 14 then Revelation 131 18 and
[12:42] Revelation 179 this looks like it's
[12:45] God's last call to the foolish virgin
[12:48] gospel comes and says fear God the good
[12:51] news is fear God God will have mercy on
[12:53] you and then if those foolish virgins
[12:55] receive the fear of God that'll give
[12:57] them the beginning of wisdom to rec
[12:59] recogniz the Seven Hills or the Seven
[13:00] Mountains upon which ancient Rome sat
[13:03] and current Rome sits with that wisdom
[13:06] they'll recognize the Roman Catholic
[13:07] Church as the mother Harlot and they
[13:09] will not accept the mark of the beast
[13:12] we've come to the end of part two
[13:13] friends I hope all these verses on the
[13:15] fear of the Lord from the New Testament
[13:17] were a blessing they've been a great
[13:18] blessing to me and also our church by
[13:20] the grace of God it's amazing to see how
[13:22] the fear of the Lord is a part of our
[13:24] Salvation our justification
[13:26] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:28] our entire ire Earthly Journey so in the
[13:31] next part we'll look at the quotes from
[13:32] God's Prophet brother brandom on the
[13:34] fear of the Lord and we'll see our
[13:35] conclusion likely a part three by God's
[13:38] grace if you have any questions concerns
[13:41] or testimonies about this video please
[13:42] contact
[13:43] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[13:47] the desire of your heart
