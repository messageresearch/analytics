TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach God's desire for all Christians to have a home church as part of the body of Jesus Christ the Bible teaches that all cushions should do the following faithfully attend a home church with increasing attendance Hebrews 10 21 to 27 revelation to 19 and 26 Luke 4 verses 14 to 17 worship on Sunday and other days acts 20 verse 7 Hebrews 10:25 have a pastor Ephesians 4:11 and Matthew 9:36 grow from all five preaching gifts Ephesians 4:11 through sixteen have a church family Titus 1:5 Romans 16 3 through 5 Colossians 4:15 Hebrews 10:24 2:25 John 13:35 and acts 2:42 to 46 and financially support your home church with tithes and offerings the command to faithfully tend a home church with increasing attendance church attendance is not optional for true Christians as Hebrews chapter 10 commands Christians to faithfully assemble together and more often as the second coming of Jesus Christ approaches and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching gathering together is both an essential act commanded and a selfless act as scripture says gathering is considering one another considering means to understand to consider attentively fix one's eyes or mind upon we consider our Christian family to provoke or inspire them to love God and do good works that glorify Christ this is done through prayer singing sharing revelations and Bible knowledge foretelling future events sharing Bible doctrine and more first corinthians 14:6 now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesy or by doctrine hebrews 10:25 also says christians must exhort or comfort or pray for each other to miss church is to selfishly forsake nor abandon other christians forsaking church services exposes an evil selfish rebellious and wandering spirit a person who leaves a home church signifies they are not part of the family of God according to first John 2:19 and a person who separates themselves from the true church shows they do not have the Holy Spirit according to Jude 1:19 they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us these be they who separate themselves sensual not having the spirit as Christian you should not Church hop but rather find your position or post of duty where God wants to use you like Abraham your post of duty will be a place where you are blessed and where you will bless others Genesis 12:2 and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing those without a home church are acting like Cain the wanderer or vagabond Jude called those like Cain filthy unstable ones and wandering stars real Christians are not unstable movable tossed to and fro like a wave in the sea like Cain was Cain's wanderer condition repeats today when people reject regular church attendance and the fivefold preaching ministry detailed in ephesians 4 11 through 14 ephesians 4:14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive God's desire is for you to be a pillar in your local church because part of God's eternal reward for faithful Saints is to be made pillars in God's heavenly temple revelation 3:12 he that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out our church attendance must increase according to Hebrews 10:25 and so much the more as you see the Day approaching the more you invest into church the more benefit you will get out additionally Jesus taught in a letter to Thyatira that increasing service which would include church attendance and good works is the secret to Christianity and overcoming Satan revelation 2 19 and 26 I know thy works and charity and service and faith and my patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first and he they overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's through increased church attendance Christians constantly increase and godliness growing from glory to glory from faith to faith as the Book of Proverbs says there light shining brighter unto a perfect day Jesus's example most churchgoers may be surprised to know that Jesus Christ modeled faithful church attendance in Luke chapter 4 and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went on a fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read Jesus's customer habit was to faithfully attend the synagogue immediately after being freshly filled with the Holy Ghost like Christ a Holy Ghost field person today will be led by the Holy Spirit to faithfully attend church since Jesus faithfully attended church you should follow in his footsteps as a follower or imitator of God along with faithful church attendance Jesus had a zeal for God's house causing him to drive out the money changers at both the beginning and ending of his earthly ministry John - 14 and 15 and Luke 19 verses 45 to 46 all true Christians will have a zealous desire to worship Jesus in purity keeping the feast in sincerity and truth 1st Corinthians 5:8 let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth [Music] if you have any questions about having a home church please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
