TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to understand a quote from God's prophet brother William Brham from the masterpiece July 5th 1964. The quote says that the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection. So, by the grace of God, I'll be explaining how this quote agrees with the three works of grace. Recently, I've heard two preachers use this quote, which I believe they used it incorrectly, in order to promote a fourth work of grace, trying to make today's baptism of the Holy Ghost something different from the book of Acts chapter 2, which is wrong. Brother Ram said, "The fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride at the end time with thus sayeth the Lord in the church age book." So I felt burdened to make a video about this here by the grace of God to stand up for the three works of grace which brother Ram said was his message. &gt;&gt; If that ain't my message exactly today justification, sanctification, baptism and I was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk that highway. &gt;&gt; So friends, I heard a preacher here in America literally say there's four works of grace. That was his sermon title. Very sad sermon title. Of course, there's not four works of grace. There's only three works of grace. And then I heard another preacher from Africa who visited the US use this masterpiece quote to try to make today's Holy Ghost experience a further experience than the book of Acts. They're trying to make it a noneotional experience. He's trying to go beyond the original Holy Ghost baptism experience from the day of Pentecost. And of course, that's wrong. That's false doctrine. So, first let's look at this quote again in its fullness again from the masterpiece paragraph 136. Brother Ram's talking about the life in the stalk. And you'll hear him say, "Justification made a way for sanctification. Sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection. Back to the word again to manifest itself." Let's listen to the quote. Notice here the life that was in the husk in the stalk and in the tossel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other. Justification made a way for sanctification. Sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself. &gt;&gt; Now friends, let's make a few points here about this quote. Now, in the context of this sermon, it should be known that Brother Ram never said four stages in this sermon. You can look it up yourself. In fact, I only found two quotes that say four stages in the entire message. One is 1953. Brother Ram said Israel had four stages to Canaan or the promised land. Now, of course, later he corrected that and showed there was three stages. There was leaving Egypt, the wilderness was second, and then crossing Jordan into Canaan was the third work of grace. And then in restoration of the bride, brother Ram said there's four stages for Ezekiel's restoration of dry bones. And that is true. There are four stages. But brother Ram never repeated this teaching again and again as he did the three works of grace. So it seems like these are four works that relate to the 144,000 Israelis who receive Jesus and their blindness is taken away during the great tribulation period and they meet with the lamb on Mount Zion. It's the nation that's born in a day. The Bible said the Bible prophesied of it in the book of Isaiah. So that's the first point. If you look at the context of the masterpiece, brother Ram never said four stages. It's clear from the context. Brother Ram is talking about the Pentecostals and the Pentecostal denomination. For example, in paragraph 125, brother Ram said, "Now Pentecostal brethren throughout the nations, I want you to listen my brother." And then he goes into how this is his masterpiece, the masterpiece of the wheat plant. So when brother Ram goes through the works of grace, he hits justification, sanctification, and then when he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost there, he's referring to the Isuza Street revival of 1906 and the Pentecostal denomination that followed it. Brother Brandon was not teaching four works of grace. And of course, I'll prove that a little later on in this video, but if you understand that context, then it makes sense. Justification, Martin Luther, sanctification, John Wesley, the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the restoration of the gifts with speaking in tongues, interpretation and so forth from Isuza Street, William Seymour's revival 1906. And that made a way for the Holy Ghost itself, which we believe the Holy Ghost itself is the original baptism of the Holy Ghost that the saints received on the day of Pentecost. The baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul, not just the gifts of the Holy Spirit. So that's the context of the sermon and what brother Ram was talking about. Also friends, if you look in the quotes of brother Random, overall in all the quotes, there are zero quotes that say four works of grace compared to four exact quotes that say three works of grace. And then there's over 140 quotes where brother Brennham uses justification, sanctification, and baptism of the Holy Ghost in the same sentence. So basically, you have two quotes that say four stages versus over 140 that speak of the three works of grace. And then friends, consider this. If someone goes to four works of grace, they break all the types from the Bible that Brother Brandham preached about there being only three works of grace. So here's a chart from my 2021 book. There's eight examples of three works of grace. man's natural birth, man's spiritual birth, Israel's exodus, the tabernacle's cleansing in their in its three courts, the earth's cleansing, Ezekiel's prophecy, the growing wheat plant, and Jesus as the way to heaven. The one we want to focus on is the growing wheat plant from Mark 4:28. Friends, Jesus Christ himself said there's only three stages to the wheat plant. The blade, the ear, and the full corn. So, anyone that preaches four works of grace is going against the words of the Lord Jesus from Mark 4:28. And remember that was brother Brandham's masterpiece in the masterpiece sermon, the life of the wheat plant, justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul. The same Holy Ghost experience Peter, James, John, and all the saints received on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2. Now, let's prove this a little further. Let's again go back to the context of this quote. So, brother Ram said, "The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection." That's paragraph 136. Now, I want to show you before this quote, Brother Random said there's three different processes, not four different processes. So, you're going to see before this quote and after this quote, Brother Random says three only three processes, only three stages, not four. So before the quote in paragraph 136 if you go up two quotes above that in paragraph 134 brother Ram says stock tassel seed the life that come out of the original seed come up through different processes three different processes he said hallelujah oh my I'm the happiest person in the world that God has let me see this let's listen to the quote &gt;&gt; notice here the life that was in the stalk tossle all now ends up in The seed, the life that come out of the original seed, come up through different processes, three different processes, and then turns back to its original condition. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, my happiest person in the world that God has let me see this. Watch how perfect the word and these nature works together. &gt;&gt; And then friends, now there's four quotes after the Holy Ghost itself quote where brother Ram says there's only three works of grace. The first is paragraph 138. He says, "How many ever seen a seed of wheat start to grow? See the three stages stalk, tassel, and the pollen." So again, notice right after he says justification, sanctification, baptism, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost itself, which looks like four, but it's not four. Brother Ram says, "See the three stages." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; And anybody, how many ever seen a seed of wheat start to grow? What's the first little thing? It's just exact like the seed, but it's a husk. See the three stages? Stalk, tsel, or the pollen. than the husk. And then out of the husk comes the original seed. &gt;&gt; Not a seed. It was the life of the seed growing through this to come to the seed. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? What is it? A resurrection. &gt;&gt; Coming back to a masterpiece again like the one that went in. Then a few paragraphs later in paragraph 152, brother Ram said, "But remember after the husk, that's three stages we know of. There's nothing else left but the grain." So again, not four stages, three stages. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; And when Pentecost saw it, they sounded a trumpet. It's time for the return of the gifts. See what they did? They sounded trumpet and out they come. Then they organized. But remember, after the husk, that's three stages we know of, there's nothing else left but the grain. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; And then the grain is put out of all of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Seed words begins to form itself. Life is brought forth out of. Now notice if the bridegroom the beginning the first bridegroom this is a bride coming forth. Then friends in the next paragraph 153 brother Ram says that it went from that organization it went into another organization went into another stage of the word justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost. So again he lists three not four. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Remember the church began at Pentecost. And it fell at Naa. It sprouted not like the real grain. No, it was some of the life in there, but it sprouted in order to make an organization. And it pulled through that organization. And then what did it do? Then it went from that organization, it went into another organization, went into another stage of the word, justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. See, and as it went through this stalking process, it kept coming on more. And then finally in paragraph 160, brother Ram says, "The bride is smitten from the church because she is the word. There is your stages again. One, two, three." See, just exactly. So again, brother Ram says, "Exactly three stages, not four stages." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; She is smitten from the church, from the church body. Smitten with her master for the same purpose. She's the word. The same as Joseph is smitten from his brethren because he was the word. And Jesus is smitten from his brethren because he was the word. The church is smitten. The bride is smitten from the church because she is the word. &gt;&gt; There's your stages again. 1 2 3. &gt;&gt; In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I want you to know friends, this is not a I'm smarter than you video. I'm trying to be humble. I'm trying to stand for the original faith that was once delivered to the saints, the three works of grace. This video is made in love. It's made as a warning. Of course, whenever I address false doctrine, I rarely call the preachers's name. I don't like to call the preacher's name, but I do want to give warnings and try to help people by the grace of God. And as I said earlier, there was two preachers that talked about this quote and misused it. The first said, "There's four works of grace." I haven't heard any other sermons that preacher preached, but this other brother from Africa, I've heard numerous sermons he's preached. And he's using this quote from the masterpiece to say that the baptism of the Holy Ghost today is not the same as it was in Acts chapter 2. He's trying to preach a Holy Ghost that does not have any emotion or any sensation. And friends, I know we're not looking for emotion. I know we're not looking for sensation, but the Holy Ghost always has emotion. It always has sensation. When a person's soul is being born again, brother Ram said, could you imagine a baby being born and the mother not know it? At the instant of receiving the Holy Ghost or the baptism of the Holy Ghost, is there a difference? Does a person speak with tongues? If not always, what manifestation is known? Well, could you imagine a mother giving birth to a baby and not knowing it? She'd have to be unconscious not to know it. Neither can you receive the Holy Ghost without knowing it. There's something takes place in you. See, there's something that changes you. Your whole system, your whole spiritual system is made new again. And you become a new creature in Christ. As the Bible puts it, a new creation in Christ. You know it. &gt;&gt; So friends, I feel burdened about this second preacher. He has said something like this. Now, I couldn't find it where I heard it, but I heard him say, "You're not just an amateur god. You're God." Friends, that's bride pride. That's bride worship. That's exalting human beings. We are not God. We are the offspring of God. We're the sons and daughters of God. But this man plainly said, "We are not amateur gods." I don't even like to use that terminology as far as amateur gods because you won't find that in the Bible. I know the word of God came to gods. the Bible said and as Jesus said, but that's referring to prophets and and not all of us are prophets. And if you look at the Hebrew meaning of that word, it's judges or rulers. Well, that makes sense. The word gods then would be just judges or rulers. The word of God came to the judges. The word of God came to the rulers, the human judges and rulers that God placed on this earth. And then this preacher from Africa said, quote, "How are you going to be God?" End quote. If petty things bother you and make you question God, like losing a child or a husband, this was a very insensitive statement. It seems like this preacher has never lost a child or never lost a spouse or never suffered any tragedy. It's downplaying the feeling of loss that people go through. And again, it's exalting the church members, the message believers, telling them they are God. And then he went on to say, quote, "The equality of man and God, co-equality that was lost in the beginning." End quote. Friends, that's the original lie from the serpent in the Garden of Eden. This message preacher, as popular as he is, is putting the bride on the same level as God. And that's a sin. That's false doctrine. Again, that's the same lie the serpent told Eve in Genesis 3:es 4 and 5. Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. Friends, I believe in the full baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul of the believer. I believe we're the offspring of God. I believe we're ambassadors for God, as second Corinthians tells us. I believe we're one with God. In other words, the same spirit, the same nature, but we only have a measure of the Holy Ghost. Jesus Christ has the fullness of the Holy Ghost. We are not equal to the Lord Jesus Christ. The servant is not equal to his master. As the Lord Jesus Christ said himself, the servant is not greater than the master. The Lord Jesus Christ is the master. And again, friends, this preacher from Africa, he's attacking Acts chapter 2. I've heard numerous sermons where he attacks emotion, experience, gifts. He's inbalanced. And as I showed on my last video in the middle of the road, he is very far on the side of intellect, which is a very sad place to be in. and he might even be off in the grass in the foolish virgin area. Brother Ram said the Holy Ghost will give the same sensation, the same signs, the same wonders, the same experience. Today, we get the same baptism of the Holy Ghost they received on the day of Pentecost. And that is enough. It's the fullness of Pentecost in the bride. Let's listen to a quote where brother M says this. The same Holy Ghost, same experience, same sensation. &gt;&gt; And now it's right to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; The same ministry, the same Jesus, &gt;&gt; the same power, the same Holy Ghost, the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today &gt;&gt; from glory to glory to glory and back to its original seat with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs, same wonders, same baptism, same kind of people acting the same way with the same power, the same sensation. It's from glory unto glory. and the next will be changed from this glory into a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him. &gt;&gt; Friends, we must earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints. The enemy creeps in unawares and just brings slight changes to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, slight changes to the message of the hour, and even uses quotes from our prophet to try to change the Bible truths. But that's why the Bible said, "Prove all things." That's why brother said, "Test me by the scripture." That's why brother Ram said the Bible is the absolute and God's absolute is the Bible. You'll never find four works of grace in the Bible. People try to find it in different areas. As we said, they try to create it in their own minds. But if you look at the overall picture of the Bible and the quotes from brother Brandham, there's only three works of grace. Friends, if you're not born again, repent of your sins. Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Continue serving God faithfully in a local home church. God will sanctify your life. That means purify your life, cleanse your life. You'll start living separate and sanctified from the world. You get your new heart from justification, new spirit from sanctification. Your daily thoughts and habits will change, be more holy, and then God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul. In Ezekiel 36, it's called my spirit. So God gives you a new heart, a new spirit of your own, and then God's spirit. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed. [Music]
