TRANSCRIPT
========================================
problem number five God sent us a prophet to warn us of this air with thus sayeth the Lord God has always sent prophets to the Earth to warn the people with thus sayth the Lord before judgment strikes during the 20th century God sent a prophet to the Earth by the name of William brandham we have a teaching video that highlights and shows three of his prophecies that have either come to pass already or are in the process of coming to pass right now this video shows that he was a genuine prophet of God who spoke in the name of the Lord because we are living in the last days and the end of the world is so near God had to send a prophet named William brandham to restore the truths of the Bible to the hearts of the people one of those truths that was to be restored was the teaching on the godhead in 1961 William brandham spoke in the name of the Lord that trinitarianism is of the devil notice that this prophet of God did not say all trinitarians are going to hell this Prophet believed trinitarians were Christians but they were sincerely wrong about the godhead let's listen to this word from the Lord now my precious brother I know this is a tape also now don't get excited let me say this with Godly love the hours approach where I can't hold still on these things no more too close to the coming see trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus sayith the Lord amen look where it come from it come from the N seeeing Council when the Catholic church becom in rulership the word Trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the Bible and it's far as three Gods that's from Hell there's one God it's exactly right now do you say then you believe it all these people as trinitarians are of hell no sir I believe they are Christi but the hour is approaching brother where they are sin sin cely wrong the Trinity Doctrine is simply a misinterpretation an addition to the word a false Doctrine and a deception God never said he was three persons God never asked us to rotate tritheism into our worship God never asked us to add anything to the word of God we understand that the statement trinitarianism is of the devil may be very difficult for most trinitarians to hear so that is why we made this teaching video to highlight seven major problems not just one or two that we have with the Trinity Doctrine in order to help Open the Eyes of the people to the devil's addition to the Bible on this Doctrine recall where this Doctrine came from it came from men who were not writers of the Bible and they used impure words that are not found in the Bible and recall that a prominent scholar today encourages Christians to understand the Trinity as tritheism at times which is the worship of three Gods we humbly ask that you seek God through honest prayer and through much study of the Bible before siding with the Creeds of men and denominations may you choose to take sides with God's word on the topic of the godhead we are thankful for the truth God has restored to us through his Prophet William brandham and we pray it will be a blessing to your heart and mind problem number six trinitarian authors did not affirm that the Holy Spirit was divine until 381 ad this is another proof that the Bible writers had greater Revelation on the godhead than the Catholic authors and writers of the Trinity Doctrine the original apostles who were filled with the spirit around 33 to 34 ad immediately knew that the Holy Spirit was divine yet trinitarian writers and followers did not affirm this until 381 a in Acts 5: 3 and 4 the New Testament writer used the words Holy Spirit and God interchangeably proving that the early Apostles and Bible writers knew the Holy Spirit was and is God acts 53 and 4 but Peter said ananas why has Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land whilst it remained was it not th thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou has not light unto men but unto God problem number seven there are numerous errors in the Trinity doctrine that contradicts scripture we will share a few of these heirs contradiction number one the man-made athonian Creed says that Jesus was of the father alone meaning that the Holy Ghost was not the father of Jesus but this is an he because the Bible teaches that Jesus was conceived of the Holy Ghost in Matthew 1:20 so what is the truth the truth is that the Bible reveals the father and the Holy Spirit as the self-same person not two separate persons Jesus said the father is Holy in John 17:11 Jesus also said God the father is a spirit in John 4:24 that makes the father a Holy Spirit According To Jesus so the statement that the son is of the father alone is only true when a Believer understands that the father and the Holy Spirit are the self-same person not two separate persons the one who conceives a child is the Father the athonian Creed denies the Holy Spirit as the father of Jesus annulling Matthew 1:20 contradiction number two the man-made athonian Creed says in this Trinity none is greater or less than another but the Bible teaches that the father is greater than the Flesh of Jesus according to John 14 verse 28 because the Flesh of Jesus was Mortal during his Earthly Ministry but God the father is a spirit and has been and always will be immortal according to 1 Timothy 1:17 and 1 Timothy 6:16 Believers must also admit that the Flesh of Jesus did not have complete omniscience for the Bible teaches that there is knowledge that Jesus does not know Mark 13:32 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the Angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father contradiction number three the man-made athanasian Creed says we worship one God in Trinity but the Bible teaches that God must be worshiped in spirit and in truth and since the word Trinity and the definition are not found in the words of the Bible they cannot be the the right Spirit or truth Jesus said Thy word is truth in John 17:17 contradiction number four the man-made athonian Creed says that God is three persons but the Bible teaches that the father is the holy spirit which decreases their total down to only two persons then their total number of persons will be decreased down to only one because the Bible also teaches that the son is the image of the person of the father according to Hebrews 1:3 and Colossians 1:15 Jesus the son was not a second separate person from the father because the Bible never called him that he was simply the image of the person of the Father the Bible calls Jesus Emmanuel meaning God With Us not a second person but God himself Jesus was the person of God the Father manifest In the Flesh according to 1 Timothy 3: 16 if you would like more information about how the trinitarian doctrine contradicts the word of God and if you'd also like more teaching about the truths of the godhead according to scripture alone please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
