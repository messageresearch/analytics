[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] happy to see today is our first Pastor
[0:06] brother James Jones from Indianapolis
[0:08] back there
[0:10] and the pastor was weakling enough to
[0:13] let him get by with it
[0:15] shame on the pastors that fails his hand
[0:17] out in their Church
[0:27] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ this is part
[0:31] three of a three-part series proving
[0:34] that Jim Jones did not believe the Bible
[0:36] revelations that God gave to his true
[0:38] Prophet brother William Branham in Parts
[0:41] one and two we covered the first four
[0:44] sections we covered the accusation and
[0:47] character of brother Brown's accusers
[0:49] then we showed Brothers quote about Jim
[0:52] Jones and their Association third we
[0:55] showed brother branham's nine sermon
[0:57] warnings to Pastor Jim Jones and his
[1:00] associate pastors and then we saw in
[1:03] part four historical facts about Jim
[1:06] Jones
[1:07] this video will cover the fifth and
[1:08] final section called a summary
[1:11] contrasting Jim Jones and brother
[1:13] Branham
[1:16] before beginning on these 22 proofs let
[1:20] me add another disclaimer about this
[1:21] video this video is for adults only due
[1:24] to the sensitive nature of some of these
[1:26] quotations from Jim Jones where he
[1:28] speaks about his adulteries and
[1:30] fornications as well as his mandate for
[1:33] his 900 followers to commit
[1:36] revolutionary suicide
[1:40] summary contrasting Jim Jones and
[1:43] brother Branham
[1:46] in this final section I'll give 22
[1:48] contrast between Jim Jones and brother
[1:50] Branham proving that Jim Jones did not
[1:53] believe the bible-based message and
[1:55] Revelation that God gave to his true
[1:57] Prophet brother William Branham
[2:00] the first contrast is that Jim Jones was
[2:02] a mass murder responsible for over 900
[2:05] deaths
[2:06] here's the infamous sad quote from Jim
[2:09] Jones wherein he's influencing his 900
[2:12] plus followers to commit the act of
[2:15] revolutionary suicide
[2:30] the conditions of an inhumane world
[2:34] contrast that with brother Branham who
[2:36] was a holy ghost-filled Christian and
[2:38] even as a Young Man the Holy Ghost
[2:40] protected brother Branham so that he did
[2:41] not murder the young boys that bullied
[2:43] him as he talked about in questions and
[2:46] answers part 4 1964.
[2:59] 9
[3:06] 5
[3:10] [Music]
[3:17] [Music]
[3:18] I've been a murderer
[3:22] the second contrast is that Jim Jones
[3:25] constantly use cuss words with his
[3:27] congregation most of Jim Jones
[3:29] recordings are just incredibly hard to
[3:31] listen to and I hope by God's grace I
[3:34] won't listen to any more of them but I
[3:35] felt I had to for the sake of Defending
[3:37] God's prophet and God's message of this
[3:39] day and of course contrast Jim Jones
[3:42] filthy mouth with brother Adam's clean
[3:45] mouth brother man was a true servant of
[3:47] God he did not use swear words with his
[3:50] congregation Jim Jones had the filthiest
[3:53] mouth I have ever heard from any person
[3:55] again showing the contrast between Jim
[3:58] Jones darkness and brother random light
[4:00] the Gospel of Jesus Christ has shined
[4:02] into brother Ram's heart and life
[4:04] unbelievable
[4:09] and the reason she's smoke and drinking
[4:12] is constantly do the things you do is
[4:15] because you are an unbeliever
[4:20] the third contrast was Jim Jones was
[4:22] addicted to drugs nearly every website
[4:24] reports this and brother Branham lived a
[4:27] clean holy life he was not addicted to
[4:29] drugs
[4:31] fourth Jim Jones believed he was God
[4:33] brother Ram did not claim to be God
[4:36] here's some audio from Jim Jones saying
[4:38] he was God and that he was the Lord that
[4:41] appeared in the plains of mamry Unto
[4:43] Abraham
[4:48] [Music]
[4:49] as
[5:03] [Music]
[5:12] [Music]
[5:15] of all religious appeal
[5:19] in all the gifts of faculties
[5:25] [Music]
[5:31] all of the condescending savior images
[5:34] that you have
[5:36] been married
[5:42] [Music]
[5:44] Solomon said his hair was as black as a
[5:46] raven
[5:47] [Music]
[5:51] those days
[5:58] [Music]
[6:05] the fifth contrast is Jim Jones believed
[6:07] in reincarnation and brother Branham did
[6:09] not here's audio from Jim Jones saying
[6:11] he's already planned out when his mind
[6:13] would transmigrate to a different body
[6:15] in order to sit upon his throne in case
[6:18] he died of a stroke let's listen to
[6:21] these lies
[6:23] [Music]
[6:31] are disabled they're only a matter of
[6:34] hours
[6:45] already gone over
[6:47] this there'll be someone else sitting in
[6:49] this seat
[6:52] the sixth contrast is Jim Jones was a
[6:55] whoremonger a sexual pervert an
[6:57] adulterer and bisexual Jim Jones would
[7:00] brag about having over 30 adulteries in
[7:03] one night and one audio Source says he
[7:05] could commit adultery with all the
[7:07] people that needed it in one night and
[7:09] he had more adulteries to deal with than
[7:11] anyone else in the whole Community then
[7:13] he threatened to lay with every woman in
[7:15] the community proving he was a sick
[7:18] whoremonger
[7:27] have that opportunity and I got more sex
[7:30] to deal with than any of you got to deal
[7:31] with
[7:32] remember you've had the problem but all
[7:34] that I've never been able to have sex
[7:36] without responsibility
[7:39] it was just a simple sexual matter you
[7:41] could just instead of counselor and just
[7:43] go down I could take care of people who
[7:45] need to feel good about control that
[7:46] take care of the other night
[7:48] I don't think that's what people need I
[7:51] think they need something more than
[7:52] maybe social acceptance begins there
[7:55] contrast that with brother Branham who
[7:57] lived a holy life he lived true to his
[7:59] first wife before she passed sister hope
[8:01] and then he lived true to Sister Mita
[8:03] during their entire marriage until his
[8:05] death
[8:06] seventh Jim Jones believed he had the
[8:09] Fountain of Youth brother Branham did
[8:11] not
[8:12] here's audio from Jim Jones saying if he
[8:14] did not take on everyone's problems he
[8:16] would never age let's listen to the LIE
[8:22] [Music]
[8:24] married
[8:26] because I have to take on everybody's
[8:29] problems
[8:31] I would never age
[8:33] I think I could read it I've got the
[8:36] keys
[8:37] I I really got the keys to immortality
[8:40] but instead of keeping it I'm opening up
[8:43] as much as I can for you
[8:47] but the risk is in opening it for you
[8:50] I lose it for myself
[8:53] and I don't mind that whatsoever if you
[8:55] become what I am in principle
[8:58] if you become the kind of sensitive
[9:00] being that I am then I'm happy to lose
[9:02] my life
[9:06] something you think it's easy being God
[9:09] I can help people I
[9:14] eighth Jim Jones made a false prophecy
[9:17] about a nuclear attack saying what
[9:19] happened in 1967 it did not come to pass
[9:21] and brother Ryan was a genuine Prophet
[9:23] all of his prophecies did come to pass
[9:26] and will come to pass by the grace of
[9:28] God and I have numerous videos about
[9:29] these prophecies
[9:31] ninth Jim Jones made a false prophecy
[9:33] about brother Branham being decapitated
[9:35] at his death I already went over that
[9:37] and this was covered earlier in the
[9:39] video
[9:40] 10th Jim Jones said the people couldn't
[9:42] live without him this was from Jim Jones
[9:44] Infamous death tape and of course this
[9:47] was Jim Jones exalting himself as equal
[9:49] to God and brother Brown never said this
[9:51] about himself at the end of the church
[9:53] age book brother random even said he did
[9:55] not come in his ministry to get people
[9:58] to follow him and brother Ram said he
[10:00] wasn't the only preacher he was just one
[10:02] Pebble on the beach and brother man said
[10:04] I won't always be your pastor
[10:06] one moment do I bring a message to the
[10:08] people that they may follow me or join
[10:10] my church or start some fellowship and
[10:13] organization
[10:14] I have never done that and will not do
[10:16] that now
[10:17] I have no interest in those things
[10:20] but I do have an interest in the things
[10:21] of God and people
[10:23] and if I can accomplish just one thing I
[10:25] will be satisfied
[10:27] that one thing is to see established a
[10:30] true spiritual relationship between God
[10:32] and Men or a man become New Creations in
[10:35] Christ filled with his spirit and live
[10:37] according to his word
[10:50] is more eligible more worthy more of
[10:55] anything to preach than me I'm just one
[10:58] little humble person lady
[11:00] [Music]
[11:03] see so it's just uh you know what I mean
[11:07] we don't want every part of man in it
[11:09] you forget anything about me I am your
[11:13] brother a sinners
[11:15] Sinners not fit to live that's exactly
[11:19] the truth I stand out to be a humble
[11:21] that's facts
[11:22] there's nothing in me not one sound
[11:25] thing at all
[11:26] but the grace of God has let my poor
[11:29] dimming lies look beyond the Kirk of
[11:33] pain and see those things
[11:35] no it's been long
[11:40] we won't always be standing here
[11:43] I won't always be your pastor
[11:48] it's making sure
[11:52] eleventh Jim Jones said socialism is the
[11:55] real hero let's listen to the audio of
[11:57] Jim Jones saying socialism is the hero
[12:11] [Applause]
[12:14] work but you're here with other contacts
[12:19] we're here because of some
[12:23] I don't know how to make these some some
[12:25] other hero
[12:27] and there shouldn't be any Heroes with
[12:28] socialism anyway
[12:30] you you
[12:32] what a contrast to brother Brandon
[12:34] brother Brandon said Jesus's return
[12:36] would solve the sin problem
[12:39] s
[12:48] and uh all these things are here to stay
[12:52] so coroner brother Branham Jesus is the
[12:54] real and only hero
[12:57] 12th Jim Jones was arrested for lewd
[12:59] sexual conduct by an undercover agent in
[13:02] California that was from a website so I
[13:04] don't have audio of that but of course
[13:06] brother Brandon was never arrested for
[13:08] any immoral thing brother Ram lived a
[13:10] Godly holy Christian Life
[13:13] 13th Jim Jones let women cut their hair
[13:16] wear pants wear makeup Etc here's a
[13:20] screenshot of one of the last Knights
[13:23] the Jonestown people were alive and
[13:25] here's a woman in pants
[13:30] now of course contrast this with brother
[13:32] Brandon brother Branham taught women
[13:34] should not wear pants they should wear
[13:35] skirts because of Deuteronomy 22 5.
[13:38] 14th Jim Jones broke down the nuclear
[13:41] family brother Branham did not I'm not
[13:43] going to play the audio of this but
[13:44] there's survivors from Jonestown and
[13:47] then family members of those people who
[13:48] died at Jonestown that talked about Jim
[13:51] Jones's tactics to break down the
[13:53] nuclear family Jim Jones encouraged the
[13:55] mothers to slightly abandon their
[13:57] children throughout the day and not hold
[13:59] them so that they would gain
[14:00] independence and allegiance to Jim Jones
[14:03] himself and of course brother Ram did
[14:05] not teach this again showing Jim Jones
[14:07] was a demon-possessed man
[14:09] 15th Jim Jones allowed fornication and
[14:12] adultery among his followers and brother
[14:15] Raynham did not here's audio of Jim
[14:18] Jones calling fornication shacking up
[14:21] with people he doesn't call it
[14:22] fornication as the Bible says and Jim
[14:25] Jones never uses the Bible to condemn it
[14:27] and then Jim Jones mandates that he get
[14:29] clear definitions about each
[14:31] relationship between a man and a woman
[14:33] so this proves that Jim Jones approved a
[14:36] fornication he approved of adulteries
[14:39] because he allowed them and just wanted
[14:41] to know which people were in a
[14:43] relationship
[14:49] situations and their responsibility
[14:52] if you are having a relationship
[14:57] are we living together
[15:00] if not if we're going to have
[15:02] relationships do not think together
[15:04] I will clear definitions of what those
[15:07] relationships are going to be
[15:09] you have a child you assume
[15:11] responsibility if you don't have a child
[15:12] that Nursery if you're a male and assume
[15:15] responsibility with children you wash
[15:18] diapers
[15:20] you deal with you
[15:23] 16th Jim Jones told people to call him
[15:26] father or dad and brother random forbade
[15:28] that brother Ram said it was man worship
[15:30] for a man to ask people to call him
[15:33] father here's audio of Jim Jones himself
[15:35] calling himself father Jones
[15:40] [Music]
[15:51] [Music]
[16:00] [Music]
[16:04] it's amazing
[16:23] [Music]
[16:26] 17th Jim Jones was a con man a swindler
[16:29] of millions of dollars from the people
[16:30] this is clear from all the websites and
[16:34] contrast this with brother Brandon who
[16:35] turned down millions of dollars in order
[16:37] to serve Jesus Christ humbly and
[16:39] reverently 18th Jim Jones physically and
[16:42] mentally tortured his congregants I
[16:45] couldn't find the audio of this but I've
[16:47] heard Jim Jones's own voice Warn and
[16:49] threatened the people in his
[16:51] congregation that he would throw them
[16:53] into the pit or leave them alone in the
[16:55] jungle so the animals could get them and
[16:57] then former members of people's Temple
[16:59] testify of Jim Jones electrocuting some
[17:03] of his members as torture and Punishment
[17:05] and that even happened in California
[17:06] before they moved down to South America
[17:09] and of course brother Ram did no evil
[17:11] like this brother man was a holy
[17:13] ghost-filled Christian a prophet of God
[17:15] brother Branham prayed for his
[17:17] congregants and did not physically hurt
[17:19] them
[17:20] 19th Jim Jones said his people should be
[17:23] married to him and brother Braham did
[17:25] not teach this here's the audio of Jim
[17:27] Jones saying the people should be
[17:28] married to him
[17:32] First Alliance and first marriage should
[17:34] be to me
[17:44] instead of me as a basic ideal
[17:47] and I'm afraid of it
[17:50] now there is one quote where brother
[17:52] random said the Pastor is the husband
[17:55] spiritually speaking to the church but
[17:57] there's only one quote on this from how
[17:58] can I overcome 1963 and this is not a
[18:01] Bible teaching from Brother Branham he
[18:03] makes a statement out of a hypothetical
[18:05] story saying that Mrs Lott said all I
[18:09] have is my husband's word that sound is
[18:11] going to be destroyed but I want to stay
[18:13] in Sodom and have my hair cut so brother
[18:15] random said Mrs Lott wasn't heeding to
[18:18] the warning of her husband and brother
[18:20] Brown compared that to church members
[18:21] not taking heed to their pastors but of
[18:24] course this idea was just hypothetical
[18:27] the Bible teaches the pastor is Like a
[18:29] Shepherd to the Sheep the Bible doesn't
[18:32] teach that a pastor is like a husband to
[18:34] his wife so again we see a contrast
[18:36] between Jim Jones and brother Branham
[18:38] really Jim Jones wanted his people
[18:40] spiritually married to him and many of
[18:42] them were physically married to him
[18:44] through fornication through adulteries
[18:47] and this is opposite of brother Branham
[18:49] who like Saint Paul married the people
[18:50] Christ spiritually and brother bran was
[18:53] only physically married to one woman his
[18:55] wife 20th Jim Jones freely promoted
[18:58] birth control pills and brother random
[18:59] did not here's a quote from Jim Jones
[19:01] where he complains that the women are
[19:03] using up all the birth control pills
[19:06] foreign
[19:11] [Music]
[19:14] and Friends birth control pills many
[19:16] times cause abortions because they abort
[19:18] a fertilized egg so again the use of
[19:21] birth control pills shows a person is
[19:23] possessed with the spirit of murder They
[19:25] Don't Care About Life they only care
[19:26] about having the lust of the Flesh and
[19:28] don't want the results of a physical
[19:30] relationship which our children and God
[19:33] calls children God's Heritage and
[19:35] Friends brother Adam said the only right
[19:37] way for birth control is a woman
[19:39] charting her Cycles as brother Ram said
[19:42] in questions and answers part 3 1964 he
[19:45] said quote and there is a possibility of
[19:46] it being done in the right way I'd say
[19:49] it too for General there are so many
[19:51] days in a woman's life that she's not
[19:53] fertile you understand all right end
[19:56] quote
[19:57] what would you endorse birth control no
[20:01] I can't endorse it no sir
[20:05] how do you feel about birth control
[20:09] I had some of that on the interviews
[20:11] this morning uh brother Paul personally
[20:13] with you all know the same thing all
[20:15] those things there all these words and
[20:17] things that I have to say that I'd
[20:19] rather say if a husband and wife and
[20:21] there is a possibility of a
[20:25] for General there is so many days in a
[20:29] woman's life that she's not fertile
[20:31] you understand
[20:33] all right well now they sometimes that a
[20:36] child would kill a woman if she
[20:38] want to watch that too see so just be
[20:41] real careful about that see see that's
[20:43] bringing life for what you're Budget on
[20:45] Earth to do if your wife is
[20:47] sick and another child would kill her
[20:50] I wouldn't do it I don't think the Lord
[20:51] wants you to do it and you you come to
[20:53] me personally on them things you have
[20:55] your own private interview let me talk
[20:56] to you personally you see
[20:58] number 21 Jim Jones said children born
[21:01] in socialism were not born in sin and
[21:03] this is from a website of course brother
[21:05] Brown said the opposite brother Ram said
[21:07] quote all are born in sin brother random
[21:10] said at least 10 times everyone is born
[21:11] in sin
[21:16] no more
[21:25] and now when Jesus died a Calvary he
[21:29] took away the sins of the world
[21:32] and 22nd Jim Jones said you become a God
[21:36] and Jim Jones said the only God you need
[21:39] is in you
[21:44] I'll show you that you can bring
[21:46] yourself up
[21:47] your own bootstraps
[21:53] [Music]
[21:59] you can jump our races
[22:00] [Music]
[22:07] [Music]
[22:08] but that's my only purpose of being here
[22:11] so here Jim Jones Is Now allowing his
[22:13] members to become Gods which is false
[22:17] but then Jim Jones makes himself the
[22:19] highest God so Jim Jones was teaching
[22:22] self-worship now friends it's true
[22:24] Christ is in us the hope of glory
[22:26] according to Colossians chapter 1 but
[22:28] Jesus Christ is both in heaven and in us
[22:31] in our souls by the baptism of the Holy
[22:34] Ghost and so Jim Jones is taking God out
[22:36] of heaven and putting it all inside the
[22:38] Believers and we can't do that brother
[22:40] never taught that God is both in us and
[22:43] God's spirit is so great is divided
[22:45] amongst the Believers and yet God's
[22:47] spirit is also in the body of Jesus
[22:49] Christ on the throne of God in heaven so
[22:52] Jim Jones taught people to worship
[22:53] themselves make themselves God and of
[22:56] course brother Graham did not teach this
[22:59] in closing
[23:01] I hope this short Series has been a
[23:03] blessing friends to defend God's Prophet
[23:05] brother William Branham and prove
[23:07] hopefully once and for all that Jim
[23:09] Jones did not believe the bible-based
[23:11] teachings of brother William Branham
[23:14] if you have any questions concerns or
[23:16] testimonies about this video please
[23:18] contact me
[23:20] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:22] the desire of your heart
[23:25] foreign
