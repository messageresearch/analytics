TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you just got to mark it down we are coming into a religious persecution with the same things that they did in Pagan Rome many years ago for thus sayith the Lord greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to respond to a viewer's question about what were my thoughts on the results from the 202 for US presidential election so in this video I'll share my thoughts on that and also where I think we are prophetically in Revelation to the Rapture hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Marin and brandham I also defend brother Rams Godly Christian character so in this video I'll go through my reactions second Where We Are prophetically according to my humble opinion and third other thoughts so first of all my reaction to the results of President Trump getting reelected my first reaction was I was totally surprised and I was surprised because of what happened in 2020 I thought it was going to be a repeat remember in 2020 the results were delayed 4 days and there was many ballot drops so I got to be careful what words I use here on YouTube but it seems like there were some strange things happening with the 2020 presidential election there were massive ballot drops in the middle of the night and all the ballot drops seemed to go in the same direction So based upon all those strange things that happened in the 2020 election I thought it would repeat but I would say I was pleasantly surprised to see President Trump reelected of course mainly because of his stance for Israel remember he moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem during his first term and the Bible says anyone that blesses Israel God will bless that could also be why it seems president Trump's life was spared from the multiple assassination attempts upon his life so yes first I was surprised that President Trump won in a landslide I'm very grateful though because from 2021 to 20124 Democrats carried out probably what was the worst Christian persecution in United States history here in the United States it began with cancel culture and then the federal agencies seemed to be we ized against President Trump and not only him but many conservatives even individuals who would just pray outside of certain clinics and again I have to be very careful what I say Here on YouTube and also there were innocent protesters wrongfully arrested and all this has been proven over the course of these last four years so that's my first reaction just surprised it's also important to keep in mind that President Trump has not been inaugurated yet that's January 20th if I'm not mistaken so so anything could happen before that time we we don't know for sure so moving on to where we are prophetically I recently put out a video about are there any verses Left to be fulfilled before the Rapture and of course I believe there are brother random said that in spoken word Original Seed 1962 so as ministers were doing our best to see where we are prophetically by the scriptures we know there are still Jews returning to their Homeland to fulfill Jeremiah 31:10 so that's still being fulfilled we know the Great Commission to the Gentiles to save Gentiles with the gopel of Jesus Christ is still being fulfilled as I said in my previous video you know last year I just saw 17 former Amish Believers be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and receive this message so they're receiving the former Reign which is brother br's Ministry from Joel 223 through 26 brother bram's Ministry is the former Reign and then the latter Reign is rapturing Faith that's all what we're waiting for that's all what we're longing for to have faith to have our bodies change in a moment twinkling of an eye so we can see the Great Commission to the Gentiles is still being fulfilled Revelation 10 8-11 Matthew 2414 Luke 2124 and 2 Peter 3:9 thirdly and probably most easily to see is Matthew 24 6-8 all these birth pains are still going to continue as I said earlier 2021 2024 under this current United States leadership has been the hardest birth pain against Christians Matthew 24 6-8 says says there'll be Wars rumors of wars earthquakes in diverse places pestilences which I believe Co fulfilled and so one possibility is that if they do allow president Trump to be inaugurated and serve out his ter this could be a time of a relaxation from the birth pains a time of rest in between contractions but I don't know for sure again we don't know what's going to happen but we know there's Wars still going on right Israel Hamas Russia Ukraine so these are all birth pains leading up to the birth of a new day the millenni and of course The Birth of a Nation Israel being birthed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost 144,000 Jews being sealed in their foreheads then fourth and finally this main scripture brother Ram gave us Revelation 13:16 he causes all the Beast causes all to take a mark so they cannot buy or sell without the mark brother R use this verse to show the bride will be forced to stop preaching before the Rapture I believe someday the real bride of Christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of God the Bible prophesies of it in Revelations 13:16 if you want to put it down denominations will force it to stop or take its Mark then when the lamb will take his bride and judge the for this this is the main verse I'm looking for for to be fulfilled right before the Rapture this will tell me the squeezes on when message preachers are forced to stop preaching I still have the freedom to preach thank God for that praise God for the freedoms that we have but this verse helps us see where we are prophetically if we're still preaching then we know there's still a little more labor to be done in the fields people are still being saved people are still being filled with the Holy Ghost people are still being delivered and healed by Divine Healing and miracles God's truth is still marching on so these scriptures help us see where we are prophetically there's still more work to be done God is still saving God is still healing God wants us to keep preaching the gospel Jews are still returning to their Homeland and so forth and so then finally here's some other thoughts perhaps if God does allow Trump to take office and fulfill this term perhaps this is a time for the religious unity of the Beast to be fulfilled I'm not sure but that's what it looks like it could be brother Ram tells us the squeeze will come when the World Council of churches unites with the United States government in order to change the laws the Temptation will come as follows The ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all might be one becomes so strong politically that she Bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law so that no people will be re recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this Council little groups will lose Charters privileges Etc until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people for example right now unless the local Ministerial Association approves in many if not most cities one cannot rent a building for religious services to become chaplain in the armed services hospitals Etc it is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to the trinitarian ecumenical groups as this pressure increases and it will it will be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege and so many will be tempted to go along for they will feel it is better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization then not to serve God at all publicly but they er to believe the devil's lie is to serve Satan even though you may want to call him Jehovah but the elect will not be deceived furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image erected to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture and this little delightful Winsome movement that started out in fellowship at Ephesus will become the monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world for the church system of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant in coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby they would make a living this will be accomplished simply for the harlot's daughters are all but gone back to her in the meantime Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds and all the paper at the right time the Harlot will destroy the present day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold with no gold the system Falls the Jews will be trapped and come into the alliance and the Harlot Church will take over the whole world so perhaps these conservative leaders getting in Trump and JD Vance perhaps that's a a sign that that religions are going to unite more and more it's possible because one thing I noticed was JD Vance is a Catholic and his wife is Hindu and I saw a video I just can't find it but I saw a video of them saying they're all going towards the same place or they're all on the same path or something like that that's the deception of universalism the Hindu gods are not true gods there's only one God that's the Lord Jesus Christ and so that could be one reason God allowed Trump to get in no doubt because he honors Israel but also because people have to be anointed to fulfill the rest of the scripture which is the religious unity the one world religion that must eventually come upon the Earth it's also important to keep in mind brother Ram said with thus sayith the Lord that the same Roman persecution that was upon the early Christians will repeat here in the United States so it seems like as we've seen 3 or 4 years of Christian persecution through weaponized departments in the federal government perhaps that was the first birth pain towards the Christian persecution that brother Bram prophesied of and also what's prophesied in Revelation 13 so let's listen that quote from brother brandom it's thus sayith the lord well you just got to mark it down we are coming into a religious persecution with the same things that they did in Pagan Rome many years ago for it's thus sayeth the Lord also friends remember brother BR told us to watch the purple curtain watch Russia so we're doing that as well so these are my thoughts on the results from the 2024 election here in the United States of course I'd like to hear your thoughts as well many times the comments are very helpful perhaps I'll make a part two on this video we'll see how the comments go by God's grace but I appreciate this question I thought I'd share it perhaps it'd be a blessing to the Saints by the grace of God remember the Lord Jesus Christ tells us to always watch and pray that will be worthy to escape the judgments that will come upon the Earth of course the Bride of Jesus Christ will be forgiven she'll be purged during her life she'll be cleansed during her life so she won't need Purge during the Great Tribulation period thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ if you have any questions or concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
