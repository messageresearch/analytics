TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's just made it read s and yes [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show the 15th lie coming out of Branham Tabernacle which is prophets are not judged or profits cannot be corrected or profits do not make mistakes friends I'll be playing two audio clips as evidence of this lie along with sharing two blog posts and a cub Corner magazine as evidence of this lie let's briefly review the 14 previous lies lie number one every word on tape is thus saith the Lord the tapes can never be wrong the tapes have no mistakes the tapes have every answer lie number two all the answers are on the tapes lie number three random Tabernacle claims we must unquestionably believe every word on the tape is thus say if the Lord even if brother Branham lied is that all churches must catch a false vision of a denominational mandate to play the tapes and every church is a tape Church the fifth lie is the tapes are the token and being part of a tape church is the token the sixth lie is Tate boys are the true fifo Ministry and tapes are number one in the five full ministry the seventh lie is brother branham's Spear and soul are identical to Jesus's spirit and soul the eighth lie is that brother Branham has a living Ministry and anyone who doesn't believe that is a Demas the ninth lie is that revelation 22 verse 16 is Jesus telling us all to be taped churches the tenth lie is that the angel of revelation 22 verses 6 through 9 and verse 16 is brother Branham the 11th lie is that brother and tapes are the absolute the 12th lie is that anyone who does not play tapes is a make-believer and unbeliever the 13th lie is that thus saith the Lord Branham Tabernacle is in the perfect will of God by playing tapes and decreasing living preachers and the 14th lie is that Branham Tabernacle are the greatest people of all time brother Branham is the greatest prophet of all time and Branham tabernacle's current Pastor has the greatest Ministry and that brother random son is the most blessed person on Earth now let's look at the 15th lie but before we get into that I want to reference my 95th video it's about a 33 minute long video and it's called brother branham's Human Side welcomed correction and answer the question who are you to correct God's prophet this video was released December 28 2021 so if you'd like a full teaching about how brother Brandon welcome correction and actually receive correction from numerous people please watch that video with an honest humble heart and you will see both Bible proof from numerous prophets in the bible such as Moses Elijah Saint Paul Saint Peter numerous other prophets that receive correction and were corrected and also numerous examples of other random receiving correction from people who are not even prophets like his wife and brother Sherrod so let's look at the first audio evidence of this live the first audio evidence is from a sermon preliminary by Branham Tabernacles current Pastor he says quote Nolan judges a prophet no one corrects his word this is and this isn't what a mess end quote I'll play this audio in a moment but notice Bram Tabernacles Pastor is trying to say no one can judge his father in order to deified his father and deify every word on his father's tapes if no one is to judge anything on tape then that would mean no one has the gift of discernment and if that's the case then Branham Tabernacle is guilty of taking away from the word of God they're guilty of deleting one of the nine gifts of the holy spirit according to First Corinthians chapter 12. and the Branham Tabernacle deletes the gift of discernment then it's possible their names could be deleted out of the book of life according to revelation 22 verses 18 and 19 because we cannot delete even one word of the revelation of Jesus Christ so I'll play the audio now of random tabernacle's current Pastor saying no one judges a prophet but immediately after I'm going to play three quotes of God's Prophet brother Branham inviting the people to judge him and his ministry as a prophet so again random Tabernacles contradicting their own Prophet they say no one judges a prophet and then brother Ram says Judge Me by the word of God the first quotes from obey the voice of the Angel 1950 brother Branham says if these things that I have said come to pass then you believe God he says if they don't come to pass I am a false prophet he said that's fair to any congregation isn't it he says you judge according and he says look at it in the way you should as a Christian men and women and then you can pass your opinion and I'll pray that God will bless us and give us his presence notice brother random isn't angry when he's saying judge me according to the word of God he says that's being fair according to brother random there is a Fair way to judge a prophet and the way to fairly judge a prophet is to see if his prophecies come to pass so let's listen to the quotes back to back it can be no one judges the prophet no one corrects his word this is and this isn't what a mess they want to go back to the age behind us [Music] they do not come to Texas [Music] and you just let God use judged according don't be prejudiced uh try to just be forever and just come sit down and look at it in the way that you should as Christian men and women and then you can pass your opinion no one judges a prophet [Music] no one judges a prophet you judge according here's a second quote from Brother Branham Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Brandon invites the people to judge this meeting brother Graham says the way to judge is to use Deuteronomy chapter 18 verses 21-22 the way we know a prophet is if his word comes to pass brother Ram says judge it by your own self and by the word again brother I am saying this in kindness brother is not saying you can't judge me this is a second witness brother and a welcomed judgment he welcome correction he wanted people to be able to judge if he was a prophet or not and of course he was a genuine Prophet let's listen to the quotes back to back it can't be no one judges a prophet no one corrects his word this is and this isn't what a mess they want to go back to the age behind us and what he says comes to pass and hear him well I'm with him that's where to judge this meeting tonight if the word says so in the holy spirit's true it'll manifest it if it doesn't then it's not the holy spirit amen that's Judge it by your own self and by the word no one judges the prophet that's way to judge this meeting tonight judge it by your own self and by the word in the third quote from Abraham in a seat after him from 1961 brother random said God told them how to tell it to tell if a prophet was a genuine Prophet or not if what they say come to pass then it's right if it isn't it isn't now you be your own judge so again brother Brandon is telling the people to judge me I'm a prophet of God judge me on the basis of whether things come to pass or not so Branham tabernacle's Pastor is deceived he's not saying what his father said let's listen to the quotes back to back it can't be no one judges the prophet no one corrects his word this is and this isn't what a mess they want to go back to the age behind us signs and wonders proof whether it's right or not God told him how to tell it if what they say comes to pass then it's right if it is it isn't it now you be your own judge you better flee to God Pentecostal while you got a chance to I'll share two other quotes very quickly and have faith in God 1958 brother Branham says write it in the fly leaf of your Bible and say that brother Branham said so if it doesn't come to pass I'm a false prophet for I have thus saith the Lord brother was talking about God's anger against the United States but notice brother Brandon again welcome the people write down my prophecy Judge Me by whether it comes to pass or not well Iran was not afraid to be judged by the prophecies that the lord gave him that proved he was a genuine Prophet God's anger is handled against the nation and you're going to receive punishment and judgment rather than a fly lead to your Bible and said that brother Branham said so it doesn't come to pass I'm a false prophet for I have just stay at the law and then in spoken word original seat 1962 brother Ram said the elected is the only kind that will catch it the word of God brother Branham asked a hypothetical question well you say how do you know that you're not right brother Ram says then test me by the word come test your denomination by this word let's see who's right prove all things the Bible said so again brother Graham is inviting others come test me by the word come Judge Me by the word and let's see if the denomination is right or the Revelation Jesus Christ gave me as a prophet is right let's listen to the quote remember it's the elected is the only kind that'll catch it what do you say how do you know it you're not right then test me by the word come test your denomination by this word prove all things audio from Branham tabernacle's current pastor and in this audio the Branham Tabernacle Pastor corrects brother Branham and yet Branham tabernacle's pastor says no one corrects the prophet of God no one judges the prophet of God right I'm tabernacle's pastor said brother Branham thought the coming of the Lord was in his generation and there was nothing to hinder the coming of the Lord and then the Branham Tabernacle Pastor says that wasn't God's time for the coming and Branham tabernacle's Pastor is saying this is the time of Jesus's coming and friends this audio shows the spiritually blind state of Branham tabernacle's pastor and their entire church this is utter hypocrisy random Tabernacle claims they don't correct the prophet they don't judge the prophet and yet by their own words they're judging the prophet and saying the prophet's lifetime wasn't the time for the coming of the Lord God had the coming of Lord for a different time Branham Tabernacle is saying the coming of the Lord was hindered in brother branham's time even though brother random said he didn't see anything to hinder the coming of the Lord so let's play these three audio clips back to back we'll play random tabernacle's current Pastor saying no one can judge a prophet and then we'll play Brenham Tabernacles current Pastor judging the prophet correcting the profit brother Branham and then we'll play brother Ram's quote about how he did not see anything hindering the coming of the Lord during his lifetime let's listen to the quotes it can't be no one judges the prophet no one corrects his word this is and this isn't what a mess they want to go back to the age behind us and that the time that we're living in there's never been a time like this it wasn't for back there the same thing in the time brother Branham thought then and this is it he doesn't see nothing that's hindering it but God had a time and a plan thank God for that that's it no one corrects his word this is and this isn't brother Brandon thought then and this is it he doesn't see nothing that's hindering it but God had a time and a plan before moving on I do want to say it is true no one corrects a thus saith the Lord from a true Prophet like Moses Jeremiah Ezekiel Elijah Saint Paul Saint Peter brother Bradham but we do have to wait until the thus say the Lord comes to pass which is judging it and that's according to Deuteronomy 18 verses 21 and 22 and Jeremiah 28 verse 9. Deuteronomy 18 21 says if and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him brother random quotes this scripture almost verbatim and we would see Jesus July 12 1962 and brother Graham said quote that's the way Israel knowed their prophets end quote and then brother random went on to say that's how he can be judged as well because he was a prophet of God a prophet that fulfilled Malachi 4 5 and 6 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 Matthew 17 11 Amos 3 verses 7 and 8 and numerous other scriptures also Jeremiah 28 verse 9 says this Jeremiah said the prophet which prophesied the peace when the word of the Prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the Lord had truly sent him so again here's another Prophet so Moses said it now Jeremiah says it and of course brother Branham said it but all prophets are judged when there thus saith the Lord prophecies come to pass they're judged a genuine prophet of God and then each person has to judge that prophet in their own heart whether they'll receive it or reject it as brother random said he said that's making it fair every person has to judge a prophet of God and that's what acts 13 46 says then Paul Barnabas wax bold and I'll skip down to the end and the scripture says and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles so the Bible records that every person's reaction to the prophet of God judges each person if we receive it it judges us worthy of eternal life if we reject it it judges us Unworthy of everlasting life thank God we've received brother Branham as a genuine prophet of God he's turned our hearts back to the apostolic fathers he's pointing us back to Acts 2 38 for salvation and the baptism of the Holy Ghost back to Ephesians chapter 2 verses 8 through 10 we're saved by grace through faith it is a gift of God no man can boast to Salvation it's all Jesus Christ and so we've judged our own selves worthy of everlasting life by the grace of God now I want to move on to two blog posts the first is from April 10 2021 the pastor of Brenham Tabernacle wrote quote but the tapes can never be wrong end quote now friends this is a lie brother Branham said there's Mix-Ups on the tapes brother Brandon said I make mistakes all the time like mixing up 700 that did not bow the knee with seven thousand seven thousands the actual number that did not bow the need to bail in the Days of Elijah let's play these quotes back to back random Tabernacle says the tapes can never be wrong let's listen to brother Ramsay the opposite like the other day I got something mixed up I happen to hear it yes I caught it right there and it's on the tape and I I probably hear from it when I was talking I was a great teaching there I didn't touch the age of it but uh if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible you see it's seven months after that I I I'm a minister the gospel uh many times I've preached that I know that was seven thousand I just happened to say 700 I didn't mean the 700 I meant you I just didn't read it out of the scripture just come to my mind while I was talking and I just said 700 instead of 7 000. I make that mistakes the whole time I'm a second blog post is from July 30 2022 random Tabernacles Pastor wrote quote thus we learn what is on the tapes are the words of God and there are no mistakes in the words of God end quote of course this is a lie random Tabernacles making every word on tape thus say the Lord that's heresy that's idolatry that's a deity spirit and brother Brown said the opposite again so let's play those quotes again there's mix up on the tapes my brother RAM does those types of Mix-Ups all the time as he said let's listen to the quotes like the other day I got something mixed up I happen to hear it yes I called it right there and it's on the tape and I I probably hear from it when I was talking I was a great teaching there I didn't touch the age of it but uh if you had to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible you see it's seven months after that I I I'll administer the gospel uh many times I've preached that I know that was seven thousand I just happened to say 700 I didn't mean the 700 I mean you I just didn't read it out of the scripture just come to my mind while I was talking and I just said 700 instead of seven thousand I make that mistakes all the time I'm our final piece of evidence is a cub Corner magazine here's the issue it's issue number 32. I'll put a screenshot on the video for you if you open the magazine to page number three I'll put a screenshot of this as well voice of God Recordings and Brandon Tabernacle writes quote no mistakes as we said before God's prophets have thus saith the Lord if we believe that to be the truth and we must also believe that God's prophets make no mistakes because God makes no mistakes end quote friends this is sad propaganda to Children which is why we stopped getting the Cub the corner magazine so I'll leave this quote up on the screen and I'll play quotes from Brother Branham that say the exact opposite the first is from the identified Christ of all ages 64. brother Branham said he proved to you that every Prophet made their mistakes but God makes no mistakes let's listen to the quote now all I could say I'm a man my words can just fail it's like any other man all of us I prove to you tonight that every Prophet everything else they made their mistakes but God makes no mistakes his word is the truth how many believes that he is the word Also let's play another quote where brother random said Nathan a prophet of God in the days of David made a mistake not willingly but the fact is he still made a mistake he told David to do all that was in David's heart and then God had to correct Nathan and David on that statement let's listen to the quote Nathan the prophet said David do all is in your heart cause God's with you the prophet made a mistake not willingly that night the Lord comes the prophet said go tell my servant sort of conserve time let me just share a few more examples of how prophets make mistakes brother Brandon called Saint Peter a prophet but yet Saint Peter was to blame in Galatians Chapter 2 for not eating with the Gentiles so the prophet made a mistake and another Prophet Paul corrected him in 1965 The God Who is rich in Mercy brother Branham was preaching and there were theologians behind him and he said maybe they will correct me when I'm wrong I hope so so this shows again brother Branham was humble and open to receiving correction brother Brown didn't tell the theologians none of you can ever correct me because I'm a prophet of God none of you can ever judge me because I'm a prophet let's listen to the quote I feel kind of small to stand here and speak with such theologians behind me and maybe they'll correct me when I'm wrong I hope so also brother Ram said numerous times he wasn't infallible and brother random said it was an awful thing and Tommy rot to say he was perfectly infallible which is what Branham Tabernacle is saying random Tabernacle is saying awful Tommy rot things make mistakes you pray for me I'm not in Southpaw I'm your brother they're claiming here that some brethren up there that said that I sent them up there and they're preaching that man should lead their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and it um that I am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and over some of the office things you've ever heard in the Ministerial Association got a hold of it and they're writing me a letter by and um and I sent them up there and it's causing a lot of confusion and some of them prophesying and saying that one man should leave this wife and go marry that one uh this church knows that we don't stand for No Such Tommy Rod is that we believe in the Bible brother random also said his wife Mita was his correction and also brother random said brother Sheriff corrected him about giving and receiving and you can again see that on the 95th video now my wife she's my correction you know Brethren want I'm talking about she's one time I thought it wasn't right to receive a presence brother shares a man corrected me on that because [Music] you're mistaken there [Music] to lose their reward that is more blessing to give than it is in closing hope this video has been a blessing friends friends the spirit of Truth is guiding us into all truth as Jesus Promised in John 16 verse 13 churches like Brenham Tabernacle and other tape churches are being guided away from the truth they're turning off their discernment gifts they're neglecting the gifts that God gave them and an evil spirit of idolatry a deity spirit is causing them to do this so let's pray for them father God again I ask you to be merciful to Branham Tabernacle their leadership and all the tape church people around the world God may they repent of their idolatry may they humble themselves and recognize these quotes from Brother Branham and these scriptures from the Bible may they come to genuine repentance and may they forsake their taped Church lies all these 24 plus lies granted Lord Jesus I know you'll save the elect for the elect cannot be deceived I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
