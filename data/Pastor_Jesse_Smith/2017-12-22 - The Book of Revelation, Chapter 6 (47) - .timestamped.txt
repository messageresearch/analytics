[0:02] Revelation chapter 6 the theme for this
[0:07] chapter is Jesus's revelation of the
[0:09] first six seals recall that the teaching
[0:12] on this chapter was thus saith the Lord
[0:14] according to God's prophet William
[0:17] Branham the timing of the events in this
[0:20] chapter are well known to us as William
[0:23] Branham gave us thus saith the Lord
[0:24] about them the first seal referred to
[0:28] the white horse rider who wrote during
[0:30] the first two Church ages around 53 ad
[0:33] to 312 ad when the false church began to
[0:36] tell small white lies and deceive many
[0:39] people away from the truth of God's Word
[0:41] conquering many souls into his evil
[0:44] deception of false Christianity the
[0:47] second seal spoke of the Red Horse and
[0:49] his writer who started writing at some
[0:51] point during the third church age
[0:53] between 312 and 606 AD this horse and
[0:57] his rider now had state power for the
[0:59] rider had United Church and state and
[1:01] could kill anyone who disagreed with him
[1:03] the third seal was about the black horse
[1:06] and his writer who began writing at some
[1:08] point during the 4th church age and
[1:10] continued writing in the 5th and 6th
[1:12] church ages as well from around 900 AD
[1:15] to 1900 ad the fourth seal was about the
[1:18] pale horse and his writer who started
[1:20] writing during the seventh and final
[1:22] church age as this pale horse fights
[1:24] with the fourth beast the flying eagle
[1:27] that represents a prophets revelation as
[1:29] God brought out Israel out of Egypt on
[1:32] eagle's wings meaning he brought them
[1:34] out through the Ministry of the prophet
[1:36] Moses according to Exodus 19 verse 4
[1:39] this is the writer that you and I must
[1:41] contend with for we must have the flying
[1:44] eagle anointing that overcomes the pale
[1:46] horse rider who is named death or
[1:48] spiritual death the fifth seal takes
[1:51] place sometime after the rapture of the
[1:53] New Testament church for there are no
[1:55] more horse riders or beasts at the time
[1:57] of this seal because the church ages are
[1:59] finished and Christ has already taken
[2:01] his wife or bride in the rapture before
[2:04] the Great Tribulation Period the sixth
[2:07] seal will take place sometime during the
[2:08] Great Tribulation Period for it is the
[2:11] great day of the wrath of God and all
[2:13] holy ghost ville believers are kept from
[2:15] the wrath of God
[2:18] the symbols and key revelations in this
[2:20] chapter are numerous so we encourage you
[2:22] to read the book the revelation of the
[2:24] seven seals by William Branham which is
[2:27] available at www.fixez.com any souls
[2:54] into a false form of Christianity during
[2:56] the first two Church ages the writer was
[2:59] eventually given a crown which
[3:01] represents the literal crowns given to
[3:03] the early Pope's who were the leaders of
[3:04] the mother harlot the false church or
[3:07] the Roman Catholic Church which rides
[3:09] the beast or spirit of Rome that is
[3:12] deceiving billions yet today the
[3:14] overcomers of this white horse or spirit
[3:17] filled believers were empowered by the
[3:19] anointing of the lion which was a bold
[3:21] powerful anointing of the Holy Ghost the
[3:25] red horse represents the bloody killing
[3:27] with the great sword which the Roman
[3:29] Catholic Church achieved by uniting
[3:31] church and state during the third and
[3:33] fourth church ages the Roman Catholic
[3:35] Church shed much blood through their
[3:37] bloody Crusades Inquisition and other
[3:40] wars of conquest the overcomers of this
[3:43] red horse were empowered by the
[3:44] anointing of the calf which was power to
[3:46] labor greatly for Christ and to give
[3:48] their lives as a sacrifice many times as
[3:51] martyrs the black horse represents the
[3:55] time period known as the Dark Ages which
[3:57] occurred during the fourth fifth and
[3:59] sixth Church ages during this evil
[4:01] ministry the Roman Catholic Church and
[4:03] her daughter churches began capturing
[4:06] the wealth of the world as the balances
[4:08] in his hand reveal this continued church
[4:11] and state power had control over the
[4:13] natural necessities of life
[4:14] wheat and barley and sought to control
[4:17] the spiritual lives of men as well
[4:19] during this time the Roman Catholic
[4:21] Church came into possession of priceless
[4:23] artworks which now fill its museums
[4:26] galleries and libraries the overcomers
[4:28] of this black horse were empowered by
[4:30] the anointing of the man
[4:31] which was cunningness and discernment of
[4:34] God's wisdom in the leaders of the
[4:36] Reformation period like Martin Luther
[4:38] and John Wesley to name a few
[4:40] the overcomers were also given a
[4:42] tremendous promise from Christ who cried
[4:45] out in the midst of the four beasts that
[4:47] the black horse rider could not hurt the
[4:49] oil and wine meaning that the Antichrist
[4:52] spear would never be able to separate
[4:54] the true believer from the power of the
[4:56] Holy Ghost and the stimulation and
[4:58] inspiration that he daily brings to the
[5:01] believer the pale horse represents the
[5:04] combined colors of the three previous
[5:06] riders and means that those three evil
[5:09] powers would be combined in the final
[5:12] rider named death who rides all the way
[5:14] into the Great Tribulation Period this
[5:17] means our church the latest in church
[5:19] age must battle spiritual death the
[5:22] deceptive lying spirit of the Antichrist
[5:24] as well as has United Church state
[5:26] government world systems who hold and
[5:29] control all the wealth of the world the
[5:31] overcomers of this pale horse you and I
[5:33] are to be empowered by the anointing of
[5:36] the flying eagle which is the revelation
[5:38] of the word of God through a genuine
[5:40] prophet of God as described earlier
[5:42] referring to the Ministry of Moses in
[5:45] Exodus 19 verse 4 we have received this
[5:48] anointing through the Ministry of God's
[5:50] prophet William Branham who preached the
[5:52] revelation of the seven seals and the
[5:54] seven church ages with thus saith the
[5:56] Lord these four horses have the same
[5:59] rider who is actually the same person in
[6:01] the successive or continual evil
[6:04] ministry this person is the spirit of
[6:06] the Antichrist for this Spirit is the
[6:09] spirit of death and has even identified
[6:11] as death by the fourth beast the flying
[6:14] eagle this is the spirit of disobedience
[6:16] to the Word of God which hates the true
[6:19] Word of God and will not obey it
[6:21] the Antichrist spirit of death is the
[6:23] opposite of the Holy Spirit who is life
[6:25] each horse rider is identified by one of
[6:28] the four beasts as the beasts represent
[6:30] the powers or anointings of the Holy
[6:32] Ghost
[6:33] that will combat overcome and defeat
[6:35] each of the riders in the ages in which
[6:38] they ride the souls under the altar in
[6:41] the Fasil were revealed to be the
[6:43] martyred Jews along with all this
[6:45] Jews of the nation of Israel and are not
[6:48] martyred Christians this is true because
[6:50] they were slain for the word of God but
[6:53] not for the testimony of Jesus Christ
[6:55] this revelation was previously taught in
[6:58] Chapter one of the book of Revelation so
[7:01] please see our video on chapter one
[7:03] remember that Saint John had both the
[7:05] testimony of Jesus Christ and the Word
[7:08] of God to further prove these are
[7:10] faithful Jews they asked for revenge for
[7:13] their blood
[7:14] but Holy Ghost filled Christians like
[7:16] Stephen do not ask for revenge but
[7:19] rather ask for forgiveness for their
[7:21] enemies also these Jews are given white
[7:24] robes after death but Christians have
[7:26] white robes before death while they live
[7:29] on the earth for they are born again of
[7:31] the Holy Ghost and have eternal life now
[7:33] while they're on the earth a final
[7:36] observation is that more faithful Jews
[7:38] are going to have to be martyred after
[7:40] the rapture for revelation 6 verse 11
[7:42] says that their fellow servants should
[7:44] be killed as they were the great day of
[7:48] wrath in the sixth seal is a complete
[7:50] interruption of nature during the
[7:51] Tribulation Period as a massive
[7:54] earthquake takes place the Sun becomes
[7:56] black and the moon becomes as blood
[7:58] stars fall to the earth every mountain
[8:02] and island are moved out of their places
[8:03] this major interruption of nature will
[8:06] be directed by the two witnesses or
[8:08] prophets of revelation 11 verses 3 to 14
[8:11] it is likely that these two witnesses
[8:13] are literally moses and elijah brought
[8:16] back to the earth by God to preach
[8:18] Christ to the 144,000 Israeli believers
[8:22] during the Tribulation Period as
[8:24] revelation 11 6 so vividly describes the
[8:27] Ministry of Elijah and Moses we pray you
[8:32] can now see the importance of this seven
[8:34] seal book and you can understand why
[8:36] John was weeping much in chapter 5 verse
[8:39] 4 if it was not going to be revealed
[8:41] these revelations mean so much to the
[8:44] believer because they expose how Satan
[8:46] defiles a church and shows the
[8:48] progression of the Antichrist spirit
[8:49] which goes from small white lies of
[8:52] deception followed by a bloody red
[8:54] United Church and state meaning it kills
[8:57] men and in flu
[8:59] of true believers followed by a
[9:01] money-hungry kingdom building conquest
[9:03] and then it ends in complete spiritual
[9:06] death a rejection of the Word of God
[9:07] with no Holy Ghost baptisms and no Holy
[9:11] Ghost experiences the glory of these
[9:13] revelations also show how the true
[9:16] Christian overcomes Satan and his
[9:17] Antichrist spirit through the anointing
[9:20] of the Holy Ghost the oil and wine that
[9:23] Satan cannot touch or defeat if you like
[9:27] more bible scriptures quotations or if
[9:30] you have any questions about the book of
