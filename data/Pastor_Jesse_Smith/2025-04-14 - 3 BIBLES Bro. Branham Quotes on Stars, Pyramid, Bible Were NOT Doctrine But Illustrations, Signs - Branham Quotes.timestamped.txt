[0:03] like uh I I use this for an illustration
[0:05] and there's a doctrine called pyramid
[0:07] doctrine. But don't never get that in
[0:08] your idea that I that I I believe in
[0:10] pyramid doctrines. I believe in the
[0:12] Bible.
[0:14] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:19] this video is to defend God's prophet,
[0:21] brother Brandham, and some of the quotes
[0:23] he made regarding three Bibles. the
[0:26] written Bible, the stars, and the
[0:29] pyramid of Giza. Some accusers of
[0:32] brother Brandham have tried to make it
[0:33] seem like brother Brandham was dabbling
[0:36] in astrology or the astral arts, which I
[0:40] believe is a ridiculous and foolish
[0:43] accusation. And so, in this video, I'm
[0:46] going to show by the Bible and quotes
[0:47] from God's prophet, Brother Brandham,
[0:49] that that God does use the stars for
[0:52] numerous purposes. And we'll look at the
[0:55] quotes of God's prophet, brother
[0:56] Brandham, where he specifically said
[0:58] numerous times that he was not making a
[1:01] pyramid doctrine and the pyramid and the
[1:04] stars were only used as illustrations or
[1:08] he said a parable or a saying or a sign
[1:12] and not to be made into Bible
[1:15] doctrine. So friends, if you look up the
[1:17] quote three Bibles, there's only 11
[1:19] hits. So God's prophet never made this a
[1:23] major doctrine or a major teaching and
[1:26] there are no thus sayeth the Lord
[1:27] statements in connection with his quotes
[1:30] on the three Bibles. So this repeated
[1:32] idea brother Random had at least on 11
[1:34] occasions was just his own human
[1:36] opinion. He was not speaking thus sayith
[1:38] the Lord and he was not trying to make a
[1:41] Bible doctrine as his own words plainly
[1:43] state. I think it'd be good to start
[1:45] with the scriptures here to see what the
[1:47] Bible says about the stars. Of course,
[1:49] Genesis 1:14, God used the stars for
[1:52] signs and seasons. And then astronomers
[1:55] down through the ages have used the
[1:56] stars to tell time, to navigate the
[1:59] earth, to mark seasons, also signs of
[2:03] major events, and also the declaring of
[2:05] God's glory. According to Psalm 19:1,
[2:08] the heavens declare the glory of God.
[2:12] We know the sun and stars were also used
[2:14] for numerous important Bible events such
[2:16] as of course the birth of Jesus spoken
[2:19] of in Matthew
[2:21] 2:2. There was a star in the east that
[2:23] the wise men followed and it brought
[2:25] them to Bethlehem where they found Jesus
[2:28] as a young
[2:30] child. Also when God healed Hezekiah,
[2:33] the Bible says in 2 Kings chapter 20
[2:36] that Hezekiah pleaded with Isaiah and
[2:38] Isaiah cried out to the Lord and the
[2:40] Lord brought the shadow 10° backwards by
[2:43] which it had gone down in the dial of
[2:46] Ahaz. So God moved the shadow of the sun
[2:49] back 10° and it looked to Hezekiah as if
[2:52] God was turning back time. Now most
[2:54] commentaries believe this phenomenon was
[2:57] temporary, local or confined to the
[3:00] perspective of Hezekiah. But
[3:02] nevertheless, this is a supernatural
[3:04] sign from the sun that God gave to
[3:07] Hezekiah. Also in the book of Joshua,
[3:10] Joshua commanded the son to stand still
[3:12] so he could get the victory. Joshua
[3:15] 10:12 said, Joshua says, "Son, stand
[3:17] thou still upon Gibian and thou moon in
[3:20] the valley of Agelon." and the sun stood
[3:22] still and the moon stayed until the
[3:24] people had avenged themselves upon their
[3:25] enemies. And the Bible said in verse 14,
[3:28] there was no day like that before it or
[3:30] after it that the Lord hearkened unto
[3:32] the voice of a man, for the Lord fought
[3:34] for Israel. So God gave Joshua this sign
[3:37] in the skies for the victory over the
[3:39] five kings that wared at Gibian. Then we
[3:43] know there was darkness of course in
[3:45] Egypt during the 10 plagues. Exodus
[3:48] 10:es
[3:51] 21-23. And then at Jesus's death, the
[3:54] sun was darkened out for 3 hours from
[3:56] the 6th to the 9th hour or from 12 to 3
[3:59] p.m. according to Luke 23 44 and
[4:03] 45. So it's undeniable God uses stars,
[4:07] sun, moon for signs in the sky. Now the
[4:11] origin of this video was last week I was
[4:12] studying on this topic and I found a
[4:14] quote from 1964. It's the sermon
[4:17] Paradox, April 18th in Tampa,
[4:21] Florida. Brother Ram says, "Don't never
[4:24] get a pyramid doctrine." He said, "The
[4:26] stars ain't your Bible." He said, "The
[4:29] pyramids are not your Bible. It's just
[4:32] an illustration that played something in
[4:35] it." In other words, there's truth in
[4:37] the stars and pyramids related to the
[4:39] gospel of Jesus Christ. So in this
[4:42] quote, brother Ram goes through the
[4:44] stars and the pyramids and he says that
[4:46] ain't your Bible. Still, that's not your
[4:48] Bible. So Brother Ram plainly states
[4:51] that he's not trying to make a pyramid
[4:53] doctrine. He's not trying to make a
[4:55] astronomy doctrine or anything like
[4:58] that. Let's listen to the quote. It's
[5:00] just uh here like uh I I use this for an
[5:04] illustration and there's a doctrine
[5:05] called pyramid doctrine, but don't never
[5:07] get that in your idea that I that I I
[5:09] believe in pyramid doctrines. I believe
[5:11] in the Bible. See, and although I
[5:14] believe the pyramid part played
[5:15] something, I believe God wrote three
[5:16] Bibles. He wrote one in the skies, which
[5:18] is the zodiac. Anybody knows that Job
[5:21] spoke of it. What? Look at the zodiac.
[5:23] It starts off with the with the virgin.
[5:25] It ends up with Leo the lion. That's how
[5:27] he come. Thirst for the virgin. His last
[5:30] next coming will be Leo the lion. See
[5:32] coming as a line of tribe of Judah and
[5:34] all in there. The crossfishes are what
[5:35] we're in now. The cancer age and
[5:37] everything. It all speaks. But forget
[5:38] it. See, that ain't your Bible. Then the
[5:41] pyramids, exactly how they were drawn,
[5:43] the headstone was rejected. Still,
[5:45] that's not your Bible. Then God wrote it
[5:47] on words. Jesus comes three times. One
[5:50] time he come to redeem his wife. Next
[5:52] time he comes to catch her away. The
[5:53] next time he comes with her, three come.
[5:55] See, everything like father, son, holy
[5:57] ghost. See, all everything's in a three.
[5:59] The mathematics of the Bible is perfect.
[6:01] If you keep them mathematics right, you
[6:03] can keep your story right. thing. But if
[6:05] you get off the mathematics, you'll have
[6:07] a in your picture a cow picking grass on
[6:09] top of a tree. So it won't it won't look
[6:11] right. See, stay in the mathematics. See
[6:13] the Bible and you place it out.
[6:16] Right. Next, I'd like to look at this
[6:18] quote from 1958. And it shows Brother
[6:20] Brandham sometimes mixed up his words.
[6:22] Sometimes he used the word astrology,
[6:25] which is evil, but he meant to use the
[6:27] word astronomy, which is the study of
[6:30] stars and planets. Astrology is evil of
[6:33] course because of horoscopes but
[6:35] astronomy is just a study of God's
[6:37] creation. And notice in this quote
[6:39] brother Brandham says into the spirit of
[6:41] their astrology or astronomy or
[6:43] astrology I think was the right word. So
[6:46] brother Brandham wasn't even sure which
[6:47] word was right the right word to use. So
[6:50] this again proves how brother Adam was a
[6:52] godly man a prophet of God. He was not
[6:55] trying to bring in any astral arts into
[6:57] the gospel of Jesus Christ. He was doing
[7:00] the best he could with his education. Of
[7:02] course, he was a Holy Ghost fililled
[7:03] Christian. Let's listen to the quote.
[7:06] And until it was real dark, when the
[7:09] twilights of evening was still
[7:12] falling, they had a way of getting
[7:14] themselves into the spirit of their
[7:18] astrology or astronomy. Astrology, I
[7:21] think, was the right word.
[7:23] Next, let's listen to this quote from
[7:24] Have Not. I sent thee, Phoenix, Arizona,
[7:27] January
[7:28] 2462. Brother Ram talks about the three
[7:30] Bibles, and he says, "This is not a
[7:32] teaching. This is a saying." Remember,
[7:35] let me quote it again. Not a teaching, a
[7:36] saying to make a parable. So again,
[7:40] Brother M states it plainly. He's not
[7:41] trying to make any doctrines or
[7:43] teachings. He's looking for parallels.
[7:46] He's making a parable, which is an
[7:48] allegory, a moral story, a lesson. So
[7:52] let's look at lessons we can learn from
[7:53] the stars and the pyramid of Giza. Let's
[7:56] listen to the quote. This is not a
[7:58] teaching. This is a
[8:00] saying. Remember, let me quote it again.
[8:03] Not a teaching, a saying to make a
[8:05] parable. God wrote three Bibles. One of
[8:08] them was in the sky. Man to look up to
[8:11] realize his creator come from there. The
[8:13] zodiac. What's the first thing in the
[8:15] zodiac? Starts off with uh the virgin.
[8:19] What's the last figure in the zodiac?
[8:21] Leo the line
[8:24] again in 1962 July 1st to take on the
[8:28] whole armor of God in California.
[8:30] Brother Ram says now I don't believe in
[8:32] doctrines of pyramids. I'm only making a
[8:35] parable. So again he says it's not a
[8:38] doctrine. But yet, a side note is that
[8:40] the future home proves the new Jerusalem
[8:42] is a pyramid because Jesus, the light of
[8:45] the new Jerusalem, could not be seen by
[8:47] everyone if the city was a cube or
[8:50] rectangular prism or any other
[8:52] three-dimensional figure. Let's listen
[8:54] to the quote.
[8:56] Now, I've been to
[8:57] Egypt and in those pyramids how I could
[9:00] take all afternoon. Now, I don't believe
[9:03] in doctrines of pyramids. I'm only
[9:05] making a parable. But as you notice that
[9:08] pyramid, it never did receive the stone.
[9:11] Enoch built that that pyramid in his
[9:14] days. They can't figure it out. Now
[9:16] they've got all kinds of religions on it
[9:18] like they have in the zodiac. But
[9:20] everything in God wrote three Bibles.
[9:24] The first one was in the heaven. The
[9:26] second one was in the pyramid. The third
[9:28] one's on the earth. And every one of
[9:29] them agree with one another.
[9:32] In the next quote from the future home,
[9:33] brother Bram said, "Enoch's sign in
[9:35] Egypt, the pyramid." Now, notice it's a
[9:37] sign. It's not thus sayith the Lord or
[9:39] anything like that. It's not a doctrine.
[9:41] It's a sign. There's something we can
[9:43] learn from Enoch's pyramid or the
[9:46] pyramid of Giza. Of course, it has no
[9:48] headstone. We know Jesus Christ is the
[9:51] cornerstone. And then we know Zechariah
[9:53] says that that the headstone will come
[9:55] with shoutings of grace, grace unto it.
[9:58] So, we know if the pyramid of Giza is
[10:00] missing the headstone, that's a lesson
[10:02] we can learn that the church needs the
[10:05] headstone of Jesus Christ's return.
[10:08] Jesus is the foundation of the church,
[10:10] but he's also the finishing of the
[10:11] church, the church ages, the times of
[10:14] the Gentiles, the seven church ages. So,
[10:17] we know the fact Jesus is the
[10:19] cornerstone and the headstone is a
[10:20] biblical teaching. It's a biblical
[10:22] truth. When Jesus comes back at the
[10:25] Gentile rapture, that's the end of the
[10:27] time of the Gentiles. And then he goes
[10:29] back to the Jews. He grafts back in the
[10:32] Jewish branch into the holy tree
[10:34] according to Romans 11. And so we see
[10:36] this beautiful sign in the pyramid of
[10:38] Enoch or the pyramid of Giza. Let's
[10:40] listen to the quote. This being this way
[10:44] would answer exactly Enoch's sign in
[10:48] Egypt. the pyramid
[10:52] was it?
[10:54] Enoch before the antalivian destruction
[10:56] when justification was coming in he
[10:59] brought forth a sign and in this pyramid
[11:03] is seven steps going to the king's
[11:05] chamber.
[11:08] What's on the seventh step? If you ever
[11:12] study the dimensions of the pyramid,
[11:14] what comes out to take the oncomer to
[11:17] introduce to the
[11:19] king, watch whose station that is
[11:21] standing there and you'll see the day
[11:23] you're living in the pyramid. Now, God
[11:26] made three Bibles. Now, there's a
[11:27] pyramid teaching. It's nonsense. But
[11:29] there's a genuine pyramid. Amen.
[11:33] Notice now God first Bible, he made
[11:36] three. They have to be everything in
[11:37] three. Jesus comes three times. come
[11:39] once to redeem his bride, next time to
[11:41] get his bride, next time with his bride.
[11:43] See, now notice how beautiful. See, and
[11:47] in this pyramid was seven steps. And
[11:49] then the king's chamber. And we're in
[11:52] the seventh church age. That's right.
[11:54] Before the king takes his throne. And
[11:56] remember, the pyramid never did have a
[11:58] capstone on it.
[12:01] God's first Bible was in the skies, the
[12:03] zodiac. It starts off and runs every
[12:06] age. The first beginning of the zodiac
[12:08] is the virgin. That's how he come first.
[12:11] The last figure in the zodiac is Leo the
[12:13] lion, the second coming. Just before
[12:15] there is a cross fishes, which is a
[12:17] cancer age that we're living in now.
[12:19] There was a pyramid after that Enoch,
[12:22] which testified exactly. We wouldn't
[12:23] have time to go into it, but someday
[12:25] with God's help, I'll show you just
[12:26] exactly draws the dimension of the hour
[12:28] we're living. See,
[12:30] in closing, friends, I hope this video
[12:32] was a blessing by the grace of God.
[12:34] Again, I got this inspiration last week
[12:36] after listening to this quote from
[12:37] Paradox 1964. Brother man was plainly
[12:40] saying he's not making a Bible doctrine.
[12:42] He's not making a teaching. He never
[12:45] spoke thus sayith the Lord on this. He
[12:47] just looked at the stars and the pyramid
[12:50] and he saw lots of illustrations,
[12:52] parables, sayings, or signs that
[12:55] Christians could benefit from. And that
[12:57] is certainly the truth. And again, it
[12:59] proves Brother Adam is a genuine prophet
[13:01] of God. He spoke with thus sayith the
[13:03] Lord numerous times and it came to pass
[13:05] as my videos have already shown as most
[13:08] honest Christians already know. And here
[13:10] he's doing his best to try to give the
[13:12] church illustrations, parables, sayings,
[13:15] signs that help them prepare for the
[13:17] second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[13:19] And remember friends, some people even
[13:21] think Isaiah 19 and 20 is speaking of
[13:24] the pyramid of Giza as a sign. It says,
[13:27] "In that day shall there be an altar to
[13:29] the Lord in the midst of the land of
[13:31] Egypt, and a pillar at the border
[13:32] thereof to the Lord, and it shall be for
[13:34] a sign and for a witness unto the Lord
[13:37] of hosts in the land of Egypt." So, this
[13:40] is the verse some people believe can be
[13:42] used to show that God set up the pyramid
[13:45] of Giza as a sign. So, God anointed
[13:47] Enoch to construct this pyramid and then
[13:50] it would be a sign throughout history.
[13:53] It's a sign to the unbelievers in Egypt
[13:56] from the Lord that Jesus is coming back
[14:00] that God is going to cap this pyramid by
[14:03] the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[14:04] Christ. And no doubt this can also be a
[14:07] sign to Egypt that what God did in the
[14:10] time of Moses with the plagues is going
[14:12] to repeat very closely during the great
[14:14] tribulation period through the trumpets
[14:16] and the vows, the seven trumpets and
[14:18] seven vows of the tribulation period. I
[14:21] have a video on that. There's lots of
[14:23] similarities between the trumpets, vows,
[14:25] and the 10 plagues that already struck
[14:27] Egypt. So, God sets this sign. A lot of
[14:30] people believe this sign from Isaiah 19,
[14:33] 19, and 20 is the pyramid of Giza. I
[14:36] don't know. I'm not sure. It sure looks
[14:38] like it though to me. And of course,
[14:40] people will probably criticize my
[14:41] opinion. They can criticize whatever
[14:43] they want. The main thing is that we are
[14:45] saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus
[14:47] Christ. By grace through faith with
[14:50] faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. And
[14:52] then to be the wise version, you must be
[14:54] justified, sanctified, and have your
[14:56] soul baptized with the baptism of the
[14:58] Holy Ghost. As Jesus said in Acts
[15:00] chapter 1, wait in Jerusalem until
[15:03] you're due with power from on high, and
[15:05] you'll be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[15:08] It's undeniable God has left many signs
[15:10] to his people. And of course there are
[15:12] signs in the stars, signs in the
[15:14] heavens. The Bible says that. And we
[15:16] take all these signs back to the word of
[15:18] God because the word of God is our
[15:19] absolute. So friends, let's continue
[15:22] walking in the grace of our Lord Jesus
[15:24] Christ. Walking in the spirit, believing
[15:26] all the word of God. And we can be
[15:28] thankful for the illustrations God has
[15:29] given to us, the parables, the signs,
[15:32] the sayings. God uses all these things
[15:35] around us that he placed there to help
[15:37] keep our attention, our focus on the
[15:39] Lord Jesus Christ. We seek first the
[15:41] kingdom of God and his righteousness,
[15:43] and all these things are added unto us
[15:45] according to the word of the Lord. Let's
[15:48] keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[15:49] The Bible says he's going to return to
[15:52] all those that love his appearing as St.
[15:54] Paul said. Let's love the appearing of
[15:57] our Lord Jesus Christ. If you have any
[15:59] questions, concerns, or testimonies
[16:01] about this video, please contact
[16:03] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[16:07] be the desire of your heart. Very happy
[16:11] to be here this afternoon and again in
[16:13] defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to
[16:16] bring the good tidings, the good news
[16:18] that Jesus raised from the dead, living
[16:20] among man today, his church. The same
[16:23] Jesus that was yesterday will be today
[16:26] and forever. He is never failed.
