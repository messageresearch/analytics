TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ is revelation chapter 7 the bride or the foolish virgin i believe we can prove this great multitude of gentiles is the holy ghost filled bride of jesus christ through five bible proofs as well as six quotes from god's prophet william branham compared to only one quote in which brother branham says it's the foolish virgin and friends this is a minor doctrine not a major but i share these truths because i believe it will help people understand the scriptures better and as always if i'm wrong i'm open to correction we'll begin with the six bible proofs as an exercise and rightly dividing the word of truth as brother branham did many times but specifically when teaching the 24 elders were not angels but human beings he said to consider every detail of the scriptural text when deciding the interpretation let's listen to the quote you people ain't going gonna have time to catch this as you just write down if you want to know they were redeemed man think matthew 19 28. all right 19 28 matthew revelations 3 21 then theodore revelations 20 and 4 revelations 2 and 10. first peter five two and four second timothy four and eight that'll let you know that they are redeemed i want to go through that this morning and see you just comb it for weeks you see they were not they were not angelic beings they were not heavenly beings they were a redeemed man see you can consider their dress the way they were dressed you can consider their position what they had you consider their songs what they say and know that they were not angelic beings [Music] now beginning with five bible proofs it seems all believers are in agreement that this group are gentiles as verse 9 in revelation chapter 7 says it was a great multitude without number of all nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues this group would not be the 144 thousand jews because they are mentioned earlier in the chapter in chapter seven verses one through eight and jews of course are only from one nation israel the first proof that this group is the holy ghost filled bride of jesus christ and not foolish virgins is they are clothed in white robes according to verses 9 and 13. holy ghost-filled christians also called the bride and wise virgins have white robes already in this life because the baptism of the holy ghost is eternal life abiding in their souls but the jews and foolish virgins do not get white robes until the white throne judgment as brother adam taught in chapter 7 in the church age book here's the quote and i quote it is the second resurrection that the souls under the altar as set forth in the fifth seal revelation chapter 6 verses 9 through 11 are given white robes and of course eternal life or there would be no point of white robes end quote the bible evidence for this is in revelation chapter 3 verse 4 and the fifth seal of revelation chapter 6 verse 11. revelation 3 verse 4 reads thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy jesus promised the sardisian saints or saints of the reformation age like martin luther that they would walk with him in white garments jesus also said they had not defiled their garments showing they already had eternal life on the earth walking worthy of jesus is possible in this life as proven by multiple scriptures one of which is colossians 1 verse 10 that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god the fifth seal which reveals the heavenly placement of jews who are not born again shows they are without white robes because they were not born again revelation 6 verse 11 says and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled the bible conclusion is that the foolish virgins are like jews in the sense their souls are not born again by the baptism of the holy ghost the second proof is their robes are white in the blood according to verse 14. verse 14 seems to connect their white robes to the great tribulations they overcame during their lives their washing took place during their lifetimes which differs from jews under the fist seal because they were promised to be given robes after their lives before looking more into the washing of robes it's necessary to state that there are two kinds of christians wise and foolish as taught by jesus christ himself in matthew 25 verses 1-13 according to christ the difference between the wise and foolish was the amount of oil they possessed and we know oil represents the baptism of the holy ghost according to zechariah chapter 4 luke 10 34 and revelation 6 verse 6 to name a few this shows wise christians have oil in their souls while foolish virgins are not born again in their souls but have the spirit's anointing in their human minds or human spirits jesus parable shows the wise virgins have extra oil or they have the holy ghost in an extra part of their beings because man is a three-part being so foolish virgins only have the anointing of the holy spirit in their human minds but wise virgins have it in their souls which is the seal of the baptism of the holy ghost for a full teaching on this subject see my video called two kinds of christians in two resurrections friend jesus called his own disciples fools before they were born again in luke 24 verse 25. and remember christ is the same yesterday today and forever paul also differentiates the wise virgin from the foolish in ephesians chapter 5 verses 15-17 saying the wise virgins redeem their time and understand the will of god see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21 provide further support that a holy ghost-filled christian does god's perfect will because they are empowered by the blood of the everlasting covenant which the foolish virgin would not be influenced by as paul previously taught as well in the ephesians 5 verses 15-17 scriptures hebrews 13 20-21 says now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen we conclude a foolish virgin is not fully washed by the cleansing power of the blood hebrews 10 29 is the proof of this statement claiming believers can be sanctified by the blood but then count it an unholy thing eventually suffering sore punishment hebrews 10 29 says of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace the bible gives us the principle that the life is in the blood in leviticus 17 verse 11 so applying this spiritually the life of jesus christ or his holy spirit comes into a believer's soul as the baptism of the holy ghost when he humbles himself and fully obeys the word of god according to acts chapter 5 verse 32 and we are his witnesses of these things and so also is the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him titus chapter 3 verses 5 and 6 speaks of this washing jesus's spirit performs in the believer during the believer's lifetime not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our savior friends brother branham taught this principle as well in numerous places saying the foolish virgin rejected the full effects of the blood of jesus or spirit of god but for time's sake here's two quotes one from the token from november 63 and one from questions and answers part two in 1964. let's listen to these two quotes god did the same and the remnant of the woman's seed that was left upon the earth the day is the calling out of the bride out of the church the exit is for the rapture for the church truly goes through the tribulation period as you pentecostal brothers has preached it i don't believe that the church goes to it but not the pride closer someone discussed that with me how all god said the church will have to go through the flower for purification i said that is true because she rejected the blood but if the tribulation period catches the bride his own wife in the tribulation no sir the blood of jesus christ has cleansed us from all sin and there's no more purifying than the blood of jesus christ and that token has identification that has been purified that's the token of the bride wearing the ring now just a minute will the polish virgin be safe no whatever happens she happens now after that time she's in the state now she will have to go through the tribulation period and the reason of it is is because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness she is a believer a professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period the bible says the rest of them the dragon spurted water out of his mouth they go and make war and what an hour that is regarding the questions and answers part 2 1964 quote notice that later in the sermon he said the foolish virgin are saved so brother graham's answer meant the foolish virgin would have to die during the tribulation period and wouldn't be spared from death during the tribulation now the church the the nominal believers like lot he's going through the tribulation period see and be saved as if it was before noah went through the tribulation period carried above it come out with ham who polluted the earth again see lot came out his own daughter slept with him and had children by his own daughters but abraham brought forth the royal seed brought forth the seed of the promise enoch went to glory in the rapture just took a walk and went home and never went through the tribulation period you see the third proof is the mention of great tribulation in verse 14. this does not seem to speak of the seven year tribulation period or jacob's trouble which is the last and 70th week of daniel's 70 weeks prophecy because this is a gentile group here in revelation chapter 7 and not a jewish group see my video called five reasons the rapture is pre-tribulation for a full teaching on this subject this great tribulation here in revelation 7 seems to speak of the lasting persecution upon christians over the past 2000 years even before paul's conversion acts chapter 8 verse 1 says there was great persecution against christians in jerusalem and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem the great christian persecution has never ceased theologian samuel schmucker estimated 68 million christians were martyred from the time augustine gave his approval for persecution in the fifth century until schmucker's lifetime in the 19th century and i got this from rachel hasseltine's book how did it happen page 282 the book was written in 1958 today the esther project estimates nearly 35 million christians were martyred during the 20th century alone at the hands of communistic and fascist governments numerous new testament passages speak of tribulation or persecution as an expected experience for holy ghost-filled christians here's four examples 2 timothy 2 verse 12 yes and all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution matthew 13 21 yet hath he not rooting himself but dearth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended romans 5 verse 3 and not only so but we glory in tribulation also knowing that tribulation worketh patience romans chapter 12 verse 12 rejoicing in hope patient and tribulation continuing instant in prayer god has not forgotten the millions upon millions of christian martyrs one reward for these courageous saints will be living and reigning during the one thousand year millennial time period according to revelation chapter 20 verses four through six and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years i trust you can now see how the revelation chapter 7 great multitude was the wise virgin saints because they washed their robes white with the blood of jesus christ as they endured great tribulation during their lifetimes the fourth proof is they serve in the temple according to verse 15. the great multitude is worshiping and serving day and night in his temple this group has to be the wise virgin or bride of jesus christ because they are actively serving in the temple as brother branham correctly taught who serves the husband but the wife the foolish virgins were just that foolish they were not the same quality of believer as a wise virgin as jesus twice called believers foolish in matthew 25 verse 2 and luke 24 verse 25 the foolish virgins are likely resting or waiting under the altar like the blinded jews of the fifth seal because both groups are not born again revelation chapter 6 verse 11 says the blinded jews must rest yet for a little season so the fact that this gentile multitude will serve in the temple seems to make this scene a picture of the gentile bride of jesus christ who were saved during the 2000 year church ages as they worship and serve jesus christ in the heavenly temple after the rapture it's likely a scene from the marriage supper of the lamb or presentation of jesus's bride or perhaps the scene from the judgment seat of christ which all saints will stand before in order to receive rewards according to second corinthians 5 verse 10 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad the foolish virgins would not be present at the marriage supper the next event they would attend would be the great white throne judgment which is after the 1000 year millennial reign of christ and his bride upon the earth the fifth proof is that the term the great multitude is only used for the bride in verse 9 and also in revelation chapter 19 verses 6 8 and 14. this great multitude term is used twice in scripture revelation 7 verse 9 and revelation 19 verse 6. the context of revelation 19 verse 6 is the bride of jesus christ as seen in verses 6 through 8 and verse 14. notice in verse 14 that this bride group is again identified as wearing white robes the symbolism of eternal life and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thundering saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a raid and find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean it seems this scene from revelation chapter 19 verses 6 through 8 is again right after the rapture which also includes the bride presentation the marriage supper of the lamb communion and rewards at the judgment seat of christ the context of revelation chapter 19 verse 14 is the battle of armageddon in which jesus defeats the false prophet or pope antichrist and the beast or antichrist spirit with a sword of his word from his mouth before the glorious one thousand-year millennial reign of christ and his bride next here's the six quotes versus the one quote from brother branham about this scene in revelation 7 verses 9 through 17. remember friends six quotes claim revelation 7 verses 9 to 17 is the bride compared to the one quote brother random says it's the foolish virgin the quotes will now be heard in chronological order [Applause] that's what she says [Music] jesus they would come up by the great tribulation called holy lord made fun of persecuted right there come up by the great tribulation and our blessings and make them white in the blood of the lamb what they are before the throne of god where is the wise stage where's the queen saying that's the bride the gentile died and they serve him to united temple my wife serves me at the house see that's the blood of jesus that's the gentile god or the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and lead them into the fountains of waters and god shall wipe all tears from the rhine there it is there's the bride oh my how beautiful the bride 140. now if you want to see the pride come up actually that's a show that's 144 000 does not survive just continue to read now all down from the eighth chapter on or uh yes the eighth chapter of the eighth verse i mean from the seventh chapter let's start the ninth night first cause the eighth first is the ceiling of benjamin 12th health after after this i be held in low a great multitude which no man can number here comes the bride of all nations kindreds people and tom stood before the throne and before the cold and white robes and palms in their hands and cried with a loud voice saying salvation our god which says upon throwing it through the lamb all the angels stood around about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts fell uh fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped god saying amen bless his glory wisdom thanksgiving honor power might be to our god forever and ever amen one of the elders which answered and said unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes and which cometh thing i said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which have come about a great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb therefore they are before the throne of god and serve him day and night in the temple see what does your wife do she serves you in the house you sit down she gives you your food she fixes the clothing see she serves you day and night in the house and this one is of all nations the gentiles which is the bride or before the throne of god with him day and night remember what we said last night talked on it will the prophet of malachi 4 be the one to call out the gentile remnant of revelations 7 9 even though they go through the tribulation period no no after the the uh revelation 7 is where he seemed 144 000 sealed and after that he saw coming up coming back was that great number which no man could number which was the bride it will have no malachi 4 will be finished and the bride taken up and then this group of elijah and elisha return back to the earth for the church to go through the tribulation period but elijah and elisha will not have anything to do with the sleeping virgin they're gentiles they'll be sent only to the jews god is talking about the bride here do you want to see another picture of her it is over in revelation 7 4-17 now will you find out also in this that the sixth uh seal now being open it was for a threefold purpose now here was the purposes the first thing was that his sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th uh chapter here that she had been purged and she had been given her robes now she's not the bride but it's a church in closing i hope this video has been a blessing and i hope it's been edifying to see both the scriptures the five scriptural proofs and the six quotes that point to this group being the wise virgin the bride of jesus christ again this is not a major doctrine but a minor because it relates to future events the main thing right now is to make sure your soul is baptized with the holy ghost i trust you were edified by these five bible proofs perhaps you've never heard them before along with the six quotes perhaps you didn't know there were six quotes from brother branham that said this group was the bride of jesus christ or the wise virgins please contact me with any questions concerns or testimonies about this video god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
