[33:40] borne our griefs and carry our sorrows
[33:43] yet we did esteem him stricken
[33:44] smitten of god and afflicted but he was
[33:48] wounded for our transgressions he was
[33:50] bruised for our iniquities

[35:17] i do have some slides there by god's
[35:28] grace
[35:30] so uh we'll continue here um
[35:33] i just made it yellow so i could see it
[35:35] better we'll look at part 13 tonight
[35:37] by the grace of the lord
[35:40] and i'd like to uh continue on the
[35:42] question too so
[35:44] i'm sorry they're on the first question
[35:46] that uh i asked
[35:48] i asked the brother if these were uh the
[35:50] right
[35:51] things is it right for men and women to
[35:54] cross-dress
[35:55] uh is the transgender movement right is
[35:57] bruce jennerite
[35:59] and where did god change deuteronomy 22
[36:01] 5. so i kind of put like
[36:02] four questions in one that's uh
[36:06] kind of how you have to do it you kind
[36:07] of got to put those all together
[36:09] now i want to bring up this your thought
[36:11] these are
[36:12] uh as as our brother was talking our
[36:14] friend was talking we'd say
[36:16] these are additional points that he made
[36:18] afterwards i want to go through these
[36:20] and uh prove all things uh how many been
[36:23] reading your bible this week and
[36:24] searching the scriptures daily whether
[36:26] those things were so praise god
[36:27] and so we do that by the grace of the
[36:29] lord uh
[36:31] so our brother said brother branham
[36:33] should not have said god poured out
[36:34] his wrath upon jesus's body and his
[36:38] his saying was because god so loved the
[36:40] world
[36:42] so one of the state one of the
[36:43] accusations against uh the message of
[36:45] the hour
[36:46] is that we believe god poured out his
[36:49] wrath upon jesus
[36:51] but the other side differs and said no
[36:53] god didn't
[36:55] because god so loved the world now the
[36:58] truth is that
[36:59] we know god does love the world and
[37:01] because god does love the world
[37:03] he gave the world a chance to be
[37:04] forgiven by pouring out the wrath upon
[37:07] jesus jesus took the wrath as the
[37:10] scapegoat
[37:11] and as the the goat that died right he
[37:14] became god's lamb
[37:16] and so the fact is because god loved the
[37:18] world so much
[37:19] he cursed jesus what uh
[37:22] what a thing jesus did there to take
[37:25] your curse
[37:26] to take your punishment and we'll look
[37:28] at that scripture now let's just
[37:30] look at that again real quick now you
[37:32] remember the bible said god
[37:33] set forth his son to be a propitiation
[37:37] through faith in his blood
[37:39] to declare his righteousness for the
[37:41] remission of sins that are passed
[37:43] through the forbearance
[37:44] of god number propitiation is an
[37:46] atonement it's a payment for
[37:48] sin so jesus was
[37:52] god's way to pay for sin
[37:56] we know jesus said the son of man came
[37:58] to give his life as a ransom for many
[38:02] a ransom is a payment so
[38:05] jesus took uh the the wrath of god
[38:08] as a payment uh for god paying the the
[38:11] penalty for all the sins
[38:13] of mankind and that's the scripture
[38:17] so we see that jesus is the atonement
[38:19] and just looking at this scripture again
[38:20] just look at
[38:21] look at the language here you know he
[38:24] bore
[38:24] your grief so all your grief jesus
[38:28] bored on his back right all your sorrows
[38:31] jesus
[38:32] carried it all of it
[38:36] uh he was smitten he was smitten of gods
[38:39] that means
[38:40] uh he was smitten for you and i right
[38:44] he was afflicted for you and i because
[38:46] the griefs were ours the sorrows
[38:48] belonged to us
[38:49] the the smiting belonged to us the
[38:51] affliction belonged to us
[38:53] the wounds for the transgressions belong
[38:55] to us
[38:56] right the bruising for the iniquities
[39:00] belong it actually belonged to us
[39:02] the chastisement to pay for the peace
[39:06] was upon him but it belonged to us we
[39:09] deserve the chastisement
[39:12] uh but with his stripes we are healed so
[39:14] the stripes really belong to us
[39:18] the scripture says we've all gone astray
[39:20] like sheep turn on everyone his way
[39:22] and here it is right here the lord laid
[39:24] on him the iniquity of us all
[39:28] so our brother's just wrong right uh
[39:32] and and i think you know when people
[39:34] leave the message they run off to
[39:36] to popular by you know tv preachers or
[39:39] internet preachers that
[39:41] seem to have some truth but but don't
[39:44] they don't have all the truth right they
[39:45] have a little bit of truth but not all
[39:47] of it
[39:47] and so they paint in a social gospel
[39:49] where where it's all flowery god is all
[39:52] love god is all love but
[39:53] in this scripture this is the love of
[39:55] god they say god is all love but no he
[39:58] didn't pour out his wrath upon jesus
[40:01] the bible clearly says he did amen he
[40:04] poured out the iniquity he poured out
[40:05] the payment the ransom
[40:07] for sin all of it was laid on
[40:11] jesus christ and look at verse 10 yet it
[40:13] pleased the lord to bruise him
[40:16] he hath put him to grief and then now
[40:20] the bible said when thou shalt make his
[40:21] soul and offering for sin
[40:23] he shall see a seed that's us he shall
[40:26] prolong his days
[40:27] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[40:29] prosper
[40:30] in his hand now look at the bible says
[40:33] it please god to do it
[40:35] it please god how many parents you'll do
[40:37] anything to keep your child from
[40:39] suffering
[40:39] any little suffering right you would do
[40:42] anything to keep your child from
[40:44] stubbing their just small stubbing their
[40:46] toe
[40:47] or for any any little pain you do
[40:50] anything to keep them from that
[40:53] but not but the lord with his divine
[40:56] love
[40:57] he poured all of the punishment on jesus
[41:00] so that he didn't even
[41:01] look like a man now
[41:06] i'm going to skip ahead i got some
[41:07] numerous quotes i think i'm i think i
[41:08] had them
[41:09] placed down here so i'm going to skip
[41:10] ahead
[41:16] okay yeah here's now along these same
[41:20] same lines our brother said william
[41:22] branham's god
[41:23] carries a big stick
[41:27] and that sounds uh it sounds like
[41:29] brother brown was too harsh right that's
[41:30] what they're saying
[41:31] lauren was too harsh that's not true
[41:36] and uh you know they try to make it
[41:39] sound like you know god is up there
[41:41] just waiting to spank us
[41:45] we see they try to paint like god is so
[41:46] loving but message people just see him
[41:48] as a
[41:49] an angry dad that wants to uh spank you
[41:52] with a stick
[41:54] now see the the truth is god loves you
[41:58] right god is full of love
[42:01] but he knows he's got to correct you as
[42:03] well
[42:04] and if and the way and the bible the
[42:07] bible's clear
[42:08] the only way jesus learned obedience was
[42:10] through love
[42:12] no suffering right is that right
[42:16] jesus learned obedience through the
[42:17] things he suffered
[42:20] okay so we yes we look at god as a
[42:23] loving god
[42:24] but we see his love is expressed through
[42:27] correction
[42:28] right but also through blessings how
[42:30] many how many love to shout and praise
[42:32] god
[42:32] amen as much as anybody i like to dance
[42:34] around here and praise the lord and
[42:36] i like to scream and and yell and cry
[42:39] and worship
[42:40] i love those feelings from god and we
[42:43] enjoy those
[42:44] week week after week we enjoy those
[42:46] church
[42:47] week after week we get to smile and
[42:49] praise god and feel his presence and
[42:51] just feel renewed right but sometimes
[42:54] during the week we get a good spanking
[42:57] right so it's both
[43:00] god is full of love but he said as many
[43:03] as i love
[43:04] i rebuke and chasten in church a real
[43:07] holy ghost filled saying they don't
[43:08] spend their time every day getting spent
[43:10] by god
[43:12] right because if you do you say sorry
[43:15] anyway
[43:16] and then it's over praise god it's not a
[43:20] it's not a required 30 steps of penance
[43:22] or
[43:23] a let's say a five hail mary's like i
[43:25] don't know how many they have to do but
[43:26] they have to do a certain number of hail
[43:28] marys
[43:29] that's not you and i as soon as we say
[43:32] we're sorry god forgives us
[43:34] now depending on how severe our mistake
[43:36] was we might have to live with some
[43:38] consequences
[43:40] right like if you lie for example well
[43:42] then if you lie to somebody you say
[43:43] you're sorry
[43:44] god forgives you but then that person
[43:45] may not trust you for a while
[43:47] right and so you got to live with that
[43:50] consequence
[43:51] if it's even greater like uh
[43:56] you know like an abuse or a divorce or
[43:59] adultery or something like that
[44:02] you've got to live with it for a long
[44:03] time you have to live for with
[44:05] so it depends on the transgression
[44:09] but that's that's bible truth how many
[44:11] that's bible truth
[44:13] oh absolutely so does god carry a big
[44:16] stick i would say yeah
[44:17] god does and i'm going to give you some
[44:19] examples here
[44:20] so get your bibles ready
[44:23] maybe i can have my children read them
[44:25] i'll keep them on their tongues
[44:30] now just as you're turning
[44:34] uh lydia why don't you go to uh
[44:36] revelation 3
[44:42] and then malachi if you go to um ii
[44:45] samuel
[44:46] 12. the church look at this here just
[44:50] for a moment
[44:52] paul says you have forgotten the
[44:54] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[44:56] unto children
[44:57] my son despise not thou the chastening
[45:00] of the lord
[45:03] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
[45:06] this is
[45:06] not old testament right this is new
[45:09] testament
[45:12] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[45:17] and scourges every son whom he receiveth
[45:20] if you endure chastening god dealt with
[45:23] you as sons
[45:24] for what son is he whom the father
[45:26] chasteneth not
[45:29] and the saint said now new testament
[45:33] teaching
[45:35] says if god loves you he's going to
[45:37] rebuke you
[45:40] and and the writer says when someone
[45:43] backsides they forget that god is
[45:46] gonna correct you if he loves you so see
[45:49] what is he he's trying to get the
[45:50] attitude of oh i sinned it's okay
[45:52] i it's it's not a big deal i'll just say
[45:54] sorry he's going after that half-hearted
[45:57] repentance
[45:57] that isn't even real repentance are you
[46:00] with me
[46:01] because that he says you're gonna don't
[46:02] forget that you are a
[46:04] child in god's eyes and god's not gonna
[46:06] let you
[46:07] let you get away with stealing that
[46:08] cookie from the cookie jar
[46:12] right he's not going to let you get away
[46:14] with that because that's not it's not
[46:15] love if he knows you did it and doesn't
[46:17] correct you
[46:18] then he if he doesn't correct you that's
[46:19] not love
[46:21] he has to correct you now look at this
[46:23] word the brother said god
[46:25] brother graham's god carries a big stick
[46:26] well the bible says
[46:28] god carries a stick
[46:32] because this word scourge now look at
[46:35] that
[46:35] every son how many sons and daughters of
[46:38] god we got in here
[46:41] every one of us is going to get scourged
[46:44] when we uh dis respect the lord
[46:48] every one of us if he doesn't scourge us
[46:51] we're not sons and daughters
[46:56] and so see all these uh ideas come up
[46:58] and it's it's like one lie after another
[47:00] and i'm like
[47:01] there's just so many lies you know it's
[47:03] like it's like uh
[47:05] it's like somebody dropping confetti and
[47:06] trying to catch all of that i mean who's
[47:07] gonna be able to catch all that confetti
[47:09] you know
[47:09] you're gonna be able to catch all of it
[47:12] you just gotta
[47:13] so during as as we debate you know i'm
[47:14] just trying to ask the holy spirit to
[47:16] help me remember
[47:18] but look the bible said he's scourged
[47:19] now this word scourge is used 13 times
[47:23] and it all means a physical whipping
[47:26] it actually means a blow a blow with a
[47:28] stick the word blow is actually used in
[47:29] the greek
[47:31] so this the so uh the bible said he
[47:33] scourges everyone it's not a physical
[47:35] blow
[47:36] now you might suffer physically for some
[47:38] mistake you made
[47:40] right but these are spiritual blows
[47:44] so in other words church god is going to
[47:46] humble you in your mind
[47:49] i'm not as great as i thought i was
[47:52] i'm not as perfect as i thought i was
[47:55] and you got to feel
[47:56] he wants you to feel so low that you you
[47:58] depend
[47:59] more on him not that you have a pity
[48:00] party and let the devil beat you up but
[48:02] you realize
[48:03] i'm nothing without him amen and then
[48:05] that fulfills the scripture blessed are
[48:07] the poor in spirit
[48:09] they know how poor uh mor morally they
[48:12] are without the
[48:13] leadership of the holy spirit without
[48:16] humbling myself
[48:17] in prayer and and saying before god in
[48:19] prayer
[48:20] and and surrendering to god i'm gonna
[48:22] fall short of the glory
[48:27] and so the brother says god programs god
[48:30] carries a big stick well the bible says
[48:31] he carries a big stick in the new
[48:33] testament
[48:37] and this is the same scourging as they
[48:39] scourged jesus
[48:41] now what was scourging remember they
[48:42] took him they tied him up and they
[48:44] whipped him
[48:45] so it's the same so spiritually god is
[48:47] gonna have to whip us sometimes
[48:52] right and what the bible say we're like
[48:54] we're like sheep dumb
[48:55] and we're delivered to the slaughter all
[48:57] the day long
[49:00] so sometimes they're just whipping and
[49:01] oh you shouldn't do that you shouldn't
[49:03] do that now church when we
[49:04] repent then we repent and then the
[49:06] whipping stops
[49:07] right we learn how many want to learn
[49:08] your lesson and not get whipped all day
[49:11] see the only reason a message person
[49:13] will get whipped all day is because
[49:14] they're totally backslidden
[49:16] right or not totally or maybe partially
[49:19] like why don't you just confess it say
[49:21] you're sorry and do different act
[49:22] differently praise god
[49:24] take the word of god and obey it and
[49:26] speak to that
[49:27] that trouble speak to it and and receive
[49:30] god's power
[49:31] and let the obedience of god surrender
[49:33] your will and don't live
[49:35] all day like you're getting whipped come
[49:37] out of that and learn the lesson and
[49:39] move on
[49:40] and be let god be glorified in your life
[49:44] yeah there are message people that get
[49:45] beaten all day long and and uh
[49:47] but that's their own fault
[49:51] because after a while it's not god
[49:52] anymore it's the devil they're letting
[49:53] the devil beat them up
[49:55] like i'll never be a good christian i'll
[49:56] never you can't say that
[49:58] got to say i'm sorry lord i'm so sorry
[50:01] my fault my mistake forgive me god help
[50:03] me jesus
[50:04] help me do better tomorrow i'll help me
[50:05] to overcome
[50:10] so yes god is a god a great god who
[50:13] carries a big stick
[50:15] he is now here's the examples i had
[50:19] uh we're all scourge's sons lydia
[50:22] as many as i love it's revelation 13.
[50:25] i'm sorry revelation 3.
[50:27] so lydia uh let me get that scripture if
[50:30] you got it you can read it i know you
[50:31] probably know which one i'm talking
[50:32] about
[50:37] it's 3
[50:46] praise god so all jesus asks is that we
[50:49] zealously that means eagerly
[50:52] repent
[50:54] so message people uh if they don't
[50:57] zealously repent if they half-heartedly
[50:59] repent well i still want to do this sin
[51:01] i still want to enjoy this i still like
[51:03] then of course you're going to keep
[51:04] getting whipped
[51:06] right brother brahm called it haunting
[51:09] remember that remember that word
[51:10] haunting
[51:11] he said his critical spirit haunted him
[51:15] yeah yeah you're going to feel like my
[51:17] sins are haunting me because you're not
[51:18] putting them under the blood
[51:20] right we gotta have thorough repentance
[51:23] brother ramsay or true repentance
[51:26] or else you're gonna feel like yeah god
[51:28] is whipping me all day what's because
[51:29] you won't repent
[51:31] he carries a big stick yes he's trying
[51:33] to get you to surrender and obey
[51:40] because if he loves you you'll repent
[51:42] i'm sorry if he loves you
[51:43] uh yes if he loves you he'll correct you
[51:46] and then you repent
[51:47] now david and bathsheba's baby died
[51:49] because of their sin
[51:53] i thought god was love all the time well
[51:56] sometimes god does show a great mercy
[51:58] but sometimes god has to do harsh things
[52:02] to try to get people's attention many
[52:04] times it's dependent upon their sin
[52:06] so malachi we're in second samuel 12.
[52:22] let me get there by god's grace didn't
[52:24] have the time i wanted to look at all of
[52:25] them here
[52:29] okay maokai if you would uh read
[52:32] 12 11 and 12 and 13.
[52:58] foreign
[53:04] all right now look is this does this god
[53:07] carry a big stick
[53:08] absolutely you did a secret sin awful
[53:11] thing
[53:12] well then you're gonna be have
[53:13] consequences publicly
[53:16] not in secret see
[53:20] but look is there is there mercy uh is
[53:22] there mercy mixed in there with
[53:24] the chastisement yes he could have he
[53:26] could have died
[53:27] under the the evil that i did the murder
[53:29] and the adultery he could have died
[53:31] but god gave him grace and said but
[53:32] you'll not die
[53:36] but you know what he had to live with
[53:37] that shame the rest of his life
[53:40] he had to live with the consequences the
[53:42] rest of his life
[53:48] look at verse 15 and nathan departed
[53:51] unto his house and the lord struck the
[53:53] child
[53:55] did the child do anything wrong no
[53:57] church
[53:58] didn't do anything wrong
[54:01] that you rise wife there unto david and
[54:03] it was very sick
[54:06] yet we know david i think prayed before
[54:07] it was at seven days
[54:09] when the house of the lord and look at
[54:10] verse 22 after
[54:12] after it passed away and he said while
[54:14] the child was yet alive i fasted and
[54:16] wept for i said
[54:17] who can tell whether god will be
[54:18] gracious to me that the child may live
[54:22] but now he's dead wherefore should i
[54:23] fast can i bring him back again
[54:25] i shall go to him and he shall not
[54:27] return to me
[54:30] so david he knew god had showed him
[54:32] grace
[54:33] but yet he was still seeking god if god
[54:36] would give him more grace and
[54:37] to show his sincerity now look how
[54:39] sincere that is he laid before the lord
[54:41] wouldn't eat
[54:42] they begged him to eat he wouldn't eat
[54:44] until he realized that
[54:45] the baby had passed
[54:49] but does our god carry a big stick
[54:51] absolutely
[54:53] but does he also supply a lot of grace
[54:56] absolutely praise god
[55:01] and as parents that's what god is
[55:02] teaching us there's times we've got to
[55:04] be really
[55:05] harsh and sincere with something right
[55:09] but then there's times to show grace
[55:14] and the way to know is just in the
[55:16] moment say god guide me
[55:18] god guide me in church we got to be
[55:21] aware
[55:22] if we didn't pray that morning if we
[55:23] didn't have a if we realized we've been
[55:25] cranky all day or didn't get enough
[55:27] sleep or
[55:27] you know we gotta say god give me grace
[55:30] not to make the wrong choice
[55:33] right we can't put our frustration out
[55:35] on them
[55:36] but we know children need uh
[55:40] just correction right
[55:44] the bible said if you don't correct them
[55:45] leave them to their self they're gonna
[55:46] go astray and their souls will be lost
[55:48] i'm paraphrasing that's in proverbs now
[55:52] uh for time sake elisha's servant was
[55:55] cursed with leprosy for all generations
[55:58] so get he's a servant now that's that's
[56:01] a hard thing to understand
[56:05] remember uh naaman it might have been
[56:07] elisha
[56:08] uh naaman got healed right
[56:11] as he was leaving he tried to give
[56:13] elijah gift he said how could i take a
[56:14] gift this god did this
[56:17] he left but hazel went out and said
[56:18] we'll take those garments
[56:21] and elijah said gaze this ain't a time
[56:23] to receive the gift of god
[56:26] and god smote him with leprosy and all
[56:28] of his seat after him
[56:33] god is a god of correction
[56:36] he should have known better he was
[56:37] around the prophet can you imagine being
[56:38] around the prophet the whole time and
[56:39] the prophet said don't take a gift you
[56:41] don't take a gift
[56:43] but it's lust for money or lust for
[56:45] popularity or whatever it was
[56:48] it caused the all the generations
[56:50] afterwards
[56:51] to have leprosy god flooded the earth
[56:55] due to constant evil thoughts and deeds
[56:57] that's animals
[56:59] and and humans grandpas grandmas
[57:02] children
[57:03] god flooded all of it because only evil
[57:06] was on their hearts continually
[57:08] and he preached for what maybe 100 year
[57:10] 120 years preaching and warning them
[57:12] get away from this come into the ark
[57:15] there's salvation
[57:17] live a life of righteousness praise god
[57:19] amen
[57:22] and after 120 years god said that give
[57:25] enough time
[57:26] i've given them so much time i've got to
[57:28] correct them
[57:32] let's read this one again this one's uh
[57:35] just so striking uh second corinthians
[57:38] 12.
[57:50] this is what i was saying in the debate
[57:52] you know uh
[57:55] the other side and then of course every
[57:57] other uh
[58:00] you know person who's on the the the
[58:04] the disgrace side i'll say like that the
[58:06] disgrace side they always say you know
[58:08] oh well ephesians 2 8 we're saved by
[58:11] grace through faith well we're just
[58:12] saying by grace through faith say about
[58:14] grace today
[58:15] and then church and then that such a
[58:17] it's such a flimsy argument
[58:18] that they don't even see what what else
[58:20] paul said
[58:22] paul said examine yourself to see if
[58:23] you're in the faith he said if not
[58:25] you'll reprobate
[58:27] so paul wasn't preaching you know easy
[58:29] grace and
[58:30] and everybody saved and every he said
[58:33] grace is the amazing thing that saves us
[58:35] but we gotta
[58:36] be grateful for the gift and then thank
[58:38] god and live a life of gratitude
[58:40] after we've received the gift of grace
[58:47] so the same man that was saved by grace
[58:50] and taught were saved by grace the same
[58:52] man would get prideful at times so god
[58:55] had to humble him
[58:58] and not with loving
[59:01] loving oh you know paul you really need
[59:03] to humble yourself and
[59:05] would you please humble yourself paul
[59:08] i mean is that that's what people think
[59:11] is just a soft gentle preacher paul
[59:13] could
[59:14] could you be more humble today excuse me
[59:16] paul
[59:17] no god sent a demon to humble him
[59:21] a tormenting devil but yet we're saved
[59:24] by grace
[59:25] i'm saying by grace through faith god
[59:27] loves me god loves yes he does
[59:28] and he knows exactly how to get you
[59:30] humble
[59:32] does god carry a big stick absolutely
[59:37] see these are just these are just
[59:40] weak arguments they're just thrown out
[59:43] there that people
[59:44] cling to and you know they you know you
[59:46] know why they want to say that
[59:47] because they know they're guilty and
[59:49] that will kind of relieve their
[59:50] conscience a little bit but it's a lie
[59:52] their conscience is seared
[59:55] when they say that oh god is a god of
[59:57] love he doesn't punish me he doesn't
[59:59] he doesn't correct me he doesn't carry a
[1:00:02] big stick oh yes he does
[1:00:07] singer in these 12.
[1:00:14] verse 7 and lest i should be exalted
[1:00:16] above measure through the abundance of
[1:00:17] revelations
[1:00:19] there was given to me a thorn in my
[1:00:21] flesh
[1:00:25] the messenger of satan to buff at me
[1:00:29] lest i should be
[1:00:30] exalted above measure
[1:00:34] so god knew jesus knew paul's going to
[1:00:36] get prideful
[1:00:38] and because i love him i'm going to send
[1:00:41] him
[1:00:42] a buffeting demon so he doesn't get
[1:00:44] packed
[1:00:48] now look church this is the approach so
[1:00:50] so his attitude on this should be our
[1:00:52] attitude on anything
[1:00:54] bad that happens right
[1:00:58] lord please take this cancer away can i
[1:01:00] just say like that
[1:01:01] lord please take this coronavirus away
[1:01:05] lord please take this headache away or
[1:01:07] what you name it right
[1:01:09] that is the right approach lord take it
[1:01:12] away
[1:01:13] if it's your will right god please
[1:01:16] deliver me from it
[1:01:18] because paul asked three times not one
[1:01:20] time three times
[1:01:22] three times oh loving father can you
[1:01:25] imagine that
[1:01:26] oh loving god take away this demon from
[1:01:28] me
[1:01:29] the loving god said my grace is
[1:01:32] sufficient for you
[1:01:34] in weakness that'll really turn over
[1:01:37] some new leaves and people's lives
[1:01:38] wanted
[1:01:39] i better turn over something new i
[1:01:41] better try something i better think
[1:01:42] differently
[1:01:44] oh loving god and loving god of mercy uh
[1:01:47] david could have said please don't take
[1:01:49] my child but yet god did
[1:01:52] because god is a god of mercy and god
[1:01:55] knows what's best how many know that god
[1:01:58] said
[1:01:58] i don't need your counsel i don't need
[1:02:01] the counsel of man
[1:02:02] i'm smart enough to know right
[1:02:05] i don't need the brothers counsel i
[1:02:07] don't need the sister's counsel my
[1:02:08] counsel
[1:02:09] will stand my counsel's right i don't
[1:02:11] have a second thought about anything
[1:02:13] my first thought is always right amen
[1:02:17] i don't need to ask the devil for his
[1:02:18] opinion i don't need to ask you for your
[1:02:20] opinion
[1:02:21] i know what's best for my children and
[1:02:23] i'll do what's best and i'll i'll bring
[1:02:25] them into humility
[1:02:26] and i'll teach them to trust in me and
[1:02:28] not to get prideful
[1:02:29] and just always trust and and thank god
[1:02:32] for the grace that i give them that they
[1:02:34] can make it through the trials they face
[1:02:39] huh a messenger of satan from the god of
[1:02:41] love
[1:02:45] so the god of love sends the opposite
[1:02:48] the god of this world
[1:02:50] what about that
[1:02:54] so church we got to be aware verse 8 for
[1:02:57] this thing i besought the lord thrice
[1:02:58] that it might depart from me
[1:03:00] and he said to me my grace is sufficient
[1:03:02] for thee for my
[1:03:03] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:03:06] how are we going to be strong by
[1:03:07] realizing how little we are
[1:03:10] when we realize how little we are and
[1:03:12] not to get exalted in me
[1:03:14] because i got the revelation of the
[1:03:16] message
[1:03:17] amen we have we have an abundance of
[1:03:20] revelations
[1:03:21] right we have serpent seed in godhead
[1:03:24] and daniel 70 weeks all these abundance
[1:03:27] of revelations
[1:03:28] god help me not to be exalted well god
[1:03:30] may just send something in your life to
[1:03:32] keep you humble
[1:03:36] he may do it church and then he'll say
[1:03:38] my grace
[1:03:39] is sufficient when you're weak trust in
[1:03:43] my grace you're the one that wrote i'm
[1:03:44] saved by grace through faith
[1:03:46] you're the one that wrote it so trust in
[1:03:47] the grace of god
[1:03:49] trust in the favor of god trust in the
[1:03:52] unmerited favor of god
[1:03:53] even while a satanic buffeting messenger
[1:03:57] is
[1:03:57] hurting me yes trust in the grace of god
[1:04:05] and those are beautiful red letter words
[1:04:08] that's love
[1:04:10] don't forget though paul had great
[1:04:12] miracles right paul was raised from the
[1:04:14] dead right
[1:04:15] paul raised uticus from the dead he had
[1:04:17] great highs and mountains and
[1:04:19] mountain tops and everything but he also
[1:04:21] had some dark valleys
[1:04:25] most gladly therefore will i rather
[1:04:28] glory in my infirmities
[1:04:30] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:04:33] me
[1:04:34] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[1:04:36] in reproaches and
[1:04:37] necessities and persecutions and
[1:04:39] distresses for christ's sake for when i
[1:04:42] am weak
[1:04:42] then i am strong amen see when we're
[1:04:45] humble when we realize we're nothing
[1:04:47] when we realize that it's not because of
[1:04:49] anything good we've done
[1:04:50] then we're strong we're strong in the
[1:04:52] word of god we're trusting in god
[1:04:54] we only say his word we won't say our
[1:04:57] word we won't take any credit for
[1:04:58] ourselves we'll give jesus all the
[1:05:00] credit
[1:05:04] for when i'm weak then i'm strong
[1:05:09] so strength comes from recognizing god's
[1:05:12] grace in every situation
[1:05:18] well does god carry a big stick
[1:05:20] certainly does
[1:05:22] certainly those are just a few examples
[1:05:23] i came up with just real quick
[1:05:26] so god gives blows he he uh chastens
[1:05:29] every sun
[1:05:33] with a stick that's the context
[1:05:37] all right so now let me move back to
[1:05:40] this one
[1:05:40] the other thing that was brought up was
[1:05:43] uh
[1:05:44] the precious brother tim i think his
[1:05:46] name tim cross
[1:05:47] he said well he said brother jesse he
[1:05:49] said you got to understand he said it
[1:05:50] really nice
[1:05:51] he said a covenant is different than a
[1:05:53] new testament remember i'm the whole
[1:05:54] point is i'm trying to show deuteronomy
[1:05:55] 22 5 and the new
[1:05:57] and the 10 commandments still pertain to
[1:05:59] us today
[1:06:01] he said well you know a covenant is
[1:06:03] different than a testament brother
[1:06:07] yeah i just studied on covenants a few
[1:06:09] months ago so i was
[1:06:10] i didn't have time to say it but church
[1:06:13] the covenant is
[1:06:14] a covenant literally means a testament
[1:06:17] literally it's another
[1:06:18] synonym form okay
[1:06:22] so covenant is used for testament 33
[1:06:25] times the new testament
[1:06:28] in the new covenant so they're
[1:06:30] synonymous they're not different words
[1:06:32] they're the same and so see like
[1:06:35] where is that thought even in the bible
[1:06:37] that that a covenant you'll see
[1:06:38] well we're under the new covenant not
[1:06:40] the not the old
[1:06:42] testament you know they're trying to
[1:06:43] separate these things and
[1:06:45] we don't need the old testament so
[1:06:48] they're different
[1:06:49] but no they're one in the same praise
[1:06:51] god
[1:06:52] a covenant is a testament
[1:06:56] and remember it's the righteousness of
[1:06:58] the law that's fulfilled in us
[1:07:01] praise god so new testament holy ghost
[1:07:04] phil saints
[1:07:05] live righteously that the old testament
[1:07:08] couldn't live right
[1:07:09] because they had a remembrance of sin
[1:07:11] praise god they had a remembrance of
[1:07:13] their sins year after year
[1:07:14] but we're supposed to come to the house
[1:07:16] of god we're supposed to come to the
[1:07:18] altar and forget all of our sins praise
[1:07:20] god
[1:07:21] amen hallelujah we're supposed to know
[1:07:23] that we are forgiven
[1:07:25] we're separated from our sins our sins
[1:07:27] are abolished right
[1:07:28] they're done away with they're remitted
[1:07:30] they're sent away we're supposed to
[1:07:32] leave here feeling forgiven praise god
[1:07:34] they can never do that under the blood
[1:07:36] of bulls and goats but the blood of
[1:07:38] jesus christ
[1:07:39] separates us from all our
[1:07:40] unrighteousness praise god
[1:07:42] and then we leave here feeling great
[1:07:44] about what god has done
[1:07:47] not about ourselves now we can feel good
[1:07:49] and thankful for the situation we're in
[1:07:53] but they could never do that remember i
[1:07:55] went through that a few months ago
[1:07:57] the bible says that in hebrews the
[1:07:59] worshiper was
[1:08:00] he was purged in his flesh but never his
[1:08:03] mind
[1:08:04] his mind was never purged from from his
[1:08:07] guilt
[1:08:08] and he had a remembrance of the sin as
[1:08:11] soon as he left worshipping
[1:08:15] so abraham we could say he could have
[1:08:17] gave a sacrifice for lying
[1:08:19] but then as he walked away he would
[1:08:21] still have that guilt in his heart
[1:08:24] but church we can lie and say jesus
[1:08:26] forgive me i'll never do that again and
[1:08:28] walk away and feel great
[1:08:30] and feel forgiven by god's grace
[1:08:36] so that argument doesn't work
[1:08:40] because whatever and here's here's what
[1:08:42] i'll say whatever god wants to continue
[1:08:44] from the old testament to the new it's
[1:08:46] still in effect
[1:08:47] it's god's choice it's not our choice
[1:08:49] it's not a cut and dry thing
[1:08:50] we have to search the scriptures for in
[1:08:52] them we think we have eternal life
[1:08:54] praise god
[1:08:56] and they testify of jesus christ
[1:08:58] remember they were searching their
[1:08:59] mishnas
[1:09:00] but the real bereans searched the
[1:09:02] scriptures daily praise god
[1:09:04] amen that's right
[1:09:09] now the third point they made or against
[1:09:11] me
[1:09:13] i was saying how paul paul was filled
[1:09:16] with the holy ghost saved by grace
[1:09:18] and yet he said in romans 17 he said i
[1:09:20] still do things that i hate
[1:09:23] and the brother said no that was when
[1:09:25] paul was a sinner i said no that was
[1:09:27] when he was saved
[1:09:28] so let's read it romans 7.
[1:09:33] so look at 14 and 15. paul said i am not
[1:09:36] i was
[1:09:38] paul says i do not i did so let's go to
[1:09:41] romans 7.
[1:09:42] well you're probably there i need to
[1:09:44] turn there romans 7.
[1:09:48] now i was looking this chapter over
[1:09:49] there's nothing in here uh that paul
[1:09:52] says well i'm only talking about my past
[1:10:00] life
[1:10:08] okay romans let's go to 13
[1:10:12] was then that which is good made death
[1:10:13] unto me god forbid but sin that it might
[1:10:15] appear sin working death in me by that
[1:10:18] which is good
[1:10:19] that sin by the commandment might become
[1:10:21] exceeding sinful
[1:10:23] for we know that the law is spiritual
[1:10:25] but i am carnal
[1:10:27] sold under sin notice i am carnal he
[1:10:29] still had a carnal part
[1:10:31] for that which i do i allow not
[1:10:35] not i did notice now i did
[1:10:38] that which i do i allow not
[1:10:41] okay verse finishing verse 15. but what
[1:10:44] i hate
[1:10:45] that i do if then i do that which i
[1:10:48] would not i can say unto the law
[1:10:50] that it is good now there is no more i
[1:10:53] that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
[1:10:56] for i know that in me that is in my
[1:10:59] flesh dwelleth no good thing
[1:11:01] for to will is present with me but how
[1:11:03] to perform that which is good
[1:11:04] i find not she's not saying i i found
[1:11:08] not he said i find right now
[1:11:10] it's always it's present tense for the
[1:11:13] good that i would
[1:11:14] i do not but the evil which i would not
[1:11:17] that i do
[1:11:18] now if i do that i would not it is no
[1:11:20] more i that do it but sin
[1:11:22] that dwelleth within me what a
[1:11:23] revelation praise god
[1:11:25] what a revelation for a believer to say
[1:11:27] when i sin it's really not my soul
[1:11:30] it's my flesh and my mind praise god
[1:11:33] it's the sin that dwells in me it's not
[1:11:35] i that sin the soul
[1:11:37] it's my body and mind that sin
[1:11:42] verse 21 i find a law that when i would
[1:11:44] when i would do
[1:11:45] good evil is present with me for i
[1:11:48] delight in the law of god
[1:11:49] after the inward man
[1:11:52] but i see another law of my members
[1:11:54] warren against the law of my mind
[1:11:56] and bringing me into captivity to the
[1:11:58] law of sin
[1:12:00] which is in my members amen see there's
[1:12:02] there's the greatest battle ever fault
[1:12:04] right
[1:12:05] warring against my mind praise god
[1:12:08] this is a mind battle this is a mind war
[1:12:14] we are fighting the greatest battle ever
[1:12:15] fought church but thank god we're given
[1:12:17] the greatest revelation of god's word as
[1:12:20] well
[1:12:20] amen hallelujah
[1:12:27] verse 23 but i see another law my
[1:12:31] members warn against the law of my mind
[1:12:32] and bringing me into captivity
[1:12:33] to the law of sin which is in my memory
[1:12:36] so where do we
[1:12:37] where do we become slaves in our minds
[1:12:39] like that song says a prisoner in your
[1:12:41] mind
[1:12:42] that's where paul became a slave that's
[1:12:44] where all of us become a slave
[1:12:46] but don't stop reading he said oh
[1:12:48] wretched man that i was
[1:12:52] he don't say that churches i know early
[1:12:54] in the chapter he was talking about
[1:12:56] before he was a christian
[1:12:58] but here he said wretched man that i am
[1:13:00] because remember you got to remember
[1:13:01] remember the other scripture we read
[1:13:03] he was going to get exalted through
[1:13:04] revelations right
[1:13:07] is that a good man or is that a wretched
[1:13:08] man was that the good part of him or the
[1:13:10] wretched part that's the ratchet part
[1:13:12] the wretched part would think i'm
[1:13:13] somebody i deserve all these revelations
[1:13:16] but paul said it's a o wretched man that
[1:13:18] i am
[1:13:21] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:13:23] this death
[1:13:25] i thank god through jesus christ our
[1:13:27] lord so that with the mind i myself
[1:13:30] serve the law of god but with the flesh
[1:13:33] the law of sin
[1:13:34] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:13:37] to them
[1:13:37] which are in christ jesus who walk not
[1:13:40] after the flesh
[1:13:41] but after the spirit praise god amen
[1:13:44] do you see anything in there church that
[1:13:47] says
[1:13:48] that this is only dealing with paul
[1:13:51] before he became a christian
[1:13:53] no he says i am
[1:13:56] i the things i do i hate i do them right
[1:13:59] now
[1:14:00] right and then he says oh wretched man
[1:14:02] that i
[1:14:03] am there's nothing in there but look how
[1:14:06] i'll say it like this look how the enemy
[1:14:08] will try to twist this and say oh well
[1:14:10] see paul
[1:14:10] paul was so much more holy now he was
[1:14:13] holy one way
[1:14:14] but they tried to make it like oh well
[1:14:15] brother i made two mistakes there's no
[1:14:17] way he was born again oh nonsense
[1:14:20] paul said i the things i want to do i
[1:14:22] don't do sometimes and the things that i
[1:14:25] i do things that i hate sometimes he
[1:14:27] says i'm a wretched man
[1:14:29] but thank you jesus for giving me the
[1:14:31] victory in my mind
[1:14:33] through the lord jesus christ hallelujah
[1:14:37] amen thank the lord
[1:14:41] hallelujah this whole the whole passage
[1:14:43] is present tense
[1:14:44] all the way down to verse 25
[1:14:47] it's not past tense
[1:14:51] all right i'll take about 15 more
[1:14:52] minutes here let me i'll just go about
[1:14:53] an hour here lord
[1:14:55] now the second question that he asked me
[1:14:57] that remember the first one was
[1:14:58] king james version went over that on
[1:15:00] sunday the second one was
[1:15:02] he goes through all these things brother
[1:15:03] graham said he says the way of doubt is
[1:15:06] overwhelming on brother bannon's
[1:15:07] ministry
[1:15:08] what do we do with deuteronomy 18
[1:15:11] 20-22 so let's read that what do we do
[1:15:13] with that
[1:15:20] deuteronomy 18 20-22
[1:15:32] in church this is where i i can totally
[1:15:34] understand why people would be confused
[1:15:36] in the message
[1:15:39] and if they didn't sit long enough and
[1:15:41] study something and pray about something
[1:15:43] i could easily see how people would be
[1:15:45] confused with some things brother
[1:15:46] branham said
[1:15:47] especially with the brown bear which
[1:15:49] i'll talk about next but let's look at
[1:15:51] that
[1:15:51] deuteronomy 18 20 but the prophet which
[1:15:54] shall presume
[1:15:55] to speak a word in my name which i have
[1:15:56] not commanded him to speak
[1:15:58] or that shall speak in the name of other
[1:16:00] gods even that prophet shall die
[1:16:02] and if thou say in that in heart how
[1:16:04] shall we know the word which
[1:16:05] the lord hath not spoken when a prophet
[1:16:08] speaketh in the name of the lord
[1:16:09] if the thing follow not nor come to pass
[1:16:12] that is a thing which the lord
[1:16:13] hath not spoken but the prophet has
[1:16:15] spoken it presumptuously
[1:16:17] thou shalt not be afraid of him
[1:16:21] okay so let me pull up my notes here for
[1:16:23] my answer to number two
[1:16:26] the second question
[1:16:36] oh there's okay all right so
[1:16:40] this is quite a statement that uh moses
[1:16:44] makes in deuteronomy
[1:16:45] how i know a prophet of god if what he
[1:16:47] says comes to pass he's a prophet
[1:16:50] but even then you've got to test him
[1:16:51] because if it comes to pass well this
[1:16:53] was in chapter 13
[1:16:54] if it comes to passing tells you to go
[1:16:55] worship other gods he said then kill him
[1:16:57] stone him
[1:16:58] so even if something comes to pass you
[1:17:00] got to see what he says afterwards
[1:17:02] praise god so just something coming to
[1:17:05] pass isn't enough
[1:17:06] he has to have the voice the right voice
[1:17:08] behind the sign
[1:17:10] the sign as it came to pass but the
[1:17:12] voice behind it that comes after it
[1:17:13] has to be a scriptural sign
[1:17:17] so in brother man's story uh i don't
[1:17:20] have the quotes right here but
[1:17:21] brother ram tells a story he sees a
[1:17:23] vision in 1962
[1:17:24] he said i'm going to shoot a brown bear
[1:17:27] he said i saw it it's going to be brown
[1:17:29] it's going to be this place there's
[1:17:30] going to be a brother with a checkered
[1:17:31] shirt on a green checkered shirt on
[1:17:34] okay he tells his church and it says he
[1:17:36] said it he said thus saith the lord it
[1:17:38] will be
[1:17:39] it will be okay
[1:17:42] three or four months later he comes back
[1:17:44] and tells the tabernacle he said well
[1:17:45] we saw the brown bear the brother had
[1:17:48] the checkered shirt on
[1:17:49] but i disobeyed the brothers asked me
[1:17:51] twice to go with them to go up and shoot
[1:17:53] it
[1:17:54] he said but he turned it down and he
[1:17:55] said i failed the vision
[1:17:58] he said god's vision didn't fail but i
[1:18:00] failed the vision and so
[1:18:02] the believe the sign people say well see
[1:18:04] he said something's gonna come to pass
[1:18:06] and then it didn't so he must not be a
[1:18:10] prophet
[1:18:12] okay and this is where this shook me up
[1:18:14] for a while
[1:18:15] like i said the reason i haven't debated
[1:18:17] him for the 12 year
[1:18:18] uh eight years is because i didn't know
[1:18:20] the answers i knew what brother i'm
[1:18:22] talking the word was right and i knew
[1:18:23] other prophecies has come to pass
[1:18:25] but this one i didn't know
[1:18:35] so i said with this one is that you have
[1:18:37] to look brother god gave brother branham
[1:18:38] a vision
[1:18:40] and then i realized every vision is
[1:18:42] either conditional or it's unconditional
[1:18:46] okay and there was many examples uh paul
[1:18:50] said i have not been disobedient to the
[1:18:51] heavenly vision well that means he could
[1:18:53] have been
[1:18:54] this will be into heavenly vision right
[1:18:57] and then there was uh king saul before
[1:19:00] he became king samuel said
[1:19:02] go do this you'll see this sign that
[1:19:04] sign that sign
[1:19:05] but he obeyed all the signs but it
[1:19:08] leaves
[1:19:08] it leaves the truth that he could have
[1:19:10] disobeyed the signs
[1:19:12] right and then the understanding came to
[1:19:14] me
[1:19:15] any word of god any promise of god is
[1:19:18] either unconditional or
[1:19:19] conditional any vision of god is either
[1:19:22] unconditional or conditional okay
[1:19:26] and so the example were king king saul
[1:19:29] he said the bible said if you are
[1:19:32] faithful to the king
[1:19:33] the bible says that you will your
[1:19:35] children will inherit the throne in the
[1:19:36] next generation
[1:19:38] and saul disobeyed so that that was thus
[1:19:40] saith the lord
[1:19:41] but because he disobeyed it was taken
[1:19:42] from king saul and given to david right
[1:19:46] and then joshua 1 god told joshua every
[1:19:48] place you put your feet will be yours
[1:19:50] that was a thus saith the lord these
[1:19:52] will be your coasts
[1:19:54] uh but joshua's generation some of them
[1:19:56] disobeyed
[1:19:57] they disobeyed us at the lord so they
[1:19:59] didn't inherit it
[1:20:02] and so we look at brother branham and
[1:20:04] the brown bear he didn't say thus saith
[1:20:06] the lord i'll shoot it he said thus
[1:20:07] saith the lord it will be
[1:20:09] well he didn't tell us what parts of the
[1:20:10] vision would be thus saith the lord
[1:20:13] he just said it will be and everything
[1:20:16] as far as the brown bear it was the
[1:20:18] brown bear was there the checkered shirt
[1:20:19] was there
[1:20:20] but he had disobeyed at the end and he
[1:20:22] didn't get to shoot the bear
[1:20:25] now is that hard to understand yeah it's
[1:20:27] hard to understand
[1:20:29] but we have to also understand that a
[1:20:31] prophet that we've never lived among the
[1:20:33] prophet before we don't know how god
[1:20:34] works with them
[1:20:35] right and so it has to be that if
[1:20:38] everything else if all these other
[1:20:39] things came to pass
[1:20:41] and this one he disobeyed then it has to
[1:20:43] be an unconditional promise
[1:20:45] it has to be i'm sorry it has to be a
[1:20:48] conditional problem sorry
[1:20:50] it had to be a conditional promise
[1:20:53] so that's where i i brought it down with
[1:20:55] a brown bear because there's so many
[1:20:57] scriptures where they're conditional now
[1:20:59] my wife shared a good one with me today
[1:21:01] so
[1:21:01] let's go to jonah chapter three jonah
[1:21:09] daniel hosea joel namus obadiah jonah
[1:21:17] jonah 3.
[1:21:23] look at jonah 3 verse 1 and the word
[1:21:25] lord came unto jonah the second time
[1:21:27] saying
[1:21:27] arise go into nineveh that great city
[1:21:29] and preach
[1:21:30] unto it the preaching that i bid thee
[1:21:33] and jonah rose and went under nineveh
[1:21:35] according to the word of the lord now
[1:21:36] nineveh was an exceeding great city of
[1:21:38] three days journey
[1:21:40] and jonah began to enter into the city a
[1:21:42] day's journey and he
[1:21:43] cried and said yep 40 days and nineveh
[1:21:45] shall be thrown down
[1:21:47] so the people of nineveh believed god
[1:21:49] and proclaimed the fast and put on
[1:21:51] sackcloth
[1:21:52] from the greatest of them even to the
[1:21:53] least of them
[1:21:58] okay so if you look at the scripture
[1:22:00] this is basically thus saith the lord
[1:22:01] yet 40 days and nineveh shall be thrown
[1:22:04] down
[1:22:05] okay so it's basically thus saith the
[1:22:07] lord in 40 days nineveh is going to go
[1:22:10] down but was this was this conditional
[1:22:13] or unconditional
[1:22:15] conditional what does it sound like it
[1:22:17] sounds
[1:22:18] unconditional doesn't it church there's
[1:22:20] no if put in here
[1:22:22] right there's no if it just says yet
[1:22:24] forty days
[1:22:25] and nineveh shall be thrown down and
[1:22:28] church that's why
[1:22:29] jonah was so mad at the end right
[1:22:32] jonah was so mad because he said it's
[1:22:34] going to be thrown you're gonna
[1:22:36] it's gonna be crushed in 40 days
[1:22:39] but then god had mercy and what did the
[1:22:42] lord say
[1:22:43] in chapter 4 verse 10 and then the lord
[1:22:45] said thou hast
[1:22:46] had pity on the gourd for thou for which
[1:22:48] thou hast not labored neither made us to
[1:22:50] grow which came up in a night and at
[1:22:52] perishing tonight
[1:22:53] and should not i spare nineveh that
[1:22:54] great city wearing are more than
[1:22:56] six score thousand persons that cannot
[1:22:58] discern between their right or left hand
[1:23:00] which also and also much cattle
[1:23:05] now in when bro when jonah was preaching
[1:23:07] he just said 40 days i'm going to
[1:23:08] destroy this place
[1:23:09] 40 days he didn't say it just was us at
[1:23:11] the lord it's going to be 40 days
[1:23:13] and god showed mercy praise god
[1:23:17] it was conditional but it doesn't sound
[1:23:19] conditional
[1:23:20] that's like brother brahms brown bear it
[1:23:22] sounds unconditional but it was
[1:23:24] conditional
[1:23:27] and the only way to know is just make
[1:23:29] sure it's a prophet of god and see the
[1:23:31] results afterwards that's the only way
[1:23:32] to know right
[1:23:34] same thing with david we're not we're
[1:23:37] not told it was uh
[1:23:38] conditional with the bull with the baby
[1:23:40] boy but he thought it might be
[1:23:42] right he just know it got sick he didn't
[1:23:45] have a thus saith the lord so he's
[1:23:46] pleading with god uh
[1:23:47] let it be conditional and have mercy on
[1:23:49] the child right let the sickness be
[1:23:51] conditional
[1:23:52] not unconditional and yet it turned out
[1:23:55] to be conditional
[1:23:56] i'm sorry it's gonna be unconditional
[1:23:58] where god was gonna take the baby
[1:24:00] regardless of what david did
[1:24:01] even in all sincerity
[1:24:04] but church i'm bringing that out to show
[1:24:06] that that and that's why i told brother
[1:24:08] rod i said you got to look at every case
[1:24:09] individually
[1:24:12] and then he said well how can you ever
[1:24:13] know if a prophet failed well if they
[1:24:15] put a time stamp on it like this has to
[1:24:17] happen by
[1:24:19] like benny hinn i don't know if you know
[1:24:20] this benny hen said god was going to
[1:24:22] destroy
[1:24:22] all the homosexuals in america in the
[1:24:24] 1990s
[1:24:26] he said that i've heard it on tape he
[1:24:28] said he said the holy spirit tells me
[1:24:30] that thus saith the lord
[1:24:31] what that's time stamped that that
[1:24:34] didn't happen
[1:24:35] right he said it's going to happen in
[1:24:37] the 90s
[1:24:38] it didn't happen in the 90s
[1:24:42] so that's what i told the brother i said
[1:24:43] you gotta look at each one individually
[1:24:45] and see is it conditional or
[1:24:47] unconditional
[1:24:50] and you gotta be able to discern that
[1:24:55] okay uh yeah now go to second kings 20
[1:24:59] verse 1.
[1:25:00] i'm glad that was there oh yeah i got it
[1:25:03] right here
[1:25:04] but i need five and six two seconds
[1:25:06] twenty
[1:25:07] one five and six
[1:25:12] here's something i want to bring out as
[1:25:14] well
[1:25:17] the brother says brother ram never had a
[1:25:20] vision he foretold beforehand that came
[1:25:22] to pass that was
[1:25:23] recorded before it actually took place
[1:25:27] and even on their website they have it
[1:25:29] so i don't even know
[1:25:31] he kind of he kind of criticized me a
[1:25:34] little bit but
[1:25:35] so in in 1963 brother branham said i saw
[1:25:38] a vision
[1:25:39] and florence shakarian is going to die
[1:25:42] okay now florence shakaran was a sister
[1:25:45] of demus shakarian who was like a full
[1:25:47] gospel businessman
[1:25:48] uh preacher well she had terminal cancer
[1:25:52] and it was inoperable but brother ram
[1:25:55] had a vision he announced it you know
[1:25:57] three years in advance
[1:25:59] he said foreign's gonna die
[1:26:02] now you might think and that's what
[1:26:05] brother rod said you know
[1:26:06] we might think well that's not hard to
[1:26:07] prove that's not hard to prophesy
[1:26:10] well that's true but look what has look
[1:26:13] what isaiah told hezekiah
[1:26:15] in those days was hezekiah is sick and
[1:26:17] to death and the prophet isaiah the son
[1:26:19] of amos came to him and said
[1:26:20] unto him thus saith the lord set thine
[1:26:22] house in order for thou shalt die and
[1:26:24] not live
[1:26:25] doesn't that sound pretty familiar
[1:26:26] church
[1:26:29] was hezekiah's death hard to predict was
[1:26:31] that hard to predict
[1:26:32] if he's sick unto death is it hard to
[1:26:34] predict he's going to die
[1:26:38] but yet god allowed it so brother rod
[1:26:41] criticized brother branham for telling
[1:26:43] his vision of flor and shakira's death
[1:26:46] but yet the bible shows isaiah
[1:26:49] predicting hezekiah's death
[1:26:53] and it shouldn't be hard to predict
[1:26:56] now isn't jesus christ the same
[1:26:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:27:00] now the reason brother branham's
[1:27:02] prophecy about fort chicharron
[1:27:04] was uh distinct was because brother
[1:27:07] brahma says
[1:27:08] lots of people around florida shakira
[1:27:10] were there were pentecostals
[1:27:11] they were all prophesying she's going to
[1:27:13] be well now look at that
[1:27:15] so there's numerous preachers saying
[1:27:16] they'll say the lord she's going to be
[1:27:17] well
[1:27:18] but brother i'm coming has to come
[1:27:19] around and say no i saw a vision she's
[1:27:21] going to pass
[1:27:23] that's why it's significant okay
[1:27:26] that's why it's significant
[1:27:29] now brother ram did say and brother adam
[1:27:31] use this scripture so go to verse 5 and
[1:27:33] 6.
[1:27:34] verse 5 turn again and tell hezekiah
[1:27:38] captain of my people
[1:27:39] thus saith the lord the god of david thy
[1:27:40] father i have heard that prayer
[1:27:42] i have seen thy tears behold i will heal
[1:27:44] thee on the third day thou shalt go up
[1:27:45] under the house of the lord and i will
[1:27:47] add into thy days 15 years
[1:27:49] and i will deliver thee and this city
[1:27:51] out of the hand of the king of assyria
[1:27:53] and i will defend this city for my own
[1:27:55] sake and for my servant david's sake now
[1:27:58] look
[1:27:59] this is this is quite striking isaiah
[1:28:01] goes in to set your house in order thus
[1:28:03] saith the lord you're going to die
[1:28:04] the bible says on his way out the holy
[1:28:07] spirit says go back in
[1:28:08] and tell him he's got 15 more years now
[1:28:11] was the first thus said the lord
[1:28:13] wrong no god just gave more revelation
[1:28:16] about it
[1:28:18] he still was going to die but it was
[1:28:20] going to be 15 years later
[1:28:22] so god didn't change his word he just
[1:28:25] gave more revelation about it
[1:28:28] okay and so when brother random said
[1:28:30] this about foreign security he said
[1:28:31] the lord showed me a vision she's gonna
[1:28:33] die he said this
[1:28:35] but the lord might deliver her like he
[1:28:37] did hezekiah
[1:28:39] and so that's scriptural right that's
[1:28:42] that's scripture we just read that
[1:28:43] sometimes when people are right before
[1:28:45] death they'll cry out to god and god
[1:28:47] will say i'll extend your life a little
[1:28:48] bit longer you have a little bit more
[1:28:50] time to live like keith randolph
[1:28:53] right god gave him extra time to live he
[1:28:54] said he died he saw his body
[1:28:57] he was outside of his body he saw his
[1:29:00] body
[1:29:00] and he came back into his body god gave
[1:29:02] him extra time
[1:29:06] and so the brother brother rod
[1:29:08] criticized brother branham for saying
[1:29:09] that
[1:29:11] but i want to ask you is that scripture
[1:29:12] or not yeah
[1:29:14] that is scripture even though she
[1:29:17] saw the vision of her dying little man
[1:29:19] said i saw her die she's going to pass
[1:29:21] but god may be merciful and god may
[1:29:23] extend her life like god did for
[1:29:24] hezekiah
[1:29:26] that's totally scriptural there's
[1:29:27] nothing wrong with that
[1:29:29] and in the context of it it was a
[1:29:31] significant prophecy
[1:29:33] because people around her were saying
[1:29:36] they'll say the lord she's going to live
[1:29:38] and she died and you can hear him it's
[1:29:40] in 1965 she died in 1965
[1:29:42] and he came and met with some of the
[1:29:44] family afterwards that's on tape
[1:29:46] and it was fulfilled but then but
[1:29:48] they'll still say well brother i never
[1:29:50] foretold a vision before
[1:29:52] uh it happened and it came to pass well
[1:29:54] yes he did
[1:29:57] and i'll try to close here and what
[1:30:00] about him telling
[1:30:01] florence humes go away yourself two
[1:30:04] mondays in a row and you're gonna gain
[1:30:05] weight
[1:30:07] and uh overcome tuberculosis now he
[1:30:09] didn't say thus saith the lord
[1:30:11] but he cursed satan in the name of jesus
[1:30:13] christ and said to know that i tell you
[1:30:15] the truth go away yourself the next two
[1:30:16] mondays
[1:30:17] that's foretelling the future i said
[1:30:20] well there's another one
[1:30:29] all right
[1:30:35] and i kind of had to go real real fast i
[1:30:36] said acts 2 38's a prime example the
[1:30:39] bible said you shall receive the holy
[1:30:41] ghost
[1:30:41] now what are those people going to say
[1:30:42] sister beatrice that we talked about a
[1:30:44] few weeks ago
[1:30:44] they got baptized and walked away out of
[1:30:46] the message out into the world what are
[1:30:47] they going to say
[1:30:48] the bible says you shall they could say
[1:30:50] well god you said i
[1:30:52] shall but what's he going to say it's
[1:30:54] based on your conditions
[1:30:56] you've got to come out of egypt you've
[1:30:58] got to go through the wilderness you've
[1:31:00] got to possess the promised land
[1:31:03] he's going to say it's based upon
[1:31:04] conditions
[1:31:07] but yet it's thus saith the lord if you
[1:31:09] repent and be baptized you shall receive
[1:31:11] the holy ghost
[1:31:12] thus saith the lord it's conditional
[1:31:16] it sure doesn't look conditional does it
[1:31:17] church there's no if in that scripture
[1:31:19] look it up
[1:31:20] sometimes there's no if if you obey
[1:31:24] or if you follow the three works of
[1:31:26] grace but yet that's what god meant
[1:31:31] because remember remember simon the
[1:31:32] sorcerer the bible said he was baptized
[1:31:34] and believed
[1:31:35] and then he said let me pay you money so
[1:31:37] i can do that and peter says you're in
[1:31:39] the root of bitterness
[1:31:41] so he repented got baptized but then he
[1:31:43] got he fell back into a bitter spirit
[1:31:47] how is that possible because it's based
[1:31:49] upon conditions
[1:31:50] he's got to meet the conditions he can't
[1:31:52] be tempted for power see he's still
[1:31:54] lessened for power
[1:31:55] he had demon powers over people to curse
[1:31:57] him and so he wanted powers over people
[1:32:00] to fill them with the holy ghost and
[1:32:01] that was the wrong attitude
[1:32:03] that power is not given by a man's
[1:32:05] desire that power is given by god
[1:32:07] almighty
[1:32:09] and so see that bitterness sprung up in
[1:32:10] his heart but it's by condition
[1:32:12] the holy ghost is by conditions
[1:32:16] think about how many people could use
[1:32:18] that scripture acts 2 38 and
[1:32:19] try to use it against god
[1:32:23] god's going to say it's based upon
[1:32:24] conditions you know what i'll do sister
[1:32:26] be interested he'll flip his bible over
[1:32:27] there to revelation 22 and said
[1:32:29] if anybody's thirsty come to me and i'll
[1:32:31] give you living water he's gonna say
[1:32:33] you weren't thirsty right is that what
[1:32:35] he's gonna say
[1:32:36] that's what he's gonna say you started
[1:32:37] thirsting for the things of the world
[1:32:39] but we church we're here tonight because
[1:32:41] we're thirsting on the things of god
[1:32:43] amen praise god
[1:32:47] see there's more you gotta you gotta eat
[1:32:49] the whole book
[1:32:51] you can't just see one scripture and say
[1:32:52] well i'm not a savior and i can live
[1:32:54] however i want
[1:32:55] and god's a god of love no you've got to
[1:32:57] eat the whole book if you love god you
[1:32:58] want all of his thoughts amen
[1:33:01] amen if you love god you want to obey
[1:33:02] all of his word
[1:33:13] church go to we'll close with us go to
[1:33:15] first kings 19 it's been a while since
[1:33:17] we read this
[1:33:18] and maybe we haven't read it first kings
[1:33:20] 19.
[1:33:21] and i i ended with this i said brother
[1:33:23] rod i said god can fulfill his scripture
[1:33:26] any way he wants
[1:33:28] let me say i just thought about this
[1:33:29] that brown bear vision
[1:33:31] i don't know i'm just saying this is
[1:33:32] possible somebody else could have shot
[1:33:34] that brown bear years later or months
[1:33:36] later
[1:33:37] and the vision could have been fulfilled
[1:33:39] you know why because god can
[1:33:40] interpret his visions any way he wants
[1:33:43] because this proves it right here first
[1:33:46] kings 19.
[1:33:47] that's not it sorry i don't have it up
[1:33:50] there that's not it either
[1:33:52] first kings 19 15 to 17.
[1:34:03] all right first kings 1915. i need to
[1:34:05] turn there i'm trying to hurry here
[1:34:16] are you saying amen zion is that what
[1:34:17] you're saying back there oh i appreciate
[1:34:19] that
[1:34:20] first kings 19 15-17 now look and the
[1:34:23] lord said unto him
[1:34:24] go return on thy way to the wilderness
[1:34:27] of damascus and when thou comest anoint
[1:34:29] has the other be king over syria you
[1:34:30] remember this scripture
[1:34:32] and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou
[1:34:34] anoint to be king over israel
[1:34:37] and elisha the son of shaphat of abel
[1:34:40] meloha shalt thou anoint to be the
[1:34:43] prophet in thy room
[1:34:44] now church look at that he said thus ate
[1:34:46] the lord you're gonna anoint three
[1:34:47] people
[1:34:48] church he only did one of them he only
[1:34:51] did one of them
[1:34:52] but yet god said you're gonna do it
[1:34:56] so we must catch the revelation that if
[1:34:58] god wasn't going to use elijah he was
[1:35:00] going to use somebody that had the same
[1:35:01] spirit praise god amen because he's a
[1:35:04] part of the body of believers amen
[1:35:06] and they got one life they got one
[1:35:08] spirit go to the next chapter go to
[1:35:10] chapter
[1:35:11] 20. i'll show it to you
[1:35:21] no i'm sorry it's uh go to second kings
[1:35:24] go to second kings eight nine i'm sorry
[1:35:25] second kings eight and nine sorry second
[1:35:27] kings eight and nine it's not the next
[1:35:29] chapter
[1:35:30] eight and nine
[1:35:48] okay now i gotta look it up here real
[1:35:49] quick
[1:35:51] okay there it is now second kings eight
[1:35:53] now look at
[1:35:54] verses
[1:35:59] 13-15 and has yell said what
[1:36:02] but what is thy servant a dog that he
[1:36:05] should do this great thing and elisha
[1:36:06] answered the lord has showed me that
[1:36:08] thou shalt be king over syria
[1:36:10] remember we just read elijah was
[1:36:12] supposed to anoint haziel
[1:36:14] god said thus saith the lord in other
[1:36:15] words you're gonna anoint hazio he
[1:36:17] didn't
[1:36:19] verse 14. so he departed from elisha and
[1:36:21] came to his master who said
[1:36:22] to him what said elisha to thee and he
[1:36:25] said he told me that thou should surely
[1:36:27] recover
[1:36:27] and it came to pass on the moral that he
[1:36:29] took a thick cloth
[1:36:30] and dipped in the water and spread it on
[1:36:32] his face that he died and has yell
[1:36:34] reign in his stead look so this other
[1:36:36] king had to die before
[1:36:38] haziel could be anointed to be king but
[1:36:41] elijah had already gone to heaven
[1:36:43] so who anointed haziel elisha
[1:36:46] but god told elijah you're going to do
[1:36:48] it
[1:36:50] so see in other words i'm saying god can
[1:36:52] interpret his word any way he wants
[1:36:55] because it seems like he kind of changed
[1:36:56] his mind but he did it
[1:37:00] he left him there to show i said leave
[1:37:02] it like this he left him there to hide
[1:37:03] it from the eyes and the wise and
[1:37:05] prudent
[1:37:06] because he was talking about the same
[1:37:07] spirit the same spirit that was on
[1:37:09] elijah
[1:37:09] came on elisha praise god and then
[1:37:12] elisha
[1:37:13] finished what he lied just started and
[1:37:15] anointed hazel right he anointed him
[1:37:17] poured the oil on him next chapter verse
[1:37:20] is our next chapter uh
[1:37:28] second kings nine yeah 1-13
[1:37:32] now this one's even more mysterious and
[1:37:35] elisha the prophet called one of the
[1:37:37] children of the prophets and said him
[1:37:38] gird up thy loins and take this box of
[1:37:40] oil in that hand
[1:37:41] and go to raymond gilead and when thou
[1:37:43] come and stay there look out there jehu
[1:37:45] the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi
[1:37:47] and go in and make him arise up from
[1:37:50] among his brethren and carry him to the
[1:37:51] inner chamber and take the box of oil
[1:37:54] and pour it on his head and say thus
[1:37:55] saith the lord i've anointed thee king
[1:37:57] over israel
[1:37:58] then open the door and flee and tarry
[1:38:00] not look at this
[1:38:02] now elisha's not doing it but another
[1:38:04] son of a prophet is doing it
[1:38:06] god uses two different people to do what
[1:38:09] he said
[1:38:09] elijah was going to do
[1:38:13] well it's thus saith the lord elijah's
[1:38:15] going to do it
[1:38:16] that is not saith the lord but i'm going
[1:38:18] to use a different person with the same
[1:38:20] spirit to do it
[1:38:22] see that so even if let's say brother i
[1:38:24] miss that brown bear i don't know
[1:38:25] someone might have shot it the next week
[1:38:28] what still thus saith the lord then
[1:38:30] i don't know or it might have been he
[1:38:32] missed it like king saul
[1:38:33] he missed out on a blessing because he
[1:38:35] disobeyed
[1:38:36] i don't know which one it was but we can
[1:38:40] see there's conditional
[1:38:41] versus conditional let's say to our feet
[1:38:43] and that was given to me by brother
[1:38:45] loris so
[1:38:46] lord bless you my lord if you listen
[1:38:48] that's a beautiful
[1:38:49] revelation that is so amazing
[1:38:52] church i believe it's there to hide it
[1:38:54] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:38:57] when you look at brother evans ministry
[1:38:59] he sacrificed everything
[1:39:01] to deliver god's word to the people he
[1:39:03] kept his ministry small
[1:39:04] so he could go preach a little house
[1:39:05] services but then also preach to big
[1:39:08] campaigns
[1:39:08] so he wouldn't trust in money he'd trust
[1:39:10] in the living god
[1:39:15] hallelujah that's wonderful that's one
[1:39:21] so next time lord willing
[1:39:24] we'll look at those uh other thoughts
[1:39:25] there you can you can
[1:39:28] move over to the songs here
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:36] so church let's remember that scripture
[1:39:38] the bible said god's ways are past
[1:39:41] finding out
[1:39:44] see there's there's people that might
[1:39:45] have criticized elijah oh see elijah
[1:39:47] wasn't a prophet
[1:39:48] god said that he'd anoint has he owned
[1:39:50] jehu he didn't see
[1:39:51] it was wrong but see you've got to look
[1:39:53] at elijah's message
[1:39:55] right look at elijah's message he called
[1:39:57] fire down from heaven
[1:39:59] right he uh he's a man of the wilderness
[1:40:03] right he did he called fire down from
[1:40:05] heaven he said it won't rain till i call
[1:40:07] for it
[1:40:08] all these he had all these other
[1:40:10] vindications so this one
[1:40:12] god left it there for for those people
[1:40:14] that didn't like the truth
[1:40:16] and they could say see look see he
[1:40:19] failed on it he's no real prophet
[1:40:21] but yet all the other evidence was right
[1:40:25] and god said no elijah did do it it was
[1:40:27] through that same anointing
[1:40:28] the holy spirit
[1:40:32] now that ain't beautiful i don't know
[1:40:33] mercy that that's beautiful
[1:40:36] that's just beautiful musicians if
[1:40:37] you'll come here children
[1:40:40] it's been a while since i brought that
[1:40:42] out but that's what i brought out um
[1:40:44] and church i found on every time i
[1:40:46] brought that up with the brother they
[1:40:47] never could say anything again so they
[1:40:48] just turn to something else
[1:40:50] they said well brother graham did this
[1:40:51] and blah blah blah
[1:40:54] let's go off on something else but every
[1:40:56] time and that's what the brother told me
[1:40:57] even the guy that disagreed with me
[1:40:58] another guy he said even though i don't
[1:41:00] believe the message he said you won the
[1:41:02] debate because he said you
[1:41:03] address each question head on while the
[1:41:06] other side deflected it and tried to get
[1:41:08] you look at something else
[1:41:09] rather than actually answering the
[1:41:10] question
[1:41:13] and church taught you i rejoiced in
[1:41:15] those days when those scriptures came to
[1:41:17] me
[1:41:17] i rejoice because i was nervous did
[1:41:19] brother brandon fail is brother a real
[1:41:20] prophet of god
[1:41:21] and then but you when you look at it
[1:41:23] through the bible of course he was
[1:41:26] and you have to understand is our
[1:41:27] promises scriptural i'm sorry are they
[1:41:29] are they conditional or unconditional
[1:41:32] and then you also have god can interpret
[1:41:33] his word however he wants to
[1:41:36] that's about our heads for word of
[1:41:37] prayer here tonight i know it was a
[1:41:38] little deeper here and
[1:41:39] uh maybe a little more uh mysterious
[1:41:46] but that's the god we serve you know
[1:41:48] church satan has to ratchet up his
[1:41:50] attacks how many know that
[1:41:51] the enemy is going to keep coming in
[1:41:53] like
[1:41:55] it's been battled me beatrice for eight
[1:41:57] years i'm
[1:42:00] but god's spirit raised up a standard
[1:42:03] against
[1:42:06] and now our strength rises up
[1:42:09] we didn't throw away the books and call
[1:42:12] program a lie
