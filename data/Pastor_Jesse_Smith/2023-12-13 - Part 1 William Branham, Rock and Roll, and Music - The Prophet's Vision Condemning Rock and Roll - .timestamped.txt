[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] they were so immorally dressed so filthy
[0:05] looking and they were marching to the
[0:09] time of twist and rock and roll and
[0:11] those women throwing themselves just in
[0:14] twist greetings friends in the matchless
[0:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm Pastor
[0:20] Jesse Smith from bride of Christ
[0:22] Fellowship in akan Ohio USA and I defend
[0:25] the Bible revelations Jesus Christ
[0:28] revealed to his Prophet the late William
[0:30] brandham 1909 to
[0:32] 1965 the purpose of this video series is
[0:35] to Define rock and roll so Holy Ghost
[0:38] filled churches and other sincere
[0:40] churches can know how to keep rock and
[0:42] roll out of their services thus
[0:45] worshiping the Lord Jesus in an
[0:47] acceptable manner in spirit and in truth
[0:50] as Jesus said in John 4:23 and 24 in an
[0:54] all pleasing manner unto our heavenly
[0:56] father here's the outline for the video
[0:58] series which I'll eventually make make
[1:00] into a playlist Lord willing once the
[1:02] series is all done first in this part
[1:05] one we'll look at the prophet's Vision
[1:07] condemning rock and roll in United
[1:10] States
[1:11] churches in the second video we'll look
[1:13] at bible requirements for music and
[1:16] songs third will Define rock and
[1:19] roll fourth will show how brother
[1:21] brandom enjoyed both extremes of music
[1:24] and worship loud and quiet fast and slow
[1:28] emotional and serious
[1:31] fifth we'll look at additional quotes
[1:33] from brother brandham that will be a
[1:34] help regarding music and rock and roll
[1:37] in the sixth video I'll teach a balanced
[1:40] conclusion and then Lord willing I'll
[1:42] make a seventh video with questions and
[1:45] answers about music using the questions
[1:47] that come from the comments or emails
[1:50] from this video
[1:53] series before beginning I want to thank
[1:55] the numerous Saints who helped me with
[1:56] this video series including all the
[1:58] musicians from our church Bri of Christ
[2:00] Fellowship and also a few ministers
[2:02] named brother Ben and brother Alex you
[2:04] know who you are thank you each and
[2:06] everyone thank you for your wisdom dear
[2:09] brothers and
[2:10] sisters so let's look at the prophet's
[2:13] Vision condemning rock and roll in the
[2:15] United States of America
[2:18] churches I want to start with the
[2:20] prophet brother William branham's Vision
[2:22] condemning rock and roll and sadly how
[2:25] it's become a reality in many churches
[2:27] in the United States and of course
[2:29] around the world
[2:30] so this Vision God gave to brother
[2:32] brandham serves as both a condemnation
[2:34] of rock and roll and the churches who
[2:36] love rock and roll and also a warning to
[2:38] any church that might be drawn into it
[2:41] since brother brandham yelled out stay
[2:43] in line as the vision ended there was a
[2:46] group of Believers that were good
[2:48] Believers True Believers going up in the
[2:50] Rapture but as they were going up they
[2:52] were getting out of line getting out of
[2:54] step and brother brandom had to yell out
[2:56] stay in line I played the audio of the
[2:59] vision now from three different sermons
[3:01] and then I'll share three points about
[3:03] it first that the vision is biblical
[3:06] second it's fulfillment and third I'll
[3:09] share a current and brief definition of
[3:12] rock and roll because brother random
[3:13] makes the statement in this Vision quote
[3:18] time of twist and rock and roll end
[3:20] quote so let's listen to this Vision
[3:23] it's from three different sermons and of
[3:24] course there's other sermons that
[3:25] contained it but I use these three first
[3:28] is recognizing your day and its message
[3:30] July
[3:31] 2664 and then we'll look at the choosing
[3:33] of the Bride 1965 April 29th and lastly
[3:36] we look at the Rapture December 4th 1965
[3:39] let's listen to the three
[3:41] quotes and remember the
[3:44] vision of last week that one the bride
[3:48] came to be a preview of it there came up
[3:53] the little bride lovely in the
[3:56] vision and I not thinking about it just
[4:00] sitting there watching
[4:03] outside and there come the bride I Heard
[4:06] a Voice with the side of me said here is
[4:09] a preview of the bride and she came by I
[4:13] noticed her the way she was very lovely
[4:17] pretty young she's walking just as step
[4:21] as she could not a March just in the
[4:24] stride of a a woman how they walk
[4:27] gracefully lady like
[4:30] that's the way she was walking coming to
[4:32] my left on this side and she went out of
[4:36] my sight then he turned me to the right
[4:39] side and he showed me each
[4:42] church as they come up out of the ages
[4:47] and oh how vulgar and the last one was
[4:52] this last day Church age which was led
[4:55] by a
[4:56] witch and they were so immortal ly
[4:59] dressed so filthy looking and they were
[5:03] marching to the time of twist and rock
[5:05] and roll and those women throwing
[5:08] themselves just in twist withh holding
[5:10] just paper gray hypocritical the word
[5:14] the gray is between a white and a black
[5:17] which is a deceiving color gray is
[5:20] neither white nor black it's a deceiving
[5:23] color and gray looking paper holding in
[5:25] front of them with lace like hola skirts
[5:29] holding in front of them and completely
[5:31] nuded from their waist up and was
[5:34] marching to the a time or twisting and
[5:37] carrying on with that music walking up
[5:39] and said that is the
[5:43] church and when it passed by me my heart
[5:45] like to fainted I thought if that's what
[5:49] is trying to be presented to Christ as a
[5:52] bride of all the efforts and things that
[5:55] man has put forth to try to bring forth
[5:57] a bride for Christ and a bulg dirty
[6:00] filthy looking prostitute like that to
[6:02] be the bride of
[6:04] Christ it made me sick at my heart and
[6:08] as she passed after she coming before
[6:11] where we were standing she was holding
[6:12] the paper in front of her twisting and
[6:15] rocking and moving herself one side and
[6:17] then the other side as she went like the
[6:19] modern dances they have of this day
[6:23] using herself in an immoral act as she
[6:26] was marching on I not responsible for
[6:29] these things I can only say what I seen
[6:32] and God is my
[6:34] judge but that was the church from
[6:38] USA now as she passed by the whole back
[6:42] part had no covering at
[6:45] all and then as she passed by I felt
[6:47] faint and sickly then he said the bride
[6:50] will come into preview again and here
[6:53] the bride came behind her the very same
[6:57] looking bride that passed at the
[7:00] beginning then my heart jumped for joy
[7:02] to know that there will be a bride and
[7:06] she'll be made of the same thing clothed
[7:08] in the same thing that the one was at
[7:10] the
[7:13] beginning she is to be called and I know
[7:17] that is the truth yes if that isn't true
[7:21] then every Vision that I've had in the
[7:23] back has been wrong
[7:25] amen and anyone knows that not one thing
[7:28] has ever told us but what was the truth
[7:31] it come to pass just and can you see
[7:34] then the
[7:35] filthiness of the modern
[7:39] Church calling herself a church
[7:42] is and just as they started to going
[7:45] right up into the skies this other one
[7:47] went up to a break of a hill and went
[7:49] down like that these started marching
[7:52] right up into the skies and when they
[7:54] went to marching I noticed a couple of
[7:56] little girls in the back look like they
[7:58] might be of some forign girl like Sweden
[8:01] or Switzerland or somewhere they started
[8:03] to look around and got I said don't do
[8:05] that don't get out of that step and
[8:08] there a scream like that I come to in
[8:10] the vision stand there with my hand out
[8:11] like
[8:14] that I thought
[8:16] well then I heard something like an
[8:19] Onward Christian Soldiers I look and
[8:21] here come that sainted bunch of little
[8:23] girls just exactly the way they was all
[8:25] correctly dressed their hair hanging way
[8:27] down in their back smooth clean marching
[8:30] like this to the step of the Gospel she
[8:33] was the word it looked like one out of
[8:36] every nation I was looking at as they
[8:37] passed by and seen them pass by instead
[8:40] of going down they started going up I
[8:42] noticed one of them trying two or three
[8:44] of them trying to get in out line I
[8:44] scream stay in line and the vision left
[8:48] me and I was standing in his room
[8:48] screaming stay in
[8:50] line now that we've heard the vision
[8:52] here's Point number one this Vision God
[8:55] gave to brother brandham is biblical cuz
[8:57] we must take everything back to the word
[8:58] of God
[8:59] the Bible example that relates to this
[9:02] vision is of course Israel singing and
[9:05] dancing when they set up the golden calf
[9:08] in Exodus 32 this simple chart shows the
[9:12] similarities on the left you have the
[9:14] 1964 Vision on the right you have Exodus
[9:17] 32 so the first thing in the vision we
[9:20] saw was singing they also had singing
[9:22] there in Exodus
[9:24] 3218 next there was dancing or twisting
[9:27] in the vision of course there was
[9:29] dancing in Exodus
[9:31] 32:19 third there was nakedness and a
[9:34] seductive element to their appearance as
[9:37] we saw in the 1964 65 Vision the Bible
[9:40] also said and of course this was the
[9:42] same in Exodus 32 the Bible said the
[9:45] Israelis rose up to play which means
[9:47] flirting so there's sexual immorality
[9:50] going on that's in Exodus 3218 to 19 and
[9:53] exodus
[9:55] 32:25 this word playing means flirting
[9:57] according to Genesis 26
[10:00] 6:8 and fourth and finally there was
[10:02] witchcraft brother Bram said the church
[10:04] was led by a witch in the 1964 65 vision
[10:09] and of course there was idolatry in
[10:11] Exodus
[10:12] 32:4 so we see strong demon powers in
[10:15] both the vision and exodus
[10:17] 32 point number two is the Fulfillment
[10:20] of this Vision history is very clear
[10:23] showing that around the years 2000 to
[10:25] 2010 rock and roll started taking over
[10:28] some of the most popular churches in the
[10:30] United States it's undeniable now you
[10:32] can go on any Mega Church's website or
[10:35] YouTube channel such as Hill song or
[10:37] Joel Olstein or Steven ferdi church and
[10:40] you'll hear them play rock and roll
[10:41] every single service one thing that's
[10:44] interesting too I've shared with some
[10:45] people is that my mother was born in
[10:48] 1950 so my mother's 73 now here in
[10:51] 2023 and I told her about this vision
[10:53] from brother brandham now my mother is
[10:55] not a follower of this message we're
[10:57] praying she accepts it but anyway way
[10:59] she was raised in Assembly of God
[11:00] denomination and still attends the same
[11:03] denomination and I told her what brother
[11:05] Brandon prophesied in 1965 and my mom
[11:08] said there's no way she would have ever
[11:10] imagined rock and roll would have come
[11:11] into her Assembly of God Church but she
[11:14] said around 200000 to 2015 she would
[11:17] attend the Assemblies of God youth
[11:19] conventions and every year they
[11:21] Incorporated more and more worldly music
[11:23] they started with rock and roll then
[11:24] went to hip hop and then rap and she
[11:27] said now it's a free-for-all
[11:29] the rock and roll hip hop and rap is
[11:31] just played constantly at the youth
[11:32] conventions and she doesn't like hearing
[11:34] it there so it just struck me and I told
[11:36] this to my mom I said wow Mom you have
[11:38] seen brother Ram's Vision fulfilled in
[11:40] your
[11:41] denomination so it's clear by both
[11:43] history and current websites and also
[11:46] personal experience the vision is
[11:48] fulfilled many American churches sing
[11:51] and dance to rock and roll and have a
[11:53] lot of
[11:54] immorality such as the vision showed
[11:56] women with bobbed hair sexy dressed
[11:58] women
[11:59] barely wear any clothes and very few
[12:02] standards for
[12:03] Holiness Point number three is my
[12:06] current working and brief definition of
[12:09] rock and roll in order to understand
[12:11] what brother Brandon meant by that
[12:12] statement quote time of twist and rock
[12:15] and roll so with this point I want to
[12:17] try to understand what did Brother
[12:18] Brandon mean by time of twist in rock
[12:20] and roll I have three observations about
[12:23] that statement first brother brand never
[12:25] told us the time of rock and roll
[12:28] although some have Tri tried to add to
[12:29] that quote and give a specific time for
[12:33] example some have said a 44 time is rock
[12:36] and roll and of course that's not true
[12:38] there's a lot of good Christian songs
[12:40] that have a 44 time so I asked a
[12:43] musician I said Is there a time for rock
[12:45] and roll another word for time is tempo
[12:48] is there a time or tempo for rock and
[12:50] roll and the Christian musicians I
[12:52] talked with said no Tempo is the largest
[12:56] aspect of beat in music when you listen
[12:59] to a song Tempo is a number of beats in
[13:01] a measure this basically means you can
[13:03] count to four before the measure resets
[13:06] it seems 44 is the most common time
[13:09] signature in Christian
[13:12] music and so it's clear Tempo or time
[13:15] has nothing to do with good or bad music
[13:18] so when brother random mentioned time
[13:20] for rock and roll it's most likely
[13:21] brother Randa meant the heavily accented
[13:24] beat of rock and roll as the definition
[13:27] of rock and roll says from the Webster's
[13:30] Dictionary it says quote persistent
[13:33] heavily accented beat end
[13:36] quote so having a beat is not evil
[13:40] because brother Brandon first danced in
[13:42] the Holy Ghost by tapping his foot along
[13:44] with the beat of the song the meeting in
[13:46] the air so before listening to this
[13:48] quote remember brother brandham said
[13:50] this sister was playing the piano so
[13:52] fast he said I believe if there had been
[13:56] three or four decks of key she could
[13:57] have played them so imagine how fast
[14:00] this sister was playing on the piano
[14:02] when brother Brandon was dancing in the
[14:04] spirit obviously it's fast and so I had
[14:06] a fast beat and so he was tapping his
[14:08] foot to the fast beat let's listen to
[14:10] the quote I noticed is then after while
[14:15] there's a little girl jumped out on the
[14:16] floor there and started dancing up and
[14:18] down jumping around I thought oh all
[14:20] right my own chirch here it
[14:23] is now I sure get I'm rooted for this so
[14:28] I kept watching her and you know I kept
[14:30] hearing that this get real that lady
[14:32] playing on that panish I Believe there'
[14:33] been three or four decks of key she
[14:34] could have played them just playing the
[14:37] god blown son will be the leading one at
[14:39] the meeting in the air and she no more
[14:40] get halfway out of that you should be
[14:42] started
[14:43] again she's got real white in her face
[14:46] and she's her eyes Clos and playing like
[14:48] that hey I got to feel pretty good got
[14:50] Pat my foot with that girl W well you
[14:54] know I thought well maybe that's just my
[14:56] method is put anyhow so I started
[14:59] patting the H
[15:00] you you know wasn't very long that I was
[15:04] out there with that girl
[15:11] D I got the
[15:13] [Music]
[15:15] victory a second observation is that
[15:17] brother brandom condemned modern dances
[15:19] in this quote it was in paragraph 43 but
[15:22] we also have to remember brother Ram
[15:23] said dancing in the spirit was Victory
[15:26] and he also said modern rhythms were
[15:28] were all right in another 1957 quote so
[15:31] we have to be balanced with this subject
[15:34] so not all dancing is sinful and not all
[15:36] modern rhythms are sinful here's the
[15:39] quote where brother random says dancing
[15:41] is Victory let's listen to the quote
[15:42] from
[15:44] 1954 here com his daughter and the and
[15:47] the daughter rejoicing
[15:50] dancing and uh I noticed how dancing was
[15:54] Victory and I thought well maybe I just
[15:57] haven't got Victory now
[15:59] yeah maybe just a little bit of self has
[16:02] to die out
[16:03] yeah analysis in the quote from 1957
[16:06] brother Ram says the modern Rhythm the
[16:09] whoop it up on a piano to a lot of this
[16:11] here dancing in the spirit them things
[16:12] are all right so again there is Holy
[16:15] Ghost dancing and modern rhythms can be
[16:18] all right according to brother brandham
[16:20] let's listen to the quote because you
[16:22] can dance in the spirit all of this
[16:24] modern Rhythm Hoop It Up on a piano a
[16:27] lot of this your dancing in the spirit
[16:30] and things are all right but they tuck
[16:32] the whole thing over on that legal
[16:34] side see and therefore they left the
[16:37] spirit of God in the back so all these
[16:40] quotes from Brother random have brought
[16:41] me to the following definition of rock
[16:43] and roll it's a working definition and I
[16:46] start with Webster's Dictionary it says
[16:48] quote popular music usually played on
[16:50] electronically Amplified instruments and
[16:53] characterized by a persistent heavily
[16:55] aced beat repetition of simple phrases
[16:58] and often country folk and blues
[17:00] elements end
[17:01] quote so I start with that Webster's
[17:03] Dictionary quote and then I created this
[17:06] further definition to clarify rock and
[17:09] roll is excessive drums because drums
[17:14] are what create the beat and brother
[17:15] random said it was the time of rock and
[17:17] roll or he meant the beat or tempo of
[17:19] rock and roll now notice it's excessive
[17:22] drums not all drums because brother
[17:24] brandom did support some drums and so
[17:26] does the Bible because the Bible speaks
[17:28] of percussion instruments like
[17:31] tambourines here's two quotes where
[17:33] brother random supported drums the first
[17:34] is God's provided way 1953 he was
[17:37] talking about Elisha getting in the
[17:40] spirit bringing the spirit down by the
[17:42] minstral playing let's listen to the
[17:44] quote so they got to playing the music
[17:46] the tambri now listen if you can't be
[17:48] the prophet you can be one of the
[17:49] instruments you plays the music to bring
[17:51] the spirit down on the prophet you know
[17:53] what I mean so they begin to play the
[17:55] tambourine and so forth and beat the
[17:57] drums and play the instruments and all
[17:59] them began to beat and play and had a
[18:00] great big old song Maybe playing going
[18:02] to be a meeting in the air and a sweet
[18:04] sweet B by God's own son will be the
[18:07] leading one at the meeting in the air
[18:08] the prophet begin to get into the spirit
[18:10] now the first thing you know when he got
[18:12] in the spirit things begin to happen
[18:14] here's a second quote brother Ram
[18:16] supported drums he talked about Holy
[18:18] Ghost filled Saints would be better off
[18:20] in an alley with a guitar beating a drum
[18:23] let's listen to the quote what we need
[18:25] today is a prophet arise on the scene
[18:28] with thus sayith the Lord and strip
[18:30] those Saints to the bottom and say that
[18:32] they become a stin our denominations
[18:35] have grown and our churches are big and
[18:37] they're uh finer than they ever was we'd
[18:40] be a lot better off with a tin pan
[18:42] standing on the Alley again with a
[18:44] guitar out there beating the drum or
[18:46] something other with a real Pentecostal
[18:48] fire burning in our souls and the set
[18:50] the great pews that we're sitting in
[18:51] today
[18:53] dying the world dying under our feet yes
[18:57] sir so the next part of the working
[18:59] definition along with excessive drums is
[19:01] excessive bass and electric guitar but
[19:04] again not all bass and electric guitar
[19:07] playing is sinful it's just excessive
[19:10] bass and electric
[19:12] guitar the second element goes along
[19:14] with a third excessive volume because
[19:16] remember the Webster's Dictionary said
[19:18] it's electronically Amplified
[19:21] instruments so rock and roll has
[19:23] excessive drums excessive bass and
[19:25] electric guitar it has excessive volume
[19:27] or the volume overtakes the voices
[19:30] sending worship to the Lord Jesus
[19:33] Christ fourth rock and roll has
[19:35] excessive
[19:36] Distortion and in part three I'll share
[19:39] examples of all these sinful elements of
[19:41] rock and roll The Fifth Element of rock
[19:44] and roll is excessive
[19:46] improvisation and this includes adding
[19:48] the Boogie style which again I'll go
[19:51] over in part three of this
[19:52] series and the final part of rock and
[19:55] roll is a sensual
[19:56] voice so this means means the voice is
[19:59] singing based upon lust and not worship
[20:02] to the Lord Jesus
[20:05] Christ in closing friends I hope part
[20:08] one of this music Series has been a
[20:10] blessing and a help again my purpose is
[20:12] to help Believers around the world and
[20:14] especially in the United States of
[20:16] America to know how to condemn rock and
[20:18] roll music no Holy Ghost filled Saints
[20:21] will be deceived into worshiping with
[20:23] rock and roll so our desire is to keep
[20:26] the bride from rock and roll R help the
[20:29] bride Define rock and roll in order to
[20:31] be that pure bride who stays in step
[20:33] with the word of God all the way into
[20:35] the Rapture and friends as you can see
[20:37] we've got to be balanced with the
[20:39] scriptures and the quotes from God's
[20:41] Prophet brother William brandham I
[20:43] believe some Churches have gone into
[20:44] legalism on this subject and also some
[20:47] Churches have gone into lasciviousness
[20:49] or lawlessness on this subject because
[20:51] they do not consider all the scriptures
[20:53] and all the quotes from Brother brandham
[20:55] on this subject friends I'm not saying I
[20:57] know everything about this subject but
[20:59] after numerous years of study I believe
[21:01] this will be a balanced rightly divided
[21:03] teaching series on music by the help of
[21:05] the Holy Ghost and friends we're looking
[21:07] forward to part two of this series seven
