TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Oh [Music] Revelation chapter 1 the themes are the supreme deity of Jesus Christ and the Sevenfold glory of Christ on the Lord's Day the supreme deity of Jesus Christ is seen through his own words and the words John uses to describe him Alpha Omega the beginning in the end the Almighty the first in the last and the one with the keys of hell and of death Jesus is not a second person in the Godhead for the Bible never teaches that false doctrine Jesus is supreme deity the Express image or exact reproduction of the one person of God thus the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ is the greatest of all revelations for a person cannot be justified or declared righteous and forgiven of their sins in the sight of God without first repenting and being buried in water and calling upon the name of God the Lord Jesus Christ according to acts 2 verse 38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the Sevenfold glory of Jesus Christ is seen in verses 12 through 16 as John gives us a physical description of the appearance of Christ when he physically returns to judge the world at the end of the Tribulation Period first his head in his hairs were white like wool as white as snow this means Christ is the one universal judge of all men who is crowned with experience maturity and wisdom has also seen in the final judgment the great white throne judgment of Daniel 7 verses 9 to 14 and revelation 20 verses 11 through 15 second his eyes was a flame of fire this means Christ is now an angry judge seeing and rebuking the hard hearts according to isaiah 66:15 and first Peter 3 verse 12 third his feet like unto fine brass as if burned in a furnace this means Christ will carry out the divine wrath of Almighty God and crush all of his enemies for he himself took upon himself the wrath of God on the cross of Calvary as brass represents the divine judgment of God upon an innocent sacrifice a corner numbers 21 9 and second King 16 verses 14 and 15 forth his voice as the sound of many waters this means Christ's voice in judgment will include a multitude of voices and witnesses of all the true believers who will be witnesses against all the unbelievers who did not take warning from Christians who witnessed to them fifth the seven stars in his right hand this means the seven stars who were called seven angels were human messengers or preachers that would be safe in the hand of Christ and also have lives that were full of the power of God with signs wonders and miracles sixth a sharp two-edged sword out of his mouth this means the words Christ speaks will discern the thoughts and intents of every heart revealing every seeker of every heart while issuing judge it's upon those who did not do the will of God seventh his countenance as the Sun shineth in its strength this means the countenance face or presence of Christ will shine with divine righteousness as a holy light and will damned those who had pleasure in unrighteousness and believed lies the timing of events in this chapter deal with only one event the Lord's Day mentioned in verses 7 and 10 but Lord's Day is the future day when Jesus physically returns to the earth when the days of men ruling the world are over and when the judgments of God begin to fall during the tribulation period the Lord's Day is when mercy is over and every eye of every sinful guilty soul will wail in fear of Jesus Christ Israel will also see Christ their Messiah return in mercy to the 144,000 believing Jews the symbols and key revelations include the seven stars the seven candlesticks kings and priests and the phrase the testimony of Jesus Christ and the Word of God Jesus defines the stars and candlesticks himself telling us that the stars are the seven angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks represent the seven churches these seven angels are actually human messengers that lived upon the earth and shine the light of Christ to their age the seven candlesticks are the seven churches of the seven Gentile cities listed in chapters 2 & 3 showing that each person in each age must burn brightly with the light of the Holy Ghost during their time on earth the fact that none of these seven churches are Jewish churches and all seven are Gentile cities proves that Jesus's words spoken to the seven churches in chapters 2 and 3 are prophetic and foretell what would happen during the Gentile dispensation as Jesus taught in Luke 21 verse 24 scripture teaches that God blinded the eyes of the Jews from seeing Christ as their Messiah in Romans 11:25 in order that God might call out a people for his name meaning Christ would call himself a Gentile group of believers to be his bride or wife kings and priests are the current dual offices of every Holy Ghost field Christian every Christian is a spiritual king who reigns in this life by the power of God over sin the flesh the world and the devil every Christian is also a spiritual priest offering the continual sacrifices of praises and thanksgiving from their lips along with faithful intercessory prayers for all men the phrase the testimony of Jesus Christ refers to New Testament believers who recognize Christ as the promised Messiah and Savior the phrase the word of God represents those who believe in the infallibility of the Old Testament notice that John had both the testimony of Jesus Christ and believe the Old Testament or the Word of God these phrases will be important to remember in chapter 6 in 12 if you like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
