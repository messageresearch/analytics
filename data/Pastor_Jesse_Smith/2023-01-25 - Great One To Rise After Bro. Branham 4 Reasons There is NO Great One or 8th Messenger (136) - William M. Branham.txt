TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] when I have been under anticipation and believe that some great one was coming someday or maybe a great prophet that a speak will come of the Elijah greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ was there a great one to come after brother Brandon's ministry as brother Branham said in 1962 I believe the answer is no for at least four reasons recently a viewer emailed me this question and I wanted to make a short quick video with a solid answer by the grace of God let's begin by looking at three quotes where brother Brandon mentions a great one to come after him and also the idea that he was laying a foundation for someone to follow him so the first quote is from taking sides with Jesus in 1962. this is the quote where brother Branham calls this person a great one and said this one would have the spirit of Elisha which I think brother Brandon meant Spirit of Elijah but let's listen to the quote well if I thought that there was a denomination or any other group of Believers that had anything better than we had here brethren how would I want to emerge this little body with it right quick I've waited I have longed I have been under anticipation and believed that some great one was coming someday or maybe a great prophet that a speak will come of the Elijah I've always believed and thought maybe that maybe I've lived to see the day that when I could change when I'd see that person rise on the scene then I could take my little church and say rather this is the man we have looked for this man he is the one I've waited for that a second quote is from a sermon from December 1963 Look Away to Jesus brother Bram said if he's laying a foundation for another to stand upon let's listen to the quote if I'm laying a foundation that another stand upon Grant Lord that soon it'll happen that the word might be fulfilled our harsh desire is to see your word fulfilled the third quote is from the laodicean church age sermon from December 11 1960 in this quote brother random speaks of a man coming with the spirit of Elijah at the end of the laodicean church age and he calls this man Anointed with the spirit of Elijah the great one that's to come and in this quote brother random says this Elijah anointed man will fulfill Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. turning the hearts of the children back to the father's message or the day of Pentecost message let's listen to the quote Elijah Elijah after he had give his prophecy Elijah did not have to die he was translated and was taken up into heaven a type of a church at the end of this Elijah that will come at the end of his time the church will go in the Rapture without going through the shadows of death it'll be the Rapture I believe the great Elijah the great the one that succumbed will be the anointed Elijah that's prophesied for the last days amen I think he will be when he comes the angel or the messenger to the church in the last days are rejected degraded people as this church will get into and is already it I think Elijah is Promised in the Bible I think we can understand that that Elijah was the one that was promised in the Bible to come in this state do you believe that we'll be looking for that great wander around us you might come in my day he might come in the younger days I don't know he might be right Among Us now we can't tell the holy spirit is here to lead us to that time now when this leader will take his order he'll still be anointed of the Holy Ghost that will come but he will be a the leader that will turn the hearts of the children or the hearts of the children back to the father's message back to our Heavenly father's message on the day of Pentecost one report I dispute which that little line of Rises the coaches the Good by the history Bible and show that that thing has come right down through the church ages and that's it today also friends here's a fourth quote I found When I Was preparing this video where brother Brandon said he believed a man somebody would come after him and it was from questions and answers 1961. and I love this quote because brother Brandon makes the preachers of this message messengers of the same message and what I love about this quote is that it points us to Ephesians chapter 4 verses 8 through 16 and the importance of all five preaching gifts and Paul said with us saith the scripture that the entire fivefold Ministry would bring the bride to a Unity of the faith and we know that has to be done before the Rapture of the Gentile Church let's listen to the quote I know there's something happening in my life and that's not that's beyond any question my brother thank you but let me say this that there will come terrible from admit and there will come an edge I believe that if it's to be a man it'll be somebody after me see It'll be uh but this message that I'm preaching uh is the true message of this day and it's the last message you see what I'm doing brother I'm putting you all the same place I am of course you're just as much into it as I am you are messengers of this same message it's upon these three quotes some people believe a great one was supposed to rise after brother Ram's Ministry of course I don't believe that I believe brother Branham was this servant of God who was anointed with the spirit of Elijah this prophet of God this seventh angel to the laodicean church age this Elijah anointed prophet of Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. so here's the Four Points I want to make that are the reasons I believe brother Branham was that great one he mentioned or that servant of God and that there is no great one to rise after brother Branham Point number one I believe brother Brandon was just being humble in these quotes saying he looked for another and the proof of this is that there are multiple quotes where brother Bram didn't even claim to be a prophet and then there are other quotes where he did claim to be a prophet I believe brother Branham was just speaking in humility or perhaps in a human mistake when he said he was looking for a great one to come after him of course as any honest person knows not every word on brother Ram's tapes was thus saith the Lord as Jeffersonville falsely claims today brother Brandon said there's mix up on the tapes and I have numerous videos about this he said he made mistakes on tapes all the time but they were just human mistakes he was still a genuine prophet of God friends there are nine times brother Branham says quote I'm no Prophet end quote and you can look those up in your free time but let's look at a few quotes here in 1962 taking sides with Jesus brother random said quote I do not regard myself to be a prophet of the Lord I I haven't that honor end quote and then brother random explained why he didn't call himself a prophet and basically said his ministry didn't match the same style or isolation Ministry of Old Testament prophets but of course we know our other brand learned later and standing in the Gap sermon 1963 he couldn't think of himself as an Old Testament Prophet because he was a new testament prophet he could not be isolated out in the wilderness he had to be with the people as Paul commanded in Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and 25 that the Saints must gather more together as they see that day approaching but let's listen to the quote from taking sides with Jesus I cannot go on the way I've been going because I'm the people has believed me I I have to say this I said before man the people many times regard me as being a prophet uh do not regard myself that no sir I do not I have I don't say that to be humble I say I have to be truthful I do not regard myself to be a prophet of the Lord I I haven't that honor if he did call me to be his prophet then I'm certainly not holding the office of one prophets don't Evangeline a prophet hides himself in the wilderness alone with God until he gets exactly directly what God wants him doing his talks right out he gives his message and back into the Wilderness he goes again he's not an advantage holding meetings and getting cooperations and all these things like advances do you don't teach sack of answers yes the day of the Lord and that's it and that's all Jesus pours it out and let the chips fall work willing that way he goes again nobody knows where he's at he's in isolation somewhere a prophet stays back here until he Stomps not into the hospital wherever he's going with thus saith the Lord and saving no advances no you don't hold meetings and this he's got the world of art for whoever he sent him so I see brother that's reason I don't call myself a prophet I'm not even in the office of one okay that's how you understand what I mean notice brother Brandon said a prophet doesn't hold meetings and discuss things but friends if you look in the scripture in Acts chapter 15 The First Church age messenger the prophet of God Saint Paul held a meeting in Jerusalem with James and Peter and all the apostles to answer the question about the Holy Ghost going to the Gentiles so we know the scripture is always right and so in this case brother Branham had not considered Acts chapter 15 and so here we see The Human Side of brother Branham proving that not every quote on tape from Brother Branham is thus saith the Lord because thus saith the scripture Acts chapter 15 shows a prophet holding meetings and discussing things with the brethren here's another quote from the spoken word is Original Seed brother Ram said quote I don't call myself a prophet I'm no Prophet but you said so end quote let's listen to the quote the Bible say the word of the Lord came to the prophets I don't call myself a prophet I'm no Prophet but you said so I'm saying what you said also here's a quote from 1964 questions and answers part two brother Brandon said quote I don't claim to be his Prophet many times I've said it when I didn't think I said it catch myself on the tape end quote so here brother random plainly distinguishes between his human side and the gifted prophetic side of his life when he was under the anointing of the Holy Ghost using his gift of discernment and the prophetic gift he would call himself a prophet but when he was not under that anointing he said I don't call myself a prophet let's listen to the quote so I am not the the anointed son of man I don't claim to be his Prophet many times I've said it when I didn't think I said it gets myself on the tape and before moving on to point two I just want to play this quote from questions and answers 1961 again showing brother random's Humanity in this quote brother Branham said quote I'm going to be as honest as I can be I don't think I'd have anything to do with that messenger end quote and of course he was talking about the seventh Church age messenger now friends if this doesn't prove not every word on tape is thus say the Lord nothing will because in the quote brother Branham said he had nothing to do with the seventh Church age messenger but then all of the scriptures and other quotes from brother Brandon prove he was the seven Church age messenger so this is a quote the leadership at Jeffersonville will likely ignore and I've asked him about this quote and they won't respond to it because if they say every word is thus say the Lord for brother Branham then it would be thus say the Lord Brother Branham could not be the seventh Church age messenger so of course they'll never answer this question or at least never answer it directly or sincerely let's listen to the quote now if you'll notice and our little witty out there put my name on that star out there and that's the reason I passed it over you see because I I don't think I'm gonna be honest as I can be I don't think I'd have anything to do with that messenger see that's right I believe it um maybe be sent for a part of this church to help build that message up to a place to work wood on this Forerunner for comes that he will come but I believe me being what I am I am uh uh I believe but I have the message of the day I believe that this is the light of the day and I believe it's important to that time coming you see also I found another quote regarding this topic as I Was preparing this video it's from the token message 1964. and brother Branham said that he was not the messenger and that Jesus Christ is the messenger so we have at least two quotes where brother Brown was so humble and said he had nothing to do with the seventh Church AIDS messenger and directly said he is not the messenger and again I believe brother random was the seven Church age messenger but here in these quotes we see how humble he was trying not to draw attention to himself or magnify himself let's listen to the quote that same Jesus Christ is here he is the messenger he is here is the message and he is the matter to identify her he is the messenger and this is the message and if you've got a spirit that disagrees with that how can it be the messenger of the message only the token will identify so now that we can see brother Ram's human side and his humility let's move on to point two brother Brown said young men not one man would preach the coming of the Lord and things that are to be 1965 just weeks before he passed away brother Branham said quote young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord end quote let's listen to the quote but I am very thankful for these open doors that have had to go into and The Inspirations gives a young man like your pastor here that's calls them as I'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and Noah man can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come and my generation which I'm hoping to see I'll look daily for him watch keeping myself prepared for that hour notice brother Graham said not one great one or not one great prophet only would sweep the message on to the coming of the Lord he said a group of young men would in other words more than one man so we see how right before brother Graham's death he never emphasized a great one to come he was emphasizing the five-fold ministry as also Ephesians chapter 4 verses 8 through 16 emphasizes and proves with thus say the scripture that a group of men have to preach the message of the hour and they will sweep it on to the coming of the Lord or the Rapture of the New Testament Church it's also notable that in birth pains 1965 brother Braham said men could take his message and quote make more sense to it to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay this seed then hope they can make it come to life end quote let's listen to the quote so these two quotes show brother random said young men or a group of men would preach the coming of the Lord and of course these quotes line up with Ephesians chapter 4 verses 8-16 and there is nothing in Ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16 about a great one rising up like many falsely claimed today it will be the Holy Ghost filled New Testament Church that will rise up and they'll be led by the preaching of the fivefold ministry according to Saint Paul and Paul said to change one word of his gospel would make that person accursed Point number three brother random said with thus saith the Lord the Elijah anointed prophet of Malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 was already on the earth in July of 1965. so this quote takes precedent over the 1962 taking sides with Jesus quote about the great one to come so this third proof was spoken with thus saith the Lord from Brother Branham that Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 would be a restoration Prophet Anointed with the spirit of Elijah and this Prophet was already on the earth in July of 1965. so brother Brown was not referring to Joseph Branham or any other man because there were no newspapers written about Joseph Branham and his ministry in July of 1965 notice in brother Ram's quote as we'll hear in a moment he said there was an Elijah anointed Ministry on the earth already in July of 1965 that had newspaper articles written about the signs wonders of Miracles done through that Ministry so this thus saith the Lord's statement had to refer to brother Branham as being the prophet Anointed with the spirit of Elijah who would fulfill Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. let's listen to the quote the Bible says and he promised in the last days he would say people the children of God were to confirm the son of man in the United States the same as it was the start of yesterday today and forever yeah but he promised to do it and it's God's prepare the Lord notice they did the same same thing the motor did until God got enough of us I remember against the saith the Lord it'll come to pass in this day take every Clan take every man take every Church you had Christ's name to do this you preachers the newspapers are take consideration anywhere you want to go and see if it isn't on the Earth right now fourth and finally Point number four brother random said thus saith the Lord his ministry was the last sign to the Gentiles so again I believe this thus say the Lord's statement takes precedent over the 1962 quote from taking sides with Jesus about a great one to come in fact here's four quotes with us say the Lord that brother Adam's Ministry was the last sign to the Gentile Church before the rapture so we know with thus say the Lord nothing is going to rise after brother Adam's Ministry that was greater than his own Ministry it's thus saith the Lord the church age will never see any greater sign than brother Ram's gift of discernment his prophetic gift let's listen to the quotes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] said the word of God saith the holy spirit that speaks that knows the secret of the heart the save the Lord you are repeating your last call foreign [Music] [Applause] this is your last song write it in your Bible if something Rises besides this and greater than this call me a false prophet is right you're among you you'll just remember it just Faith the Lord you will never in any or more Gentile Church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last time to the church [Applause] gonna respond [Music] [Applause] ing to things like this [Applause] in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing to you and I hope it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was no great one to come after brother Branham friends were not looking for an eighth messenger we're not even looking for another seven Church age messenger we are looking according to the Bible unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith and as we look to Jesus the Bible says we're transformed from Glory unto Glory we're spiritually transformed in our hearts and lives in our minds in our character our souls are baptized with the Holy Ghost and so our lives line up with the word of God they line up with Ephesians chapter 4 verses 8-16 how the fivefold ministry will bring us to a Unity of the faith and of course we believe this is done through the preaching of the Holy Ghost through the five-pole ministry preaching the revelations that God revealed to his Prophet brother William Branham so I want to thank Brother Tyrone for this question and I hope this answer was sufficient by the grace of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
