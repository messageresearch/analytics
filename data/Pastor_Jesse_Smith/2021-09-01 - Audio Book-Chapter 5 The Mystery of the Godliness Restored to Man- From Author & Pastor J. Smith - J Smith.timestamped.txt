[0:00] chapter 5 the mystery of godliness
[0:03] restored to man
[0:04] mystery 5 of 12
[0:07] chapter 5 contains footnotes numbers
[0:10] 553-803
[0:14] and without controversy great is the
[0:16] mystery of godliness
[0:18] god was manifest in the flesh
[0:20] justified in the spirit
[0:22] seen of angels
[0:23] preached unto the gentiles believed on
[0:26] in the world received up into glory
[0:29] first timothy 3
[0:31] 16.
[0:33] godliness is a precious mysterious yet
[0:37] obtainable level of christian character
[0:40] that few worshipers reach
[0:42] like paul you are one of the true
[0:44] worshipers seeking to press toward the
[0:45] mark for the prize of the high calling
[0:48] of god in christ jesus
[0:51] in the greek
[0:52] godliness means reverence
[0:55] respect piety towards god other words
[0:58] that help explain its meaning are loyal
[1:01] faithful devoted and dutiful
[1:04] you can also say godliness is being like
[1:06] god
[1:07] what a glorious invitation god is
[1:10] offering you a chance to be like him
[1:12] you might be thinking i can't be like
[1:14] god
[1:15] but be encouraged for jesus says you can
[1:18] our lord says be therefore perfect even
[1:21] as your father which is in heaven is
[1:23] perfect
[1:24] godliness is a state of loyalty all true
[1:27] christians desire based upon jesus's
[1:30] invitation
[1:31] if jesus asks us to be perfect or
[1:34] complete he has to make a way for us to
[1:36] achieve that condition
[1:38] he has and this chapter reveals christ's
[1:40] process to our godliness
[1:44] in the epigraph above paul declares the
[1:47] mystery of godliness in context of
[1:50] jesus's life
[1:51] god was manifest in the flesh justified
[1:53] in the spirit scene of angels preached
[1:56] unto the gentiles believed on in the
[1:57] world and received up into glory
[2:00] in other words jesus's earthly life
[2:02] manifested true godliness as the epitome
[2:05] of godliness
[2:07] in stark contrast is satan the epitome
[2:10] of iniquity see chapter 10.
[2:13] you see the true expression of godliness
[2:15] as you read about jesus christ in the
[2:17] four gospels because he lived by every
[2:19] word of god
[2:21] jesus is god's manifestation of his own
[2:23] character in a flesh body
[2:25] to understand godliness you need only
[2:28] look to jesus christ's behavior
[2:31] jesus manifested godly character by
[2:34] constantly increasing his wisdom
[2:36] godliness is attained through a slow
[2:38] steady growth
[2:40] even at 12 years old jesus's heart was
[2:43] burdened with doing his father's
[2:44] business
[2:45] scripture records that jesus increased
[2:48] in wisdom and stature and in favor with
[2:50] god and man
[2:52] godliness was mysteriously manifested in
[2:54] the life of christ as he daily increased
[2:56] his devotion and loyalty to god the
[2:59] father as always his life is the
[3:02] guidance for understanding our lives
[3:06] the confusion about the mystery of
[3:08] godliness
[3:10] the confusion about godliness centers
[3:12] around human effort and its
[3:13] attainability is human effort required
[3:16] to reach godliness
[3:18] if so how much effort is needed
[3:21] can godliness even be attained
[3:23] if churches teach human effort is
[3:25] required some will instantly accuse them
[3:27] of legalism and works-based salvation
[3:30] the age-old works or faith debate is
[3:33] revived as you study godliness
[3:35] but god's word settles his debate once
[3:37] and for all as god's revelation on
[3:40] godliness unfolds in this chapter
[3:43] the revelation of the mystery of
[3:45] godliness is that god uses works of
[3:47] grace to incrementally anoint christians
[3:51] with measures of christ's own godly
[3:53] character as they lovingly yield all
[3:56] their human strength
[3:58] biblical evidence for the revelation of
[4:00] godliness
[4:02] jesus eliminates all confusion about
[4:04] obtaining godliness through his teaching
[4:06] about the two greatest commandments in
[4:08] matthew 22 verses
[4:11] 37-39
[4:13] jesus said unto him thou shalt love the
[4:15] lord thy god with all thy heart
[4:17] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[4:20] mind
[4:20] this is the first and great commandment
[4:23] and the second is like unto it thou
[4:25] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[4:29] human effort is required to reach
[4:31] godliness and its motivation is love
[4:34] in fact jesus says you must use all your
[4:37] human effort or strength in a parallel
[4:39] passage in the gospel of mark and thou
[4:42] shalt love the lord thy god with all thy
[4:44] heart and with all thy soul and with all
[4:47] thy mind and with all thy strength this
[4:49] is the first commandment
[4:52] all your human effort and strength is
[4:54] required to manifest godliness
[4:57] if absolutely no human effort or action
[4:59] is required for salvation then all
[5:01] sinners will be saved
[5:03] it's ridiculous to think judas is scared
[5:05] whom jesus said was lost in john 17
[5:08] verse 12
[5:09] and the rich man literally in hell in
[5:12] luke 16 23 will be saved
[5:16] the reason they are lost is because they
[5:17] refused god's love into their souls
[5:20] a choice necessary for salvation
[5:22] humans must do something for salvation
[5:25] and it is belief
[5:28] surprising to some all human actions are
[5:30] based upon love whether the person is a
[5:33] sinner or saint
[5:35] sinners are lost and go to hell because
[5:36] they love the pleasures of the world
[5:39] love for unbelief motivates their human
[5:41] effort
[5:42] jesus says in john 3 verse 19
[5:45] and this is the condemnation that light
[5:48] has come into the world and men love
[5:50] darkness rather than light because their
[5:52] deeds were evil
[5:54] paul echoes this truth by teaching
[5:56] sinners are traitors heady high-minded
[5:59] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[6:01] god
[6:02] paul never said these sinners didn't
[6:04] love god their fatal problem was that
[6:07] they loved the world more than they
[6:08] loved god
[6:11] jesus silences the legalism accusation
[6:14] legalism is defined as excessive
[6:16] adherence to law or formula
[6:19] meaning legalism is an addition to the
[6:21] word of god
[6:23] scripture condemns anyone who adds to
[6:25] god's word in proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6
[6:28] and revelation 22 verses 18 and 19.
[6:32] an obvious bible example of legalism is
[6:35] paul encountering legalistic jewish
[6:37] teachers who were requiring circumcision
[6:40] for salvation which he condemned as a
[6:42] fall from grace
[6:44] jesus never asked us to do anything
[6:46] outside the bible's commands
[6:48] rather he empowers our human effort to
[6:51] do all his commands by his love which is
[6:54] shed in our hearts
[6:56] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[6:59] love of god is shed abroad in our hearts
[7:02] by the holy ghost which is given unto us
[7:06] obeying god with all your love and human
[7:08] strength is attainable through a
[7:10] self-crucifixion
[7:12] of your sinful human will
[7:14] jesus declares in luke 14 27
[7:17] and whosoever doth not bear his cross
[7:20] and come after me cannot be my disciple
[7:23] jesus's true disciples follow his
[7:25] commands through a daily death to
[7:27] selfishness
[7:29] this is the only way to live in the holy
[7:31] spirit as romans 8 13 says for if we
[7:35] live after the flesh ye shall die but if
[7:37] ye through the spirit do mortify the
[7:39] deeds of the body ye shall live
[7:42] paul again writes mortify therefore your
[7:45] members which are upon the earth
[7:47] fornication uncleanness
[7:49] inordinate affection evil concuptions
[7:52] and covetousness which is idolatry for
[7:55] which things say the wrath of god cometh
[7:58] on the children of disobedience
[8:00] paul experienced this daily
[8:02] self-crucifixion personally saying i
[8:05] protest by your rejoicing which i have
[8:07] in christ jesus our lord i die daily
[8:12] scripture teaches you yield your will
[8:14] and human strength to one of two masters
[8:18] jesus says you cannot serve both god and
[8:20] mammon meaning riches in luke 16 13
[8:24] no servant can serve two masters for
[8:26] either he will hate the one and love the
[8:28] other or else he will hold to the one
[8:30] and despise the other you cannot serve
[8:33] god and mammon
[8:35] which master do you love more god or
[8:37] riches
[8:38] paul says you'll either yield to sin or
[8:41] god in romans 6 13. neither yield ye
[8:44] your members as instruments of
[8:46] unrighteousness unto sin
[8:48] but yield yourselves unto god as those
[8:51] that are alive from the dead and your
[8:53] members as instruments of righteousness
[8:55] unto god
[8:57] if you yield to god with all your
[8:59] strength you'll achieve godliness
[9:03] two types of godliness
[9:06] scripture differentiates two types of
[9:08] godliness
[9:09] one is an initial level of devotion you
[9:11] receive as you approach your spiritual
[9:14] birth or before you are born again
[9:16] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[9:19] this measure or portion of godliness is
[9:22] the sixth character trait god adds to
[9:24] your being after he saved your soul
[9:26] through the substance of faith
[9:29] the second type of godliness is a mature
[9:31] rare
[9:32] spiritual state of devotion a believer
[9:34] manifests after he is born again
[9:37] chapter 6 gives a full teaching on the
[9:39] born-again experience
[9:40] the baptism of the holy ghost
[9:42] this mature godliness is the mystery of
[9:45] godliness seen in jesus's life as he
[9:48] fully and constantly obeyed the father
[9:51] the fact that there are two types of
[9:52] godliness gives this subject its
[9:54] mysterious nature it is no different
[9:57] from the mystery of two kinds of
[9:58] fillings of god's spirit
[10:00] one in your mind and another in your
[10:02] soul see chapter six
[10:05] often when something seems confusing in
[10:06] scripture god is hiding in mystery
[10:09] behind it urging you to dig deeper in
[10:12] search of revelation
[10:14] paul and peter repeatedly mention the
[10:16] mature state of godliness
[10:18] paul's instructions to timothy a
[10:20] preacher
[10:21] are to exercise himself unto godliness
[10:24] as he follows after godliness
[10:26] in paul's mind christians are actively
[10:28] seeking to display all godliness
[10:31] peter echoes the same
[10:33] saying christians ought to be dedicated
[10:35] persons in all holy conversation and
[10:38] godliness looking for and hastening unto
[10:40] the coming of the day of god
[10:42] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[10:45] be dissolved and the elements shall melt
[10:47] with fervent heat
[10:49] both apostles are pointing us to mature
[10:51] godliness like christ's who says he does
[10:54] nothing of himself but what he see the
[10:56] father do
[10:58] jesus did only what his father told him
[11:00] to do you are approaching mature
[11:02] godliness when your daily actions are
[11:04] only those that god leads you to do
[11:07] christ spoke only the words his father
[11:09] gave him as evidenced in john 8 38
[11:13] i speak that which i have seen with my
[11:16] father
[11:18] more on paul's teaching about mature
[11:20] godliness
[11:22] the apostle paul provides five texts
[11:25] the most of any new testament author
[11:28] about the mature state of godliness that
[11:30] help us understand its meaning and
[11:32] application to our lives
[11:35] beginning in titus 1 verses 1 and 2 paul
[11:38] says he is a servant of god and an
[11:40] apostle of jesus christ according to the
[11:42] faith of god's elect and the
[11:44] acknowledging of the truth which is
[11:46] after godliness
[11:48] christians acknowledge the truth is
[11:50] after or according to godliness
[11:53] recognizing the one and only true
[11:55] religion christianity promotes godliness
[11:58] paul a former hebrew of the hebrews a
[12:01] zealous pharisee and law keeper assures
[12:04] all christians that their faith follows
[12:06] godliness
[12:09] in the second text of 1st timothy 2
[12:11] verses 1 through 3 paul says it's good
[12:14] and acceptable in the sight of god when
[12:16] christians lead a quiet and peaceable
[12:18] life in all godliness and honesty
[12:21] in context paul encourages christians to
[12:24] pray for all men including our
[12:26] government officials
[12:27] notice that all godliness is attainable
[12:29] and pleases our lord
[12:31] christians do not settle for partial
[12:33] godliness they set their sights on
[12:35] accomplishing complete godliness
[12:39] the third text first timothy 4 verses 7
[12:41] and 8 follows paul's identification of
[12:45] jesus's life as the mysterious godliness
[12:48] first timothy 3 16 and then says
[12:51] christians obtain godliness through the
[12:53] imagery of spiritual exercise
[12:55] just as physical exercise helps you
[12:57] reach healthiness paul says vigorous
[13:00] spiritual exercise helps you reach
[13:02] godliness
[13:03] paul rebukes heavily exercising our
[13:05] minds in fiction or listening to profane
[13:08] and old wives fables
[13:10] the apostle says exercise thyself rather
[13:13] unto godliness for bodily exercise
[13:16] profiteth little but godliness is
[13:18] profitable unto all things
[13:20] having promise of the life that now is
[13:23] and of that which is to come in the
[13:25] greek lexicon exercise means to exercise
[13:28] vigorously in any way either the body or
[13:32] the mind
[13:33] your mind exercises by repeatedly
[13:35] meditating on things that are true
[13:38] honest just pure
[13:40] lovely virtuous and praiseworthy paul
[13:43] says you must set your affections on
[13:45] things above and the final result will
[13:47] be your spiritual transformation
[13:51] in first timothy 6 verses 3 through 12
[13:54] paul's fourth and most thorough teaching
[13:56] on godliness mentions godliness four
[13:58] times
[13:59] he begins by affirming that the doctrine
[14:01] of jesus christ is according to
[14:02] godliness
[14:04] and warns of false teachers who suppose
[14:06] financial gain is a sign of godliness
[14:09] paul urges you to withdraw from the
[14:11] prosperity gospel and its preachers
[14:13] god does not promise riches to the godly
[14:16] true christians seek spiritual
[14:18] prosperity not financial prosperity
[14:21] rivers of truth flow from paul's pen as
[14:23] he describes our fight to be both godly
[14:26] and content but godliness with
[14:28] contentment is great gain for we brought
[14:31] nothing into this world and it is
[14:33] certain we can carry nothing out and
[14:35] having food and raiment let us be there
[14:38] with content
[14:39] but they that will be rich fall into
[14:41] temptation and a snare and into many
[14:43] foolish and hurtful lusts which draw men
[14:46] in destruction and perdition
[14:48] for the love of money is the root of all
[14:50] evil
[14:51] which while some coveted after they have
[14:53] heard from the faith and pierced
[14:55] themselves through with many sorrows but
[14:58] thou o man of god flee these things and
[15:00] follow after righteousness godliness
[15:03] faith love patience meekness
[15:07] fight the good fight of faith lay hold
[15:09] on eternal life whereunto thou art also
[15:12] called and has professed a good
[15:14] profession before many witnesses
[15:17] always remember that you are fighting to
[15:19] obtain mature godliness while
[15:21] simultaneously remaining content with
[15:24] worldly possessions
[15:27] in his final letter before his martyrdom
[15:29] paul teaches again on godliness in
[15:31] second timothy 3 verses 1-17
[15:35] while prophesying he warns believers
[15:37] about the perilous or dangerous
[15:39] spiritual conditions in the last days
[15:41] paul lists 18 sinful attributes
[15:44] including covetousness pride
[15:46] unthankfulness and being boastful men
[15:49] will exhibit while maintaining a form of
[15:52] godliness
[15:53] in the greek lexicon form means shaping
[15:56] the mere form
[15:57] semblance
[15:59] how deceptive satan is for he enslaves
[16:01] the masses into a hollow or false
[16:03] godliness by training them to love sin
[16:06] more than god
[16:07] no doubt men and women faithfully attend
[16:10] and give some money to churches
[16:12] some spend time in bible devotions and
[16:14] yet do not attain true godliness
[16:17] this happened in jesus day as the holy
[16:20] spirit instantly brings to mind the
[16:22] pharisees form of godliness
[16:24] jesus said they were beautiful in
[16:26] outward appearance yet full of extortion
[16:28] excess hypocrisy and iniquity
[16:31] pharisees were devoid of true godliness
[16:34] yet faithfully attended and prayed
[16:35] publicly in the temple and were devout
[16:38] donors
[16:39] you glean that genuine godliness comes
[16:41] from a pure heart that loves god far
[16:44] more than worldly pleasures
[16:46] in your lifetime these last days
[16:49] your warned false hollow godliness will
[16:52] wax worse and worse deceiving and being
[16:54] deceived you can obtain true godliness
[16:57] by living selflessly and continuing in
[17:00] the holy scriptures
[17:01] which are able to make thee wise unto
[17:04] salvation through faith which is in
[17:06] christ jesus
[17:09] peter steps to initial godliness
[17:11] here is where you focus on the other
[17:13] type of godliness the initial anointing
[17:15] of godliness before you are born again
[17:19] christ anoints peter to reveal the exact
[17:21] steps god uses to help believers obtain
[17:24] an initial measure of godliness in
[17:26] second peter 1 verses 1 through 15.
[17:30] god gives 8 spiritual portions of
[17:32] character to believers as they mature in
[17:34] christianity with godliness being the
[17:36] sixth measure it is striking to discover
[17:39] that jesus gave peter both the keys to
[17:41] the kingdom of heaven and the steps for
[17:43] godliness
[17:44] the book of acts records how peter took
[17:46] the keys or power and authority to
[17:49] unlock the door to the promise of the
[17:52] father the born-again experience
[17:55] each of the eight steps involves god
[17:56] adding a portion or measure of his
[17:59] divine nature to a christian spiritual
[18:01] character
[18:03] notice the word measure the idea of god
[18:05] giving us eight spiritual measures of
[18:07] his nature comes from romans 12 3
[18:10] for i say through the grace given unto
[18:13] me to every man that is among you not to
[18:15] think of himself more highly than he
[18:17] ought to think but to think soberly
[18:20] according as god hath dealt to every man
[18:22] the measure of faith
[18:24] paul teaches god gives every man a
[18:25] measure or portion of faith
[18:28] recall from the previous figure that
[18:30] faith is the first character quality
[18:32] given to believers for by grace are ye
[18:35] saved through faith
[18:36] as you will learn faith is the beginning
[18:38] point of your relationship with almighty
[18:41] god
[18:43] peter uses the exact word add which
[18:45] means to supply
[18:47] furnish present to describe how man
[18:50] receives the eight christ-like character
[18:52] qualities
[18:53] how marvelous is the truth that you can
[18:55] have christ's own mentality or
[18:57] disposition the faithful god supplies
[19:00] you with the necessary spiritual portion
[19:02] during each step of your christian
[19:04] journey god the father did the same for
[19:06] jesus as luke 2 verse 52 records and
[19:10] jesus increased in wisdom and stature
[19:13] and in favor with god and man
[19:15] god increased or added to jesus's
[19:18] character as he grew
[19:21] combining peter's text with a similar
[19:23] text about becoming a complete mature
[19:26] christian in ephesians 4 verses 8
[19:28] through 24 this 8 step spiritual
[19:31] building process can be called the
[19:33] stature of a perfect man
[19:35] in the greek stature means maturity
[19:38] these steps show you how you become a
[19:40] mature living dwelling place of the
[19:42] living god
[19:43] for your body is a temple of the holy
[19:45] ghost
[19:46] first corinthians 6 verses 19 and 20
[19:49] declares what know ye not that your body
[19:52] is the temple of the holy ghost which is
[19:54] in you which ye have of god and ye are
[19:56] not your own for you are bought with a
[19:59] price therefore glorify god in your body
[20:02] and in your spirit which are gods
[20:06] ephesians 4 verses 8 through 24
[20:09] emphasizes five preaching gifts god uses
[20:12] to impart the eight character qualities
[20:14] in the stature of a perfect man
[20:16] apostle prophet evangelist pastor and
[20:20] teacher
[20:21] once jesus ascended to heaven to sit at
[20:23] the right hand of his father these five
[20:25] gifts are what he gave unto men for the
[20:28] perfecting of the saints till we all
[20:30] come in the unity of the faith and of
[20:32] the knowledge of the son of god unto a
[20:34] perfect man unto the measure of the
[20:37] stature of the fullness of christ
[20:39] it shouldn't surprise you that preaching
[20:41] brings complete maturity to christians
[20:43] because it is preaching that initially
[20:45] brings you to salvation
[20:47] the bible says it please god
[20:49] by the foolishness of preaching to save
[20:52] them that believe
[20:54] how comforting to know that the same
[20:56] method christians are saved by will also
[20:58] be used to impart further christlike
[21:00] character
[21:02] in our earthly journey god will always
[21:04] use preaching to increase our maturity
[21:06] so then faith cometh by hearing and
[21:08] hearing by the word of god
[21:11] faithful preachers are used by god to
[21:13] impart the following benefits
[21:15] perfecting of the saints
[21:17] work of the ministry
[21:19] edifying of the body of christ
[21:21] unity of faith and knowledge of the son
[21:23] of god unto a perfect man
[21:25] maturity and doctrinal stability
[21:29] character quality is a spiritual
[21:31] crossroad on a believer's journey
[21:34] just as israel made an exodus out of
[21:36] egypt following every move of the pillar
[21:38] of fire christians leave a sinful life
[21:41] while following every leading of the
[21:43] holy ghost
[21:44] believers must decide whether to
[21:46] continue growing in god's word by
[21:48] walking in obedience to his commands or
[21:50] reject his leadership the next figure
[21:52] shows why believers must accept the
[21:54] character qualities from god at each
[21:56] crossroad or stage of their christian
[21:59] journey and why they must reject satan's
[22:02] bait
[22:03] just as god told moses life and death is
[22:05] set before every believer
[22:07] good and evil were said before adam and
[22:09] eve you must either accept or reject
[22:11] god's gifts in every season of life
[22:15] faith is the first character quality you
[22:17] must accept and you must reject unbelief
[22:21] because faith is the substance needed to
[22:23] choose god's way
[22:25] virtue is the second character quality
[22:27] you must accept and you must reject
[22:30] hypocrisy because virtue is the strength
[22:32] needed to daily walk god's way
[22:35] the third character quality is knowledge
[22:37] you must accept and you must reject
[22:40] human reasoning because knowledge is the
[22:42] understanding needed to know why you
[22:44] walk in all god's ways
[22:46] the fourth character quality you must
[22:48] accept is temperance while you reject
[22:51] sensuality
[22:53] because temperance is the self-control
[22:55] needed to remain on god's way
[22:58] fifth you must accept the character
[22:59] quality of patience and you must reject
[23:02] haste because patience is the
[23:04] steadfastness needed to be content on
[23:07] god's way
[23:09] sixth
[23:10] you must accept godliness
[23:12] and reject irreverence because godliness
[23:15] is the devotion needed to be just like
[23:17] god on god's way
[23:20] seventh you must accept broadly kindness
[23:22] and reject selfishness because brotherly
[23:25] kindness is the selflessness needed to
[23:27] live for your christian family on god's
[23:30] way
[23:32] eighth you must accept charity
[23:34] and reject resistance because charity is
[23:37] god's abiding loving presence needed to
[23:40] completely manifest the will of god for
[23:43] your life
[23:46] character quality number one faith
[23:49] faith is the foundational character
[23:51] quality
[23:52] hebrews 11 verse 1 defines faith as the
[23:55] substance of things hoped for the
[23:57] evidence of things not seen
[24:00] additionally hebrews 11 verse 6 says
[24:03] without faith it is impossible to please
[24:05] him for he that cometh to god must
[24:07] believe that he is and that he is
[24:09] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[24:11] him
[24:12] faith is the first and most necessary
[24:14] character quality needed to please god
[24:18] faith is a gift from god salvation is
[24:21] indeed a gift to all who will receive it
[24:23] as ephesians 2 verse 8 says for by grace
[24:26] are ye saved through faith and that not
[24:29] of yourselves it is the gift of god not
[24:32] of works lest any man should boast
[24:35] faith is not earned by human effort
[24:37] rather it is freely given
[24:39] paul writes in romans 8 32
[24:42] he that spared not his own son but
[24:44] delivered him up for us all
[24:47] how shall he not with him also freely
[24:49] give us all things
[24:51] second peter 1 3 says
[24:54] according as his divine power hath given
[24:56] unto us all things that pertain unto
[24:58] life and godliness through the knowledge
[25:01] of him that hath called us to glory and
[25:03] virtue
[25:05] jesus says few will accept saving faith
[25:08] so choose to be one of the few who
[25:10] accept this eternal gift
[25:13] a christian spiritual journey begins
[25:15] with faith
[25:16] before faith comes a person is lost in
[25:19] unbelief or spiritually dead
[25:21] ephesians 2 verse 1 says unbelievers are
[25:25] dead in sin and trespasses
[25:27] believing in jesus christ as savior
[25:30] brings spiritual life as jesus says
[25:32] believers pass from death unto life
[25:36] faith comes when a person rejects
[25:38] unbelief repents from his sins and trust
[25:41] in christ for forgiveness
[25:43] in the greek repent means to change
[25:46] one's mind for better heartily to amend
[25:49] with abhorrence of one's past sins
[25:51] scripture calls this change of mind a
[25:54] turning of the heart
[25:55] john the baptist's preaching was to turn
[25:57] the hearts of the fathers to the
[25:59] children and their disobedient to the
[26:01] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[26:04] people prepared for the lord
[26:06] similarly paul's preaching would open
[26:08] their eyes
[26:09] and to turn them from darkness to light
[26:12] and from the power of satan unto god
[26:14] that they may receive forgiveness of
[26:16] sins and inheritance among them which
[26:19] are sanctified by faith that is in me
[26:23] both john the baptist and jesus christ
[26:25] preached repentance and remission of
[26:27] sins as the starting place for serving
[26:29] god
[26:30] mark 1 verse 4 says
[26:32] john did baptize in the wilderness and
[26:34] preach the baptism of repentance for the
[26:37] remission of sins
[26:39] then mark 1 verses 14 and 15 says
[26:42] now after that john was put in prison
[26:45] jesus came into galilee preaching the
[26:47] gospel of the kingdom of god and saying
[26:49] the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of
[26:51] god is at hand repent ye and believe the
[26:54] gospel
[26:56] jesus instructs us to believe the gospel
[26:58] or good news
[26:59] that we can be forgiven all our sins and
[27:01] become part of god's kingdom christ says
[27:04] i came not to call the righteous but
[27:07] sinners to repentance
[27:10] at the moment a person is saved through
[27:12] repentance he receives life the
[27:14] spiritual substance of faith in his soul
[27:17] first thessalonians 5 23 teaches every
[27:19] man has three parts to his being
[27:22] body human spirit and soul
[27:25] this faith substance is a small but
[27:27] powerful anointing of the holy ghost in
[27:30] the soul
[27:31] faith in the soul is likened unto a seed
[27:33] in a seed packet the seed is not yet
[27:36] growing but life is inside it and it has
[27:38] so much potential
[27:40] the new believer feels new life upon
[27:42] receiving faith prior to faith coming he
[27:45] walked according to the course of this
[27:47] world
[27:48] according to the prince of the power of
[27:50] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[27:52] the children of disobedience
[27:54] in other words he used to be anointed by
[27:57] and obedient to demonic spirits or death
[28:00] but now he's anointed with a measure of
[28:02] life god's spirit the substance of faith
[28:07] zacchaeus and the woman at simon's house
[28:09] are examples of scripture capturing the
[28:11] very moment believers pass from death to
[28:14] life
[28:16] once faith entered his soul zacchaeus
[28:18] vowed to restore all he'd stolen
[28:21] jesus identified that day as his day of
[28:24] salvation saying
[28:26] this day is salvation come to this house
[28:29] for as much as he also is a son of
[28:31] abraham for the son of man is come to
[28:33] seek and save that which was lost
[28:36] you can know the very day salvation
[28:38] comes to your heart
[28:40] galatians 3 verse 7 supports jesus
[28:42] declaration of zacchaeus as the son of
[28:45] abraham saying
[28:46] know ye therefore that they which are of
[28:48] faith the same are the children of
[28:50] abraham
[28:52] at simon the pharisees house a sincere
[28:54] repentant woman called a sinner found
[28:57] salvation through christ as she washed
[29:00] jesus feet with her tears
[29:02] her faith moved her to wash and anoint
[29:04] jesus's feet and through her faith she
[29:07] was saved
[29:08] our lord first pronounced her
[29:09] forgiveness and then said thy faith has
[29:12] saved thee go in peace
[29:16] new testament believers are immediately
[29:18] baptized or fully immersed in water as a
[29:21] public testimony of their new life or
[29:23] faith in christ jesus
[29:25] in acts 8 verses 26 through 40 the
[29:29] ethiopian eunuch stopped his chariot in
[29:31] the middle of his travels home so philip
[29:33] could immediately baptize him in water
[29:36] moments after his heart turned believing
[29:38] in christ as messiah
[29:41] at paul's miraculous turn to faith the
[29:43] scales fell from his eyes and he was
[29:46] immediately baptized
[29:48] jesus purpose for paul was to help
[29:50] others experience the same turn to faith
[29:52] that he had experienced
[29:54] paul's life is a striking example
[29:57] of turning from death to life
[29:59] the man who once jailed christians and
[30:01] consented to stephen's death because he
[30:03] was a christian is now sent to preach
[30:06] freedom liberty and the newness of life
[30:08] through jesus christ
[30:10] furthermore the beginning of the book of
[30:12] acts illustrates in depth how
[30:14] beautifully faith comes to new
[30:16] christians
[30:19] acts chapter 2 demonstrates how 000 new
[30:21] christians were baptized after receiving
[30:24] god's gift of faith the day of pentecost
[30:26] begins with 120 believers being filled
[30:29] with the holy spirit early in the
[30:31] morning in a private upper room setting
[30:34] their joyful loud and exuberant worship
[30:37] could not be contained in the upper room
[30:39] and flowed into the streets of jerusalem
[30:42] becoming a 9 am worship service
[30:45] seeing it is but the third hour of the
[30:47] day
[30:48] their holy ghost baptism experience gets
[30:50] noised abroad jerusalem causing a
[30:53] multitude to gather around them
[30:55] some mock their worship calling them
[30:57] drunk
[30:58] peter freshly anointed with the holy
[31:00] spirit stands up and preaches the gospel
[31:02] with a loud voice
[31:04] beginning his sermon by identifying the
[31:06] scripture the christians are fulfilling
[31:08] joel 2 verses 28 through 32
[31:12] peter says his group has not received
[31:14] new wine
[31:15] but the spirit of the living god his
[31:18] next point is to indict the multitudes
[31:20] wicked act of delivering christ
[31:22] the god-approved miracle worker to be
[31:25] crucified peter continues by quoting
[31:27] psalm 16 verses 8 through 11 proving
[31:31] that jesus is the foreknown holy one or
[31:33] messiah god would raise from the dead
[31:36] and david was not speaking of himself
[31:39] the apostle declares himself to be a
[31:40] witness of jesus's resurrection and the
[31:43] events of the morning to be the
[31:45] fulfillment of the heavenly father's
[31:47] promise of the holy ghost
[31:49] the sermon is concluded by peter's
[31:51] declaration to the house of israel that
[31:54] god hath made that same jesus whom you
[31:57] have crucified both lord and christ
[32:01] stop and recognize that peter had to
[32:03] preach both bad news and good news
[32:05] the bad news was the followers of
[32:07] judaism were guilty of letting their
[32:09] innocent messiah be crucified by wicked
[32:12] men
[32:13] peter indicted israel for rejecting
[32:15] their own savior
[32:16] the good news was jesus defeated death
[32:19] resurrected to heaven at the right hand
[32:21] of god and was now pouring out his
[32:23] promised spirit upon believers
[32:26] the bad news convicted the 17 nation
[32:28] multitude for they were pricked in their
[32:30] heart or sorrowful agitated and pained
[32:34] in the mind according to the greek
[32:36] lexicon
[32:37] bad news really hurts but can cause
[32:39] hearts to seek deliverance the
[32:42] multitude's humble response to peter's
[32:43] sermon was men and brethren what shall
[32:46] we do
[32:47] the walking on water apostle delivers
[32:50] what may be called the true church's
[32:52] first and only creed recorded in acts 2
[32:55] verses 38-39 preaching
[32:58] repent and be baptized every one of you
[33:00] in the name of jesus christ for the
[33:02] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[33:04] the gift of the holy ghost
[33:06] for the promise is unto you and to your
[33:08] children and to all that are far off
[33:11] even as many as the lord our god shall
[33:13] call
[33:15] observe that faith comes after god's
[33:17] word convicts guilty sinners who admit
[33:20] and turn from their hopeless wickedness
[33:23] called repentance
[33:24] desiring to trust in jesus christ for
[33:27] complete forgiveness
[33:29] this pattern for receiving faith worked
[33:31] two thousand years ago and still works
[33:33] today
[33:35] if you haven't repented and been
[33:36] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[33:39] your remission of sins with the
[33:41] accompanying gift of the baptism of the
[33:43] holy ghost
[33:44] won't you seek this eternal blessing
[33:46] today
[33:49] love produces faith then faith produces
[33:51] works
[33:53] another of jesus's comments to the
[33:55] sinner woman at simon's house
[33:57] unveils the origin and order of all
[34:00] works
[34:01] love
[34:02] faith works
[34:04] notice jesus's words to the forgiven
[34:06] woman in luke 7
[34:08] verse 47
[34:10] her sins which are many are forgiven for
[34:13] she loved much but to whom little is
[34:15] forgiven the same loveth little
[34:19] clearly this woman's love for jesus
[34:21] moved her to do the work of washing and
[34:24] anointing his feet
[34:25] love is the only motivation god accepts
[34:28] for all christian acts or works
[34:31] paul says love comes before faith and
[34:33] works because faith worketh by love
[34:36] the forgiven woman first loved jesus
[34:38] christ which helped her receive faith in
[34:41] christ her faith and went to work
[34:44] causing her to wash and anoint jesus's
[34:46] feet
[34:47] figure 7 shows the order of all
[34:49] christian works through this woman's
[34:51] example
[34:52] love is the first christian work
[34:55] in her sinful state the woman somehow
[34:57] learned of jesus and deeply fell in love
[34:59] with him and his godly character perhaps
[35:02] she saw him preach and perform miracles
[35:04] maybe she saw jesus disciples baptizing
[35:07] new believers after jesus forgave them
[35:10] one thing is certain jesus said for she
[35:13] loved much
[35:14] the second step is faith
[35:16] she had faith she could be forgiven of
[35:18] her many sins
[35:20] she saw herself as a sin debtor which is
[35:22] how jesus described her condition
[35:25] her faith in christ move her to prepare
[35:27] to do the work of washing and anointing
[35:29] jesus
[35:30] she brought an alabaster box of ointment
[35:32] to simon's house and waited for the
[35:34] right moment to begin washing his feet
[35:37] paul said faith worketh by love
[35:41] the third step in all christian works is
[35:44] works
[35:45] the woman worked by letting her tears
[35:47] wash jesus's feet using her hair as a
[35:50] towel to clean his dirty feet
[35:52] she then kissed his feet and anointed
[35:54] them with ointment
[35:55] after jesus saw her love empower her
[35:58] faith and her faith manifest a good work
[36:00] upon him he said thy faith hath saved
[36:03] thee jesus always sees works as faith in
[36:06] action like the men who let down the
[36:09] palsy stricken man through the roof
[36:10] tiles in luke 5 verses 17-26
[36:15] luke says and when he jesus saw their
[36:18] faith he said unto him man thy sins are
[36:22] forgiven thee
[36:24] christians are not saved by works
[36:26] according to ephesians 2 verse 8 but
[36:28] once saved christians recognize god
[36:31] created them to do good works according
[36:33] to paul in ephesians 2 verse 10
[36:36] for we are his workmanship created in
[36:39] christ jesus unto good works which god
[36:42] hath before ordained that we should walk
[36:44] in them
[36:45] the forgiven woman was created to wash
[36:47] jesus's feet at simon's house and
[36:50] therefore walked in god's plans for her
[36:52] life
[36:53] before she could do that she had to fall
[36:55] in love with jesus
[36:57] once full of love for him her faith went
[36:59] to work
[37:02] the age-old faith versus works debate is
[37:05] now made plain you are saved by god's
[37:07] amazing grace
[37:08] your experience begins when your heart
[37:10] begins to love god this love produces
[37:13] faith in his eternal word
[37:15] faith motivated by love works out god's
[37:18] plan for your life
[37:20] genuine works of obedience always
[37:21] originate with a loving heart that
[37:23] brings faith into the soul
[37:27] justification by faith
[37:30] at the moment a believer is saved by
[37:31] grace through faith he is justified in
[37:34] the sight of god paul devotes
[37:36] significant time to solidifying god's
[37:38] promise to justify believers in romans
[37:41] chapters three through five and
[37:43] galatians chapters two and three
[37:47] in the greek lexicon justification means
[37:50] to show one to be righteous and to
[37:52] declare one to be just
[37:54] when you stand before the judgment seat
[37:56] of christ
[37:57] paul says we shall all stand before the
[37:59] judgment seat of christ
[38:00] you desperately want him to declare you
[38:03] righteous not unrighteous
[38:05] just as you'd want an earthly judge to
[38:07] declare you righteous in court you want
[38:09] heaven's judge to justify you before the
[38:12] throne of god
[38:14] romans 3 explains how sinful men and
[38:16] women can be righteous and just in god's
[38:18] sight
[38:19] but paul begins romans 3 verses 10
[38:22] through 12 by explaining mankind's
[38:24] hopeless situation apart from christ
[38:27] saying
[38:28] there is none righteous no not one there
[38:31] is none that understandeth there is none
[38:34] that seeketh after god they are all gone
[38:36] out of the way they are together become
[38:39] unprofitable there is none that doeth
[38:41] good no not one
[38:44] in romans 3 verses 19 through 31 paul
[38:48] says all the world is guilty before god
[38:51] for all have sinned and come short of
[38:52] the glory of god
[38:54] and unable to be justified by human
[38:56] efforts to keep god's law
[38:59] through christ's blood
[39:00] there is a righteousness of god without
[39:02] the law god is offering to all
[39:05] the righteousness of god is unto all
[39:08] and upon all them that believe by god's
[39:11] own design genuine belief or trust
[39:14] in christ's sacrifice is all that is
[39:16] required for salvation being justified
[39:18] freely by his grace through the
[39:20] redemption that is in christ jesus
[39:23] whom god has set forth to be a
[39:25] propitiation through faith in his blood
[39:28] to declare his righteousness for the
[39:29] remission of sins that are passed
[39:32] through the forbearance of god to
[39:34] declare i say at this time his
[39:37] righteousness that he might be just and
[39:40] the justifier of him that believeth in
[39:42] jesus
[39:43] where is boasting then it is excluded by
[39:46] what law or works
[39:48] nay but by the law of faith therefore we
[39:51] conclude that a man is justified by
[39:53] faith without the deeds of the law
[39:57] the just one christ
[39:59] justifies all who believe in him
[40:01] jesus declares his righteousness for the
[40:03] remission of our sins
[40:05] no man can brag about his own
[40:07] righteousness because he has none
[40:10] romans 4 verse 3 explains that
[40:12] christians are justified in the same way
[40:14] abraham was
[40:16] he simply believed god and it was
[40:18] counted unto him for righteousness
[40:21] god counts your simple humble faith as
[40:24] righteousness
[40:25] romans 4 verse 5 says but to him that
[40:27] worketh not but believeth on him that
[40:30] justifieth the ungodly his faith is
[40:32] counted for righteousness
[40:34] god's spirit anointed david to describe
[40:36] this amazing promise
[40:38] one thousand years before christ
[40:41] even as david also describeth the
[40:43] blessedness of the man
[40:45] unto whom god imputeth righteousness
[40:47] without works saying
[40:48] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[40:51] forgiven and whose sins are covered
[40:53] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[40:55] not impute sin
[40:57] and all these indescribable blessings
[40:59] flow from the cross and resurrection for
[41:02] christ was delivered for our offenses
[41:05] and was raised again for our
[41:07] justification
[41:10] in romans 5 verses 1 and 2 paul states
[41:13] therefore being justified by faith we
[41:16] have peace with god through our lord
[41:18] jesus christ by whom also we have access
[41:20] by faith into this grace wherein we
[41:23] stand and rejoice in hope of the glory
[41:26] of god
[41:27] again observe how god's grace brings you
[41:30] to the state of justification
[41:32] by believing in christ's blood you have
[41:34] peace with god
[41:36] one greek meaning of peace is exemption
[41:38] from the rage and havoc of war
[41:41] god is not angry with believers he's not
[41:44] enraged at their sins nor warn against
[41:46] their every decision
[41:48] the heavenly father patiently chastens
[41:50] believers like a father pities his
[41:52] children
[41:54] indeed every justified christian has no
[41:56] charges nor accusations against them
[41:59] before god's throne for paul declares
[42:01] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[42:04] god's elect it is god that justifieth
[42:08] jesus christ has entered into heaven
[42:10] itself
[42:11] now to appear in the prince of god for
[42:13] us
[42:14] and he is able also to save them to the
[42:17] uttermost that come unto god by him
[42:20] seeing he ever liveth to make
[42:22] intercession for them
[42:25] galatians chapters 2 and 3 address
[42:27] justification by faith saying no flesh
[42:30] can be justified by the law in the sight
[42:32] of god
[42:34] justification is by faith for both jew
[42:37] and gentile being foretold for gentiles
[42:40] in genesis 12 3 and habakkuk 2 verse 4
[42:45] god promised to bless all nations
[42:47] through abraham saying
[42:49] and i will bless them that bless thee
[42:50] and curse him that curseth thee and in
[42:53] thee shall all families of the earth be
[42:55] blessed
[42:56] over 600 years before christ the prophet
[42:59] habakkuk wrote god's vision that the
[43:01] just shall live by his faith
[43:04] the law of moses served as a school
[43:05] master or tutor to bring us unto christ
[43:09] that we might be justified by faith
[43:13] some say james 2 verse 24 causes
[43:16] confusion in the faith versus works
[43:18] debate but those accusations are wrong
[43:21] this verse states
[43:22] ye see then how that by works a man is
[43:25] justified
[43:26] and not by faith only
[43:28] some argue that faith alone is not
[43:30] enough to save a sinner because james
[43:32] writes a man is justified by works and
[43:35] not by faith only
[43:37] reading james chapter 2 in context
[43:40] reveals that james is rebuking dead
[43:42] faith
[43:43] meaning a faith confession that honors
[43:45] god with words only
[43:47] empty words without action reveal an
[43:49] absence of faith
[43:50] james is correct to denounce
[43:52] false professors of faith who spurt out
[43:55] empty vain words
[43:57] his example is a person who gives verbal
[43:59] well wishes to a cold hungry christian
[44:02] but does not give him clothes and food
[44:05] a real faith-filled christian will give
[44:07] a cold hungry christian
[44:09] those things which are needful to the
[44:10] body
[44:12] when understood correctly james's words
[44:14] agree with paul's for genuine faith
[44:17] works by love doing the good works which
[44:20] god hath before ordained that we should
[44:22] walk in them
[44:25] intellectual human faith
[44:27] every human being possesses an
[44:29] intellectual human faith that is
[44:31] different from god's gift of divine
[44:33] saving faith
[44:35] god's saving faith is part of the divine
[44:37] nature the same faith jesus christ
[44:39] possesses
[44:40] christ's faith is added to a christian
[44:42] as a gift just as peter said each
[44:45] character quality must be added to the
[44:46] believer add to your faith virtue paul
[44:50] said he lived by christ's supernatural
[44:52] faith not his own faith
[44:54] galatians 2 verse 20 says i am crucified
[44:57] with christ
[44:58] nevertheless i live yet not i but christ
[45:01] liveth in me and the life which i now
[45:03] live in the flesh i live by the faith of
[45:06] the son of god who loved me and gave
[45:08] himself for me
[45:10] paul had received god's gift of
[45:12] supernatural saving faith a measure of
[45:15] jesus's own faith the faith of the son
[45:17] of god
[45:18] human faith that simply acknowledges
[45:20] truth is not saving faith as proven in
[45:23] hebrews 10 verses 26 and 27
[45:27] for if we sin willfully after that we
[45:30] have received the knowledge of the truth
[45:32] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[45:34] sins
[45:35] but a certain fearful looking for of
[45:37] judgment and fiery indignation which
[45:40] shall devour the adversaries
[45:43] many jews acknowledge jesus as a special
[45:45] messenger from god in jesus's lifetime
[45:49] nicodemus admitted that the sanhedrin
[45:51] council's members knew jesus was from
[45:53] god telling jesus in john 3 verse 2
[45:56] rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[45:58] come from god for no man can do these
[46:00] miracles that thou doest except god be
[46:03] with him
[46:04] just as muslims believe jesus christ is
[46:06] a prophet with human faith the israeli
[46:09] sanhedrin council knew and believed with
[46:11] human faith that jesus was from god but
[46:14] human faith is not sufficient for
[46:16] salvation
[46:17] repentance from sin while trusting in
[46:19] the blood of jesus christ for
[46:20] forgiveness is god's requirement for
[46:23] salvation
[46:24] muslims and other world religions can
[46:26] possess the knowledge of the truth
[46:28] that jesus is the christ and still not
[46:30] be saved
[46:32] fallen angels like humans can genuinely
[46:35] believe in god and still exist in
[46:37] complete rebellion to him
[46:39] james 2 verse 19 states that all fallen
[46:41] angels or devils
[46:43] believe in and tremble at the one god
[46:46] thou believers that there is one god
[46:48] thou doest well the devils also believe
[46:51] and tremble
[46:53] angels have the intellectual capacity to
[46:55] believe in christ while trying to work
[46:57] against him but must obey his every
[46:59] command
[47:00] luke 4 verse 34 records an unclean devil
[47:04] crying out to jesus saying
[47:06] i know thee who thou art the holy one of
[47:08] god. the destiny of all fallen angels is
[47:11] judgment unto annihilation for jude 1
[47:14] verse 6 says
[47:16] and the angels which kept not their
[47:18] first estate but left their own
[47:19] habitation he hath reserved an
[47:22] everlasting chains under darkness unto
[47:25] the judgment of the great day
[47:28] the gift of faith
[47:30] there are two other kinds of faith that
[47:32] must be differentiated from saving faith
[47:35] the gift of faith and the fruit of faith
[47:38] the gift of faith is one of the nine
[47:39] spiritual gifts paul describes in first
[47:42] corinthians chapter 12
[47:43] verses 1-11 see figure 8
[47:47] in the greek a gift or charisma
[47:50] is a favor with which one receives
[47:53] without any merit of his own
[47:55] and grace or gifts denoting
[47:57] extraordinary powers distinguishing
[48:00] certain christians and enabling them to
[48:02] serve the church of christ
[48:04] figure eight the nine spiritual gifts of
[48:06] the holy ghost
[48:07] wisdom knowledge faith healing miracles
[48:11] prophecy discerning of spirits diverse
[48:15] kinds of tongues interpretation of
[48:17] tongues
[48:18] the bible describes the gift of faith as
[48:21] power to move obstacles
[48:23] figuratively described as mountains
[48:25] by speaking god's word according to mark
[48:28] 11 23
[48:29] and 1st corinthians 13 verse 2.
[48:32] two clear bible examples of mountain
[48:34] moving faith include the roman centurion
[48:37] and paul
[48:39] in matthew 8 verses 1 through 13 a roman
[48:42] centurion came to christ for the healing
[48:44] of a sick servant who suffered from
[48:46] paralysis jesus agreed to come to his
[48:49] house and heal the servant but the
[48:51] centurion said he needed to speak the
[48:53] word only for the servant to be healed
[48:55] jesus marveled at the centurion's great
[48:58] faith and said as thou hast believed so
[49:00] be it done unto thee
[49:02] the centurion's great faith in christ
[49:05] spoken from his anointed heart to christ
[49:07] caused the savior to speak the word
[49:09] moving the mountain of paralysis in the
[49:12] selfsame hour
[49:14] while in lystra modern-day turkey
[49:17] paul's gift of faith operated on a
[49:19] crippled man who had never walked
[49:21] acts 14 verse 8 says the crippled man
[49:24] was impotent in his feet but heard paul
[49:27] speaking the holy spirit anointed paul
[49:29] to perceive the had faith to be
[49:32] healed so he said with a loud voice
[49:34] stand upright on thy feet and he leaped
[49:37] and walked how could paul loudly command
[49:39] a man to walk who had never walked
[49:42] through the mountain moving gift of
[49:44] faith
[49:45] in this case the mountain of impotent
[49:47] feet was moved by speaking god's word in
[49:50] faith
[49:51] the gift of faith is different from
[49:53] saving faith because the gift is always
[49:56] present in a person's human spirit from
[49:58] birth
[49:59] figure 9 shows face location in relation
[50:02] to man's three parts
[50:04] on the other hand saving faith only
[50:06] comes upon a believer after genuine
[50:08] repentance from sins
[50:12] god graces every christian and
[50:14] surprisingly
[50:15] even every unbeliever with at least one
[50:18] of these nine spiritual gifts for paul
[50:20] says the manifestation of the spirit is
[50:22] given to every man to profit with all
[50:26] and all these worketh that one and
[50:28] self-same spirit dividing to every man
[50:31] severally as he will some saints have
[50:33] multiple gifts like paul who prophesied
[50:36] had gifts of healing and spoken tongues
[50:40] figure 9 man's three-part being based
[50:43] upon first thessalonians 5 verse 23
[50:47] the human body contains the sinful
[50:49] nature according to romans 7 verses 18
[50:52] through 23. the human spirit or mind
[50:56] receives the anointings and portions of
[50:58] faith virtue knowledge
[51:01] temperance patience godliness broadly
[51:03] kindness
[51:05] the human soul receives charity or the
[51:07] seal of the holy ghost
[51:11] gifts are given to every person as
[51:12] romans 11 verse 29 teaches the gifts and
[51:16] calling of god are without repentance
[51:19] even before a believer repents god has
[51:21] already given him a spiritual gift
[51:24] conversely even if an unbeliever will
[51:26] not repent god has already given him a
[51:28] spiritual gift
[51:30] every spiritual gift is a built-in
[51:32] component and special ability in each
[51:34] person's human spirit
[51:36] gifts can be likened unto the talents
[51:38] that jesus graciously distributes
[51:40] detailed in matthew 25 verses 14 through
[51:44] 30.
[51:45] christians are accountable for investing
[51:47] in their valuable divine abilities like
[51:50] faith
[51:50] given them by jesus
[51:53] although shocking to some six bible
[51:56] texts validate unbelievers possessing
[51:58] gifts of the spirit despite lacking
[52:01] saving faith
[52:02] first second peters 2 verses 15-17
[52:06] teaches balaam's destiny was hell
[52:09] the mist of darkness forever
[52:11] yet he had a gift of prophecy that
[52:12] correctly predicted a star out of jacob
[52:16] would lead the wise men to christ
[52:18] second matthew 10 verses 1 through 15
[52:22] explains how judas iscariot
[52:24] eventually lost to hell as the son of
[52:26] perdition
[52:27] and the 11 other apostles were given
[52:29] gifts of healing
[52:30] when he had called unto him his twelve
[52:32] disciples he gave them power against
[52:34] unclean spirits to cast them out and to
[52:38] heal all manner of sickness and all
[52:40] manner of disease
[52:43] next luke 10 verses 1 1-20 describes
[52:46] jesus's 70 disciples he sent out to
[52:48] cities with power to cast out devils the
[52:51] gift of miracles according to mark 9
[52:54] verses 38 and 39
[52:56] john 6 66 suggests these 70 left christ
[53:00] because his preaching was offensive to
[53:03] them saying
[53:04] from that time many of his disciples
[53:06] went back and walked no more with him
[53:09] the reality of jesus's gifts of healing
[53:11] and miracles was not enough to keep
[53:14] these disciples following christ
[53:16] they walked away from eternal life
[53:18] christ because they were offended by his
[53:20] preaching
[53:22] matthew 7 verses 21-23
[53:25] provides a fourth example
[53:27] jesus sends workers of iniquity to hell
[53:30] because he never knew them and they
[53:32] failed to do the will of god
[53:34] the large lost group of many people also
[53:37] did many wonderful works in jesus name
[53:40] such as prophesying and casting out
[53:42] devils
[53:43] jesus warned us of these false christs
[53:45] and false prophets in matthew 24 24 who
[53:50] temporarily have the anointing of god
[53:52] upon them but live sinfully after
[53:54] operating god's gifts
[53:56] it's crucial christians do not make the
[53:58] ability to repeatedly and correctly
[54:00] operate god's gifts
[54:02] as the evidence of a person's salvation
[54:05] whether the gift is speaking in tongues
[54:07] or performing miracles
[54:10] fifth hebrews 6 verses 1 through 12
[54:13] describes a group who tastes of heavenly
[54:15] gifts and powers but are still lost
[54:18] after initially enjoying god's gifts
[54:20] they become spiritually slothful and
[54:22] fall away unwilling to repent
[54:25] this group treats christ to an open
[54:27] shame or public disgrace by their sinful
[54:30] lives crucifying jesus afresh
[54:34] god's word again uses botany life jesus
[54:37] used wheat and tares in matthew 13 to
[54:39] help readers understand the lost
[54:41] comparing their lives to thorn producing
[54:43] plants
[54:44] the lost produced thorns and briars
[54:47] rather than the holy righteous fruits of
[54:49] the holy
[54:50] spirit finally a sixth example is found
[54:53] in first corinthians 13 verses 1-3 which
[54:57] specifically mentions the gift of faith
[54:59] saying
[55:00] and though i have all faith so that i
[55:02] could remove mountains and have not
[55:04] charity i am nothing
[55:06] you learn that faith is a powerful gift
[55:08] that removes mountains or imposing
[55:10] obstacles
[55:11] but you also understand that exercising
[55:13] the gift of faith without god's love
[55:16] equals spiritual bankruptcy
[55:18] love is the only true and acceptable
[55:20] motivation for trying to do god a
[55:23] service because love empowers faith and
[55:26] living faith produces works
[55:30] the fruit of faith
[55:32] there are nine fruits of the holy spirit
[55:34] taught by paul in galatians 5 verses 16
[55:38] through 23 and seen in figure 10.
[55:41] the nine fruits of the spirit are love
[55:43] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[55:46] goodness
[55:47] faith meekness and temperance
[55:50] the apostle lists 17 sinful works of the
[55:52] flesh to contrast the nine divine fruits
[55:56] faith is the seventh fruit on the list
[55:59] the fruit of faith is the rarest form of
[56:01] faith
[56:02] because it's only manifested in mature
[56:04] seasoned christians
[56:06] anyone sinner or saint can manifest a
[56:09] gift of faith
[56:11] saving faith is more rare than the gift
[56:13] of faith being only present in the few
[56:15] believers jesus said would find the
[56:17] narrow path to eternal life
[56:20] understanding the fruit of the holy
[56:22] spirit comes from examining natural
[56:24] fruit from the earth
[56:26] a ripe apple a natural fruit is the
[56:29] product of an apple seed
[56:31] it takes from six to eight years for the
[56:33] apple seed to grow and mature before it
[56:35] produces substantial fruit
[56:37] spiritual fruit then is a product of the
[56:40] seed word of god according to first
[56:42] peter 1 verse 23
[56:45] being born again not of the corruptable
[56:47] seed but of incorruptible by the word of
[56:50] god which liveth and abideth forever
[56:53] peter symbolizes being born again or the
[56:56] new birth as receiving an incorruptible
[56:59] seed producing fruits of the spirit
[57:01] years later in due time
[57:04] jesus teaches a parable about being
[57:06] patient for fruit to be produced
[57:08] in luke 13 verses 6 through 9 christ's
[57:11] parable tells of a certain man who
[57:14] plants a fig tree in his vineyard but
[57:16] the tree produces no fruit after three
[57:18] years
[57:19] the vine dresser suggests the certain
[57:21] man cut down the fig tree but the
[57:23] merciful patient man decides to leave it
[57:25] alone for another year and fertilize the
[57:28] tree in hopes of fruit in the fourth
[57:30] year
[57:31] christ seems to be symbolizing israel as
[57:33] the fig tree and himself as the certain
[57:36] man because christ's earthly ministry
[57:38] lasted about three and a half years
[57:40] but christians can glean jesus's
[57:42] patience to wait for believers to
[57:44] manifest the fruit of the spirit as paul
[57:47] stresses patience with all men in 1st
[57:49] thessalonians 5 verses 14 and 15.
[57:53] now we exhort you brethren warn them
[57:55] that are unruly comfort the
[57:57] feeble-minded support the weak be
[58:00] patient toward all men
[58:01] see that none render evil for evil unto
[58:04] any man but ever follow that which is
[58:06] good both among yourselves and to all
[58:09] men
[58:11] there is no set amount of time
[58:12] christians must wait to see maturity in
[58:14] each other but fruits of the spirit must
[58:17] and will manifest in all born-again
[58:19] christians
[58:21] spiritual fruit of faith is a mature
[58:23] level of faith
[58:25] fully developed fruit is the goal of
[58:26] christianity as proven by john 15 verses
[58:30] 1 to 16 and matthew 13 verses 3 through
[58:34] 8 and verses 18-23
[58:38] in john 15 christ paints a picture of
[58:40] god the father as a husbandman or farmer
[58:44] himself as the true vine and believers
[58:46] as branches
[58:48] jesus promises that branches who abide
[58:50] in him being kept clean through his word
[58:52] will glorify the father through much
[58:54] fruit bearing
[58:56] pruning is required for all branches as
[58:58] the faithful savior will take away parts
[59:00] of our character that do not produce the
[59:02] fruit of the spirit
[59:04] polishers christians are chosen and
[59:06] ordained to bear fruit that lasts
[59:08] matthew 13 records jesus's teaching that
[59:11] every human heart will culminate in one
[59:13] of four conditions
[59:15] and the only honorable condition is a
[59:17] fruitful heart
[59:18] see chapter 8
[59:20] luke 8 15 a parallel passage describes
[59:24] the fruitful heart as the good ground
[59:26] which is an honest and good heart having
[59:28] heard the word keep it and bring forth
[59:31] fruit with patience
[59:33] john and paul are key examples of mature
[59:36] experienced believers whose faith fruit
[59:38] had fully developed
[59:40] converted to christianity around 34 a.d
[59:43] paul faithfully served god's purpose
[59:45] until his martyrdom in rome in 66 a.d
[59:50] throughout his ministry paul's faith was
[59:52] tested severely by being stoned
[59:55] shipwrecked three times whipped five
[59:57] times beaten with rods suffering
[1:00:00] frequent imprisonments and countless
[1:00:02] perils
[1:00:03] even so paul's faith knew death had lost
[1:00:06] its sting because of christ's victorious
[1:00:08] resurrection and a crown of
[1:00:10] righteousness from the righteous judge
[1:00:13] was laid up for him after death
[1:00:16] after 32 years of ministry the apostle
[1:00:18] was ready to die as a martyr writing
[1:00:21] for i am now ready to be offered and the
[1:00:24] time of my departure is at hand i have
[1:00:26] fought a good fight i have finished my
[1:00:28] course i have kept the faith
[1:00:31] the apostle john the disciple whom jesus
[1:00:34] loved
[1:00:35] followed christ during his three and a
[1:00:36] half year earthly ministry and was born
[1:00:39] again on the day of pentecost in 30 a.d
[1:00:42] john's ministry lasted over 60 years
[1:00:45] writing three epistles
[1:00:47] first second and third john and his
[1:00:49] gospel around 80 a.d before recording
[1:00:52] the book of revelation in 95 a.d john's
[1:00:56] epistles strengthened the saints faith
[1:00:58] by making their joyful
[1:01:00] encouraging abstinence from sin
[1:01:02] stressing avoidance of seducing teachers
[1:01:05] and assuring their possession of eternal
[1:01:07] life through belief in christ the gospel
[1:01:10] of saint john emphasizes the deity
[1:01:13] divine power and pre-existence of jesus
[1:01:16] christ as foundational in the christian
[1:01:18] faith
[1:01:20] john's mature fully developed faith is
[1:01:22] powerfully displayed in the
[1:01:24] circumstances surrounding the writing of
[1:01:26] his final letter the book of revelation
[1:01:29] even at the ripe age of around 80 years
[1:01:31] old john's faith was so evident that
[1:01:34] emperor domitian imprisoned him to the
[1:01:37] isle of patmos
[1:01:38] in the aegean sea for a year and a half
[1:01:41] while banished on the island john's
[1:01:43] faith chose to walk in the spirit rather
[1:01:45] than self-pity and then he received the
[1:01:48] revelation of jesus christ as a result
[1:01:51] of john's faith the book of revelation
[1:01:53] has been called a complete overview of
[1:01:55] theology due to its teachings on sin
[1:01:58] redemption angels demons israel gentiles
[1:02:02] and christ divinity the beauty of
[1:02:04] revelation is that it shows your daily
[1:02:06] choices and actions
[1:02:08] determine which end time events you'll
[1:02:10] experience
[1:02:11] john's mature faith has provided us an
[1:02:14] intimate glorious glimpse of christ's
[1:02:16] plans for the end of human history and
[1:02:19] beginning of the eternal day
[1:02:23] the faith foundation
[1:02:25] much more could be said about faith as
[1:02:27] this crucial subject fills new testament
[1:02:29] scripture being mentioned over 220 times
[1:02:33] as you move on to the second character
[1:02:35] quality rejoice in the rock solid
[1:02:37] foundation of faith god has given you by
[1:02:40] his grace your foundation will hold in
[1:02:42] your greatest temptations just as
[1:02:45] peter's faith held him in his hardest
[1:02:47] trial his denial of christ before the
[1:02:49] crucifixion
[1:02:51] our lord said simon simon behold satan
[1:02:54] hath desired to have you that he may
[1:02:57] sift you as wheat but i have prayed for
[1:02:59] thee that thy faith fail not and when
[1:03:02] thou art converted strengthen thy
[1:03:04] brethren
[1:03:05] jesus's prayer kept peter's faith
[1:03:07] foundation from failing even after
[1:03:09] denying christ three times
[1:03:11] peter didn't commit suicide like judas
[1:03:14] or leave judea as a vagabond like cain
[1:03:16] left god's presence
[1:03:18] rather he hung around until he could
[1:03:20] experience christ's forgiveness because
[1:03:23] he knew there was no other place to go
[1:03:24] for eternal life
[1:03:26] peter said in john 6 68 lord to whom
[1:03:29] shall we go thou hast the words of
[1:03:32] eternal life
[1:03:34] be encouraged that jesus prayed the same
[1:03:36] for you in john 17 verses 20 and 21 for
[1:03:40] you have believed on him through the
[1:03:42] words of his original apostles
[1:03:44] neither pray i for these alone but for
[1:03:47] them also which shall believe on me
[1:03:49] through their word
[1:03:50] that they all may be one as thou father
[1:03:52] art in me and i in thee
[1:03:55] that they also may be one in us that the
[1:03:58] world may believe that thou hast sent me
[1:04:01] since your faith is motivated by love
[1:04:03] your faith foundation will be the rock
[1:04:05] upon which god can build your spiritual
[1:04:08] house the stature of a perfect man
[1:04:11] jesus says therefore whosoever heareth
[1:04:13] the sayings of mine and doeth them i
[1:04:15] will liken him unto a wise man which
[1:04:18] built his house upon a rock and the rain
[1:04:20] descended and the floods came and the
[1:04:23] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[1:04:26] it fell not for it was founded upon a
[1:04:28] rock
[1:04:30] as an overcomer you have rejected
[1:04:32] satan's bait of unbelief and have let
[1:04:35] god add faith to your being what a
[1:04:38] wonderful decision you've chosen god's
[1:04:40] way to heaven by repentance and water
[1:04:42] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[1:04:45] christ the great and wise master builder
[1:04:48] jesus christ is now ready to add his
[1:04:50] next character quality to you
[1:04:53] virtue
[1:04:55] character quality number two virtue
[1:04:58] second peter 1 verse 5 reads and beside
[1:05:01] this giving all diligence add to your
[1:05:04] faith virtue
[1:05:06] the second step on your way to godliness
[1:05:08] is virtue which is a second measure or
[1:05:10] portion of the holy ghost anointing god
[1:05:13] wants to add to your being
[1:05:15] in the greek lexicon virtue is defined
[1:05:17] as a virtuous course of thought feeling
[1:05:20] and action virtue moral goodness and
[1:05:24] moral excellence
[1:05:26] a hebrew definition is strength might
[1:05:29] efficiency
[1:05:31] combining these definitions the bible
[1:05:33] places virtue as the strength to daily
[1:05:35] walk in god's way logically god must
[1:05:39] first give you faith to choose the right
[1:05:40] way to walk and secondly empower you
[1:05:43] with the virtue to daily walk in his
[1:05:46] narrow path
[1:05:48] christians who ask for and receive god's
[1:05:50] virtue must first reject the sin of
[1:05:53] hypocrisy
[1:05:54] the greek definition of hypocrisy is the
[1:05:56] acting of a stage player
[1:05:58] a modern definition is the practice of
[1:06:01] claiming to have moral standards or
[1:06:03] beliefs to which one's own behavior does
[1:06:05] not conform
[1:06:07] jesus witnessed much hypocrisy during
[1:06:09] his earthly ministry calling out the
[1:06:11] scribes and pharisees in matthew 23
[1:06:14] verse 25 and verse 28 for presenting a
[1:06:18] false moral strength to the public
[1:06:20] christ says woe unto you scribes and
[1:06:22] pharisees hypocrites for you may clean
[1:06:25] the outside of the cup and of the
[1:06:27] platter but within they are full of
[1:06:29] extortion and excess
[1:06:31] even so ye also outwardly appear
[1:06:33] righteous unto men but within ye are
[1:06:36] full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:06:39] virtue is power to consistently live out
[1:06:41] your faith for christ publicly and
[1:06:43] privately before family co-workers
[1:06:46] friends and strangers
[1:06:48] in matthew 10 verses 32 through 42 jesus
[1:06:52] requires that all believers confess him
[1:06:54] before men and their families saying
[1:06:57] for i am come to set a man at variance
[1:07:00] against his father and the daughter
[1:07:02] against her mother and the
[1:07:03] daughter-in-law against her
[1:07:04] mother-in-law and a man's foe shall be
[1:07:07] they of his own household he that loveth
[1:07:09] father or mother more than me is not
[1:07:12] worthy of me and he that love his son or
[1:07:14] daughter more than me is not worthy of
[1:07:16] me
[1:07:18] since jesus requirement is public and
[1:07:20] private confession of his great name he
[1:07:23] provides the anointing of virtue to all
[1:07:25] believers
[1:07:28] examples of virtuous bible characters
[1:07:31] ruth from the old testament is a shining
[1:07:33] example of virtue
[1:07:35] boaz the wealthy bethlehemite lord of
[1:07:38] the harvest was kinsmen to malan roof's
[1:07:41] first husband who died without any
[1:07:44] children to carry on his name
[1:07:46] ruth laid at boaz's feet initiating him
[1:07:49] to claim his right to be her kinsmen
[1:07:50] redeemer and fulfilled deuteronomy 25
[1:07:54] verses through 10 and boaz quickly
[1:07:57] promised to marry her
[1:07:58] ruth 3 verse 11 expresses boaz's
[1:08:02] confidence in ruth's virtue known to the
[1:08:05] entire city
[1:08:06] and now my daughter fear not i will do
[1:08:09] to thee all that thou require us for all
[1:08:11] the city of my people doth know that
[1:08:13] thou art a virtuous woman
[1:08:15] when a believer has divine virtue he can
[1:08:18] live out his faith at all times and in
[1:08:20] all public settings
[1:08:22] boaz further pointed out that ruth could
[1:08:24] have followed a younger man rich or poor
[1:08:26] to attempt having children but she
[1:08:28] instead chose to honor god's kinsmen
[1:08:31] requirement temptations ran rampant in
[1:08:34] ruth's life just as in your life but her
[1:08:37] virtue empowered her to overcome every
[1:08:39] test
[1:08:40] righteous ruth's testimony proclaims the
[1:08:43] power or virtue to obey god's word
[1:08:46] publicly despite financial and sensual
[1:08:48] temptations
[1:08:51] solomon offers further examples of
[1:08:53] virtue in proverbs 31 verses 10 through
[1:08:56] 31 focusing on virtuous women
[1:08:59] above all solomon says a virtuous woman
[1:09:01] possesses the fear of the lord promising
[1:09:04] she shall be praised wisdom is the
[1:09:06] result of godly fear according to
[1:09:08] proverbs 9 verse 10
[1:09:10] the fear of the lord is the beginning of
[1:09:12] wisdom
[1:09:13] therefore
[1:09:14] virtuous women make wise decisions in
[1:09:16] motherhood personal finances and
[1:09:19] business deals
[1:09:21] a virtuous woman is trustworthy the
[1:09:23] heart of her husband does safely trust
[1:09:25] in her a virtuous woman is busy meeting
[1:09:28] everyone's needs and eateth not the
[1:09:30] bread of idleness
[1:09:32] she is spiritually clothed with strength
[1:09:34] and honor as she serves her family both
[1:09:37] inside and outside the home
[1:09:39] as seen in ruth's example solomon agrees
[1:09:42] that a virtuous woman's value is great
[1:09:44] her price is far above ruby's
[1:09:48] the prophet daniel is an example of a
[1:09:50] virtuous man
[1:09:51] he was so dedicated to god that his
[1:09:54] coworkers could not find one thing wrong
[1:09:56] with his work
[1:09:57] which made them concoct a devious plan
[1:10:00] to entrap him into breaking a new law
[1:10:02] they wrote themselves forbidding prayer
[1:10:04] to his god jehovah in daniel chapter 6.
[1:10:09] daniel's inner virtue or strength led
[1:10:11] him to continue his three daily prayers
[1:10:13] without hesitation although he knew the
[1:10:16] law and his consequences
[1:10:18] daniel's virtue amidst his arrest and
[1:10:20] sentence to be thrown into a den of
[1:10:22] hungry lions caused god to send an angel
[1:10:26] to shut the lion's mouths securing
[1:10:28] daniel's deliverance this is the power
[1:10:31] of divine virtue public strength to do
[1:10:33] what is right in god's sight even when
[1:10:36] you know you will suffer
[1:10:39] jesus's examples of virtue
[1:10:42] jesus's teachings in matthew chapters 5
[1:10:44] and 6 contain simple concrete examples
[1:10:47] of how christians can manifest virtue in
[1:10:50] both public and private settings
[1:10:53] in these settings divine virtue is
[1:10:55] needed for spur-of-the-moment public
[1:10:57] requests as well as planned out private
[1:11:00] giving
[1:11:01] in matthew 5 verses 38 through 42 christ
[1:11:05] teaches four virtuous responses to
[1:11:07] public trouble and surprising or
[1:11:10] unplanned requests
[1:11:11] first if you're smitten on the right
[1:11:13] cheek let your enemy smite your left
[1:11:15] cheek
[1:11:16] second if you're sued in court for your
[1:11:19] coat or undergarment give your adversary
[1:11:22] your cloak or outer garment as well
[1:11:25] third if you're compelled to carry
[1:11:26] someone's message for a mile be willing
[1:11:29] to go two miles
[1:11:30] fourth give to those who ask for your
[1:11:33] possessions and be willing to let others
[1:11:35] borrow them
[1:11:37] in matthew 6 verses 1 through 4 jesus
[1:11:40] teaches about almsgiving in private
[1:11:43] our lord encourages believers to take
[1:11:45] heed or pay special attention to giving
[1:11:47] alms or charity in secret and not before
[1:11:50] men
[1:11:51] jesus knows it takes his virtue to give
[1:11:54] in secret christ says therefore when
[1:11:57] thou doest thine alms do not sound a
[1:11:59] trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do
[1:12:02] in the synagogues and in the streets
[1:12:04] that they may have glory of men verily i
[1:12:06] say unto you they have their reward
[1:12:10] recall hypocrisy is the sin that must be
[1:12:12] rejected in order to receive god's
[1:12:14] virtue
[1:12:16] true almsgiving can only be done with
[1:12:18] the virtue anointing
[1:12:20] with jesus virtue you will not seek
[1:12:22] glory of men but glory of your heavenly
[1:12:25] father
[1:12:27] jesus's healing virtue
[1:12:30] jesus's healing virtue must be
[1:12:31] differentiated from divine virtue
[1:12:34] healing virtue is synonymous with a gift
[1:12:36] of healing and is different from the
[1:12:38] second character quality peter describes
[1:12:40] in the stature of a perfect man
[1:12:43] mark 5 verses 25-30 and luke 6 verses
[1:12:47] 18-19
[1:12:48] detail jesus's healing virtue
[1:12:50] in both cases sick people were healed
[1:12:53] after touching jesus
[1:12:55] scripture says
[1:12:56] and the whole multitude sought to touch
[1:12:58] him for there went virtue out of him and
[1:13:00] healed them all
[1:13:02] one woman with an issue of blood for 12
[1:13:04] years touched jesus's garment and
[1:13:06] instantly felt in her body that she was
[1:13:09] healed of that plague
[1:13:11] the heavenly father had not previously
[1:13:13] told his son about this encounter so
[1:13:16] christ was surprised to feel his healing
[1:13:18] power flow out of his spirit into the
[1:13:20] sick woman
[1:13:22] he turned around and said who touched my
[1:13:24] clothes
[1:13:25] when she heard his request she humbly
[1:13:27] came before the savior and he honored
[1:13:29] her faith saying daughter thy faith hath
[1:13:32] made thee whole go in peace and be whole
[1:13:35] of thy plague
[1:13:37] healing virtue is not given to every
[1:13:39] christian just as the other eight gifts
[1:13:41] are given at god's choosing not ours
[1:13:45] paul plainly states that not everyone
[1:13:47] has every spiritual gift in first
[1:13:49] corinthians 12 verses 29 and 30.
[1:13:52] are all apostles are all prophets are
[1:13:55] all teachers are all workers of miracles
[1:13:58] have all the gifts of healing do all
[1:14:00] speak with tongues do all interpret
[1:14:04] it would be erroneous to say every
[1:14:05] christian is an apostle or missionary if
[1:14:08] that was true there would be no need of
[1:14:10] local pastors because each missionary
[1:14:12] would be traveling to spread the faith
[1:14:14] similarly if everyone spoke in unknown
[1:14:17] tongues there would be no interpreters
[1:14:19] to make known the meaning of the unknown
[1:14:21] tongues
[1:14:22] rejoice in jesus's healing virtue and
[1:14:25] those who have that gift today but do
[1:14:27] not confuse the spiritual gift of
[1:14:29] healing with a second character quality
[1:14:31] of virtue
[1:14:32] you do not need to have healing virtue
[1:14:34] the gift of healing in order to be
[1:14:36] virtuous
[1:14:38] you will have healing virtue only if god
[1:14:40] has ordained a healing ministry for your
[1:14:42] life
[1:14:45] peter's loss and restoration of virtue
[1:14:48] peter god's chosen author of the stature
[1:14:51] of a perfect man
[1:14:52] is a prime example of gaining virtue
[1:14:55] losing it then gaining it again with no
[1:14:58] worry of losing it
[1:15:01] examining peter's life mark 1 verses 14
[1:15:04] through 18 shows that peter received
[1:15:06] faith the first character quality of
[1:15:08] christ when he repented and began
[1:15:10] following jesus
[1:15:12] as christ's first sermons dealt with
[1:15:14] repentance
[1:15:15] john 4 verses 1 and 2 records that peter
[1:15:18] and jesus disciples baptized new
[1:15:21] believers but jesus did no baptizing
[1:15:24] peter must have been baptized after his
[1:15:26] repentance as peter would not be
[1:15:28] permitted to baptize others unless he
[1:15:31] himself had been baptized
[1:15:34] shortly afterwards peter received the
[1:15:35] character quality of virtue because he
[1:15:38] publicly preached christ in his hometown
[1:15:40] and other cities
[1:15:42] matthew 11 verse 1 says and it came to
[1:15:45] pass when jesus had made an end of
[1:15:47] commanding his twelve disciples
[1:15:49] he departed thence to teach and to
[1:15:51] preach in their cities
[1:15:54] luke 9 verses 1 through 6 says jesus
[1:15:57] gave peter and the apostles power and
[1:15:59] authority over all devils and to cure
[1:16:02] diseases and they went through the towns
[1:16:04] preaching the gospel and healing
[1:16:06] everywhere
[1:16:08] peter's virtue strengthened him to
[1:16:10] unashamedly declare jesus's gospel
[1:16:13] publicly in his hometown
[1:16:16] sadly a few years later peter lost his
[1:16:19] virtue when he denied christ three times
[1:16:21] on the night before the crucifixion
[1:16:24] due to the threat of arrest or
[1:16:26] imprisonment peter let fear come over
[1:16:29] him and the adversary spoiled his virtue
[1:16:32] when confronted by a maid and a crowd
[1:16:34] who associated him with jesus
[1:16:36] scripture says peter began to curse and
[1:16:39] to swear saying i know not the man
[1:16:42] and immediately the crew and peter
[1:16:44] remembered the word of jesus which said
[1:16:47] unto him before the crow thou shalt
[1:16:50] deny me thrice and he went out and wept
[1:16:52] bitterly
[1:16:54] how could a man that walked on water had
[1:16:56] the keys of the kingdom had preached and
[1:16:58] healed in cities for christ's sake and
[1:17:01] known jesus for over three years deny
[1:17:03] him
[1:17:04] the evil spirit of fear that robs
[1:17:06] believers of their power had overcome
[1:17:08] peter in this temptation
[1:17:11] second timothy 1 verse 7 says for god
[1:17:14] hath not given us the spirit of fear but
[1:17:16] a power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:17:20] despite losing his virtue peter never
[1:17:23] lost his faith foundation because jesus
[1:17:25] interceded in prayer for him prior to
[1:17:28] peter's three denials luke 22 verses
[1:17:31] 31-32 reads and the lord said simon
[1:17:34] simon behold satan hath desired to have
[1:17:37] you that he may sift you as wheat but i
[1:17:40] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[1:17:43] and when thou art converted strengthen
[1:17:45] thy brethren
[1:17:46] how marvelous and strong are the prayers
[1:17:49] of jesus
[1:17:50] despite jesus's warning peter pridefully
[1:17:53] declared lord i am ready to go with thee
[1:17:55] both into prison and to death
[1:17:58] this boasts was proven untrue within a
[1:18:01] matter of hours
[1:18:02] but jesus's prayer kept peter from
[1:18:04] permanently falling away from his faith
[1:18:07] unlike judas iscariot
[1:18:10] god's rich mercy restored peter's virtue
[1:18:13] during the 50-day period from the
[1:18:14] passover christ's crucifixion to the day
[1:18:17] of pentecost
[1:18:19] jesus showed himself alive to peter on
[1:18:21] multiple occasions giving both peter and
[1:18:24] the apostles many infallible proofs of
[1:18:27] the resurrection
[1:18:28] then on the day of pentecost peter is
[1:18:31] one of the 120 who received the baptism
[1:18:34] of the holy ghost the promise of the
[1:18:36] father
[1:18:37] empowering him never to deny christ
[1:18:39] again the book of acts records multiple
[1:18:42] examples of peter being threatened and
[1:18:44] imprisoned for christ and each time he
[1:18:46] displayed unwavering virtue to publicly
[1:18:49] witness jesus resurrection without
[1:18:52] recanting the difference in peter's life
[1:18:54] was that virtue knowledge temperance
[1:18:56] patience godliness and broly kindness
[1:18:59] had all been added to his faith and
[1:19:01] sealed into him by the baptism of the
[1:19:03] holy ghost
[1:19:05] after being born again peter never lost
[1:19:07] his virtue again because it was sealed
[1:19:09] into him
[1:19:12] gaining and losing the character
[1:19:13] qualities
[1:19:14] failing grace
[1:19:16] peter's virtue example reveals people
[1:19:19] can gain and lose god's character
[1:19:21] qualities
[1:19:22] known as failing or despising grace
[1:19:25] peter was saved of course regaining his
[1:19:27] virtue and being a holy ghost-filled
[1:19:29] christian after pentecost but judas is
[1:19:32] scary it was lost for he never regained
[1:19:34] the virtue he once had after selling out
[1:19:37] christ
[1:19:38] the spiritual life of judas's scare
[1:19:40] requires an in-depth study
[1:19:42] judas temporarily received christ's
[1:19:45] character qualities
[1:19:46] walking in the anointing of god's spirit
[1:19:48] for nearly three years before deciding
[1:19:50] to betray jesus
[1:19:52] and be filled with satan's spirit
[1:19:54] luke 22 3 says then entered satan into
[1:19:58] judas and john 13 verse 27 says and
[1:20:02] after the soph satan entered into him
[1:20:04] judas's life had an eternally sad ending
[1:20:09] judas's ministry started correctly
[1:20:11] after all night prayer in luke 6 verses
[1:20:14] 12 through 16
[1:20:16] jesus called judas iscariot and the 11
[1:20:19] other disciples to be his apostles
[1:20:22] john 4 verses 1 and 2 tells us jesus
[1:20:24] apostles baptized new believers which
[1:20:26] proves judas must have first confessed
[1:20:28] his faith in jesus as messiah and been
[1:20:32] baptized before he would be ordained to
[1:20:34] baptize others
[1:20:36] judas received faith in christ believing
[1:20:39] just as strongly as the other eleven
[1:20:41] apostles as he witnessed jesus miracles
[1:20:44] for john 2 verse 11 says this beginning
[1:20:47] of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee
[1:20:50] and manifested forth his glory and his
[1:20:53] disciples believed on him
[1:20:57] as one of jesus's twelve apostles judas
[1:20:59] was sent out with the same supernatural
[1:21:01] commission from the lips of christ
[1:21:03] himself with
[1:21:05] power against unclean spirits to cast
[1:21:07] them out and to heal all manner of
[1:21:09] sickness and all manner of disease
[1:21:12] judas no doubt experienced god's power
[1:21:15] and anointing to do miracles and was
[1:21:17] faithful to his calling for nearly three
[1:21:20] years
[1:21:20] after judas death the apostles even bore
[1:21:23] witness of judas's ministry apostleship
[1:21:27] and bishopric in acts 1 verses 15-26
[1:21:32] peter said judas obtained part of this
[1:21:34] ministry but fell by transgression from
[1:21:37] it judas possessed some of the divine
[1:21:39] character qualities but departed from or
[1:21:42] abandoned them for monetary gain
[1:21:45] jesus did not cast away judas judas cast
[1:21:48] away jesus and his divine nature
[1:21:51] john 6 34 declares jesus's promise to
[1:21:54] not cast away anyone who comes to him
[1:21:57] all that the father giveth me shall come
[1:21:59] to me and him that cometh to me i will
[1:22:02] in no wise cast out
[1:22:05] apparently judas lived a relatively
[1:22:08] clean obedient life to christ command
[1:22:10] throughout jesus's three-year ministry
[1:22:13] as evidenced on the night judas betrayed
[1:22:15] jesus
[1:22:17] during the passover supper jesus shared
[1:22:19] that one of his disciples would betray
[1:22:21] him
[1:22:22] notice none of the apostles instantly
[1:22:24] pointed at judas and said
[1:22:26] judas has been a devil all along we
[1:22:28] always knew he'd betrayed jesus
[1:22:30] in fact each disciple became exceedingly
[1:22:33] sorrowful and asked jesus one by one if
[1:22:36] he would be the betrayer
[1:22:38] when it came to judas's turn matthew 26
[1:22:42] 25 records then judas which betrayed him
[1:22:45] answered and said master is it i he said
[1:22:48] unto him thou hast said
[1:22:51] there was a moment judas's spiritual
[1:22:53] weakness was seen before his final
[1:22:55] betrayal of christ for thirty pieces of
[1:22:58] silver six days before he betrayed
[1:23:00] christ judas disdained lazarus sister
[1:23:03] mary for anointing jesus's feet with
[1:23:06] very costly spikenard in order for his
[1:23:09] burial
[1:23:10] john 12 verses 5-8 records judas's
[1:23:13] complaint about and jesus's protection
[1:23:16] of mary
[1:23:17] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[1:23:20] pence and given to the poor
[1:23:22] this he said not that he cared for the
[1:23:24] poor but because he was a thief and had
[1:23:27] the bag and bear what was put therein
[1:23:30] then jesus said let her alone
[1:23:33] against the day of my bearing has she
[1:23:35] kept this
[1:23:36] for the poor always ye have with you
[1:23:39] but me ye have not always
[1:23:42] it's implied from john 12 6 that judas
[1:23:45] was stealing money from jesus's ministry
[1:23:48] throughout his time as jesus's treasurer
[1:23:51] but he kept his secret sin from being
[1:23:53] discovered by the other apostles
[1:23:55] only god knows how much and how often he
[1:23:58] stole from our lord's money
[1:24:01] according to jesus many not few
[1:24:04] follow judas's pattern of selling out
[1:24:06] the gospel for worldly lusts
[1:24:08] matthew 7 verses 21-23 contains jesus's
[1:24:13] exact description of the many judas like
[1:24:16] churchgoers who temporarily receive
[1:24:18] god's anointing but then reject it for a
[1:24:21] life of iniquity or wicked living
[1:24:24] not everyone that sayeth unto me lord
[1:24:26] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:24:28] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[1:24:30] father which is in heaven
[1:24:32] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:24:34] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:24:37] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:24:39] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:24:42] and then i will profess unto them i
[1:24:44] never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:24:47] work iniquity
[1:24:49] choose to be one of the few saved
[1:24:51] christians who walks the narrow road of
[1:24:53] holiness leading to eternal life
[1:24:57] six texts support the truth that many
[1:24:59] will be like judas temporarily receiving
[1:25:02] the character qualities of christ but
[1:25:04] will ultimately reject them and be
[1:25:05] damned on judgment day
[1:25:08] matthew 12 verses 29 through 30 and
[1:25:11] verses 43-45
[1:25:13] luke 8 verses 1-18
[1:25:16] hebrews 3 verses
[1:25:18] 7 through chapter 4 verse 16.
[1:25:21] hebrews 6 verses 1-12
[1:25:24] hebrews 10 verses 19 through 39 and 2
[1:25:28] peter 2 verses 19 through 22
[1:25:32] matthew 12 verses 29 through 30 and
[1:25:35] verses 43 through 45
[1:25:38] illustrate a man as a house that is
[1:25:40] filled with good things or god's
[1:25:42] spiritual character qualities such as
[1:25:44] faith and virtue
[1:25:46] the only way this person can be
[1:25:47] demon-possessed is if he lets a demon
[1:25:50] bind him allowing the demons to spoil
[1:25:53] his house this means the man stops
[1:25:55] obeying god's word and submits to the
[1:25:57] will of demons
[1:25:59] the goods the man once had perhaps faith
[1:26:02] and virtue are taken away
[1:26:04] meaning the man no longer has those
[1:26:06] divine attributes of god jesus gives
[1:26:08] more detail about this spiritual robbery
[1:26:11] in verses
[1:26:12] 43-45 saying demons that are cast out of
[1:26:15] a man
[1:26:16] will get help from seven other demons
[1:26:19] and return to the man to enter in and
[1:26:21] dwell there making the last state of
[1:26:24] that man worse than the first
[1:26:26] this is what happened to judas he began
[1:26:29] as a clean house but eventually he was
[1:26:31] deceived into betraying christ and satan
[1:26:34] himself
[1:26:35] not eight demons
[1:26:37] entered into him on passover night
[1:26:39] friend your three-part being body spirit
[1:26:43] soul is a battlefield that you must
[1:26:45] daily fight for and conquer through
[1:26:47] obedience to the holy ghost
[1:26:50] luke 8 verses 1 through 18
[1:26:53] records jesus's parable of the sower and
[1:26:56] the seed sown represents the word of god
[1:27:00] the four grounds represent four kinds of
[1:27:02] hearts that hear the word the second
[1:27:05] rocky ground receives the word and for a
[1:27:08] while believes but eventually falls away
[1:27:11] in a time of temptation
[1:27:13] in the parallel passage in matthew 13
[1:27:15] verse 21 christ says this person deareth
[1:27:18] for a while
[1:27:20] which in the greek means he believes for
[1:27:21] a season
[1:27:23] enduring only for a while temporarily
[1:27:26] people can genuinely possess the seed
[1:27:28] word of divine faith for a while and
[1:27:30] then forsake it deserting and
[1:27:32] withdrawing into death
[1:27:34] destruction in hell
[1:27:37] hebrews 3 verses 7
[1:27:40] through chapter 4 verse 16
[1:27:42] is an extensive passage that provides a
[1:27:44] powerful and crucial illustration of
[1:27:48] gaining and losing spiritual character
[1:27:50] qualities
[1:27:51] the hebrews author most likely paul
[1:27:54] uses israel's exodus out of egypt and
[1:27:57] journeyed to possess the promised land
[1:27:59] as an allegory of the new testament
[1:28:01] christians journey from faith to charity
[1:28:05] figure 11 shows the three stages of
[1:28:07] israel's journey as allegorical to the
[1:28:10] christians three-stage journey to the
[1:28:12] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:14] the text teaches the israeli hearts were
[1:28:16] soft in the first stage but became
[1:28:19] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:28:20] sin during the wilderness testing or
[1:28:23] second stage
[1:28:25] jeremiah 2 verse 2 adds to this saying
[1:28:28] that israel loved god when they went
[1:28:30] after him in the wilderness
[1:28:32] hebrews 3 verse 14 states there are
[1:28:34] conditions to every promise of god
[1:28:36] saying
[1:28:37] for we are made partakers of christ if
[1:28:40] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[1:28:42] steadfast unto the end
[1:28:45] if believers keep believing god's word
[1:28:47] and faithfully serve jesus they will
[1:28:49] enter into his rest the third stage the
[1:28:52] soul rest or the baptism of the holy
[1:28:55] ghost jesus spoke of in matthew 11 verse
[1:28:58] 29 and john 7 verses 37-39
[1:29:03] deuteronomy 3 verse 20 says possessing
[1:29:06] the promised land is israel's rest
[1:29:09] the israeli souls who died in the
[1:29:10] wilderness had gained many miles in
[1:29:12] their journey but lost many benefits
[1:29:15] when unbelief ruled their hearts
[1:29:18] doubting they could possess canaan due
[1:29:19] to the evil report of the ten spies
[1:29:22] in numbers 13 verse 31 through numbers
[1:29:25] chapter 14 verse 3.
[1:29:28] figure 11 israel's three stages are a
[1:29:31] type of the new christians journey
[1:29:33] through the three works of grace
[1:29:35] stage one is justification by faith
[1:29:38] in this stage israel exited egypt and
[1:29:41] crossed the red sea waters
[1:29:43] the new testament christians first stage
[1:29:45] is repentance and water baptism
[1:29:48] israel's second stage was sanctification
[1:29:51] and was their wilderness testing
[1:29:53] the new testament christians second
[1:29:55] stage is sanctification of the spirit
[1:29:58] the cleansing of heart and mind and
[1:30:00] daily habits
[1:30:02] israel's third stage was possessing
[1:30:04] canaan
[1:30:05] the new testament christian's third
[1:30:06] stage is the spiritual rest of the
[1:30:09] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:12] in hebrews 6 verses 1 through 12 the
[1:30:14] author again illustrates the christian
[1:30:16] life as a journey saying believers leave
[1:30:19] or are sent forth from the introductory
[1:30:22] principles of the doctrine of christ and
[1:30:24] go on unto perfection by god's
[1:30:26] permission
[1:30:28] the text affirms that it's impossible
[1:30:30] for one who falls away from faith to be
[1:30:32] renewed again unto repentance
[1:30:35] notice the one who fell away did indeed
[1:30:37] repent at one time meaning he had faith
[1:30:41] mark 1 verse 15 teaches faith or belief
[1:30:44] comes at repentance
[1:30:46] what did the person fall away from
[1:30:48] the text says the person was enlightened
[1:30:51] by the holy spirit tasted of the
[1:30:53] heavenly gift and was made a partaker of
[1:30:56] the holy ghost
[1:30:57] judas iscariot is again our prime
[1:31:00] example of one who fell away despite
[1:31:02] being enlightened by the messiah tasting
[1:31:05] the heavenly gifts of healing and
[1:31:06] miracles and partaking of the holy ghost
[1:31:09] anointed ministry given to him by christ
[1:31:13] judas put christ to an open shame
[1:31:15] publicly betraying him with a kiss
[1:31:18] that led to his arrest and crucifixion
[1:31:21] judas partook of heavenly gifts even
[1:31:23] tasting the good word of god and the
[1:31:25] powers of the world to come but fell
[1:31:28] away from them
[1:31:29] believers are urged to show the same
[1:31:31] diligence to the full assurance of hope
[1:31:34] unto the end that ye be not slawful but
[1:31:37] followers of them who through faith and
[1:31:39] patience inherit the promises
[1:31:42] just like peter twice emphasized
[1:31:44] diligence in 2 peter 1 verse 5 and verse
[1:31:47] 10 the hebrews author says diligence is
[1:31:50] required to finish the christian journey
[1:31:53] and inherit god's promises
[1:31:56] two more scriptures show many people
[1:31:58] will fall away from faith in the last
[1:31:59] days
[1:32:00] in second timothy 3 verses 1 through 7
[1:32:03] paul declares the last days will be
[1:32:05] perilous times in which men will be
[1:32:07] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[1:32:09] god
[1:32:10] the apostle further writes in 2
[1:32:12] thessalonians 2 3
[1:32:14] the man of sin
[1:32:16] or person of the antichrist can be
[1:32:18] revealed only after a great falling away
[1:32:21] or apostasy from the christian faith
[1:32:24] sinners who never know the way of
[1:32:26] righteousness cannot fall away from
[1:32:27] faith
[1:32:28] as taught in ii peter 2 verse 21
[1:32:32] only believers with faith can fall away
[1:32:34] from christianity and bible prophecy
[1:32:37] says your day is a perilous dangerous
[1:32:40] time to live in when many will forsake
[1:32:42] truth
[1:32:43] we must be fortified with the full armor
[1:32:45] of god praying always with all prayer
[1:32:48] and supplication in the spirit
[1:32:50] and watching there unto with all
[1:32:51] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:32:54] saints if we expect to withstand this
[1:32:57] evil day
[1:33:00] another hebrews text chapter 10 verses
[1:33:03] 19-39
[1:33:05] shows how people can draw back unto
[1:33:07] perdition or lose their confession of
[1:33:09] eternal life not believing to the saving
[1:33:12] of the soul
[1:33:13] in the greek drawback means retreating
[1:33:15] or shrinking back on the narrow road to
[1:33:18] eternal life you choose one of three
[1:33:20] options
[1:33:21] finishing the journey in strength
[1:33:23] becoming idle by staying in one place
[1:33:26] or retreating from the narrow road to
[1:33:28] the broad road
[1:33:29] this hebrews text begins with the
[1:33:31] reality of our prayerful approach to
[1:33:33] god's heavenly throne through a true
[1:33:35] heart in full assurance of faith
[1:33:38] after a command to assemble more with
[1:33:40] christians as christ's return approaches
[1:33:43] verses 26 and 29 detail how sinning
[1:33:46] willfully on purpose
[1:33:48] after knowing truth
[1:33:50] is grounds for sore punishment from god
[1:33:53] verse 29 emphatically declares of how
[1:33:56] much sore punishment suppose ye
[1:33:58] shall he be thought worthy who hath
[1:34:00] trodden underfoot the son of god and
[1:34:03] hath counted the blood of the covenant
[1:34:05] wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[1:34:07] thing and hath done despite under the
[1:34:09] spirit of grace
[1:34:11] the main phrase to notice is wherewith
[1:34:13] he was sanctified proving a person can
[1:34:15] be genuinely sanctified meaning
[1:34:18] separated from profane things and
[1:34:20] dedicated to god in the greek
[1:34:22] and yet retreat from the spiritual
[1:34:24] condition and be lost
[1:34:27] reference figure 11 and recall
[1:34:29] sanctification is the second stage of a
[1:34:31] christian's journey to the baptism of
[1:34:33] the holy ghost
[1:34:35] just as all israel came to kedish barnea
[1:34:38] the border of the promised land or third
[1:34:40] stage of their journey
[1:34:42] and provoked god by rejecting his
[1:34:44] leadership to possess canaan
[1:34:46] people journey through the first two
[1:34:48] stages of the christian journey
[1:34:49] justification and sanctification
[1:34:52] and provoke god drawing back into a
[1:34:54] sinful lifestyle without being born
[1:34:57] again by the holy ghost
[1:34:59] verses 38 and 39 are a beautiful
[1:35:02] encouraging conclusion to this text
[1:35:04] saying
[1:35:05] now the just shall live by faith but if
[1:35:08] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[1:35:10] pleasure in him
[1:35:11] but we are not of them who draw back
[1:35:13] unto perdition but of them that believe
[1:35:16] to the saving of the soul
[1:35:19] figure 12 shows how the three-stage
[1:35:21] journey matches the stature of a perfect
[1:35:23] man
[1:35:24] faith is the character quality you
[1:35:26] receive when you are justified
[1:35:28] during sanctification god gives you the
[1:35:30] character qualities of virtue knowledge
[1:35:33] temperance patience godliness and
[1:35:35] brotherly kindness
[1:35:37] the third stage is when charity the love
[1:35:39] of god or god's spirit baptizes your
[1:35:42] soul into the kingdom of god as a seal
[1:35:45] unto the day of your redemption
[1:35:47] figure 12
[1:35:49] three stages and the stature of a
[1:35:51] perfect man
[1:35:52] first stage justification
[1:35:54] the christian receives faith
[1:35:57] second stage sanctification the
[1:35:59] christian receives virtue knowledge
[1:36:02] temperance patience godliness and
[1:36:04] brotherly kindness
[1:36:06] third stage the baptism of the holy
[1:36:08] ghost the christian receives charity
[1:36:12] the sixth and final text is second peter
[1:36:14] 2 verses 19-22
[1:36:17] in which peter teaches people can escape
[1:36:20] the pollutions of the world through the
[1:36:22] knowledge of the lord and savior jesus
[1:36:24] christ but become again entangled
[1:36:27] therein
[1:36:28] and overcome back into their corrupt
[1:36:30] lifestyle
[1:36:31] peter compares this backslider to a pig
[1:36:34] or sow that can be washed and made clean
[1:36:37] but then return to wallow in the mire
[1:36:40] jesus says the only way to be clean is
[1:36:42] through his word in john 15 3
[1:36:45] now are ye clean through the word which
[1:36:47] i have spoken unto you
[1:36:49] a soul-like person can indeed receive
[1:36:51] god's word and be washed with his divine
[1:36:54] character traits temporarily only to
[1:36:56] forsake them later returning to a sin
[1:36:59] addicted lifestyle
[1:37:02] the example of the saved thief on the
[1:37:04] cross shows how swiftly you can gain the
[1:37:06] character qualities of god
[1:37:08] most know the thief on jesus's right
[1:37:10] hand was saved because christ told him
[1:37:12] verily i say unto thee today shalt thou
[1:37:15] be with me in paradise
[1:37:17] but few people know that the saved thief
[1:37:19] was initially mocking and reviling jesus
[1:37:22] along with passers-by
[1:37:24] chief priests scribes and elders
[1:37:27] matthew 27 verse 44 reads the thieves
[1:37:30] also which were crucified with him cast
[1:37:33] the same in his teeth
[1:37:35] at some point during their hours on the
[1:37:37] cross together the saved thief received
[1:37:39] faith and enough virtue to publicly
[1:37:42] stand for christ's innocence and plead
[1:37:44] for eternal life
[1:37:46] he also rebuked the lost thief saying
[1:37:49] dost not thou fear god seeing thou art
[1:37:52] in the same condemnation
[1:37:54] and we indeed justly for we receive the
[1:37:56] dew reward of our deeds but this man
[1:37:58] hath done nothing amiss
[1:38:00] and he said unto jesus lord remember me
[1:38:03] when thou cometh into thy kingdom
[1:38:06] the lesson is jesus will quickly and
[1:38:08] faithfully pardon all those who glory in
[1:38:11] his sinlessness and humbly plead for
[1:38:13] eternal life
[1:38:16] recognizing or weighing a lack of
[1:38:19] character
[1:38:21] jesus christ recognized a lack of divine
[1:38:23] character in the rich young ruler
[1:38:26] recorded in three gospels matthew 19
[1:38:29] verses 16 through 30
[1:38:31] mark 10 verses 17 through 31 and luke 18
[1:38:35] verses 18 through 30.
[1:38:37] mark 10 21 says jesus loved this young
[1:38:40] man for he had kept all six of the
[1:38:42] commandments christ listed from his
[1:38:44] childhood ten commandments five through
[1:38:47] nine plus leviticus 19 verse 18.
[1:38:50] what a rare specimen of obedience
[1:38:53] his sincerity was apparent because he
[1:38:56] came running not walking
[1:38:58] and kneeling before christ
[1:39:00] yet despite all this the man knew he'd
[1:39:03] lacked eternal life saying what lack i
[1:39:05] yet
[1:39:07] god puts a conscience in every heart
[1:39:09] including yours and mine so we know how
[1:39:12] far we have come with god and if we yet
[1:39:14] lack his character qualities
[1:39:17] jesus agreed saying one thing thou
[1:39:19] lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou
[1:39:22] has and give to the poor and thou shalt
[1:39:25] have treasure in heaven and come take up
[1:39:27] the cross and follow me
[1:39:30] the ruler left jesus grieved and
[1:39:32] sorrowful for he had great possessions
[1:39:36] your story doesn't have to end like this
[1:39:38] rulers
[1:39:39] by grace you can add to your character
[1:39:42] as the story implies god's spirit gives
[1:39:44] a true honest spiritual assessment for
[1:39:46] every person through preaching bible
[1:39:49] reading and witnessing
[1:39:51] not only does god love you like he loved
[1:39:54] this ruler but he offers explicit
[1:39:56] directions on what you must do to
[1:39:58] continue growing in grace and knowledge
[1:40:01] of the lord jesus christ
[1:40:03] right now you can know where you are in
[1:40:05] god's plan for your life
[1:40:06] you can look at figure 12 and ask the
[1:40:09] holy spirit to reveal which stage you
[1:40:11] are in
[1:40:12] have you recently been baptized in the
[1:40:14] name of the lord jesus christ with
[1:40:16] divine faith then you are in stage one
[1:40:18] and ready to move into stage two seeking
[1:40:21] virtue
[1:40:22] have you received divine virtue living
[1:40:24] boldly for christ in public settings and
[1:40:27] ready to go further into divine
[1:40:29] knowledge or beyond into temperance or
[1:40:31] patience
[1:40:32] or are you ready to be baptized with the
[1:40:34] holy ghost in stage 3
[1:40:36] seeing godliness brotherly kindness and
[1:40:38] the other stage 2 qualities manifesting
[1:40:41] in your life
[1:40:43] jesus's body is in heaven but his holy
[1:40:45] spirit is present and near to every
[1:40:47] heart attempting to show his current
[1:40:50] character
[1:40:51] and offer a greater experience serving
[1:40:53] christ
[1:40:54] acts 17 verses 26 through 28 says
[1:40:57] and hath made of one blood all nations
[1:41:00] of men for to dwell on all the face of
[1:41:03] the earth and has determined the times
[1:41:05] before appointed and the bounds of their
[1:41:07] habitation that they should seek the
[1:41:09] lord if haply they might feel after him
[1:41:12] and find him though he be not far from
[1:41:15] every one of us for in him we live and
[1:41:18] move and have our being as certain also
[1:41:21] of your poets have said for we are also
[1:41:24] his offspring
[1:41:27] scripture declares god weighs each
[1:41:29] person's character in proverbs 16 verse
[1:41:32] 2
[1:41:33] all the ways of a man are clean in his
[1:41:34] own eyes but the lord weigheth the
[1:41:37] spirits
[1:41:38] god's word is the measuring stick or
[1:41:40] balance that measures or weighs your
[1:41:43] character
[1:41:44] paul says in philippians 3 16 christians
[1:41:47] should walk by the same rule which means
[1:41:50] a measuring rod rule a carpenter's line
[1:41:53] or measuring tape in the greek
[1:41:56] the reason god gave us his word is so we
[1:41:58] can measure our lives by its truths
[1:42:01] someday all be judged by the word for
[1:42:04] paul declares god shall judge the
[1:42:06] secrets of men by jesus christ according
[1:42:08] to my gospel
[1:42:11] joining the rich young ruler belshazzar
[1:42:13] and job are two more bible examples of
[1:42:16] men aware that their lives were being
[1:42:19] weighed by god
[1:42:21] belshazzar king of babylon at the time
[1:42:23] of its fall
[1:42:24] profaned israel's holy temple vessels by
[1:42:27] feasting with them while praising idols
[1:42:31] supernatural fingers interrupted the
[1:42:33] evil feast by writing the king's doom on
[1:42:35] the palace wall which daniel interpreted
[1:42:38] as thou belshazzar art weighed in the
[1:42:42] balances and found wanting
[1:42:45] the king was guilty of refusing to learn
[1:42:47] humility from nebuchadnezzar's life and
[1:42:50] offer glory to the one true god
[1:42:52] in god's sight belshazzar's character
[1:42:55] was wanting or deficient of humility
[1:42:58] job had his patience tested to its limit
[1:43:01] yet past the test
[1:43:03] after suffering the loss of his
[1:43:04] livestock servants and children by
[1:43:07] satan's desire
[1:43:08] job kept his integrity by worshiping god
[1:43:11] and not charging god foolishly
[1:43:14] job endured months of tests and pleaded
[1:43:17] with god saying let me be weighed in an
[1:43:19] even balance that god may know mine
[1:43:22] integrity
[1:43:23] god had weighed job's life and deemed it
[1:43:26] acceptable telling his three friends
[1:43:27] that job had spoken right and they had
[1:43:30] spoken wrong
[1:43:32] paul explains in second corinthians 4
[1:43:35] verses 16 through 18 that trials and
[1:43:37] tests of faith produce an eternal weight
[1:43:40] of glory
[1:43:41] what is this eternal weight it must be
[1:43:44] the heavenly awards that await
[1:43:46] christians such as the crown of life and
[1:43:48] memorials god keeps as witnesses of his
[1:43:51] children's righteous acts of faith
[1:43:54] acts 10 4 says an angel let cornelius
[1:43:57] know that a memorial of his prayers and
[1:44:00] almsgiving were before god in heaven may
[1:44:03] you set your affection on things above
[1:44:05] and live for eternal rewards in the
[1:44:07] midst of your tests
[1:44:09] peter says our tests of faith are much
[1:44:12] more precious than of gold that
[1:44:13] perisheth
[1:44:15] jesus wants to help you recognize your
[1:44:17] current character and what is lacking so
[1:44:20] that you may accept his portion of
[1:44:22] divine character which will help you
[1:44:24] store up an eternal weight of glory in
[1:44:27] heaven
[1:44:30] character quality number three knowledge
[1:44:33] 2 peter 1 verse 5 reads and beside this
[1:44:37] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:44:39] virtue and to virtue knowledge
[1:44:42] knowledge is the third step on your way
[1:44:44] to godliness it's a third measure or
[1:44:46] portion of holy ghost anointing god
[1:44:49] wants to add to your spirit
[1:44:51] in the greek knowledge is defined as
[1:44:53] general intelligence
[1:44:55] understanding the deeper more perfect
[1:44:57] and enlarged knowledge of this religion
[1:45:00] such as belongs to the more advanced
[1:45:02] especially of things lawful and unlawful
[1:45:05] for christians
[1:45:06] based upon this definition the bible
[1:45:08] places knowledge as a deep understanding
[1:45:10] of christianity you need to advance on
[1:45:13] god's way
[1:45:15] logically god must give you knowledge
[1:45:18] a deep understanding of god
[1:45:20] after you have faith and virtue
[1:45:22] faith helped you choose the right way to
[1:45:24] walk and virtue was moral power to daily
[1:45:27] walk in his narrow path
[1:45:29] but knowledge helps you understand
[1:45:31] deeper truths about what pleases god and
[1:45:33] why he requires certain behaviors since
[1:45:36] his judgments are unsearchable and his
[1:45:38] ways past finding out
[1:45:42] christians who asked for and receive
[1:45:43] god's knowledge must first reject the
[1:45:46] sin of reasoning or human understanding
[1:45:49] you must differentiate honest spiritual
[1:45:51] reasoning from sinful reasoning
[1:45:53] god gave you the gift to use spiritual
[1:45:55] reasoning in your daily life
[1:45:57] in isaiah god lovingly invited israel to
[1:46:00] reason with him promising to wash their
[1:46:03] sins white as snow if they were willing
[1:46:05] obedient and did well
[1:46:07] this glorious spiritual reasoning leads
[1:46:09] to eternal life
[1:46:11] but sinful reasoning is different it's a
[1:46:13] thought process exalting satan's or
[1:46:16] man's will above god's
[1:46:20] genesis 3 provides the first example of
[1:46:23] humans choosing sinful reasoning over
[1:46:25] god's knowledge
[1:46:27] the subtle serpent begowed eve into
[1:46:29] eating the forbidden fruit through false
[1:46:31] reasoning
[1:46:32] god had previously told adam he'd surely
[1:46:34] die if he partook of the fruit in
[1:46:37] genesis 2 verse 17
[1:46:39] and eve had the same knowledge according
[1:46:41] to genesis 3 verses 2 and 3
[1:46:44] but the serpent exalted his will above
[1:46:46] gods claiming eve would not surely die
[1:46:49] because she would be wise like a god
[1:46:51] knowing good and evil
[1:46:53] even after eve's beguilement adam
[1:46:56] willingly chose to join in his wife's
[1:46:58] disobedience plunging humanity into
[1:47:00] utter chaos
[1:47:02] both of their reasoning was completely
[1:47:04] contrary to god's knowledge and produced
[1:47:06] incalculable effects upon human history
[1:47:10] every emergency siren screams out
[1:47:12] because of sinful reasoning
[1:47:14] each natural disaster ravages the land
[1:47:17] because of human reasoning
[1:47:18] every skin wrinkle and gray hair is the
[1:47:21] result of eve's false reasoning
[1:47:24] every funeral is the result of the
[1:47:26] serpent's sinful reasoning
[1:47:28] thankfully jesus's spiritual reasoning
[1:47:30] to always do those things that please
[1:47:33] the father has resulted in redemption
[1:47:36] for all believers
[1:47:37] romans 5 verses 18 and 19 declares
[1:47:41] therefore as by the offense of one
[1:47:44] judgment came upon all men to
[1:47:46] condemnation
[1:47:47] even so by the righteousness of one the
[1:47:50] free gift came upon all men unto
[1:47:52] justification of life for as by one
[1:47:55] man's disobedience many were made
[1:47:57] sinners so by the obedience of one shall
[1:48:00] many be made righteous
[1:48:03] in capernaum the lord jesus confronted
[1:48:06] scribes about their sinful reasoning
[1:48:08] when he forgave the palsy-stricken man's
[1:48:11] sins in mark 2 verses 1 through 12.
[1:48:14] the scribes along with all the region
[1:48:16] around about galilee had heard of
[1:48:19] jesus's famous authority over demons and
[1:48:22] his miracles and should have understood
[1:48:24] that he the christ had power to forgive
[1:48:27] sins
[1:48:28] after all scribes knew isaiah's
[1:48:30] prophecies that the messiah was
[1:48:32] the mighty god the everlasting father
[1:48:35] the merciful messiah gave the scribes
[1:48:37] another chance to reject their sinful
[1:48:39] reasoning by healing the man of palsy
[1:48:42] saying
[1:48:43] but that ye may know that the son of man
[1:48:45] hath power on earth to forgive sins he
[1:48:48] saith to the sick of the palsy i say
[1:48:50] unto thee arise and take up thy bed and
[1:48:53] go thy way into thine house
[1:48:57] paul models a faithful example of godly
[1:48:59] reasoning out of the scriptures in acts
[1:49:02] 17 verses 1 through 12. for three
[1:49:05] straight sabbath days paul uses old
[1:49:07] testament scripture to reason with
[1:49:09] thessalonians about prophecies of
[1:49:12] jesus's death and resurrection causing
[1:49:14] some to believe
[1:49:16] when the apostle moves on to berea and
[1:49:18] reasons again in the synagogue the new
[1:49:21] believers react in the best manner
[1:49:23] supporting their godly reasoning by
[1:49:25] searching the scriptures themselves acts
[1:49:28] 17 verse 11 says these were more noble
[1:49:31] than those in thessalonica in that they
[1:49:34] received the word with all readiness of
[1:49:36] mind and searched the scriptures daily
[1:49:38] whether those things were so
[1:49:41] you manifest honest spiritual reasoning
[1:49:43] when you hungrily seek god's word for
[1:49:46] yourself
[1:49:49] knowledge as a key light and fragrance
[1:49:53] three bible metaphors describe knowledge
[1:49:55] as a key light and fragrance providing
[1:49:58] christians three perspectives on the
[1:50:00] life-changing power of divine knowledge
[1:50:04] jesus calls knowledge a key in luke 11
[1:50:07] 52
[1:50:08] woe unto you lawyers for ye have taken
[1:50:10] away the key of knowledge ye enter not
[1:50:13] in yourselves and them that were
[1:50:15] entering in ye hindered
[1:50:17] our lord makes a similar statement to
[1:50:19] the pharisees in matthew 23 verse 13
[1:50:23] but woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:50:25] hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of
[1:50:28] heaven against men for ye neither go in
[1:50:30] yourselves neither suffer ye them that
[1:50:33] are entering to go in
[1:50:35] in both statements jesus rebukes
[1:50:37] religious men for disallowing people
[1:50:39] from entering into the kingdom of heaven
[1:50:42] these evil men took away the key of
[1:50:43] knowledge so people could not enter the
[1:50:46] kingdom of heaven through jesus's
[1:50:48] ministry
[1:50:49] the jewish rulers had the true knowledge
[1:50:51] about jesus
[1:50:52] nicodemus expressed that he and the
[1:50:54] sanhedrin council
[1:50:56] knew jesus was a teacher sent from god
[1:50:58] yet jewish leaders threatened to
[1:51:00] excommunicate anyone from the synagogue
[1:51:03] who believed in jesus as messiah how is
[1:51:06] this done
[1:51:07] satan anointed false teachers with
[1:51:09] doctrines of devils and commandments of
[1:51:11] men to point followers away from
[1:51:14] entering into christ the door
[1:51:16] i am the door by me if any man enter in
[1:51:19] he shall be saved and shall go in and
[1:51:22] out and find pasture
[1:51:25] to ensure his followers entered into
[1:51:27] eternal blessings
[1:51:28] jesus gave peter the keys of the kingdom
[1:51:30] of heaven in matthew 16 verse 19. after
[1:51:34] you receive the holy ghost on the day of
[1:51:36] pentecost the book of acts records that
[1:51:38] peter used the keys to unlock salvation
[1:51:41] and the holy ghost baptism to three
[1:51:44] different groups
[1:51:45] jews samaritans and gentiles
[1:51:49] the jews received salvation from peter's
[1:51:51] preaching in acts 2 verses 14 through
[1:51:54] 47.
[1:51:55] the keys or promises of god peter used
[1:51:58] to help three thousand souls enter the
[1:52:00] kingdom of heaven are found in acts 2 38
[1:52:03] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:52:06] in the name of jesus christ for the
[1:52:08] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[1:52:10] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:52:12] the samaritans needed peter's keys to be
[1:52:15] born again in acts 8 verses 1 through 17
[1:52:19] having been previously saved and
[1:52:20] baptized through philip's ministry
[1:52:23] once peter and john arrived they prayed
[1:52:25] for and laid hands upon the new
[1:52:27] believers and the holy ghost fell upon
[1:52:29] them birthing spiritual children into
[1:52:31] god's kingdom
[1:52:33] the gentiles also received the holy
[1:52:35] ghost through peter's keys in acts 10
[1:52:37] verses 34 through 48.
[1:52:40] while peter preached at cornelius house
[1:52:43] the holy ghost fell on all them which
[1:52:45] heard the word
[1:52:46] peter later rehearsed these events to
[1:52:48] jews in acts 11 verses 1 through 18
[1:52:51] declaring that god was granting to the
[1:52:53] gentiles repentance unto life
[1:52:56] peter faithfully and powerfully used the
[1:52:59] keys jesus gave him to allow three
[1:53:02] different groups to access eternal life
[1:53:06] acts 16 details paul's first european
[1:53:09] convert from thyatira in modern-day
[1:53:12] turkey named lydia
[1:53:14] sent by vision to macedonia paul went to
[1:53:16] pray at a riverside and spoke to a group
[1:53:18] of women about jesus christ
[1:53:21] lydia received paul's knowledge of
[1:53:23] christ and she and her household were
[1:53:25] baptized the key of knowledge opened
[1:53:27] lydia's heart and a certain woman named
[1:53:30] lydia a seller of purple of the city of
[1:53:32] thyrotira which worshiped god heard us
[1:53:35] whose heart the lord opened that she
[1:53:37] attended under the things which were
[1:53:39] spoken of paul
[1:53:42] every promise of god is obtained by
[1:53:44] knowledge or understanding god's will
[1:53:47] second peter 1 verses 3 and 4 reads
[1:53:50] according as his divine power hath given
[1:53:53] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:53:56] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:53:58] of him that hath called us to glory and
[1:54:00] virtue
[1:54:01] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:54:04] great and precious promises
[1:54:06] that by these ye might be partakers of
[1:54:08] the divine nature
[1:54:10] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:54:11] the world through lust
[1:54:14] all spiritual blessings come through the
[1:54:16] knowledge of him god whether you need
[1:54:19] salvation cleansing bodily healing or
[1:54:22] deliverance
[1:54:24] light is the second metaphor paul uses
[1:54:27] to describe knowledge in 2nd corinthians
[1:54:29] 4 verses 6 and 7
[1:54:32] located in our hearts or spirits
[1:54:35] for god who commanded the light to shine
[1:54:37] out of darkness hath shined into our
[1:54:39] hearts to give the light of knowledge of
[1:54:42] the glory of god in the face of jesus
[1:54:44] christ
[1:54:45] but we have this treasure in earthen
[1:54:47] vessels that the excellency of the power
[1:54:50] may be of god and not of us
[1:54:53] david writes the same in psalm 119 verse
[1:54:56] 130 saying the entrance of thy words
[1:55:00] giveth light it giveth understanding
[1:55:02] unto the simple the knowledge of god's
[1:55:05] word is a lamp unto my feet and a light
[1:55:07] unto my path giving understanding to the
[1:55:10] humble
[1:55:12] anywhere salvation through the gospel of
[1:55:14] jesus christ is preached in truth the
[1:55:17] light of knowledge is shining
[1:55:19] paul and barnabas first preached the
[1:55:21] light of god's knowledge to jews in
[1:55:23] antioch who blasphemed it causing the
[1:55:26] apostles to focus on preaching to
[1:55:28] gentiles
[1:55:30] then paul and barnabas waxed bold and
[1:55:32] said it was necessary that the word of
[1:55:35] god should first have been spoken to you
[1:55:37] but seeing ye put it from you and judge
[1:55:40] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[1:55:42] lo we turn to the gentiles
[1:55:45] for soweth the lord commanded us saying
[1:55:47] i have set thee to be a light of the
[1:55:49] gentiles that thou shouldest be for
[1:55:51] salvation unto the ends of the earth
[1:55:55] jesus says the gospels knowledge light
[1:55:58] will shine upon every nation then the
[1:56:00] end of the world will come
[1:56:03] fragrance is the third metaphor
[1:56:05] scripture uses to explain knowledge paul
[1:56:08] writes in second corinthians 2 verses 14
[1:56:11] through 16.
[1:56:13] now thanks be unto god which always
[1:56:15] causes us to triumph in christ and
[1:56:18] maketh manifest the savior of his
[1:56:20] knowledge by us in every place
[1:56:23] for we are unto god a sweet saver of
[1:56:25] christ
[1:56:26] in them that are saved and in them that
[1:56:29] perish
[1:56:30] to the one we are the savior of death
[1:56:32] unto death and to the other the savior
[1:56:34] of life unto life
[1:56:36] and who is sufficient for these things
[1:56:39] the savior or fragrance of divine
[1:56:41] knowledge is spread by christians in
[1:56:44] every place they preach
[1:56:46] to believers their knowledge is
[1:56:47] fragrance unto life
[1:56:49] but to sinners it's fragrance unto death
[1:56:55] principles of knowledge
[1:56:57] divine knowledge is founded on the
[1:56:59] principles that god cannot lie the bible
[1:57:01] is free from contradictions and god
[1:57:03] still works through supernatural gifts
[1:57:05] of the holy ghost
[1:57:07] these principles ensure your advancement
[1:57:10] in deeper christian truths because you
[1:57:12] know god is trustworthy
[1:57:16] god cannot lie
[1:57:17] many scoffers say god changes his mind
[1:57:20] deceives mankind and doesn't keep his
[1:57:22] promises nothing could be further from
[1:57:24] the truth
[1:57:26] scripture shouts every man is a liar or
[1:57:28] has told a lie at some point during his
[1:57:30] lifetime and god is the only truth
[1:57:33] teller
[1:57:34] god forbid yea let god be true but every
[1:57:37] man a liar as it is written that thou
[1:57:40] mightest be justified in thy sayings and
[1:57:42] might has overcome when thou art judged
[1:57:46] god told noah to build an ark because he
[1:57:48] would flood the earth in judgment upon
[1:57:51] wicked-hearted men
[1:57:52] noah faithfully prepared the ark for
[1:57:54] around 55 to 75 years before one drop of
[1:57:58] rain fell god's word stood true despite
[1:58:01] over a half century of waiting upon
[1:58:04] it 25 years after god promised abram
[1:58:08] he'd make a great nation out of him
[1:58:10] isaac was born to his wife sarah
[1:58:14] despite both of their occasional
[1:58:16] doubtful laughter at god's promise over
[1:58:18] a two-decade wait the word came to pass
[1:58:21] god repeatedly strengthened abraham's
[1:58:23] faith until he was fully persuaded that
[1:58:26] what he god had promised he was able
[1:58:29] also to perform
[1:58:32] over 800 years before jesus birth the
[1:58:35] prophet isaiah foretold it saying behold
[1:58:38] a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[1:58:40] and shall call his name emmanuel eight
[1:58:43] centuries of theological skepticism
[1:58:46] could not stop god from keeping his
[1:58:48] promise by visiting a highly favored
[1:58:50] virgin named mary causing her to
[1:58:52] conceive jesus the son of god
[1:58:56] it's crucial to understand god makes
[1:58:58] both conditional and unconditional
[1:59:00] promises
[1:59:02] his promise that a virgin would conceive
[1:59:04] the messiah was unconditional but his
[1:59:06] warning to destroy nineveh was
[1:59:08] conditional
[1:59:09] and jonah began to enter into the city a
[1:59:12] day's journey and he cried and said yet
[1:59:14] forty days and nineveh shall be
[1:59:16] overthrown
[1:59:18] god's word doesn't record the
[1:59:19] conditional aspect of his warning it
[1:59:22] only states its overthrowing
[1:59:24] the lesson is to seek understanding if a
[1:59:27] promise of god is conditional or
[1:59:29] unconditional
[1:59:31] any unconditional promise god speaks
[1:59:34] today just as in the past will come to
[1:59:37] pass
[1:59:37] conditional promises require mature
[1:59:40] spiritual discernment since failed
[1:59:42] prophecies spoken in god's name were not
[1:59:45] spoken by god but rather by an evil
[1:59:48] lying spirit impersonating the holy one
[1:59:52] the bible is free from contradictions
[1:59:55] since god sent jesus as the way to save
[1:59:57] sinners because he so loved the world he
[2:00:00] is obligated to give us an infallible
[2:00:03] written record of instructions for how
[2:00:05] to walk this way
[2:00:07] the just and fair god must provide a
[2:00:09] clear path to heaven if he is warning
[2:00:11] mankind with everlasting judgment for
[2:00:14] willful disobedience to his eternal life
[2:00:17] offer
[2:00:18] humanity will be judged by god's word
[2:00:20] romans 2 verse 16 says in the day when
[2:00:23] god shall judge the secrets of men by
[2:00:26] jesus christ according to my gospel
[2:00:29] jesus is the word of god and the true
[2:00:31] word of god is found in the king james
[2:00:33] version of the holy bible
[2:00:36] floyd nolan jones book which version is
[2:00:39] the bible
[2:00:40] details the validity and reliability of
[2:00:43] the king james version in contrast to
[2:00:45] modern bible versions jones proclaims
[2:00:48] from the outset that the king james or
[2:00:50] authorized version is the word of god
[2:00:53] translated into the english language to
[2:00:56] the extent that it is the final
[2:00:58] authority in all matters of conduct and
[2:01:00] faith the kjv is set apart from modern
[2:01:03] versions because its new testament is
[2:01:05] translated from the most accurate greek
[2:01:08] manuscripts the textus receptus whereas
[2:01:11] modern versions use the corrupted greek
[2:01:14] text called the codex vaticanus b
[2:01:17] two men
[2:01:19] b.f westcott
[2:01:20] 1825 to 1901 and fja hort 1828 to 1892
[2:01:28] produced this polluted radical greek
[2:01:30] text
[2:01:31] in 1881
[2:01:33] examples of bound of modern versions
[2:01:36] through westcott and hort's efforts
[2:01:38] omitting god's pure words proving just
[2:01:40] how dangerously deceptive these versions
[2:01:43] are
[2:01:44] estimated by jones westcott and hort
[2:01:47] changed added or subtracted 7
[2:01:50] of the 140
[2:01:52] 521 greek words in the texas receptus
[2:01:57] revelations 22 verses 18 and 19
[2:02:00] warns of the awful eternal repercussions
[2:02:03] for adding to god's word or taking away
[2:02:06] from them because every word of god is
[2:02:08] pure
[2:02:09] and taking away from the word is exactly
[2:02:11] what modern versions do
[2:02:14] colossians 1 verse 14 says we have
[2:02:17] redemption through his blood even the
[2:02:19] forgiveness of sins in the kjv but the
[2:02:22] niv esv
[2:02:24] and nasv
[2:02:26] omit through his blood
[2:02:28] certainly the enemy satan wants jesus's
[2:02:31] blood omitted as much as possible
[2:02:34] because he knows the blood of the
[2:02:36] everlasting covenant makes believers
[2:02:38] perfect in every good work to do god's
[2:02:41] will
[2:02:43] christians daily access the cleansing
[2:02:45] power of jesus's blood for we wash our
[2:02:48] robes white in the blood of the lamb
[2:02:52] the kjv of isaiah 14 12
[2:02:55] identify satan as lucifer son of the
[2:02:57] morning but modern versions omit lucifer
[2:03:01] and give satan titles that belong only
[2:03:03] to christ
[2:03:05] the niv of isaiah 14 verse 12 calls
[2:03:08] satan morning star
[2:03:10] which is a title only given to christ in
[2:03:12] revelation 22 16
[2:03:15] god is not the author of confusion he
[2:03:17] does not share his name or titles with
[2:03:19] anyone else but satan wants to be like
[2:03:22] christ and seeks to steal his worship
[2:03:25] according to isaiah 14 verses 13-14
[2:03:29] the esv and rsv make a similar error in
[2:03:32] isaiah 14 12 calling satan the day star
[2:03:36] but jesus christ is the single day star
[2:03:39] that has risen in our hearts according
[2:03:41] to 2 peter 1 verse 19.
[2:03:44] the kjv is the only version that
[2:03:46] preserves god's original full revelation
[2:03:49] of himself and his will
[2:03:53] some say the king james version contains
[2:03:55] contradictions but that is false
[2:03:57] one example of a supposed contradiction
[2:04:00] concerns how many died in the plague
[2:04:02] after the feast of baal pior
[2:04:05] numbers 25 9 says 24 000 died while 1st
[2:04:09] corinthians 10 verse 8 says 23 000 which
[2:04:12] is it
[2:04:13] the key is understanding the wording
[2:04:15] notice the words fell in one day found
[2:04:18] in first corinthians 10 verse 8 there is
[2:04:20] no contradiction between the two
[2:04:22] scriptures because 23 000 died in one
[2:04:25] day and then 1 000 more died either the
[2:04:28] next day or in the following days
[2:04:30] thereafter to bring the total fallen to
[2:04:33] 24 000.
[2:04:34] careful prayerful bible study allows
[2:04:37] christians to maintain full assurance
[2:04:39] that god's word is contradiction free
[2:04:44] god still works through the supernatural
[2:04:46] gifts of the holy ghost
[2:04:48] many follow the cessation doctrine
[2:04:50] believing the gifts of the holy ghost
[2:04:51] have ceased without going into great
[2:04:54] depth on this subject know that the
[2:04:56] cessation doctrine is wrong for a number
[2:04:58] of reasons
[2:04:59] first jesus put the gifts into the
[2:05:01] church as part of the great commission
[2:05:03] and never took them out
[2:05:05] mark 16 verses 15-18 records jesus
[2:05:09] promise that gifts like speaking in
[2:05:11] tongues casting out devils and healing
[2:05:14] the sick would follow them that believe
[2:05:16] as the gospel was preached in all the
[2:05:18] world to every creature in a parallel
[2:05:21] passage on the great commission our lord
[2:05:23] said lo i am with you alway even unto
[2:05:26] the end of the world amen
[2:05:28] genuine manifestation of spiritual gifts
[2:05:30] are evidence of christ's spirit being
[2:05:32] present and working with all believers
[2:05:35] in all generations until the end of the
[2:05:37] world
[2:05:38] christ never limited these gifts to just
[2:05:40] the apostles but said the gifts were for
[2:05:43] them that believe any true believer
[2:05:47] some think first corinthians 13 verses 8
[2:05:50] through 13 teaches the gifts ended with
[2:05:53] the completion of the written new
[2:05:54] testament
[2:05:56] careful examination of this text proves
[2:05:58] otherwise for paul states perfection
[2:06:00] will come when we are face to face with
[2:06:03] christ
[2:06:04] since living christians are not yet face
[2:06:06] to face with christ we still need
[2:06:08] prophecies tongues and knowledge to
[2:06:11] operate in part meaning through and
[2:06:13] despite the veil of our sinful bodies
[2:06:17] once we have new eternal bodies or that
[2:06:19] which is perfect
[2:06:21] then that which is in part shall be done
[2:06:23] away with our human bodies will be
[2:06:25] changed into glorified or perfect bodies
[2:06:28] when we see jesus that is the moment we
[2:06:30] will not need spiritual gifts
[2:06:32] first john 3 verse 2 teaches when he
[2:06:35] jesus shall appear we shall be like him
[2:06:38] for we shall see him as he is
[2:06:41] paul writes who shall change our vile
[2:06:44] body that it may be fashioned like unto
[2:06:46] his glorious body according to the
[2:06:48] working whereby he is able even to
[2:06:51] subdue all things unto himself
[2:06:55] second paul ordained the nine gifts of
[2:06:57] the spirit to the corinthians and all
[2:06:59] christians over 20 years after jesus
[2:07:02] ascended to heaven
[2:07:03] paul received his revelation from jesus
[2:07:05] christ himself and warned that if anyone
[2:07:08] changed it they were cursed
[2:07:10] in the same letter to the galatians the
[2:07:12] apostle defends the gifted members among
[2:07:15] them who are working miracles by the
[2:07:17] hearing of faith rather than the works
[2:07:19] of the law
[2:07:20] paul never condemned gifted workers of
[2:07:22] miracles nor did he tell them to cease
[2:07:25] operating in spiritual gifts
[2:07:28] third many supporters of the cessation
[2:07:30] doctrine say only the apostles of christ
[2:07:33] were to use the gifts and then the gifts
[2:07:35] would cease
[2:07:37] this argument is extremely shallow
[2:07:39] and proven false by a casual reading of
[2:07:42] the new testament
[2:07:43] philip the evangelist had four virgin
[2:07:45] daughters
[2:07:46] obviously not among the twelve apostles
[2:07:48] who prophesied according to acts 21
[2:07:51] verses 8 and 9.
[2:07:53] agabus was a prophet who correctly
[2:07:55] predicted the great dirt throughout all
[2:07:57] the world in acts 11 verse 28.
[2:08:01] paul told the thessalonians not to
[2:08:03] despise prophecies by quenching the holy
[2:08:06] spirit but rather to prove them to be
[2:08:08] sure they were from god
[2:08:10] this was the same principle paul taught
[2:08:12] the corinthians
[2:08:13] gifts are welcome to operate as long as
[2:08:15] they are tested and proven to be truly
[2:08:18] from the lord
[2:08:20] to conclude this subject
[2:08:22] christians covet earnestly the best
[2:08:24] gifts but their operation must be
[2:08:26] motivated by love as love is a more
[2:08:29] excellent way those who operate gifts of
[2:08:31] god are not always among the saved so
[2:08:34] greater emphasis should be placed upon
[2:08:36] loving obedience to every word of god
[2:08:39] rather than seeking the operation of
[2:08:41] gifts
[2:08:42] god is the only one who determines when
[2:08:44] gifts operate
[2:08:45] in paul's life
[2:08:47] god led him to do many great miracles
[2:08:49] but he couldn't heal himself from the
[2:08:50] thorn in his own flesh
[2:08:52] he left trophema sick at malidum in
[2:08:55] second timothy 4 verse 20 and told
[2:08:58] timothy to use a little wine for his
[2:09:00] sick stomach and often infirmities
[2:09:03] paul couldn't heal others at his own
[2:09:05] will
[2:09:06] god will lead his people to do miracles
[2:09:08] and all other gift operations at his
[2:09:10] sovereign will and not at the will of
[2:09:13] man
[2:09:16] the gift of the word of knowledge
[2:09:19] the gift of the word of knowledge is one
[2:09:20] of the nine gifts of the spirit listed
[2:09:22] in first corinthians 12 verses 8 through
[2:09:25] 10
[2:09:26] like the separate gift of faith first
[2:09:28] corinthians 12 9
[2:09:30] and the character quality of faith
[2:09:32] second peter 1 verse 5
[2:09:34] the gift of the word of knowledge is
[2:09:36] different than the character quality of
[2:09:38] knowledge
[2:09:39] gifts are placed in a person's human
[2:09:41] spirit by god from his birth and can
[2:09:44] operate regardless of whether a person
[2:09:46] is saved or not
[2:09:48] the greek definition for the character
[2:09:50] quality of knowledge second peter 1
[2:09:52] verse 5 and the gift of the word of
[2:09:55] knowledge first corinthians 12 8 is the
[2:09:58] same
[2:09:58] a deep understanding of things lawful
[2:10:01] and unlawful for advanced mature
[2:10:03] christians
[2:10:04] but the gift of the word of knowledge
[2:10:06] must be the ability to minister a deep
[2:10:09] understanding of god's word to others
[2:10:12] it's a gift or key of knowledge that
[2:10:14] allows someone to enter into the
[2:10:16] promises of god
[2:10:18] three examples from the book of acts
[2:10:20] demonstrate this gift of knowledge in
[2:10:22] the lives of peter philip and paul
[2:10:26] in acts chapter 2 the baptism of the
[2:10:28] holy ghost falls upon 120 of jesus's
[2:10:32] followers and a multitude of jews
[2:10:34] witness their exuberant praise and
[2:10:36] adoration
[2:10:37] the multitude thinks these 120 believers
[2:10:40] are drunk but peter's gift of knowledge
[2:10:42] helps him understand the scriptural
[2:10:44] promise god is fulfilling joel 2 verses
[2:10:47] 28 to 32
[2:10:49] he concludes his sermon by giving the
[2:10:50] multitude the key of knowledge they need
[2:10:53] to become christians repent and be
[2:10:55] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[2:10:58] that day three thousand people entered
[2:11:00] into salvation through peter's word of
[2:11:02] knowledge
[2:11:04] philip uses god's gift of knowledge in
[2:11:06] acts 8 verses 26 through
[2:11:09] by sharing the understanding of jesus's
[2:11:12] fulfilling of isaiah 53 verses 7 and 8
[2:11:15] to an ethiopian eunuch
[2:11:18] philip helps the eunuch understand jesus
[2:11:20] was the lamb of god brought to slaughter
[2:11:22] on calvary to save mankind
[2:11:25] philip continues to preach to the eunuch
[2:11:27] who sees water and asks to be baptized
[2:11:30] the chariot is made to stand still while
[2:11:32] philip baptizes him helping him enter
[2:11:35] into salvation and eternal life through
[2:11:38] the knowledge of god
[2:11:40] acts 19 verses 1 through 6 records
[2:11:43] paul's gift of knowledge opening the
[2:11:45] door for 12 ephesians to receive the
[2:11:48] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:11:50] previous to paul's coming the ephesians
[2:11:52] believed in jesus christ and had been
[2:11:54] saved through apollo's scriptural
[2:11:56] teachings for apollos mightily convinced
[2:11:58] the jews and that publicly showing by
[2:12:01] the scriptures that jesus was christ
[2:12:04] it's clear the ephesians already had the
[2:12:06] character quality of knowledge but
[2:12:08] lacked the knowledge of god the father's
[2:12:10] promise
[2:12:11] to baptize believers with the holy ghost
[2:12:13] according to luke 24 49 and acts 1 verse
[2:12:17] 4
[2:12:18] god graciously sends paul to ephesus to
[2:12:21] help them enter into the third step of
[2:12:23] the christian journey who asks have you
[2:12:26] received the holy ghost since she
[2:12:28] believed
[2:12:29] once the 12 receive this knowledge paul
[2:12:31] lays his hands on them and the holy
[2:12:33] ghost comes on them manifesting through
[2:12:36] tongues and prophecy
[2:12:39] whether knowledge is added to an
[2:12:40] individual's character or the gift of
[2:12:42] knowledge helps one christian minister
[2:12:45] understanding to another it's a
[2:12:47] life-changing enlightening anointing of
[2:12:49] the holy spirit
[2:12:54] character quality number four temperance
[2:12:57] second peter 1 verse 6 reads and to
[2:13:00] knowledge temperance
[2:13:01] temperance is the fourth step on your
[2:13:03] way to godliness a fourth measure or
[2:13:06] portion of holy ghost anointing god
[2:13:08] wants to add to your spirit
[2:13:11] the greek definition of temperance is
[2:13:13] self-control the virtue of one who
[2:13:16] masters his desires and passions
[2:13:18] especially his sensual appetites
[2:13:21] temperance is the self-control you need
[2:13:23] to remain on god's way
[2:13:25] after choosing god's way through faith
[2:13:27] having virtue to publicly and daily walk
[2:13:29] the way and knowledge to more deeply
[2:13:32] understand the way god desires you
[2:13:34] crucify any remaining lust of the flesh
[2:13:37] and mind so you can remain on the way
[2:13:41] temperance empowers you to become more
[2:13:43] spiritual than carnal
[2:13:45] you have five carnal fleshly senses you
[2:13:47] must bring into subjection to the holy
[2:13:50] ghost
[2:13:51] sight taste touch smell and hearing
[2:13:54] once you've added temperance to your
[2:13:55] character by god's grace you'll be able
[2:13:58] to trust in your sixth sense faith
[2:14:01] rather than your five senses
[2:14:03] faith is a spiritual sense because it is
[2:14:05] an inward spiritual evidence you have of
[2:14:08] things not seen
[2:14:10] hebrews 11 1 says
[2:14:12] now faith is the substance of things
[2:14:14] hoped for the evidence of things not
[2:14:16] seen
[2:14:18] galatians 5 verses 24 and 25 sums up the
[2:14:22] spiritual versus natural battle well
[2:14:26] and they that are christ have crucified
[2:14:28] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[2:14:31] if we live in the spirit let us also
[2:14:34] walk in the spirit
[2:14:36] your victory to be spiritually minded is
[2:14:38] accomplished through crucifying your
[2:14:40] fleshly lusts
[2:14:41] crucifixion is a slow cruel death as
[2:14:44] seen in jesus's self-sacrificial death
[2:14:46] on the cross
[2:14:48] jesus calls you to take up your cross
[2:14:50] daily and follow me
[2:14:53] christians like paul die daily to the
[2:14:56] temptations endured through their five
[2:14:58] senses
[2:15:00] christians who ask for and receive god's
[2:15:03] temperance must first reject the sin of
[2:15:05] sensuality
[2:15:07] scripture repeatedly warns to flee from
[2:15:09] sensual lusts
[2:15:11] the experienced preacher paul told the
[2:15:13] young preacher timothy to
[2:15:15] flee youthful lusts but follow
[2:15:18] righteousness faith charity peace with
[2:15:21] them that call on the lord out of a pure
[2:15:23] heart
[2:15:24] christians recognize sensual lusts and
[2:15:26] run from them just as joseph fled from
[2:15:29] the daily lustful advances of potiphar's
[2:15:32] wife in genesis 39 verses 7 through 12
[2:15:36] more on joseph later in this chapter
[2:15:40] over time you can identify true
[2:15:42] temperate christians just by their
[2:15:44] physical location because scripture says
[2:15:47] sensual ones will ultimately separate
[2:15:50] from spirit-filled believers and gather
[2:15:52] with other lust seekers
[2:15:55] jude 1 verses 18-19 affirms the sensual
[2:15:58] ones separate and cannot have the holy
[2:16:00] spirit
[2:16:02] how they told you there should be
[2:16:03] mockers in the last time who should walk
[2:16:06] after their own ungodly lusts
[2:16:08] these be they who separate themselves
[2:16:11] sensual not having the spirit
[2:16:14] in first corinthians three verses one
[2:16:16] through 1-7 paul describes the damage
[2:16:19] sensual carnal sins had upon the
[2:16:22] corinthian church
[2:16:23] he compared the corinthians to babies
[2:16:26] that could only handle milk or
[2:16:28] elementary preaching rather than meat or
[2:16:30] deep preaching because of their
[2:16:32] carnality
[2:16:34] their sensuality manifested itself among
[2:16:36] the church members with envying and
[2:16:38] strife and divisions while they exalted
[2:16:41] their favorite preachers above others
[2:16:44] the apostle affirms that all preachers
[2:16:46] are equal in importance and mission
[2:16:48] planting and watering god's seed words
[2:16:52] but god is the only great one in the
[2:16:54] church
[2:16:55] first corinthians 3 verse 7 says so then
[2:16:58] neither is he that planteth anything
[2:17:01] neither he that watereth but god that
[2:17:03] giveth the increase
[2:17:05] preachers cannot create spiritual life
[2:17:07] in new converts at their bidding
[2:17:10] god reserves this power to save converts
[2:17:12] to himself
[2:17:16] lust of the flesh and eyes and the pride
[2:17:19] of life
[2:17:21] sensual temptations come through one of
[2:17:23] three categories lust of the flesh lust
[2:17:26] of the eyes and pride of life
[2:17:29] first john 2 verses 15 and 16 says
[2:17:32] love not the world neither the things
[2:17:34] that are in the world if any man love
[2:17:37] the world the love of the father is not
[2:17:39] in him for all that is in the world the
[2:17:41] lust of the flesh and the lust of the
[2:17:43] eyes and the pride of life is not of the
[2:17:46] father but is of the world
[2:17:49] all earthly sins fit into one of these
[2:17:51] three categories
[2:17:53] you have and will be tempted through
[2:17:56] individual categories but also by
[2:17:58] multiple categories simultaneously
[2:18:02] the lust of the flesh is the first
[2:18:03] category and consists of sinful acts
[2:18:06] that bring your flesh pleasure or
[2:18:08] satisfaction bible examples include but
[2:18:11] are not limited to the following
[2:18:13] drunkenness
[2:18:15] being drunk perverts moral judgment
[2:18:17] proverbs 31 verses 4 and 5
[2:18:20] and drunkards will not inherit the
[2:18:21] kingdom of god according to first
[2:18:23] corinthians 6 verse 10
[2:18:26] overeating
[2:18:27] gluttony leads to poverty proverbs 23
[2:18:30] verses 20 and 21
[2:18:32] paul says enemies of jesus's cross are
[2:18:35] those who make their bellies their god
[2:18:37] philippians 3 verses 18 and 19
[2:18:42] sexual sins
[2:18:44] amnon son of david was so vexed with
[2:18:46] fleshly lust that he raped his
[2:18:48] half-sister tamar and he was later
[2:18:51] murdered by her full brother absalon
[2:18:54] in second samuel 13 verses 1-39
[2:18:58] paul told the corinthians to purge out
[2:19:00] and put away from their church a wicked
[2:19:02] brother who was fornicating with his
[2:19:04] stepmother in 1st corinthians 5 verses
[2:19:07] 1-13
[2:19:10] drugs
[2:19:11] linked to and labeled as witchcraft by
[2:19:13] paul
[2:19:14] using drugs to experience a high is
[2:19:16] condemned and those guilty will not
[2:19:19] inherit the kingdom of god according to
[2:19:21] galatians 5 verses 20 and 21
[2:19:25] the lust of the eyes consists of looking
[2:19:27] at and desiring things in a covetous
[2:19:30] manner covetousness is closely connected
[2:19:32] to the lust of the eyes because humans
[2:19:35] often covet things they see
[2:19:37] the following four examples are good
[2:19:39] things to behold with righteous
[2:19:40] intentions but satan often tries to
[2:19:42] pervert good intentions bible examples
[2:19:45] of lusting with the eyes include but are
[2:19:47] not limited to the following
[2:19:50] sexual attraction
[2:19:52] between a lawful husband and wife sexual
[2:19:54] attraction is a blessing
[2:19:56] any attraction outside of marriage must
[2:19:58] be overcome
[2:20:00] neglecting his war duties king david
[2:20:02] sees beautiful bathsheba bathing and
[2:20:04] immediately takes her to commit adultery
[2:20:07] after she conceives david has joab
[2:20:10] assigned uriah bathsheba's husband to a
[2:20:13] battle position where uriah is killed in
[2:20:16] 2nd samuel 11 verses 1-27
[2:20:19] jesus says to look and lust upon a woman
[2:20:22] in your heart is the same as committing
[2:20:24] the literal act of adultery in matthew 5
[2:20:27] verses 27 through 29.
[2:20:30] property
[2:20:32] possessing and defending property is a
[2:20:34] blessing and a god-given right
[2:20:37] desire to possess property must not
[2:20:39] supersede the kingdom of god jesus's
[2:20:42] great supper parable describes a man who
[2:20:43] turns down a great supper
[2:20:45] symbolizing the post-rapture marriage
[2:20:47] supper the lamb
[2:20:49] because he first must needs go and see
[2:20:51] his recently purchased land
[2:20:53] in luke 14 verse 18.
[2:20:56] material possessions god blesses
[2:20:58] believers with material possessions they
[2:21:01] need to enjoy life but he requires
[2:21:03] contentment
[2:21:05] ache and saw
[2:21:06] coveted after and took a babylonian
[2:21:08] garment silver and gold leading to the
[2:21:11] death of 36 israeli soldiers in joshua 7
[2:21:15] verses 1-26
[2:21:18] judas iscariot
[2:21:19] infamous traitor of our lord jesus
[2:21:22] sold out christ's location for 30 pieces
[2:21:24] of silver according to matthew 27 verses
[2:21:27] 3 through 10.
[2:21:29] financial prospects
[2:21:31] god makes some believers rich and others
[2:21:35] again contentment with god's will is the
[2:21:37] goal
[2:21:38] when given the choice of a dwelling
[2:21:39] place
[2:21:40] lot nephew of abraham chose the plain of
[2:21:43] jordan which eventually drew he and his
[2:21:45] family into the vexing
[2:21:47] wicked sodomite culture according to
[2:21:49] genesis 13 verses 10 through 11 and ii
[2:21:52] peter 2 verses 7 and 8.
[2:21:55] balaam the unfaithful prophet from
[2:21:57] moses's time greedily rejected god's
[2:22:00] perfect will in order to seek king
[2:22:02] balak's lucrative offer and cause israel
[2:22:05] to stumble in numbers 22 17
[2:22:08] jude 1 verse 11 and revelation 2 verse
[2:22:11] 14.
[2:22:13] the pride of life consists of seeking
[2:22:15] self-promotion
[2:22:17] self-will and praise
[2:22:19] bible examples include but are not
[2:22:21] limited to
[2:22:22] reputation
[2:22:24] a good name is better than riches but
[2:22:26] believers must let god spread their
[2:22:28] reputations
[2:22:29] the men who partially built the tower of
[2:22:31] babel desire to reach heaven and make a
[2:22:33] name for themselves according to genesis
[2:22:36] 11 verses 1-9
[2:22:39] herod was smitten by the angel the lord
[2:22:41] and worm eaten because he accepted
[2:22:43] praise as god rather than giving god the
[2:22:46] glory in acts 12 verses 22 and 23
[2:22:51] greatness
[2:22:52] before receiving the holy ghost jesus
[2:22:55] disciples battled self-promotion because
[2:22:57] they argued about who was greater in
[2:22:59] luke 22 verses 24-26
[2:23:03] god let king nebuchadnezzar wander with
[2:23:05] the beast of the field for seven years
[2:23:08] with a beast's mind because he believed
[2:23:10] it was his own power that established
[2:23:12] the babylonian kingdom in daniel 4 verse
[2:23:15] 30.
[2:23:16] strife korah electioneered for his group
[2:23:19] to take aaron's position as priest but
[2:23:22] god opened the earth to swallow them up
[2:23:24] alive in numbers 16 verses 1 through 50.
[2:23:28] king uzziah did likewise encroaching
[2:23:30] upon a spiritual office not belonging to
[2:23:32] him
[2:23:33] attempting to offer incense to god as a
[2:23:35] priest but the lord smote him with
[2:23:37] leprosy until the day he died according
[2:23:40] to second chronicles 26
[2:23:42] verses 1 through 23
[2:23:44] murder after god rejected cain's
[2:23:47] bloodless self-will offering and
[2:23:50] accepted abel's offering the enraged
[2:23:53] wrathful cain murdered his brother
[2:23:56] to conclude this section consider the
[2:23:58] contrast between eve and jesus's
[2:24:01] threefold temptation in genesis 3 and
[2:24:04] matthew 4 respectively
[2:24:06] both eve and christ were tempted in all
[2:24:08] three categories lust of the flesh
[2:24:11] lust of the eyes pride of life but only
[2:24:14] christ overcame the enemy three times
[2:24:18] in genesis 3 verse 6 eve is tempted with
[2:24:21] the lust of the flesh because the tree
[2:24:23] was good for food she was tempted with
[2:24:25] the lust of the eyes because the tree
[2:24:27] was pleasant to the eyes e fell to the
[2:24:29] pride of life because the tree would
[2:24:31] make her wise
[2:24:33] after her submission to all three
[2:24:34] temptations eve partook of the fruit
[2:24:37] beguiled or wholly seduced and deceived
[2:24:39] by the serpent's subtility god now
[2:24:42] forbids women to preach his word and
[2:24:44] lead his people because eve let down her
[2:24:47] spiritual armor
[2:24:49] matthew 4 verses 1 through 11 details
[2:24:52] satan's greatest temptation ever upon a
[2:24:54] man but his temptation failed because he
[2:24:56] was tempting the righteous god-man
[2:24:59] christ jesus truly no man has ever been
[2:25:02] nor ever could be tempted more fiercely
[2:25:05] than jesus was tempted
[2:25:07] the savior was tempted by satan himself
[2:25:10] not just a lower ranking less powerful
[2:25:12] demon
[2:25:13] additionally christ was hungry after
[2:25:15] fasting for 40 days and his flesh was
[2:25:17] desperately weak yet our lord proved the
[2:25:20] weakest christian overcome satan's
[2:25:22] greatest attacks by quoting the rightly
[2:25:24] divided word of god
[2:25:28] note satan's second temptation
[2:25:30] challenged christ to cast himself down
[2:25:31] from a pinnacle in hopes the angels
[2:25:34] would bear him up
[2:25:35] basically satan urged christ to produce
[2:25:37] a miracle at his own will by misquoting
[2:25:40] scripture psalms 91 verses 10 through
[2:25:43] 12.
[2:25:44] satan deceives many christians by
[2:25:46] misapplying scripture and urging them to
[2:25:48] act upon their own thinking rather than
[2:25:50] god's
[2:25:51] thankfully our lord jesus christ rightly
[2:25:53] divided god's word and quoted
[2:25:55] deuteronomy 6 verse 16 saying it is
[2:25:58] written again thou shalt not tempt the
[2:26:01] lord thy god
[2:26:02] god asks us to prove him in tithes and
[2:26:04] offerings but not in hazarding our lives
[2:26:07] by jumping off colossal buildings to
[2:26:09] show off our power since we have none
[2:26:12] christ's lesson is this you quoting and
[2:26:14] obeying god's word will defeat satan
[2:26:17] himself anytime anywhere any place
[2:26:22] first samuel 4 verses 1 through 22 shows
[2:26:25] the importance of both quoting and
[2:26:27] obeying god's word
[2:26:29] backslidden in israel was quoting god's
[2:26:30] promise given to moses in numbers 10 35
[2:26:35] to save them from their enemies through
[2:26:36] the ark of the covenant of course it was
[2:26:38] obedience to god's presence in the ark
[2:26:41] not just possessing the ark itself that
[2:26:44] gave the victories
[2:26:45] even though the earth rang with israel's
[2:26:47] hopeful shouts for victory
[2:26:50] the philistines easily defeated israel
[2:26:52] because they were living in disobedience
[2:26:54] to god
[2:26:55] quoting part of god's word without
[2:26:57] obeying the whole gets you nowhere
[2:27:01] speak god's word obey it stand upon it
[2:27:04] and watch satan leave you for a season
[2:27:06] just as he temporarily left christ
[2:27:09] never forget that god will not give you
[2:27:11] a temptation too difficult for you to
[2:27:13] conquer
[2:27:14] first corinthians 10 13 says there hath
[2:27:17] no temptation taken you but such as is
[2:27:20] common to man but god is faithful who
[2:27:22] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[2:27:24] that ye are able
[2:27:25] but will with the temptation also make a
[2:27:28] way of escape that ye may be able to
[2:27:30] bear it
[2:27:33] the fruit of temperance
[2:27:35] just as faith is both a character
[2:27:37] quality and fruit of the spirit
[2:27:39] temperance is both as well
[2:27:41] figure 10 lists temperance as a fruit of
[2:27:43] the holy spirit in a mature christian's
[2:27:46] life and is the rarest form of
[2:27:48] temperance found under heaven
[2:27:51] joseph son of jacob displays mature
[2:27:54] temperance by fleeing the sexual
[2:27:56] advances of potiphar's wife in genesis
[2:27:59] 39 verses 7 through 12. joseph was
[2:28:02] around 28 years old at the time of this
[2:28:04] sexual temptation
[2:28:05] he was sold into slavery at 17 years old
[2:28:08] faithfully served potiphar for 11 years
[2:28:10] before being falsely accused and spent
[2:28:13] two years in prison
[2:28:14] after interpreting the butler and
[2:28:16] baker's dreams
[2:28:17] before being exalted to pharaoh's right
[2:28:19] hand at 30 years old
[2:28:21] at the time of the day-by-day sexual
[2:28:23] temptations joseph wasn't married and
[2:28:26] was in the prime of his life when his
[2:28:28] fleshly lusts were at their peak
[2:28:30] given the power and authority joseph had
[2:28:33] he would have known potiphar's schedule
[2:28:34] and had access to privacy in order to
[2:28:37] fulfill the lusts of his flesh
[2:28:39] but joseph overcame the temptation
[2:28:42] how did joseph display such mature
[2:28:44] temperance day after day at such a young
[2:28:46] age
[2:28:47] genesis 39 verse 9 reveals that he
[2:28:49] feared god more than fulfilling the lust
[2:28:52] of the flesh
[2:28:53] he boldly defied the seductress saying
[2:28:56] how then can i do this great wickedness
[2:28:58] and sin against god
[2:29:00] how many church-going men today
[2:29:02] regardless of age would be able to turn
[2:29:04] down a woman constantly begging them for
[2:29:06] sexual pleasure
[2:29:08] joseph's temperance over the lust of the
[2:29:10] flesh strengthens and inspires believers
[2:29:13] of all ages to honor god with their
[2:29:15] bodies for their bodies belong to god
[2:29:19] the apostle paul's writings reveal his
[2:29:21] divine measure of temperance for he says
[2:29:23] christians are temperate in all things
[2:29:25] in first corinthians 9 verses 24 through
[2:29:28] 27 paul uses imagery of athletic games
[2:29:32] similar to the olympics to compare
[2:29:34] christians to professional runners
[2:29:36] just as runners train their bodies
[2:29:37] through self-denial with strenuous
[2:29:39] workouts and strict diets
[2:29:41] christians deny their fleshy lusts and
[2:29:43] strictly control their bodies that they
[2:29:46] might win the incorruptible crown of
[2:29:48] eternal life
[2:29:49] a christian is self-controlled or temper
[2:29:51] in his speech diet spending exercise
[2:29:55] work and every other area of his life
[2:29:59] paul's letter to the philippians shows
[2:30:01] his advanced temperance just two years
[2:30:03] before his martyrdom
[2:30:05] at the time of this letter in 64 a.d
[2:30:07] paul had served jesus for 30 years
[2:30:10] instead of increasing financial
[2:30:11] prosperity paul experienced frequent
[2:30:14] imprisonments and poverty
[2:30:16] christ was stripping him of the pride of
[2:30:18] life and helping him crucify the lusts
[2:30:20] of the flesh
[2:30:21] he rejoiced in the care the philippians
[2:30:24] had shown to his physical needs not
[2:30:26] because he desired gifts but because he
[2:30:28] knew god was going to add rewards to
[2:30:30] their accounts in heaven
[2:30:33] paul admits he was learning contentment
[2:30:35] whether his stomach was full or empty
[2:30:38] it is in this context of hunger pains
[2:30:40] that paul's quoted as saying
[2:30:42] i can do all things through christ which
[2:30:44] strengtheneth me rest assured that
[2:30:46] christ's strength is readily available
[2:30:49] for you
[2:30:50] in times and seasons of suffering and
[2:30:52] want
[2:30:53] you can crucify the lust of the flesh
[2:30:55] lust of the eyes and pride of life
[2:30:57] through christ who strengthens you with
[2:30:59] a measure of his own temperance
[2:31:04] character quality number five patience
[2:31:08] second peter 1 verse 6 reads and to
[2:31:10] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[2:31:12] patience patience is the fifth step on
[2:31:15] your way to godliness a measure or
[2:31:17] portion of holy ghost anointing god
[2:31:19] wants to add to your spirit
[2:31:22] the greek definition of patience is
[2:31:24] steadfastness constancy endurance
[2:31:27] perseverance even in the greatest trials
[2:31:30] and sufferings
[2:31:32] patience is the steadfastness needed to
[2:31:33] be content on god's way
[2:31:36] no matter what tests trials persecutions
[2:31:38] or sufferings you encounter god's
[2:31:41] anointing of divine patience empowers
[2:31:43] you to endure the spiritual battles and
[2:31:46] come forth as a better christian
[2:31:48] right in the middle of your storm or
[2:31:50] test god's patience will hold you
[2:31:52] unwavering in your convictions
[2:31:54] as my friend cadre preaches you are
[2:31:57] tested in order to gain a testimony
[2:32:00] you are confident god allows your test
[2:32:02] to make you more obedient to him job
[2:32:05] knew this fact and proclaimed when he
[2:32:07] god hath tried me i shall come forth as
[2:32:10] gold
[2:32:12] to receive god's divine patience you
[2:32:14] must reject the sin of haste
[2:32:16] in our instant society with instant
[2:32:19] messenger instant pots instant money
[2:32:21] transfers quick fixes and 5g internet
[2:32:25] speeds we have grown accustomed to
[2:32:27] instant gratification
[2:32:29] almost unconsciously our culture teaches
[2:32:31] us impatience
[2:32:33] contrary wise god still teaches his
[2:32:36] children through the same time tested
[2:32:38] method patience
[2:32:40] delays
[2:32:41] waiting
[2:32:42] obstructions
[2:32:44] in fact if god answered every prayer of
[2:32:46] yours instantly you'd only be more
[2:32:48] impatient
[2:32:50] our flesh hates waiting but god knows it
[2:32:52] is the only way we can learn contentment
[2:32:56] additionally the bible states exactly
[2:32:58] when patience is gained in the middle of
[2:33:01] your tribulation
[2:33:02] romans 5 verses 3 and 4 says and not
[2:33:05] only so but we glory and tribulations
[2:33:08] also knowing that tribulation worketh
[2:33:10] patience and patience experience and
[2:33:13] experience hope
[2:33:15] tribulation distress or life's pressures
[2:33:18] accomplish patience when you purposely
[2:33:20] choose to think about god's goodness
[2:33:22] rather than your disappointments
[2:33:24] isaiah 26 3 says
[2:33:27] thou wilt keep him in perfect peace
[2:33:29] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[2:33:31] trusteth in thee
[2:33:33] patience is the outcome of faithfulness
[2:33:36] offering thanksgiving to god while
[2:33:37] praying about your tribulation is being
[2:33:40] faithful
[2:33:41] this accomplishes patience according to
[2:33:42] philippians 4 verses 6 and 7.
[2:33:45] be careful for nothing but in everything
[2:33:47] by prayer and supplication with
[2:33:49] thanksgiving let your request be made
[2:33:52] known unto god and the peace of god
[2:33:54] which passeth all understanding shall
[2:33:56] keep your hearts and minds through
[2:33:58] christ jesus
[2:34:00] a major temptation is making speedy
[2:34:02] decisions without proper prayer counsel
[2:34:05] and contemplation
[2:34:07] decision making in haste and sinful
[2:34:10] urgency is repeatedly condemned in god's
[2:34:12] word particularly in proverbs
[2:34:15] sinners make haste to shed blood
[2:34:18] and a hasty spirit exalteth folly
[2:34:21] too often people quickly praise foolish
[2:34:23] things like famous singers athletes
[2:34:26] politicians and even technological
[2:34:29] advances but jesus says that which is
[2:34:31] highly esteemed among men is an
[2:34:33] abomination in the sight of god
[2:34:36] be careful who or what you praise
[2:34:38] proverbs 29 verse 20 says
[2:34:41] see is thou a man that is hasting his
[2:34:43] words there is more hope of a fool than
[2:34:45] of him
[2:34:46] concerning money never be inpatient for
[2:34:49] riches proverbs 28 verse 22 says he that
[2:34:53] hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and
[2:34:56] considereth not that poverty shall come
[2:34:58] upon him
[2:35:00] israel's first king saul
[2:35:02] lost unimaginable rewards because of
[2:35:05] impatience
[2:35:06] although we know saul was saved samuel
[2:35:08] told saul he would be with him in
[2:35:10] paradise
[2:35:11] he lost out on god's establishing his
[2:35:13] kingdom forever
[2:35:15] because he couldn't wait a few extra
[2:35:17] hours for samuel to arrive and sacrifice
[2:35:20] a burnt offering
[2:35:22] god wasn't asking saul to wait extra
[2:35:24] weeks months or even years
[2:35:27] saul had to wait only a few extra hours
[2:35:29] to the end of the seventh day
[2:35:31] but he failed by forcing himself to
[2:35:33] offer his own burnt offering
[2:35:36] david on the other hand is an example of
[2:35:38] exercising divine patience
[2:35:41] as saul's royal replacement and the man
[2:35:43] god recognized as chasing after his
[2:35:46] heart
[2:35:47] david received god's promise and
[2:35:48] anointing to be king from samuel when he
[2:35:51] was around 15 years old but waited
[2:35:53] around 15 more years in order to inherit
[2:35:56] the promise because he was crowned king
[2:35:57] of hebron at 30 years old
[2:36:00] david's divine patience kept him from
[2:36:02] hastening his ascent to israel's throne
[2:36:05] as he could have killed saul on two
[2:36:07] occasions but would not harm the lord's
[2:36:10] anointed
[2:36:12] during those years of waiting david
[2:36:14] endured death threats from saul his own
[2:36:16] father-in-law
[2:36:17] enduring a fugitive's life
[2:36:20] david wrote many of the psalms during
[2:36:22] these years of waiting even psalms about
[2:36:24] avoiding saul like psalm 18 52 54 57 and
[2:36:30] 59
[2:36:31] david's lesson is to sing to and about
[2:36:34] god in order to increase your patience
[2:36:37] while running for his life divine
[2:36:39] patience anointed david to sing i trust
[2:36:42] in the mercy of god forever and ever i
[2:36:44] will praise thee forever because thou
[2:36:46] has done it and i will wait on thy name
[2:36:49] for it is good before thy saints
[2:36:52] surely if david could joyfully sing to
[2:36:54] god with patience for deliverance
[2:36:56] waiting upon god's name with a bounty on
[2:36:59] his head you can worship and praise
[2:37:01] jesus name in the midst of your trial
[2:37:07] job the patience poster child
[2:37:11] the bible teaches job is the prime
[2:37:13] example of patience you could call him
[2:37:15] the poster child for unwavering
[2:37:17] steadfastness
[2:37:19] james 5 verse 11 says behold we count
[2:37:21] them happy which endure ye have heard of
[2:37:24] the patience of job and have seen the
[2:37:26] end of the lord that the lord is very
[2:37:28] pitiful and of tender
[2:37:30] mercy most know job was the richest and
[2:37:33] wisest man in the east as men sat at his
[2:37:36] feet awaiting his counsel as they would
[2:37:38] wait upon a chief and king
[2:37:40] job manifest patience with god and the
[2:37:43] tragic events of his life after
[2:37:44] suffering the excruciating loss of his
[2:37:46] livestock
[2:37:48] children and personal health
[2:37:50] his intense physical suffering with open
[2:37:52] skin sores from his head to his feet
[2:37:55] lasted for months and caused sleepless
[2:37:57] nights
[2:37:59] patient job endures the false accusation
[2:38:02] of his three friends before god himself
[2:38:04] descends in a whirlwind to humble job by
[2:38:07] asking him over 60 questions without
[2:38:09] directly answering job's questions god's
[2:38:12] first question is as unanswerable as the
[2:38:14] rest asking where waste thou when i laid
[2:38:17] the foundations of the earth declare if
[2:38:20] thou has understanding
[2:38:22] most importantly god's visit brings job
[2:38:25] to repentance and a greater appreciation
[2:38:27] and respect for the almighty god
[2:38:29] soon after the lord restored job's
[2:38:31] family and possessions blessing the
[2:38:33] latter end of job more than his
[2:38:35] beginning
[2:38:37] scripture records that job's great
[2:38:39] victory was his integrity because he did
[2:38:41] not speak evil things against god even
[2:38:44] resisting his wife's urge for him to
[2:38:46] curse god
[2:38:47] job's patient words in the midst of
[2:38:49] suffering revealed his patient heart
[2:38:51] jesus says evil words defile a person
[2:38:54] because the words originate from the
[2:38:56] heart
[2:38:56] matthew 12 34 says for out of the
[2:38:59] abundance of the heart the mouth
[2:39:00] speaketh
[2:39:02] let god add divine patience to your
[2:39:04] heart and you will speak patient words
[2:39:06] amidst your sufferings like job did
[2:39:08] amidst his
[2:39:12] the patience of the prophets
[2:39:14] james 5 verse 10 speaks about prophets
[2:39:16] being our examples for patience saying
[2:39:18] take my brethren the prophets who have
[2:39:20] spoken in the name of the lord for an
[2:39:22] example of suffering affliction and of
[2:39:25] patience
[2:39:27] examples abound of patient prophets that
[2:39:29] will strengthen your faith
[2:39:31] you probably heard that abraham waited
[2:39:33] 25 years between the time god promised
[2:39:35] him a son and the time when isaac was
[2:39:37] born
[2:39:39] the ark building prophet noah spent at
[2:39:40] least 55 years building the ark although
[2:39:43] he may have worked for up to 120 years
[2:39:46] either way god's warning to noah kept
[2:39:48] him patiently working for multiple
[2:39:50] decades on the ark to the saving of his
[2:39:53] house
[2:39:54] at 80 years old moses delivered israel
[2:39:56] out of the egyptian bondage but he first
[2:39:59] waited 40 years in midian after smiting
[2:40:01] an egyptian before god visited him at
[2:40:04] the burning bush
[2:40:06] have you considered the prophet hosea's
[2:40:08] patience after god commanded him to
[2:40:10] marry a harlot hosea's first thought may
[2:40:12] have been how can god ask me a
[2:40:14] distinguished holy prophet to marry a
[2:40:17] defiled filthy
[2:40:19] yet hosea faithfully obeyed endured the
[2:40:22] public shame trusting god's plan as he
[2:40:24] took gomer as his wife
[2:40:26] the lord said hosea's wife had to be a
[2:40:28] wife of whoredoms and children of
[2:40:31] whoredoms
[2:40:32] not only was gomer a but her
[2:40:34] family members were known for their
[2:40:36] whoredoms
[2:40:38] despite having three children together
[2:40:40] jezreel laura hama and loamy jose's
[2:40:44] patience was again tested when gomer
[2:40:46] left him and committed adultery
[2:40:48] living with another man
[2:40:50] but hosea was patient because he knew
[2:40:52] god ordained his marriage to represent
[2:40:54] unfaithful israel's constant rebellion
[2:40:56] and god's merciful forgiveness hosea
[2:40:59] followed the word of the lord and
[2:41:00] redeemed gomer out of slavery for 15
[2:41:03] pieces of silver and barley to signify
[2:41:06] god's redeeming love through jesus
[2:41:08] christ laying his life down for both the
[2:41:11] lost sheep of israel and the other sheep
[2:41:13] the gentiles
[2:41:16] one final patience example is the
[2:41:18] prophet joseph son of jacob and rachel
[2:41:21] after being sold into slavery by his
[2:41:22] brothers at 17 years of age joseph
[2:41:25] faithfully served potiphar for 11 years
[2:41:27] before being falsely accused and
[2:41:29] imprisoned for trying to commit adultery
[2:41:32] with potiphar's wife
[2:41:34] while in prison the word of god came to
[2:41:36] joseph about the destinies of the butler
[2:41:38] and baker but the restored butler forgot
[2:41:40] to mention joseph to pharaoh
[2:41:43] finally after waiting two years joseph
[2:41:45] was released from prison when another
[2:41:46] interpretation came to him about
[2:41:48] pharaoh's dream regarding seven years of
[2:41:51] plenty and seven years of famine
[2:41:53] psalm 105 verse 19 says joseph was in
[2:41:56] prison until the time that his word came
[2:41:59] the word of the lord tried him
[2:42:03] like joseph's life god's promised word
[2:42:05] always tries or tests believers
[2:42:07] scripture lists patience as the second
[2:42:09] step in the order to receive a promise
[2:42:11] from god
[2:42:12] first you must do the will of god
[2:42:14] obeying his command
[2:42:16] second you must be patient
[2:42:18] lastly you will receive the promise
[2:42:20] hebrews 10 38 validates this order
[2:42:22] saying for ye have need of patience that
[2:42:25] after you have done the will of god you
[2:42:27] might receive the promise
[2:42:29] you and i must follow joseph's example
[2:42:32] along with all those faithful saints who
[2:42:34] have inherited god's promises
[2:42:36] hebrews 6 verse 12 states that ye be not
[2:42:40] slothful but followers of them who
[2:42:42] through faith and patience inherit the
[2:42:44] promises
[2:42:47] character quality number six godliness
[2:42:51] second peter 1 verse 6 says
[2:42:53] and to knowledge temperance and to
[2:42:54] temperance patience and the patience
[2:42:57] godliness
[2:42:59] godliness is the sixth character trait
[2:43:01] the lord adds to your being during the
[2:43:02] second stage of sanctification
[2:43:05] this is the general measure or portion
[2:43:07] of godliness all christians receive
[2:43:09] before being born again by charity or
[2:43:11] the holy ghost
[2:43:14] the measure or character quality of
[2:43:15] godliness is distinct from the state of
[2:43:17] mature godliness the mystery of
[2:43:19] godliness paul writes about that jesus
[2:43:21] christ modeled for us by being
[2:43:23] completely loyal and obedient to every
[2:43:25] command of god
[2:43:27] figure 13 details this understanding in
[2:43:30] the third stage
[2:43:32] you will be most like god after being
[2:43:33] born again and experiencing years of
[2:43:36] learning and conforming to god's word
[2:43:38] you will most please and obey god after
[2:43:41] seasons of suffering for it is through
[2:43:43] suffering you will learn to obey god
[2:43:45] according to hebrews 5 verse 8
[2:43:48] though he were a son yet he learned
[2:43:50] obedience by the things which he
[2:43:51] suffered
[2:43:52] christ suffered great temptations but
[2:43:55] learned to obey his father during those
[2:43:57] seasons
[2:43:58] the sufferings of god's son helped him
[2:44:00] declare the singular statement his holy
[2:44:03] lips alone could utter
[2:44:04] for i always do those things that please
[2:44:07] him
[2:44:09] figure 13 three stages and the stature
[2:44:12] of a perfect man
[2:44:14] first stage justification faith of the
[2:44:17] stature of perfect man
[2:44:19] second stage sanctification virtue
[2:44:22] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[2:44:24] brotherly kindness
[2:44:25] in the statue of a perfect man
[2:44:27] third stage the baptism of the holy
[2:44:29] ghost
[2:44:30] charity in the statue of perfect man
[2:44:32] which produces the fruits of the holy
[2:44:34] spirit
[2:44:35] this stage is also known as adoption
[2:44:38] mature godliness one who has kept the
[2:44:40] faith or fought a good fight
[2:44:43] the fact that godliness is the sixth
[2:44:45] character quality is significant because
[2:44:47] it relates to man being created by god
[2:44:49] on the sixth day of creation according
[2:44:51] to genesis 1 verses 24 through 31
[2:44:55] both sixes represent godliness upon god
[2:44:58] creating adam he immediately possessed
[2:44:59] godliness he was sinless with dominion
[2:45:02] over all creatures and over all the
[2:45:04] earth adam was so much like god as an
[2:45:07] amateur god by god's own design
[2:45:10] recognizing god's desire for adam to be
[2:45:12] godly you can understand god's desire
[2:45:14] for you to take dominion over your life
[2:45:17] paul says you have this spiritual right
[2:45:19] in romans 5 verse 17 because you reign
[2:45:22] in life by one jesus christ
[2:45:26] what do you specifically reign over
[2:45:28] demonic powers and temptations
[2:45:30] paul says you wrestle against
[2:45:32] principalities against powers against
[2:45:35] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[2:45:37] against spiritual wickedness in high
[2:45:39] places
[2:45:40] your enemies are unseen demonic
[2:45:42] influences and you constantly defeat
[2:45:44] them through the whole armor of god as
[2:45:46] you cast down imaginations and every
[2:45:49] high thing that exalts itself against
[2:45:50] the knowledge of god and bringing into
[2:45:53] captivity every thought to the obedience
[2:45:55] of christ
[2:45:56] satan and his demons must flee from you
[2:45:59] as you quote god's word through your
[2:46:00] lips and refuse their temptations
[2:46:04] as you exalt god's word in your mind and
[2:46:06] obey his commands you subdue demonic
[2:46:08] powers and reign over sin
[2:46:10] the flesh the world and satan
[2:46:15] godly behavior towards sinners and
[2:46:17] enemies
[2:46:18] in his sermon on the mount the lord
[2:46:20] jesus christ teaches exactly what he
[2:46:22] requires for us to obtain godliness
[2:46:24] and it centers around how we treat
[2:46:26] sinners and unbelievers believers must
[2:46:28] reject the sin of irreverence toward
[2:46:31] sinners and unbelievers
[2:46:33] god is good to sinners and so must we do
[2:46:36] likewise
[2:46:37] to be perfect even as your father which
[2:46:39] is in heaven is perfect jesus asks us to
[2:46:42] love bless
[2:46:43] do good too and pray for our enemies
[2:46:46] muse on matthew 5 verses 43-48
[2:46:50] ye have heard that it hath been said
[2:46:52] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate an
[2:46:54] enemy but i say unto you love your
[2:46:57] enemies bless them to curse you and do
[2:46:59] good to them that hate you and pray for
[2:47:01] them which despitefully use you and
[2:47:02] persecute you
[2:47:04] that ye may be the children of your
[2:47:05] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[2:47:08] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[2:47:09] good and sendeth reign on the just and
[2:47:12] on the unjust
[2:47:13] for if you love them which love you what
[2:47:15] reward have ye
[2:47:17] do not even the publicans the same and
[2:47:19] if ye salute your brethren only what do
[2:47:22] ye more than others
[2:47:23] do not even the public and so be
[2:47:26] therefore perfect even as your father
[2:47:28] which is in heaven is perfect
[2:47:31] being a christian anointed with divine
[2:47:33] godliness makes you compassionate
[2:47:35] towards the lost and unbelievers
[2:47:37] if you are like god you will hope for
[2:47:39] all men to be saved although you know
[2:47:41] few will be saved
[2:47:43] peter says god is not willing that any
[2:47:45] should perish while paul says god wishes
[2:47:47] all men to be saved
[2:47:49] ezekiel 33 verse 11 states clearly god
[2:47:52] does not delight in the death of sinners
[2:47:54] as i live saith the lord god i have no
[2:47:57] pleasure in the death of the wicked but
[2:47:58] that the wicked turn from his way and
[2:48:00] live
[2:48:01] turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for
[2:48:04] why will ye die o house of israel
[2:48:07] examples abound of the righteous hoping
[2:48:10] and desiring for sinners to be saved
[2:48:12] which is a true expression of godliness
[2:48:15] paul says he had great heaviness and
[2:48:17] continual sorrow in his heart wishing he
[2:48:19] could be cursed instead of his israeli
[2:48:21] brethren who had rejected christ as
[2:48:23] messiah
[2:48:25] stephen the first christian martyr
[2:48:27] loudly asked jesus to lay not this sin
[2:48:29] to their charge as jews stone him to
[2:48:32] death
[2:48:32] our lord jesus during his crucifixion
[2:48:34] uttered forgiveness to his mockers as
[2:48:37] some of his final words before his death
[2:48:39] saying
[2:48:40] father forgive them for they know not
[2:48:42] what they do
[2:48:45] ezekiel 9 verses 1 through 11 records a
[2:48:47] remarkable instance of god
[2:48:49] sparing a small remnant of israeli
[2:48:51] believers from his wrath against
[2:48:53] jerusalem
[2:48:54] this faithful remnant was spared because
[2:48:56] they sighed and cried for all the
[2:48:57] abominations done in israel
[2:49:00] not only does true godliness separate
[2:49:02] you from fellowshipping with sinners and
[2:49:04] despising their choices but it also
[2:49:06] makes you weep and sigh in your private
[2:49:09] prayers to god
[2:49:10] godliness makes you so burdened and
[2:49:12] concerned about others destinies that
[2:49:14] you cry and plead with god to show mercy
[2:49:16] on the disobedient and unholy david
[2:49:19] experiences this burden in psalms 119
[2:49:22] verse 136 saying rivers of water run
[2:49:25] down mine eyes because they have not
[2:49:27] kept thy law
[2:49:29] historically ezekiel's vision is
[2:49:31] fulfilled in second chronicles 36 verses
[2:49:34] 17-20 as nebuchadnezzar's babylonian
[2:49:38] forces slay many carry others away into
[2:49:40] slavery burn the house of god and break
[2:49:43] down the wall of the city
[2:49:46] the anointing of godliness is given so
[2:49:48] it can lead you to show mercy or
[2:49:50] pronounce judgment according to god's
[2:49:52] leadership but prepare to rule your
[2:49:54] heart by being slow to anger just as god
[2:49:57] is slow to anger in matthew 5 verse 7
[2:50:00] jesus says blessed are the merciful for
[2:50:02] they shall obtain mercy
[2:50:04] wisdom teaches you to begin with
[2:50:06] merciful gracious words for sinners and
[2:50:09] enemies
[2:50:10] there were times jesus was very harsh
[2:50:12] and judgmental towards sinners such as
[2:50:15] with the scribes and pharisees in
[2:50:16] matthew chapter 23
[2:50:18] but christ's mercy and forgiveness is
[2:50:20] what we admire and worship him for
[2:50:22] paul god's minister to the gentiles
[2:50:25] issues harsh judgment but shifts to
[2:50:27] gracious mercy within a matter of a few
[2:50:29] sentences
[2:50:30] in second timothy 4 verses 14-18
[2:50:34] the apostle says the lord will reward
[2:50:36] alexander the coppersmith for all the
[2:50:38] evil works he committed against him but
[2:50:40] two verses later praise for god to not
[2:50:43] lay a charge to those men who forsook
[2:50:45] him a godly person is so near to god's
[2:50:48] heart through constant prayer that god
[2:50:50] leads him to speak god's will in every
[2:50:52] situation
[2:50:54] godliness tells your heart to trust in
[2:50:56] and wait upon god before making a
[2:50:58] judgment for he has mercy on whom he
[2:51:00] will have mercy and delighteth in mercy
[2:51:06] character quality number seven brotherly
[2:51:08] kindness
[2:51:09] second peter 1 verse 7 says and to
[2:51:12] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[2:51:14] broadly kindness charity
[2:51:16] brotherly kindness is the seventh
[2:51:18] character trait the lord adds to your
[2:51:19] being during the second stage of
[2:51:21] sanctification this is the final
[2:51:23] character quality or portion of
[2:51:25] anointing christians receive before
[2:51:28] being born again by charity or the holy
[2:51:30] ghost
[2:51:32] the greek word for brotherly kindness is
[2:51:34] philadelphia meaning love of brothers or
[2:51:37] sisters the love which christians
[2:51:39] cherish for each other as brethren
[2:51:41] christianity puts a great emphasis on
[2:51:43] serving its members as paul says as we
[2:51:47] have therefore opportunity let us do
[2:51:48] good unto all men especially unto them
[2:51:51] who are of the household of faith
[2:51:53] our lord jesus says love among
[2:51:55] christians is the primary way sinners
[2:51:57] will recognize christians are jesus's
[2:52:00] true disciples
[2:52:01] you are a true disciple of jesus when
[2:52:03] you fervently love other christians
[2:52:07] brotherly kindness is the last character
[2:52:09] quality before a christian is born again
[2:52:11] and makes him focus on his christian
[2:52:13] brothers and sisters more than himself
[2:52:16] it is as if god is saying i've
[2:52:18] graciously built you up into a godly
[2:52:20] spiritual being
[2:52:21] but before i officially adopt you into
[2:52:23] my family by the seal of the holy ghost
[2:52:25] i'm giving you brotherly kindness so you
[2:52:27] will serve and love my other children i
[2:52:30] have adopted god is not going to birth a
[2:52:33] child into his kingdom without first
[2:52:35] adding brotherly kindness for that
[2:52:37] person would not be kind to the rest of
[2:52:39] the body of christ it's easy to see why
[2:52:41] christians must reject the sin of
[2:52:43] selfishness in order to receive the
[2:52:45] anointing of brotherly kindness
[2:52:48] jesus prophesies love among mankind is
[2:52:51] going to continually decrease as his
[2:52:53] second coming approaches
[2:52:55] matthew 24 verse 12 says and because
[2:52:58] iniquity shall bound the love of many
[2:53:00] shall wax cold
[2:53:02] you will see less and less brotherly
[2:53:03] kindness in the world
[2:53:05] iniquity and unconfessed sins are
[2:53:07] causing love to decrease
[2:53:09] paul prophesies where love is being
[2:53:11] directed in the last days saying men
[2:53:13] will be lovers of their own selves and
[2:53:15] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[2:53:18] god
[2:53:19] but paul also prays for an increase in
[2:53:21] love among christians that you can
[2:53:23] fulfill in first thessalonians 3 verse
[2:53:26] 12
[2:53:27] and the lord make you to increase and
[2:53:29] bound in love one toward another and
[2:53:31] toward all men even as we do toward you
[2:53:35] let the world decrease its love while
[2:53:37] you choose to increase your brotherly
[2:53:39] love
[2:53:42] locating and living for your christian
[2:53:44] family
[2:53:45] the character trait of brotherly
[2:53:46] kindness inspires a believer to locate
[2:53:49] and live for his christian family
[2:53:51] locating and joining a christian church
[2:53:52] family is an important part of serving
[2:53:55] god
[2:53:56] jesus modeled faithful church attendance
[2:53:57] for christians to imitate
[2:54:00] according to luke 4 verses 14 through 17
[2:54:03] christ's custom or habit was to be in
[2:54:05] the synagogue on the sabbath day
[2:54:08] make it your custom to be gathered in
[2:54:09] public worship with other christians
[2:54:11] every sunday as modeled by paul and the
[2:54:14] ephesians in acts 20 verse 7
[2:54:17] and upon the first day of the week when
[2:54:18] the disciples came together to break
[2:54:20] bread
[2:54:21] paul preached unto them ready to depart
[2:54:23] on the morrow and continued his speech
[2:54:26] until midnight
[2:54:28] just as every sheep needs a flock and a
[2:54:30] shepherd every christian needs a church
[2:54:32] family and pastor
[2:54:34] jesus was moved with compassion when he
[2:54:36] saw multitudes of people without pastors
[2:54:39] and urged his disciples to pray for the
[2:54:41] lord to send laborers into his harvest
[2:54:44] shortly after his resurrection and
[2:54:45] ascension to heaven jesus sent five
[2:54:48] preaching gifts to the church one of
[2:54:50] which is the pastor
[2:54:51] along with the preaching gifts of the
[2:54:53] apostle prophet teacher and evangelist
[2:54:55] the pastor gift benefits the church by
[2:54:58] equipping its members for their
[2:54:59] individual ministries teaching precise
[2:55:02] truth and promoting unity
[2:55:05] the fivefold preaching ministry also
[2:55:07] protects believers from immaturity doubt
[2:55:10] hesitation and deception
[2:55:13] you can live for your christian church
[2:55:15] family in at least five ways
[2:55:17] first broadly kindness moves believers
[2:55:19] to meet the physical needs of other
[2:55:20] christians
[2:55:22] the early christians provided daily food
[2:55:23] for poor widows and james says genuine
[2:55:26] faith moves a true christian to provide
[2:55:29] clothes and food for needy christians
[2:55:32] meeting physical needs is such a
[2:55:33] heartfelt act in jesus sight that he
[2:55:36] will grant eternal life as a reward for
[2:55:39] individuals who demonstrate six
[2:55:41] different acts of compassion upon his
[2:55:43] brethren or other christians according
[2:55:45] to matthew 25 verses 31-46
[2:55:49] in philippians 2 verses 3 and 4 paul
[2:55:52] teaches christians to have a lowliness
[2:55:54] of mind so they can esteem others better
[2:55:56] than themselves this humility causes us
[2:55:59] to look not every man on his own things
[2:56:01] but every man also on the things of
[2:56:03] others
[2:56:04] brotherly kindness causes you to
[2:56:06] consider others needs more important
[2:56:08] than your own as you train your eyes to
[2:56:10] focus on others more than yourself
[2:56:14] second broadly kindness promotes radical
[2:56:17] forgiveness towards fellow christians
[2:56:20] matthew 18 verses 21-35 details jesus's
[2:56:24] attitude towards forgiveness
[2:56:26] peter asked jesus if he should forgive
[2:56:28] his brother seven times but christ says
[2:56:31] to multiply that estimate by seventy
[2:56:34] after this astounding news peter and the
[2:56:35] rest of the apostles say lord increase
[2:56:37] our faith
[2:56:38] in luke's parallel passage
[2:56:40] in matthew 18 the parable of the
[2:56:42] unmerciful servant follows
[2:56:44] and jesus teaches us god's forgiveness
[2:56:47] of our sin debts are so great that we
[2:56:49] should freely forgive those who sin
[2:56:51] against us because their sin debts are
[2:56:53] tiny in comparison
[2:56:55] the divine lesson is to continually
[2:56:57] forgive your brother and sister just as
[2:56:59] christ continually forgives you all your
[2:57:01] trespasses
[2:57:03] paul's letter to philemon expresses
[2:57:05] paul's request for philemon to offer
[2:57:08] generous forgiveness to onesimus
[2:57:10] philemon's former slave
[2:57:13] onesimus had been an unprofitable
[2:57:15] servant to philemon and owed him money
[2:57:18] while wronging him
[2:57:20] paul writes that he led onesimus to
[2:57:22] salvation in christ and the new convert
[2:57:24] is now profitable for both men
[2:57:27] the apostle implores philemon to receive
[2:57:29] onesimus as a brother laying any debt on
[2:57:32] paul's account which he promises to
[2:57:34] repay to philemon
[2:57:36] when you offer a brother or sister a
[2:57:38] second chance you are expressing
[2:57:40] brotherly kindness
[2:57:43] thirdly increasing the number of
[2:57:44] gatherings with christians is an
[2:57:46] attribute of brotherly kindness in
[2:57:48] hebrews 10 verses 24 through 25 paul
[2:57:52] teaches us to assemble ourselves
[2:57:53] together so much the more as he see that
[2:57:56] day approaching
[2:57:58] during our increasing number of visits
[2:58:00] christians will provoke or stimulate
[2:58:02] each other to do good deeds
[2:58:04] and provide exhortation or encouragement
[2:58:08] additionally seek to spend time with the
[2:58:10] least esteemed or less popular
[2:58:12] christians
[2:58:13] paul pens romans 12 16 saying
[2:58:17] be of the same mind one toward another
[2:58:19] mind not high things but condescend to
[2:58:22] men of low estate be not wise in your
[2:58:25] own conceits
[2:58:26] when you're at a church fellowship find
[2:58:28] the ones who have no one to talk to and
[2:58:31] begin pleasant conversations with them
[2:58:33] you can also host your own fellowship
[2:58:35] and jesus promises to bless you when you
[2:58:37] invite the poor
[2:58:39] the maimed the lame
[2:58:41] the blind because they cannot repay you
[2:58:45] fourth christians offer broadly kindness
[2:58:47] with impartiality regardless of
[2:58:50] socioeconomic status
[2:58:52] carnal christians exalt rich church
[2:58:54] members above the poor members
[2:58:56] but james tells christians it's a sin to
[2:58:58] be partial to rich christians who have
[2:59:01] expensive jewelry and clothing by
[2:59:03] offering them comfort and rest with the
[2:59:05] best seats while making others stand in
[2:59:08] a church assembly
[2:59:11] fifth broadly kindness leads christians
[2:59:13] to pray for one another ephesians 6
[2:59:15] verse 18 says a fully armored christian
[2:59:18] is praying always with all prayer and
[2:59:20] supplication in the spirit and watching
[2:59:23] there unto with all perseverance and
[2:59:25] supplication for all saints pray for all
[2:59:28] christians near and far
[2:59:30] when you hear of christians suffering
[2:59:31] persecution you feel their pain and care
[2:59:34] enough to pray for them
[2:59:36] first corinthians 12 verses 25 and 26
[2:59:39] reads
[2:59:40] that there should be no schism in the
[2:59:41] body but that the member should have the
[2:59:43] same care one for another and whether
[2:59:46] one member suffer all the members suffer
[2:59:48] with it or one member be honored all the
[2:59:51] members rejoice with it
[2:59:54] to conclude brotherly kindness notice it
[2:59:56] is the seventh and last trait before
[2:59:58] charity caps off your being
[3:00:01] seven is a scriptural number
[3:00:02] representing completion and in this case
[3:00:05] brotherly kindness signifies a
[3:00:06] christian's complete sanctification or
[3:00:09] cleansing psalm 12 verse 6 teaches
[3:00:11] complete purification comes through
[3:00:14] seven steps
[3:00:15] the words of the lord are pure words as
[3:00:18] silver tried in a furnace of earth
[3:00:20] purified seven times
[3:00:22] brotherly kindness completes your
[3:00:24] purification as you graduate to charity
[3:00:27] the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:00:32] character quality number eight charity
[3:00:35] second peter 1 verse 7 says and to
[3:00:38] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[3:00:40] brotherly kindness charity
[3:00:42] charity is the eighth and final
[3:00:44] character trait the lord adds to your
[3:00:45] being as you enter the third and final
[3:00:48] stage of your christian walk
[3:00:50] resistance is the sin you must reject to
[3:00:52] receive charity as stephen said in acts
[3:00:55] 7 verse 51 ye do always resist the holy
[3:00:58] ghost
[3:01:00] this section is purposely shortened
[3:01:02] because the proceeding chapter is fully
[3:01:04] devoted to the third stage or baptism of
[3:01:06] the holy ghost see figure 13
[3:01:09] although this is the last stage is the
[3:01:11] greatest stage because you experience
[3:01:13] sealing adoption fruit bearing and a
[3:01:16] state of mature godliness
[3:01:18] the first two stages justification and
[3:01:20] sanctification prepare you for service
[3:01:24] the third stage puts you into service
[3:01:28] the greek word for charity is agape
[3:01:30] meaning brotherly love affection good
[3:01:32] will love
[3:01:34] benevolence
[3:01:36] agape love is a greater love than
[3:01:37] brotherly kindness it's a permanent
[3:01:39] portion of god's divine love living in
[3:01:42] you
[3:01:42] in fact it is a larger measure of god's
[3:01:44] own spirit coming down to live inside
[3:01:47] your soul because first john 4 8 says
[3:01:50] god is love
[3:01:52] follow these next thoughts to understand
[3:01:54] how god love the baptism of the holy
[3:01:57] ghost and charity are all synonymous
[3:02:00] god is the holy ghost because jesus says
[3:02:03] god is a spirit or ghost and there is
[3:02:06] only one spirit
[3:02:07] the holy ghost is jesus's promise to his
[3:02:10] disciples in acts 1 verse 5.
[3:02:12] for john truly baptized with water but
[3:02:15] ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[3:02:17] not many days hence
[3:02:19] jesus originates the baptism of the holy
[3:02:21] ghost doctrine
[3:02:23] furthermore the baptism of the holy
[3:02:24] ghost is love because paul says the love
[3:02:27] of god is shed abroad in your hearts by
[3:02:29] the holy ghost
[3:02:31] peter supports paul's claims saying this
[3:02:34] promise of the father or baptism of the
[3:02:36] holy ghost promised by jesus was shed
[3:02:39] forth on the day of pentecost in acts 2
[3:02:41] verse 33
[3:02:43] both love and the holy ghost were shed
[3:02:45] forth on the day of pentecost because
[3:02:47] they are one and the same
[3:02:49] the entire chapter of first corinthians
[3:02:51] 13 describes the effect of charity or
[3:02:54] love or the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:02:57] upon your soul
[3:02:59] since charity is the last character
[3:03:01] quality the eighth out of eight
[3:03:03] charity is the marking or sealing of
[3:03:05] christ's character inside your being
[3:03:08] called a seal in three scriptures
[3:03:10] second corinthians 1 verse 22 ephesians
[3:03:13] 1 verse 13
[3:03:15] and ephesians 4 30.
[3:03:17] the eighth character quality seals god's
[3:03:19] spirit of love into your being
[3:03:21] specifically into your soul the person
[3:03:24] of love jesus christ now abides in your
[3:03:27] soul because you've been conformed into
[3:03:28] christ's image and learned to love and
[3:03:31] serve both enemies and god's family
[3:03:35] having the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:03:37] seals the previous seven character
[3:03:39] qualities into your soul
[3:03:41] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[3:03:43] patience godliness and brotherly
[3:03:45] kindness
[3:03:46] you are finally ready to start living
[3:03:49] the longer you live in obedience the
[3:03:51] more mature godliness you will manifest
[3:03:53] in your flesh
[3:03:57] three stages or works of grace
[3:04:00] figures 11 and 12 show how the three
[3:04:02] stages of israel's journey from egypt to
[3:04:05] the promised land is allegorical to the
[3:04:07] christian's journey from faith to the
[3:04:09] baptism of the holy ghost or charity the
[3:04:12] three stages have also been called the
[3:04:15] three works of grace in some christian
[3:04:17] circles
[3:04:18] while works of grace may sound like a
[3:04:20] contradiction the bible teaches that
[3:04:22] god's grace causes christians to work
[3:04:24] for god
[3:04:25] the three works are god's works in a
[3:04:27] surrendered believer the believer simply
[3:04:29] surrenders or yields to god's works
[3:04:33] as paul says in philippians 2 13 it is
[3:04:36] god which worketh in you
[3:04:38] a repentant christian recognizes god's
[3:04:40] goodness making him love god this love
[3:04:43] motivates faith in god and faith
[3:04:45] produces works
[3:04:48] second corinthians 6 verse 1 says we
[3:04:50] then as workers together with him
[3:04:53] beseech you also that ye receive not the
[3:04:55] grace of god in vain
[3:04:57] paul urges you to work with god not
[3:05:00] alone
[3:05:01] in fact god cannot work through a human
[3:05:03] without him allowing it through
[3:05:04] submitted free moral agency
[3:05:07] if god alone is working
[3:05:09] then humans are mere choiceless robots
[3:05:12] but you know that's not the case
[3:05:14] it is also implied christians work
[3:05:16] because they have received the gift of
[3:05:17] grace
[3:05:18] an individual claiming to be a christian
[3:05:20] without works has not truly received
[3:05:22] god's grace
[3:05:25] paul again says he did not receive god's
[3:05:27] grace in vain in first corinthians 15
[3:05:29] verse 10.
[3:05:31] as humbly as possible paul says he
[3:05:33] worked more than all the apostles
[3:05:35] including peter and james
[3:05:37] he attributes his vast works to grace
[3:05:39] being with him saying
[3:05:41] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[3:05:44] and his grace which was bestowed upon me
[3:05:46] was not in vain but i labored more
[3:05:48] abundantly than they all yet not i but
[3:05:52] the grace of god which was with me
[3:05:54] grace god's unmerited favor to you has
[3:05:58] always been and always will be your pure
[3:06:00] source of motivation
[3:06:03] figure 14 shows eight examples of the
[3:06:05] three works of grace throughout
[3:06:06] scripture
[3:06:07] including man's natural birth and
[3:06:09] spiritual birth
[3:06:11] israel's exodus from egypt
[3:06:13] israel's three-quart tabernacle
[3:06:15] the earth's cleansing
[3:06:17] ezekiel's new heart prophecy
[3:06:20] stages of the wheat plant see chapter
[3:06:22] eight
[3:06:23] and jesus as the way to heaven
[3:06:25] three is god's number of divine
[3:06:26] perfection in design and these examples
[3:06:29] showcase god's perfect design in
[3:06:32] processes
[3:06:34] figure 14 the process of man's natural
[3:06:37] birth
[3:06:38] water breaks
[3:06:40] blood
[3:06:41] breath of life
[3:06:43] the process of man's spiritual birth
[3:06:45] justification sanctification baptism of
[3:06:48] the holy ghost

[3:07:19] way
[3:07:20] truth
[3:07:21] life
[3:07:24] growing in the stature of a perfect man
[3:07:27] the seventh example in figure 14
[3:07:29] identifies the three stages of growth in
[3:07:31] the wheat plant taught by jesus in his
[3:07:34] parable of the seed cast in the ground
[3:07:36] in mark 4 verses 26-29
[3:07:39] notice how the three stages in the
[3:07:41] wheat's maturity match the three stages
[3:07:43] to christian maturity justification
[3:07:45] sanctification and the baptism of the
[3:07:48] holy ghost
[3:07:50] the lord jesus emphasizes the seed grows
[3:07:52] up without man knowing how in mark 4
[3:07:55] verse 27 it is man's duty to plant and
[3:07:58] water the seed but it is god who gives
[3:08:00] the increase
[3:08:01] the same is true with the gospel
[3:08:03] i have planted apollos watered but god
[3:08:06] gave the increase
[3:08:08] so that neither is he that planteth
[3:08:09] anything neither he that watereth but
[3:08:12] god that giveth the increase
[3:08:14] no man causes his own spiritual increase
[3:08:17] in other words you cannot add any
[3:08:19] character quality to yourself such as
[3:08:21] temperance at your own will you must
[3:08:24] confidently trust in god's growing
[3:08:25] process just as a farmer does
[3:08:29] your job is to accept each of god's
[3:08:31] promises by planting each promise in
[3:08:34] your heart
[3:08:35] believe god will add faith then virtue
[3:08:38] and the rest of the character qualities
[3:08:40] then water every seed promise with
[3:08:42] prayer praise bible reading and
[3:08:44] thanksgiving
[3:08:45] in the right season you will see the
[3:08:47] faith blade then the ear of virtue
[3:08:49] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[3:08:52] and brotherly kindness
[3:08:53] last that you'll experience the baptism
[3:08:55] of the holy ghost or full corn at the
[3:08:57] right time
[3:08:59] ecclesiastes 3 verse 11 declares he hath
[3:09:02] made everything beautiful in his time
[3:09:08] knowing your spiritual location
[3:09:11] god has given you the three works of
[3:09:12] grace and peter's eight steps to the
[3:09:14] statue of a perfect man
[3:09:16] so you can assess your current spiritual
[3:09:18] location
[3:09:19] by prayerfully examining your life you
[3:09:21] can know whether you are in the first
[3:09:23] second or third work of grace
[3:09:25] paul commands examine yourselves whether
[3:09:28] you be in the faith prove your own
[3:09:30] selves
[3:09:31] the apostle admonishes you to work out
[3:09:33] your own salvation with fear and
[3:09:35] trembling
[3:09:37] god did the same thing with israel in
[3:09:39] reference to israel's three-stage exodus
[3:09:41] god told both moses and the people he
[3:09:43] was going to take them out of egypt and
[3:09:45] into the promised land of canaan
[3:09:48] the sinai peninsula lay between egypt
[3:09:50] and canaan god was going to use the
[3:09:52] wilderness of shur the wilderness of
[3:09:54] sinai and the wilderness of paran to
[3:09:57] test israel's trust in him the lord
[3:09:59] declared he led israel through the
[3:10:01] wilderness to humble and prove them
[3:10:03] whether they would obey him or not and
[3:10:05] so they would know to live by every word
[3:10:07] of god
[3:10:08] the promised land journey was a
[3:10:09] three-stage process at all times moses
[3:10:12] and the people could easily assess their
[3:10:14] physical location and how close they
[3:10:17] were to their destination
[3:10:20] so can you know at all times your
[3:10:22] spiritual location in christianity are
[3:10:24] you in the first stage seeking to be
[3:10:26] saved out of the world like israel was
[3:10:28] saved out of egypt
[3:10:30] then you can repent and be baptized in
[3:10:32] the name of jesus christ for the
[3:10:34] remission of sins god will bring you
[3:10:36] through the red sea as you joyfully
[3:10:38] dance at the sight of all your dead
[3:10:40] taskmasters or sinful addictions
[3:10:43] are you in the second stage
[3:10:45] having already been saved and baptized
[3:10:47] but going through the wilderness of
[3:10:48] sanctification
[3:10:49] being daily tested and tried as you
[3:10:51] learn to obey then you can examine the
[3:10:53] six character qualities of
[3:10:54] sanctification virtue knowledge
[3:10:57] temperance patience godliness and
[3:10:59] brotherly kindness to assess which ones
[3:11:01] you need added to your life
[3:11:03] ask jesus for his character traits free
[3:11:06] offers
[3:11:07] and all these things whatsoever ye shall
[3:11:09] ask in prayer believing ye shall receive
[3:11:12] are you in the third stage being born
[3:11:14] again of god's spirit and already endued
[3:11:16] with power from on high
[3:11:18] then obey hebrews 12 1 laying aside
[3:11:21] every weight of sin that easily besets
[3:11:23] you and run the race set before you with
[3:11:25] patience
[3:11:26] serve god wholeheartedly die to your
[3:11:29] human desires daily abide in christ the
[3:11:32] word and bring forth much fruit of the
[3:11:34] holy ghost
[3:11:36] based upon jesus teaching that few will
[3:11:38] find the narrow road to eternal life in
[3:11:41] matthew 7 14
[3:11:43] most people will start the christian
[3:11:44] journey but not finish
[3:11:46] like israel leaving egypt many will be
[3:11:48] baptized but will wander in the
[3:11:50] wilderness never possessing the promised
[3:11:52] land or baptism of the holy ghost
[3:11:55] there is no need for christians to
[3:11:56] wander aimlessly in religion
[3:11:58] the stature of a perfect man divinely
[3:12:01] outlines our journey from sinner to holy
[3:12:03] ghost-filled saint
[3:12:05] out of the original group of israelis
[3:12:07] who left egypt only two made it to
[3:12:09] canaan joshua and caleb scripture says
[3:12:12] the majority of them died in the
[3:12:13] wilderness for their rebellion after god
[3:12:16] saved them out of egypt jude 1 5 says i
[3:12:19] will therefore put you in remembrance
[3:12:21] though he once knew this how that the
[3:12:23] lord having saved the people out of the
[3:12:25] land of egypt afterward destroyed them
[3:12:27] that believe not
[3:12:29] if you feel stranded in a rut or you're
[3:12:32] wandering from church to church get down
[3:12:34] to business with god examine the stature
[3:12:36] of a perfect man assessing your true
[3:12:38] character by the word you will find your
[3:12:41] next step as you honestly examine your
[3:12:43] life through meditation
[3:12:44] as david thought upon his ways he turned
[3:12:47] his feet to god's path
[3:12:49] psalm 119 verses 58 through 60 reads i
[3:12:53] entreated thy favor with my whole heart
[3:12:56] be merciful unto me according to thy
[3:12:58] word i thought on my ways and turned my
[3:13:00] feet unto thy testimonies i made haste
[3:13:03] and delayed not to keep thy commandments
[3:13:06] you can do the same it only requires an
[3:13:09] honest and good heart jesus teaches but
[3:13:12] that on the good ground are they which
[3:13:14] in an honest and good heart having heard
[3:13:16] the word keep it and bring forth fruit
[3:13:18] with patience
[3:13:22] jesus's twelve apostles and the stature
[3:13:24] of a perfect man
[3:13:26] jesus 12 apostles are prime examples of
[3:13:29] believers working their way up the
[3:13:31] stature of a perfect man by grace and
[3:13:34] serve as measuring sticks for our lives
[3:13:36] the four gospels reveal the apostles
[3:13:38] journey from faith to brotherly kindness
[3:13:41] in unflattering ways at times so we
[3:13:43] might relate to and learn from them
[3:13:46] the book of acts details the moment they
[3:13:48] receive charity acts 2 verse 4 the
[3:13:51] baptism of the holy ghost
[3:13:53] and its effects upon their lives here
[3:13:56] are examples proving that jesus
[3:13:58] disciples were saved but not born again
[3:14:00] until the holy ghost fell in acts
[3:14:02] chapter 2.
[3:14:03] faith the disciples believed jesus was
[3:14:06] the messiah and their faith led them to
[3:14:08] forsake family and careers to follow
[3:14:10] christ
[3:14:12] virtue
[3:14:13] the disciples possessed virtue allowing
[3:14:15] them to go into cities two by two
[3:14:17] publicly preaching and healing before
[3:14:19] jesus visited the cities
[3:14:21] but they all lost their virtue on the
[3:14:23] night of jesus arrest being scattered
[3:14:25] like sheep through fear of arrest
[3:14:28] excluding judas iscariot the eleven
[3:14:30] disciples and peter in particular never
[3:14:33] lost their faith because jesus prayed
[3:14:35] that their faith would fail not
[3:14:38] knowledge while most jews misunderstood
[3:14:40] jesus's parables and teachings the
[3:14:42] disciples assured jesus they understood
[3:14:45] them but the disciples lacked
[3:14:47] understanding about how men are defiled
[3:14:49] the leaven of the doctrine of the
[3:14:50] pharisees and sadducees
[3:14:52] and jesus's resurrection
[3:14:55] temperance
[3:14:56] the disciples exercised exemplary
[3:14:59] self-control over their sensual desires
[3:15:01] but ten disciples did become indignant
[3:15:04] against james and john when their mother
[3:15:06] asked jesus if her two sons could sit on
[3:15:08] his right and left hand
[3:15:11] patience
[3:15:12] the twelve apostles patiently stayed
[3:15:14] with jesus after many of his disciples
[3:15:16] forsook him knowing christ had eternal
[3:15:18] life but the disciples hastily asked
[3:15:21] jesus to send away the woman of canaan
[3:15:23] who repeatedly cried for jesus to heal
[3:15:25] her vex daughter which request jesus
[3:15:28] miraculously fulfilled
[3:15:30] godliness
[3:15:32] jesus extinguished james and john's
[3:15:35] ungodly desire to call fire down from
[3:15:37] heaven upon the christ rejecting
[3:15:39] samaritans
[3:15:40] peter violently cut off malcus's ear
[3:15:43] trying to defend jesus proving he had
[3:15:45] not received love for his enemies
[3:15:48] brotherly kindness
[3:15:49] multiple times the disciples lacked
[3:15:51] brotherly kindness such as when they
[3:15:53] argued about which of them was greatest
[3:15:55] forbade a brother from casting out
[3:15:57] devils because he didn't follow the
[3:15:58] twelve
[3:15:59] and forbade their christian sisters from
[3:16:01] bringing their infants and toddlers to
[3:16:03] jesus
[3:16:04] peter struggled with jesus's requirement
[3:16:06] to forgive his brother seventy times
[3:16:08] more than he had first estimated
[3:16:11] charity
[3:16:12] after his resurrection jesus breathed on
[3:16:15] his disciples urging them to receive the
[3:16:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[3:16:19] christ used the 50 days from his
[3:16:20] resurrection to pentecost to rebuild the
[3:16:23] disciples character giving them many
[3:16:25] infallible proofs of his resurrection
[3:16:27] for the first forty days and then
[3:16:29] letting them pray for the final 10 days
[3:16:31] in the upper room until they were in one
[3:16:33] accord
[3:16:34] love or charity fell into the disciples
[3:16:37] souls in the day of pentecost
[3:16:39] paul says the love of god is shed abroad
[3:16:41] in our hearts by the holy ghost which is
[3:16:44] given unto us
[3:16:48] joseph's life and the stature of a
[3:16:50] perfect man
[3:16:51] joseph son of jacob and rachel displayed
[3:16:53] and foreshadowed the statue of a perfect
[3:16:56] man in the old testament because he was
[3:16:58] a type of christ and christ's life
[3:17:00] expressed the complete mystery of
[3:17:01] godliness
[3:17:04] joseph's life both displayed the first
[3:17:06] seven steps and foreshadowed the eighth
[3:17:09] step the statue of a perfect man john 7
[3:17:12] verses 37-39
[3:17:15] teaches old testament saints like joseph
[3:17:17] could not receive the baptism of the
[3:17:19] holy ghost eighth step because jesus had
[3:17:22] not yet been raised from the dead
[3:17:24] joseph's character qualities are seen in
[3:17:26] the following examples
[3:17:28] faith
[3:17:29] joseph's faith trusted god's way for his
[3:17:31] life as he unashamedly shared his dreams
[3:17:34] with his family in genesis 37 verses
[3:17:36] 5-11
[3:17:38] virtue
[3:17:39] joseph's virtue or moral strength in
[3:17:41] slavery causes daily work to prosper in
[3:17:44] potiphar's house
[3:17:45] genesis 39 verses 1-3
[3:17:49] knowledge
[3:17:50] joseph's knowledge or understanding
[3:17:53] helped promote him to overseer of all
[3:17:54] potiphar's possessions in his house and
[3:17:57] field
[3:17:58] genesis 39 verses 4-6
[3:18:01] temperance
[3:18:02] joseph's temperance kept him from
[3:18:04] committing adultery with potiphar's wife
[3:18:06] despite her daily seductions
[3:18:08] genesis 39 verses 7-20
[3:18:12] patience
[3:18:13] joseph's patience or contentment allowed
[3:18:15] him to prosper while waiting in prison
[3:18:17] for two full years until the butler
[3:18:19] remembered him and informed pharaoh of
[3:18:22] joseph's spiritual gift of
[3:18:23] interpretation in genesis 41 verses 1-13
[3:18:28] godliness
[3:18:29] joseph's godliness made him so much like
[3:18:31] god that pharaoh knew god's spirit was
[3:18:33] in joseph after god gave him the
[3:18:35] interpretation of pharaoh's dreams in
[3:18:38] genesis 41 verses 14 through 57
[3:18:42] brotherly kindness
[3:18:44] joseph's brotherly kindness led him to
[3:18:46] freely forgive his brothers for selling
[3:18:47] him into slavery because he recognized
[3:18:49] god used their actions to save the world
[3:18:52] from famine
[3:18:53] genesis 45 verses 1-15
[3:18:57] charity
[3:18:58] joseph lovingly embraced his father
[3:19:00] jacob when he came to abide with him in
[3:19:03] egypt genesis 46 verse 29
[3:19:06] this father son embraced foreshadowed
[3:19:08] christians uniting with their loving
[3:19:10] father or charity for father god is love
[3:19:15] recall from chapter 2 that the number 8
[3:19:18] has a significant meaning in scripture
[3:19:20] speaking of a new beginning this chapter
[3:19:23] highlights
[3:19:24] the eight steps in the statue of a
[3:19:25] perfect man that lead to a new beginning
[3:19:28] as paul says any man who is in christ is
[3:19:30] a new creature old things are passed
[3:19:32] away behold all things are become new
[3:19:36] a born-again holy ghost-filled christian
[3:19:38] is a new creature living a new life of
[3:19:41] divine power
[3:19:45] the rewards for receiving the revelation
[3:19:47] of godliness
[3:19:48] those who receive the revelation of
[3:19:50] godliness will be rewarded with
[3:19:51] spiritual fruitfulness in this life and
[3:19:54] an entrance into the heavenly kingdom
[3:19:57] second peter one verse eight says if
[3:19:59] these eight character traits are
[3:20:00] abounding in your life you will be
[3:20:02] fruitful in the knowledge of our lord
[3:20:04] jesus christ
[3:20:06] you will produce the precious christian
[3:20:07] fruit god desires as you daily express
[3:20:10] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[3:20:12] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[3:20:14] and charity with the world around you
[3:20:17] the longer you express these eight
[3:20:19] character qualities the more spiritual
[3:20:21] fruit you will see god produce in your
[3:20:23] life love joy peace long suffering
[3:20:26] gentleness goodness faith meekness and
[3:20:29] temperance
[3:20:30] chapter 8 details the fact that
[3:20:32] spiritual fruitfulness is your goal
[3:20:34] because it is the only kind of heart
[3:20:36] that bears and brings forth fruit unto
[3:20:38] god
[3:20:40] peter further states if you do these
[3:20:42] things the eight character traits you
[3:20:45] shall never fall for so an entrance
[3:20:47] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[3:20:49] into the everlasting kingdom of our lord
[3:20:51] and savior jesus christ
[3:20:53] heaven's door will open for you like it
[3:20:55] did for john in revelation 4 verse 1.
[3:20:58] after this i looked and behold a door
[3:21:00] was opened in heaven and the first voice
[3:21:02] which i heard was as it were a trumpet
[3:21:04] talking with me which said come up
[3:21:06] hither and i will shoot thee things
[3:21:08] which must be hereafter
[3:21:10] do these things peter wrote do faith do
[3:21:13] virtue do knowledge do temperance do
[3:21:16] patience do godliness do brotherly
[3:21:19] kindness do charity
[3:21:21] take action upon god's word to assure
[3:21:24] you'll never fall
[3:21:26] having done these eight things you'll
[3:21:28] possess christ-like character in your
[3:21:30] human spirit and soul which is the only
[3:21:32] thing you are taking with you to the
[3:21:34] next life
[3:21:35] first timothy 6 7 says for we brought
[3:21:38] nothing into this world and it is
[3:21:40] certain we carry nothing out
[3:21:42] your hands won't carry anything out of
[3:21:44] this world but you will be adorned in
[3:21:46] white raiment as you leave this world
[3:21:48] in revelation 3 verse 18 jesus says this
[3:21:51] white raiment or eternal life is
[3:21:53] available now
[3:21:54] your character or life must come from
[3:21:57] jesus christ and it comes through these
[3:21:59] eight character traits
[3:22:01] paul says the souls of sinners will be
[3:22:03] found naked when they die for they
[3:22:05] possess not eternal life or christ-like
[3:22:08] character
[3:22:10] your character produced good works
[3:22:12] inspired by love and grace will meet you
[3:22:15] at the judgment
[3:22:16] paul says this in first timothy 5 verses
[3:22:19] 24 and 25
[3:22:21] some men sins are open beforehand going
[3:22:23] before to judgment and some men they
[3:22:25] follow after
[3:22:27] likewise also the good works of some are
[3:22:29] manifest beforehand and they that are
[3:22:31] otherwise cannot be hid
[3:22:33] either now or later your good works will
[3:22:35] be known the opposite is true for
[3:22:37] sinners but god records all good works
[3:22:40] in the book of life and there is a book
[3:22:42] of remembrance listing the names of
[3:22:44] those who feared him meditated on his
[3:22:46] word and constantly talked about him on
[3:22:48] earth
[3:22:49] malachi 3 verse 16 reads then they that
[3:22:52] feared the lord spake often one to
[3:22:54] another and the lord hearkened and heard
[3:22:56] it and a book of remembrance was written
[3:22:59] before him for them that feared the lord
[3:23:01] and that thought upon his name
[3:23:03] perhaps the angel who visited cornelius
[3:23:06] gazed upon these heavenly books
[3:23:08] for he told him thy prayers and thine
[3:23:10] alms are come up for a memorial before
[3:23:12] god
[3:23:13] choose godliness and heaven will rejoice
[3:23:16] in your good works
[3:23:20] the consequences for rejecting the
[3:23:21] revelation of godliness
[3:23:24] the most serious consequence for
[3:23:25] rejecting godliness is living a life of
[3:23:27] ungodliness resulting in suffering the
[3:23:29] wrath of god after judgment day in the
[3:23:32] lake of fire
[3:23:33] an entrance into the everlasting kingdom
[3:23:35] of christ will not be granted to the
[3:23:37] ungodly
[3:23:39] individuals can still be saved even if
[3:23:41] they reject the revelation of godliness
[3:23:43] faith alone is required for salvation as
[3:23:46] seen in both the old and new testaments
[3:23:48] while under the final moments of the old
[3:23:50] testament the saved thief on the cross
[3:23:52] received salvation by grace through
[3:23:54] faith from christ himself
[3:23:57] in the new testament paul declares a
[3:23:59] believer can be saved even after being
[3:24:01] excommunicated from a christian assembly
[3:24:03] for pridefully committing sexual
[3:24:05] immorality
[3:24:06] of course the excommunicated would be
[3:24:08] driven to saving repentance before his
[3:24:11] death through the god-permitted
[3:24:12] destruction of the flesh at the hands of
[3:24:15] satan
[3:24:17] second peter 1 verse 8 teaches baroness
[3:24:19] and unfruitfulness are consequences to
[3:24:22] rejecting godliness
[3:24:23] a barren christian is one who is
[3:24:25] inactive in the work of god in the greek
[3:24:27] barrenness also means idleness
[3:24:30] jesus compares barren or idol persons as
[3:24:32] those standing in a marketplace who have
[3:24:34] not begun to toil in a vineyard
[3:24:37] without the stature of perfect man you
[3:24:39] are wasting your life instead of
[3:24:40] investing it in laboring for the lord of
[3:24:43] the harvest jesus christ regarding
[3:24:45] unfruitfulness matthew 13 verses 3
[3:24:48] through 9
[3:24:49] and verses 18 through 23 shows there are
[3:24:52] four heart reactions to the gospel of
[3:24:54] christ see chapter eight
[3:24:57] three reactions bring forth no fruit
[3:24:59] letting satan quickly snatch the word
[3:25:01] from your heart
[3:25:02] believing the word for only a while
[3:25:04] before abandoning it
[3:25:06] and allowing cares and pleasures of the
[3:25:08] world to stop god's word from yielding
[3:25:10] fruit
[3:25:12] only the heart that hears the word and
[3:25:13] understands it is fruitful
[3:25:17] peter goes on to say a man without
[3:25:18] godliness is blind and cannot see afar
[3:25:21] off and hath forgotten that he was
[3:25:23] purged from his old sins
[3:25:25] spiritual blindness occurs when a heart
[3:25:27] is hardened to truth and refuses
[3:25:29] repentance and the healing benefits of
[3:25:31] the holy spirit
[3:25:33] blinded eyes see only this earth because
[3:25:35] they are set on worldly pleasures rather
[3:25:37] than heaven above
[3:25:39] paul admonishes you to set your
[3:25:40] affection on things above not on things
[3:25:43] on the earth
[3:25:45] you are racing to heaven looking under
[3:25:47] jesus the author and finisher of our
[3:25:49] faith
[3:25:50] as you gaze upon jesus he tells you to
[3:25:52] continue adding his eight character
[3:25:54] qualities
[3:25:55] placing your eyes upon sin and selling
[3:25:58] out jesus's words can cause you to lose
[3:26:00] some or all of your character qualities
[3:26:03] just as judas sold out christ and fell
[3:26:05] from his bishopric
[3:26:08] those without godliness even forget they
[3:26:11] were purged from old sins
[3:26:13] peter again explains this phenomenon
[3:26:15] saying dearly beloved i beseech you as
[3:26:17] strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[3:26:19] fleshly lusts which war against the soul
[3:26:23] frequent submission to fleshly lusts
[3:26:25] rather than the holy ghost creates a war
[3:26:28] against your soul
[3:26:29] your confused mind doesn't know if your
[3:26:31] soul is saved because your constant
[3:26:33] indulgence in fleshly lusts makes you
[3:26:36] feel like the flesh is winning the war
[3:26:38] additionally the longer a person wanders
[3:26:40] in the wilderness of sanctification
[3:26:42] without moving forward to the baptism of
[3:26:44] the holy ghost like israel's
[3:26:46] self-imposed 40-year wilderness
[3:26:48] wandering the more distant their
[3:26:50] forgiveness seems
[3:26:52] this magnifies the necessity of the
[3:26:54] eight character traits especially the
[3:26:56] power of temperance to mortify sensual
[3:26:59] cravings
[3:27:00] however the obedient or not forgetful of
[3:27:03] christ's forgiveness what a precious
[3:27:05] memory you have recalling the day you
[3:27:06] experienced christ's purging power that
[3:27:09] separated you from your sins as far as
[3:27:12] the east is from the west
[3:27:14] just like israel re-hearing the memory
[3:27:17] of supernaturally crossing the red sea
[3:27:19] you can rehearse crossing over from
[3:27:21] sinner to saint at the foot of jesus's
[3:27:24] cross
[3:27:27] conclusion
[3:27:29] the immensity of this chapter signifies
[3:27:31] god's immense desire for you to
[3:27:33] experience godliness
[3:27:35] just as god drew israel to himself in
[3:27:37] loving kindness god is patiently and
[3:27:40] lovingly drawing you to receive his
[3:27:42] divine character qualities
[3:27:45] take heed to paul's suggestion about
[3:27:47] your salvation work out your salvation
[3:27:49] with fear and trembling
[3:27:50] nothing could be more important than
[3:27:52] being assured of your salvation or your
[3:27:54] spiritual condition
[3:27:56] search the scriptures daily and pray
[3:27:58] earnestly to your heavenly father for
[3:28:00] his help to yield your will to him as
[3:28:02] you serve god rather than sin
[3:28:05] god wants you to be like him he says be
[3:28:08] holy for i am holy he has made the way
[3:28:11] for you to manifest true godliness in
[3:28:13] your flesh just as jesus christ
[3:28:15] manifested god in the flesh
[3:28:17] without controversy great is the mystery
[3:28:19] of godliness god was manifest in the
[3:28:22] flesh
[3:28:24] follow the stature of a perfect man and
[3:28:26] grow in grace and knowledge of our lord
[3:28:28] jesus christ
[3:28:31] action steps to godliness
[3:28:33] step one
[3:28:34] be sure you have the rock solid
[3:28:36] foundation of genuine faith in the shed
[3:28:38] blood of jesus
[3:28:40] expressed by being baptized fully
[3:28:42] immersed
[3:28:43] in water in the name of the lord jesus
[3:28:45] christ
[3:28:46] contact me if you need to be baptized or
[3:28:49] re-baptized in christ's literal name
[3:28:52] step 2
[3:28:53] prayerfully examine your actions and
[3:28:55] habits to see which character qualities
[3:28:57] you have and which you are lacking and
[3:28:59] ask the lord to add those attributes to
[3:29:01] your being as you reject the
[3:29:03] corresponding temptation at each step on
[3:29:06] the stature of a perfect man
[3:29:08] jesus says if ye then being evil know
[3:29:11] how to give good gifts unto your
[3:29:12] children how much more shall your
[3:29:14] heavenly father give the holy spirit to
[3:29:16] them that ask him
[3:29:19] step 3
[3:29:20] once you're born again live boldly and
[3:29:22] faithfully for christ jesus and you'll
[3:29:24] see the fruits of the spirit begin
[3:29:25] manifesting in your life
[3:29:28] chapter 11 details the bible's
[3:29:29] instructions on how you can be certain
[3:29:31] you are doing god's perfect will for
[3:29:33] your life
