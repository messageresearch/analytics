[0:02] don't watch the messenger God will take
[0:04] it away from you he'll share his glory
[0:06] as nobody said William brandham is our
[0:08] Lord baptizing in the name of William
[0:11] brandham that is a horrible disgraceful
[0:17] ungodly lie of the devil I am your
[0:21] brother now remember I am not Jesus
[0:25] Christ I am your brother a sinner saved
[0:28] by grace I'm like you
[0:32] are greetings friends in the matchless
[0:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:37] purpose of this video is to declare that
[0:40] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[0:42] only way to baptize in water and the
[0:45] name William Mariam brandham should
[0:47] never be used to baptize any believer in
[0:51] Jesus Christ nor the titles father son
[0:54] Holy Ghost should not be used in water
[0:56] baptism I want to thank the brother from
[0:59] Uganda who shared with me that this
[1:01] might be a helpful video to make and
[1:04] that people could be benefited from
[1:05] hearing quotes from Brother brandham
[1:07] himself and also scriptures that would
[1:09] help the Saints to know that the name of
[1:11] the Lord Jesus Christ is The Only Name
[1:14] That should be used in water baptism now
[1:16] of course this may be obvious to many of
[1:18] us in the modernized and industrialized
[1:21] nations but it seems to me that this
[1:23] Brothers Nation Uganda has numerous
[1:25] message churches that have not heard all
[1:28] the sermons of brother brandham have not
[1:29] heard all the quotes from brother
[1:30] brandham and therefore they're not aware
[1:32] that brother brandham openly condemned
[1:34] anyone who would baptize in his name and
[1:37] then would also warn people to not
[1:39] baptize in the titles Father Son and
[1:41] Holy Ghost so let's begin with the
[1:43] scripture and then we'll look at five
[1:45] quotes from Brother Bram here's a chart
[1:47] from my
[1:48] 2021 book called The 12 New Testament
[1:51] Mysteries that shows the Lord Jesus
[1:53] Christ baptism is the correct baptism
[1:56] it's the baptism that the apostles use
[1:58] in the book of Acts in Acts 238 acts
[2:01] 8:16 acts 10:48 acts 195 and Acts
[2:07] 22:16 and remember 10 days after Jesus
[2:10] told the disciples to baptize in the
[2:12] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost
[2:14] Peter and the apostles baptized 3,000
[2:16] souls in the name of Jesus Christ and of
[2:18] course we know this must have been the
[2:20] Lord Jesus Christ for that is the full
[2:22] name of God's revelation of God manifest
[2:25] In the
[2:26] Flesh now here's a scripture that helped
[2:28] the brother from Uganda first Ians 1:
[2:32] 12-15 Paul says now this I say that
[2:34] every one of you saith I am of Paul I am
[2:36] of Apollos and I have sephus and I have
[2:38] Christ is Christ divided was Paul
[2:41] crucified for you or were you baptized
[2:43] in the name of Paul I thank God that I
[2:46] baptize none of you but Crispus and gas
[2:48] lest any should say that i' baptize in
[2:51] my own name this is a very important
[2:53] scripture to show that Believers in this
[2:56] book of Acts Church were being tempted
[2:58] to be baptized in a different name other
[3:01] than the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:04] notice Paul says in verse 13 you should
[3:06] be baptized in the name of the one that
[3:08] was crucified for you and that was the
[3:11] Lord Jesus Christ Paul was not crucified
[3:13] for us William brandham was not
[3:15] crucified for us nor was Martin Luther
[3:17] or John Wesley only the Lord Jesus
[3:20] Christ was crucified for our sins and
[3:22] therefore baptism should only be done in
[3:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[3:26] notice Satan is right there around the
[3:28] True Believers trying to deceive them
[3:30] with his Antichrist spirit and he's
[3:32] trying to deceive them to be baptized in
[3:34] a different name other than the Lord
[3:36] Jesus Christ and remember this is a
[3:39] regular occurrence in scripture where
[3:40] Satan is trying to deceive people into
[3:42] worshiping the creation rather than the
[3:45] Creator like Nebuchadnezzar idolized
[3:47] Daniel in Daniel 2 verse 46
[3:50] Nebuchadnezzar was going to make
[3:52] offerings in Daniel's honor which was of
[3:55] course idolatry remember also John the
[3:58] Baptist was mistaken for the the Christ
[4:00] in Luke 3:15-16 Paul and Barnabas were
[4:03] called gods and were going to be
[4:05] worshiped in Acts 14:11 but they stopped
[4:07] it and then here as we just read Paul
[4:09] was thankful he baptized none of the
[4:11] Corinthians because they would have said
[4:13] he baptized them in Paul's name or his
[4:15] own name so this shows us that Satan is
[4:18] always around the Believers trying to
[4:19] deceive them trying to get the focus off
[4:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ but the True
[4:23] Believers cannot be deceived the elect
[4:25] cannot be deceived and then God Will
[4:27] Call some elect out of those who are
[4:29] deceived so that they will not be
[4:31] deceived anymore next I want to play a
[4:34] quote where brother brandom said God
[4:35] will take the messenger away from you if
[4:38] you pay attention to the messenger more
[4:39] than the message and this is from an
[4:42] absolute 1963 January 27th and I believe
[4:45] this is why God took brother brandom off
[4:47] the scene at such a young age but I
[4:48] don't know but this is the quote that
[4:50] makes me think that too many people
[4:52] around brother brandom idolized him
[4:54] rather than focusing on the Lord Jesus
[4:56] Christ the Bible the Holy Ghost the
[4:59] bible-based message the end time message
[5:01] that God sent to us let's listen to the
[5:04] quote if you haven't got that absolute
[5:10] now get
[5:14] it if you'd like to have that absolute
[5:17] that Assurance in your heart of the Holy
[5:19] Spirit raise your hand say I want
[5:21] something out of punctual weight the
[5:22] word of God I see the word of God made
[5:28] manifest amen
[5:30] God bless you it's all over the building
[5:33] thank you I'm only telling you the truth
[5:35] friend don't let it pass by again I'm
[5:37] not claiming I'm nothing I'm your
[5:40] brother don't you pay attention to a
[5:42] messenger you watch the message don't
[5:45] watch the messenger God will take it
[5:47] away from you he'll share his glory as
[5:50] nobody right glory to God don't you
[5:53] watch the messenger watch the message
[5:56] here's a second quote now this is a long
[5:57] quote I think it's over 9 minutes is
[5:59] from Revelation 5 part 1 1961 in this
[6:03] quote brother random condemns anyone
[6:05] that would call him the Lord Jesus
[6:06] Christ or try to baptize in the name of
[6:09] William brandham notice here's all the
[6:11] names brother brandham called this evil
[6:13] spirit brother Bram called it Antichrist
[6:15] horrible disgraceful and ungodly lie of
[6:19] the devil he called it the devil's
[6:21] gutter pipe to baptize in the name of
[6:24] William brandham or to say that William
[6:26] brandham is Jesus Christ he also called
[6:28] this evil spirit a yellow and black
[6:30] serpent he called it a spirit and then
[6:32] brother Ram said thus sayi the lord it's
[6:34] an heir to say that William brandham is
[6:37] Jesus Christ he said it's falsely it's
[6:40] wrong have nothing to do with it this
[6:42] lying evil spirit that would tell you to
[6:45] baptize in the name of William brandham
[6:47] let's listen to the
[6:49] quote if there's anything that has been
[6:52] in my heart to do was
[6:56] to hear those words of our our lord
[7:00] Jesus at the end of this journey to say
[7:04] it was well
[7:05] done my good and faithful
[7:09] servant and many times I have said I'd
[7:11] like to have been standing there when he
[7:13] said come unto
[7:15] me but I did desire to hear it say Well
[7:20] done that I did not hear the voice in
[7:24] the original say come unto me back in
[7:27] the times of the writing of the Bible
[7:29] but but I do desire to hear it say Well
[7:33] done and if anything I always wanted to
[7:36] be and desires of my heart to be was a
[7:40] true servant to Jesus Christ my Lord and
[7:45] Savior I want my testimony to be clean
[7:51] clearcut that I stood in all my mistakes
[7:55] I yet loved him with all my heart and I
[7:58] do that to morning with all my heart and
[8:01] because of that it forces me to say I'm
[8:06] leaving the
[8:07] ministry uh is because that there is
[8:11] something arose up amongst the people
[8:15] that's cause me to do
[8:16] it that is that I have been taken from
[8:20] my bracket of a minister or a brother
[8:23] and being called Jesus
[8:25] Christ and so uh call and that would
[8:28] bring me as an
[8:31] antichrist and I'll meet God as a
[8:35] quitter before I would meet him as an
[8:38] antichrist to take away from him uh I
[8:42] heard of it a few years ago and I
[8:45] thought it was a joke and I met a couple
[8:48] of Brethren which I don't see neither
[8:50] one of them in the meeting this morning
[8:52] two or three of them one time in a
[8:54] fishing trip and they approached me by
[8:56] the subject of saying brother brandham
[8:58] aren't you the anointed Messiah the
[9:02] Christ and I put my arms around the neck
[9:05] of both Brethren or all of them and I
[9:07] said Brethren as much as I have tried to
[9:11] be a true servant of Christ I would not
[9:14] that you would say such a thing as that
[9:17] and if it would ever be said of me then
[9:20] I will leave the field with a clear
[9:24] conscience and you who do that will be
[9:27] responsible for every soul that I would
[9:30] have saved during that time see for
[9:33] taking me from the field and I thought
[9:37] that ended it and I heard it a few more
[9:39] times but it wasn't so and the other day
[9:42] in
[9:43] Canada a brother showed me a little
[9:46] ticket of a thing he's packed in his
[9:48] pocket said William brandham is our
[9:50] Lord baptizing in the name of William
[9:53] brandom and a little a precious it been
[9:55] an enemy if it had been my enemy I would
[9:57] have know it was a joke
[9:59] but a precious darling brother come up
[10:02] to confess his sins and his wrongs and
[10:05] says faith in me as being Jesus Christ
[10:09] and I have got letters at home and calls
[10:12] from Chicago and different places asking
[10:15] me if I believe that Dogma now I got all
[10:19] kinds of letters that's come in the last
[10:21] few days and call some different places
[10:24] so uh uh saying that I was Christ
[10:30] Brethren that is a horrible disgraceful
[10:36] ungodly lie of the
[10:39] devil I am your
[10:43] brother now that would run any person
[10:47] from the field that would make anyone
[10:50] that loves Christ run from the very
[10:52] thing I went to the Lord here not long
[10:55] ago when I first heard it about a year
[10:58] ago and then I went to the Lord and He
[11:00] referred to me to the scripture that
[11:03] when John came forth of preaching that
[11:06] they hadn't had a prophet on the earth
[11:08] for so many years until it would uh they
[11:11] was All Amazed in their hearts thinking
[11:13] maybe John was the Messiah so then I
[11:17] John they went and asked him and he said
[11:19] that he was
[11:20] not you read that Luke the third chapter
[11:24] 15th verse and
[11:26] so then but that kind of quietened down
[11:30] so I let it go like that but then when
[11:32] it come to this then I know that
[11:35] something must be done now I say this
[11:38] that the
[11:40] visions and the angel of the Lord that
[11:43] appeared at the river if this is to be
[11:46] my last message or last thing to the
[11:48] Church of the world those things are
[11:53] truth as far as the angel of the Lord
[11:56] and I Stood Still if people call me a
[11:59] Prophet many times because a prophet in
[12:00] the English Testament is just a preacher
[12:04] a prophesier foreteller of the word and
[12:06] so forth I'd stand for that because you
[12:08] could just kind of push that down but
[12:10] when it comes to be calling anointed
[12:13] Christ or something that was too much
[12:15] for me so I just couldn't stand that and
[12:18] so then about I come after leaving the
[12:22] meeting at Canada I found out the way up
[12:26] in the eskimos or the Indians up there
[12:29] it got among
[12:31] them and so it just tore me all up in
[12:34] the hunt and trip that I had planned so
[12:35] long I could not take it I was afraid of
[12:39] a hunting accident if you understand
[12:40] what I mean I got so shaky worse than I
[12:43] am standing here now and I just couldn't
[12:46] stand it any longer to think that 31
[12:48] years of ministry went down the devil's
[12:51] gutter pipe into the when I'm gone what
[12:54] will it say there he is that's exactly
[12:55] what it was all the influence that had
[12:57] upon the people then you see where it be
[12:59] I'd be an antichrist and I just couldn't
[13:02] stand it I thought I'd rather die here
[13:04] in the woods like I fell on my gun or
[13:07] something and and I seen I was then I
[13:09] thought about my little Joseph and so
[13:11] forth that had to be raised and I was no
[13:14] condition to hunt so I just left the
[13:15] woods and come home and I've been before
[13:18] about 8 or 10 days in such a fix I I
[13:21] thought I was losing my mind and I just
[13:25] asked everybody to stay away from me and
[13:27] let me alone C I'm in such a fix and
[13:30] nervous and upset and all tore to pieces
[13:34] and I wondered if it would have been
[13:36] some enemy in mine it would have been
[13:38] all right but I would just laugh at it
[13:40] and went on but when it come to be
[13:42] precious
[13:43] Brothers precious sisters then that's
[13:47] what hurt me and I said Lord the great
[13:49] things too great for me I'll just have
[13:51] to walk out and leave it in your hands I
[13:53] I don't know nothing else to do a few
[13:55] nights ago to make it
[13:57] sure I I had a a visitation from the
[14:01] Lord and I seen a precious one a baby a
[14:07] serpent which was yellow and black and
[14:09] telling me and right along and and the
[14:12] thing struck me on the leg but the blood
[14:15] was so rich it didn't take effect on me
[14:17] and I looked down there's where been bit
[14:19] before and I turned quickly with a gun
[14:22] and shot this the thing and it hid it
[14:24] right in the middle of the thing and a
[14:27] brother said I turned with my gun to
[14:29] shoot its head off and he said don't do
[14:31] that just pick up the stick L thereby
[14:33] you want to turn my back to pick up the
[14:35] stick it wiggled into some water just a
[14:38] small puddle of water I said Well it
[14:40] can't hurt very much longer now because
[14:42] I believe the brother realizes the
[14:45] Brethren that what would happen I said
[14:47] it'll it's morally wounded so it'll die
[14:51] and I asked many of my members of my
[14:55] church here in this Tabernacle with
[14:58] brother NE when I come approaching me
[15:00] with that same
[15:03] question brothers sisters haven't I
[15:07] tried to be a true servant of Christ
[15:09] before you have not I tried to be your
[15:13] brother orever it is it's a spirit on
[15:17] precious
[15:18] people many people has asked me that but
[15:22] it's it's a
[15:24] spirit but I hope that the day that it
[15:27] receives a deadly wound and will die out
[15:30] quickly so I can return back to the
[15:32] ministry until then I'll ask you each
[15:36] one pray for me I don't know what I'll
[15:41] do got place up for sale I just can't
[15:45] stand I I I st around I'll go completely
[15:47] Stark mad and I I ask you to pray for me
[15:51] and remember if you've ever believe me
[15:54] if youve ever believed me to be a
[15:57] servant of Christ remember that is an
[16:01] eror it's falsely thus sayith the
[16:06] Lord it is wrong have nothing to do with
[16:10] it I am your
[16:13] brother let us bow our
[16:16] heads and the next quote is from a true
[16:18] sign that's overlooked 1961 brother Ram
[16:20] said thus sayi the Lord the father son
[16:22] Holy Ghost baptism is wrong and He
[16:24] commands the people to be baptized in
[16:26] the name of Jesus Christ as as the true
[16:29] baptism he never commanded anyone to
[16:31] baptize in the name of William Brenham
[16:34] that's blasphemy that's heresy that's an
[16:36] evil spirit that's an antichrist Spirit
[16:38] we only baptize in the name of the Lord
[16:40] Jesus Christ let's listen to the
[16:43] quote and now that same group after the
[16:45] death of Paul they finally formed out
[16:47] that bunch of Bishops and high UPS to
[16:49] the dasan council and that formed the
[16:52] Catholic church that's getting away from
[16:54] the word of God there come in your
[16:56] father son Holy Ghost I anybody anywhere
[17:00] any Nation to disprove it amen amen amen
[17:06] thus sayith the Lord amen hallelujah
[17:09] hallelujah the baptism using the title
[17:11] of father son Holy Ghost is
[17:13] false thus sayth the Lord
[17:18] amen
[17:20] amen I command every one of you on here
[17:23] on tape that hasn't been baptized in the
[17:26] name of Jesus Christ be baptized again
[17:31] in the name of Jesus Christ amen Paul in
[17:34] Acts
[17:35] 59 or 195 said have you received the
[17:38] Holy Ghost since you believe and said we
[17:40] know not where it be any Holy Ghost said
[17:41] then what was you baptized amen they
[17:44] said we've been baptized but not in
[17:47] Christian baptism Father Son and Holy
[17:49] Ghost is not Christian baptism amen no
[17:53] Christian was ever baptized like that in
[17:55] the Bible amen or for hundreds of years
[17:58] after to the Bible it's a Catholic Creed
[18:01] and not a Christian doctrine show me in
[18:04] the Bible
[18:06] amen it's a it's a
[18:09] fraud it's a working of devils amen I
[18:13] don't mean to say the people it's
[18:14] baptized like that or that way God's got
[18:16] a many person out there today that don't
[18:18] know no better but the hour has come
[18:23] we've got to get back to the word if we
[18:24] expect God to work in this day like he
[18:26] did
[18:27] then next quote from greater than
[18:29] Solomon is here now 1964 brother Ram
[18:32] plainly said I am not Jesus Christ I'm
[18:34] your brother a sinner saved by grace
[18:36] Jesus Christ never sinned Jesus Christ
[18:39] was sinless he became sin but he never
[18:42] sinned so clearly brother Ram said I am
[18:44] not Jesus Christ just like John the
[18:46] Baptist said I am not the Christ brother
[18:48] random had scriptures he fulfilled just
[18:50] like John the Baptist had scriptures he
[18:52] fulfilled but neither John the Baptist
[18:54] nor William brandham was Jesus Christ
[18:56] let's listen to the quote now remember I
[19:00] am not Jesus Christ I am your brother a
[19:03] sinner saved by grace I'm like you are
[19:07] but it's Jesus Christ the holy spirit
[19:09] that Shar with us keeping his word he
[19:12] don't have to do this he but he promised
[19:15] he would do it Jesus didn't have to heal
[19:17] the sick but the Bible said he did it
[19:19] that it might be fulfilled which was
[19:22] promised of him in the next quote
[19:25] brother Ram said there is not any other
[19:27] way to be baptized than the Lord Jesus
[19:29] Christ baptism in scripture and we must
[19:33] do everything by the scripture so the
[19:35] scripture never says to baptized in the
[19:36] name of Paul or Apollos or William
[19:39] brandham or anyone else the Lord Jesus
[19:41] Christ is the only scripture used for
[19:44] baptism let's listen to the
[19:46] quote but the whole thing has been wound
[19:49] up why there's only one
[19:53] God and his name is Jesus Christ and
[19:56] is's not another name under heav
[19:59] God hallelujah there's not one text of
[20:02] scripture nowhere in the Bible where
[20:04] anybody was ever baptized in any other
[20:06] way but in the name of Jesus Christ not
[20:09] one time was any other the new church or
[20:11] the Church of Jesus Christ ever
[20:13] sprinkled poured or anything else not
[20:16] one time was ever a ceremony used I
[20:19] baptized in the name of the father son
[20:21] Holy Ghost it's Creeds and things the
[20:24] final quote is from going beyond the
[20:25] camp 1964 brother Ram said woe to them
[20:28] baptized differently than the Lord Jesus
[20:30] Christ so we can apply that to the
[20:32] father son Holy Ghost if the people know
[20:34] better if they don't know better God
[20:36] doesn't hold that against them and also
[20:38] a woe to them that would baptize in the
[20:40] name of William brandham because William
[20:42] brandham was not crucified for us the
[20:44] Lord Jesus Christ was crucified for us
[20:47] let's listen to the
[20:48] quote there's not one scripture in the
[20:51] Bible where anybody was ever baptized in
[20:54] any other way but in the name of Jesus
[20:57] Christ right the commission of Father
[21:00] Son and Holy Ghost is only go ye
[21:02] therefore teach All Nations baptizing
[21:04] them in the name of the father son Holy
[21:06] Ghost not him not call this title over
[21:10] him but baptize him in the name of the
[21:12] father son Holy Ghost which is the Lord
[21:14] Jesus Christ everybody in the Bible was
[21:17] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[21:20] the Bible said whosoever shall take one
[21:22] word out of it or add one word to it in
[21:25] any
[21:26] wayto them
[21:28] so I have enough I have to fear about
[21:31] besides adding something or taking it
[21:32] from the scripture it's got me in
[21:34] trouble many times but I stay right
[21:36] there he is my defense it's caused me to
[21:38] separate from a many friend they parted
[21:40] from me because of that but just as long
[21:42] as I keep this friend here the Lord
[21:44] Jesus and he is the word no matter
[21:47] rugged be the path hard is the way he
[21:50] come the same way and if they call the
[21:52] Master of the House be elub how much
[21:55] more will they call those of his
[21:57] disciples in
[21:58] closing friends I hope this video was a
[22:01] blessing I'm thankful to the brother
[22:02] from Uganda for sharing this topic with
[22:05] me you know here in America where I live
[22:07] in Ohio I don't know of any churches
[22:09] that baptize in the name of William
[22:11] brandom praise God for that baptism
[22:13] should only be done in the name of the
[22:15] Lord Jesus Christ but where this brother
[22:17] lives in Uganda apparently there's
[22:18] numerous churches that are deceived by
[22:21] Satan and are baptizing in the name of
[22:23] William brandom so let's pray for those
[22:25] churches that they'll repent maybe God
[22:27] will use this video or the teachings and
[22:29] quotes on this video to help those
[22:31] people come out of their idolatry their
[22:33] Antichrist system so I'll pray for them
[22:35] now father God in the name of Jesus
[22:37] Christ I pray Lord that your great holy
[22:39] spirit will go out to these people who
[22:40] are deceived and set them free through
[22:43] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[22:45] Hallelujah the crucified one the Lord
[22:47] Jesus Christ may this brother who has
[22:49] the burden for these deceived ones may
[22:51] you anoint him to go preach it to them
[22:53] or share it with them somehow and Lord I
[22:55] know all your elect will be set free so
[22:57] we thank you for for that help us to be
[22:59] a voice against these evil spirits and
[23:01] help us to be a voice for the truth the
[23:03] true water baptism in the name of the
