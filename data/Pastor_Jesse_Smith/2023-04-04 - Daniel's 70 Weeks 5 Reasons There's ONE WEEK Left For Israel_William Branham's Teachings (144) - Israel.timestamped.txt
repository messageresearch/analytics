[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] one
[0:02] [Music]
[0:07] more week promise
[0:09] then there's one
[0:10] there's one listen to you
[0:11] [Music]
[0:14] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:20] this video is to teach the timing of
[0:22] Daniel 70 weeks according to God's
[0:25] Prophet brother William Branham
[0:27] to begin with I'll say that I'm sure my
[0:30] understanding of this may differ with
[0:31] many people or many ministers as I
[0:34] believe there is still one week
[0:36] remaining for Israel out of the 70 weeks
[0:40] I believe 69 weeks have been fulfilled
[0:42] but I believe there's still one more
[0:44] week left of time for Israel or seven
[0:47] years left for Israel
[0:48] and friends my understanding of this
[0:51] subject changed in 2021 after a deep
[0:55] study on this topic before 2021 I
[0:58] believed Jesus had preached the first
[1:01] three and a half years of Daniel's 70th
[1:03] week
[1:04] as brother branham's later quote say
[1:07] from 1963 to 1965. but when I studied
[1:11] this topic deeply religram's own sermon
[1:13] about the 70 weeks of Daniel in 1961
[1:16] convinced me there are still seven years
[1:19] left for Israel and convinced me that
[1:21] only 69 of the 70 weeks have been
[1:23] fulfilled and not 69 and a half
[1:26] I do believe the Lord Jesus preached
[1:28] around three and a half years
[1:30] but I do not believe his three and a
[1:32] half year Ministry was part of the 70th
[1:35] week of Daniel I believe the Lord Jesus
[1:38] is three and a half years of ministry
[1:39] finished the 69th week of Daniel's 70
[1:43] weeks and there's still one week
[1:45] remaining for Israel
[1:47] so in summary I believe brother
[1:48] branham's original 1961 teaching on
[1:51] Daniel 70 weeks was correct and then his
[1:55] later quotes were incorrect
[1:57] and I understand usually the opposite is
[1:59] true usually we find brother Ram's later
[2:01] teachings to be correct on almost every
[2:03] topic such as the godhead the Seven
[2:05] Seals the three parts of man the baptism
[2:08] of the Holy Ghost and so forth but this
[2:11] topic of Daniel's 70 weeks does not
[2:13] pertain to the Gentile bride of Jesus
[2:15] Christ and therefore it would make sense
[2:18] that God did not need to correct brother
[2:19] Branham on this subject similar to other
[2:22] subjects God didn't correct brother
[2:24] Branham on such as his 1977 prediction
[2:28] of total Annihilation to the world that
[2:30] he said in 1958
[2:33] and that and that's her dick now this is
[2:35] not the Lord saying this the other about
[2:37] the woman in his is the Lord but I
[2:40] predicted in 19 and and thirty 33 that
[2:45] the world would be total Annihilation
[2:47] before 77.
[2:51] and also his hopes that Rebecca would
[2:54] quote maybe take my place someday quote
[2:56] in 1957
[3:00] . good morning early I went out as I
[3:03] thought literally broken
[3:05] who I believe is going to maybe fix my
[3:08] place someday to see her first nation
[3:10] just recently
[3:13] also is hope that Billy Paul would quote
[3:16] fully be a prophet sent from God end
[3:18] quote in 1951
[3:35] I pray to that
[3:38] and also a hope that Joseph his son
[3:41] would be a prophet as he hoped in 1959.
[3:48] I said Joseph my son
[3:50] [Music]
[3:57] and of course friends we know Joseph
[3:59] brennam is not a prophet and I have a
[4:02] video about that topic if you'd like to
[4:03] know why by God's grace
[4:06] so this topic of Daniel 70 weeks doesn't
[4:09] pertain to Salvation so if you disagree
[4:11] by God's grace I hope we'll disagree as
[4:14] brothers and not as enemies
[4:17] there's a very simple outline for this
[4:19] video I'll first show the correct
[4:21] calculation by God's grace and then
[4:23] second five reasons to support this
[4:25] calculation
[4:27] so let's start with the correct
[4:28] calculation
[4:31] to begin with Daniel 9 verse 24 says 70
[4:34] weeks are determined upon thy people and
[4:36] upon thy holy city and so according to
[4:38] Genesis
[4:39] 29 verse 27
[4:42] one week equals seven years
[4:44] so 70 weeks equals 490 years
[4:48] so God told Daniel Israel had 490 years
[4:51] to complete the six-fold purpose of
[4:55] Daniel 70 weeks in Daniel 9 verse 24 and
[5:00] brother random preached an entire sermon
[5:01] on the six-fold purpose which you can
[5:04] listen to by God's grace but to
[5:06] summarize it there were basically 490
[5:08] years left for God to deal with Israel
[5:10] before the Millennium because after the
[5:12] 490 years God would bring in Everlasting
[5:16] righteousness which would be the one
[5:17] thousand year Millennial reign
[5:20] so here's a screenshot to show how God
[5:22] divided up the 70 weeks of Daniel in
[5:25] Daniel 9 24 God said there were 70 weeks
[5:28] and then in Daniel 9 25 the scripture
[5:31] says from the going forth of the
[5:33] Commandment to restore and to build
[5:34] Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince
[5:36] shall be seven weeks if you pause right
[5:38] there that means the first division of
[5:40] the 70 weeks would be seven weeks or 49
[5:43] years until the Jewish temple was built
[5:46] again along with the wall even in
[5:49] trouble as times
[5:51] now the second division is a group of 62
[5:53] weeks or 434 years
[5:57] and these are mentioned in Daniel 9 25
[5:59] and Daniel 9 26
[6:02] and notice Daniel 9 26 and after a three
[6:05] score in two weeks shall Messiah be cut
[6:07] off
[6:08] so we see here plainly the Bible says
[6:10] Jesus Christ the Messiah would be cut
[6:12] off or crucified
[6:15] after three score in two weeks or 62
[6:18] weeks now you have to take those 62
[6:20] weeks 434 years and add them to the
[6:23] previous seven weeks that were mentioned
[6:26] earlier in Daniel 9 25.
[6:29] so 434 years the 62 weeks plus the
[6:33] previous 49 years or seven weeks makes
[6:36] 483 years
[6:39] according to Daniel 9 26 it would be 483
[6:44] years until Jesus the Messiah was
[6:46] crucified or died
[6:51] then in Daniel 9 27 we see this last
[6:54] week out of the 70 weeks mentioned and
[6:58] it says quote and he shall confirm the
[7:00] Covenant with many for one week end
[7:02] quote
[7:04] so as we look at Daniel 9 24 through
[7:07] Daniel 9 27 we can now see the three
[7:09] divisions of time
[7:11] there's seven weeks until the Jewish
[7:13] temple was rebuilt and there were 62
[7:16] more weeks until Jesus died
[7:18] and then there was a one week or seven
[7:21] year covenant made
[7:23] so these are the three divisions of the
[7:25] 70 weeks
[7:28] now the starting spot for Daniel 70
[7:30] weeks has to be are the Xerxes Temple
[7:34] order to rebuild the Temple that took
[7:36] place in 445 BC as brother Brandon said
[7:40] let's listen to the quote
[7:42] the issue was given on the 14th day of
[7:45] March BC 445.
[7:50] the issue went forth the bill rebuild
[7:53] the Temple you understand it as you
[7:55] people have read the scriptures
[7:59] and so this prophecy of seven weeks or
[8:01] 49 years was fulfilled around 396 BC
[8:05] when Nehemiah finished the wall around
[8:08] Jerusalem
[8:10] the next division was 62 weeks mentioned
[8:13] in Daniel 9 26 and this would be 434
[8:17] years from 396 BC
[8:20] which takes us to 38 A.D
[8:25] then brother Branham showed that Jesus
[8:27] rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday in 30
[8:31] A.D and then brother random presented
[8:33] the apparent problem of not having the
[8:36] right calculation of dates
[8:38] laram said quote now God can't make it
[8:40] Miss end quote
[8:43] God can't make it Miss
[8:45] if he said it would be so many days and
[8:48] so many days
[8:49] if he says that so much is so much so
[8:52] what are we going to do
[8:54] now the BC 475 to 80 30 are Julian our
[8:59] stronghold years
[9:02] and then brother random showed how you
[9:04] have to subtract seven years from 38 A.D
[9:08] because the Jewish prophetic years are
[9:11] shorter than the solar years
[9:14] solar years are
[9:16] 365.25 days long but prophetic years are
[9:20] 360 days long
[9:22] so brother Ram show that's how you get
[9:24] the correct calculation for Jesus's
[9:26] crucifixion he said it was in 30 A.D
[9:29] let's listen to the quote
[9:38] on the back of a white View
[9:41] on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30.
[9:46] Jesus wrote into Jerusalem on Palm
[9:49] Sunday 80 30. and now
[9:52] now from BC 445 to 80 30 is exactly
[9:59] 475 years
[10:03] now here's a visual I made that makes
[10:05] sense of quote the trouble end quote
[10:08] brother Brandon talked about or this
[10:10] discrepancy between solar years versus
[10:12] prophetic years
[10:13] so when you add 483 solar years to 4 45
[10:17] BC you get 38 A.D
[10:20] which is an incorrect calculation
[10:23] but if you use prophetic years and you
[10:25] add 483 prophetic years so 445 BC you
[10:29] get 30 A.D which is the correct date of
[10:32] Jesus's crucifixion
[10:36] now friends this is proof Jesus did not
[10:38] preach the first three and a half years
[10:40] of the 70th week Jesus could not have
[10:42] preached the first three and a half
[10:44] years of the 70th week because the Bible
[10:47] said in Daniel 9 26
[10:49] that after three score in two weeks
[10:51] shall Messiah be cut off
[10:54] so the Bible said Jesus was cut off
[10:56] after 69 weeks or the 62 weeks plus the
[11:01] seven weeks
[11:02] and notice the Bible did not say after
[11:05] three score in two weeks and a half week
[11:07] shall Messiah be cut off so we can't add
[11:10] to the Bible and say that Jesus was cut
[11:12] off after
[11:13] 62 and a half weeks the Bible said he
[11:17] was cut off after 62 weeks
[11:20] and so I believe this is both scriptural
[11:22] and mathematical proof that Jesus did
[11:25] not preach the first three and a half
[11:27] years of the seventh week of Daniel
[11:29] rather he preached the last three and a
[11:31] half years of the 69th week of Daniel
[11:34] and there's still one week or seven
[11:37] years left of time for Israel
[11:40] notice brother Graham said a difference
[11:42] of eight years so brother Ram saw the
[11:45] trouble between the solar years and the
[11:48] prophetic years but then he showed the
[11:50] solution as well the solution of course
[11:51] was using prophetic years or the
[11:54] prophetic calendar rather than the solar
[11:56] calendar
[11:58] and then brother random says we have the
[12:00] exact proof of the prophecy let's listen
[12:02] to the quote
[12:13] that was prophesied to come to pass in
[12:17] those 70 weeks never happened then so it
[12:20] is left for the last days now amen
[12:25] now the reason some people get this
[12:27] teaching mixed up is because in the same
[12:29] sermon the 70th week of Daniel 1961
[12:32] brother random gave two different dates
[12:34] for Jesus crucifixion the first one we
[12:37] already heard was 30 A.D and then just
[12:40] four paragraphs later brother Brandon
[12:42] said they rejected Christ and killed him
[12:43] in ad33 let's listen to the quotes
[12:48] now Jesus Messiah wrote Into the City of
[12:53] Jerusalem Triumph on the back of a white
[12:56] you
[12:57] on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30.
[13:02] Jesus wrote into Jerusalem on Palm
[13:05] Sunday 80 30.
[13:08] far from the time of the going forth to
[13:10] build the temple until the destroying uh
[13:13] when they rejected Christ and killed him
[13:15] in 1833 where Christ has killed is
[13:18] exactly 483 years
[13:22] so in the sermon brother Brandon gave
[13:23] two different dates for Jesus
[13:25] crucifixion of course anyone who's
[13:27] honest knows brother Brown was human and
[13:28] he made mistakes
[13:30] so in my humble opinion I believe
[13:31] brother random made a mistake when he
[13:32] said Christ died in 33 A.D I believe the
[13:36] first quote brother Brandon gave that
[13:37] Jesus died in 30 A.D because that's the
[13:40] only calculation that works with Daniel
[13:42] 70 weeks and fulfills the scripture of
[13:45] Daniel 9 26 that Messiah would be cut
[13:48] off after 69 weeks
[13:50] now I want to show some quotes where
[13:51] brother Ram says there's one week left
[13:53] for the Jews here in paragraph 105 he
[13:57] said there's one week left one week's
[13:59] yet determined let's listen to the quote
[14:02] what God did with the Jews just exactly
[14:05] what he said he would do and then 69
[14:07] years
[14:09] I was born in 83 years but six to nine
[14:11] weeks and one week left one week set
[14:13] determined
[14:15] then in paragraph 165 brother Brandon
[14:19] said we've already had 69 weeks and
[14:21] there's one week left for the Jew let's
[14:23] listen to the quote
[14:25] if all this stuff was to take bases over
[14:28] in this time of the 70th
[14:32] weak
[14:33] the last week now if they've already had
[14:37] 69 weeks and lived in
[14:40] spin the way God said it didn't happen
[14:42] exactly the way God said it would do
[14:44] then there's one more weak promise to
[14:46] the Jews
[14:51] just get ready
[14:52] amen see listen how close we are
[14:56] last week
[14:58] seven the seventh year
[15:02] and then in paragraph 170 and shortly
[15:05] thereafter or the branch has the Roman
[15:07] Prince or the pope Antichrist will break
[15:11] the Covenant he makes with Israel after
[15:13] three and one half years
[15:15] well the brand said the pope Antichrist
[15:17] breaks the Covenant in the middle of the
[15:19] week and causes the Jewish sacrifice and
[15:21] oblation to cease that Israel will set
[15:24] up yet in the future they'll rebuild
[15:26] their Jewish temple and re-establish
[15:29] animal sacrifices in the future and the
[15:31] third time brother Ram says this Roman
[15:33] Prince Will Come in the middle of the
[15:35] week and break his Covenant with Israel
[15:37] let's listen to the quotes
[15:40] and remember once these two prophets
[15:42] going to do when they come
[15:44] this Beast this Prince
[15:48] that's your scatter the power of the
[15:50] Holy people what will they do he'll
[15:52] break his Covenant with them after three
[15:54] and a half years he'll ask them
[15:59] now go to share in the middle of the
[16:02] week three and a half days three and a
[16:04] half years brother
[16:06] I reach the Covenant and causes the
[16:09] sacrifice an album that they will have
[16:11] set up already because they'll go right
[16:12] back you are in churches you can be
[16:15] received in this image unto the Beast
[16:17] will have a fellowship we'll get rid of
[16:19] Communism where this swipe communism all
[16:21] the way out see and they can do it see
[16:23] and they'll do it but now what instead
[16:25] of uh and set up to
[16:28] this
[16:30] the daily worship sacrifice will come
[16:33] back into the city when the temple is
[16:34] rebuilt and this Priestess to come in
[16:37] the middle of this week will break his
[16:38] Covenant and do away with this sacrifice
[16:41] is he said he is scattered scattered and
[16:43] wanted to do any last storm to the
[16:44] consummation and
[16:47] then brother random in paragraph 221
[16:49] says the two Jewish prophets likely
[16:51] Moses and Elijah or two men Anointed
[16:53] with their spirits will be killed and
[16:56] then resurrected right in the midst of
[16:58] the 70th week let's listen to the quote
[17:06] how many is it thousand Jordan preschool
[17:08] days three and a half years
[17:11] and then they should be killed in the
[17:12] street fight in the midst of this 70th
[17:14] week so you see where the 70 weeks of
[17:16] annual are you see where we're living at
[17:18] I think in my beloved friends we're at
[17:21] the end
[17:23] so friends this quote from 1961 is in
[17:25] direct opposition to brother Graham's
[17:27] later quotes in 1963
[17:30] 64-65 when he said Jesus preached the
[17:33] first three and a half years of the 70th
[17:35] week and so friends when you have two
[17:37] quotes that go directly against each
[17:39] other you have to take it back to the
[17:40] word and when you take these two
[17:42] different quotes back to Daniel 9 26 you
[17:45] find that the only one that makes sense
[17:47] is that the two future Jewish prophets
[17:49] preached the first three and a half
[17:51] years of Daniel's 70th week
[17:54] next let's look at five reasons to
[17:56] support this calculation
[17:59] first Daniel 9 26 says after
[18:02] Jesus died after the 69 weeks or after
[18:05] the 483 years from 445 BC and this can
[18:10] only be 30 A.D if you make Jesus death
[18:13] in 33 A.D then your number of years
[18:16] doesn't match Daniel 9 26.
[18:19] if you make Jesus death in 33 A.D then
[18:23] you're actually adding to the word of
[18:24] God you're adding to Daniel 9 26.
[18:27] remember Daniel 9 26 says after 60 and
[18:32] two weeks or after 69 weeks
[18:35] it does not say after 60 and 2 and 1/2
[18:39] weeks we cannot add that half week we
[18:42] cannot add to the scriptures
[18:44] the second reason if you make Jesus the
[18:46] prince of Daniel 9 27 then Jesus
[18:49] overspreads the Abomination that makes
[18:51] desolation in the temple of God based on
[18:53] the word cause in Daniel 9 27. but
[18:57] second Thessalonians 2 verse 4 says the
[18:59] overspreading is done by the future
[19:01] Roman Prince or the pope Antichrist that
[19:04] exalts himself as God in the Jewish
[19:06] temple According to second Thessalonians
[19:08] 2 verse 4. who oppose it and exalteth
[19:12] himself above all that's called God or
[19:13] that is worshiped so that he is God
[19:15] sitteth in the temple of God showing
[19:17] himself that he is God and remember
[19:19] friends we have quotes from Brother
[19:20] Branham that support this as well let's
[19:23] listen to those quotes
[19:34] and notice the over spreading of
[19:37] abomination to make desolation the
[19:39] overspreading of abomination is
[19:41] domination
[19:44] what is that to do away with the
[19:46] overspreading of this to do away with
[19:48] that
[19:50] see they're overspreading uh that Roman
[19:54] power to conquer all the Sleeping
[19:56] virgins Jews and all will all be Roman
[19:59] or we won't be nothing
[20:00] yeah he'll break his Covenant in the
[20:02] middle of the week overspreading all the
[20:04] Abomination if it was the abomination of
[20:06] Jesus time when it rolling the core
[20:08] there with their propaganda it'll be
[20:10] Rome again it'll be Abomination again to
[20:12] the church to make Destiny and shall
[20:15] continue unto the consummation what will
[20:18] he do he'll continue it on onto the
[20:20] consummation at the end
[20:24] the third reason is that a complete or
[20:27] full 70th week or seven additional years
[20:29] are needed in order to allow the
[20:32] numerous prophecies to come to pass that
[20:34] are left in the scripture
[20:36] for example the two prophets of
[20:38] Revelation 11 have to prophesy before
[20:40] the 144 000 Jews are sealed with the
[20:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost because those
[20:47] two prophets are pointing the people to
[20:49] the Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:52] also there are more Jewish Martyrs that
[20:54] have to be martyred as taught by the
[20:57] fifth seal
[20:58] and so more time is needed for those
[21:00] Martyrs to give their lives
[21:02] and then more time is needed after the
[21:04] two prophets leave in Revelation 11 more
[21:07] time is needed for the trumpets and
[21:10] vowels to be sounded because remember
[21:13] the trumpets and vows have not sounded
[21:15] yet
[21:16] that's according to Revelation 7 verse 3
[21:18] and Revelation 8 verse 7 because the
[21:21] first trumpet cannot sound until after
[21:24] the 144 000 Jews are sealed by the Holy
[21:27] Ghost
[21:28] and the proof of that is because the
[21:30] first trumpet destroys all the Green
[21:31] Grass and friends if we just look around
[21:33] us around the world there's still green
[21:36] grass so the first trumpet cannot even
[21:38] blow yet
[21:40] the fourth reason according to Daniel 9
[21:42] 27 Jesus did not establish a one week or
[21:45] seven year Covenant with Israel nor did
[21:48] Jesus death cause the Pharisees to stop
[21:50] sacrificing animals even after Jesus
[21:53] resurrection animal sacrifice happened
[21:55] in Jesus time according to Luke 2 24
[21:57] Matthew 21 verse 13 and other scriptures
[22:02] but remember Daniel 9 27 said he the
[22:05] future Pope Antichrist would cause
[22:07] animal sacrifices to cease in the midst
[22:10] of the week so this has to be a future
[22:12] week which is the seven year Great
[22:15] Tribulation period
[22:17] and the fifth and final reason the date
[22:19] of 30 A.D allows Israel to have the
[22:22] 40-year probation period for rejecting
[22:24] the Messiah before judgment came in 70
[22:27] A.D when Titus destroyed Jerusalem
[22:30] it seems God often uses 40-year
[22:33] probation period it was the same
[22:34] probation period God used with Israel as
[22:37] they wandered 40 years in the wilderness
[22:38] for their fear of the Canaanites before
[22:40] Joshua took the people into the land and
[22:43] then here we see god-giving Israel 40
[22:45] years after the crucifixion of the
[22:48] Messiah until the Judgment came in 70
[22:51] A.D when the Roman general Titus invaded
[22:54] Jerusalem and destroyed the Holy Temple
[22:56] and brought judgment upon Israel for
[22:59] rejecting their Messiah
[23:01] in closing
[23:03] friends I hope this video has been a
[23:05] help by the grace of God again this
[23:07] topic does not pertain to our Salvation
[23:09] as Gentiles we are saved by grace
[23:11] through faith in the New Covenant the
[23:14] Covenant of Jesus blood so we rejoice in
[23:17] that but of course the Revelation on
[23:19] this topic does give more light on the
[23:21] scriptures and I believe brother Brown's
[23:23] original teaching on it in 1961 was the
[23:26] correct teaching because it's the only
[23:28] one that allows Daniel 9 24 through 9 27
[23:32] to work according to the mathematical
[23:34] calculations and the prophetic teachings
[23:37] from this context
[23:39] if you have any questions concerns or
[23:41] testimonies about this video please
[23:43] contact me
[23:45] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:47] the desire of your heart
