TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] this Mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the World Church system which is trinitarianism ETC and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the World Church greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to go over the first of three ways that people will take the mark of the beast during the 7-year Great Tribulation period and the first way is by a mark in the right hand or in the forehead that's what this video will cover in a future video I'll cover the mark of his name and then the mark of the number of his name hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and William brandham and William brandham was a genuine prophet of God who lived from 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian Care character in this video we're looking at the first of three ways a person will take the mark of the beast and remember we will not be those who take the mark of the beast those of us who believe the true revelation of the Bible those of us who have received the finished mystery of God according to Revelation 10:7 according to Ephesians 4 there's one Faith one Lord one baptism we believe we've received the one Faith or the one true revelation of the Bible again the same Revelation that Jesus gave to Paul and then had to be restored through Luther Wesley and and brother brandham one reason behind making this video series is to warn every man Colossians 1:28 says whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily so the Gospel of Jesus Christ should work mightily in us as Holy Ghost filled Christians then we should labor and strive to warn every man to let them know not to be a part of the Beast system nor take the mark of the beast which again can be taken in at least three ways according to the Bible so let's go read that Revelation 13 vers 17 and 18 and that no man might buy or sell save that he had the mark so the Mark is the first way a person can receive the mark of the beast or so here's the second way or the name of the Beast or here's the third way or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast for where it is the number of a man and his number is 63 sc6 also we want to read Revelation 13:16 the verse right above this here is where it says the first Mark is in the right hand or the forehead Revelation 13:16 and he causes all both small great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads so again you can get one or the other we as Holy Ghost filed Christians are going to get neither because we have the mark of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the Mark or or seal of the Holy Ghost unto the day of our Redemption according to Ephesians 1:13 and Ephesians 4:30 now in the Greek the word mark means a stamp or imprinted Mark of the mark stamped on the forehead or the right hand as the badge of the followers of the Antichrist the mark branded upon horses a second definition is thing carved sculpture Graven work of idolatrous images now as the first video showed which I'll leave a link to in the description the mark of the beast is a spiritual Mark it's always been a spiritual Mark it's the reprobate mind it's the mind that will no longer humble itself to the will of God or the word of God both the Old and New Testaments call this type of Mind a reprobate mind or rejected mind it's a disobedient mind that God rejects after that person finally rejects Jesus Christ or God and his ways for the final time only God knows when that happens here's an important point I put in my book while most people think 's Mark will be a computer chip tattoo or other physical Mark scripture teaches the opposite as the Beast Mark is also a spiritual mark an unbeliever receives after rejecting God's Mark which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost while the mark of the beast movement during the Great Tribulation May culminate with the implantation of a computer chip the mark itself begins as a rebellious stubborn or prideful human Spirit called a reprobate mind so now I'm going to read a a portion from my 2021 book and there's numerous scriptural references in here along with a quote from God's Prophet brother Brandon from his church age book released 1965 in fact I think I'll start with that quote right here by God's grace it's in chapter 10 of the church age book a resume of the ages brother Ram said quote thus all the people have to belong to the World Church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or head this Mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the World Church system which is trinitarianism ETC and the mark into hand which means to do the will of the World Church with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching Etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and Truth to the people who need it but before the Antichrist in person which we believe to be a future pope of Rome or the current pope of Rome we don't know the day or the hour takes over the complete World System of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the Lamb end quote this is a powerful wonderful explanation of the mark in the right hand or forehead from God's Prophet brother brandham here's what I wrote about in my 2021 book by God's grace along with numerous scriptural citations first the mark of the beast can be in the right hand or in the forehead the right hand Mark symbolizes one who has promised or made an oath of allegiance to the works of the Beast under the guise of peace and safety and the reference to that is first Thessalonians 5:3 the world will be longing for peace and safety we see a lot of wars in the world we see violence especially in the large cities here in the United States and of course around the world so the world will be crying for peace and safety in this case the right hand Mark may be called the right hand of falsehood that's from Psalms 144: 8-1 the Bible also talks about the right hand of Fellowship between Paul and the apostles so when Sinners join with the mark of the beast in the hand it represents a right hand of falsehood a false Oath a false vow there's no truth in their oath there's no truth in their Covenant there's no safety or peace in their Covenant and this right-and Mark means all people including church members will have to do the will of the One World Church system hands can represent works as God promised to bless obedient Israel in all the works of thine hands in Deuteronomy 16:15 simple submission and obedience to the will of the Antichrist for the sake of financial gain will cause people to take this Mark billions of people will take this Mark simply because they want to buy and sell moving on to the forehead the mark in the forehead means the Beast followers will boldly and unashamedly accept the false doctrines of the World Church system which includes trinitarianism universalism and other doctrines not found in Scripture as many videos of mine cover the Trinity is a false heretical teaching St Paul never taught three persons the phrase three persons is not in the Bible according to the historical references I found the Holy Spirit was not even confirmed as a Divine person until 381 ad and because trinitarianism is a false Doctrine it's leaven as jesus' Parable in Matthew 1333 says and once that leaven was introduced now look at the massive false doctrines that the Roman Catholic church now holds look how that leaven is spread to the entire religion of the Roman Catholic Church they make bread and wine the literal body and blood of Jesus Christ that's heresy they pray to dead people that's spiritualism so any honest person can see that the Trinity was this initial leaven that spread all the false doctrines to the entire doctrine of the Roman Catholic church and all the daughter churches or sister churches of the Roman Catholic church accept this lie that God is three persons that's nonsensical it's illogical God is one person who manifests himself in three ways to redeem mankind another note on universalism I'm not sure if you saw it last week at the Republican National Convention the convention was opened up with a prayer to the one true God of the Hindu religion a religionnews.com article says this at RNC an uneven awkward Embrace of religious pluralism as a republican official let a seek prayer images of Christian crosses flash behind her the prayer was led by a woman named harit cower Dylan a National Committee woman of the Republican National Convention for California the prayer said dear y guro are one true God we thank you for creating America as unique Heaven on this earth end quote friends this is so sad the name of God is not wahi guro the name of God is the Lord Jesus Christ and I just read this morning in Revelation 13 how the Beast will blaspheme the name of God and so Catholics blasphemed the name of God by ignoring the Lord Jesus Christ's name and giving God titles father son Holy Ghost calling him a Holy Trinity that's blasphemy changing the name of God and here it's blasphemy to say the one name of God is wahi Guru so we can see even American evangelicals Catholics are all uniting in this one World Church system they all believe they're all worshiping the one true God and they're not the only true God is the Lord Jesus Christ the forehead protects the a of brain known as the frontal lobe where decisions are made speech is formed and reasoning occurs it is fitting that God represents the forehead as a persuaded madeup mind and God said it's as hard as Stone such as Flint God told Ezekiel that he would make his forehead strong against their foreheads that's found in Ezekiel 3:1 and veres 8 and 9 so God gave Ezekiel a strong forehead a madeup mind about the truth of God's word so Spirit-filled Christians are bold and unashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ that proves they have the Holy Spirit in their souls and it's symbolized as having the mark in the forehead that's also what the Bible says about the 144,000 in the Book of Revelation they'll have a mark in their forehead it just means their minds are made up their souls are sealed by the Holy Ghost and they're unashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ on the other side sinners foreheads have minds unashamed of committing evil while God promised to Mark the foreheads of the Believers who sighed and cried against all the Abominations done in Jerusalem as a sign they would be delivered from destruction that's in Ezekiel 9: 1-11 both God followers and Beast followers have marked foreheads and each person must choose the mark he will receive remember friends these marks can be received today but there will come a final time during the seven-year Great Tribulation where everyone will have to decide whether to take the Mark or not I personally believe that Mark will be laid down during the second half of the 7-year Great Tribulation period and that's because the 144,000 Jews have to have a Ministry of two prophets for three and a half years and so we know those 144,000 cannot die until after they're sealed by the Holy Ghost and I'm unsure whether they'll die or not I don't know for sure there seems to be quotes on both sides but if the mark of the beast was laid down at the beginning of the Great Tribulation period Then those 144,000 Jews would be killed but they can't be killed they have to live long enough to hear the three and a half year Ministry of the prophets and then after the prophets are raptured the remnant rejoices and then Jesus has to come and save Israel because Israel will be surrounded by the pope and all the armies all nations will come against Israel according to Zechariah 12 and Zechariah 14 so it's sometime in that second half of the 7-year tribulation period that the 144,000 will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Bible calls it the Seal of God in the soul the Bible also calls it the mark in the forehead in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God again it's a warning to everyone it's a warning to real Believers get the mark of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul be marked with God's Mark it's also a warning to everyone who will watch this to not take the mark of the beast if it comes during our lifetime no man knows the day or the hour so we don't know when it'll come but we see progress we see birth pains leading up to this one World Church system this one world government United with the One World Church so we want to be ready by the grace of God Revelation 19 says the bride has made herself ready so we're making ready by the grace of God I'll leave a link to this video it's called how to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a short little summary I use on how to receive the Holy Ghost daily read pray obey we must daily read the Bible we must daily pray and we must daily obey the word of God and then will receive the Holy Ghost that's according to acts 5:32 God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey oy him we see in Acts chap 10 cornelus was fasting and praying obeying the word of God and then when Peter just preached a very short sermon he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
