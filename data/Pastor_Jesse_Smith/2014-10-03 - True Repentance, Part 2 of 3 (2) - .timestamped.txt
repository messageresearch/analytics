[0:15] the bible has laid out the order
[0:17] in how repentance happens first god
[0:20] sends us a messenger
[0:21] or preacher so we can hear the gospel or
[0:24] good news
[0:25] preached to us romans 10 13
[0:28] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[0:30] of the lord shall be saved
[0:32] how then shall they call on him in whom
[0:34] they have not believed
[0:35] and how shall they believe in him of
[0:38] whom they have not heard
[0:39] and how shall they hear without a
[0:40] preacher and how shall they preach
[0:43] except they be sent as it is written how
[0:46] beautiful are the feet of them that
[0:47] preach the gospel of peace
[0:49] and bring glad tidings of good things
[0:52] first corinthians 1 verse 18 for the
[0:55] preaching of the cross
[0:56] is to them that perish foolishness but
[0:58] unto us which are saved
[1:00] it is the power of god second we must
[1:03] listen to the preacher
[1:05] and hear the bad news and the good news
[1:07] the bad news is that we are sinners that
[1:09] love sin more than god
[1:11] living under the power of satan the
[1:13] power of darkness
[1:14] if we do not repent of our sins we will
[1:16] surely be judged
[1:18] and sent to the lake of fire as part of
[1:20] the eternal judgment of god
[1:21] according to revelation chapter 20 verse
[1:23] 13 and hebrews 6 verse 2.
[1:27] the good news is that jesus can deliver
[1:29] us from the power of satan
[1:31] and turn us to the power of god that we
[1:33] may receive forgiveness of sins
[1:35] and an eternal inheritance to open their
[1:38] eyes
[1:39] and to turn them from darkness to light
[1:41] and from the power of satan unto god
[1:43] that they may receive forgiveness of
[1:45] sins and inheritance among them which
[1:47] are sanctified
[1:48] by faith that is in me now after that
[1:52] john was put in prison
[1:53] jesus came into galilee preaching the
[1:55] gospel the kingdom of god
[1:57] and saying the time is fulfilled and the
[1:59] kingdom of god is at hand
[2:01] repent ye and believe the gospel
[2:04] luke 24 46 and said unto them
[2:08] thus it is written and thus it behooved
[2:10] christ to suffer
[2:11] and to rise from the dead the third day
[2:13] and that repentance and remission of
[2:15] sins
[2:16] should be preached in his name among all
[2:17] nations beginning at jerusalem
[2:20] the only way to have the power of god is
[2:23] for us to repent
[2:24] change our minds our actions make amends
[2:27] for our sins
[2:28] and hate or abhor our sins
[2:32] after listening to the preacher the
[2:34] third step is to truly
[2:36] repent each of us must decide to change
[2:38] our minds and actions
[2:40] make amends for our sins and hate our
[2:42] sins
[2:43] we must confess our sins to jesus and
[2:46] call upon the name of the lord
[2:48] who is jesus christ
[2:52] this experience of true repentance is
[2:54] the moment we recognize
[2:55] and experience our salvation our
[2:57] deliverance from our sins
[2:59] by grace through faith in the good news
[3:02] or the gospel
[3:03] you are saved romans 10 13
[3:06] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[3:08] of the lord shall be saved
[3:10] shortly after genuinely repenting the
[3:13] bible and jesus commanded us to be
[3:14] baptized
[3:15] just like the ethiopian eunuch in acts 8
[3:18] verses 26-40
[3:20] he was immediately baptized after
[3:22] hearing philip preach christ to him
[3:24] please see the video on water baptism in
[3:26] the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:28] when you're ready for this wonderful
[3:30] step fourthly
[3:32] after repenting new christians are then
[3:35] to follow jesus by learning to observe
[3:37] all his commands according to matthew 28
[3:39] verse 20.
[3:41] this is called being a disciple or
[3:43] learner of jesus
[3:45] as you grow as a christian you will
[3:46] learn to die out more and more
[3:48] to your fleshly desires which is what
[3:50] jesus taught in mark 10
[3:52] verses 17 through 29 in verse 21 jesus
[3:56] said come
[3:56] take up the cross and follow me a cross
[4:00] represents a slow
[4:01] cruel death following jesus means slowly
[4:05] dying
[4:06] to your own desires and wants jesus said
[4:09] he that taketh not his cross and fileth
[4:11] after me
[4:12] is not worthy of me in matthew 10 38.
[4:21] once you have obeyed and grown in the
[4:23] gospel taking up your cross of slow
[4:26] death
[4:26] to the lust of your flesh at some point
[4:29] jesus will baptize you with the holy
[4:31] ghost
[4:32] as acts chapter 2 verse 38 and chapter 5
[4:34] verse 32 teaches
[4:38] then peter said unto them repent and be
[4:40] baptized
[4:41] every one of you in the name of jesus
[4:42] christ for the remission of sins
[4:44] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[4:46] holy ghost
[4:48] and we are his witnesses of these things
[4:51] and so is also the holy ghost
[4:53] whom god has given to them that obey him
[4:56] we believe it is a tragedy that most
[4:59] christian ministries
[5:00] do not teach believers to receive the
[5:02] baptism of the holy ghost
[5:03] after they repent most ministries today
[5:06] teach that when a person repents
[5:08] they are already baptized with the holy
[5:10] ghost at that moment
[5:12] but that is not the case in the bible
[5:23] acts 8 verses 5-17 teaches that philip
[5:26] went into samaria
[5:27] and baptized men and women but they were
[5:30] not yet filled with the holy ghost
[5:32] peter and john came to samaria and
[5:34] prayed for them that they might receive
[5:36] the holy ghost
[5:37] and then the holy ghost fell on them
[5:40] acts chapter 10 teaches how cornelius
[5:43] and his house were all filled with the
[5:45] holy ghost
[5:46] while peter preached the word to them
[5:48] beforehand
[5:49] cornelius already knew about jesus
[5:51] according to verses 37 and 38
[5:53] and participated in humble acts of
[5:55] godliness like constant prayers
[5:57] and alms giving but what he needed was
[5:59] the baptism
[6:00] or filling of the holy ghost which god
[6:03] gave to him through the preaching of
[6:04] peter
[6:07] acts 18 verses 24 through chapter 19
[6:10] verse 7
[6:11] also teaches that believers can believe
[6:13] that jesus is the christ or messiah
[6:15] and yet still not be baptized with the
[6:17] holy ghost
[6:18] saint paul came to these christians who
[6:20] had believed yet they had not been
[6:22] filled or baptized with the holy ghost
[6:25] after he prayed for them they were born
[6:27] again as the holy ghost came upon them
[6:30] ephesians 1 verse 13 gives more proof of
[6:33] this
[6:33] as it says after that ye believed you
[6:35] were sealed with that holy spirit of
[6:37] promise
[6:38] recall also that 11 out of the 12
[6:41] apostles
[6:42] that jesus called believed he was the
[6:44] christ from matthew 16 verses 15 through
[6:47] and john chapter 6 verse 69 all of these
[6:50] apostles were a part of his ministry
[6:52] for about three and a half years and yet
[6:54] none of them were filled with a holy
[6:56] ghost
[6:56] until fifty days after his resurrection
[6:59] on the day of pentecost
[7:00] in acts chapter 2 verse 4 and they were
[7:03] all filled with the holy ghost
[7:05] and began to speak with other tongues as
[7:07] the spirit gave them utterance
[7:10] what a gross heir it would be for us to
[7:12] tell people
[7:13] they are filled with the holy ghost and
[7:15] power when they are not
[7:17] especially when their lives do not
[7:19] manifest this power of holiness
[7:22] this is why so many people make a
[7:23] decision to be a christian
[7:25] but later fall away they never receive
[7:28] the holy ghost and power
[7:30] to keep them on fire for jesus all the
[7:32] days of their lives
[7:33] like peter and paul and all the apostles
[7:36] had
[7:37] god will help each one of us to
[7:39] understand the order of repentance
[7:40] that we might continue serving and
[7:42] loving god until we receive the baptism
[7:45] of the holy ghost
[7:46] sometime after we believe
[7:53] since jesus taught few would be saved
[7:55] and able to walk the narrow road that
[7:57] leads to eternal life
[7:59] it must be true that many christian
[8:00] preachers today are not telling the
[8:02] people
[8:03] what they need to repent of so what do
[8:05] you and i need to repent of
[8:08] a faithful preacher may begin with
[8:09] jesus's words and then move to saint
[8:12] paul's words
[8:13] and preach to you about the sins that
[8:14] defile you if the following sins are not
[8:17] repented of
[8:18] the person will be guilty on judgment
[8:19] day and they will not inherit the
[8:21] kingdom of god
[8:22] and will be sent to the lake of fire as
[8:24] condemnation for their love of sin
[8:26] and refusal to be delivered by the power
[8:29] of jesus christ
[8:31] in matthew chapter 15 verses 16 through
[8:34] 20
[8:34] jesus names seven sins in the new
[8:36] testament
[8:37] not the old testament that defile men
[8:40] and women today
[8:41] evil thoughts which is thinking anything
[8:43] that is not holy
[8:45] murders which is ending someone's life
[8:49] but jesus also said having the spirit of
[8:52] murder is the same as doing the literal
[8:54] act in matthew 5 verses 21-22
[8:58] adulteries which are sexual acts which a
[9:01] married person commits with anyone else
[9:03] other than their legal spouse
[9:06] fornications
[9:07] which are sexual acts committed before
[9:09] two people are legally married
[9:12] it is critical that we point out that
[9:13] fornication and adultery
[9:15] can be committed in people's hearts and
[9:17] minds and god will hold them responsible
[9:19] on the day of judgment
[9:20] if they don't change their ways jesus
[9:23] taught this in matthew 5
[9:25] verses 27 and 28 believers should stop
[9:28] watching movies
[9:29] that have sex scenes then and tv shows
[9:31] they should stop looking at pornography
[9:33] and abstain from daydreaming about
[9:35] sexual encounters
[9:37] true repentance is to change your mind
[9:39] and then hate any and all sexual sin
[9:42] whether it is committed physically or
[9:44] spiritually in your mind
[9:47] thefts or extortion which are stealing
[9:50] and robbing
[9:52] false witness which is lying
[9:56] blasphemies which are slanders of speech
[9:59] that injure or hurt god's name
[10:01] using the name of the lord in vain the
[10:04] recent movie called the wolf on wall
[10:05] street
[10:06] used the name of jesus and god in vain
[10:08] over 70 times
[10:10] christians should not pay money or
[10:12] support any movie that blasphemes the
[10:14] holy name of jesus christ
[10:16] as saint paul taught us to put off
[10:18] blasphemy in colossians 3 verse 8.
[10:21] it is only the spirit of the devil that
[10:23] will blaspheme the holy name of jesus
[10:25] as revelation chapter 13 verses 4
[10:28] through 6
[10:29] teaches next we will quote saint paul
[10:32] who added 16 more new testament sins for
[10:35] a total of 23
[10:36] we will share on this video these sins
[10:39] are found in first corinthians chapter 6
[10:41] verses 9 and 10 and galatians 5 verses
[10:44] 19 through 21
[10:46] all those who commit these sins without
[10:48] repenting shall not inherit the kingdom
[10:50] of god
[10:52] idolatry which is the worship or
[10:55] reverence of anything other than god
[10:57] many people today worship their cars
[10:59] american idols
[11:00] athletes money and so forth anything
[11:03] that receives the praise and adoration
[11:05] that god deserves is an idol effeminate
[11:09] which is child molestation abusers of
[11:13] themselves with mankind
[11:14] which are sodomites and homosexuals
[11:18] covetousness and envy which is being
[11:21] greedy of gain
[11:22] eager to have more of what belongs to
[11:24] others
[11:26] drunkards which is becoming intoxicated
[11:28] by any form of alcohol
[11:31] revilers or railers those who complain
[11:34] or protest rashly against god
[11:37] uncleanness lustful or luxurious living
[11:42] which is unbridled excess lust without
[11:45] any sense of shame
[11:46] lawlessness witchcraft which is sorcery
[11:50] magical satanic arts poisoning
[11:52] administering of drugs
[11:54] hatred which is enmity intense dislike
[11:58] or ill will
[11:59] variance which is contention heated
[12:02] disagreements maintained in arguments
[12:05] emulation fierce jealousy rivalry
[12:08] that's pursued wrath passionate anger
[12:12] a boiling up strife a desire to put
[12:16] oneself forward
[12:17] in front of others electioneering for
[12:19] some position
[12:21] seditions dissensions and divisions
[12:25] heresies teaching your own tenants
[12:27] opinions
[12:28] to your own followers revelings
[12:31] nocturnal
[12:32] riotous frolicksome loud parties that go
[12:35] late into the night
[12:37] that was quite a list of sins but that
[12:39] is what the bible and jesus teach us
[12:42] these are the sins jesus taught himself
[12:44] and preached
[12:45] in the new testament not the old
[12:47] testament these are the sins that defile
[12:49] mankind
[12:50] and separate him from god if you are
[12:53] honest with yourself
[12:54] you are probably guilty of many of these
[12:56] sins your list of sins is probably a
[12:58] mile long
[13:00] without a true repentance from your sins
[13:02] you will face eternal judgment and
[13:03] separation from god almighty
[13:05] like those in matthew 7 verses 21
[13:07] through 23
[13:09] these people did works in the name of
[13:10] jesus you might do works in the name of
[13:12] jesus
[13:13] but their lives were still filled with
[13:15] sin and wickedness and iniquity
[13:17] may god help us to get all the sin
[13:20] wickedness and iniquity
[13:21] out of our lives thankfully the cross of
[13:24] jesus christ
[13:25] is the answer for all of us
[14:06] you
