[0:03] He said there was a test of a prophet.
[0:05] If a prophet prophesied and that what he
[0:08] said come to pass then hear him.
[0:11] There must have been some of them tape
[0:13] boys or somebody slipped into the place
[0:15] down there and played some tapes to him
[0:17] or something other played some tapes to
[0:19] him or something other and found the
[0:20] predestinated.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends [music] in the
[0:24] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:26] Is it true that you can't have the token
[0:29] unless [music] you play tapes? I believe
[0:31] the answer is no, as I'm sure you
[0:33] probably [music] guessed. So, we want to
[0:35] look at that today by the grace of God.
[0:38] Recently, there [music] was a blog post
[0:39] put on Brandom Tabernacle's website from
[0:43] October 5th, 2025 [music]
[0:45] where the pastor of Brandom Tabernacle
[0:48] states specifically that he doesn't
[0:50] believe [music]
[0:51] believers can have the token unless they
[0:53] play the tapes. This is false doctrine.
[0:55] I believe this is a doctrine of the
[0:57] nicicoatans. [music] So, let's start by
[1:00] reading the blog post and then we'll
[1:02] share the truth of the matter
[1:04] afterwards. [music] So, here's a
[1:05] screenshot of the blog post and I'll
[1:08] pick up reading towards the end of the
[1:09] blog post. It says, "You've heard many
[1:11] ministers make excuses about playing the
[1:13] tapes, but most all say the prophet
[1:16] never said play the tapes in the
[1:18] church." Now, that is true. Brother Bram
[1:22] never said, "Play the tapes in the
[1:24] church and stop preaching full-time." So
[1:27] that's not an excuse. That's the truth.
[1:30] The truth is, Brother Ram never said,
[1:31] "Change the five-fold ministry in any
[1:34] way." So, of course, this man is
[1:36] deceived. He's majoring on a minor, as
[1:39] we'll see next here by God's grace. But
[1:41] the next statement says, quote, "The
[1:43] prophet said, Rahab made her home a
[1:45] church, and her church played the tapes.
[1:48] And because she played the tapes in her
[1:50] church, her and all her tape church were
[1:53] under the token and saved. Every other
[1:55] church perished. End quote. So there's
[1:59] some things you have to break down in
[2:00] this quote. First thing is, Brother Ram
[2:02] never said the words tape church in a
[2:05] phrase. You can go ahead and look it up.
[2:07] You can go ahead type it into any search
[2:09] engine of William Brandham sermons. He
[2:11] never said the words tape church
[2:12] together. There is no such thing as a
[2:15] tape church. That's a fabrication of
[2:17] man. That's a tradition of man as Jesus
[2:20] said in Matthew 15. And Jesus said they
[2:22] worship in vain based upon the
[2:25] traditions of man. The doctrines of man,
[2:29] man-made dogmas,
[2:31] man-made traditions. So let's look
[2:34] exactly at what brother Brandham said in
[2:36] the token. This is from September 1st,
[2:39] 1963. The first time brother Brandham
[2:41] preached the token message. And it's so
[2:43] sad. You know, Brandham Tabernacle
[2:45] majors on one paragraph. It's literally
[2:49] three sentences. And because of their
[2:51] false doctrine and their seducing
[2:55] spirits of the deity spirit, they use
[2:58] this one paragraph of three sentences to
[3:01] change everything about the five-fold
[3:02] ministry because they're led by the
[3:04] deity spirit. Anyways, here's what
[3:07] brother Bram said. But there must have
[3:09] been some tape boys slipped in somewhere
[3:11] for the predestinated seed. They slipped
[3:13] over to her house and played some tapes.
[3:16] She made her her own house a church to
[3:19] receive the message. End quote. So yes,
[3:22] I can agree with this quote. I
[3:24] understand what Brother Bam's saying.
[3:25] But nowhere before this or after this
[3:28] quote or any other quote in the next 2
[3:31] years and 3 months of brother Ram's life
[3:33] did brother Ram ever say we need to
[3:35] change everything about the five-fold
[3:37] ministry. Preachers need to sit down and
[3:40] shut up or be quiet, however you want to
[3:42] say it, and just play my tapes. Brother
[3:44] Bram never said that. So, Brandham
[3:47] Tabernacle is not really saying what
[3:49] Brother Random said. Now, if you go
[3:51] listen to the second time brother Rand
[3:52] preached the token in Bakersfield,
[3:55] California, February 8th, 1964. Brother
[3:59] Ram says, quote, "There must have been
[4:00] some of them tape boys or or somebody
[4:03] slipped into that place down there and
[4:05] played some tapes to them or something
[4:07] another and found the predestinated."
[4:10] So, Brother Bram leaves it open. He said
[4:13] tape boys or somebody. So, that doesn't
[4:15] mean it was tape boys. It could have
[4:16] been tape boys or it could have been
[4:17] preachers. And then he said played some
[4:20] tapes to them or something another. So,
[4:23] brother Ram said it could have been
[4:24] playing tapes, but it could have not
[4:25] have been playing tapes because he said
[4:27] it could have been something other than
[4:29] playing tapes. So, again, random
[4:32] tabernacle is majoring on a minor.
[4:34] They're creating their own man-made
[4:35] dogma. And notice in either sermons,
[4:38] token from September 63 or token,
[4:41] February 1964, brother never said, "Thus
[4:43] sayeth the Lord, I'm changing the
[4:45] five-fold ministry. I want the preachers
[4:47] to sit down and just press play." The
[4:49] tape worshippers are under a strong
[4:52] delusion. As the Bible says, they are
[4:54] under a seducing spirit. So, is Brandon
[4:56] Tabernacle correctly interpreting
[4:58] Brother Ram's message? Of course not.
[5:01] There are so many other quotes they're
[5:02] noring. What about the quote in 1963
[5:05] questions and answers on the seals?
[5:06] Brother Ram specifically asked, should
[5:08] evangelists continue on the field in
[5:10] this hour? Of course, what they mean?
[5:11] Certainly, by all means, don't change a
[5:13] thing. So, Brother Ram says, do not
[5:15] change a thing with evangelists yet.
[5:17] What do evangelists do today for tape
[5:19] boys? I don't even think they have
[5:20] evangelists. I think they just have
[5:22] people that give out their agapo tablets
[5:25] and just say press, play, and obey.
[5:27] That's different than the evangelist in
[5:29] brother Bram's day. So, Brandon
[5:30] Tabernacle has changed many things. When
[5:32] brother Ram said, don't change a thing.
[5:35] Notice what brother Ram said. If Jesus
[5:36] is coming in the morning, preach today
[5:38] like it was going to be 10 years from
[5:39] today, but live like it's going to be at
[5:41] this hour. Brother Ram didn't say press
[5:44] play like it's going to be 10 years from
[5:46] today. He said, "Preach." And he said,
[5:48] "Don't don't get scrupled up now. That's
[5:50] why I'm trying to warn you about, see,
[5:53] just don't be odd, pecure, don't change
[5:55] nothing, but for doing something wrong,
[5:58] like pressing play and disobeying or
[6:00] doing evil, repent. See, come back to
[6:02] God. Continue on your evangelistic
[6:04] service just as you always did." And
[6:07] remember friends, there are six quotes
[6:08] where Brother Ram says, "Preach until
[6:10] Jesus returns." I got a video about that
[6:12] I put out recently. He said the
[6:14] five-fold ministry is in the church
[6:17] until he comes again. And then he said,
[6:19] "Preaching the gospel until he returns
[6:22] again in glory." Amen. He said he
[6:25] commissioned human beings to preach the
[6:27] gospel until he returns as a sign. He
[6:31] said, "Show signs and wonders of healing
[6:32] and salvation until he returns again. Go
[6:35] ye into all the world and preach the
[6:37] gospel to every creature to all the
[6:39] world. And when this gospel is gone to
[6:40] all the world, then I will return." And
[6:43] we could go on and on and on, but I'll
[6:44] stop right there by God's grace. Now,
[6:46] let's look at the blog post again. It
[6:48] says, quote, "Brothers and sisters,
[6:50] please, I'm not saying a pastor cannot
[6:52] preach this message or it's wrong if he
[6:54] does." End quote.
[6:57] Now, the pastor likes to play both
[6:59] sides. But you can't do that because
[7:01] you're contradicting yourself. I have
[7:02] other videos where this pastor says,
[7:05] "We're make believers if we don't press
[7:07] play and obey, and we're deemists if we
[7:09] don't press play and obey." So clearly
[7:12] in his eyes, it's wrong if you don't
[7:14] play tapes. But here he says it's not.
[7:16] So this pastor's message changes
[7:18] constantly. Let's keep reading. Quote,
[7:20] "In my own way, I'm preaching now
[7:22] through this letter, but open your heart
[7:23] and listen to what the prophet is saying
[7:24] and warning you about. If your pastor is
[7:27] not or will not play the tapes in your
[7:29] church by making some kind of excuse,
[7:31] whatever it might be, according to the
[7:33] word." And I'm going to stop right
[7:34] there. End quote. No, the Bible never
[7:36] says preachers will stop preaching in
[7:38] the five-fold ministry and sit down and
[7:40] just press play. That's not what the
[7:42] word says. So, let's pick it up again.
[7:45] Quote, "According to the word, no matter
[7:47] how much he says, I believe the message
[7:48] of the hour." According to what I
[7:50] believe the word says, the token, the
[7:52] message of the hour is not being
[7:53] applied. End quote. So, I like this
[7:56] honesty from the pastor. The pastor is
[7:58] being honest. He's saying according to
[8:00] what I believe the word says. And of
[8:02] course, his belief is wrong. He has a
[8:03] false belief. There is no Bible verse
[8:06] that says preachers will stop preaching
[8:08] before the coming of the Lord and start
[8:10] tape churches and isolate themselves and
[8:14] neglect their preaching gifts. There is
[8:15] no scripture that says that. But at
[8:17] least the pastor's honest and he says he
[8:19] doesn't believe a preacher can have the
[8:21] token applied. That's fine. But that's
[8:24] what I believe about this pastor and any
[8:26] pastor that will sit down and neglect
[8:28] their preaching gifts. How can they be
[8:30] born again and neglect the very gift
[8:32] that God ordained for their life to
[8:34] preach the gospel? He ordained it before
[8:36] the foundation of the world. How can a
[8:38] disobedient, rebellious, neglectful man
[8:40] be born again who will not preach the
[8:42] gospel? I don't believe he can either.
[8:45] And remember, brother Ram said, "Every
[8:47] teaching must go from Genesis to
[8:49] Revelation." You cannot take the false
[8:51] doctrine of press and obey from Genesis
[8:53] to Revelation. But as my one video
[8:55] showed about King Ahaz, you can show
[8:58] shutting down churches as the antichrist
[9:00] spirit and not attending church
[9:02] physically as the antichrist spirit. We
[9:04] see in the days of Ahaz, they closed the
[9:06] church doors. That's what Brandham
[9:07] tabernacle has done. The Bible said in
[9:10] first John, they went out from us
[9:11] because they're not of us. So all these
[9:13] tape worshippers have left true churches
[9:16] that have living gospel preachers
[9:17] standing behind the pulpit preaching the
[9:19] gospel. So you can take that from
[9:21] Genesis to Revelation about the tape
[9:23] worshippers leaving true churches,
[9:25] closing church doors. That's the
[9:27] Antichrist spirit. And again, as I said
[9:29] earlier, this started out as a deed of
[9:32] the Nicicoatans. It was just a saying.
[9:34] Well, maybe we should just stop
[9:35] preaching and just press play and obey.
[9:37] Now it's become a doctrine. Now since
[9:39] 2015 when Brandham Tabernacle got a new
[9:42] pastor, now it's their main doctrine.
[9:44] And imagine they haven't gathered
[9:46] physically in church since 2020. March
[9:49] of 2020. What a shame. Now, someone
[9:52] called me a liar who was a tape boy on
[9:54] one of these comments and they said,
[9:56] "Oh, no. We do gather for a one-hour
[9:58] prayer meeting on Wednesday nights." And
[10:00] I'd forgotten about that. So, I guess it
[10:02] is true that they do have prayer meeting
[10:03] on Wednesday night for 1 hour, but it's
[10:05] a silent prayer meeting. No singing. And
[10:07] please correct me if I'm wrong. Does
[10:09] that in any way resemble the services
[10:11] that William Brandham held during his
[10:13] time as pastor of Brandham Tabernacle?
[10:15] The answer is a resounding and obvious
[10:17] no. The tape church worship movement has
[10:21] changed the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[10:23] They're taking away from the gospel.
[10:25] There are awful repercussions for that.
[10:26] May God have mercy on their souls. I
[10:29] hope by making these videos someone,
[10:31] just one, maybe two, maybe more will
[10:34] repent of their idolatry of William
[10:35] Brandham, repent of their doctrines, the
[10:38] nicladens, and return to the gospel
[10:41] truth of living preachers preaching the
[10:43] living word of God. So, if you know
[10:45] someone who is deceived in the tape
[10:47] church movement and they're open to more
[10:49] truth, please pray and share this video
[10:51] and the other videos about these topics
[10:54] with them by the grace of God. You might
[10:56] want to start with the video about is
[10:58] Joseph Brandham a prophet. Brother Ram
[11:00] said a prophet has to pass quote the
[11:03] test of a prophet end quote. Look it up.
[11:06] These tape worshippers don't even know
[11:07] that quote. They don't even know every
[11:10] prophet has to be tested according to
[11:12] Deuteronomy chapter 18. They have to
[11:14] foretell something in the name of the
[11:16] Lord and it comes to pass. Joseph has
[11:18] never done that. Now, he still has time
[11:19] to do it, but he's getting older. He's
[11:20] 70. But they cannot call Joseph a
[11:23] prophet unless he passes the test of a
[11:26] prophet according to Deuteronomy 18 and
[11:28] brother Brandham. Because brother Ram's
[11:30] just echoing Deuteronomy 18. So tape
[11:33] worshippers ignore so many quotes. They
[11:35] don't even apply what brother Brandham
[11:36] said. Brother Brandham said, "A prophet
[11:39] is to be tested, the test of a prophet."
[11:41] Also, friends, I have a playlist of
[11:44] videos about the evils and the false
[11:46] doctrines of Brandom Tabernacle. I think
[11:48] there's 13 or 14 videos on there. I
[11:50] would encourage you to go watch those.
[11:52] They're filled with quotes from Brother
[11:54] Brandham that show the folly of the
[11:56] current Brandom Tabernacle, their false
[11:58] doctrine, their lies, their deception,
[11:59] their strong delusion, their deity
[12:01] spirit. And all these tape boys that
[12:03] make comments on my videos, they never
[12:05] address those truths that I'm pointing
[12:08] out. They just name call me. They call
[12:10] me Kane. They call me Janice and
[12:12] Jambbras. All this nonsense. And I try
[12:14] to say, "Can you just address one of
[12:16] these statements, one of my claims on
[12:18] the video, and they won't address them.
[12:21] They won't address about women having
[12:23] sperm," Brother Brandham said. And yet
[12:24] they still say, "Every word on tape is
[12:26] thus sayith the Lord." They won't
[12:28] address how Brother Brandham said, "I
[12:30] don't think I have anything to do with
[12:31] that seventh church age messenger." And
[12:34] yet they still say every word is thus
[12:35] sayith the Lord. They won't even answer
[12:36] simple questions. When I asked the
[12:39] pastor Brandon Tabernacle in an email,
[12:41] does the third person of the trinity
[12:43] dwell in your heart? As brother Ram said
[12:44] in 1952, he just said something simple
[12:47] like I believe every word that the
[12:49] prophet told us or something like that.
[12:51] Something general like that. So that's
[12:53] what a deity spirit does. It deceives
[12:56] you, makes you blinded to the truth. You
[12:57] can't even recognize truth and error.
[12:59] You have no discernment. You've
[13:01] neglected your gift if you even had a
[13:02] gift. But the Bible says the Holy Ghost
[13:04] searches the deep things of God. Yay.
[13:07] the deep things of God. The Bible says
[13:09] the Holy Ghost, Jesus said, will guide
[13:10] you into all truth. So, they're in a sad
[13:13] spiritual condition, but thank God for
[13:15] the Holy Ghost leading and guiding us
[13:16] into all truth by the grace of God.
[13:19] Looking back at that playlist again,
[13:20] please consider watching the seven false
[13:22] teachings of the Jeffersonville tape
[13:24] church movement. Not every word William
[13:26] Brandham said was thus say the Lord.
[13:28] William Brandham's absolute was Jesus
[13:30] Christ, not his tapes. The token is the
[13:32] Holy Ghost baptism, not the tapes. That
[13:34] one most applies to this video. Tape
[13:37] boys are not part of the five-fold
[13:38] ministry. 80 plus proofs the tapes of
[13:41] William Brandham have mistakes yet he's
[13:43] a true prophet. Awfulist cult won't work
[13:46] or go to church. Five parallels with
[13:48] Brandham Tabernacle and King Ahaz and
[13:51] love letter discerning lies of Brandham
[13:53] Tabernacle's blog post and of course
[13:55] this video relates to that one as well.
[13:57] So in closing friends hope this video is
[13:59] a blessing by the grace of God. Friends
[14:01] it's so important to stay with the word
[14:03] of God. But Ram said he loved the Bible.
[14:06] He believed every word in the Bible was
[14:08] thus sayeth the Lord. And it's only the
[14:10] devil who's trying to get our eyes off
[14:11] the Bible and focus on anything else.
[14:14] And in this case, Brennham Tabernacles
[14:15] got their eyes off the Bible and they're
[14:17] focusing on paragraph 299 of the token
[14:20] message. September 1st, 1963,
[14:23] and they're straining at a net and
[14:25] swallowing a camel. They're worshiping
[14:27] the messenger instead of the message.
[14:29] And they're creating their own false
[14:31] doctrine based upon three sentences. And
[14:34] based upon those three sentences,
[14:35] they're throwing out the entire New
[14:37] Testament, the entire Old Testament,
[14:39] because they all had living preachers.
[14:41] And they don't even realize they're
[14:43] setting up the image, like
[14:44] Nebuchadnezzar set up of his God,
[14:46] Daniel. They're the one setting up the
[14:48] image of their God, William Brandham,
[14:50] and his tapes. It's so sad, but let's
[14:52] pray for them. Father God, in the name
[14:54] of Jesus Christ, I pray you be merciful
[14:56] to these tape worshippers. God, let your
[14:58] Holy Spirit continue to deal with them.
[15:00] All those that can be helped or saved.
[15:02] And I pray you would help them in the
[15:03] name of Jesus Christ. Use this video,
[15:06] other videos like this by other
[15:08] preachers, anyone who has a true heart,
[15:11] a true desire for the Holy Ghost gospel,
[15:14] the true token, the baptism of the Holy
[15:16] Ghost that will agree and say amen to
[15:18] every word of God. It will feed on every
[15:20] word in the Bible. The Holy Ghost can
[15:23] only feed on the word of God. Help these
[15:25] idolattors, these deceived ones, these
[15:27] seduced ones to repent of their
[15:29] idolatry. I ask it in Jesus Christ's
[15:32] name. Amen.
[15:35] If you have any questions, [music]
[15:36] concerns, or testimonies about this
[15:37] video, please contact me. God bless you
[15:40] and may Jesus [music] Christ be the
[15:42] desire of your heart.
[15:45] I'm very happy to be here this afternoon
[15:47] and again in defense of the gospel of
[15:49] Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings,
[15:52] the good news that Jesus raised from the
[15:54] dead, living among man today, his
[15:56] church. The same Jesus that was
[15:59] yesterday will be today and forever. He
[16:03] never failed.
