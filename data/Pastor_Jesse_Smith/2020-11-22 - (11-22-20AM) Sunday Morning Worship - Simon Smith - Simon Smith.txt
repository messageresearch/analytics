get it figured out so the audio is going but the video is not going so it's like a black screen but the voice is coming through that's all it really matters is the voice pretty much because it's the

protected her she had a deer this week but she was totally protected feel sorry for the deer but uh we're grateful for god protecting you sweetie god bless you and your family praise god blessing there is none like you no one else can touch my heart [Music] tonight [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen a little study uh here i'm not gonna do a song special tonight just in the back there just listening and we worship the lord and it's so good and feels so good and a lot of times you know we don't walk in the spear like we should and dwell in the spirit and those sort of things there you go that should be on uh but does feel good to get in the presence of god and to really feel him and to know he's there and to love on him and let him know that you love them uh i do have a powerpoint here we'll see if we can get it loaded up by god's grace let's see oh we got okay um i did teach this at home and uh recently so we'll get into this study and i think we'll probably continue this tonight by god's grace it's a sobering uh subject it's a to me it's this is a heart this is a kind of where the rubber meets the road a real reality because we can read you know fictional stories and watch maybe uh or listen to somebody tell like a little goofy story i mean i used to tell lydia about trunk monkey for years i convinced her that was true [Laughter] there was a little crazy monkey that lived in my trunk and cleaned my tools after work every day and i paid him his dividends and i paid he was my indentured servant and he and i flew in a female monkey and they got married her name was treetop and they had little monkey children and i had a whole story going just for years and i told some good stories and they were funny i would laugh myself [Laughter] i didn't plan it we just went off the top of our heads and i'm pretty sure the lord probably didn't give me those stories you just made him up we caught maybe by a gift uh but you know fictional things and things we make up like that are are funny you know or they can't be or um but reality will be setting in here we live in reality the real world our decisions have real consequences uh life has real challenges and we have to battle those things so anyhow we'll keep you standing long let's go to isaiah 24 17. it's a simple a simple thought a simple study to uh this morning uh but it's real and that's this is these are you know and you'll read a couple we'll read a couple quotes here uh later on and and uh because we know the past we can study the past and from what we remember of our own lives we know the past and uh we can see present time what we're allowed to see but the future is unknown we really don't know what's going to happen in the future and we're all striving we're running we're trying to fight the good fight of faith we're all striving for the same thing eternal life uh to receive the promises of this day and now this has something to do with it so let's read this here scripture and we'll have you seated um isaiah 24 17 fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee oh inhabitant of the earth so say word of prayer this thing real soberly here dearly father lord jesus lord we come humbly lord and lord for whatever reason lord you have me behind this little pulpit lord or pulpit or however you want to say it or even a little desk and lord uh you know i don't feel qualified by any means lord to be here and just a tiny little something that rather lord you've allowed a grace to come into the world here the lord you've uh depend here lord on this day and lord we just want to convey the very thought lord do you please lord this deep conviction lord hear this real serious uh thought here lord you know we just pray it's a blessing to the people god let me just speak this morning lord just in the way you would have lord you know my limited abilities lord and the lord you're a limitless god and lord maybe you can take what little few small words i have lord and just form a little blessing to the people god make it out of fine glory to we continue it's nice we love you bless the people god in the name of jesus christ amen you have your seeds [Music] so this morning uh we started out with this scripture kind of a real uh sobering scripture maybe one would say and another another phrase would be the philistines are upon you right so first off i think i would like to maybe read this little bit of quote here my wife's already sat through this study and little emma jane there who we've had it was a great uh passenger in the car like she's a good traveling companion she has many stories and things she tells of her family and little nuggets of funniness i don't know i i like listening to her and then we got a little sneak attack last this last week here on brother jesse and we all drove incognito and under cover of darkness and with one headlight all the way from the town there was surprising one is and then i missed his driveway and went to the ditch and then uh yeah pretty good speed too [Laughter] we were jumping and jumping up and down asher was scared and then we ended up scaring brother jesse come out and he was sister chris is out of all the times he takes the trash out he takes it out right there when we get there and we and we're all hiding behind the truck and jesse's standing there like this with his trash he's like who goes there are you for us or against us just pulling out quotes from joshua looking for swords but oh i did well by god's grace and we want to be a blessing to our brother here and we don't we don't do these things for we do them because we love our your pastor and he's my brother natural spiritual and uh and it's edifying wouldn't be a blessing to people you know and it was a good time we had a good trip there back and very good time here so anyhow in these last fleeting moments here of i'll say like this freedom and what even i was like this and the illusion of the freedom that we think we have that they give us we're still very free but it's going to deteriorate rapidly we know that so i'd like to teach maybe on uh and we'll i think we'll teach on this maybe lord william tonight as well my pastor has probably done a eight or nine series on this by god's grace we'll get into some heavier stuff maybe tonight that i i really looked at and i i really believe we need to examine these things once again um uh but to this morning like to teach on the trail the serpent uh and with the subtitle of impulses so um i know the prophet the man of god was leaning on bringing a series on this as well or maybe a sermon or two he had pronounced that he was going to teach on this and and the lord decided not to have him teach on it maybe he would have exposed too much and uh would have left everything in the light then and we would have been aware maybe we would have uh been able to pinpoint more accurately and maybe it would have left uh that spirit and those people uh maybe it would have left them a little cover little cloaks uh but god allowed them to allow a prophet not to teach on it and it left them and they can stay in the dark and hide out the best they can now still right but god's left it up now to the bride to look at these things and to examine these things so anyhow i want to start out with just reading a a little we got a little bit of reading here a little bit of of uh of course you know i'm just a little teacher guy just going in here and uh but i want to read this because this is coming this is coming soon saints of god this uh our plot the american life has never been more confusing than it is right now there's never been more fear there's never been more of anything right than right now unknown the uh the things coming look it says this temptation is exactly like the temptation and eden now remember eden goes right eden takes us right back to the beginning we'll go one two three four five six seven but then what eight will take us right back to the beginning and that might play in maybe a little bit here sooner this temptation exactly is exactly like the temptation even it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to god's commanded word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be ever so right so enlightening and life-giving is to fool the world only the very elected the elect will not be fooled yes yes we count ourselves the very elect of god amen amen the word of god has come out in the 40s 50s and 60s it's shot out yes it's a run around the world and it has fallen onto your ears somewhere brother jose you have caught this message and it has taken you and transformed you and changed you and it's done us all we've all changed from what we were this is the economical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling christ's prayer that we all might be one i'm going to throw this little nugget out here because our pastor just masterfully god is using him to reveal some things fulfilling christ's prayer that we all might be one do you ever hear that song we are one in the spirit we are one in the lord we are one in the spirit do you know who wrote that you know what that was written for that was written by a catholic priest to bind the catholics and the protestants together and that song is so catchy that song is so anointed and who knows has a what on it that is now even the song in the message of the hour [Music] a catholic trap snare musically a little nugget for you and what is saying that we are one in the spirit he talks about the father and the son and the holy ghost it's a catholic song infiltrated becomes so strong politically that he she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law things the laws are going to be changed the commander-in-chief whoever will be will start doing what they call those the executive orders thank you brother jesse executive orders are coming enacted into law that's an old people will be recognized as actual churches unless they're under direct or indirect domination of this council little groups will lose charters privileges etc are we ready to lose things yes yes was it ten years ago the baptist minister paul walsher we saw the video he he blasted and warned the baptist church he says be ready be prepared to lose your cars your houses your jobs prepare for persecution we saw it yeah that's right right they are a warning yes what about us who believe in one person godhead believe in the lord jesus christ baptism amen amen to become chaplains uh sorry he says they will lose all property and spiritual rights with the people for example right now unless local administ ministerial association approves in many if not most cities one cannot rent a building for religious services to become chaplains in the armed services hospitals etc is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to the trinitarian economical groups you know years ago we tried to get into ccno which is a uh a jail area for in the striker ohio but because we're not trinitarian we were allowed to come in ten years ago we can't because we're not trinitarians university all right uh where the cam tried to go full-time pastor and we tried to get into the uh insurance that the pastors can share and the religious can share and and uh but he started looking to find paperwork you have to sign that you're trinitarian so you can't do that this pressure increases and it will and it will it will be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privileges do we have rights or actually do we have privileges because these rights should be rights but if they're taken away i wonder if they're really rights or were they just privileges they allotted to you and i [Music] hey and so many will be tempted to go along for they will feel what is better to serve god publicly in the framework of this organization than not to serve god at all publicly right but they err to believe the devil's lies to serve satan even though you may want to call him jehovah but the elect will not be deceived amen furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this moves becomes the image erected to the beast the saints will be gone in the rapture amen praise be to god amen and this little delight some winsome move that started out in ephesus sorry in a fellowship at ephesus will become the monster of satan that defies and deceives the whole world for the church system of the roman catholic and the protestants in coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap or will kill them the trail of the serpent by refusing them the privilege the privilege i thought it was all right we could go buy milk and uh kashi cereal uh your favorite fruit roll-ups i thought it was right or is it a privilege of buying and selling whereby we would make a living this will be accomplished simply for the harlots daughters are all but going back to where in the meantime rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold the jews have the bonds on the paper and right now the harlot will destroy and sorry and at the right time and that time is drawing near the harlot will destroy the present-day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold and with no gold the system falls the church will be trapped and come into alliance and the harlot church will take over the whole world we are at this time economies are wavering everything's shaking financially i mean everything is just insane for those who voted for biden who's all about socialism and giving the country back to china and just letting him china have their way and all not trying to get politically political but then of course it goes down back to even abortion and all those things insanity but now look what the word of god says and take heed to yourselves unless at any time your hearts be over charged with separating that is overeating yes this is a warning for this age yes sir overeating would be a problem in this age what does overeating do it dolls the senses yes sir yes sir it gives the body more strength in the spirit less yes jesus said what he says he says the the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak and how do we make it weak by what he here jesus himself the man the man the manna from heaven said overeating yes sir especially in america yes sir and drunkenness and cares of this life right now if you sit in these seats are you able to focus on the word of god or or this or our minds thinking about something else a care a concern mean brother mike just spent 12 hours switching out my electrical panel took 12 hours when we had to go we had to meet toledo grab stuff get all the parts this this then i divided and then head back here and then we had to install it and then i i got to pull my first meter i mean then i'd put it back in and at that yesterday my mind was completely sued consumed by electrical meters and switching it to a 200 amp service [Laughter] and i could not think of anything else but this but getting this job done and the cares of this life and so that they would come upon you unawares and even though in america right now where everything's wavering tipsy turn tommy and turvy or however you want to say it everything's unknown and yeah a lot of us still have jobs and we go about the daily routines of our life yes sir like all this everything's happening up here but we're still stuck in our little lives going around the exact same mountain doing the exact same thing time and time and day after day after day and it seems like even though everything's insane nothing's affecting us we are still consumed in the cares of this life and do we have to live like that we have to live like that that's our that's our life but within the inside of our hearts and our souls we should be so thinking on the mind of god on the lord is this the season amen amen lord don't let me miss it yes a lot of times when i pray i say lord make it so plain i cannot miss it i said lord you know you made me not the sharpest tool in the shed or whatever you want to say in the tool bag but lord don't let me miss it thank you jesus put it right here in my face just blinking right back at me yeah showing amen praise be to god yes so here we're dealing with these things here in romans 13 11 he says and that knowing the time that now it is high time to wake up out of sleep yes amen to really get sober to really see what's out there to really see what we're we've we have been missing as far as dealing with the kingdom of god jesus said what i'll be about my father's business have we've been about the father's business i know this is simple absolutely but it's the toughest thing to do as i walk through uh where would i go maybe a costco or go on the job site or whatever every day i walk past people who i've never witnessed to and i might only get one instance one thing to say and as the prophet said he says put your plug in for jesus christ but a lot of times we just walk through our daily lives caring about our lives our needs our desires and our worlds look at the we stayed at the hotel last night and you know what the carpet designs are the very design of that car carpet i've actually went to uh i was working at great wolf lodge years and years and years ago and in the children's i was like this the children's casino which is the arcade they're prepping them for casinos let's just be honest lights and machines and winning and that's casinos for children if you would actually i could show you a picture of what that carpet what was hidden in that carpet it was bad it was obvious if you looked at it so i was at this hotel and you know what they are a bunch of eyes looks like i beams everything's i i i i i i self-consumed it's all about me iphones and ipads and night of this and i that and why because it's all about me all right i mean i just walked out there like why are there eyes right here there's just also just eyes everywhere what is that for that's programming who said hey you know i got a good idea maybe i'll just make a carpet with a bunch of eyes [Laughter] no that was planned nothing new under the sun all right amen he says not knowing that now it is the high time to wake on the sea for now he says for now is our salvation nearer than when we believe when i first heard this gospel in 2001 the very end of it i thought by 2012 would be over i would be out of 2012 was a you remember how 2012 was like this big doomsday and just like why 2k was a big doomsday thing and and here we are 10 years or 12 years sorry eight years past that right right he says what the rapture is even closer than when we believe the word of god he says i don't know about you about salvation now we were saved 2000 years ago received we received it back then but you know we became not we had the understanding and knowledge of it now but the very i'm talking salvation i'm talking salvation from what from ourselves salvation from destruction from the great tribulation the rapture that's what we're looking for he said the night is far spent how much darker can it get the day is at hand let us therefore cast all the works off all the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light the prophet i couldn't find a quote but i read it before the prophet said he says he says he says once she gets on the full armor of god she'll be i'm just paraphrasing but i think she said something like she'll be an invincible army or something like that but we have to have that full army oh i'm sorry armor on and i heard another brother preach and he was saying uh it was probably in the 80s or 90s or however maybe 70s and he's dealing with the lamp stands the matthew 25 the candlesticks the wise had this and the foolish had this he said he said now we might have candlesticks but it said they had to trim the lamps which means they were not burning you know what produces light people just go down their way but then they notice you if they notice you that's because you have a light burning amen when the john the baptist trusts out of the the desert they noticed him because he was because there was a light there why because he was on fire amen amen he was consumed with what god's plan for his life was he was consumed for what winning souls and getting people baptized [Laughter] getting what salvation he was so consumed he was on fire for god how's our lights burning this morning you might be a candlestick but are you set on fire yeah sure he says let us put on the armor of light light we must be burning [Music] consumed by what the spirit of god that's how you produce light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting drunkenness not in uh chambering and wontonness but not in strife in an envy amen yes sure he says lay that up for yourselves treasure treasures upon the earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up yourselves treasures in heaven where neither roth nor death does corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasures there will your heart be also what do you value the most amen we're kind of just dealing with impulses for where your treasure is there will your heart be also what do you love the most i just somebody just sent me a video on whatsapp and they were saying and he was over in china i believe this minister was over in china and all these chinese there was like uh they were they were they were sneaking bibles in and and the the american was like okay if we could call how long he says what will happen they said we'll probably go to the prison for two or three years whatever that's that and they said how many of you and there's like 12. how many of you have been in prison they're like 10 of them who raise their hands and they're still smuggling bibles so he was able to smuggle in i think uh eight bibles running the eight bibles uh one lady was looking at the bible and they started reading and they turned the picture or to the pages there and the woman gave it to the woman next to her because she didn't have a bible because this woman had already memorized the entire chapter and the entire meeting that this american came to help these you know they encourage them they said pastor will you pray that we get freedoms like america and you know what he said he said no he told i will not pray that prayer he says because you know americans you know what these bibles that you guys have memorized because you only get a scripture a piece at a time he says our bibles aren't even being read in america if it's too hot in the church the people won't come and they travel three days to get to hear this american minister he says if it's too uncomfortable in the church the people won't even come he said if they have to drive more than an hour they won't even go to church he says i will not pray that prayer if it's too cold in the church they won't come hmm how rich are we and we don't even know it for where your treasure is there will your heart be also now notice what says here for as a snare shall it come upon all than the dwell on the face of the earth there is a trap set this is not fiction this is real life this is a prophecy of our day there is a strap set for the entire world and saints of god it's about ready to be strong he says watch you therefore and pray always that you may may be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man amen now and this is where we're probably gonna go tonight okay i'm going to hit a scripture here i'm just going to show you we're dealing with trail the serpent impulses okay notice what christ says woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garners to the sepulcultures of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers notice they are acknowledging that their genealogy their seedline that they are descendants of these people that if we had been part days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets so what is that trail look like in the natural you could go into the wilderness and look for a snake and i think brother jesse's taught on how sidewinders have certain characteristics on their trail and then a bow a constrictor and a python have certain characteristics on their trail but what about those that are still in human form in original serpent form what would their trail look like and jesus christ god and flesh says here's an identification you say if we've been the days of our fathers we have not been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets the one of the things you'll see it during the trail if you had followed a snake in our day and this day or uh the real serpents i'll say like that it would be a bloody trail wherefore be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets fill ye up then the measure of your fathers looks like they haven't killed too many people then their entire fathers have a bloody history blood bath blood bath blood bath and jesus says you're gonna have to you're gonna do this exact same thing fill you up the measure of your fathers and we're gonna go this way probably tonight lord willing now one thing about snakes that serpent they never stop growing but johnny as big as you got you stopped took a long time and you went way up there i don't know about that height but yeah he stopped big man it's like my dream i i took my nephew out to eat he's 16 years old he's six foot three and i just i just stare at it i'm like dude you're like everything i wanted to be what happened what why me but here you know just in science snakes never quit growing the bible says hell and destruction are never full they can eat and eat and eat and as they get bigger their jaws are able to dislocate and swallow greater things greater amount of portions of whatever is before them they want so the eyes of man are never satisfied he compares it to the eyes of man or maybe an eyes of the serpent but remember as the prophet of god would say this is a serpent as well this thing is corrupted this has sinned dwelling in it shiny things always catch our attentions you know what i found myself watching on youtube lately is gold panning sleuthing getting in the stream and just looking for gold because to me it's it i don't know it's catchy to me i don't know why i don't know it's i like to find things that's kind of one thing i really like the word of god because things open up and you see things and the lord shows you i don't even actually i don't have nothing to do with it the lord just opens it up and shows you things and gives you a nugget of the word of god that you had never seen before but notice he a lot of times he waits for you to go looking and you take a word walk through genesis and you're like walking through genesis and you're like oh there it is and the lord will open up a completely new revelation or a different angle you've never seen that scripture that's gold hunting right there in the water of the word and the wider word comes down you're panning through that wire of the word and boom a little gold nugget hits me hey that's a nice little chunk there i'm gonna share that that's for me god gave that to me he allowed me to get in them little fields there and that little stream of the word and then here it comes amen so snakes never stop growing now look here in habakkuk uh two and two through five he says and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak in that lie terry it uh there there though it terry wait for it because it will surely it surely will come it will not tarry behold his soul which is lifted up is not of right in him but the just shall live by his faith yea also because he transgresseth by wine too much indulging you can even think spiritually too much spiritual revelation always majoring on revelation he is a proud man neither keepeth at home who enlarges his desire as hell and is as death and cannot be satisfied but gathereth unto him all nations and he with unto him all people these men want more and more publicity publicity more fame more fortune they want more and more underneath them if you look another scripture he's talking about pastors it ties right in with this shepherds now as i was uh down i was at the my little the river i lived to uh about a month ago with my little my nephews are benign elijah and brielle and micah and we're looking in the river there and and i spotted something i said but i checked that out i took a little stick i found and i reached it out you know what it was it was a snakeskin because why snakes never stop growing and when they grow further they shed their housing they have and continue on to grow further and they leave that housing behind them and why is it if you notice these big maggot churches building million dollar churches 10 million 20 million dollar churches they're growing and growing and growing they want more and more members he says if we believe the coming messiah is at hand i think we ought to lay aside everything else and be concerned of getting this message to the land's yonder as fast as you can do it that's right if we are convinced but we preach there's a coming messiah and wants to put a hundred million dollars in a building and if the messiah is coming what what good that going to do sure absolutely now this is 50 60 years past now we're at beyond this but i'll tell you what if you preach the true word of god your church cannot will not be thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people except maybe like in africa or wherever they have huge gatherings and those sort of things uh say that's in the word of god and the message but as this thing gets closer and closer to the top of that pyramid what it'll be the prophet said it'll be a razor honed sharp and think about this as i was listening there in the days of noah it said eight souls were saved eight if i had eight million dollars in ones stacked in this room and i picked eight of those and that was all we could spend and that would be a waste so few think about i mean so few people will be saved in this thing eight out of a million and that was as the prophet said that was the tribulation saints the rapture was one in eight million one in eight million now remember who came up with that that was jesus as it was in the days of noah as in the days of lot that was not a theologian that was not a a man-aged thought that it went out of no that was jesus saying jesus literally said as in the days of noah eight people were saved in one type of the rapture and it fell in your laps to god gave you the engagement ring he chose and elected you to hear this word that is not a light thing we must hold dear to these to these to the truth is the word of god doctrine yes it is but it's also the holy ghost it's most the major is the holy ghost the doctors are wonderful sisters dressed the way they did hair the brothers address our conduct ourselves a certain way those things are good and those things are right but we know the holy ghost is the only thing that matters the eternal life the prophet and demonology you can be completely insane and still have the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul so if someone's insane they're probably not living right they're not dressing right they're not thinking right because what they're insane but if they have the presence of the god or that seal of god in their life they're gonna make that rapture somehow talk about a mystery talk about a paradox talk about what talk about trying to compare yourself like but that's the word of god jesus christ does as he pleases why because this is his story he can do whatever he wants he's in full control amen amen praise god now look what he said jesus now we are so smart intellectual in our churches too we can build a million dollar building or 10 million building and yet uh they're trying to build one better than the methodist the baptist one uh build one better than the presbyterian the pentecostals got in the raised rat race too absolutely he says but the thing is is it as we yet we are so smart and set on our ways until we fail to humble ourselves uh to recognize the god the god that's in the little mission on the corner see that's right well that's just we just stumble in simplicity we've always done it yes i wonder and i've heard things brother jesse's congregations kind of small well for jess maybe when god starts blessing you maybe you know maybe god's right here amen maybe the lord is speaking to you every wednesday and every sunday amen maybe the very presence of the logos is right here in this room amen and to even in the big message rankings if you will they totally overlook it god's in the small things amen amen sure now dealing with impulses the trail of the serpent here look at cain saints of god i i i'm teaching these things because i i heard i heard something on it and it so shook me because saints of god are our flesh is so frail and even though you may have the holy ghost in here the seal of the holy ghost when this fails we still have to answer for we're actually in we are supposed to be in charge of this vessel we've got to keep our temples clean i mean we've heard it for how many years we hear time and time and time we've got to keep keep keep keeping the word stay in the word saying the word what because this we've got to keep this in line if we have the seal of the holy ghost there is absolutely no sin in our soul we are sinless in the soul absolutely why because our desires we have we we don't want to do anything wrong right here deep down to the deepest point of view in the soul if you're holding us you don't want to do anything wrong but we're we have not just one realm saints we have three realms yes sir and the other two are defiled yes yes but those other two defile realms people be lost because of those two realms yes sir what happened to kate right here he saw his brother offer and worship and bring the right sacrifice and god came down and some i don't even know exactly if the prophet even said however but god vindicated that this was right yes and cain saw it cain realized it and the bible said he was wrong he was upset so instantly there was this anger rose up i worked and i worked and i worked god his anger was towards god and evil and i worked for him and he wouldn't accept it i put all my sweat and labor for an entire growing season and i brought the best fruits the most beautiful the colors they all complimented one another and i set it on the altar in a range in a certain kind of way god wouldn't accept it and he accepted my lazy brother and instantly there was the anger that little impossible anger fleshly [Laughter] now one time my life have i lost my temper i've lit and i feel bad my wife had to see it she saw a raging maniac it was my 33rd year and if for some reason in our church when it hits 33 everybody has that year because brooks had it many saints of god but i know when they heard 33 it was their roughest year of their life and it literally was the roughest year and saints of god when a certain thing happened the house and i was just having an average day but through that year i got pummeled hammered with this thing and this thing and this thing and that thing and everything was building up the pressure was so high i got home from work and i was just and then my dog did a certain thing and i just went my vision went like this literally and went red and i grabbed that dog with my he was probably she was 60 60 pounds on that i grabbed that dog by the neck right here and i started banging i lift that dog up just like this i'm five foot three and a half and i'd grab that dog and i started banging her on the floor i was gonna kill the dog and then i come to myself after about five minutes and i had a tremendous headache for three days never lost my temper before the saints of god in that impulse of rage you can't kill somebody right right and i believe i received the holy ghost years before then but when the pressure builds on this was there any pressure in my soul no it was all my flesh in the spirit realm yes and that impulse of anger from pressure from pressure that's coming too right it triggered that and i lost control i lost control of this vessel literally that's not me i'm not a i've never been in a fight before but a little impulse something clicked just right or just wrong and the same thing took place with cain god came down and met king said hey this is the right way what made what made you accept ables and then god broke it down so just do what he did he revealed it opened up the mystery king's like goes and starts talking to abel and maybe abel just said one little thing hey all you got to do is what i did vision goes red and he kills his brother right because of a little impulse of anger of rejection god rejected him but god had every right to reject him because he did not do things that were right and then god came and told him the right way of doing it that's right but one little impulse to me this just is just it's terrifying because saints of god we are coming to a place where we lose we will all our privilege will be lost yes and we're going to see things we thought we'd never see before we're going to experience things we've never experienced before in this fresh carnal realm and we had better god help us off to pray up amen because if we have the mind of god if we have the literal mind of god whatever happens it's the lord's will and your heart will always be beating and pulsating for jesus christ if if this thing happens over here well praise be to god the lord giveth the lord take it blessed be the name of the lord but we must be impulsing proceeding from the soul realm with his life his decisions his mindset amen amen cain that one little impulse grew all the way to murder yes who's the next one esau out hunting all day trying to track old mossy horns or the big buck man like my nephew looking for all the mossy horns or and we stay in liberty center they got the mysterious buck now they call them mold hickory they always have to name this like 28 000 point buck and they just you know everybody's telling legends and urban stories and they try and do sketches and this is game no i'll tell you that anyway esau hunting whatever he was hunting he was there all day how many have went fasting how many have fasted for more than a day before yeah absolutely sure esau hunted come back come to his brother's tent so hungry he still walks in hey brother wow you've got some food here and i'm sure the tent of uh jacob was just culminating with earth what's that era aromatics of savory meats and killed the padded whatever he had everything going that right that day and god set it up esau goes says hey give me some of that and jacob finds an opportunity he says i'll tell you what i'll give you the biggest mole you want if you give me sell me your birthright we'll trade it this bowl of food this bowl of food for your hunger what did esau do i'll probably be dead within a moment's notice of so what's that going to mean thank you god you know how much how long the human body can go without food i've heard records or accounts of people being lost in australia for 40 days without food and 10 of them without water and miraculously they made it but esau was so carnal he was so used to having his belly filled yeah he was so used to eating just whenever he wanted to and never had to how many of us have missed a meal and really i mean like poor like you're so poor and mama you know we've been close probably at our house a couple times we always had milk so we always found some milk and filled the fill the edge well i did or whatever you know water maybe with sugar in it but here esau was so hungry that impulse he's looking at that food and he's so hungry maybe he just should have just went home and got some of his probably dried meat or canned and walked to his mama's house or to their tent and whatever got some over there i'm sure they all dwelt within the same location relatively close but because he was so hungry he sold out he sold out for food saints of god what happens when they shut down your debit card your bank account right right you go for a day okay i'm hungry you know you look at your shelves and start going through your lazy susan pull out a couple of this and cans and it goes for a week and now the children are looking at your husband's like [Music] and it goes for another week how long is lord going to test us for and we start getting famished we get so hungry and google is filled with just come and join up we have food food banks but you gotta you gotta join up food banks by the baptist food banks by the catholic food banks by message will we sell out for some food no we jesus christ i saw a quote i cannot find it but i did see it back in the early 50s the ramp said he said jesus christ is going to feed his children just like he did with moses when we have to take flight and go out to the woods in the wilderness jesus christ is going to feed us have you ever thought that maybe if we get hungry you know jesus said i am the bread of life and if jesus is the bread of life then he's the word of life i wonder if maybe if we ever got real hungry and this and that if we just read the bible could fill us up what's the difference between that mana and this man one's in word form one's in these words are spirit and life i wonder if these could be just as satisfying as a big old j alexander's steak with macaroni cheese and carrot cake absolutely this can't sustain us if you have the faith this if reading this could fill your bellies but esau was so hungry he sold out because of a fleshly impulse these little things that can rise up just real quick you know how it is just real quick you can just and then you're on that trail you your whole mind is i'm going i'm going to do this it can just happen just like that we have to have we have to have this thing under subjection amen he says when thou sittest to eat with the ruler consider diligent what is before thee and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite be not desirous of his dainties for they are all they are deceitful meat now notice he says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shoot forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but now are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but are now have obtained mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as strange as the pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul cain's flesh betrayed his soul his flesh got the best of this this designated the soul's destination esau let this determine his soul's destination this has a lot of power that's why we need jesus christ the holy ghost in our soul because that's the greatest power there is this will override this when time comes because what the spirit will rise up on the scene against anything what the the bible says the flood will come in but god will raise up a standard amen what in the spiritual realm he will do his raise again remember if he's in here he can rise any time he wants amen amen since the since 63 64 the prophet's off the scene and god has even though god has done many wonderful things he's been pretty silent you jump on the internet every denominational person is having a dream about the election and we're at the end of the rapture i don't know too many people in the message having dreams and this and this and this but if we have the holy ghost within there is coming a time where he the holy ghost is going to just impossible ate out and conquer the rest of the two realms he's going to do it we just have to get in the condition when we say lord it's time take all these realms every portion of this house every portion of this vessel lord it is yours have your will and not my will amen but it can happen see number that's why the baptism of the holy ghost is so important because that set that seals the deal if you have the baptism of the holy ghost he will keep you amen what if i did not have the holy ghost when i went and i was killing that dog that thing could have turned on my wife it could have turned on whoever i was i could have snapped at work what's hot you're five foot three yeah watch the little guys that's what they say even at work they're like you know i gotta watch some little guys like hey just relax i'm on your team what i'm trying to say is that make sure we are sealed with the baptism of the holy ghost because he is going to do the work in this age you think you think that we're going to be able to fast our way and and do this and do this kind of work it's going to be works it's going to be by grace when he comes and when it's time to catch his bride away his bride he will already have his bride in condition amen absolutely that's a that's a word of promise but from here to the rapture we've really got remember he said watch and pray watch what just the world i i'm the world is not gonna this thing will condemn you this thing right here will get you in trouble now we have to watch the other things because that puts pressure and stress on this thing and on our minds and our hearts so watch everything amen amen thanks to god let's stay in here we're we've been about hour here i don't keep you too much here i know we got two services now look here as we stretch a little bit do these little arm circles here and whatever you want if you look at balaam you know balaam his impulse was money he wanted riches he wanted wealth he was already a man of renown they knew he was a minor or false prophet or you know a diviner witchcraft guy whatever you want to say but he could get in the presence of god too but he wanted that paycheck he wanted that money notice he bypassed all scriptural reasoning to get a check to get a little extra money and he tried to curse the people how many times two or three times but balaam found out you can't resist reverse the blessing of god it's irreversible so what do you do how did he get israel to fall the bible says in revelations 2 but i have few things against thee because thou has there them that held a doctrine of balaam who taught baalik he was a teacher of the word of god he knew the correct approach you know as our prophet said seven of rams and you want to get the presence of god who taught baylor to cast stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication we know this is baal poor right a gathering the prophet said uh in in his reiterating and kind of just talking about it he says oh he and the baalik baylor said hey just come and fellowship with us come hang out with us in our church in our denomination or how are you saying our church and as the prophet dramatized it the israelites said well maybe we ought to go you know we're supposed to love one another and join together and be one as the scripture says i mean we're supposed to be brothers in christ and those sort of things but if they would have understand what was going on remember not all israel went 24 000 went and started doing things they should not have been doing but balaam sold out for money much like judas anyhow now look what the prophet says here what if tonight we could call his arch enemy judas iscariot the very name judas makes us shiver doesn't it to me it frightens just to think that uh i've had i'll be honest i've had mind battles that i was a judas absolutely i battled that for from the time i come in the masses until it's about 2010 i battled that but i kept saying well where else am i going to go i'm not going back with these denominational guys being baptized right or believing the right god or you know those sort of things so i battled that and then the lord cured me about 2010 but to think that this could be someone you love someone you know it's scary it literally will send chills down your spine because we understand it we know the revelation behind it we know the severity the seriousness of it let's just do it a couple of couple scriptures here uh one a couple scriptures and then we'll be done here now look at judas here now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper there came into a woman heaven unto him a woman had an alabaster box a very precious ointment and poured it on his head and he sat at meat as he said i mean and when his disciples saw they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste the disciples are all there this woman brings in this alabaster box pours it over jesus cleanses jesus preparation for what the burial for the death right and disciples are going do you know how much money that was do we do you guys even know how much money that that that cost the cost of that and the disciples got all stirred and upset i'm sure it was loud reasoning remember 12 guys talking about this 12 guys 12 here and just start saying do you know who caused that disruption verse 3 then took mary a pound of ointment and spidered very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his hair uh his hair with her uh his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of ointment then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simon's son we should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence and given to the poor you know who started that argument judas because he was not worried about the ointment but that money so that whole disciple disruption was caused by one man he was one man the instigator just made one comment and that comment anointed anointed anointed all the rest and now we have a problem in christ in fact if you study this directly after this and judah seeing that money that was lost that he could have had it was directly after this act that he went to the chief priests look it up on the scriptures directly after this that little anger hit that hatred hit that could have been mine and they put it on this guy just that little impulse that desire for money and then getting angry about this that and then what he just went went did what he had to do let's say a prayer dearly father lord jesus lord we love you lord and lord jesus lord you've been so gracious so kind to us lord such a blessing to us god and lord jesus lord we just asked god that this had been what you wanted me lord i just this has been burning on my heart for months lord god just looking at these things and thinking on him lord just how close it'll be lord jesus god only the reelect will be saved god lord jesus lord the bible says though we must walk in the spirit and it will not fulfill the lust of the flesh of god jesus lord we ask god lord jesus [Music] the lord [Music] this [Music] god rise up [Music] lord [Music] is [Music] it was so simple but i'm telling you [Music] those names are mentioned in the new testament as the examples [Music] esau as christ would say goodnight as the days of noah and and and jonah the holy spirit also takes place false examples [Music] so we can learn the very characteristics that they fell from when they fell by and a lot of us haven't seen those [Music] [Applause] things because thanks to god we have a god that's great [Music] 100 years ago said that god [Music] and not only that all the mysteries of the word of god on earth [Applause] [Music] what does it mean i don't know [Music] [Applause] [Music] up [Music] hey [Music] he would not even baptize them until they repented how many times are we baptizing [Music] god [Music] god [Music] i see wow are we all right [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] me oh [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] here [Music]
