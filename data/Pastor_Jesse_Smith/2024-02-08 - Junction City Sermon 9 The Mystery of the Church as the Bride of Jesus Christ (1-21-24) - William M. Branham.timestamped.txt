[0:02] it's good to be gathered here today by
[0:04] God's grace oh thank you sir I
[0:06] appreciate that it's nice to have that
[0:09] uh Ephesians chapter
[0:19] 5:32 so while you're turning there I
[0:22] want to greet everybody in the name of
[0:23] the Lord Jesus uh my wife is finally
[0:25] able to make it today um and my our two
[0:28] youngest Genevie is five and Zion is
[0:31] three so our two youngest were able to
[0:33] make it all the older ones you know they
[0:35] got to hold up the this the service
[0:37] there and uh uh they're in acon by God's
[0:39] grace so uh we're very glad to have my
[0:42] wife and U looking forward to some
[0:44] wonderful Fellowship today by God's
[0:46] grace amen
[0:47] hallelujah I've been keeping track
[0:49] brother irin this is the 10th time I
[0:51] preach for the Saints here by God's
[0:53] grace uh April 2nd was the first time I
[0:57] and wasn't it down here was it down here
[0:59] that's right I think I drew some yeah
[1:01] some chalk and everything up here I
[1:03] think we're back where we started by
[1:05] God's
[1:06] grace so uh this morning I'd like to
[1:08] preach on uh the Revelation God's
[1:11] Prophet brother Ram taught us that the
[1:12] church is the bride so I want to preach
[1:15] on the Bride of Jesus
[1:17] Christ um it's plainly taught through
[1:20] the scripture and uh we would like
[1:22] everybody to see this wonderful
[1:24] Revelation today you know I was raised
[1:25] in a Pentecostal Church somebody was a
[1:28] God church I never heard that we were
[1:29] the bride and then after uh uh after I
[1:32] went to college I went to a Baptist
[1:34] Church I never heard anything about the
[1:35] bride but when I heard this message I
[1:37] started hearing about the bride
[1:39] Hallelujah and I found it all these
[1:42] verses right in the Bible praise God you
[1:44] know this whole Crescendo or the the
[1:47] climax of all human history is Jesus
[1:49] snatching away his bride hallelujah amen
[1:52] before the wrath of God is poured out
[1:54] that's what this is all about that's why
[1:55] we get so excited for weddings don't we
[1:58] hallelujah amen we get so excited for
[2:00] weddings is just a day of uh pure joy
[2:03] it's two Souls being united together a
[2:05] new family unit has been formed but the
[2:08] reason it's so beautiful is because it's
[2:10] a prefigure of Jesus coming to get you
[2:13] and I one day Hallelujah that's why it's
[2:16] so beautiful it's the climax of all
[2:18] history by God's
[2:21] grace so Ephesians 5:32 this a very
[2:24] familiar text if you've ever you know
[2:26] read Ephesians 5 you know the the end of
[2:28] this chapter is about husbands and wives
[2:30] and how husbands should love like Christ
[2:33] and and wives should submit in all
[2:35] things like the church and so this is a
[2:38] uh this is a important text here's where
[2:41] the Bible calls this a mystery this is
[2:43] why most churches don't know that they
[2:46] can be the bride most churches don't
[2:48] know that because it's a mystery it's
[2:50] hid from them but you and I Know It by
[2:53] God's grace Hallelujah Ephesians 5:32 I
[2:56] like if we could all read that together
[2:58] it starts with this is a great mystery
[2:59] let's read read that ready this is a
[3:01] great mystery but I speak concerning
[3:05] Christ and the church may God add his
[3:08] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[3:09] may be
[3:10] seated you know so I'm just going to
[3:12] review you know the first time I was
[3:13] here I preached on the mystery of God is
[3:14] finished I show you how brother Brandon
[3:16] fulfilled Revelation 10:7 then I preach
[3:19] on laying foundational Truth uh preached
[3:21] on tithes and offerings and other found
[3:24] foundational truths third time I
[3:26] preached on sound Doctrine versus
[3:28] doctrines of devils
[3:30] and it's so important to have the right
[3:32] Doctrine so important the Bible says if
[3:35] you have the right Doctrine you have
[3:36] both the father and the
[3:38] son
[3:40] Hallelujah that's in the book of uh 2
[3:43] John 8 and9 so Doctrine is so
[3:47] important uh then I preach on the
[3:49] revelation of the Seven Seals that was
[3:51] June 15th then I preach on the baptism
[3:53] of the Holy Ghost that was two two weeks
[3:55] later two weeks after that I preached on
[3:57] music and worship and that's kind of
[3:59] have been a uh uh a controversy around
[4:02] some of our churches in The Last 5
[4:04] Years so I'm I'm doing a teaching on
[4:07] that if you like more teaching on that
[4:09] let me know by God's grace we want to
[4:12] have the freedom of the Holy Spirit
[4:14] praise God brother said we have to have
[4:16] such a worship where the Holy Ghost can
[4:18] fall where it's an atmosphere of worship
[4:20] and people can be free in the Holy
[4:22] Spirit hallelujah amen
[4:25] hallelujah and brother Bram says
[4:27] wherever God is there's a lot of noise
[4:30] hallelujah praise God Amen so I like to
[4:32] get free and I like to like to enjoy my
[4:35] freedom as a Christian uh brother Ram
[4:37] says it's okay if you he said if you
[4:39] Pump Up the Music real loud and the
[4:41] people scream and dance and shout and
[4:43] then you turn off the music and
[4:44] everybody stops he said that's okay as
[4:46] long as the people live
[4:48] right Hallelujah so what's the main the
[4:50] main thing is live right Hallelujah some
[4:54] people are more emotional right some
[4:56] people like to shout anybody here like
[4:57] to shout anybody like to raise raise
[4:59] your hand yeah look at that see see now
[5:02] how many people don't like to shout now
[5:03] you don't have to raise your hand but
[5:05] maybe you're just more of a quiet person
[5:06] you're and what they call introvert is
[5:08] that what they call well I'm an
[5:09] extrovert When I Get Around Jesus or
[5:11] when I get around God's people I want to
[5:13] give brother irin a big hug and say
[5:14] glory to God Amen I Want to Be Free
[5:17] Hallelujah in the Holy
[5:19] Spirit and so we got to have the freedom
[5:22] to worship and then I preach on the
[5:24] anointed ones of the end times and how
[5:25] Satan cannot heal then I preach on the
[5:28] serpent seed and the last time I was
[5:29] here back in November I preached on the
[5:31] mystery of the godhead how many
[5:33] appreciate the message of the hour
[5:34] praise God I love it praise God this
[5:37] this uh message is my life I left
[5:39] everything I left all my friends my
[5:41] family my associates to follow this
[5:43] message and this is this message in
[5:45] other words the Bible scriptures God's
[5:47] fulfilling right now this is the focus
[5:49] of my life Hallelujah I pour I pour
[5:52] myself in this I preach sometimes three
[5:54] or four or five times a week I make
[5:56] podcasts I make YouTube videos I counsel
[5:58] people I take people's questions on
[6:00] every app my whole life centers around
[6:03] this message because it is Jesus Christ
[6:05] the same yesterday today and forever
[6:07] this is the message God is in right now
[6:09] praise God and that's what this is going
[6:11] to prove here this this uh preaching
[6:13] today is going to prove that uh by God's
[6:15] grace so we're at Ephesians 5:32 it's a
[6:18] great mystery concerning Christ and the
[6:22] church
[6:25] Hallelujah now
[6:27] um I want you to just remember that God
[6:30] Saves you based upon love I know some of
[6:32] you came out of the Amish movement and
[6:34] maybe the focus wasn't on love okay now
[6:37] where I come from there was a lot of
[6:40] talk about God's love I came out of the
[6:41] Pentecostal church and then a Baptist
[6:43] Church there was a lot of talk about
[6:45] love but it was almost too much love
[6:48] there wasn't enough teaching there
[6:49] wasn't enough
[6:51] warning right and so I think you know in
[6:54] our conversations it seemed like you
[6:55] know in some Amish communities there was
[6:57] it was too much fear there there wasn't
[6:59] enough love but I want you to know that
[7:02] Jesus loves you today amen hallelujah
[7:05] Ephesians 2:4 says but God who's rich in
[7:08] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[7:11] loved
[7:12] us God has great love for you that's why
[7:15] he sent his word to you praise God
[7:18] that's why he sent Jesus to die for you
[7:20] he doesn't have just love he has great
[7:22] love hallelujah
[7:24] amen and remember Romans chapter 8 at
[7:26] the end Paul lists 17 things that cannot
[7:30] separate you from the love of God
[7:33] hallelujah Heights nor depths nor angels
[7:35] or
[7:37] principalities fear there's nothing
[7:39] nothing can separate you from the love
[7:41] of God hallelujah amen thank you Jesus
[7:44] but God is going to allow your love to
[7:46] be tested that's what this this life is
[7:48] a testing time amen amen that's right
[7:51] Hallelujah and yes you'll feel God's
[7:53] love other times it'll seem like God's
[7:55] love is far away but we have to know
[7:58] that God said he loves us with a great
[7:59] love
[8:01] Hallelujah
[8:02] absolutely
[8:04] amen so there's a great mystery which
[8:07] church the mystery is which church is
[8:09] the bride now there are some churches
[8:12] that believe they're the
[8:14] bride uh or they call them the elect
[8:16] elect just means chosen The Chosen
[8:19] Church The Chosen bride
[8:22] Hallelujah so which church is the true
[8:25] church brother Ram said the beauty of a
[8:28] church is the character of its
[8:32] people hallelujah so you know we we
[8:35] drove by a big church today and it's a
[8:37] big oh it's a big massive Church there
[8:39] uh and lots of cars coming in they got
[8:42] people directing traffic so whatever
[8:45] they're preaching it it it attracts lots
[8:47] of people but I guarantee you they're
[8:49] not preaching what we're preaching
[8:51] today they might believe they're the
[8:53] bride but who who's to decide who the
[8:56] bride is the Bible is to decide who the
[8:58] bride is amen
[8:59] the holy spirit will decide who the
[9:02] Bride of Jesus Christ is
[9:03] hallelujah and you'll know her by her
[9:06] character and character is your moral
[9:09] makeup all the decisions you make up on
[9:11] right and wrong that's your character
[9:13] Hallelujah I know we got some real good
[9:15] character in this room by God's grace
[9:17] because I've seen it for the 10 times
[9:18] I've been with you and the couple times
[9:21] you've come up to akan to see me by
[9:22] God's grace in our our church there's
[9:25] Godly character here
[9:27] hallelujah so the true bride of Christ
[9:30] will have the character of Christ it
[9:33] will be their obedience to the
[9:37] Bible right I think you told me you know
[9:39] in one of your Amish groups they had a
[9:41] they had a a separate book about an inch
[9:43] and a half thick of all the laws you
[9:45] have to obey that W in the Bible I'm
[9:48] sorry the the bride doesn't have to obey
[9:50] extra commands outside the Bible the
[9:52] bride's got to obey the Bible praise God
[9:55] is that right Jesus said the man lives
[9:58] by every word that proceeds out of the
[10:01] mouth of God and the Bible said it's a
[10:03] sin to add anything to God's word right
[10:06] amen hallelujah the Bible says in
[10:09] Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 every word of God
[10:11] is pure the Bible said add thou not unto
[10:15] his words lest he call you a liar on the
[10:18] day of
[10:19] judgment I don't want God to call me a
[10:21] liar I I want God to say Well done good
[10:23] and faithful servant you've been
[10:24] faithful with a very little now I'll
[10:26] make you a ruler over much praise God
[10:29] I just want to be true to this right
[10:31] here I don't want to add anything on to
[10:32] it I just want to be true to this right
[10:34] here and the church
[10:35] said
[10:37] amen so the true bride will be obedient
[10:40] to the Bible
[10:42] commands
[10:44] Hallelujah and we'll just uh hit some
[10:46] scriptures here now Jesus said every
[10:48] tree is known by its fruit so every and
[10:51] he was talking about false prophets
[10:53] right so every every Prophet whether
[10:56] true or false is known by their actions
[11:00] and so if if we had a genuine Prophet
[11:02] which we did William brandham then he
[11:04] would be known by his fruits
[11:07] Hallelujah and you look at brother
[11:09] bram's life he was a Godly dedicated
[11:12] Christian one time Church you know this
[11:14] he turned on a check for
[11:16] $1,500 now how many of you would do
[11:20] that the man tries to get you know he he
[11:22] was just so happy my wife got healed let
[11:24] me give you 1,500 he said no I don't
[11:26] want anything to do with that money now
[11:28] that that's character right
[11:30] there in 1963 brother told a story and
[11:34] he said the Assemblies of God said
[11:36] brother Bram we want to hire you and
[11:38] join our group he said we will fly you
[11:41] around the country rather than driving
[11:42] brother Bram had to
[11:45] drive he said we'll increase your income
[11:48] by five times listen to is your life
[11:50] worthy of the Gospel you'll hear brother
[11:52] M tell this story he said we'll give you
[11:54] your own
[11:56] plane we'll increase your money by five
[11:59] times think about how much money that
[12:00] you would have if your income went up
[12:02] five
[12:05] times he said well and we'll set up
[12:07] meetings in all the big cities he said
[12:10] you'll go preach to the up and UPS
[12:11] instead of these down and outs I'm glad
[12:13] to be a down and out praise
[12:16] hallelujah hallelujah praise God because
[12:20] God rebukes the prideful but he has
[12:22] Grace upon the humble Hallelujah so look
[12:24] look at the Devil saying I'll give you
[12:26] five times a mount I'll give you plane
[12:28] you'll go all the big churches he said
[12:30] if you'll just change a few things on
[12:32] your preaching brother and brother knew
[12:35] it was a trap he said and I knew it was
[12:36] Satan he says for instance what brother
[12:39] what do you want me to compromise
[12:42] on he said well if you could just you
[12:45] know stop preaching against women
[12:46] preachers and they said what else what
[12:49] else uh you know stop preaching that
[12:52] serpent seed and brother man said that's
[12:54] the killer remember that one that would
[12:56] break all the fellowship if somebody
[12:58] somebody don't like serpent seed that
[13:00] kills your friendship right there they
[13:02] don't want to talk to you anymore right
[13:04] he said anything else yeah you know that
[13:07] that you know you got to say tongues are
[13:09] the evidence of the Holy Ghost and uh
[13:12] and they said you know the water baptism
[13:14] you got to you know baptized in the
[13:15] father son Holy Ghost and brother man
[13:17] said I'm ashamed of you I I'm surprised
[13:20] a man like you that would call me a
[13:22] prophet would ask me to compromise on
[13:25] the thing that means more than life
[13:27] itself Hallelujah but said no I will not
[13:30] take your offer amen I'll turn on the
[13:33] money the popularity the pl the easier
[13:35] life I'll turn that down that's
[13:37] Christlike character hallelujah
[13:40] amen he said don't ask me to compromise
[13:43] on the thing that means more than life
[13:45] to me
[13:46] hallelujah amen I love that amen the
[13:50] more I listen to brother Ram the more I
[13:51] see Christlike character in his life
[13:54] amen
[13:55] hallelujah so church that ought to be a
[13:57] great lesson the one thing we should
[13:59] never compromise is on the word of
[14:05] God now see we have to judge the Bible
[14:09] said prove all things judge every tree
[14:12] we can judge every Church the Roman
[14:14] Catholic Church the Baptist the
[14:16] Presbyterian the Seven Day Adventist
[14:18] Jehovah's Witnesses we need to judge all
[14:20] the judge their fruit I think a brother
[14:23] called it one time we are fruit
[14:24] inspectors amen right right those of you
[14:28] who have uh yeah farms and harvest and
[14:31] everything like that don't you go out
[14:32] and inspect your fruit see what kind of
[14:34] harvest you got by God's
[14:35] grace that's what we do as as Christians
[14:38] we examine every group now we even do it
[14:41] in the message don't we brother Levi
[14:42] amen that's right fact right we got to
[14:45] judge because not all message our messag
[14:48] amen let me say this Martin Luther at
[14:51] the end of his life said I'll be I'll be
[14:53] happy if 10% of our baptisms actually
[14:56] stay with the truth
[14:59] that's the same that it happens in every
[15:01] generation just so you know not all
[15:03] message Believers are message Believers
[15:05] amen that's
[15:07] right Jesus had 70 preachers that left
[15:11] him 71 sorry
[15:14] Judas he only had 11 faithful ones and
[15:17] the church said amen 70 that means 70
[15:21] men went 71 sorry 71 went out and spread
[15:23] all these other false doctrines they
[15:25] they called Jesus oh uh he he he's a
[15:28] false teacher cannibal that's the word
[15:31] there he's a cannibal he said oh you got
[15:32] to eat my flesh and drink my blood think
[15:35] about that 71 preachers went out and
[15:37] said he's a cannibal
[15:39] preacher but they didn't have the
[15:41] Revelation that's the same thing that's
[15:43] happened in brother R's Ministry amen he
[15:45] was a true man of God but we've had 71
[15:48] go out and the Devils deceive them and
[15:51] they've loved the things of the world
[15:52] more than the word of God Amen that's
[15:54] right how do you know I judge their
[15:56] fruit that's right if they live live in
[15:58] sin if they lie if they tell false
[16:00] Doctrine false Doctrine is a leaven
[16:03] false Doctrine is a yeast amen and it
[16:06] corrupts the whole church the whole
[16:08] teaching but the Bible said we are in
[16:10] the Feast of Christ where we have
[16:12] unleavened bread Hallelujah that's right
[16:14] we have the word of God we have the
[16:16] preaching from the Bible with no leant
[16:18] brother Daniel
[16:19] Hallelujah we got unleavened word it's
[16:22] just word upon word upon word upon
[16:24] commandment Hallelujah and then there's
[16:26] life in the word of God the word of God
[16:28] is truth cuz Jesus is the way the truth
[16:30] and the life hallelujah amen
[16:34] hallelujah see I was raised in
[16:37] denomination so I saw their fruits
[16:38] growing up brother John there's this one
[16:40] guy and I was raised in a church where
[16:42] they said you got to speak in tongues
[16:43] and I was like I never agree with that
[16:44] but but there's one guy a young guy he's
[16:47] probably 15 or 20 he would speak in
[16:49] tongues like every time but then he
[16:52] would go in the church he would steal
[16:54] spoons from the church and go sell them
[16:56] he would like you know bend them and and
[16:59] yeah Simon and I Simon Cam and I saw
[17:01] that and we were just like I thought
[17:03] these guys spoke in tongues and were
[17:05] real they're
[17:06] thieves wow now they might have a gift
[17:09] to speak in tongues there's nothing
[17:10] wrong with speaking in tongues but if
[17:12] you have a gift but you don't live good
[17:14] Godly character it doesn't amount to
[17:16] nothing amen you can speak in tongues
[17:18] with uh men and angels He said but if
[17:20] you don't have love if you don't have
[17:22] love for the word of God love to obey
[17:23] the word of God it profits you nothing
[17:25] praise God Amen that's right and bless
[17:27] that little baby to to to sleep through
[17:29] my preaching there praise God God bless
[17:31] that little child there I don't know how
[17:32] they do
[17:33] that you would think all the screaming
[17:35] and shouting and clapping but yeah God
[17:38] gives them sweet peace amen but see that
[17:41] that's what I saw there and then when I
[17:42] went to the Baptist Church I mean they
[17:43] were good people they were a little
[17:45] deeper in the word of God than the
[17:47] Pentecostals but then they would watch
[17:48] dirty movies and some of the guys would
[17:51] say after church they say let me go hug
[17:53] these girls I want to hug them up and I
[17:55] want their their chest to press up
[17:57] against my chest I thought this this is
[17:59] what what this is what and and I was
[18:03] like I was so brother John the whole
[18:04] time I'm like there's got to be more
[18:05] there's got to be more and then the
[18:06] message came to me I knew there was more
[18:08] Hallelujah because the Bible said
[18:10] there's a deep call to the Deep
[18:12] hallelujah amen that's right if there's
[18:14] a deep call there's got to be a deep to
[18:16] respond Hallelujah that's right remember
[18:19] Simon prayed in the closet for three
[18:21] months God send me a message if there's
[18:23] a greater message send me the message
[18:25] and then the message came to brother
[18:26] Simon Hallelujah praise God Amen God had
[18:30] message Believers right in the factory
[18:31] where he worked there in Archbold Ohio
[18:34] brother Dave lell and brother Freddy uh
[18:37] Boer brother Craig Boer praise God see
[18:40] if there's a deep call if there's a deep
[18:42] desire to be the bride then there's a
[18:44] deep respond to it praise God Amen God
[18:47] is going to call out his bride
[18:49] Hallelujah now I'm way off my notes but
[18:51] praise the Lord anyhow praise God the
[18:53] Bible said prove all things hold fast
[18:55] that which is good try every Spirit
[18:58] whether they're the spirit of God that's
[18:59] how I know brother R's a prophet as well
[19:01] he was right on all of his major
[19:03] doctrines but he was still a man and
[19:06] brother random could be corrected did
[19:08] you know brother random said my wife is
[19:10] my correction did everybody know that he
[19:12] said you husbands know what I'm talking
[19:15] about I want to hear some husband say
[19:17] Amen my wife corrects me all the time
[19:20] things I'm thinking like I'll just say
[19:22] hey maybe I'll go to this she's like
[19:23] Jesse can't do
[19:25] that that's what brother said but said
[19:28] my wife is my
[19:30] correction see cuz he was a man but I
[19:32] love it he was so humble he could accept
[19:35] correction from his wife now of course
[19:36] she wasn't yelling at him screaming at
[19:38] him pounding pans brother brandom you
[19:40] got to do this you know she got to she
[19:42] got to keep her Christian character you
[19:45] know
[19:47] Hallelujah and there's one quote she
[19:49] said she said bill I didn't know you
[19:51] could be wrong on so many things and
[19:53] brother BR laughs and says you're right
[19:54] about that
[19:56] ma yeah I got got the
[20:00] quotes so in other words we we we we we
[20:03] we recognize brother Ram as a a true man
[20:05] of God by his prophecies by his healings
[20:07] by his discernment by his thus sayith
[20:09] the Lords those are all true but in
[20:11] another way at home he was a man as he
[20:14] traveled he was a man and he needed
[20:16] correction as well amen that's what I
[20:18] love about brother random Hallelujah I
[20:20] see the character of
[20:23] Christ brother R was so humble brother
[20:26] Ram said in one place he said you forget
[20:28] about me he said stop stop paying
[20:31] attention to the messenger he said you
[20:33] pay attention to the message amen that's
[20:36] right brother Brandon said if you put
[20:37] too much emphasis on the messenger God
[20:39] will take him off the scene and that's
[20:42] personally what I believe why God took
[20:44] him at just 56 years old think of that
[20:46] brother God took the prophet at 56 years
[20:50] old but God had to do it we we're
[20:53] reading that book called Generations you
[20:54] ever seen that book called Generations
[20:56] it written by Brother R's uh
[20:57] granddaughter George Smith's daughter is
[20:59] it
[21:01] Angel Angela yeah Angel Angela Smith she
[21:05] put together 38 testimonies of people
[21:07] that lived by brother brandham or knew
[21:09] brother brandham really well and some of
[21:11] these brothers were saying you know we
[21:12] leaned upon brother brandham for
[21:14] everything you know think about that
[21:16] every time you got a cough they would
[21:17] call Brother brand can you pray for my
[21:19] cough well where's your faith you know
[21:23] but that's what they said we leaned on
[21:24] brother Brown too much and then after he
[21:26] went off the scene we were kind of
[21:28] awesome where do we go where do we go to
[21:30] for prayer how about Jesus is that a
[21:33] good option now don't get me wrong it's
[21:36] okay to use a gift if someone has a gift
[21:37] of God like a prophet yes you want to go
[21:40] to the gift of God but see he said we
[21:42] focus too much on brother brandom we
[21:44] need to get back more to Jesus
[21:46] Hallelujah that's right see see people
[21:49] that that's just how humanity is Right
[21:51] Humanity just puts too much emphasis
[21:53] sometimes on a man and not enough not
[21:56] enough Focus or emphasis on Jesus Christ
[21:59] who sent the man Hallelujah but God has
[22:01] a way to correct his children
[22:04] Hallelujah now remember uh we try the
[22:07] spirits and remember John 16:13 the Holy
[22:10] Ghost will guide you into all truth I've
[22:12] seen that ever since I came in the
[22:14] message God is guiding us into more
[22:17] truth all the time because more and more
[22:19] heresies pop up in the message I'm not
[22:22] talking about Lutheran or Methodist I'm
[22:23] talking about message
[22:25] heresies more of them rise up but do we
[22:28] know they're heresies because they go
[22:29] against the word of God Amen that's
[22:32] right and they'll go against quotes from
[22:33] Brother brandom Hallelujah that's right
[22:36] that's how we know and I found God
[22:39] guiding us into more truth all the
[22:42] time
[22:44] Hallelujah now Jesus Christ himself said
[22:47] he
[22:48] is the bride okay let's go to Mark 2:19
[22:53] Mark 2:19 now I'm going to try to preach
[22:56] today I'm I'm just going going to preach
[22:58] as long as I can here today by God's
[23:00] grace hope that's okay like brother said
[23:03] if you need to stand up and stretch your
[23:04] legs he says stand up and stret your
[23:10] legs I want you to see this through the
[23:12] Bible and I'll Trust to be a blessing
[23:14] Mark 2 19 and Jesus said unto them can
[23:18] the children of the Bride chamber fast
[23:20] while the bridegroom is with them so he
[23:22] calls himself I'm the husband I'm the
[23:25] bridegroom as long as they have the
[23:27] rroom with them they cannot fast but the
[23:29] days will come when the bridegroom shall
[23:31] be taken away from them and then shall
[23:33] they fast in those days praise God so
[23:37] Jesus says I'm the husband
[23:40] Hallelujah is that is that plain to
[23:42] everybody can everybody see that all
[23:44] right now there's three Parables well
[23:47] here you know what while we're there
[23:48] let's go to John chapter 3 Mark uh Luke
[23:50] John Mark I'm sorry John 328 let's go to
[23:52] John 3:28 let's just go
[23:56] here
[24:01] brother brandom said the Holy Ghost will
[24:03] always direct you to the word can we all
[24:05] say the word the word the Holy Ghost
[24:08] will always direct you to the word of
[24:10] God on every question whether it's a
[24:11] question about brother Ram's life or
[24:13] question about the doctrine or the
[24:14] church or Miracles every question must
[24:17] go back to the word of God hallelujah
[24:20] brother Ram said if I die he said if I
[24:22] die in my tracks right now he said my
[24:25] absolute is the Bible amen amen
[24:28] Hallelujah there's one quote people
[24:30] misunderstand but brother R said he's
[24:32] doing questions and answers at his home
[24:34] church and he said it was just a men's
[24:36] meeting it was questions and answers
[24:38] 1963 it was uh December
[24:41] 26th right after Christmas and brother
[24:44] Bram said you Brethren you leaders in
[24:45] the church you kind of look to me as an
[24:49] absolute okay that's a quote people
[24:52] misunderstand and that becomes a heresy
[24:55] because now every word on brother Ram's
[24:56] tapes is thus say the Lord that's
[24:59] heresy absolutely he said you kind of
[25:02] look to me as an absolute but he wasn't
[25:05] saying I was the absolute because all
[25:07] the other quotes brother Daniel brother
[25:08] Bram says the Bible's the absolute
[25:11] amen and what brother Bram says you said
[25:13] in a church you can't have two heads a
[25:15] two-headed monster is a very dangerous
[25:17] thing right that's what brother R says
[25:20] he says you got to have one leader in a
[25:21] church and it's the
[25:23] pastor right and all the questions got
[25:25] to go back to one person for the answer
[25:27] that's how God set up the pastor is the
[25:28] shepherd over the flock the P Pastor the
[25:31] shepherd leads the flock and so brother
[25:33] Ram said you kind of look to me as your
[25:36] absolute but don't let anybody tell you
[25:39] brother brandham is the absolute brother
[25:40] Bram never said he was the absolute he
[25:43] said you Brothers kind of look to me to
[25:44] the absolute Hallelujah and there's so
[25:47] many times he said the Bible's the
[25:49] absolute God is the absolute the Holy
[25:51] Ghost is the absolute that's true praise
[25:53] God John
[25:56] 3:28
[25:59] ye yourselves bear witness to me that I
[26:00] said I am not the Christ but that I am
[26:02] sent before him he that hath the bride
[26:05] there's the first time the bride is used
[26:07] there in the New Testament he that hath
[26:09] the bride is the bridegroom now this is
[26:12] John the
[26:13] Baptist so Jesus already said I'm the
[26:16] bridegroom and now John says the person
[26:19] that has the bride is the bridegroom so
[26:21] John says Jesus has a bride oh is that
[26:24] beautiful John the Baptist recognized
[26:27] the bride of Christ because he had the
[26:29] spirit of Elijah brother random comes
[26:31] he's got the spirit of Elijah and he
[26:33] points out the Bride of Jesus Christ
[26:34] hallelujah amen in other words John the
[26:37] Baptist and brother R were both
[26:38] forerunners of the coming of
[26:41] Christ Hallelujah and both said Jesus
[26:45] Christ has a bride how many believe
[26:47] there in that bride today amen I believe
[26:49] it by God's grace every hand should be
[26:51] up praise
[26:52] God because you're within hearing of the
[26:55] true word of God today if you went to
[26:57] the the Pentecostal church or the
[26:58] Baptist you wouldn't hear the true word
[27:00] of God today you know a lot of them God
[27:02] bless sister Rachel how you doing good
[27:04] to see you did you get that book in the
[27:05] mail I did all right praise
[27:09] God you know you you you you'll hear
[27:12] Baptist and Pentecostals they'll talk
[27:14] about a national
[27:16] Revival and they'll think America's
[27:18] going to get a national Revival brother
[27:20] brand said it's thus sayith the Lord
[27:21] America's past
[27:23] Revival now who's got the message of the
[27:26] hour it ain't the Baptists and the
[27:29] Pentecostals see what they're confusing
[27:32] is the Revival for the Antichrist that's
[27:34] the Revival America is going to have
[27:36] they're all going to follow the
[27:39] Antichrist the whole world is going to
[27:41] follow the
[27:43] Antichrist
[27:44] Hallelujah so who who we going to
[27:46] believe we're going to believe
[27:47] denominations or man who had thus sayith
[27:49] the Lord and who points us back to the
[27:51] Bible hallelujah we're going to follow
[27:53] God's Prophet brother brandom Hallelujah
[27:56] and I'm recording this too I'm going to
[27:57] I put put these on YouTube by God's
[27:58] grace the people like them they like to
[28:00] hear uh people tell me all the time they
[28:02] say I love to see God save the Amish
[28:04] people and bring them into the the light
[28:06] of the gospel because now you're no
[28:08] longer Amish now you're Holy Ghost filed
[28:10] Christians amen just like I'm no longer
[28:13] Baptist I'm no longer Pentecostal now
[28:15] I'm a holy ghost filled
[28:17] Christian
[28:20] Glory 29 no I already yeah 29 he that
[28:24] hath the bride is the bridegroom but the
[28:25] friend of the bridegroom which standeth
[28:27] and Heth him rejoices greatly because of
[28:29] the bridegroom's voice what makes you
[28:31] happy what makes you happy is hearing
[28:33] the voice of Jesus amen that's what
[28:35] brings you Joy Hallelujah to to know
[28:38] Jesus's word to know him is life
[28:41] Hallelujah to know his Bible's life
[28:44] because he wrote the Bible praise God
[28:48] Amen this is my joy therefore is
[28:51] fulfilled in verse 29 verse 30 he must
[28:54] increase but I must decrease so John the
[28:56] Baptist had to de increase so they could
[28:58] Focus On Christ the same thing with
[29:00] brother brandom brother Bram had to
[29:01] decrease he had to go off the scene and
[29:03] now Jesus increases amen amen like I
[29:07] said now people don't run to brother
[29:08] Rand for every answer we go to Jesus for
[29:10] every answer praise God that's right
[29:12] Jesus Christ must increase your prayers
[29:15] must increase Hallelujah your worship
[29:17] must increase and it all goes back to
[29:19] Jesus
[29:21] Christ
[29:23] Glory
[29:26] now there are three Parables about Jesus
[29:30] as a husband there's
[29:34] three uh we're not going to read all of
[29:36] them because I want to I want to uh save
[29:38] a little bit of time here Matthew 22
[29:40] 1-14 is the King's son Parable Jesus is
[29:45] the engaged son whose father is throwing
[29:48] him a wedding and everyone that comes to
[29:51] the wedding must wear the right
[29:53] garments how many know the symbols of
[29:56] that what's the symbol of the white
[29:58] garment what's that represent does
[29:59] anybody know close the baptism of the
[30:02] Holy Ghost because without that garment
[30:04] you're not getting into the wedding amen
[30:06] that's right that's good though it is it
[30:08] is true Purity true Purity is being born
[30:11] again
[30:12] beautiful remember one guy gets kicked
[30:15] out and they said how'd you get in here
[30:16] he said I climbed another way and
[30:18] brother uses that to to show how see you
[30:21] got to come through Christ because he's
[30:22] the way right the truth and the life
[30:25] that's right and I like that too I
[30:27] preach it like this I preach like this
[30:29] right before the Rapture the Holy Ghost
[30:31] is going to sweep down through the
[30:32] church and going to take out all the
[30:33] people that aren't born again because
[30:36] that's what happens in the parable is't
[30:37] that beautiful I believe that'll be the
[30:39] latter rain brother talk about thus say
[30:41] the Lord the latter rain the last
[30:42] Revival before the Rapture the king of
[30:45] glory amen the the father God the Holy
[30:47] Ghost is going to sweep through the
[30:48] church and anyone not born again is
[30:50] going to be taken out I don't know how
[30:53] right because we don't know the day or
[30:54] the hour no man knows the day or the
[30:55] hour some will be in the field when the
[30:56] rapture happens some will be in the bed
[30:58] think about that you go to bed you wake
[31:00] up the next moment now you're in the
[31:01] Rapture that'd be a great that'd be a
[31:03] great way to wake up from sleep praise
[31:05] God that'd be better than any nice dream
[31:07] you could have in your bed right you
[31:09] wake up and you're at the meeting in the
[31:10] air with Jesus praise God oh
[31:13] my but that's the first Parable Jesus is
[31:16] the son and he's getting
[31:19] married Hallelujah and he needs a bride
[31:23] Hallelujah the second Parable is the 10
[31:25] virgins this is the most familiar
[31:27] Matthew 25
[31:29] 1-13 now what's the difference between
[31:32] the wise and foolish virgins the wise
[31:34] virgins had oil who knows what the oil
[31:36] represents Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit
[31:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[31:40] soul you got to have it right in
[31:43] here so see any requirement for a
[31:45] wedding the symbol is going to be what
[31:47] you need to get there the baptism of the
[31:49] Holy Ghost Hallelujah you got to have
[31:52] the white garments the Bible said uh
[31:54] White is the righteousness of the Saints
[31:57] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:00] the second Parable you got to have the
[32:01] oil and Zechariah Chapter 4 shows the
[32:04] oil is the holy spirit because the oil
[32:07] is from the two anointed ones right
[32:10] Moses and Elijah also is was Z Zechariah
[32:13] and Hagi from Zechariah Chapter 4 there
[32:16] are these two trees right and the Bible
[32:18] calls them the the the Bible calls them
[32:20] the anointed ones and uh God tells Zer
[32:24] I'll do this not by might not by power
[32:27] but by my spirit sayeth the Lord oh
[32:30] Church don't worry we know how God's
[32:31] going to Rapture the church it's not by
[32:33] your might it's not by your power but
[32:35] it's by my spirit sayith the Lord
[32:37] hallelujah God's spir if God's spirit
[32:39] got them ready for the day of Pentecost
[32:41] then God's spirit will get us ready for
[32:42] the Rapture hallelujah amen hallelujah
[32:46] think about that they were lost without
[32:48] Jesus guiding them to the day of
[32:50] Pentecost I mean they they were running
[32:53] away brother John they were scatter
[32:54] Peter's like I'll go with you to the
[32:56] cross and then a few hours later he runs
[32:59] away you know we have we we are not
[33:02] sufficient to get ourselves ready for
[33:04] the Rapture Jesus is going to get us
[33:06] ready for the Rapture praise God and if
[33:09] you want to go in the Rapture then Jesus
[33:11] will hold it off until you're ready to
[33:13] go in the
[33:14] Rapture it's exactly right Hallelujah
[33:17] the Rapture cannot go if you want to go
[33:19] and your desires to go the reason you
[33:21] got to desire is because your name is
[33:23] written on the Lamb's Book of Life in
[33:24] heaven Hallelujah but man said if you
[33:26] didn't have that desire he said brother
[33:29] BR said if you have that desire that
[33:30] proves your name is written on the
[33:32] Lamb's Book of Life in heaven Hallelujah
[33:35] brother said if your name wasn't there
[33:37] you wouldn't even desire it think about
[33:40] most of our friends most of our family
[33:41] they're not concerned about the
[33:43] Rapture but what's different about you
[33:45] you've got a desire you got something on
[33:48] the inside of you that God has placed
[33:50] there hallelujah amen and the Bible said
[33:52] if you Delight in the Lord God will give
[33:54] you the desires of your heart hallelujah
[33:56] amen
[33:57] our greatest desire should be for the
[33:59] wedding between Christ and the church
[34:01] hallelujah amen be our greatest desire
[34:06] amen all right now I showed you those
[34:08] verses now the the last
[34:12] Parable is uh Luke 14 it's called the
[34:15] Great supper Luke 141 15- 24 Christ is
[34:19] the host of a great supper and this is
[34:22] like the great marriage supper of the
[34:23] Lamb how we know the marriage supper of
[34:24] the Lamb scripture it's Revelation 19
[34:27] 199 so there's a parable of a great
[34:31] supper and the Messiah again connects
[34:33] himself with an upcoming marriage and
[34:36] his position as the
[34:38] bridegroom he's throwing a great
[34:41] supper and what's the difference in that
[34:43] Parable you had to come and gather at
[34:46] the supper remember that's the parable
[34:47] everybody made an
[34:49] excuse well I could never get rid of my
[34:51] makeup that's an
[34:52] excuse a lot of churches say that one
[34:55] right well I could never sh shout and
[34:57] scream and and and boohoo at the altar
[34:59] that's an excuse they won't come to the
[35:00] wedding supper I can never receive the
[35:03] Holy Ghost I can never act like
[35:06] that I I I could never believe God sent
[35:08] a prophet well that's just an
[35:10] excuse I could never go to church three
[35:13] times a week or four times a
[35:15] week I could never line up my entire
[35:17] life to the word of God that's excuses
[35:20] but see God's people won't make excuses
[35:22] God God's people will find a way for
[35:25] Jesus to create in them the kind of
[35:27] character that Jesus's bride must have
[35:29] Hallelujah that's
[35:32] right Jesus's bride will let him
[35:35] transform Her Mind by the renewing of
[35:37] the Holy Spirit As Romans 121 and2 says
[35:41] amen that's right brother Daniel think
[35:43] about it how many times has your mind
[35:44] been transformed since you've heard this
[35:46] message brother uran think about it how
[35:49] many times wow I'm
[35:51] transformed I got a I got the opposite
[35:54] thought on that
[35:55] scripture right right brother Levi amen
[35:58] that's right Hallelujah you're just
[36:01] transformed and that's what God has
[36:03] donees that's what God is doing to make
[36:04] you the bride he constantly has to
[36:06] transform your thinking and that in turn
[36:09] transforms your actions your
[36:11] character

[37:47] voice and she speaks what the spirit
[37:50] says how do I know what the spirit says
[37:51] brother Jesse because it's already
[37:53] written in the word of
[37:54] God so sisters you can Witness you can
[37:56] invite people to church remember that
[37:58] woman in John chapter 4 the Samaritan
[38:00] woman at the well the Bible said she
[38:02] went down the city and she told them
[38:04] come see a man who told me everything I
[38:07] did and brother BR said God used her to
[38:10] save almost the entire city a
[38:13] woman she wasn't preaching brother said
[38:16] she was
[38:17] testifying that's what you sisters can
[38:19] do tell your testimonies tell your
[38:21] dreams right that are spiritual dreams
[38:23] tell about your healing tell about your
[38:25] transformation you sister can be used by
[38:27] God to share those testimonies praise
[38:29] God brother said she was so on fire she
[38:32] was like a house on fire on a windy day
[38:34] praise
[38:35] God in other words you ain't going to
[38:37] shut down these testimonies may God help
[38:39] us to have testimonies that glorify God
[38:41] hallelujah amen that's a
[38:44] woman so see sisters you have your place
[38:47] to share your testimonies right and also
[38:50] I believe this a woman brother man said
[38:53] a woman can have all nine gifts of the
[38:55] Holy Spirit
[38:57] some of those are actual words you speak
[38:59] like words of wisdom and words of
[39:02] knowledge and that's where I believe
[39:04] like my wife has I believe my wife has
[39:05] some of those gifts because I haven't
[39:07] understood certain things and she'll
[39:09] just speak something and it will give me
[39:10] the wisdom I need to do
[39:13] it but she has to open her mouth and
[39:16] speak
[39:17] right just like that woman at the at the
[39:20] well she had to open her mouth to run
[39:22] down in the city she had to
[39:25] testify so this is part of the book of
[39:28] Acts Church being restored remember
[39:30] Philip had four virgin daughters who
[39:34] prophesied imagine sitting in a surface
[39:36] like this and a single sister who's a
[39:38] virgin prophesies and said thus sayith
[39:40] the Lord Brother Jesse don't go there
[39:42] tomorrow because there's going to be an
[39:43] avalanche or something thus sayith the
[39:44] Lord and imagine it happen praise God
[39:47] I'd say I'd say that make us real
[39:49] reverent to the spirit of God don't
[39:51] you that's what they had in the book of
[39:53] Acts virgin daughters who prophesied and
[39:56] it came to pass many times is through
[40:00] dreams
[40:03] right so if we are going to be the Bride
[40:05] of Jesus Christ then like brother man
[40:07] said we've got to be restored back to
[40:08] the book of Acts Hallelujah and church
[40:11] we like I tell our church all the time
[40:12] we are we are continuation of the book
[40:14] of Acts we're just in the process of
[40:18] restoration right before the Rapture
[40:20] brother Levi I believe it's going to be
[40:22] brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord
[40:23] the fullness of Pentecost will be in the
[40:26] bride thus sayeth the Lord amen so the
[40:29] closer we get to the Rapture the closer
[40:31] we going to see things like the lame
[40:34] walking like limbs being healed
[40:37] Hallelujah the closer we get because
[40:40] it's thus sayth the Lord the fullness of
[40:42] Pentecost will be in the bride
[40:44] hallelujah
[40:47] amen and that's according to the Bible
[40:50] That's Joel 2 23-26 brother Bram tells
[40:53] us see brother Bram wouldn't give us a
[40:55] prophecy if it dis agree with the Bible
[40:57] it be right with the Bible
[40:59] hallelujah
[41:02] amen so the the Bible many times speaks
[41:05] of a
[41:06] bride and remember Revelation 21 the
[41:09] city of God the future home descends as
[41:12] a
[41:13] bride Hallelujah that that City
[41:15] represents a bride right it's like a
[41:18] it's like a descending pyramid it
[41:20] descends as a bride and the Earth is
[41:22] like the
[41:24] husband right the city descends like a
[41:27] bride she's beautiful the Bible says
[41:28] she's adorned in Gold transparent gold
[41:31] jewels Gates my she's beautiful and she
[41:36] comes down and she unites with the
[41:38] husband Hallelujah and this is the home
[41:41] of Jesus's bride Hallelujah so the
[41:44] future home that's the home of Jesus and
[41:47] his
[41:48] bride that's their uh that's their
[41:50] permanent
[41:51] address you can you'll look you'll look

[42:14] the word of God we won't compromise on
[42:17] God's word
[42:18] hallelujah just like the days of
[42:21] Jesus all right so we're seeing all
[42:23] these good
[42:24] verses now raise your hand I don't know
[42:27] if I need to go over this but how many
[42:28] know that Israel was married to God but
[42:31] then God divorced them raise your hand
[42:33] have you studied that couple okay one
[42:35] two three okay four five okay well let
[42:37] me just go over this since maybe half of
[42:39] you have read that in Ezekiel 16 we're
[42:42] not going to read it but that's where
[42:44] God says I found Israel like a child
[42:47] lying in its blood you know kind of
[42:49] reminds me of the Good Samaritan Parable
[42:51] right half dead right God says I found
[42:54] Israel like a little girl lying in blood
[42:56] but I picked her up I healed her and she
[42:58] grew up and became a beautiful woman and
[43:00] I married her but then she played the
[43:04] Harlot and I had to put her
[43:07] away okay then in Jeremiah God says I
[43:11] divorc
[43:13] Israel
[43:14] Hallelujah let's read that Jeremiah 3:8
[43:17] brother John you want to read that I'm
[43:18] gonna start having you some of you
[43:19] Saints read for me
[43:20] here Jeremiah 3:8 yep Jeremiah 3:8
[43:24] whenever you're ready everybody listen
[43:25] here
[43:29] and I saw when for all the causes
[43:31] whereby backsliding Israel committed
[43:34] adultery I had put her away and given
[43:37] her a bill of divorce yet her
[43:38] treacherous sister Judah feared not but
[43:41] went and played the Harlot also amen I
[43:44] gave her a bill of divorcement God loved
[43:47] Israel so much he redeemed her he
[43:49] brought her out of Egypt for crying out
[43:51] loud can I say that he brought her out
[43:53] of slavery right I brought you out of
[43:55] the this system I strengthen you
[43:57] Hallelujah I sent you Moses and Joshua
[44:00] David I said I put you in the promised
[44:01] land but then what they do Solomon was
[44:03] one started it he he built all these
[44:06] Idols to all these false gods asth all
[44:09] these gods and then what happened after
[44:11] that church is all downhill every now
[44:12] and then you had a Revival in a
[44:13] generation but it was all
[44:16] downhill till God says I'm divorcing you
[44:19] all right can everybody see
[44:22] that now how about in the Jeremiah 3:14
[44:25] brother you got that Jeremiah 34 can you
[44:27] read verse 14
[44:30] brother turn oh back sliding children
[44:33] says the Lord for I am married unto you
[44:37] and I will take you one of his City and
[44:41] two of a family and I will bring you to
[44:43] Zion
[44:45] amen so God has to divorce
[44:49] Israel but but he says I'm married to
[44:51] you but you haven't been true to me so
[44:53] I've got to put you away Hal
[44:56] Hallelujah now how about verse 20 um
[45:00] Sister Sarah do you got verse 20
[45:01] Jeremiah 3:20 could you read that 3:20
[45:10] please
[45:12] amen sister Ruth you want to read verse
[45:14] 22 because here it speaks of I will heal
[45:17] your backsliding although you've been
[45:18] untrue to me I will heal you want to
[45:20] read that s return ye backsliding
[45:23] children and I will heal your back
[45:26] behold we come
[45:29] the amen isn't God so gracious he
[45:32] married a woman Israel who's untrue to
[45:34] him all the time she's so Unfaithful but
[45:37] he says if you just return I'll receive
[45:40] you talk about Grace amen talk about
[45:43] Grace and this was typed in hosea's
[45:47] marriage how many know how many remember
[45:49] Hosea God told him go marry a harlot on
[45:52] purpose because I'm going to show Israel
[45:54] about the husband I've been to I've been
[45:56] to
[45:57] Israel he marries a harlot they have two
[45:59] children and then she goes off in more
[46:01] harlotry but in chapter three he goes to
[46:04] the slave yard and he buys her back he
[46:06] purchases her he purchases her back with
[46:09] all that he has Hallelujah and that's
[46:11] what Jesus did hallelujah amen that's
[46:13] right Jesus gave all of his life
[46:15] Hallelujah he gave all that he was in
[46:17] order to purchase Israel with his own
[46:19] blood and he didn't just purchase Israel
[46:21] he purchased the whole world the Bible
[46:23] says amen he he paid for the sin of
[46:26] Israel but not only Israel but all the
[46:28] Gentiles as
[46:29] well that is another proof that God was
[46:32] in brother Ram's message because brother
[46:34] R could bring out all these Old
[46:35] Testament types of the of the Bride of
[46:38] Jesus
[46:39] Christ

[48:41] test you and try you we'll get to that
[48:43] you know with Hebrews chapter 12 every
[48:44] Son of God must be tried that means
[48:47] spank cha the word chasing means to hit
[48:50] and spank we don't like to go through
[48:52] that but sometimes disobedient children
[48:53] need a good spanking right right and so
[48:58] it's you know it's it's true we're his
[49:00] bride in one way but we're also like
[49:01] little children growing up to be a
[49:03] mature woman praise God

[49:22] Delights in the Believers as a husband
[49:24] rejoices over over his
[49:26] wife
[49:30] Hallelujah now the Bible also says this
[49:33] let's go to acts 15:14 brother Levi do
[49:35] you want to read that or you
[49:38] recorded sorry brother
[49:42] [Music]
[49:46] 15:14 sister Annie could you get Romans
[49:48] 9 can you I I think it's 9:25
[49:52] here yep it's 9:25 so uh brother Levi
[49:56] acts 15:14 and sister Annie Romans 9:25
[50:00] okay brother Levi whenever you're ready
[50:06] brother Simon has declared how God at
[50:11] the first did visit the Gentiles to take
[50:14] out of them a people for his name amen
[50:19] I'll pause pause right there thank you
[50:21] brother so this is in the the context
[50:24] where Paul and Barnabas they're they're
[50:25] no longer going to the Jews because the
[50:27] Jews have blasphemed Jesus Remember That
[50:29] from the scripture he said we must now
[50:31] go to the Gentiles but notice he's going
[50:34] there to get a people for his name when
[50:38] I got married to my wife she didn't keep
[50:39] her maiden named hesterman I got a wife
[50:42] for my name
[50:43] Smith right that that's a type right she
[50:47] takes on my name I got a wife for my
[50:50] name's sake now we're the Smith family
[50:53] praise God right right Hallelujah so it
[50:56] is with God God takes his bride and
[50:59] she's called by his name brother says
[51:01] you're Mrs Lord Jesus Christ amen
[51:04] hallelujah because the Bible says the
[51:06] whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[51:08] named Lord Jesus Christ how many
[51:10] remember that from the book of Ephesians
[51:12] Ephesians 3 the whole family in Heaven
[51:15] and Earth is called Ms Lord Jesus Christ
[51:19] Hallelujah and where' you get that name
[51:21] when we baptize you in the name of the
[51:22] Lord Jesus Christ that's when you became
[51:25] a associated with that name Hallelujah
[51:28] you were buried in the name of your
[51:29] husband you want to be identified with
[51:31] your husband that's why we didn't we do
[51:33] the baptisms here brother Daniel is that
[51:35] right so on these I call on these sacred
[51:37] grounds I'll say like that amen amen 17
[51:41] of you died you're buried and now you're
[51:43] associated with the name of Jesus Christ
[51:46] amen oh
[51:49] Hallelujah now sister now this verse is
[51:52] really wonderful in this verse God calls
[51:55] the Gentiles his beloved that means his
[51:58] favorite if you look it up in the Greek
[52:01] favorite God has favorites I thought he
[52:04] isn't a respector of persons well he's
[52:06] not but those who obey he has to reward
[52:09] more because he's a rewarder of those
[52:12] who diligently seek Him amen that's
[52:15] right God is not a respector of person
[52:17] he'll judge everybody the same but if
[52:19] you're faithful to God you get more
[52:21] rewards just like you you just like you
[52:24] would trust your children right you
[52:25] trust workers if they're faithful with a
[52:27] little bit of work won't you give them
[52:28] more brother yeah that's how it is with
[52:31] God go ahead
[52:33] sister as he says also o I will call
[52:37] them my people which were not my people
[52:39] and her beloved which were not Bel amen
[52:44] so if you read that whole text he's
[52:45] talking about Jews and Gentiles we're
[52:47] Gentiles because we're non-jewish
[52:49] and it was prophesied in
[52:52] Hosea I'm going to make a people my
[52:54] beloved even though they were not my
[52:57] beloved Hallelujah so Church you are the
[53:00] Beloved of God God Delights in you he
[53:03] loves you nothing can separate you from
[53:05] his love he's your bride Hallelujah and
[53:08] you're and you are his bride you're his
[53:10] wife the Bible says you're the apple of
[53:12] his eye amen
[53:14] amen
[53:16] right that's the truth that's the Bible
[53:19] right the Bride of Jesus Christ is the
[53:21] apple of his eye I'm glad to see some
[53:24] Smiles out there praise God
[53:27] CU your husband Christ loves you that's
[53:30] right he takes great Delight in his
[53:31] people praise
[53:32] God
[53:35] Amen now you become a bride member just
[53:38] by repenting and being baptized in the
[53:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[53:43] obeying the word of God that's in 2
[53:45] Corinthians
[53:46] 11:2 uh Mah can you look that up Mah
[53:50] love that prophet name 2 Corinthians
[53:53] 11:2 2 Corinthians 11
[53:56] 112 Paul Paul says I'm the one that
[53:59] engaged you to Jesus right normally the
[54:02] father engages you to right the father
[54:04] will engage a woman so Paul's like a
[54:07] spiritual father he said you have
[54:09] thousands of teachers but not many
[54:10] fathers
[54:11] right so when when when the when the
[54:13] Corinthians heard the gospel that Paul
[54:15] preached and they believed it and they
[54:17] were baptized Paul said I espouse you to
[54:20] Christ I engage you to Christ amen then
[54:24] brother says in the ible Union it say it
[54:26] say if God put an engagement ring of
[54:29] unmerited Grace on your finger before
[54:31] the foundation of the
[54:33] world because he forew all the people
[54:36] that would be his people praise God amen
[54:39] amen all right brother M uh Second
[54:42] Corinthians 11:2 whenever you're ready

[55:02] I espouse you to Christ so each one of
[55:06] us when you get saved and baptized in
[55:07] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're
[55:09] now engaged to Christ you are the bride
[55:11] of Christ amen right then the question
[55:14] is will you go on and become born again
[55:17] right will you be the wise or the
[55:19] foolish and we know all by God's grace
[55:22] all of us here by God's grace we want to
[55:24] be the wise vers and praise God Amen

[55:36] experience with the baptism of the Holy

[55:45] you are born again everybody I've ever

[55:50] that you so you got to have one
[55:52] experience where it's an emotional it's
[55:53] a powerful experience something
[55:55] Supernatural happens but then God is
[55:57] going to let you be
[55:59] tested anyone remember brother Ram's
[56:01] greatest test brother R's greatest test
[56:04] was when God took his first wife and
[56:07] daughter Sharon
[56:08] Rose brother ramam said that was my
[56:11] greatest trial brother I already had the
[56:13] Holy Ghost for a number of
[56:14] years but he said when God took his wife
[56:17] and daughter Satan came in and said I
[56:19] thought you said God's a god a good God
[56:22] but there he took your child you've seen
[56:24] God he all these people cancer God could
[56:26] heal your daughter but he doesn't heal
[56:27] your
[56:28] daughter and I counted brother R said he
[56:30] agreed with Satan five times he said I
[56:33] was about ready to not serve him now let
[56:36] me just stop right there a holy ghost
[56:38] filled man can be so tested by God he
[56:41] can that God allow him to be tested a
[56:44] man who saw all these wonders and
[56:45] miracles could almost be convinced to
[56:47] quitting
[56:49] preaching brother B said but at that
[56:51] last moment when everything broke away
[56:53] he said all reasoning broke away when
[56:56] all reasonings broke away he said there
[56:58] was an anchor he said the new birth hell
[57:00] down in his soul praise God he said then
[57:03] the scripture came to him the Lord gives
[57:05] and the Lord takes away blessed be the
[57:07] name of the Lord amen
[57:10] hallelujah exactly
[57:12] right so we in our lives we want to look
[57:15] for a real Holy Ghost experience brother
[57:17] said maybe you'll shout maybe you'll
[57:18] dance maybe you'll scream he said maybe
[57:20] you'll speak in tongues he said you'll
[57:21] do something he said but make sure after
[57:24] that happens make sure your life lines
[57:26] up with the word of God
[57:28] hallelujah
[57:30] amen and then you will be
[57:32] tested but every child of God must be
[57:35] tested amen that's right I shared a
[57:37] quote sisters and we've talked about
[57:38] this I shared a quote online people
[57:40] loved it brother R said a lot of times
[57:43] he said I don't even feel
[57:45] saved I'm GNA say that
[57:47] again a holy ghost filled man who's seen
[57:51] signs wonders and miracles discernment
[57:53] after discernment vision of angels after
[57:56] vision of Angel and he said a lot of
[57:57] times I don't even feel
[58:00] saved see because when he would come out
[58:02] of that that spiritual realm of Visions
[58:04] he was still a man and the church said
[58:07] amen that's
[58:09] right look it up a lot of times I don't
[58:12] even feel
[58:13] saved now we always we could live in the
[58:15] happiness and the joy I just feel like
[58:17] dancing every service I be like shouting
[58:19] screaming every service but God let you
[58:21] be
[58:22] tested the Bible said there's a time
[58:24] today and a time to M mourn brother had
[58:28] to mourn over his wife
[58:31] hope right I just want to lay that in
[58:34] there I was sharing that with a brother
[58:35] the the preacher was preaching for us
[58:36] today we had a good Fellowship yesterday
[58:38] on the word of God it's like all these
[58:39] verses kept
[58:41] coming and then Paul said in uh 2
[58:44] Corinthians 7:5 when we were come to
[58:46] Macedonia we had no uh our flesh had no
[58:49] rest but we were troubled on every side
[58:52] without were're fightings and within in
[58:55] fears let's stop for a moment Paul how
[58:58] many believe Paul was a holy ghost
[59:00] filled man hallelujah amen look at
[59:02] that's good good testimony
[59:04] there he said but I got to a spot where
[59:06] I had no rest and I'm sure your moms
[59:08] feel like that sometimes when the kids
[59:09] are sick you don't get any rest right
[59:11] everybody else gets asleep except you
[59:13] you know at least that's how it is in my
[59:15] house my wife is so gracious to
[59:18] me but Paul's at a spot I have no rest
[59:21] and there's trouble on every side think
[59:23] about that a holy ghost f Prophet yet
[59:25] there's trouble in Corinth there's
[59:27] trouble in
[59:28] galatia there's trouble with these
[59:30] Brethren trouble I'm just surrounded by
[59:32] trouble and there's fightings churches
[59:35] fightings amen amen amen some of our
[59:38] message churches fight sometimes don't
[59:40] we but like brother brand said we're
[59:41] still
[59:42] brandom's we're still Christians
[59:45] right sometimes Brothers fight you said
[59:47] go back in the backyard don't he said
[59:50] all the brothers got to fight on our own
[59:51] grounds if anybody comes against the
[59:53] Broms now we're we're going to gather up
[59:55] we're going to gather all the brands
[59:56] we're going to fight against our our
[59:57] strangers
[59:59] right amen that's how it is brother
[1:00:02] right us holy ghost filled Brothers we
[1:00:05] might fight and argue and and things
[1:00:07] it's all in godliness of
[1:00:09] course but when it comes down to saying
[1:00:11] for this message we believe this message
[1:00:14] amen we believe the Bible Revelation
[1:00:16] that God gave to us and the Bible said
[1:00:18] fight the good fight of Faith hallelujah
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:25] and then within were fears so here's a
[1:00:27] holy ghost filled man I want to share
[1:00:28] this with our sisters that because we
[1:00:30] talked about this you can be filled with
[1:00:32] the Holy Ghost but then also in your
[1:00:34] soul but then in your mind have fears
[1:00:36] all
[1:00:37] around trouble trouble fears trouble but
[1:00:40] yet you got the seed of God the so the
[1:00:42] baptism of holy ghost in your
[1:00:44] soul remember Romans 7 Paul said the
[1:00:47] things that I want to do I don't do I do
[1:00:50] the things that I
[1:00:51] hate how many remember that verse amen
[1:00:55] and then he says he said oh Wretched Man
[1:00:59] that I am a holy ghost filled man
[1:01:01] thought he was
[1:01:02] wretched everybody catch that what's he
[1:01:05] talking about he's talking about the sin
[1:01:06] that dwells within him he still sees his
[1:01:10] sinful nature
[1:01:12] right but yet he had the Holy Ghost but
[1:01:16] he had to be tested and tried he still
[1:01:19] had to take up his cross daily and
[1:01:21] follow
[1:01:23] Jesus that
[1:01:25] right and then he would say to the
[1:01:27] Colossians he says the Holy Ghost Christ
[1:01:30] in you the hope of glory he said which
[1:01:32] works in me
[1:01:34] mightily so sometimes brother John he
[1:01:36] could say God's working in me mightily
[1:01:38] other times brother John he said I'm a
[1:01:39] Wretched Man sound familiar to anybody

[1:01:46] experience God's doing great God's
[1:01:48] working mightily in me brother Levi then

[1:02:13] Mercy he's not lacking in Mercy he's
[1:02:16] rich in Mercy amen that's right brother
[1:02:18] Ram said I make thousands of mistakes
[1:02:21] every year he said sure I do he said but
[1:02:23] once I recognize I'm wrong I say Lord
[1:02:26] Jesus forgive
[1:02:28] me thousands of sins he did in the year

[1:02:37] you a license to realize I can have the
[1:02:40] Holy Ghost and I can be a wretched
[1:02:41] person sometimes but God gives me the
[1:02:44] victory praise God and God will bring me

[1:07:09] build your house on a rock of Revelation
[1:07:12] there Hallelujah God knew job's House

[1:07:55] who am I to question his
[1:07:58] majesty see brother BR had to learn I
[1:08:00] can't question things that happened in
[1:08:02] life God allowed it and how many know

[1:08:48] Armageddon and short after Armageddon
[1:08:49] then we have the honeymoon the
[1:08:51] Millennium okay I want I want to make
[1:08:54] sure I I just state that that's we could
[1:08:55] preach a whole sermon on that by God's
[1:08:57] grace and maybe someday I will by God's
[1:08:58] grace we'll
[1:09:00] see
[1:09:02] okay now remember I want to now get into
[1:09:05] some proofs that were the bride if you

[1:09:14] six and 7 Galatians 1 6 and 7 sister
[1:09:16] would that be
[1:09:18] okay and just so you know brother Ram
[1:09:20] had women read Bible verses in church
[1:09:21] it's on tape you can hear it
[1:09:24] she's just not to preach brother said
[1:09:26] she can do everything except preach
[1:09:28] right and be leaders and officers in the
[1:09:30] church uh and we see that in the Bible
[1:09:32] as well Galatians 1 and can you read uh
[1:09:34] verses six and seven sister I Marvel
[1:09:37] that ye are so soon removed from him
[1:09:39] that called you into the grace of Christ
[1:09:41] unto another gospel which is not another
[1:09:44] but there be some that trouble you and
[1:09:46] would pervert the gospel of Christ amen
[1:09:48] can you read one more can you read verse
[1:09:50] eight too sister sure but though we are
[1:09:53] an Ang from Heaven preach any other
[1:09:55] gospel unto you than than that which we
[1:09:58] have preached unto you let him be a
[1:10:00] first amen thank you so Paul says if you
[1:10:03] change one thing that I taught by the
[1:10:05] angel of the Lord You're
[1:10:07] cursed is that right right Paul even
[1:10:10] said we I can't change it whatever I
[1:10:13] wrote cannot be
[1:10:15] changed all right who else got about
[1:10:18] brother uh Daniel can you get uh Romans
[1:10:20] 21:16 brother
[1:10:22] Daniel these are all the verses I use
[1:10:24] with people online that are against the
[1:10:26] message and they're against us I say I
[1:10:28] use these I said we we can't change
[1:10:31] anything Paul said we're going to be
[1:10:33] judged by what Paul said and I give them
[1:10:35] this this list of all the Paul teachings
[1:10:37] the Pauline gospels that brother brand
[1:10:40] restored to us that they disobey but we
[1:10:44] obey everybody understand that amen
[1:10:46] we're the bride because we keep all of
[1:10:48] Paul's gospels and the church said
[1:10:50] that's why we're the bride because Jesus
[1:10:53] revealed revealed these truths to Paul
[1:10:57] and then if we keep them that proves we
[1:10:59] the bride Hallelujah all right brother
[1:11:02] Daniel Romans
[1:11:05] 21:16 and the day when God shall judge
[1:11:08] the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[1:11:10] according to my gospel Hallelujah so you
[1:11:13] and I will all be judged by Paul's
[1:11:15] gospel the New Testament and and the
[1:11:17] church
[1:11:18] saiden and remember when when brother
[1:11:20] went beyond the curtain of time what did
[1:11:22] Brother Ram asked uh uh what are we
[1:11:24] going to be judged by and and he said he
[1:11:26] said you'll be judged by Paul's gospel
[1:11:29] and brother ra brother R said that's
[1:11:30] exactly what I preach when Paul baptized
[1:11:33] in the name of Jesus Christ so did I
[1:11:35] where Paul ordained God as one person so
[1:11:38] did I where Paul prayed or set up the
[1:11:41] nine gifts of the holy spirit so did I
[1:11:43] and brother BR said the million shouted
[1:11:45] we are resting on that
[1:11:48] hallelujah we're resting on the fact
[1:11:50] that brother Randon preached Paul's
[1:11:52] gospel to us brother came around and
[1:11:54] point us back to the Bible what does the
[1:11:56] Bible say what does the bible teach and
[1:11:58] that's what we say we believe the Bible
[1:12:00] we want more of the Bible we want to
[1:12:01] believe all the commands of
[1:12:07] scripture
[1:12:09] Glory so we have that so we have
[1:12:11] Galatians 1 and Romans 2:16 we're judged
[1:12:14] by Paul's gospel and we're cursed if we
[1:12:18] add or take away anything from it amen
[1:12:20] right and now we don't have to read it
[1:12:21] but you know Romans 20 I'm sorry
[1:12:23] Revelations 22 18- 19 says if you add to
[1:12:26] the book plagues will be added if you
[1:12:27] take away your name will be taken out of
[1:12:29] the book of life that's why we stay with
[1:12:31] the word of God how's everybody doing
[1:12:33] everybody doing okay by God's grace okay
[1:12:36] all right Hallelujah I'm doing good I'm

[1:12:43] I'm going to try to try to bring this
[1:12:45] down here a little bit here let me see
[1:12:46] let me set a little
[1:12:52] time
[1:12:57] in Ephesians 5 we see Christ and the
[1:13:01] church let's go to verse 23 for as the
[1:13:04] husband is head of the wife even as
[1:13:07] Christ is head of the church he's the
[1:13:09] savior of the
[1:13:11] body so if you look at this text there's
[1:13:14] five attributes that the woman must have
[1:13:16] the wife must have five attributes in
[1:13:18] the
[1:13:19] natural all
[1:13:21] right this woman has to do five things
[1:13:24] so guess what Jesus's woman Jesus's wife
[1:13:26] has to do five things is that right the
[1:13:30] first is this woman only has one
[1:13:35] headship right who's the head of the
[1:13:37] woman the man who's the head of the
[1:13:40] Bride Jesus Christ amen
[1:13:45] hallelujah now most churches don't have
[1:13:48] the headship of the Bible most churches
[1:13:51] have the headship of a famous pastor
[1:13:54] or a
[1:13:55] denomination or a book of creed or what
[1:13:58] they call them is bylaws you ever heard
[1:13:59] of bylaws right okay you probably he's
[1:14:03] laughing the bylaws is what run is the
[1:14:06] head of the
[1:14:08] church but brother ad says we have no
[1:14:10] Creed but Christ we have no bylaws we
[1:14:14] have no book but the Bible hallelujah
[1:14:18] amen right we have no law here but
[1:14:21] love love the word of God
[1:14:25] Amen see that so right now this this
[1:14:28] just this first there's five of them
[1:14:30] this first attribute eliminates almost
[1:14:33] all the churches from being the
[1:14:35] bride because Christ is not the head of
[1:14:37] the
[1:14:39] church amen
[1:14:42] right all
[1:14:44] right now here are
[1:14:47] 10 I might have read this before but
[1:14:50] it's worth reading again here's 10
[1:14:51] teachings Paul gave us
[1:14:54] that most churches
[1:14:56] break okay most churches break and then
[1:14:59] they're guilty of not letting Christ be
[1:15:01] the head of them but if you keep them
[1:15:05] that proves you're the
[1:15:07] bride the first one is homosexual
[1:15:09] relationships Paul condemned homosexual
[1:15:12] relationships a lot of churches are
[1:15:13] going for that today the second is
[1:15:16] adulterous relationships men divorcing
[1:15:18] and remarrying divorce and remarriage
[1:15:20] that's sin the bride won't do that
[1:15:24] the third one is fornication we were at
[1:15:25] a wedding one time and this pastor was
[1:15:27] thankful that the couple was living
[1:15:29] together before they were married living
[1:15:31] in fornication I know it's awful it was
[1:15:32] a Lutheran Church I I can't remember
[1:15:36] which one it was some
[1:15:37] denomination think about that rejoicing
[1:15:40] over
[1:15:41] fornication that ain't the bride and I
[1:15:44] tell you she didn't look like a modest
[1:15:45] bride
[1:15:46] either number four birth control pills
[1:15:49] are like murder
[1:15:51] pills right so a lot of churches allow
[1:15:53] birth control pills that's murder
[1:15:56] because they will they will abort a
[1:15:58] fertilized
[1:16:01] pregnancy Fifth and and Paul says we
[1:16:04] can't have the spirit of
[1:16:05] murder right fifth women preachers Paul
[1:16:08] said I don't allow woman to
[1:16:10] preach six uh the Bible says if you
[1:16:13] destroy your body God will destroy you
[1:16:15] so cigarettes
[1:16:17] drunkenness substance abuse that's a
[1:16:20] sin I sat with a Lutheran man one time
[1:16:24] and he and his whole wall was lined with
[1:16:25] beer bottles look at all the beers I've
[1:16:27] dranken and he said it's okay to get
[1:16:29] drunk as long as you're with the Luthers
[1:16:31] and long as you don't do anything bad so
[1:16:33] people can't tell me uh you know
[1:16:35] churches don't think they can get drunk
[1:16:37] they absolutely can think that they
[1:16:38] think that and he's like you need to
[1:16:40] become a he right when I got in the
[1:16:42] message he said you need to become a
[1:16:43] Lutheran Pastor I said no if I preach it
[1:16:45] all I'm going to preaching the message
[1:16:47] and so I did Hallelujah number eight is
[1:16:51] viewing sinful M movies in television
[1:16:53] shows because Paul said avoid all
[1:16:55] appearance of evil but these people will
[1:16:58] allow pornography they'll allow sex
[1:17:01] scenes and movies they'll allow all this
[1:17:03] trash but Paul said don't let it even
[1:17:05] come in front of your
[1:17:06] eyes number nine shameful hair lengths
[1:17:09] right they let the women cut their hair
[1:17:11] they let their men grow long hair now
[1:17:12] think about this all of these Church all
[1:17:15] of these disqualify them from being the
[1:17:17] bride but it qualifies you to being the
[1:17:20] bride amen Oh I thought I thought I'd
[1:17:22] get a Lotter amen than that praise God
[1:17:25] Amen the bride has the headship of
[1:17:28] Christ
[1:17:30] amen her headship is the
[1:17:35] word ninth is is uh they they uh they
[1:17:38] take false
[1:17:40] conversions they say as soon as you
[1:17:42] believe you're filled with the Holy
[1:17:43] Ghost that's
[1:17:44] nonsense Paul said have you received the
[1:17:47] Holy Ghost since you've been a
[1:17:49] Believer and number 10 in modest
[1:17:51] clothing Paul said dress in modest
[1:17:53] clothing so right there there's 10
[1:17:55] simple doctrines that all these churches
[1:17:57] break disqualifies them from being the
[1:18:00] bride because their bylaws are their
[1:18:02] head instead of the Bible their headship
[1:18:05] amen the second attribute is in verse 24
[1:18:08] uh fans 5:24 the church is subject to
[1:18:11] Christ in everything let's all say
[1:18:14] everything can we everything so all
[1:18:15] those 10 everything glory and we've seen
[1:18:19] it my wife and I we' we've uh you we've
[1:18:22] had that church since 2006 we're coming
[1:18:24] up on almost 18 years in June 18 years
[1:18:27] and our church I believe is obedient in
[1:18:29] everything are we perfect no but all
[1:18:32] these commands we are trying our church
[1:18:34] is trying by God's grace to be obedient
[1:18:36] to everything Christ
[1:18:39] says so for example if someone needs a
[1:18:41] car I went and got a couple cars for
[1:18:43] people now of course used ones I can't
[1:18:46] afford a new car you
[1:18:47] know but like but like if somebody needs
[1:18:50] something we're the book of Acts if
[1:18:52] somebody don't have something I mean
[1:18:54] we've let two people move in with us for
[1:18:55] a little bit of time well three three
[1:18:59] that's been hard to say no that's been
[1:19:01] hard
[1:19:02] sisters um but that's what the Bible
[1:19:04] says if you don't have a home give him a
[1:19:06] home amen that's right right how many
[1:19:09] times have I people in Mar Church uh
[1:19:11] we're out of money what do I do got to
[1:19:13] give money that's what the church does
[1:19:15] if you say you love somebody but don't
[1:19:16] help them the Bible said your faith is
[1:19:18] not your faith is not
[1:19:20] alive
[1:19:21] Hallelujah
[1:19:24] see we are the book of Acts church we
[1:19:27] must be just like the book of
[1:19:30] Acts obeying every word the third
[1:19:33] attribute is washing Ephesians 5:26 that
[1:19:36] he might sanctify and cleanse it with a
[1:19:37] washing of water through the word of God
[1:19:40] and these kind of go
[1:19:42] together so when you learn to obey the
[1:19:44] Bible when you come service after
[1:19:46] service week after week month after
[1:19:47] month year after year when you let God's
[1:19:50] word change your life you're being
[1:19:51] Washed by the word
[1:19:53] you're being Washed by the
[1:19:56] word hallelujah the Bible says that in 1
[1:19:59] Peter 1:22 you're purified in obeying
[1:20:02] the truth through the spirit amen
[1:20:06] hallelujah I can't help but get excited
[1:20:08] so amen I know you're used to it but I
[1:20:10] just want to make sure I say it Hall I
[1:20:12] just got to clap some say that's right
[1:20:14] amen I love the word of
[1:20:16] God you get washed as you obey the truth
[1:20:20] of God's
[1:20:21] word Hallelujah that's part of the
[1:20:24] washing process amen Jesus washes his
[1:20:27] bride he's patient with her to obey the
[1:20:29] commands of
[1:20:30] God how many times have you noticed what
[1:20:33] was brother R's main sin he battled has
[1:20:35] anyone remembered it's the critical
[1:20:39] spirit the critical spirit and the
[1:20:42] critical spirit is you can find nothing
[1:20:44] good to say about somebody I just put
[1:20:46] the video out yesterday brother R says
[1:20:48] pray for me I'm haunted by a critical
[1:20:51] spirit now this makes total sense God
[1:20:53] had revealed all these things to him he
[1:20:56] talked to angels and so when he see
[1:20:57] people off the word of God he just
[1:20:59] criticized them but he said I can't do
[1:21:01] that I've got to let God judge
[1:21:05] them he said oh God let me not criticize
[1:21:08] them he said Lord help me love
[1:21:12] them Lord let me love them he bowed it
[1:21:15] all the way up till 1963 listen to this
[1:21:17] message standing in the Gap brother Ram
[1:21:20] said I was so fed up with it I preached
[1:21:22] all these years and the about women and
[1:21:24] they keep getting shorter hair more
[1:21:26] makeup he said he said I'm ready to take
[1:21:28] my wife and move up into Colorado and I
[1:21:30] only come down and stomp down when I got
[1:21:32] thus say the Lord and then I'll stomp
[1:21:33] back up and the angel said if you do
[1:21:36] that your wife will divorce or leave you
[1:21:38] not divorce the your wife will leave
[1:21:40] you think about that he got so caught up
[1:21:44] in his complex these people won't hear
[1:21:46] me they won't hear me he said I lost the
[1:21:49] feeling for the people like Moses lost
[1:21:51] the feeling for his people remember he
[1:21:53] lost the feeling he said you bunch of
[1:21:54] rebels you want water from this rock
[1:21:56] here's your water smack bunch of rebels
[1:22:00] brother Bram said that happened to him
[1:22:02] in the New Testament with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:06] amen hallelujah amen and he said forgive
[1:22:10] me for calling you ricketta and Ricky he
[1:22:13] would name call these modern people you
[1:22:16] he said you bunch of Ricky and retas he
[1:22:18] said the Lord told me I shouldn't name
[1:22:19] call like that just like Moses Moses
[1:22:22] said you bunch of rebels right amen
[1:22:26] right Church listen to that and brother
[1:22:30] talked to the angel he's driving and the
[1:22:31] angel and he said I thought I was a
[1:22:33] prophet and the angel says you're not an
[1:22:35] Old Testament Prophet you're an
[1:22:37] Apostolic Prophet Old Testament prophets
[1:22:40] could walk away in the wildness like
[1:22:41] Elijah sit out by the Brook of cheriff
[1:22:43] and then come back in with thus say the
[1:22:44] Lord and walk out but the New Testament
[1:22:47] Prophet they stay with the church amen
[1:22:50] amen look at Paul Paul didn't stay away
[1:22:53] from the churches what' he do he went in
[1:22:55] a circuit and strengthened the churches
[1:22:57] he stayed with the churches praise God
[1:23:00] and God tells brother brandham that so
[1:23:02] all all these people they misunderstand
[1:23:05] uh you know brother brandham as a
[1:23:07] prophet he was a new testament Prophet
[1:23:09] not an Old Testament Prophet The Angel
[1:23:11] tells him that in standing in the Gap
[1:23:15] 1963 Hallelujah he said I can't go out
[1:23:18] until God changes my feeling for the
[1:23:20] people well guess what God Chang his
[1:23:22] feeling for the people
[1:23:25] amen God gave him a soft heart even if
[1:23:27] more people paint their
[1:23:30] faces and more men compromised on the
[1:23:32] word of God whatever the sin was he said
[1:23:34] I'm still I'm going out for that bride
[1:23:36] I'm like El eer going to get that
[1:23:37] Rebecca hallelujah praise God I've got
[1:23:40] to go out and get a bride ready for
[1:23:42] Isaac I got to get a bride for Jesus
[1:23:44] Christ hallelujah
[1:23:50] amen oh I love this message I love love
[1:23:53] God's Prophet because he point us back
[1:23:54] to the word of God we can learn so much
[1:23:57] from Brother bram's
[1:23:59] preaching his life the fourth attribute
[1:24:02] is joined that's in Ephesians 5:31 for
[1:24:05] this cause a man shall leave his father
[1:24:07] mother and be joined join means glued so
[1:24:10] a
[1:24:11] woman I'm sorry a man has to leave his
[1:24:14] children and be joined to his wife glued
[1:24:17] to his
[1:24:18] wife okay and that's what we do as the
[1:24:21] church we're glued glued to Christ and
[1:24:24] also that means we're glued to Christ's
[1:24:26] people that's why we gather more in
[1:24:28] church as we see that day approaching
[1:24:30] amen I think I told you this before May
[1:24:32] when I preach laying foundations brother
[1:24:34] Bram said if you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:24:36] can't wait for Daniel's door to open on
[1:24:38] Sunday morning to go to his house and
[1:24:40] have church amen
[1:24:43] hallelujah or brother irin and sister
[1:24:46] wil's house when they're hosed Church
[1:24:49] you can't wait he said if Jesus Christ
[1:24:51] is in your heart you can't wait to see
[1:24:53] the Saints and fellowship with them
[1:24:55] because that's your brother and sister
[1:24:57] hallelujah
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:01] hallelujah I know that's the truth
[1:25:03] before I before you know when when I was
[1:25:05] raised in Pentecostal church I would sit
[1:25:07] down like this while the preachers
[1:25:08] preaching imagine me brother I'm sitting
[1:25:10] down like this I don't want to hear
[1:25:11] anything the preacher says and now God
[1:25:12] Saves me now I'm up shouting and
[1:25:14] screaming and spitting and trying to get
[1:25:16] everybody to believe the word of God
[1:25:18] hallelujah I love going to church I'm
[1:25:20] always the first one to church and I'm
[1:25:21] the last one to leave
[1:25:23] that's normally how it goes by God's
[1:25:24] grace and I used to hate going to church
[1:25:26] my mom would have to take bats brother
[1:25:27] Levi she would pull off the the our
[1:25:30] blankets on Sunday morning and hit us
[1:25:31] with bats to try to get us up to go to
[1:25:33] church and then she would get a spray
[1:25:35] bottle of water and
[1:25:37] vinegar while I was sleeping she pulled
[1:25:39] back and spray me right in the face get
[1:25:41] up Jesse it's time to go to church I
[1:25:42] didn't want to go to church and now I'm
[1:25:44] the first one at church praise
[1:25:46] God hallelujah thank you Jesus that's
[1:25:49] right
[1:25:50] Hallelujah I'm the one
[1:25:52] let's get ready to go and that's all all
[1:25:55] these things by God's
[1:25:56] grace see because we want to be glued to
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:02] Christ brother Ram says I'd rather have
[1:26:04] you love my children than love me and
[1:26:07] brother R said that's how God feels in
[1:26:10] other words when you love God's children
[1:26:12] it shows you love God Amen the only way
[1:26:15] I can prove to irin or anyone that I
[1:26:17] love God is to love him and love
[1:26:20] Wilma the Bible says if you can't love
[1:26:22] the people you can see you cannot love
[1:26:24] the person you can't
[1:26:27] see so part of being the bride is loving
[1:26:30] God's people around you amen that's why
[1:26:33] we gather more we got to be glued to the
[1:26:35] bride right as a bride we got to be
[1:26:37] glued together and glued to Christ amen
[1:26:40] and let me S say this because there's a
[1:26:41] lot of people in the message don't know
[1:26:42] how to do this but if somebody offends
[1:26:44] you go to them oneon-one like Matthew
[1:26:46] 18:15
[1:26:47] says right now it can't be a man and a
[1:26:49] woman that aren't married so if the
[1:26:51] man's offended he's got got to take his
[1:26:52] wife and go to the woman or go to the
[1:26:54] man right you don't want to you don't
[1:26:55] want to have men men and women that
[1:26:56] aren't married together like that but
[1:26:59] let's do that so many people are afraid
[1:27:00] to talk about offenses but Jesus said if
[1:27:03] you just do that you'll feel so much
[1:27:05] better right but so many people today
[1:27:09] don't like people on YouTube they just
[1:27:11] want to go on YouTube and blast somebody
[1:27:12] blast me or blast brother random and
[1:27:15] they don't even talk to me first about
[1:27:17] it that's not the Christian way the
[1:27:20] Christian way is if I differ with my
[1:27:21] brother my sister I'm going to go to
[1:27:23] them oneon-one or with a small group and
[1:27:25] let's talk this out brother Ram said in
[1:27:27] that sermon uh Church order he said even
[1:27:30] if the janitor disagrees with me he said
[1:27:32] let's go and talk about it let's solve
[1:27:34] this out together by the
[1:27:36] scripture amen so who's the janitor here
[1:27:39] Sister Miriam
[1:27:40] right so brother R was the leader of the
[1:27:43] church so he said even the low we said
[1:27:44] the lowest no you're not the lowest is
[1:27:46] stupid but what I'm saying I hey I
[1:27:49] scrubed the church I I scrub the toyset
[1:27:51] at our church I scrubbed them yesterday
[1:27:52] yesterday I I don't taking any shame in
[1:27:54] that I'm supposed to be a servant and I
[1:27:56] do that to remind myself that I am a
[1:27:59] servant I just put a little baking soda
[1:28:02] in there right I scrub it up with the
[1:28:03] brush it's all
[1:28:05] clean I I need to be a servant I need to
[1:28:09] remember I'm no better than anybody
[1:28:11] Amen in fact the minister should be the
[1:28:14] most servant amongst all of the people
[1:28:16] that's right they should be the biggest
[1:28:17] servants or the the not biggest but the
[1:28:20] people who want to serve the most that's
[1:28:21] right but brother R says I'll take the
[1:28:23] lowest they say the most humble person
[1:28:25] in the church and if I'm wrong he said
[1:28:27] you're Duty bound to correct me by the
[1:28:32] scripture all
[1:28:34] right amen and I got all the quotes you
[1:28:36] want any of these quotes just text me or
[1:28:38] email me I will gladly give you all
[1:28:40] these quotes most of them I got online
[1:28:41] too by God's grace now the fifth and
[1:28:43] final attribute is reverence the Bible
[1:28:46] said in Ephesians
[1:28:48] 5:33 nevertheless let every one of you
[1:28:50] in particular so love his wife even as
[1:28:52] himself and the wife see that she
[1:28:55] reverence her husband now you've
[1:28:57] probably been to some Churches recently
[1:28:58] that were not message churches right did
[1:29:01] you see the same level of reverence in
[1:29:03] those churches no we uh I've been
[1:29:06] invited to preach at a Baptist Church
[1:29:07] numerous times good people they're nice
[1:29:10] people but there's no reverence in in
[1:29:12] this really in the sanctuary they'll
[1:29:14] talk and laugh and walk across before
[1:29:16] service there's really no praying and
[1:29:18] waiting on God there's just not that
[1:29:20] reverence and you've probably heard of
[1:29:23] some people they take coffee and donuts
[1:29:25] into
[1:29:26] church right they're giving themselves
[1:29:29] uh diabetes while they're hearing the
[1:29:30] word of God I'm talking about the donuts
[1:29:33] now coffee is good just don't put any
[1:29:34] sugar in
[1:29:35] it but they they give themselves
[1:29:38] diabetes yeah it's so irreverent this is
[1:29:42] a but the Bible said God's house is a
[1:29:44] house of judgment it's a
[1:29:46] courthouse who's ever seen a person on
[1:29:49] trial eating Donuts at their trial
[1:29:53] right is that is that right right it's
[1:29:56] so
[1:29:58] ridiculous right and and this proves
[1:30:01] they don't have the reverence that they
[1:30:02] need that God is worthy
[1:30:05] of the Bible says examine yourselves
[1:30:08] whether you be in the fa the faith the
[1:30:10] Bible says how you going examine
[1:30:11] yourself when you're sitting back eating
[1:30:13] a
[1:30:14] donut popping jokes while the word of
[1:30:17] God let me chug down all this coffee and
[1:30:19] all these Donuts that's good good joke
[1:30:21] preacher is that that reverence for our
[1:30:22] husband Christ that's not reverence
[1:30:25] that's
[1:30:29] irreverence
[1:30:31] Hallelujah so we have a great reverence
[1:30:33] in the message everybody that was around
[1:30:35] brother bram's Ministry you know this if
[1:30:37] you read the church the supernatural
[1:30:38] book everyone that was around brother
[1:30:40] R's Ministry said there was a different
[1:30:41] level of reverence in his ministry amen
[1:30:44] everybody knew that that's right exactly
[1:30:47] right and that's the same thing my wife
[1:30:49] and I found when we come to this message
[1:30:50] we even walked in these guys homes these
[1:30:52] were single guys in their 20s and I'm
[1:30:54] like this is this this is different this
[1:30:56] is a holy atmosphere in
[1:30:58] here they got Jesus on the wall they're
[1:31:00] 20 they're big Burly guys you know like
[1:31:02] Dave
[1:31:03] lellan big muscle guys they got all this
[1:31:06] humble picture of Jesus I had this long
[1:31:08] hair like I my mullet you know short in
[1:31:11] front long in the back you know I'm
[1:31:13] walking in there like what what is going
[1:31:15] on it just it was a different
[1:31:18] atmosphere I come to the church I see
[1:31:20] people praying before service
[1:31:22] Hallelujah I see people praying after
[1:31:24] service
[1:31:25] Hallelujah people seeking God hungry for
[1:31:28] more of
[1:31:30] God the bride reverences her husband
[1:31:33] amen that's right right my wife doesn't
[1:31:37] bad talk me I don't bad talk her we
[1:31:40] reverence one another right right
[1:31:43] there's reverence there there's respect
[1:31:45] there's Godly appreciation for one
[1:31:48] another and that's what this bride has
[1:31:51] this bride has has reverence for
[1:31:54] Christ
[1:31:56] okay
[1:32:01] now I'm going to close with
[1:32:03] this we can judge every Church by this
[1:32:07] standard right here amen that's right
[1:32:11] proving that proves we are the Bride of
[1:32:13] Jesus Christ because brother Brandon
[1:32:15] pointed us back to the Bible in
[1:32:17] everything that we
[1:32:20] do
[1:32:22] there
[1:32:23] are here's the groups in Christianity
[1:32:25] there's 1.3 billion Catholics are they
[1:32:28] the bride they're actually the false
[1:32:31] bride they're the mother
[1:32:34] Harlot a cage of unclean the hateful
[1:32:36] Birds how do you know because of her
[1:32:37] false doctrines that's how you know the
[1:32:41] fruits of her Ministry after that the
[1:32:44] next biggest group is Protestants now we
[1:32:46] fall under that by God's
[1:32:48] grace then you have Eastern Orthodox
[1:32:50] anglicans Oriental Orthodox and all
[1:32:54] others now all these groups cannot be
[1:32:57] the bride there can only be one bride in
[1:32:59] all these
[1:33:02] groups now I listed 15 doctrines I've
[1:33:05] already listed 15 remember when I went
[1:33:06] through homosexuality fornication birth
[1:33:08] control pills all these
[1:33:11] things none of these churches keep all
[1:33:14] 10 of those or all 15 of those so they
[1:33:17] cannot be the
[1:33:19] bride here's another one they don't do
[1:33:21] the B baptism is the right
[1:33:23] way they don't preach on three works of
[1:33:26] Grace they say God's three persons
[1:33:28] that's a lie they
[1:33:30] crossdress men wearing women garments
[1:33:32] women wearing men's
[1:33:34] garments and they many of them deny the
[1:33:37] supernatural gifts of the Holy Ghost so
[1:33:40] right there is 15 now at my H our I'm
[1:33:43] sorry our church I preach and I showed
[1:33:45] 110 false
[1:33:47] doctrines think about that I I went
[1:33:49] through real fast I could have preached
[1:33:51] a whole sermon on it but I listed 110
[1:33:54] different doctrines between us and
[1:33:56] everybody
[1:33:58] else think about that brother there is
[1:34:01] in other words listen Church there's a
[1:34:03] great difference between you and all the
[1:34:05] other churches Hallelujah that's why God
[1:34:08] loves you hallelujah amen there's a huge
[1:34:11] difference brother in invisible Union
[1:34:13] brother Ram says there's hundreds of
[1:34:14] these differences and then he names
[1:34:17] bobbing hair the right baptism he said
[1:34:19] that's just a few of them he said
[1:34:21] there's hundreds of
[1:34:23] them he said brother random the me the
[1:34:25] pre the message you're preaching is
[1:34:26] wrong he says go search the scriptures
[1:34:29] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:34:31] life but they are they which testify of
[1:34:34] me amen he said if you do that he said
[1:34:37] you'll find out the message is Right
[1:34:39] amen amen hallelujah I love it praise
[1:34:42] God
[1:34:43] Amen brother Irvin why' you marry sister
[1:34:45] Wilma because there was so many
[1:34:47] differences between her and all the
[1:34:48] other
[1:34:49] women Amen to that right brother brother
[1:34:52] he said am why did I marry my wife
[1:34:54] Kristen cuz I knew I couldn't live
[1:34:55] without her I couldn't have anybody else
[1:34:58] marry her she had to be mine that's what
[1:35:00] brother R said don't marry him unless
[1:35:02] you can't live without him amen there a
[1:35:05] lot of nice women but there something
[1:35:07] different about her Hallelujah for me
[1:35:09] and I can list hundreds of reasons why
[1:35:11] we found all some of our old love
[1:35:13] letters recently find some of our old
[1:35:14] love
[1:35:15] letters it's kind of funny to see all
[1:35:17] the changes you know but I list all
[1:35:19] these reasons I think on her 40th
[1:35:21] birthday we did 40 reasons why we love
[1:35:23] mommy you know went through all these
[1:35:26] reasons that's a small
[1:35:29] number because brother Ram says there's
[1:35:31] hundreds of differences between the
[1:35:33] Bride of Jesus Christ and all the other
[1:35:35] churches claiming to be the bride in
[1:35:38] other words Jesus isn't going to get
[1:35:39] confused are the Junction City Saints
[1:35:42] bride or
[1:35:43] not I I can't really tell the difference
[1:35:46] between them and and the Methodist
[1:35:48] Church down or the Amish Church down the
[1:35:49] road is there am Church down the road by
[1:35:51] your your house brother I wonder uh
[1:35:54] which one is the bride no Jesus knows
[1:35:57] because he spent time with you he's
[1:35:59] washed you in the waters of the word
[1:36:02] hallelujah he's dressed you Hallelujah
[1:36:05] he spent time with you Hallelujah he's
[1:36:08] seen your reverence amen he's seen that
[1:36:10] he's the head of your church hallelujah
[1:36:12] amen he's done all of that so that's why
[1:36:15] he can call you his beloved that's why
[1:36:18] he can call you bride because You' let
[1:36:20] him go through these five steps of
[1:36:23] washing you you obey him you submit to
[1:36:25] him you reverence him you love him and
[1:36:28] he loves you praise God let's stand to
[1:36:30] our feet let's have a word of
[1:36:33] prayer I could have went through all
[1:36:35] these I listed all the differences
[1:36:36] between uh Catholics Baptists lutherans
[1:36:39] 7 Day Adventist Jehovah's Witnesses
[1:36:41] Mormons ethern Eastern Orthodoxy
[1:36:43] Oriental Orthodox I went through all
[1:36:46] this to show how there's only one
[1:36:50] bride and she keeps all the word of God
[1:36:54] and brother Ram said in the church age
[1:36:55] book she will
[1:36:57] try to line up her life according to the
[1:37:00] blueprint of the book of
[1:37:03] Acts and that's what we're trying to do
[1:37:05] here we're going to Lord willing try to
[1:37:06] establish a church here in the near
[1:37:08] future as far as voting in leaders and
[1:37:10] so forth like that that's what the Bible
[1:37:11] did that's what they did in the
[1:37:13] Bible sometimes in the Bible the Holy
[1:37:15] Ghost would just say Paul and Barnabas
[1:37:17] you go this you go on the missionary
[1:37:19] trip but Paul told Titus you or you
[1:37:22] ordain Elders in every city you know we
[1:37:25] need in Junction City we need an elder
[1:37:26] praise God we need a leader we need a
[1:37:29] pastor right just like we need an
[1:37:32] acronym ordain Elders in every
[1:37:36] city in other words ordain a bishop or
[1:37:39] an overseer or a pastor it's the same
[1:37:41] word Elder Bishop overseer they're all
[1:37:43] the
[1:37:44] same now you can have brothers that are
[1:37:46] Elders that are more advanced in the
[1:37:47] faith that's true but if you're talking
[1:37:49] about the leader of the church that's
[1:37:50] the the elders the same as the bishop
[1:37:51] The Bishop's the same as the
[1:37:53] pastor but Church be encouraged Jesus
[1:37:56] knows you Jesus knows you're the bride
[1:37:59] Jesus knows you're his beloved just keep
[1:38:02] reverencing him just keep him as your
[1:38:05] headship praise
[1:38:06] God was this sermon a help to anybody by
[1:38:09] God's grace all right well that's nice
[1:38:11] to see that boy Comforts my heart praise
[1:38:13] God I know I preach long I know it's
[1:38:14] hard to stay awake when I'm free
[1:38:15] sometimes but I know we go through all
[1:38:17] the cares of life but I'm very glad I
[1:38:19] wrote a whole chapter on this if you
[1:38:20] want to chapter on this is in chapter
[1:38:22] four of the 2021 book this is one of the
[1:38:25] Mysteries brother Ram finished the
[1:38:28] mystery of the church as the Bride of
[1:38:31] Jesus Christ who's filled by the Holy
[1:38:33] Ghost amen now let's bow our heads let's
[1:38:35] have a word of
[1:38:37] prayer and as we
[1:38:39] pray think in Your Heart Lord do I need
[1:38:42] to be more reverent to
[1:38:45] you Hallelujah remember we went through
[1:38:47] these examples all these
[1:38:50] attributes
[1:38:52] Lord do I need to be more joined to the
[1:38:54] body of Christ do I separate myself from
[1:38:56] the church a little too much could I be
[1:38:58] more attached to the people spend more
[1:39:00] time with the
[1:39:01] Saints or how about Lord uh I need to be
[1:39:05] washed you know I've recently sinned I
[1:39:07] need you to wash me in the waters of the
[1:39:11] word or how about I need to submit my
[1:39:14] life there's some things in my life I
[1:39:16] need to submit because the bride is
[1:39:18] submissive in all things
[1:39:22] or how about that first one Lord you
[1:39:24] need to be the head of my life I've been

[1:56:15] you end the service you know if brother
[1:56:17] Irvin says a word however you could do
[1:56:19] that you can be led to do that I just
[1:56:21] want to say this uh while I was
[1:56:23] preaching I forgot uh God's actually you
[1:56:25] know started two churches through our
[1:56:28] church we started our church before we
[1:56:30] started our church we had a day of
[1:56:31] prayer and fasting and then we voted for
[1:56:34] leaders and then when brother cam
[1:56:36] started the church I you know uh I was
[1:56:39] there and I I made I helped start that
[1:56:41] church we had just a day of prayer and
[1:56:43] fasting we would just pray fast pray
[1:56:46] fast throughout the day and then at the
[1:56:48] end we voted for the leaders
[1:56:50] and God's helped that church Move On by
[1:56:52] God's grace and where do we get that
[1:56:53] that's Acts chapter 13 the Bible said
[1:56:56] the prophets and the teachers would
[1:56:58] gather they'd pray and fast and the Holy
[1:56:59] Ghost would say send me separate me Paul
[1:57:02] and Barnabas for this
