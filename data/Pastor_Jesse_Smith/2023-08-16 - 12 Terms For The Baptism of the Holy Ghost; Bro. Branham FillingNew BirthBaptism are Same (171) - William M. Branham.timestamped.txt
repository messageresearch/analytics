[0:03] when God has given you the true baptism
[0:06] of the Holy Spirit it's a new birth
[0:09] you're born to new of the Holy Ghost
[0:13] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:19] this video is to show 12 phrases the
[0:22] King James version Bible uses to
[0:25] describe the one self-same event and
[0:28] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[0:31] Ghost
[0:32] friends remember that the baptism of the
[0:34] Holy Ghost is called a mystery in
[0:36] Colossians chapter 1. Saint Paul said it
[0:38] was the mystery hid from ages Christ in
[0:40] you the hope of glory
[0:42] and brother Branham gives us the
[0:44] revelation of this mystery in the church
[0:47] age book he said he gives it with thus
[0:49] saith the Lord
[0:51] now before we leave this subject I want
[0:53] to make myself very clear on what the
[0:54] baptism with the Holy Ghost is according
[0:57] to the word
[0:58] it is not according to me and it is not
[1:00] according to you it has to be according
[1:03] to thus saith the Lord or we are falsely
[1:06] LED amen
[1:09] and one of the scriptures that he uses
[1:11] out of the many was Acts chapter 19
[1:13] verses 1 through 6 the Believers in
[1:16] Ephesus led by Apollos were already
[1:19] Believers but Saint Paul came to them
[1:21] and said have you received the Holy
[1:23] Ghost since you believed and of course
[1:25] they said no Paul laid his hands on them
[1:27] and then they received the baptism of
[1:29] the Holy Ghost
[1:31] so this shows that the baptism of the
[1:32] Holy Ghost is the third work of Grace
[1:34] the first step is being saved which is
[1:37] called justification the second stage is
[1:39] called sanctification that is getting a
[1:42] new mind or new spirit cleaning out your
[1:45] habits
[1:46] and then a person gets the third work of
[1:48] Grace which is the baptism of the Holy
[1:50] Ghost
[1:51] the Seal of the spirit of God in the
[1:53] believer's soul
[1:55] so I felt this video would be helpful
[1:57] because there is some confusion in some
[2:00] message churches but especially in
[2:02] denominations about what the new birth
[2:05] is some people teach the new birth is
[2:08] different from the filling or the
[2:10] filling is different from the baptism of
[2:12] the Holy Ghost but the truth is as God's
[2:15] Prophet brother random taught us through
[2:17] the Bible that the new birth is the same
[2:19] thing as the filling of the Holy Ghost
[2:21] which is the same thing as the baptism
[2:23] of the Holy Ghost is the holy ghost
[2:26] coming to live and abide in the
[2:28] believer's soul
[2:32] as many of my viewers know brother
[2:34] Branham grew in his Revelation on this
[2:36] subject
[2:37] as late as 1962 brother Brown taught the
[2:40] filling and the baptism were two
[2:42] different events let's listen to the
[2:45] quote
[2:46] I never thought there's a person believe
[2:47] that like me until this morning you
[2:49] heard Charles Fuller as it was going
[2:51] down he believes too that the new birth
[2:53] is not the baptism the Holy Ghost the
[2:55] new birth is being born the Holy Ghost
[2:57] is a baptism and
[3:00] but then by 1963 brother Branham taught
[3:04] they were one in the same such as this
[3:05] quote from the token message and then
[3:07] we'll listen to two quotes from the
[3:09] church age book where brother random
[3:11] says being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[3:13] or born of the spirit is one of the same
[3:15] and then he says the baptism of the Holy
[3:17] Ghost is the new birth it is the filling
[3:20] let's listen to the quotes
[3:22] every promise in the Bible is yours it
[3:25] belongs to you okay this token is up on
[3:29] you and God has sealed you now we want
[3:31] to check ourselves just for a moment
[3:34] when God has given you the true baptism
[3:37] of the Holy Spirit then the life of
[3:40] Jesus Christ is within you now that's
[3:43] true every Theologian I have to admit
[3:44] that to be this it's a new birth you're
[3:47] born to new of the Holy Ghost and
[3:49] because that God has did this and you
[3:52] know you're no good in yourself and you
[3:53] accept what God has did then he seals
[3:56] you into his kingdom by the Holy Spirit
[4:00] I mean for The Sinner to come forward
[4:02] and be born again which is to be
[4:04] baptized into the body of Christ by the
[4:06] Holy Ghost which is exactly what took
[4:08] place at Pentecost when the church was
[4:10] launched
[4:11] in other words to be born of the spirit
[4:13] is to be truly baptized with the Holy
[4:16] Ghost
[4:16] it is one and the same
[4:19] what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost
[4:21] it is the spirit baptizing you into the
[4:23] body of Christ it is the new birth it is
[4:27] the spirit of God coming in and filling
[4:28] you after you have repented having heard
[4:31] his word and been baptized in water as
[4:34] an answer of a good conscience toward
[4:35] God
[4:37] so now that we see the quotes of brother
[4:39] Branham prove the New Birth the baptism
[4:42] and the filling of the Holy Ghost are
[4:44] the one and self-same event I want to
[4:46] reference a section from my 2021 book on
[4:49] the 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed
[4:51] it's on pages 343 until 3 46. it's in
[4:58] the sixth chapter on the mystery of
[5:00] Christ in you the baptism of the Holy
[5:02] Ghost and in this section it's called
[5:04] unifying and differentiating terminology
[5:07] I showed there are at least 12 phrases
[5:10] or synonyms for the baptism of the Holy
[5:13] Ghost now in this section I show a chart
[5:15] proving there are three works of Grace
[5:17] in the New Testament justification
[5:19] sanctification and the baptism of the
[5:21] Holy Ghost
[5:23] but I'll focus on these 12 bullets on
[5:27] page 345 here are 12 different phrases
[5:31] or words all describing the self-same
[5:34] event and experience of the baptism of
[5:36] the Holy Ghost
[5:37] the first terminology is converted from
[5:40] Luke 22 32 Jesus said when you're
[5:42] converted strengthen your brethren he
[5:44] was speaking to Peter
[5:46] the second phrase is endued with power
[5:50] from on high Luke 24 49 again the words
[5:53] of Jesus
[5:54] the third is born again or New Birth
[5:57] from John 3 verse 7 again quoting Jesus
[6:02] the fourth is receiving eternal life
[6:04] spoken by Jesus in John 10 28 and spoken
[6:08] by Saint John in first John 5 11-13
[6:12] the fifth is love or charity
[6:15] spoken by Paul and Saint Peter in Romans
[6:18] 5 verse 5 First Corinthians 13 1-13 and
[6:22] second Peter 1 verse 7.
[6:25] the six is the Holy Spirit dwelling in
[6:27] you according to Paul in Romans 8 verse
[6:29] 11.
[6:30] the seventh is the spirit of adoption as
[6:33] spoken by Paul Romans 8 verse 15.
[6:36] the eighth is God the Father dwelling
[6:38] and walking in use spoken Again by Paul
[6:41] in second Corinthians 6 verses 16 and
[6:43] 18.
[6:45] the ninth is called the seal or
[6:47] spiritual Mark spoken by Saint Paul in
[6:49] Ephesians 1 verse 13 and Ephesians 4
[6:52] verse 30. the tenth is called Christ in
[6:56] you
[6:57] mentioned earlier in Colossians chapter
[6:59] 1 verse 27 spoken by Saint Paul
[7:02] the 11th is washing of regeneration and
[7:04] renewing of the Holy Ghost spoken by
[7:07] Paul in Titus 3 verse 5.
[7:10] and the 12th and final phrase is called
[7:12] washed robes made white in the blood of
[7:14] the Lamb written by Saint John of course
[7:16] in Revelation 7 verse 14.
[7:20] so without a doubt friends both brother
[7:22] Branham and the Bible proved the baptism
[7:24] of the Holy Ghost have at least 12
[7:27] different phrases or terms that describe
[7:30] this one event this one experience
[7:34] understanding these truths will take
[7:36] away the confusion about the baptism of
[7:39] the Holy Ghost and remember Jesus Christ
[7:40] is the one who coined the phrase baptism
[7:43] of the Holy Ghost it's found in Acts
[7:45] chapter 1 verse 5 and of course other
[7:48] places in the gospels acts 1 5 says for
[7:51] John's really baptized with water but ye
[7:53] shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[7:55] not many days hence
[7:58] in closing
[7:59] hope this short video was a blessing I
[8:01] just had this topic on my heart and
[8:04] thought I would make a short video about
[8:05] it to help the Saints by the grace of
[8:07] God over the years I've got numerous
[8:09] emails and comments asking about the
[8:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I felt the
[8:14] Holy Spirit bring this section of my
[8:17] book to my remembrance and I thought I
[8:19] would show how there's at least 12
[8:20] perhaps more phrases or terms that all
[8:24] describe that one glorious blessed event
[8:26] of a soul being baptized with the Holy
[8:29] Ghost born from above
[8:32] if you have any questions concerns or
[8:34] testimonies about this video please
[8:36] contact me
[8:38] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[8:40] the desire of your heart
