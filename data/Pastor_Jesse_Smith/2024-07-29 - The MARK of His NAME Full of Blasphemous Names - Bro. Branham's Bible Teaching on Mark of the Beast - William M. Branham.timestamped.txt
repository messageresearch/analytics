[0:02] and I saw a woman setting up on a
[0:04] scarlet color Beast rich full of names
[0:08] of blasphemy false baptism false eony
[0:13] lead the people blindly tell them to
[0:15] just come to church make your confession
[0:17] and so forth do a ha Mary do a Penance
[0:20] ignorance nonsense I don't see how
[0:22] people good civil Minds could be such
[0:25] things greetings friends in the
[0:27] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:30] the purpose of this video is do another
[0:31] part on the mark of the name of the
[0:34] Beast this is the third video in a
[0:36] series on the mark of the beast by the
[0:38] grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith
[0:40] pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here
[0:42] in akan Ohio USA and I defend the
[0:44] original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:46] as he revealed to St Paul and then
[0:48] restored through Martin Luther John
[0:50] Wesley and the late prophet of God
[0:52] William maryan brandham who Liv from
[0:54] 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother
[0:57] Ram's Godly Christian character so as a
[0:59] brief review in the first video we
[1:01] looked at how the mark of the beast was
[1:03] originated in the life of Cain he had a
[1:05] spiritual Mark first and then God gave
[1:07] him a physical Mark but after that all
[1:09] the people after that have only had a
[1:11] spiritual mark of the beast which is a
[1:13] reprobate mind it's a rejected mind that
[1:16] God no longer accepts because the person
[1:19] has made their decision for the final
[1:20] time to not accept the will of God and
[1:22] repent in the second video we looked at
[1:24] how the mark of the beast can be in the
[1:26] hand or the forehead and of course at
[1:29] some point during during the Great
[1:30] Tribulation that Mark may may become a
[1:32] physical mark but first it'll be a
[1:34] spiritual Mark and God's Prophet brother
[1:36] Ram told us about that the mark in the
[1:38] hand represents doing the will or just
[1:40] going along with the will of the One
[1:43] World Church State religion and the mark
[1:46] in the forehead is accepting the false
[1:48] doctrines of the One World Church system
[1:52] like trinitarianism universalism Etc so
[1:55] in this video we're going to look at the
[1:56] name of the Beast this is from
[1:58] revelation 13:17
[2:00] and that no man might buy or sell save
[2:02] he that had the Mark or the name of the
[2:04] Beast or the number of his name in this
[2:07] video we'll look at the name of the
[2:08] Beast Lord willing in the next video
[2:10] we'll look at the number of his name the
[2:13] content of this video is coming from my
[2:14] 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries
[2:16] revealed this is on pages 591 and 592
[2:20] we're starting at the portion called The
[2:22] Mark of his name but before we get into
[2:25] that remember friends Believers must be
[2:27] marked or sealed with the baptism of the
[2:29] Holy ghost there's numerous scriptures
[2:31] about this Ephesians 1:13 Ephesians 4:30
[2:34] I just thought I'd read the Greek
[2:36] definition of the word seal in the Greek
[2:39] it means to set a seal upon marked with
[2:41] the seal for security from Satan in
[2:45] order to Mark a person or thing hence to
[2:47] set a mark upon by the impress of a seal
[2:51] or a stamp it's in order to prove
[2:53] confirm test a thing hence to confirm
[2:56] authenticate Place Beyond doubt so we
[2:59] see all the spiritual benefits of being
[3:00] sealed with the baptism of the Holy
[3:02] Ghost Satan is sealed out as brother Ram
[3:03] told us Christ is sealed in Christ in
[3:06] you the hope of glory according to
[3:08] Colossians 1
[3:09] 25-27 and we are marked stamped sealed
[3:14] secure unto the day of our Redemption by
[3:16] the grace of God but unbelievers will
[3:18] likely take the mark of his name or the
[3:20] name of the Beast remember the Beast is
[3:22] the Antichrist Spirit The Same Spirit
[3:25] that's been over the Gentiles since the
[3:26] days of Daniel in Daniel chapter 2 when
[3:28] Daniel saw the vision of the times of
[3:30] the Gentiles the evil spirits that
[3:32] directed The Kingdom of Babylon and then
[3:34] the meats of Persians and then the
[3:36] grecians and then Rome and of course
[3:38] Rome was first Imperial Pagan Rome but
[3:42] then around 400 to 500 AD the Roman
[3:45] Empire fell the Beast had a wound but it
[3:48] lived according to Revelation 13 and it
[3:51] revived in the Roman Catholic church so
[3:54] the Beast changed from Imperial Pagan
[3:56] Rome to paple Rome so the spirit of Rome
[3:59] is still ruling today through the
[4:00] Catholic church I can't explain it all I
[4:03] don't understand it all but we know a
[4:04] lot of the elected leaders in America
[4:06] are Roman Catholic and America's behind
[4:08] many of the wars over the last 50 or 70
[4:10] years they're currently behind the
[4:12] Russia Ukraine war if America's funding
[4:15] that then of course the Catholic church
[4:17] is funding that because so many of the
[4:18] elected leaders of the United States are
[4:20] Roman Catholic so let's look at this
[4:22] section called The Mark of his name this
[4:24] is the second means of buying and
[4:25] selling that people will give into in
[4:28] order to buy and sell during the in the
[4:29] Great Tribulation period but of course
[4:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ will be gone
[4:32] by the grace of God she's spared from
[4:34] the wrath of God Revelation 3:10 says
[4:37] Jesus will keep us from that hour of
[4:39] Temptation that will come upon the whole
[4:41] world we're kept from that hour by the
[4:43] grace of God so unbelievers will take
[4:45] the name of the Beast Revelation 14:11
[4:48] teaches Sinners will receive the mark of
[4:50] his name the name of the Beast has two
[4:52] applications because there is one name
[4:54] for the person of the Antichrist which
[4:56] is the Beast figurehead the pope of Rome
[4:59] probably a future Pope but it could be
[5:01] the current pope we don't know the day
[5:02] or the hour of the Rapture while the
[5:05] second name is the Beast or Spirit of
[5:07] Rome has names full of blasphemy or full
[5:11] of names of blasphemy according to
[5:14] Revelation 17:3 so you have the name of
[5:16] the Pope and then you have the name of
[5:19] false churches in the Beast system so
[5:22] let's look at the Antichrist name the
[5:24] Bible said it's the name of one man as
[5:26] taught by Revelation 13:17 and 18 which
[5:28] says the number of his name it is a
[5:31] number of a man so notice it's not the
[5:33] name of a woman it's a name of a
[5:36] man what's the name of the man who will
[5:38] be the Antichrist it's the Vicor of
[5:40] Christ that's according to the
[5:42] Encyclopedia Britannica the pope is
[5:44] called the Vicor of Christ this is the
[5:46] Blasphemous title given to the pope of
[5:48] Rome who is said to have quote full
[5:50] Supreme and Universal power over the
[5:52] whole church a power which he can always
[5:54] exercise unhindered end quote and that's
[5:57] from the catechism of the Catholic
[5:58] church I have the book that I purchased
[6:00] myself vicer means substitute
[6:03] originating from the Latin word
[6:05] vicarius consider the other official
[6:07] titles the pope is given and this is
[6:09] also from the catechism of the Catholic
[6:11] Church book he's called Bishop of Rome
[6:14] Vicor of Jesus Christ successor of the
[6:16] prince of the Apostles Supreme pontiff
[6:18] of The Universal Church patriarch of the
[6:21] West primate of Italy Metropolitan
[6:24] Archbishop of the province of Rome
[6:26] Sovereign of the state of Vatican City
[6:29] servant of the Servants of God end quote
[6:32] submitting to the name of the Antichrist
[6:34] the Roman vicer of Jesus Christ is equal
[6:37] to receiving the mark of the beast so in
[6:39] other words submitting to the rule of
[6:40] the pope is the way to take the mark of
[6:43] his name just because you respect the
[6:44] Pope's titles you respect the Pope's
[6:47] office people will take the mark of the
[6:49] beast that way remember that's different
[6:51] from taking the mark in the hand or the
[6:52] forehead according to the Bible cuz it's
[6:54] either or you can take any of these now
[6:57] moving on the Beast or Roman spirit is
[6:59] full of names of blasphemy according to
[7:01] Revelation
[7:03] 17:3 what are the Beast many names of
[7:05] blasphemy they are the different names
[7:07] of so-called Christian churches all
[7:09] claiming to be true churches for there
[7:11] are thousands of religious denominations
[7:14] existing within the United States and
[7:16] undoubtedly thousands more worldwide
[7:19] think on this for a moment thousands of
[7:21] different names like Catholic Lutheran
[7:24] Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian just
[7:27] to name a few all claiming to be the
[7:29] genuine churches of Jesus Christ without
[7:31] the power and the character of true
[7:34] Christianity here's a list of sins that
[7:36] Peter and Paul condemn they're from 2
[7:39] Timothy 3 1-5 and 1 Peter 4 1-4 and most
[7:43] people that attend church are guilty of
[7:45] some if not all of these sins most
[7:48] church members cuss or use the name of
[7:50] God or Jesus that's blasphemy they enjoy
[7:54] social drinking which is drunkenness
[7:56] they watch sinful TV shows and movies
[7:58] that's lust
[8:00] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh they
[8:02] commit sexual sins like fornication sex
[8:04] before marriage or adultery and justify
[8:07] themselves above others that's the
[8:09] spirit of Pride but Peter and Paul both
[8:11] say Christians should be free from these
[8:13] sins and that these are sins that are
[8:15] committed before a person's conversion
[8:17] to Christ in time past of our life
[8:20] according to 1 Peter
[8:22] 4:3 and then the book I give an
[8:24] illustration of someone a pretend person
[8:27] maybe in the Church of Christ and I'm
[8:29] not Las in the Church of Christ there's
[8:31] good people in there but we're against
[8:33] the system the evil system Behind These
[8:35] churches and these denominations but I
[8:37] just use an example of a Church of
[8:38] Christ person let's say on a Friday
[8:40] night he goes out to the bar with his
[8:42] friends let's say he's drunk that's a
[8:44] sin and then he gets a phone number of a
[8:47] woman who's not his wife that could lead
[8:49] to adultery but it's no doubt lust and
[8:51] he's representing the Church of Christ
[8:54] claims to be a Church of Christ member
[8:56] so he does that Friday night and then
[8:57] let's say he spends the whole weekend
[8:59] doing sinful things like watching evil
[9:01] Netflix shows sinful Netflix shows maybe
[9:04] plays violent video games that can be
[9:06] murder it's a murderous Spirit then
[9:08] maybe he takes his family to go watch a
[9:10] filthy movie with blasphemy on it one of
[9:13] those Batman movies from years ago they
[9:15] counted had over 20 times in one movie
[9:17] that they Blas him the name of Jesus
[9:19] Christ and Christians so-called will pay
[9:21] money to support such nonsense and Tommy
[9:24] Rod is that and then let's say the
[9:26] family then would skip church on Sunday
[9:28] in order to have some type of a party a
[9:30] birthday party or Super Bowl party so
[9:33] that man and his family have spent the
[9:35] entire weekend committing all these sins
[9:37] and yet they call themselves a Church of
[9:39] Christ or a Lutheran or a Methodist or a
[9:41] Baptist or Church of God member they
[9:43] just spent the entire weekend
[9:44] blaspheming the name of Jesus Christ no
[9:47] wonder the Bible says they have names
[9:49] full of blasphemy this is what Jesus
[9:51] warned about in Revelation 3:1 Jesus
[9:53] said I Know Thy works that thou Hast a
[9:55] name that thou livest but are dead see
[9:58] friends many un converted sin loving
[10:00] church members have church names they
[10:02] live or confess they confess to be a
[10:04] Church of God member or Church of Christ
[10:06] member but they're spiritually dead just
[10:09] like Jesus said in Revelation
[10:10] 3:1 the Beast is full of these
[10:13] Blasphemous names these Church joiners
[10:15] who know nothing of Christ's power to
[10:17] make them new creatures according to 2
[10:19] Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be
[10:21] in Christ he's a new creature the old
[10:23] things are passed away behold All Things
[10:26] become new so clinging to one of these
[10:28] thousands of bless Blasphemous names by
[10:30] Church joining and rejecting the new
[10:32] creature or the born- again experience
[10:34] is essentially receiving the mark of the
[10:35] beast and of course this can be done
[10:37] before the tribulation but this will
[10:39] also be available to the unbelievers as
[10:41] an option during the Great Tribulation
[10:44] they can take the mark of his name that
[10:46] includes the name of the Pope or one of
[10:48] the names of blasphemy that the Beast is
[10:50] full of full of names of
[10:53] blasphemy in
[10:55] closing friends hope this video was a
[10:57] blessing by the grace of God we're
[10:58] almost through this little series here I
[11:00] hope it's been enlightening hope the
[11:02] scriptures have been a help to you the
[11:04] world is just getting more demonic all
[11:06] the time I'm sure you saw the pictures

[11:16] continually blashe the name of Jesus
[11:18] Christ remember friends a tree is known
[11:20] by its fruit that's the be system we
[11:23] shouldn't just boycott the Olympics this
[11:24] year we should boycott the Olympics
[11:26] every year or every four years see the
[11:28] Beast will blashe the name of Jesus
[11:30] Christ and try to give their own name
[11:32] just like at the Tower of Babel they
[11:35] built the Tower for their name to give
[11:36] themselves a name but we must use the
[11:38] name of Jesus Christ the Bible said
[11:40] whatsoever you do in word or deed do it
[11:42] all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:44] cast out devils in the name of Jesus

[11:56] the Lord Jesus Christ rebuke spirits in
[11:59] the name of Jesus Christ the Bible said
[12:01] resist Satan and he will flee from you
[12:03] he will flee he'll run from the name of
[12:06] Jesus Christ if you have any questions
