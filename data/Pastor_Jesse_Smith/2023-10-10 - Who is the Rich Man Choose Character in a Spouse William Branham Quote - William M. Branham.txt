TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I've married many couples but it always reminds me of Christ and his bride one of the weddings that I performed here some time ago it it was quite an outstanding thing in my life it's been several years ago when I was just a young Minister my brother was working on the uh pwa I don't where anybody over here remembers that yet or not anybody as old as me um and that was um uh project that the government had and my brother worked up about 30 miles they were digging U out some Lakes a project for the conservation and there's a boy who worked up there with him from Indianapolis about oh about a 100 miles above Jeffersonville where I I live or live and there was um e said to my brother one day he said doc he said I I I'm going to get married if I just had enough money to pay the preacher he said I got enough money to get my license but said I haven't got enough money to pay the preacher doc said well my brother's a preacher and and he he may marry you he said he never charges people for things like that he said well you asked him if he'll marry me well that night my brother asked me I said if he's never been married before either one of them and there everything's all right he said well he asked him and I said if it is tell him come on down so when Saturday come along and the boy came down it's been a great thing for me to always look back upon this i' had U rainy afternoon in an old chevret car with the headlights wired on with a bailing wire I drove up out front just a while after I'd lost my wife and I was batching two little rooms and and Doc was up there with me waiting for them and and a boy got out of the car and it certainly didn't look like a groom to me or wood to anybody I guess yeah I could bear buy a pretty good pair of shoes for a dollar and a half and he had on a pair was run over and his trousers that was real baggy and it had on a one of these old mle skinn jackets I don't guess some of you older people would remember it looked like it run through a washing machine without being wrenched and it was streaking tied up like this the corner up and uh a little lady got out on the side with a little oh some I'm little checky look dress I don't know I made a mistake on calling that kind of goods one time Gangham I believe it's called and um so um it was um I said it wrong again I and I said uh she got out of the car and they come up the steps and and when they walked in the poor little thing she I guess she just about all she had on was a skirt and she didn't have no shoes hardly on she hit hike from Indianapolis down had a little hair hanging down back and along kind of a plat down her back looked very young and I said to her are you old enough to get married she said yes sir and she said I have my written permission from my father and mother she said said I had to show it the to the courty year to get my license I said all right I said uh I like to talk to you a little bit before we performed this wedding they sat down the boy kept looking around the room need the hair cut real bad he kept looking around the room he wasn't listening to me I said son I want you to listen to what I'm saying said yes sir and I said do you love this girl he said yes sir I do I said you love him yes sir I do I said now have you got a place to take her after you marry said yes sir and I said all right now I said I want to ask you something I understand you're working up here on this pwa and he said yes sir that's about $12 a week and I said you think you can make a living for he said I'll do all I can do and I said well that's all right and I said now what if he gets out of what if he loses this job sister what do you go to do go to run back up home to Mama and Papa she said no sir I'm going to stay with him and I said what sir if you have three or four children nothing to feed them you haven't got any work why you going do send her away said no sir I'll struggle right on we'll make it some way I felt little and I seen that he really loved her and they loveed one another I married him and then I wondered where he Tak her a few days I asked my brother doc where he is said go down to new AUB a little city blow us and down on the River where I had some tin laying up where I went every day when I was I was a lineman so when the rest of the fellas they all sat around told jokes and things I'd get in the truck and run down on the River and Pray doing that men uh and read my Bible under a big piece of 10 where an old Armon Works used to be there's a bunch of old box cars sitting down there and this fell had went down there and got one of them box cars and sought him a door in it and had taken a newspaper and tacky buttons how many knows what a tacky button is there's no kyans here then it's take a piece of cardboard put a thumb tack in a little spring and then push it in the that's a tacky button so they had put it all over and he went up there to the Ironworks and got him uh some stuff and made a step to come up and got some old boxes and had him a table and I thought one day I'll go down and see how they're getting along about 6 months before that I married e Knight's daughter the E slider son even night one of the richest man there is on the high river and um you all runs the great factories through there making these prefab houses and so forth and and slider is ET slider is a sand and gravel company millionaires children and um had married him and I went back in a place practiced it for about two weeks and going back in a booth and leading on a pillow and all the pump and everything I ever went through nearly had to go through to marry that couple and when come out while they were this other little couple just stood there in a little old room where we had a a little couch and a folded bed but they both was married by the same ceremony and then one day I thought I'd go down and visit this Rich couple they didn't have to work their fathers are millionaires they build them a nice home frankly this eeve night up there on the hill is door knobs are 14 karat on his big Palace so uh you can imagine what kind of home they live in they didn't have to work they had a nice Cadillac give to them every year and just only children and they had just everything they wanted when I walked up one day and now how I got acquainted with them one of their friends was a good friend of mine we all kind of chum together and that's how I got acquainted when they wanted me to marry him so um I went up to visit him and I got outside old Ford outside walked up the steps and and I got up a little bit too close and I heard them and they were really fussing they were jealous of one another they'd been to a dance she was a very pretty girl and she was kind of one of these uh beauty queens she Tu many prizes around there and won some cars and things for being beauty queen and I looked at him and one was sitting in one corner and one the other fussing about some boy she had danced with her some girl something when I come up they jumped up real quick and grabbed one another across the floor and their hands across the floor come walk nor towards your door said but hello there brother Brandon how are you getting along I said all right how you all getting long and oh he said I we're very happy aren't we honey and she said yes de now I see you're putting on something that isn't real now you can't get warmed by a painted fire like some of these churches trying to paint Pentecost or something happened a thousand years ago or 2,000 years ago you can't get warmed by a painted fire a Pentecost is just as real today as it was then the fire is still falling it ain't a painted fire it's a real fire so uh they just there they was see I I wouldn't want to live like that well I thought you know just down over the cliff there and over on the river and there's where this other couple wound up I thought one Saturday afternoon I'd slip down there and see how they is getting along so I'm dirty on the face and dirty overhauls on my tools on I thought I slip up on them and I slipped along like I was watching for insulators being cracked by the lightning or something as I walked along side of the telephone wire the electric cables along the river and there the old chevret was setting out front about a year later after I'd married him and there was uh uh the door was open and I could hear him talking so this sound sounds like a hypocrite but I walked up close enough that I could listen see what they saying St there and I just want to know for myself I like to find out be sure I know what I'm talking about that's what I do about God's word word is it the truth or isn't it the truth will he keep his word or doesn't he keep his word if he doesn't keep his word then he's not God see he does keep his word he's God and so I wanted to see how they was getting long and I slipped along the side real easy I heard him say Well honey I wanted to get that for you so bad she said now look sweetheart she said this dress is all right she said Well I this is just fine said I appreciate that but you see I slipped around so I could look at through the crack where the door been shoved open there in the Box Car and there he was sitting in there and her on his lap and his arm around her and her arm around him and he had one of these old slouch hats and and put a little hole mashed it down the top and poured out his paycheck and that he he was laying it out on the table said so much for groceries so much for ins insurance and so much uh on the car and they couldn't make their ends meet come to find out he'd seen a little dress up there in the window he' been looking at it for a couple weeks that cost a dollar and something he wanted to get he said well honey it looks so pretty in it and he said she said but honey I I got a dress I I don't really need it see and that little queen and I backed off and looked back I could see the the steeple on top of the other house I stood there and looked a few minutes I thought who is the rich man I thought if Bill brandom if you want to take which place where would you go for me I take not the that pretty thing up on top the hill but I take this character down here as a real homaker somebody that loved me and stayed with me somebody tried to make a home and not bleeding for everything for fine reasons somebody that was with you part of you that's always stuck with me of how that was one chose a beautiful girl the other chose character now that's the only way you can choose first look for character and then if you love her fine
