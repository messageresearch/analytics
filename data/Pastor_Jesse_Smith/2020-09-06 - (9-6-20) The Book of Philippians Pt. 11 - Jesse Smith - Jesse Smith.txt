reporter was reporting how they they thought there's gonna be a lot of travel this weekend because all the lockdowns i think that's true for us don't you a lot of people traveling yeah just kind of tired of being inside you know being at the same place so we're thankful for god's amazing grace amen i remember nights on wednesday nights at the waterloo place where i think it would just be malachi and myself and lydia a couple services and we just have a couple people on the phone hookup you know at one time there was one service where i was preaching just to the phone it was empty it was an empty congregation because i think they were using the restroom so never discouraged us because we know the angels are encamped around those that fear the lord you know there's angels here and they're hearing our needs they're ministering to our needs and so we're thankful for the holy spirit praise god let's go to uh philippians chapter three we'd like to continue on this uh book of philippians part 11 and we'll continue looking at this thought so philippians 3 i want to pick up where we left off you know we kind of left off on verse nine so i like to read nine and ten philippians three nine and ten praise the lord what a great uh testimony paul gives us and what an attitude that we can all mimic right we can all imitate this and ask the holy spirit to uh let this mind that was in paul be in us because we know it was the mind of christ so let's read nine and ten together then we got memory verse uh philippians 3 9-10 on 3 1 2 3 and being found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death let's go to matthew 6 30. matthew 6 30 down to 34. let's begin on three one two three wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof let's have one more word of prayer if we can that's it if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto god here god sees all of our needs here heavenly father god we love you we love singing to you lord you are good and gracious king you've been so good to supply all of our needs lord you've given us your word that we can rule over our enemies we can conquer our enemies lord we can possess the spiritual land oh god thank you for your mercy great king we bring honor to you today in your house we worship and glorify you lord take this word today break it to your people bless it to our hearts god and just encourage us strengthen us let us rejoice in your word lord we pray today be with all the saints traveling anoint those listening over the livestream now or on the archive and lord we just want to feel your presence today so we invite your spirit of fresh here lord just come and dwell amongst us and be magnified in our midst in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you being seated praise god have some slides already i can switch over whenever you're ready so lord willing we'll try to labor on this thought by god's grace we'll keep going and continue on we might even finish on wednesday we'll see how how we go today by the grace of the lord all right great now there's one thing uh just wanna update you on uh we had uh well a couple things you know i'm almost done with that last chapter 13. um right now i'm writing about how people have falsely claimed to be elijah so john alexander dowie in 1901 claimed to be elijah and then he died in 1906. now look at look at that right before brother brown was born in 1909 and so that's scriptural people will catch people will catch the the prophecy that's supposed to be fulfilled brother man said they live under that there's prophecy going on but if they don't wait on the lord then they'll get all mixed up so he was a genuine preacher which had a lot of genuine uh healings history said he had he won a hundred lawsuits over um corrupt clergymen and also doctors that said all of his healings weren't real but they took him to court and he won but he kind of got mixed up and he was like building an empire over there in illinois you probably it's actually called the city of zion in illinois he's the one who founded that um and so it was a it was a just quite a thing there to see that he caught that anointing right before the real one came and that's scripture uh right like uh jesus you know remember gamalia told uh peter and all them he he said remember theodis rose up right before this group rose up and then he said judas of galilee rose up and they they boasted that they were someone right and he said they they pulled men after themselves making themselves great but they came to naught they perished and uh and that's what gamea was saying he said let these christians alone if it's not of god it'll come to naught like it'll it'll come out to nothing he said but if it's of god you're fighting against god and so see their church and remember then jesus repeats it remember matthew 24 24 he said false christ many false christs and prophets will arise saying lo he's in the wilderness right so we see the same thing is going to increase today there's going to be people that recognize my the rapture soon and they're going to exalt themselves as as being some messiah or some some great one but but jesus said you'll know them by their fruits you know them by their lifestyle watch how they live if their life doesn't imitate christ or imitate paul it's the wrong fruit it's corrupt fruit praise god and so i just want to remind you of that that that's what we're seeing now today people rising up and saying they're especially around the message they say they're the eighth messenger or they say uh they're the they're the they're the prophet they're the prophet that was to come a lot of people rise up and say that a lot of people are you know following brother man's son and believe he's the last prophet to the age he doesn't make himself out to be that as far as i know but people make that out but see it's just they're living under this uh this prophecy and we've got to make sure church we stay right between the middle of the road praise god god is going to help us do that by god's grace so i'm working on that and then lord willing this week i'll have my next video out tape boys are not in jesus's five full ministry so it's about 40 minutes long right now i was working on this morning i'm almost done hopefully this week it'll come out so looking forward to that uh by god's grace brother cam's reading the book so far he says he's really enjoying it so uh i appreciate brother km doing that for us he really helped me the most on the last book and so i'm trusting that god will use him to help me out on this one as well by god's grace okay so let's look here uh to this uh this text what a beautiful text philippians three uh beautiful book the whole thing has been uh but let's pick up where we left off on wednesday we preached now through galatians ephesians and now we're almost through philippians praise god so we looked at uh let's review here briefly by god's grace uh we preached wednesday where paul says we're to rejoice and then immediately after he tells him to rejoice he said beware of dogs and her brother branham say it yesterday he said how a dog will return to its vomit and then brother brahm said how come these preachers don't know the very false doctrines that made him sick don't they know if they go back it's going to make him sick again he said that on once more lord from 63 and and that's what that's what a lot of that's a lot of the clue that people are preachers are dogs when they they they say they leave revelation i'm sorry they leave the worldly habits behind but then they go back to it we've got to make sure i thank god we have honest saints here if amen or hula or my wife or anybody ever bang if they ever see us go back to things we left in the world they have they're about duty bound to come tell me about it right because we have to we're responsible for our own church we're not responsible for any other church we're responsible for our church and paul said beware the dogs the dogs that they may look good for a while but they'll they'll take you back to sin and remember dogs like wolves remember we have had dreams of wolves beware of wolves beware of those who want to defile your spiritual life who want to uh destroy you hurt your influence right that's okay if they destroy your influence to other people god will raise up other people you can influence amen i'm a witness of it praise god god might shut off a channel there but he'll open up another channel praise god yeah if he closes one door he'll open another praise god in a real church we have this confidence you can't deceive god's elect praise god if somebody's telling a lie on you or someone's trying to bite you or something like that that hurt you don't be discouraged the elect cannot be deceived praise god god won't let these true people be deceived because he knows they want truth and he's obligated to show them truth so see we and then he says in verse uh uh he says we must worship in the spirit i believe it's verse uh sorry where am i yeah verse three he says we're the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus so the happiest times are not when we build a new church or not when we uh we get special donations our happiest times is when the presence of jesus christ is felt amongst us amen think about our happiest services when are they when people are at the altar people getting healed people coming for the holy ghost right god's word made alive when you recognize god's presence that's what real believers rejoice in the most praise god i remember i told you that you know steve algenate i went to that apostolic church there over in talmadge a few years ago and i watched during worship service those boys and girls they were in their teens they took turns running around the church and they're all clapping the children you remember when we went there lydia does i don't know if anybody in case she does but the biggest shout wasn't during that time the biggest shot was when they said we raised 50 000 for the new church and it went that was the loudest shout in the church and i thought i instantly just caught that i said that's not right and now the scripture becomes a reality to me our our our most rejoicing our happiest times is when we feel god's presence amen praise god not for natural things right that's to me that's confidence in the flesh right we don't we don't want to have any confidence in the flesh or things are our flesh can do we want to have confidence in the holy spirit praise god amen and so we thank god for his mercy i'm sorry i forgot to tap that and he and then he tells us do not trust in the flesh have no confidence in what you can do right and then he gives examples like your who are you who's your family members who your local church is right because he talks about the jews and he was circumcised the eighth day and things that he could trust in in his flesh now i got a list of them here we'll go over in just a moment paul lost everything church he lost his fleshly benefits right his his denominational benefits his reputation he lost all of it for christ he went from everybody's favorite to the one they were hunting down remember and then he said at the beginning remember in chapter one in this book he said a lot of people didn't receive me and they got angry when they heard i went in jail and they preached against me but he said that's okay as long as jesus is being preached amen see he didn't worry when people talk bad about him he didn't worry he he realized that jesus christ is fighting for me if i'm standing with him jesus will stand with me please god amen that's the confidence we have paul's only desire was to be found in christ amen in christ's righteousness praise god a partaker of his holiness amen and he knew he couldn't be done by trusting in his past uh where he was raised his as past his original denomination he knew he couldn't trust in that the flesh he had to trust in the holy spirit praise god now here are some examples i was thinking of some examples here's some flesh legalistic ideas people trust in today around the message i'm sure there's more so let's go through these real briefly by god's grace i just thought i'd give you some examples people believe just because they're born in the message or because they have a last name that they are somehow saved now that doesn't save you now church doesn't give you does it give you a close or i'm sorry a close proximity to blessings yes right it gives you a close proximity to hear the word of god that's a blessing praise god remember you know it's a great testimony as we said this a few weeks ago when we had our brother here preaching it's a great testimony to never leave the word and never go out in the world but that's a great testimony but i want to balance that jesus said those that love me the most are those who are forgiven the most praise god so see you can be raised in the message but as long as you know you have much to be forgiven and you love god then you'll be happy praise god amen but if you leave the message and you go on the world but then you come back and repent in tears and thank god for pulling you out of the mirey clay you can love jesus just as much amen because it's based upon your under your gratitude for how much god's forgiven you praise god amen i want to make sure i say that i agree jesus had the greatest testimony that he never left of course no one's ever going to get close to his testimony right but for us we can still have a great testimony no matter whether we leave the message or come back or we stay the whole time it's all based upon our recognition of the power of the cross amen as long as we're trusting in the power of the cross and realize the effects that the cross has had upon our once sinful lives to make us uh uh got holy lovers rather than sin lovers praise god as long as we have that understanding that we can love god in a great way and god will certainly love us glory now i know a church in the message i think they believe all brothers have to wear beards uh and they have to avoid pork they kind of go together because they they keep a lot of the jewish feasts yet they preach brother branham and uh i wrote one about it one time i said well brother branham ain't squirrel and they said yeah we disagree with that we don't think brother ramsay should have ate squirrel like it matters you know but now i don't know if they're in legalism but whenever people go too far it's likely some people in the church feel like they're holier because they don't eat meat right so i i don't know exactly if the leadership uh is making it legalism like if you eat meat and if you brothers don't grow your beards you're backslidden now that's wrong that's wrong because there's nothing in scripture that would tell us that now go to colossians 2 we'll get there lord willing in a couple weeks here but this the next book over colossians 2 and uh if you go down to verse 16 this is beautiful i can't wait to preach this in a little bit but uh paul just finished in verse 14 just saying jesus blotted out all the ordinances the jewish ordinances against us nailed them to his cross so in other words the curse the requirement of the requirement if you don't keep 666 laws you're guilty of all of them you could keep you could keep 615 but if you break one you're guilty of all of them jesus took that curse and he nailed it to the cross amen and then he says this he said verse 16 let no man therefore judge you in meat but yet people that look down upon us if we eat pork now is it probably the healthiest meat probably not right because of what pigs eat my wife and i have talked a little bit about that i can't remember our exact conversations but uh that we know they're not the most cleanest animals uh but they if if any man judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of a holy day or of the new moon or of the sabbath days which are shadow of things to come but the body is christ so all those things are not the body of christ right sabbath days keeping sabbath days and not eating meats and that's not christ right all those things were shadows all those things point to christ amen amen they point to christ how christ cleansed everything that was uncommon praise god everything that was unclean christ cleansed it amen hallelujah and keeping a day doesn't make you holy but keeping christ makes you holy keeping christ letting christ come into your soul and him staying in your soul that keeps you holy praise god how do they not keep it a certain day so see i just want to bring that then he says verse 18 let no man begow you of your reward see of these liberties and we you know like i said we won't go into that now but he just gets done saying jesus did away with all these shadows and you don't have to keep them anymore but yet people around the message they want to do that and that's fine our job is to love all our job is to correct all love all we're supposed to love our friends and our enemies right and if someone makes us an enemy that's okay they're still my friend right that's our desire now here's one that came a couple years ago i don't remember this but amen i wasn't here but brother brian hawkins was preaching over in that sanctuary and two brothers from canada came to our church and uh said we can only play songs in the church that brother branham said and they went around the whole country with amen they got kicked out they got arrested and different not in tennessee they got arrested because they were causing so much chaos and they were trying to use quotes to make it say that that church that's nothing but plain legalism right there's nothing but plain legalism uh and that that is that is so limiting the holy spirit that's like saying the holy spirit you can't write any new songs but yet the bible says sing a new song praise god and pretty soon if you listen to all broadband songs you're going to learn all the songs i mean there will be no more new songs after a while but the holy spirit says sing a new song praise god and the holy spirit is constantly inspiring worship but yet in the cam especially cam especially these men really hurt cam's family as far as with their words uh they attacked him on a wednesday night and they they kind of attacked cam's family with their words so cam bought back he said he fought back and um and cast them away told commanded them to leave so uh that's one i see they have confidence or if they only sing certain songs remember when simon is here we talked a little bit about that and there may there's no doubt some songs that are wrong right there's no songs that are not scriptural and so we can change the lyrics or we cannot sing them at all we have that liberty in christ but see people will clearly uh make themselves holier because their flesh can do that that's something the flesh can do right i can grow my beard i cannot eat meat pork i can just sing brother brand of songs in the there's a song book called the believers or only believe songbook jeffersonville printed it years ago by the amen sisterhood and so people say oh you only can use that songbook brother i've never said that but see see how people see how paul is trying to say don't trust in anything anything your flesh can do don't trust in that trust in jesus's righteousness because remember when you're really walking in the spirit you're walking in gratitude now i'm holy because of what i can do but i'm holy because jesus is in me praise god and then it's it's all thankful it's all gratitude well you don't single songs that's that's fine oh you don't uh you don't shave your face that's fine that we're we're still brothers you know i can still love them praise god and so can you right we can still have the spirit of christ and not have confidence in our flesh now this is one recently uh jeffersonville says you have to have uh i'm sorry they said if you if you're a tape church you that that's a sign of the token so that that's a you know that's a false doctrine if you do that you break ephesians four praise god you can't break a scripture like that now pastor worship is something where especially big name messages preachers not them but many people in their churches they think just because i sit under this well-known preacher i'm saved i've got the holy ghost i just seen a good testimony from a message church a brother who was in his 60s said uh he just got re-baptized he said because i realized for 40 years i've been going to this pastor's church and i was never born again and he said i had an intellectual religious spirit and he was up there weeping and crying now church that's sincerity right there when you realize wow i was i i just got ahead now so see how do you know the difference because you once you leave here you don't live the word amen but when you really love god and really love jesus then you live by every word not just here but especially out there praise god and he realized i haven't been living it i thought what a beautiful testimony they re-baptized him and they the church praised god and i just thought he was praising the lord what a blessing to be free now look that's that's being demons cast out there too because my man said the worst demonic spirit is the religious spirit like the pharisees and sadducees had so see that's one thing we that that becomes a legalistic thing we'll see i go to the bigger church or for us well we go to the smaller church that don't make us anything i know jesus said a little flock but that don't mean us i don't mean it it's just us or any small church that's not what it means uh so people whatever whatever condition people are in satan's trying to get them uh to to have confidence in what they can do rather than what christ does in them amen and then that last one we talked about that short sleeves now i haven't heard that one since probably right when we first came in the message around 2001 or 2002 i haven't seen it since then but it's a clear example if a man wears short sleeves he's backslidden is what people have said okay i'll tell you another one too we don't preach on very much but ministers ministers have to marry virgins that's another confidence in the flesh because that's not taught in the bible that's taught in the old testament but that can't come over to the new right because if you take because there's so many requirements for priests one of them is you can't have a blemish in your eye well what about paul paul was constantly battling eye problems well then he's out of if he's out we're all out because he said he said uh he he was made righteous he said if you change one thing of this word you're cursed so if he's if he can't even make it how we gonna make it praise god he met jesus the spirit you know theophany to face i'll say it like that not face to face with it but theophany jesus's face as a theophany to his face he met them or he met jesus rather not them he met jesus as theophany and so that's another one now a lot of people will put me on the message for that that's fine in their eyes i probably never was in the message but i know the message is in me that's what matters praise god i don't have to be in their message because i know the message the word of god is in me amen praise god so kick me out do whatever you want i'm a holy ghost-filled saint praise god i'm going to keep following jesus i'm going to keep trying to help them out by god's grace now so see church what we get then paul's talking about when you have confidence in the flesh you you're you're preaching legalism right it's something you can do on your own right and that's adding to the word short sleeves beards no pork adding to the word right and if you make that like you're holier because of that that's added now lasciviousness is the opposite which is where most churches will get caught up here because lasciviousness is lawlessness look at that lawlessness people say we're not under the law but lascivious this means lawlessness no law so we know we are under the law of the holy spirit the holy spirit gives us his word and we've got to pack out the orders amen right that's the law of the holy spirit in other words always please the holy spirit amen so it's not legalism but it's it's it's it's plea it's obeying the holy spirit and doing what he commands us to do so see like today they'll take it away like women can wear high heels or you know it's easiest to understand those because it's the most noticeable right uh you know also his families can skip church and they can be just and they can be just as good off that's impossible brother said you'll never be as good of a christian unless you come to the house of god right because you're gathered with saints of like precious faith i've heard have you heard preachers around the message that they couldn't wait till they got back in the congregation after coven because they felt the people we just knew they're getting weaker right with because you're not with the other people and the bible says gather more as you see that day approaching very sky so we we knew we had to do it for a little bit or at least you know try to honor them but we we believe at some point we come back and so people are grateful to be back amen they're great see they're they're grateful to be back following the word of god praise god now here let's go move on here now verse nine sorry uh philippians 3 9. it says and be found in him so paul suffered the loss of all things verse 9 to be found in him not having his own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith so when we have faith in jesus christ and truly believe jesus christ that faith means trust and have blessed assurance when we are assured of jesus's word it makes us righteous because whatever we believe about christ impacts our actions whatever you put in is going to come out in fact i just heard on the radio yesterday uh where they were saying music will program your actions and i thought glory i thought that's our good music is programming my obedience to jesus amen like that's why they crank up like the louder the music and uh the more it impacts your your actions i thought well praise god not that we're trying to be too loud but what i'm saying is that uh we need to worship god with our voice the bible said lift your voice amen amen play loud on the tambourine and the symbols amen amen and so the holy spirit gets in the worship and when we worship god it changes our behavior that's why a lot of people their behavior don't change because they don't sing along but amen they they don't lift their voice right sister they don't raise their hands enough we you got to get in the spirit of the worship and then you'll get in the spirit of the word amen it's so clear it's so it's so plain praise god you have we have to get in the spirit and then when we get under that worship then we receive the word and we live the word it produces action and behavior in our lives praise god now he said i know jesus in the power of his resurrection see because paul had a resurrected life like we have we knew we were dead in sins we we knew we were lost like that song says right we knew our loss but jesus raised us up out of that life so we know him in the power of his resurrection i've never seen physically dead people race a life i believe it i know it happens my grandpa saw it they prayed for it but i know my life has been raised from a sinful habitual life of sin to a life of godly fear and obedience to the word of god amen in other words i've seen resurrection power praise god amen and then of course with my mom being healed of cancer and you know and ones that have been close to death god brings them back because he has the power of resurrection amen amen yes so paul said that i may know him i'll lose everything that i can know the power of the resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death so jesus's power and second his sufferings make us conformable to his death how many know that there's a purpose behind you dying how many know if the rapture don't come you're going to die someday well jesus's plan is that as you get closer to death you become more like him and he uses these two things resurrection power these signs shall follow them that believe and he uses sufferings amen in order to make you conformable to die like christ so he'll use supernatural signs miracles and wonders but he'll also use suffering that you and i must go through in order to make us uh be able to live a life like christ to accept the trials that come our way in order to have obedience like christ okay so let's look at this one here so conform means receive the same form as so resurrection power and suffering makes you receive the same death that christ received like that's why he said take up your cross daily and follow him right amen it's going to be hard there's going to be hard times praise god the cross is not going to be easy to carry right but god has to allow suffering to help us die out to all selfishness so as time goes on i'll say like this as we get closer to the light you've heard it said we should have we should see more of our imperfections displayed and that is god's plan if we don't something's wrong right because as you get closer you you suffer more right but you also see god's power more praise hallelujah god where you see it many times is in your own life you see god change your habits or change your mindset or change your attitudes praise god right although you suffer you're able to endure now look this reminded me of jesus in the days of his flesh remember we have to be conformed or receive the same death that he did well that means if he offered up prayers and supplications with strong trying or strong crying rather in tears and was heard then we must do the same thing he learned obedience by the things he suffered so all the times he was rejected remember his disciples let's call fire down from heaven and jesus said you don't know what spirit you are of but yet he had to suffer rejection he had to suffer everybody uh saying crucify him crucify him he had to suffer uh just the worst uh the worst evil that you could imagine against him how'd he get through it he prayed with tears amen in other words he just had to pray about it praise god when people come against you and and uh times get tough all you can do is just pray sometimes amen god didn't deliver jesus from every suffering god let him go through through prayers uh and strong crime and he just had to endure he just had to go another mile praise god amen remember he never overcame the devil by a miracle but yet jesus saw many miracles but in some of his greatest trials and temptations was lucifer himself he just had to endure by speaking the word and he just had to overcome he just had to suffer and and obey the word of god and then refreshing would come after satan left him amen satan would leave him for a season and the angels of god would minister to him praise god and then he is the author unto all that obey him so if jesus had to go through suffering and the only thing he could do is pray about it and cry about it you ever had that ever felt like a cry baby always taken your crying to god nobody else wants to listen to you maybe well you're a lot like jesus then because there's some things he just had to cry about pray about amen and then he would suffer through it and keep carrying on amen amen hallelujah and paul says this is what i'm being conformed to i'm going to receive the same death jesus received which they were both martyrs but i'm i'm being made ready so i can receive that through the power of the resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings now look he's the author so he wrote the book on how to be delivered so if he wrote it then he's going to make sure it's carried out the same way and he's going to make sure it's carried out in our lives praise god you know many times people brother amen many times people don't know at the end of service when i cry many times i'm crying over the battles i go through yeah i'm enjoying worshiping god i love that but many times i'm just saying god give me strength help me to help me to love when i get slapped or not slap physically but uh when i get rejected or something like that when people say evil things about me many times i'm just saying god give me grace give me grace to love them back and that's scripture i'm going to be that scripture this is how jesus overcome go pray about it right sometimes you want to run to brother sister can you can you help me and but really the thing is go pray about it that's right your brother sister might not be able to help you right now sometimes they can right and some and i do want your prayers i want everybody's prayers you want my prayers right but there's gonna be times where god is gonna ask you and just draw your magnet would go over all the shavings and help clean up the mesh shavings off the floor between the shifts i remember the story uh he said i want to ask you something why didn't all them shavings go up he said well you see reverend branham some of them that magnet won't take said it can't go to the magnet because it's not magnetized to it they're aluminum them aluminum shavings won't pick up the magnet i said hallelujah he said what's the matter with you you're in a steel mill saying hallelujah what's the matter with you i said what's the matter that's some iron laying there why didn't go up bolt it down i said glory to god he said what's the matter with you so there's things that should have gone up but couldn't because they were tied down there's things that could have gone up but wouldn't because they weren't the right quality praise god and he said i'm thinking a way back into the heavens there's a big magnet called the son of god there's people being magnetized down here oh you might be a shaving or a church member but brother unless you're magnetized through the power of the resurrection and conform to his power of the son of god that one of these days god will press the button and some of these shackled down people with the worldly lusts and pleasures will be left here with cold formal church members will lay there so he says if if if if cold church members don't go in the rapture it's because they didn't have the right material praise god in other words they weren't made of the same material they weren't made of the word amen they weren't born again they didn't have eternal life inside them praise god he said but them who are born again them that are in christ god will bring with him in the resurrection going in yonder in a big molding pot these old frail bodies be molded in it and made into his own glorious likeness so see we can't let the things of the world bolt us down right we can't be in other words we can't be too closely connected to the world we got to be free from the cares of the world we got to take care of it i say like this i got to take that 30 minutes in the morning brother amen pay the bills i got to email back the the insurance i got to email back the the bank person but after that i'm not tied to that the rest of the day i'm back serving jesus amen amen i'm back praising god trusting in the lord god you're going to take care of that business deal you're going to take care of this you're going to take care of that i'm not tied to that i'm tied to jesus christ amen so he said you're either tied down to the cares of the world or you're not the right quality i want to be free from the things of the world and i want to be a real holy ghost-filled saint amen thank the lord verse 11 if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead my brother adam says this is quite a statement any means now remember paul goes through remember his resume of suffering this is a beautiful passage he was whipped uh five times often in jail being with rods you remember this right this was his resume of suffering he said this is how i'm going to know christ through the sufferings he says i was beaten thrice uh and then he says i had many journeys perils perils of robbers he was robbed many times uh in the wilderness perils in the sea among false brethren in other words any time he could have trouble he had trouble but he realized all these troubles are making me trust in christ more amen oh if god can just help us to see that this morning praise god all of our troubles are i'll say like this all the looming troubles through the government right all the looming troubles and all the the looming rioting and the evil uh riots that are going on and all the trouble that's looming around and we know is just going to increase at some point right all this looming all of it will be used in order to prepare us for the coming of the lord amen that's right and paul said it's by any means he said lord if by any means i want to obtain unto the resurrection of the dead in other words i will suffer whatever i have to suffer so i can be at the first resurrection and this is what brother bam says in the church age book he says we must not discredit the words of jesus who says for summer found the book of life who will either receive eternal life before the general resurrection or after it paul does not obey this truth because he says ephesians philippians 3 11. if by any means i might obtain to the resurrection of the dead now this statement is most peculiar isn't it we all know that we're all going to a resurrection whether we want to or not all will be resurrected right we know everybody's going to the resurrection he says this so paul could hardly be saying if by any means i might attain to a resurrection of the dead the truth of the matter he's not saying that the literal me reading is if by any means i might attain to the out resurrection from among the dead this is not the attaining to the general or second resurrection the white throne but attaining to the first resurrection which is the rapture praise god so paul is saying i'm going to skip reading all that because you're pretty probably familiar with that paul's saying and by any means i might obtain to the rapture praise god in other words jesus help me to suffer whenever i have to suffer so i will be in the first resurrection all right look at this all the paul knew all the saints knew there was going to be two resurrections a resurrection for the holy uh the real church of god and then a resurrection for everybody else oh that's my prayer i've just got a few more decades left in life i'll say it like that you know if i'm 40. i got i got a handful of decades left with the lord terry's lord by any means i want to make the rapture praise god amen that should be our prayer that was paul's prayer i've suffered shipwrecked i've been beaten i've been robbed i've been mugged i've been cursed remember those men want to do a vow on paul's life to curse him even jewish brothers try to they won't eat until they kill paul but yet god gave him the victory look at all that he endured all for the sake of christ and to have christ righteousness that's a real example to me praise god and so my prayers god let me suffer anything that i'll obtain to that same resurrection where paul's going to be praise god verse 12 not as though i had already obtained see paul was saying i have not obtained this this great state of maturity either we're already perfect now that actual word actually means uh the word perfect does mean mature but i follow after if that i may apprehend that wit for which also i am apprehended of of christ jesus so paul admits he's not perfect but he's following after christ that he might seize or lay a hold of him who seized him that's quite a picture paul is like in jesus's hand but yet he's saying i'm trying to hold jesus interesting i thought there i he said i want to apprehend the person who's apprehending me praise god amen my i'll say that's kind of how we feel right we know jesus is in our heart but how many want to hug jesus i know haven't's going to say amen on that one right right you want to sit in his lap but isn't that the reality like don't we just like want to just grab this and just hold him we just want to we want to look at his nails nail scars in his hands and we want to see him and paul saying that's what paul's saying he said i want to obtain i'm going to apprehend that which has got a hold of me praise god amen in other words i want my faith to become sight praise god amen i want to see the rapture amen i want to meet him in the air i want to meet brother brahem and john wesley and martin luther all these men of god i want to see them i want to know it's real but even more so praise god i want to see it with these eyes then i'll get new eyes i won't need my glasses anymore that's what he's saying i'm gonna follow hard he says i follow after now here's the next here's some greek definitions right follow after is the same greek word where he said press toward the mark in jesus name we press on we sang it what a good song perfect it's the same word it means to run swiftly seek after eagerly now anybody that knows these days sports were really popular in the bible days right that's what the greeks were all about right romans so paul purposely used his sports over and over again he's saying you've got you see all these guys training right they train all around rome they train all over corinth they're getting ready for the the olympic games you know i don't know if they're called olympic gets that time but they were getting ready and paul is saying look you see him out there he said we have to follow after the and press toward the mark of the high calling you need to run swiftly can you imagine they're sitting maybe in caves and or maybe they're in somebody's house like aquila priscilla and they see runners right it's the lord's day you know they're worshipping in the house paul's preaching and yet they see athletes out there we probably could too right we could probably look out of the road see people sweating it was something very common and paul's saying take a lesson from those runners spiritually amen keep running for jesus don't let your life go to waste amen be active follow hard after the high calling in christ jesus amen in other words don't sit still praise god run towards the goal try to finish the race amen they're getting ready for this akron marathon pretty soon well little did they know i've been running the marathon all these years in akron and they just got the wrong one here this is the right acronym right here praise god because we've been running for 14 years preaching the message for 14 years in akron amen here am i running with a message saying come come to the message come to the word of god that god's word is true the mysteries are finished praise god come and run the gospel race praise god i'll keep running my marathon they i saw some of them again practicing their their 14 miles today they're 15 miles today praise god but we got we're gaining our spiritual miles right amen glory praise god paul's saying i i'm not acting like won the race he said i'm running after and i'm trying to apprehend the next this has even more definitions he said verse now this is 14 i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus oh i press i run towards the goal the finish line for the prize the award the rewards amen of jesus for the high which means heavenly i i'm running spiritually to the goal to get my reward for the for the heavenly calling the heavenly invitation which is in christ jesus because jesus invited us to the marriage supper praise god just like he invited his disciples he said i'll drink no more the fruit of the vine until we drink it anew in my father's kingdom praise god amen this is the high calling this is the heavenly feast the heavenly invitation he said run towards the heavenly feasts i know there's a lot of people gonna run to chipotle right they're gonna run to the next feast for lunch like we might even do and we might not run but there's people that got drunk last night and they're going to run to bob evans today to get their feast we know we have to eat but our lives should have a spiritual urgency like we're running for jesus christ praise god amen and we're running for a different kind of feast most people don't even know what it's like to fast right most people don't even know uh but we got to be willing to do that by god's grace to keep our walk pure with the lord right to humble ourselves to be refreshed praise god that was verse 14. let me go to verse 13 now because i didn't read 13. look at 13. brethren i can't i count not myself to have apprehended so he's saying i haven't i haven't seized on christ on my reward yet right but this one thing i do i forget those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before remember what was something before what was something before paul he wanted to visit them again remember that was one thing oh perhaps the lord will open a door i'll get to go to philippi he was reaching for remember he remember he believed in chapter one i'm gonna get out of this prison remember he said that through your prayers he was reason there was always something he was reaching for praise god now for me i always got to keep something i got to keep the next book or the next video or the next opportunity i can witness always got to keep something before me right like the bible says reaching forth to those things which are before like oh i can't wait if simon gets going back to thailand or oh just pray let's pray god open up more doors for a missionary to get into every country praise god we can send them praise god we can give a little offering and help them on their way we always have to constantly be running but reaching for the next the next step praise god we're going to reach for the next goal hallelujah there's one final goal we know that that's death or the rapture that's the final goal but there's things we're reaching for there's rewards we're trying to reach in this life now look true humility forgets the past and reaches forward see churches mispreach us all the time they say just forget about your past but church our past haunts us if we don't repent of it right who wants to be haunted by their past well the way to do that is like jesus said i'm sorry i forgot this come over here true humility forgets the past and reaches forward we only forget and move on from the past when we thoroughly repent that's the only way we can ever forget the things that's the way i can forget my sinful life is remember i confess that i said forgive me jesus and i made it right amen then i can press on then i can move on and i can run for because i've left it behind and i've done it the right way right i'm not haunted by my past how many believe christians should be free from your past sins amen absolutely if he's faithful to forgive us of all unrighteousness right do you remember jesus's statement how many people will be willing to do this if you come to bring your gift to the altar and remember your brother hath ought against thee leave your gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother then coming after thy gift now i've seen it in good ways i've seen people call i've seen people at our church over on waterloo there was something wrong before church they had to get on the phone and call to make something right then they came into church i know that's a good idea but then i've seen people take it the wrong way where people won't come and have communion because something's not right well then why don't you make it right if you knew we're gonna have communion a week ago how come you didn't take this week and make it right you see see there there's an understanding where paul says the only way i can press on is forget those things and if i forget him the only way i can forget him is this jesus puts him under the sea of forgetfulness amen praise god i don't know that's the only way i can forget him is that the blood blots them out amen that's real christianity not forgetting what is for getting not caring for it i don't care about those things that i've done anymore my sins i i i forget them i don't care about it that anymore i'm pressing on right i don't care to think about that's what that's the way we got to get we got to forgive ourselves sometimes right i don't care i don't care about that i know jesus forgave me that right i'm not going to take time to worry about i'm not going to worry about that jesus took care of that praise god i tried to make it right with that brother i tried to make it right with that sister i did my part praise god i'm pressing all and i'm forgetting about those things praise god now i want to also bring the other thought we're supposed to neglect our sins that are under the blood but then paul says don't neglect the gospel don't forget about that right so we must we must neglect our past sins don't bring them up anymore right leave them under the blood we must neglect those but we must focus on the supernatural power of god he says therefore we ought to give more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip now slip means slip your mind so again we got to be careful what are we meditating on right what are we made at meditating on i'm going to go back for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression disobedience received a just recompense of reward so see we cannot let the gospel slip paul said how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation so we can't let the delivering power of jesus christ slip our minds in other words when we hear about prayer requests of people that are struggling we've got to have faith we've got to get our mustard seed of faith and say i'll pray for you i'll skip this lunch meal i'll skip supper just to pray for you church we got how many want to be willing to do that i want to be willing to do that praise god we cannot neglect or let the power of god slip our minds because that's what it says which at first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that hurt him god also bearing witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will see we're to neglect the flesh and our past sins and not the holy ghost see a lot of message people they'll they'll confess their sins but then they won't focus on the supernatural of god the power of god right lord keep sanctifying me prepare me for the next miracle you'll help me to run forward help me to run the race with perseverance amen they're not reaching towards anything right they don't want to see their gifts grow they're not really reaching that realm and they don't want to see more people save they're not reaching forward but we've got to run to reach the next goal praise god hallelujah amen i don't know if you love this holy word of god right here don't you love it god knew this would feed us for 2 000 years amen he knew the church would feed on this revelation that this is the attitude we have and this was his this is his final remember finally this is what he said this is how i'm ending the letter that takes another chapter to end it but this is how he's reminding the saints to remember the things of god now church believe the sign now i don't know if the debate the debate is scheduled for the saturday i emailed the brother the questions a month ago and i still haven't got my questions i'm supposed to answer so i don't know if we're going to debate this saturday or not it's not really fair if i give him a whole month with his questions and i don't have any or my questions and he's never given me his question so i emailed the brother yesterday i haven't heard back from him anyways i've been listening to some of them together kind of get ready for their their their mindset you know and the scriptures that they they try to use but they rebuke brother branham because he said god took hope in sharon rose when he disobeyed the word of god now how wrong is that the bible says every transgression reaps some type of consequence right everyone reaps some kind of some kind of consequence not that god is like eternally angry with us but we have to learn our lesson right we have to learn from the things we suffer and sometimes as we learn and suffer because it's our mistake what about this how many people ever thought about this hebrew says he chastens that means spanx every son that he loves jesus said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten david's sin because of david's sin the sword never left his house did you know absalon not only came against him but also a mesa another son both and then i just read that a mesa one this morning he had to go out with uh thousands of soldiers and like basically just overthrow uh their uh their army a mesa and then blew the trumpet said a mace is the king let's all run away from david you know david got taken over by absalom constantly in and out of struggles now talk about church splits your own son and then david got in the flesh and he was with absalom he was crying over absalom and the people are like david we just won a victory we just got you this kingdom back and you're crying about it he said if you don't cry if he said if you don't go out there and rejoice they're going to rebel against you because you'd rather that your son was alive and we were all dead and david said you're right and he went out there and went we met with the people and worshiped my church all right we've got to be careful what kind of attitude we have right we got to walk in the holy spirit praise god but the sword never left his house because of his sin yet we heard it he's a man after the heart of god yeah we would think oh well he's a man for god's own heart well surely god won't let any more bad things happen to him no god made him pay in other words god made him learn from his mistake you can't lie about murdering and killing and then expect to get away with it there's going to be consequences so my question is is god a dodie grandpa that lets you get away with everything no of course not david numbered the people church and 70 000 people died where are we at with chronovirus i think it's 180 000 around the world seventy thousand people died and david cries at the end he said god why are you letting the sheep die what for my sin but then god stopped it after seventy thousand now i don't understand that how could god let 70 000 people die for one man's sin of number in the people but the bible called it a pestilence did you know leprosy stayed in geheza's family forever because of his one mistake does god correct us yes remember naaman just got healed and elijah's like no we don't want any reward like it's like brother i'm turning down the million and a half dollars right after a miracle he turned it down he said why should we get a reward for something god did elijah said the same thing but hazel went out there said oh we'll take the money and then elijah said the curse his leprosy's on you because you thought we should get rewarded for doing a miracle now i hope that helps church look people are criticizing brother branham because he basically lived a biblical life they're criticizing the fact that god had to chasten him and treat him as a son how many want to be sons and daughters amen i want god to treat me like a son i don't want to be like a bastard child i want to be like a real son of god amen that means god's got to correct me like what i'm almost done he said press towards the mark verse 14 and 15. i pressed toward the mark for the high first i'm sorry for the prize of the high calling of god this invitation of god which is in christ jesus let us therefore as many be perfect let us be thus minded and if in anything you be otherwise minded god shall even reveal this unto you look paul says those of us who are perfect as many as be perfect in other words as any as many as being mature christians keep this runner's mindset keep running the race church right lay aside any sin that hinders your walk with god lay it aside and run the race with perseverance and he says keep this runner's mindset he said god will reveal any change to this revelation that's what we were saying last week if god ever changed anything about the message or the squeeze or the rapture god will let us know praise god because we're keeping paul's commandments amen we're preaching paul's gospel hallelujah and if anything he said if anything would change different if anything would be even thus unto you i'm sorry otherwise minded if anything would be differently taught he said god will reveal it before the coming amen hallelujah so let's take a runner's mindset that means we got to be willing to work praise god right how many of you like to get up and run in the morning i used to but i don't like it anymore so i don't do it i know amen did this summer a couple times but paul said that's the attitude you got to get up i'm ready to go work i don't feel like it i don't want to go running i don't want to sweat i don't want to do this but i've got to go run because i'm a runner praise god i've got to have a runner's mindset i've got to press on i've got to finish this course amen i'm not going to quit or give up i'm going to keep pressing hard until i reach it praise god amen that's how it is with this book i've had to just keep i just have to keep pressing on many times i don't feel like it i don't feel like writing more i've already got over almost 300 000 words i don't feel like it but i know if god used that other one to help people and deliver them from their denominational thoughts right and help them get rid of their pants and wear skirts well how's god going to use this one praise god with all the ammunition this one and even if it helps just a couple and brings out brings the light if even it helps a couple i know it'll strengthen anyone who loves to read the word of god i've just got to look at it like a race i'm almost done with the race i've almost reached that where they call them stations in the marathon is that what they come where they got like you know gatorade cups and everything like that i never worked a marathon i know bangs run one but where's bang anyways he run a marathon today he's running a spiritual marathon praise god bless you sorry he's probably listening bless your servants run your spiritual marathon by god's grace we'll probably see him tonight see we got to have brother said remember brother remember those quotes i read brother he said i like a man who knows what he's aiming for he said a man who has a goal he's shooting for something but i'm saying like a man who takes initiative he knows what he's fighting for praise god i like that he's talking about abraham lincoln too verse 16. nevertheless where to we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mine the same thing okay so be thus minded again the book about the mind battle everybody keep this attitude we're going to press on towards the mark we're going to keep running right we're going to reach we're going to hold forth the word of life and we're going to reach our our next goal he said i'm not acting like i've already obtained it he said but we need to walk now look he said run and i said now we need to walk by the same rule so i guess there's times you walk in your christian journey let us walk by the same rule let's mine the same thing so direct your life by the measuring stick measure your life by the word of god right live within god's rules god's boundaries possess your land right your inheritance maintain your inheritance that's what the word rule means it means a measuring rod as in the olympic games to measure a leap to measure your running right measure your marathon or what do they call it your laps measure your laps right paul says measure it walk by the same measurement now how's that one same one right okay i forgot that yeah paul says examine yourself whether you be in the faith prove yourselves so see paul says if you don't measure yourself with god's word you become a reprobate right a reprobate is a rejected mind if you don't use your mind to measure and see how am i living up to this word paul said you'll let your mind wander to you don't even care and you become a reprobate how many seen that amongst church members they don't even care to measure themselves by the word so pretty soon then homosexuality's okay violence is okay mur abortion's okay it's okay they become reprobates the bible says because they they fail to keep themselves lined up to the word of god so measure means to make a test test your life right test your life by the word of god i'm closing with this mark he said verse 17 mark the good and the bad i just closed my bible sorry i didn't mean to i'm trying to close here mercy philippians 3 17 brethren be followers together of me and mark them which have i'm sorry which walk so as you have us for an example so follow the prophet of god and those who keep his example okay so we mark he said mark yes mark them which are good examples so we need to know amongst ourselves now mark means to stare at right observe them fix your eyes on them direct your attention so see there's times you gotta just look at people if they're living the right way praise god how are they living this way right but then there's other times why are these people falling away that's why i listen to like jeffersonville or believe the sign why you have to give them attention to understand why are they living like this you have to observe them you have to mark them okay oh i know that this group started falling away when they did this so i will abstain from that right or this group they got a revival when they did this praise god amen now i beseech you brother and mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine so mark those who break doctrine which have learned and avoid them so you got to mark them you got to point them out for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple when people break the word of god and they they uh and they only have church in order to feed themselves right either physically or financially and they break the doctrine of the word he said they're no longer serving the lord jesus christ look at verse let's go back to philippians 3 we'll finish up here let's stand our feet and i'll finish this now look paul says almost church the exact same thing as he did in in uh romans here he said they serve their belly now look at philippians 3 18 for many walk of whom i have told you often and now they and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is the destruction whose god is their belly see that's the same thing right we just read paul said those that uh break doctrine their god is their belly and he says it here to the philippians and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things for our conversation is in heaven what are we talking about today heaven praise god what do the other dogs think about all they think about is the earth now we want god to meet our earthly needs right but these guys go overboard these dogs go overboard that's all they talk about is the earthly blessings earthly blessings instead of thinking about heaven that's why i know we're different because we talk about the rapture church most churches like my wife luther never even heard about the rapture i was in the pentecostal church i don't remember ever hearing about the rapture i heard about judgment day thank god but see paul says we're trying to obtain that first resurrection amen i said we're trying to we're pressing on towards that praise god musicians if you'll come let me stop right there now we'll probably pick up maybe later on verse 18. he says weeping so see paul sighed and cried for the abominations the preachers were doing hallelujah thank you jesus what a blessing church let's not forget this is the church of the first lydia not our lydia this is the church of the first lydia the first convert this is the church of the philippian jailer and not just him but his whole house because he said thy thy house shall be saved amen amen glory this is the church of the woman who had the spirit of divination but now she had the spirit of jesus christ and paul is telling them be like-minded pick a runner's mindset know that you've got to go exercise you've got to stay spiritually healthy praise god you've got to always be running for the next mark for the next goal pressing toward the mark of the high calling [Music] so as we close our eyes let's just think about how are we living are we running are we causing divisions jesus christ [Music] my book [Music] i'm pressing [Music] god
