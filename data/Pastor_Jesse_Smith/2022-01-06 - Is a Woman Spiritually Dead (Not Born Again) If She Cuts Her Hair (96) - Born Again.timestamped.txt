[0:00] [Music]
[0:07] greetings friends in the matches name of
[0:09] the lord jesus christ
[0:11] recently i was asked the following
[0:13] question by a viewer who has left the
[0:16] message god gave to brother william
[0:19] branham he's in the group i call
[0:21] accusers of brother branham
[0:23] he asked a question about a brother
[0:25] branham quote i used in a recent video
[0:28] saying
[0:29] thus saith the lord a woman who cuts her
[0:31] hair is dead
[0:33] where is the scripture
[0:34] in the bible
[0:36] as i replied and showed him the
[0:38] scriptures that prove this statement
[0:40] from brother branham is true i realize
[0:42] this might be a helpful video
[0:44] to make for all of our viewers
[0:47] the thus saith the lord quote from
[0:49] brother branham
[0:51] let's begin by listening to the quote in
[0:53] question from brother
[0:57] must branham
[0:58] it to an age into a purpose
[1:01] therefore he had long hair the woman
[1:03] that's a child of god lets her hair grow
[1:05] to show us she's consecrated to every
[1:08] word of god
[1:10] if she cuts it off i don't care how much
[1:12] she dances sings sit in the choir speaks
[1:16] in tongues runs up and down who has all
[1:18] kind of aids society she's dead
[1:23] that's thus saith the lord
[1:26] the word of god first corinthians 14
[1:31] let's look at the context of brother
[1:33] branham's quote
[1:35] i'll begin by saying this was a great
[1:37] question
[1:38] before reading my answer to the man i
[1:41] want to first preface my answer to
[1:44] explain the context of brother branham's
[1:46] thus saith the lord statement from god
[1:48] of this evil age 1965.
[1:51] in the five preceding paragraphs before
[1:54] this thus saith the lord's statement
[1:56] brother branham was preaching in context
[1:58] about the false vine the reprobate
[2:01] church
[2:01] or the serpent seed group of people who
[2:04] claim to be believers but are deceivers
[2:07] and are ultimately lost
[2:09] he's preaching against the reprobates
[2:11] the tares who look like wheat believers
[2:15] but are liars and deceivers
[2:17] beginning in paragraph number 142
[2:20] about five paragraphs before the thus
[2:22] say the lord quote you find brother
[2:24] branham's exact words mentioning this
[2:27] terror group for example he calls them
[2:30] children of disobedience
[2:32] then he says they're the balaam group
[2:34] he says they're the modern religious
[2:36] ecumenical group and then he mentions
[2:39] denominations like church of christ
[2:41] baptist presbyterian pentecostals
[2:44] who are in the ecumenical group that say
[2:47] we are all one
[2:49] brother branham continues and says this
[2:51] is the group who takes the mark of the
[2:52] beast and calls it the reprobate church
[2:56] then brother branham mentions women
[2:58] cutting their hair
[2:59] he said if a woman cuts her hair she
[3:01] loses her consecration to god even
[3:03] though she gets the anointing for some
[3:06] religious acts in the holy spirit like
[3:08] dancing and speaking in tongues
[3:10] she's spiritually dead
[3:12] as i'll mention at the end of this video
[3:14] jesus described this group in matthew
[3:16] chapter 7 verses 21 through 23 and he
[3:20] calls them workers of iniquity
[3:22] and this is the same false anointed ones
[3:25] jesus spoke of in matthew 24 verse 24.
[3:29] brother branham is speaking about women
[3:30] who sell out god's truth about hair
[3:33] length to the god of this evil modern
[3:36] age
[3:37] these women love hollywood fashion
[3:40] they're daughters of the modern jezebel
[3:42] and they worship hollywood and love her
[3:45] connection to the ecumenical movement of
[3:47] churches
[3:48] finally after rebuking the reprobates
[3:50] brother branham mentions a woman that's
[3:52] a child of god who cuts her hair
[3:55] is dead with thus saith the lord
[3:58] so there are two types of child of god
[4:00] believers who brother branham could be
[4:03] talking about here
[4:04] the first kind would be a woman that was
[4:06] at one time a child of god who was once
[4:09] saved by grace
[4:11] but forfeits her salvation
[4:13] losing her salvation failing the grace
[4:15] of god as hebrews 12 verse 15 teaches
[4:19] selling out the truth of god's word for
[4:21] the false church system and accepting
[4:23] the mark of the beast
[4:25] this type of woman is like judas
[4:27] iscariot who did the same
[4:29] judas fell by transgression according to
[4:31] acts 1 verse 25
[4:33] and jesus christ himself said he would
[4:35] blot out the names of those who did not
[4:37] overcome the world by rejecting the
[4:40] white raiment of eternal life in
[4:42] revelation 3 verse 5 so jesus christ
[4:45] also says people can lose their
[4:46] salvation
[4:48] revelation 3 verse 5 says he that
[4:50] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[4:53] white raiment and i will not blot out
[4:55] his name out of the book of life but
[4:58] i'll confess his name before my father
[5:01] and before his angels
[5:03] hebrews 10 29 is another scripture that
[5:06] proves people can lose their salvation
[5:08] if they're not born again or baptized
[5:10] with the holy ghost
[5:12] of how much sore punishment suppose ye
[5:15] shall he be thought worthy who hath trod
[5:18] and underfoot the son of god and hath
[5:20] counted the blood of the covenant
[5:22] wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[5:24] thing and hath done despite under the
[5:26] spirit of grace
[5:28] so in context this scripture says a
[5:30] person can be justified and sanctified
[5:33] but still reject the effects of the holy
[5:35] spirit or reject the spirit of grace the
[5:38] bible says
[5:39] this is just like judas is scared he was
[5:42] saved and even baptized other believers
[5:45] according to the book of saint john
[5:47] and no doubt he was sanctified because
[5:48] he was clean enough to do miracles like
[5:51] all the other eleven apostles
[5:54] but at the passover judas left jesus and
[5:56] satan entered into him
[5:58] and that was the moment he transgressed
[6:01] the lord satan filled his heart and he
[6:03] became a reprobate
[6:06] that's where he made his final choice to
[6:07] become the son of perdition the son of
[6:10] destruction
[6:11] and that was the moment he forfeited his
[6:13] salvation
[6:15] if you'd like to learn more about this
[6:16] subject you can see my 2021 book the 12
[6:19] new testament mysteries revealed and
[6:22] this topic is addressed on pages
[6:24] 384 through 388.
[6:27] you can also find more about it
[6:30] on pages 252
[6:32] to page 261
[6:35] there's so much bible evidence for
[6:36] people who can lose their salvation
[6:39] because they fail to move on with the
[6:40] holy spirit
[6:42] and the type is many of the israelites
[6:44] who left egypt in the exodus
[6:47] were destroyed in the wilderness because
[6:49] their hearts turned away from god and
[6:51] turned back to egypt
[6:52] if you can't afford a copy of my 2021
[6:55] book i'll be happy to email you a free
[6:57] ebook or pdf copy
[7:00] the second type of child of god believer
[7:03] brother branham could be talking about
[7:04] is a foolish virgin meaning a christian
[7:07] woman who was saved but not baptized
[7:10] with the holy ghost
[7:11] jesus teaches there are two kinds of
[7:13] christians in matthew 25 verses 1-13
[7:17] he calls them wise and foolish
[7:19] the wise have extra oil symbolizing they
[7:22] have the baptism of the holy ghost in
[7:24] their souls
[7:26] the foolish virgin did not prepare
[7:27] enough oil meaning they foolishly wasted
[7:30] their time and did not pray enough and
[7:32] did not obey god enough
[7:34] in order to receive the oil or baptism
[7:37] of the holy ghost in their souls
[7:39] since humans have three parts to their
[7:41] beings
[7:42] body human spirit or mind
[7:45] and soul according to first
[7:46] thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23
[7:49] a foolish virgin woman could have the
[7:52] anointing upon her body to dance in the
[7:54] spirit and also upon her human spirit or
[7:56] mind to be saved experiencing the
[7:59] anointing of the holy ghost to speak in
[8:01] tongues prophesy or manifest any of the
[8:04] nine gifts of the holy spirit
[8:06] yet her soul would not be quickened or
[8:08] made alive by the holy ghost
[8:11] so as the man asked where is the
[8:13] scripture in the bible for a woman that
[8:15] cuts her hair being dead
[8:18] here's my answer to the man's question
[8:20] on youtube
[8:22] i'll read it verbatim and then offer
[8:24] more bible proof afterwards
[8:27] quote yes sir that is exactly scriptural
[8:30] three scriptures help us see the truth
[8:32] that if a woman cuts her hair she is
[8:34] spiritually dead
[8:36] the first is first timothy 5 6
[8:39] in context it's about widow women who
[8:41] choose to live in pleasure rather than
[8:43] holiness
[8:44] but this scripture proves a woman
[8:46] without the baptism of the holy ghost is
[8:48] spiritually dead in her soul meaning her
[8:51] soul is not quickened
[8:53] we can clearly see how first timothy 5
[8:55] verse 6 says a woman who lives in
[8:57] worldly pleasure is spiritually dead
[9:00] while she's alive that's what i believe
[9:02] brother branham was teaching in this
[9:04] quote he was preaching about women that
[9:07] live according to the pleasures of
[9:08] hollywood rather than living consecrated
[9:10] to christ and if hollywood was the god
[9:13] of the woman then she would be
[9:15] spiritually dead while she's naturally
[9:16] alive
[9:19] second to prove the soul needs quickened
[9:22] we use ephesians 2 verses 1-5 these
[9:25] scriptures show a born-again saint has a
[9:27] quickened or made alive soul
[9:30] the opposite must be true that a person
[9:32] without the quickening power of the holy
[9:34] ghost has a dead or dormant soul
[9:37] third in first corinthians 11 verses 1
[9:40] through 16 the scriptures prove a woman
[9:43] who cuts her hair shames her head or
[9:45] husband which means she also shames
[9:48] christ and god for that is the order of
[9:50] headship
[9:51] a shameful woman who cuts her hair could
[9:53] not be born again as there is no
[9:55] scripture in the bible wherein god asks
[9:58] a godly woman to cut her hair
[10:00] i have two videos about hair length plus
[10:03] i wrote a book about modesty in 2019 if
[10:06] you want a free copy you can also listen
[10:08] to the book for free on my youtube
[10:10] channel
[10:11] with all due respect no one who has left
[10:14] the message has given an effort to read
[10:17] my two books that prove the message is
[10:19] the revelation of the bible so i doubt
[10:21] you will read it i write this in
[10:23] sincerity and not in malice i write with
[10:26] brotherly kindness and not in anger
[10:29] and i have heard your testimonies on the
[10:31] believe the sign podcast i respect you
[10:34] and love you with christian love but i
[10:36] greatly disagree with you
[10:38] lastly your statement that brother
[10:40] bill's video about the 1963 cloud was a
[10:43] lot of nonsense sadden me you gave no
[10:46] new proof for your claim despite brother
[10:49] bill clearly proving the cloud could not
[10:51] have been formed by man
[10:53] this cloud was formed by god as a sign
[10:55] to this generation
[10:57] i hope you will humbly and sincerely
[10:59] reconsider your positions
[11:01] god bless you and i hope this helps you
[11:03] love in christ brother jesse
[11:06] more bible proofs
[11:09] here are five more scriptures that help
[11:11] prove a woman who cuts her hair is not
[11:13] born again in her soul by the baptism of
[11:15] the holy ghost
[11:17] first two greek words in first
[11:19] corinthians 11 verses 1 through 16
[11:23] show the dishonor a woman shows toward
[11:25] her husband and christ and ultimately
[11:28] god the father
[11:29] the word dishonor in first corinthians
[11:31] 11 verse 5 means to shame down disgrace
[11:37] put to the blush
[11:39] confound dishonor shame so a woman who
[11:42] dishonors her husband christ and the
[11:45] invisible god is likely not born again
[11:49] the second greek word for shame from
[11:52] first corinthians 11 verse 14 means
[11:54] infamy indignity disgrace
[11:59] dishonor reproach shame or vile
[12:02] so in context it's referring to a man
[12:05] that does not cut his hair
[12:07] so the opposite must be true as well
[12:09] a woman who cuts her hair would also be
[12:11] reproachful and vile
[12:14] a vile man or woman
[12:16] would likely not be born again by the
[12:18] holy ghost baptism
[12:20] that's because acts 5 32 says god gives
[12:23] the holy ghost to them that obey him
[12:26] and a man who never cuts his hair is
[12:28] disobedient to the word and a woman who
[12:30] cuts her hair is disobedient to the word
[12:32] of god
[12:34] second first john 2 verses 15 15-17
[12:37] proves a woman who loves the fashions of
[12:40] the world like cutting hair does not
[12:43] have the love of god in her soul
[12:45] the love of god is also called god's
[12:47] spirit for god is love
[12:49] a woman without god's spirit is not born
[12:51] again in her soul this proves her soul
[12:54] is dead or not quickened by the spirit
[12:56] of god
[12:57] love not the world neither the things
[12:59] that are in the world if any man love
[13:01] the world the love of the father is not
[13:03] in him
[13:05] a third scripture is first peter 1 verse
[13:07] 23 which proves a person is born again
[13:10] by the seed of god the word of god a
[13:13] woman who denies the word of god
[13:15] that commands her to let her hair grow
[13:18] cannot be born again and so she does not
[13:20] have the seed or life of god in her soul
[13:23] her soul is lacking the seed or life of
[13:26] god's holy spirit
[13:28] being born again not of corruptible seed
[13:30] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[13:33] which liveth and abideth forever
[13:36] a woman's soul without the seed of god
[13:39] does not live as the scripture says
[13:41] therefore it is dead or dormant
[13:45] fourth revelation 9 verse 8 proves women
[13:47] who are lost and cut their hair
[13:50] have dead souls that are not born again
[13:52] for the fifth trumpet has a punishment
[13:54] upon those who take the mark of the
[13:56] beast
[13:57] they are tormented by devils with hair
[13:59] like women's hair
[14:01] which would be long and uncut according
[14:03] to first corinthians 11 verses 1-16
[14:07] it seems part of their torment will be
[14:09] for dishonoring god and his word and
[14:12] christ
[14:13] and their husbands for cutting their
[14:15] hair
[14:16] fifth
[14:17] there's a set of three more scriptures
[14:19] that teach the revelation brother
[14:20] branham called the anointed ones at the
[14:23] end times
[14:24] brother branham used jesus's words from
[14:26] matthew 5 verse 45
[14:28] matthew 7 verses 21 through 23 and
[14:31] matthew 24 verse 24 to show how many
[14:34] will be lost who did miracles and signs
[14:37] in jesus name yet later lived lies of
[14:40] iniquity and thereby were lost for hell
[14:44] this fits with brother branham's thus
[14:45] saith the lord quote about a woman
[14:47] cutting her hair being spiritually dead
[14:50] because brother branham said the woman
[14:51] could have the anointing of the spirit
[14:53] to do the works of god but later deny
[14:56] god in his truth selling her soul to the
[14:58] devil and being lost
[15:00] matthew 5 verse 45 says for he maketh
[15:04] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[15:06] good
[15:06] and sendeth rain on the just and the
[15:09] unjust
[15:10] this shows god sends the holy spirit on
[15:12] the just and the unjust
[15:15] so a person who is lost can obey parts
[15:17] of god's instruction and receive the
[15:20] anointing for a temporary purpose
[15:22] but then later they can reject that
[15:24] anointing and continue to live a life of
[15:26] iniquity
[15:28] matthew 7 verse 22 says many will say to
[15:30] me in that day lord lord have we not
[15:33] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[15:35] have cast out devils and in thy name
[15:37] have done many wonderful works
[15:39] and then i will profess unto them i
[15:41] never knew you depart from me ye that
[15:43] work iniquity
[15:45] notice jesus never denied that they did
[15:47] supernatural works by the power of the
[15:48] holy ghost
[15:50] but he pointed out that after those
[15:51] supernatural works they turned down
[15:54] jesus's anointing for a holy life and
[15:56] lived a life of iniquity or lawlessness
[16:00] matthew 24 verse 24
[16:02] for there shall arise false christs and
[16:05] false prophets
[16:06] and shall shew great signs and wonders
[16:08] in so much that if it were possible they
[16:11] shall deceive the very elect
[16:14] for a life-changing teaching on this
[16:15] subject please read or listen to brother
[16:18] branham's sermon from july 25 1965
[16:21] titled the anointed ones at the end time
[16:25] in closing
[16:26] i hope this video has been a blessing to
[16:28] you
[16:29] again this was a great question and i
[16:30] was grateful for the question and hope
[16:32] this answer is now fully backed up by
[16:34] scripture this question required a lot
[16:37] of understanding into one of the
[16:39] mysteries of god called christ in you
[16:41] the hope of glory or in other words the
[16:43] mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost
[16:46] this mystery could only be finished at
[16:47] the end time according to revelation 10
[16:49] verse 7 and was finished through the
[16:52] holy ghost
[16:53] teaching it to our prophet brother
[16:55] william branham
[16:56] we rejoice that the holy ghost can give
[16:58] us more scriptures to answer these more
[17:01] challenging questions
[17:02] but that's what the bible says the holy
[17:04] spirit searches the deep things yea the
[17:06] deep things of god
[17:08] that's according to first corinthians 2
[17:09] verse 10 but god hath revealed them unto
[17:12] us by spirit for the spirit searcheth
[17:14] all things yea the deep things of god as
[17:18] you probably know the bible also says if
[17:20] there's a deep call there has to be a
[17:21] deep to respond
[17:23] so friends with all these questions
[17:25] there's deep calls in people's hearts
[17:26] and souls to understand these things
[17:29] so there has to be a deep to respond and
[17:31] that's the holy spirit that will take us
[17:33] deeper in the word of god
[17:35] if you have any questions concerns or
[17:37] testimonies about this video please
[17:39] contact me
[17:40] [Music]
[17:42] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[17:44] the desire of your heart
