[0:00] so I sometimes look down as every
[0:04] Minister down the pathway that you have
[0:08] walked and wonder about the things that
[0:12] if you have sold the seed many of you
[0:16] well acquainted with Johnny apple seed
[0:19] and of America while there was also a
[0:23] man in Sweden that was considered
[0:26] something like that he sold flowers and
[0:28] they say that's why they have so many
[0:30] pretty flowers in Sweden now and because
[0:34] that they sewed the flow seeds
[0:36] everywhere he could find a piece of
[0:37] ground that seeds are growing he love
[0:39] flowers so he just strolled the seeds
[0:42] around he's gone on but his flowers
[0:44] still live and partings leave behind us
[0:49] footprints on the sands of time amen God
[0:53] footprints that perhaps another while
[0:55] sailing over life solemn man a forong
[1:00] and shipwreck brother in seeing shall
[1:02] take heart again and that's what we all
[1:05] like to see that's something that we
[1:08] have did that will cause others to to
[1:12] benefit by what we have done a few days
[1:15] ago I was sitting talking to my loyal
[1:19] little friend here in the city a medical
[1:21] doctor
[1:23] sadare and he said how you doing bill
[1:27] and I said oh pretty fair I suppose
[1:30] I said yourself and he said oh a lot of
[1:34] patients that have had 15 examinations
[1:36] this
[1:37] afternoon I said well that's good as
[1:40] long as it's this examinations and
[1:42] finding nothing
[1:43] wrong I said you know the we got talked
[1:47] about back when we were boys and I said
[1:50] well doc I don't know just how long I'm
[1:54] going to be around we're both in our 50s
[1:56] and he said that's true bill and I said
[2:00] but all these years about 31 years of
[2:03] ministry now I have kept my heart
[2:07] prepared for that hour when he comes so
[2:09] it doesn't matter when he comes amen so
[2:12] he said that is true I said the greatest
[2:14] thrill I have is living for others and
[2:18] he said that's what life is makes life
[2:21] real is when you not what you can do or
[2:24] accomplish for yourself but what you can
[2:27] do for others see amen that's when
[2:30] you're really living and if there
[2:33] happens to be someone Among Us who has
[2:35] never did that tried to live for
[2:38] somebody else give that a try and just
[2:41] see how much more life holds for you
[2:44] when you will not live for what you can
[2:47] get yourself out of life but what you
[2:49] can give someone else in life and you'll
[2:53] find that is more blessed than riches or
[2:56] anything of that can be the thought of
[3:00] is what you can do for someone else to
[3:04] make life's burdens which life in itself
[3:08] is a burden and it will make it a little
[3:11] lighter for someone else you just don't
[3:13] know the joy unless youve tried it once
[3:16] to do something for someone
[3:18] else
