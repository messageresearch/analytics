TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] It's too bad. I wish I had the means to let that boy go to school for an artist. I mean, God is an art. Don't you God is in music. God is an art. God is in this. And it's too bad to see a talent like that wouldn't be uh uh developed. More he does, the more developing it'll be. Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about college. The viewer asks, should a Christian go to college? So, by God's grace, the answer is a Christian should only go to college if the Lord leads the individual there. Each individual must find the perfect will of God for his or her life. So, I have four sections to this video here. The first section is the balance on education. So first of all, yes, most educators are sinners because Jesus said, "Few will find the narrow road." So most teachers or instructors or professors are sinners. And yes, most educational institutions push wicked woke ideologies which is of the devil. But at the same time, when you or I need a surgery or glasses or a veterinarian or any other service that requires a degree, a college degree of some sort, then we are thankful for their knowledge and expertise. Even yesterday, I took my daughter to the dentist and I was very thankful for his expertise to fix her tooth. And I want to also say, brother Brandham placed a big importance on the education of his children. I have a quote here from March 1963. God hiding himself in simplicity. And brother Ram said only he came back to Jeffersonville for the opening of the seven seals. Now consider that brother Ram's wife and children all missed the revelation of the seven seals which was the fulfillment of Revelation 10 1-7. his whole family missed the fulfillment of Revelation 10 1-7 because he was emphasizing the importance of education for his family. Let's listen to this quote. I'm bringing you this morning greetings from my wife and my children who long to be here at this time for this dedicational service and these a week of consecration to Christ. But the children are in school and it's hard to get away and they have about worn away from their homesick feeling for the house. But we will never wear away the feeling for your people. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you don't wear that away. Hallelujah. Amen. High polish worldly wisdom educated always misses him. Amen. Right now, I'm not here and there I know there's school teachers, two or three that I know of sitting in here and I'm not here to contradict school and education and try to support illiter. I'm not here for that. But what it is the people as so placed so much upon that until they're even in the seminaries and so forth, they're missing the very thing that God has put before them. Amen. Next, Brother Brandham said he wished a young man could go to art school to improve his art skills. This is from the sermon, the restoration of the bride tree, 1962. Jerry Stephy painted this beautiful picture of Brother Brandham, which I've seen. It's still hanging in Brother Brandham's office there at the Brandom Tabernacle. And Brother Brandham said, "It's too bad. I wish I had the means to let that boy go to school for an artist." And if I'm not mistaken, this young man was a teenager or perhaps young adult. And brother Bam wished he had the money to send him to an art school to better his talent. Let's listen to the quote. Brother Jerry Steppy painted that picture. God bless that boy. Hallelujah. That's very fine. Jerry, if you're here this morning, it's too bad. I wish I had the means to let that boy go to school for an artist. I believe God is an art. Don't you God is in music. God is an art. God is in this. And it's too bad to see a talent like that wouldn't be uh uh developed. More he does, the more developing it'll be. And I I pray that God will bless you, Jerry. And also remember friends, Daniel and his three friends were the most intelligent scientists in all of Babylon. They were yielding their gifts to God Almighty. Daniel 1:4 said, "They were well-favored, skillful in all wisdom, cunning in knowledge and understanding science." And they had the ability to teach the learning and tongue of the Chaldans. So the fact is we must all find our gifts and talents that are given to us by God Almighty and then use them for his glory. So that's the balance on education. Now let's look at how to find the will of God for one's life. The most important part for the will of God is to do the perfect will of God. Romans 12:1 and2 says just that we must get a transformed mind in order to find the perfect will of God for our life. We never want to take the permissive will of God. We want to take the perfect will of God. That's God's first word, God's first command on any situation. We saw Hezekiah took the permissive will of God by wanting a longer life. Balam took the permissive will of God by going down with Bao when he should not have because God's first word was don't go. God's first word to Hezekiah was set your house in order. You're going to die. But God gave both of them the permissive will of God. Remember friends, let's use the fear of the Lord to find the perfect will of God. Proverbs 3:7 and of course there's numerous other scriptures that say something similar. Fear the Lord and depart from evil. The perfect will of God will always take us away from evil, not into evil. But then the balance is with college is that you, at least in America, you can do online college where you don't even have to go live with a bunch of sinners or you can commute to campuses. You don't have to live with sinners on campus. And friends, even if there would be a case, let's say, where someone was forced to go to college perhaps by their parents or something, and they felt they were following God's will for their life, even living amongst sinners, a Christian can overcome. Again, just like Daniel and the three Hebrew children, it's not for everyone. I believe there are rare cases. But if God allowed Daniel and his three friends to go right into the heart of Babylon and overcome, well, surely we can overcome because greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world. And I'm not advocating for people to go into a sinful situation if they know it's wrong. Again, we're looking at the calling of God on people's lives, such as in the case of Daniel and his three Hebrew friends. Also, remember to find the will of God, you have to ask, seek, and knock and cry aloud out to God. And then God will reveal his perfect will to you. Proverbs 2:es 3-6 say, "You have to cry after God's knowledge. Lift up your voice for understanding. You got to get alone with God. Cry out to God from the depths of your soul. You got to seek for the truth. You have to search for God's perfect will. And then you understand the fear of the Lord. Proverbs 2:5 and find the knowledge or the will of God. Matthew 7 7 and 8 of course say, "Ask and it shall be given unto you. Seek and you shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you." And then you have the promise. While you pray, you can have that promise. I know God's going to answer me because everyone that asks receives. According to Matthew 7:8, he that seeks finds and when people knock, it shall be open. You can say, Lord, that's your promise. You're going to open it to me. That's thus sayith the scripture. So the third point is that the predestination of God or God's sovereignty gives us peace. Brother Ram tells us this in the sermon, Come Follow Me, Tucson, Arizona, June 1st, 1963. Brother man was saying he wished he could have kept his kids out of the high schools and he wished he could have sent them up into an Indian reservation or he called him an Indian camp. He wished they didn't have to go to the high schools. They could have just went up to some quiet Indian reservation where there was no people. But then brother Random goes to the sovereignty of God. Brother Ram's mind goes back to the plan of God for their life, the predestination of the seed that's inside of every believer. Brother Ram said, "But here is what it is. What's in the kid is going to come out. No matter where it is, it's got to come out. So, Brother Ram says, "The seed in the individual will come out. No matter if they're in a sinful high school or if they're up in an Indian camp, in a reservation with nature supposedly closer to God, whatever's in the individual is going to come out." Let's listen to the quote. and a father and mother with the praying constantly that that their son would not turn out just an ordinary man that he'd be an extraordinary man. All parents want that. Did you hear Jesus refer to that commandment? Honor the father and mother and stop. And that's the ambition of any parent to do the best for their children they can educate them give them things maybe that they wasn't able to get. That's the way I feel about my children. I think sometime in going to school now. I think send Becky and Sarah and Joseph into these high schools and things where all this go on's at. I think I'll take them and get back into the mountain and and raise them up there at the like the Indians live. But here's what it is. What's in the kids going to come out and no matter where it is, it's got it's going to come out. If it's evil in there, it'll come out in the Indian camp. is good in there, it'll come out in any camp. See, it's what's in the kid, the makeup of the kid, what's on the inside of you. And what you are now is what you're probably be the rest of your life. You're on a changing spot. Do you know what? 86% of the conversions to Jesus Christ is done before 21 years old. Shows the statistic shows it. 86% that come to Christ come before they're 21. you be if you pass that age you become more molded or set in your ways. Well, it's possible surely they come 70 80 years old but it's very rare that you make yourself when you're young. You set your ambitions to what you want to do and what you're trying to achieve in life. You think of it and as you think of course your mind it's presented into your mind by an unknown something and it it dominates your mind and then when it becomes in your mind then you speak it that you're going to do it and then your ambitions drive you to it. And the final section is just my personal testimony. Some of you know I'm a public school teacher. I've taught elementary education now for 21 years. When I first went to college in 1999, I was not a Christian. I was running from the Lord. And then I got saved in January 2000, my first year of college. The message came to me almost two years later in November 2001. But even when I got saved, even in a denomination in January 2000, I instantly threw away all my worldly music. I was sold out to Jesus. I was doing my best and I was able to overcome almost all the temptations there in my dorm during my freshman year surrounded by sinners with a sinful roommate that would bring his girlfriend into the room and I was able to overcome and live above sin even as a denominational Christian by the grace of God reading my Bible every day going to church faithfully. But then when the message came to me, I was already moved out my second year in college. I was moved out of the dorms into a house with other Christian athletes, soccer players, football players. Of course, they're denominational. But when I received the message, God gave me the grace to live higher and live above the denominational teachings. I just stayed away from the TV. I tried to spend as much time at the library or with the saints from the message churches that I possibly could. Twice during the week, Thursday night, of course, and Sunday when we had our meetings throughout the week by the grace of God. And I didn't feel led to quit college when the message came to me in November 2001. I felt to continue going on and I'm very thankful I did. Now, because I'm a school teacher these 21 years, I get more time with my family. I get more holidays off. I get the summers off. We have great insurance for my eight and almost nine children. And I can pastor a church and work full-time as an educator. I can do both by the grace of God. And I've had numerous families over the years from the school where I work tell me that I was an answer to their prayers for their children. So I just take that as a sign that I've done God's perfect will for my life. I've only wanted to do God's perfect will. I've never wanted to do just my will. And also for the past 10 years or so, a friend and I have been able to teach Bible club either after school or before school. So for the last 10 years, we've taught about Jesus. We've worshiped Jesus. We've danced in the classroom. We've prayed together. We've prayed for kids with cancer. We prayed for teachers with cancer. In other words, we've turned those classrooms into sanctuaries by the grace of God. So, that's just a brief summary of my testimony in education. And I've had to get, of course, a master's degree. And now I'm at over 40 credits beyond a master's degree. And now I can really slow down with the number of courses I have to take. Now, it's only about a couple courses every 5 years I have to take. And so the load of work has definitely decreased. So I'm thankful for that by the grace of God. But another benefit of being in education is that I was able to write two books. The Restoring Christian Modesty and the 12 New Testament mysteries. In fact, the first book, Restoring Christian Modesty, a lot of those sources about how modesty had changed in the United States came from books that I found while I was in college. In fact, the book, What Americans Wore, was a book one of my instructors held up. And I knew at that moment that's the very reason I'm in this college and in this course was to get the truth about how modesty had been forsaken by Americans, but how God wanted to restore it in the bride of Jesus Christ. That's a wonderful part of my testimony. I knew God had placed me there for a time and season. And so I rejoice in the plan of God for my life. In closing, friends, if you have any questions or concerns about this video, please contact me. I know I could have done a lot more quotes on this topic. Undoubtedly, there's lots of quotes that I didn't use on this topic. So, perhaps I can do a part two, but I just want to get a video out on this topic to answer the dear person's question by the grace of God. Friends, for your life, seek God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. Love God with everything you have. And if you ask, you'll receive. If you seek, you'll find. If you knock, surely the Lord will open his will unto you. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He never failed. [Music]
