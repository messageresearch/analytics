TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 5 the mystery of godliness restored to man mystery 5 of 12 chapter 5 contains footnotes numbers 553-803 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory first timothy 3 16. godliness is a precious mysterious yet obtainable level of christian character that few worshipers reach like paul you are one of the true worshipers seeking to press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus in the greek godliness means reverence respect piety towards god other words that help explain its meaning are loyal faithful devoted and dutiful you can also say godliness is being like god what a glorious invitation god is offering you a chance to be like him you might be thinking i can't be like god but be encouraged for jesus says you can our lord says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect godliness is a state of loyalty all true christians desire based upon jesus's invitation if jesus asks us to be perfect or complete he has to make a way for us to achieve that condition he has and this chapter reveals christ's process to our godliness in the epigraph above paul declares the mystery of godliness in context of jesus's life god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world and received up into glory in other words jesus's earthly life manifested true godliness as the epitome of godliness in stark contrast is satan the epitome of iniquity see chapter 10. you see the true expression of godliness as you read about jesus christ in the four gospels because he lived by every word of god jesus is god's manifestation of his own character in a flesh body to understand godliness you need only look to jesus christ's behavior jesus manifested godly character by constantly increasing his wisdom godliness is attained through a slow steady growth even at 12 years old jesus's heart was burdened with doing his father's business scripture records that jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man godliness was mysteriously manifested in the life of christ as he daily increased his devotion and loyalty to god the father as always his life is the guidance for understanding our lives the confusion about the mystery of godliness the confusion about godliness centers around human effort and its attainability is human effort required to reach godliness if so how much effort is needed can godliness even be attained if churches teach human effort is required some will instantly accuse them of legalism and works-based salvation the age-old works or faith debate is revived as you study godliness but god's word settles his debate once and for all as god's revelation on godliness unfolds in this chapter the revelation of the mystery of godliness is that god uses works of grace to incrementally anoint christians with measures of christ's own godly character as they lovingly yield all their human strength biblical evidence for the revelation of godliness jesus eliminates all confusion about obtaining godliness through his teaching about the two greatest commandments in matthew 22 verses 37-39 jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself human effort is required to reach godliness and its motivation is love in fact jesus says you must use all your human effort or strength in a parallel passage in the gospel of mark and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment all your human effort and strength is required to manifest godliness if absolutely no human effort or action is required for salvation then all sinners will be saved it's ridiculous to think judas is scared whom jesus said was lost in john 17 verse 12 and the rich man literally in hell in luke 16 23 will be saved the reason they are lost is because they refused god's love into their souls a choice necessary for salvation humans must do something for salvation and it is belief surprising to some all human actions are based upon love whether the person is a sinner or saint sinners are lost and go to hell because they love the pleasures of the world love for unbelief motivates their human effort jesus says in john 3 verse 19 and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil paul echoes this truth by teaching sinners are traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god paul never said these sinners didn't love god their fatal problem was that they loved the world more than they loved god jesus silences the legalism accusation legalism is defined as excessive adherence to law or formula meaning legalism is an addition to the word of god scripture condemns anyone who adds to god's word in proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 and revelation 22 verses 18 and 19. an obvious bible example of legalism is paul encountering legalistic jewish teachers who were requiring circumcision for salvation which he condemned as a fall from grace jesus never asked us to do anything outside the bible's commands rather he empowers our human effort to do all his commands by his love which is shed in our hearts and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us obeying god with all your love and human strength is attainable through a self-crucifixion of your sinful human will jesus declares in luke 14 27 and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple jesus's true disciples follow his commands through a daily death to selfishness this is the only way to live in the holy spirit as romans 8 13 says for if we live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live paul again writes mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concuptions and covetousness which is idolatry for which things say the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience paul experienced this daily self-crucifixion personally saying i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily scripture teaches you yield your will and human strength to one of two masters jesus says you cannot serve both god and mammon meaning riches in luke 16 13 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon which master do you love more god or riches paul says you'll either yield to sin or god in romans 6 13. neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god if you yield to god with all your strength you'll achieve godliness two types of godliness scripture differentiates two types of godliness one is an initial level of devotion you receive as you approach your spiritual birth or before you are born again through the baptism of the holy ghost this measure or portion of godliness is the sixth character trait god adds to your being after he saved your soul through the substance of faith the second type of godliness is a mature rare spiritual state of devotion a believer manifests after he is born again chapter 6 gives a full teaching on the born-again experience the baptism of the holy ghost this mature godliness is the mystery of godliness seen in jesus's life as he fully and constantly obeyed the father the fact that there are two types of godliness gives this subject its mysterious nature it is no different from the mystery of two kinds of fillings of god's spirit one in your mind and another in your soul see chapter six often when something seems confusing in scripture god is hiding in mystery behind it urging you to dig deeper in search of revelation paul and peter repeatedly mention the mature state of godliness paul's instructions to timothy a preacher are to exercise himself unto godliness as he follows after godliness in paul's mind christians are actively seeking to display all godliness peter echoes the same saying christians ought to be dedicated persons in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat both apostles are pointing us to mature godliness like christ's who says he does nothing of himself but what he see the father do jesus did only what his father told him to do you are approaching mature godliness when your daily actions are only those that god leads you to do christ spoke only the words his father gave him as evidenced in john 8 38 i speak that which i have seen with my father more on paul's teaching about mature godliness the apostle paul provides five texts the most of any new testament author about the mature state of godliness that help us understand its meaning and application to our lives beginning in titus 1 verses 1 and 2 paul says he is a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness christians acknowledge the truth is after or according to godliness recognizing the one and only true religion christianity promotes godliness paul a former hebrew of the hebrews a zealous pharisee and law keeper assures all christians that their faith follows godliness in the second text of 1st timothy 2 verses 1 through 3 paul says it's good and acceptable in the sight of god when christians lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty in context paul encourages christians to pray for all men including our government officials notice that all godliness is attainable and pleases our lord christians do not settle for partial godliness they set their sights on accomplishing complete godliness the third text first timothy 4 verses 7 and 8 follows paul's identification of jesus's life as the mysterious godliness first timothy 3 16 and then says christians obtain godliness through the imagery of spiritual exercise just as physical exercise helps you reach healthiness paul says vigorous spiritual exercise helps you reach godliness paul rebukes heavily exercising our minds in fiction or listening to profane and old wives fables the apostle says exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come in the greek lexicon exercise means to exercise vigorously in any way either the body or the mind your mind exercises by repeatedly meditating on things that are true honest just pure lovely virtuous and praiseworthy paul says you must set your affections on things above and the final result will be your spiritual transformation in first timothy 6 verses 3 through 12 paul's fourth and most thorough teaching on godliness mentions godliness four times he begins by affirming that the doctrine of jesus christ is according to godliness and warns of false teachers who suppose financial gain is a sign of godliness paul urges you to withdraw from the prosperity gospel and its preachers god does not promise riches to the godly true christians seek spiritual prosperity not financial prosperity rivers of truth flow from paul's pen as he describes our fight to be both godly and content but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be there with content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which draw men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have heard from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses always remember that you are fighting to obtain mature godliness while simultaneously remaining content with worldly possessions in his final letter before his martyrdom paul teaches again on godliness in second timothy 3 verses 1-17 while prophesying he warns believers about the perilous or dangerous spiritual conditions in the last days paul lists 18 sinful attributes including covetousness pride unthankfulness and being boastful men will exhibit while maintaining a form of godliness in the greek lexicon form means shaping the mere form semblance how deceptive satan is for he enslaves the masses into a hollow or false godliness by training them to love sin more than god no doubt men and women faithfully attend and give some money to churches some spend time in bible devotions and yet do not attain true godliness this happened in jesus day as the holy spirit instantly brings to mind the pharisees form of godliness jesus said they were beautiful in outward appearance yet full of extortion excess hypocrisy and iniquity pharisees were devoid of true godliness yet faithfully attended and prayed publicly in the temple and were devout donors you glean that genuine godliness comes from a pure heart that loves god far more than worldly pleasures in your lifetime these last days your warned false hollow godliness will wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived you can obtain true godliness by living selflessly and continuing in the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus peter steps to initial godliness here is where you focus on the other type of godliness the initial anointing of godliness before you are born again christ anoints peter to reveal the exact steps god uses to help believers obtain an initial measure of godliness in second peter 1 verses 1 through 15. god gives 8 spiritual portions of character to believers as they mature in christianity with godliness being the sixth measure it is striking to discover that jesus gave peter both the keys to the kingdom of heaven and the steps for godliness the book of acts records how peter took the keys or power and authority to unlock the door to the promise of the father the born-again experience each of the eight steps involves god adding a portion or measure of his divine nature to a christian spiritual character notice the word measure the idea of god giving us eight spiritual measures of his nature comes from romans 12 3 for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith paul teaches god gives every man a measure or portion of faith recall from the previous figure that faith is the first character quality given to believers for by grace are ye saved through faith as you will learn faith is the beginning point of your relationship with almighty god peter uses the exact word add which means to supply furnish present to describe how man receives the eight christ-like character qualities how marvelous is the truth that you can have christ's own mentality or disposition the faithful god supplies you with the necessary spiritual portion during each step of your christian journey god the father did the same for jesus as luke 2 verse 52 records and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man god increased or added to jesus's character as he grew combining peter's text with a similar text about becoming a complete mature christian in ephesians 4 verses 8 through 24 this 8 step spiritual building process can be called the stature of a perfect man in the greek stature means maturity these steps show you how you become a mature living dwelling place of the living god for your body is a temple of the holy ghost first corinthians 6 verses 19 and 20 declares what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods ephesians 4 verses 8 through 24 emphasizes five preaching gifts god uses to impart the eight character qualities in the stature of a perfect man apostle prophet evangelist pastor and teacher once jesus ascended to heaven to sit at the right hand of his father these five gifts are what he gave unto men for the perfecting of the saints till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ it shouldn't surprise you that preaching brings complete maturity to christians because it is preaching that initially brings you to salvation the bible says it please god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe how comforting to know that the same method christians are saved by will also be used to impart further christlike character in our earthly journey god will always use preaching to increase our maturity so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god faithful preachers are used by god to impart the following benefits perfecting of the saints work of the ministry edifying of the body of christ unity of faith and knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man maturity and doctrinal stability character quality is a spiritual crossroad on a believer's journey just as israel made an exodus out of egypt following every move of the pillar of fire christians leave a sinful life while following every leading of the holy ghost believers must decide whether to continue growing in god's word by walking in obedience to his commands or reject his leadership the next figure shows why believers must accept the character qualities from god at each crossroad or stage of their christian journey and why they must reject satan's bait just as god told moses life and death is set before every believer good and evil were said before adam and eve you must either accept or reject god's gifts in every season of life faith is the first character quality you must accept and you must reject unbelief because faith is the substance needed to choose god's way virtue is the second character quality you must accept and you must reject hypocrisy because virtue is the strength needed to daily walk god's way the third character quality is knowledge you must accept and you must reject human reasoning because knowledge is the understanding needed to know why you walk in all god's ways the fourth character quality you must accept is temperance while you reject sensuality because temperance is the self-control needed to remain on god's way fifth you must accept the character quality of patience and you must reject haste because patience is the steadfastness needed to be content on god's way sixth you must accept godliness and reject irreverence because godliness is the devotion needed to be just like god on god's way seventh you must accept broadly kindness and reject selfishness because brotherly kindness is the selflessness needed to live for your christian family on god's way eighth you must accept charity and reject resistance because charity is god's abiding loving presence needed to completely manifest the will of god for your life character quality number one faith faith is the foundational character quality hebrews 11 verse 1 defines faith as the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen additionally hebrews 11 verse 6 says without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is rewarder of them that diligently seek him faith is the first and most necessary character quality needed to please god faith is a gift from god salvation is indeed a gift to all who will receive it as ephesians 2 verse 8 says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast faith is not earned by human effort rather it is freely given paul writes in romans 8 32 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things second peter 1 3 says according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue jesus says few will accept saving faith so choose to be one of the few who accept this eternal gift a christian spiritual journey begins with faith before faith comes a person is lost in unbelief or spiritually dead ephesians 2 verse 1 says unbelievers are dead in sin and trespasses believing in jesus christ as savior brings spiritual life as jesus says believers pass from death unto life faith comes when a person rejects unbelief repents from his sins and trust in christ for forgiveness in the greek repent means to change one's mind for better heartily to amend with abhorrence of one's past sins scripture calls this change of mind a turning of the heart john the baptist's preaching was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and their disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord similarly paul's preaching would open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me both john the baptist and jesus christ preached repentance and remission of sins as the starting place for serving god mark 1 verse 4 says john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins then mark 1 verses 14 and 15 says now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel jesus instructs us to believe the gospel or good news that we can be forgiven all our sins and become part of god's kingdom christ says i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance at the moment a person is saved through repentance he receives life the spiritual substance of faith in his soul first thessalonians 5 23 teaches every man has three parts to his being body human spirit and soul this faith substance is a small but powerful anointing of the holy ghost in the soul faith in the soul is likened unto a seed in a seed packet the seed is not yet growing but life is inside it and it has so much potential the new believer feels new life upon receiving faith prior to faith coming he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience in other words he used to be anointed by and obedient to demonic spirits or death but now he's anointed with a measure of life god's spirit the substance of faith zacchaeus and the woman at simon's house are examples of scripture capturing the very moment believers pass from death to life once faith entered his soul zacchaeus vowed to restore all he'd stolen jesus identified that day as his day of salvation saying this day is salvation come to this house for as much as he also is a son of abraham for the son of man is come to seek and save that which was lost you can know the very day salvation comes to your heart galatians 3 verse 7 supports jesus declaration of zacchaeus as the son of abraham saying know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham at simon the pharisees house a sincere repentant woman called a sinner found salvation through christ as she washed jesus feet with her tears her faith moved her to wash and anoint jesus's feet and through her faith she was saved our lord first pronounced her forgiveness and then said thy faith has saved thee go in peace new testament believers are immediately baptized or fully immersed in water as a public testimony of their new life or faith in christ jesus in acts 8 verses 26 through 40 the ethiopian eunuch stopped his chariot in the middle of his travels home so philip could immediately baptize him in water moments after his heart turned believing in christ as messiah at paul's miraculous turn to faith the scales fell from his eyes and he was immediately baptized jesus purpose for paul was to help others experience the same turn to faith that he had experienced paul's life is a striking example of turning from death to life the man who once jailed christians and consented to stephen's death because he was a christian is now sent to preach freedom liberty and the newness of life through jesus christ furthermore the beginning of the book of acts illustrates in depth how beautifully faith comes to new christians acts chapter 2 demonstrates how 000 new christians were baptized after receiving god's gift of faith the day of pentecost begins with 120 believers being filled with the holy spirit early in the morning in a private upper room setting their joyful loud and exuberant worship could not be contained in the upper room and flowed into the streets of jerusalem becoming a 9 am worship service seeing it is but the third hour of the day their holy ghost baptism experience gets noised abroad jerusalem causing a multitude to gather around them some mock their worship calling them drunk peter freshly anointed with the holy spirit stands up and preaches the gospel with a loud voice beginning his sermon by identifying the scripture the christians are fulfilling joel 2 verses 28 through 32 peter says his group has not received new wine but the spirit of the living god his next point is to indict the multitudes wicked act of delivering christ the god-approved miracle worker to be crucified peter continues by quoting psalm 16 verses 8 through 11 proving that jesus is the foreknown holy one or messiah god would raise from the dead and david was not speaking of himself the apostle declares himself to be a witness of jesus's resurrection and the events of the morning to be the fulfillment of the heavenly father's promise of the holy ghost the sermon is concluded by peter's declaration to the house of israel that god hath made that same jesus whom you have crucified both lord and christ stop and recognize that peter had to preach both bad news and good news the bad news was the followers of judaism were guilty of letting their innocent messiah be crucified by wicked men peter indicted israel for rejecting their own savior the good news was jesus defeated death resurrected to heaven at the right hand of god and was now pouring out his promised spirit upon believers the bad news convicted the 17 nation multitude for they were pricked in their heart or sorrowful agitated and pained in the mind according to the greek lexicon bad news really hurts but can cause hearts to seek deliverance the multitude's humble response to peter's sermon was men and brethren what shall we do the walking on water apostle delivers what may be called the true church's first and only creed recorded in acts 2 verses 38-39 preaching repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call observe that faith comes after god's word convicts guilty sinners who admit and turn from their hopeless wickedness called repentance desiring to trust in jesus christ for complete forgiveness this pattern for receiving faith worked two thousand years ago and still works today if you haven't repented and been baptized in the name of jesus christ for your remission of sins with the accompanying gift of the baptism of the holy ghost won't you seek this eternal blessing today love produces faith then faith produces works another of jesus's comments to the sinner woman at simon's house unveils the origin and order of all works love faith works notice jesus's words to the forgiven woman in luke 7 verse 47 her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little clearly this woman's love for jesus moved her to do the work of washing and anointing his feet love is the only motivation god accepts for all christian acts or works paul says love comes before faith and works because faith worketh by love the forgiven woman first loved jesus christ which helped her receive faith in christ her faith and went to work causing her to wash and anoint jesus's feet figure 7 shows the order of all christian works through this woman's example love is the first christian work in her sinful state the woman somehow learned of jesus and deeply fell in love with him and his godly character perhaps she saw him preach and perform miracles maybe she saw jesus disciples baptizing new believers after jesus forgave them one thing is certain jesus said for she loved much the second step is faith she had faith she could be forgiven of her many sins she saw herself as a sin debtor which is how jesus described her condition her faith in christ move her to prepare to do the work of washing and anointing jesus she brought an alabaster box of ointment to simon's house and waited for the right moment to begin washing his feet paul said faith worketh by love the third step in all christian works is works the woman worked by letting her tears wash jesus's feet using her hair as a towel to clean his dirty feet she then kissed his feet and anointed them with ointment after jesus saw her love empower her faith and her faith manifest a good work upon him he said thy faith hath saved thee jesus always sees works as faith in action like the men who let down the palsy stricken man through the roof tiles in luke 5 verses 17-26 luke says and when he jesus saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee christians are not saved by works according to ephesians 2 verse 8 but once saved christians recognize god created them to do good works according to paul in ephesians 2 verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them the forgiven woman was created to wash jesus's feet at simon's house and therefore walked in god's plans for her life before she could do that she had to fall in love with jesus once full of love for him her faith went to work the age-old faith versus works debate is now made plain you are saved by god's amazing grace your experience begins when your heart begins to love god this love produces faith in his eternal word faith motivated by love works out god's plan for your life genuine works of obedience always originate with a loving heart that brings faith into the soul justification by faith at the moment a believer is saved by grace through faith he is justified in the sight of god paul devotes significant time to solidifying god's promise to justify believers in romans chapters three through five and galatians chapters two and three in the greek lexicon justification means to show one to be righteous and to declare one to be just when you stand before the judgment seat of christ paul says we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ you desperately want him to declare you righteous not unrighteous just as you'd want an earthly judge to declare you righteous in court you want heaven's judge to justify you before the throne of god romans 3 explains how sinful men and women can be righteous and just in god's sight but paul begins romans 3 verses 10 through 12 by explaining mankind's hopeless situation apart from christ saying there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one in romans 3 verses 19 through 31 paul says all the world is guilty before god for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god and unable to be justified by human efforts to keep god's law through christ's blood there is a righteousness of god without the law god is offering to all the righteousness of god is unto all and upon all them that believe by god's own design genuine belief or trust in christ's sacrifice is all that is required for salvation being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus whom god has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what law or works nay but by the law of faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law the just one christ justifies all who believe in him jesus declares his righteousness for the remission of our sins no man can brag about his own righteousness because he has none romans 4 verse 3 explains that christians are justified in the same way abraham was he simply believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness god counts your simple humble faith as righteousness romans 4 verse 5 says but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness god's spirit anointed david to describe this amazing promise one thousand years before christ even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin and all these indescribable blessings flow from the cross and resurrection for christ was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification in romans 5 verses 1 and 2 paul states therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god again observe how god's grace brings you to the state of justification by believing in christ's blood you have peace with god one greek meaning of peace is exemption from the rage and havoc of war god is not angry with believers he's not enraged at their sins nor warn against their every decision the heavenly father patiently chastens believers like a father pities his children indeed every justified christian has no charges nor accusations against them before god's throne for paul declares who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth jesus christ has entered into heaven itself now to appear in the prince of god for us and he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them galatians chapters 2 and 3 address justification by faith saying no flesh can be justified by the law in the sight of god justification is by faith for both jew and gentile being foretold for gentiles in genesis 12 3 and habakkuk 2 verse 4 god promised to bless all nations through abraham saying and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed over 600 years before christ the prophet habakkuk wrote god's vision that the just shall live by his faith the law of moses served as a school master or tutor to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith some say james 2 verse 24 causes confusion in the faith versus works debate but those accusations are wrong this verse states ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only some argue that faith alone is not enough to save a sinner because james writes a man is justified by works and not by faith only reading james chapter 2 in context reveals that james is rebuking dead faith meaning a faith confession that honors god with words only empty words without action reveal an absence of faith james is correct to denounce false professors of faith who spurt out empty vain words his example is a person who gives verbal well wishes to a cold hungry christian but does not give him clothes and food a real faith-filled christian will give a cold hungry christian those things which are needful to the body when understood correctly james's words agree with paul's for genuine faith works by love doing the good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them intellectual human faith every human being possesses an intellectual human faith that is different from god's gift of divine saving faith god's saving faith is part of the divine nature the same faith jesus christ possesses christ's faith is added to a christian as a gift just as peter said each character quality must be added to the believer add to your faith virtue paul said he lived by christ's supernatural faith not his own faith galatians 2 verse 20 says i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me paul had received god's gift of supernatural saving faith a measure of jesus's own faith the faith of the son of god human faith that simply acknowledges truth is not saving faith as proven in hebrews 10 verses 26 and 27 for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries many jews acknowledge jesus as a special messenger from god in jesus's lifetime nicodemus admitted that the sanhedrin council's members knew jesus was from god telling jesus in john 3 verse 2 rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him just as muslims believe jesus christ is a prophet with human faith the israeli sanhedrin council knew and believed with human faith that jesus was from god but human faith is not sufficient for salvation repentance from sin while trusting in the blood of jesus christ for forgiveness is god's requirement for salvation muslims and other world religions can possess the knowledge of the truth that jesus is the christ and still not be saved fallen angels like humans can genuinely believe in god and still exist in complete rebellion to him james 2 verse 19 states that all fallen angels or devils believe in and tremble at the one god thou believers that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble angels have the intellectual capacity to believe in christ while trying to work against him but must obey his every command luke 4 verse 34 records an unclean devil crying out to jesus saying i know thee who thou art the holy one of god. the destiny of all fallen angels is judgment unto annihilation for jude 1 verse 6 says and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved an everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day the gift of faith there are two other kinds of faith that must be differentiated from saving faith the gift of faith and the fruit of faith the gift of faith is one of the nine spiritual gifts paul describes in first corinthians chapter 12 verses 1-11 see figure 8 in the greek a gift or charisma is a favor with which one receives without any merit of his own and grace or gifts denoting extraordinary powers distinguishing certain christians and enabling them to serve the church of christ figure eight the nine spiritual gifts of the holy ghost wisdom knowledge faith healing miracles prophecy discerning of spirits diverse kinds of tongues interpretation of tongues the bible describes the gift of faith as power to move obstacles figuratively described as mountains by speaking god's word according to mark 11 23 and 1st corinthians 13 verse 2. two clear bible examples of mountain moving faith include the roman centurion and paul in matthew 8 verses 1 through 13 a roman centurion came to christ for the healing of a sick servant who suffered from paralysis jesus agreed to come to his house and heal the servant but the centurion said he needed to speak the word only for the servant to be healed jesus marveled at the centurion's great faith and said as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee the centurion's great faith in christ spoken from his anointed heart to christ caused the savior to speak the word moving the mountain of paralysis in the selfsame hour while in lystra modern-day turkey paul's gift of faith operated on a crippled man who had never walked acts 14 verse 8 says the crippled man was impotent in his feet but heard paul speaking the holy spirit anointed paul to perceive the had faith to be healed so he said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked how could paul loudly command a man to walk who had never walked through the mountain moving gift of faith in this case the mountain of impotent feet was moved by speaking god's word in faith the gift of faith is different from saving faith because the gift is always present in a person's human spirit from birth figure 9 shows face location in relation to man's three parts on the other hand saving faith only comes upon a believer after genuine repentance from sins god graces every christian and surprisingly even every unbeliever with at least one of these nine spiritual gifts for paul says the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all and all these worketh that one and self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will some saints have multiple gifts like paul who prophesied had gifts of healing and spoken tongues figure 9 man's three-part being based upon first thessalonians 5 verse 23 the human body contains the sinful nature according to romans 7 verses 18 through 23. the human spirit or mind receives the anointings and portions of faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness broadly kindness the human soul receives charity or the seal of the holy ghost gifts are given to every person as romans 11 verse 29 teaches the gifts and calling of god are without repentance even before a believer repents god has already given him a spiritual gift conversely even if an unbeliever will not repent god has already given him a spiritual gift every spiritual gift is a built-in component and special ability in each person's human spirit gifts can be likened unto the talents that jesus graciously distributes detailed in matthew 25 verses 14 through 30. christians are accountable for investing in their valuable divine abilities like faith given them by jesus although shocking to some six bible texts validate unbelievers possessing gifts of the spirit despite lacking saving faith first second peters 2 verses 15-17 teaches balaam's destiny was hell the mist of darkness forever yet he had a gift of prophecy that correctly predicted a star out of jacob would lead the wise men to christ second matthew 10 verses 1 through 15 explains how judas iscariot eventually lost to hell as the son of perdition and the 11 other apostles were given gifts of healing when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease next luke 10 verses 1 1-20 describes jesus's 70 disciples he sent out to cities with power to cast out devils the gift of miracles according to mark 9 verses 38 and 39 john 6 66 suggests these 70 left christ because his preaching was offensive to them saying from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him the reality of jesus's gifts of healing and miracles was not enough to keep these disciples following christ they walked away from eternal life christ because they were offended by his preaching matthew 7 verses 21-23 provides a fourth example jesus sends workers of iniquity to hell because he never knew them and they failed to do the will of god the large lost group of many people also did many wonderful works in jesus name such as prophesying and casting out devils jesus warned us of these false christs and false prophets in matthew 24 24 who temporarily have the anointing of god upon them but live sinfully after operating god's gifts it's crucial christians do not make the ability to repeatedly and correctly operate god's gifts as the evidence of a person's salvation whether the gift is speaking in tongues or performing miracles fifth hebrews 6 verses 1 through 12 describes a group who tastes of heavenly gifts and powers but are still lost after initially enjoying god's gifts they become spiritually slothful and fall away unwilling to repent this group treats christ to an open shame or public disgrace by their sinful lives crucifying jesus afresh god's word again uses botany life jesus used wheat and tares in matthew 13 to help readers understand the lost comparing their lives to thorn producing plants the lost produced thorns and briars rather than the holy righteous fruits of the holy spirit finally a sixth example is found in first corinthians 13 verses 1-3 which specifically mentions the gift of faith saying and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing you learn that faith is a powerful gift that removes mountains or imposing obstacles but you also understand that exercising the gift of faith without god's love equals spiritual bankruptcy love is the only true and acceptable motivation for trying to do god a service because love empowers faith and living faith produces works the fruit of faith there are nine fruits of the holy spirit taught by paul in galatians 5 verses 16 through 23 and seen in figure 10. the nine fruits of the spirit are love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance the apostle lists 17 sinful works of the flesh to contrast the nine divine fruits faith is the seventh fruit on the list the fruit of faith is the rarest form of faith because it's only manifested in mature seasoned christians anyone sinner or saint can manifest a gift of faith saving faith is more rare than the gift of faith being only present in the few believers jesus said would find the narrow path to eternal life understanding the fruit of the holy spirit comes from examining natural fruit from the earth a ripe apple a natural fruit is the product of an apple seed it takes from six to eight years for the apple seed to grow and mature before it produces substantial fruit spiritual fruit then is a product of the seed word of god according to first peter 1 verse 23 being born again not of the corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever peter symbolizes being born again or the new birth as receiving an incorruptible seed producing fruits of the spirit years later in due time jesus teaches a parable about being patient for fruit to be produced in luke 13 verses 6 through 9 christ's parable tells of a certain man who plants a fig tree in his vineyard but the tree produces no fruit after three years the vine dresser suggests the certain man cut down the fig tree but the merciful patient man decides to leave it alone for another year and fertilize the tree in hopes of fruit in the fourth year christ seems to be symbolizing israel as the fig tree and himself as the certain man because christ's earthly ministry lasted about three and a half years but christians can glean jesus's patience to wait for believers to manifest the fruit of the spirit as paul stresses patience with all men in 1st thessalonians 5 verses 14 and 15. now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men there is no set amount of time christians must wait to see maturity in each other but fruits of the spirit must and will manifest in all born-again christians spiritual fruit of faith is a mature level of faith fully developed fruit is the goal of christianity as proven by john 15 verses 1 to 16 and matthew 13 verses 3 through 8 and verses 18-23 in john 15 christ paints a picture of god the father as a husbandman or farmer himself as the true vine and believers as branches jesus promises that branches who abide in him being kept clean through his word will glorify the father through much fruit bearing pruning is required for all branches as the faithful savior will take away parts of our character that do not produce the fruit of the spirit polishers christians are chosen and ordained to bear fruit that lasts matthew 13 records jesus's teaching that every human heart will culminate in one of four conditions and the only honorable condition is a fruitful heart see chapter 8 luke 8 15 a parallel passage describes the fruitful heart as the good ground which is an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience john and paul are key examples of mature experienced believers whose faith fruit had fully developed converted to christianity around 34 a.d paul faithfully served god's purpose until his martyrdom in rome in 66 a.d throughout his ministry paul's faith was tested severely by being stoned shipwrecked three times whipped five times beaten with rods suffering frequent imprisonments and countless perils even so paul's faith knew death had lost its sting because of christ's victorious resurrection and a crown of righteousness from the righteous judge was laid up for him after death after 32 years of ministry the apostle was ready to die as a martyr writing for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith the apostle john the disciple whom jesus loved followed christ during his three and a half year earthly ministry and was born again on the day of pentecost in 30 a.d john's ministry lasted over 60 years writing three epistles first second and third john and his gospel around 80 a.d before recording the book of revelation in 95 a.d john's epistles strengthened the saints faith by making their joyful encouraging abstinence from sin stressing avoidance of seducing teachers and assuring their possession of eternal life through belief in christ the gospel of saint john emphasizes the deity divine power and pre-existence of jesus christ as foundational in the christian faith john's mature fully developed faith is powerfully displayed in the circumstances surrounding the writing of his final letter the book of revelation even at the ripe age of around 80 years old john's faith was so evident that emperor domitian imprisoned him to the isle of patmos in the aegean sea for a year and a half while banished on the island john's faith chose to walk in the spirit rather than self-pity and then he received the revelation of jesus christ as a result of john's faith the book of revelation has been called a complete overview of theology due to its teachings on sin redemption angels demons israel gentiles and christ divinity the beauty of revelation is that it shows your daily choices and actions determine which end time events you'll experience john's mature faith has provided us an intimate glorious glimpse of christ's plans for the end of human history and beginning of the eternal day the faith foundation much more could be said about faith as this crucial subject fills new testament scripture being mentioned over 220 times as you move on to the second character quality rejoice in the rock solid foundation of faith god has given you by his grace your foundation will hold in your greatest temptations just as peter's faith held him in his hardest trial his denial of christ before the crucifixion our lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren jesus's prayer kept peter's faith foundation from failing even after denying christ three times peter didn't commit suicide like judas or leave judea as a vagabond like cain left god's presence rather he hung around until he could experience christ's forgiveness because he knew there was no other place to go for eternal life peter said in john 6 68 lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life be encouraged that jesus prayed the same for you in john 17 verses 20 and 21 for you have believed on him through the words of his original apostles neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me since your faith is motivated by love your faith foundation will be the rock upon which god can build your spiritual house the stature of a perfect man jesus says therefore whosoever heareth the sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock as an overcomer you have rejected satan's bait of unbelief and have let god add faith to your being what a wonderful decision you've chosen god's way to heaven by repentance and water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ the great and wise master builder jesus christ is now ready to add his next character quality to you virtue character quality number two virtue second peter 1 verse 5 reads and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue the second step on your way to godliness is virtue which is a second measure or portion of the holy ghost anointing god wants to add to your being in the greek lexicon virtue is defined as a virtuous course of thought feeling and action virtue moral goodness and moral excellence a hebrew definition is strength might efficiency combining these definitions the bible places virtue as the strength to daily walk in god's way logically god must first give you faith to choose the right way to walk and secondly empower you with the virtue to daily walk in his narrow path christians who ask for and receive god's virtue must first reject the sin of hypocrisy the greek definition of hypocrisy is the acting of a stage player a modern definition is the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform jesus witnessed much hypocrisy during his earthly ministry calling out the scribes and pharisees in matthew 23 verse 25 and verse 28 for presenting a false moral strength to the public christ says woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you may clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity virtue is power to consistently live out your faith for christ publicly and privately before family co-workers friends and strangers in matthew 10 verses 32 through 42 jesus requires that all believers confess him before men and their families saying for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foe shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that love his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me since jesus requirement is public and private confession of his great name he provides the anointing of virtue to all believers examples of virtuous bible characters ruth from the old testament is a shining example of virtue boaz the wealthy bethlehemite lord of the harvest was kinsmen to malan roof's first husband who died without any children to carry on his name ruth laid at boaz's feet initiating him to claim his right to be her kinsmen redeemer and fulfilled deuteronomy 25 verses through 10 and boaz quickly promised to marry her ruth 3 verse 11 expresses boaz's confidence in ruth's virtue known to the entire city and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou require us for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman when a believer has divine virtue he can live out his faith at all times and in all public settings boaz further pointed out that ruth could have followed a younger man rich or poor to attempt having children but she instead chose to honor god's kinsmen requirement temptations ran rampant in ruth's life just as in your life but her virtue empowered her to overcome every test righteous ruth's testimony proclaims the power or virtue to obey god's word publicly despite financial and sensual temptations solomon offers further examples of virtue in proverbs 31 verses 10 through 31 focusing on virtuous women above all solomon says a virtuous woman possesses the fear of the lord promising she shall be praised wisdom is the result of godly fear according to proverbs 9 verse 10 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom therefore virtuous women make wise decisions in motherhood personal finances and business deals a virtuous woman is trustworthy the heart of her husband does safely trust in her a virtuous woman is busy meeting everyone's needs and eateth not the bread of idleness she is spiritually clothed with strength and honor as she serves her family both inside and outside the home as seen in ruth's example solomon agrees that a virtuous woman's value is great her price is far above ruby's the prophet daniel is an example of a virtuous man he was so dedicated to god that his coworkers could not find one thing wrong with his work which made them concoct a devious plan to entrap him into breaking a new law they wrote themselves forbidding prayer to his god jehovah in daniel chapter 6. daniel's inner virtue or strength led him to continue his three daily prayers without hesitation although he knew the law and his consequences daniel's virtue amidst his arrest and sentence to be thrown into a den of hungry lions caused god to send an angel to shut the lion's mouths securing daniel's deliverance this is the power of divine virtue public strength to do what is right in god's sight even when you know you will suffer jesus's examples of virtue jesus's teachings in matthew chapters 5 and 6 contain simple concrete examples of how christians can manifest virtue in both public and private settings in these settings divine virtue is needed for spur-of-the-moment public requests as well as planned out private giving in matthew 5 verses 38 through 42 christ teaches four virtuous responses to public trouble and surprising or unplanned requests first if you're smitten on the right cheek let your enemy smite your left cheek second if you're sued in court for your coat or undergarment give your adversary your cloak or outer garment as well third if you're compelled to carry someone's message for a mile be willing to go two miles fourth give to those who ask for your possessions and be willing to let others borrow them in matthew 6 verses 1 through 4 jesus teaches about almsgiving in private our lord encourages believers to take heed or pay special attention to giving alms or charity in secret and not before men jesus knows it takes his virtue to give in secret christ says therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward recall hypocrisy is the sin that must be rejected in order to receive god's virtue true almsgiving can only be done with the virtue anointing with jesus virtue you will not seek glory of men but glory of your heavenly father jesus's healing virtue jesus's healing virtue must be differentiated from divine virtue healing virtue is synonymous with a gift of healing and is different from the second character quality peter describes in the stature of a perfect man mark 5 verses 25-30 and luke 6 verses 18-19 detail jesus's healing virtue in both cases sick people were healed after touching jesus scripture says and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all one woman with an issue of blood for 12 years touched jesus's garment and instantly felt in her body that she was healed of that plague the heavenly father had not previously told his son about this encounter so christ was surprised to feel his healing power flow out of his spirit into the sick woman he turned around and said who touched my clothes when she heard his request she humbly came before the savior and he honored her faith saying daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague healing virtue is not given to every christian just as the other eight gifts are given at god's choosing not ours paul plainly states that not everyone has every spiritual gift in first corinthians 12 verses 29 and 30. are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret it would be erroneous to say every christian is an apostle or missionary if that was true there would be no need of local pastors because each missionary would be traveling to spread the faith similarly if everyone spoke in unknown tongues there would be no interpreters to make known the meaning of the unknown tongues rejoice in jesus's healing virtue and those who have that gift today but do not confuse the spiritual gift of healing with a second character quality of virtue you do not need to have healing virtue the gift of healing in order to be virtuous you will have healing virtue only if god has ordained a healing ministry for your life peter's loss and restoration of virtue peter god's chosen author of the stature of a perfect man is a prime example of gaining virtue losing it then gaining it again with no worry of losing it examining peter's life mark 1 verses 14 through 18 shows that peter received faith the first character quality of christ when he repented and began following jesus as christ's first sermons dealt with repentance john 4 verses 1 and 2 records that peter and jesus disciples baptized new believers but jesus did no baptizing peter must have been baptized after his repentance as peter would not be permitted to baptize others unless he himself had been baptized shortly afterwards peter received the character quality of virtue because he publicly preached christ in his hometown and other cities matthew 11 verse 1 says and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities luke 9 verses 1 through 6 says jesus gave peter and the apostles power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases and they went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing everywhere peter's virtue strengthened him to unashamedly declare jesus's gospel publicly in his hometown sadly a few years later peter lost his virtue when he denied christ three times on the night before the crucifixion due to the threat of arrest or imprisonment peter let fear come over him and the adversary spoiled his virtue when confronted by a maid and a crowd who associated him with jesus scripture says peter began to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the crew and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly how could a man that walked on water had the keys of the kingdom had preached and healed in cities for christ's sake and known jesus for over three years deny him the evil spirit of fear that robs believers of their power had overcome peter in this temptation second timothy 1 verse 7 says for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind despite losing his virtue peter never lost his faith foundation because jesus interceded in prayer for him prior to peter's three denials luke 22 verses 31-32 reads and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren how marvelous and strong are the prayers of jesus despite jesus's warning peter pridefully declared lord i am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death this boasts was proven untrue within a matter of hours but jesus's prayer kept peter from permanently falling away from his faith unlike judas iscariot god's rich mercy restored peter's virtue during the 50-day period from the passover christ's crucifixion to the day of pentecost jesus showed himself alive to peter on multiple occasions giving both peter and the apostles many infallible proofs of the resurrection then on the day of pentecost peter is one of the 120 who received the baptism of the holy ghost the promise of the father empowering him never to deny christ again the book of acts records multiple examples of peter being threatened and imprisoned for christ and each time he displayed unwavering virtue to publicly witness jesus resurrection without recanting the difference in peter's life was that virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and broly kindness had all been added to his faith and sealed into him by the baptism of the holy ghost after being born again peter never lost his virtue again because it was sealed into him gaining and losing the character qualities failing grace peter's virtue example reveals people can gain and lose god's character qualities known as failing or despising grace peter was saved of course regaining his virtue and being a holy ghost-filled christian after pentecost but judas is scary it was lost for he never regained the virtue he once had after selling out christ the spiritual life of judas's scare requires an in-depth study judas temporarily received christ's character qualities walking in the anointing of god's spirit for nearly three years before deciding to betray jesus and be filled with satan's spirit luke 22 3 says then entered satan into judas and john 13 verse 27 says and after the soph satan entered into him judas's life had an eternally sad ending judas's ministry started correctly after all night prayer in luke 6 verses 12 through 16 jesus called judas iscariot and the 11 other disciples to be his apostles john 4 verses 1 and 2 tells us jesus apostles baptized new believers which proves judas must have first confessed his faith in jesus as messiah and been baptized before he would be ordained to baptize others judas received faith in christ believing just as strongly as the other eleven apostles as he witnessed jesus miracles for john 2 verse 11 says this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him as one of jesus's twelve apostles judas was sent out with the same supernatural commission from the lips of christ himself with power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease judas no doubt experienced god's power and anointing to do miracles and was faithful to his calling for nearly three years after judas death the apostles even bore witness of judas's ministry apostleship and bishopric in acts 1 verses 15-26 peter said judas obtained part of this ministry but fell by transgression from it judas possessed some of the divine character qualities but departed from or abandoned them for monetary gain jesus did not cast away judas judas cast away jesus and his divine nature john 6 34 declares jesus's promise to not cast away anyone who comes to him all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out apparently judas lived a relatively clean obedient life to christ command throughout jesus's three-year ministry as evidenced on the night judas betrayed jesus during the passover supper jesus shared that one of his disciples would betray him notice none of the apostles instantly pointed at judas and said judas has been a devil all along we always knew he'd betrayed jesus in fact each disciple became exceedingly sorrowful and asked jesus one by one if he would be the betrayer when it came to judas's turn matthew 26 25 records then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i he said unto him thou hast said there was a moment judas's spiritual weakness was seen before his final betrayal of christ for thirty pieces of silver six days before he betrayed christ judas disdained lazarus sister mary for anointing jesus's feet with very costly spikenard in order for his burial john 12 verses 5-8 records judas's complaint about and jesus's protection of mary why was not this ointment sold for 300 pence and given to the poor this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein then jesus said let her alone against the day of my bearing has she kept this for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always it's implied from john 12 6 that judas was stealing money from jesus's ministry throughout his time as jesus's treasurer but he kept his secret sin from being discovered by the other apostles only god knows how much and how often he stole from our lord's money according to jesus many not few follow judas's pattern of selling out the gospel for worldly lusts matthew 7 verses 21-23 contains jesus's exact description of the many judas like churchgoers who temporarily receive god's anointing but then reject it for a life of iniquity or wicked living not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then i will profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity choose to be one of the few saved christians who walks the narrow road of holiness leading to eternal life six texts support the truth that many will be like judas temporarily receiving the character qualities of christ but will ultimately reject them and be damned on judgment day matthew 12 verses 29 through 30 and verses 43-45 luke 8 verses 1-18 hebrews 3 verses 7 through chapter 4 verse 16. hebrews 6 verses 1-12 hebrews 10 verses 19 through 39 and 2 peter 2 verses 19 through 22 matthew 12 verses 29 through 30 and verses 43 through 45 illustrate a man as a house that is filled with good things or god's spiritual character qualities such as faith and virtue the only way this person can be demon-possessed is if he lets a demon bind him allowing the demons to spoil his house this means the man stops obeying god's word and submits to the will of demons the goods the man once had perhaps faith and virtue are taken away meaning the man no longer has those divine attributes of god jesus gives more detail about this spiritual robbery in verses 43-45 saying demons that are cast out of a man will get help from seven other demons and return to the man to enter in and dwell there making the last state of that man worse than the first this is what happened to judas he began as a clean house but eventually he was deceived into betraying christ and satan himself not eight demons entered into him on passover night friend your three-part being body spirit soul is a battlefield that you must daily fight for and conquer through obedience to the holy ghost luke 8 verses 1 through 18 records jesus's parable of the sower and the seed sown represents the word of god the four grounds represent four kinds of hearts that hear the word the second rocky ground receives the word and for a while believes but eventually falls away in a time of temptation in the parallel passage in matthew 13 verse 21 christ says this person deareth for a while which in the greek means he believes for a season enduring only for a while temporarily people can genuinely possess the seed word of divine faith for a while and then forsake it deserting and withdrawing into death destruction in hell hebrews 3 verses 7 through chapter 4 verse 16 is an extensive passage that provides a powerful and crucial illustration of gaining and losing spiritual character qualities the hebrews author most likely paul uses israel's exodus out of egypt and journeyed to possess the promised land as an allegory of the new testament christians journey from faith to charity figure 11 shows the three stages of israel's journey as allegorical to the christians three-stage journey to the baptism of the holy ghost the text teaches the israeli hearts were soft in the first stage but became hardened through the deceitfulness of sin during the wilderness testing or second stage jeremiah 2 verse 2 adds to this saying that israel loved god when they went after him in the wilderness hebrews 3 verse 14 states there are conditions to every promise of god saying for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end if believers keep believing god's word and faithfully serve jesus they will enter into his rest the third stage the soul rest or the baptism of the holy ghost jesus spoke of in matthew 11 verse 29 and john 7 verses 37-39 deuteronomy 3 verse 20 says possessing the promised land is israel's rest the israeli souls who died in the wilderness had gained many miles in their journey but lost many benefits when unbelief ruled their hearts doubting they could possess canaan due to the evil report of the ten spies in numbers 13 verse 31 through numbers chapter 14 verse 3. figure 11 israel's three stages are a type of the new christians journey through the three works of grace stage one is justification by faith in this stage israel exited egypt and crossed the red sea waters the new testament christians first stage is repentance and water baptism israel's second stage was sanctification and was their wilderness testing the new testament christians second stage is sanctification of the spirit the cleansing of heart and mind and daily habits israel's third stage was possessing canaan the new testament christian's third stage is the spiritual rest of the baptism of the holy ghost in hebrews 6 verses 1 through 12 the author again illustrates the christian life as a journey saying believers leave or are sent forth from the introductory principles of the doctrine of christ and go on unto perfection by god's permission the text affirms that it's impossible for one who falls away from faith to be renewed again unto repentance notice the one who fell away did indeed repent at one time meaning he had faith mark 1 verse 15 teaches faith or belief comes at repentance what did the person fall away from the text says the person was enlightened by the holy spirit tasted of the heavenly gift and was made a partaker of the holy ghost judas iscariot is again our prime example of one who fell away despite being enlightened by the messiah tasting the heavenly gifts of healing and miracles and partaking of the holy ghost anointed ministry given to him by christ judas put christ to an open shame publicly betraying him with a kiss that led to his arrest and crucifixion judas partook of heavenly gifts even tasting the good word of god and the powers of the world to come but fell away from them believers are urged to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slawful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises just like peter twice emphasized diligence in 2 peter 1 verse 5 and verse 10 the hebrews author says diligence is required to finish the christian journey and inherit god's promises two more scriptures show many people will fall away from faith in the last days in second timothy 3 verses 1 through 7 paul declares the last days will be perilous times in which men will be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god the apostle further writes in 2 thessalonians 2 3 the man of sin or person of the antichrist can be revealed only after a great falling away or apostasy from the christian faith sinners who never know the way of righteousness cannot fall away from faith as taught in ii peter 2 verse 21 only believers with faith can fall away from christianity and bible prophecy says your day is a perilous dangerous time to live in when many will forsake truth we must be fortified with the full armor of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints if we expect to withstand this evil day another hebrews text chapter 10 verses 19-39 shows how people can draw back unto perdition or lose their confession of eternal life not believing to the saving of the soul in the greek drawback means retreating or shrinking back on the narrow road to eternal life you choose one of three options finishing the journey in strength becoming idle by staying in one place or retreating from the narrow road to the broad road this hebrews text begins with the reality of our prayerful approach to god's heavenly throne through a true heart in full assurance of faith after a command to assemble more with christians as christ's return approaches verses 26 and 29 detail how sinning willfully on purpose after knowing truth is grounds for sore punishment from god verse 29 emphatically declares of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite under the spirit of grace the main phrase to notice is wherewith he was sanctified proving a person can be genuinely sanctified meaning separated from profane things and dedicated to god in the greek and yet retreat from the spiritual condition and be lost reference figure 11 and recall sanctification is the second stage of a christian's journey to the baptism of the holy ghost just as all israel came to kedish barnea the border of the promised land or third stage of their journey and provoked god by rejecting his leadership to possess canaan people journey through the first two stages of the christian journey justification and sanctification and provoke god drawing back into a sinful lifestyle without being born again by the holy ghost verses 38 and 39 are a beautiful encouraging conclusion to this text saying now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul figure 12 shows how the three-stage journey matches the stature of a perfect man faith is the character quality you receive when you are justified during sanctification god gives you the character qualities of virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness the third stage is when charity the love of god or god's spirit baptizes your soul into the kingdom of god as a seal unto the day of your redemption figure 12 three stages and the stature of a perfect man first stage justification the christian receives faith second stage sanctification the christian receives virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness third stage the baptism of the holy ghost the christian receives charity the sixth and final text is second peter 2 verses 19-22 in which peter teaches people can escape the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ but become again entangled therein and overcome back into their corrupt lifestyle peter compares this backslider to a pig or sow that can be washed and made clean but then return to wallow in the mire jesus says the only way to be clean is through his word in john 15 3 now are ye clean through the word which i have spoken unto you a soul-like person can indeed receive god's word and be washed with his divine character traits temporarily only to forsake them later returning to a sin addicted lifestyle the example of the saved thief on the cross shows how swiftly you can gain the character qualities of god most know the thief on jesus's right hand was saved because christ told him verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise but few people know that the saved thief was initially mocking and reviling jesus along with passers-by chief priests scribes and elders matthew 27 verse 44 reads the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth at some point during their hours on the cross together the saved thief received faith and enough virtue to publicly stand for christ's innocence and plead for eternal life he also rebuked the lost thief saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the dew reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou cometh into thy kingdom the lesson is jesus will quickly and faithfully pardon all those who glory in his sinlessness and humbly plead for eternal life recognizing or weighing a lack of character jesus christ recognized a lack of divine character in the rich young ruler recorded in three gospels matthew 19 verses 16 through 30 mark 10 verses 17 through 31 and luke 18 verses 18 through 30. mark 10 21 says jesus loved this young man for he had kept all six of the commandments christ listed from his childhood ten commandments five through nine plus leviticus 19 verse 18. what a rare specimen of obedience his sincerity was apparent because he came running not walking and kneeling before christ yet despite all this the man knew he'd lacked eternal life saying what lack i yet god puts a conscience in every heart including yours and mine so we know how far we have come with god and if we yet lack his character qualities jesus agreed saying one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me the ruler left jesus grieved and sorrowful for he had great possessions your story doesn't have to end like this rulers by grace you can add to your character as the story implies god's spirit gives a true honest spiritual assessment for every person through preaching bible reading and witnessing not only does god love you like he loved this ruler but he offers explicit directions on what you must do to continue growing in grace and knowledge of the lord jesus christ right now you can know where you are in god's plan for your life you can look at figure 12 and ask the holy spirit to reveal which stage you are in have you recently been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ with divine faith then you are in stage one and ready to move into stage two seeking virtue have you received divine virtue living boldly for christ in public settings and ready to go further into divine knowledge or beyond into temperance or patience or are you ready to be baptized with the holy ghost in stage 3 seeing godliness brotherly kindness and the other stage 2 qualities manifesting in your life jesus's body is in heaven but his holy spirit is present and near to every heart attempting to show his current character and offer a greater experience serving christ acts 17 verses 26 through 28 says and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your poets have said for we are also his offspring scripture declares god weighs each person's character in proverbs 16 verse 2 all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord weigheth the spirits god's word is the measuring stick or balance that measures or weighs your character paul says in philippians 3 16 christians should walk by the same rule which means a measuring rod rule a carpenter's line or measuring tape in the greek the reason god gave us his word is so we can measure our lives by its truths someday all be judged by the word for paul declares god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel joining the rich young ruler belshazzar and job are two more bible examples of men aware that their lives were being weighed by god belshazzar king of babylon at the time of its fall profaned israel's holy temple vessels by feasting with them while praising idols supernatural fingers interrupted the evil feast by writing the king's doom on the palace wall which daniel interpreted as thou belshazzar art weighed in the balances and found wanting the king was guilty of refusing to learn humility from nebuchadnezzar's life and offer glory to the one true god in god's sight belshazzar's character was wanting or deficient of humility job had his patience tested to its limit yet past the test after suffering the loss of his livestock servants and children by satan's desire job kept his integrity by worshiping god and not charging god foolishly job endured months of tests and pleaded with god saying let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity god had weighed job's life and deemed it acceptable telling his three friends that job had spoken right and they had spoken wrong paul explains in second corinthians 4 verses 16 through 18 that trials and tests of faith produce an eternal weight of glory what is this eternal weight it must be the heavenly awards that await christians such as the crown of life and memorials god keeps as witnesses of his children's righteous acts of faith acts 10 4 says an angel let cornelius know that a memorial of his prayers and almsgiving were before god in heaven may you set your affection on things above and live for eternal rewards in the midst of your tests peter says our tests of faith are much more precious than of gold that perisheth jesus wants to help you recognize your current character and what is lacking so that you may accept his portion of divine character which will help you store up an eternal weight of glory in heaven character quality number three knowledge 2 peter 1 verse 5 reads and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge knowledge is the third step on your way to godliness it's a third measure or portion of holy ghost anointing god wants to add to your spirit in the greek knowledge is defined as general intelligence understanding the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion such as belongs to the more advanced especially of things lawful and unlawful for christians based upon this definition the bible places knowledge as a deep understanding of christianity you need to advance on god's way logically god must give you knowledge a deep understanding of god after you have faith and virtue faith helped you choose the right way to walk and virtue was moral power to daily walk in his narrow path but knowledge helps you understand deeper truths about what pleases god and why he requires certain behaviors since his judgments are unsearchable and his ways past finding out christians who asked for and receive god's knowledge must first reject the sin of reasoning or human understanding you must differentiate honest spiritual reasoning from sinful reasoning god gave you the gift to use spiritual reasoning in your daily life in isaiah god lovingly invited israel to reason with him promising to wash their sins white as snow if they were willing obedient and did well this glorious spiritual reasoning leads to eternal life but sinful reasoning is different it's a thought process exalting satan's or man's will above god's genesis 3 provides the first example of humans choosing sinful reasoning over god's knowledge the subtle serpent begowed eve into eating the forbidden fruit through false reasoning god had previously told adam he'd surely die if he partook of the fruit in genesis 2 verse 17 and eve had the same knowledge according to genesis 3 verses 2 and 3 but the serpent exalted his will above gods claiming eve would not surely die because she would be wise like a god knowing good and evil even after eve's beguilement adam willingly chose to join in his wife's disobedience plunging humanity into utter chaos both of their reasoning was completely contrary to god's knowledge and produced incalculable effects upon human history every emergency siren screams out because of sinful reasoning each natural disaster ravages the land because of human reasoning every skin wrinkle and gray hair is the result of eve's false reasoning every funeral is the result of the serpent's sinful reasoning thankfully jesus's spiritual reasoning to always do those things that please the father has resulted in redemption for all believers romans 5 verses 18 and 19 declares therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous in capernaum the lord jesus confronted scribes about their sinful reasoning when he forgave the palsy-stricken man's sins in mark 2 verses 1 through 12. the scribes along with all the region around about galilee had heard of jesus's famous authority over demons and his miracles and should have understood that he the christ had power to forgive sins after all scribes knew isaiah's prophecies that the messiah was the mighty god the everlasting father the merciful messiah gave the scribes another chance to reject their sinful reasoning by healing the man of palsy saying but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house paul models a faithful example of godly reasoning out of the scriptures in acts 17 verses 1 through 12. for three straight sabbath days paul uses old testament scripture to reason with thessalonians about prophecies of jesus's death and resurrection causing some to believe when the apostle moves on to berea and reasons again in the synagogue the new believers react in the best manner supporting their godly reasoning by searching the scriptures themselves acts 17 verse 11 says these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so you manifest honest spiritual reasoning when you hungrily seek god's word for yourself knowledge as a key light and fragrance three bible metaphors describe knowledge as a key light and fragrance providing christians three perspectives on the life-changing power of divine knowledge jesus calls knowledge a key in luke 11 52 woe unto you lawyers for ye have taken away the key of knowledge ye enter not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hindered our lord makes a similar statement to the pharisees in matthew 23 verse 13 but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in in both statements jesus rebukes religious men for disallowing people from entering into the kingdom of heaven these evil men took away the key of knowledge so people could not enter the kingdom of heaven through jesus's ministry the jewish rulers had the true knowledge about jesus nicodemus expressed that he and the sanhedrin council knew jesus was a teacher sent from god yet jewish leaders threatened to excommunicate anyone from the synagogue who believed in jesus as messiah how is this done satan anointed false teachers with doctrines of devils and commandments of men to point followers away from entering into christ the door i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture to ensure his followers entered into eternal blessings jesus gave peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven in matthew 16 verse 19. after you receive the holy ghost on the day of pentecost the book of acts records that peter used the keys to unlock salvation and the holy ghost baptism to three different groups jews samaritans and gentiles the jews received salvation from peter's preaching in acts 2 verses 14 through 47. the keys or promises of god peter used to help three thousand souls enter the kingdom of heaven are found in acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the samaritans needed peter's keys to be born again in acts 8 verses 1 through 17 having been previously saved and baptized through philip's ministry once peter and john arrived they prayed for and laid hands upon the new believers and the holy ghost fell upon them birthing spiritual children into god's kingdom the gentiles also received the holy ghost through peter's keys in acts 10 verses 34 through 48. while peter preached at cornelius house the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word peter later rehearsed these events to jews in acts 11 verses 1 through 18 declaring that god was granting to the gentiles repentance unto life peter faithfully and powerfully used the keys jesus gave him to allow three different groups to access eternal life acts 16 details paul's first european convert from thyatira in modern-day turkey named lydia sent by vision to macedonia paul went to pray at a riverside and spoke to a group of women about jesus christ lydia received paul's knowledge of christ and she and her household were baptized the key of knowledge opened lydia's heart and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyrotira which worshiped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended under the things which were spoken of paul every promise of god is obtained by knowledge or understanding god's will second peter 1 verses 3 and 4 reads according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust all spiritual blessings come through the knowledge of him god whether you need salvation cleansing bodily healing or deliverance light is the second metaphor paul uses to describe knowledge in 2nd corinthians 4 verses 6 and 7 located in our hearts or spirits for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined into our hearts to give the light of knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us david writes the same in psalm 119 verse 130 saying the entrance of thy words giveth light it giveth understanding unto the simple the knowledge of god's word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path giving understanding to the humble anywhere salvation through the gospel of jesus christ is preached in truth the light of knowledge is shining paul and barnabas first preached the light of god's knowledge to jews in antioch who blasphemed it causing the apostles to focus on preaching to gentiles then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for soweth the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth jesus says the gospels knowledge light will shine upon every nation then the end of the world will come fragrance is the third metaphor scripture uses to explain knowledge paul writes in second corinthians 2 verses 14 through 16. now thanks be unto god which always causes us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge by us in every place for we are unto god a sweet saver of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one we are the savior of death unto death and to the other the savior of life unto life and who is sufficient for these things the savior or fragrance of divine knowledge is spread by christians in every place they preach to believers their knowledge is fragrance unto life but to sinners it's fragrance unto death principles of knowledge divine knowledge is founded on the principles that god cannot lie the bible is free from contradictions and god still works through supernatural gifts of the holy ghost these principles ensure your advancement in deeper christian truths because you know god is trustworthy god cannot lie many scoffers say god changes his mind deceives mankind and doesn't keep his promises nothing could be further from the truth scripture shouts every man is a liar or has told a lie at some point during his lifetime and god is the only truth teller god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and might has overcome when thou art judged god told noah to build an ark because he would flood the earth in judgment upon wicked-hearted men noah faithfully prepared the ark for around 55 to 75 years before one drop of rain fell god's word stood true despite over a half century of waiting upon it 25 years after god promised abram he'd make a great nation out of him isaac was born to his wife sarah despite both of their occasional doubtful laughter at god's promise over a two-decade wait the word came to pass god repeatedly strengthened abraham's faith until he was fully persuaded that what he god had promised he was able also to perform over 800 years before jesus birth the prophet isaiah foretold it saying behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel eight centuries of theological skepticism could not stop god from keeping his promise by visiting a highly favored virgin named mary causing her to conceive jesus the son of god it's crucial to understand god makes both conditional and unconditional promises his promise that a virgin would conceive the messiah was unconditional but his warning to destroy nineveh was conditional and jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown god's word doesn't record the conditional aspect of his warning it only states its overthrowing the lesson is to seek understanding if a promise of god is conditional or unconditional any unconditional promise god speaks today just as in the past will come to pass conditional promises require mature spiritual discernment since failed prophecies spoken in god's name were not spoken by god but rather by an evil lying spirit impersonating the holy one the bible is free from contradictions since god sent jesus as the way to save sinners because he so loved the world he is obligated to give us an infallible written record of instructions for how to walk this way the just and fair god must provide a clear path to heaven if he is warning mankind with everlasting judgment for willful disobedience to his eternal life offer humanity will be judged by god's word romans 2 verse 16 says in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel jesus is the word of god and the true word of god is found in the king james version of the holy bible floyd nolan jones book which version is the bible details the validity and reliability of the king james version in contrast to modern bible versions jones proclaims from the outset that the king james or authorized version is the word of god translated into the english language to the extent that it is the final authority in all matters of conduct and faith the kjv is set apart from modern versions because its new testament is translated from the most accurate greek manuscripts the textus receptus whereas modern versions use the corrupted greek text called the codex vaticanus b two men b.f westcott 1825 to 1901 and fja hort 1828 to 1892 produced this polluted radical greek text in 1881 examples of bound of modern versions through westcott and hort's efforts omitting god's pure words proving just how dangerously deceptive these versions are estimated by jones westcott and hort changed added or subtracted 7 of the 140 521 greek words in the texas receptus revelations 22 verses 18 and 19 warns of the awful eternal repercussions for adding to god's word or taking away from them because every word of god is pure and taking away from the word is exactly what modern versions do colossians 1 verse 14 says we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins in the kjv but the niv esv and nasv omit through his blood certainly the enemy satan wants jesus's blood omitted as much as possible because he knows the blood of the everlasting covenant makes believers perfect in every good work to do god's will christians daily access the cleansing power of jesus's blood for we wash our robes white in the blood of the lamb the kjv of isaiah 14 12 identify satan as lucifer son of the morning but modern versions omit lucifer and give satan titles that belong only to christ the niv of isaiah 14 verse 12 calls satan morning star which is a title only given to christ in revelation 22 16 god is not the author of confusion he does not share his name or titles with anyone else but satan wants to be like christ and seeks to steal his worship according to isaiah 14 verses 13-14 the esv and rsv make a similar error in isaiah 14 12 calling satan the day star but jesus christ is the single day star that has risen in our hearts according to 2 peter 1 verse 19. the kjv is the only version that preserves god's original full revelation of himself and his will some say the king james version contains contradictions but that is false one example of a supposed contradiction concerns how many died in the plague after the feast of baal pior numbers 25 9 says 24 000 died while 1st corinthians 10 verse 8 says 23 000 which is it the key is understanding the wording notice the words fell in one day found in first corinthians 10 verse 8 there is no contradiction between the two scriptures because 23 000 died in one day and then 1 000 more died either the next day or in the following days thereafter to bring the total fallen to 24 000. careful prayerful bible study allows christians to maintain full assurance that god's word is contradiction free god still works through the supernatural gifts of the holy ghost many follow the cessation doctrine believing the gifts of the holy ghost have ceased without going into great depth on this subject know that the cessation doctrine is wrong for a number of reasons first jesus put the gifts into the church as part of the great commission and never took them out mark 16 verses 15-18 records jesus promise that gifts like speaking in tongues casting out devils and healing the sick would follow them that believe as the gospel was preached in all the world to every creature in a parallel passage on the great commission our lord said lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amen genuine manifestation of spiritual gifts are evidence of christ's spirit being present and working with all believers in all generations until the end of the world christ never limited these gifts to just the apostles but said the gifts were for them that believe any true believer some think first corinthians 13 verses 8 through 13 teaches the gifts ended with the completion of the written new testament careful examination of this text proves otherwise for paul states perfection will come when we are face to face with christ since living christians are not yet face to face with christ we still need prophecies tongues and knowledge to operate in part meaning through and despite the veil of our sinful bodies once we have new eternal bodies or that which is perfect then that which is in part shall be done away with our human bodies will be changed into glorified or perfect bodies when we see jesus that is the moment we will not need spiritual gifts first john 3 verse 2 teaches when he jesus shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is paul writes who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself second paul ordained the nine gifts of the spirit to the corinthians and all christians over 20 years after jesus ascended to heaven paul received his revelation from jesus christ himself and warned that if anyone changed it they were cursed in the same letter to the galatians the apostle defends the gifted members among them who are working miracles by the hearing of faith rather than the works of the law paul never condemned gifted workers of miracles nor did he tell them to cease operating in spiritual gifts third many supporters of the cessation doctrine say only the apostles of christ were to use the gifts and then the gifts would cease this argument is extremely shallow and proven false by a casual reading of the new testament philip the evangelist had four virgin daughters obviously not among the twelve apostles who prophesied according to acts 21 verses 8 and 9. agabus was a prophet who correctly predicted the great dirt throughout all the world in acts 11 verse 28. paul told the thessalonians not to despise prophecies by quenching the holy spirit but rather to prove them to be sure they were from god this was the same principle paul taught the corinthians gifts are welcome to operate as long as they are tested and proven to be truly from the lord to conclude this subject christians covet earnestly the best gifts but their operation must be motivated by love as love is a more excellent way those who operate gifts of god are not always among the saved so greater emphasis should be placed upon loving obedience to every word of god rather than seeking the operation of gifts god is the only one who determines when gifts operate in paul's life god led him to do many great miracles but he couldn't heal himself from the thorn in his own flesh he left trophema sick at malidum in second timothy 4 verse 20 and told timothy to use a little wine for his sick stomach and often infirmities paul couldn't heal others at his own will god will lead his people to do miracles and all other gift operations at his sovereign will and not at the will of man the gift of the word of knowledge the gift of the word of knowledge is one of the nine gifts of the spirit listed in first corinthians 12 verses 8 through 10 like the separate gift of faith first corinthians 12 9 and the character quality of faith second peter 1 verse 5 the gift of the word of knowledge is different than the character quality of knowledge gifts are placed in a person's human spirit by god from his birth and can operate regardless of whether a person is saved or not the greek definition for the character quality of knowledge second peter 1 verse 5 and the gift of the word of knowledge first corinthians 12 8 is the same a deep understanding of things lawful and unlawful for advanced mature christians but the gift of the word of knowledge must be the ability to minister a deep understanding of god's word to others it's a gift or key of knowledge that allows someone to enter into the promises of god three examples from the book of acts demonstrate this gift of knowledge in the lives of peter philip and paul in acts chapter 2 the baptism of the holy ghost falls upon 120 of jesus's followers and a multitude of jews witness their exuberant praise and adoration the multitude thinks these 120 believers are drunk but peter's gift of knowledge helps him understand the scriptural promise god is fulfilling joel 2 verses 28 to 32 he concludes his sermon by giving the multitude the key of knowledge they need to become christians repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ that day three thousand people entered into salvation through peter's word of knowledge philip uses god's gift of knowledge in acts 8 verses 26 through by sharing the understanding of jesus's fulfilling of isaiah 53 verses 7 and 8 to an ethiopian eunuch philip helps the eunuch understand jesus was the lamb of god brought to slaughter on calvary to save mankind philip continues to preach to the eunuch who sees water and asks to be baptized the chariot is made to stand still while philip baptizes him helping him enter into salvation and eternal life through the knowledge of god acts 19 verses 1 through 6 records paul's gift of knowledge opening the door for 12 ephesians to receive the baptism of the holy ghost previous to paul's coming the ephesians believed in jesus christ and had been saved through apollo's scriptural teachings for apollos mightily convinced the jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that jesus was christ it's clear the ephesians already had the character quality of knowledge but lacked the knowledge of god the father's promise to baptize believers with the holy ghost according to luke 24 49 and acts 1 verse 4 god graciously sends paul to ephesus to help them enter into the third step of the christian journey who asks have you received the holy ghost since she believed once the 12 receive this knowledge paul lays his hands on them and the holy ghost comes on them manifesting through tongues and prophecy whether knowledge is added to an individual's character or the gift of knowledge helps one christian minister understanding to another it's a life-changing enlightening anointing of the holy spirit character quality number four temperance second peter 1 verse 6 reads and to knowledge temperance temperance is the fourth step on your way to godliness a fourth measure or portion of holy ghost anointing god wants to add to your spirit the greek definition of temperance is self-control the virtue of one who masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetites temperance is the self-control you need to remain on god's way after choosing god's way through faith having virtue to publicly and daily walk the way and knowledge to more deeply understand the way god desires you crucify any remaining lust of the flesh and mind so you can remain on the way temperance empowers you to become more spiritual than carnal you have five carnal fleshly senses you must bring into subjection to the holy ghost sight taste touch smell and hearing once you've added temperance to your character by god's grace you'll be able to trust in your sixth sense faith rather than your five senses faith is a spiritual sense because it is an inward spiritual evidence you have of things not seen hebrews 11 1 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen galatians 5 verses 24 and 25 sums up the spiritual versus natural battle well and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit your victory to be spiritually minded is accomplished through crucifying your fleshly lusts crucifixion is a slow cruel death as seen in jesus's self-sacrificial death on the cross jesus calls you to take up your cross daily and follow me christians like paul die daily to the temptations endured through their five senses christians who ask for and receive god's temperance must first reject the sin of sensuality scripture repeatedly warns to flee from sensual lusts the experienced preacher paul told the young preacher timothy to flee youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart christians recognize sensual lusts and run from them just as joseph fled from the daily lustful advances of potiphar's wife in genesis 39 verses 7 through 12 more on joseph later in this chapter over time you can identify true temperate christians just by their physical location because scripture says sensual ones will ultimately separate from spirit-filled believers and gather with other lust seekers jude 1 verses 18-19 affirms the sensual ones separate and cannot have the holy spirit how they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts these be they who separate themselves sensual not having the spirit in first corinthians three verses one through 1-7 paul describes the damage sensual carnal sins had upon the corinthian church he compared the corinthians to babies that could only handle milk or elementary preaching rather than meat or deep preaching because of their carnality their sensuality manifested itself among the church members with envying and strife and divisions while they exalted their favorite preachers above others the apostle affirms that all preachers are equal in importance and mission planting and watering god's seed words but god is the only great one in the church first corinthians 3 verse 7 says so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase preachers cannot create spiritual life in new converts at their bidding god reserves this power to save converts to himself lust of the flesh and eyes and the pride of life sensual temptations come through one of three categories lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and pride of life first john 2 verses 15 and 16 says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world all earthly sins fit into one of these three categories you have and will be tempted through individual categories but also by multiple categories simultaneously the lust of the flesh is the first category and consists of sinful acts that bring your flesh pleasure or satisfaction bible examples include but are not limited to the following drunkenness being drunk perverts moral judgment proverbs 31 verses 4 and 5 and drunkards will not inherit the kingdom of god according to first corinthians 6 verse 10 overeating gluttony leads to poverty proverbs 23 verses 20 and 21 paul says enemies of jesus's cross are those who make their bellies their god philippians 3 verses 18 and 19 sexual sins amnon son of david was so vexed with fleshly lust that he raped his half-sister tamar and he was later murdered by her full brother absalon in second samuel 13 verses 1-39 paul told the corinthians to purge out and put away from their church a wicked brother who was fornicating with his stepmother in 1st corinthians 5 verses 1-13 drugs linked to and labeled as witchcraft by paul using drugs to experience a high is condemned and those guilty will not inherit the kingdom of god according to galatians 5 verses 20 and 21 the lust of the eyes consists of looking at and desiring things in a covetous manner covetousness is closely connected to the lust of the eyes because humans often covet things they see the following four examples are good things to behold with righteous intentions but satan often tries to pervert good intentions bible examples of lusting with the eyes include but are not limited to the following sexual attraction between a lawful husband and wife sexual attraction is a blessing any attraction outside of marriage must be overcome neglecting his war duties king david sees beautiful bathsheba bathing and immediately takes her to commit adultery after she conceives david has joab assigned uriah bathsheba's husband to a battle position where uriah is killed in 2nd samuel 11 verses 1-27 jesus says to look and lust upon a woman in your heart is the same as committing the literal act of adultery in matthew 5 verses 27 through 29. property possessing and defending property is a blessing and a god-given right desire to possess property must not supersede the kingdom of god jesus's great supper parable describes a man who turns down a great supper symbolizing the post-rapture marriage supper the lamb because he first must needs go and see his recently purchased land in luke 14 verse 18. material possessions god blesses believers with material possessions they need to enjoy life but he requires contentment ache and saw coveted after and took a babylonian garment silver and gold leading to the death of 36 israeli soldiers in joshua 7 verses 1-26 judas iscariot infamous traitor of our lord jesus sold out christ's location for 30 pieces of silver according to matthew 27 verses 3 through 10. financial prospects god makes some believers rich and others again contentment with god's will is the goal when given the choice of a dwelling place lot nephew of abraham chose the plain of jordan which eventually drew he and his family into the vexing wicked sodomite culture according to genesis 13 verses 10 through 11 and ii peter 2 verses 7 and 8. balaam the unfaithful prophet from moses's time greedily rejected god's perfect will in order to seek king balak's lucrative offer and cause israel to stumble in numbers 22 17 jude 1 verse 11 and revelation 2 verse 14. the pride of life consists of seeking self-promotion self-will and praise bible examples include but are not limited to reputation a good name is better than riches but believers must let god spread their reputations the men who partially built the tower of babel desire to reach heaven and make a name for themselves according to genesis 11 verses 1-9 herod was smitten by the angel the lord and worm eaten because he accepted praise as god rather than giving god the glory in acts 12 verses 22 and 23 greatness before receiving the holy ghost jesus disciples battled self-promotion because they argued about who was greater in luke 22 verses 24-26 god let king nebuchadnezzar wander with the beast of the field for seven years with a beast's mind because he believed it was his own power that established the babylonian kingdom in daniel 4 verse 30. strife korah electioneered for his group to take aaron's position as priest but god opened the earth to swallow them up alive in numbers 16 verses 1 through 50. king uzziah did likewise encroaching upon a spiritual office not belonging to him attempting to offer incense to god as a priest but the lord smote him with leprosy until the day he died according to second chronicles 26 verses 1 through 23 murder after god rejected cain's bloodless self-will offering and accepted abel's offering the enraged wrathful cain murdered his brother to conclude this section consider the contrast between eve and jesus's threefold temptation in genesis 3 and matthew 4 respectively both eve and christ were tempted in all three categories lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life but only christ overcame the enemy three times in genesis 3 verse 6 eve is tempted with the lust of the flesh because the tree was good for food she was tempted with the lust of the eyes because the tree was pleasant to the eyes e fell to the pride of life because the tree would make her wise after her submission to all three temptations eve partook of the fruit beguiled or wholly seduced and deceived by the serpent's subtility god now forbids women to preach his word and lead his people because eve let down her spiritual armor matthew 4 verses 1 through 11 details satan's greatest temptation ever upon a man but his temptation failed because he was tempting the righteous god-man christ jesus truly no man has ever been nor ever could be tempted more fiercely than jesus was tempted the savior was tempted by satan himself not just a lower ranking less powerful demon additionally christ was hungry after fasting for 40 days and his flesh was desperately weak yet our lord proved the weakest christian overcome satan's greatest attacks by quoting the rightly divided word of god note satan's second temptation challenged christ to cast himself down from a pinnacle in hopes the angels would bear him up basically satan urged christ to produce a miracle at his own will by misquoting scripture psalms 91 verses 10 through 12. satan deceives many christians by misapplying scripture and urging them to act upon their own thinking rather than god's thankfully our lord jesus christ rightly divided god's word and quoted deuteronomy 6 verse 16 saying it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god god asks us to prove him in tithes and offerings but not in hazarding our lives by jumping off colossal buildings to show off our power since we have none christ's lesson is this you quoting and obeying god's word will defeat satan himself anytime anywhere any place first samuel 4 verses 1 through 22 shows the importance of both quoting and obeying god's word backslidden in israel was quoting god's promise given to moses in numbers 10 35 to save them from their enemies through the ark of the covenant of course it was obedience to god's presence in the ark not just possessing the ark itself that gave the victories even though the earth rang with israel's hopeful shouts for victory the philistines easily defeated israel because they were living in disobedience to god quoting part of god's word without obeying the whole gets you nowhere speak god's word obey it stand upon it and watch satan leave you for a season just as he temporarily left christ never forget that god will not give you a temptation too difficult for you to conquer first corinthians 10 13 says there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that ye may be able to bear it the fruit of temperance just as faith is both a character quality and fruit of the spirit temperance is both as well figure 10 lists temperance as a fruit of the holy spirit in a mature christian's life and is the rarest form of temperance found under heaven joseph son of jacob displays mature temperance by fleeing the sexual advances of potiphar's wife in genesis 39 verses 7 through 12. joseph was around 28 years old at the time of this sexual temptation he was sold into slavery at 17 years old faithfully served potiphar for 11 years before being falsely accused and spent two years in prison after interpreting the butler and baker's dreams before being exalted to pharaoh's right hand at 30 years old at the time of the day-by-day sexual temptations joseph wasn't married and was in the prime of his life when his fleshly lusts were at their peak given the power and authority joseph had he would have known potiphar's schedule and had access to privacy in order to fulfill the lusts of his flesh but joseph overcame the temptation how did joseph display such mature temperance day after day at such a young age genesis 39 verse 9 reveals that he feared god more than fulfilling the lust of the flesh he boldly defied the seductress saying how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god how many church-going men today regardless of age would be able to turn down a woman constantly begging them for sexual pleasure joseph's temperance over the lust of the flesh strengthens and inspires believers of all ages to honor god with their bodies for their bodies belong to god the apostle paul's writings reveal his divine measure of temperance for he says christians are temperate in all things in first corinthians 9 verses 24 through 27 paul uses imagery of athletic games similar to the olympics to compare christians to professional runners just as runners train their bodies through self-denial with strenuous workouts and strict diets christians deny their fleshy lusts and strictly control their bodies that they might win the incorruptible crown of eternal life a christian is self-controlled or temper in his speech diet spending exercise work and every other area of his life paul's letter to the philippians shows his advanced temperance just two years before his martyrdom at the time of this letter in 64 a.d paul had served jesus for 30 years instead of increasing financial prosperity paul experienced frequent imprisonments and poverty christ was stripping him of the pride of life and helping him crucify the lusts of the flesh he rejoiced in the care the philippians had shown to his physical needs not because he desired gifts but because he knew god was going to add rewards to their accounts in heaven paul admits he was learning contentment whether his stomach was full or empty it is in this context of hunger pains that paul's quoted as saying i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me rest assured that christ's strength is readily available for you in times and seasons of suffering and want you can crucify the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and pride of life through christ who strengthens you with a measure of his own temperance character quality number five patience second peter 1 verse 6 reads and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience patience is the fifth step on your way to godliness a measure or portion of holy ghost anointing god wants to add to your spirit the greek definition of patience is steadfastness constancy endurance perseverance even in the greatest trials and sufferings patience is the steadfastness needed to be content on god's way no matter what tests trials persecutions or sufferings you encounter god's anointing of divine patience empowers you to endure the spiritual battles and come forth as a better christian right in the middle of your storm or test god's patience will hold you unwavering in your convictions as my friend cadre preaches you are tested in order to gain a testimony you are confident god allows your test to make you more obedient to him job knew this fact and proclaimed when he god hath tried me i shall come forth as gold to receive god's divine patience you must reject the sin of haste in our instant society with instant messenger instant pots instant money transfers quick fixes and 5g internet speeds we have grown accustomed to instant gratification almost unconsciously our culture teaches us impatience contrary wise god still teaches his children through the same time tested method patience delays waiting obstructions in fact if god answered every prayer of yours instantly you'd only be more impatient our flesh hates waiting but god knows it is the only way we can learn contentment additionally the bible states exactly when patience is gained in the middle of your tribulation romans 5 verses 3 and 4 says and not only so but we glory and tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope tribulation distress or life's pressures accomplish patience when you purposely choose to think about god's goodness rather than your disappointments isaiah 26 3 says thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee patience is the outcome of faithfulness offering thanksgiving to god while praying about your tribulation is being faithful this accomplishes patience according to philippians 4 verses 6 and 7. be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your request be made known unto god and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus a major temptation is making speedy decisions without proper prayer counsel and contemplation decision making in haste and sinful urgency is repeatedly condemned in god's word particularly in proverbs sinners make haste to shed blood and a hasty spirit exalteth folly too often people quickly praise foolish things like famous singers athletes politicians and even technological advances but jesus says that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of god be careful who or what you praise proverbs 29 verse 20 says see is thou a man that is hasting his words there is more hope of a fool than of him concerning money never be inpatient for riches proverbs 28 verse 22 says he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him israel's first king saul lost unimaginable rewards because of impatience although we know saul was saved samuel told saul he would be with him in paradise he lost out on god's establishing his kingdom forever because he couldn't wait a few extra hours for samuel to arrive and sacrifice a burnt offering god wasn't asking saul to wait extra weeks months or even years saul had to wait only a few extra hours to the end of the seventh day but he failed by forcing himself to offer his own burnt offering david on the other hand is an example of exercising divine patience as saul's royal replacement and the man god recognized as chasing after his heart david received god's promise and anointing to be king from samuel when he was around 15 years old but waited around 15 more years in order to inherit the promise because he was crowned king of hebron at 30 years old david's divine patience kept him from hastening his ascent to israel's throne as he could have killed saul on two occasions but would not harm the lord's anointed during those years of waiting david endured death threats from saul his own father-in-law enduring a fugitive's life david wrote many of the psalms during these years of waiting even psalms about avoiding saul like psalm 18 52 54 57 and 59 david's lesson is to sing to and about god in order to increase your patience while running for his life divine patience anointed david to sing i trust in the mercy of god forever and ever i will praise thee forever because thou has done it and i will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints surely if david could joyfully sing to god with patience for deliverance waiting upon god's name with a bounty on his head you can worship and praise jesus name in the midst of your trial job the patience poster child the bible teaches job is the prime example of patience you could call him the poster child for unwavering steadfastness james 5 verse 11 says behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy most know job was the richest and wisest man in the east as men sat at his feet awaiting his counsel as they would wait upon a chief and king job manifest patience with god and the tragic events of his life after suffering the excruciating loss of his livestock children and personal health his intense physical suffering with open skin sores from his head to his feet lasted for months and caused sleepless nights patient job endures the false accusation of his three friends before god himself descends in a whirlwind to humble job by asking him over 60 questions without directly answering job's questions god's first question is as unanswerable as the rest asking where waste thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou has understanding most importantly god's visit brings job to repentance and a greater appreciation and respect for the almighty god soon after the lord restored job's family and possessions blessing the latter end of job more than his beginning scripture records that job's great victory was his integrity because he did not speak evil things against god even resisting his wife's urge for him to curse god job's patient words in the midst of suffering revealed his patient heart jesus says evil words defile a person because the words originate from the heart matthew 12 34 says for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh let god add divine patience to your heart and you will speak patient words amidst your sufferings like job did amidst his the patience of the prophets james 5 verse 10 speaks about prophets being our examples for patience saying take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience examples abound of patient prophets that will strengthen your faith you probably heard that abraham waited 25 years between the time god promised him a son and the time when isaac was born the ark building prophet noah spent at least 55 years building the ark although he may have worked for up to 120 years either way god's warning to noah kept him patiently working for multiple decades on the ark to the saving of his house at 80 years old moses delivered israel out of the egyptian bondage but he first waited 40 years in midian after smiting an egyptian before god visited him at the burning bush have you considered the prophet hosea's patience after god commanded him to marry a harlot hosea's first thought may have been how can god ask me a distinguished holy prophet to marry a defiled filthy yet hosea faithfully obeyed endured the public shame trusting god's plan as he took gomer as his wife the lord said hosea's wife had to be a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms not only was gomer a but her family members were known for their whoredoms despite having three children together jezreel laura hama and loamy jose's patience was again tested when gomer left him and committed adultery living with another man but hosea was patient because he knew god ordained his marriage to represent unfaithful israel's constant rebellion and god's merciful forgiveness hosea followed the word of the lord and redeemed gomer out of slavery for 15 pieces of silver and barley to signify god's redeeming love through jesus christ laying his life down for both the lost sheep of israel and the other sheep the gentiles one final patience example is the prophet joseph son of jacob and rachel after being sold into slavery by his brothers at 17 years of age joseph faithfully served potiphar for 11 years before being falsely accused and imprisoned for trying to commit adultery with potiphar's wife while in prison the word of god came to joseph about the destinies of the butler and baker but the restored butler forgot to mention joseph to pharaoh finally after waiting two years joseph was released from prison when another interpretation came to him about pharaoh's dream regarding seven years of plenty and seven years of famine psalm 105 verse 19 says joseph was in prison until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him like joseph's life god's promised word always tries or tests believers scripture lists patience as the second step in the order to receive a promise from god first you must do the will of god obeying his command second you must be patient lastly you will receive the promise hebrews 10 38 validates this order saying for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise you and i must follow joseph's example along with all those faithful saints who have inherited god's promises hebrews 6 verse 12 states that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises character quality number six godliness second peter 1 verse 6 says and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and the patience godliness godliness is the sixth character trait the lord adds to your being during the second stage of sanctification this is the general measure or portion of godliness all christians receive before being born again by charity or the holy ghost the measure or character quality of godliness is distinct from the state of mature godliness the mystery of godliness paul writes about that jesus christ modeled for us by being completely loyal and obedient to every command of god figure 13 details this understanding in the third stage you will be most like god after being born again and experiencing years of learning and conforming to god's word you will most please and obey god after seasons of suffering for it is through suffering you will learn to obey god according to hebrews 5 verse 8 though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered christ suffered great temptations but learned to obey his father during those seasons the sufferings of god's son helped him declare the singular statement his holy lips alone could utter for i always do those things that please him figure 13 three stages and the stature of a perfect man first stage justification faith of the stature of perfect man second stage sanctification virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness in the statue of a perfect man third stage the baptism of the holy ghost charity in the statue of perfect man which produces the fruits of the holy spirit this stage is also known as adoption mature godliness one who has kept the faith or fought a good fight the fact that godliness is the sixth character quality is significant because it relates to man being created by god on the sixth day of creation according to genesis 1 verses 24 through 31 both sixes represent godliness upon god creating adam he immediately possessed godliness he was sinless with dominion over all creatures and over all the earth adam was so much like god as an amateur god by god's own design recognizing god's desire for adam to be godly you can understand god's desire for you to take dominion over your life paul says you have this spiritual right in romans 5 verse 17 because you reign in life by one jesus christ what do you specifically reign over demonic powers and temptations paul says you wrestle against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places your enemies are unseen demonic influences and you constantly defeat them through the whole armor of god as you cast down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ satan and his demons must flee from you as you quote god's word through your lips and refuse their temptations as you exalt god's word in your mind and obey his commands you subdue demonic powers and reign over sin the flesh the world and satan godly behavior towards sinners and enemies in his sermon on the mount the lord jesus christ teaches exactly what he requires for us to obtain godliness and it centers around how we treat sinners and unbelievers believers must reject the sin of irreverence toward sinners and unbelievers god is good to sinners and so must we do likewise to be perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect jesus asks us to love bless do good too and pray for our enemies muse on matthew 5 verses 43-48 ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate an enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them to curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth reign on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public and so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect being a christian anointed with divine godliness makes you compassionate towards the lost and unbelievers if you are like god you will hope for all men to be saved although you know few will be saved peter says god is not willing that any should perish while paul says god wishes all men to be saved ezekiel 33 verse 11 states clearly god does not delight in the death of sinners as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel examples abound of the righteous hoping and desiring for sinners to be saved which is a true expression of godliness paul says he had great heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart wishing he could be cursed instead of his israeli brethren who had rejected christ as messiah stephen the first christian martyr loudly asked jesus to lay not this sin to their charge as jews stone him to death our lord jesus during his crucifixion uttered forgiveness to his mockers as some of his final words before his death saying father forgive them for they know not what they do ezekiel 9 verses 1 through 11 records a remarkable instance of god sparing a small remnant of israeli believers from his wrath against jerusalem this faithful remnant was spared because they sighed and cried for all the abominations done in israel not only does true godliness separate you from fellowshipping with sinners and despising their choices but it also makes you weep and sigh in your private prayers to god godliness makes you so burdened and concerned about others destinies that you cry and plead with god to show mercy on the disobedient and unholy david experiences this burden in psalms 119 verse 136 saying rivers of water run down mine eyes because they have not kept thy law historically ezekiel's vision is fulfilled in second chronicles 36 verses 17-20 as nebuchadnezzar's babylonian forces slay many carry others away into slavery burn the house of god and break down the wall of the city the anointing of godliness is given so it can lead you to show mercy or pronounce judgment according to god's leadership but prepare to rule your heart by being slow to anger just as god is slow to anger in matthew 5 verse 7 jesus says blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy wisdom teaches you to begin with merciful gracious words for sinners and enemies there were times jesus was very harsh and judgmental towards sinners such as with the scribes and pharisees in matthew chapter 23 but christ's mercy and forgiveness is what we admire and worship him for paul god's minister to the gentiles issues harsh judgment but shifts to gracious mercy within a matter of a few sentences in second timothy 4 verses 14-18 the apostle says the lord will reward alexander the coppersmith for all the evil works he committed against him but two verses later praise for god to not lay a charge to those men who forsook him a godly person is so near to god's heart through constant prayer that god leads him to speak god's will in every situation godliness tells your heart to trust in and wait upon god before making a judgment for he has mercy on whom he will have mercy and delighteth in mercy character quality number seven brotherly kindness second peter 1 verse 7 says and to godliness brotherly kindness and to broadly kindness charity brotherly kindness is the seventh character trait the lord adds to your being during the second stage of sanctification this is the final character quality or portion of anointing christians receive before being born again by charity or the holy ghost the greek word for brotherly kindness is philadelphia meaning love of brothers or sisters the love which christians cherish for each other as brethren christianity puts a great emphasis on serving its members as paul says as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith our lord jesus says love among christians is the primary way sinners will recognize christians are jesus's true disciples you are a true disciple of jesus when you fervently love other christians brotherly kindness is the last character quality before a christian is born again and makes him focus on his christian brothers and sisters more than himself it is as if god is saying i've graciously built you up into a godly spiritual being but before i officially adopt you into my family by the seal of the holy ghost i'm giving you brotherly kindness so you will serve and love my other children i have adopted god is not going to birth a child into his kingdom without first adding brotherly kindness for that person would not be kind to the rest of the body of christ it's easy to see why christians must reject the sin of selfishness in order to receive the anointing of brotherly kindness jesus prophesies love among mankind is going to continually decrease as his second coming approaches matthew 24 verse 12 says and because iniquity shall bound the love of many shall wax cold you will see less and less brotherly kindness in the world iniquity and unconfessed sins are causing love to decrease paul prophesies where love is being directed in the last days saying men will be lovers of their own selves and lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god but paul also prays for an increase in love among christians that you can fulfill in first thessalonians 3 verse 12 and the lord make you to increase and bound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you let the world decrease its love while you choose to increase your brotherly love locating and living for your christian family the character trait of brotherly kindness inspires a believer to locate and live for his christian family locating and joining a christian church family is an important part of serving god jesus modeled faithful church attendance for christians to imitate according to luke 4 verses 14 through 17 christ's custom or habit was to be in the synagogue on the sabbath day make it your custom to be gathered in public worship with other christians every sunday as modeled by paul and the ephesians in acts 20 verse 7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight just as every sheep needs a flock and a shepherd every christian needs a church family and pastor jesus was moved with compassion when he saw multitudes of people without pastors and urged his disciples to pray for the lord to send laborers into his harvest shortly after his resurrection and ascension to heaven jesus sent five preaching gifts to the church one of which is the pastor along with the preaching gifts of the apostle prophet teacher and evangelist the pastor gift benefits the church by equipping its members for their individual ministries teaching precise truth and promoting unity the fivefold preaching ministry also protects believers from immaturity doubt hesitation and deception you can live for your christian church family in at least five ways first broadly kindness moves believers to meet the physical needs of other christians the early christians provided daily food for poor widows and james says genuine faith moves a true christian to provide clothes and food for needy christians meeting physical needs is such a heartfelt act in jesus sight that he will grant eternal life as a reward for individuals who demonstrate six different acts of compassion upon his brethren or other christians according to matthew 25 verses 31-46 in philippians 2 verses 3 and 4 paul teaches christians to have a lowliness of mind so they can esteem others better than themselves this humility causes us to look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others brotherly kindness causes you to consider others needs more important than your own as you train your eyes to focus on others more than yourself second broadly kindness promotes radical forgiveness towards fellow christians matthew 18 verses 21-35 details jesus's attitude towards forgiveness peter asked jesus if he should forgive his brother seven times but christ says to multiply that estimate by seventy after this astounding news peter and the rest of the apostles say lord increase our faith in luke's parallel passage in matthew 18 the parable of the unmerciful servant follows and jesus teaches us god's forgiveness of our sin debts are so great that we should freely forgive those who sin against us because their sin debts are tiny in comparison the divine lesson is to continually forgive your brother and sister just as christ continually forgives you all your trespasses paul's letter to philemon expresses paul's request for philemon to offer generous forgiveness to onesimus philemon's former slave onesimus had been an unprofitable servant to philemon and owed him money while wronging him paul writes that he led onesimus to salvation in christ and the new convert is now profitable for both men the apostle implores philemon to receive onesimus as a brother laying any debt on paul's account which he promises to repay to philemon when you offer a brother or sister a second chance you are expressing brotherly kindness thirdly increasing the number of gatherings with christians is an attribute of brotherly kindness in hebrews 10 verses 24 through 25 paul teaches us to assemble ourselves together so much the more as he see that day approaching during our increasing number of visits christians will provoke or stimulate each other to do good deeds and provide exhortation or encouragement additionally seek to spend time with the least esteemed or less popular christians paul pens romans 12 16 saying be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits when you're at a church fellowship find the ones who have no one to talk to and begin pleasant conversations with them you can also host your own fellowship and jesus promises to bless you when you invite the poor the maimed the lame the blind because they cannot repay you fourth christians offer broadly kindness with impartiality regardless of socioeconomic status carnal christians exalt rich church members above the poor members but james tells christians it's a sin to be partial to rich christians who have expensive jewelry and clothing by offering them comfort and rest with the best seats while making others stand in a church assembly fifth broadly kindness leads christians to pray for one another ephesians 6 verse 18 says a fully armored christian is praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints pray for all christians near and far when you hear of christians suffering persecution you feel their pain and care enough to pray for them first corinthians 12 verses 25 and 26 reads that there should be no schism in the body but that the member should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it to conclude brotherly kindness notice it is the seventh and last trait before charity caps off your being seven is a scriptural number representing completion and in this case brotherly kindness signifies a christian's complete sanctification or cleansing psalm 12 verse 6 teaches complete purification comes through seven steps the words of the lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven times brotherly kindness completes your purification as you graduate to charity the baptism of the holy ghost character quality number eight charity second peter 1 verse 7 says and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity charity is the eighth and final character trait the lord adds to your being as you enter the third and final stage of your christian walk resistance is the sin you must reject to receive charity as stephen said in acts 7 verse 51 ye do always resist the holy ghost this section is purposely shortened because the proceeding chapter is fully devoted to the third stage or baptism of the holy ghost see figure 13 although this is the last stage is the greatest stage because you experience sealing adoption fruit bearing and a state of mature godliness the first two stages justification and sanctification prepare you for service the third stage puts you into service the greek word for charity is agape meaning brotherly love affection good will love benevolence agape love is a greater love than brotherly kindness it's a permanent portion of god's divine love living in you in fact it is a larger measure of god's own spirit coming down to live inside your soul because first john 4 8 says god is love follow these next thoughts to understand how god love the baptism of the holy ghost and charity are all synonymous god is the holy ghost because jesus says god is a spirit or ghost and there is only one spirit the holy ghost is jesus's promise to his disciples in acts 1 verse 5. for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence jesus originates the baptism of the holy ghost doctrine furthermore the baptism of the holy ghost is love because paul says the love of god is shed abroad in your hearts by the holy ghost peter supports paul's claims saying this promise of the father or baptism of the holy ghost promised by jesus was shed forth on the day of pentecost in acts 2 verse 33 both love and the holy ghost were shed forth on the day of pentecost because they are one and the same the entire chapter of first corinthians 13 describes the effect of charity or love or the baptism of the holy ghost upon your soul since charity is the last character quality the eighth out of eight charity is the marking or sealing of christ's character inside your being called a seal in three scriptures second corinthians 1 verse 22 ephesians 1 verse 13 and ephesians 4 30. the eighth character quality seals god's spirit of love into your being specifically into your soul the person of love jesus christ now abides in your soul because you've been conformed into christ's image and learned to love and serve both enemies and god's family having the baptism of the holy ghost seals the previous seven character qualities into your soul faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness you are finally ready to start living the longer you live in obedience the more mature godliness you will manifest in your flesh three stages or works of grace figures 11 and 12 show how the three stages of israel's journey from egypt to the promised land is allegorical to the christian's journey from faith to the baptism of the holy ghost or charity the three stages have also been called the three works of grace in some christian circles while works of grace may sound like a contradiction the bible teaches that god's grace causes christians to work for god the three works are god's works in a surrendered believer the believer simply surrenders or yields to god's works as paul says in philippians 2 13 it is god which worketh in you a repentant christian recognizes god's goodness making him love god this love motivates faith in god and faith produces works second corinthians 6 verse 1 says we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain paul urges you to work with god not alone in fact god cannot work through a human without him allowing it through submitted free moral agency if god alone is working then humans are mere choiceless robots but you know that's not the case it is also implied christians work because they have received the gift of grace an individual claiming to be a christian without works has not truly received god's grace paul again says he did not receive god's grace in vain in first corinthians 15 verse 10. as humbly as possible paul says he worked more than all the apostles including peter and james he attributes his vast works to grace being with him saying but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me grace god's unmerited favor to you has always been and always will be your pure source of motivation figure 14 shows eight examples of the three works of grace throughout scripture including man's natural birth and spiritual birth israel's exodus from egypt israel's three-quart tabernacle the earth's cleansing ezekiel's new heart prophecy stages of the wheat plant see chapter eight and jesus as the way to heaven three is god's number of divine perfection in design and these examples showcase god's perfect design in processes figure 14 the process of man's natural birth water breaks blood breath of life the process of man's spiritual birth justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost israel's exodus leaving egypt wilderness promised land cleansing outer court holy place house of holies earth's cleansing noah's flood jesus blood fervent heat ezekiel's prophecy new heart new spirit my spirit or god's spirit growing wheat plant blade ear full corn jesus as the way to heaven way truth life growing in the stature of a perfect man the seventh example in figure 14 identifies the three stages of growth in the wheat plant taught by jesus in his parable of the seed cast in the ground in mark 4 verses 26-29 notice how the three stages in the wheat's maturity match the three stages to christian maturity justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost the lord jesus emphasizes the seed grows up without man knowing how in mark 4 verse 27 it is man's duty to plant and water the seed but it is god who gives the increase the same is true with the gospel i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase so that neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase no man causes his own spiritual increase in other words you cannot add any character quality to yourself such as temperance at your own will you must confidently trust in god's growing process just as a farmer does your job is to accept each of god's promises by planting each promise in your heart believe god will add faith then virtue and the rest of the character qualities then water every seed promise with prayer praise bible reading and thanksgiving in the right season you will see the faith blade then the ear of virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness last that you'll experience the baptism of the holy ghost or full corn at the right time ecclesiastes 3 verse 11 declares he hath made everything beautiful in his time knowing your spiritual location god has given you the three works of grace and peter's eight steps to the statue of a perfect man so you can assess your current spiritual location by prayerfully examining your life you can know whether you are in the first second or third work of grace paul commands examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves the apostle admonishes you to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling god did the same thing with israel in reference to israel's three-stage exodus god told both moses and the people he was going to take them out of egypt and into the promised land of canaan the sinai peninsula lay between egypt and canaan god was going to use the wilderness of shur the wilderness of sinai and the wilderness of paran to test israel's trust in him the lord declared he led israel through the wilderness to humble and prove them whether they would obey him or not and so they would know to live by every word of god the promised land journey was a three-stage process at all times moses and the people could easily assess their physical location and how close they were to their destination so can you know at all times your spiritual location in christianity are you in the first stage seeking to be saved out of the world like israel was saved out of egypt then you can repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins god will bring you through the red sea as you joyfully dance at the sight of all your dead taskmasters or sinful addictions are you in the second stage having already been saved and baptized but going through the wilderness of sanctification being daily tested and tried as you learn to obey then you can examine the six character qualities of sanctification virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness to assess which ones you need added to your life ask jesus for his character traits free offers and all these things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive are you in the third stage being born again of god's spirit and already endued with power from on high then obey hebrews 12 1 laying aside every weight of sin that easily besets you and run the race set before you with patience serve god wholeheartedly die to your human desires daily abide in christ the word and bring forth much fruit of the holy ghost based upon jesus teaching that few will find the narrow road to eternal life in matthew 7 14 most people will start the christian journey but not finish like israel leaving egypt many will be baptized but will wander in the wilderness never possessing the promised land or baptism of the holy ghost there is no need for christians to wander aimlessly in religion the stature of a perfect man divinely outlines our journey from sinner to holy ghost-filled saint out of the original group of israelis who left egypt only two made it to canaan joshua and caleb scripture says the majority of them died in the wilderness for their rebellion after god saved them out of egypt jude 1 5 says i will therefore put you in remembrance though he once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believe not if you feel stranded in a rut or you're wandering from church to church get down to business with god examine the stature of a perfect man assessing your true character by the word you will find your next step as you honestly examine your life through meditation as david thought upon his ways he turned his feet to god's path psalm 119 verses 58 through 60 reads i entreated thy favor with my whole heart be merciful unto me according to thy word i thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies i made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments you can do the same it only requires an honest and good heart jesus teaches but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience jesus's twelve apostles and the stature of a perfect man jesus 12 apostles are prime examples of believers working their way up the stature of a perfect man by grace and serve as measuring sticks for our lives the four gospels reveal the apostles journey from faith to brotherly kindness in unflattering ways at times so we might relate to and learn from them the book of acts details the moment they receive charity acts 2 verse 4 the baptism of the holy ghost and its effects upon their lives here are examples proving that jesus disciples were saved but not born again until the holy ghost fell in acts chapter 2. faith the disciples believed jesus was the messiah and their faith led them to forsake family and careers to follow christ virtue the disciples possessed virtue allowing them to go into cities two by two publicly preaching and healing before jesus visited the cities but they all lost their virtue on the night of jesus arrest being scattered like sheep through fear of arrest excluding judas iscariot the eleven disciples and peter in particular never lost their faith because jesus prayed that their faith would fail not knowledge while most jews misunderstood jesus's parables and teachings the disciples assured jesus they understood them but the disciples lacked understanding about how men are defiled the leaven of the doctrine of the pharisees and sadducees and jesus's resurrection temperance the disciples exercised exemplary self-control over their sensual desires but ten disciples did become indignant against james and john when their mother asked jesus if her two sons could sit on his right and left hand patience the twelve apostles patiently stayed with jesus after many of his disciples forsook him knowing christ had eternal life but the disciples hastily asked jesus to send away the woman of canaan who repeatedly cried for jesus to heal her vex daughter which request jesus miraculously fulfilled godliness jesus extinguished james and john's ungodly desire to call fire down from heaven upon the christ rejecting samaritans peter violently cut off malcus's ear trying to defend jesus proving he had not received love for his enemies brotherly kindness multiple times the disciples lacked brotherly kindness such as when they argued about which of them was greatest forbade a brother from casting out devils because he didn't follow the twelve and forbade their christian sisters from bringing their infants and toddlers to jesus peter struggled with jesus's requirement to forgive his brother seventy times more than he had first estimated charity after his resurrection jesus breathed on his disciples urging them to receive the baptism of the holy ghost christ used the 50 days from his resurrection to pentecost to rebuild the disciples character giving them many infallible proofs of his resurrection for the first forty days and then letting them pray for the final 10 days in the upper room until they were in one accord love or charity fell into the disciples souls in the day of pentecost paul says the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us joseph's life and the stature of a perfect man joseph son of jacob and rachel displayed and foreshadowed the statue of a perfect man in the old testament because he was a type of christ and christ's life expressed the complete mystery of godliness joseph's life both displayed the first seven steps and foreshadowed the eighth step the statue of a perfect man john 7 verses 37-39 teaches old testament saints like joseph could not receive the baptism of the holy ghost eighth step because jesus had not yet been raised from the dead joseph's character qualities are seen in the following examples faith joseph's faith trusted god's way for his life as he unashamedly shared his dreams with his family in genesis 37 verses 5-11 virtue joseph's virtue or moral strength in slavery causes daily work to prosper in potiphar's house genesis 39 verses 1-3 knowledge joseph's knowledge or understanding helped promote him to overseer of all potiphar's possessions in his house and field genesis 39 verses 4-6 temperance joseph's temperance kept him from committing adultery with potiphar's wife despite her daily seductions genesis 39 verses 7-20 patience joseph's patience or contentment allowed him to prosper while waiting in prison for two full years until the butler remembered him and informed pharaoh of joseph's spiritual gift of interpretation in genesis 41 verses 1-13 godliness joseph's godliness made him so much like god that pharaoh knew god's spirit was in joseph after god gave him the interpretation of pharaoh's dreams in genesis 41 verses 14 through 57 brotherly kindness joseph's brotherly kindness led him to freely forgive his brothers for selling him into slavery because he recognized god used their actions to save the world from famine genesis 45 verses 1-15 charity joseph lovingly embraced his father jacob when he came to abide with him in egypt genesis 46 verse 29 this father son embraced foreshadowed christians uniting with their loving father or charity for father god is love recall from chapter 2 that the number 8 has a significant meaning in scripture speaking of a new beginning this chapter highlights the eight steps in the statue of a perfect man that lead to a new beginning as paul says any man who is in christ is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new a born-again holy ghost-filled christian is a new creature living a new life of divine power the rewards for receiving the revelation of godliness those who receive the revelation of godliness will be rewarded with spiritual fruitfulness in this life and an entrance into the heavenly kingdom second peter one verse eight says if these eight character traits are abounding in your life you will be fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ you will produce the precious christian fruit god desires as you daily express faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity with the world around you the longer you express these eight character qualities the more spiritual fruit you will see god produce in your life love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance chapter 8 details the fact that spiritual fruitfulness is your goal because it is the only kind of heart that bears and brings forth fruit unto god peter further states if you do these things the eight character traits you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ heaven's door will open for you like it did for john in revelation 4 verse 1. after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will shoot thee things which must be hereafter do these things peter wrote do faith do virtue do knowledge do temperance do patience do godliness do brotherly kindness do charity take action upon god's word to assure you'll never fall having done these eight things you'll possess christ-like character in your human spirit and soul which is the only thing you are taking with you to the next life first timothy 6 7 says for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we carry nothing out your hands won't carry anything out of this world but you will be adorned in white raiment as you leave this world in revelation 3 verse 18 jesus says this white raiment or eternal life is available now your character or life must come from jesus christ and it comes through these eight character traits paul says the souls of sinners will be found naked when they die for they possess not eternal life or christ-like character your character produced good works inspired by love and grace will meet you at the judgment paul says this in first timothy 5 verses 24 and 25 some men sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some men they follow after likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise cannot be hid either now or later your good works will be known the opposite is true for sinners but god records all good works in the book of life and there is a book of remembrance listing the names of those who feared him meditated on his word and constantly talked about him on earth malachi 3 verse 16 reads then they that feared the lord spake often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name perhaps the angel who visited cornelius gazed upon these heavenly books for he told him thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before god choose godliness and heaven will rejoice in your good works the consequences for rejecting the revelation of godliness the most serious consequence for rejecting godliness is living a life of ungodliness resulting in suffering the wrath of god after judgment day in the lake of fire an entrance into the everlasting kingdom of christ will not be granted to the ungodly individuals can still be saved even if they reject the revelation of godliness faith alone is required for salvation as seen in both the old and new testaments while under the final moments of the old testament the saved thief on the cross received salvation by grace through faith from christ himself in the new testament paul declares a believer can be saved even after being excommunicated from a christian assembly for pridefully committing sexual immorality of course the excommunicated would be driven to saving repentance before his death through the god-permitted destruction of the flesh at the hands of satan second peter 1 verse 8 teaches baroness and unfruitfulness are consequences to rejecting godliness a barren christian is one who is inactive in the work of god in the greek barrenness also means idleness jesus compares barren or idol persons as those standing in a marketplace who have not begun to toil in a vineyard without the stature of perfect man you are wasting your life instead of investing it in laboring for the lord of the harvest jesus christ regarding unfruitfulness matthew 13 verses 3 through 9 and verses 18 through 23 shows there are four heart reactions to the gospel of christ see chapter eight three reactions bring forth no fruit letting satan quickly snatch the word from your heart believing the word for only a while before abandoning it and allowing cares and pleasures of the world to stop god's word from yielding fruit only the heart that hears the word and understands it is fruitful peter goes on to say a man without godliness is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins spiritual blindness occurs when a heart is hardened to truth and refuses repentance and the healing benefits of the holy spirit blinded eyes see only this earth because they are set on worldly pleasures rather than heaven above paul admonishes you to set your affection on things above not on things on the earth you are racing to heaven looking under jesus the author and finisher of our faith as you gaze upon jesus he tells you to continue adding his eight character qualities placing your eyes upon sin and selling out jesus's words can cause you to lose some or all of your character qualities just as judas sold out christ and fell from his bishopric those without godliness even forget they were purged from old sins peter again explains this phenomenon saying dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul frequent submission to fleshly lusts rather than the holy ghost creates a war against your soul your confused mind doesn't know if your soul is saved because your constant indulgence in fleshly lusts makes you feel like the flesh is winning the war additionally the longer a person wanders in the wilderness of sanctification without moving forward to the baptism of the holy ghost like israel's self-imposed 40-year wilderness wandering the more distant their forgiveness seems this magnifies the necessity of the eight character traits especially the power of temperance to mortify sensual cravings however the obedient or not forgetful of christ's forgiveness what a precious memory you have recalling the day you experienced christ's purging power that separated you from your sins as far as the east is from the west just like israel re-hearing the memory of supernaturally crossing the red sea you can rehearse crossing over from sinner to saint at the foot of jesus's cross conclusion the immensity of this chapter signifies god's immense desire for you to experience godliness just as god drew israel to himself in loving kindness god is patiently and lovingly drawing you to receive his divine character qualities take heed to paul's suggestion about your salvation work out your salvation with fear and trembling nothing could be more important than being assured of your salvation or your spiritual condition search the scriptures daily and pray earnestly to your heavenly father for his help to yield your will to him as you serve god rather than sin god wants you to be like him he says be holy for i am holy he has made the way for you to manifest true godliness in your flesh just as jesus christ manifested god in the flesh without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh follow the stature of a perfect man and grow in grace and knowledge of our lord jesus christ action steps to godliness step one be sure you have the rock solid foundation of genuine faith in the shed blood of jesus expressed by being baptized fully immersed in water in the name of the lord jesus christ contact me if you need to be baptized or re-baptized in christ's literal name step 2 prayerfully examine your actions and habits to see which character qualities you have and which you are lacking and ask the lord to add those attributes to your being as you reject the corresponding temptation at each step on the stature of a perfect man jesus says if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him step 3 once you're born again live boldly and faithfully for christ jesus and you'll see the fruits of the spirit begin manifesting in your life chapter 11 details the bible's instructions on how you can be certain you are doing god's perfect will for your life
