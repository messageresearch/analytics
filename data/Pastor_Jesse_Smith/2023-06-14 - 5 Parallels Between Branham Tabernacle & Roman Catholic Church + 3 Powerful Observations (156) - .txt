TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in all godliness and sincerity has anyone else noticed the similarities between the Roman Catholic church and Branham Tabernacle one of the Saints shared this with me and I agree with five of these parallels and also three other observations the first parallel is the Vatican is the adored headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church and this is the easiest parallel to see perhaps because Jeffersonville is the adored headquarters of Branham Tabernacle the second parallel is with the leader of the church the leader of the Roman Catholic Church is the pope he's the current living representative of Christ supposedly of course we know he's not and the Pope's every word is to be believed and followed the parallel to the Pope in the Branham Tabernacle is their pastor and he's the current living representative of brother Branham and they consider their Pastor to be a prophet just like brother Branham and their pastors every word is to be believed and followed the third parallel is with Mary according to Roman Catholic Doctrine Mary is a mediatrix between Jesus and Mankind and as any honest person knows the Roman Catholic Church focuses more on Mary than they really do on Jesus and friends the obvious parallel to this is Brother Branham Branham Tabernacle literally exalts brother Branham to being co-equal with Jesus because they claim every word on brother Brown's tapes is thus saith the Lord Brenham Tabernacle meditates on brother Branham and his voice and so their real focus is on brother Branham and not Jesus some of the Branham Tabernacle members even say brother Braham did more miracles than Jesus which is a misunderstanding of what brother Branham said as we cannot forget John 21 verse 25 where John said he supposed even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written about Jesus the fourth parallel is with the Roman Catholic church praying to their Saints and of course brother Rand taught this was spiritualism trying to contact dead people the parallel with Branham Tabernacle is that Brenham Tabernacle invites brother Branham to preach in their services they act like he's alive and they also let brother branham's tapes officiate weddings again acting like brother Branham is literally there officiating weddings so we see the parallel of spiritualism in both churches the fifth parallel is the message of unity the Roman Catholic Church tries to unify everyone around themselves citing the prayer of Jesus in John 17 verses 21-23 that they all may be one even as We Are One Branham Tabernacle does the same thing they try to unite all the message Believers around themselves on Branham tabernacle's blog post they frequently say that the only thing we can unite on as message Believers is believing that brother Brandon was God's voice but what they're really saying is that everyone must follow the tape worship of Branham Tabernacle and how they say just push play put brother randoms tapes before the fivefold ministry three other powerful observations are first at least the Catholics only claim the Pope's words are thus saith the Lord when he speaks from Saint Peter's Basilica but Jeffersonville says the tapes are word for word thus saith the Lord the word of God this proves Jeffersonville worships brother Branham more than the Catholics worship the Pope it's hypocrisy to point at Catholicism and its dangers while ignoring the idolatry in Jeffersonville a second powerful observation is that both Catholics and Branham Tabernacle use the word essence to teach their false doctrines first Catholics say each of the three persons of the Trinity has the same Essence well that's a lie because three persons is not in the Bible but Branham Tabernacle also uses the word essence and says the tapes and the Bible are the same Essence which we know is not true because the tapes have mistakes as brother M said and brother Ram said the Bible has no mistakes the third and final observation is that both groups are man-made denominations past Catholic councils have said that no one can be saved outside of the Roman Catholic church and Pope Boniface the eighth said anyone who doesn't submit to the Pope's Authority is not saved random Tabernacle says something very similar they say anyone that is outside of their press play and Obey movement is a make-believer and an unbeliever and a Demus dear friends let's pray for the deceived people in the tape Church movement to repent and come to Christ
