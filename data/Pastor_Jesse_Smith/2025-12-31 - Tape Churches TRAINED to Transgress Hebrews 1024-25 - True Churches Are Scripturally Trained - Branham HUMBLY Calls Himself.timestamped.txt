[0:03] These people claim to believe every word
[0:05] that you say to be true, but they don't.
[0:08] They don't believe it. They are own
[0:10] actions prove that they don't. The
[0:12] gospel sounds in the purity of its word
[0:16] and of its manifestation.
[0:18] And still they don't get it. They can't
[0:22] understand it. They're not trained to
[0:24] that sound of the Bible. They're tr
[0:26] trained to some denominational creed
[0:28] instead of the sound of the Bible.
[0:31] Therefore, when the Bible sounds it out,
[0:32] they don't know what you're talking
[0:33] about.
[0:35] Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [music]
[0:39] Is God training his people to sit at
[0:43] home and not [music] physically attend
[0:44] church anymore? I believe the answer is
[0:46] no. And this video will rightly divide
[0:49] the word of truth from the Bible about
[0:51] church [music] attendance as well as
[0:53] quotes from God's true prophet, brother
[0:55] William Marin Brandham. So here's the
[0:57] outline for the video. We'll look at
[0:58] Bible teaching and brother Random quotes
[1:00] that agree with Bible teaching [music]
[1:02] regarding church attendance. And then
[1:05] second, we'll look at the possible
[1:06] origin of this false doctrine, which I
[1:08] believe is a doctrine of the nicotans to
[1:11] sit at home and not physically gather in
[1:14] church services. And then third, we'll
[1:16] look at quotes from brother Brandham
[1:18] that use the word training in them.
[1:22] So the first two verses that are very
[1:24] important are Hebrews 10:24 and 25. And
[1:27] let us consider one another to provoke
[1:28] unto love and to good works. So people
[1:31] that don't assemble are selfish because
[1:34] they're not considering others on how
[1:36] they can provoke them or stir them up to
[1:38] more love for God and each other and
[1:40] also to good works for God. Verse 25,
[1:43] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:44] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:46] is, but exhorting one another and so
[1:49] much the more as you see that day
[1:51] approaching. So the Bible asks us to do
[1:53] it more and more, gather together more
[1:54] with believers of like precious faith.
[1:57] And the Bible says we exhort one another
[1:59] when we do that. The word exhort means
[2:01] to comfort, to console, to encourage and
[2:05] strengthen. So people that sit at home
[2:08] like the current Brightham Tabernacle
[2:10] and don't physically attend church are
[2:13] losing out on consolation, comfort, and
[2:15] encouragement. No matter how much they
[2:17] tried to deny it, it's true because the
[2:19] Bible's true. The Bible is the absolute.
[2:22] And when you transgress the Bible, you
[2:24] are transgressing the very king of
[2:26] heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ. For he is
[2:28] the word. The Bible is the word of God
[2:31] on paper to us. This reminds me also of
[2:34] Matthew 15 here. Matthew 15:2 and3. Why
[2:38] do thy disciples transgress the
[2:41] tradition of the elders for they washing
[2:42] not their hands when they eat bread? But
[2:44] he answered and said unto them, why do
[2:46] you also transgress the commandment of
[2:48] God by your tradition? So it's been a
[2:50] tradition of the leaders of Brandham
[2:52] Tabernacle for many years, not just
[2:53] since 2020 when CO happened. Even before
[2:57] that, a lot of the leaders from Random
[2:58] Tabernacle did not physically attend
[3:00] church. That's been their tradition for
[3:02] decades. So for decades, the leaders of
[3:05] Brandham Tabernacle would not physically
[3:07] gather in a home church, but then around
[3:09] 2015 to 2020, they did. But now we see
[3:12] from March 2020 to the present here,
[3:14] 2026, they failed to physically gather
[3:17] in church. So that's their tradition.
[3:19] It's a tradition of man. It's not a
[3:21] tradition of God. And then Luke 4:16,
[3:24] "And he came to Nazareth where he had
[3:25] been brought up. And as his custom was,
[3:27] he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath
[3:29] day and stood up for to read. So the
[3:31] custom of God in flesh, the custom of
[3:34] Emmanuel, Jesus Christ, the almighty God
[3:38] in flesh, was to go to the synagogue on
[3:40] the Sabbath. So he would go to the
[3:42] synagogue every Saturday. But we know
[3:44] according to Acts chapter 20, the church
[3:46] gathers now on the first day of the
[3:47] week, Sunday. So if Jesus was here, he'd
[3:50] go to church every Sunday just like he
[3:52] went to church every Saturday. Now
[3:54] friends, there also is a truth that the
[3:55] early church did meet for church
[3:57] services in individual houses. Like
[3:59] Romans 16:5 says, "Likewise, greet the
[4:02] church that is in their house." 1
[4:04] Corinthians 16:19, "Aquil and Priscilla
[4:07] salute you much in the Lord with the
[4:09] church that is in their house." But this
[4:12] is a different kind of house church than
[4:13] Brenham Tabernacle. Brethren Tabernacle,
[4:15] they stay in their own separate houses.
[4:17] They don't gather multiple families in
[4:19] one house. So they're not following the
[4:21] biblical pattern. And of course as time
[4:24] went on and we moved into the Leodysian
[4:26] church age, the industrial revolution.
[4:28] Now we have the ability to build
[4:30] churches. And so brother Bram's custom
[4:32] during his life was to physically gather
[4:34] in the church, not sit at home and press
[4:36] play. Brother Ram never did that.
[4:38] Brother Ram never taught that. The Bible
[4:40] never taught that. So anyone who does
[4:42] that is transgressing the word of God.
[4:44] All these Bible verses that we've read
[4:45] so far by the grace of God. Friends,
[4:48] last year I put out numerous videos
[4:49] about physically gathering in church and
[4:52] how the current Brandham tabernacle
[4:54] breaks all those commandments from the
[4:56] Bible and commandments from God's
[4:58] prophet, Brother Brandham. Brother Ram
[5:00] said the awfulst cult won't go to church
[5:02] and won't work. Well, it seems like
[5:04] Brandham tabernacle people still work.
[5:06] But the other element to that awful
[5:08] cult, that cult mentality is not
[5:11] physically attending church. So, they're
[5:13] guilty of that. It's an awful cult.
[5:15] There's the quotes from brother Brandham
[5:17] where he says you cannot be as good of a
[5:19] Christian if you stay at home and don't
[5:21] physically go to church. He said it's
[5:23] like saying you're hungry but you won't
[5:25] go to the table to eat. That's what
[5:26] brother Ram said physically attending
[5:28] church is like. Well, you say I want to
[5:31] hear the word of God. I want to hear the
[5:32] purest form of the word of God. I want
[5:33] to hear the voice of God. But you won't
[5:35] go to the table. You won't go to the
[5:37] local church to hear the preaching of
[5:39] the word of God because faith only comes
[5:41] by hearing the word of God. Brother
[5:43] Graham said, "If the preaching won't pep
[5:44] you up, nothing will." And that was
[5:47] preaching by living men preaching the
[5:49] living word of God in the five-fold
[5:51] ministry. Keep the quote in context.
[5:53] That preaching was not pressing play and
[5:55] obey and sitting at home transgressing
[5:57] the command of God. And I love what
[5:59] brother Ram said in Christ is the
[6:00] mystery of God revealed, "If God is in
[6:01] your heart, you can't hardly wait for
[6:03] them doors to open out yonder to get in
[6:05] there to fellowship with your brothers."
[6:07] That's exactly what Hebrews 10:24 and 25
[6:10] says and brother Ram will later quote
[6:12] that verse in this quotation. So the
[6:14] question is, is God in the heart of the
[6:17] members of the current Brandom
[6:18] Tabernacle? Cuz brother Brandham said,
[6:20] if God's in your heart, you can't wait
[6:21] for the doors to open. [clears throat]
[6:23] So we can wonder that. Is God in their
[6:25] heart? It doesn't seem like it, but God
[6:27] is the judge. If God was in your heart,
[6:29] you'd long for the church doors to open
[6:30] and go fellowship with your brothers and
[6:32] sisters and of course hear the word of
[6:34] God preached by the living five-fold
[6:35] ministry. As brother Random modeled in
[6:38] his life during his lifetime, brother
[6:40] Ram said in a thinking man's filter
[6:42] 1965, "As the days grow closer and
[6:45] closer, the narrowing of the path, we
[6:47] want to go closer together." He said,
[6:49] "Just sticking closer and closer as we
[6:51] see that day approaching." So he quotes
[6:53] Hebrews 10:24 and 25, assembling
[6:55] ourselves together all with one accord
[6:57] and one heart. He said, "Stay together.
[7:00] Don't never let one of you get away."
[7:03] So I thought this quote was thus sayith
[7:05] the Lord. Well, apparently not.
[7:06] Apparently, they have some thus lords
[7:08] that are more important than others at
[7:09] Brenham Tabernacle. They can transgress
[7:11] some commands, but then say they're
[7:13] keeping others. But of course, they're
[7:14] breaking many commands, at least 25, as
[7:16] the my video series shows. And remember,
[7:19] Brother Ram said this repeatedly, but he
[7:20] says it in the church age book. The
[7:22] church age messenger will preach the
[7:24] gospel exactly as God gave it to Paul,
[7:28] exactly in line with every word in the
[7:31] Bible. There is no Bible scripture that
[7:33] says right before the rapture, we're
[7:35] going to need to be trained and sit at
[7:37] home and press play and deny and also
[7:40] defy the five-fold ministry. Name call
[7:43] them, call them yunk, call them
[7:45] makebelievers, call them deus. There's
[7:47] no Bible scripture that says that. Yet,
[7:48] that's what Brandham tabernacle is doing
[7:50] because they don't really care about the
[7:52] Bible. The Bible's not their absolute.
[7:54] The tapes are their absolute, which is
[7:55] heresy and idolatry. So, friends, let's
[7:58] get to the second part of this. The
[7:59] possible origin. Where did this idea of
[8:02] training to transgress church attendance
[8:05] come from?
[8:06] Now, I'm open to correction on this, but
[8:08] it seems like it comes from the blog
[8:10] posts from Brenham Tabernacle. So, it
[8:13] seems like the current pastor Brennham
[8:15] Tabernacle was training the people to
[8:17] have home tape services well before CO,
[8:21] but then once CO hit, the state of
[8:24] Indiana cancelled their gatherings
[8:27] because they had more than 250 people.
[8:29] And this is from Brightham Tabernacles
[8:31] blog post. It says, "As you probably
[8:33] already know, the state of Indiana is
[8:35] requesting that gatherings of 250 people
[8:37] or gatherings which does not allow 6 ft
[8:39] distance for each person to be cancelled
[8:41] in order to prevent the corona virus
[8:44] from spreading. This includes churches.
[8:46] We can now see the beginning of why
[8:48] father has had us in training to have
[8:51] our home tape services. The bride cannot
[8:54] be separated as he united us around the
[8:56] message and is perfecting his bride."
[8:58] end quote. Now friends, I believe this
[9:01] is the wrong understanding. I know
[9:02] churches that were large churches,
[9:05] almost as big as Brandham Tabernacle,
[9:07] and they still gathered during
[9:08] Coronairus. They just made sure there
[9:10] was 6 ft between everyone. And then they
[9:13] rotated half of the church would come
[9:16] one Sunday and then the other half would
[9:18] come the next Sunday and they'd rotate
[9:20] it on Wednesday night as well. Half the
[9:21] church would come on this Wednesday
[9:23] night and then the next half would come
[9:24] on the next Wednesday night and so
[9:26] forth. So to me, this is an excuse not
[9:29] to gather more as you see that day
[9:30] approaching. When CO struck our church,
[9:32] I felt led just to cancel the Sunday PM
[9:35] service. We kept the Sunday A.M. service
[9:37] and I kept that for 50 days and then it
[9:39] just struck me 50 was Jubilee and after
[9:42] 50 days, no one had the Corona virus. So
[9:44] we resumed having our full services cuz
[9:48] the question becomes, do we obey God or
[9:50] man? And of course, we know the answer.
[9:52] We should obey God rather than man. And
[9:55] that was from March 14th, 2020. So that
[9:58] was when they stopped having services
[9:59] there and still to this day do not have
[10:02] physical services with preaching,
[10:04] singing, worship. Last year, one tape
[10:07] boy called me a liar because they said
[10:09] Brandham Tabernacle meets for prayer on
[10:11] Wednesday night. But he didn't say this.
[10:13] He didn't say that there's no singing
[10:16] and it's silent prayer and there's no
[10:17] preaching. So it's a silent prayer
[10:19] meeting. Maybe for an hour, who knows?
[10:21] Maybe less. But either way, that one
[10:23] meeting does not allow the whole church
[10:25] to come together. And it doesn't
[10:27] resemble the meetings that brother
[10:28] Brandham had during his lifetime. So
[10:31] they're not doing what brother Brandham
[10:32] did. They're not saying what brother
[10:33] Brandham said. And it certainly doesn't
[10:35] match the Bible where in Acts 20, the
[10:37] Bible said they met on the first day of
[10:39] week with preaching, feet washing, and
[10:41] so forth. So the truth is Brandon
[10:43] Tabernacle is not doing anything like
[10:45] the book of Acts Church and Brother
[10:47] Brandham's church while brother Random
[10:48] was alive. Another witness from the
[10:50] Brandom Tabernacle blog post is April
[10:53] 7th, 2020. It said, quote, "He has given
[10:56] us vindication after vindication that we
[10:58] are in his perfect will and that he is
[11:00] coming for us soon. He has trained us
[11:02] for this hour, friends, through our home
[11:04] tape services, home prayer meetings, and
[11:06] home Easter meetings as well." End
[11:08] quote. Now, friends, I'm not against
[11:10] praying in your home. You should pray in
[11:12] your home. You should listen to tapes in
[11:13] your home, but that does not replace
[11:15] physically gathering in the church
[11:17] building like brother Brandham did while
[11:19] he was alive. Now, the pastor went on to
[11:21] say, quote, "Which unites the bride is
[11:23] never before." End quote. Where did
[11:26] brother Brandham say, "The greatest
[11:27] uniting and uniting in the most powerful
[11:30] way would be at home." That's right.
[11:32] Brother Ram did not say that. So again,
[11:33] they're saying what Brother Ram did not
[11:35] say. Remember, Brother Ram said, "If God
[11:37] is in your heart, you can't wait for
[11:38] those church doors to open to worship
[11:40] with your brother and sister. And when
[11:42] does the Bible say we ought to obey man
[11:43] rather than God? The Bible says the
[11:45] exact opposite. So again, their folly is
[11:48] made manifest as the Bible said it will
[11:50] be. Now friends, I can understand during
[11:53] Coronairus, there was some time where we
[11:54] didn't know exactly what to do or how
[11:56] long this would last. But friends, how
[11:58] long is Brandham Tabernacle going to sit
[12:00] at home waiting for the rapture? Seems
[12:02] like they're waiting for the rapture.
[12:04] Are they going to spend their whole
[12:05] lives, the rest of their lives at home
[12:07] waiting for the rapture? What if the
[12:08] rapture doesn't come in their lifetime?
[12:10] And brother Ram said the rapture could
[12:11] be in 500 years. In taking sides with
[12:13] Jesus 1962, he said, "We don't know. It
[12:16] could be possible that it could be 100
[12:18] years from now. It could be 500 years,
[12:20] 1,000 years, 10,000 years. I don't know.
[12:22] Nobody knows." So Brandon Tabernacle is
[12:25] making it seem like the rapture is so
[12:26] close. So they're getting training for
[12:28] the rapture at home. But what if the
[12:30] rapture doesn't come in their day?
[12:32] They've missed out on years and years.
[12:34] And how long is this going to turn into
[12:35] decades of just sitting at home and
[12:38] disobeying the Bible, transgressing the
[12:40] scriptures about gathering more as you
[12:42] see that day approaching? And friends,
[12:44] we always thought it would be the
[12:46] government that would shut down Brandham
[12:48] Tabernacle and other churches, but it's
[12:50] actually Brandham Tabernacle that shut
[12:52] down itself because we know churches
[12:55] like ours, many message churches stayed
[12:57] open during CO. They just followed the
[12:59] guidelines. But Brandham Tabernacle shut
[13:01] their church doors and the church doors
[13:03] are still shut for regular worship
[13:05] services with singing, preaching,
[13:08] worshiping, praying, a regular normal
[13:10] church service as it was when brother
[13:12] Brandham was alive. So how deceived is
[13:15] this church if they shut their own
[13:16] doors? When brother Brandham taught it
[13:18] wouldn't be the church that would shut
[13:20] its own doors. It would be the
[13:21] government, the federation of churches
[13:23] that would shut our doors down. And
[13:25] friends, I found something recently
[13:27] while reading the church age book that I
[13:28] think applies here. Brandom tabernacle
[13:30] has gone from deeds of nickelians to
[13:33] doctrine of nicicoatans. At first, it
[13:35] was just a saying. Well, let's stay at
[13:37] home. Let's do training. But now it's
[13:38] the unbending way. That's the only way
[13:40] for what they say is the royal seed of
[13:43] Abraham to worship. So now it's the
[13:45] unbending way. And friends, it's a
[13:47] hybrid religion. As brother Ram said,
[13:49] when you take one step away from the
[13:50] word of God, when you take one step away
[13:52] from Hebrews 10:24 and 25, you've got a
[13:55] hybrid religion. As brother Ram said,
[13:58] it's on page 136 in the red church age
[14:00] book. This one by the grace of God. And
[14:03] then brother Bram says when the church
[14:05] gets away from the word, it will believe
[14:06] anything. It is like Eve. And friends,
[14:09] that's exactly what has happened in
[14:10] Brandham Tabernacle. They'll believe
[14:12] anything their pastor says or their
[14:14] associate pastor. When their pastor
[14:16] says, "Every word on tape is thus sayith
[14:18] the Lord," they believe it. When the
[14:19] pastor says, "Just sit at home, just
[14:22] press play, don't gather more as you see
[14:23] that day approaching," they believe it.
[14:25] When the pastor says, "I'm a minor
[14:26] prophet," they believe it. And yet, he's
[14:28] never spoken anything in the name of the
[14:30] Lord in advance of it being fulfilled.
[14:33] as brother Brandham called it, a test of
[14:34] a prophet. Their pastor claims to be a
[14:37] minor prophet, but has never even passed
[14:39] the initial test to be considered a
[14:41] prophet. As brother Bram taught out of
[14:43] Deuteronomy chapter 18, the Bible said
[14:46] they've turned away their ears from the
[14:47] truth and turned unto fables. As brother
[14:50] Bram quoted 2 Timothy 4 1-5.
[14:54] It's a fable to silence the five-fold
[14:56] ministry. It's a fable to say just sit
[14:59] down and press play. It's a fable to say
[15:01] as Brandham Tabernacle does that the
[15:03] angel who revealed the book of
[15:05] revelation to John was brother Brandham
[15:06] because brother Ram said there's no
[15:08] pre-existence of souls. That's a fable.
[15:10] It's a fable to say that brother
[15:12] Brandham has a living ministry today.
[15:15] The Bible said when Moses passed away,
[15:17] God went to Joshua and said my servant
[15:19] Moses is dead. Now it's your turn to
[15:21] minister. And that's the same thing that
[15:23] happened today. Brother Brandon passed
[15:25] away and now it's the five-fold
[15:27] ministry. It's their turn to pick up and
[15:29] preach the word of God, as one of my
[15:31] recent videos showed. Brother Ram said
[15:32] the young man could sweep this message
[15:34] on to the coming of the Lord if Jesus
[15:36] didn't come in his day. He said, "These
[15:39] men can make more sense of it and hope
[15:41] they would bring it to life."
[15:44] Brother Brandham said, "Some people have
[15:45] to fill our shoes as he and brother
[15:47] Neville were getting old." He didn't say
[15:48] they have to sit down and press play.
[15:51] They believe the fable that the tapes
[15:53] are the token. They believe the fable
[15:56] that going to a tape church is the
[15:58] evidence of the token. That's an
[16:00] absolute fable. But what can we expect
[16:02] friends? When you step away from the
[16:03] word of God, when you transgress the
[16:04] word of God, even on church attendance,
[16:07] you'll believe anything because you've
[16:08] got a deity spirit. You've also got a
[16:10] rebellious spirit. And now they'll
[16:13] believe anything. With the antichrist
[16:15] spirit that has moved from a deed of the
[16:18] nickel, a saying of the nickelans, now
[16:20] it's a doctrine of the nicicoatans. It's
[16:23] the unbending way. Everyone in their
[16:25] church or cult-like gathering has to
[16:28] follow the words of their leader. Now,
[16:31] we'll move here to the final section.
[16:33] Brother Brandham quotes on training
[16:35] because there are no quotes that say we
[16:37] need to sit at home to be trained for
[16:38] the rapture. So, again, Brandham
[16:40] Tabernacle is not saying what William
[16:42] Brandham said. And I don't have any
[16:44] particular order for these quotes. We'll
[16:46] just go through them as I laid them out
[16:48] here. Brother Ram said, "Anyone that
[16:50] changes the Bible is not trained to the
[16:52] sound of the Bible. They're trained to
[16:54] some denominational creed instead of the
[16:56] sound of the Bible." So, Current Brandom
[16:58] Tabernacle is trained to a
[17:00] denominational creed that says, "Sit at
[17:03] home and don't gather more as you see
[17:05] that day approaching." Let's play the
[17:06] quote.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; The gospel sounds in the purity of its
[17:10] word
[17:11] &gt;&gt; and of its manifestation,
[17:14] and still
[17:17] they don't get it. They can't understand
[17:19] it. They're not trained to that sound of
[17:22] the Bible. They're trained to some
[17:24] denominational creed instead of the
[17:26] sound of the Bible. Therefore, when the
[17:28] Bible sounds it out, they don't know
[17:30] what you're talking about.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Then in 1962, Brother Ram said, "God
[17:34] soldiers are trained to the word. They
[17:37] warn others that something is not in the
[17:39] scripture." So, I reached out to Joseph
[17:41] and Billy Paul personally. They were
[17:43] kind, but they rejected my attempts to
[17:46] bring correction to them. And so the
[17:48] love of God in my heart and many other
[17:49] people's hearts have tried to correct
[17:51] them over the years, but they won't
[17:52] receive it. But that's what God's
[17:54] soldiers do. They're trained to the word
[17:56] and they try to warn others when they're
[17:58] not obeying the scripture. Let's listen
[17:59] to the quote.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; That's the way God's soldiers are today.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; They're trained to the word.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; When anything comes up a little polish
[18:08] to it that's got something else that's
[18:10] not scripture, they warn their
[18:12] congregation.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anything that's not Bible,
[18:15] anything that's not it's not godlike,
[18:18] such as having soup suppers, dances, and
[18:21] everything else to pay off the pastors,
[18:24] &gt;&gt; those things are wrong.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; And as that quote said, see, we warn our
[18:27] congregations. We warn other
[18:29] congregations. That's what this video is
[18:31] all about and the video series that
[18:33] exposes the 25 lies coming out of
[18:34] Brandon Tabernacle. We're trying to warn
[18:36] others. Warn congregations.
[18:39] I love this quote from Taking Sides with
[18:41] Jesus, 1962. Brother Bram says, "I can
[18:43] show you the vision that I have for the
[18:45] future." Now, I have a separate video
[18:46] about this if you want to watch it, but
[18:48] Joseph said, "We've got to catch his
[18:50] vision. We've got to play the tapes."
[18:51] That's a denominational mandate. That's
[18:53] a lie.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; But they got to catch the vision. You
[18:58] got to play the tapes.
[19:01] You've got to
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram's vision was not to sit at
[19:05] home and press play. Brother Ram's
[19:07] vision was to train the young preachers
[19:09] by the elder preachers. And so that way
[19:12] more problems would be taken care of and
[19:14] then he could send out the young
[19:15] preachers when new churches sprung up.
[19:17] Let's listen to the quotes from Take
[19:18] Inside with Jesus.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Now we're going to start off with the
[19:22] early church and just bring it for about
[19:25] 5 minutes now down to what they did and
[19:27] then I can show you the vision that I
[19:29] have for the future.
[19:32] You brother out there with your little
[19:33] churches and uh you want to you're doing
[19:36] a work. God will reward you for that. Go
[19:39] out there, preach, do everything you can
[19:41] that all of you get together, you bunch
[19:43] of men that had meetings and talk on
[19:45] deep things of the scripture and pray
[19:49] and and then in there get training in
[19:52] your own groups, other ministers, man
[19:55] that you see that that has a calling in
[19:57] their life for the ministry. Train them
[19:59] young men. Bring them in here to the
[20:01] elder. All of you set together in a
[20:04] ministerial meeting and there teach the
[20:07] deeper things of God. Don't go on the
[20:08] bad end. Keep someone who you can have
[20:12] confidence in to be kind of like a a
[20:15] leader for you. And in there, churches
[20:18] can go here and training up a group of
[20:20] men. And if I'm in evangelistic work
[20:22] somewhere, there's places I can place
[20:25] them worldwide.
[20:27] What if I had a group of men, young men
[20:30] trained in the message?
[20:32] See, just say, "Now, wait a minute.
[20:36] Before I leave here, we're going to set
[20:40] in order these churches. I have a man
[20:43] I've already them. They got the money.
[20:45] They're on the road here right now to
[20:48] take over this.
[20:50] A good man, his two or three young men
[20:52] with him who will be his helpers and
[20:54] assistants. And a church of this state
[20:57] can be set there which will be a outpost
[21:00] in India, outpost in Germany, outpost in
[21:04] Switzerland. Well, right now we should
[21:06] have had them all around the nation.
[21:08] It's where I've been.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; And the message then from there comes
[21:12] another. From another comes another. See
[21:14] what I mean? And if you can get the
[21:17] preacher straight and him going, "Right,
[21:18] look what he's going to do. He's going
[21:20] to influence." It would take care of
[21:22] hundreds of these things. That's it.
[21:24] We're just beating that. You see, you
[21:26] got to get it a system. [clears throat]
[21:28] God's system, right? Uh Jethro said to
[21:32] Moses, "Well, you can't beat out all of
[21:34] them." Or, "And God put elders out
[21:38] there, 70 of them, and took the spirit
[21:41] with Moses and put him up on those 70
[21:44] elders, and they prophesied."
[21:46] &gt;&gt; And it didn't weaken Moses a bit and
[21:49] strengthened him. He had just as much
[21:51] prophecy in him as they did before they
[21:52] took the spirit off of them prophesy.
[21:54] See, he just separated his son out of
[21:56] Moses. Let them judge the smaller
[21:58] things. But when it comes to the just 70
[22:01] of them and took the spirit was on Moses
[22:04] and put him up on those 70 elders and
[22:07] they prophesied
[22:08] &gt;&gt; and it didn't weaken Moses a bit and
[22:10] strengthened him. He had just as much
[22:13] prophecy in him as they did before they
[22:14] took the spirit off him and prophesied.
[22:16] See, he just separated us out of Moses.
[22:19] Let them judge the smaller things. And
[22:21] but when it comes to the major things,
[22:23] you come in with them and help them like
[22:25] that. That's the way. That was God's way
[22:27] back there. That was God's way in the in
[22:29] the early church age and I believe it's
[22:32] God's way now,
[22:34] &gt;&gt; right? For us to do it. So, let's do it.
[22:37] Just quit talking about it and do it.
[22:40] That's all. We [clears throat] can do it
[22:41] by the grace of God. Don't you believe
[22:43] it?
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram also talked about this
[22:46] training in 1960. He said he had some
[22:48] offers for some churches if the young
[22:51] preachers wanted them. if you're ready
[22:53] to go be a pastor now, if you got your
[22:55] training. And then he said, "If you ever
[22:57] want to take a church or anything, let
[22:59] Brother Brandham know." Brother Ram did
[23:00] not train them to press play and obey
[23:02] because there's no quotes that say that.
[23:04] All the quotes say he wanted preachers
[23:06] that were older, training the younger
[23:08] preachers. And that lines up perfectly
[23:10] with the Bible. Let's listen to the
[23:11] quote.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; I got some offers for some churches if
[23:14] you all want them. [clears throat] If
[23:17] you're ready to go to pastor now, if you
[23:18] got your training and which I believe
[23:20] you have and you got all settled down, I
[23:23] got one in Oregon, some in Washington,
[23:26] California, and Arizona, different
[23:28] places. And if you want to ever take a
[23:30] church or anything, well, right here's a
[23:33] good place to start from, right?
[23:36] &gt;&gt; And there's souls crying everywhere,
[23:38] even to the Indian reservations and
[23:40] whatever you want to go to. Just let us
[23:42] know because I believe that you boys are
[23:44] anchored now. Amen.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; I just love to see him do that.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; Here's another quote that says, "In
[23:52] essence, the tape boys have no
[23:53] discernment." Brother Ram's talking
[23:55] about a form of godliness and denying
[23:56] the power thereof. He said, "If you've
[23:58] got spiritual discernment and the Holy
[24:00] Ghost is upon you, it says amen to every
[24:02] promise of God." What about the promises
[24:04] of God in Hebrews 10:24 and 25 that say
[24:07] we should assemble more, provoke one
[24:09] another to good works, exhort one
[24:11] another, encourage them, and then
[24:13] brother Ram quotes Hebrews 10:24 and2.
[24:16] But Ram said it ought to draw us
[24:18] together. The Bible said, "Assembling
[24:19] ourselves together, it ought to be one
[24:21] revival after another. Bonfires of God's
[24:24] glory built in every church and in every
[24:26] place." He didn't say built in every
[24:28] home as you sit at home and press play
[24:30] and disobey. He didn't say that. He said
[24:32] it's actually physically gathering a
[24:34] church as he quoted Hebrews 10:24 and2.
[24:37] Oh God have mercy on these tape
[24:38] worshippers. May they accept these
[24:40] quotes someday. As I told in another
[24:42] video, may the next generation in that
[24:44] tape church system recognize the folly
[24:47] of their parents and grandparents and so
[24:49] forth and pastors and leaders and may
[24:51] repent of that and follow and obey these
[24:54] quotes from God's prophet brother Renham
[24:55] that are quoting Hebrews 10:24 and2.
[24:58] Let's listen to the quote. having a form
[25:01] of godliness, but denying the power
[25:04] thereof,
[25:06] &gt;&gt; no spiritual discernment.
[25:09] When you got spiritual discernment and
[25:11] the Holy Ghost is upon you, you have
[25:13] spiritual discernment.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; It says amen to every promise of God.
[25:19] Paul said those days would be we got it.
[25:22] It's here. It's on us and we look and
[25:24] see it. We hear it from everywhere.
[25:28] What do we do? It ought to draw us
[25:31] together. The Bible said assem ourselves
[25:34] together. And that's the more when you
[25:35] see that day approaching.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; It ought to be one revival after another
[25:40] in bonfires of God's glory built in
[25:43] every church in every place.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; A great coming together where all the
[25:47] churches with one heart and one accord
[25:49] themselves together and forget their
[25:51] man-made theology and cry out to God for
[25:54] spiritual power
[25:56] &gt;&gt; and spiritual discernment. Amen.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; That's the hour we need.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram again talks about training
[26:02] ministers to go to churches and take
[26:04] over in a total deliverance. 1959,
[26:07] Brother Ram called it a great move of
[26:10] bringing up other ministers to go out
[26:12] into the fields to establish the faith
[26:14] and to have a minister ready, willing,
[26:16] and trained to take over. So, Brother
[26:18] Ram's talking about missionary work. And
[26:20] brother Ram said, "It's a great move of
[26:21] God when brother Brandham would go out
[26:22] in the missionary fields, start
[26:24] churches, and then he could have men
[26:26] trained that could take them over, not
[26:27] to press, play, and obey, but to preach
[26:29] the word of God, as brother Brandham
[26:31] modeled through his entire life." He
[26:33] never said press, play, and obey and sit
[26:35] at home and silence the preachers.
[26:36] Brother Ram said, "The most important
[26:38] thing is a preacher, a minister who
[26:40] knows how to rightly divide the word of
[26:42] truth." And then in that quote, brother
[26:43] Rand says, 'Lord, that out of it shall
[26:45] go ministers and evangelists and
[26:47] teachers and missionaries to all parts
[26:48] of the world. He does not pray for tape
[26:50] boys. He prays for preachers. Let's
[26:52] listen to the quote.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; May there be a fellowship in this
[26:56] church. Seeing that we're just about to
[27:01] emerge into some great move, we field of
[27:05] bringing up other ministers to go out
[27:08] into the fields of where if you shall
[27:11] send me into the different parts of the
[27:13] world there to establish the faith and
[27:17] to have a minister ready and willing and
[27:21] trained to take [clears throat] over.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And may the faith that was once
[27:26] delivered to the saints that we are
[27:28] gallantly standing for become a circle
[27:31] around the world. Grant it, Lord. And
[27:35] may this little weed pile as it was one
[27:38] day when we dedicated it to you. May
[27:41] there be a church rise up here, Lord.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; That out of it shall go ministers and
[27:47] evangelists and teachers and
[27:50] missionaries to all parts of the world.
[27:53] Right.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Lastly here in unbelief does not hinder
[27:55] God. 1962 brother Brandham said in the
[27:57] last days it's going to take a stand is
[28:00] a scriptural trained church on the line
[28:03] for there's going to be carnal
[28:05] impersonations rise. So true brother
[28:06] Brennham. We need scriptural trained
[28:09] churches that can recognize the carnal
[28:11] impersonations such as the tape church
[28:13] worship movement, the press play and
[28:15] disobey movement. Yes, a scriptural
[28:17] trained church will recognize that's a
[28:19] carnal impersonation that doesn't
[28:21] resemble the book of Acts. That goes
[28:23] against the book of Acts blueprint. And
[28:25] so it's a carnal impersonation. It's a
[28:27] hybrid religion. Brother Ram said, "And
[28:29] yet, if it's off the scripture, leave it
[28:31] alone." So anyone who tells you to sit
[28:33] at home and don't physically gather at
[28:35] church, leave them alone. No matter what
[28:37] kind of a sensation, no matter what they
[28:39] say, no matter what supernatural
[28:41] experiences they say happens to them
[28:43] while they're at home, what results you
[28:45] find out of it, if it isn't scripture,
[28:47] stay away from it. Stay right with the
[28:49] word. Yes. Amen, brother Brandham. will
[28:51] stay right with the word of God. No
[28:52] matter what carnal personations or
[28:54] sensation these tape worshippers say
[28:56] they're having, it's not a sensation
[28:58] that agrees with the Bible. Let's listen
[29:00] to the quote.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; In the last days, what is Tego to take
[29:03] the stand is a scriptural trained
[29:07] church.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; On the line
[29:12] for there's going to be carnal
[29:14] impersonations. Rise,
[29:17] &gt;&gt; right? The Bible said, "As Jambus and
[29:20] Jamis withstood Moses, so will these men
[29:23] of repbate mind concerning the truth."
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; And Jesus was the truth.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Thy word is the truth. Because in the
[29:33] beginning was the word, and the word was
[29:35] with God. And the word was made flesh
[29:37] and dwelt among them. Amen.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; And the word of God is more powerful
[29:42] than a two-edged sword, cutting to the
[29:45] son of the bone, and a discerner of the
[29:48] thoughts of the heart.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; We realize that we're in that day to
[29:55] where anything can look so real, but yet
[29:58] if it's off the scripture, leave it
[30:00] alone.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Right? No matter what kind of a
[30:03] sensation, what results you find out of
[30:06] it, if it isn't scripture, stay away
[30:09] from it.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Stay right with the word.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; In closing, friends, I hope this video
[30:18] was a blessing by the grace of God.
[30:19] Remember, Brother Ram said, "No matter
[30:21] what Brandham Tabernacle turns out to
[30:22] be, you be a follower of the word." He
[30:25] said, "Don't let it be you. You be a
[30:27] servant of Christ. No matter what the
[30:29] church world does, you be a servant of
[30:30] Christ. It's not up to the Brandham
[30:32] Tabernacle. Neither is it up to any
[30:34] churches. It's up to you as an
[30:36] individual to be ready at the coming of
[30:38] the Lord. Hallelujah, brother Brandham.
[30:41] And look what Brandham tabernacles
[30:42] turned out to be. 25 false teachings
[30:44] coming out of their church, sitting at
[30:46] home, isolating themselves away from the
[30:49] body of Christ, isolating themselves
[30:52] away from their brothers and sisters in
[30:54] Christ Jesus, not provoking each other
[30:56] unto good works. So no matter what
[30:58] sensations they have, no matter what
[31:00] apparent experiences they have, it's off
[31:02] the word of God. Stay away from those
[31:04] type of people. Stay away from hybrid
[31:06] religion. Remember friends, in humble
[31:08] thyself 63, brother said, "Don't forget
[31:10] this tabernacle will lose its strength."
[31:13] Remember that this is the target where
[31:14] Satan has got every gun in hell trained
[31:16] on it. He'll cause one person to do
[31:18] something that's contrary to what the
[31:20] other one thinks. He's doing that. He is
[31:21] up to that. That's his business. So
[31:24] friends, God's prophet told us these
[31:25] things. We can take everything back to
[31:27] the word of God. If any church is not
[31:29] saying exactly what the Bible says, what
[31:31] St. Paul said, they are off the word of
[31:33] God. They're either at the deeds of
[31:35] nickelans or if they've made it a
[31:37] doctrine, now they're at the doctrine of
[31:38] nicicoatans.
[31:40] So that's a form of the antichrist
[31:41] spirit. But we want to be led by the
[31:44] Holy Spirit. We want to be led by the
[31:45] Holy Ghost. How do we know we are?
[31:47] Because we're lining ourselves up with
[31:48] the word of God. Making ourselves ready,
[31:50] making sure everything we believe is
[31:52] thus sayith the Bible, the absolute.
[31:55] Friends, let's be a scriptural trained
[31:57] church. Let's stand against the carnal
[31:59] impersonations of the church world
[32:02] system. Leave it alone if anything is
[32:04] off the scripture. Stay right with the
[32:07] word. Yes, we'll do that in 2026 by the
[32:10] grace of almighty God. If you have any
[32:13] questions, concerns, or testimonies
[32:14] about this video, please contact me.
[32:18] God bless you and may Jesus [music]
[32:19] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[32:23] I'm very happy to be here this afternoon
[32:25] and again in defense of the gospel of
[32:27] Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings,
[32:31] the good news that Jesus raised from the
[32:33] dead, living among man today, his
[32:35] church. [music]
[32:36] The same Jesus that was yesterday will
[32:39] be today and forever. He's never failed.
