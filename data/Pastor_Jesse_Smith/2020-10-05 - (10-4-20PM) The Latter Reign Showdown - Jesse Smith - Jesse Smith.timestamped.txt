[25:43] [Music]
[26:00] let's go to the book of james here
[26:01] tonight i'd like to look at the latter
[26:03] rain
[26:04] and the showdown a little bit tonight
[26:06] i've preached a few things in the past
[26:08] about it i'd like to go a little deeper
[26:10] here tonight
[26:11] about god's grace book of james
[26:21] chapter 5 verse 7 james 5 verse 7.
[26:42] what a blessing to be a christian in
[26:43] this hour what a blessing
[26:46] uh the world through the lens of the
[26:47] word
[26:49] we have an eternal perspective we have a
[26:51] holy perspective
[26:52] and it's the greatest blessing that we
[26:54] have is to know jesus christ
[26:56] and see the world events world history
[26:59] everything through the lens
[27:00] of god's word praise god so james 5
[27:04] 7.
[27:08] it's uh just so beautiful that uh the
[27:10] new testament
[27:12] also validates that the latter rain is
[27:15] what we are waiting for
[27:18] we know the old testament says it
[27:20] brother ram tells us it would thus say
[27:22] the lord in the church age book
[27:24] but it's beautiful to see it go genesis
[27:27] to revelation
[27:28] it didn't have to go in the new
[27:29] testament but god inspired james to
[27:31] write it down for us
[27:32] so we're grateful for that james 5
[27:35] 7 through 9.
[27:43] if we look at this scripture we'll see
[27:45] also that
[27:46] the main thing church in this hour is
[27:48] just divine love
[27:50] right because that's the baptism of the
[27:51] holy ghost yes
[27:54] it's the way people know you're a
[27:55] disciple of christ
[27:57] right brother man said you got to have
[27:59] divine love thus saith the lord to make
[28:00] it to the other side
[28:04] so everything all boils down to that
[28:06] there's so many wonderful things we can
[28:08] preach in the message because the
[28:09] mysteries are open
[28:10] we still have some questions but as far
[28:12] as doctrinally everything
[28:14] doctrinally laid out we got questions
[28:17] about the future
[28:18] but it all really boils down to this do
[28:20] we have the love of jesus christ in our
[28:21] hearts
[28:22] and if we do we are the true disciples
[28:24] of jesus christ
[28:26] james 5 7 through 9.
[28:33] let's read uh seven together
[28:36] why we read seven and eight together and
[28:38] i'll read verse nine myself so let's
[28:39] read
[28:40] seven and eight together let's begin on
[28:42] three one
[28:43] two three be patient therefore brethren
[28:47] unto the coming of the lord behold the
[28:50] husbandman waiteth
[28:51] for the precious fruit of the earth and
[28:54] hath long patience for it
[28:56] until he received the early and latter
[28:59] rain
[29:00] be ye also patient establish your hearts
[29:04] for the coming of the lord draw nine now
[29:06] i'll read verse eight or verse nine
[29:08] myself grudge not
[29:09] so see how he gets in divine love he's
[29:11] talking about the latter rain
[29:12] the last rain before the harvest he said
[29:15] but don't grudge amongst yourselves
[29:18] grudge not one against another brethren
[29:21] lest ye be
[29:22] condemned look at that behold
[29:25] the judge standeth before the door
[29:28] let's have a word of prayer if you have
[29:29] any on your heart let's make it known to
[29:31] god and
[29:32] let's ask for god to give us more of his
[29:34] divine love
[29:35] and let us surrender to his divine love
[29:37] heavenly father we
[29:38] raise our hands of the lord and we bow
[29:40] our heads father some of us and
[29:42] father we just express ourselves to you
[29:44] bless this reading of your word anoint
[29:46] me god
[29:47] i just pray lord in jesus name father
[29:50] that you'll speak through me
[29:51] help me lord god guide me i've prepared
[29:54] i've done all i know how to do
[29:56] uh lord just use me for your glory in
[29:59] jesus christ's name and the saint said
[30:01] amen god bless you as being seated
[30:03] praise god
[30:04] i'd like to start uh just by reviewing
[30:07] what i preached on the three showdowns
[30:10] back in 2016 karen probably remember
[30:12] aaron probably remembers rather
[30:14] i remember preaching over there in the
[30:15] other sanctuary so if you can switch
[30:18] over acacia
[30:19] i'm gonna go quickly through it i
[30:20] promise questions say promise but yeah
[30:22] my word i'm going to go quickly through
[30:23] it
[30:23] i'm not going to take up too much time
[30:25] because i want to get to the latter rain
[30:26] part of this
[30:28] okay so i just want to review it uh just
[30:30] to kind of give us something to start
[30:31] with
[30:32] as far as a rehearsal or a review of
[30:36] uh of the truth of god and let me open
[30:39] up these files
[30:40] okay these messages all right so
[30:43] um that's actually mount zion right
[30:45] there
[30:46] so that's mount zion i know don't look
[30:49] very tall as far
[30:50] as to us but that is mount zion that's
[30:52] the highest mountain there in jerusalem
[30:55] and uh we know there's three showdowns
[30:57] right uh i was listening that again last
[30:59] night
[31:00] um i'm just gonna go quickly brother
[31:02] braham was told
[31:04] uh he said here's where the spirit said
[31:06] pick up the pen
[31:08] and this is in 62. so he's preaching
[31:10] this in march of 62 about the spoken
[31:12] word original seed
[31:14] and he begins writing but brother man
[31:16] says i never wrote it
[31:18] he did and it is quite a beautiful
[31:21] eloquent section it's in the church age
[31:23] book as well
[31:24] but if you listen to the end it's a six
[31:26] hour sermon
[31:28] uh the spoken word original seed if you
[31:30] listen to the last
[31:31] hour of it he reads what the holy spirit
[31:33] told him to write
[31:34] okay this is where we get the idea of
[31:36] the three showdowns
[31:38] it's where we get some words about the
[31:40] latter rain
[31:41] we even get words where brother branham
[31:43] says the messenger will sow
[31:46] for the latter rain so that's quite a
[31:49] statement
[31:50] that last seven church age messenger
[31:52] will plant seeds
[31:54] for the latter rain to bring forth
[31:58] because as you saw in genesis there was
[32:00] three messengers that came down to
[32:02] abraham's seed
[32:03] before sodom was destroyed so brother
[32:06] graham says
[32:07] brother brown basically says his
[32:08] ministry was god's ministry
[32:10] right which we believe that how many
[32:11] believe that that was god's ministry
[32:14] god himself was with brother branham but
[32:17] then there was two other seeds right or
[32:18] two other messengers that went down to
[32:20] sodom
[32:21] the man said that was a modern billy
[32:22] graham modern oral roberts
[32:25] okay and brother ram said the gospel
[32:28] blinded the
[32:29] the uh the sodomites right you know
[32:32] uh billy graham believed uh that was
[32:34] wrong sodomite was wrong billy graham
[32:36] believed that he didn't preach about it
[32:37] but
[32:38] uh too much from what i recall from what
[32:40] i've heard from him
[32:42] same thing with oral roberts uh but they
[32:45] they they weren't they didn't stay or
[32:47] they went down to the world right
[32:49] they went down to the foolish virgin but
[32:51] god stayed with abraham seed
[32:53] and he discerned abraham's seed right
[32:55] abra or sarah right abraham's wife sarah
[32:58] he discerned her with that discernment
[33:00] gift right
[33:01] and so those are all ideas we get from
[33:04] the pick up the pen
[33:06] section it's a big long section it's
[33:07] beautiful brother branham said it's it's
[33:09] about
[33:10] what the spirit uh and the word is going
[33:13] to do in the bride
[33:14] it's about the word and the bride and
[33:16] how they are
[33:17] one okay
[33:20] so i was just out uh there's just too
[33:23] much here
[33:24] i told i told you i gotta go quick he
[33:26] basically parallels ahab
[33:27] and uh elijah to our day
[33:31] okay and i'll just read this uh then in
[33:33] the latter rain will come a mount carmel
[33:35] showdown
[33:36] watch this carefully now to see it in
[33:38] the word now he gives
[33:39] the word the second forerunner of christ
[33:41] will sow for the latter reigns these are
[33:43] some of those ideas in there
[33:45] right some of those uh scriptures in
[33:47] there
[33:48] uh jesus will be the showdown between
[33:50] the denominations and creeds where he
[33:52] will come
[33:52] to back up his word aren't you glad amen
[33:55] and take his bride
[33:56] in the rapture jesus is always going to
[33:59] back up his word
[34:00] praise god now i i had this you probably
[34:03] remember this there's three
[34:04] uh showdowns carmel transfiguration zion
[34:07] it's a physical mountain physical
[34:09] mountain this has to be a spiritual
[34:10] mountain
[34:11] but church this will be a physical
[34:13] mountain for the 144 thousand how many
[34:15] know that
[34:16] that's in revelation 14. they actually
[34:18] received christ
[34:19] on the physical mount zion praise god
[34:22] but we are a type of that we're a type
[34:24] of that
[34:25] okay because mount zion is the highest
[34:27] elevation in jerusalem
[34:29] so we have our messengers john the
[34:30] baptist william branham
[34:32] um yeah elijah i'm sorry yeah we have
[34:35] four runners and
[34:36] we have four runners with uh these two
[34:39] uh mount transfigure i'm sorry these two
[34:42] showdowns
[34:43] so it's really deep uh you know the both
[34:45] of them rebuke organizations
[34:47] it's a showdown with denominations or
[34:49] baal spirits
[34:50] uh ours is showdown against the
[34:52] denominations and creeds praise god
[34:54] okay so just quickly going through that
[34:57] um
[34:58] he said be ready for the mount zion
[34:59] showdown
[35:01] i'm not gonna like i said i'm not gonna
[35:02] go through all this just kind of bring a
[35:04] little bit to
[35:05] uh memory
[35:09] and i just wanted to show uh you know
[35:11] again mount zion so mount moriah was
[35:12] where christ was crucified
[35:15] and then mount zion of course is the
[35:16] highest mountain here's a modern-day
[35:19] picture
[35:19] there's a dome of the rock so mount zion
[35:22] is actually the tallest
[35:23] uh mountain there temple mount you know
[35:25] that's where solomon's temple was
[35:28] and so this is this is literally so if i
[35:30] i told you this before if i was a jew
[35:32] i'd be hanging out right there because
[35:34] jesus is going to come back
[35:35] and meet the 144 000 on mount zion
[35:40] uh but for us it's spiritual praise god
[35:42] spiritual
[35:43] okay so uh now here's here's where the
[35:46] rapture is typed as mount zion
[35:49] psalm 24 who shall ascend into the hill
[35:52] of the lord
[35:52] who shall stand in this holy place he
[35:55] that have
[35:56] clean hands and a pure heart
[35:59] praise god who hath not lifted up his
[36:01] soul into vanity
[36:03] right you hear all the people cheering
[36:06] over there isn't that funny they're
[36:07] cheering for the browns we're cheering
[36:08] for jesus in here
[36:09] shouting praising hallelujah thank you
[36:12] lord
[36:13] clap in and ours is not in vain theirs
[36:16] is in vain but
[36:17] ours is sincere praise god ours is
[36:20] eternal praise the lord
[36:22] who hath not lifted up his soul and of
[36:23] any nor sworn deceitfully see that
[36:25] christian keeps their
[36:26] word he should receive the blessing from
[36:28] the lord and the righteousness from the
[36:29] god of his salvation
[36:30] this is the generation of them that seek
[36:32] him that seek thy face o god
[36:34] i'm saying o jacob say lie praise god
[36:37] this is where we get it the hill of the
[36:39] lord
[36:41] all right and then the bible conditions
[36:44] uh there may be a minor persecution
[36:45] brother branham calls it physically
[36:47] bereft in the church age book
[36:50] uh the ecumenical move will end with
[36:52] rome at the head even though the people
[36:53] did not
[36:54] vision that way like it doesn't look
[36:55] like that way right now
[36:57] that is so because revelation 17 3
[36:59] through 6 it states that the
[37:01] mystery babylon is seated on the beast
[37:04] she's seated on the beast okay uh
[37:08] here's where brother said the church
[37:09] systems will persecute the true bride
[37:11] the image will try to keep the bride
[37:13] from preaching and teaching and that's
[37:14] why i said
[37:15] jeffersonville's on the wrong way
[37:16] because they're trying to shut down
[37:17] preachers now
[37:18] they're going the wrong way uh and he
[37:21] says her ministers will be forbidden to
[37:22] give comfort and truth to the people who
[37:24] need it
[37:25] but before the antichrist in person
[37:27] takes over
[37:28] the true church will be taken away from
[37:30] this world to be with the lord
[37:32] god will catch away his bride from the
[37:34] for the marriage supper of the lamb
[37:38] okay so brother bam says when and pick
[37:40] up your pen the boycott is scriptural
[37:44] this is what i was talking this morning
[37:45] brother amen he said uh
[37:47] do you believe this has been six hours
[37:49] or six hours
[37:51] i've never i've never felt led to do
[37:53] that but brother brand did
[37:54] and good thing he did there's much more
[37:56] could be said but surely the holy spirit
[37:58] by this time has sunk it deep in you
[38:00] that you know what i'm talking about
[38:01] we're at the end time the seeds are so
[38:03] down now
[38:04] the latter rain is fixing to come forth
[38:07] he didn't say it already was
[38:08] he said it's fixing right remember
[38:11] there'll be such a denominational
[38:12] gathering pretty soon
[38:14] it'll be terrific now not good terrific
[38:16] it'll just be it'll be bad right
[38:19] but he's saying it'll be terrific they
[38:20] will bring themselves together in this
[38:22] federation of churches
[38:23] and then this kind of a church will be
[38:25] put out of operation as far as
[38:26] they know but we'll keep going on praise
[38:29] god amen
[38:30] because it doesn't matter wherever we're
[38:31] two or three are gathered that's where
[38:32] the church is praise god
[38:35] it's at that time jesus will appear
[38:38] that's what brother man thought
[38:40] okay that when we are scattered all
[38:42] about or whatever we're not allowed to
[38:43] gather here
[38:44] jesus will come at that time a church if
[38:47] that's scriptural then
[38:48] brother amen that would have to happen
[38:50] before the rapture so our churches would
[38:52] have to get shut down i'm not saying
[38:53] it is but it sure looks like it right
[38:56] because i don't have a thus saith the
[38:58] lord on this particular statement
[39:00] but then it looks like it because he
[39:02] said pick up the pen and write and
[39:03] probably said that wasn't me
[39:05] so it looks like a prophecy so
[39:08] that's we just do the best we can
[39:11] he said remember christian friends i'm a
[39:13] man i can make mistakes but god
[39:14] being god cannot make a mistake all the
[39:16] words has been written must be fulfilled
[39:18] jesus said so
[39:19] we've got things here in the scripture
[39:20] that must be fulfilled and that is one
[39:22] of the things this
[39:22] boycott to come they'll boycott our
[39:26] churches
[39:28] i believe someday the real bride of
[39:30] christ will be forced to stop preaching
[39:32] the word of god the bible prophesies it
[39:34] in revelation 13
[39:35] 16 if you want to put it down okay
[39:37] that's where they start laying down the
[39:39] mark
[39:40] okay so there's the boycott scriptures
[39:41] are familiar with those that's the
[39:43] uh they're laying out their mark and
[39:44] then that's because you kept the word of
[39:46] my patience
[39:47] i'll keep you from the hour temptation
[39:48] that will come upon the earth that was
[39:50] the philadelphian church age okay
[39:52] now real quick again um let me see
[39:55] anything
[39:56] really important else in there yeah
[39:58] brother man talks about the tears must
[40:00] be gathered first we'll look at that
[40:02] again
[40:03] like i said i want to spend too much
[40:04] time on this one she's yeah she's cut
[40:07] from the hour temptation that comes upon
[40:09] the whole world
[40:10] uh i just want to go this kind of fast
[40:14] here
[40:16] so baby even says it's not a declaration
[40:18] that the true church will go
[40:19] through and into the tribulation okay uh
[40:24] the temptation right before the rapture
[40:25] will be very inviting
[40:27] uh but it'll be in direct opposition to
[40:29] god's commanded word yet from the
[40:30] standpoint of human reasoning it will be
[40:32] so very right
[40:33] so enlightening and life-giving as to
[40:35] fool the world
[40:37] he said it comes as follows politically
[40:39] they change the laws with pressure
[40:42] and enacting the loss that no people
[40:44] will be recognized as actual churches
[40:46] unless under direct or indirect
[40:48] domination of the council
[40:50] so little groups will lose their
[40:51] charters all their property spiritual
[40:53] rights with the people
[40:55] all right and the pressure as it
[40:57] increases it'll be harder to resist for
[40:59] the
[40:59] resistance to lose privilege but we they
[41:02] we can never go along with the the laws
[41:05] of the land
[41:06] then it becomes the mark of the beast as
[41:07] they gather together and then they call
[41:09] in the money system and that's when the
[41:11] the church or that's when the nation
[41:12] surrenders to rome
[41:14] because rome has all the gold i guess
[41:16] rome had rome has all the
[41:17] the catholics that control this world
[41:20] and they got all the art and everything
[41:21] they got it all
[41:22] the man says we need sanctification for
[41:24] the third poll
[41:26] uh yep he says we're coming to this
[41:30] third poll
[41:31] and we need to be sanctified so yeah i'm
[41:34] just skipping that real quick
[41:36] yeah he says the third poll means a lot
[41:37] of shaving down for me for you but
[41:39] together we'll make it by the grace of
[41:41] god
[41:42] okay so walk in the spirit you won't
[41:44] fulfill the lust of the flesh yeah
[41:46] here's the rapture harvest
[41:47] matthew 13 brother says binding time now
[41:50] so they're being bound together now
[41:52] the ecumenical churches harvest reign or
[41:54] rapturing faith
[41:57] uh so here's where it's thus saith the
[41:58] lord the prophet messenger who was sent
[42:00] to teach the people
[42:02] and turn the hearts of the children back
[42:03] to the pentacles pentecostal fathers had
[42:05] not yet come to azusa street
[42:07] so here it is the latter rather rain is
[42:09] harvest rain
[42:11] and let me get to the thor okay so twice
[42:13] for the lamb says thus saith lord so to
[42:15] me there's no
[42:16] question in the bride will be the
[42:18] fullness of pentecost
[42:19] for the spirit will bring the people
[42:21] right back to the where where they were
[42:22] at the beginning that's thus saith the
[42:24] lord because of joel
[42:25] 2 23 uh
[42:28] and then next will come the harvest rain
[42:30] or rapturing faith
[42:31] so the latter rain is clearly rapturing
[42:33] faith can anybody say amen to that
[42:35] all right so let me uh let me just stop
[42:38] right there and i'm going to start
[42:39] teaching on the latter rain now so this
[42:40] will all be new
[42:42] so the former rain i believe is william
[42:44] branham's teaching
[42:45] that's what i believe because that word
[42:47] former means teaching
[42:49] so there had to come a teaching reign
[42:50] first and then the latter reign where
[42:53] the brahm tells us is rapturing faith
[42:55] so it makes sense that people gotta have
[42:57] the blessing of the teaching
[42:58] in order to raise their faith amen
[43:02] praise god amen now a few months ago
[43:06] over the summer i wrote uh i wrote my
[43:09] best understanding
[43:10] of the former latter reign and it goes
[43:13] with
[43:14] uh the feast of weeks how many remember
[43:16] the feast of weeks from the jewish
[43:17] feasts there are seven feasts
[43:19] right you had uh i have to i might have
[43:21] to read them off here
[43:22] because i don't have them all fresh on
[43:24] my mind here
[43:26] passover was the first feast unleavened
[43:28] bread the second
[43:30] first fruits the third and those type
[43:32] jesus death
[43:33] burial resurrection and then the feast
[43:36] of weeks that's the fourth
[43:37] feast that's what we're in right now
[43:40] okay
[43:41] now after the rapture goes the trumpets
[43:44] right and that's actually the season
[43:45] where right now of israel actually lit
[43:46] in their literal
[43:47] uh spiritual year right now they're
[43:49] trumpets atonement i think they're in
[43:51] tabernacles
[43:52] now so the in god's calendar
[43:56] the trumpets don't take place until
[43:58] after the gentile rapture
[44:00] after the gentile rapture the two
[44:01] prophets starts trumpeting gather the
[44:03] 144
[44:04] 000 together amen and then the day of
[44:06] atonement is when those 144 thousand
[44:09] meet jesus and the bible said they go
[44:11] from house to house so sorry they
[44:13] crucified their own messiah
[44:15] but the bible said a nation will be born
[44:16] in one day praise god
[44:18] they'll be born again the holy ghost
[44:20] they'll be forgiven all
[44:21] everything will be atoned and israel be
[44:24] restored praise god
[44:25] by the baptism of the holy ghost and
[44:27] then that leads into the tabernacles
[44:29] which is the millennium praise god
[44:31] so we know that's the prophetic calendar
[44:33] brother ram taught that plainly
[44:36] okay now let's go real slow here with
[44:39] this
[44:39] ladder rain give me uh give me about 30
[44:42] minutes here i'll try to
[44:43] read through this here we'll be teaching
[44:44] us have your bible handy we got numerous
[44:46] scriptures here
[44:49] okay so the former and latter rain
[44:51] before the harvest now this was a great
[44:53] study
[44:53] i learned a lot so bear with me this is
[44:56] the deepest i've ever gone on the former
[44:58] ladder rain
[44:59] okay so reaping the wheat harvest was
[45:02] the main task of the feast
[45:04] of weeks okay so israel i think barley
[45:07] was first
[45:08] because that was time ruth came back uh
[45:11] the last
[45:12] the last harvest was wheat
[45:15] amen i'm glad to be a wheat seed of god
[45:17] amen the wheat plant of god
[45:20] just as jesus's great commission
[45:22] emphasizes saving souls
[45:25] in the field of the world's nations
[45:28] right
[45:29] that's what jesus said in mark 16 and
[45:31] matthew 24 and
[45:33] 28 talked about go into all the world go
[45:35] into all the field
[45:36] and preach the gospel and harvest souls
[45:39] for my kingdom
[45:41] praise god but no harvest is possible in
[45:44] the natural church
[45:46] without the former and latter rain
[45:48] you've got to have both
[45:50] okay you can't have a harvest unless you
[45:53] have those rains
[45:55] okay so let's deal with let's first deal
[45:57] with rain's spiritual meaning
[45:59] and we'll look up former and latter
[46:01] reign okay
[46:03] i got some readers there back there
[46:04] lydia malachi can you read from me
[46:06] got a bible there sorry lydia can you
[46:09] get hosea 6 1-3
[46:11] malachi can you get joel 2 28.
[46:14] so these two scriptures we're going to
[46:15] read hosea 6 and then joel 2
[46:19] are evidences here that on the day of
[46:22] pentecost
[46:24] peter declares the falling of the holy
[46:26] spirit fulfilled joel's prophecy
[46:28] okay so uh joel 2
[46:31] 28 is what peter quotes
[46:36] so malachi when you got joel 228 can you
[46:38] read that
[46:41] afterward that buddy will pour out my
[46:42] spirit upon all flesh
[46:44] and your sons and your daughter shall
[46:45] prophesize your own shall be in jesus
[46:48] name
[46:50] okay so peter quotes that on the day of
[46:53] pentecost
[46:54] pouring out so it's pouring out it's a
[46:56] symbolism of rain
[46:58] okay now hosea 6 1-3
[47:01] is another evidence that his spirit is
[47:04] symbolized as
[47:06] rain so lydia can you read hosea 6 1-3
[47:32] amen praise god that's speaking of
[47:34] israel right yeah
[47:35] and he says notice you have three days
[47:37] to get together all the way
[47:38] justification sanctification baptism
[47:40] with the holy ghost
[47:41] he said we'll do two days then he comes
[47:42] on the third day if we want to return to
[47:45] the book of acts we got to be
[47:46] justified sanctified and filled with the
[47:48] holy ghost amen
[47:49] praise god so see spirit represents
[47:52] rain is going forth is as the morning he
[47:55] shall come
[47:55] unto us as how does god come as the rain
[47:58] praise god
[47:59] the refreshing of the rain hallelujah
[48:02] now look there's two rains necessary for
[48:05] the harvest former ladder
[48:07] the purpose of the former were to water
[48:09] the seeds
[48:10] at the beginning of the autumn growing
[48:13] season
[48:14] so in israel's time right now is the
[48:16] time to plant
[48:17] to harvest it next summer
[48:20] because their weather is more mild okay
[48:24] so the former rain was arraigned in the
[48:27] autumn and let me just
[48:28] uh state that here
[48:31] so the former rain was the first rain to
[48:34] give the seed life
[48:35] the latter rain was the last rain to
[48:37] bring it to maturity
[48:39] praise god israel had a sacred year and
[48:42] a civil year as you know
[48:44] the sacred year was from march or april
[48:46] depending on the year
[48:47] to september or october so they're
[48:49] finishing their sacred year now
[48:51] their civil year was from october or
[48:53] november to february march
[48:56] okay so they're finishing up their their
[48:58] sacred year right now with tabernacles
[49:01] but then they're going to get into their
[49:02] civil year okay
[49:04] so the former reigns fell around
[49:06] november
[49:08] and its latter rains fell in the first
[49:10] month of the sacred year around march or
[49:12] april and we'll get to the scriptures on
[49:13] these in just a little bit
[49:14] so church logically the latter rain has
[49:17] to fall
[49:18] shortly before the first month
[49:21] just in time for israel to harvest the
[49:24] barley first fruits
[49:25] to be waived by the priests on the feast
[49:28] of first fruits
[49:30] okay so you have barley and you have
[49:32] wheat
[49:33] barley gets harvested right there in
[49:35] march or april now the wheat though was
[49:37] later on in the summer
[49:38] but both of them got the latter rain
[49:40] there right at the beginning of march
[49:42] right at the end of february okay
[49:45] so it's it's a little bit to digest
[49:47] there
[49:48] so we must apply the former latter reign
[49:51] to the times of the gentiles
[49:53] or from 30 a.d to the present
[49:57] so we are in the spiritual feast of
[49:59] weeks this long
[50:00] harvest season before god returns to the
[50:03] jews at the feast of the trumpets
[50:05] okay so peter was clear that the rain
[50:08] was coming on all flesh remember say all
[50:10] flesh
[50:11] all flesh now that represents gentiles
[50:14] so on the day of pentecost he said
[50:16] he said i'm quoting joel 2 pour out the
[50:18] spirit on all flesh
[50:19] is it fulfilled yes yeah you see uh
[50:23] asians get the can you have the holy
[50:24] ghost on them uh you can have
[50:26] europeans north americans everybody
[50:30] the holy spirit can fall on anybody
[50:31] praise god all flesh
[50:35] and so forth throughout the 2000 years
[50:37] of the church ages the rain has been
[50:39] falling
[50:40] holy ghost rain showers have fallen on
[50:42] every age
[50:43] and its leaders from john the divine to
[50:45] arrhenius to colombo to luther to wesley
[50:48] to wigglesworth and now to brother
[50:49] branham praise god
[50:51] but jesus and other uh prophets foretold
[50:54] end time
[50:55] conditions in the church ages before the
[50:59] final harvest and alt and it would
[51:01] ultimately mirror a spiritual famine due
[51:03] to disobedience
[51:04] so now let's bring in this idea of
[51:06] famine right
[51:08] so we need former ladder rain but
[51:10] there's an idea of famine
[51:12] before the rain okay
[51:16] so this is a thought we have to see here
[51:18] jesus said
[51:19] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[51:21] shall he find faith on the earth
[51:24] so that looks like famine right there's
[51:26] not much faith
[51:27] paul calls it a falling away from the
[51:30] faith
[51:32] right and he says this is a time of
[51:35] seducing
[51:36] teachers who grow increasingly more
[51:38] deceptive
[51:40] let's read amos 11 and 12 8 11 and 12.
[51:42] i'll read it
[51:44] amos 8 11 and 12. behold the days come
[51:46] saith the lord that i will send a famine
[51:48] in the land not a famine of bread
[51:50] nor a thirst for water but of the
[51:53] hearing of the words of the lord
[51:54] and they shall wander from sea to sea
[51:57] and from the north even to the east they
[51:58] shall run
[51:59] to and fro to seek the word of lord and
[52:02] shall not find it
[52:03] praise god so can we see it church this
[52:06] is a spiritual famine time
[52:08] right the former rain fell right but now
[52:11] we're waiting for the latter rain to
[52:12] fall
[52:14] i say like this i still think the former
[52:15] rain's falling myself
[52:17] because i think it goes to every
[52:18] generation because i could be wrong but
[52:21] you know the
[52:21] the generation that liver and brother
[52:23] branham they're all dying out
[52:24] right we got a new generation people
[52:27] that didn't know brother they never met
[52:28] him
[52:29] but yet we met jesus praise god that's
[52:32] the most important one to me praise god
[52:33] jesus so see all those scriptures from
[52:37] paul and jesus
[52:38] they paint this picture of a famine time
[52:41] and we need rain amen we need rain
[52:44] jesus describes the final wheat harvest
[52:47] in matthew 13 24. so let's go there
[52:49] matthew 13 24 through 30. this is a
[52:52] beautiful
[52:54] type of it 13 34.
[52:57] i'm sorry 13 24. my phone ether 13 24
[53:01] through 30.
[53:04] well for time's sake let's go to 36
[53:06] because most of us
[53:07] know this parable pretty familiar
[53:10] matthew 13 36-43
[53:12] then jesus sent the multitude away and
[53:14] went into the house and his disciples
[53:16] came unto him saying
[53:17] declare unto us the parable the
[53:18] terrorists of the field he answered and
[53:20] said unto them
[53:21] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[53:23] of man the field is the world
[53:25] the good seed are the children of the
[53:27] kingdom but the tares are the children
[53:29] of the wicked one the enemy that sowed
[53:31] them is the devil
[53:32] the harvest is the end of the world and
[53:34] the reapers
[53:36] are the angels we looked at angels last
[53:38] week right
[53:40] as therefore the tares are gathered and
[53:42] burned in the fire so shall it be
[53:43] in the end of this world the son of man
[53:45] shall send forth his angels and they
[53:47] shall gather out of his kingdom
[53:48] all things that offend and them which do
[53:51] iniquity
[53:53] and shall cast them into a furnace of
[53:54] fire there shall be wailing and gnashing
[53:56] of teeth
[53:57] then shall the righteous shine forth as
[53:59] the sun in the kingdom of their father
[54:01] who hath ears to hear let him hear
[54:04] specifically the end time is called a
[54:07] wheat harvest amen
[54:08] but there's a lot of tares growing up
[54:10] praise god
[54:13] so christians are labeled wheat right
[54:17] and that matches israel's feast of weeks
[54:20] because they were going to harvest
[54:21] wheat and they're gathered into christ's
[54:24] barn praise god
[54:25] the tares are gathered and burned up
[54:28] now jesus final harvest is required
[54:32] before the wrath and judgment of the
[54:33] great tribulation
[54:35] because the former latter reigns are
[54:36] necessary to bring the wheat to maturity
[54:39] and we read john i'm sorry james 5 7 to
[54:41] 8
[54:42] to support this this gives the promise
[54:45] of one more
[54:47] former and latter rain before the last
[54:49] gentile harvest did you catch that
[54:52] he says he hath long patience for it so
[54:55] he waited what two thousand years
[54:58] until you receive the early and the
[55:01] latter rain
[55:02] be also patient establish your hearts
[55:05] from the coming of the lord drawth night
[55:07] so
[55:08] we are told church we need patience in
[55:10] this hour
[55:11] and we need hearts that are established
[55:13] in other words unmovable
[55:15] right this thing's pretty movable i
[55:16] don't want to break any wires that bang
[55:18] or amen set up but this is pretty
[55:20] movable right
[55:22] but the bible said let your heart be
[55:23] unmovable
[55:25] praise god if we are going to receive
[55:28] the latter rain
[55:29] our hearts must be unmovable nothing can
[55:31] shake us
[55:32] i'm built on christ the solid rock and i
[55:35] stand on the solid rock of christ
[55:39] now the holy spirit gives more
[55:41] inspiration from joel 2 23-26 as we read
[55:45] uh we've read it numerous times
[55:48] now the word former i'm just going to
[55:50] look off joel 2 28
[55:52] i'm sorry joel 2 23-26
[55:55] uh be then glad you children of zion and
[55:58] rejoice in the lord your god
[55:59] for hath given you the former rain
[56:01] moderately and he will cause to come
[56:03] down for you the rain the former rain
[56:05] and the latter rain in the first month
[56:09] okay so the word former means teacher
[56:12] that's what it actually means teacher
[56:14] so a teacher reign praise god
[56:17] a teacher reign so christians must
[56:20] expect a great
[56:21] teaching anointing to come in
[56:23] preparation for the rapture harvest
[56:28] let me share let me i'll show you where
[56:29] brother ma'am said that
[56:32] so i'm getting back to this quote i
[56:33] mentioned this morning about put the
[56:34] word first
[56:35] brother ram said jesus warned us of such
[56:38] things coming
[56:39] he said in matthew 24 there'll be two
[56:42] spirits very close
[56:43] they'll deceive the very elected if they
[56:45] were possible but man said how can you
[56:47] tell them so how can we tell
[56:48] the false the tares from the wheat
[56:51] brotherhood says
[56:51] give them the word test how can you know
[56:55] it
[56:55] speak the word see what they say about
[56:58] it
[56:59] if they don't believe the word they have
[57:02] no seed germ in them
[57:04] they are of the evil one and deceive you
[57:07] as the first bride was deceived he's
[57:08] speaking of eve
[57:10] the second bride was the seed now he's
[57:12] speaking of uh those
[57:13] make believers after pentecost because
[57:16] you can't deceive the jew brad
[57:17] right uh he says they are deceivers of
[57:21] the third bride
[57:22] he said it's all at the end end time
[57:23] right by hydrating the word or
[57:26] trying to god never placed signs ahead
[57:29] of his word
[57:31] he said amen that's a scorcher anybody
[57:33] feel scorched out there i hope not
[57:35] you've probably heard this before so it
[57:36] doesn't scorch you so this is for people
[57:38] that say
[57:38] we gotta you know uh we gotta have the
[57:41] greatest miracles if we don't have the
[57:42] miracles we're not the bride well
[57:43] brother
[57:44] that's a scorcher he said god never
[57:46] places signs and miracles above his word
[57:50] the word comes first he said he said god
[57:52] never placed signs ahead of his word
[57:56] they were added for the proof of the
[57:58] word but the word is first
[58:01] so see that's why the teaching reign has
[58:03] to come first it has to prove it
[58:05] now look what happened church look what
[58:07] can i say like this look what happened
[58:09] to azusa
[58:11] they had the signs and miracles first
[58:12] and then they got off the word
[58:15] see they should have the word first
[58:17] there's tongues or no evidence but but
[58:19] god
[58:19] can restore the gifts
[58:23] so he said god always places the word
[58:25] first he said to prove it elijah said to
[58:28] the woman
[58:29] bring me a cake first then watch the
[58:31] miracle happen
[58:32] he said come to the word first and then
[58:34] watch the miracle
[58:36] the seed word itself is what the holy
[58:38] spirit energizes amen amen
[58:41] so see the word's got to come first the
[58:42] true word the true teaching
[58:44] and then the water comes to anoint that
[58:47] praise god
[58:48] and gives it energizes that seed word
[58:52] he said how can a messenger sent from
[58:53] god just believe some of the scriptures
[58:55] and not all the word how can he deny
[58:58] part of it the true prophet of god will
[59:00] proclaim the word in the last days
[59:02] denominations will hate him yeah they
[59:05] sure do
[59:07] but we love him he will not pull any
[59:11] punches on them
[59:12] he'll be like it was when he come at the
[59:14] first coming of christ you generation of
[59:16] vipers
[59:18] but the predestinator will hear and will
[59:20] make ready for the countdown the royal
[59:22] seat of abraham's faith like him
[59:24] holding to the word of god regardless
[59:26] for he was predestinated
[59:30] okay so i want to give you the idea how
[59:31] the teaching has to come first
[59:34] the teaching must come first okay
[59:38] now with that laid down um
[59:42] after the former reign then god sends a
[59:44] latter rain anointing
[59:47] or we call it rapturing faith because
[59:50] the church
[59:51] recognizes the conditions the times and
[59:53] seasons of the rapture
[59:55] a church she'll begin seeking god for
[59:58] the latter reign through prayer
[1:00:00] according to zechariah 10 1. so if
[1:00:02] you've got your bibles we're already
[1:00:03] matthew
[1:00:04] let's just flip a few pages zechariah 10
[1:00:06] 1.
[1:00:13] now remember church god moved israel to
[1:00:16] cry out for the first
[1:00:17] exodus and then in the upper room they
[1:00:20] cried out for the second exodus
[1:00:21] amen do you think we're going to get out
[1:00:23] of crying out to god for the third
[1:00:25] exodus i don't think so
[1:00:27] i think it's going to be our prayers
[1:00:28] that bring it down praise god
[1:00:31] because we have to get in obedience with
[1:00:33] what the prophecy says
[1:00:35] we've got to want it we've got to want
[1:00:36] the rain and that's what this scripture
[1:00:38] says right here
[1:00:39] you have to want we have to want the
[1:00:40] rain
[1:00:43] look at this man it's beautiful ascii of
[1:00:45] the lord
[1:00:46] reign in the time of the latter rain
[1:00:50] so see if we have to recognize it's time
[1:00:51] for the rapture praise god
[1:00:54] i see the spirit will get us there amen
[1:00:55] yeah like i said we've guessed
[1:00:57] people we people around us have guests
[1:00:59] for years and years and years well one
[1:01:01] of these times is going to be right
[1:01:02] there'll be no guessing because the
[1:01:04] spirit will guide us to ask at the right
[1:01:06] time
[1:01:06] just like at pentecost so the lord shall
[1:01:10] make
[1:01:10] bright clouds and give them showers of
[1:01:12] rain to
[1:01:13] everyone grass in the field
[1:01:16] so see look at this the bible clearly
[1:01:18] teaches that when
[1:01:20] we when we recognize it's time for the
[1:01:22] latter rain we've got to cry out for and
[1:01:24] then we see the effects of it praise god
[1:01:26] you see the grass grow up and then you
[1:01:28] can harvest praise god
[1:01:31] so it's a great uh it's a great lesson
[1:01:34] it's a lot of great scriptures in here
[1:01:38] now that's i'm getting towards the end
[1:01:39] of this teaching here now as
[1:01:41] far as in the the book lord willing
[1:01:43] jesus will send his spirit in the same
[1:01:45] measure
[1:01:46] as the day of pentecost producing the
[1:01:49] same results
[1:01:50] the divine reign will restore back to
[1:01:52] the final church
[1:01:54] everything the early church possessed
[1:01:56] remember what joel said we need the
[1:01:58] wheat which is the word
[1:02:00] we need the wine which is joy and we
[1:02:03] need the oil the baptism of the holy
[1:02:05] ghost amen how many
[1:02:06] how many believe we need that in our
[1:02:07] messenger churches amen absolutely
[1:02:09] we need the word joy and the actual
[1:02:12] feeling of the holy spirit praise god
[1:02:14] we need all that and that's what joel 2
[1:02:16] 23-26
[1:02:18] it promises we'll rejoice and be glad
[1:02:20] and we won't be ashamed of this gospel
[1:02:22] praise god
[1:02:23] amen thank the lord
[1:02:26] before the rapture harvest christ church
[1:02:29] will have the same power
[1:02:30] same truth same miracles and faith of
[1:02:33] the apostolic saints
[1:02:35] jesus promises to bring the last church
[1:02:37] right back to where she started
[1:02:38] at pentecost in acts chapter 2. this is
[1:02:41] true because joel 2 23 says the latter
[1:02:43] rain
[1:02:45] is it in the first month now this always
[1:02:47] stumbled me till i studied this this
[1:02:49] summer
[1:02:49] did you ever notice that the bible said
[1:02:51] the early and that rain
[1:02:53] come in the first month well if you look
[1:02:56] in hebrew
[1:02:57] this means formerly so in the former
[1:03:00] or the at first month so in other words
[1:03:04] shortly before the rapture
[1:03:05] the latter rain falls on the gentiles as
[1:03:08] it did formally
[1:03:10] at first on the day of pentecost
[1:03:13] so to me that's what that means uh some
[1:03:16] people say well see the holy ghost the
[1:03:17] rapture has to be in march or april
[1:03:19] i don't believe that because the first
[1:03:21] month of uh the feast of weeks was march
[1:03:24] or april it just was
[1:03:26] okay but me i believe it's prophetic i
[1:03:30] believe it's a spiritual
[1:03:31] the first month when we receive it i
[1:03:34] believe will be
[1:03:35] the first condition of the apostolic
[1:03:38] church
[1:03:38] the book of acts who knows when the
[1:03:40] rapture be nobody knows
[1:03:42] nobody knows uh but it might be in the
[1:03:45] spring it might be
[1:03:46] right god works according to calendars
[1:03:47] right it might be we don't know
[1:03:49] it may be but it may be in the fall too
[1:03:52] right and maybe right before israel
[1:03:54] starts to feast the trumpets it may be
[1:03:55] that if god wants to do that
[1:03:57] it's up to god but we got to be ready
[1:04:00] how many want to be ready praise god
[1:04:02] all right go to matthew 24 i got a few
[1:04:03] more things i want to lay down there now
[1:04:05] that was as deep as i've ever gone into
[1:04:07] it
[1:04:07] so i hope that was a help by god's grace
[1:04:10] naturally the former rain was in
[1:04:11] november
[1:04:13] uh to water the seed and give it life
[1:04:16] and then the latter rain was in march or
[1:04:18] april okay
[1:04:19] but there was rain that rain fell on uh
[1:04:22] the barley and the wheat
[1:04:24] so the barley would have typed the jews
[1:04:26] right and then the wheat would have been
[1:04:27] the gentiles
[1:04:30] praise god okay so matthew 24.
[1:04:38] i'd have some more notes i want to look
[1:04:39] over here okay
[1:04:44] matthew 24.
[1:04:47] i want to read the scripture about the
[1:04:49] field
[1:04:50] there'll be some in the field and some
[1:04:53] uh yeah
[1:04:54] okay now let's go down to uh 37 matthew
[1:04:57] 24 37
[1:05:01] but as the days of noah were remember
[1:05:03] they all laughed at noah that's what
[1:05:04] they're doing laughing today about the
[1:05:05] rapture
[1:05:06] so shall also the coming of the son of
[1:05:08] man be remember they're all
[1:05:10] uh interested in uh immorally dressed
[1:05:12] women right they're all interested in
[1:05:14] marrying outside the faith
[1:05:16] uh violence eating drinking giving you
[1:05:18] marriage totally fits today for as in
[1:05:22] the days that were before the flood they
[1:05:24] were eating and drinking
[1:05:25] marrying given in marriage until the day
[1:05:27] that noah entered into the ark
[1:05:29] and knew not until the flood came and
[1:05:31] took them all away so
[1:05:32] shall also the coming of the son of man
[1:05:34] be here it is this one look at this for
[1:05:36] a moment
[1:05:37] then shall two be in the field the one
[1:05:40] shall be taken
[1:05:42] and the other left okay
[1:05:45] two women shall be grinding at the mill
[1:05:47] the one shall be taken
[1:05:49] the other left watch therefore for ye
[1:05:52] know not what our
[1:05:54] your lord doth come
[1:05:57] praise god uh yeah let me actually go a
[1:06:00] little bit further verse 43
[1:06:01] but know this that if the good man of
[1:06:03] the house had known and what
[1:06:05] watch the thief would have come he would
[1:06:07] have watched and would not have suffered
[1:06:09] his house to be broken up
[1:06:11] therefore be also ready for in such hour
[1:06:14] as you think not
[1:06:15] the son of man cometh who then is a
[1:06:18] faithful you know we need church we need
[1:06:19] faithfulness today
[1:06:21] he said who is that faithful and wise
[1:06:24] servant
[1:06:24] whom his lord hath made ruler over his
[1:06:26] household to give them
[1:06:28] their meat in due season blessed is that
[1:06:31] servant whom his lord when he cometh
[1:06:33] shall find doing so verily i send you
[1:06:36] that he shall make him ruler
[1:06:38] over all of his goods but and if that
[1:06:41] evil servant shall say in his heart my
[1:06:43] lord delayeth is coming and shall begin
[1:06:44] to smite his fellow servants
[1:06:46] and to eat and drink with the drunken
[1:06:48] the lord of that servant shall come in a
[1:06:50] day when he looketh not for him
[1:06:51] and an hour that he's not aware of and
[1:06:53] shall cut him asunder and appoint him
[1:06:55] his portion
[1:06:56] with the hypocrites there shall be
[1:06:58] weeping and gnashing of cheese look at
[1:07:00] that church we'll be in one of two
[1:07:01] groups right
[1:07:02] either we'll be getting the meat for our
[1:07:04] season or we'll be getting beat up by
[1:07:06] preachers and i don't want to beat
[1:07:07] anybody up i want to
[1:07:08] i want to want to change i want i want
[1:07:10] the word of god to chasten us correct us
[1:07:12] but i don't want to beat us up praise
[1:07:14] god i want to i want to see people
[1:07:16] leaving here with a full spiritual
[1:07:17] stomach praise god
[1:07:18] that they got the meat of god's word
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:22] and i believe that i'm giving everybody
[1:07:23] the best i got by god's grace
[1:07:26] that's the best understanding i have of
[1:07:27] the former and latter rain that the
[1:07:30] teaching rain has to come first
[1:07:32] and then the latter rain comes at the
[1:07:34] end to quicken that right
[1:07:36] to quicken that seed that's been planted
[1:07:38] by the messenger
[1:07:40] now i want to just note there too in
[1:07:42] verse 40. we're familiar with this but
[1:07:44] notice the rapture comes when people are
[1:07:47] just working out in the field
[1:07:50] in other words going to work praise god
[1:07:52] so in other words church
[1:07:54] we've got to be ready for the rapture
[1:07:56] before we go to work
[1:07:58] right we got you got to be ready before
[1:08:00] you head out to the field
[1:08:02] i think about that wow one of these days
[1:08:05] you may go to work and that's the last
[1:08:06] day you're going to work praise god
[1:08:08] amen it's the last day you have to go to
[1:08:10] the grinder
[1:08:12] last day i got to go to the classroom
[1:08:13] there may come a day right
[1:08:15] because they go out to the field but one
[1:08:17] of them is ready one of them is not
[1:08:19] ready
[1:08:21] in other words one of them received that
[1:08:23] ladder rain
[1:08:24] my look think about that they're walking
[1:08:26] and the brotherhood said you know we'll
[1:08:28] see our loved ones for a month
[1:08:29] can you imagine that we might have to go
[1:08:31] to work praise god but we've seen
[1:08:34] jesus receiving jesus people praise god
[1:08:38] think about that we'll be we'll be going
[1:08:40] to work and so
[1:08:41] you know the christians here this tells
[1:08:43] us we don't quit work when we see the
[1:08:45] coming of the lord
[1:08:45] we say faithful at work praise god we're
[1:08:48] faithful in the natural
[1:08:50] and we're faithful in the spiritual
[1:08:52] because they go out to the field to work
[1:08:57] and look now look at this church and
[1:08:58] with these we see this too this idea
[1:09:00] where
[1:09:01] you know the person who's born again
[1:09:03] filled with the holy ghost they can't
[1:09:04] convince
[1:09:04] their co-worker to go with them
[1:09:08] right there'll be people that and you
[1:09:11] can be
[1:09:11] think about that you can be born again
[1:09:13] filled with the holy ghost have
[1:09:14] rapturing faith in your soul
[1:09:16] but it won't be enough to take away the
[1:09:18] foolish version as well
[1:09:20] so let me say like this we'll be so
[1:09:22] we'll be so salty praise god can you
[1:09:24] imagine
[1:09:25] if we see our loved ones raised again
[1:09:27] how salty we would be but yet it won't
[1:09:29] be enough
[1:09:30] for the foolish virgin it won't be
[1:09:32] enough it'll just be enough for us
[1:09:34] praise god
[1:09:35] because remember the pressure of the
[1:09:36] churches and politics right
[1:09:39] now at this point have they taken away
[1:09:41] our churches
[1:09:42] have they stopped our preaching possibly
[1:09:44] right i would think so if brother man
[1:09:46] thought that had to happen
[1:09:49] but see one of them is in a condition to
[1:09:51] be taken away
[1:09:52] and the other one's going to be left
[1:09:55] jesus is going to take the one that made
[1:09:57] themselves ready
[1:09:58] the one that received that latter reign
[1:10:00] the one that had faith for the rapture
[1:10:02] they they went to they went to work
[1:10:04] knowing god could change my body today
[1:10:06] praise god they went to work with that
[1:10:08] kind of mindset
[1:10:10] or for our sisters grinding out the
[1:10:11] middle i love how he does men and women
[1:10:13] here
[1:10:14] aren't sisters don't you appreciate that
[1:10:17] verse 41. two women there it is shall be
[1:10:20] grinding at the mill just making bread
[1:10:21] right we got a little we got a a a seed
[1:10:25] grinder at our house
[1:10:26] we got a grinder i poured when i made
[1:10:28] communion bread a few weeks ago i'd
[1:10:30] put my i think my daughter actually
[1:10:31] poured it in there and i got the flour
[1:10:33] out
[1:10:34] that's just a common everyday thing
[1:10:36] right for them
[1:10:37] so women will be doing their common
[1:10:40] everyday bread making bacon or whatever
[1:10:42] they're doing teaching right with cobin
[1:10:45] you might be teaching your children in
[1:10:47] your home
[1:10:50] one will be taken and the other left
[1:10:54] because one of those women had rapturing
[1:10:56] faith while she's making bread
[1:10:59] picture that praise god amen you can
[1:11:01] have rapturing faith
[1:11:02] while you're working the job while
[1:11:04] you're baking bread i imagine you got a
[1:11:05] sweetheart
[1:11:06] uh singing there's gonna be a meeting in
[1:11:08] the air and that's sweet
[1:11:10] oh i want to see jesus look upon his
[1:11:12] face there to sing forever i'm a saving
[1:11:14] grace
[1:11:17] blood is working in the field labor he's
[1:11:19] dripping sweat but yet he's got the joy
[1:11:21] of the lord in his heart
[1:11:24] another mother she's sweating there you
[1:11:26] know getting the bread ready getting
[1:11:28] ready to get
[1:11:29] kneading the bread getting it ready and
[1:11:31] one minute they're looking over
[1:11:33] talking about the things you know the
[1:11:36] next minute look over they're gone
[1:11:40] so this is the condition and this also
[1:11:43] goes to show there won't be like a
[1:11:44] a big financial collapse right because
[1:11:46] they're still doing
[1:11:47] out in the field making bread
[1:11:53] remember he's got to come when they're
[1:11:54] not expecting it they've got to come at
[1:11:56] a time when they're saying peace and
[1:11:57] safety
[1:11:58] peace and safety he said watch therefore
[1:12:01] for you know not what hour
[1:12:03] your lord doth come so while they're
[1:12:06] sweat while the men are sweating out
[1:12:08] there in the field
[1:12:09] or sweating out there on the job right
[1:12:11] they're still watching spiritually
[1:12:12] they're watching for the coming of the
[1:12:14] lord they're
[1:12:14] ready with rapturing faith for the
[1:12:16] coming of the lord
[1:12:18] they're making bread they're they're
[1:12:20] getting food ready for their kids
[1:12:22] with rapturing faith in their souls
[1:12:24] praise god
[1:12:27] that's beautiful church she will likely
[1:12:31] be doing regular work when that latter
[1:12:33] rain
[1:12:33] or maybe however long it falls we'll
[1:12:36] just be going about the regular day
[1:12:38] but i believe we'll have like the bible
[1:12:40] said we'll have that joy of the lord
[1:12:42] we'll have that wine praise god amen
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:46] i believe that now brother amen had a
[1:12:49] good question
[1:12:50] he said will the rain or the latter rain
[1:12:52] fall on everyone now my thought is
[1:12:54] likely because of jesus's parable you
[1:12:58] have we
[1:12:59] and tares right
[1:13:02] you have we end tears well when the rain
[1:13:04] falls in judea i mean it hits both right
[1:13:06] i mean it
[1:13:07] hits the tear and the wheat but
[1:13:09] depending on the seed it produces that
[1:13:12] that life inside right
[1:13:15] in other words they will have some
[1:13:16] rejoicing in their churches
[1:13:18] right now they won't get rapture in
[1:13:20] faith because that's not what's inside
[1:13:22] of them that's what's inside of us
[1:13:23] praise god
[1:13:24] but it's not inside of them so like like
[1:13:26] brother bam said he said the the tares
[1:13:28] will shout praise the lord praise so
[1:13:29] they'll be having good services
[1:13:31] though he's saying peace and safety
[1:13:33] god's gonna right god's gonna give us
[1:13:35] peace and safety and we're gonna say
[1:13:36] god's gonna take us off the earth amen
[1:13:38] amen god's gonna harvest the bride off
[1:13:41] the earth praise the lord
[1:13:42] amen they're gonna be saying oh we're
[1:13:44] gonna be safe but we're gonna have a
[1:13:45] peaceful life and
[1:13:46] we're gonna have all these uh privileges
[1:13:48] and we still get to keep our money in
[1:13:49] our bank accounts
[1:13:50] and we'll be saying we want to go up to
[1:13:52] heaven and see the spiritual heavenly
[1:13:54] bank accounts praise god
[1:13:55] we want to see we want to be in heaven
[1:13:57] praise the lord we don't we don't be
[1:13:58] tied down to this earth
[1:14:02] so she's made herself ready she's going
[1:14:05] to go to
[1:14:06] she's going to go to the bread she's
[1:14:08] going to make her bread with rapturing
[1:14:09] faith
[1:14:11] hallelujah brother bang we're going to
[1:14:13] go to work with rapture and faith
[1:14:16] at least somebody will on this earth at
[1:14:18] least somebody
[1:14:19] will because jesus said so
[1:14:22] so see they both got to grow together
[1:14:25] and brother
[1:14:26] says uniting time right it's uniting
[1:14:29] time for each one
[1:14:31] now i want to just look at uh a few
[1:14:34] thoughts here about the showdown just
[1:14:36] briefly so
[1:14:37] if you go to uh first go to first kings
[1:14:39] here 18 if you would i just want to look
[1:14:42] at a few thoughts on this i just had a
[1:14:43] few thoughts on this i want to share
[1:14:46] first kings 18. now one of the reasons i
[1:14:49] felt led to preach on this was because
[1:14:50] yesterday
[1:14:52] i was this was my chapter to read about
[1:14:54] the showdown
[1:14:57] and then uh i also was listening another
[1:14:58] sermon and they mentioned the showdown
[1:14:59] so i thought well
[1:15:00] they mentioned a lot of rain i thought
[1:15:01] i'd like to preach on that a little bit
[1:15:03] then amen said something about today too
[1:15:05] and i was like okay that's three
[1:15:06] i think i'll preach on that tonight uh
[1:15:09] so
[1:15:11] i think it's uh very scriptural and
[1:15:13] church
[1:15:14] as i as amen and i were talking we're
[1:15:16] just trying to be ready praise god we're
[1:15:18] trying to be ready with divine love
[1:15:20] and god will pour out a rain a ladder
[1:15:23] rain of
[1:15:23] just more of that more of that love
[1:15:26] right more of a spirit
[1:15:28] and that will be that will give us the
[1:15:30] rapturing faith that we need
[1:15:32] and we might take it to work and we
[1:15:34] might take it to the kitchen
[1:15:36] to feed the babies right feed the kids
[1:15:41] so first kings 18.
[1:15:49] all right i'm trying to close up here by
[1:15:51] god's grace
[1:15:54] i just wanted to pull out just a few
[1:15:55] thoughts here now
[1:15:58] brother branham says uh in each showdown
[1:16:00] it's the truth against denominations
[1:16:04] i just want you to get an idea here
[1:16:06] about let's look at these denominations
[1:16:08] here a little bit
[1:16:10] uh in verses 17 to 24
[1:16:13] uh elijah sets the stage for the the
[1:16:16] showdown
[1:16:17] he said you sacrifice calling your god
[1:16:20] i'll sacrifice call my god
[1:16:22] and whoever answers by fire that's the
[1:16:23] real god
[1:16:25] amen
[1:16:28] now i want to look here go down to uh
[1:16:30] verse
[1:16:32] 26. and they took the bullock which was
[1:16:35] given them and they dressed it and
[1:16:36] called on the name of baal
[1:16:38] from morning even until noon saying oh
[1:16:40] baal hear us
[1:16:41] but there was no voice nor any that
[1:16:43] answered and they leaped upon the altar
[1:16:46] which was made and it came to pass at
[1:16:49] noon
[1:16:50] that elijah mocked them
[1:16:53] let me stop right there so apparently
[1:16:55] they were worshiping from 9 00 a.m
[1:16:56] because that was the time of the morning
[1:16:58] sacrifice
[1:16:59] till noon three hours three hours
[1:17:02] and i just heard this week that uh one
[1:17:04] of the brothers who believed brother
[1:17:05] branham was going to raise from the dead
[1:17:07] uh at his funeral there in
[1:17:10] jeffersonville when they laid his body
[1:17:12] they sang only believe for about two or
[1:17:13] three hours expecting him to rise but he
[1:17:15] didn't rise
[1:17:17] and look at that same spirit right
[1:17:19] denominational spirit
[1:17:21] same thing you imagine seeing an only
[1:17:23] belief maybe good if it's glorious
[1:17:25] but with a false hope look how close
[1:17:28] they are
[1:17:29] and these are this is a burnt offering
[1:17:30] this is that's what god loves
[1:17:32] when you give a burnt offering that's
[1:17:34] god take all of me praise god
[1:17:37] i'm fully devoted to you because
[1:17:38] everything's being burned i'm not
[1:17:39] keeping anything for myself
[1:17:41] i am fully sold out to you and so the
[1:17:43] nominations look really sold out to god
[1:17:45] but they're not
[1:17:47] they're not really sold out to god
[1:17:50] because they break his word
[1:17:53] so and look they they shout they leap
[1:17:56] they got all the emotion you want
[1:18:00] and it came to pass at noon that elijah
[1:18:02] mocked them
[1:18:03] and said cry aloud for he's a god either
[1:18:05] he's talking or pursuing or
[1:18:07] he's in a journey per adventure he's
[1:18:09] sleeping he must be awake and they cried
[1:18:11] aloud so they actually
[1:18:12] tried to prove elijah wrong and they
[1:18:14] cried louder
[1:18:16] and cut themselves after the manor with
[1:18:18] knives and lancets
[1:18:19] till the blood gushed out of them and it
[1:18:21] came to pass when midday was passed
[1:18:23] and they prophesied until the time of
[1:18:25] the offering of the evening that was 3
[1:18:28] p.m
[1:18:30] so the evening sacrifice was 3 p.m so
[1:18:33] this is six hours church
[1:18:35] six hours call upon god
[1:18:39] call them on their gods rather and this
[1:18:41] is the showdown
[1:18:44] because remember 6 p.m was the end of
[1:18:45] that day and it went at sundown was the
[1:18:48] next day
[1:18:49] so evening sacrifice had to be at three
[1:18:51] because you got to kill it dress it wash
[1:18:52] it
[1:18:53] present it burn it gotta get done before
[1:18:55] six
[1:18:56] because that's the next day so six hours
[1:18:58] brother bang
[1:18:59] shout and jumping screaming prophesied
[1:19:01] cutting themselves calling upon god at
[1:19:03] the showdown they don't get nothing from
[1:19:05] god
[1:19:06] amen praise god glory because god is
[1:19:10] going to vindicate who's on the lord's
[1:19:12] side praise god
[1:19:16] and then there was no voice nothing that
[1:19:18] regarded oh see they don't have a voice
[1:19:20] but we have a shout voice and trump
[1:19:22] praise god
[1:19:23] amen hallelujah they don't have the shot
[1:19:26] voice trump we've got it
[1:19:27] to shout the voice and the trump praise
[1:19:30] god verse 30.
[1:19:31] elijah said all the people come near to
[1:19:32] me and all the people came near
[1:19:34] and repaired the altar of the lord that
[1:19:35] was broken down
[1:19:37] now see this is where we see in this
[1:19:39] showdown the altar
[1:19:41] or their worship had to be repaired and
[1:19:43] that's what brother ram came to do
[1:19:44] repair our worship right
[1:19:48] prepare it down so see we pray the right
[1:19:49] way we sing the right songs
[1:19:51] we preach the right word everything is
[1:19:53] fixed about our worship
[1:19:55] praise god it's all fixed
[1:19:58] it's not too much emphasis on the you
[1:20:00] know speaking in tongues or too much
[1:20:02] emphasis on
[1:20:03] uh on the music right it is it's the
[1:20:05] right emphasis
[1:20:06] and it's all orderly just the way god
[1:20:08] likes it
[1:20:10] amen i like verse 31 and elijah took 12
[1:20:13] stones
[1:20:14] according to the number of the tribes of
[1:20:16] the sons of jacob unto whom
[1:20:17] the word lord came saying israel shall
[1:20:19] be thy name and with the stones he built
[1:20:21] an altar in the name of the lord
[1:20:23] and he made a trench about the altar as
[1:20:25] great as would contain two measures of
[1:20:27] seed
[1:20:28] and he put the wood in order see god's
[1:20:30] got to order he likes the word right
[1:20:32] like
[1:20:32] it is praise god can't be all broken up
[1:20:35] it's got to be rightly divided
[1:20:37] put in the right order and he caught the
[1:20:39] bullock on pieces and laid him on the
[1:20:40] wood and said
[1:20:41] fill four barrels with water and pour it
[1:20:44] on the burnt sacrifice
[1:20:45] on the wood he said do it the second
[1:20:47] time and then the second time he said do
[1:20:49] it the third time did the third time
[1:20:50] and the water ran about the altar and he
[1:20:53] filled the trench also with water
[1:20:56] and it came to pass at the time of the
[1:20:57] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:20:59] elijah the prophet came near
[1:21:01] and said lord god of abraham isaac and
[1:21:03] of israel let it be known this day that
[1:21:04] thou art
[1:21:06] god in israel and that i am thy servant
[1:21:08] and that i have done all these things
[1:21:09] at thy word i love that elijah saw it
[1:21:12] all by vision
[1:21:14] that's why he could mock the devil now
[1:21:17] you and i church shouldn't mock the
[1:21:18] devil unless we know what's going to
[1:21:19] happen
[1:21:20] so i've seen people mock the devil and
[1:21:21] then their families fall apart
[1:21:23] i've seen preachers most recent one was
[1:21:26] a preacher
[1:21:26] went around saying uh dumb devil dumb
[1:21:28] devil and his wife
[1:21:30] a few months after that started out in
[1:21:32] the message left the message divorced
[1:21:33] him and now she's with another man
[1:21:35] a preacher in the message i thought oh
[1:21:37] we don't
[1:21:38] we don't do we don't mock the devil
[1:21:40] right because he'll the bible said even
[1:21:42] michael the archangel doesn't bring a
[1:21:44] railing accusation against satan he just
[1:21:46] says the lord rebukes thee
[1:21:49] so see it's different if you've got a
[1:21:50] vision you can go ahead and knock satan
[1:21:52] all you want
[1:21:53] if you've got a prophecy knock them all
[1:21:54] you want that's what elijah did
[1:21:56] but if not we don't want to uh we don't
[1:21:59] want to get satan
[1:22:00] uh all upset and stir him up right
[1:22:03] because that's foolishness that's
[1:22:04] foolish
[1:22:05] to do that because church we're nothing
[1:22:07] without that's exalt
[1:22:08] when we do that we're we're exalting
[1:22:10] ourselves like we have power
[1:22:12] we have no power we're trusting in the
[1:22:14] living god in his power
[1:22:17] so it's pride that would do that pride
[1:22:19] when even an angel won't rebuke satan
[1:22:21] and he's got way more power than we got
[1:22:27] so see we gotta he did all these things
[1:22:30] at thy word now look at verse 37 i love
[1:22:32] this
[1:22:32] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[1:22:35] may know that thou art the lord god and
[1:22:36] that thou hast turn their heart back
[1:22:38] again there it is that's malachi 4.
[1:22:41] hear me because i'm turning the hearts
[1:22:44] back to you
[1:22:44] praise god amen elijah is
[1:22:48] at the showdown turning the hearts back
[1:22:50] well in our day
[1:22:51] it's elijah's message that's turning our
[1:22:53] hearts back
[1:22:54] praise god see it's it's beautiful it's
[1:22:58] just
[1:22:59] uh perfectly put in there
[1:23:03] and then verse 41 skip down there elijah
[1:23:04] said ahab get the up eat and drink for
[1:23:06] there is the sound
[1:23:08] of the abundance of rain amen let's stay
[1:23:11] under our feet i'll stop right there by
[1:23:12] god's grace
[1:23:15] i just wanted you to see some of those
[1:23:16] things about the showdown some of those
[1:23:18] attributes church
[1:23:24] the denominational and remember brother
[1:23:26] that's jezebel religion right
[1:23:28] that's baal that's the doctrine of
[1:23:30] balaam like the church ages talks about
[1:23:33] they will way outwork us and don't they
[1:23:37] they do i've known all these
[1:23:38] denominational people
[1:23:40] they do marathons to raise money to dig
[1:23:43] uh wells in africa and all over and
[1:23:45] that's a great thing
[1:23:47] i don't know i don't know how they find
[1:23:49] the time to do that actually
[1:23:51] but they they labor it but did they but
[1:23:54] then they're half naked then they're
[1:23:55] running around in bikinis basically now
[1:23:57] how does that glorify god
[1:24:00] said you've got to look at the nature of
[1:24:02] it what's the
[1:24:03] what's the desire behind it is it to
[1:24:05] glorify man or glorify god
[1:24:08] well running around in a marathon in a
[1:24:10] bikini that don't glorify god
[1:24:12] so it shows the motivations wrong
[1:24:16] you see how they see how they worship
[1:24:17] for six hours and elijah comes around he
[1:24:20] kills he kills the animal right he pours
[1:24:23] water on it
[1:24:23] elijah's was much shorter
[1:24:27] because it was all directed by the word
[1:24:29] of the lord
[1:24:31] i want you to see that church that
[1:24:32] elijah was a restorer
[1:24:35] before the fire fell and before the rain
[1:24:38] came praise god
[1:24:39] he was a restorer of the hearts the
[1:24:42] hearts were turned back
[1:24:45] and so i want to just encourage you
[1:24:46] church
[1:24:49] let's uh let's use our time
[1:24:53] let's use our uh let's not waste our
[1:24:55] time look at these bail the bail
[1:24:56] religion they waste their time
[1:24:57] in things right they're it's all human
[1:25:01] ideas
[1:25:02] let's invest our time in restoring the
[1:25:04] faith of christ
[1:25:06] let's make sure our lives are restored
[1:25:08] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:25:10] that's what i want to say it's good to
[1:25:12] help the poor like i said i do
[1:25:13] we do you know we we do that but let's
[1:25:16] make sure our lives and our worship is
[1:25:18] restored by the word of the lord
[1:25:20] and then when that rain falls we'll take
[1:25:22] it to work
[1:25:23] we'll take it in the kitchen we'll be
[1:25:26] ready for the coming of the lord
[1:25:28] how many of you how many want to be one
[1:25:29] of those that gets taken off the earth
[1:25:31] that's what i want to be musicians if
[1:25:33] you'll come i want to be taken
[1:25:35] because i've taken christ in my heart
[1:25:39] that the word is restored in my heart my
[1:25:41] worship is restored
[1:25:43] uh my expectations on the lord and i've
[1:25:45] received the meat in due season tonight

[1:25:52] word of prayer here let's ask the lord
