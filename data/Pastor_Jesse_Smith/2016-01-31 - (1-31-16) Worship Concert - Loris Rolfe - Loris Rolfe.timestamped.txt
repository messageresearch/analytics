[15:24] amen let's just take your Bible if you
[15:26] got to little scripture there we're not
[15:27] going to stand I'm not going to real
[15:28] have you because I'm not really going to
[15:29] preach but but uh we want okay let you
[15:32] stand for this first one okay let just I
[15:35] thought about it yeah we better
[15:37] stand 1 Samuel
[15:40] 16:23 this is the course of
[15:43] David for Samuel
[15:46] 16:23 I just got a few I got four more
[15:49] from The Book of Psalms just some
[15:51] scriptures that came to my mind I wrote
[15:52] down before service that just encourage
[15:55] us about the power of song
[15:57] and
[16:01] 1st Samuel
[16:02] 16:23 and it came to pass when the evil
[16:05] spirit from God was upon Saul that David
[16:07] took an harp and played with his hand so
[16:10] Saul was refreshed and was well and the
[16:13] evil spirit departed from him amen amen
[16:16] look at the power of the spirit upon
[16:18] somebody's hands playing music uh let's
[16:22] go to Psalms
[16:27] 33:3
[16:36] let's just read verse one Psalms
[16:38] 33:1 rejoice in the Lord oh ye righteous
[16:42] for praise is calmly for the upright so
[16:45] if you're living upright you love to
[16:47] praise God it's a beautiful thing it's a
[16:49] pleasant thing to praise God praise the
[16:51] Lord with the harp sing unto him with a
[16:53] Sury and an instrument of 10
[16:55] strings or 10 fingers uh sing unto him a
[16:58] new song play skillfully with loud noise
[17:02] I've never heard a more skillful player
[17:04] than brother Loris so we're thankful for
[17:06] the skill God's given him and all the
[17:08] time he's invested into his gift he just
[17:10] didn't sit back and say God just you
[17:12] know quickly give it to me he invested
[17:14] in it we're thankful for that and I like
[17:17] the new song there he said he might have
[17:19] some new songs so praise God Psalms 98
[17:21] verse4 Psalms 98
[17:27] verse4
[17:30] we're familiar with
[17:34] this Psalms 98:4 Make a Joyful Noise
[17:38] unto the Lord all the Earth make a loud
[17:40] noise and rejoice and sing praise sing
[17:43] unto the Lord with a harp with the harp
[17:46] and the voice of a Psalm with trumpets
[17:48] and sound of cornet Make a Joyful Noise
[17:50] before the Lord the king amen glory
[17:54] couple more here uh Psalms 144 verse
[18:06] n 144 verse
[18:10] 9 I will sing a new song unto thee Oh
[18:13] God Upon A Sultry and an instrument of
[18:15] 10 strings will I sing praise unto thee
[18:19] praise God emphasizing the new song
[18:21] There amen and then the last one Psalms
[18:24] 147 verse
[18:27] one
[18:33] we'll read one through three because I
[18:34] think it kind of goes together praise ye
[18:37] the Lord for it is good to sing praises
[18:38] unto our God for it is pleasant and
[18:42] praise is calmly I think when everybody
[18:44] leaves here they're going to see say it
[18:45] was so pleasant to be in the house of
[18:46] the Lord
[18:47] tonight right that's what it is that's
[18:50] what praising the Lord brings a pleasant
[18:51] Spirit to you the Lord does build up
[18:54] Jerusalem see how music Build You Up he
[18:57] gathered together the outcast of
[19:00] Israel Glory he Health the broken in
[19:03] heart and bindeth up their wounds you
[19:05] may be seated it just for a moment here
[19:06] and then I just want to say a few more
[19:08] things I'll was just mention this um I
[19:11] think last Sunday yeah when we were
[19:13] leaving after second service and it's
[19:15] talking about how the spirit Lord would
[19:17] come down in the evening and the cool of
[19:18] the evening we're talking about that and
[19:20] uh always why we love second Services
[19:22] you know um but uh I just wanted to you
[19:25] know just testify I did pray seven years
[19:27] for a piano player and the Lord finally
[19:30] gave me
[19:31] one and uh it was right on time and
[19:33] brother Lis as I said has been a a Godly
[19:35] friend a Godly example before me and
[19:39] I've just told my wife many times I just
[19:40] appreciate his example and I just love
[19:42] sitting and listening to brother Loris
[19:44] you know we we haven't had many we used
[19:45] to go out you know between Services all
[19:47] the time but I've been so busy with the
[19:48] baby we haven't had that but I miss that
[19:50] I miss just sitting and listening to him
[19:51] explaining things like wow he's as sharp
[19:54] as a tack you know I hope I'm I'm that
[19:57] sharp when I'm his age you know
[19:59] but he's so sharp I just uh he can
[20:01] really explain things so well I'm like
[20:03] my I just kind of sit back and admire
[20:05] just the the character that he is and uh
[20:09] and then I was reminded last Sunday
[20:11] night when Loris first started coming uh
[20:15] my daughter that the that first service
[20:17] after we had service went home and uh I
[20:19] think it was AAA just sat at the table
[20:20] for an hour just singing the songs we'
[20:23] sung in church and we're just praising
[20:25] God an hour after we had that first
[20:28] service with brother Loris playing and
[20:30] and I was just crying there at the table
[20:31] just rejoicing God you know she couldn't
[20:33] tell I was watching her you know um and
[20:36] then a couple times after that the first
[20:38] couple Services uh my daughter would
[20:41] look over at my wife and say I'm crying
[20:42] I'm and my wife's like why are you sad
[20:44] she's like I'm not sad it's just there's
[20:46] something about it and we figured out
[20:48] later it was just the
[20:49] music and uh I remember you know crying
[20:51] and praising God too just to have a
[20:53] musician like brother Loris and I still
[20:55] cry I wouldn't cry
[20:57] now uh because it's everybody's so
[20:59] important and every every gift is so
[21:01] important but there is a great
[21:03] importance on Psalms that's why as we
[21:04] saw with J with Joshua and Jericho God
[21:07] used one example from Joshua 6 the order
[21:11] of that that March that parade God used
[21:14] that one example to Forever give us the
[21:16] pattern of how the word should go forth
[21:19] that is so beautiful oh my that the
[21:21] songs that go before the word you know
[21:23] and that just one example gives us our
[21:27] Eternal pattern for how the word should
[21:29] go forth and and so we're just grateful
[21:31] for that and uh just knowing you know
[21:33] that God uh here will will bless our
[21:36] brother and be with us tonight praise
[21:38] God so uh just take your time brother
[21:40] Loris don't be in any rush let's just
[21:42] give Round of Applause praise God God
