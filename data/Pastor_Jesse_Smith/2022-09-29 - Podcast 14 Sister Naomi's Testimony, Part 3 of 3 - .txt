In this final episode, six testimonies are shared about how the Holy Ghost has used Sister Naomi to help the saints in our local assembly. We believe these testimonies will be an encouragement to any sister in the Bible Message God gave to His prophet, brother William Branham. 

Sister Naomi offers a word of encouragement at the conclusion of this episode focusing on the truth of Hebrews 10:35: "Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward."

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] God bless you and welcome to defending the message podcast I'm your co-host Pastor Jesse Smith and I'm Eamon Lee this is part three of our sister Naomi's testimony hopefully the first two parts have been a blessing in part one we saw how God got a hold of our sister at a very young age raising the message and we felt this would be a great blessing to all of our children in our church who are raising the message the Bible revelations that God gave us through his Prophet William Branham and then in part two we got into our sisters battles and victories as she went to high school and college and the Lord was with her despite all the persecution and negative words and attacks from the enemy the Lord helped her overcome especially using Philippians 2 12 about how we're to seek out our own salvation with fear and trembling so here in part three by God's grace we're looking at our sister's testimonies here how God has used her in a great way in our humble little home church here and we trust these testimonies will be a great blessing to you let's start with our first testimony uh we remember the time when he's spoken tongues and during one of our services and can you tell us how that came to be and what you went through so that was some time 2018 and I think I was I was going through a lot of struggles I was battling whether I was filled with the Holy Spirit or not and I remember praying like out of nowhere he just came pray pray that you speak in tongues for a confirmation of the Holy that you have the Holy Spirit and I was praying about it it's something I have never done before I've never spoken in tongues and I prayed about it for a while and then I had forgotten about it and then it happened I came to church I forgot this the sermon that was preached but then it happened in that service and I was like whoa so when I got home I called my dad and I'm like I spoke in tongues I was like and then he said that was his example he's like whoa that's a confirmation that she have the Holy Spirit that was what he said but I had forgotten I was praying about the fact that I wanted to speak in tongues for a confirmation of the Holy Spirit then after a couple of months I remember I was I think I gave a testimony in church and then after that testimony I was battling so strong like you just gave your testimony in church how sure are you that you are saved and it was so strong I was battling it so much like maybe I shouldn't have done that because it's like okay you think you're standing how about if you fall so it was it was a hard time for me then it came to my remembrance that you remember you prayed for the whole you prayed that you speak in tongues for a confirmation of the Holy Spirit and you actually did so immediately that came to my remembrance I'm like oh thank you Jesus like whatever burden it was it just left me and I felt like so free I was I was so free and happy so I prayed about it forget about it God answered it and then he brought it to my remembrance yeah I remember that service when you spoke in tongues I was led to the Lord to preach on spiritual gifts that morning I didn't preach on gifts for years probably and for some reason I remember working really hard on spiritual gifts on my sermon that Saturday the next morning I preach it and then everybody was in one Accord it was a great time of worship and then you spoke in tongues we prayed for the interpretation it never came but it was such a Vindication to me that I was under the right leadership of the Holy Spirit and then you know that tongue also had a major impact on Austin remember Austin's testimony that tongue actually kind of put the fear of God in him and then he left the church shortly after that and brother Austin admitted like he still was loving worldly music and he didn't love the music of God and of course we know God did a lot of things cleaning him out in Arizona God saved Lena and brought it all back here and now everything works together for good to them that love the Lord and I'd love to see how God was working on both sides working through your dad and working through you about the tongue both had the same understanding this was God's confirmation that you are baptized with the Holy Ghost it reminds me of sister Bruce's interview in 1964 when brother Branham saw in the spiritual realm she was born again but brother man prayed God give her a chance to speak in tongues as a confirmation because in her spiritual composition she's the kind of person that would need a sign she would need something emotional to happen and I don't know if it ever did or not but I just thought it was very interesting brother random told her to pray for the gift to speak in tongues now we know in the in the message tongue is a minor gift but it's still a gift of God and it's still the Holy Ghost flowing through somebody but again this all shows us the importance of seeking God and our sisters sought for a sign that she was born again and God was faithful and brought it to her so we want to rejoice in that testimony that's a beautiful testimony next we'll look at a situation that's kind of personal to me my eldest daughter has been such a wonderful Christian example over the years and she's been baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost and just spent in subjection to everything in our home she's been a real good example for us a real model of Christianity but in one season of her life she went through a battle with confusion it was about a six-month battle with this Spirit of confusion she wasn't sure whether she was born again or not and we had prayed numerous times for her and the confusion remained and so God had allowed this test to continue but then one Sunday the Lord was working on sister Naomi's heart we didn't know it we found out later but then God moved using our sister Naomi's gifts and helped deliver my daughter brought her out of confusion into understanding so we'll have our sister share a little bit of background on what the Lord was dealing with her that morning okay so we came it was a Sunday morning we came to church and immediately I got into church I had like this strong feeling that I had to do something I wasn't sure what it was but it was it was so strong on me and then through the song service I was just crying I'm I was asking myself why am I crying I was like I felt I felt the strong power on me and I wasn't sure what it was through the service I was crying and I'm like what's going on so after the service you called us all in front to pray for her and then so immediately you called I was like oh this is what it was so we came forward and then we prayed it was it was good prayer we prayed and then afterwards we went back to our seats we sang and then as the service was ending it was something I I see a lot of my teenage years in her so I kind of relate I really relate with her and we've been talking but as the service was ending something was like go talk to her and I'm like what am I going to say to her her dad is the pastor she knows everything what am I going to say to her but the the edge was so strong and immediately church service and then I was praying but I just got out of my seat and went straight to her and when I was going I'm like what am I going to say to her what what do I have to say so we got there and then I don't know where the words came from but I believe it was from God and then we started talking and then the other sisters also came and then yeah we talked to her and after that I'm like I hope I hope the little we said was a blessing and she said yes it was so it was the next service that we came and then he gave the testimony that it was it was a really good help to her and I was like okay thank God and then afterwards after when I spoke to her like I felt relieved that whatever it was I've been able to accomplish it yeah when I think about that situation you know it was my own daughter coming up for prayer and I remember I was screaming and crying and I was praying for my daughter to get the Victory and I was just rebuking Satan as much as I could and just trusting in the Lord but I noticed you know even when we finish the prayer she was still a little bit looked sad to me I remember after the service I went in my office I came back out and then after a few minutes I came out of the sanctuary and I saw my oldest daughter and she was just glowing a big smile was all over her face and I thought wow maybe God did hear my prayer you know I was thinking maybe like the victory had to come through my prayer you know or something like that but it was a great prayer I mean all the saints were up here praying for my oldest daughter it was a wonderful prayer but when I went back and talked to her it seemed like God used a gift in our sister's life here since Mr Naomi's life Naomi's mother also gave her a word of wisdom and then another sister in our church sister who uh so it seemed like God used these sisters to team up and kind of bring their faith together to talk to my oldest daughter after service and I was thinking about the gifts of the Spirit how every person has a gift of the spirit all the brothers have a gift one of the nine gifts of the Spirit all the sisters have at least one gift to the spirit and when I talked to my oldest daughter she was saying she was in the state of confusion but when sister Naomi and sister Beatrice started talking and the other sisters it's as if all the confusion left well when you look at the scripture when confusion leaves understanding comes and there's a gift for understanding it's called The Gift of knowledge so God in that moment had given our sister Naomi and her mother and the other sisters an understanding of how to help my oldest daughter in that moment it wasn't something that would come through my preaching it wasn't something that was going to come through my prayer in particular God was anointing another member of the body with the same Holy Spirit and God was anointing all of our sisters to bring bring them to bring my oldest daughter words of wisdom and words of knowledge to help set her free and relieve her of all the confusion and now my oldest daughter is rejoicing in the Lord in the service of the Lord constantly serving the lord through her music Ministry often bringing others up in prayer in her role as a spiritual Priestess unto God because we're all Kings and Priests unto God and so God has used our sister Naomi and Beatrice and the other sisters the the gifts of the holy spirit in their lives to help my daughter be free and it's just led to a great season of blessing and peace and victory by God's grace foreign testimony where God used our sister Naomi and her mother was when my wife was expecting our eighth child in the fall of 2020. towards the end of this pregnancy our baby boy was transverse and we'd prayed about it and he wouldn't go head down and so this was quite alarming to my wife and I especially my wife because she was aware that if he doesn't go head down then she would have to have a C-section and anyone that's had a C-section or knows about C-sections knows their their major surgeries and the last thing I want as a husband is see my my wife cut and having to go through a major operation so we come to service on a Wednesday night I don't remember what I preached at all all I remember is that I was really afraid for my wife this is one time where I could say the spirit of fear was on me because I did not want to see my wife have to be cut and um I did not want a major surgery to happen at that time we had a ecv scheduled for the next day which would have been a Thursday and so I called my wife up for prayer and as my wife came up I kind of looked out into the uh the really small church congregation that we have and I think the only people that were in church that night uh because it's a Wednesday night a lot of our people work second shift the only people in church that night were Naomi and her mother Beatrice and so something just came on me I remember the quote where brother Branham said prayers are more effective when you can feel someone's pain and so he had said a mother who has experienced certain things can pray for another mother or a father could pray for another father because they feel it and so I looked out there you know and our sisters had their heads bowed and I thought of that quote from brother Brandon it just kind of came to me I felt like it was the Holy Spirit so I said uh sister Beatrice sister know me can you come up and pray for my wife she's got this ecv tomorrow and we were asking for God's grace and my wife so it goes successfully so my wife doesn't have to have a C-section the last thing we want is a C-section and so then we uh we called our sisters up for prayer okay so I I remember you called us up for prayer and then we came and we're praying and we all wept together and trusting God for a miracle and then after the prayer we hugged and and I could see like uncertainty and into the Christian's eyes like what's gonna happen and it's it's it broke my heart I'm like because I could I could I couldn't even imagine like what she was going to and then after the service we talked and even when we talked like I could I could feel it but then we kept encouraging her it's it's gonna be okay and then you know Satan comes to you okay now that you're telling her it's going to be okay what if it's not okay what if tomorrow she calls she text you or something and it's like a whole different thing so it means that whatever you're saying did not come true my mind we are trusting God we've prayed so the only thing we can do is to trust him and then be be confident that he's had our prayer and then he would answer it and then I remember my mom also talking to you about it and we went home and then we prayed so I did not touch them on Thursday it was on Friday that I texted her and I did not hear anything just still hoping that everything is going to be fine then he sent a picture of the baby I was like whoa when I saw the picture of the BB I just started crying I'm like wow that's that's how quick God can answer prayer it was it was amazing it was amazing yeah it really was a beautiful testimony because I know I was battling fear um and I remember walking out the church door to go outside and shook both your hands and either both of you or one of you just looked at me with such confidence and said all is well brother Jesse it's all going to turn out right and I appreciated your faith but in that moment I was just battling but your faith in that moment really lifted our faith I remember the next day we were driving down to Orville and I remember their prayer so I put on some Christian music and I was just trying to pray while we were going down there and we started seeing God's hand as soon as we got in the hospital for this ecv procedure as soon as we got in the room a nurse came in and somehow we started talking about Jesus right away so I started smiling I started feeling a lot better after that talked about Jesus talked about the Lord and everything was going good we just really felt confident you know we had to wear our ridiculous masks and everything like that but then when the doctor come in he was so kind he was so gentle and he just talked to us real briefly I felt like the atmosphere just stayed really really sweet and I remember he just walked over he took Zion's bottom in his head and just Twisted it he's like we're done like is it over and he's like yep he's all set to go he's head down now and I just started I don't know if I cried or what but I felt like crying I know I feel like crying now because I knew the words that our sisters had spoken and we'd prayed for had come to pass yeah so if this procedure would have not worked she would have had to been admitted for a C-section because our baby was late and so the next day was a Friday and that's the day baby eight came by God's grace little Zion so far we've been through three testimonies and then two of them have deeply impacted our family I remind our listeners that God sent sister Naomi thousands of miles across continents and placed her in our tiny little humble church and God Is Now using her and her gifts directly to impact our family my oldest daughter and now our youngest son as well by God's grace so this I'll encourage any listener God has ordered your footsteps the foot says the righteous are ordered of the Lord sometimes God may call you to leave the ones you love the most God May separate you from your family God May separate you from your Homeland but God has a purpose for your life and he he wants to use you to help support the body of Christ foreign let's go to our next testimony we remember when brother Randy was here as our guest preacher and your daughter Eden got sick with a fever and could you talk about that and how God healed her from her fever so my daughter had had fever for I think three or four days and I was starting to get concerned because she didn't look like she was getting better she was getting weaker and weaker every day and she could get like so hot and I was thinking of taking it to the hospital to the emergency because it wasn't getting better and that evening we came for it was a special service we were having and then we came to church and she was sleeping the whole time and she was so hot like I could feel her body heat she was so hot and I was I was like should I take her to the hospital because it wasn't it wasn't too good and she was she was sleeping the whole time she wasn't active or anything and then after the service they said if you have need of prayer come up so I brought her up and then we prayed and then immediately I went back to my seat I realized her body temperature had normalized like she was she was no longer as hard as she she was and then I mean through the service she was sleeping she got up and then she started singing and clapping her hands and I was like whoa okay and then after church she was talking to she was talking to the kids and this is something she hasn't done in like three four days and I was like wow so I was like God healed her and you know Satan always comes what if it's your mind maybe she's just I'm like no this is not how she came to church I was like okay let's wait till the next day and see so I had a little bit of Doubt God forgive me and then the next day she was fine she was playing with her sisters and I was like she actually got healed she was she was healed I I can I can Satan can talk me out of it she was healed because she had had it for a couple of days so to see her like instantly changing then start playing and talking with her sisters yeah God definitely healed her yes this testimony again shows us how Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I mean over the years how many people have we prayed for with fevers right and I always go to I always think of the scripture where Jesus laid his hands on Peter's mother-in-law when she had a fever and she was instantly healed and what did you she instantly got up and served and so in Eden's case she was prayed for Jesus touched her and she instantly got up and praised the Lord and she's been praising the Lord ever since that's right by God's grace singing and worshiping the Lord how she does so we're very grateful for how the Lord Jesus Christ healed her proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now we've prayed for different fevers and the people get well the next day but never had we seen one instantly this was the first time we'd ever seen someone lay their hands on the sick with a fever and the the child instantly recovered and so we just rejoiced in that this was a great testimony you know for Naomi's family but also for brother Randy I share with brother Randy it was a great blessing to him he had never had that type of what we would call like a miracle because it's instantaneous there was no medicine involved or anything like that it was just instant power of God to take down the body temperature so I know that was a great blessing to him and that was a great way to start off our weekend because we had uh we had Services uh Friday Saturday Sunday and that was a Friday night service it led into the Saturday night where brother Randy gave his testimony we had a long line I remember we had like eight to ten people come up for prayer and it was just a highly anointed service and God God used our brother in a great way and of course we have to say God used our sister's Faith as well because she had Faith to bring the child to church after three or four days of having a fever and then bring her up for prayer so it's again a great testimony of uh of God using someone's faith to bring about supernatural work by the Holy Spirit foreign for the fifth testimony we want to look at a testimony relating to Sister Nomi as a mother and like all mothers you know she desires her children to be saved and baptized Sanctified filled with the holy spirit so in October 2021 it was a Wednesday night service and that was the night where the Lord moved on two of Naomi's daughters to be baptized so we'd like her to be able to share about that God had been working on them for over a year and we think this would be a wonderful testimony encouraging our parents to wait upon the Lord seek the Lord for their children's salvation and trust that God hears all of our prayers and he'll save our children so my oldest daughter had been asking to be baptized I think probably when she turned six but I thought she was she was too young and I wondered whether she understood what baptism was all about she had asked a couple of times sometimes at home when we are praying she would cry and say she wants to be baptized by I always felt like it wasn't the right time she probably did not understand what she wanted and then I remember some time too she came to church and I had no idea she had done this but she went to the pastor and told the pastor she wanted to be baptized that was after church that the pastor told me and I was like oh okay and I did not want it to be like I was hindering her from getting baptized but I wanted her to also understand I wanted to be sure that she understood what the baptism was about so she had done it for a while and then one time we're praying at home and then after the prayer she was like I wonder when I could ever get baptized and I felt so bad I'm like am I preventing her so I started praying about it I'm like good like show me if it is time for her to baptize to be baptized if she understands what she's trying to get into then after a while my second daughter also started so I was like oh she's probably copying her older sister that was the first thing that came to my mind she's copying her older sister so I remember um it was in the I think in 2020 she had asked I think she that was when she went to the pasture to Accent then I remember you said you had gone to um take your friends is it like a tub or a pool something so she went to the she came to you to ask to be baptized and then you talked to me about it and I was I wasn't too sure but I mean once she had come forward to she was bold enough to come to you to ask I was like okay and then I think we had scheduled it then I went to talk to her and I I kind of talked her out of it because I felt like she was not ready then she was like oh okay yeah she's not ready for it so I think I came back to you and told you she's not ready so she you took it back and then we we had been going back and forth with it she's been coming to tell me she wanted to get baptized and I always brush it off so that Wednesday service we came and then you preached about repentance and salvation and it was just a few of us in the church and my eyes were closed after the service we were praying my eyes were closed and then you asked if anybody wanted to be baptized and then my eyes were closed I heard you say two people have lifted up their hands and I'm like who are these I'm definitely sure nature is one but who is the second person and I knew your daughters to like those who were old enough were already baptized so I was like I I never thought it was my second daughter no way so when you called for me to come and I opened my eyes and I'm like I was like whoa okay I mean and and the spirit of God like the presence of God was so strong in that service so I mean if she had lifted up she has lifted up her hands then I I couldn't object it and I was I had been praying about it I'm like God I want to be sure that this is it so I believe that Wednesday evening was an answer to prayer and then we prayed and days after service I talked to them and they seemed like they really understood what they wanted to do so by God's grace they got baptized then it was awesome I felt like it was just the right time for them to do it like God had answered my prayer and it was the right timing and it wasn't just for the one I was praying for but it was for both so very thankful for that yeah so it kind of turned out to be a double blessing right you know you we we knew for sure you knew for sure one of them wanted to be baptized and then it's like God was gracious and gave you the other daughter to be baptized as well that was certainly a highly anointed service see how the spirit of the Lord was dealing heavy with me on my on my heart because we had visitors and I wanted them to hear the gospel and it fit what the series I was currently teaching at that time so I labored on what real repentance is I think I went through like 23 examples of sins that keep you from getting the Holy Ghost and at the end I since we had visitors I wanted to invite anyone to get saved or baptized and the first two hands I saw love for Naomi's daughters and it was such a special moment I still remember I kneeled down and started talking to them about the Lord and we're all crying it was such a beautiful anointing of the holy spirit because I realized these are really sincere genuine Hearts coming to the Lord I always think about my life I couldn't surrender I wanted to surrender to God before many times in my life but I never could surrender so it just made me full of joy to see a seven-year-old and a five-year-old weeping as I pray and lead them through this a sinner's prayer from the scripture just how we're we're all guilty of sin we all just we all fall short of the glory of God but Jesus died for me and the cross paid for all my sins and took away all my transgressions and now I'm saved I'm going to heaven and I'm such a wonderful moment and then the visitor's daughter came up for prayer as well and I led her in the very similar prayer repented of her sins and then it was a maybe a week or two later and we went out to the lake and baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you know your two daughters have been here Faithfully serving God singing with all their hearts all the boldness in their hearts praising the Lord they've just been wonderful examples of Christians feet washing taking communion asking great Bible questions whenever we do the children's Bible studies ask great questions and have a lot of understanding of the scriptures we've had visitors come and notice how these children in particular and all the children but Naomi's children in particular have a lot of biblical knowledge and a lot of biblical understanding and so God has given them a lot of understanding for their age and so people can notice that that the spirit of God is working on them and drawing them closer to him so we rejoice in a Mother's desire for her children's baptism to be sincere and genuine her patience to wait on the Lord and most importantly God's faithfulness to save the Sheep let's get to our last testimony and our last testimony happened in February of this year and it's our most recent one and we're thankful that God answered our prayer and you sister Naomi's to answer this prayer and could you go more into that with that sister on me of what happened during the service and what led you to pray for sister Lino's mom it was a it was a Wednesday service and then after this someone he she came up instantly and I came up for prayer and then I remember Jesse calling us to come and pray with her when he called I was like wow um I mean he has he has that confidence to call to to pray with her so we came and then we all prayed it was I mean everyone in the church we all came and then we prayed and it was it was it was quite an intense prayer so it was the next day I received a text from from the pastor that she had been found and I remember I was sitting in the house and I just started crying I'm like it is it is amazing to know that in our own little humble way when we pray like this big God hears us and he's concerned about us to to answer our prayers I mean he doesn't have to but it is comforting to know that we can we can go into his presence and go there with confidence and live with the assurance that he answers prayers and and once we pray With all sincerity he would answer it and what amazed me is how quickly he answered it like how quickly and I think so so you had been preaching at the beginning of the year the disciple whom Jesus loved and then you put us in there that we are loved of the Lord so it was it was really um encouraging to me to know that we are loved of the Lord and he listens to us when we pray and he's he's gracious enough to answer our prayers like that quickly it was It was a a big blessing to me yeah again that was a very highly anointed Wednesday night service as well that's what I've been sharing with the church and just as a reminder to all of us I need the reminder too but God can move any day of the week it don't have to be Sunday morning you know usually we have the most strength on Sunday morning but God has really been moving a lot on Wednesday nights and also Sunday nights you know but from my perspective you know I had I heard Lena's requests and it was for her mother she's bound this sickness and just drove away and Nina didn't know where her mother was and she'd been missing for numerous days and so this was a and with her disease it was a very desperate moment Lena didn't want to lose her mom so before service Lena's boyfriend Austin had asked me to pray for Lena's mother who had been missing for a couple of days due to her disease she took the car and left and brother Austin had said can you and brother Jose pray for her mother that she'll be found and so I said yeah brother I said at the end of the service we'll do that well our brother Jose wasn't able to make service that night and as we were closing service I'd preached about the disciple whom Jesus loved and as I was leaving stepping away from the pulpit I remembered that's right Austin wanted me to pray for Lena's mom so then I announced it and I invited up all the saints sister Naomi sister Beatrice sister Lena brother Austin and we just came up here to the front and I said let's just join hands and let's plead for Lena's mother's life and we just join hands and as we prayed uh the prayer got more and more sincere more desperate we must have prayed for 5 10 15 minutes I don't know how long we prayed but I Remember by the time we got done my hands were hurting because I was squeezing squeezing Austin's hands so hard just believing in faith just crying out that God will save this lost mother and as we pray the prayers got louder and more intense than our the Holy Spirit came on sister know me and she shouted out twice she said Jesus Jesus and that's when we really started crying and really started praying I heard Lena crying and praying shouting and rejoicing I was shouting and we were just really moved by the Holy Spirit it was one of those just special moments where you know like you know God's presence was there and then brother Austin started shouting Satan get out Satan get out Satan get out and he was shouting at the top of his lungs and so I just recognized that he was he was rebuking Satan and uh and so we prayed we were you know all crying and then we brought it to a close and then the next day I got a text from from Sister Lina and brother Austin saying that the cops had found her mother thank God she was alive and uh right there I just started rejoicing praising the Lord and again just I was so encouraged because God had answered a prayer so quickly and Lena's sister then called me the next day and I gave her some Biblical scriptures about how her mom can repent of certain things that she'd done and so I gave her a list of scriptures and uh Nina's sister shared it with her mother and a few days after that Lena's mother called her and apologized for a few things she had done and so after I heard that I was even more blessed because when I went back to the prayer that we had that Wednesday night our sister Naomi was shouting Jesus Jesus Jesus dropped down and then also was out shouting Satan get out Satan get out for the wrongs Lena's mother had done she repented of those and so it was like Jesus came down and then Satan had to leave and Lena's mother was able to get repentance and forgiveness through that situation a wonderful testimony by the grace of God foreign ful testimonies that the Lord has done of course these are not all the testimonies but these are the ones that I could think of on a short notice and we're so thankful God has used our sister in these wonderful ways it reminds me when brother random said sisters can be used by God in all nine gifts of the Holy Spirit and of course you find that in the Bible Philip had four virgin daughters who prophesied Anna was a prophetess in the time of the birth of our Lord Jesus God used her through prophecy and revelation whenever each time you may have no questions to get to it if I can but this was an important question I want to know if it was wrong for women to test people or to sing or give messages or prophecy and the church no it isn't wrong it's uh as long as it comes in the place of order I think the church is an honor and not only when the real true way to do it is for those who speak with tongues and things their messages are given before the message from the pulpits never doing that town called the holy spirit's moving just from one place up there but women are activities with prophecy and gifted with tongues and interpret interpretations and everything with new preachers they're not to be preachers they're forbidden to preach in the churches that's right basically or be a teacher or anything in the church but as far against the woman has all those that can occupy one or any of those nine spiritual gift cards First Corinthians 12 times message should not come forth in its place it's in each message waits for its Clues [Laughter] he comes forward begins to move through him see then when he's finished then messages again come here than just before it's the only reason I've always been a woman does have life and so we fell our sister's testimony would be a great encouragement to other sisters in the message who want to be used by God they want to see their families saved and they want the Lord Jesus Christ to have full preeminence in their lives so sister as we close are there some words of encouragement we want to give to other sisters who in the message and who are Desiring for the Lord Jesus Christ to use them in a wonderful way to be a blessing to others and just be led by the Holy Spirit okay I would say that you you should know God for yourself and and hold on to him don't let anybody or any situation talk you out of it like be convinced and then hold on hold on to your faith if you're not rock solid then whatever trial whatever situation that comes you find yourself wavering so no God and then be sincere I I strongly believe that God honors the sincerity of our hearts be as sincere as possible and and put God first I mean yeah you're going to fall short so many times but it's your sincerity with God that is that is what will help you come out of those shortfalls and then um believe in your prayer I mean of course most of the time we fill in adequate we feel like and when you're called up for prayer or you're praying that's when Satan brings up like all the wrongs that you have done and it's kind of shakes you up a bit you're wondering if God is actually listening but then the blood of Jesus has taken care of that the Bible says once we confess our sins is faithful and just to forgive us I had a preacher say that God forgives us but you have to also forgive yourself you have to get past the guilt so once you confess your sins and you come to God in sincerity like believe in your prayer believe that God answers when you come into the presence of God in your prayer you pray with all confidence that God will answer it he may not answer it there and then but he definitely has had it and at the right time he's gonna answer it so have have confidence in the god that she said amen praise the Lord sister thanks for sharing what was on your heart to be an encouragement to our sisters you know your words remind me of Hebrews 10 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward such an encouragement for us to have confidence in Christ he died so we could have confidence in him he sent us holy ghost so we could have confidence in him so we follow Philippians 2 12 like you suggested in part two how that scriptures helped you so much if we approach the Lord with fear and trembling working out our own salvation and if we keep the confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ then surely God will perform his perfect will in our lives and we can have rejoicing and that God is in full control of our lives and give us the victory foreign testimony of sister Naomi I know God will bless her greatly with more testimonies that will stare in the future and that may you continue to defend the word and that may God be with you in everything you do praise the Lord according to Philippians 1 verse 7 and 1 verse 17 we must defend the message we must defend the gospel the faith that was once delivered to the Saints thank you for listening and may the Lord Jesus Christ anoint you to defend the message foreign
