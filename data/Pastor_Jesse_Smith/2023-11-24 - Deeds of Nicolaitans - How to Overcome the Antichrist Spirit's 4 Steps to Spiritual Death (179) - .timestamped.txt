[0:03] Paul with the Holy Ghost had caught that
[0:06] in the spirit and the Holy Ghost was
[0:08] warning them of the last days don't you
[0:11] remember how Jesus spoke of it the Deeds
[0:13] of the nickens which finally become a
[0:15] Doctrine and then become an organization
[0:18] Brethren we're not in darkness now
[0:19] remember see here we
[0:23] are greetings friends in the matchless
[0:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:28] purpose of this video is to define the
[0:30] Deeds the nickads identify examples that
[0:33] hinder churches today both message
[0:35] churches and those are churches that
[0:37] follow the Bible revelations of God's
[0:39] Prophet brother William brandham and
[0:41] non- message churches and then also to
[0:44] show by the Bible how we overcome the
[0:46] Deeds of the nicians just a brief
[0:48] introduction for those who don't know me
[0:50] I'm Pastor Jesse Smith I have believ the
[0:52] Bible revelations of God's Prophet
[0:54] William brandham since late 2001 and I
[0:57] preached these Bible revelations for
[0:59] nearly 20 years and I pastored the same
[1:00] church for 17 years I've written two
[1:03] books defending God's Prophet brother
[1:05] brandham and his bible-based message and
[1:07] I'll gladly email you the PDFs for free
[1:09] if you cannot afford them here's outline
[1:11] for this video first we'll give the
[1:14] definition of and summarize the Deeds of
[1:16] the nians second we'll look at the
[1:18] origin of the Deeds third we'll see the
[1:21] four-step process of death in both the
[1:23] Old and New Testaments fourth we'll look
[1:26] at brother Ram's teachings on 14
[1:28] examples of the Deeds and doctrines of
[1:30] the
[1:31] nians fifth we'll look at nine doctrines
[1:34] of devils which are examples of
[1:36] doctrines of the nicians six we'll look
[1:38] at how Holy Ghost filled Christians can
[1:40] only allow Deeds for a short time
[1:44] seventh we'll listen to a
[1:46] 1951 Rapture Prophecy from Brother
[1:49] William Brenham about denominational
[1:52] bears being broken down before the
[1:54] Rapture and eighth and finally will end
[1:56] with how to overcome the Deeds of the
[1:58] nicians so let's begin with definition
[2:01] of and summary of the Deeds of
[2:03] nicians the Deeds of the nicians are the
[2:06] first step in a four-step process of
[2:09] antichrist
[2:10] religion another way to say it is the
[2:12] first step in the four-step process of
[2:15] spiritual death in Revelation 2 Jesus
[2:18] says he himself and the True Vine the
[2:21] True Believers hate the Deeds of nicians
[2:24] the word deeds in the Greek means Acts
[2:26] or undertakings and nians means victory
[2:30] of the people which can also mean
[2:32] Conquering the leoty and so these Deeds
[2:35] are undetected acts the Antichrist
[2:38] Spirit injects into churches and these
[2:42] Deeds later progress into doctrines so
[2:46] Satan uses what seem to be harmless
[2:48] Deeds to get victory over people and
[2:52] often begins by deceiving religious
[2:54] leaders who legalize sinful deeds in
[2:57] churches James 1:4 14 and 15 show this
[3:01] four-step process of death the scripture
[3:03] says but every man is tempted when he's
[3:05] drawn away of his own lust and enticed
[3:07] then when lust hath conceived it brings
[3:09] forth sin and sin when it's finished
[3:12] brings forth death so the four-step
[3:15] process is enticed by sin the second is
[3:18] lust conceived the third step is sin and
[3:21] the last step is
[3:23] death now let's look at the origin of
[3:26] the Deeds mentioned earlier in
[3:29] Revelation 2: 5 and 6 Jesus tells the
[3:32] Ephesian Church age that they left their
[3:34] first love and then in verse 6 the
[3:37] scripture says but this thou Hast that
[3:39] thou hatest the Deeds of the nickens
[3:41] which I also hate Jesus Christ
[3:43] identifies the Deeds as the first step
[3:46] of antichrist religion and then he
[3:48] defines the Second Step as doctrine of
[3:50] the nians seen in Revelation
[3:54] 2:15 the third step is bism found in
[3:58] Revelation 2:14 also called the doctrine
[4:00] of balum and the fourth and final step
[4:03] is Jezebel religion also called the
[4:05] depths of Satan found in Revelation 2:20
[4:09] and Revelation
[4:12] 2:4 Third let's look at the four-step
[4:14] process of death in the Old Testament
[4:16] and the New Testament here's a visual to
[4:18] explain this four-step process of
[4:20] spiritual death in both the Old and New
[4:23] Testament we'll start in the far left
[4:25] column which is the column listing the
[4:28] four types of horses from the first four
[4:31] seals the first horse is white second
[4:34] red third black fourth pale and anyone
[4:37] that follows brother Ram's bible-based
[4:39] ministry will know brother ROM preached
[4:40] the revelation of the Seven Seals and
[4:42] these four horse riders were defined as
[4:45] the spirit of antichrist the spirit of
[4:48] death now in the second column from the
[4:50] left is where we get the Deeds of the
[4:52] nicadan this is the meaning of the first
[4:55] four seals out of the Seven Seals so the
[4:58] white horse
[5:00] represents deception and this deception
[5:02] is done through the Deeds of
[5:04] nicians it's the first step of the
[5:06] Antichrist process to try to bring
[5:09] spiritual death upon people remember
[5:12] friends this Antichrist spirit is
[5:14] defeated by the lion anointing the Holy
[5:17] Ghost
[5:17] anointing the red horse represents the
[5:20] Antichrist Spirit killing influence of
[5:23] real
[5:24] Believers this is where the Deeds of the
[5:26] nicians advance to false doctrines or
[5:29] doctrines of the
[5:32] nicians and the doctrine of nicians is
[5:34] defeated by the Holy Ghost anointing of
[5:36] the ox third the black horse is the
[5:40] Antichrist Spirit capturing wealth and
[5:42] bringing false Unity this Antichrist
[5:45] Spirit produces the doctrine of balum
[5:48] remember balum United Israel with the
[5:51] moabites I believe it led to 24,000
[5:54] deaths of Israel if I'm not
[5:55] mistaken this Antichrist spirit is
[5:58] defeated by the man anointed
[6:00] fourth and finally is the pale horse
[6:01] rider the pale horse rider is spiritual
[6:04] death that's the name of the rider
[6:05] According To Jesus and this is also
[6:08] known as Jezebel religion or the depths
[6:10] of Satan but the Pale Rider is defeated
[6:13] by the Flying Eagle anointing that's
[6:15] prophetic anointing that God sent
[6:17] through the ministry of brother William
[6:19] brandham this four-step Antichrist
[6:21] Spirit was foretold in the Old Testament
[6:24] through the Book of Joel chapter 1 and 2
[6:26] where it speaks of the cankerworm
[6:28] caterpillar worm and Locust notice it's
[6:31] the same insect in four stages just like
[6:34] the four horse riders were the same
[6:36] Rider just in four different stages now
[6:40] brother Bram told us the meaning of
[6:41] these in the sermon restoration of the
[6:43] brid tree from 1962 Easter Sunday
[6:46] brother Ram said the cankerworm eats
[6:48] away the fruits of the Holy Spirit such
[6:50] as Joy from the Believers the next stage
[6:53] of the insect is the caterpillar and
[6:55] brother Ram says this is the caterpillar
[6:56] eating the leaves of the Bride tree or
[6:59] taking away the Fellowship of the
[7:02] Saints the third step is the Palmer worm
[7:04] and brother Ram tells us that's the
[7:06] Antichrist Spirit eating away the
[7:08] doctrine or the bark of the Bride
[7:11] tree and the fourth and final step is
[7:13] the Locust the mature insect and this
[7:16] Locust eats the pulp of the tree or the
[7:18] life of the tree eats away the salvation
[7:21] of the tree and that's a great
[7:23] Revelation perhaps I'll do a video on
[7:25] that how some people if they're not born
[7:27] again can lose their salvation According
[7:29] To Jesus Revelation 3:5 is Jesus's own
[7:33] word saying he that overcometh the same
[7:35] shall be clothed in white rment and I
[7:36] will not blot out his name out of the
[7:38] book of life but I will confess his name
[7:41] before my father and before his angels
[7:43] so there it is the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:45] says if someone is not born again and
[7:48] they choose to leave the faith they can
[7:51] have their names blotted out of the book
[7:54] of life but of course Holy Ghost filled
[7:56] Saints have their names written in the
[7:57] Lamb's Book of Life and their names can
[7:59] never never be blotted
[8:00] out same truth is found in Jesus's
[8:03] parable of the four grounds in Luke
[8:05] 88:13 the second kind of ground where
[8:08] the seed falls on a Stony ground Jesus
[8:11] said they receive the word with joy and
[8:13] these have no root for which for a while
[8:17] believe and in the time of Temptation
[8:18] fall away so these are people like Judas
[8:21] es scarat who beli for a while their
[8:23] names were written on the Book of Life
[8:25] in heaven because they had a confession
[8:26] of
[8:27] Faith but then in the time of test they
[8:29] fell away and their names were blotted
[8:32] out of The Book of
[8:34] Life moving on to the fourth section
[8:37] here let's look at brother Brand's
[8:38] teaching on 14 examples of deeds and
[8:41] doctrines of the
[8:43] nians and Friends these examples are
[8:45] coming from Brother brandom's Church age
[8:47] book pages
[8:49] 91-96 then also on pages 366 through
[8:54] 381 so on these Pages brother random
[8:57] says with the Deeds of the nickol leans
[8:59] Holy Ghost leadership gets replaced by
[9:02] man's leadership and the clergy become a
[9:05] holy priesthood that stands above the
[9:07] leoty brother Ram said they go right
[9:09] back to the aonic system so legalism but
[9:13] we must have the leadership of the Holy
[9:15] Ghost through men Anointed with the Holy
[9:17] Ghost as brother randam used Hebrews 13:
[9:20] 7 and 8 this is the leadership the
[9:23] apostles had in the book of Acts so the
[9:26] first two examples brother R gives is
[9:28] Apostolic success ession and church
[9:30] membership these were the first Deeds of
[9:32] the nickol adans that turned into
[9:34] doctrines so this is seen most easily in
[9:36] the Roman Catholic Church they have
[9:38] Apostolic succession claiming they have
[9:41] popes all the way back to St Peter which
[9:44] of course is a lie and they have all
[9:46] these man-made requirements for church
[9:47] membership those are deeds and doctrines
[9:49] of the nicians a third example brother
[9:52] Rand gives is about the anointing of the
[9:54] Holy Ghost brother Ram says Roman
[9:57] Catholics replace the real real baptism
[9:59] of the Holy Ghost with
[10:01] transubstantiation the wafer and the
[10:04] wine given from the Roman Catholic
[10:06] priest to the
[10:07] believer the fourth example of the Deeds
[10:09] that turn to doctrines is water baptism
[10:11] brother brandham said that Catholics
[10:13] pour water on people instead of full
[10:16] immersion in water so message Believers
[10:19] should be careful that the water baptism
[10:21] is not perverted by baptizing in the
[10:23] name of William brandham that's
[10:25] blasphemy that's heresy we should only
[10:27] baptize In The Name Of The Lord Jesus
[10:29] Christ fifth example brother brandham
[10:31] gives is that priests become holier than
[10:34] the leoty or preachers become holier
[10:36] than the Ley brother Ram said every L
[10:39] member should have a leading of the Holy
[10:40] Ghost and brother Ram cites 1
[10:42] Corinthians
[10:44] 14:26 every one of you have a Psalm
[10:47] haveth a Doctrine have a tongue have a
[10:48] revelation ha an
[10:50] interpretation so I believe this affects
[10:52] message churches and non- message
[10:54] churches the leoty and message churches
[10:57] cannot expect all the anointing to be on
[10:58] the PRI preachers each Ley member each
[11:01] believer in Jesus Christ should have an
[11:04] anointing of the Holy Ghost a leading of
[11:06] the Holy Ghost to edify the congregation
[11:09] every service brother Braham tells us
[11:11] that each person must be as interested
[11:13] as the pastor in getting their Ministry
[11:16] into the local church that's from church
[11:19] order 1963 let's listen to the quote and
[11:23] then like this if brother Neville say
[11:27] well I let me pardon me let me say this
[11:29] if brother Collins speaks with tongue
[11:32] and brother Hickerson gives the
[11:36] interpretation
[11:38] then they have a Ministry together for
[11:42] the
[11:43] church now that isn't the ministry of
[11:45] brother
[11:46] naville that's your ministry to the
[11:49] church I'm giving this as example then
[11:52] you Brethren should be just as
[11:54] interested in getting your ministry in
[11:58] the place in the house of God as a
[12:01] pastor is interested in getting his
[12:03] because it's just essential that you do
[12:07] it next brother random gives the sixth
[12:09] seventh eth and Ninth examples of Deeds
[12:12] of the
[12:13] nicians the sixth one is the pope is
[12:15] called the Vicor of Christ the seventh
[12:17] is Purgatory the eighth is mass the
[12:20] ninth is paying money to get out of
[12:22] hell moving on to Pages 366 through 381
[12:27] brother random gives the 10th example of
[12:29] the Deeds of nicadan he said the clergy
[12:31] set themselves in ranks one above the
[12:34] other in my humble opinion this is
[12:36] starting to manifest in message churches
[12:38] because as my video last year showed
[12:41] there's a goat debate amongst message
[12:43] Believers the tape church ministry call
[12:46] themselves the greatest of all time and
[12:48] then there's message preachers that are
[12:49] not in the tape Church movement who call
[12:51] themselves the greatest of all time to
[12:53] my humble opinion this is an example of
[12:55] the Deeds of the nicians getting into
[12:57] these churches they're exalting
[12:59] themselves as the greatest of all time
[13:01] according to the Bible the only
[13:03] believers who argued about the greatest
[13:05] of all time were those who were not born
[13:07] again Jesus's disciples were disputing
[13:09] among themselves who was the greatest in
[13:11] Mark
[13:12] 9:34 so that's Bible proof that people
[13:15] who debate about who's the greatest
[13:16] probably are not born again the 11th
[13:19] example brother ROM gives is overseers
[13:22] holding that their title Bishop meant a
[13:26] little more than just a local
[13:27] responsibility now in my opinion I think
[13:29] this is rare at least in the United
[13:31] States but no doubt overseas this
[13:33] happens it's when pastors try to Pastor
[13:36] more than one church or travel too much
[13:39] while still taking ties from their home
[13:41] Church of course there are times when
[13:43] there's a brand new church and they
[13:45] don't have a pastor and one Pastor may
[13:47] have to help them out for a while but
[13:49] the goal of every Pastor should be to
[13:51] lead just one Church be the Sovereign
[13:54] leader appointed by the Holy Ghost over
[13:57] just one Church three more examples I
[14:00] found of the early church battling the
[14:02] deeds and doctrines of the nicians was
[14:04] from my 2021 book about the 12 New
[14:06] Testament Mysteries I found that the
[14:09] churches of Rome started compromising on
[14:12] holidays so that's the 12th deed or
[14:14] doctr the nicadan they started partaking
[14:16] in the sinful parts of
[14:19] holidays 13th they started idolatry when
[14:23] poar visited Rome in 155 ad there was an
[14:27] idol of St Peter and the so-called Roman
[14:30] Christians lit candles placed it before
[14:32] the statue of St Peter and bowed to the
[14:35] Statue 14th example is the Eucharist
[14:38] making the wafer or bread equal to the
[14:41] body of Jesus Christ which we know it is
[14:43] not the bread is just a symbol of the
[14:45] broken body of
[14:47] Christ moving on to part five let's look
[14:50] at nine doctrines of devils by God's
[14:52] grace I preached on this last year in
[14:55] 2022 and these are examples of Deeds
[14:57] that became doctrines of devils and the
[15:00] doctrines of devils is spoken of in 1
[15:02] Timothy
[15:03] 4:1 in the latter times some shall
[15:06] depart from the faith giving heeds to
[15:07] seducing spirits and doctrines of
[15:10] devils the first one is mandatory
[15:12] celibacy that's 1 Timothy
[15:14] 4:3 doesn't really impact message
[15:17] churches more so Roman Catholics second
[15:21] is a mandatory vegetarian diet 1 Timothy
[15:24] 4:3 the third deed or doctrine of the
[15:27] nicians is the rapture has already
[15:29] happened it's in the past that's
[15:31] according to 2 Timothy
[15:33] 2:8 and this is equivalent to message
[15:35] people saying we're already in the
[15:37] Millennium so that's a doctrine of a
[15:39] devil fourth there's a doctrine of a
[15:41] devil that we no longer have to fast
[15:43] that's according to Philippians 3:19 and
[15:46] Mark
[15:47] 2:20 I had a message Pastor tell me one
[15:50] time that the Lord returned in the 1963
[15:53] Cloud so we had no need to fast and of
[15:56] course that led to his unhealthy
[15:58] lifestyle
[15:59] a lot of health problems and that's a
[16:01] false Doctrine the fifth doctrine of a
[16:04] devil is turning Grace into lawlessness
[16:06] or Lous out of Jude 1:4 and Hebrews
[16:10] 12:14 now the equivalent to this is once
[16:12] saved always saved that's the extreme
[16:15] calvinistic view or everyone will go to
[16:18] heaven which is
[16:20] universalism yes God gives Grace but
[16:22] Grace must be received Grace cannot be
[16:25] Trot in underfoot and once saved always
[16:28] saved only applies to the predestinated
[16:31] elect the wise virgin and the foolish
[16:33] virgin who are saved but once saved
[16:36] always saved does not apply to people
[16:38] like Judas scariot and that's according
[16:40] to Jesus's own words as in Luke 8:13 and
[16:43] Revelation 3:5 because Jesus said he
[16:46] will blot out names out of The Book of
[16:48] Life six is that false doctrine of the
[16:51] Prosperity Gospel God always wants you
[16:53] Healthy and Wealthy this is a doctrine
[16:55] of a devil according to 2 Peter 2 18-20
[16:59] James 2:5 and 2 Corinthians 12
[17:03] 6-12 brother R plainly tells us it is
[17:06] not always God's will to heal brother
[17:08] Ram told us to first get a clear-cut
[17:10] decision from God about whether it's
[17:12] God's will or not to heal as in the case
[17:15] of sister stuff's dead baby from Germany
[17:18] and I made a quote video about that if
[17:19] you'd like to watch that and his brother
[17:21] Bram told us and works as Faith Express
[17:24] 1965 he said Your Divine Healing quote
[17:27] it must be revealed first end
[17:29] quote the seventh doctrine of a devil is
[17:32] presuming and exalting brother brandham
[17:34] and his followers as the greatest of all
[17:36] time and the people that propagate this
[17:39] lie never say except for Jesus and of
[17:42] course I made a video on that if you'd
[17:43] like to watch that this is according to
[17:45] Matthew 20:23 and 2 Corinthians
[17:49] 10:12 the eighth doctrine of a devil is
[17:51] that rapturing faith is literally on the
[17:54] tapes of brother brandham this is
[17:56] against the Bible the Bible plain L says
[17:58] rapturing faith is an anointing Sent
[18:00] From Heaven it's going to be poured out
[18:02] from Heaven according to James 5:7 Joel
[18:05] 2:23 through 26 and Zechariah
[18:09] 10:1 this is a doctrine of a devil of
[18:11] course propagated by the tape Church
[18:14] movement who worship every word on the
[18:16] tapes and the ninth doctrine of a devil
[18:19] is making a tradition out of brother
[18:20] brandom's life this is according to
[18:22] Psalm 101:3 and John
[18:25] 5:45 and the example I gave while
[18:28] preaching ing this sermon is some people
[18:31] will take brother Ram's quotes out of
[18:33] context where brother Ram said he
[18:35] watched certain movies but brother Ram
[18:37] doesn't tell us how much he watched of
[18:39] the movies and so then the enemy will
[18:42] get into that and he'll anoint preachers
[18:44] to allow themselves and other people to
[18:46] watch any movies they want and of course
[18:48] present sinful things before their eyes
[18:51] and so that breaks Psalm
[18:53] 101:3 we must not make a tradition out
[18:55] of brother brenham's life brother bham
[18:57] taught us this in the world is falling
[18:59] apart 1963 brother Bram said and then
[19:01] about another generation you wake up and
[19:03] realize that that was a prophet and then
[19:05] what do you do you garnish the tomb what
[19:07] do you do make a tradition of his life
[19:09] that's exactly what Israel had done had
[19:11] taken the prophet Moses and made a
[19:12] tradition of his life next in the sixth
[19:15] section let's look at how Holy Ghost
[19:17] filled Christians can only allow Deeds
[19:19] of course this is my opinion as far as I
[19:22] understand by the word of God so just
[19:23] briefly reviewing the four-step process
[19:26] starts with deeds and then doctrines and
[19:28] doctrines of balum and then Jezebel
[19:30] religion or the depths of Satan so I
[19:33] believe a holy ghost filled Christian
[19:34] can only go into sin to the level of
[19:37] Deeds the reason I believe this is
[19:39] because of Galatians CH 2:
[19:43] 11-4 where Peter had separated himself
[19:46] from the Gentiles and Paul came to him
[19:48] and told him he was to be blamed he did
[19:50] it to his face and so this is a
[19:52] segregation that Peter did he segregated
[19:55] himself from other believers and it was
[19:57] a sin and so it doesn't look like Peter
[19:59] made this a Doctrine it was just a deed
[20:02] that he was allowing in Antioch but
[20:04] thankfully the Holy Ghost corrected him
[20:06] and so this is the Bible proof where I
[20:08] believe a holy ghost filled person and
[20:10] remember Peter had the Keys of the
[20:11] Kingdom he was a spokesperson on the day
[20:13] of Pentecost even he allowed this sinful
[20:16] deed of segregation in his church but
[20:19] then the Holy Ghost corrected him so I
[20:21] believe Holy Ghost filled Believers can
[20:24] be deceived or can sin to the first step
[20:27] the Deeds
[20:28] but then the Holy Ghost will correct
[20:30] them another example is polycarp brother
[20:33] the random said in the church age book
[20:34] on page 111 polycarp was not militant
[20:37] against the nicadan system he leaned
[20:40] toward organization and this was a trick
[20:42] of the enemy that tricked polycarp just
[20:45] like we would say Peter was tricked into
[20:47] segregation away from Gentile Believers
[20:51] but of course polycarp had a tremendous
[20:52] testimony as a martyr for Jesus Christ a
[20:55] true man of God taught under St John so
[20:58] here's two examples that make me believe
[20:59] that Holy Ghost filled Saints can only
[21:01] backslide or have a complex into the
[21:03] first step of this four-step process of
[21:06] death they would only go the first step
[21:09] of Deeds of the nicians but then the
[21:11] Holy Ghost would correct
[21:13] them moving on to the seventh section in
[21:16] this section we'll look at the 1951
[21:17] Rapture prophecy brother Ram gave about
[21:20] God breaking down denominational bearers
[21:22] before the Rapture so I'm going to play
[21:24] this quote from the works that I do bear
[21:26] witness of me from 1950 1 April 13th in
[21:30] the quote you'll hear brother brandom
[21:31] say someday these denominational
[21:33] barriers will be taken away God will
[21:35] bring his church together and take it
[21:37] home he says I spoke that in the name of
[21:40] the Lord remember that you can put that
[21:42] down in the book that was true I've
[21:44] known about this quote for years I made
[21:45] a video about it about 10 years ago
[21:48] future Prophecies of William brandom
[21:49] thus sayith the Lord but what stuck out
[21:51] to me is as I studi this topic of deeds
[21:54] and nickens brother brandom says
[21:56] denominational barriers God has has to
[21:58] break down and then I thought about St
[22:00] Peter and his denominational Bearer he
[22:02] wouldn't eat with the Gentiles and
[22:04] polycarp's denominational barrier and
[22:07] how God will break all these down or God
[22:09] allowed them because we're all Sinners
[22:11] saved by grace we're all doing our best
[22:13] to overcome the enemy but we got to be
[22:15] tested and tried to perfect our faith
[22:18] and so this quote just stuck out to me
[22:21] and it shows God's faithfulness that no
[22:23] matter what we might struggle with no
[22:25] matter what trials we might have or even
[22:27] Deeds might allow God is faithful to
[22:29] cleanse us of all our iniquity he's
[22:32] faithful as the quote shows to smooth
[22:35] every stone that will go into Solomon's
[22:37] Temple which brother R uses as a type of
[22:39] the Rapture God will cut away our Deeds
[22:42] God will cut away our human leadership
[22:44] and he'll bring us together in perfect
[22:46] Christian character for the Rapture
[22:48] let's listen to the
[22:50] quote look when Solomon built the temple
[22:53] it was cut out from all over the world
[22:56] but when they come together there was
[22:58] the buzz of a song or the sound of a
[23:00] hammer every block no matter this might
[23:02] have been cut like one this and this and
[23:04] two this and this and three this and
[23:06] this and Fess or whatever it was but
[23:08] when they come together they went D tail
[23:11] one with the other that's right and it
[23:13] wasn't any Argan there wasn't any
[23:15] buzzing there wasn't any fussing they
[23:16] just went together and made the temple
[23:18] of God that's right and I believe that
[23:21] God is cutting out everywhere Born Again
[23:24] children of God and go to bring them
[23:27] together I may not to see it but I hope
[23:28] I do but someday you're going to have
[23:32] you remember these young people sitting
[23:33] here someday those denominational
[23:36] barriers and ideas that Fanatics has got
[23:40] out there and scooped around and
[23:41] separated the people will be taken away
[23:43] and God will bring his church together
[23:45] and take it home just as certain as
[23:47] anything in the world it was going to
[23:49] come that's prophecy remember that I
[23:53] spoke that in the name of the
[23:56] Lord now you can put that down upon the
[23:59] book now that was true I didn't know I
[24:02] saying going to say that now that's
[24:05] right that's how God will bring his
[24:07] church together you can depend on that
[24:09] and as long as you Argy and fusser one
[24:12] another you're in the kindergarten God
[24:14] will just keep you there till you learn
[24:16] enough to get out of it but
[24:18] oh amen well praise the Lord all right
[24:23] try get out have Fai step on the word of
[24:28] God Jesus said the disciples come said
[24:31] we've seen one cast out devils and we
[24:33] forbid him there start your denomination
[24:35] again said forbid him
[24:37] not amen be one with him that's all go
[24:40] John up they won't Jo up don't forbid
[24:43] him
[24:44] G that's the way to
[24:48] do moving on to the eighth and final
[24:50] section how to overcome the Deeds of the
[24:53] nicians the Bible gives us simple
[24:55] instructions on how to overcome the
[24:57] Deeds of G adans I would start with
[25:00] Matthew 6:33 seek ye first the kingdom
[25:02] of God and his righteousness and all
[25:04] these things will be added unto you I
[25:06] think as a holy ghost filled Christian
[25:07] is seeking the kingdom of God God will
[25:09] reveal to him his sins his faults his
[25:13] failures and God will add the anointing
[25:16] of the Holy Ghost that we need but
[25:17] notice this is an everyday thing we must
[25:19] seek the kingdom of God every day and
[25:22] this seeking is also talked about in
[25:23] Hebrews 51
[25:25] 12-14 Paul's talking about mature
[25:27] Christian he say strong meat belongs to
[25:29] them that are of a full age that means
[25:31] mature and they have exercised their
[25:34] senses to discern both good and evil so
[25:37] as we seek the kingdom of God daily God
[25:40] gives us discernment or the spirit of
[25:42] judgment the Holy Ghost anointing of
[25:44] judgment and discernment to identify
[25:46] good and evil in our daily lives every
[25:48] day as we seek the good and not the evil
[25:51] so we discern or judge every action in
[25:54] our lives every day and this is based
[25:56] upon the love of God because the love of
[25:58] God keeps Jesus's commands as Jesus told
[26:01] us three times in John chapter 14
[26:04] another way to say this is we must prove
[26:06] All Things by the Bible as 1
[26:07] Thessalonians 5 tells us our doctrines
[26:10] must be biblical and if all of our
[26:12] doctrines are biblical then that proves
[26:14] we are born again 2 John 1: 9-10 tells
[26:18] us that plainly if we abide in the true
[26:20] doctrine of Christ we have both the
[26:22] father and the son the invisible Spirit
[26:25] and the image of the visible God Jesus
[26:27] Christ our high priest and also all of
[26:30] our Traditions or Christian Liberties
[26:31] must be true Christian Liberties and not
[26:34] sins there are some actions that
[26:36] Christians do that are just Liberties
[26:38] and they're not sins these Liberties
[26:40] don't make us any more holy or any less
[26:42] holy and Paul talks about this in a
[26:45] couple places 2 Thessalonians
[26:48] 2:15 he talks about our doctrines the
[26:51] Commandments that we've heard from the
[26:52] word but also our traditions and Paul
[26:55] also talked about it in Colossians 2: 16
[26:57] and 17 any holy days any holidays any
[27:01] Traditions that we hold he says don't
[27:03] let any man judge you over those because
[27:05] they're all Shadows of the main thing
[27:08] Christ so we overcome the Deeds of the
[27:10] nicians we overcome by the anointing the
[27:13] Holy Ghost today which is his flying
[27:15] eagle anointing this is the same
[27:17] anointing that will help us discern good
[27:19] and evil the same anointing that helps
[27:21] us prove all things the same anointing
[27:23] that gives us the true doctrines and
[27:26] acceptable tradition
[27:28] within Christian Liberties and as we
[27:30] pray to our Lord Jesus Christ he will
[27:33] guide us into all truth as John 16-13
[27:36] tells us the constant communion and
[27:38] prayer with the Lord Jesus Christ will
[27:40] keep us clean as Jesus said in John 153
[27:44] now you are clean through the word which
[27:45] I have spoken unto
[27:47] you in
[27:49] closing friends I hope this video has
[27:51] been a blessing this is my first time
[27:53] really preaching on the deeds and
[27:55] doctrines of the nicadan I hope this was
[27:57] a help by the the grace of God and
[27:59] humbly I'll just say I haven't preached
[28:00] in depth on this topic This was meant to
[28:02] be an introduction to the deeds and
[28:04] doctrines of the nians we'll see where
[28:06] the Lord leads me after this but I just
[28:08] want to get this video out since I
[28:09] preached on it last night would have
[28:12] been November 22nd
[28:14] 2023 so the main thing to do is be
[28:16] humble be under the anointing of the
[28:17] Holy Ghost as 2 Corinthians 13:5 says
[28:20] examine yourselves whether you be in the
[28:22] faith prove your own selves know not
[28:26] your own selves how that Jesus Christ is
[28:27] in you except you be reprobates so each
[28:30] day we must seek the kingdom of God
[28:32] first we must be open to correction we
[28:34] must have the anointing of the Flying
[28:36] Eagle the Holy Ghost anointing for today
[28:39] and see ourselves as a tree that's
[28:40] planted by rivers of Living Water we
[28:42] must have salvation the life the
[28:44] doctrine the bark the leaves the
[28:46] fellowship and all the fruits of the
[28:48] Holy Spirit just as the bible promises
[28:50] that in Psalm 1 and Galatians CH
[28:54] 5 Psalm 1: 1-3 speaks of this this we
[28:58] Delight in the word of the lord we
[28:59] meditate in it day and night we're like
[29:02] that tree that brings forth the fruit in
[29:04] due season our leaves do not wither see
[29:07] the caterpillar cannot eat our
[29:08] fellowship whatever we do it prospers by
[29:12] the grace of Christ and Galatians 5:22
[29:15] tells us the fruit of the spirit that's
[29:16] produced in our life love joy peace
[29:18] longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith
[29:21] meanness Temperance against such there
[29:23] is no law and Galatians 5:24 says they
[29:26] that are Christ have crucified the flesh
[29:28] with the affections and lusts so he
[29:30] crucified the Deeds of nians and they
[29:33] never Advanced to the doctrine or the
[29:35] doctrine of balum or The Jezebel
[29:37] religion as Titus 21 and 12 tell us the
[29:40] grace of God teaches us to deny
[29:42] ungodliness and worldly lusts as we live
[29:45] soberly righteous and godly in this
[29:46] present world looking for that blessed
[29:49] hope the Glorious appearing of the great
[29:51] God and our Savior Jesus Christ if you
[29:54] have any questions concerns or
[29:55] testimonies about this video please
[29:57] contact prot
[29:58] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[30:02] the desire of your
[30:05] heart
