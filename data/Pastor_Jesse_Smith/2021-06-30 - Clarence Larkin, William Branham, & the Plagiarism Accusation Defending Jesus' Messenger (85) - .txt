Description:
God's genuine prophet, William Branham, has been accused of plagiarizing Clarence Larkin's work in four sets of sermon series. But an honest review of Branham's work shows he is not guilty of plagiarism, by the following facts:
- In The Seven Church Ages, Brother Branham cited historians on over 20 occasions, directly citing Larkin's work as "history" on at least 3 occasions.
- In Daniel's 70 Weeks, Brother Branham cited and thanked Larkin by name, along with other historians.
- In The Seven Seals, Brother Branham cited numerous historians, and despite not referring to Larkin by name until 14 months after, Brother Branham's revelations were incredibly different than Larkin's, as they only agreed on the 6th Seal. 
- In The Future Home sermon, Brother Branham did not cite anyone, seemingly forgetting to cite, and while it's clear he used some of Larkin's work, it's unfair to accuse him of purposely plagiarizing because it was his regular practice to cite other's work.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ god's prophet william branham has been accused of plagiarizing clarence larkin in reference to the seven church ages daniel's 70 weeks and the seven seals it's an absolute false accusation friends it's not true when you understand two things first the definition of plagiarism and second brother branham repeatedly referred to larkin's work he was using as history and on three occasions cited larkin by name in reference to the future home brother branham did not cite anyone as far as i can find so it's a different situation than the seven church ages daniel 70 weeks and the seven seals which i'll discuss in this video it's likely he forgot to cite anyone but either way we should not jump to conclusions immediately condemning brother branham as a plagiarist as brother branham's accusers often do to their own shame since this is my longest video to date here's a summary of the three sermons series and one sermon in which brother branham has been accused of plagiarizing clarence larkin in the seven church ages series brother branham cited historians over 20 times and although he never mentioned larkin's name he cited larkin's work at least three times specifically calling it history so this clears him of plagiarism in the daniels 70 weeks series brother branham cited larkin by name and other historians so this clears him of plagiarism in the seven seals series brother branham cited numerous historians and although he didn't cite larkin by name in the series he did cite larkin a year later for his ideas on the seven seals additionally brother branham's revelations of the seven seals were very different from larkins as they only agreed on the sixth seal and brother branham taught the seven seals began in the church ages while larkin believed they began in the great tribulation period which was a 2 000 year difference in the future home sermon brother branham apparently forgot to cite anyone but he never claimed larkin's work he used was revealed to him only brother branham's main emphasis on revelation from god was the three works of grace which larkin did not teach on this plagiarism accusation friends let me just say humbly and with a heavy heart brother branham's accusers must not deeply and sincerely study brother branham's sermons it seems they're just skimming his sermons in order to find fault with him also the accusers label message believers of having cognitive dissonance and some do such as the tape church movement and the return ministry people but if the proof in this video of brother branham citing his sources doesn't make them change their minds then they are the ones with cognitive dissonance the accusers will double down on their belief that brother branham was a plagiarist which he wasn't and that he pretended to speak in tongues which he didn't and so many more examples here's the specific false accusation against brother branham and you can easily see why it's wrong william branham's accusers say quote if william branham had simply said i read this information in clarence larkin's book then he would not have been guilty of plagiarism but he didn't instead he said that he received it by divine revelation he said that god gave it to him which was a lie he got the information directly from clarence larkin and others end quote i have two comments about this false accusation first brother branham did say in effect i read this information from larkin on multiple occasions and on other occasions he seemed to forget to say larkin's name but still said i read this information from history meaning it was from larkin so according to the standards of brother branham's accusers he is not guilty of plagiarism second brother branham never ever said he got larkin's work by divine revelation his accusers have completely misunderstood brother branham's quotes taking them out of context now let's define plagiarism webster's online dictionary defines plagiarism in the two following ways first to steal and pass off the ideas or words of another as one's own use another's production without crediting the source as you'll soon see brother branham never passed off larkin's ideas as his own also brother branham credited numerous books and historians both before he preached these series during and after of course brother branham didn't give credit to his sources as often as a scholar because he wasn't a scholar he only had a seventh grade education and it appears he did the best to his ability the second definition says to commit literary theft present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source again i've never found brother branham presenting larkin's teachings as original or new that's just not true his accusers are jumping to conclusions and misunderstanding brother branham in humility i want to challenge anyone to show me where brother branham specifically and purposely committed plagiarism he may have forgot to cite his source but forgetting is not the same as purposely stealing someone's work as always i'm open to being corrected if i'm wrong about my claims here's a summary of brother branham's citations for the seven church ages brother branham cited numerous historians some by name both before during and after his 10 sermons in this series over 20 quotes have revealed he was reading other authors and historians he just didn't always cite them he was completely transparent saying he was gathering all the history books he could possibly get his hands on and also invited his congregation to bring all their history books as well brother branham never mentioned larkin's name during this series but he did specifically cite his work as history on a couple of occasions while preaching the seven church ages this proves the plagiarism accusation is false since he did not claim larkin's work was given from divine revelation before preaching the main content of this series at the very beginning of it in the first sermon of the series called the revelation of jesus christ brother branham made at least 10 references to historians saying the following one he had taken natural history from the most outstanding historians he knew of two he had five or six commentaries in his study room including hislop's two babylons fox's book of martyrs pre-nicean council about four books on that and the nicean council and all the history that we can find three he was going to give the historical of the original church and the writers and the historians and the angels of that age and the messages and the run of the church as it's come down through to this time four he was amazed to see how every prediction of the scripture hit solid with history just exactly five he said he had so many history books that he could not have brought all the books so he just wrote down each time upon paper little notes from history and commentaries that he might be able to just read from the notes instead of having the book and turning through the pages six he said his plan was to cite the historians in the church age book saying and then in the commentary i'll explain or the history who the historian was that said it and so forth seventh he said he was amazed as he studied history he said it was such a marvelous thing as he had been studying the histories eighth he said he was amazed to see how the bible predictions coincided with history saying it's amazing to see how every prediction of that scripture hit solid with history ninth he said he was going to take history and the bible and prove the truth saying he would take the history and everything and show you that it's exactly that way let you take the history yourself and read it and see what the bible said and then what the history said see how it meets just exactly like that intent he said his intention was to break down the book of revelation according to histories which is a citation and said he took it from commentaries he said each time his congregation would see him referring to pages from history that he had written there he said stuff that he had taken from commentaries and so forth let's listen to brother branham's quotes the natural history which is of the taken from the most outstanding historians that i know of i have laying in my study room right now about five or six commentaries officers two babbling stocks book of the martyrs other great books like the green i've seen council uh four books on that around 400 pages in each book and they're the nice seeing council and all the history that we can because behind this from the magnetic tape we're going to write a commentary on the seven church ages to send to all the world that we can because we are in the last days we are at the end times philadelphia and sunday morning and sunday night the lady ocean a church age that we're living in giving the historical of the original church and the and the writers and the historians and the angels of that age and and the messages and the run of the church as it's come down to you to this time and it's amazing to see how every prediction of that scripture is solid with history i invite you to bring your bible every meeting and bring a pencil and paper and now with all the commentaries and so forth i could not have brought all the books so i just wrote write down each time uh on paper your little notes from history and commentaries and so forth that i might be able to just read it from the notes here instead of having the book and turning to the pages however when it comes to the scripture we'll use the bible and then in the commentary i'll explain or the history who the historian was and said it and so forth then in the course in the uh event of the coming book well then we can type it up all right then you can get everything did all right and it's such a marvelous thing as i've been studying the history to find how that church began and how i pulled off and what's taking place and to see that little seed of god move to every one of those ages completely go out nearly in one place we'll draw it out on the map take the history and everything and show you that it's exactly that way let you take the history yourself and read it see what the bible says and what the history says see it meets just exactly like that oh may we all not just take this as a lecture as i've said before now in this we're going to try to give a little breakdown now of the book according to the histories and so forth and each time when you see me referring to pages that i have written here it's stuff that i have taken from commentaries and so forth friends these ten references to historians and history books are enough to prove brother branham was not plagiarizing i believe it's proof brother branham is innocent of this accusation are brother branham's accusers unaware of these 10 beforehand references if so that means they have not studied very deeply or they are purposely ignoring them in order to deceive people into leaving god's message only god knows the intentions of these accusers during the church ages brother branham referenced historians in general and some by name and yes he used lots of larkin's work such as all seven of larkin's descriptions of jesus's sevenfold glory of his person in the patmos vision you'll soon see brother branham considered larkin a historian and cited him as such now let's look in the ephesian church age sermon and see how brother branham told us where he got his dates from historians so while brother branham did not say larkin's name he cited where he got his dates from historians this proves brother branham did not plagiarize larkin but cited him indirectly brother branham never said the lord gave me the dates and i never read them from a book let's listen to the quotes remember as i said before sometimes all these things we might disagree upon them as far as as the theology is concerned and most of my dates i take from the authentic uh historians which really not interested in any side they just wrote down facts whatever it was what the churches did and of course the divine part of the interpretation i tried to place it up on there myself the best that i know how god [Laughter] history and now we're coming down all so patterned to the time there's not no three gods and three gods is pagan and heathen and it was brought over and if you just in facts what happened it is also noteworthy during the ephesian church age sermon that brother branham said he received the revelation of who the angel messengers were from the holy spirit that is true as larkin did not identify the names of the angel messengers larkin did believe the angel messengers were humans though brother branham knew the messengers by revelation not by history larkin never taught specific names of the angel messengers here larkin did teach the angels were human in his book of revelation from 1919. he said and i quote in his right hand seven stars we are told in verse 20 that the seven stars stand for the angels of the seven churches these angels are not angelic beings but the messengers or ministers of the churches so larkin never identified who the seven angel messengers were he never mentioned saint martin nor saint columba in his book and there is no mention of elijah to laodicea that i have got here and know by revelation that they was the angels to the church they had the same ministry that these did at the beginning and that ministry cannot change it must save pentecost all the way through additionally in the ephesian church age sermon brother branham encourages congregation to bring history to the services this is not the behavior of a plagiarist let's listen to the quote [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] try to give god praise for choosing before the foundation of the world how did saint mark and all of those giving them praise god praised that they called and people speaking of him said he was chosen before the foundation of the world that's treacherous those brothers have lined up with god next in the summer in church age sermon brother branham directly quotes from a church history book how did it happen by rachel hasseltine and said it was going to be taken off and used in his church age book then you hear brother branham reading a reminder he made himself to read out of history let's listen to these quotes another thing that i'd like to read you it's found in the book um how did it happen and this is by the historians and um how did it happen but r.c hazelton the history of the early churches and here on page 180 the spiritual gifts in irena's town a.d 177 to 202 uh reason i'm quoting this it's going on tape you see and it'll be taken off on books that's people who don't not interested in either side they're just telling the truth it's historian arrhenius yes i had to know your own iranians about to read this history that the reason irenaeus was chosen is because that he had the signs of the pentecostal original church following him back to larkin while it's true brother branham never said larkin's name while preaching the seven church ages sermons he directly referenced his work as coming from history three times in the sermon the pergamian church age brother random quoted larkin's work on atlas and referenced it from history so brother branham cited larkin indirectly and said he got larkin's information and dates from history brother branham was not a plagiarist let's listen to the quote and i'll put larkin's quote side by side with brother branhams and as i approach this scripture tonight father oh i'm insufficient god there's none of us sufficient we admit we know nothing father but we're solemnly depending on the holy spirit and he might reveal to us as we unfold through our our mental knowledge that you gave us the history may the holy spirit give the spiritual application to our hearts granted father for we wait on thee in the name of jesus thy son amen now in the early years or just before this taken place a few years satan's seat there the great um uh i guess you would call him a pre-king priest of the chaldeans the hierarchy of babylon changed his seat when the persians was pursuing him and he left babylon his name was a-t-t-a-l-u-s actilist the great king priest of babylon when the persians came in and taking over babylon running out the chaldeans atlas the king priest fled and took his seat at pergas the satan's seat is where you are dwelling good now that's why i go back to pick up this history out of the uh church history finding word until i've taken place where he said you are dwelling where satan's seed is our brother i'm quoting history i have thousands of catholic friends and they're just as much friends as protestants are i'm not quoting that from my mind that's the history give you a page and number of a sacred history it seems like george washington and abraham lincoln and the battle of gettysburg and so forth sure all those things are history i'm quoting here in this quote friends listen here he wanted to have the references in his study to back up his claims this shows he was just ignorant about scholarly citations which makes sense because he only had a seventh grade education i come from a catholic background see i got their facts of our faith in their books and your protestants and the baptists and whatever you believe they're in my study so i studied so if anybody says anything whoop i can back you right up to your own thing so the hours come for this to go out in the third tier in church age brother branham cited larkin again in regards to the meaning of the name and also history about jezebel shortly after quoting from larkin brother branham said he was gleaning out of the pages of history and digging into history for all he could find again these are not the words of a plagiarist let's listen to the quotes and compare them with larkin's work now this great saint here was he was a great man of god i've got his history finally written down here first the fourth church age thotara it means to be relaxed loose or hazy is this a illegitimate time from 606 to 1500 all right this jezebel now she was a daughter of abraham that's true a princess of an idolater at that time when the royal family her royal family was famed by cruel savage loyalty to balaam her father was a priest of the idol of a-s-t-a-r-t-e i don't know how to pronounce it i just picked it up in the history ahab used this strategy like constantine this great powerful nation right next to israel so therefore here brother branham said he was gleaning out of pages of history or larkin after nearly quoting larkin's work this proves he was citing his work as i said last night that's the only thing he ever done is sounded anything like he was for the church as far as i could ever clean out any pages of history and many other scholars say the same thing we know nothing about his conversion here brother branham says he was digging into history books for all he could find everywhere but the true genuine light is a pentecostal flame of experience and stayed alive from pentecost down to this time friends even after preaching the seven church ages brother branham cited two more history books one from edmund broadbent who lived from 1861 to 1945 and the other from rachel hazeltine which i mentioned earlier how did it happen and her book was published in 1958. notice brother branham read the history work from a woman here's the quotes studying in the early history of the church broadbands and hazelton's and many of their comments on it i seen fathers and i want somebody to show me where saint patrick was ever a roman catholic there is no such thing he protested that roman church he was the nephew of saint martin i was reading here in a woman that wrote a hazelton mrs hazel and others of the icing council said that she went to the card at the oxford to get the the card for the um the life of saint uh martin and this fellow said but he wasn't canonized by the roman church certainly not he protested the thing he started st patrick the man who stayed with the word of god built their own schools as we move on from the seven church ages any sincere heart would admit brother branham never ever claimed every single word thought or interpretation from this series was original over 20 quotes have revealed he was reading other authors and historians he just didn't always cite them do you think brother branham deserves the derogatory label of plagiarist after citing history over 20 times in this sermon series daniel's 70 weeks citations in his three sermons related to daniel 70 weeks gabriel's instructions to daniel on july 30th the am service the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel on july 30th the pm service and the 70th week of daniel on august 8th brother branham mentioned larkin by name twice even saying he was very grateful to dr larkin for his work in the daniel 70 week sermon which was the third and final sermon in this series for a second time this proves brother branham was not guilty of plagiarism on the morning of july 30th 1961 brother branham preached gabriel's instructions to daniel in this sermon brother branham told everyone he'd been studying larkin's work on this subject but couldn't understand it yet here's the quote and then i have been reading dr larkin's book dr smith's book dr scofield's notes different commentaries from man everywhere and yet i cannot put theirs together to make it come out right see so this week i'm planning on been visiting the library in kentucky on some of the ancient astronomy of the calendars and times and pick it up from the libraries and so forth all the ancient books that i can and what little i can do and having my trust solemnly in jesus christ you reveal it to me because i do not want it to say i know this and i know that he knows my heart is listening but i want it that i might enlighten his people therefore i believe that he will give it to me i do not know as yet but i'm trusting him for next sunday because that'll be the tremendous part the next sunday to know and place those 70 weeks that evening brother branham preached the second sermon the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel a week later brother branham preached the meaning of daniel's 70 weeks which agreed with larkin's understanding in many aspects brother branham expressed gratitude to larkin specifically for his work again clearing brother branham from any charges of plagiarism let's listen and so no doubt that down through the age there has been hundreds times hundreds of people scholars abled men trying to explain what these 70 weeks were now i've read many of their commentaries on and uh i'm very grateful to mr smith of the adventist church for his views i'm very grateful to dr larkin of his views i'm grateful to all these great scholars for their views on this and in reading them it enlightens me much that i can find places that looks right but to get the views that i i thought that i would like to explain i searched through the encyclopedia of time to find out what time meant before moving on i must again show how brother branham's accusers have very little understanding of brother branham's ministry either on purpose or because of ignorance brother branham's accusers say he claimed he disagreed with larkin on daniel's 70 weeks but proceeded to plagiarize his work here's the false accusation and it proves their misunderstanding and i quote william branham told his audience in his sermon on the 70 weeks of daniel that he didn't know it yet but was going to preach on it that morning that he'd studied larkin's work but didn't agree with them and that what they were going to hear was going to come from a revelation that william branham was trusting god to give him this is how william branham lifted himself up to become the messenger of god of our age end quote this statement is not true the truth is brother branham's accusers simply fail to look at the dates of the three sermons on this subject brother branham said he didn't know yet about daniel 70 weeks but that was a week before he preached it so obviously in the week leading up to preaching daniel 70 weeks through prayer to god and study of larkin's teachings brother branham came to understand larkin's teachings and agreed with and taught some of them then on the day he preached daniel 70 weeks he said he was grateful to larkin so a week before he preached daniel 70 weeks he didn't understand it but a week later on august 6th he said the following i'm very grateful to dr lark of his views so the understanding came to him during that week of study but brother branham's accusers failed to understand the context of brother branham's statements again either on purpose to deceive people into leaving god's message or because of their weak research for the seven seals sermon series brother branham cited numerous historians before during and after the ten sermons in this series he used some of larkin's ideas which he admitted but the main revelations of the seven seals were extremely different from larkin as larkin taught the seals opened sequentially once the tribulation started but anyone who's honestly studied brother branham's teachings on the seven seals knows that he taught the seals open sequentially once the church ages started which was a 2 000 year difference from clarence larkin brother branham never cited larkin by name during this sermon series yet he cited other authors but a year later he cited larkin regarding the seven seals in the sermon the feast of the trumpets in 1964. now let's hear brother branham cite larkin a year and four months after preaching the seven seals let's listen to the quote then just leaving it at that and pursuing after a while we preach on the seals not knowing what the seals was i had my own idea as every minister does of reading maybe what other man had said and believing as much as i possible with them on the things that they had brought up their conclusion uh i'd read the book of mr smith your eyes smith which is the adventist a teacher and i read his uh his thoughts on it and i read uh mr larkin i'd read all so many different ones of their commentaries on this but uh somehow or other i thought i had a little view of it myself that might be if a place is different but trying one time just speaking three subjects the first or the four subjects of the four horse riders i preached on it four nights one on one horse and the other but then just before it happened i was given a vision which is on tape as you all know sirs what time is it again just like in the seven church age series before brother branham preached one seal in the seven seals series he cited many great outstanding teachers let's listen to the quote i would have absolutely today and i hope that people are spiritual i would have had a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock the day when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that i was writing down to faith i was taken from an old context i had nothing on it i don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing but i've got some old context of something i spoke on several years ago and wrote it down and i gathered this context context from dr smith many great outstanding teachers that uh i gathered and all of them believed that so i wrote it down and i was fixing to say well i'll study from that standpoint and there about 12 o'clock in the date the holy spirit just swept back down into the room and the whole thing is opened up to me there [Applause] this of this first seal being opened i'm as positive as i'm standing here tonight that this is the gospel truth [Applause] because if a revelation is contrary to the word that it isn't revelation and you know this some of the stuff can look so absolutely true and yet isn't true it looks like it is but it isn't also at the end of the seven seals series brother branham told us how he'd studied during that entire week he'd first read the books larkin uriah smith and the others and then wait for the vision from the lord let's listen as brother branham says every day he was picking up the notes and books of all the writers and then waiting for the true interpretation from the holy ghost this has been a tremendous week for me i'm tired my mind is tired because i i have with the best that i could do and something strange going on every day i would be amazed to walk in the room and be there for a few minutes and see something's turning completely around and here i go in there i pick up the notes i pick up books of dr smith you're a smith and all all the writers and read and read down in their books i say now here's the sixth seal here's the fourth seal now what does this man say he'd say what was this there that i look over here and get another man he said it was such-and-such and it looked like it just it just didn't work ryan and i thought well what is it lord i walk up down the floor a while i kneel down pray go back pick up the bible sit down read walk back and forth then all of a sudden when i got white here just unfolded like that then i grab a pen right quick no writing it down like that whatever i was seeing and doing watch it like after god blew down then i'd take the rest of the day and go down and chase this out and see if it tied all the way down through the scriptures then it proved all things right i got this year and i think now as many people had visions there's many been revelations if it's contrary to the word leave it alone try it leave it alone now now that i run this down like this right next to that jot down a little picture i thought well the class will be glad you hear this cause entire sharing hi sharon let's see what does it say here yes yeah here it is right here then bring it back to the bible and tie the thing down to the week there it is on tapes you're welcome to them and i have did it to the best of my knowledge under christian fellowship grace of god to all man by jesus christ i've done the very best that i know how looking at the seven seals it seems brother branham studied for the seven seals in similar fashion as the seven church ages as proven by the quote from the seventh seal now let's compare larkin and branham's interpretations of the seven seals you will see a vast difference a difference of over two thousand years for the first seal there are some similarities between the two as larkin taught the white horse rider was the person of the antichrist but larkin said the white horse rider was the antichrist who would rise during the tribulation period during daniel's last and 70th week brother branham taught much differently saying the white horse rider was the spirit of the antichrist not the person of the antichrist who rode at the beginning of the first church age this is a two thousand year difference larkin said its future branham said its past so brother branham did not plagiarize larkin larkin said and i quote in other words this white horse rider is the antichrist he is the prince who is to come of daniel's vision of the 70 weeks and who will confirm the covenant for one week the last or 70th week with daniel's people the jews daniel 9 27 end quote larkin goes on to say the rise of this white horse rider necessarily and to dates the beginning of the 70th week or the seven years of his reign for he must have reached a position of power to make a covenant with the jews at the beginning of the week but he does not become the beast as described in chapter 13 verses 1 through 8 until the middle of the week that is until after satan is cast out of the heavenlies and incarnates himself in him end quote larkin said the rapture will take place before the white horse rider rides in the tribulation quote his rise to power and the rebuilding of babylon will take time so the rapture of the church will doubtless and to date the beginning of the week by some years end quote and the source is the book of revelation by clarence larkin 1919 brother branham said the white horse rider was the spirit of antichrist that rode at the beginning of the church ages here's the quote here he is he's the antichrist he started riding the first church age now he rides on down on down through every age also brother branham taught the tribulation was connected to daniel's 70th week in the future after the rapture of the church here's the quote now in the last part the 70th week the last part of it will be during the time of the tribulation period at the rapture of the church and here's the three and a half years here that it will be confirmed to them again by prophets the moses and elijah revelations 11. looking at the second seal again there are some similarities between the two but their timing is completely different larkin said the red horse rider is the antichrist during the tribulation while brother branham said the red horse rider was the catholic church gaining power of church and state in order to kill anyone who disagreed with her through my research of history it seems this persecution of the united roman church state began around 385 a.d when priscillian a holy ghost-filled bishop of spain and six others were said to be the first saints executed by the false church in 385 a.d and i got this from hasseltine pages 260 to 265 and broadbent page 37. so larkin said the second seal's future brother branham said it's past larkin said and i quote this seems to imply that the antichrist will not have everything his own way and that his autocratic methods will lead to insubordination and civil wars among the nations under some great leader represented by the writer of the red horse whose great sword is symbolical of the awful destruction of human life that will follow this is a fulfillment of first thessalonians 5 3 when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape we learn from this seal that wars are likely to break out at any time and that there will be no peace on earth until the return of the prince of peace end quote in this quote brother branham says the red horse rider rides during the church ages which was again a 2000 year difference from larkin notice the change of color of these horses same rider change of color of horses and a horse is a beast and the beast in the bible and her symbol represents a power the same system right on another color tower from the innocent white to a bloody red the council was held and they elected a head bishop and then by doing this they united church and stayed together then he dropped his bowl he got off his white horse he got on his red horse or he can kill anybody that don't agree with him the third seal there's not many similarities between the two on this subject larkin seems to place this seal in the tribulation at the time of a war that causes all the farmers to leave their crops causing a famine yet the world would depend on olive trees and grapevines for medicinal purposes brother branham taught the black horse rider represented the roman catholic church during the dark ages which began around 1095 a.d again over 1 000 years before larkin's guests brother branham said rome was capturing the wealth of the world stripping her subjects of all their wealth this included the sale of indulgences which began around 1320 a.d rome grew rich by controlling religion economics and agriculture brother braham said the oil and wine was the baptism of the holy ghost and the stimulation that comes with it larkin said it was literal wine and oil brother bram did not plagiarize larkin on this third seal larkin said its future and natural oil and wine brother branham said its past and spiritual oil and wine larkin said and i quote when all able-bodied men are drafted for war and no one left to sow and harvest the crops then famine is sure to follow so great will be the famine that it will take uh daenerys a day's wages to buy a choenix two pints of wheat the daily ration of a slave what is meant by not hurting the oil and wine may be that as the olive tree and grapevine do not bear their fruit until some months after the wheat and barley harvest and grow without attention their crops would not be so much affected by war and therefore the olive trees and grapevines were not to be ruthlessly destroyed by invaders for they were needed for medicinal purposes end quote here brother branham says the third seal took place during the church ages he started riding him in the time of the dark ages that's what the dark horse represented the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the true believers that for the fourth seal larkin said this is a pestilence that follows the war of the third seal again during the tribulation or the 70th week of daniel brother branham taught the antichrist or spirit of death is on his last horse now because of the political power of the roman catholic church but he also said this pale horse will ride through the tribulation and then gather his evil subjects for the final fight between life and death which takes place at armageddon larkin said and i quote the reference here is clearly to some great pestilence that shall come upon the earth after a devastating war followed by famine during which the dead are left unburied a pestilence is sure to follow the fourth part of the earth over which the pestilence shall sweep will probably be that part of the eastern hemisphere covered by the revived roman empire end quote here's where brother ram says the pale horse rider is on his last ride now and continues down through the tribulation as he appears on his right this last ride he's on his last now now on this mix colored whirly pale sick horse just think of it you know that's a bad thing now watch where he gathers them from the four corners of the earth they're gathering now for the showdown the showdown will be at armageddon according to the word i think on the pale horse riding on it with a death tatter with the name tactile name death for the fifth seal both larkin and brother branham agree that these are jews but larkin taught that these souls are saved after the rapture brother branham taught they were jews saved from the time of israel's blindness at jesus crucifixion 2000 years ago to the present day so all the blinded jews from the days of jesus to the present day larkin said and i quote but they were not the martyrs of the christian church for they had been resurrected and taken up with the church these martyrs are those who will be killed for the word of god and their testimony after the church is caught out end quote here's branham saying the souls under the altar are blinded jews from the time of christ to the present i notice this now these souls under the altar uh uh the this these um souls understanding now it's under the altar why they were martyred by sinful man like eichmann a jew and hitler but they stayed true to what they believed and they killed them because they were jews now if they had been blinded god said let alone they're not worthy but then if they was blinded by god his grace reached down to him [Applause] one of amen a room because all israel will be saved everyone has his name written that's right jesus give them robes like joseph did to his brethren a tithe notice now though they had tried to get rid of joseph is grace reached to him though they tried to get rid of jesus he still comes that background because he's dying to get beat on a white robe the sixth seal here's the first time larkin and branham agree about both the timing and the details of the seal in the sixth seal branham used similar terminology to larkin but it wasn't plagiarism as branham cited both historians and larkin by name larkin said and i quote these physical convulsions will be the earth's travail pains as she labors to bring forth the new creation of this millennial age end quote here's where branham teaches something very the birth similar the world is trying she's travailing isaiah said whatsoever she's in trying to bring forth a new world for the millennium right she's in travail that's the reason that uh the we're in travail bring forth the bride everything is travailing and groaning see there's something fixed to happen this sixth play that's our goal for the seventh seal branham used a lot of larkin's terminology but added something larkin didn't teach the fact that the seventh seal is the literal day and hour of the rapture remember that larkin said the church is taken out or raptured before the first seal brother branham taught the literal opening of the seventh seal is the rapture larkin said and i quote we must not forget the seventh seal includes all that happens during the sounding of the trumpets and the pouring out of the vows and so extends down to the ushering in of the millennium to illustrate a rocket fired into the air may burst into seven stars and one of these stars into seven other stars and one of the second group of stars into a third group of seven stars so the seventh seal includes the seven trumpets and the seventh trumpet includes the seven vowels the silence that filed the breaking of the seventh seal was preparatory to what was to follow during the sounding of the trumpets and the pouring out of the vows this silence was something remarkable the four and twenty elders ceased their heart playing the angels hushed their voices and the cherubim and the seraphim and all the hosts of heaven were silent and so great was the silence that all heaven was awed by it and to add to the noticeableness of it john added that it lasted for half an hour now a half an hour is not long when engaged in some pleasant employment but it causes a nerve breaking tension when we do not know what is going to happen and when a life is at stake a minute or even a few seconds seem to be ours the suspense of the half hour of silence in heaven was intense but why that half hour of silence what did it portend it was the period of silent preparation for the awful judgments that were to burst forth in the earth under the trumpets and vials end quote here's brother branham saying the seventh seal is the day and hour of christ's coming what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see he didn't know it himself amen he said only god would know it amen but he told us when we begin to see these signs coming up because the seventh seal there was silence no one knew there's a minor hour that christ would come as he revealed it to us before leaving the seven seals here's a few more quotes showing brother branham citing his sources again proving brother branham was not a plagiarist in the second seal brother branham cited the book of the pre nicean fathers that was ironious about 400 years after after the death of christ he said when this last age comes in that's in the the uh pre-nicee of counsel you fellowship that read the the study of scripture and study that i mean study the history of the bible uh you find that in priet and the pre-nicee of counsel i think it's the first book or the second book you'll find it here during the third seal he was studying each day as usual meaning he was reading history books and waiting for the holy ghost to show the meaning this is proven by his comments in the seven seal sermon quote we already heard again tonight we've assembled together again for this the uh wednesday night of the week and we're trusting the lord tonight for a great outpouring of his blessings upon his and today i have been studying as usual and trying to think of the things that would be more appropriate to say and then how to say it and then depending on the lord to give to me the interpretation and meaning of this word that's written and i am grateful to him for what he has done for us through the week of the opening of these seals charging i'm taking this around history charging for i guess it's novenia i guess but everybody knows what gopher i guess that's something you have to do you know some penance somebody had to charge for that in questions and answers on the seals brother branham was asked specifically about his source and he gave the source again this proves brother branham was not a plagiarist he cited his sources as often as he would remember what they had first church ages is that right next thing a message to the church ages everybody get that clear down yeah i think first we got the church agents and brought the history laid down the nausea uh councils and pre-nazi councils and everything that we could find in history and found out that the correct interpretation of the word was exactly with the history question concerning the 68 million slain by the roman catholic church what time in history did this take place and over how long a period of time did this take place take smuckers glorious uh reformation i guess some of these scholars have that and it's the history of the church and i forget not just what page is on but it taken place from the time of the the thing was produced or given to the church by saint augustine of hippo africa that was a.d 354 and it lasted till 1850 the massacre of ireland again for the third time this proves the plagiarism accusation is false for those of us who see how brother branham cited history that was correct and also received divine revelation from god we can rejoice in this next quote showing how brother branham tied all the loose ends together pointing to the true interpretation of the book of revelation and gave us thus saith the lord praise the lord jesus i remember in the vision he never told me one thing in the vision when he took me up i was scared praise god to die be killed in an explosion you see they could not do it the interpretation come just as i had need of it that was in the room and i gave it out just as he give it now you see friends visions doesn't fail they're always perfect they're just exactly true now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so i could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of god and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the lord now may the lord bless you all each one real richly for the future home sermon it seems brother branham forgot to cite larkin for the eight or more facts he used from larkin's work in fact i cannot find brother branham citing anyone during this sermon but brother branham never said larkin's work was divine revelation and most importantly his main emphasis in the sermon was the three works of grace which larkin did not teach friends brother branham said justification 16 times in the sermon sanctification 12 times and the holy spirit or holy ghost 39 times this proves the emphasis was not on larkin but on the three stages the earth goes through for redemption like god's three works of grace for believers the correct teaching on the three works of grace was indeed a divine revelation from god to brother branham charles parnum was the first to teach the three works of grace but he taught it incorrectly teaching tongues was the evidence of the third work of grace but the holy ghost showed brother branham tongues are not the evidence of the holy ghost baptism instead the evidence is an emotional supernatural experience from the holy ghost and a holy life that follows bearing the fruits of the spirit and being led into all truth by the holy ghost as you carefully examine brother branham's statements in the future home you find he simply didn't cite anyone his accusers jump to conclusions and make false assumptions but they are wrong the accusers aren't treating brother branham as they'd like to be treated if brother branham's accusers made a mistake and forgot to cite someone would they want people calling them a plagiarist i doubt it in this first quote brother branham said he wrote down scriptures and notes let's listen for this great subject we we i suppose if i would take my time on this because you have to bring in many things it would take weeks but i've wrote down some scriptures some notes just to hit the highlights let you study here in the second quote brother branham's accusers blast him for claiming he got his messages by prayer but they again make many false assumptions they're either ignorant or they forget about his other quotes from the seven church ages and seven seals which balance this quote and show he would both pray and read historians waiting on the leading of the holy ghost for the correct interpretation when the spirit anointed sometimes he would wait to get a vision not always but he would always confirm his sermons by prayer and the bible let's listen to the quotes now the way i always find my messages is by prayer i'll be sitting in prayer and something reveals to me i'll wait on a few minutes and see if it's right then i feel it closer and then sometimes i keep waiting for breaks into a vision but when it begins to come and i'm satisfied it comes from god then i go to the scripture see that is called to be the confirmation of every spiritual thing that's done because the bible is the complete revelation of jesus christ it is his body and now in that maybe i find a place in the scripture that doesn't sound just right i wonder i go back again to prayer it comes again then i then i begin to examine my scripture notice brother adam never says in this quote i prayed and got all of the future home teachings from a vision his accusers misconstrue his statement and falsely interpret this quote how they want to understand it in this third quote brother branham shared what he called a deep revelation from god which was the 1500 mile measurement of the length width and height of the new jerusalem he showed it would be a pyramid and with the sea gone there would be plenty of room for this city on earth notice brother brahm never said god showed me alone this revelation of course it's true he didn't mention larkin as it seems he likely forgot to cite larkin he simply said it was a revelation from god and god gives revelation as we read other writers and historians remember that brother branham was very grateful to dr larkin for his work when he taught daniel 70 weeks and it's likely brother branham got out a united states map and measured the 1500 miles from maine to florida to confirm what larkin talked he never said i got this directly from god and no man brother rams accusers are again jumping to conclusions likely due to their cognitive dissonance here's brother branham's none of these quote i'll bring the rest of this stuff along notice 2300 so now we find out that the city is measured 1500 miles square you know how far that would reach i measured it off this week it would reach from maine to florida and from the eastern seaboard to 600 miles of path west of the mississippi in other words half of the united states just for the city you say there ain't no room when the sea's gone there will be because printer four fifths of us in water that right the explosion dries up the seed erupts the earth oh my remember 1500 miles square what a city i want to share another quote about the future home from harvest time december 12 1964. brother branham says the revelation of the three works of grace connected to the future home was given to him by the lord he said the lord gave it to me so i think this quote proves brother branham's emphasis was on the three works of grace during the future home series and he likely forgot to cite larkin for all the information he got from him let's listen to the believe he quote and he's baptized then he's cleansed by the blood sanctification which is wesley then he's filled with the holy ghost fire takes the world out of him and he's filled with the spirit which is the word you believe that i watch what god's going to redeem his world the same way how many got the the future home of the bride and groom was agency i wrote it out and the lord gave it to me i give it all to you as he gives it to me friends it's important to know the three works of grace was originally taught by charles parnum 1873-1928 but he didn't teach it correctly he taught the third work of grace was speaking in tongues we know that was wrong and brother branham corrected that and friends clarence larkin never mentioned the gift of tongues nor three works of grace in the entire chapter of the renovation of the earth chapter 25 in his book so again we see how god used brother branham to take all the loose ends all the partial truths that were out there being taught by parnum larkin and he brought the divine interpretation of them the true revelation of many of these subjects and that's exactly what the scripture said he would do in revelation 10 7 he would finish the mystery of god remember that brother branham said the word justification 16 times in the future home sermon he said sanctification 12 times and mentioned the baptism of the holy ghost about 18 times in that sermon his emphasis was on the three works of grace which larkin never taught balancing the always pray to find a sermon quote as with many of brother branham's quotes you have to balance them with others we know the future home says he always got every sermon from prayer but that quote needs balance with others for example brother branham said he got 20 sermons from brother lee vale he also said he got many sermons from a minister he disagreed with about the bride going through the tribulation period let's listen to these quotes in the meetings and so forth he managed the meetings for a long time got a swell job and i'm sure this audience is always glad to hear by the day i win this today so much was said i couldn't see nothing to make it any better and i truly believe that it was the lord that worked this out for brother avails her brain amen after this morning yes you see it has to work that way we accept that from god yeah there's so many things he would say i i i have 20 sermons go down there what he said this man comes from a great a man a great teacher that's a bosom friend of mine very good man and he's a lovely brother i i'd be dares to say one word against the brother i wouldn't anyhow as a as a christian i wouldn't say nothing against him he don't agree with me on that one subject but he's my precious brother we eat together and oh he's just a damn new fellow i'll take his magazine read his articles and he writes something so forth and i'll talk a many texts out of what i i've already read his articles hear him say he's a great man but he he just can't agree with me i appreciate that if it's sincerity though you don't just want these push over you just have to grieve everything you say he's got his own convictions and he stands for i appreciate that and he's a good man of oh i am not a teacher a scholar at all but this man's full teacher and scholar but i can't agree with him because i don't see him i hope these quotes help you balance out the quote from the future home that said every sermon came by prayer we cannot take one quote and jump to a false conclusion like brother branham's accusers in closing i hope this complete teaching and this full video has been a blessing to you and i trust that you can now see brother branham was not a plagiarist he cited numerous historians on many occasions yes there were times he forgot to cite his sources but in almost every case he would come back to cite the source the future home is the only time brother branham didn't cite larkin but we can't jump to conclusions and condemn brother branham because he's not here to defend himself and because all of his previous behavior shows that he wanted to cite his sources he just didn't have the training and the scholarly understanding on how to do that my prayer is that you'll appreciate brother branham's labors more having now seen all the citations he actually gave brother branham was a true prophet of god and we're so thankful to follow his bible-based message given to him from the lord jesus christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
