[1:36] comes when he starts descending from the
[1:37] heaven there's a shout what is it is a
[1:40] message to get the people together a
[1:43] message comes forth first now R triming

[1:56] them found they didn't even have any
[1:57] oral in their lamps see but lamp
[2:00] trimming time it's Malachi 4 time why
[2:03] you it's Luke 17 it's it's all those
[2:06] prophecy that's it can perfectly set in
[2:08] order for this day in the scripture we
[2:10] see it living right there amen there's
[2:12] no see these things happen my dear
[2:14] brother sister when God in heaven knows
[2:16] I could dial on this platform right now
[2:18] you you just ought to walk around a
[2:20] while uh it's just it's tremendous when
[2:24] you see God come from the heavens stand
[2:26] before groups of man and stand there
[2:28] declare himself just is every is amen
[2:31] and that's the truth in this Bible
[2:33] open we're here and the denominational
[2:36] system is dead it's gone it'll never
[2:40] rise again it'll be burned that's what
[2:42] you do with the husk on the field flee
[2:45] from it get into Christ don't say I
[2:48] belong to Methodist I belong to baptist
[2:50] I belong to Pentecostal you get into
[2:52] Christ amen if you're in Christ there's
[2:54] not a word written in here but what you
[2:56] believe it I don't care what anybody
[2:57] else says and then God makes that thing
[2:59] manest because you when he pours the
[3:01] spirit up on the word what happens is
[3:03] like putting water on any other seed
[3:06] it'll live and it'll bring forth of its
[3:08] kind what a great thing it is today Lord
[3:11] to know that now we are united as one
[3:14] Spirit one Spirit the Holy Spirit has
[3:18] got the word in his grip comes with us
[3:21] and what a great thing it is what a
[3:23] privilege to cut loose from all the
[3:25] world to unite ourselves to Jesus Christ
[3:29] and to think that someday in a physical
[3:31] form with a body like his own glorious
[3:34] body we will sat down at the table at
[3:37] the wedding supper and where be United
[3:40] and where marriage to to live as bride
[3:42] and bridegroom through all times that is
[3:45] to come through the
[3:47] secret Lord God may this not be just a
[3:50] mythical thought to the people but may
[3:52] it become such a reality such hunger and
[3:54] thirst will said to the people that they
[3:56] reading your newspapers looking upon
[3:58] list at the r in the news is seeing it's
[4:01] uniting time the signs are flashing Lord
[4:05] God like we spoke of the women what they
[4:07] have do in the last days what the church
[4:09] would do in the last days and what the
[4:10] church ages would be and what the seals
[4:12] would be all these other things and we
[4:14] see if it was the days of Noah we see
[4:16] was the days of Sodom and lot when the
[4:19] angel of God made himself KNN in human
[4:21] flesh that eat the Flesh of a c and
[4:24] dranking the milk from the town and eat
[4:27] bread and stood there and could tell
[4:29] what was going on behind you and Jesus
[4:31] said the same thing will take place at
[4:32] the coming of the son of man Lord God we
[4:35] seen the pyramid how we build it up
[4:37] there and seen how we added these things
[4:39] to it and find that we're at the end
[4:41] time waiting for the Chief
[4:43] Cornerstone glory to God we pray father
