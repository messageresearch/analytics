[0:02] but the full and complete authority of
[0:06] the church is the pastor read that in
[0:08] the Bible see if that's not Bible
[0:11] order greetings friends in the matchless
[0:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:16] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:17] viewer's question about what a pastor is
[0:20] and how a pastor is elected this is an
[0:22] excellent question so hope this video is
[0:24] a help to many people by God's grace hi
[0:27] friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of
[0:28] Christ Fellowship here in Ohio USA and I
[0:31] defend the original Gospel of the Lord
[0:33] Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul
[0:36] and then had to restore through Martin
[0:37] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:39] William brandham who lived from 1909 to
[0:42] 1965 and I also defend brother M's Godly
[0:45] Christian character so let's go right to
[0:47] the question here I had an email and
[0:48] this is most of the question here it
[0:50] says good morning I'm wondering if you
[0:51] ever made a detailed video on what a
[0:54] pastor is what a pastor should do how to
[0:56] elect a pastor and even details on what
[0:58] an associate pastor is I'm looking for
[1:01] verses in the Bible and quotes on
[1:03] William brandham that support it as
[1:06] well so it seems like there's four
[1:08] questions in here but then there's sub
[1:10] questions within the original questions
[1:12] so we'll go through these first question
[1:14] is what is a pastor according to the
[1:16] Greek Lexicon a pastor means Shepherd so
[1:19] a pastor is a spiritual Shepherd over
[1:21] God's people this is an office that St
[1:25] Paul ordained in Ephesians
[1:26] 4:1 there was Apostles prophets teachers
[1:30] pastors and evangelists so the pastor is
[1:34] one office in the five-fold ministry but
[1:37] it's actually the office that has the
[1:39] most constant influence on the people of
[1:42] God an apostle as a missionary will make
[1:45] new converts in a certain area and then
[1:48] ordain elders and then leave those
[1:50] Elders that the missionary ordains will
[1:52] be the Pastors in a certain area but of
[1:56] course each individual church has only
[1:58] one Pastor now there are cases of
[2:00] associate pastors but you don't find the
[2:02] word associate pastor in the Bible
[2:05] prophets are men who speak with thus
[2:07] sayi the Lord they foretell things they
[2:10] reveal Mysteries according to numerous
[2:11] Bible scriptures like Amos
[2:14] 3:7 prophets also have dreams and
[2:16] visions that come to pass according to
[2:17] Numbers Chapter 12 the pastor is the
[2:20] shepherd he stays with the congregation
[2:21] and feeds them the word of God the
[2:23] Evangelist often travels around like
[2:26] Philip the Evangelist when he went to
[2:28] Samaria in Acts chapter 8 they preach
[2:30] the Gospel of Jesus Christ it stirs the
[2:32] people up and they move on to another
[2:34] church the teacher often stays in the
[2:36] local church but the teacher can also
[2:38] travel a little bit like a evangelist
[2:40] they teach the word of God in a very
[2:41] deep way they give instruction very
[2:44] thorough instruction into the deep
[2:47] things of God in order to help the
[2:49] people be more established and rooted in
[2:51] the Gospel of Jesus Christ so the first
[2:54] sub question within that first question
[2:55] is what age do you have to be you just
[2:57] have to be old enough to be married and
[2:59] have children children that's according
[3:01] to 1 Timothy 3 it's verse 4 one that
[3:03] ruleth well his own house having his
[3:05] children in subjection with all gravity
[3:07] he also has to be old enough not to be a
[3:09] novice that's 1 Timothy 3:6 not a novice
[3:13] lest being lifted up with pride he fall
[3:15] into the condemnation of the devil
[3:17] novice means a newly planted believer or
[3:20] a young convert so the age of a person
[3:23] when they're beyond a novice all depends
[3:26] on their gift in their life or their
[3:28] Devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ I'll
[3:30] just use myself as an example I heard
[3:32] the message in late 2001 but by 2006 I
[3:36] was pastoring and I pastored ever since
[3:38] the last 18 years by God's grace So
[3:41] within four years of being in the
[3:42] message I'd received the baptism of the
[3:44] Holy Ghost I'd been preaching I was a
[3:46] deacon and then four years later I was
[3:49] ordained as a pastor so finishing that
[3:52] question what is a pastor the pastor is
[3:54] the preacher who stays with the local
[3:56] congregation to feed them the word of
[3:58] God the pastor is like the overseer we
[4:02] see this in Acts 20:28 take heed
[4:04] therefore unto yourselves and to all the
[4:06] flock over which the Holy Ghost has made
[4:08] you overseers to feed the Church of God
[4:11] which he has purchased with his own
[4:13] blood so that kind of gets into the next
[4:15] question second question is what should
[4:16] a pastor do so basically according to
[4:18] scripture there's numerous things a
[4:20] pastor should do but he should feed the
[4:21] flock that's acts
[4:23] 20:28 this feeding the flock will build
[4:26] the people up that's in Acts
[4:28] 20:32 the word of his grace which is
[4:30] able to build you up Pastor also to be
[4:33] an example to the people not a lord over
[4:36] the people that's in 1 Peter 5: 2-4 feed
[4:41] the flock of God which is among you
[4:42] taking the oversight thereof so there's
[4:44] the overseeing not by constraint but
[4:46] willingly not for filthy lucer but of a
[4:49] ready mind neither is being Lords over
[4:51] God's Heritage but being amples to the
[4:53] flock so the pastor is an example of a
[4:56] Christian to the flock the pastor is
[4:59] supposed to pray
[5:00] and study the word of God according to
[5:02] acts 6 2-4 they need time to be devoted
[5:05] to study and prayer a pastor can do a
[5:09] job as well like I do not all pastors
[5:12] have two jobs but I'm a VI bivocational
[5:14] Pastor uh St Paul did this acts 18:3 he
[5:18] was a Tent Maker so not only did he
[5:20] preach and teach and do a missionary
[5:22] work Apostle work but he also was a tent
[5:24] maker to have an income as well so the
[5:28] pastor also ruled by the word of God or
[5:31] he has the final say or final Authority
[5:33] in a local church that's Hebrews 13:7
[5:35] and8 remember them which have the rule
[5:37] over you who has spoken unto you the
[5:38] word of God whose Faith follow so again
[5:41] the church is supposed to follow the
[5:43] faith of the pastor because he's the
[5:44] example considering the end of their
[5:46] conversation so they should see the
[5:48] fruits of the pastor's life they should
[5:51] see the end of his conduct the fruit of
[5:53] his choices the fruit of his ministry
[5:56] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[5:58] and forever so here we see Jesus Christ
[6:00] has always done this he's always had one
[6:02] man lead the people and he's the example
[6:05] and people follow him we can think of
[6:07] Noah we can think of Moses we can think
[6:09] of Joshua God has always set this up Old
[6:11] Testament and New Testament and then
[6:14] Hebrews 13:17 obbey them that have the
[6:16] rule over you and submit yourselves for
[6:18] they watch for your souls so there we
[6:20] see the role of the pastor to watch over
[6:22] the Sheep the shepherd watches over the
[6:24] Sheep as they must give an account so
[6:27] that's something people don't realize
[6:28] the pastors have given give an account
[6:30] for his congregation that they may do it
[6:32] with joy so all pastors want to give an
[6:36] account to Jesus with joy that the
[6:39] congregations had Souls that were
[6:40] obedient to the word of God that
[6:42] followed the word of God but the Bible
[6:44] said there will be some that have to
[6:45] give an account with grief the Bible
[6:47] says and not with grief for it is
[6:49] unprofitable for you also answering the
[6:52] question what a pastor must do we can
[6:54] see the pastor requirements in Titus 1
[6:57] 5-9 Paul said he left Titus to set
[7:00] things in order Elders in every city of
[7:02] course Elder has two definitions it can
[7:05] be the pastor CU he's the local elder or
[7:07] it can be uh those men that have the
[7:10] most spiritual experience in the church
[7:13] so verse 6 Titus 1:6 if any be blameless
[7:15] the husband of one wife having faithful
[7:18] children not accused of Riot or unruly
[7:20] for a bishop so the bishop is another
[7:22] name for a pastor so you have Pastor
[7:24] Shepherd Bishop Elder those are all
[7:27] synonymous as the steward of God God not
[7:30] self-willed not soon angry not given to
[7:32] whine no Striker not given to Filthy
[7:34] luer but a lover of hospitality a lover
[7:37] of Good Men sober just holy temperate
[7:40] holding fast the faithful word as he has
[7:41] been taught that he may be able by sound
[7:44] Doctrine both to exhort and to convince
[7:46] the gainsayers so Titus has a long list
[7:49] of Pastor requirements then 1 Timothy 3
[7:52] 1-7 has an even longer list the Bible
[7:54] said if a man desire the office of a
[7:56] bishop he desires a good work the bishop
[7:59] must be blameless husband of one wife
[8:01] Vigilant sober of good behavior given
[8:03] Hospitality apt to teach so pastors
[8:06] should have the ability to teach the
[8:07] word of God as well although they may
[8:09] not be gifted the same way as someone
[8:12] who just has the gift of teaching not
[8:14] given to Wine no Striker not greedy a
[8:17] filthy ler but patient not a brawler not
[8:20] Covetous one that ruleth well his own
[8:22] house having his children in subjection
[8:24] with all gravity for if a man know not
[8:26] how to rule his own house how shall he
[8:28] take care of the Church of God not a
[8:30] novice lest being lifted up with pride
[8:31] he fall into the comination of the devil
[8:34] moreover he must have a good report of
[8:36] them which are without lest he fall into
[8:38] reproach and a snare of the devil moving
[8:40] on to question number three how do you
[8:42] elect a new pastor how does the election
[8:45] work how many candidates so those three
[8:48] questions can all be answered uh based
[8:50] upon the bylaws of the church brother
[8:53] brandham ran his church based upon
[8:55] bylaws which were approved of rules that
[8:59] the congregation had approved of and
[9:01] also the Board of Trustees and the
[9:03] pastor so there can be as many
[9:05] candidates to be the pastor as the
[9:07] church allows it all depends on the
[9:09] bylaws of the church and the election is
[9:11] set up the way the church wants it to be
[9:14] and every church can be Sovereign of
[9:15] itself brother Ram tells us every church
[9:17] is Sovereign of itself I'll play two
[9:19] quotes about bylaws it's from the
[9:21] placing of deacons 1958 brother Brandon
[9:24] was ordaining deacons and he said they
[9:26] must be ordained according to the bylaws
[9:28] of the church every year the deacons or
[9:30] trustees automatically fill their time
[9:32] if they want to come back they can or
[9:34] they can resign then brother Ram said
[9:36] his bylaws and the job descriptions of
[9:38] each Office of the church were hanging
[9:40] up in the Tabernacle that way everybody
[9:43] knew the duties of the trustees the
[9:44] deacons the treasurer the pastor and so
[9:47] forth let's listen to the quotes and
[9:50] ever so often according to the bylaws of
[9:53] the church every year the deacons are
[9:57] trustees automatically uh fill their
[10:00] time and if they want to come back all
[10:02] right if they do not want to come back
[10:04] then they can place some in their places
[10:08] at this board had resigned it's the
[10:11] sovereignty and the law of the church by
[10:14] the word of God therefore that it just
[10:17] can't say that I think this man would be
[10:19] a right man that isn't it brother
[10:21] Neville thinks this man be a right man
[10:23] are the trustee board think this man to
[10:25] be a right man it has to be by the
[10:28] church no one does anything within
[10:31] himself here it's the boat of the church
[10:34] it's a sovereign
[10:36] Church the old set of bylaws was
[10:39] destroyed in the 1937 flood we have
[10:42] recopied those and will be hung on the
[10:44] wall here soon the duties of Trustees
[10:48] deacons treasures and so forth pastors
[10:50] Associates and so forth it's important
[10:53] to know that before men in the Bible
[10:56] were ordained as pastors or Deacons
[10:59] that they first had to be proven so the
[11:02] people first had to see the gift of God
[11:04] operating in their life in order so they
[11:06] could be a candidate for that position
[11:08] so that's found in 1 Timothy 3:10 and
[11:10] let these also first be proved then let
[11:13] them use the office of a deacon being
[11:15] found blameless so in order for someone
[11:17] to be a candidate to be a pastor or
[11:19] associate pastor or Deacon the believer
[11:22] should witness beforehand that this man
[11:25] actually has the gift and the ability to
[11:27] do the office that he may go for
[11:29] or that he may be a candidate for and
[11:32] that would go for the pastor as well
[11:33] because he has to rule over his own
[11:34] house well first 1 Timothy 3:4 so before
[11:38] the man's a pastor people recognize wow
[11:40] he rules his house well he takes care of
[11:42] his own house he has all these
[11:44] attributes all these characteristics
[11:46] Paul laid out through Titus and
[11:48] Timothy's letters so he's first proven
[11:50] he's first tested before he's even
[11:52] considered a
[11:53] candidate okay Also regarding the third
[11:56] question what if a pastor dies can a
[11:58] dead man still be Pastor well I think
[12:01] scripturally we can say no a dead man
[12:04] cannot be the pastor of a church if a
[12:06] church has a dead man as the pastor
[12:08] they're breaking the word of God even if
[12:10] they're bylaws say that I think that's
[12:12] what's happening in brandom Tabernacle
[12:14] of course they call Brother brandham
[12:15] their Pastor they also call Joseph the
[12:17] pastor and then they have an associate
[12:18] pastor I believe but a dead man cannot
[12:21] Pastor a church there's no Bible example
[12:24] of that remember Hebrews 13:8 Jesus
[12:26] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[12:28] forever so in MO mooses was going off
[12:29] the scene God did not tell the people
[12:32] Moses will be the pastor even though
[12:33] he's going to be dead or Moses is still
[12:36] going to be the leader even though he's
[12:37] dead no God said the opposite God told
[12:39] Moses get Joshua ready he's going to
[12:41] lead the people in and out because God
[12:43] wants a living man Leading the People
[12:46] think about it a dead Shepherd cannot be
[12:48] the pastor of living sheep it doesn't
[12:51] work in the natural and it certainly
[12:52] doesn't work in the spiritual this is in
[12:54] numbers
[12:55] 2715 through 23 God tells Moses he's
[13:00] going the way of all the Earth so he
[13:02] said set a man over the congregation
[13:04] that's numbers
[13:05] 27:16 so that man Joshua would go out
[13:08] before them go in before them and may
[13:11] lead them out because God said the
[13:13] congregation of the Lord shall not be as
[13:15] sheep which have no Shepherd so here it
[13:17] is thus saith the Bible there's always a
[13:20] living man as a Shepherd over the people
[13:23] and the Lord said unto Moses in verse 18
[13:25] take thee Joshua the son of nun lay
[13:28] thine hand upon him do it before all the
[13:30] congregation in verse 19 give him a
[13:32] charge in the sight of all the people
[13:35] and verse 20 thou shalt put some of
[13:36] thine honor upon him that all the
[13:38] congregation of children of Israel may
[13:40] be obedient brother Braham even said in
[13:43] taking sides with Jesus 1962 he said
[13:45] he's getting old brother Neville's
[13:47] getting old if time rolls on you've got
[13:50] to fill our shoes so brother Ram knew if
[13:52] time went on he'd die brother Neville
[13:54] would die someone have to fill his shoes
[13:55] and preach the gospel let's listen to
[13:57] the quote you can stand and know the
[14:01] message and study to prove yourself you
[14:04] feel a call in your life I see two three
[14:07] young man four or five sitting another
[14:09] roll back here and and like that you're
[14:12] a young man I'm getting old brother
[14:14] Neville's is getting old we're
[14:16] middle-aged man if time rolls on we're
[14:19] going to walk off the scene after while
[14:21] you've got to fill our shoes see and so
[14:25] you seeing that maybe in that day even
[14:27] it'll be growing greater if there is a
[14:30] tomorrow you brother not with your
[14:32] little churches and you want to you're
[14:35] doing a work God will reward you for
[14:37] that go out there preach do everything
[14:40] you can that all of you get together you
[14:42] bunch of man and have meetings and talk
[14:44] on deep things of the scripture so I
[14:47] hope that answers that third question
[14:49] and all the sub questions underneath it
[14:51] brother Ram tells us every person in the
[14:53] church gets one vote as long as they're
[14:55] an official member and they're an
[14:57] official member if they meet the
[14:58] requirements of of the bylaws of the
[15:00] church so it all goes back to the bylaws
[15:02] as far as this third question about how
[15:04] to elect a pastor how does the election
[15:06] work how many candidates and what to do
[15:08] when a pastor dies also remember brother
[15:10] Ram said I won't always be your pastor
[15:13] that's from the future home 1964 let's
[15:15] listen to the quote I know it's been
[15:17] long and hot but
[15:20] people we won't always be standing
[15:23] here I won't always be your pastor
[15:30] let's make it sure brother bam even
[15:32] tells us in
[15:33] 1957 that the doctrine of brandham
[15:36] Tabernacle was between brother Neville
[15:38] and the church not even brother brandham
[15:40] because brother brandham wasn't elected
[15:42] as the pastor at that time brother Ram
[15:45] said the full complete Authority was in
[15:46] the pastor he said there's no one above
[15:49] the Elder he says I have nothing to do
[15:51] with what brother Neville does here
[15:53] that's up to you and brother Neville
[15:55] brother Ram said the only thing I do is
[15:56] just own the property and then brother
[15:58] Ram says you just can't remove brother
[15:59] Neville you need it in the mouth of two
[16:01] or three witnesses to bring an
[16:03] accusation against the elder brother R
[16:05] was quoting 1 Timothy 59 against an
[16:07] elder receive not an accusation but
[16:09] before two or three Witnesses then
[16:11] brother Ram said the congregation needs
[16:13] to vote and each person has one vote and
[16:16] the majority of the people is the
[16:18] authority of the Holy Ghost it's the
[16:20] vote of the Holy Ghost let's listen to
[16:22] the quote brother Ram said there's
[16:23] nobody got Authority here but the Holy
[16:25] Ghost that's right he does the moving
[16:27] and we take him as the majority of the
[16:29] people the way the people go let's
[16:31] listen to the quote but the full and
[16:34] complete authority of the church is the
[16:37] pastor read that in the Bible see if
[16:39] that's not Bible order that's exactly
[16:42] right there's no one above the Elder I
[16:44] have nothing to do with what brother
[16:45] Neville does here that's up to you and
[16:47] brother Neville if brother Neville
[16:49] wanted to preach Jehovah Witness
[16:50] Doctrine that's up to him and you see if
[16:53] he wanted to preach anything he wanted
[16:56] to that's between you and him and that's
[16:59] all if the congregation votes for him in
[17:00] there to preach that that's all right
[17:03] that's up to him the only thing that I
[17:04] do just is owning the property and if
[17:07] something another comes by that it's
[17:09] like moving the pastor and they want to
[17:10] take a vot on that you couldn't ask the
[17:12] Deacon to do that you'd come ask me I'd
[17:14] come down and say if you want to move
[17:15] the pastor tell me why has he done
[17:17] anything yes we called him drunk or we
[17:19] called him doing this or doing something
[17:20] wasn't right have you got three
[17:21] Witnesses of it yes we have that witness
[17:24] must first be tried don't receive an
[17:26] acquisation against the Elder L It Be by
[17:28] two or threee witness and let them first
[17:30] be proved against an elder then you have
[17:33] to swear to it that you saw it and prove
[17:35] it that you saw it and then if you did
[17:37] then that sins rebuked openly that it's
[17:40] wrong then say congregation do you want
[17:42] to change your pastor if the
[17:44] congregation votes forgive him and let
[17:46] him go on yet that's the way it has to
[17:48] stand see that isn't that fair that the
[17:51] way to run a church that's what the
[17:53] Bible said we have no Bishops and
[17:55] overseers and boards and so forth moves
[17:57] this and in and got a lot of authority
[17:58] there's nobody got Authority here but
[18:00] the Holy Ghost that's right he does the
[18:03] movement and we take him as the majority
[18:05] of the people the way the people
[18:08] go and the fourth and final question is
[18:11] what is an associate pastor so again the
[18:13] answer to this is it's based upon the
[18:15] bylaws of each sovereign individual
[18:18] Church having an associate pastor in the
[18:20] church can be a wonderful thing
[18:22] especially if the original Pastor is
[18:24] getting older it really helps a
[18:25] congregation from what I've heard from
[18:27] other pastors to know that there is a
[18:29] man who could take over if something
[18:32] happened to the original Pastor or the
[18:34] current Pastor one thing you'd want to
[18:37] be is faithful uh 2 Timothy 2:2 says and
[18:41] the things that thou has heard of me
[18:43] among many witnesses the same commit
[18:44] thou to Faithful Men Who should be able
[18:46] to teach others also so remember a
[18:49] pastor must be apt to teach and Paul
[18:51] tells us here commit the truth to
[18:53] Faithful Men Who can teach others as
[18:55] well so the associate should be someone
[18:58] who's faithful to the word of God it can
[18:59] teach others the word of God here's
[19:01] another quote brother brandom said when
[19:03] he first started brandom Tabernacle he
[19:05] was fulfilling most of the offices so
[19:07] some churches are big they have lots of
[19:09] brothers that can fill in the elected
[19:11] offices but other churches are small and
[19:13] so brother braham's church was small
[19:15] when he first started so he had to
[19:16] fulfill many of the offices he said he
[19:18] was Pastor Deacon trustee and everything
[19:20] else let's listen to the quotes from
[19:22] church order December 26
[19:24] 1963 look way we used to do it years ago
[19:27] sister gy wasn't The
[19:29] Pianist when I pastored here I would I
[19:32] had to be Pastor Deacon trustee
[19:34] everything else at once see but I I had
[19:36] to do it now you don't have to do it
[19:38] that way see because you got man to
[19:40] carry this out here's a good quote from
[19:42] Brother brandham Where it says the
[19:43] preacher should be a servant the
[19:45] preacher should never think he's greater
[19:47] than the people he should be lesser than
[19:49] the people brother R tells us this in
[19:50] why Christ speak uh October 4th
[19:54] 1959 the minister should be a public
[19:56] servant brother Ram says the preacher
[19:59] isn't any more than the man who just got
[20:01] saved this morning the preacher is a
[20:03] servant he's a brother let's listen to
[20:05] the quote and I I say this that I
[20:10] believe that this great spirit that's
[20:12] Among Us is the holy spirit I believe
[20:15] that he called me for this purpose
[20:18] doesn't make me any more than the man
[20:19] that got saved this morning just your
[20:22] servant your brother makes me less than
[20:24] you because I'm sent to serve you I'm a
[20:29] servant to the public a public service
[20:31] is a minister to serve the public to be
[20:34] the underdog to take this knocks and bl
[20:37] of the public whatever it is stand there
[20:40] and if you haven't got Grace enough to
[20:41] smile and take it then you ought to go
[20:44] back to Calvary and reconfirm your
[20:47] commission that's what you're supposed
[20:49] to
[20:49] do in
[20:51] closing friends hope this video was a
[20:53] blessing by the grace of God hopefully
[20:55] it answer some questions out there now
[20:56] there's numerous other scriptures and
[20:58] quotes I could have used but this is
[21:00] like a beginning video Perhaps Perhaps
[21:02] I'll do a part two if I get more
[21:03] questions on this but I want to give
[21:05] this wonderful brother a quick answer
[21:08] with scriptures and quotes so I'm hoping
[21:10] it's a help by the grace of God we're so
[21:13] thankful for the fivefold ministry all
[21:15] five gifts we need all five gifts they
[21:17] bring us to Unity they bring us to
[21:19] Perfection and they work the ministry by
[21:21] the grace of God according to Ephesians
[21:22] 4 8-16 at my house there's one morning
[21:25] every week where we pray just for the
[21:27] five full ministry we pray for all the
[21:28] ministers that we know and can think of
[21:31] and ask God to guide them help them
[21:32] strength them help them to rightly
[21:34] divide the word of truth it's so
[21:36] important these leaders these servants
[21:39] God will anoint them to bring us to the
[21:41] unity of the faith before the Rapture so
[21:43] we're thankful for that we're looking
[21:44] for the coming of the Lord by the grace
[21:46] of God if you have any questions
