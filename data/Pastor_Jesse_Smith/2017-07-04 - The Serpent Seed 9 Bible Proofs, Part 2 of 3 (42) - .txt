Description:
In Part 2 of this series, Proofs #3, #4, and #5 are taught with full Scriptural support. Proof #3 of the Serpent Seed is that the Tree of Life was and is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the only way to eternal life, for eternal is only in the Son. God never allowed eternal life to be received by a physical act of eating literal fruit. Proof #4 is the Serpent Seed doctrine explains why Jesus Christ had to be born of a virgin. Because the fall of mankind came through a sex act between Eve and the serpent, the redemption of mankind could only come apart from a sex act - which was the virgin birth of our Lord Jesus Christ. Proof #5 of the Serpent Seed is Adam and Eve covered their loins, or private parts, with aprons after eating of the fruit. Adam and Eve covered their private parts because those are the body parts they used when partaking of the fruit of sexual relations (Song of Solomon 5:1, Prov. 30:20) and they immediately felt shame in their private parts because of their disobedience.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] proof number three of the serpent seed is the tree of life was Jesus Christ not a natural tree because there is only one way to eternal life the Tree of Life could not have been a normal fruit bearing tree such as a pear or olive tree for if it was then there would have been a second works-based way to inherit eternal life but we know there is only one way to eternal life and that is through Jesus Christ who said he was the way and the life the only way to eternal life according to Jesus Christ himself he is the life the bread of life with the words of eternal life there is only one way to eternal life through Christ the person of Life there cannot be numerous ways to receiving eternal life if the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was just a literal tree with literal apples and so was the tree of life just a literal tree with literal fruit then that means one could have received eternal life by eating literal fruit we do not believe one could receive eternal life by eating a literal fruit because God never saved anyone by using that physical method but we believe one could receive eternal life by the same way God has always offered it spiritually receiving it by grace through faith in God's Plan of Salvation most people then believe that there are two ways to receive eternal life in the the Bible Way number one is by faith through Grace in the finished work of God's salvation plan or spiritually speaking we must be partakers of Jesus Christ who is our life way number two a literal Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden with literal fruit without a doubt way number one is the first and only way men have ever been able to receive eternal life way number two involves a physical works-based path to Salvation but way number one is a spiritual path since God is unchanging we believe the tree of life was a spiritual tree and not a literal tree that had literal fruit Jesus was and is the Tree of Life as Jesus said he is the way the only way to eternal life and that has not changed he is the same yesterday today and forever and if Christ was and is the tree of life then Satan or Lucifer was and is the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil eternal life is in the sun it is found nowhere else so it could not have been in a literal tree proof number four of the serpent seed is the serpent seed explains the purpose of the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ have you ever wondered why Jesus Christ had to be born of a virgin the doctrine of the serpent seed which God himself originated in Genesis 3:15 reveals the mystery of the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ since the fall of mankind came by sex the Redemption of mankind could only come without sex the purpose of the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ was for God to start a new race of humans the Born Again Holy Ghost filled Christians because the original race had been corrupted or perverted through the seed of the serpent because the sex act of adultery was the first fruit of sin in the Bible all men born of women were full of trouble or sin because the sin nature would be passed down to them from their sinful mothers and fathers through a sex act God's lamb his son Jesus Christ had to come to Earth and be born through Virgin birth to bypass the way sin came into the world this is why Jesus could live a sinless life because the sinful nature of man was not passed to him instead the word nature of God passed through to him because he was conceived of the Holy Ghost remember that the Bible said the word was was made flesh can you now see the purpose of the Virgin birth since the fall of mankind came by sex the Redemption of mankind could only come without sex through the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ God was going to begin a new creation or a new race of humans starting with Jesus himself for Jesus said he was the beginning of the creation of God according to Revelation 3:14 St Paul wrote that Jesus was the firstborn among many brethren according to Romans 8:29 meaning that Jesus would first experience the filling of the Holy Ghost which he received when the dove descended and remained upon him after his baptism at the River Jordan and then Jesus's many Brethren or Believers would experience the same New Birth that Jesus preached and pointed his followers to receive St Paul would teach that real Christians were new creatures their old habits and sinful lives were passed away because of the new birth the Holy Ghost baptism would give all believers power over Satan's kingdom of darkness Holy Ghost filled Christians would still battle the sin nature inside of them but would not become slaves to sinful habits and continue in a sinful lifestyle because they would have a greater person living inside of them the Holy Ghost true Christians will have holy ghost power to mature in Holiness and perfect Holiness in the fear of God which is the image of his son that we were predestined to be conformed into the power and importance of the Virgin birth is magnified in Revelation 5: 1 to10 as the only one who could open the book of redemption was the only one who came through a womb and was not born of a sexual act the Lord Jesus Christ no man or woman was worthy to loose the Seven Seals because they were all born in sin and shaped in iniquity Moses Noah Elijah Enoch Joseph Jacob and Mary the mother of Jesus were not worthy to redeem mankind only Jesus Christ was worthy the Virgin born son of the Living God Jesus was prophesied to be the woman's seed of Genesis 3:15 that God said would bruise the head of the serpent on Calvary and by doing this the sinless Spotless lamb won the victory over sin For All Mankind past present and future thankfully in the end times the Holy Spirit promised to finish the mystery of God according to Revelation 10:7 and this was to be done through the seventh angel who we believe was brother William brandham part of the mystery of God included the doctrine of the serpent seed the doctrine of the serpent seed does not save anyone for the doctrine of repentance and salvation is what saves people but the serpent Seed doctrine shines more light or Revelation on what we are all trying to see the absolute truth of the Bible and God's glorious Plan of Redemption now that this glorious revelation of the mystery of the Virgin Birth has has been revealed to you and I we can rejoice in the wisdom of God as St Paul did in Romans 11:33 oh the depth of the riches of both the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out proof number five of the serpent seed is after eating the fruit of sexual relations Adam and Eve covered their loins or private parts did you notice that after eating of the forbidden fruit which we believe was sexual relations Adam and Eve covered their loins or private parts with aprons in shame and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons in the Hebrew concordance the word aprons means loin coverings the loins are the area of the human reproductive parts Eve first ate of the fruit adultery with the serpent and then shared that fruit with Adam meaning she had sexual relations with him after Adam and Eve part took of this fruit both realized they were physically naked because the Bible teaches that whoredoms or disobedient sex acts would lead to the feeling of nakedness in Ezekiel 16:35 to 41 Adam and Eve were so ashamed of their sin that they hid themselves from God in Genesis 3:8 because being naked involves feelings of Shame according to the infallible Bible in Jeremiah 13:26 and 27 and nahm 3:5 We Believe Adam and Eve covered their loins or private parts in shame because those were the body parts they used in the partaking of the fruit Adam and Eve did not cover their mouths or sew hoods to cover their heads for they did not eat a literal Apple but instead they covered their private parts if eating literal apples caused Adam and Eve shame to know they were naked why can't we pass out apples today so that many worldly women will know they are dressed half naked furthermore how can an Apple open your mind to understanding and give you the awareness of the knowledge of Good and Evil and make you feel ashamed and naked eating apples today doesn't do that to people and it did not do that in the days of Adam and Eve but according to the Bible sex acts done in Disobedience and outside of the timing of God's perfect will do bring an awareness of evil and the feelings of Shame and nakedness
