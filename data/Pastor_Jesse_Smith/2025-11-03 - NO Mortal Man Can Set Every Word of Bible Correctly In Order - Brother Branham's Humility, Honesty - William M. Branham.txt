TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Now there may be times that I may not be able to set it together. I don't believe there's any mortal in the world can correctly set every word together. But we only can as the Holy Spirit inspires us to do. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matches name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Did God's prophet William Brandham set correctly [music] every word of the Bible in order? This week I was studying on how brother Bram loved the Bible, believed every word of it was thus sayith the Lord and I came across this beautiful and humble quote from 1954. God's provided way for healing. So according to brother Ram's own words, no, [music] he said he did not correctly set every word of the Bible in order and he did not believe any mortal [clears throat] man could. So this quote again exalts the infallibility of the holy bible the king James version and also exalts the lord Jesus [music] Christ who is the author of the holy bible for he is the word the word became flesh and the word [music] also gave us a written record of god's character which is the holy bible so by god's grace we'll eventually listen to this entire quote it's about 5 and a half minutes long but remember again friends brother Ram said he did not have all the answers brother Ram said this in questions and answers on the seals 1963 3. He was asked about whether or not Moses and Elijah have to die. And what about Enoch? Belam said, "I don't know. If I don't know, I'm just going to tell you I don't know. I don't know all the answers, folks. I don't know. And if I don't know, I'm going to tell you I don't know. And if I do know, I won't tell you till I do know. But I don't know." I've wondered about that myself. Now, notice there's eight times brother Bram says he doesn't know in this quote. So you can go back, count it for yourself, read it for yourself. But this shows the humility and the real Christian character of God's prophet, Brother Brandham. So I believe Brother Ram believed throughout his entire ministry that he wasn't perfect. He couldn't get every word correctly set in order and that no man could do that. But by the grace of God and by the gift of God, God would allow men, preachers, prophets like brother Random to correctly set a lot of the scripture in order. But brother Ram said he couldn't do every word as we'll soon see here from 1954. Now I thought about this and I wondered if I asked a tape boy this question. Was brother Brandham able as a mortal to set it together correctly every word of the Bible. I wonder what their answer would be. They'd probably shout, "Oh yes, praise the Lord. Press play and obey. Hallelujah. Brother Ram is a prophet of God. The greatest prophet of all time." Which is Joseph Brandham's words, not my words. I believe the Lord Jesus Christ is the greatest prophet of all time. Of course, brother Ram was a prophet of God, but Jesus Christ is the greatest prophet of all time. The God prophet. And remember friends, tape boys say that every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord. But of course, they don't believe that down in their subconscious. They know it's not true. They know they're deceived. They know they're following a lie. But I wonder what a tape boy would say to this quote here. We'll read it here. 1954, God's provided a way for healing. Brother Ram says, quote, "Now there may be times that I may not be able to set it together. I don't believe there's any mortal in the world can correctly set every word together, but we only can as the Holy Spirit inspires us to do." Many times it's contrary to our teaching. End quote. So there it is, friends. Would a tape boy say that's thus sayeth the Lord? If that's thus sayith the Lord, then Brother Brandon was not able to set every word in the Bible correctly in its order. And there's no mortal that could. And yet, if I asked them, "Was every word, thus sayith the Lord? Was everything correctly set in order by the tapes?" They'd probably say yes. But again, that shows that they're anointed by the deity spirit, a seducing spirit. And yet, Brother Ram said different than what a tape boy would say. Brother Ram was humble. He said he didn't know all the answers. No mortal has all the answers. So, we appreciate Brother Ram's humility and his honesty. No man can correctly set every word of the Bible in its correct order or place. But God did send brother Brandham to finish the mystery of God. As Revelation 10 1-7 says, I wrote a book about it in 2021. There's 12 Bible defined mysteries. The Bible calls these topics mysteries such as the rapture, the Godhead, Israel's blindness, the seven church ages, the will of God, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and more. So, brother Ram was able to set those correctly in their place in the word of God. And six out of those 12 we have thus sayith the Lord for brother Ram was able to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers. According to Malachi 45 and 6, brother restored many doctrinal and Bible truths according to Matthew 17:11. Elijah would come and restore all things and of course that's all things that pertain to our salvation. I got that from Peter in second Peter 1:3. according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness. So notice we get all things. But do we know all things? No. Can we correctly set every single word of the Bible in order? The answer is no. But God gives us everything we need. All things that we need for life and godliness while we're living. And of course, brother Random was the son of man ministry to the Gentiles. He was a prophet ministry to the Gentiles with the prophetic gift of the Lord Jesus Christ. and the Lord Jesus Christ's anointing to discern the secrets of the thoughts intents of the heart which he demonstrated night after night, decade after decade. Undoubtedly, William Brandham was a genuine prophet of God and we're so thankful for that. And remember friends, the Bible says in James 3:1 and2 that there should not be many masters or teachers because they get a greater condemnation or a greater judgment. Romans 8:1 says there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. But James 3:1 tells us we get a stricter judgment at the judgment seat of Christ when rewards are given out. So faithful teachers will be judged more strictly, more harshly because they handled the word of God. They knew the word of God and they communicated and preached the word of God to God's people. The Bible says in verse two though of James 3, that for in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same as a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body. Brother Ram echoed this in different words, but they asked him in questions answers on the seals in 1963. Was it 700 or 7,000 that didn't bow the knee? And brother Bram said, "It just come to my mind while I was talking and I just said 700 instead of 7,000. I make them mistakes all the time." So here we see Brother Bram admitted to making mistakes all the time. And then he said, "So you forgive me. See, I didn't mean to do that." So I love the humility, the Christian humility of God's prophet, Brother Brandham. This is an example of James 3:1 and2. How preachers many times offend. They say the wrong thing on accident, not on purpose. Brother Brand said, "I make them mistakes all the time. For in many things we offend all. Thank God the Holy Ghost is given to every true believer to prove all things. Try every spirit. Rightly divide the word of truth." And this allows all the praise, all the infallibility, all the glory to go to Jesus Christ our Lord. Let's examine this quote here from 1954 just to better understand the context. So beginning in paragraph 5, brother talks about he wants to see the church set in order. He talks about his Pentecostal experience and then he goes into the difference between Catholicism and Protestantism. The Catholics say God is in his church, but Protestants say God is in his word. Brother Ram said he talked to a priest a few days before this in July 1954. And this priest told Brother Brandham, "What the Bible says is all right, but if the church says contrary, then the church is right." Because Peter was the pope. Brother Brham said, "Of course, it's all right. Every fellow to his own belief, but I believe that whatever God has said, God's word does not alter. God's word does not change." And then he quotes Galatians 1:8. If an angel would come and teach anything other than what Paul had already preached, let him be accursed. Brother Ram said, "So I am a fundamental believer in the Bible, what the Bible says. I believe it and I believe it's the truth and ready to hang my soul in any phase of the Bible. Any sentence, comma, whatever it might be, that's God's word is everlasting truth. It's inspired and written and we stay with it." And then he showed how there was three ways to get a message in the Old Testament. by a prophet, by a dreamer or by the law. Then he spoke about the yurum thumbum and how the Holy Ghost would flash if something was true. And brother Brandham said the word of God is our yurum thumbum today. He said if any teaching is contrary to this Bible, it's wrong. Let him be accursed, but it must be built solidly upon the word as thus sayeth the Lord. And if this word is correctly set in order, taught by the minister, God solemnly under obligation to his son to answer that word and fulfill it. Now, that's the way I believe it. I believe every word of it, brother believed every word of the Bible. The Bible's infallible. The Bible's the absolute, not the tapes. Then we get to the quote that struck me. Now, there may be times that I may not be able to set it together. I don't believe there's any mortal in the world can correctly set every word together, but we only can as the Holy Spirit inspires us to do. Many times it's contrary to our teaching. Brother Rand talks about how some people blasphe the Holy Ghost when they left his meetings. And then he said he's here for one purpose to instruct for healing services tonight. So let's take a moment listen to all five and a half minutes of that quote by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; And so in these things, all these great things to see the church set together. When I first seen the Pentecostal people and heard them speak with tongues, I've been taught as a Baptist that that was of the devil. So I thought now look at here and uh I thought well the one thing I don't care what the church says the Bible said they shall speak with new tongues. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; First thing I had to either take the church or take the Bible. I said what am I going to do? He said let every man's word be a lie where it's bishop archbishop or whoever he is and my word be the truth. &gt;&gt; And that's the vast difference between Catholicism and Protestantism. See, Catholicism, you can't argue with the Catholic on the Bible. Because after all, if the church says something contrary to the Bible, it's the church. &gt;&gt; They say God is in his church. The Protestant says God is in his word. See, now there's the difference. So, you can't argue because if the church says a certain thing, ask them where they get not eaten meat on Friday and all these other things. They Well, they say the church said so. And a few days ago, I have an interview with a priest. The priest said, I was asking some questions as my people before me were Catholic. And I said, uh, I want to ask you some questions scripturally. And um, uh, he said, just a minute, Mr. Brandon. He said, see, we Catholics go to church and worship. You Protestants stay home and read the Bible, but we go to church and worship. I said, but what? That's an exam. What? Now he said, "See, we don't notice what what the Bible says is all right. But if the church says contrary, then the church is right because Peter was the pope and the pope succeeds Peter and whatever the church has set together, that is the order. That's what it goes. God still moved." Well, I said, "Of course, it's all right. Every fellow, that's what makes us America. every fellow to his own belief. But I believe that whatever God has said, God's word does not alter. God's word does not change. One jot or tit will in no wise pass from it till every bit of it fulfilled. And I believe that Paul said, "If an angel from heaven would come and teach any other thing than what you had already been taught in this scripture, let him be unto you a cursed." Galatians 1:8. So, I am a fundamental believer in the Bible. What the Bible says, I believe it. And I believe it's the truth and ready to hang my soul on any phase of the Bible or any any sentence, comma, whatever it might be that God's word is everlasting true. It's inspired and written and we stay with it. In the Old Testament, there was three ways that they could get a message. that was by a prophet, by a dreamer, or by the law. And now if a prophet prophesied and on the breast of Aaron, Aaron was a Yurmma thundum. And if the lights flashed on the Yurmma thundum, that prophet was telling the truth. But the lights didn't flash on that Yurmmaundum, then it was wrong. If a dreamer dreamed a dream and told that dream and and it didn't flash on the yarmmathundum, it was wrong. The prophet, if he prophesied and the lights didn't flash, he was wrong. And the yermma thundum from that priesthood was taken away. But here is the yermmaundum of the priesthood today. &gt;&gt; The word of God, if a dreamer or a prophet or a preacher or anything teaches contrary to this Bible, it's wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let him be accursed. But it must be built solidly upon this word as thus sayaeth the Lord. And if this word is correctly set in order and taught by the minister, God's solemnly under obligation to his son to answer that word and fulfill it. Now, that's the way I believe the Bible. I believe every word of it. Now, there may be times that I may not be able to set it together. I don't believe as any mortal in the world can correctly set every word together, but we only can as the Holy Spirit inspires us to do. Many times it's contrary to her teaching. My wife happened to be standing outside last night just soon as the she said two or three passed the platform said a group of people got up and walked out said one of them looked over the other and said, "What do you think about?" I said, "All punk. There's nothing to that." And um another one walked out in a few minutes said, "Well, it was a pretty good show, wasn't it? Not to have to pay to get in." And that's the opinion of the starchy people of this world. &gt;&gt; See, that's their opinion. It's always been their opinion. It was their opinion. Their fathers had the same opinion and is in hell today. That's right. And remember what if this would have been the truth they was listening at last night. Then they have blasphemed the Holy Ghost which is never forgiveness in this world or the world to come. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's best to keep still if you're not sure. So the Lord bless you. Now this afternoon as we've gathered here for one purpose that's to instruct for healing services tonight. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Again, it's so refreshing to see Brother Ram's love for the Bible, his understanding that every word of the Bible, any phase of it or any phrase of it, any quote of the Bible is thus sayeth the Lord. It is the everlasting word of God. As brother M said, so beautiful. Brother Ram's love for the Bible was apparent through his life, through the fruits of his life, the genuine Holy Ghost fruits of his life and ministry. We're so thankful for a true prophet of God, Brother William Marin Brandham. Let us continue to rightly divide the word of truth and do our best to rightly divide the word of truth. As brother Ram said, "No mortal man can set every single word in the Bible correctly together." How I wish I could. How any true man of God wishes he could, but we must do our best with it by the grace of God. receive the inspiration of the Holy Ghost to preach our sermons week after week, month after month, year after year, decade after decade, to strengthen the bride of Christ, to edify the bride of Christ, to feed the bride of Christ as the bride of Christ prepares for the going away. Let's keep feeding on the word of God. The Lord Jesus Christ is here to reveal his word to us, help us rightly divide it, help us correctly set it in order, the best that a mortal man could. It won't be perfect, but Jesus Christ is here to do that. He said he'd bring all things to our remembrance. The Holy Ghost told us to preach the word. Be instant in season and out of season. The Holy Ghost said fight the good fight of faith. The Holy Ghost said he would work with the preachers when they went forth and preached everywhere according to Mark 16:20. And the Holy Ghost would confirm the word with signs following. Amen. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God [music] bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ [music] to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He's never failed.
