TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] You don't even have to have your prayer cards. You know that. My hardly any of them last evening had prayer cards. The prayer card just keep everybody from rushing up at once so they can be in order and have some kind of a system to it. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to defend God's prophet William Brham and his use of prayer cards. Some of Brother Brandham's accusers have tried to accuse Brother Brandham of using prayer cards in a dishonest way, accusing Brother Brandham of pretending to have the gift of discernment. Of course, we know that's a lie. Brother Brandham had a genuine gift of discernment given to him by the Lord Jesus Christ. So, in this video, we'll go through the simple answers that prove brother Brandham used prayer cards honestly and he had a genuine gift of discernment by the gift of the Holy Ghost. Before getting into that, let's review the impeccable Christian character of God's prophet, Brother William Brandham. From the very first moment I heard brother Brandham preach, I started weeping when he gave his life story. Brother Brandham is the most faithful Bible teacher I have ever heard. He meets the six qualifications to be a prophet. And remember, there could be more qualifications. First, he had thus sayith the Lords that came to pass. I have a video with at least six thus sayith the Lords that came to pass spoken before the event in 1958. Thus sayith the Lord, Marilyn Hickey would have a baby. She had it 10 years later. Second, 1961, no greater gift to the Gentiles than Brother Ram's gift. 1962, women would continue to strip themselves. 1965, the vision of the United States, America, dancing to rock and roll with bobta women. 1965, the death of Florence Shicaran. And 1965, no denomination will break up and come back to the word. The second qualification, he revealed the secrets of the Bible, most notably the revelation of the seven seals in fulfillment of Amos 3:7, Revelation 10:7, of course, Revelation 6, and Revelation chapter 8. Thirdly, brother Brandham had godly life with good fruits of his ministry. Fourth, he had fruit to his ministry which are saved souls. Fifth, he taught the word in its purity. And six, he had supernatural works, dreams, and visions from the Lord Jesus Christ. So, it's undeniable William Brandham was a genuine prophet of God. Some people have questions about other events in Brother Brham's life. I have a short section in my brown bear vision video that goes through numerous other topics such as the brown bear vision. God fulfilled his part. Brother Brandham failed his part and there's 10 Bible examples of believers who failed visions yet they were still true believers. The 10th vision, brother Ram was confused about it his whole life, but I think all the evidence is clear that it was fulfilled the week he preached the seven seals in March of 1963. The municipal bridge prophecy is Brother Ram's word against Brother Ram's accuser's words. They admit two people died in the construction of the bridge. So it wouldn't be a stretch for 16 people to have died in some type of cover up. So again, it's Brother Ram's word against them. So it's Brother Ram's word against the accuser's word. I'm going to go with brother Brandon because he's a genuine prophet of God. I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt. The vision of the 300,000. And I believe that was fulfilled in 1954 in Bombay, India because the mayor estimated 500,000 came to the meetings. And remember friends, prophets can get confused with visions just like John the Baptist. He said, "Should we look for another or is Jesus the Messiah?" And also Elijah was told to do three things. Anoint three men and Elijah only did one. So God could interpret his word any way he wants. So, Brother Brandham could have went to India and had a large group and maybe not the entire number of 300,000, but then God could have done it through ministries that came after brother Brandham that preached the same gospel, the saving healing gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 13:8, God could have fulfilled it through other preachers anointed with the same spirit. And lastly, the Arizona cloud, February 28th, 1963. Twice, Brother Ram said, "In the name of the Lord, something was going to happen with a snow white pyramid. It was prophesied beforehand and it came to pass. The vindication was the revelation of the seven seals was unlike any other teaching. It was unlike Clarence Larkin. It was unlike Charles Day's Russell and Uriah Smith. I have a video series on that. There's over 38 differences between brother Ram's revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ on the seven seals versus Larkin Russell and Uriah Smith. In my 2021 book, I have 30 thus sayith the Lords from God's prophet, brother Brandham. 11 of them are future thus sayith the Lords that will come to pass. Six of them are thus sayith the Lord related to the 12 New Testament mysteries. Eight thus sayith the Lords are related to doctrinal subjects from the Bible restoring Paul's gospel. And the rest of them are the prophecies that have come to pass. As I mentioned earlier, friends, we also want to remember the character of some of Brother's accusers. Not all of them, but some of Brother Ham's accusers are very disingenuous. I've offered free copies of my books to them. They don't want them. They won't research the other side. That shows me they're not true researchers. They're not interested in facts and truth. And yet, I'll listen to their podcast. I'll watch their videos and respond to them. And I never get any reply. For example, my video series on the seven seals. I show pictures from Larkin's books, Russell's books, proving Brother Ram did not plagiarize them, but the accusers won't reach out and respond to those. I made a video showing how Brother Ram did not pretend to speak in tongues, proving it's a false accusation, and Brother Ram's accusers never reply to that. I wrote an entire book on Christian modesty. Brother Ram's accusers won't read it, won't respond to it. So, as Jesus said, a tree is known by its fruit. All right, friends. So, let's start talking about the prayer cards. The accusation is that brother Brandham memorized the prayer cards and was pretending to discern the thoughts intents of the heart. But we know that's not true. We know brother Brandham had a genuine prophetic gift. It was the son of man anointing a son of man. The Lord Jesus Christ anointed brother Brandham with the gift of discernment. A prophetic gift. First, it's ridiculous to say brother Random memorized all the prayer cards. Some delusional accusers of brother Random contradict themselves by claiming brother Random memorized the cards. At the same time, they slander him by saying he couldn't remember all the details about the stories and testimonies he would repeatedly share around the nation and around the world. So, do they think brother Brandham had a good memory or not? See friends, they contradict themselves. So, that's the first clue they're falsely accusing brother Brandham. Second, it's ridiculous to say Billy Paul whispered the information to brother Brandham in the prayer lines. That doesn't explain the many, many prayer lines when Billy Paul was not up on the platform or near the pulpit and God was still using brother Brandham to reveal the thoughts and intents of the heart of the sick who were in the prayer line. I don't believe Billy Paul was ever whispering the information to brother Brandham. Brother Brandham had a true gift of discernment from the Lord Jesus Christ. Now friends, brother Bram told us one reason he used the prayer cards. It was to keep everybody from rushing up at once. Brother Ram said this in 1951 at thy word. So brother Ram did not use prayer cards in deceit. He used it for order and for a system. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to have your prayer cards. You know that. My hardly any of them last evening had prayer cards. The prayer card just keep everybody rushing up at once so they can be in order and have some kind of a system to it. The next obvious truth concerning the prayer lines that shows the ridiculous nature of the false accusation is how brother Brandham would often speak numerous secret details about the believers who were standing before him in the prayer lines. And this was proof he was in fact seeing visions from the Holy Spirit about the sick person's life. And this was a great thought a brother from Germany shared with me. So I want to thank that brother. He and I are in contact on the Telegram app. So I appreciate this precious brother and this is true because all these details brother revealed on the platform through visions could not fit on a prayer card. So as the thumbnail of this video shows here's an example of a prayer card. It says brand campaigns as the person's name the address are you a Christian and the card number and then a place to name their affliction. From what I can tell and from what I've seen, I've never seen different prayer cards that have a lot more space to list all the details that would be needed for brother Random to memorize and share in the prayer lines. And this proves Brother Ram did not pretend to discern. He had a genuine gift of discernment by the Holy Ghost. There's many testimonies of believers online sharing that that they were discerned by the gift in Brother Ram's life. Things Brother Ram could not have known. One simple example of this is the sister named Eva York from 1954, The Deep Calleth into Under the Deep. I showed this section on a video called Three Prophecies of William Brham. Brother Random reveals 15 secrets of Eva York from this 1954 video. First, she's sick. There's a dark spirit around her. Second, third, it's a spirit of death. Fourth, it's a form of cancer. Fifth, it's breast cancer. Sixth, she was examined by a strong person. Now, think about that. She could have been examined by a weaker, older male or female. But here, Brother Bram knows the secret of her heart because it's a gift of discernment from the Holy Ghost. Seventh, it was a ruptured condition in the boughels. Eighth, stomach trouble. Ninth, severe heart trouble causing fainting. Friends, this information could not have fit on Eva's prayer card. 10th, she nearly passed out sitting on a bed. And then 11th, there's another dark spirit. 12th is her name. 13th is her address. 14th is she lives in the city. 15th, she's going home to be well. Let's watch the video. By God's grace, &gt;&gt; of course, you're sick and you're suffering with a condition that's it's a dark spirit around you. It's death and it's in a form of cancer. And the cancer is located on the breast. and you're senior examined by someone strong and it's a you got a a ruptured condition and the rupture is in the bowel and you have a stomach trouble also a severe heart trouble that caused you fainting here a few days ago you're sitting sideways on the side of a bed and nearly passed out looking towards your window [Music] are those things truth. Yes, &gt;&gt; that was all true. &gt;&gt; All true. &gt;&gt; Or whatever it was, of course, it's gone from you. But what do you think that was that knows your lie? Was it Jesus Christ? You accept it to be that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; You're willing. You know that something supernatural is here. &gt;&gt; And if you believe it to be the Lord Jesus as I have preached it out of the word and you believe it to be the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. &gt;&gt; I know there's a dark spirit. see it hanging at you yet? It's something very serious. Say, "I see you. Your name is uh Eva." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And your last name is York. &gt;&gt; And you live in this city. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And your house number is 6136 Street. Is that right? &gt;&gt; You're going home to be well. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, may you go and be made well. [Music] I'd like to add one more quote here. I remember this from 1960. This is from As I Was with Moses. So, uh, so will I be with thee. In this quote, brother Ram seems to regret using prayer cards to some degree because he said he was focusing too much emphasis on the sign instead of the commission. And there's numerous quotes like this, of course, if you know, if you listen to God's prophet, Brother Brandham. But I just thought I would share this one. It seems Brother Ram used these prayer cards again because of the rush of people that would want to come forward and be prayed for and perhaps have a discernment or have brother Ram break out into a vision of their life as they're pulling on the gift of God. But here in 1960, brother Ram says, "All the Pentecostal people like signs, but the commission was to pray for the sick." And then he says these humble words. Listen. He said, "And tens of thousands times thousands that I have failed to pray for because they all desired the sign. They all desire it." End quote. So here, Brother Ram's over 13 years or likely 13 or 12 years into his ministry, and it seems like he realizes I'm putting too much emphasis on the discernment, the prayer lines, the prayer cards because it slowed down the number of people I could pray for. A very humble thing for a prophet of God to say. But again, it's just like every Bible prophet. Abraham made mistakes. Noah made mistakes. Moses made mistakes. Joshua made mistakes. John the Baptist was human, made mistakes. So, we can see here how Brother Brandham in his humanity wasn't perfect. He had to rely upon the grace of God just like every other sinner saved by grace. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; I've wronged. I've done wrong. That's why I base these sermons the way I have because he said, "As I was with Moses', so I be with you." And when that hand come down and pointed that very same scripture, for a long time I've wondered because I didn't know what the commission was. I've looked for something supernatural beyond that. God cannot get away from his commission. &gt;&gt; God gives a commission. That's what it must remain. But all the Pentecostal people like signs. &gt;&gt; They like to see it. The Bible said a wicked indulterous generation seeks after signs. But the commission was pray for the sick and tens of thousands times thousands that I failed to pray for because they all desired the sign they all desire. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Again, I want to thank my brother from Germany for that wonderful thought about the accusation about memorizing prayer cards cannot stand because brother Random gave so many details through the visions. God gave him so many details that would not fit on prayer cards. So, praise the Lord for God sending his prophet, brother William Brandham, to fulfill the scriptures. Revelation 10:7, finishing the mystery of God. Malachi 45 and 6, turning our hearts back to the apostolic fathers. Matthew 17:11, restoring all things. Luke 17:30, a son of man, a prophet, revealing the son of man, the Lord Jesus Christ. Just like every prophet was revealing the Lord Jesus Christ through their discernment, through their prophecy, the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy. We thank God for an honest prophet, a genuine prophet, a Holy Ghostfilled prophet like William Mary and Brandham. And it is an absolute joy to follow this Bible message that God gave to brother Brandham. I heard a preacher say it recently. It was so beautiful. He was noticing the difference between Joseph Smith and brother Brandham. He said, "Joseph Smith met an angel and added books to the Bible, which is a sin." But William Brham met an angel and revealed the Bible itself. Not adding anything to the Bible, not taking anything away, just revealing the truths already contained in the scripture. Thank God for a genuine prophet of God, William Marin and Brandham. Friends, if you're not saved and assured you're going to heaven, you need to repent of your sins, confess all your sins to the Lord Jesus Christ, and then call upon his name, be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's called salvation. That's called justification. You're declared righteous. You've accepted Jesus forgiveness for your sins. He became cursed so you might receive the righteousness of Christ. You might be blessed. Your faith is in the blood of Jesus Christ. Then the Holy Spirit will come into your human spirit, sanctify you, purify you, clean you out, give you a new spirit. He saves you and gives you a new heart. And then he sanctifies you, gives you a new spirit. And then some glorious day, he'll fill your soul with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Your soul will be immersed with the spirit of God. You'll be able to say amen to every word of God. And then you'll have power to be a witness unto Jerusalem, Judea, the uttermost parts of the earth, to Akran, Ohio, to the city in which God has called you to be a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you, and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings the good news that Jesus raised from the dead living among man today his church the same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed [Music]
