TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer three questions from viewers. So by the grace of God, we'll do that. Now the first question is really about Romans 8:9 and how the Bible says now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. So the full question says we believe that to be saved you must have a sign which is the Holy Spirit. So like people in denominations they are saved. The scripture says that whoever does not have the spirit of Christ does not belong to him. Could you explain this to me? Excellent question. So again according to Matthew 25:es 1-1 or 1-13 I believe there are Christians who are wise Christians and then there are foolish Christians. The wise Christians have extra oil, which means they have the oil of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their souls. Just like in the parable, the wise virgins prepared extra oil. And so there's three parts to man according to 1 Thessalonians 5:23. There's the body, there's the human spirit or the mind, and then there's the soul. And so the wise virgins had extra oil. They had it in the soul, not just in the human spirit. So foolish virgins are people like those in denominations who have a true love for the Lord, but they're not baptized with the Holy Ghost. They're missing oil. They're missing an extra portion of the anointing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So we would say also that they're justified and perhaps a little sanctified, but they're not baptized with the Holy Ghost. They have not received the three works of God's grace. And so regarding Romans 8:9, now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he's none of his. Then we would say a foolish virgin does belong to Christ because they have a measure of the Holy Ghost. The word measure is used for Christians. There's a measure of faith. And of course, faith is what saves us. By grace, you're saved through faith according to Ephesians 2:8-10. Another way to look at this is this visual here of the stature of perfect man. We know second Peter chapter 1 says there's levels of the anointing of the Holy Ghost. So you start with faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity. So I believe that faith all the way up through brotherly kindness are anointings for justification and sanctification. But charity is the third work of grace, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So even a person who is freshly saved or justified, they have the spirit of Christ just in a smaller measure. And friends, we can apply this of course to the thief on the cross. Now that was of course in the Old Testament, but even in the Old Testament, they could be justified and sanctified. They just couldn't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul because the Holy Ghost wasn't yet given until Jesus was glorified according to John 7. I believe it's verses 37-39. So the thief on the cross recognized he was worthy of death because of his stealing. He recognized his own guilt. But he recognized also Jesus as innocent as the true lamb of God and asked to be remembered when Jesus came into his kingdom. And of course Jesus said, "Today you'll be with me in paradise." So here the thief on the cross, the saved thief was justified. He had the spirit of Christ. the spirit of Christ had come upon him to recognize his sins, repent of his sins, and trust in Jesus Christ for salvation. Remember, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. If God saved someone, we'd say, on their deathbed here in the New Testament, then he's the same forever, just like he saved the thief on the cross there on his cross where he couldn't get down from the cross and be baptized. And a repentant sinner who is justified does have the spirit of Christ in a small measure justification or we would say faith. So a justified and sanctified person does belong to Christ. They're just in a foolish condition. We'd say they haven't gone all the way into the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Second question. If someone believes in a doctrine that is contrary to the Bible like the Trinity, can it be immediately concluded that this person does not have the Holy Spirit? Excellent question. I would say the answer is most of the time, yes. Most of the time you can conclude immediately that the person does not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the reason I say that is because now we're almost 60 years past the seven church age messenger coming, brother Brandham. And that's given the world 60 years to have the revelation of the godhead go around the world through preaching, through the internet, and so forth. So someone who has the baptism of the Holy Ghost will not add to the word of God. The trinitarian doctrine adds to the word of God. The words three persons are never applied to God. Nor are two persons ever applied to God. Nor is the phrase eternal son ever applied to God. So those are all additions to the Bible. Those are all false teachings that originate from the trinitarian dogma. Now, the reason I say in most cases is because brother Brandham believes he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in a shed right after he was saved. And and of course, he believed in the Trinity up until about 1954. I have a recent video on that. And then I preached a sermon on it where there's I think at least 22 or 23 quotes where brother Ram speaks positively of the second person of the Trinity, of the third person of the Trinity. He said he loved the third person of the Trinity, and the third person of the Trinity burned in his heart. So it seems just in ignorance, brother Ram had the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but yet he believed in three persons up until about 1954. He probably received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1932 or 1933, at least according to the timeline that I've come to understand. And I could be wrong on that. So please correct me if I'm wrong on that by God's grace. So I try to use that principle of Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And this kind of goes along with the first question. If Jesus Christ saved somebody on their deathbed or on their cross right before they died, then he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He can save people in the very last moments. And here, he can fill someone with the baptism of the Holy Ghost even before they've received the revelation of the mystery. Now, remember, mysteries do not pertain to salvation. The blood of Jesus Christ and faith in the blood of Jesus Christ, being saved by grace through faith, that pertains to salvation, not by works, lest any man should boast. So we apply that to salvation. We also apply this to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. If brother Ram received the baptism of the Holy Ghost without understanding the truth of the Godhead, well then perhaps Jesus Christ could do that today by the grace of God. Now most times in the Bible, people receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost through another preacher. We see that in Acts chapter 2 with Peter. We see that in Acts chapter 8. In Acts chapter 8 with Peter and John coming down to pray for the Samaritans. We see that in Acts chapter 10 with Peter at the house of Cornelius and we see that in Acts chapter 19 with Paul in Ephesus. In all the cases in the Bible, a preacher had to be there for people to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But in Brother Bam's testimony, it seems like he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost just between he and the Lord Jesus Christ. So I also want to leave room that that's possible today. Someone could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without a preacher being there. But I would say in most cases in the Bible, a preacher is there when a person receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And that person could have a misunderstanding about the Godhead because it doesn't pertain to salvation. And they could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost before they receive the revelation that God is one person. And the third and final question is about confession. I was asked, could you please do a video on confession? What does James 5 mean? Do we have to confess our sins as believers to our pastor like the Catholic Church to the pope? So, of course, the answer is no. You don't have to confess your faults to the pastor. You would only confess your faults to the pastor if you sinned against the pastor. Matthew 5:23 and 24 say, "If you bring your gift to be offered and you remember that a brother has something against you, leave your gift there and go make it right." So if you're praying and worshiping and coming to the house of God and realize, "Oh, my brother is angry against me or is upset with me, I need to leave and go make that right." So if someone's upset with me, I need to go make it right. And then Matthew 18:15 through19 is the other side. If someone sins against me, I need to go to them one-on-one. If they don't receive it, I need to take another witness. And then if they don't receive that, I got to bring it before the church. And then the church has to go to the individual. So that would be the only time you'd have to confess your sins to the pastor is if you actually sinned against the pastor. We do not want to bring Catholic traditions into the message of the hour, the Bible revelations for today. Some helpful scriptures are 1 John 1:9, "If we confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." This text never says you have to confess to your pastor. 1 Timothy 2:5, "For there's one God and one mediator between man and God. The man Christ Jesus, not the pastor, the Lord Jesus Christ, is the mediator between men and God." Hebrews 4:14-16 says, "We have a great high priest, Jesus, the son of God. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need, so we go directly to the Lord Jesus Christ if we've sinned. We don't have to go to the pastor unless we sinned against the pastor. Again, Hebrews 10:19-22 says, "We have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus. Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith to the high priest." So again, let's draw near to Jesus Christ, the high priest. We don't have to draw near to the pastor. Psalm 32:5, I acknowledge my sin unto thee. So the psalmist says, "I went to God and I told God my sin. You don't have to go to the priest or the pastor to acknowledge your sin. I said, 'I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord." Notice to the Lord, not to any other person. Luke 18:13-14, the publican stood aar off, smote his breast, and say, "God, be merciful to me a sinner." He was the one that left forgiven. He didn't have to go to the priest there in the Jewish temple. He could go directly to God and be forgiven. In James 5:15-16, you have to take these verses in context. These verses never say you have to go to your pastor or a priest to confess. The Bible said, "The prayer of faith shall save the sick. If you have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him." Verse 16, "Confess your faults one to another and pray for one another." So if we take this in context with all the other verses I've just read, you only go confess your faults to another when you've sinned against that person. Any other time the sin is private and you've just sinned against the Lord. You just have to talk to the Lord. In closing, friends, I hope these questions and answers were a blessing by the grace of God. Please let me know if I missed anything or if I should add anything in the comments. We can talk about it down there in the comments by the grace of God. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ for sending his Holy Spirit to justify us, to sanctify us, to fill us with the Holy Ghost and we belong to him. I was even reading yesterday out of Matthew 25 in the parable of the great white throne judgment. The Bible even says that the foolish virgin like sheep were known and blessed by God and were known before the foundation of the world. So a person who is justified has a measure of the spirit of Christ. Those who are baptized with the Holy Ghost though they have a greater measure. They have it in the soul. And praise God that we can confess our sins directly to the Lord Jesus Christ. We don't have to go tell the pastor or the priest all of our sins unless we sinned against that person. Of course, for us, it'd be a pastor, not a priest. We can go directly to the high priest of heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ, who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity. He was tempted in all points like as we are. He can understand our trials. He can help us. He can forgive us. He can help us get back in the light. as he's in the light according to 1 John chapter 1. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. It never fails. [Music]
