[0:03] and that um that I am perfectly
[0:06] infallible that there's nothing and what
[0:09] was some of the awst
[0:12] causing a lot of confusion and uh this
[0:14] church knows that we don't stand for no
[0:16] such Tommy rod as that we believe in the
[0:19] Bible.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:22] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:25] this video is to expose preachers who
[0:28] exalt the tapes of William Brham to
[0:30] being equal with the Bible with the end
[0:33] goal that the listeners will learn to
[0:35] rightly divide the word of truth and
[0:37] keep themselves from the idolatry of
[0:40] worshiping William Brandham's tapes or
[0:42] William Brandom. A couple months ago, I
[0:44] watched a preacher from a youth meeting
[0:48] here in the United States and it was a
[0:50] good faithb buildinging message. And
[0:51] then I even watched the testimonies
[0:52] afterwards and there were a lot of great
[0:54] supernatural testimonies. But even
[0:56] amongst the testimonies, there were
[0:58] numerous false doctrines which I'll go
[0:59] through in this video here by the grace
[1:02] of God. So again, we see that the rain
[1:04] falls on the just and the unjust. Now,
[1:07] I'm not saying this preacher is unjust,
[1:09] but I'm showing how the Holy Ghost falls
[1:12] when people have simple faith in the
[1:14] simple truths of God's word and how God
[1:16] will overlook men's mistakes. Even when
[1:19] I preach and I'll make mistakes, yet God
[1:22] will come down and vindicate the word of
[1:24] God, certain truths that I preach. Not
[1:26] everything, of course, because no man is
[1:28] perfect. This just shows the grace of
[1:30] God to fallible human men that the
[1:33] infallible God would come down and
[1:35] vindicate certain truths and elements or
[1:38] aspects of the sermon. But of course,
[1:40] not every word of the sermon. That would
[1:42] only be the Lord Jesus Christ who every
[1:45] word of every sermon he ever preached
[1:47] was absolutely correct.
[1:49] So, by God's grace, we'll look at this
[1:51] lesson here and hope it's a good lesson
[1:53] that it will help message believers not
[1:55] to idolize the tapes of Brother
[1:58] Brandham, nor Brother Brandham himself.
[2:00] Remember friends, Brother Brandham said
[2:02] to make him infallible is one of the
[2:04] awfulst things you can do. He went on to
[2:06] say, "It's Tommy Rot in this quote from
[2:08] 1962."
[2:10] So, that's one reason why I'm making
[2:11] this video. It is so awful in the sight
[2:14] of God to exalt William Brandom and his
[2:16] tapes to being equal with the Bible.
[2:18] It's awful. It's the Antichrist spirit.
[2:21] It's idolatry and it needs to be called
[2:23] out by the grace of God. I want to make
[2:26] about five points here before I get into
[2:28] the exact quote from the preacher. Point
[2:31] number one is that we must criticize
[2:34] when criticism is due. Brother Bram said
[2:37] this in the spoken word original seed.
[2:39] He was criticizing mega churches that
[2:41] have millions and millions of dollars
[2:43] and were not spreading the gospel like
[2:45] they should. Brother Brandham said, 'I
[2:47] don't feel bad about criticizing. It's
[2:49] due criticism. I don't want to hurt
[2:52] nobody's feelings, but I'd rather hurt
[2:53] some man's feelings than hurt God's
[2:56] feeling. And that's what this video is
[2:58] all about as well. Preachers who worship
[3:01] the tapes should be criticized. They
[3:04] should be rebuked and called out. I
[3:06] won't call out the name of this
[3:07] preacher. Some people have asked me to
[3:09] give names, but friends, just be more
[3:12] careful when we listen to preachers not
[3:14] to believe every single word they say.
[3:17] When you listen to a sermon, be in
[3:19] communion with the Holy Ghost and ask
[3:21] the Holy Ghost to help you discern truth
[3:23] from air so you can accept the truth. So
[3:26] again, idolizing brother Ram's tapes is
[3:29] due criticism. It should be criticized.
[3:32] I have many videos where I've criticized
[3:33] the tape church movement, the
[3:36] Jeffersonville, Brandon Tabernacle tape
[3:38] worship movement, the press play and
[3:39] disobey movement. That needs criticized,
[3:43] that needs rebuked and more people ought
[3:46] to do that by the grace of God. Point
[3:48] number two, it's also a warning video.
[3:51] The Bible says in Colossians 1:28,
[3:53] we preach Christ warning every man,
[3:55] teaching every man in all wisdom. So
[3:57] this video is also a teaching video
[3:59] because we want to present every man
[4:00] perfect or mature in Christ Jesus. We
[4:04] must warn the idolattors. We must listen
[4:07] carefully to what preachers are saying
[4:09] and prove all things as 1 Thessalonians
[4:11] 5 says, "Take everything back to the
[4:13] word." Just like the Brians in Acts
[4:15] 17:11, they search the scriptures daily
[4:17] whether those things were. So we have to
[4:19] do that for brother Brandham. We have to
[4:20] do that for every preacher. And if you
[4:23] don't, you're probably a lazy Christian
[4:24] or just trying to lazily get through
[4:27] life, just get through the sermons
[4:29] without actually spending time with God
[4:31] and having a relationship with God.
[4:33] Point number three, we get the good
[4:35] lesson that evangelists in this case
[4:39] should not teach. An evangelist is not a
[4:41] teacher, just like a pastor is not a
[4:44] prophet. You don't hear me say thus
[4:46] sayith the Lord and give prophecies
[4:48] because I'm not a prophet. Now, I made a
[4:50] recent video where brother Brandham had
[4:52] all five gifts, all five preaching
[4:54] gifts, which is true. So, in the New
[4:56] Testament, you can have a preacher that
[4:57] has more than one gift, but as we'll see
[5:00] from the comments of the preacher on
[5:02] this video, he does not have the gift to
[5:04] teach. He shouldn't be teaching. He
[5:06] should just be evangelizing, which means
[5:08] declaring the truth of the word of God.
[5:10] And that seems to work for him with
[5:11] divine healing and miracles, which is
[5:13] great. That's wonderful. But he has no
[5:15] business teaching the word of God
[5:16] because of the idolatry that he's
[5:18] propagating whether he knows it or not.
[5:20] Brother Ram said in Taking sides with
[5:22] Jesus 1962, "A prophet isn't an
[5:25] evangelist. An evangelist isn't a
[5:28] prophet. A pastor isn't an evangelist.
[5:31] An evangelist isn't a pastor." And then
[5:33] he quotes Ephesians 4:11 about the
[5:36] five-fold preaching gifts. And again,
[5:39] friends, I understand like a pastor can
[5:40] be called out to do some evangelistic
[5:42] work. And I understand an evangelist
[5:44] could eventually be a pastor if God
[5:46] calls them into a different role. But in
[5:48] this case in particular, as you see,
[5:49] this evangelist should not be teaching
[5:53] because he can't rightly divide the word
[5:55] of God on certain simple topics. Point
[5:58] number four is just the point about the
[6:01] power of persuasion. I watched this
[6:04] service. It was a youth meeting here in
[6:06] the United States. And this preacher is
[6:08] so charismatic because of his charm, his
[6:11] passion, his enthusiasm. He causes the
[6:14] audience to believe him because of how
[6:16] he speaks rather than what he speaks.
[6:19] Because he's so good at talking, so
[6:21] emotional, sweating all the way through
[6:23] his shirt, shouting, praising God,
[6:25] dancing all around. The people get
[6:28] emotional and persuaded just because of
[6:30] his charisma. And they're not listening
[6:33] to what he's saying. They're just
[6:35] excited about how he's saying it. You
[6:38] know, the hundreds of youth and adults
[6:40] in attendance at this youth meeting are
[6:42] all jumping up shouting. Preachers are
[6:45] standing and shouting, punching at the
[6:47] air and agreeing with these false
[6:48] doctrines. They're agreeing with
[6:51] idolatry because of the emotional
[6:53] buildup and the power of persuasion. So,
[6:56] as preachers, we must be very careful
[6:59] not to work up people's emotions, but to
[7:01] point them to the word of God. And of
[7:03] course, the Holy Ghost brings emotion. I
[7:04] know the quotes on that. But this is a
[7:06] prime example of too much emotion which
[7:09] causes the people to accept everything
[7:12] the preacher is saying. To accept the
[7:14] idolatry of saying every word on tape is
[7:16] thus sayith the Lord. And friends,
[7:18] remember I got a video series with over
[7:20] 60 proofs that not every word on tape is
[7:22] thus sayith the Lord. I've kept adding
[7:25] to that amount and I have probably over
[7:27] a hundred by now simple proofs that not
[7:30] every word on tape is thus sayith the
[7:31] Lord. Anyone that says that is insane or
[7:35] deceived. Anyone that says every word on
[7:38] tape is thus say the Lord is foolish.
[7:41] They either have no discernment or
[7:42] they've neglected their discernment gift
[7:45] that it does not operate anymore. And
[7:47] they don't believe everything brother
[7:48] said because brother Bam said he's not
[7:50] infallible. So they're lying saying they
[7:52] believe everything when in reality they
[7:54] don't. And the fifth and final point is
[7:56] that tape worshippers, which could be
[7:59] tape boys or even preachers, as this
[8:01] video proves, they will do any kind of
[8:04] mental gymnastics to accept every quote
[8:07] as thus sayeth the Lord. Over the years,
[8:10] I've interacted in comments with people,
[8:13] and I'll just give two simple examples.
[8:15] The first example is the White Horse
[8:17] Rider. Some Jeffersonville people were
[8:19] telling me that the White Horse rider
[8:22] was both the Holy Ghost and the
[8:24] Antichrist. Brother Ram said it was the
[8:26] Antichrist spirit with thus sayith the
[8:28] Lord in 1963, but they were doing mental
[8:31] gymnastics to show that well somehow
[8:33] perhaps the White Horse Rider did start
[8:34] out as the Holy Spirit, but then he
[8:37] transitioned into the Antichrist.
[8:39] They're willing to do any mental
[8:40] gymnastics rather than accepting the
[8:43] quotes that brother Brandham said, "I'm
[8:44] not infallible and I would have been
[8:46] completely wrong about the first seal
[8:47] had it not been for the Holy Ghost that
[8:49] swept down into his room at about noon
[8:52] the day he preached the first seal." So,
[8:54] these tape worshippers are so deceived
[8:56] they'll do anything to try to prove
[8:58] their point. A second example is
[9:00] recently I was again interacting with a
[9:02] tape boy and I showed him the quote from
[9:05] 1956 love where brother Brandham said
[9:07] Jesus saved me from a death of sin and
[9:11] an eternity in hell. So brother Brandham
[9:14] said Jesus saved him from an eternity in
[9:17] hell. And I said, "Is this quote thus
[9:19] sayeth the Lord that Jesus saved brother
[9:21] Brandham from eternity in hell?" Because
[9:23] I said a year later in September 57,
[9:27] Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 part one,
[9:30] brother Brandham said, "Therefore, there
[9:33] cannot be an eternal hell. There's a
[9:35] hell, fire and brimstone. We know that,
[9:37] but there's no eternal hell."
[9:41] And this tape boy went through all this
[9:43] mental gymnastics of using def different
[9:45] definitions of eternal and everlasting
[9:48] to try to prove that the first quote was
[9:51] true that Jesus saved brother Brandham
[9:54] from an eternity in hell. Now why can't
[9:56] he just have enough logic and enough
[9:58] humility to say brother Bram grew in his
[10:00] revelation and his understanding? And
[10:02] the first quote was not thus sayith the
[10:03] Lord. Jesus didn't save anybody from an
[10:05] eternity in hell because there is no
[10:08] hell that lasts eternally. Jesus saved
[10:11] many believers from hell but not an
[10:13] eternal hell. So friends, this is the
[10:15] sad state many tape boys are in. All
[10:18] those tape girls, the male and females
[10:20] and the Jeffersonville movement and now
[10:22] all these preachers. And again, this
[10:25] group that I listen to, they're called
[10:26] the open book group. And they're the
[10:28] ones that call themselves the greatest
[10:30] of all time. Brother Brandham told us
[10:32] not to ever do that, not to call each
[10:34] other great. And yet these preachers
[10:36] keep doing it. So that will be between
[10:38] them and God. But we know this one fact.
[10:40] Pride goes before the fall. We should
[10:42] never call ourselves great. We do not
[10:45] want to get anointed with the pride of
[10:48] life. We want to keep humbling ourselves
[10:50] rather than exalting ourselves. Okay. By
[10:53] God's grace, let's get into these four
[10:55] false teachings here. So, in this youth
[10:58] meeting from a couple months ago, the
[11:00] first false teaching was the worst in my
[11:02] opinion. It was the idolatry of
[11:05] worshiping every word on Brother Ram's
[11:07] tapes. I'll give the quote here. The
[11:09] quote says, quote, "When you confess the
[11:12] word of God, you can't say,"Well, this
[11:14] is what Brother Random said, but let me
[11:16] tell you what I think." That's a coward.
[11:19] But a bold person is one that can just
[11:21] read it and say it and stand behind it,
[11:24] and I stand behind every quote from 47
[11:27] to 65, from Genesis to Revelation,
[11:30] because we know what we're talking
[11:31] about." End quote. So, the preacher was
[11:34] preaching about what boldness is. He
[11:36] gave a definition from the Greek lexicon
[11:39] and he said the people should be so bold
[11:42] that they stand behind every word from
[11:45] 47 to 65. I'm sorry that is idolatry
[11:49] because he says just like standing
[11:51] behind every word from Genesis to
[11:53] Revelation. That is complete total
[11:55] idolatry. And again hundreds of young
[11:57] people are jumping up and shouting in
[12:00] this open book revival youth meeting.
[12:03] Preachers are standing up, punching the
[12:04] air, shouting. I got the video of it.
[12:07] They're worshiping tapes and happy about
[12:10] it and shouting about it and rejoicing
[12:12] about it. And this proves this brother
[12:14] is not a teacher. If he was a teacher,
[12:16] he would take all the scriptures back to
[12:18] the book of Acts where it really talked
[12:20] about boldness about being filled with
[12:22] the Holy Ghost and searching the
[12:24] scriptures daily whether these things
[12:25] were so. Now, I'll continue on with this
[12:28] quote. Quote, "We're not a bunch of
[12:30] idiots. We're not a bunch of educated
[12:32] idiots." I know there's a lot of stuff
[12:34] that pops up on YouTube, but you've got
[12:36] tapes. Get back in them. I don't care
[12:38] what a polished up hierling. I'm sorry.
[12:41] I'm done playing with these devils. I
[12:43] don't care how fancy. I'm not looking
[12:45] for a PowerPoint. Stay with what's on
[12:47] the tapes. There is no confusion.
[12:49] There's no misunderstanding. It's the
[12:51] sealed book sayings unsealed. If he's
[12:54] saying what's on the tapes, he's an
[12:56] Einstein in my book. End quote.
[12:58] So again, the preacher exalts any
[13:00] preacher that will say every word on
[13:02] tape is thus sayith the Lord to an
[13:05] Einstein. And that's completely wrong.
[13:07] He's not an Einstein. He's an idoltor.
[13:10] Of course, he attacks YouTube preachers,
[13:12] which this brother came at me a couple
[13:14] years ago when I put out the interracial
[13:16] marriage video, and he just attacked me
[13:18] with three quotes. I replied, I kept the
[13:20] replies, but then he deleted all of his
[13:22] comments. So really, who was the coward?
[13:25] It was this brother who was the coward.
[13:27] So, I do have a little history with his
[13:28] brother. I met him face to face. So, he
[13:30] says, "We believe every word from 47 to
[13:33] 65, like Genesis to Revelation, and
[13:35] we're not idiots." And I'm not name
[13:37] calling friends, but this man is
[13:38] deceived. And also, years ago, this
[13:41] man's wife before they got married was
[13:43] posting on I think Instagram maybe, I
[13:46] don't know. And her screenshot said,
[13:48] "Just say amen to every word of the
[13:50] message. Don't doubt or question it.
[13:52] It's that simple. I thank God for
[13:54] choosing me to see the light of this
[13:56] day. Again, this is a complete
[13:58] idolization of William Brandham's tapes.
[14:00] This is total tape worship. You cannot
[14:03] say amen to every word of the message if
[14:06] you're talking about every quote from
[14:07] William Brandham. If you do, then hell
[14:10] is eternal. If you do, then the white
[14:12] horse rider is the Holy Spirit and the
[14:14] antichrist spirit at the same time. If
[14:16] you do, then the entire world was blown
[14:18] up with just craters and things and tree
[14:20] stumps left by 1977. Friends, any honest
[14:24] person would admit that the tapes are
[14:26] not infallible. Yes, there are
[14:28] infallible statements with thus sayith
[14:29] the Lord on the tapes, but not every
[14:31] word on tape is thus sayith the Lord.
[14:34] So, this tape worship runs in the
[14:36] family. Husband and wife both worship
[14:38] the tapes. And then he's basically
[14:40] saying that only a devil would say you
[14:43] can't stand behind every word from 47 to
[14:46] 65. So, he's calling people like me
[14:48] devils. He's calling anyone that uses
[14:51] any type of discernment devils. So
[14:54] friends, this is a very dangerous place
[14:56] to be in. May God have mercy on this
[14:58] man. And yet hundreds of youth, hundreds
[15:02] of adults, and dozens of preachers up
[15:04] front will all shout, punch the air, and
[15:07] agree with this. It's so sad. Now, the
[15:10] second false teaching was God's not in
[15:12] heaven. The preacher is preaching. And
[15:15] here's the exact quote. Quote, "Deity is
[15:17] not in heaven. deity is in this city
[15:20] state in a youth camp tonight in the
[15:23] redeemed flesh of the new generation of
[15:25] the open book and they've got a word
[15:28] confession end quote now friends there
[15:31] are two quotes where brother Ram says
[15:32] deity is not in heaven but he never
[15:35] majored on it and he never said thus
[15:36] sayith the Lord think about that friends
[15:39] how could deity not be in heaven that
[15:41] means when we pray our prayers don't go
[15:43] to heaven yet the Bible says our prayers
[15:45] are collected in vials in heaven and
[15:47] will be poured out. This proves this
[15:49] evangelist should not teach the word of
[15:51] God. This evangelist never studied this
[15:54] topic out very well at all. In 1964,
[15:58] brother Ram said, "Tonight to look to
[16:00] the temple where Jesus stands at the
[16:01] right hand of the majesty with his own
[16:03] blood, the voice of the sign." So,
[16:06] Brother Ram says, "Of course, Jesus
[16:09] Christ tonight in 64 sits at the right
[16:13] hand of the majesty on high in heaven."
[16:16] There's many quotes like this of course
[16:17] throughout the entire message. So this
[16:19] evangelist is contradicting other quotes
[16:21] from brother Brandham. So this false
[16:23] teaching of God's not in heaven. It
[16:25] breaks the word of God. You can't teach
[16:27] that through the Bible. Yes, I know the
[16:29] mighty angel came down in Revelation 10,
[16:31] but he must have gone back up because
[16:33] brother Ram said that even after the
[16:35] seal's revealed in March of 63 there in
[16:38] 64, he says he's back in heaven or he's
[16:41] in heaven seated at the right hand of
[16:43] the majesty on high. So this evangelist
[16:45] should not teach the word of God. He
[16:48] should just evangelize and declare
[16:50] truths about divine healing, salvation,
[16:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the
[16:55] Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter 5,
[16:57] to be absent from the body is to be
[16:59] present with the Lord. Well, that
[17:01] preacher just broke that scripture. How
[17:03] can they be present with the Lord if
[17:04] deity is not in heaven? So this preacher
[17:07] doesn't think thoughts out all the way
[17:10] because he's not a teacher. He just
[17:12] looks at things in a very shallow
[17:13] manner. He just looks at a quote. Why I
[17:15] believe it? I idolize every quote on
[17:17] tape. It must be right. And I'll just
[17:19] keep preaching it. I've heard this
[17:20] preacher use this quote year after year.
[17:23] The third false doctrine actually didn't
[17:25] come from this sermon, but it's an older
[17:26] one. And the evangelist said, Brother
[17:30] Random had vindicated opinions and he
[17:33] was relating it to wearing men's shorts.
[17:35] Yet in 1965, Brother Ram said, "My
[17:38] opinion is just like anybody else's." So
[17:40] this preacher is exalting every opinion
[17:43] of brother Brandham to being divine,
[17:46] which is a false doctrine. Of course,
[17:48] he's worshiping every word on tape. And
[17:50] he doesn't understand that an opinion is
[17:52] a view or judgment not necessarily based
[17:55] on fact or knowledge. So God doesn't
[17:58] vindicate opinions. God doesn't
[18:00] vindicate man's ideas that are not based
[18:02] upon facts or knowledge. God only
[18:04] vindicates his word. God does give us
[18:07] liberty of the spirit, freedom of the
[18:09] spirit, but God does not have any
[18:11] opinions. Everything God says is based
[18:14] upon fact and knowledge because he's the
[18:17] author and finisher of our faith. He's
[18:20] the fountain of all goodness, wisdom,
[18:23] knowledge, understanding, power, love,
[18:25] grace, mercy. But this preacher doesn't
[18:27] know that the fact that men should not
[18:30] wear shorts is not an opinion. That's a
[18:32] Bible teaching from Isaiah 47 where the
[18:35] Bible says in verses 1 through3 that the
[18:37] thighs are nakedness. So again, this
[18:39] evangelist is not a teacher. He doesn't
[18:41] know the definition of the word opinion
[18:44] and is leaving out quotes from brother
[18:45] Brandham like the marriage and divorce
[18:46] quote 65 where he says, "My opinion is
[18:49] just like anybody else's opinion." If we
[18:51] have a modesty teaching such as men
[18:53] should not wear shorts and women should
[18:54] not expose the thigh, there's got to be
[18:56] a Bible foundation for it. And if he was
[18:58] a teacher, he would find that and
[19:00] realize it's not an opinion. It's a
[19:02] Bible teaching on modesty from Isaiah
[19:04] 47. So again, very sad this brother
[19:07] tries to teach, but he's not called to
[19:08] be a teacher. And the fourth and final
[19:11] false statement from this preacher was a
[19:13] prideful statement. I'll read the quote
[19:15] and then explain it here. By God's
[19:18] grace, the preacher is reading from the
[19:19] church age book. Quote, "The word has
[19:21] never failed in the mouth of believing
[19:23] Christians and in this last age. It is
[19:25] here stronger. It is here stronger.
[19:28] Don't get mad at me. It is here stronger
[19:30] in your mouth tonight than Hattie
[19:32] writes. Is that okay? Is it here
[19:35] stronger tonight than in Banks Woods?
[19:37] You know what's pushing against that
[19:39] right now? Is that devil that's fixing
[19:41] to fall at your feet? But go ahead and
[19:43] say, "Amen, end time generation. That
[19:45] ain't nothing but the truth. It's
[19:47] greater in me than any generation before
[19:49] me." End quote.
[19:52] Now friends, this preacher is
[19:54] misapplying this quote or brother Ram's
[19:56] talking about his day in his ministry.
[19:59] In brother Ram's ministry, the word in
[20:01] his mouth was greater than previous
[20:04] generations such as Luther, Wesley, and
[20:06] Isuza. But that's because he had a
[20:08] prophetic son of man ministry. His gift
[20:11] was greater. So therefore, the spoken
[20:12] word was greater. But brother Ram's not
[20:15] saying that every single Christian will
[20:16] have a greater spoken word power now
[20:19] here in 2025 than back in 1965.
[20:23] Brother Ram did not say that the
[20:25] generation after his generation would be
[20:27] greater than brother Ram's generation
[20:29] and have the spoken word in a greater
[20:31] way. And also this quote by brother Ram
[20:33] in the church age book was not thus
[20:34] sayith the Lord. So we can't make it
[20:36] thus sayith the Lord. Now, we know
[20:37] brother Ram talked about the third pole
[20:39] being used in a great way at this time
[20:41] of the squeeze, which we're hoping for
[20:43] that. We're praying for that. But that's
[20:45] not even thus sayith the Lord. There's
[20:46] no thus sayith the Lord statement in
[20:48] that. So, this brother lacks balance. He
[20:50] lacks any teaching on this topic. And
[20:53] friends, notice he just exalted this
[20:55] generation above Hadtie Wright and Banks
[20:58] Woods. Hadty Wright, of course, believed
[21:00] for her children's salvation and God
[21:02] gave it to her. Banks Woods I believe
[21:04] saw the dead fish come back to life if
[21:06] I'm not mistaken. I could be mistaken on
[21:08] that. Now remember Hadtie was the third
[21:11] out of five third pole testimonies in
[21:14] Look Away to Jesus 1963. The first was
[21:17] brother Ram speaking to Sunny Shimp. The
[21:19] second was the squirrels brother Ram
[21:21] spoke. The third was Hadty Wright. The
[21:23] fourth was the Colorado blizzard when
[21:25] brother Ram spoke to the blizzard. And
[21:26] fifth was Mida's miracle. So this
[21:29] evangelist in a youth meeting just
[21:31] exalts all this generation above those
[21:35] third pole examples. And he's really
[21:36] exalting this generation above brother
[21:38] Brandham because brother Brandham was
[21:41] involved with Hadti Wright's third pole
[21:44] experience. Friends, how often are these
[21:47] youth in the youth camp raising the
[21:49] paralyzed like in Acts chapter 3? How
[21:53] often are people getting healed by the
[21:55] sick being in their shadows? Like in
[21:56] Acts 5:15,
[21:59] like brother Ram said, I never want to
[22:00] get in the way of anyone's faith. But
[22:02] let's have discernment to see if this
[22:04] evangelist is interpreting this quote
[22:06] the right way. So this is a very
[22:08] prideful statement. The word is greater
[22:11] in you than it was in Hattie Wright and
[22:13] Banks Woods. Well, that also must mean
[22:15] it's greater than it was in Brother
[22:16] Brandham's mouth. again, exalting this
[22:19] current generation higher than everybody
[22:22] else. And that's what I showed in my
[22:24] bride pride video from a couple years
[22:25] ago. Seasoned message ministers will
[22:28] walk into youth meetings and say,
[22:29] "You're the greatest youth of all time."
[22:32] Seasoned ministers will say, "Today's
[22:35] mothers are the greatest mothers of all
[22:37] time. What about Susanna Wesley? What
[22:39] about Sister Ma? What about Jockabed?"
[22:42] And yet, the people will swallow it
[22:44] down. They'll shout. They'll jump.
[22:46] They'll say, "Amen." not even discerning
[22:48] what's being said. So, in closing,
[22:51] friends, I hope this video was a
[22:53] blessing by the grace of God that you'll
[22:55] listen closely to what preachers are
[22:57] saying, especially the preachers who are
[23:00] extremely popular. And I'm happy for
[23:03] every preacher that God moves through
[23:05] their ministry like this evangelist. I'm
[23:07] happy for him in one way, but I'm very
[23:09] sad in another way because mixed in with
[23:11] his truth about faith and healing and
[23:13] the Holy Ghost and miracles is idolatry.
[23:17] And people just swallow it down, think
[23:20] it's right, they just accept it because
[23:21] they're caught up in the emotional
[23:23] moment. So there's the idolatry mixed
[23:25] in, there's the pride mixed in, there's
[23:28] the name calling mixed in. He name calls
[23:30] and calls people devils who don't
[23:32] believe every word on tape. So as the
[23:34] Bible said, let's speak the truth in
[23:36] love. This video is made in love. Love
[23:38] is corrective. I didn't call the
[23:40] brother's name. I'm not trying to defame
[23:41] him or anything. But when I see videos
[23:43] like this of people worshiping the
[23:45] tapes, it does fire me up. I feel the
[23:47] zeal of the Lord to stand for the truth
[23:50] of God and call out these lies to call
[23:52] out this idolatry. Just like the days of
[23:54] Hezekiah I read this morning, Hezekiah
[23:56] became king. He cleaned out the house of
[23:57] God. He destroyed all the idols, stomped
[24:01] them, took them and threw them in the
[24:03] waters to wash it all away. Friends,
[24:06] it's idolatry to worship the tapes of
[24:08] brother Brandham and make them equal to
[24:09] the Bible. The tapes of William Brham
[24:11] are not equal to the Bible. If that's
[24:13] the case, then we now have more books
[24:15] added on to the Bible. But as brother
[24:17] Brandham said, and the Bible says, you
[24:19] can't add one word to the Bible, nor
[24:21] take one word away from the Bible. I
[24:23] pray friends, you'll take heed from this
[24:25] video, take warning from this video to
[24:27] rightly divide the word of truth. I keep
[24:30] praying for these preachers. I'll keep
[24:32] doing that by the grace of God. And may
[24:34] we worship Jesus only. May we know that
[24:36] only one person is infallible. Only one
[24:40] book is infallible from Genesis to
[24:42] Revelation. That's the Bible. Let's be
[24:44] satisfied with that by the grace of God.
[24:47] If you have any questions, concerns, or
[24:49] testimonies about this video, please
[24:50] contact me.
[24:52] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[24:54] the desire of your heart.
[24:58] I'm
[24:58] &gt;&gt; very happy to be here this afternoon and
[25:00] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[25:02] Christ.
[25:03] to bring the good tidings, the good news
[25:06] that Jesus raised from the dead, living
[25:08] among man today, his church. The same
[25:11] Jesus that was yesterday will be today
[25:14] and forever.
[25:16] He has never failed.
