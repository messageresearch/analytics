TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the name above all names the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to help christian brothers and some christian sisters overcome pornography and the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh of course i've always known the need for this video but i was waiting for inspiration and the timing of god by his grace this subject has been requested numerous times over the years and so recently i felt very burdened to study on this i've devoted numerous hours to studying this subject and i hope this video is a help to many by the grace of god here's the outline for the video first we'll look at the battle against sexual sin and the lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh second we'll look at 11 warnings about sexual sin from the bible third we'll look at bible verses to use for victory over sexual sin fourth i'll share my testimony overcoming sexual sin and lastly we'll answer a viewer's question about how brother branham watched the movie the river of no return and how it relates to this subject the battle against sexual sin and the lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh beginning in 1st john 2 verses 15-17 john teaches all sins come through three channels the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life the word lust means longing desire for something forbidden so we know both our eyes and flesh or bodies have lusts longings or desires that are forbidden by god it's important to note that pride of life often works with these other two channels since pride means self-confidence and is the opposite of humility humility is having no self-interest a humble person is only interested in the things of god but a prideful person is confident in their own ability and interested in his own lusts and often rebels against god's commands and gives in to pornography or adultery fornication or other sexual sins a true christian recognizes the channels that he or she is being tempted in and overcomes the temptations concerning sexual temptation satan will often use the lust of the eyes to begin enticing a christian the human mind is the battlefield we must fight in and there are five inlets to the human mind as you can see on this visual conscience memory reason affection and imagination regarding his sexual temptations satan often uses a visual sexual image to tempt the lust of the eyes and then he moves to the inlet of imagination tempting a christian with a sexual fantasy or satan could use the inlet of memory bringing a past sexual sin to the christian's memory tempting the believer to remember that and perhaps repeat it no matter the inlet the christian has access to the word of god in his or her mind and the word of god will defeat satan anytime anyplace anywhere [Applause] next in james chapter 1 verses 12 through 15 we're told we're blessed to endure temptation or persevere in the greek through and overcome temptations god himself does not tempt us with evil and verses 14 and 15 then show the four-step process that ultimately leads to death or separation from god which is step one enticed which means entrapped or lord step two lust conceived which means seized arrested or captured step three is sin or committing the actual offense and step four is death or separation the four-step process is clearly seen the garden of eden in genesis chapter 3 through eve the first female the bible is clear that all corruption came into the world through lust or a forbidden longing or craving or desire second peter 1 verse 4 says that i'll read the second half of the verse that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust with a true understanding of the holy ghost eve fell in this four-step process by the following first she was enticed or allured by the conversation with and questioning of the serpent second her lust conceived in her mind when she was captured by the possibilities of eating the forbidden fruit and then decided to partake third she literally committed the sin or offense by eating of the fruit which was the act of adultery according to proverbs 30 verse 20 and of course the context of genesis chapter 3. but first proverbs 30 verse 20 says such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness the context also proves the fruit was adultery because right after the fruit is eaten in verse 15 god says there are now two sets of offspring or two sets of children so we know adam and eve did not eat physical apples the fruit they partook of was a fruit of unbelief which was adultery remember friends i have a couple of videos about the serpent seed doctrine that god actually instituted in genesis 3 15. that'd be a great help to you if this teaching is new to you it will really help you understand the original sin and also the reason why jesus christ had to come by a virgin birth fourth then death began to set in in eve's body and mind the holy anointing left she and adam notice also that both eve and adam physically separated themselves from the presence of god shortly after sinning adam and eve eventually died in the natural as a result of their sin now applying this four-step process to our lives we should desire to overcome all temptation in the first stage when we are enticed we must not let lust be conceived we must not be captured by the lustful thought and decide to act upon it in our minds sexual temptation and or pornography is such a difficult battle because adultery was the first physical sin committed between even the serpent it remains a major battle throughout human history even to the end as jesus prophesied he would return at a time when the days resembled the days of noah and lot according to luke 17 verses 26 through 30. in noah's day sons of god were marrying wicked women based solely upon their physical beauty according to genesis 6 verse in lots day homosexuality was so prevalent that mobs of sodomites roamed the city and took victims by physical force apparently undeterred by any law enforcement in the city of sodom now the opposite of the four-step process of death is god's four-step process to life which is step one the way step two the truth step three the life and step four eternal life now of course we get this four-step process from john 14 verse 6 where jesus sayeth unto them i am the way the truth and the life no man comes in the father but by me when tempted a christian must choose the right way to escape satan's trap first corinthians 10 verses 13 and 14 beautifully explained this saying god always makes a way of escape in every single temptation and every person has been tempted in a similar fashion so that there are no excuses on judgment day and then verse 14 says my dearly beloved flee from idolatry so the way out of temptation is to flee the temptation and choose the next step the truth of god's word satan tries to convince the believer that the fleshly pleasures are more important than god's holiness but satan is a liar in john 17 verse 17 jesus says thy word is truth so first flee the temptation second believe the truth which is deciding to do the truth and then the third step is life or obedience in that particular moment choosing this life or obedience on a regular basis ultimately leads to eternal life with jesus christ our lord which is the fourth step the war against the soul if a christian gives into sexual sin after being entrapped and having lust conceived he must repent and get victory the next time the enemy comes to tempt him if not the christian becomes addicted or enslaved to this sexual sin creating a war against his soul as peter teaches in first peter 2 verse 11 dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul in this war between the flesh mind and the soul a christian will begin to wonder if he is even saved because he is so enslaved to sexual sin peter again wrote about this in second peter chapter 1 verse 9 saying that if a christian does not keep the anointing of the holy ghost upon him which is manifesting faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godless and brotherly kindness he can forget he was purged of his sins and begin doubting his salvation second peter 1 verse 9 says but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins so as peter says the christian must realize he has to war against his fleshly desires and sinful sexual thoughts in his mind the spoiled house from matthew chapter 12 when a christian man or woman opens themselves up to sexual sin or pornography they have let the devil come into their mind and the devil spoils the good things in their mind as jesus taught in matthew 12 verses 24 through 29 and 43-45 jesus taught a beautiful analogy about how to become free from demonic influence in this case of this video how to be free from sexual addictions like pornography recall that man is a three-part being as seen in this visual according to matthew 12 verses 24-29 sexual addiction starts when a believer lets a sinful sexual thought enter his house or his mind as taught earlier this means satan has accomplished the first three steps of the four-step process of death enticed lust conceived and sin now the strong man of the house or faith or he could call it the anointing of the holy ghost has been bound or grieved as paul said in ephesians 4 30 when he said grieve not the holy spirit of god the believers joy strength victory and faith has been bound up the strength of the lord is hindered or paralyzed in the believer's mind matthew 12 29 says or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house the way to regain control of the house is repentance from sexual sin repentance has a three-fold application in the greek it means to first hate the sin second change your thinking and third make amends for your sin in thorough repentance as brother branham calls it the sexual thoughts are cast out of the believer's mind the strong man or anointing of faith is now back in control of the house or mind a truly repentant christian will hate their addiction to sexual sin then they will change their thinking about it and no longer meditate on it and then make amends for it which might mean getting rid of the internet on his or her phone or the internet in their home or stop going to certain physical places like movie theaters or other wicked places that have sexual sin once having truly repented and and being free from sexual addiction jesus tells us the sexual demons that were cast out will leave for a while but plan to return with a greater sexual temptation notice that jesus said seven other sexual demons will come back to tempt and if that man's house or mind isn't filled with the holy ghost the devils will retake control of the man's mind and he'll become a worse sexual addict than he was before friend if you cannot resist sexual sin or pornography then you are not in charge of your house your strong man is bound your faith is paralyzed the way to clean out your house is to confess your sins and expose the enemy drive him out with the word of god fill your mind with the word of god and get victory for just one day and then when the enemy comes back the next day you will not let him in as long as you're filling your mind with the powerful word of god i believe this transformation is best done the first thing in the morning as jesus said to seek first the kingdom of god in matthew 6 33 christ also modeled this truth in mark chapter 1 verses 34 and 35 as immediately after holding a massive healing campaign of miracles he woke up a great while before day to go pray alone this is true humility jesus modeled how to overcome every temptation private prayer and if the sinless spotless son of god had to rise early to pray every day even after a miraculous campaign how much more do we need to do this jesus christ showed us how to win the daily battle against temptation whether it's sexual or not 11 bible warnings about sexual sin the first warning is looking at sexual sins will torment or haunt you every day sex addicts will have a life of torment the example is lot in sodom 2nd peter 2 verses 7 and 8 tell us that la was vexed or tormented with a filthy conversation of the wicked because in seeing and hearing what the sodomites were doing they vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds the sad part is lot put himself in this awful position so learn from lot and stop putting yourself in these situations choose to live a life of freedom instead of a life of bondage to satan remember satan wants to weaken you according to isaiah 14 verse 12 and kill steal and destroy you john 10 verse 10 but you're not called to love and serve satan you're called to be strengthened day by day loving jesus christ with all your heart soul mind and strength the second warning is your eyes will never be satisfied with pornography pornography is an unending death trap proverbs 27 20 tells us this hell and destruction are never full so the eyes of man are never satisfied the lust of the eyes is never satisfied no amount of porn will ever be enough to satisfy the fleshly lusts the sooner you recognize that the sooner you'll only use your eyes to look at holy things godly things things that please the lord jesus christ the third warning is that lust and the spirit of fear being found out will do anything to keep itself secret causing you to hurt those you love the most for example david had uriah killed to hide his adultery this is why you must confess your sins to jesus and perhaps some people will need an accountability partner at least at first when trying to overcome sexual sin but it must be somebody trustworthy that will keep these things in confidence the fourth warning is that satan is hunting you down with sexual temptations as his bait using sexual words sexual outfits facial makeup and more friend you must be ready to fight him off with the commandments of god this is found in proverbs 6 verses 23 through 26 for the commandment is a lamp and the law's light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman lust not after her beauty and thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids for by means of a horse woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adulteress will hunt for his precious life so there we see how satan anoints women or men to hunt after believers in order to try to deceive them and get them to fall into sexual sin that reminds us of how satan is as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour the fifth warning is that if you do not overcome sexual lusts it will destroy your soul and you could be lost you can lose the anointing of god as jesus said because you can believe for a while but then forfeit that belief or that anointing through transgression as judas iscariot did luke 8 13 records jesus saying you can believe for a while he said which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away proverbs 6 32 says but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul so friend if you're not already convinced pornography is not worth losing your soul over it's a degrading shameful wicked addiction steals all your christian anointing so choose life choose eternal life through jesus christ our lord the sixth warning is for men to know that you are programmed to reproduce and desire sexual relations so you must recognize that this is the battle you have been called to fight and win we see men programmed to be visually stimulated and programmed with the desire to reproduce in numerous scriptures such as paul in 1st corinthians 7 9 saying for it's better to marry than to burn that means to burn with fire so sexual desire is like a fire in many men also in exodus 19 verse 15 the bible said be ready against the third day come not at your wives so notice it's the man coming or pursuing the wife for sexual relations he's driven to that also jesus only mentioned men lusting in their minds in matthew 5 28 but of course we know some sisters may battle that but he said whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart and then job said he made a covenant to not look upon maids in job 31 verse 1. so brothers you must be ready to fight and put on the armor of god you have to approach each day knowing you're going to be tempted that lustful desire or craving is going to pass over you or pass through your flesh as brother brahm said something passes over men when they see a sexual temptation so we have to resist that feeling if we give into it then we've got to repent quickly so it's not if we'll be tempted but when and for some it's a daily battle sometimes all throughout the day here's a quote where brother brown said a healthy man is something pass over him every time he sees a sexy woman let's listen to the all stripped down quotes don't care who the man is if he's a healthy normal man when he looks at the woman he's bound to have something to pass over him i'd just be honest i don't care i've had the holy ghost for years you can't look at a woman her head dressed i i carry a little cross in my heart many of you seen it somebody said to me are you a catholic before did the catholics ever get optioned on the cross the cross means christian my friends i don't know the physiology of this but i know it's a reality brothers i know and myself i feel that temptation pass over me so i've got to cast down those feelings and get my mind on things that are holy and things that please the lord jesus christ also brothers it's likely this is going to be a battle you'll have to fight for life at 50 years old brother brahm still talked about the need for the cross hanging in his car let's listen to the quote the other day friday wife and i was going to the store i don't mean to harp on this but as we went down the street i just kept turning ahead one way for the other naked women i promised god when i was a blind man if he'd healed my eyes i'd look at the thing was right i keep a little cross hanging in my car when i see such as that i look at the cross and say oh god that's my refuge as i looked at the cross on a personal note i was also told by my mother that before her father passed away who was my grandfather he was in the nursing home and even there as a man in his mid-80s he was still tempted to look at the nurses because of their beauty and he had to fight against that and overcome that by the grace of god so these are sobering things and our brothers must remember this is a daily battle so we must have daily prayer and victory through that daily prayer the seventh warning is that you're going to sin every day so be quick to repent numerous scriptures point to the fact that we sin every day first john 1 verse 10 if we say we've not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us first corinthians 15 31 paul says i die daily matthew 6 verse 11 and 12 give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors now some days you might sin by lying complaining or lusting jesus said if you've thought about sexual sin you've already committed it in your heart so confess right away don't make it an addiction each day we're guilty of some type of sin like every other person on the face of the earth so just humble yourself and repent remember jesus said unjustified anger against the brother is the same as murder and that person is in danger of the hell fire so we realize we're going to battle sin every day we'll sin at least once a day so no matter what the sin is let's confess it right away and get our garments clean and white through the blood of jesus christ the eighth warning is that there will be consequences to sexual sin again looking at david he lost numerous family members due to his adultery with bathsheba and the murder of uriah look at solomon especially as his wives turned his heart away from god and god became angry with him and fought against him so depending upon the degree of your sexual sin there will be different degrees of consequences you've got to humble yourself deal with those consequences and express christian character through those consequences and that will humble you and make you a better servant to the lord jesus christ and then next time you'll overcome that sexual temptation the ninth warning is that we're warned not to live in fantasy or fiction stories we find this in first timothy four verse seven the bible said refuse profanin and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness so we must not live in fantasy this also applies to video games and sexual fantasies and fiction books paul specifically said to avoid fables or fiction stories which means men should avoid wasting their precious time on fictional things we must redeem the time paul says because the days are evil and that's in ephesians 5 verses 15 through 17. the tenth warning is that we're warned to not rob our spouses of sexual satisfaction by paul in first corinthians 7 verses 2 through 5. paul said defraud ye not one the other and defraud means to rob in this text paul says the body of the husband belongs to the wife and vice versa so when one spouse has sexual desires the other spouse should meet those desires of course everything in the marriage bed should be wholly agreed upon as brother brahms said let's listen to the quote you just be a husband be a sweetheart respect her like you always respect her don't pay attention non-sexy books and are these nonsense in this sexy books and things that you read about and all this stuff and everything like that get that filthy stuff out of your mind the bible said not let one dirty conversation come among you be real real nice and respect one other business and your your family relations and so forth like that let it be just as reverently godly and agreed with among you and everything as it can be don't never push and shove and and be dirty and vulgar understand talk to your wife if one nature's to you and should know the nature of her talking with her you you try to do the same thing to him sister in the same way understand one another and be be real christian gentlemen real christian ladies also here's another quote from brother branham where he told a saved woman to continue having sexual relations with her unbelieving husband because if she didn't it would drive him further away from god let's listen to the quote should a save wife refuse herself to her husband if he is a sinner no sir no sir that's your husband you're driving farther away from god than ever by doing that see that's right brother sister you married him he's yours you're his and the 11th warning is your body is not your own it was purchased by the precious blood of jesus christ and you will answer for the deeds done in your body this is found in first corinthians 6 verses 18 through 20. second corinthians chapter 5 verses 10 and 11 and first peter 1 verses 18 and 19. when you have the biblical perspective that your body is not your own and that it's a temple of the holy ghost it's much easier to turn down pornography or any sexual temptations because you realize your body is god's temple bible verses for victory over sexual sin the first verse is first corinthians 10 verse 13. here we learn god always has a way of escape and you can overcome every temptation friend to overcome sexual temptation you just have to begin looking for ways out god won't allow you to be tested above that you are able to overcome the second truth we gain from the scripture is you're not alone even if you are high passioned all men and women have faced sexual temptations and every believer has overcome and so can you temptation is common to all men as brother branham said some men might be more high passion than others some men are women but if that's you then take courage god trusts you that you'll overcome that passion for he allowed you to have it and he will use your overcoming testimony on the day of judgment against men and women who were high passion but made excuses and chose to feed the flesh or feed the black dog rather than starving it and feeding the white dog or the divine nature then brother branham said men go to sexual lusts to find comfort but then he thanked god saying we still have christ to go to for comfort praise the lord let's listen to the quote from he cares do you care and maybe a man's born high passionate he sees these modern stripteases on the street and he is constantly in trouble see he uh that the man is born like that night and now we find all those things is because people are trying to find comfort they're trying to find something that they and remember your comfort is your religion and you make those things your religion see just let me ask you something you can't believe nothing hardly but the bible we still have christ thanks to god recognize if you are high passion and then have a plan do what jesus did early morning prayer and remember you can also get rid of your cell phone or internet service get a flip phone that has internet but not websites and images also start a ministry to fill your time and if you feel that get an accountability partner you are more than able to overcome the third bible truth is that we have greater power and better promises than old testament saints this is seen in the book of hebrews and also john 7 verses 37 through 39 because the holy ghost in power cannot be given until after jesus died and was glorified friends even think about the old testament saints if joseph and job could overcome sexual temptation in the old testament under the blood of bulls and goats we can surely overcome it under the new testament and the precious blood of jesus christ remember joseph overcame daily sexual advances of potiphar's wife so you can surely overcome the daily advances you see on the cell phone or billboards joseph didn't even have the baptism of the holy ghost so it's clear each one of us need the baptism of the holy ghost and true justification and true sanctification the fourth scripture is psalms 101 verse 3 and we learn train yourself to set only holy things before your eyes as the holy ghost taught david saying i will set no wicked thing before my eyes it's a training so it's going to take victory one day and you got to take that same victory build on it and do it the next day but you can train your eyes to do that by god's grace fifth remember you can do all things through christ through his word and his anointing because with god all things are possible we find these scriptures in philippians 4 verses 12 and 13 and mark 10 verses 26 and 27. paul could overcome physical hunger and physical suffering through the strength of jesus christ then surely you and i can overcome our spiritual needs when we're in need of strength to overcome sexual temptations and we'll do that through receiving the strength of the word of god the anointing of the holy ghost sixth scripture says you are more than a conqueror in your tests of faith because you are called to reign in this life as a king and priest according to romans 8 35-37 romans 5 17 revelation 1 verse 6 and jude 1 verses 20 and 21 friends we reign in this life take your control back over your mind and body you are a spiritual king and priest you rule you lead you take control and then you pray like a priest like jesus and remember jude 1 says praying builds up your most holy faith seventh resist satan's thoughts with the greatest weapon and make satan flee we find these truths in james 4 verse 7 and matthew chapter 4 like jesus overcame satan himself by simply quoting and obeying the word in matthew chapter 4 when he was tempted three times of satan so can you do the same the weapon is the sword of the spirit which is speaking and obeying the word of god it is the law of god james tells us resist satan and satan has to flee he'll flee because you're drawing nigh to god you're drawing nigh to that holy presence and he'll realize he can't overcome that holy presence also when you resist satan with the word you've now got rule over your mind or human spirit as proverbs 25 verse 28 says he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls when you don't resist satan it's like having no walls to protect your city and satan can just walk into your mind with no hindrances and spoil your city or spoil your thoughts the human flesh will always naturally love lusts of the eyes because there's no good thing in our flesh according to romans 7 verse 18 the human mind is different sometimes we love the word of god and other times we accept bad thoughts and we don't think about the word of god like we should satan has full access to our minds for it is the battlefield and he attacks our minds with past memories lustful images on our phones or devices or billboards so this means you've got to daily renew your mind in holiness and godliness as we saw jesus doing earlier and also you see that in romans 12 verses 1 and 2 where it says transform your mind by the renewing of your mind and you also see it in second corinthians 4 verse 16 that says though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day so the stronger you are in the word of god thinking and meditating on the word of god the more you'll be able to resist satan and just a short testimony a brother emailed me overseas numerous times and he often battled porn and i asked him when have you resisted pornography he thought about this he thought about james 4 verse 7 and this led to his victory at least as far as i know i hope his victory's still going on but the last time i heard from him he that he had had victory over pornography for at least two weeks i believe it was so we can't stop resisting we have to resist satan and the bible promises he will flee the eighth truth is that you should know you will have seasons of relief we find this most wonderful truth that satan will leave for a season as luke 4 verse 13 says when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him speaking of jesus for a season also acts 9 31 said then had the churches rest throughout all judea and galilee and samaria so when we resist satan we understand there will be seasons of harsh battle but then there'll also be seasons of relief where we don't battle as much or as often so complete victory is possible because you recognize there are seasons of battle that are harder than others and you can prepare for those seasons and you do that like jesus did through daily prayer building up your most holy faith a ninth bible truth is that we must commit to daily crucifying or mortifying the sinful affections and lusts as jesus christ and paul commanded us you find this in luke 9 23 luke 14 27 galatians 5 24 and romans 8 13. if jesus endured a physical cross so you didn't have to we can surely endure a spiritual cross or death to self and the bodily and mental passions cravings and desires can be crucified in order to glorify jesus christ in our lives for some people overcoming pornography is a slow death it's a slow victory but yet a victory nonetheless other people they can just be delivered instantly that's all by the grace of god and by the plan of god and also by the free moral agency of the believer as well but there's also the fact that every day you must crucify and stop all the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and the pride of life and jesus said if you don't do that you cannot be his disciple for he said his disciples will take up their crosses daily and follow him the 10th bible verse says that real repentance is having a zeal to obey god the next time porn is presented to you this is found in second corinthians 7 verses 10 through 11. the bible said godly sorrow brings you to a spiritual carefulness you want to clear yourself from the sin you have a vehement desire or zeal to get revenge on the devil this will help people to know if they've repented or not if you've really repented then you have a desire or zeal to not fall to that sin the next time if not you need to keep praying and keep dying out to yourself and have a thorough repentance this is a good time to bring up the box of rattlesnakes that brother brown talked about you should hate pornography so much because of what it felt like the last time you accepted the box of rattlesnakes or pornography that you can't wait to refuse the box the rattlesnakes the next time satan brings it and eleventh truth is focus on the solution not the problem as brother ram told us in the church age book it really doesn't matter what we are to overcome he said for is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome he said it does not matter much what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome and that's what this video has been about pointing us to the bible scriptures that tell us how to overcome you overcome like jesus by the spirit and the word you quote the word and the holy spirit anoints you to obey that word of god so focus on the word just like god showed joshua the three-step process for spiritual strength and courage in joshua chapter one the first step is of course repent the second is remember god's with you like he was with moses or god is with us like he was with brother branham and then third meditate upon the word and speak the word see your house has to be filled with the anointing of god you can't let satan come into your house and bind the strong man of faith and also remember that brother brahm said you're not an overcomer unless you're overcoming so i know that's what you want that's why you're watching this video and god will help you to be an overcomer and then you'll know you are one of those overcomers out of laodicea by the grace of god and you'll get the rewards you'll sit with christ on the throne with the other overcoming saints from all seven church ages a 12 scripture is mark 9 25 and this shows in jesus name and authority we have the power to keep satan out of our lives for good mark 9 25 shows jesus rebuking a foul spirit and he said enter no more into him that was divine command that foul spirit was never going to come back into that individual because jesus commanded it now we can use that same power and that's the power i've received as i'll share in my testimony we have power and authority to rebuke those sexual demons those lust devils and have power and authority over them and command them that they'll never come back but of course he'll still come to tempt and will come with an even stronger temptation but as long as your house is filled with the anointing of god the strong man is there in the house you'll turn them down you won't accept the box of rattlesnakes because you know better and now you've got the victory by the grace of god the 13th scripture is that life is in your tongue proverbs 18 verse 21 death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof if you speak all these verses i've listed here in faith and faith is trust or assurance then these scriptures cannot fail just as the scriptures did not fail in jesus mouth when he overcame satan's three temptations in the wilderness remember you just can't speak it you've got to speak it and obey the word of god that's the spirit and the word working together that's the mechanics and the dynamics by the grace of god and lastly number 14 i just want to give a summary again for overcoming james 4 verses 7 and 8 say this submit yourselves therefore to god so don't submit yourself to the devil don't submit yourself to pornography resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to god and he will draw an eye to you so we see this summary again repent which means hate your sin and expose the enemy second resist the temptation one day at a time which also means crucifying lustful passions every day if you resist satan has to flee that's thus saith the bible third focus on the good get busy doing a ministry for jesus maybe start a ministry help someone else's ministry redeem the time and serve others getting your mind off of yourself being addicted to pornography is so selfish it's all about you but a christian has eternal life they live for other people so when you serve others that helps you get your mind off yourself and onto people that god has called you to serve because ephesians 2 verse 10 says god created you the works that you need to do before the foundation of the world he created you unto good works so take the word of god in your mind and go do those good works and glorify the father which is in heaven my testimony about overcoming sexual sin i felt it would be helpful to share a little bit about my personal testimony overcoming sexual sins by god's grace i've had victory over this demonic spirit and have it for at least 19 years all glory to our lord jesus christ this battle began when i was either in second or third grade i was not raised in the message god gave to brother branham i was raised in a pentecostal trinitarian church one night i stayed the night at a friend's house and watched mtv for the first time i was instantly hooked on the spirit of lust so much so that i started drawing my own baseball cards at home with women in bikinis on the cards that moment of mtv is still quite vivid in my mind all these years later as much as i wish i could forget it but this shows again how men are visually stimulated and i'm not the only one scarred by sinful images as one brother in the lord i've talked to still remembers seeing his first dirty magazine when he was just in kindergarten that moment is still vivid in his mind and he's still got to battle those thoughts in difficult seasons when satan returns to tempt him just like i've got to battle my thoughts as i grew and entered junior high in high school my friends introduced me to pornographic magazines and wicked movies the movies were not officially pornographic which i greatly thank god for but still contained lots of evil sexual content then around 1998 or 1999 when i was finishing high school the internet arrived and a friend showed me how to access sinful pictures i remained enslaved to lust for about three more years i would hide out in my house in different rooms looking at filthy magazines and during my first few years of college i would rent a laptop from the library and spend more time on sinful pictures than studying but thankfully deliverance came in 2002 when my brother introduced me to the message god gave to william branham before this time i didn't think that deliverance was possible but listening to brother branham preach about the power of jesus christ i realized total deliverance was indeed possible for me my victory came later in college after i repented of my addiction to lustful images and began resisting satan with the word of god i refused to take the library laptops to secluded areas i would work on the laptop in the public spaces around other people i stopped watching dirty movies i would just walk right by the tv when my roommates were watching sex scenes or movies that had sex scenes in them i fill my mind with the word of god listening to brother branham writing out bible studies reading books about the bible and more i began to hate pornography and the guilt and shame it brought to my life true repentance finally came to my heart and life and i'd like to humbly share that god help me overcome these sexual addictions without special computer software or anything else other than the word of god now some men and women might need that in the early stages of their victory or maybe even all throughout their lives and that's between them and god each person should strive to have a testimony that pleases god thankfully jesus fully delivered me from my sinful addictions before i was married in 2003 then the lord called me to preach in 2004 and i've stayed completely free from sexual addiction from around 2002 to 2003 until today by the marvelous grace of our lord jesus christ i came to the conclusion that i had the authority to cast out satan out of my mind and keep him out forever as jesus said in mark 9 25 i quoted this verse then and still do today telling satan that he cannot enter into my mind and get me addicted the son has set me free in the holy name of jesus christ today as a pastor of a small message church and father of eight children i'm human so i'm still subject to daily battles of lustful thoughts but also temptations from the other two channels lust of the flesh and pride of life and i'm aware brother branham said preachers will battle three main temptations money popularity and women i've experienced that these battles are seasonal as well but as i resist satan he eventually has to flee brother branham had to put up a cross in his car because of all the sexy dressed women that walked on the streets even at the age of 50 he talked about this so the battle was real for him likely for his entire life recall the brother random quote about any healthy red-blooded man will have something pass over him every time he sees a sexy dressed woman which is true this is likely going to happen every day but we will daily cast down any imagination that exalts itself against the word of god we know satan will return at a later season so we must constantly fill our mind with the word of god every single day the more the better brother branham said every christian sins every single day if every christian sins at least once a day and then more than one on some days sexual lust might be one of those sins but if it's quickly confessed it is forgiven by the blood of jesus christ that's why we need the blood of jesus christ every single day of our lives if a man says he does not sin each day he's a liar as first john 1 verses 7 through 10 states but god is so faithful to cleanse us daily as we daily confess our sins here's the quotes where brother brahm says we sin every day let's listen to the [Applause] there's none quote sin every day you've seen paul said he had to die daily and if we say we sin and have those then then the bible says we make god to lie and we could not do that so we sin daily and it's great god's grace that saves us as we confess our loans god's just to forgive them and your your confession as long as it holds good your salvation is perfect same as with divine healing it's your personal faith and a resurrected lord jesus here's a quote where brother branham says we sin every day yes sir but he says we're perfected or made perfect or completed because we're in jesus christ or we're baptized with the holy ghost and we've got a ticket to present to the enemy the promise of jesus christ where he said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall never come to the judgment but is passed from death unto life that's our ticket friends let's listen to the quote how we got that this morning how that we are perfected perfected absolutely spotless and blameless not one sin on us amen are you above temptation never do you sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him and god could no more judge us and nothing couldn't be righteous he's already judged us in him when he judged christ he judged me he judged you and he can't judge me again because he took my judgment if i've been redeemed and i got a ticket to show that i redeemed my watch in the pawnshop let somebody try to take it back to pawn shop once when i've got a ticket i have redeemed it as the devil will try to put punishment on me i've got a ticket that shows i've been redeemed yes sir no more judgment he they heareth thy words believeth on him and send me has eternal life and shall never come to the judgment but has passed from death unto life that's particular in another quote brother adam said he sinned daily and had thousands of mistakes or sins in a year this equates to at least one sin per day and on other days up to five or more sins per day but brother branham said the power of the gospel is the blood of jesus christ forgiving all of our sins and then we move on serving god let's listen to the quote i have no holiness to present to him but i'm trusting in his oh his grace and i have it in my heart i want meredith nothing i could do to deserve it by my grace he called me and invited me to come and i looked to him and he took the desire away from me i'll make thousands of mistakes even each month and each year showing that everybody when i see them wrong i said god didn't mean to do that you know my heart but it means to do that i was trapped into that i didn't mean to do you forgive me lord if i'd done wrong to my brother i said brother forgive me i didn't mean to do that certainly god knows my heart oh there you are there's the blood sacrifice there's the power of the gospel that holy church moving on not because something you've done it's something you had nothing to do with there's the atonement brother rams quote about the river of no return movie one of my viewers on youtube was a critic of brother branham and thought brother branham taught it was acceptable to watch movies since brother ram said he watched the marilyn monroe movie called river of no return bill graham said he made time to watch the movie and saw marilyn sexy dressed this critic then blamed brother branham for her father's mistreatment of women but of course i believe that's a false accusation let's listen to the quote and then i'll make some comments that i shared with this viewer now when i was in canada the other day my kids kept telling me over a certain place where a lady let us have the house had a television and they said there's going to be a play called the river of no return that's the river i fish on all time and don smith a friend of mine takes that tour said they made a movie of it and said daddy maybe that mr smith is on the program would you like to look at it well i said when i come back from canada if i'm making time i'll look at it well when the play didn't come on i went over to see it went to see it and when i did who was playing in it but marilyn monroe now there she was after being dead a year ago there she was all sexy dressed that was her voice upon still playing and will be for years and years of all that magnetic tape if that magnetic tape holds her action when if she could look from where she is tonight i trust she's the same but i don't know that's the god but if she can look back she cannot deny it she can't deny this because we've got it how much more has got god ever move every action upon his great supreme faith that'll be we cannot get out of it i'm going to read portions of this viewer's comment on youtube she wrote quote do you have any plans on making a video about men in the church looking at pornography and lust your channel is weirdly quiet on those topics that need addressed which is common considering you're a message preacher but the women message mentality end quote so here's some of what i wrote back to the viewer quote friend i often preach against the lust of the eyes and pornography you can listen to my sermons on our youtube channel at bride of christ fellowship akron i hope to make a video on the lust of the eyes at some point end quote the woman commented again and said that she was raised in the message and she said quote it is my observation that the main focus and hard preaching is reserved for women of the church all blame is placed on women the men of the message have no problem watching marilyn monroe in river of no return because their profit did and the double standard is clear to most women in the message end quote and the woman went on to say that her dad was a message preacher and he would watch certain shows as long as there wasn't cuss words on them but they could have immorally dressed women on them so my reply was i'm sorry to hear the people in your life who claim to believe the message didn't follow scripture here's a few things i hope will help you first brother brahm does not place all blame on women it is a shared blame in the church age book brother ram taught god put the blame on adam on page 104 if a church put blame only on women or treated women as second-class citizens they were sadly deceived regarding brother branham watching river of no return you and i don't know how much he watched of it you and i don't know if the holy spirit had him turn his head at scenes that showed immoral clothing so please don't judge brother branham because you weren't there you are jumping to conclusions as for me i would never watch those kind of movies nor watch any tv shows because the bible says to put no wicked thing before our eyes in psalms 101 verse 3. if any person liked watching tv shows with sexually dressed women they were sinning so again friends it's sad you know this viewer is very critical brother branham doesn't believe the message and use that one quote to jump to conclusions and make it seem like brother brown liked watching movies with sexy dressed women on him which we know that's not the case again we don't know if the holy ghost had him turn his head for those scenes we don't know how much of the movie he actually watched and we don't know if he repented about it later we have no idea so we want to be gracious with brother branham since he's not here to ask questions just like we want people to be gracious with us so i would ask that critical viewer to please be merciful he that is without sin cast the first stone and we don't even know if brother branham sinned or not it's likely he didn't because he had outstanding christian character shunned evil preached holiness lived holiness and another word to the viewer if your dad or any other man idolized lust do you first look at yourself and see if you idolize certain things like gossip or fashion chocolate or coffee do you watch movies that have sex scenes in them of course i say these things with grace so that the person will think about themselves and how they're criticizing brother branham closing i hope this video has been a blessing friends it's been on my heart for years to make this and i felt like this would be the right time i could do it by the grace of god there's so many scriptures that give us warning and warnings are helpful and then there's so many scriptures that point us to the victory we can have over sexual sins through the power of the holy ghost if you're struggling with sexual sin i hope you'll take the bible verses presented on this video and use them to overcome and it's my prayer you'll take those bible verses and you won't let those sexual thoughts come into your mind for very long and you won't let a sexual addiction happen in your mind or your body by the grace of our lord jesus christ you can overcome you are called to overcome and there's great rewards for every overcomer revelation 21 verse 7 says he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son the greatest thing we can inherit is the blessing of being in the presence of our lord and savior the lord jesus christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
