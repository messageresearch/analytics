TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] revelation chapters four and five the themes of both chapters include the heavenly throne and the worship of the worthy Lamb who had the seven sealed book the heavenly throne is described in breathtaking detail as we see the one person seated on the throne and his colours a rainbow is round about the throne along with 24 seats for the 24 elders clothed in white raiment and crowns on their heads lightnings thunderings and voices proceed out of the throne and seven lamps of fire burned before the throne which are the seven spirits of God a sea of glasses before the throne along with four beasts which rest not day and night and cry holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come the lamb is said to be worthy to open and read the book because he prevailed he was slain on the cross and resurrected redeeming us to God by his blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation here we see how powerful the cross of Jesus Christ truly was and still is the mysteries of the book sealed with seven seals could not be made known without Jesus's work on Calvary Jesus's blood remitted or sent away our sins and we are now made nigh unto God through Jesus blood the sinless holy life of Jesus Christ made him worthy to take God's seven sealed book and reveal it to John and now to us the overcomers of our church age notice that no man or woman in heaven or earth was worthy except Christ not the Virgin Mary not Enoch not Elijah and so forth for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God God would only let his sinless holy son loose the seals and reveal the mysteries in his book the timing of the events in these chapters are unknown to us as we do not have a thus saith the Lord about these events but it is our personal conviction that the events of chapter 5 are history and took place sometime around 1963 because that was the year that William Branham preached the revelation of the seven seals with thus saith the Lord the symbols and key revelations include the four beasts the four and twenty elders the seven spirits of God and the book sealed with seven seals the four beasts serve as throne guards to God's throne or mercy seat in heaven and our symbolic of the four Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John that guard the book of Acts the four beasts also represent four powers or anointings of the Holy Ghost that will combat the four horse riders of the first four seals the four and twenty elders are the twelve sons of Jacob and the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ in their rightful position of authority as Christ promised in Matthew 19 verse 28 we believe st. Paul would have taken the place of Judas Iscariot and not Matthias for Paul said he was born out of season he was the least of the apostles and was the last to see Christ after Jesus's resurrection the seven spirits of God as lamps of fire are representations of the constant faithful presence of the holy ghost in each of the seven churches first John 5:7 said that the Holy Ghost bore record in heaven so we see this truth vindicated in Chapter four as these seven spirits or lamps are heavenly witnesses we know that the Holy Ghost is only one spirit based on numerous scriptures such as first Corinthians 6 verse 17 first Corinthians 12 verse 13 Ephesians 2:18 and Ephesians 4:4 so God is not seven different spirits God is showing us the truth that the Holy Ghost has revealed himself and acted the same in every single Church age all seven Church ages and heaven bears record of this glorious truth the book sealed with seven seals is a book of redemption for only the Redeemer Christ himself is worthy to take the book and reveal its mysterious contents to us this is the climatic event of chapters 4 and 5 the lamb coming to take the book open it and loose the seven seals which causes the four beasts the 24 elders and thousands upon thousands of angels and even John himself to worship this worthy one our Lord Jesus Christ as we will see shortly this conceal book contains the mystery of how Satan will attempt to come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless the loosing of this seven sealed book though also reveals how the true Christian today through the anointing of the Holy Ghost gains authority over the devil exposing his wicked ways so that the overcomer prevails against the gates of Hell and Satan's devices if you like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
