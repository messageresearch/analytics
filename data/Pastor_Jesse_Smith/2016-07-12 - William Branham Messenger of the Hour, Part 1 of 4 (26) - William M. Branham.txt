Description:
Part 1 of this series begins with 3 clips that show God's vindication of William Branham as a prophet or seer sent from God. We believe God gave William Branham a "Son of man" ministry that was a continuation of Jesus' own "Son of Man" ministry that He exercised during His earthly ministry. No other minister or ministry in recent history has ever manifested the power of Jesus Christ like the ministry that God gave to William Branham. Bible Teaching on the Message of the Hour and the Messenger of the Hour is also presented on this video. God commissioned William Branham to reveal the 12 Bible-defined mysteries as well as restore numerous Bible truths that were lost during church history.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to introduce you to God's messenger of this day and hour we believe the Bible and history prove that there is only one man in recent history who has been both a messenger from God and Prophet Anointed with the Spirit of Elijah God's Prophet messenger was a named William brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 we want to introduce you to this messenger from God by first showing you three short clips of God's Vindication of William brandham as a prophet or Seer sent from God God gave William brandham a son of man or Prophet Ministry so powerful and scriptural that it remains unmatched today by any preacher and this gift could only have been a Contin uation of the same Ministry that Jesus Christ exercised himself during his Earthly Prophet Ministry or son of man Ministry Jesus's son of man Ministry revealed the thoughts secrets and intents of the hearts of individuals he came in contact with we will now see three undeniable examples of Jesus anointing William brandham with the same son of man Ministry that God let William brandham operate thousands of times night in and night out in the same glorious and humble manner for his entire public Ministry throughout the 1940s 50s and 60s first the son of man or Prophet gift in Jesus's life told the woman at the well about her secret trouble of having six husbands and immediately the woman knew Jesus was a prophet due to the discernment watch here as the same Holy Spirit anoints William brandham to reveal Woman's secret

going home to be well in the name of Jesus Christ go and be made [Music] well what amazing footage of the son of man Jesus Christ anointing a son of man or Prophet by the name of William brandham we pray those short clips help prove the powerful sign of the son of man Ministry that God gave to William brandham now want to show the Bible teaching that proves God foretold and promised to send William bram's Ministry which was a prophet or son of man Ministry a Ministry Anointed with the spirit of Elijah for the last days to preach God's message of the hour before the second coming of Jesus Christ Bible teaching on the message and messenger recall from our message of the hour video that God has sent an end time message for our day which is restoration restoration of all things including hearts of obedience to the word and Bible truths Revelation revelation of the Bible Mysteries of God and Rapture the catching away a Rapture of the Holy Ghost filled New Testament Church before the tribulation period this message is straight out of the Bible and is the message that William brandham the messenger preached as we will show through this video series the first part of the message of the hour today is restoration acts 3:20 and 21 state that Jesus must remain in Heaven until the restitution or restoration of all things and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began this promised restoration before Jesus would return was taught again in scripture This Time by Jesus himself in Matthew 17:11 Jesus gave us more detail about this restoration stating that God would send Elijah to restore all things Matthew 17:11 and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore All Things by the direction of the Holy Spirit we find the spirit of Elijah mentioned again in Malachi 4: 5 and 6 which states the spirit of Elijah would be upon a prophet and his ministry would turn the heart of the children to their fathers before judgment strikes the world the great and Dreadful day of the Lord behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse the phrase turn the heart refers to a heart that lovingly obeys the word of God as seen by Romans 6:17 and acts 7:39 these scriptures plainly teach that a heart turned to God is an obedient heart but God be thank that you were Servants of sin but have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered you to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt so to summarize what we see the Bible teach so far is that Jesus will remain in heaven and not return to the Earth until all things including the hearts of Believers are restored to obedience by a prophet Anointed with the spirit of Elijah later in this video series we will give a more detailed teaching on Malachi 4:5 and 6 the second part of today's message is revelation it is through this revelation of the word of God that the restoration of the hearts literally takes place for a heart cannot be restored until the true word of God has been revealed to the believer the Bible promised a finished revelation of the mystery of God before the end of the world Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets we know this seventh angel must be a prophet for Amos 3:7 teaches that God only reveals his Secrets or Mysteries through proph prophets as God has never commissioned angels to preach the gospel to all the nations but rather men surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets so this angel of Revelation 10:7 must be a prophet and must be a man this does not contradict the Bible for numerous times in the Bible humans are called angels and that is the case with Revelation 10:7 David was called an angel in 1st Samuel 29:9 and 2 Samuel 19:27 St Paul said he was received as an angel in Galatians 4:14 and a prophet in Revelation 22: 8 and9 was called an angel or messenger of God we believe this seventh angel is the same person and same ministry as the Elijah anointed Prophet spoken of earlier in the previous scriptures as the finishing of the mystery of God is surely part of the restoration of all things and could only be done by a prophet Revelation 10:7 said the mystery of God would be finished and we believe William brandham preached and revealed the 12 Bible defin Mysteries to the people of God if the Lord is willing we will produce a separate video detailing these 12 Bible Mysteries which include the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus's seven parables in Matthew 13 godliness restored to man iniquity God in Christ or the godhead Israel's blindness to the Messiah during the church age or Gentile dispensation translation of the living Saints with resurrected Saints or the Rapture the New Testament Church composed of both Jew and Gentile Believers the New Testament Church as the bride of Christ Christ dwelling in The Believer or the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seven Stars mystery Babylon the mystery of God's will there were also many Bible truths that needed restored by the ministry of William brandham which he Faithfully preached these restored truths included marriage and divorce water baptism in the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ Long uncut hair for women and short hair for for men separate garments for men and women no crossdressing the rejection of worldliness such as rejecting makeup smoking drinking and immoral sexy clothing the seed of The Serpent and the original sin the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost true teaching on Grace the three works of Grace and salvation justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost no women angels and no women preachers in the Bible predestination election and free more agency just to name a few as we summarize again we see the bible teach through all these scriptures that Jesus will remain in heaven and not return to the Earth until all things including the hearts of the end time Believers or children are restored to obedience through the m iies of the Bible being revealed by a prophet Anointed with the spirit of Elijah the Rapture is the third and final part of the message of the hour once the hearts of every holy ghost filled Christian or bride member are restored through the revelation of God's word then the Rapture can take place if God is willing we will produce a video and teach about the revelations God has given to his people today regarding the rapture [Music]
