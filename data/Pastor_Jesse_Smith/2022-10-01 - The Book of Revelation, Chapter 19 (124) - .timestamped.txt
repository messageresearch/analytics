[0:01] Revelation chapter 19.
[0:04] [Music]
[0:08] s of this chapter include Heaven's
[0:11] praise to God at the Judgment of the
[0:12] great
[0:14] the marriage supper of the Lamb and
[0:16] Christ returned to Earth on a white
[0:18] horse at the battle of Armageddon
[0:23] heaven will praise God for finally
[0:25] judging the great mystery Babylon
[0:27] the Roman Catholic Church as seen in
[0:30] verses one through six
[0:31] God was so patient with his idolatrous
[0:34] woman or church even giving her space to
[0:37] repent over one thousand years but she
[0:40] repented not though she was guilty of
[0:42] the blood of God's prophets and servants
[0:44] all of them had to wait upon the timing
[0:46] of God for him to pour out his vengeance
[0:49] for vengeance is mine saith the Lord
[0:52] as Revelation 12 verse 19 says
[0:55] and Revelation chapter 17 and 18 gave us
[0:57] a powerful look at the destruction of
[1:00] Rome and the Vatican
[1:03] recall that God doesn't Delight in the
[1:05] death of the wicked Ezekiel 33 verse 11
[1:08] states this plainly
[1:10] but just as with Sodom and Gomorrah the
[1:12] just and fair God had to pour out his
[1:15] wrath due to repeated disobedience
[1:18] we see the same repeated Disobedience of
[1:21] the Roman Catholic Church refusing to
[1:23] repent for over one thousand years
[1:25] turning down God's reformers
[1:28] like Martin Luther and John Wesley
[1:31] and more recently God's Prophet brother
[1:33] William Branham
[1:36] the marriage supper the lamb is revealed
[1:37] in verses 7 through 10 and we learn that
[1:40] the lamb Jesus Christ has a wife which
[1:43] we know is the New Testament Holy Ghost
[1:45] filled Gentile Church according to
[1:48] Ephesians 5 32 and acts 15 verse 14.
[1:52] this marriage supper will be a time
[1:53] likened unto a wedding reception for
[1:56] Christ and his wife and will include a
[1:59] glorious time of communion as taught in
[2:01] Matthew 26 29.
[2:05] while Jesus's bride is having communion
[2:07] the earth and the remainder of its
[2:09] inhabitants who did not receive the Holy
[2:11] Ghost are being purged during the awful
[2:14] Great Tribulation period
[2:17] Christ returned to Earth on a white
[2:19] horse at the battle of Armageddon is
[2:21] detailed in verses 11 through 21.
[2:23] which is the public Universal Event of
[2:26] Christ's visible return to Earth for his
[2:28] second coming at the end of the
[2:30] tribulation period
[2:32] for the scripture says that every eye
[2:34] shall see him and they also which
[2:36] pierced him and all kindreds of the
[2:38] Earth shall wail because of him even so
[2:41] amen
[2:42] according to Revelation 1 verse 7.
[2:45] Revelation chapters 14 and 16 also
[2:48] detail the battle of Armageddon as all
[2:50] men Gather in vain to make war against
[2:53] the lamb
[2:54] as the sword of the Lord proceeds from
[2:56] the mouth of Christ and slays all the
[2:58] disobedient Blasphemous men
[3:01] this is the stone cut out of the
[3:03] mountain event of Daniel 2 verse 35.
[3:09] the symbols and key Revelations include
[3:11] the wife of the Lamb the fine linen
[3:14] clean and white garments
[3:16] he that sat upon a white horse
[3:19] the armies upon white horses
[3:22] and the Beast and the false prophet
[3:27] the wife of the Lamb is the holy
[3:28] ghost-filled New Testament Church
[3:30] because without the spirit of Christ a
[3:33] person is none of his according to
[3:35] Romans 8 verse 9. John the Baptist
[3:37] taught that Jesus was the bridegroom who
[3:39] had a bride in John 3 verse 29. in
[3:43] Ephesians 5 32 plainly states that the
[3:45] church is the bride or wife of Jesus
[3:48] Christ
[3:48] much more scripture could be used to
[3:50] support this but recall the Gentile
[3:53] church was called out to God as a people
[3:55] for his name according to acts 15 verse
[3:58] 14 which fits the symbolism of a husband
[4:01] taking a wife and then the wife takes
[4:04] the name of her husband
[4:07] the fine linen clean and white garments
[4:09] of the wife of Jesus are symbolic of the
[4:12] Holy Ghost baptism which is eternal life
[4:15] because Revelation 19 verse 8 called it
[4:18] the righteousness of the Saints and
[4:20] Titus 2 verse 5 states that the washing
[4:23] and regenerative powers of the Holy
[4:25] Ghost are not by our righteousness but
[4:28] God's righteousness
[4:30] Jesus's parable of the wedding feast and
[4:32] The Man Without The Wedding garment in
[4:34] Matthew 22 verses 1 through 14 his
[4:37] further support of this interpretation
[4:38] as the Garment represents the believer
[4:41] was born again with the righteousness
[4:44] and power of the Holy Ghost
[4:47] in Luke 24 49 Jesus stated that the Holy
[4:50] Ghost would be an experience of power in
[4:52] dude which means clothing
[4:55] so it would be clothing or putting on of
[4:58] Jesus's power
[5:00] God's Prophet brother Branham says the
[5:02] white robe represents eternal life
[5:04] which is scriptural as the fifth seal
[5:07] shows the Jews receiving eternal life or
[5:10] white robes
[5:11] and this is true because they denied
[5:13] Christ while on Earth because they were
[5:15] blinded to him
[5:16] As Romans chapter 11 says
[5:19] so the Jews could not have eternal life
[5:20] while blinded to Christ as the Messiah
[5:24] but once in heaven the blindedness was
[5:26] removed and now Jesus can give them
[5:28] eternal life because they were faithful
[5:29] to the word of God and the testimony
[5:31] that they held
[5:33] Also regarding white raiment Revelation
[5:36] 3 verse 5 and 3 Verse 18 proves this
[5:39] white raiment is available now
[5:42] just like it was available during the
[5:44] Sardis Church age as Revelation 3 verse
[5:46] 4 says
[5:47] According to second Corinthians 5 verse
[5:49] 3 Paul says a soul without eternal life
[5:52] is found naked and again this is just
[5:54] like the Jews under the fifth seal in
[5:56] Revelation chapter 6 who had to be given
[5:59] white robes
[6:00] brother random taught this in the
[6:02] sardesian church age chapter chapter 7
[6:05] of the church age Book quote it is the
[6:08] second resurrection that the souls under
[6:10] the altar are set forth in the fifth
[6:13] seal Revelation 6 verses 9 through 11
[6:16] are given white robes and of course
[6:18] eternal life or there would be no point
[6:20] of white robes end quote
[6:24] he that sat upon a white horse is a key
[6:26] Revelation from Revelation 19 verse 11
[6:29] of the second coming of Jesus Christ to
[6:31] the Earth
[6:32] Jesus only is faithful and true as he is
[6:35] called faithful two more times in the
[6:37] Book of Revelation chapter 1 verse 5 and
[6:40] chapter 3 verse 14.
[6:42] Christ also has eyes as a flame of fire
[6:44] as spoken previously in Revelation 1
[6:46] verse 14. Christ is called the word of
[6:49] God in Revelation 19 verse 13 and John 1
[6:52] verses 1-3 and verse 14. Christ is also
[6:57] called the king of kings and Lord of
[6:58] lords in Revelation 19 verse 16 and
[7:01] First Timothy 6 verse 15 and Revelation
[7:04] 17 verse 14.
[7:06] at this second coming of Jesus Christ to
[7:08] the Earth Christ slays all men in his
[7:11] righteous judgment officially ending the
[7:14] day of man as he makes ready for the
[7:16] Lord's Day fulfilling the times of the
[7:18] Gentiles Prophecy of the stone cut out
[7:21] of the mountain from Daniel chapter 2
[7:23] verses 31 through 45.
[7:28] the armies upon white horses is a
[7:31] revelation that reveals the true nature
[7:33] of the Holy ghost-filled New Testament
[7:35] Church
[7:36] every born-again Christian is a soldier
[7:38] as second Timothy 2 verse 3 says and
[7:41] lives their lives on Earth battling
[7:43] spiritual wickedness in high places as
[7:46] Ephesians 6 verse 12 States
[7:48] the Christian Soldier puts on the full
[7:50] armor of God in order to stand against
[7:52] The Wiles or deceit of Satan see
[7:55] Ephesians 6 verses 11 through 18. every
[7:58] holy ghost filled Christian is a
[8:00] spiritual King who rules over sin the
[8:02] World the Flesh and the devil also it is
[8:05] a blessed Revelation about these armies
[8:07] riding white horses as these horses came
[8:10] down from heaven proving that heaven has
[8:13] a place for animals
[8:15] Revelation 7 verse 4 and Ezekiel 1 verse
[8:17] 10 prove that there are living creatures
[8:19] in heaven that resemble a lion ox and
[8:22] flying eagle
[8:24] Second Kings 2 verse 11 also reveals
[8:27] there were horses of fire in heaven for
[8:29] The Chariot of fire and Horses of fire
[8:31] are what took Elijah to Heaven by a
[8:34] whirlwind
[8:37] the Beast and the false prophet Pope are
[8:40] revealed as the following the Beast is
[8:42] the evil spirit or power of the past
[8:45] ancient Roman Empire and current Kingdom
[8:47] of Rome
[8:49] according to Daniel 7 verse 23 or Roman
[8:52] Catholic Church
[8:53] the false prophet is closely connected
[8:55] to the Beast or Spirit of Rome and is
[8:57] called a man
[8:59] since a prophet is one who speaks for
[9:00] God we conclude that the one man who
[9:03] claims to speak for God
[9:04] and is false in his Doctrine and is
[9:07] closely connected to the spirit of Rome
[9:09] is the pope of the Roman Catholic Church
[9:12] both the Beast and the false prophet
[9:14] will be cast alive into a lake of fire
[9:16] burning with Brimstone according to
[9:19] Revelation 19 verse 20.
[9:21] see part 3 of our video series called
[9:23] mystery Babylon the Roman Catholic
[9:25] Church for more teaching on the false
[9:27] prophet or see chapter 9 of my 2021 book
[9:31] The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed
[9:36] the timing of events is as follows the
[9:39] marriage supper the lamb will happen in
[9:41] heaven while the judgments of God are
[9:43] being poured upon the Earth during the
[9:45] seven year tribulation period
[9:48] this is proven from the parable of Jesus
[9:50] from Matthew 25 verse 10. as it Reveals
[9:53] All Those without the oil or baptism the
[9:56] Holy Ghost are kept out of the marriage
[9:59] which represents the marriage supper of
[10:01] the Lamb
[10:02] Revelation chapter 22 verse 13 is a
[10:05] second witness that shows a person
[10:07] without the wedding garment
[10:08] which is again a symbol of the baptism
[10:11] of the Holy Ghost
[10:12] will be kept out of the wedding or
[10:14] marriage and cast into outer Darkness
[10:17] with weeping a gnashing of teeth
[10:19] and this outer Darkness seems to be our
[10:22] description of the suffering involved in
[10:24] the seven year tribulation period as we
[10:26] see in Revelation 16 verse 10. and all
[10:29] those who suffer wrath during the Great
[10:31] Tribulation who are not the foolish
[10:33] virgin will also be cast in the Lake of
[10:35] Fire and have even more weeping and
[10:37] gnashing of teeth according to Matthew
[10:39] 24 51.
[10:43] the timing of the battle of Armageddon
[10:45] seems to follow the vatican's
[10:46] destruction at the end of the
[10:48] tribulation period
[10:50] as there are men alive and Weeping at
[10:52] Rome's destruction in Revelation chapter
[10:55] 18 but all men gather to Armageddon and
[10:58] are slain there according to Revelation
[11:00] 19 verse 18.
