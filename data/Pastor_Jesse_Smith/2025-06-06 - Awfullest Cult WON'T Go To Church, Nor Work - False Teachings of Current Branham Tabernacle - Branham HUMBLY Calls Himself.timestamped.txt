[0:03] A minister came to me the other day
[0:04] said, "Brother Brand, they're getting
[0:05] the office cult down there. Are you ever
[0:06] seen?" Said each one of them every
[0:08] morning they go out and they said they
[0:10] ain't going to work. It's too close to
[0:11] the rapture. If you can't come here at
[0:13] the tabernacle, get some church
[0:15] somewhere. Go to it. But put them kids
[0:19] in Sunday school somewhere. And you go
[0:21] to church. Don't sit at home go fishing,
[0:23] hunting, and things like that on Sunday.
[0:26] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:30] this video is to show how God's prophet,
[0:32] the late William Marryiam Brham, greatly
[0:35] supported church attendance and called
[0:37] people that did not want to attend
[0:39] church and did not want to work an awful
[0:42] cult. So, this video promotes the Bible
[0:45] truth that we should constantly attend
[0:47] church with other believers physically
[0:49] and exposes the sin of laying out of
[0:52] church, not attending a physical church.
[0:54] And a lot of these quotes come from the
[0:55] sermon questions and answers part one
[0:58] August 23rd morning service 1964. It's a
[1:02] beautiful sermon if you haven't listened
[1:03] to it lately. Covers so many important
[1:05] topics like the baptism of the Holy
[1:06] Ghost, giants in the Bible, church
[1:09] attendance, the rapture, so many
[1:12] wonderful topics you'd be blessed to
[1:13] listen to. I listened to it yesterday by
[1:15] the grace of God. This video is going to
[1:17] be a rebuke to the current Brandom
[1:19] Tabernacle. Of course, the people who do
[1:21] not physically attend church and again
[1:23] exposes the fact that they do not do
[1:26] what the tapes say. They actually add to
[1:28] the tapes. But remember friends, our
[1:30] absolute is the holy Bible, the word of
[1:33] God. And brother Bram's tapes are not
[1:35] equal to the Bible. Brother Bram's tapes
[1:37] point us to the Bible. And anyone that
[1:39] would say different is doing what
[1:41] brother Bram said not to do. As that
[1:44] quote from the unveiling of God 1964
[1:46] said when a man tried to tempt brother
[1:48] Brandham and say he could write his own
[1:50] Bible brother Ram said you can't add one
[1:52] word or take away from the current holy
[1:55] Bible. Brother Ram said no sir it would
[1:57] be adding something to it or taking
[1:59] something from it. It's all revealed in
[2:01] there. And the seven seals opened up the
[2:03] revelation of what that was. It's still
[2:06] in the word. You can't get out of that
[2:08] word. The Holy Ghost won't leave the
[2:11] word. And God's spirit will never leave
[2:12] that word. It'll stay right with the
[2:14] word, blinding some and open the eyes of
[2:17] others. It'll always do
[2:19] that. So any man or preacher or woman or
[2:22] anyone that says the tapes are equal to
[2:24] the Bible is a liar. They have an evil
[2:27] antichrist spirit exalting William
[2:30] Brandham too highly. We just give honor
[2:32] to brother Brandham just like we give
[2:33] honor to John the Baptist and all the
[2:36] Old Testament prophets, New Testament
[2:37] prophets, St. Paul, Agabus. We give
[2:40] honor. The Bible says, "Give double
[2:42] honor to the preachers who labor in the
[2:44] word of God and doctrine, but we never
[2:46] exalt them in a sinful manner like many
[2:49] people do today around the message."
[2:51] Thank God for the truth of the Bible and
[2:53] the Holy Ghost that guides us into all
[2:55] truth to keep us from that spirit of
[2:57] idolatry. Let's start with the Bible
[2:58] foundation about church attendance. Of
[3:00] course, Jesus modeled church, faithful
[3:03] church attendance in Luke 4:16. And he
[3:05] came to Nazareth where he had been
[3:07] brought up. And as his custom was, he
[3:09] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[3:11] day and stood up to read. So the Bible's
[3:14] plain. Jesus would go to the synagogue
[3:16] every Sabbath. He never missed church.
[3:18] He would never skip the gathering to his
[3:20] father's house because the Bible said he
[3:22] did all those things that please the
[3:24] father. Hebrews 10:24 and 25 tell us to
[3:28] gather more as we see that day
[3:30] approaching. So people that don't gather
[3:31] more are in disobedience to Hebrews 10
[3:35] 24 and 25. In a few moments, we'll look
[3:38] at this quote from Brother Brandham
[3:39] where the people out in Arizona were not
[3:41] working. That breaks 2 Thessalonians
[3:43] 3:10. The Bible says, "If any man would
[3:46] not work, neither should he eat." Now,
[3:49] current Brandham Tabernacle people
[3:50] probably work, but they certainly don't
[3:52] attend church physically. Last summer, I
[3:55] was out in Jeffersonville and took a
[3:58] picture with the new Brandom Tabernacle
[4:00] that was built. And it's incredibly sad
[4:02] that this building sits empty. Year
[4:05] after year, how many millions of dollars
[4:08] were spent to construct this building
[4:11] for all the people that were moving into
[4:13] Jeffersonville that wanted to physically
[4:15] attend church and now they do not attend
[4:17] church. And remember the quotes from
[4:19] God's prophet, Brother Brandham. He says
[4:21] you cannot stay at home and be as good
[4:23] of a Christian. Brother Ram said people
[4:26] say I can stay at home be just as good a
[4:28] Christian as I can at church. You can't.
[4:31] The Bible said not forsake ourselves
[4:33] together and that much more as you see
[4:34] the time coming. If you're a Christian,
[4:36] you long to go to where other Christians
[4:38] are and fellowship with other
[4:39] Christians. So you cannot stay away from
[4:42] church and live the same life. You can't
[4:44] do it because you're not feeding on the
[4:46] word of God. So see friends, we can't
[4:48] change one word from the Bible. The
[4:51] Bible never says stay at home like the
[4:53] current Brandom Tabernacle leadership is
[4:55] falsely declaring. The Bible never says
[4:58] avoid the five-fold ministry, the living
[5:01] preachers. The Bible never says to limit
[5:03] the five-fold ministry. The Bible never
[5:05] says press play and obey. But they
[5:08] always press play and disobey. What the
[5:10] Brandham tabernacle is currently doing
[5:12] is promoting that preachers bury their
[5:14] talents in the earth. like in Matthew 25
[5:17] 26. And friends, any preacher that's a
[5:20] real preacher that buries his talent in
[5:22] the earth and just presses play and
[5:24] won't preach is going to be called
[5:26] wicked and slothful servant according to
[5:28] the Lord Jesus. We also see it in 1
[5:30] Timothy 4
[5:32] 11-16. Paul told Timothy, "Command and
[5:35] teach these things. Give attendance to
[5:38] exhortation and doctrine. And you can't
[5:41] exhort other people while you're sitting
[5:42] down pressing play. You can't teach
[5:45] doctrine when you're sitting down,
[5:47] pressing play. And verse 14 says, you're
[5:50] neglecting the gift that's in you and
[5:52] give yourself holy to the gift. And of
[5:54] course, preachers that just press play
[5:56] and sit down are wholly neglecting their
[5:59] gift. So they have no profiting in their
[6:02] preaching gift that appears to all. So
[6:04] how are they going to be saved? I don't
[6:06] know. But the Bible said, "Take heed to
[6:09] yourself in verse 16 and to doctrine.
[6:12] Continue in them. For in doing this,
[6:13] thou shalt both save thyself and them
[6:15] that hear thee. And before getting to
[6:17] these quotes, I do want to say this as
[6:20] well. If Brandham Tabernacle believed
[6:22] every word on tape, they would believe
[6:24] that brother Brandham said he would
[6:26] never be a successful pastor. This is a
[6:28] 1961 questions and answers. Brother
[6:31] Brandham said, "And I wasn't a
[6:33] successful pastor. Never would
[6:36] be." So the current Brandham Tabernacle
[6:38] says brother Brandham is their pastor.
[6:41] If they believed that, if they really
[6:43] believed that and really believed all
[6:45] the quotes, well then they wouldn't have
[6:47] brother Brandham as their pastor because
[6:48] he said he never would be a successful
[6:51] pastor. What kind of church would they
[6:53] be if their pastor was unsuccessful? So
[6:56] this shows they don't believe the tapes.
[6:59] They don't believe Brother Brandham.
[7:02] They're creating their own false
[7:03] religion. They're creating their own
[7:04] false denomination. Now, let's get to
[7:07] this sermon questions and answers part
[7:09] 164. In paragraph 248, they ask brother
[7:12] Brandham, "Are we missing out on
[7:14] something? These people claim to believe
[7:15] every word you say to be true." Brother
[7:18] Ram says, "But they don't. Their own
[7:20] actions prove they don't." So, it's such
[7:22] a parallel. These this group that moved
[7:24] out to Arizona in 1963 or 64, they said
[7:28] they believed every word Brother Random
[7:30] said, but brother Ram said they don't
[7:32] because their actions prove they don't.
[7:34] And the same thing is true with Brandham
[7:36] Tabernacle today. They say they believe
[7:37] every word on tape, but their actions
[7:39] prove they don't because they don't
[7:41] physically attend church more as they
[7:44] see that day approaching. And that's
[7:46] just one of the 24 lies they're
[7:48] propagating. I have a video series about
[7:50] that if you'd like to watch that. A few
[7:52] paragraphs down, Brother Ram said,
[7:54] "These people are his kids and he might
[7:56] give them a little spanking when he goes
[7:58] to see them." And then he says that the
[8:01] group said, "We come to follow the
[8:03] word." And brother Ram says, "I haven't
[8:04] even got a church to send them to there,
[8:07] and they won't go to church anyhow, and
[8:09] I have no church to preach to them. Then
[8:12] I'm morally obligated to take my
[8:14] children out of Arizona." So, Brother
[8:16] Ram said, "This group out in Arizona
[8:18] needed a spanking because they wouldn't
[8:20] go to church." So, Brother Ram makes it
[8:22] clear, a true sign that people believe
[8:25] God is they go to church. Let's listen
[8:27] to the quote. You say, "Let them go.
[8:29] They they did what you told them not to
[8:31] do. that isn't in my heart. I still want
[8:34] to go for them. They're are my
[8:37] kids. I might give them a little
[8:39] spanking when I get them back, but I but
[8:40] I'm I'm sure going after them. And how
[8:42] am I going to do out there? They said we
[8:45] come to follow the word. I haven't even
[8:47] got a church to send them to there. The
[8:49] kind of churches they'll go to there is
[8:51] the same kind you leave at other places,
[8:54] maybe worse. See, and they won't go to
[8:57] church anyhow. And I have no church to
[8:59] preach to them. then I'm morally
[9:01] obligated to take my children out of
[9:03] Arizona where then down in paragraph 258
[9:07] a minister from Arizona told brother
[9:08] Brandham they're getting the awfulst
[9:10] cult down there you ever seen each one
[9:13] of them in the morning ain't going to
[9:15] work. So I want you to see this minister
[9:18] in Arizona called these tape worshippers
[9:21] an awful cult and then at the end
[9:23] brother Brandham also called them a cult
[9:25] in his closing prayer. You want to hang
[9:27] around to the end to listen to that.
[9:29] That's a beautiful closing prayer that
[9:30] supports the five-fold ministry. So,
[9:32] let's listen to this quote about the
[9:33] awfulest cult. A minister came to me the
[9:35] other day said, "Brother Bram, they're
[9:36] getting the office cult down there you
[9:38] ever seen." Said each one of them every
[9:39] morning they go out and they said they
[9:41] ain't going to work. It's too close to
[9:43] the rapture. They're not going to work.
[9:45] Well, that just shows you don't even
[9:47] understand. That's right. Amen. This
[9:49] thing's going down
[9:50] there. So, yes,
[9:53] sir. You ought to take a lesson from the
[9:55] ant. The Bible says, you know, if they
[9:58] don't work, they don't eat. So that's
[10:00] it's exactly right. Now, earlier in this
[10:03] sermon, questions answers part one in
[10:04] paragraph 208, they asked Brother
[10:06] Random, should we go to other churches
[10:08] even when they disagree with you? Now,
[10:10] what would the current Brandom
[10:12] Tabernacle say? They'd say, "No way.
[10:13] We're not even going to church." Those
[10:15] churches don't have the voice of God is
[10:17] what they would say. Right? But listen
[10:19] to Brother Brandham's answer. Are
[10:20] Brennham Tabernacle people today saying
[10:23] what Brother Brandham said on the tapes?
[10:24] Cuz on the tapes, Brother Ram said,
[10:26] "Yes, you should go to church somewhere.
[10:28] Don't stay at home." Brother Ram said,
[10:30] "Sure. Yep. Jesus did when they
[10:32] disagreed with him." And we saw that in
[10:33] Luke 4. Jesus went to the synagogues
[10:35] even when they disagree with him. So,
[10:37] who's our example? The Lord Jesus
[10:39] Christ. Then, Brother Brham talks about
[10:41] this group down in Arizona. The
[10:43] ministerial group said, "The only thing
[10:44] we have against you, Brother Brandham,
[10:46] is that these people comes out here. We
[10:48] can't get them to go to church anywhere.
[10:51] They won't go to church." Brother Ram
[10:54] says, "Put them kids in Sunday school
[10:56] somewhere and you go to church. Don't
[10:58] set at home." How much more clear could
[11:00] Brother Brandham be? He said, "You
[11:02] dishonor the resurrection of Christ. You
[11:05] go to church somewhere." Let's listen to
[11:07] the quotes. Brother Brandham, should we
[11:10] go to the other churches even when they
[11:13] disagree with you? Sure.
[11:17] Yep. Jesus did when they disagreed with
[11:19] him. Go ahead.
[11:23] Uh, we notice Sharon saids, "Uh, should
[11:27] we go to another church that disagrees
[11:29] with you?" Sure. I don't I'm not the
[11:31] only pebble on the beach. You know,
[11:32] there just other godly man everywhere. I
[11:35] hope I'm one of them. See, but don't
[11:37] never get down here. I was called in on
[11:39] something like this uh the other day. U
[11:41] a group in Arizona called my attention
[11:44] to that. See, a ministerial group said,
[11:46] "The only thing that we have against
[11:47] you, Brother Bram, is one of the things
[11:49] the people that come down here with you,
[11:51] we can't get them to go to church
[11:52] anywhere." Said, "They got children and
[11:53] everything. They won't go to church."
[11:55] And said, "Well, we told them they're
[11:56] welcome to come to our church. I know
[11:58] they put a pressure on you and want you
[11:59] to join, but you don't have to join, but
[12:01] put them kids in Sunday school
[12:04] somewhere. And you go to church. Don't
[12:06] sit at home, go fishing, hunting, and
[12:07] things like that on Sunday." Amen. You
[12:10] say, "Well, I'm not a legalist." Well,
[12:12] you better be in that manner for a
[12:13] while, dishonoring the resurrection of
[12:15] Christ. Next, Brother Bram says he would
[12:18] go to a church if the only thing they
[12:20] believe was that Jesus was the son of
[12:22] God. He said, "I'd go hear them say
[12:25] that." And then, Brother Ram said he'd
[12:27] go listen to an Assemblies of God church
[12:29] because I can eat about three or four
[12:31] slices of bread with them. Let's listen
[12:33] to the quote. If I if I went if I
[12:36] couldn't get if I went to a certain
[12:38] church I know there's only one thing
[12:39] that people ever said that I believe
[12:41] they said they believe Jesus was son of
[12:42] God. They said it. I doubt it but I go
[12:45] hear them say
[12:46] that. Maybe say that's this church.
[12:48] Maybe the next church will be something
[12:49] like the Baptist. They say yeah I
[12:51] believe you have to have an experience.
[12:52] I go with them that then I believe Jesus
[12:54] Christ is the son of God. I believe you
[12:55] have to have an experience. All right.
[12:57] Then maybe there's assemblies of God.
[12:59] Now they believe uh see I now I can eat
[13:01] about three or four slices of bread with
[13:03] them. See,
[13:05] then down in paragraph 213, Brother Ram
[13:08] says he sent 3/4 of a million of his
[13:10] converts to the Assemblies of God
[13:13] because he thought they were the best
[13:15] church in the land to send them to. So
[13:17] he thought they were the church that had
[13:18] the most truth. So he would send his
[13:20] converts to the Assemblies of God. And
[13:22] he wasn't sending them to death. He
[13:24] said, "Would I be a hypocrite to send my
[13:26] own children to death? Far be it from
[13:28] me." So see, we know there are some
[13:30] saved people in denominations. Now, as
[13:33] time has gone on, the denominations have
[13:34] got worse and worse. And there's Bible
[13:36] prophecy that says fewer and fewer
[13:38] people will be saved as time goes on
[13:40] because the deception grows worse. I
[13:42] think it's 2 Timothy 3:13. Paul said
[13:44] that in Matthew 7, Jesus said, "Few
[13:46] there be that find the narrow road that
[13:47] leads to life." But yet, there are still
[13:50] some foolish virgins in denominations
[13:52] that can be saved. Let's listen to the
[13:54] quotes. He said, "Well, Brother
[13:57] Brandham, see, he said he's against you
[13:59] assemblies of God. And if assembly
[14:02] minister happens to pick up this tape, I
[14:04] want you to tell me when is I ever
[14:06] against the Assembly of God man or any
[14:08] other man. Why is it when your own
[14:10] headquarters admit that I have sent to
[14:12] you 3/4 of a million of my
[14:15] children, thou begotten to Christ? How
[14:19] am I against the assemblies of
[14:20] God? Why am I against the oneness? I'm
[14:23] not against no one, assemblies of God,
[14:25] church of God, or no man. I'm against
[14:28] every system that separates man. Look, I
[14:32] have sent to the assemblies by their own
[14:34] count three4ers of a million of my own
[14:37] children. If they're so bad, why' I do
[14:40] that? Why? I think it's the best there
[14:43] is in the land to send them to either
[14:46] the oneness or the some of the
[14:47] Pentecostal belief because they believe
[14:49] in divine healing. They believe in the
[14:50] supernatural. They believe in the
[14:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's the
[14:53] best. I can't bring them all right here.
[14:55] They're all over the world. I got
[14:57] friends all over the world, children
[14:58] that I've begotten to Christ. I send
[15:01] them to the best. Do you ever hear me in
[15:03] making an alter call? I send when I get
[15:04] them up there and get them saved, I
[15:05] said, "Now you go to some good full
[15:07] gospel church and get you a church
[15:08] home." How many ever heard me say that?
[15:09] Sure. Sure. Well, why would I send them
[15:11] there then? Would I be a hypocrite to
[15:14] send my own children to
[15:16] death? Or be it for me? No, sir. If you
[15:19] can't go, if you can't come here at the
[15:21] tabernacle, get some church somewhere.
[15:24] Go to it. You don't have to take all
[15:26] they do. What part of bread they're
[15:28] serving? You serve the bread. Well, they
[15:30] got the garlic. Well, you just leave it
[15:32] alone. See, trying. I can't make them.
[15:35] That's exact. Sure. You go to church.
[15:37] Wherever the church door opens, you take
[15:38] off as hard as you can go. If they don't
[15:40] believe what you don't have to partake.
[15:42] Don't join them. Don't join any of them
[15:44] churches, but go to and fellowship with
[15:46] them. How do you know it's not the Lord?
[15:48] He said he make everything work together
[15:49] for the good. And maybe his soul in
[15:51] there ought to be saved, and you can
[15:52] shine the light to them.
[15:55] See, go on down there. Don't go
[15:57] arrogant. Go sweet. The people get say,
[15:59] "That's such a Christian woman, a
[16:01] Christian couple. That's such a
[16:02] Christian boy or girl." I'd like to boy,
[16:05] they really act like they've got
[16:07] something. See, and say, "What is it?
[16:08] Here it is." Then tell them, would you
[16:10] just be salty? They'll get thirsty. Then
[16:13] in paragraph 215, Brother Ram says, "If
[16:16] you can't come here at the tabernacle,
[16:17] get some church somewhere. Go to it. You
[16:21] don't have to take all they do." So,
[16:23] brother Ram says it three or four times,
[16:25] go to church somewhere, don't stay at
[16:27] home. And yet, current Brandham
[16:29] Tabernacle followers will stay at home
[16:31] despite what these quotes say. This
[16:33] shows they have cult mentality. Just
[16:35] like brother Ram said, they're they're
[16:36] one of the awfulst cults. People that
[16:38] don't go to church, people that won't
[16:40] work. And cults often have four
[16:43] characteristics. First, they're
[16:45] close-minded. And that's what the
[16:47] current pastor Brandham Tabernacle says.
[16:49] You don't have time to listen to anybody
[16:50] but brother Brandham because he's so
[16:52] close-minded. He's neglecting the
[16:54] five-fold ministry. Second, they teach
[16:57] blind obedience to authority. And
[16:58] really, their authority is the current
[17:00] pastor of Brandham Tabernacle. It's not
[17:02] brother Brandham because look what these
[17:04] quotes say from brother Brandham.
[17:05] Brother Brham's telling them to go to
[17:06] church. And yet, they don't go to
[17:08] church. So, brother Brandham is not
[17:09] their authority. The only real authority
[17:11] is the Lord Jesus Christ and his holy
[17:13] word that he's given to us. Third, cults
[17:16] do controlled living. Again, the current
[17:19] Brandham Tabernacle pastor tells them,
[17:20] "Don't listen to anything but brother
[17:22] Brandham." Controls their living, tells
[17:24] them to stay at home. He probably tells
[17:25] them other things we're not aware of as
[17:27] well. And fourth, contempt for
[17:30] outsiders. In my video series, the
[17:32] pastor Random Tabernacle says, "Anyone
[17:34] who doesn't press play is a
[17:36] makeeliever." He also calls them names.
[17:39] He also calls them deeis. Anyone who
[17:41] doesn't press play and obey. So that's
[17:43] cult mentality, contempt for outsiders.
[17:47] Finally, let's look at brother Ram's
[17:48] prayer at the end of this sermon.
[17:49] Beautiful prayer. Brother Ram prays for
[17:51] these people out in Arizona that
[17:53] wouldn't go to church and wouldn't work.
[17:55] Again, he humbles himself. He says, he
[17:57] says, "He's just a poor, unworthy,
[17:59] filthy sinner saved by grace." That's
[18:02] how much brother Ram humbled himself.
[18:03] Kind of goes along with that video I put
[18:05] out about Brother Ram calling himself a
[18:06] jellyfish and a son of Kish, not fit to
[18:09] live. Look how brother Ram was so
[18:11] humble. And then, Brother Ram prays for
[18:13] that Arizona group. Help me Lord to
[18:15] gather all them back here somewhere.
[18:18] They want to hear the message with these
[18:20] great teachers as brother Neville. So
[18:23] again, Brother Bram's honoring the
[18:25] five-fold ministry. He's not neglecting
[18:27] the five-fold ministry like the current
[18:28] Brandham tabernacle leadership does. He
[18:31] calls brother Neville a great Bible
[18:33] teacher because he was a living preacher
[18:36] in the five-fold ministry. That's what
[18:38] our prophet said. That's what we
[18:40] believe. Then he names brother Caps. All
[18:42] these brothers here, Juny, Brother
[18:44] Riddle, JT, Brother Collins, Brother
[18:47] Beer, Brother Palmer. God, I pray that
[18:49] you'll just grant this to these. Let
[18:52] them come here where they really hear
[18:54] it. Brother Ram did not pray for them to
[18:57] just play as tapes, just press, play,
[18:59] and obey. He prayed they would come back
[19:00] to the tabernacle to hear living
[19:03] preachers. He said they're trying to do
[19:05] exactly what the scripture told them not
[19:07] to do. And that's exactly what current
[19:09] Brandham tabernacle leadership is doing.
[19:11] They're doing exactly what the scripture
[19:13] says not to do. They're adding to the
[19:15] Bible, adding all their man-made
[19:17] traditions like press, play, and obey.
[19:19] They're taking away the five-fold
[19:20] ministry. They're taking away church
[19:22] attendance. They're doing exactly what
[19:24] the Bible said not to do. Let's listen
[19:27] to the quote. And I pray God that each
[19:29] one of them will be there. Help me Lord
[19:31] to get them all back here something
[19:32] where they can they want to hear the
[19:34] message of these great teachers. Brother
[19:36] Neville and brother Caps and all these
[19:38] other brothers here Junior and brother
[19:40] Ruddle and Hall JT and all them all of
[19:45] them brother Collins and Brother Beer
[19:47] and Brother Palmer and God I pray that
[19:49] you'll just grant this to these let them
[19:52] come here where they really hear it if
[19:54] they want to hear not run off out there
[19:55] in a desert. They're trying to do
[19:58] exactly what the scripture told them not
[20:00] to do. Lo, it's in the desert. Believe
[20:02] it not. Lo, it's in the secret chamber.
[20:05] Believe it not. Lord, I'm trying my best
[20:08] to warn them. But it all indicates that
[20:10] the hour is close now. The evening
[20:13] shadows are falling. And then in the
[20:15] final paragraph for this video, Brother
[20:17] Ram says in his prayer to the Lord have
[20:19] mercy, he said, "Some fanatic to lead
[20:22] some group a cult out into a desert
[20:24] somewhere. Don't let my name have to go
[20:26] down like that, Lord. I fought hard for
[20:29] this. I'm sincere in it as I can be.
[20:31] God, don't let it happen. Now, of
[20:33] course, we know God did let it happen.
[20:35] That group stayed out there. Turned into
[20:37] an awful mess, but they were warned by
[20:39] Brother Brandham. I have a video about
[20:40] that. I have a podcast about that as
[20:42] well. Brother Bram tried to warn them,
[20:44] but they didn't take the warning. But
[20:46] here's where Brother Ram called them a
[20:48] fanatic group and a cult. So, it's cult
[20:52] mentality not to attend church. It's
[20:54] cult mentality not to work. It's a cult
[20:57] mentality to do all these things that
[20:59] the current Brandom Tabernacle is doing.
[21:01] Let's listen to the quote. For mercy,
[21:03] Lord, have mercy on me. Help me. It
[21:04] makes me nervous. Father, I pray that
[21:06] you help me. I I don't want to seal my
[21:09] life, all my work here, but be out
[21:11] you're some fanatic to lead some group
[21:13] of cult out into a desert somewhere.
[21:15] Don't let my name have to go down like
[21:17] that. Lord, I fought hard for this. I'm
[21:20] sincere as I can be. God, don't let it
[21:22] happen. Help me some way. I don't know
[21:25] what to do. I'm just depending on you,
[21:27] but you help me. I'll do anything you
[21:29] tell me to do. I'm your servant. These
[21:31] are your children, Lord. These most of
[21:34] these people, 99 out of every hundred,
[21:36] Lord, is really solid. They believe.
[21:39] They know. They understand. They know
[21:41] it's not
[21:42] me. But I know these things has to
[21:44] follow. Every revival, and this is not
[21:47] immune from it. So, I pray that you'll
[21:49] help us. Now in closing friends, hope
[21:52] this video was a blessing by the grace
[21:54] of God. Please understand all these
[21:55] things are set in brotherly love and
[21:57] kindness. Just trying to protect God's
[21:59] people, help God's people. We started
[22:01] with the Bible foundation, the Bible
[22:03] requirement for church attendance. If
[22:05] you have the love of Jesus in your
[22:07] heart, you can't wait to see the members
[22:09] in your church because they have eternal
[22:11] life. You have eternal life. You both
[22:12] have the love of God. You love each
[22:14] other. Pray for one another. Support one
[22:16] another. Forgive one another. You're a
[22:18] true spiritual family. You're a part of
[22:20] the royal priesthood of the Lord Jesus
[22:22] Christ. But I hope this video makes you
[22:24] go back and listen to questions and
[22:26] answers part one 1964. Such a beautiful
[22:29] message. And look how brother Ram stays
[22:31] with the word of God and even prays for
[22:33] people to come out of their cult
[22:35] mentality. Let's do that. Father God, I
[22:38] just pray for the Brandham Tabernacle
[22:39] Lord, their leadership and all the
[22:40] people. God, may you call the elect out
[22:43] of that denomination, that cult system
[22:46] that they've got themselves mixed up
[22:48] into. Oh God, help them to repent. God,
[22:51] may they come back to faith in the
[22:53] Bible, in the word of God. Help them to
[22:56] stop adding to the Bible. Help them to
[22:57] stop taking away from the Bible. It's my
[23:00] sincere prayer. In the name of the Lord
[23:02] Jesus Christ, I pray.
[23:05] Amen. If you have any questions,
[23:07] concerns, or testimonies about this
[23:08] video, please contact me.
[23:10] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:13] the desire of your heart.
[23:16] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[23:18] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[23:20] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[23:23] good news that Jesus raised from the
[23:25] dead, living among man today, his
[23:28] church. The same Jesus that was
[23:30] yesterday will be today and
[23:33] forever is never failed.
