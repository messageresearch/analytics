[0:00] chapter 4 the mystery of the new
[0:02] testament church as the bride of christ
[0:05] chapter 4 includes footnotes numbers
[0:09] 462-552
[0:12] this is a great mystery but i speak
[0:13] concerning christ and the church
[0:15] ephesians 5
[0:16] verse 32 equipped with the knowledge
[0:20] that both jew and gentile compose the
[0:22] new testament church
[0:23] you will see the necessity for the next
[0:25] revelation of the one church
[0:27] as the bride of jesus christ here you
[0:29] grasp
[0:30] god's ordained position for his people
[0:33] as a she
[0:34] a feminine counterpart to his masculine
[0:37] role
[0:38] with the knowledge of our position comes
[0:39] the revelation of our responsibilities
[0:42] ministries and destiny
[0:46] recall the introduction chapters section
[0:48] on
[0:49] god's hide and seek romance drama your
[0:52] infinite loving lord has chosen you for
[0:54] his mate
[0:56] he has pre-planned your life's events so
[0:58] that you could come to love him
[1:00] accept his gift of salvation and
[1:02] willingly seek his leadership
[1:04] all the days of your life god loves
[1:06] romantic suspense
[1:08] and its fulfillment graciously setting
[1:10] believers
[1:11] as the apple of his eternal eye perhaps
[1:14] no simpler or significant words can be
[1:16] found to describe
[1:17] such unending love as paul says in
[1:20] ephesians 2 verse 4
[1:22] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[1:24] great love wherewith he hath loved
[1:26] us jesus daily pursues you with great
[1:29] love
[1:31] the confusion about the church as the
[1:33] bride of christ
[1:35] the confusion about the new testament
[1:37] church as jesus's bride
[1:39] centers on who she is which group of
[1:42] christians
[1:42] is the true church the evidence is not
[1:45] in what groups say
[1:47] but in the way they live the group's
[1:49] size name or historical accomplishments
[1:52] are not the determining factor in
[1:54] identifying it as christ's bride
[1:57] the character of the people is the
[1:59] determining factor
[2:01] rightly so it has been said that the
[2:03] beauty of a church
[2:04] is the character of its people a
[2:06] church's character is judged by how
[2:08] obedient the members are
[2:10] to jesus's commands indeed the groups
[2:13] that follow paul's apostolic pattern
[2:15] and teachings make up the one true bride
[2:19] the revelation of the mystery of the
[2:21] church as the bride of christ
[2:23] is the true church submits to all of
[2:25] jesus's commands
[2:26] now with the promises of ruling and
[2:28] reigning with her husband
[2:30] in the millennium this chapter shows
[2:32] christ as the husband
[2:34] and the church as the wife along with
[2:36] the attributes that define the true
[2:38] church
[2:39] she is set apart as the bride to christ
[2:42] identified by her complete submission
[2:44] to the apostolic blueprint given to paul
[2:47] by christ
[2:48] the fruits of all major christian groups
[2:50] will be examined by the bible blueprint
[2:53] and identified as either the bride or
[2:55] not
[2:56] you must test every group by its actions
[2:59] jesus says
[3:00] wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
[3:02] them and
[3:03] every tree is known by its fruit every
[3:06] tree
[3:07] or church group is known by its fruit
[3:10] you do not have to wonder if you are in
[3:11] the true church with christ's
[3:13] applied eye salve you can see plainly
[3:17] with jesus spirit of discernment you can
[3:19] prove all things
[3:20] and hold fast that which is good if you
[3:24] possess
[3:24] god's spirit inside you you won't
[3:26] believe every church
[3:28] instead you will try the spirits whether
[3:30] they are of god
[3:31] remember jesus promises his spirit will
[3:34] guide you into all truth as
[3:36] john 16 13 declares how be it when he
[3:40] the spirit of truth is come he will
[3:42] guide you into all truth
[3:43] for he shall not speak of himself but
[3:46] whatsoever he shall hear
[3:47] that shall he speak and he will show you
[3:50] things to come
[3:53] biblical evidence for the revelation
[3:55] about the church
[3:56] as the bride of christ scripture
[3:59] declares jesus christ to be the husband
[4:01] or bridegroom
[4:02] in fact christ himself says he is the
[4:05] bridegroom in mark 2
[4:06] verses 19 and 20. and jesus said unto
[4:09] them
[4:10] can the children of the bride chamber
[4:11] fast while the bridegroom is with them
[4:14] as long as they have the bridegroom with
[4:16] them they cannot fast
[4:18] but the days will come when the
[4:19] bridegroom shall be taken away from them
[4:21] and then shall they fast in those days
[4:24] jesus also identifies himself as the
[4:26] bridegroom in three of his parables
[4:28] see chapter 8 the first is the king's
[4:31] son from matthew 22
[4:33] verses 1 through 14. jesus places
[4:36] himself as the espoused son
[4:38] who awaits believers who will accept the
[4:40] father's invitation
[4:41] to his wedding and wear the appropriate
[4:43] wedding garments
[4:45] in the second parable the 10 virgins
[4:47] found in matthew 25 verses 1-13
[4:51] jesus is likened to the bridegroom whose
[4:53] imminent
[4:54] coming catches five wise virgins fully
[4:57] prepared with oil
[4:59] and five foolish virgins unprepared
[5:02] the foolish miss his wedding due to
[5:04] their neglect
[5:05] thirdly the parable of the great supper
[5:08] in luke 14 verses 15-24
[5:11] portrays christ as the host of a great
[5:13] supper
[5:14] which speaks of the marriage supper of
[5:16] the lamb from revelation 19 verse 9.
[5:19] messiah again connects himself with an
[5:22] upcoming marriage and his position as
[5:24] bridegroom
[5:26] jesus's forerunner john the baptist
[5:29] labels jesus as a husband
[5:31] john emphatically says jesus has a bride
[5:34] providing you with definitive proof that
[5:36] the one
[5:37] jew gentile church is to carry the bride
[5:40] title
[5:41] then john says jesus is the christ and
[5:43] his origin was in heaven
[5:45] in john 3 verses 28 through 31
[5:49] ye yourselves bear me witness that i
[5:51] said i am not the christ
[5:53] but that i am sent before him he that
[5:56] hath the bride is the bridegroom
[5:58] but the friend of the bridegroom which
[6:00] standeth and heareth him
[6:01] rejoiceth greatly because of the
[6:03] bridegroom's voice
[6:05] this my joy therefore is fulfilled
[6:08] he must increase but i must decrease
[6:11] he that cometh from above is above all
[6:14] he that is of the earth
[6:15] is earthly and speaketh of the earth but
[6:18] he that cometh from heaven is above
[6:20] all yes it is logical that christ the
[6:23] husband must have a wife
[6:25] and the new testament church is
[6:26] emphatically identified as his bride
[6:29] the book of revelation mentions jesus
[6:31] bride twice
[6:32] most notable is revelation 22 17
[6:36] in which the bride is speaking with the
[6:38] holy spirit inviting thirsty souls to
[6:40] come and drink of the water of life
[6:43] freely and the spirit and the bride say
[6:46] come and let him that heareth say come
[6:49] and let him that is a thirst come and
[6:51] whosoever will
[6:52] let him take the water of life freely
[6:56] this is the same invitation i am echoing
[6:58] to you
[6:59] in this book the second mention is john
[7:02] being invited by the angel
[7:04] to witness the holy city the new
[7:06] jerusalem descending from heaven upon
[7:08] the earth
[7:09] describing it as a beautifully adorned
[7:11] bride
[7:12] the city is not the bride but the home
[7:15] of the bride and heavenly bridegroom
[7:18] revelation 21 verses 2 and 3 reads
[7:21] and i john saw the holy city new
[7:23] jerusalem
[7:24] coming down from god out of heaven
[7:26] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[7:28] husband
[7:29] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[7:31] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[7:33] with men
[7:34] and he will dwell with them and they
[7:36] shall be his people
[7:38] and god himself shall be with them and
[7:40] be their god
[7:43] god search for a bride in israel then
[7:46] the world
[7:47] god's plan has always been to select a
[7:49] spiritual wife for himself
[7:51] the nation of israel was handpicked by
[7:53] god to be his peculiar treasure
[7:55] because of his love for abraham and his
[7:57] offspring
[7:59] deuteronomy 4 verse 37 and deuteronomy 7
[8:02] verse 8 say god chose them
[8:04] because he loved their fathers and the
[8:06] nation of israel too
[8:08] ezekiel 16 records god's depiction of
[8:11] his loving effort to rescue israel
[8:14] and marry her the lord describes israel
[8:16] as a neglected baby
[8:18] in an open field laying in its own blood
[8:21] he saves her life and nurtures her until
[8:24] she's of marrying age
[8:26] god enters into a marriage covenant with
[8:28] israel
[8:29] she became his clothed and decked in
[8:32] beauty
[8:33] with worldwide renown sadly
[8:36] her pride caused her to become a harlot
[8:38] with every nation she became an idolater
[8:41] and aborted her own children to false
[8:43] gods
[8:44] israel forgot god's grace in rescuing
[8:47] her
[8:48] from her bloody polluted beginning
[8:50] israel would suffer for her sins
[8:52] but ultimately god would forgive her
[8:55] verse 60 says
[8:57] nevertheless i will remember my covenant
[8:59] with thee in the days of thy youth
[9:01] and i will establish unto thee an
[9:03] everlasting covenant
[9:06] israel is now suffering the consequences
[9:08] of her sins in the old testament
[9:10] as well as her rejection of her messiah
[9:12] jesus
[9:14] most jews are blinded to christ by their
[9:16] own unbelief
[9:18] when god cut or broke off the jewish
[9:20] branch he likened it
[9:22] unto a divorce from israel according to
[9:24] jeremiah 3
[9:25] verse 8. and i saw when for all the
[9:28] causes whereby backsliding israel
[9:30] committed adultery i had put her away
[9:33] and given her a bill of divorce
[9:35] yet her treacherous sister judith feared
[9:37] not but went and played the harlot also
[9:42] jeremiah chapter 3 contains the same
[9:44] story as ezekiel 16.
[9:46] verse 14 reads turn o backsliding
[9:48] children
[9:49] saith the lord for i am married unto you
[9:53] israel leaving her husband is taught in
[9:54] verse 20.
[9:56] surely as a wife treacherously departeth
[9:58] from her husband
[9:59] so have ye dealt treacherously with me o
[10:02] house of israel saith the lord
[10:05] yet again god's divine forgiveness is
[10:07] expressed
[10:08] in verse 22 return ye backsliding
[10:11] children
[10:12] and i will heal your backslidings behold
[10:14] we come unto thee
[10:16] for thou art the lord our god
[10:19] the prophet hosea was used by god to
[10:21] portray himself
[10:22] as a faithful husband and israel as an
[10:25] adulterous wife
[10:27] god's prophet was told to marry the
[10:28] harlot gomer to show
[10:30] israel her marital unfaithfulness in
[10:33] hosea 3
[10:34] the prophet buys back or redeems his
[10:37] estranged wife
[10:38] after her period of escapades
[10:41] hosea is confident gomer will now be
[10:44] faithful to him alone
[10:46] and god uses this relationship to affirm
[10:48] that israel
[10:49] will be faithful to him in the latter
[10:51] days this refers to the 144 000
[10:55] jewish remnant who will accept jesus
[10:57] christ as messiah
[10:58] during the tribulation period this will
[11:00] lead to the fulfillment of isaiah 54
[11:03] verse 5 during the millennium
[11:05] when jesus will be israel's husband and
[11:07] lord of the whole earth
[11:09] for thy maker is thine husband the lord
[11:12] of hosts is his name
[11:13] and thy redeemer the holy one of israel
[11:16] the god of the whole earth
[11:17] shall he be called isaiah calls israel
[11:21] married land
[11:22] in isaiah 62 verses 4 and 5.
[11:25] thou shalt no more be termed forsaken
[11:28] neither shall thy land any more be
[11:30] termed
[11:30] desolate but thou shalt be called
[11:33] hefsiba
[11:34] and thy land bula for the lord
[11:37] delighteth in thee
[11:38] and thy land shall be married for as a
[11:40] young man marrieth a virgin
[11:42] so shall thy sons marry thee and as the
[11:45] bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride
[11:47] so shall thy god rejoice over thee
[11:51] god is finally going to have a bride a
[11:53] beautiful jew gentile won
[11:55] and enjoy a joyful 1000 year honeymoon
[11:58] with her
[12:00] jesus was god's incarnation in his
[12:03] search for a faithful mate
[12:04] instead of israel accepting christ as
[12:06] their messiah they demanded his blood be
[12:09] shed and willingly accepted the guilt of
[12:11] his blood upon their race
[12:13] according to matthew 27 verse 25
[12:16] then answered all the people and said
[12:18] his blood be upon
[12:19] us and on our children israel's
[12:22] rejection of jesus
[12:24] was a rejection of being called by his
[12:26] name god then turned to the gentiles to
[12:28] find a bride
[12:29] who wanted to be called by his name just
[12:32] like a natural man marries a wife
[12:34] and she takes his last name james
[12:37] recognizes god's search for a wife
[12:39] among the gentiles in acts 15 verse 14.
[12:43] simeon hath declared how god at the
[12:45] first did visit the gentiles
[12:47] to take out of them a people for his
[12:49] name
[12:50] spiritually speaking god is now looking
[12:52] for a bride that will gladly accept his
[12:54] name
[12:55] and become mrs lord jesus christ
[12:59] just as a natural wife gets a new last
[13:01] name after the wedding
[13:02] christians get their new name after the
[13:04] rapture spiritual wedding
[13:06] marriage supper reception and millennium
[13:10] honeymoon jesus will write our new name
[13:12] upon us
[13:13] according to revelation 3 verse 12. him
[13:16] that overcometh will i make a pillar in
[13:19] the temple of my god
[13:20] and he shall go no more out and i will
[13:23] write upon him the name of my god
[13:25] and the name of the city of my god which
[13:28] is new jerusalem
[13:29] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[13:32] god
[13:32] and i'll write upon him my new name
[13:37] the apostolic blueprint for becoming a
[13:40] bride member
[13:42] you become a bride member when you hear
[13:44] and receive a preacher's anointed
[13:46] message about jesus christ
[13:48] being your lord and savior in second
[13:50] corinthians 11 verse 2
[13:52] paul tells the corinthians he espoused
[13:54] them or engaged them to jesus christ
[13:57] for i am jealous over you with godly
[13:59] jealousy for i've espoused you to one
[14:01] husband
[14:02] that i may present you as a chaste
[14:04] virgin to christ
[14:06] this espousal was affirmed through
[14:09] paul's persuasive preaching ministry
[14:11] recorded in acts 18 verses 1 through 11.
[14:15] spent a year and a half teaching the
[14:17] word of god among them
[14:19] the apostle was like abraham's servant
[14:21] eliezer
[14:23] who was sent to get a bride for isaac
[14:25] eliezer shared
[14:26] the spousal terms with rebecca who
[14:29] eagerly accepted
[14:30] those who eagerly received paul's
[14:32] espousal terms
[14:34] which were given to him by christ
[14:36] immediately became jesus's
[14:37] espoused spiritually virgin bride
[14:41] i must add an important truth at this
[14:43] point bride members are spiritually
[14:46] married when they become christians
[14:48] but not physically married the physical
[14:50] union takes place at the rapture
[14:52] the meeting in the air as paul taught in
[14:55] first thessalonians 4
[14:56] verses 16-17 the engagement starts when
[15:00] you are saved
[15:01] but the marriage ceremony is with christ
[15:03] in the air at the rapture
[15:05] there is also a presentation of christ's
[15:07] bride after the rapture
[15:09] sometime near the marriage supper the
[15:11] lamb recall paul said he would present
[15:13] the corinthians to christ
[15:15] as a chaste virgin some misunderstand
[15:19] paul's teaching in romans 7 verse 4
[15:21] which says
[15:22] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[15:25] dead to the law by the body of christ
[15:27] that ye should be married to another
[15:30] even to him who is raised from the dead
[15:32] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[15:34] god
[15:36] yes you are spiritually married to
[15:37] christ by the vow in your heart
[15:39] but you are not physically with your
[15:41] husband his spirit is inside you
[15:44] like an engagement vow lives in your
[15:45] heart but his nail-scarred body is not
[15:48] with you
[15:49] like rebecca traveling upon her camel to
[15:51] meet isaac
[15:52] you are on your earthly journey to meet
[15:54] your husband but the wedding is yet in
[15:56] the future
[15:57] the baptism of the holy ghost is your
[15:59] power or camel
[16:01] carrying you to meet your bridegroom
[16:03] just water the camel
[16:05] and you'll make it water the holy spirit
[16:07] with praise and worship
[16:09] and you'll meet jesus in the air once
[16:12] rebecca saw isaac face to face
[16:14] she never left him when you finally see
[16:16] jesus face to face
[16:18] you'll ever be with the lord first
[16:20] corinthians 13 verse 12 reads
[16:22] for now we see through a glass darkly
[16:24] but then face to face
[16:26] now i know in part but then shall i know
[16:29] even as
[16:30] also i am known you are officially
[16:32] married to jesus
[16:33] when you have a body like his paul
[16:35] writes this in philippians 3
[16:37] verses 20 and 21 for our conversation is
[16:41] in heaven
[16:41] for whence also we look for the savior
[16:44] the lord jesus christ
[16:45] who shall change our body that it may be
[16:48] fashioned like unto his glorious body
[16:50] according to the working whereby he is
[16:52] able even to subdue
[16:54] all things unto himself first john 3
[16:57] verse 2
[16:58] also promises beloved now are we the
[17:01] sons of god
[17:02] and it doth not yet appear what we shall
[17:04] be
[17:05] but we know that when he shall appear we
[17:08] shall be like him
[17:09] for we shall see him as he is
[17:12] apply paul's corinthian blueprint to the
[17:14] day of pentecost
[17:15] when three thousand souls were espoused
[17:17] to christ through peter's sermon
[17:20] observe acts 2 verses 41 through 47
[17:24] and see how faithfully the bride
[17:25] assembled hungry for true teaching and
[17:28] worship
[17:29] and enthusiastic to help each other with
[17:31] physical needs
[17:32] then they that gladly received his word
[17:34] were baptized
[17:35] and the same day they were added unto
[17:37] them about three thousand souls
[17:39] and they continued steadfastly in the
[17:41] apostles doctrine and fellowship
[17:43] and in breaking of bread and in prayers
[17:46] and fear came upon every soul
[17:48] and many wonders and signs were done by
[17:50] the apostles
[17:51] and all that believed were together and
[17:53] had all things common
[17:54] and sold their possessions and goods and
[17:56] parted them to all men
[17:58] as every man had need and they
[18:01] continuing daily with one accord in the
[18:03] temple
[18:04] and breaking bread from house to house
[18:06] did eat their meat with gladness and
[18:08] singleness of heart
[18:09] praising god and having favor with all
[18:11] the people
[18:12] and the lord added to the church daily
[18:15] as should be saved
[18:17] every new bride member became a new
[18:18] creature in christ jesus
[18:20] each left their previous sinful way of
[18:23] life
[18:24] whether it was the curse of trying to
[18:25] save oneself through moses's law
[18:28] or a licentious lustful lifestyle
[18:31] jesus charged paul to direct sinners out
[18:34] of the darkness
[18:35] and into the light of being a forgiven
[18:38] bride member
[18:39] in acts 26 18 to open their eyes
[18:43] and to turn them from darkness to light
[18:45] and from the power of satan unto god
[18:48] that they may receive forgiveness of
[18:50] sins and inheritance among them which
[18:52] are sanctified by faith
[18:54] that is in me paul knew this same
[18:56] dramatic joy of coming to christ
[18:59] he compared his previous life to dung
[19:01] while affirming the
[19:02] excellency of being a bride member in
[19:04] philippians 3 verse 8.
[19:07] yea doubtless and i count all things but
[19:09] lost for the excellency of the knowledge
[19:11] of christ jesus my lord
[19:13] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[19:15] things but do count them but
[19:17] dung that i may win christ
[19:21] paul once a violent blasphemer taught
[19:24] his miraculous salvation experience
[19:26] was a pattern to all future bride
[19:28] members
[19:29] in 1st timothy 1 verses 13 through 16
[19:33] who was before a blasphemer and a
[19:35] persecutor
[19:36] and injurious but i obtained mercy
[19:39] because i did it ignorantly in
[19:41] unbelief and the grace of our lord was
[19:43] exceeding
[19:44] abundant with faith and love which is in
[19:46] christ jesus
[19:48] this is a faithful saying and worthy of
[19:50] all acceptation
[19:52] that christ jesus came into the world to
[19:54] save sinners
[19:55] of whom i am chief how be it for this
[19:58] cause i obtain mercy
[19:59] that in me first jesus christ might show
[20:02] forth all longsuffering
[20:03] for a pattern to them which should
[20:05] hereafter believe on him
[20:07] to life everlasting the apostle paul
[20:11] embarked on three missionary trips to
[20:13] espouse
[20:14] more bride members to christ and
[20:16] repeatedly operated
[20:18] according to his blueprint first he
[20:21] would win new converts
[20:22] then he would spend significant time
[20:24] teaching them christ's word
[20:26] finally before leaving he would ordain
[20:29] faithful men as elders and leaders
[20:31] to oversee the converts the blueprint is
[20:34] most clearly seen on his first
[20:35] missionary journey
[20:37] in acts 14 verses 21-23
[20:41] and when they had preached the gospel to
[20:43] that city and had taught many
[20:45] they returned again to lystra and
[20:47] iconium
[20:48] and antioch confirming the souls of the
[20:50] disciples
[20:52] and exhorting them to continue in the
[20:53] faith and that we must through much
[20:56] tribulation
[20:56] enter into the kingdom of god and when
[20:58] they had ordained
[20:59] them elders in every church and had
[21:02] prayed with fasting
[21:03] they commended them to the lord on whom
[21:05] they believed
[21:07] paul's letters record his instructions
[21:09] to preachers
[21:10] titus and timothy to keep the same
[21:12] blueprint for all christian churches
[21:15] both men learned paul's requirements for
[21:16] pastors
[21:18] also called elders or bishops and
[21:20] deacons
[21:21] in titus 1 verses 6 through 9
[21:24] and 1st timothy 3 verses 1 through 13.
[21:28] the apostle told titus to set the
[21:30] churches in order by ordaining elders in
[21:33] every city
[21:35] for this cause left i thee in crete that
[21:37] thou should ascend order the things that
[21:39] are wanting
[21:40] and ordain elders in every city as i had
[21:43] appointed thee
[21:44] timothy was instructed to pass down
[21:46] god's revelations
[21:48] to faithful men in 2 timothy 2 verses
[21:51] 1 and 2. thou therefore my son be strong
[21:54] in the grace that is in christ jesus
[21:56] and the things that thou has heard of me
[21:58] among many witnesses
[22:00] the same commit thou to faithful men who
[22:02] shall be able to teach
[22:03] others also these scriptures give you
[22:06] god's blueprint for how people become
[22:08] bride members
[22:09] through genuine missionary work how
[22:11] their churches grow
[22:12] and how to make more bride members
[22:17] the unchanging gospel blueprint
[22:20] it's imperative to show paul's
[22:22] indictment upon anyone who would change
[22:25] even one word
[22:26] of the revelations jesus taught him
[22:29] curses were to come upon anyone
[22:31] who changed jesus's blueprint or pattern
[22:34] for saving
[22:35] teaching and harvesting future bride
[22:37] members
[22:38] according to galatians 1 verses 6
[22:41] through 12
[22:42] i marvel that ye are so soon removed
[22:44] from him
[22:45] that called you into the grace of christ
[22:48] unto another gospel
[22:49] which is not another but there be some
[22:52] that trouble you and would pervert the
[22:53] gospel of christ
[22:55] but though we or an angel from heaven
[22:57] preach any other gospel
[22:58] unto you than that which we have
[23:00] preached unto you
[23:02] let him be accursed as we said before
[23:05] so say i now again if any man preach any
[23:08] other gospel unto you
[23:10] then that ye have received let him be
[23:12] accursed
[23:13] for do i now persuade men or god or do i
[23:16] seek to please men
[23:18] for if i yet please men i should not be
[23:20] the servant of christ
[23:21] but i certify you brethren that the
[23:23] gospel which was preached of me is not
[23:25] after man
[23:26] for i neither received it of man neither
[23:28] was i taught it
[23:29] but by the revelation of jesus christ
[23:33] every word paul was given by christ to
[23:35] write and share
[23:36] with the churches must be obeyed paul
[23:39] was faithful in teaching the whole
[23:41] council of god
[23:42] to every church he started or visited
[23:45] first corinthians 4 verse 17
[23:47] says for this cause have i sent unto you
[23:50] timotheus who is my beloved son and
[23:53] faithful in the lord
[23:55] who shall bring you into remembrance of
[23:56] my ways which be in christ
[23:59] as i teach everywhere in every church
[24:02] every bride church heard the same
[24:04] complete gospel from paul
[24:07] paul told the ephesians in acts 20 verse
[24:09] 27
[24:10] that they heard the full counsel of god
[24:12] and thereby were responsible for it
[24:15] for i have not shunned to declare unto
[24:16] you all the counsel of god
[24:19] bride members will not change one word
[24:21] of jesus's revelation
[24:23] given to paul they know there is only
[24:25] one faith
[24:26] according to ephesians 4 verse 5 and
[24:29] jude 3 says it is the one and only faith
[24:32] we must earnestly contend for timothy
[24:35] received a direct charge from paul
[24:37] to keep every word of god in first
[24:39] timothy 6
[24:41] verses 13 and 14. i give thee charge in
[24:44] the sight of god
[24:45] who quickeneth all things and before
[24:47] christ jesus
[24:48] who before pontius pilate witnessed a
[24:50] good confession
[24:52] that thou keep this commandment without
[24:54] spot unrebukable
[24:56] unto the appearing of our lord jesus
[24:58] christ
[24:59] paul wept while writing the philippians
[25:01] from prison
[25:02] due to the enemies of the cross who live
[25:05] contrary to his example
[25:06] and teachings in philippians 3 verses
[25:10] 17-19
[25:11] brethren be followers together of me and
[25:14] mark them which walk so
[25:16] as ye have us for an end sample for many
[25:19] walk
[25:20] of whom i have told you often and now
[25:22] tell you even weeping
[25:24] that they are the enemies of the cross
[25:25] of christ whose end is destruction
[25:28] whose god is their belly and whose glory
[25:31] is in their shame who mind earthly
[25:34] things
[25:35] paul rebuked false teachers by saying
[25:37] their false doctrines
[25:38] spread like gangrene destroying the
[25:41] faith of potential bride members
[25:43] in second timothy 2 verses 16 through 18
[25:47] but shun profane and vain babblings for
[25:49] they will increase
[25:50] unto more ungodliness and their word
[25:53] will eat as doth a canker
[25:55] of whom is hymenus and felidus
[25:59] who concerning the truth have aired
[26:01] saying that the resurrection is past
[26:03] already
[26:04] and overthrow the faith of some
[26:07] jesus solomon and john support paul's
[26:10] insistence for believing all of god's
[26:13] word without adding or taking anything
[26:15] away
[26:16] christ says god's word will never pass
[26:18] away in matthew 24
[26:20] 35 heaven and earth shall pass away
[26:23] but my words shall not pass away solomon
[26:26] teaches god will call
[26:27] men and women liars who add to or delete
[26:30] from
[26:31] his commands in proverbs 30 verses 5 and
[26:34] 6
[26:35] every word of god is pure he is a shield
[26:38] unto them that put their trust in him
[26:40] add thou not unto his words lest he
[26:42] reprove thee
[26:43] and thou be found a liar john warns
[26:46] those who would add or delete from the
[26:48] bible
[26:49] urging strict adherents to all god's
[26:51] words
[26:52] in revelation 22 verses 18 and 19
[26:56] for i testify unto every man that
[26:58] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[27:00] this book
[27:01] if any man shall add unto these things
[27:04] god shall add unto him the plagues that
[27:06] are written in this book
[27:07] and if any man shall take away from the
[27:09] words of the book of this prophecy
[27:11] god shall take away his part out of the
[27:13] book of life
[27:14] and out of the holy city and from the
[27:16] things which are written
[27:17] in this book let god's word be your
[27:20] absolute
[27:21] your final word your unlimited source of
[27:24] strength
[27:25] let god be true and any word of man
[27:28] contrary to it
[27:29] a lie romans 3 verse 4 declares
[27:32] god forbid yea let god be true but every
[27:35] man a liar
[27:36] as it is written that thou mightest be
[27:39] justified in thy sayings
[27:40] and might overcome when thou art judged
[27:45] the bride submissive character to every
[27:47] word of christ
[27:49] in ephesians 5 verses 22 through 33
[27:52] paul uses the husband and wife imagery
[27:55] to express
[27:55] five attributes christ desires in his
[27:58] bride
[27:59] a woman is often used in scripture to
[28:01] represent a church
[28:02] or even a nation ezekiel 16 verse 7
[28:06] shows god calling israel a woman and
[28:09] acts 7
[28:10] 38 says moses was part of the church in
[28:12] the wilderness
[28:14] as proven earlier by numerous scriptures
[28:16] jesus church
[28:17] is also called a bride paul's purpose
[28:20] for this
[28:21] ephesians text is found in verse 32.
[28:25] this is a great mystery but i speak
[28:27] concerning christ
[28:28] and the church here you find the
[28:30] revelation of the true bride's
[28:32] christian character the first attribute
[28:35] is christ is the one and only head of
[28:37] the church
[28:38] as ephesians 5 verse 23 says
[28:41] for the husband is the head of the wife
[28:43] even as christ
[28:44] is the head of the church and he is the
[28:46] savior of the body
[28:48] john 1 verse 1 says jesus is the word
[28:51] meaning the true revelation of the bible
[28:53] bride members declared jesus spirit
[28:56] which wrote his word the bible is their
[28:59] only headship
[29:00] sadly most churches are headed up by
[29:03] man-made creeds
[29:04] bylaws and traditions that contradict
[29:07] the revelation
[29:08] jesus gave to paul the word doesn't rule
[29:11] them
[29:12] the conditions today match those of
[29:14] jesus day
[29:15] as the pharisees had exalted their
[29:17] man-made interpretations
[29:19] above moses's law one example is jesus
[29:22] rebuking them harshly
[29:24] for mistreating their elderly parents
[29:26] making the tradition
[29:27] of not supporting their parents their
[29:29] headship instead of moses's teaching
[29:32] but he answered and said unto them why
[29:34] do ye also transgress the commandment of
[29:37] god
[29:37] by your tradition this people draw thy
[29:40] unto me with their mouth
[29:41] and honor me with their lips but their
[29:44] heart is far from me
[29:45] but in vain they do worship me teaching
[29:48] for doctrines
[29:48] the commandments of men many examples
[29:52] can be given to show how churches
[29:54] reject jesus's headship for both
[29:56] ministers and lay members
[29:58] but here are just 10 of the most sinful
[30:00] teachings churches promote
[30:02] homosexual relationships yet paul's
[30:05] revelation
[30:06] condemns these as abominable romans 1
[30:09] verses 26 through 32
[30:11] first corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11
[30:14] 1st timothy 1
[30:15] verses 10 and 11 adulterous
[30:18] relationships
[30:20] couples married more than once yet
[30:22] paul's revelation demands marriage
[30:24] last until death and warns that
[30:26] adulterers
[30:27] will not inherit god's kingdom romans 7
[30:30] verses 1 through 3
[30:32] first corinthians 6 verses 9 and 10
[30:36] murdering babies through abortion and
[30:38] birth control pills
[30:39] yet paul's revelation says murders will
[30:41] not inherit god's kingdom
[30:43] according to galatians 5 verse 21
[30:47] women preachers yet paul's revelation
[30:49] forbids any woman from teaching a man
[30:52] first corinthians 14 verses 34 through
[30:55] 36
[30:56] first timothy 2 verses 11 through 15.
[31:00] substance abuse smoking cigarettes
[31:03] drunkenness
[31:04] etc yet paul's revelation
[31:07] says these acts defile the body the
[31:09] temple of the holy ghost
[31:11] and should not be done as long as the
[31:13] world stands
[31:14] romans 14 verse 21 first corinthians 3
[31:18] verse 17 chapter 6 verses 19 and 20
[31:22] and chapter 8 verse 13.
[31:25] viewing sinful movies and television
[31:27] shows yet paul's revelation was to avoid
[31:30] all appearance of evil first
[31:31] thessalonians 5
[31:33] verse 22 shameful hair lengths
[31:37] women cutting their hair and men growing
[31:39] long hair
[31:40] yet paul says women should never cut
[31:42] their hair and men should keep theirs
[31:44] short first corinthians 11 verses 1-16
[31:49] false conversions saying converts are
[31:52] filled with the spirit
[31:53] and initial confession or working
[31:55] miracles is proof of salvation
[31:58] yet paul's revelation is that you must
[32:00] continue believing
[32:01] and you will receive the holy ghost
[32:03] sometime after you initially believe
[32:06] matthew 7 verse 21 through 23
[32:09] acts 19 verses 1 through 7 galatians 4
[32:12] verse 19
[32:14] ephesians 1 verse 13. in modest clothing
[32:18] sexy revealing outfits yet paul commands
[32:22] modest clothing
[32:23] in 1st timothy 2 verse 9.
[32:27] surely you can see jesus christ and his
[32:29] word are not the head
[32:31] of most churches concerning these ten
[32:34] teachings
[32:34] they are completely one-sided and have
[32:37] no examples of god allowing them
[32:39] you'll never find homosexual
[32:40] relationships celebrated in god's
[32:43] eternal word
[32:44] nor will you find a godly woman
[32:46] preaching or cutting her hair
[32:48] may you follow the spirits leading to
[32:50] assemble with bride members
[32:52] who give jesus his rightful place as
[32:54] head of the church
[32:56] who do you know that loves jesus so much
[32:59] they obey god's word
[33:00] in all 10 of these areas
[33:04] a second bright attribute is complete
[33:06] submission in
[33:07] everything verse 24 says
[33:10] the church is subject to christ in
[33:13] everything
[33:14] bride members are happy to read the
[33:15] bible with a desire to know more of
[33:17] god's will
[33:19] so that they might obey it their goal is
[33:21] to live like jesus
[33:23] who knew man does not live by bread
[33:25] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[33:28] out of the mouth of god obeying her
[33:30] husband is not a grievous task
[33:32] for the bride because she is born again
[33:35] as first john
[33:36] 5 verses 3 and 4 teach for this is the
[33:39] love of god
[33:40] that we keep his commandments and his
[33:42] commandments are not grievous
[33:44] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[33:47] the world
[33:48] and this is the victory that overcometh
[33:50] the world even
[33:51] our faith the bride's goal is total
[33:54] submission to her husband
[33:56] in all things she wants to be holy
[33:58] because jesus is holy
[34:00] as peter declares as obedient children
[34:03] not fashioning yourselves according to
[34:05] the former lusts
[34:07] in your ignorance but as he which hath
[34:09] called you is holy
[34:10] so be ye holy in all manner of
[34:12] conversation
[34:14] because it is written be ye holy for i
[34:17] am holy
[34:19] a third bright attribute is submission
[34:21] to christ's washing process
[34:23] ephesians 5 verse 26 reads that he might
[34:26] sanctify
[34:27] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[34:30] by the word
[34:31] jesus cleanses your life as you hear his
[34:33] word and obey it
[34:35] first peter 1 verse 22 says you are
[34:37] purified
[34:38] in obeying the truth through the spirit
[34:40] acts 22
[34:41] 16 says paul's sins were washed away
[34:44] at his repentance and water baptism we
[34:47] know
[34:48] water itself cannot forgive sins but
[34:50] rather paul's obedience caused god to
[34:52] forgive him
[34:54] overcoming sin in the midst of
[34:55] persecution and temptation
[34:58] is the washing process the bride goes
[35:00] through
[35:01] according to revelation 1 verse 5 and 7
[35:03] verse 14
[35:05] jesus washes his bride by anointing
[35:07] preachers
[35:08] to share his word which cleanses the
[35:10] hearers
[35:11] first corinthians 1 verse 18 declares
[35:13] preaching
[35:14] is the power of god unto salvation
[35:17] jesus's five preaching gifts
[35:19] apostle prophet pastor teacher and
[35:21] evangelist
[35:22] perfect edify and unify his bride
[35:27] the reason most churches do not get
[35:29] washed is because they do not preach and
[35:31] obey all of paul's revelation
[35:33] as shown by the 10 bulleted examples
[35:35] above
[35:36] upon obeying jesus's commands your mind
[35:39] is renewed
[35:40] or washed paul validates this in
[35:43] ephesians 4
[35:44] verses 22 through 32 and titus 3
[35:48] verses 3 through 8. verse 5 and titus 3
[35:51] says christians are saved
[35:53] by the washing of regeneration and
[35:55] renewing of the holy ghost
[35:58] as christ's bride you must be constantly
[36:00] washed and prepared
[36:02] for your wedding day your great day of
[36:04] presentation to your husband
[36:06] the word being joined
[36:09] or glued to in the greek lexicon to
[36:12] christ is the bride's fourth attribute
[36:14] according to ephesians 5 verse 31 for
[36:17] this cause shall a man leave his
[36:19] father and mother and shall be joined
[36:21] unto his wife
[36:22] and they too shall be one flesh
[36:25] jesus's true bride is glued to his
[36:27] fellowship and that of his people
[36:30] christians are to constantly meditate
[36:31] upon the lord speaking to him
[36:34] in unceasing prayer the bride will also
[36:37] gather with other believers
[36:38] and their physical gathering will
[36:40] increase as jesus's second coming nears
[36:44] hebrews 10 verses 24 and 25 explains
[36:47] and let us consider one another to
[36:49] provoke unto love
[36:50] and to good works not forsaking the
[36:53] assembling of ourselves together
[36:55] as the manner of some is but exhorting
[36:57] one another
[36:58] and so much the more as you see the day
[37:00] approaching
[37:02] you cannot separate the bride from her
[37:04] husband nor from her spiritual family
[37:07] many church members are glued to their
[37:08] sinful television shows
[37:10] movies and sports too busy to fellowship
[37:13] with christ
[37:14] and his church the fifth bride attribute
[37:18] is the attitude of reverence
[37:19] as ephesians 5 verse 33 commands
[37:23] nevertheless let every one of you in
[37:25] particular so love his wife
[37:27] even as himself and the wife see that
[37:29] she reverence her husband
[37:31] reverence means to be in awe of in the
[37:34] greek
[37:35] just speaking your husband's name is a
[37:37] sacred
[37:38] hollowed thing to the bride her husband
[37:41] is great in her eyes
[37:42] causing her to be meek and humble she is
[37:45] careful which words come out of her
[37:46] mouth
[37:47] possessing quiet strength bride members
[37:50] own the treasure
[37:52] of a meek and quiet spirit just as
[37:54] natural wives should
[37:56] but let it be the hidden man of the
[37:57] heart and that which is not corruptable
[38:00] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[38:02] spirit which is in the sight of god
[38:04] of great price paul closes ephesians 5
[38:08] by reminding men to love their wives so
[38:11] i will close this section by reminding
[38:13] you
[38:13] of jesus's love for you paul says god
[38:17] has great love for
[38:18] you and he also lists 17 things that
[38:20] cannot separate us from christ's love
[38:23] in romans 8 verses 35 through 39
[38:27] jesus's commands for his bride are for
[38:29] her good
[38:30] her safety protection provision and
[38:33] growth
[38:34] romans 8 verse 28 says all things not
[38:37] some
[38:38] work together for good to them that love
[38:40] the lord
[38:41] this is forever christ's purpose for his
[38:43] commands our good
[38:45] god told the same to moses in
[38:47] deuteronomy 6
[38:48] verses 24 and 25 and the lord commanded
[38:52] us to do all these statutes
[38:54] to fear the lord our god for our good
[38:56] always
[38:57] that he might preserve us alive as it is
[39:00] at this day
[39:01] and it shall be our righteousness if we
[39:04] observe to do all these commandments
[39:06] before the lord our god as he hath
[39:08] commanded us
[39:10] your husband's commands will always work
[39:12] for your benefit
[39:14] your obedience to jesus is the greatest
[39:16] expression of your love for him
[39:18] for he delights in obedience more than
[39:20] sacrifice
[39:22] jesus pleads if ye love me keep my
[39:25] commands
[39:27] keep the true bride's attributes in mind
[39:29] because chapter 9
[39:30] unveils the sinful attributes of the
[39:33] false bride
[39:34] the mother harlot
[39:37] judging christian groups and
[39:39] denominations by their fruits
[39:42] based upon paul's bride attributes the
[39:45] holy spirit helps us judge
[39:47] christian groups by their fruits you can
[39:50] know a person's purity by their actions
[39:52] you might use the word discern instead
[39:54] of judge but they mean the same thing
[39:57] it is necessary for you to prove all
[39:59] things
[40:00] and test every spirit jesus specifically
[40:03] warns
[40:04] us of men false prophets matthew 24
[40:07] verse 4 states
[40:09] and jesus answered and said unto them
[40:11] take heed that no man deceive you
[40:15] please understand the following
[40:16] judgments upon church groups
[40:18] are not eternal judgments as only god
[40:21] judges eternal destinations
[40:23] i am only judging each church's
[40:25] adherence to paul's revelation from
[40:27] jesus christ
[40:28] as well as the rest of the holy bible
[40:31] with the internet
[40:32] it's easier than ever to judge churches
[40:34] through their online statements of faith
[40:37] jesus instructs us to judge
[40:39] individuals and situations with
[40:42] righteous judgment
[40:43] in john 7 24 judge not according to the
[40:47] appearance
[40:48] but judge righteous judgment paul's
[40:50] prayer for the philippians
[40:52] is for them to approve holy things as
[40:54] they grew in judgment
[40:56] in philippians 1 verses 9 and 10.
[40:59] and this i pray that your love may
[41:01] abound yet more and more
[41:03] in knowledge and in all judgment that ye
[41:06] may approve
[41:07] things that are excellent that ye may be
[41:09] sincere and without offense
[41:11] till the day of christ the hebrews
[41:14] writer states mature christians
[41:16] skillfully discern or judge between good
[41:18] and evil
[41:20] baby christians refuse to judge right
[41:22] and wrong
[41:23] for when for the time you ought to be
[41:24] teachers ye have need that one teach you
[41:27] again
[41:28] which be the first principles of the
[41:29] oracles of god
[41:31] and are become such as have need of milk
[41:34] and not of strong meat
[41:36] for everyone that uses milk is
[41:37] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[41:40] for he is a babe but strong meat
[41:42] belongeth to them that are of
[41:44] full age even those who by reason of use
[41:48] have their senses exercised to discern
[41:50] both good and evil
[41:53] in 2010 the pew research center
[41:55] estimated the following sizes
[41:57] for christian groups that combined for
[42:00] about 2.5
[42:01] billion members worldwide as you read
[42:04] through this list consider which group
[42:06] keeps all 10 doctrines listed earlier
[42:09] along with the rest of god's commands
[42:12] roman catholic 1.3 billion protestant
[42:16] 900 million eastern orthodox
[42:19] 270 million anglican 110 million
[42:23] oriental orthodox 62 million
[42:27] all others 37 million
[42:31] if you are thinking none of these named
[42:33] groups keep all 10 doctrines
[42:35] you are right they are guilty of either
[42:38] adding to
[42:39] god's word or taking away from it it is
[42:41] with love and compassion
[42:43] that i claim all these churches are
[42:45] guilty of transgressing jesus commands
[42:48] jesus says we must do his commands if he
[42:51] truly is our lord
[42:52] in luke 6 46 and why call ye me lord
[42:56] lord
[42:57] and do not the things which i say friend
[43:00] this is a serious subject before we
[43:03] examine these denominational groups
[43:05] remember the bride church will not have
[43:07] creeds bylaws or traditions
[43:09] that contradict paul's revelation for
[43:12] they are cursed if they do
[43:15] in addition to the ten doctrines already
[43:17] listed the following
[43:18] further illustrate how the bride church
[43:20] keeps all of god's commands
[43:22] as a woman separate from all church
[43:24] systems
[43:26] water baptisms are performed as full
[43:28] immersions in water
[43:30] calling upon the name of the lord jesus
[43:32] christ not by sprinkling
[43:34] and not by speaking the titles father
[43:36] son and holy spirit
[43:38] acts 2 verse 38 acts 8 16
[43:42] acts 10 48 acts 19 verse 5
[43:45] and acts 22 16. believers are taught to
[43:49] receive the baptism of the holy ghost in
[43:51] their souls
[43:52] the third work of grace after
[43:54] justification and sanctification
[43:57] matthew 11 29 mark 4 verses 26 through
[44:01] 28
[44:02] john 17 verse 17 john 20 verse 22
[44:06] acts chapter 1 verse 5 and acts chapter
[44:09] 19 verses 1-7
[44:12] god is known as one person not three
[44:14] persons
[44:15] job 13 verse 8 thus the trinity dogma is
[44:19] wrong
[44:20] god says he is the only god and there is
[44:22] no one beside him
[44:24] in isaiah 43 verse 11 and isaiah 44
[44:27] verses 6 through 8
[44:29] jesus is the image of the invisible god
[44:31] the express
[44:32] image of his person colossians 1 15
[44:36] hebrews 1 verse 3.
[44:39] men and women wear separate garments
[44:41] because cross-dressing
[44:43] transgender movement is an abomination
[44:46] to god
[44:47] deuteronomy 22 verse 5. this means men
[44:50] only will wear pants
[44:52] women will abstain from wearing men's
[44:54] garments
[44:55] pants even if they are women's pants
[44:58] and wear modest skirts and dresses
[45:02] supernatural power currently operates
[45:04] all nine gifts of the holy ghost
[45:06] mark 16 verses 16-18
[45:10] first corinthians 12 verses 1 through
[45:12] 11.
[45:14] beginning with roman catholics chapter 9
[45:17] explores the depths of their wicked
[45:18] doctrines
[45:19] they confess god is three separate
[45:21] co-equal persons
[45:23] which is polytheism they consider their
[45:25] communion wafer
[45:26] to be the literal body of the crucified
[45:28] jesus
[45:29] which is idolatrous fantasy mary is
[45:33] exalted higher than christ
[45:34] for she is called the mother of god
[45:37] women cut their hair and wear men's
[45:38] clothing
[45:39] with just these few examples roman
[45:41] catholics cannot be the bride
[45:45] most protestants confess a three-person
[45:47] god and permit adulterous marriages
[45:50] cross-dressing women wearing pants and
[45:53] women cutting their hair
[45:55] excluding them from being bride going
[45:57] further
[45:58] most baptists claim you are filled with
[46:00] the holy ghost at repentance
[46:02] denying the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:05] and
[46:05] allow women preachers their loud
[46:08] cheering at sporting events
[46:09] is louder than their praises in church
[46:12] manifesting their idolatry
[46:14] they are not the bride lutherans often
[46:16] allow members to drink
[46:18] alcohol heavily permit adulterous
[46:20] remarriages
[46:21] and have no modesty standards they
[46:23] cannot be the bride
[46:25] seventh-day adventists make sabbath
[46:27] keeping the evidence for being born
[46:29] again
[46:29] which is just as erroneous as
[46:32] pentecostals
[46:33] teaching speaking in tongues is the
[46:34] evidence
[46:36] you cannot emphasize the gift tongues
[46:39] more than the giver
[46:40] the holy spirit those groups cannot be
[46:42] the bride
[46:44] jehovah's witnesses deny supernatural
[46:46] healings
[46:47] they cannot be the bride mormons teacher
[46:49] born again
[46:50] after baptism allow women to cut their
[46:53] hair
[46:53] and add an entire testament to the bible
[46:56] the book of mormon
[46:57] which carries severe punishments on
[46:59] judgment day
[47:01] mormons are not christ's bride similar
[47:04] discernments
[47:04] for each church group could be made in
[47:07] order to prove who is bride and who
[47:09] isn't
[47:11] eastern orthodoxy erroneously exalts
[47:14] tradition to be equal with scripture
[47:16] celebrates the eucharist intercedes for
[47:18] the dead
[47:19] and venerates icons despite being
[47:23] orthodox by
[47:24] name this group is not jesus's bride nor
[47:27] are anglicans and oriental orthodox
[47:30] anglicans recite three powerless creeds
[47:33] the apostles creed
[47:34] nicean creed and athanasian creed
[47:37] and declare christ's real presence is in
[47:39] the eucharist
[47:41] oriental orthodox deny jesus's dual
[47:43] nature
[47:44] human and divine and require sacraments
[47:47] for salvation
[47:49] these few examples prove we are living
[47:52] in the time of the great falling away
[47:54] or the apostasy most churches have
[47:56] fallen away from paul's teachings
[47:59] but remember jesus will have a bride
[48:01] church and she will allow him to wash
[48:03] her with the waters of his word
[48:05] week in and week out preaching service
[48:08] after preaching service
[48:10] not for a moment do i say there are no
[48:12] saved believers in these groups listed
[48:14] above
[48:15] as god has children in every
[48:17] organization
[48:18] god doesn't accept organizations only
[48:21] sincere individuals within them
[48:23] but the saved in these organizations
[48:25] cannot be born again
[48:27] holy ghost-filled bride members if they
[48:30] are part of any church
[48:31] that rejects even a portion of god's
[48:34] word
[48:35] this is true because god searches the
[48:37] world for genuine worshipers
[48:39] who fear him through worshiping him in
[48:41] the spirit and truth
[48:43] bride members may start their christian
[48:45] journey in the false churches
[48:47] but then the lord calls them out of
[48:49] false church systems
[48:51] saying come out of her my people that ye
[48:53] be not partakers of her sins
[48:56] and that ye receive not of her plagues
[48:58] one major purpose of being born again
[49:01] is for jesus to lead you into all truth
[49:03] so staying in a church that allows sin
[49:06] is against jesus's nature he sends his
[49:08] spirit with the intent
[49:10] to separate his bride from those who
[49:12] love pleasures
[49:13] more than god jesus says there are three
[49:17] kinds of christians
[49:19] workers of iniquity imposters
[49:22] foolish and wise chapters 8 and 12 focus
[49:26] on this subject
[49:27] but for now you must know that workers
[49:29] of iniquity have
[49:30] gifts to perform miracles under the true
[49:33] anointing of the spirit
[49:34] but their souls are void of god's
[49:36] anointing
[49:38] these impostors enjoy working in god's
[49:40] spirit for financial and selfish gain
[49:43] therefore they are lost foolish virgins
[49:46] will be saved at the white throne
[49:48] judgment
[49:48] but will miss the rapture marriage
[49:50] supper the lamb
[49:51] and millennium because they fail to
[49:54] prepare oil
[49:55] for the tearing bridegroom this means
[49:57] foolish christians today
[49:59] fail to receive the baptism of the holy
[50:01] ghost by foolishly choosing to invest
[50:03] their time and energy
[50:05] into worldly cares they are virgin in
[50:08] that they had no obvious interaction
[50:10] with idolatry lusts addictions and the
[50:13] like
[50:14] but like israel stopping at kadesh
[50:16] barnea for fear of the giants
[50:18] they failed to possess all of god's
[50:20] promises for fear of losing out on
[50:23] worldly opportunities
[50:25] they could have had all the truth but
[50:27] failed to ask for it
[50:29] jesus promised to give the holy ghost to
[50:31] them that asked
[50:32] in luke 11 13.
[50:37] who is the bride and where is she
[50:39] located
[50:41] sincere hearts want to know who the true
[50:42] bride is and where she is located
[50:45] truly the climatic book of the bible
[50:48] revelation
[50:49] holds this subject at its very core
[50:52] john's work is a dramatic unveiling
[50:54] of jesus his true bride and the false
[50:56] bride
[50:58] revelation chapter 1 reveals jesus
[51:00] christ the bridegroom
[51:01] in his sevenfold glory of supreme deity
[51:05] revelation chapters 2 and 3 reveal the
[51:07] bride's overcoming character
[51:09] and chapter 7 of this book is devoted to
[51:11] explaining this subject
[51:13] the false bride the mother harlot church
[51:16] is exposed in revelation chapter 17 and
[51:19] 18
[51:19] as the imposter church who loves
[51:22] abominations
[51:23] and self-indulgent living more than
[51:25] god's word
[51:26] chapter 9 of this book covers the
[51:28] mother's attributes
[51:29] but also the daughter churches who hold
[51:32] their mother's beliefs
[51:33] the true bride's eternal home then
[51:36] descends to earth
[51:37] in revelation chapters 21 and 22
[51:40] with the holy spirit's discernment you
[51:42] are able to distinguish the imposter
[51:44] church
[51:45] from the true bride church begin by
[51:47] using the 15
[51:48] doctrinal examples listed above the word
[51:51] is your standard
[51:52] forever settled in heaven never to pass
[51:54] away
[51:55] and will judge the secrets of every
[51:57] heart at jesus's white throne
[52:00] yes jesus's true bride believes god is
[52:03] one person
[52:04] just like the apostles believed she has
[52:06] the supernatural power of the holy ghost
[52:09] working in her midst through the
[52:10] spirit's nine gifts
[52:12] new converts are baptized in the name of
[52:14] the lord jesus christ
[52:16] and continue on into sanctification to
[52:18] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:21] sometime afterwards the bride is
[52:23] pentecostal by experience
[52:25] but not by organization her members
[52:27] believe in holiness
[52:28] and dress modestly with separate
[52:30] garments for both genders
[52:32] her women have uncut hair and men short
[52:35] hair
[52:35] as paul commanded bride members marry
[52:38] between men and women only
[52:40] and their marriages last until death
[52:43] they live holy lives
[52:44] abstaining from cigarettes social
[52:46] drinking and all other substance abuse
[52:50] i believe i'm part of this bible-based
[52:51] bride which is the reason i've written
[52:53] this book
[52:54] i believe every word in the bible just
[52:57] as it is written
[52:58] paul's teachings are the unchanging
[53:00] eternal truth of god
[53:02] for us to believe and live by so
[53:05] where is the bride her members are
[53:07] gathered in small churches worldwide
[53:10] as jesus's rapture description says some
[53:12] will be sleeping when the rapture
[53:14] happens
[53:14] while others will be working in the
[53:16] field or grinding at the mill
[53:18] she is part of the pew research center's
[53:21] all others group
[53:22] but separate from most of those due to
[53:25] her love for truth
[53:27] she could take the names holy
[53:28] ghost-filled church wise virgin church
[53:31] or bible-believing church but she has no
[53:33] official name
[53:35] her heavenly name is the lord jesus
[53:36] christ along with the family of god
[53:39] this is the reason she baptizes her new
[53:41] converts in the literal name of the lord
[53:44] jesus christ
[53:45] her members are both jew and gentile
[53:49] this bride group will be spirit
[53:51] organized through her heavenly
[53:52] headquarters
[53:53] following paul's apostolic pattern she
[53:56] has no earthly headquarters
[53:58] to enact man-made control over her
[54:00] members
[54:01] instead she is organized and unified
[54:04] exactly as paul organized the early
[54:06] church
[54:07] through the power of the holy spirit
[54:11] jesus's bride foreshadowed in eight old
[54:14] testament women
[54:16] not only did god foretell his taking a
[54:19] gentile wife through an old testament
[54:21] prophet
[54:22] he also used the following women's lives
[54:24] to type
[54:25] or foreshadow the bride church and her
[54:27] past and future events
[54:30] sarah rebecca aznath
[54:33] rahab samson's bride from timnath
[54:36] ruth esther and solomon's wife the
[54:39] shulamite
[54:41] a type foretells someone or some event
[54:43] to come
[54:44] in the future sarah the wife of abraham
[54:49] bearing isaac at 90 years old types the
[54:52] rapture
[54:52] of the jew gentile church galatians 3
[54:56] verse 7
[54:56] says anyone with faith in christ is a
[54:59] child of abraham
[55:00] isaac's birth foretells jesus second
[55:02] coming to earth
[55:04] because both are promised sons and
[55:06] isaac's birth happened about the same
[55:08] time as sodom's destruction
[55:11] jesus promised his second coming would
[55:13] occur at a time
[55:14] when the world was again in sodomite
[55:16] conditions
[55:17] according to luke 17 verses 28 through
[55:20] 30.
[55:22] since sarah's womb was dead and it was
[55:24] impossible for her to conceive
[55:26] before isaac's birth god had to
[55:28] transform her body with new life
[55:30] her body changed foreshadowed the body
[55:32] change christians will experience
[55:34] at the rapture behold i show you a
[55:37] mystery
[55:38] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[55:41] be changed in a moment
[55:42] in the twinkling of an eye at the last
[55:45] trump
[55:46] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[55:48] shall be raised incorruptable
[55:49] and we should be changed
[55:53] without god it is impossible for our
[55:55] bodies to change
[55:56] and meet christ in the air but with god
[55:59] all things are possible
[56:01] sarah even doubted god's promise to
[56:03] bring seed through her womb
[56:05] but god fulfilled his promise to abraham
[56:07] about his promised seed
[56:10] so will god keep his promise to
[56:12] christians despite their occasional
[56:14] doubts
[56:14] and fulfill first thessalonians 4 verses
[56:18] 15 through 18.
[56:21] rebecca's espousal and marriage to isaac
[56:23] in genesis 24 types the bride's
[56:26] spiritual espousal and heavenly marriage
[56:28] to christ the bridegroom
[56:30] eleazar abraham's chief servant is
[56:33] guided by god to find a suitable wife
[56:35] for isaac
[56:36] chapter 13 shows god's current choice
[56:39] for a human servant
[56:40] to espouse a bride church for his son
[56:43] jesus
[56:45] once rebecca is found and accepts the
[56:47] marriage proposal
[56:48] eleazar bestows upon her gifts of
[56:51] valuable jewelry
[56:52] these gifts type the nine gifts of the
[56:55] holy ghost
[56:56] given to jesus's bride as love tokens
[56:59] which the true bride will possess and
[57:01] operate for his glory
[57:03] eleazar endeavors to quickly return her
[57:06] to isaac
[57:07] and rebecca agrees the servant
[57:10] rebecca and her maidens make the long
[57:12] journey by camel
[57:14] to abraham's country the power of the
[57:16] camels
[57:17] symbolizes the power of the holy ghost
[57:20] that makes the church's long
[57:22] earthly journey possible just as the
[57:24] camels needed watered and fed
[57:27] our souls need a constant feeding of
[57:29] god's word
[57:30] during our lives when isaac comes into
[57:34] view
[57:34] he is outside his tent meditating in the
[57:37] field
[57:37] rebecca then meets him in the field
[57:39] typing our meeting
[57:40] the lord in the air at the rapture
[57:44] we won't meet jesus in his tent or
[57:46] heavenly house
[57:47] but in between in the air
[57:50] as an ath the egyptian wife of joseph
[57:54] types the new testament church composed
[57:56] of both jew and gentile
[57:58] her status as a gentile marrying a jew
[58:00] joseph
[58:01] types paul espousing gentile believers
[58:04] in a spiritual marriage with christ
[58:06] if you're a gentile you are the
[58:08] anti-type of azenath
[58:11] joseph's life before marrying azaneth
[58:14] clearly types jesus's earthly ministry
[58:17] joseph and jesus were both rejected by
[58:19] their brethren
[58:20] and sold for 20 and 30 pieces of silver
[58:23] respectively joseph's time in prison
[58:27] in which one inmate was killed and the
[58:29] other spared
[58:30] typed jesus on the cross the unrepentant
[58:33] thief soul was lost
[58:35] but the other thief was saved as jesus
[58:37] promised him paradise
[58:39] joseph's exaltation to second in command
[58:42] to pharaoh
[58:43] typed jesus's resurrection and placement
[58:45] at the right hand
[58:47] of the majesty on high once in his
[58:50] ruling position
[58:51] joseph married aznath likewise
[58:54] after jesus sat down on his heavenly
[58:56] throne he began to call and espouse a
[58:58] gentile wife
[58:59] to himself joseph revealing his identity
[59:03] to his brethren
[59:04] types the event of jesus revealing
[59:06] himself to the faithful
[59:08] 144 thousand jewish remnant after the
[59:11] rapture
[59:12] joseph's 11 brothers were blinded to his
[59:15] true identity
[59:16] just as israel is currently blinded to
[59:18] recognizing jesus
[59:20] as messiah this revelation came after
[59:23] joseph
[59:24] put out everyone from his presence
[59:26] meaning aznath was in her royal quarters
[59:29] not present as he revealed himself this
[59:32] type means jesus's true bride
[59:34] will be in her heavenly royal quarters
[59:37] as jesus descends to mount zion
[59:39] to reveal himself to the jews
[59:43] the rescue of rahab the gentile harlot
[59:46] from jericho's destruction
[59:48] types the rapture event from first
[59:50] thessalonians 4
[59:51] verses 15-18 her gentile lineage
[59:55] speaks of god rescuing the gentile
[59:57] people in the times of the gentiles
[1:00:00] just as rahab was saved by israel's
[1:00:02] trumpet and shout in joshua 6
[1:00:04] 5 the jew gentile bride is raptured by
[1:00:07] christ's
[1:00:08] shout voice and trump of god
[1:00:12] the book of joshua shows rahab being
[1:00:14] spared from her city's destruction
[1:00:17] because in faith she received and
[1:00:19] protected israel's two spies
[1:00:22] her record signified her faith in
[1:00:24] israel's god
[1:00:26] typing the token or seal of the holy
[1:00:28] ghost baptism
[1:00:29] believers must have on display in order
[1:00:32] to go in the rapture
[1:00:33] chapters 6 8 and 12 in this book
[1:00:36] detailed jesus's two symbols for the
[1:00:39] holy ghost baptism
[1:00:41] oil and a wedding garment only rahab and
[1:00:44] those within her house
[1:00:45] were spared from death when jericho's
[1:00:48] walls fell
[1:00:49] foreshadowing the certain death for all
[1:00:51] who missed the rapture
[1:00:53] in the awful time that follows the
[1:00:55] tribulation
[1:00:57] after being rescued this once ill-famed
[1:01:00] sexually immoral woman became a faithful
[1:01:03] godly wife and mother
[1:01:04] in so much god placed her in david's
[1:01:07] lineage
[1:01:08] which produced the christ child rahab's
[1:01:11] rags to riches testimony
[1:01:12] speaks of gentile christians being dead
[1:01:15] in sins and trespasses
[1:01:17] before christ's spirit quickens and
[1:01:19] raises them
[1:01:20] to sit in the honorable state of
[1:01:22] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:01:27] samson's philistine wife from timnath
[1:01:30] types jesus's gentile bride samson's
[1:01:33] parents were at first
[1:01:34] shocked that samson didn't take a jewish
[1:01:36] wife
[1:01:37] but judges 14 verse 4 says it was part
[1:01:40] of god's plan for samson
[1:01:42] to take a wife from among the
[1:01:43] philistines that he might destroy them
[1:01:46] and deliver israel the holy spirit
[1:01:49] revealed this revelation to my brother
[1:01:51] cameron who is also a pastor and then
[1:01:53] shared it with me
[1:01:55] god's purpose is to take a gentile bride
[1:01:58] in mercy
[1:01:59] not judgment but god must pour out his
[1:02:01] wrath upon most gentiles
[1:02:03] during the tribulation because they have
[1:02:05] rejected his spirit
[1:02:08] judges 14 3 says samson chose his wife
[1:02:12] because she pleased him jesus's bride
[1:02:14] church
[1:02:15] pleases him as well as she walks in the
[1:02:18] spirit
[1:02:18] and not the flesh this dedicated walk
[1:02:21] proves she has the spirit of christ and
[1:02:23] belongs to him
[1:02:25] paul taught believers how to please god
[1:02:27] through his commandments
[1:02:28] and sacrificing for others
[1:02:32] before marrying her the spirit of the
[1:02:34] lord comes upon samson
[1:02:35] and he slays a young lion who roared
[1:02:38] against him
[1:02:39] after a short meeting with his espoused
[1:02:41] bride samson finds bees and honey
[1:02:44] in the lion's carcass which he eats and
[1:02:46] shares with his parents
[1:02:48] without telling them where he got it the
[1:02:50] slain line represents god delivering
[1:02:52] jesus
[1:02:54] the line of the tribe of judah to be
[1:02:56] slain before the gentile marriage
[1:02:58] acts 2 verse 23 says jesus was delivered
[1:03:01] by the determinate counsel
[1:03:03] and foreknowledge of god to be crucified
[1:03:06] and slain
[1:03:07] unsearchable riches spiritual treasures
[1:03:10] and delicious revelations are gained
[1:03:12] from jesus's death peter says god's word
[1:03:15] has a gracious taste
[1:03:17] john was commanded to eat the open book
[1:03:19] formerly sealed with seven seals
[1:03:22] and testified it tasted like honey in
[1:03:24] revelation 10
[1:03:25] verse 10. finally
[1:03:28] samson hosted a seven-day wedding feast
[1:03:30] to celebrate his new bride
[1:03:32] proudly he put forth a riddle to
[1:03:34] challenge 30 philistine men
[1:03:36] promising them new clothing if they
[1:03:38] could solve it
[1:03:40] in judges 14 14 you find the riddle
[1:03:43] out of the eater came forth meat and out
[1:03:46] of the straw
[1:03:46] came forth sweetness the men were
[1:03:48] confounded for six days
[1:03:50] so on the seventh day they secretly
[1:03:52] threatened to burn the bride's father's
[1:03:54] house
[1:03:55] if she didn't get the answer from samson
[1:03:57] for them
[1:03:59] in tears the bride gains the answer from
[1:04:01] samson and shares it with the men
[1:04:03] samson realizes what has happened but
[1:04:06] still pays them the garments he promised
[1:04:09] soon after samson goes to ashkelon and
[1:04:12] slays the men
[1:04:13] taking back his garments
[1:04:16] this strange amazing story is fulfilled
[1:04:19] in the times of the gentiles
[1:04:21] from 53 a.d to the present day
[1:04:24] the seven day feast symbolizes the seven
[1:04:26] church ages
[1:04:28] see chapter seven samson's riddle
[1:04:30] represents the mystery of god
[1:04:32] spoken of in revelation 10 verse 7 that
[1:04:35] can only be revealed
[1:04:36] on the seventh and final day or 7th and
[1:04:39] last church age
[1:04:40] the laodicean church age john was told
[1:04:43] to take the open book
[1:04:44] or revealed bible truths that
[1:04:47] denominations had lost for centuries
[1:04:49] eat and prophesy them again around the
[1:04:52] world
[1:04:52] it's my humble opinion that the book you
[1:04:55] are reading contains the answer to
[1:04:56] samson's riddle
[1:04:58] or the revelation of god's holy bible
[1:05:00] and it could only be revealed
[1:05:02] in the last day just as samson's wife
[1:05:06] was the only one
[1:05:07] who had the answer to his riddle only
[1:05:09] christ's bride
[1:05:10] has the revelation of the previously
[1:05:13] seven sealed book
[1:05:14] or bible the timnath bride had to lay
[1:05:17] before samson
[1:05:18] and seek his love in order to get the
[1:05:20] revelation
[1:05:22] today's bride church stays in god's
[1:05:24] presence like mary
[1:05:26] the sister of lazarus and receives the
[1:05:28] sweet tasting bible revelations
[1:05:30] you can only find these rich sweet bible
[1:05:33] revelations
[1:05:34] being preached by jesus's bride for out
[1:05:37] of the eater
[1:05:38] jesus came forth meat and sweetness
[1:05:41] jesus's strong meat is spiritual
[1:05:43] discernment to judge between good and
[1:05:45] evil
[1:05:46] jesus's honey-like sweetness is his
[1:05:49] revealed
[1:05:50] unveiled open bible you are tasting it
[1:05:53] now
[1:05:53] and i hope you can agree with its
[1:05:55] sweetness like david did
[1:05:57] in psalm 119 verse 103
[1:06:00] how sweet are thy words unto my taste
[1:06:03] yea
[1:06:04] sweeter than honey to my mouth
[1:06:07] samson destroying the thirty men for
[1:06:09] threatening his bride
[1:06:10] is fulfilled during the tribulation when
[1:06:13] heaven's wrath is poured out upon all
[1:06:15] those who persecuted
[1:06:16] christ's bride revelation 18 verse 20
[1:06:19] and verse 24
[1:06:21] captures jesus's revenge upon the false
[1:06:23] church
[1:06:24] her daughter churches and sinners
[1:06:26] rejoice over her thou heaven
[1:06:28] and ye holy apostles and prophets for
[1:06:31] god hath avenged you
[1:06:32] on her and in her was found the blood of
[1:06:35] prophets
[1:06:36] and of saints and of all that were slain
[1:06:38] upon the earth
[1:06:40] ruth the gentile moabitus types the
[1:06:43] gentile church's marriage to jesus
[1:06:46] ruth's childless state as a widow
[1:06:48] represents the church's fruitless life
[1:06:51] before coming to christ and her first
[1:06:53] hopeless marriage to the law
[1:06:56] her marriage to boaz symbolizes the
[1:06:58] bride church's marriage
[1:07:00] to jesus according to romans 7 verse 4.
[1:07:04] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[1:07:06] dead to the law
[1:07:07] by the body of christ that you should be
[1:07:09] married to another
[1:07:11] even to him who is raised from the dead
[1:07:13] that we should bring forth fruit
[1:07:15] unto god thus the death of ruth's
[1:07:18] husband represents her being loosed
[1:07:20] from the curse of the law before
[1:07:23] marrying boaz
[1:07:24] ruth's choosing to travel back to israel
[1:07:27] with her elderly
[1:07:28] mother-in-law naomi types gentile
[1:07:30] christians
[1:07:31] leaving their sinful lives and following
[1:07:33] the old paths
[1:07:34] of serving god in love naomi types the
[1:07:38] old
[1:07:38] strict teaching of judaism for it was
[1:07:41] our schoolmaster to bring us
[1:07:43] unto christ naomi led ruth back to
[1:07:46] israel and ultimately to boaz
[1:07:48] a type of christ the timing of naomi and
[1:07:52] ruth's return to israel
[1:07:53] is perfect because it also types gentile
[1:07:56] salvation
[1:07:57] through the cross of jesus christ the
[1:07:59] women arrived in time for the barley
[1:08:01] harvest
[1:08:02] chapter 3 shows how the barley harvest
[1:08:05] occurred in the third month
[1:08:06] at the time of the feasts of passover
[1:08:09] unleavened bread and first fruits roots
[1:08:12] arrival of barley harvest
[1:08:14] represents gentile christians coming to
[1:08:17] faith in christ
[1:08:18] by experiencing the spiritual blessings
[1:08:20] of his death
[1:08:21] passover burial unleavened bread
[1:08:25] and resurrection first fruits recall
[1:08:28] paul said
[1:08:29] christians continually benefit from the
[1:08:30] spiritual feasts of the passover
[1:08:33] unleavened bread first fruits and even
[1:08:35] pentecost
[1:08:36] because the filling of the holy ghost
[1:08:39] the bride church
[1:08:40] like ruth came to christ in a timely
[1:08:42] manner
[1:08:43] she'll enjoy all the blessings of
[1:08:45] passover and the final harvest of
[1:08:47] pentecost
[1:08:48] the rapture in ruth's remaining story
[1:08:52] boaz redeems naomi in order to purchase
[1:08:55] and marry ruth
[1:08:56] in ruth 4 verses 9 and 10. this types
[1:08:59] jesus shedding his blood on the cross
[1:09:02] in order to purchase both jew naomi
[1:09:05] and gentile ruth acts 20 verse 28 says
[1:09:09] jesus purchased us
[1:09:10] with his own blood after their marriage
[1:09:13] ruth bears a son named obed
[1:09:15] and lets naomi nurse her son her seed
[1:09:19] this types the seed life of the gentile
[1:09:21] church the holy spirit
[1:09:23] returning to the once blinded jews after
[1:09:26] the rapture
[1:09:27] or wedding of the bride church all the
[1:09:30] israeli women rejoice for naomi
[1:09:32] who now has a kinsmen nourishment
[1:09:35] and restored life through boaz and ruth
[1:09:38] the 144 thousand jewish remnant
[1:09:40] enjoy the same a kinsmen redeemer in
[1:09:43] christ
[1:09:44] spiritual nourishment through the new
[1:09:46] testament truths
[1:09:47] and restored spiritual life through the
[1:09:49] seal of the holy ghost
[1:09:51] in their foreheads esther
[1:09:54] the jewish queen of the persian kings
[1:09:56] xerxes during
[1:09:58] 6th century bc types the new testament
[1:10:00] bride church
[1:10:02] xerxes previous queen vashti whom he put
[1:10:05] away
[1:10:06] types israel being put away or blinded
[1:10:09] as god put
[1:10:10] israel away via a bill of divorcement
[1:10:13] in isaiah 50 verse 1 and jeremiah 3
[1:10:16] verse 8. having put israel away
[1:10:19] christ could find a people for his
[1:10:20] namesake to be his new bride
[1:10:23] mordecai esther's cousin urges her to
[1:10:26] enter the contest to become
[1:10:28] xerxes new wife mordecai the elder
[1:10:32] staunch jew
[1:10:33] again types the holy law of moses as a
[1:10:35] school master
[1:10:36] to point us to jesus christ
[1:10:40] required to be a virgin to mary the king
[1:10:42] esther's virginity
[1:10:44] types complete devotion to christ with
[1:10:46] no worldly intercourse
[1:10:48] amazingly not one evil word is recorded
[1:10:51] about esther's character
[1:10:53] second corinthians 11 verse 2 says for i
[1:10:55] am jealous over you
[1:10:56] with godly jealousy for i have espoused
[1:10:59] you to one husband
[1:11:00] that i may present you as a chaste
[1:11:02] virgin to christ
[1:11:04] esther wins xerxes beauty contest by
[1:11:07] adorning herself according to haggy eyes
[1:11:10] requirements and nothing more haggai
[1:11:13] the king's chamberlain and keeper of the
[1:11:15] women types the holy spirit's
[1:11:17] sanctification work
[1:11:19] or second work of grace which needs
[1:11:21] nothing
[1:11:22] extraneous added to it esther lived by
[1:11:25] every word that proceeded from haggai
[1:11:27] as the bride church lives by every word
[1:11:29] of god in preparation for her marriage
[1:11:32] to jesus
[1:11:33] esther's wedding night types the
[1:11:35] christian's born-again experience
[1:11:37] as the new birth is likened in under
[1:11:39] receiving seed in 1st peter 1
[1:11:41] verse 23 although esther was jewish
[1:11:45] her israeli identity was at first
[1:11:48] unknown to the king
[1:11:49] and all shushan in other words everyone
[1:11:52] considered her a virgin gentile
[1:11:54] esther never even lived a day in
[1:11:56] jerusalem these facts about
[1:11:58] esther type today's spiritually virgin
[1:12:01] bride church
[1:12:02] composed of jew and gentile but inwardly
[1:12:05] she's a spiritual jew
[1:12:06] meaning her heart has been circumcised
[1:12:08] by the holy ghost
[1:12:10] she is born again romans 2 verse 29
[1:12:13] reads
[1:12:14] but he is a jew which is one inwardly
[1:12:16] and circumcision is that of the heart
[1:12:19] in the spirit and not in the letter
[1:12:21] whose praise is not of men
[1:12:23] but of god haman's plot to kill all jews
[1:12:27] including mordecai and esther types the
[1:12:30] very end of the times of the gentiles
[1:12:32] this is when the beasts out of the earth
[1:12:34] in revelation 13
[1:12:36] verses 11 through 18 plots to kill all
[1:12:40] both small and great rich and poor free
[1:12:43] and bond
[1:12:43] who do not take his antichrist mark
[1:12:47] his deceitful theme will be a promise of
[1:12:49] peace and safety
[1:12:50] while outlawing true christianity and
[1:12:53] instituting
[1:12:54] unionized religion just as haman's plot
[1:12:57] was foiled by esther's prayerful
[1:12:59] humble intercession so will the beast
[1:13:01] plot be foiled
[1:13:03] by the bride church's prayers esther and
[1:13:06] the jews fasted for three days
[1:13:08] before the queen put on her royal
[1:13:10] apparel and stood before the king
[1:13:13] though it could have cost her her life
[1:13:15] esther was willing to die to save her
[1:13:17] people
[1:13:17] and knew she was ordained queen for such
[1:13:20] a time as this
[1:13:21] esther's approach to xerxes types the
[1:13:23] bride
[1:13:24] prayerfully approaching christ clothed
[1:13:27] in the holy spirit's anointing
[1:13:29] in her spiritual roles as king and
[1:13:31] priest unto god
[1:13:33] esther had access to the highest
[1:13:35] authority as christians have access by
[1:13:37] faith
[1:13:38] into this grace wherein we stand
[1:13:42] just as esther felt political pressure
[1:13:44] there is coming a time
[1:13:46] of political pressure or squeezing time
[1:13:49] upon the bride church
[1:13:50] at some point in the future false
[1:13:52] churches will unite with political
[1:13:54] leaders
[1:13:54] to change laws requiring all churches to
[1:13:57] join an evil
[1:13:58] ecumenical union bride churches will
[1:14:01] feel the pressure of the movement
[1:14:03] but will be kept from actually having to
[1:14:04] decide upon the mark of the beast
[1:14:06] as jesus promised in revelation 3 verse
[1:14:09] 10
[1:14:10] because thou has kept the word of my
[1:14:12] patience i also will keep thee from the
[1:14:14] hour temptation
[1:14:15] which shall come upon all the world to
[1:14:18] try them that dwell upon the earth
[1:14:21] in the political squeeze the true church
[1:14:23] will do what esther did
[1:14:25] hold two wine banquets for the king wine
[1:14:28] represents the joy and boldness
[1:14:30] god's spirit brings to the believer as
[1:14:32] taught in psalms 16 verse 11
[1:14:34] acts 2 verses 4 through 21 and acts 4
[1:14:38] verse 31
[1:14:40] instead of choosing fear in her time of
[1:14:42] trouble the bride will honor her king
[1:14:44] with praise
[1:14:45] joy and bold rejoicing to magnify his
[1:14:48] name
[1:14:49] dual wine banquets also speak of the
[1:14:51] former and latter reigns
[1:14:53] from joel 2 verse see chapter 3
[1:14:57] note also how isaiah likens the rapture
[1:15:00] validated by paul
[1:15:01] in first corinthians 15 verses 51-54
[1:15:06] unto a wine feast in isaiah 25 verses
[1:15:09] 6 through 8 and in this mountain shall
[1:15:12] the lord of hosts
[1:15:13] make unto all people a feast of fat
[1:15:15] things
[1:15:16] a feast of wines on the leaves of fat
[1:15:19] things full of marrow
[1:15:20] of wines on the leaves well refined and
[1:15:23] he will destroy in this mount in the
[1:15:25] face
[1:15:26] of the covering cast over all people and
[1:15:28] the veil that is spread over all nations
[1:15:31] he will swallow up death and victory and
[1:15:34] the lord god will wipe away
[1:15:35] tears from off all faces and the rebuke
[1:15:38] of his people
[1:15:39] shall he take away from off all the
[1:15:41] earth for the lord hath spoken it
[1:15:45] observe esther sitting at a table with
[1:15:47] her husband and her greatest enemy
[1:15:49] haman like david wrote in psalm 23 verse
[1:15:53] 5
[1:15:54] esther was at a table in the presence of
[1:15:55] her enemies but god's anointing upon her
[1:15:58] led her to victory and deliverance thou
[1:16:01] prepared us a table before me in the
[1:16:02] presence of mine enemies
[1:16:04] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:16:07] runneth over
[1:16:09] though political pressure may come to
[1:16:10] the bride's table or
[1:16:12] churches even shutting her doors the
[1:16:14] latter rain anointing
[1:16:16] will ensure her deliverance david knew
[1:16:19] his victory came
[1:16:20] not by his own power but by god's
[1:16:22] anointing
[1:16:23] today's bride church knows the same
[1:16:26] it was on the day of the second wine
[1:16:28] banquet when esther finally revealed her
[1:16:31] petition to her husband the king
[1:16:33] who saved her from her accuser haman
[1:16:36] esther never had to suffer
[1:16:37] through the hour of death haman planned
[1:16:40] because xerxes did away with him
[1:16:42] so will the bride church be saved from
[1:16:45] living in the tribulation
[1:16:46] when the mark of the beast will be laid
[1:16:48] down christ will remove his church
[1:16:50] from the earth before the tribulation
[1:16:54] esther's story ends with mordecai's
[1:16:56] ascension to increase
[1:16:58] power and authority in the king's house
[1:17:01] the jews
[1:17:02] esther's people were given permission to
[1:17:04] defend themselves against haman's death
[1:17:06] sentence
[1:17:07] and they fought and defeated all their
[1:17:09] foes causing the creation of the
[1:17:11] celebratory
[1:17:12] feast of purim complete jewish victory
[1:17:15] in shushan
[1:17:16] types the complete victory of the 144
[1:17:19] thousand
[1:17:20] jewish believers during the tribulation
[1:17:22] though the antichrist in every nation
[1:17:24] will come against her
[1:17:25] jesus will physically come to protect
[1:17:27] and save his covenant people whose names
[1:17:30] are on the book of life
[1:17:33] the shulamite solomon's love interest in
[1:17:35] the book of song of solomon
[1:17:38] types the bride of christ because she is
[1:17:40] his only love throughout the entire book
[1:17:42] and she is never divorced or put away as
[1:17:45] israel was
[1:17:46] she is his one and only his lily among
[1:17:49] thorns
[1:17:50] the fairest among women the shulamite
[1:17:52] was likely a jew
[1:17:54] as easton's bible dictionary says
[1:17:56] shulamite means from shunan
[1:17:58] which is a little village in the tribe
[1:18:00] of issachar
[1:18:01] song of solomon 3 verses 9-11 names
[1:18:05] solomon
[1:18:05] proving he is indeed both the shulamites
[1:18:08] lover and
[1:18:09] king chapters one through three trace
[1:18:12] their romance
[1:18:13] from its beginning to the end of their
[1:18:15] engagement
[1:18:16] the shulami asked to be drawn into
[1:18:18] fellowship by her lover despite her
[1:18:20] black
[1:18:21] sunburnt skin she is a jewish vineyard
[1:18:24] laborer
[1:18:25] and not of royal ascent as royalty do
[1:18:28] not work in the hot sun
[1:18:30] right away she connects her skin color
[1:18:32] with the gentile clan of kidar
[1:18:34] ishmaelites giving evidence she's a type
[1:18:37] of the new testament church
[1:18:39] composed of jew and gentile
[1:18:43] the shulamite loves him in her soul the
[1:18:45] center of her existence
[1:18:47] god's holy spirit reaches to the depths
[1:18:49] of the bride's soul
[1:18:50] purifying it as the seal upon her soul
[1:18:53] the couple dream of their wedding night
[1:18:56] and enjoy short vacations together in
[1:18:58] the spring until solomon's arrival
[1:19:00] for their wedding in chapter 3 verses
[1:19:03] 6-11 chapter 4 details their wedding
[1:19:08] night
[1:19:08] as the couple compliments each other's
[1:19:10] head-to-toe beauty
[1:19:12] the marriage is consummated as solomon
[1:19:14] enters his spouse
[1:19:15] his garden and tastes of his honey here
[1:19:19] physical intercourse types the baptism
[1:19:21] of the holy ghost
[1:19:22] in the believer's soul because peter
[1:19:24] likens the new birth to receiving god's
[1:19:27] incorruptable seed as a woman receives
[1:19:29] her husband's seed
[1:19:30] on the wedding night chapters five
[1:19:34] through seven detail the shulamite
[1:19:35] struggles
[1:19:36] to respond quickly to her husband and
[1:19:39] her diligent
[1:19:39] seeking of his presence the couple again
[1:19:42] compliments each other's beauty in every
[1:19:44] body part as the wife longs to get away
[1:19:47] on vacation
[1:19:48] in order to give him her love any
[1:19:51] christian can relate to the shulamites
[1:19:52] desires
[1:19:53] to appropriately respond to christ's
[1:19:55] spirit and constantly live in his
[1:19:57] presence
[1:19:58] the body of christ is completely lovely
[1:20:00] in christ's eyes
[1:20:02] for he has washed it himself with his
[1:20:04] word
[1:20:06] in the eighth and final chapter the
[1:20:08] couple's love is best described as a
[1:20:10] seal upon their hearts
[1:20:11] stronger even than death adam proved
[1:20:14] love is stronger than death
[1:20:16] for he like christ after him purposely
[1:20:19] chose to die
[1:20:20] in order to be with eve he knew she was
[1:20:23] part of him
[1:20:24] and he could not deny himself jesus's
[1:20:27] love for his people was stronger than
[1:20:29] death
[1:20:30] for he raised from the dead to justify
[1:20:32] her
[1:20:33] jesus church loves him so much she
[1:20:35] willingly gives her life for him
[1:20:37] either through martyrdom or lifelong
[1:20:39] service
[1:20:41] in bible days nothing was more permanent
[1:20:44] than a king's seal
[1:20:45] as esther 8 verse 8 says the king's
[1:20:48] proclamation sealed with his ring
[1:20:50] is irreversible the couple's love is
[1:20:53] irreversible
[1:20:54] unending and eternal jesus's love is the
[1:20:58] seal of the holy ghost
[1:20:59] upon a christian's soul it's an unending
[1:21:02] spiritual love
[1:21:03] ephesians 4 30 promises the believer is
[1:21:06] sealed
[1:21:07] unto the day of redemption romans 5
[1:21:09] verse 5 says the love of god
[1:21:11] is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy
[1:21:14] ghost which is given
[1:21:15] unto us song of solomon ends identically
[1:21:20] to the new testament
[1:21:21] as both books have brides eager for
[1:21:23] their bridegroom's return
[1:21:25] song of solomon 8 14 records the wife
[1:21:29] urging solomon to return
[1:21:30] quickly like a speedy gazelle running
[1:21:33] down a mountain
[1:21:34] saying make haste my beloved and be thou
[1:21:37] like to a row
[1:21:38] or to a young heart upon the mountains
[1:21:40] of spices
[1:21:42] after jesus promises to come quickly
[1:21:44] john agrees saying
[1:21:46] amen even so come lord jesus
[1:21:49] christ's bride is greatly anticipating
[1:21:52] his return
[1:21:53] at the rapture
[1:21:56] lessons learned through bible brides
[1:21:59] wives and women
[1:22:01] today's new testament bride can learn
[1:22:04] valuable lessons
[1:22:04] she can instantly apply to her life from
[1:22:07] the women's lives recorded
[1:22:09] in the holy bible eve the first female
[1:22:13] came from adam as she was formed from
[1:22:15] his rib
[1:22:16] she is a representation of christ's
[1:22:18] bride originating from god's mind
[1:22:21] as we were chosen in him before the
[1:22:23] foundation of the world
[1:22:25] you came from the mind of god you are
[1:22:27] one of his eternal thoughts
[1:22:29] this means your soul is eternal you came
[1:22:32] from god
[1:22:33] and you will go back to god you are a
[1:22:34] part of his word which inspires you to
[1:22:37] daily live out his word
[1:22:40] the first female was deceived into
[1:22:42] sinning by the satan-filled serpent
[1:22:45] chapter 10 details satan injecting his
[1:22:47] nature
[1:22:48] into the human race christians don't put
[1:22:50] excessive guilt and blame upon eve
[1:22:53] for any of us in her position would have
[1:22:55] done the same
[1:22:56] but the lesson is to never add or take
[1:22:58] away from god's word
[1:23:00] as repeatedly taught in scripture he's
[1:23:02] desire
[1:23:03] should have been to adam the bride
[1:23:05] church's desire must only be to christ
[1:23:08] the bride church observes eve accepting
[1:23:11] the serpent's addition to god's command
[1:23:14] and learns not to repeat her error the
[1:23:17] serpent added one word
[1:23:18] not saying ye shall not surely die
[1:23:22] true churches will not add one thing to
[1:23:25] god's commands
[1:23:27] redemption story is seen in eve's life
[1:23:30] first in adam willingly sinning
[1:23:32] adam knew he would die if he partook of
[1:23:34] the forbidden fruit
[1:23:36] but he loved eve too much to live
[1:23:38] without her she was part of him
[1:23:40] so he took her sin upon himself trusting
[1:23:43] god's mercy to redeem
[1:23:45] them eve was deceived but adam wasn't
[1:23:48] this is allegorical of christ willingly
[1:23:51] taking all sin upon himself
[1:23:53] and dying on the cross for our
[1:23:55] redemption
[1:23:57] you also see god providing an animal
[1:23:59] sacrifice to forgive and redeem them
[1:24:01] both
[1:24:02] like god providing a ram to take isaac's
[1:24:05] place
[1:24:06] god prepared a body for christ to take
[1:24:08] your place on the cross
[1:24:10] adam and eve were clothed in their
[1:24:11] sacrifice wearing coats of skins in
[1:24:14] genesis 3
[1:24:15] verse 21 jesus's forgiven bride church
[1:24:19] is spiritually clothed in his
[1:24:20] righteousness isaiah 61 verse 10 reads
[1:24:24] i will greatly rejoice in the lord my
[1:24:26] soul shall be joyful in my god
[1:24:29] for hath clothed me with the garments of
[1:24:30] salvation
[1:24:32] he hath covered me with the robe of
[1:24:33] righteousness as a bridegroom decath
[1:24:36] himself with ornaments
[1:24:37] and as a bride adorneth herself with her
[1:24:40] jewels
[1:24:42] eve is forever connected with adam just
[1:24:44] as the bride church is connected with
[1:24:46] christ
[1:24:47] jesus is called the last adam in first
[1:24:50] corinthians 15
[1:24:51] 45 because he is the true faithful adam
[1:24:55] where adam failed jesus conquered paul
[1:24:58] writes further
[1:24:59] for since by man came death by man came
[1:25:02] also the resurrection of the dead
[1:25:04] for as in adam all die even so in christ
[1:25:08] shall all be made alive
[1:25:10] so if jesus is the last adam the bride
[1:25:12] church
[1:25:13] must be the last eve the obedient one
[1:25:16] desiring only her husband and she cannot
[1:25:19] be deceived
[1:25:21] jochebed the mother of moses along with
[1:25:24] her husband
[1:25:25] are examples of trusting in god in the
[1:25:27] face of governmental oppression
[1:25:30] egypt was killing all hebrew babies but
[1:25:32] jochebed's faith
[1:25:34] caused her to reject fear and cast moses
[1:25:37] upon the waters
[1:25:38] in an ark rather than let him die by
[1:25:40] egyptian hands
[1:25:42] god honored her faith ordaining
[1:25:44] pharaoh's daughter to find him
[1:25:46] jacob was eventually paid by the
[1:25:48] government to raise her own son
[1:25:51] christ's bride learns to honor god's
[1:25:53] word despite persecution
[1:25:55] as peter says we ought to obey god
[1:25:58] rather than men
[1:25:59] trust god with your children's destiny
[1:26:01] and god will reward you in ways you
[1:26:03] cannot imagine
[1:26:04] go to all lengths to love protect and
[1:26:08] train the children god gives you with
[1:26:10] confidence
[1:26:11] that god has a divine commission for
[1:26:12] their lives
[1:26:14] just as moses began following god at 80
[1:26:16] years old
[1:26:17] have faith your children will someday
[1:26:19] repent and serve god
[1:26:21] job 22 verse 6 declares train up a child
[1:26:24] in the way he should go
[1:26:25] and when he is old he will not depart
[1:26:27] from it
[1:26:29] deborah a prophetess and wife of
[1:26:32] lapidath
[1:26:33] became a judge in israel during a period
[1:26:35] of spiritual decline
[1:26:37] when israel was without male prophetic
[1:26:39] leadership
[1:26:40] god used her accurate prophecies to
[1:26:43] inspire barrack
[1:26:44] in his victorious attacks against the
[1:26:46] canaanites like he used sarah to move
[1:26:48] abraham
[1:26:49] in sending away hagar and ishmael
[1:26:52] jesus bride learns the power of prophecy
[1:26:55] from deborah's example
[1:26:57] the testimony of jesus is the spirit of
[1:26:59] prophecy
[1:27:00] and ezra 6 14 says believers always
[1:27:03] prosper
[1:27:04] through prophecy you should expect
[1:27:07] prophetic words
[1:27:08] as jesus in john 16 13 says the holy
[1:27:11] ghost
[1:27:12] will tell us things to come although
[1:27:14] paul says women cannot preach
[1:27:16] to men due to eve's deception the new
[1:27:19] testament does give both
[1:27:20] men and women the right to prophesy and
[1:27:23] manifest all nine gifts of the holy
[1:27:24] ghost
[1:27:26] the bride church will have all nine
[1:27:27] gifts of the spirit operating in her
[1:27:30] midst
[1:27:32] the daughter of king saul and wife of
[1:27:34] david once saved david's life
[1:27:37] by helping him escape saul's wrath but
[1:27:39] after being given in marriage to another
[1:27:41] man
[1:27:42] and then reclaimed by david she despises
[1:27:44] and mocks
[1:27:45] david's spirit-led dancing and worship
[1:27:48] as he brings the ark
[1:27:49] into jerusalem she is condemned to a
[1:27:52] life of barrenness
[1:27:53] having no children bride members glean
[1:27:56] the importance
[1:27:57] of spirit-inspired worship expressed in
[1:28:00] singing
[1:28:01] dancing shouting and more paul writes in
[1:28:04] first thessalonians 5
[1:28:05] 19 quench not the spirit david knew
[1:28:09] music
[1:28:09] led by the holy ghost would cast out
[1:28:11] devils and jesus's bride knows
[1:28:14] the same churches who reject the
[1:28:16] emotional blessings of the holy ghost
[1:28:18] will go childless meaning their members
[1:28:20] will never be born again by the spirit
[1:28:23] just as natural babies are often born
[1:28:25] with noisy crying
[1:28:26] spiritual babies are baptized with the
[1:28:28] holy ghost through a bold
[1:28:30] emotional experience see chapter six
[1:28:35] macau is best resembled by judas
[1:28:36] iscariot the betrayer of jesus
[1:28:39] when he degraded lazarus sister mary
[1:28:42] judas was upset
[1:28:43] mary used very costly spike nerd to
[1:28:46] anoint jesus's feet
[1:28:47] and wipe them with her long uncut hair
[1:28:50] in john 12
[1:28:51] verses 1 through 8. unlike judas bride
[1:28:56] churches follow the apostolic pattern
[1:28:58] of acts 4 verses 24 through 31
[1:29:01] by getting in the spirit and fully
[1:29:04] loudly worshiping god with their bodies
[1:29:06] and emotions
[1:29:07] despite reproach from judas iscariot
[1:29:10] type
[1:29:10] mockers hannah the wife of elkanah
[1:29:14] and mother of the prophet samuel is
[1:29:17] known for desperately and emotionally
[1:29:18] seeking god for a child
[1:29:20] that she be not barren while pouring out
[1:29:23] her soul before
[1:29:24] the lord eli the priest mistakes her
[1:29:26] emotion for drunkenness
[1:29:28] but hannah explains her sincere desire
[1:29:31] eli announces god's approval of
[1:29:33] and answer to her request and vow after
[1:29:36] weaning samuel
[1:29:37] hannah keeps her promise and leaves
[1:29:39] samuel to minister in the priesthood
[1:29:43] lessons about the value of natural and
[1:29:45] spiritual children
[1:29:46] are learned here while most professing
[1:29:48] christian churches
[1:29:50] condone the killing of millions of
[1:29:51] babies both by abortions and birth
[1:29:54] control pills
[1:29:55] true churches abhor death and value all
[1:29:58] life
[1:29:58] yes birth control pills cause millions
[1:30:00] of abortions
[1:30:02] by preventing new children embryos from
[1:30:05] attaching to the uterine wall
[1:30:07] bride churches are desperate to see new
[1:30:09] life come forth
[1:30:10] in the natural womb of mothers and in
[1:30:12] the spiritual womb of the church
[1:30:16] during my ministry i have desperately
[1:30:18] prayed for two barren couples to have
[1:30:20] children and god heard the prayers for
[1:30:22] both
[1:30:23] now we rejoice like hannah in first
[1:30:25] samuel 1
[1:30:26] 27 for this child i prayed and the lord
[1:30:30] hath given me my petition
[1:30:31] which i asked of him bride churches must
[1:30:35] also pray earnestly for new converts
[1:30:37] to be born again by the holy ghost
[1:30:39] baptism acts chapters 1 and 2 show the
[1:30:42] early apostles
[1:30:43] praying for 10 days before receiving the
[1:30:46] new birth
[1:30:47] paul says in galatians 4 verse 19 he was
[1:30:50] willing
[1:30:51] to again travail in birth until the
[1:30:53] galatians were truly born from above
[1:30:55] their reverting to legalistic teachings
[1:30:58] proved they were not born again at first
[1:31:00] and paul was willing to help bring them
[1:31:02] to the born-again experience
[1:31:03] they previously fell short of
[1:31:07] many more lessons abound for bride
[1:31:09] members in the lives
[1:31:11] of biblical women abigail beautiful and
[1:31:14] wise
[1:31:15] was exalted to wife of king david
[1:31:18] following her reverent approach to him
[1:31:20] and the death of her first husband evil
[1:31:22] nabal

[1:48:19] as jesus's bride rejecting the fact that
[1:48:22] god has a special people
[1:48:24] designated as his bride leads to the
[1:48:26] deception of universalism

[1:48:31] god's children
[1:48:32] god loves us the same and we are all
[1:48:34] going to heaven
[1:48:36] while it is true that god's love is
[1:48:37] impartial god's love must be received
[1:48:40] when churches willingly disobey any part
[1:48:43] of god's word
[1:48:44] they forfeit either part or all of god's
[1:48:46] blessings
[1:48:48] disobedience also signifies hatred for
[1:48:50] god
[1:48:51] since jesus taught obedience signifies
[1:48:54] your love for god
[1:48:55] in john 14 verses 15 21
[1:48:58] and 23 23-24
[1:49:01] doctors of this revelation will have
[1:49:03] chaos in their homes
[1:49:05] as another consequence when god's word
[1:49:08] is either discredited or not preached
[1:49:10] the listeners go home unwashed without
[1:49:13] spiritual correction and power
[1:49:15] family chaos ensues as second timothy 3
[1:49:18] verses 1 and 2 4 tells this know also
[1:49:22] that in the last days perilous times
[1:49:24] shall come
[1:49:25] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:49:27] selves covetous
[1:49:28] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:49:31] to parents
[1:49:32] unthankful unholy husbands will love
[1:49:36] themselves
[1:49:37] more than their wives and children
[1:49:39] teenagers and children alike
[1:49:41] will violently rebel against the ones
[1:49:43] who nurtured them
[1:49:44] and gave them life instead of treasure
[1:49:47] in their homes
[1:49:48] corruption will abide
[1:49:51] for those who will eventually be saved
[1:49:53] but reject this revelation
[1:49:55] their highest spiritual attainment is
[1:49:57] the foolish virgin category
[1:49:59] as taught by jesus and paul they will
[1:50:02] squander their precious time
[1:50:03] wandering from activity to activity
[1:50:06] ephesians 5
[1:50:07] verses 15-17 says see then that you walk
[1:50:11] circumspectly
[1:50:12] not as fools but as wise redeeming the
[1:50:15] time
[1:50:16] because the days are evil wherefore be
[1:50:18] not unwise
[1:50:20] but understanding what the will of the
[1:50:21] lord is
[1:50:23] foolish virgins are not quite sure what
[1:50:25] god's will is for their lives
[1:50:27] rather than being conformed to jesus's
[1:50:29] word image like the bride was
[1:50:32] they conformed to the world standards
[1:50:34] paul pleads with us to conform
[1:50:36] our minds to jesus's words in romans 12
[1:50:40] verses 1 and 2. i beseech you therefore
[1:50:43] brethren
[1:50:44] by the mercies of god that you present
[1:50:46] your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:50:48] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[1:50:51] reasonable
[1:50:52] service and be not conformed to this
[1:50:54] world but be
[1:50:55] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:50:57] that ye may prove what is that good
[1:51:00] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:51:04] future consequences are most awful for
[1:51:06] those who
[1:51:07] reject and blaspheme this revelation
[1:51:10] they may even become part of a church
[1:51:12] whether the mother harlot or one of her
[1:51:14] daughters as a result
[1:51:16] their lives will be filled with demonic
[1:51:18] influences in their bodies and minds
[1:51:21] through movies television shows and more
[1:51:24] mother harlot churches are the homes of
[1:51:26] every kind of devil
[1:51:27] according to revelation 18 verse 2.
[1:51:30] choosing to be a part of the false bride
[1:51:32] brings plagues
[1:51:34] revelation 18 verse 4 warns and i heard
[1:51:37] another voice from heaven saying
[1:51:39] come out of her my people that ye be not
[1:51:41] partakers of her sins
[1:51:43] and that you receive not of her plagues
[1:51:45] the last
[1:51:46] miserable consequence for these lost
[1:51:48] souls is eternal separation from god
[1:51:51] in the lake of fire
[1:51:55] conclusion jesus is looking for a bride
[1:51:58] that will submit to his every word
[1:52:00] and accept her responsibilities and
[1:52:02] ministries
[1:52:03] will you let jesus wash away your every
[1:52:05] sin stain
[1:52:06] through the water of his word jesus
[1:52:09] offers his cleansing
[1:52:10] and thirst quenching water to every
[1:52:12] individual
[1:52:13] if any man thirsts let him come unto me
[1:52:16] and drink
[1:52:17] you need not have to wonder if you are
[1:52:20] part of jesus's bride
[1:52:22] the bible doctrines and commands that
[1:52:24] any person can read straight out of the
[1:52:25] bible
[1:52:26] must be followed those who obey are the
[1:52:29] true bride
[1:52:30] separated from the foolish and evil
[1:52:32] women christ came to seek and save his
[1:52:34] bride and you will know his voice as you
[1:52:36] hear his word preached
[1:52:38] in its fullness and truth in becoming
[1:52:41] jesus bride
[1:52:42] you find your eternal destiny and
[1:52:44] position by his side
[1:52:46] your only word will be his word his
[1:52:49] thoughts will be your thoughts
[1:52:50] just as adam said of eve this is now
[1:52:53] bone of my bones
[1:52:54] and flesh in my flesh jesus says you are
[1:52:57] a word of his word
[1:52:58] life of his life and spirit of his
[1:53:00] spirit
[1:53:04] action steps step 1 repent for
[1:53:07] disobeying any bible command
[1:53:09] and seek the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:53:12] express your desire to fully submit to
[1:53:14] every word of god
[1:53:15] if you surrender fully he'll come in
[1:53:17] fully
[1:53:18] step 2 in kindness and respect separate
[1:53:22] yourself from both foolish
[1:53:23] and false churches if you are in need of
[1:53:26] a bride church
[1:53:27] please contact me revelation 22 verse 17
[1:53:30] says the spirit and the bride
[1:53:32] are inviting you to come and drink of
[1:53:34] the waters of life freely
[1:53:36] if you desire a true church there has to
[1:53:38] be a church god has prepared for you
[1:53:41] psalm 42 verse 7 says deep calleth unto
[1:53:44] deep
[1:53:45] if you have a deep call and desire for
[1:53:47] truth god has a response waiting for you
[1:53:50] even if you have to start a bride church
[1:53:52] yourself
[1:53:54] step 3 continue to grow in grace and
[1:53:56] knowledge of the lord
[1:53:58] through continual sanctification the
[1:54:00] bride not only begins holiness
[1:54:02] but perfects and completes it second
[1:54:05] corinthians 7 verse 1 reads
[1:54:07] having therefore these promises dearly
[1:54:09] beloved let us cleanse ourselves
[1:54:11] from all filthiness of the flesh and
[1:54:13] spirit perfecting holiness
[1:54:15] in the fear of god
