TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ can a person be saved but not yet born again the answer is yes which means in other words not all saved christians are born again here's the outline for this video first we'll look at visuals that will help us understand this bible truth second we'll look at bible proof believers can be saved but not yet born again third we'll listen to a quote from god's prophet william branham explaining this revelation and lastly we'll look at the misunderstanding some people have of john chapter 3 verse 3. this is a wonderful deep bible subject that the holy ghost leads believers into understanding as jesus and paul told us christ of the holy ghost will lead us into all truth in john 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth paul said the holy ghost searches the deep things in first corinthians 2 verse 10 but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god this subject is also closely related to the bible mystery called by numerous different names such as christ in you and the filling of the holy ghost and the new birth but i'll call the baptism of the holy ghost because jesus called it this in numerous places but most notably in acts chapter 1 verse 5 when he said for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence visuals to help understanding before showing the five bible proofs people can be saved and not born again i want to show visuals that will help viewers understand this clear bible truth that the baptism of the holy ghost or new birth takes place sometime after a person is saved and by saved i mean when he first believes in jesus christ and repents of his sins and is baptized paul explicitly stated this in two places acts 19 verse 2 said he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost of course paul was talking to the ephesians which believed in jesus christ but yet we're not born again as we'll show later and the second verse is ephesians 1 verse 13 in whom he also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise on page 301 of my 2021 book i listed eight representations of god's plan to use three steps three stages or three works of grace in order to bring a person to complete spiritual maturity the bible calls these three works justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost believers are saved at justification but must continue believing and thereby be sanctified in the second stage or work of grace meaning sanctified from sinful habits and then they're eternally sealed into the kingdom of god in the third stage which is the baptism of the holy ghost so here's the chart from my book you'll see how god always has three works of grace for man's natural birth you have the water breaking the blood and then the breath of life for man's spiritual birth which is what we're talking about now the believer is justified or goes through justification when they believe in the first step that's when they're saved then they're sanctified in the second step and then thirdly they are baptized with the holy ghost this was foreshadowed by israel's exodus in the old testament the first step was leaving egypt which represents being saved out of a life of sin or being saved out of worldliness the second stage was going through the wilderness which represents sanctification and the third step was crossing over into canaan or possessing the promised land that joshua led israel to fulfill you also see these three steps in the tabernacles cleansing which is moses tabernacle because you have the outer court holy place holy of holies the earth's cleansing which is past and future has three steps as well noah's flood of water represents the baptism or a person being saved as first peter 3 teaches as well sanctification is represented when jesus blood was spilled upon the earth and earth's cleansing is completed in the third step of the fervent heat peter wrote about in second peter chapter three this fervent heat represents the baptism of the holy ghost or the third work of grace a believer experiences when he's born again ezekiel prophesied of these three steps in ezekiel 36 verses 26 and 27 being saved is having a new heart the second stage is being sanctified called the new spirit or new mind or renewed human spirit the third step is the baptism of the holy ghost which is my spirit god says or god's spirit dwelling in the believer's soul jesus also likened these three stages to the three stages in a wheat plant's growth in mark 4 verse 28 jesus said the wheat starts as a blade that's being saved the next stage is the ear that's being sanctified and the full corn stage is the third stage the baptism of the holy ghost and jesus also called these three stages the way the truth and the life in john 14 verses 3 through 6 and also john 17 verse 17 the way was justification or being saved sanctification comes by the word or the truth because jesus said thy word is truth sanctify them through thy word thy word is truth in john 17 verse 17 and then the life was the third step the life is the holy ghost living in the believer's soul here's a second visual showing the three parts to man's being body human spirit or mind and soul according to first thessalonians 5 verse 23. in the old testament the saints were saved as the holy ghost could come upon their bodies like samson and david's flesh was mightily anointed to do great works for god and the holy ghost would come upon their human spirits where holy men of old were moved by the holy ghost to write infallible scripture and they would prophesy and write the scripture but the holy ghost could never baptize their souls in the old testament because the blood of animals could never abolish sin as hebrews chapters 9 and 10 labor upon so please read those chapters but now in the new testament thanks to the blood of jesus christ the holy ghost can now fill baptize and seal the soul of the believer unto the day of his redemption according to ephesians 4 30 matthew 11 29 and hebrews 4 verses 9 through 12. bible proof believers can be saved but not yet born again in the new testament you find at least five examples of persons being saved without being born again it's absolutely necessary to understand jesus christ said no one could be born again until after he was resurrected in his glorified body in john 7 verses 37 through 39 this means all old testament saints were saved but not born again due to the weakness of the blood of bulls and goats as hebrews 9 verses 13 and 14 and hebrews 10 verse 4 tell us jesus's blood took away sins and now the souls of men could be born again by the baptism of the holy ghost both john the baptist and jesus christ use the terminology of the baptism of the holy ghost or the born-again experience in matthew 3 verse 11 and acts 1 verse 5. note also the five examples of persons being saved without having the holy ghost baptism are peter mary the samaritans in acts 8 including simon the sorcerer cornelius in acts chapter 10 and the 12 ephesian saints in acts chapter 19. beginning with peter he had the revelation that jesus was the christ in matthew 16 verse 16. before this peter was already baptizing souls according to john chapter 4 verses 1 and 2. so peter himself would have already repented and been baptized unto john's baptism baptism signifies a soul is saved because it has confessed and repented from sins according to first peter 3 verse 21 and mark 16 16 and matthew 3 verses 1 through 6. peter didn't receive the holy ghost baptism until acts chapter 2 verse 4 and testified it about being the holy ghost baptism in acts 11 verses 15 and 16. also note jesus prayed for peter's faith not to fail in luke 22 32 meaning peter would not lose his faith or salvation faith is the first step in salvation when a person receives the gift of faith or the anointing of faith it is the moment the person is saved and perhaps we'll make a video in the future about the stature of a perfect man that details this in second peter chapter 1 verse 5. the second example is mary the mother of jesus mary claims she was already saved in luke 1 verse 47 before jesus was even born luke 1 47 says and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior so mary was clearly saved but she was not born again we know this because acts 1 verse 14 says that mary the mother of jesus his brethren and the women all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication in the upper room until acts 2 verse 4 when the holy ghost fell and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance the third proof is the samaritans and simon the sorcerer in acts chapter 8. in verses 12 and 13 many samaritans heard philip preaching and they were baptized both men and women but in verses 14 through 16 peter and john came down to pray for the samaritans that they'd be filled with the holy ghost or baptized with the holy ghost verse 16 plainly states it for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus it is undeniable that they were believers because verse 12 says they believe philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god verse 13 says simon the sorcerer believed himself also then in verse 17 they laid their hands on them and they received the holy ghost so it's undeniable the samaritans were saved but not yet filled with the holy ghost and this story matches all the other previous bible teachings that a person gets saved first and then sometime after that in the third work of grace they get the baptism of the holy ghost now verses 18 through 23 simon the sorcerer tries to buy this ability to pray for people and get the holy ghost and notice what peter says to him peter says thy money perish with thee peter said his heart was not right in the sight of god peter said he need to repented of this wickedness peter said he was in the gall of bitterness in the bond of iniquity so this language proves simon the sorcerer was a believer but he was not yet born again the holy ghost had not filled him yet because the holy ghost filled believer would have the love of god in his heart and not think he could buy the gifts of god our fourth example is acts chapter 10 cornelius had to have been saved and sanctified before he received the baptism of the holy ghost through peter's preaching in acts chapter 10 verse 44. proof of this is in peter's own words for he said cornelius knew the preaching of peace by jesus christ according to acts 10 verse 36 and 37. peter said that word i say ye no corneas knew about jesus christ and thereby was serving christ through prayer fasting and almsgiving as you read in acts chapter 10. heaven had even recorded his memorials the prayers fasting in alms etc so no doubt he was already saved and had the fear of the lord but he wasn't born again for some reason cornelius had not been baptized in water we don't know why he hadn't been baptized but after his soul was baptized with the holy ghost peter commanded him to be baptized in water and he happily agreed this proves water baptism is just an outward symbol of the inward work of salvation that is already done in the hearts of believers the fifth and final example is the twelve ephesian saints who received the baptism of the holy ghost in acts 19 verses six and seven notice they were already saved because they had been baptized unto john's baptism which was a baptism unto repentance and remission of sins they had been sitting under the mighty ministry of apollos who only knew john's baptism according to acts 18 verses 24-28 these saints had to have been justified and sanctified justification and sanctification are mighty works of god no doubt for there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels over one sinner who repents paul asked this group if they had received the holy ghost since they believed which no doubt he meant the holy ghost baptism that jesus urged his own disciples to receive after he resurrected in john 20 verse 22 and acts 1 verses 4 and 5. the ephesians told paul they had not heard of this holy ghost baptism paul then baptized them in the name of the lord jesus laid his hands on them and they received the holy ghost baptism it's important to recognize people can lose their salvation if they're in the first or second stages of god's grace lord willing in the future will make a video about how people can lose their salvation but born again people those whose souls have been baptized with the holy ghost can never lose their salvation because they have the permanent seal of the holy ghost baptism as the bible says they are sealed unto the day of redemption according to ephesians 4 verse 30. jesus christ himself said overcomers names will not be blotted out of the book of life in revelation 3 verse 5 so this means names of the disobedient can be blotted out out of the book of life mentioned in revelation 22 19 just as names were blotted out in the old testament according to exodus 32 33 friends salvation by grace is a gift but the gift can be forfeited by transgression judas is scary believed in jesus for a while as he and the other 11 apostles baptized new believers but judas fell by transgression and went to hell according to acts 1 verse 25 judas iscariot then is an example of someone who believed in jesus for a while but then forfeited his salvation jesus said this was possible in luke chapter 8 verse 13 when he preached on the four kinds of grounds or hearts and said the stony ground heart believed on him for a while but then fell away or lost its salvation luke 8 13 says they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away so people like judas iscariot can believe for a while their names can be on the book of life in heaven for a while but then they can fall away and jesus will blot their names out of the book of life in the presence of the 12 and 70 preachers jesus told them not to rejoice in their power to do miracles but in the fact that their names were written in heaven in luke 10 verses 17-24 a deep understanding of grace shows people can receive grace but they can also fail the grace of god meaning the grace that once saved and sanctified a person can be trodden underfoot leading to sore punishment according to hebrews 10 verses 25 through 39 and hebrews 12 verses 15 through 17. others can receive the grace of god in vain according to second corinthians 6 verse 1 and grace can be turned into lawlessness or laschiviousness according to jude 1 verse 4. paul also said grace can be frustrated through legalism in galatians 2 verse 20. to say every christian or believer is already born again is to take away these five bible examples out from the pulpit which carries grave consequences according to proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6 and revelation 22 verses 18-19 proverbs 30 5-6 says every word of god is pure he's a shield unto them that put their trust in him add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar revelation 22 18-19 says for i testify on every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book please friends do not ignore these five plain bible examples bible readers must not write off ignore or explain away or discredit these five bible proofs these are explicit teachings that believers can be saved but not yet filled or born again by the holy ghost these five biblical texts are not implications i am not implying anything into these five biblical texts these are explicit teachings that not every believer is born again by god's grace i receive the bible knowledge of this subject through god's prophet brother william branham there are many quotes detailing this revelation but here is one that is very clear and contains bible examples let's listen to the quote now i believe that you are are are saved by accepting jesus christ and water baptism is an outward expression to show that something inwardly has happened because water has no virtue it's just a symbol and i believe that you're saved when you now there's many people let me straight this for brother there's many people that are say they're saved many are baptized in jesus name many speak in tongues and have all kinds of signs of the holy ghost and still not even saved that's right mandy will come to me in that and said lord have not i prophesied in your name preacher have not i in your name cast out devils have done many mighty works he said depart from me you that work iniquity i never even knew you see so all those things yet it's it's god it's in his hands but when i see that you say well then why do you recall the people to be re-baptized is because i'm following the pattern of the beginning we can't lose that blueprint now we take apostle paul when he found certain disciples that were wonderful people i believe they were saved and yet they had not been baptized in the name of jesus christ though they had been baptized acts 19 passed through the upper coast of the emphasis he finds certain disciples and he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we don't know about the holy ghost where there be any holy ghost he said then unto what were you baptized they said we've been baptized john baptized is the same man that baptized jesus that's a pretty good baptism what's this stern apostle he said but john only baptized unto repentance not far remission of sins because the sacrifice had not been killed baptized unto and when they heard this they were re-baptized in the name of jesus christ and the holy ghost came upon them now what did this do showed that these people who were protesting onto life as soon as they saw the scriptural truth they walked in the truth and receive the reward of a believer the holy ghost came upon them and they spoke in tongues prophesied magnified god you get it now see they did that after they've already had great joy shouting and praising god in the bible they had a baptist preacher up there he was baptized too but he was and he was proved by the by the bible that jesus was a christ and the people had great joy and they were just so happy over and still they didn't have the holy ghost they had to be re-baptized again and paul said in galatians 1 8 if an angel from heaven comes and preaches any other gospel this i preached unto you let him be accursed don't care what it would be now i realize that it is going to be confusing for a moment here as most people know that i was ordained a baptist preacher and i have steadfastly declared that the baptists have missed it for saying you receive the holy ghost when you believe for that is not so you receive him since you believed acts 19 2-6 he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since he believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto john's baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which had come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied there it is paul asked have you received since not when you believed and there is a great difference there for it is after we believe that we receive ephesians 1 13 is an exact word repeat of what happened in ephesus according to acts 19 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed not when ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise now here is my point too many of our modernists and even our fundamentalists so called believe unto salvation at a certain specific time which in many cases is called making a decision and that has been called receiving christ or being born again now to receive christ is to receive his spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the holy ghost amen these folks believe that is wonderful but they stop there you receive the holy ghost after you believe it has always been that way and always will be the very first word of direction to the people was by peter at pentecost and he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call the misunderstanding of john chapter 3 verse 3. friends a viewer asked me about john chapter 3 verse 3 and tried to say this verse proves all believers are born again let's read john 3 verse 3. jesus answered and said to him verily verily i say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god i agree jesus said you must be born again but he said you must be born again in order to see or understand the kingdom of god in other words you must be born again to understand god's current holy ghost dispensation because jesus said the kingdom of god is within you so the kingdom of god is the baptism of the holy ghost living in a believer's soul that's according to luke 17 verse 21 which says neither shall they say lo here or or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you so the viewer misunderstood john 3 verse 3. jesus was saying you must receive the baptism of the holy ghost in order to understand the kingdom of god while living on this earth but we also know jesus taught there was two kinds of christians in matthew 25 verses 1 through 13 there's wise and foolish only the wise had the oil or the baptism of the holy ghost only the wise then would understand the kingdom of god but that doesn't mean the foolish virgin did not exist they did exist they just didn't understand the kingdom of god and that's exactly what we have today we have wise virgins who are born again of the baptism of the holy ghost with the oil of the holy ghost and we have foolish virgins alive today who are saved their virgins the word they are pure to the word of god having no spiritual intercourse with the world or idolatry but they are not born again paul tells us born-again christians are currently translated into the spiritual kingdom of god in colossians 1 verses 13 and 14. it says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins because we have the kingdom of god now in our souls the baptism of the holy ghost we will rule in this life over sin death the devil and the flesh and as a reward for ruling in the kingdom of god now we'll rule and reign in the future kingdom of god later as revelation 20 verses 4 5 and 6 plainly say i'm just going to read a portion of these scriptures it's about the souls of them that did not worship the beast or the antichrist spirit which is in the roman catholic church and her daughter protestant churches and the bible said they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years in verse six it calls them blessed and then said they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years notice verse 5 says the rest of the dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection so only the wise virgin or the holy ghost filled saints will live during the millennium a thousand years of peace the rest of the dead that did not have the oil like the foolish virgins that were not ready for the rapture will miss both the rapture and the millennium it's likely their souls will be in heaven somewhere under the altar just as the blinded jews are under the altar as well still save for the word of god and the testimony that they held so holy ghost-filled believers have the kingdom of god living in them now and because of that we'll rule and reign in the millennial kingdom with christ for a thousand years but i want to show a scripture as well that shows the foolish virgin have a place in the future home outside the new jerusalem city so the foolish virgin have a part of the future kingdom to come as the bible says they're likely kings of the earth that bring glory into the bridegroom city the city of the bridegroom jesus christ and his bride the holy ghost filled church in matthew 25 verses 34 through 37 jesus speaks of a righteous group these are the foolish virgins and in verse 34 he says then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world of course this is the white throne judgment which is after the rapture in the millennium and jesus gives these foolish virgins a place in the kingdom but it would not be the same place as jesus's bride or wise virgins who had the holy ghost the kingdom of god during their lifetimes according to the authoritative words of jesus in luke 17 verse 21 and matthew 25 verses 8 and 9 wise virgins have the kingdom or rule of the holy ghost now inside their souls but foolish virgins do not yet have the kingdom in their souls because they are not yet born again they do not have the oil but they will have a position in the future kingdom in the new jerusalem described in revelation chapters 21-22 the bride of jesus christ is ever with the lord beginning at the rapture according to first thessalonians 4 verse 17 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord just like in jesus parable the ten virgins the wise virgins went out to meet jesus the bridegroom at the rapture the foolish virgin miss the rapture so they shall not ever be with the lord they've got to go through the tribulation and then during the millennium they're not on the earth they're up in heaven somewhere likely under the altar like the saved jews who are blinded to the gospel but the holy ghost-filled bride of jesus christ will always be with the lord beginning at the rapture the battle of armageddon the millennium the bride will sit with jesus on his throne at the great white throne judgment and then the bride of jesus christ will live with jesus christ in the city itself the future home the new jerusalem for those who love details though there seems to be a very short time when the bride is not with the lord jesus after the rapture which would be during the marriage supper of the lamb when jesus descends to earth to reveal himself to his brethren the 144 thousand jews as revelation chapter 14 records i believe revelation 21 verse 24 shows how the foolish virgin will have a place in the future home kingdom for the bible says and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it so i believe the foolish virgins are these kings of the earth that do not live in the city itself with christ and his holy ghost-filled bride but they bring their glory and honor into the city but foolish virgins should be encouraged because jesus said they're blessed of his father and they will inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world in other words jesus foreknows all that are saved whether they go all the way to the baptism of the holy ghost or just stop at justification or sanctification our god is rich in mercy and loves all those who are saved sanctified or filled with the holy ghost in closing i hope this video was a blessing and was helpful using bible proofs to show that believers can be saved but not yet born again let me encourage you if you're saved i rejoice in that praise the lord hallelujah but make sure your experience matches the book of acts if you're saved does your life match that of cornelius are you praying fasting and giving alms on your way to receive the baptism of the holy ghost i would encourage you to follow the example of cornelius if you're not sure if you're born again or not set your affections on things above pray fast give alms in secret do all those things in secret where the heavenly father sees you and then he'll reward you openly by receiving the baptism of the holy ghost acts 5 32 said god gives the holy ghost to all them that obey him remember paul's wonderful question have ye received the holy ghost since you believed i pray you will believe until you are filled with the holy ghost baptized with the holy ghost in your soul if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
