TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 7 youtube testimonies questions and answers includes footnotes numbers 395 through 415 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear first peter 3 15 youtube the video sharing company owned by google is one of the most popular websites on the internet it is astounding that over 1 billion hours of video are watched daily on youtube nearly 2 billion users access this site which is over a third of all the people on the internet christians should use youtube as a platform to spread the gospel of jesus christ through videos christians can provide humble direct answers to the questions people have about jesus christ and the bible believers should also avoid all sinful content on youtube david wrote by the holy spirit that i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me a spirit-filled and spirit-led christian will not purposely place evil content before his eyes but rather cast down any video that exalts itself against the word of god my desire for outreach although i did not publish my first youtube video until october 2014 there had been a burning desire in my heart to create and distribute christ's glorifying content since 2004 during the 10 years leading up to 2014 i dreamed of spreading the truth of god to anyone who would listen it was such a burden that in 2005 i asked my pastor if we could hold special saturday night services in order to record sermons that would teach people about the bible he agreed and we recorded two audio sermons about the dangers of television and the two seeds or wheat and tares one friend of mine burned these audio files onto cds and we distributed the sermons to friends and strangers i was immediately hooked on outreach in 2006 i became pastor of the church i currently pastor in akron ohio one of our first ministries was copying and distributing audio sermons and teachings the ministry lasted for a few years and then stopped as our family sizes increased and caused us to focus more on establishing godliness in our growing families the burden to share the gospel continued though and as 2014 approached i began slowly tinkering with video editing filming and script writing i could not escape the deep call i was hearing to go beyond audio and create my own teaching videos to spread the gospel of my savior jesus christ in march of 2014 after many hours of preparation i finally had enough courage to publish my first video on vimeo titled water baptism by scripture alone i chose vimeo because i felt it was a safer platform at the time after uploading eight more teaching videos i was surprised to see that i had not received any online abuse and decided i should move to a more widely used website youtube i am so thankful for the results i have witnessed since joining youtube with over half a million views and 6 000 subscribers to my youtube page i rejoice in the hand of god to spread his truth via the internet god has provided numerous testimonies that have resulted from the 50 plus youtube bible teaching videos i have uploaded i want you to know how the revelations about god's standards for a modest outward appearance have helped change lives around the world reaching countries i could have never stepped foot onto my prayer is that these testimonies will help inspire you to experience the life-changing power of jesus christ's word for yourself in every area of your life including your outward appearance each of us need a testimony of our own experience with our lord jesus christ in order to overcome satan and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death testimonies most christians find testimonies to be an extremely powerful source of encouragement our faith is uplifted challenged and raised after hearing how god has helped another believer jesus christ's real presence is more powerfully felt when believers share how god faithfully and personally answered their pleas i have extracted the following testimonies from my youtube channel and email account that related to a modest outward appearance the first two testimonies though are not about the outward appearance but i felt you would benefit from hearing how the truths of god's word make believers speechless and save lost souls general comment about all the videos your videos play a huge role in my life i've got no words to say i've become speechless about your help i think i better say i love you my pastor ns november 2016. comment about the water baptism video your youtube channel not only helped me to know god better but also guided me to follow god's will hopefully your videos will save and help a lot more lost souls like me thanks to you for making those videos you save my soul dp november 2017 make up video testimonies i fasted three days and asked god to show me about makeup and i just opened my youtube and here you are talking about makeup it was amazing god answered my prayer many thanks brother you really helped me i will share this video with other sisters lh september 2017. thank you for this video it made me realize there is no such thing as modest makeup and there are churches twisting verses of the bible to keep their members ka january 2018 i'm not wearing makeup no more tj january 2018 i'm throwing away my makeup gm october 2017. thank you for this video i don't wear a lot of makeup but i'm completely done with what i was using ls october 2017. the argument you made based entirely on god's holy and perfect word has convinced me hl august 2017 i need to share with you what has happened with me since i commented on this video as i said i was a makeup guru i loved how i could transform and look like someone else but god one morning shortly after i wrote to you god said why not skip the makeup this morning and spend that extra time with me i obeyed and loved it little by little makeup became less and less attractive sometimes it wouldn't even go on right and i would have to wash it all off every day i noticed how in the evening as it was wearing off my face looked worse than it did without any makeup on then one day i was reading scripture and the thought came to me and said why do you paint your face to gain man's approval so i thought and that was why i did wear it i love the attention i got and the compliments every week about how pretty i was i stopped wearing makeup cold turkey after that yes i felt naked and self-conscious at first i have now gone about two months without it and i don't miss it most days i don't feel naked without it either i don't get near the compliments from men or women as i used to but that's okay because that could lead me down a wrong path anyways gm july 2017. long dresses for women video testimonies i've been struggling for many years regarding my wardrobe i have read the scriptures and listened to opinions expressed by christians throughout these years regarding this subject i have searched the internet seeking for answers finally i picked up my phone yesterday and i came across pastor jesse smith's message regarding long dresses in the bible after listening to this message i cleaned out my closet completely i would like to thank you for clarifying the importance of dressing modestly i am really grateful to god and to this ministry for today i can say i no longer wish to dress as i did but according to the bible mc january 23 2016. two days later m.c wrote more she a friend from church was extremely happy that i shared this video with her once again i am very grateful to god and yourself for the impact this video has had in my life i was able to visit our neighborhood goodwill and purchase some skirts and dresses at a very reasonable price i shared this testimony with a family member and she offered to purchase some additional skirts dresses for me from goodwill on friday praise god god never fails mc january 25th 2016. i watched this video many months ago and your message left a seed inside of my soul i have been wearing skirts and dresses for the last few months and i feel liberated i cannot go back to wearing pants because the holy ghost makes me feel dirty thank you for putting this profound message on the internet ka january 2018. i truly wanted to thank you for the video on women dressing modestly and how unscriptural it is for females to be wearing pants you presented the message quite well and it was educational and enlightening in the last few weeks the lord has laid it on my heart to totally dress in modest apparel long skirts and dresses and to ditch all the pants and shorts what a shame that very few churches take a stand on modesty you are to be commended for speaking the truth in love it seems that 99.9 of american women wear pants and don't give it a second thought it was a blessing watching your teachings on that subject i appreciate the work you put into it again thank you lf october 2016. hair length video testimonies thank you brother smith this was a blessing to me and i fully understand now that i should not even trim my hair gl june 9 2016. thank god for this message before i used to cut my hair like a boy but i will never in my life cut my hair again now i know it is against god's word thank you so much man of god pf august 2017 modest clothing video testimonies i have just watched your video on youtube concerning what christians should wear and what the bible teaches about nakedness i just wanted to say what a good video it is i am tired of christians making excuses for exposing legs and other parts of themselves and trying to use the bible to justify it i was very glad to find your video which explains it in such a clear way md july 7th 2016. i watched the videos on your youtube channel about modest clothing immediately i was aware that i needed to make adjustments on the clothing that i currently own i am so blessed to have come across your channel by the way gn may 28 2017. thank you for delivering your message in a kind loving way it's confirmation i actually asked god how do you want me to dress then i stumbled upon your video glory to god ms november 2017 thank you dear i'm transformed jc september 2017. frequently asked questions answering viewers questions on my youtube channel has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences it is very challenging at times because i am limited in my knowledge and experience despite the uneasy feeling at the pit of my stomach when i read a question i've never heard before the uncertainty drives me to dig deeper in the word and history in order to find the truth as a result the reward is learning more about god's word which i am then able to preach to my congregation i love how this process challenges me to be more like the bereans who search the scriptures daily in order to know the truth each topic below makeup long dresses and hair length will include three or more questions and answers i try to choose the most frequently asked and most challenging questions at times the punctuation and grammar were edited for clarity makeup questions question number one god bless your heart for trying to correct the body of christ but the scriptures you cited spoke to the heart of evil jezebel and the rebellion of israel what about esther who took an entire year to prepare for the king p.s january 2018 answer dear friend thank you for the respectful tone of your comment first the three scriptures i quoted on my makeup youtube video clearly identified face painting as an evil trait as god never asked anyone to face paint and all three women were under the judgment of god for their idolatry second esther never painted her face there seems to be a huge misunderstanding among churches with esther as she never used facial cosmetics she was purified using oils but not face painting esther cannot be used as an example to support makeup wearing as she was never given cosmetics esther 2 9 and 212 state that she was given things for purification which were oils of myrrh and sweet odors it never says she was given makeup to paint her face question two what about a lady who has defects like acne or scars from an accident or surgery what about a bad burn that can be covered with full cover foundation a little blush come on what about if it's your daughter or your wife with aging spots feeling ugly in front of you rc november 2017 answer thank you for the questions first i am very happy you refrain from lipstick and other makeup second i would encourage those with scars to seek god about this topic but since we know god never changes so it would seem god would give them the same answer makeup is a heathen trait that should be avoided when people see their scars the women could use them for a testimony about the grace of god for keeping them healthy or alive third we teach women and men should never wear any makeup under any condition i know that seems harsh to you but we obey based upon our love for jesus and his holy bible you said a little blush is acceptable but to me i respectfully say that your words remind me of a little leaven leavens the whole lump from first corinthians 5 verse 6 a little bit of sin is still sin and will grow into more sin a little bit of worldliness is still worldly we must not love the world neither the things that are in the world last if my wife or daughters feel ugly due to aging spots i will reassure them that i love them unconditionally and that they are fearfully and wonderfully made in god's sight and mine question number three god tells us to obey his commandments so obviously those are sins is wearing makeup and trousers sinful they're obviously out of order as god is an orderly god but are they truly sins or is it semantics just curious bj november 2017 answer thank you for the question crossdressing or men wearing skirts and women wearing pants is a sin and even more an abomination according to deuteronomy 22 verse 5. makeup is a sin as well as god told israel not to learn the ways of the heathen in jeremiah 10 verse 2. make up wearing is an expression of pride also a proud look what could be more prideful than wearing a false face to impress others is an abomination according to proverbs 6 verses 16 and 17 long dresses for women questions and answers question number one pastor jesse smith if you have answered this before excuse me i don't have the strength to read all the comments below this rule of no cross dressing was made back in the times when men wore robes jesus included men and women wore what we would call skirts now the women wore head coverings and men covered their heads when they were praying or traveling in the heat so when did this rule pertain to pants if originally men and women both wore robes with belts tied around the waist pl december 2017 answer yes the rule of deuteronomy 22 5 was made around 1300 bc faithful jews have observed separate garments for men and women ever since orthodox jewish women wear long skirts to this day jesus never sinned according to hebrews 4 verse 15 so we know even he kept the rule of deuteronomy 22 5. the robes in the days of jesus had multiple layers such as when jesus spoke of coats and cloaks in matthew 5 verse 40. but the robes had to have been different for men and women for god commanded a difference in garments from what i have read the women's garments were longer than the men's and dragged against the ground plus the outer robes were styled differently so an observer could tell instantly if the person was a male or female at first glance throughout all history since the days of moses all believers whether jew or christian have had a separation of garments for men and women as for pants men began to wear them in the 1600s and have worn them ever since women did not start wearing pants regularly until the 1970s in our judeo-christian culture the founders of the faith chose pants for men and dresses for women and god honored them by making the united states the greatest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world i believe god did this because the founders love christ the bible and holiness now the united states has fallen from god but in each culture they have the responsibility from god to wear separate garments since the bible does not literally say pants and dresses recently bruce jenner's decision to cross-dress open the eyes of the true bible believers to the need for men to dress like men and women to dress like women jenner is committing an abomination by dressing like a woman the same outcry against his immorality was the same outcry in the 20th century when women began wearing pants read the book women and pants by cynthia gregg and catherine smith question number two so if we are going to be consistent in using the deuteronomy 22 5 passage should we follow the same teaching with all of these other items of clothing like pants t-shirts socks underwear skirts and blouses dh december 2016 answer first i would say that if you question the validity of the pants on women you need to study deeper into the subject i hope you will devote some time into searching for the truth for if you do you will find it god promised to reveal truth to those who would seek for it second as for every item of clothing i cannot say that we must make every item separate for the bible does not teach that as far as i know but on a personal level yes my wife and i do not wear any of the same clothes she does not wear my shirts we have separate socks and all other garments she looks like a woman and her outer garments reveal her female gender i look like a man and my outer garments reveal my masculine gender lastly think of the social disgust when bruce jenner came out as a woman in 2015. one reason this was so evil was because he was breaking deuteronomy 22 5 dressing as a woman which is an abomination the public discussed that many expressed at generous cross-dressing with the same disgust that society expressed when women began wearing pants in the 1940s through 1960s it is historical and factual let me know if you want the resources question 3 why can't pants be modest what about women that work out it can be rather dangerous to work out in long skirts i do agree with modesty i just don't see why it has to be long skirts all the time i can be perfectly modest and covered in pants plus most jobs that young girls can get entry level will require you to wear slacks bb february 2016 answer thank you for the comment first pants on a woman can technically be modest loose or not tight and covering the loins thighs and lower legs but yet there still must be a separation in men and women's garments according to deuteronomy 22 5 so we do not believe women should ever wear pants technically a dress on a man could be modest but the fact the man would be wearing garments pertaining to a woman would break the word of god and be wrong second i know numerous women who work out in full length skirts it is only dangerous if a person participates in dangerous exercises i think the wisdom of god would tell our hearts to not endanger our bodies and avoid exercises that are dangerous surely you can find alternative exercises that are less dangerous and get the same results third it has to be long skirts for women all the time because god said so jesus kept all the law and never sinned he honored all the old testament including deuteronomy 22 5 all the time jesus wore garments that pertained to men all the time we should follow his example wouldn't you agree fourth if a job required a woman to wear men's clothes she should look elsewhere for a job in order to honor god's word any job that required a believer to disobey the commands of god would not be in the plan of god for their life i believe if we honor god god will honor us and provide a job for us as he is jehovah jireh our provider hair length questions question number one how about if the ends of the hair are split frazzled or damaged is just trimming those ends to encourage a woman's hair to grow even longer and healthier an exception cm august 2017 answer friend we do not find any trimming of women's hair in the entire bible from cover to cover from genesis to revelation at our church we teach that a woman is not instructed to cut trim or shave any hair from her head because we never see god instructing godly obedient women to do so in the bible also there are some differing opinions that trimming hair keeps hair healthy i have heard from numerous christian women who never trim their hair that say their hair is healthier because they do not trim the split ends hair must be taken care of and cared for daily so as not to encourage breaks having a healthy diet and lifestyle will also limit the amount of split ends at our church we simply teach the bible which never gives any godly woman the command to cut or trim her hair in any way question number two how long do you think a man's hair is allowed to be what would you say is the maximum length cb december 2017 answer that's a good question sir i would say the longest hair length for a man would be to the neck or shoulder area but that is just my own idea recall that jewish priests were to have short hair and paul commanded christian men to have short hair according to ezekiel 44 20 and first corinthians 11 verse 14. as men we always want to make sure we are the leaders in holiness and modesty men's hair must show that there is a separation between male and female that is why i recommended that men in our church cut their hair quite short so that their male gender is instantly perceived by those that look at them question number three um didn't jesus have shoulder length hair e m november 2017 answer we do not know the exact length of jesus's hair but again even shoulder length hair on a man is not uncut hair uncut hair is what god commands for all women in first corinthians 11 verses 1 to 16. women are called to not cut their hair ever men are called in the new testament to cut their hair if you cut your hair you are obeying the bible since you are a man you should seek to keep your hair short for a woman's hair should be uncut if you grow your hair long and do not cut it you are disobeying the bible god wants women to have uncut hair so the shorter the hair that men have the more different they will look than women god wants a separation and difference between men and women in their hair duties in life and even outer garments many images of christ show him with shoulder-length hair but that length would be much shorter than the women of his day who probably had uncut hair down to their waist if not longer question number four is god unfair because i do not have long hair i'm an african american woman mc august 2017 answer friend god is not unfair i am sorry if there is a misunderstanding about my video i apologize that my video did not address the issue of how some women of different races cannot grow long hair god wants all women to have uncut hair no matter the race the actual length does not matter god wants women to have uncut hair god never asked a godly woman to cut her hair in the entire bible as long as a woman's hair is uncut we know god's word is kept and fulfilled god is pleased with women as long as they do not cut their hair god is not asking for 12 inches of hair length 24 inches or any other specific number of inches he is only asking for uncut hair the most frequently asked question after answering hundreds of questions on youtube and via email there has been one question that has been asked more than any other in regards to a modest outward appearance the question has been asked in various ways but at its core can be stated as the following since the bible says that god looks upon the heart and not the outward appearance why should i care about my outward appearance the question is suggesting that first samuel 16 verse 7 teaches christians should not worry about the outward appearance but that is certainly a misapplication of scripture which states but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart at first glance this question might seem to have some validity but the wisdom of the holy spirit gives us at least three reasons why first samuel 16 7 does not excuse christians from having standards for their outward appearance first this question has taken first samuel 16 verse 7 out of context and applied it in a way that god did not intend in context first samuel 16 verse 7 is god's correction to his prophet samuel about how he chooses a king samuel was in bethlehem at jesse's to anoint the next king of israel to replace saul the rebellious king samuel had seen some of jesse's sons and assumed that eliab jesse's oldest son would be the lord's anointed or future king based upon his physical stature but the faithful god corrected samuel by letting him know that he did not choose kings based upon their countenance or height god revealed that he chose kings based upon the condition of their hearts and david was a man after the heart of god the context of first samuel 16 verse 7 is not about makeup hair length separate garments for men and women or modest clothing a bible teacher anointed of the holy spirit would rightly divide first samuel 16 verse 7 and place it in its proper context which is god's requirement when choosing a righteous king applying first samuel 16 verse 7 to say that god is not interested in our outward appearance would be a complete misapplication second first samuel 16 verse 7 cannot disall or negate the numerous commands of god elsewhere in scripture about our outward appearance remember first timothy 2 9 paul commanded women to wear modest clothing he lived around 1 000 years after samuel and still commanded christian women to wear modest clothing there's no record of paul writing that christians do not need to care about their outward appearance since god cared only about their hearts remember first corinthians 11 verses 1 to 16 paul taught that it is a shame for a man to have uncut hair and for a woman to have trimmed hair i could keep reminding you of all the scriptures from previous chapters in this book that command believers to conform their outward appearance to god's loving preferences but i will stop here because i trust that the holy spirit has shown you the heir of using first corinthians 16 7 to give people a license to present themselves with a worldly sinful outward appearance third the outward appearance often not always reveals the condition of the heart and the bible is full of examples cain the murdering son of the wicked one changed his facial countenance after god rejected his disobedient sacrifice and eventually left the presence of god in full rebellion to the word of the lord saul's countenance changed for the worse when the evil spirits were troubling his mind evil hoarse women used seductive facial expressions in order to tempt men into acts of adultery and fornication the clothing of harlots revealed their occupation the maniac of gadaro was naked because of the influence of the legion of demons inside of him based upon these five examples it would be foolish to say god does not care about the outward appearance of course the outward appearance does not always reveal the true condition of the heart as the pharisees proved during the earthly ministry of the lord jesus christ jesus said that these evil wicked hypocritical children of hell had a clean beautiful outward appearance but were full of dead men's bones this truth is evident today as many of the world's major religions require that their leaders and followers dress modestly and yet their idolatry hatred and rejection of the gospel of jesus christ proves that they too are the children of hell the spiritual children of their father the devil undoubtedly god cares much about the outward appearances of his children as i have demonstrated through the scores of scripture cited in this book's previous chapters god does indeed look upon our heart condition but our obedience to or rejection of the rightly divided word of god reveals our heart condition to those around us let us obey the bible's doctrines about our outward appearance from the heart but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you conclusion god is still spreading his word through many channels one of which is youtube just as the printing press of the 19th century drastically increased spreading the truth of god's word today the internet does the same along with the spread of truth though comes questions which the vigilant christian will be prepared to answer the holy bible has all the answers we need for the questions people have about the way of holiness if we search the scriptures as jesus commanded as the bereans modeled we will find the life-giving answers to all inquiries about the ways of god this is why regular church attendance is absolutely necessary for a genuine christian paul taught that the five preaching gifts in the house of god would answer all of our questions bringing believers to completion and stability in the faith david the man after the heart or will of god had the same respect for the house of god david knew god's faithfulness in revealing his will to his people in the house of god he knew god would reveal his will through the teaching of his word in his house saying one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple we know god does the same today as we gather in our churches and feast upon the preaching of truth while i am thankful for the internet helping to spread the gospel i know it is a secondary tool of god the lord's primary tool is live preaching with the anointing and power of the holy ghost as jesus commanded in the great commission the disciples obeyed this command preaching the gospel and the lord worked with them giving them supernatural signs our church will continue to do the same and experience the same results by god's grace
