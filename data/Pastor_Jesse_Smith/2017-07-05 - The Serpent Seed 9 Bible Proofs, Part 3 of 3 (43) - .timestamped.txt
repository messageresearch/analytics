[0:06] proof number six of the serpent seed is
[0:09] God's punishment for Eve focused on
[0:11] sexual reproduction and her desire or
[0:15] longing for her
[0:17] husband in Genesis 3:16 God issued a
[0:20] two-fold punishment on Eve because she
[0:23] was deceived by the serpent into eating
[0:25] the forbidden fruit unto the woman he
[0:27] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[0:30] in thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt
[0:32] bring forth children and thy desire
[0:34] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[0:36] rule over
[0:38] Thee the first fold of God's punishment
[0:40] upon Eve was that she would experience
[0:43] multiplied or increased sorrow from the
[0:45] conception of children all the way to
[0:47] the delivery of children notice that the
[0:49] first consequence of Eve sin focus on
[0:52] her sexual reproduction of seed or
[0:54] offspring we can all recognize that
[0:57] throughout the Bible God's punishments
[0:59] or Consequences
[1:00] always fitted the crimes for example the
[1:03] Old Testament law of Moses taught
[1:05] punishments fit the crimes such as eye
[1:08] for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand
[1:11] foot for foot according to Exodus
[1:15] 21:4 a second example would be David's
[1:17] sin of adultery with Bas Sheba because
[1:20] David shed innocent blood the sword of
[1:22] Bloodshed would never depart from his
[1:24] house according to 2 Samuel 129 and10
[1:28] because David laid with uriah's wife
[1:29] wife privately God would allow David
[1:32] wives to be taken from him and laid with
[1:35] publicly before all Israel According to
[1:37] second Samuel 12 11 and
[1:39] 12 in the case of Eve sin God was no
[1:43] different than he was with Israel and
[1:45] David the consequences of her sins fit
[1:48] her
[1:49] transgressions the pain and suffering
[1:51] that all women experience in bringing
[1:52] forth seed or offspring is a constant
[1:56] Universal reminder from God to all of
[1:59] Eve's daughters that she willingly
[2:01] received or accepted the wrong seed in
[2:03] the beginning from the
[2:05] serpent because Eve broke her marriage
[2:07] covenant and received the wrong seed she
[2:10] would experience suffering bringing
[2:11] forth any and all seed because Eve
[2:15] failed in the area of sexual
[2:16] reproduction all women have increased
[2:18] suffering in sexual
[2:21] reproduction if Eve had eaten a literal
[2:23] Apple why didn't God punish her mouth
[2:26] and all apple trees remember that God's
[2:29] punishments must fit the crimes and in
[2:31] Eve's case God's punishment focused on
[2:34] human reproduction and the body parts of
[2:36] the loins that are used for that process
[2:39] which again proves Eve and Adam sin with
[2:41] their loins because they cover their
[2:43] loins immediately after eating because
[2:46] of the feelings of nakedness that go
[2:48] along with sexual sin the second fold of
[2:51] God's punishment upon Eve was that her
[2:53] desire would now be upon her own husband
[2:56] again as God's punishments fit the
[2:58] crimes God was commanding Eve to desire
[3:01] or long for her own husband which means
[3:04] that before God's command Eve desired or
[3:06] longed for someone else and not her
[3:09] husband we know it was The Serpent and
[3:11] the fruit of adultery that Eve longed
[3:13] for as Eve was guilty of longing or
[3:16] lusting after the act of adultery
[3:18] because remember that the Bible says sin
[3:20] entered the world through her
[3:23] lust it is important to notice in the
[3:26] scripture that Adam recognized that Eve
[3:27] was pregnant in Genesis 3: vers 20
[3:31] immediately after God identified the two
[3:33] separate seeds in Genesis 3:15 Adam
[3:36] called his wife's name Eve because she
[3:38] was already the mother of all living two
[3:42] seeds or children were already living
[3:44] and growing inside Eve's womb and Adam
[3:47] recognized that Eve would be the mother
[3:49] of all living persons whether they were
[3:51] good or
[3:54] evil proof seven of the serpent seed is
[3:57] the serpent was humanlike before the
[3:59] fall
[4:01] when you carefully study the scriptures
[4:02] about the serpent in Genesis 3 you will
[4:05] notice that he was very different than
[4:06] snakes are today he was so different
[4:09] that he was
[4:10] humanlike first the serpent was more
[4:12] subtle which means shrewd Sly or crafty
[4:16] than any other beast of the field that
[4:18] the Lord had made the serpent was the
[4:20] only Beast we are aware of that God made
[4:22] with the ability to talk and to use
[4:25] intellectual reasoning making him very
[4:27] close to a human being that is why why
[4:29] Satan selected the serpent to indwell
[4:32] and deceive Eve for Satan was present in
[4:35] the garden of God and is known to
[4:37] possess animals and
[4:40] beasts second the serpent was an upright
[4:42] creature before the fall because after
[4:45] the fall God cursed the serpent to go on
[4:47] his belly the rest of his days the
[4:49] serpent was somewhat in between a
[4:51] chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man
[4:54] standing upright and able to carry an
[4:56] intellectual conversation with the
[4:58] deceived Eve
[5:01] third the serpent had a seed that could
[5:03] and did mix with Eve's reproductive
[5:06] parts causing her to conceive the
[5:08] Serpent's own seed according to God in
[5:10] Genesis
[5:12] 3:15 when this happened God cursed the
[5:15] serpent he changed every bone in the
[5:17] Serpent's body so that he had to crawl
[5:19] like a snake science can try all it
[5:21] wants to and it won't find the missing
[5:23] link God saw to that man is smart and he
[5:27] can see an association of man with
[5:29] animal and he tries to prove it out by
[5:31] Evolution there isn't any Evolution but
[5:35] man and animal did mingle that's one of
[5:37] the mysteries of God that has remained
[5:39] hidden but here it is revealed it
[5:42] happened right back there in the midst
[5:43] of Eden when Eve turned away from life
[5:46] to accept death we hope that your mental
[5:49] picture of what the serpent looked like
[5:51] in the Garden of Eden has now been
[5:52] changed to match the description given
[5:54] to us straight from the Bible a
[5:57] humanlike upright standing creature with
[5:59] the ability to have an intellectual
[6:01] conversation with a human
[6:04] being proof eight of the Serpent's Seed
[6:07] is Cain was not of Adam but was of that
[6:10] Wicked one the
[6:13] serpent according to the Holy Spirit
[6:15] Cain was not the son of Adam but was the
[6:18] son of the serpent according to 1 John
[6:20] 3:12 not as Cain who was of that Wicked
[6:23] one and slew his brother if the Bible
[6:26] teaches that Cain was of the wicked one
[6:28] then Adam could not have the wicked one
[6:30] John was speaking of for the Bible also
[6:32] said Adam was a Son of God in Luke
[6:35] 3:38 this brings us to the truth of the
[6:38] two separate seed lines the seed of Adam
[6:41] and the seed of the serpent in the womb
[6:43] of Eve were two separate seeds or sons
[6:46] from separate
[6:48] impregnations she was carrying twins
[6:50] with Cain's conception sometime previous
[6:53] to that of abeles to those who think
[6:55] that this is not possible let it be
[6:57] known that the medical records are
[6:59] complete with cases where women have
[7:01] carried twins who were of separate OVA
[7:04] and separate insemination with the
[7:06] fertilization of the eggs being days
[7:07] apart and not only so but some of the
[7:10] records show that the twins were fed by
[7:12] separate males this is called
[7:14] heteropaternal super fundation here's an
[7:17] article we found from the Journal of
[7:19] forensic science that validates
[7:21] heteropaternal super
[7:24] fundation here's a case report from the
[7:26] Journal of forensic Sciences July 199
[7:30] 94 the title of the case report is
[7:33] paternity identification in twins with
[7:36] different
[7:38] fathers the abstract reads if a female
[7:41] has sexual intercourse with two males at
[7:44] Short intervals within the same
[7:46] ovulatory period super fundation may
[7:49] occur this article reports two cases of
[7:52] paternity identification in twins the
[7:55] results showed that each twin had come
[7:57] from a different father thus great
[7:59] attention should be paid to such a
[8:01] situation when the Twin paternity
[8:03] identification is asked for we believe
[8:06] God allowed this medical research to
[8:09] provide additional support to prove what
[8:11] actually happened in the Garden of Eden
[8:13] that one female Eve had sexual
[8:16] intercourse with two different males The
[8:18] Serpent and Adam at Short intervals
[8:21] within the same ovulatory period and
[8:23] produced twins that came from two
[8:25] different fathers Cain from The Serpent
[8:27] and Abel from Adam
[8:31] these two separate seed lines have
[8:32] separate characteristics the seed of
[8:35] Adam are blessed and the seed of the
[8:37] serpent are cursed because of their
[8:39] separate
[8:40] characteristics Cain the seed of the
[8:42] serpent bore the full spiritual
[8:44] characteristics of Satan and the
[8:46] animalistic sensual or fleshly
[8:49] characteristic of the serpent no wonder
[8:52] the holy spirit said that Cain was of
[8:54] that Wicked one he was Cain was a liar
[8:57] and murderer just like Satan
[9:00] furthermore Cain was literally cursed by
[9:03] God just like God cursed the serpent in
[9:06] fact all Humanity that will be lost and
[9:08] sent to the Lake of Fire are called The
[9:10] Cursed God did not curse Adam or Eve God
[9:14] only cursed the ground for God cannot
[9:16] both curse and bless his children
[9:18] according to numbers
[9:20] 22:12 because Cain's cursed
[9:22] characteristics were so evil and
[9:24] contrary to God's obedient humble nature
[9:27] the Bible recorded Cain is having his
[9:29] own separate lineage in Genesis 4: 16-
[9:33] 26 Adam's seed or lineage was completely
[9:36] separate from canes as recorded in
[9:38] Genesis 5:
[9:42] 1-32 one point we want to emphasize
[9:45] about the two seed lines is that the
[9:47] physical genetic seeds of Adam and Cain
[9:49] are no longer separate because in the
[9:51] days of Noah the literal seed of the
[9:53] serpent passed through the ark and has
[9:56] now intermingled with the Godly seed so
[9:58] all man kind are affected by the genetic
[10:01] pollution of the serpent
[10:03] seed since the flood of Noah up until
[10:05] today God's seed or race are born of a
[10:08] spiritual seed and not a natural genetic
[10:11] seed God's blessed seed are recognized
[10:14] by the fact that they receive and obey
[10:16] the full word of God and are born again
[10:18] of the Holy Ghost according to 1 Peter 1
[10:21] ver
[10:22] 23 proof number nine of the serpent seed
[10:25] is the seed of the woman was a literal
[10:28] man Christ and so was the seed of the
[10:30] serpent aital Man
[10:34] Cain recall again that God himself said
[10:36] the serpent had a literal seed or human
[10:39] offspring according to Genesis 3:15 if
[10:42] we give credit to God in Genesis 3:15
[10:45] that the woman did have a seed then the
[10:47] serpent must surely have a seed also if
[10:50] the seed of the woman was a Manchild
[10:52] apart from the man then the seed of the
[10:54] serpent will have to be in the same
[10:56] pattern and that is another male must be
[10:58] born apart from human male
[11:04] instrumentality there is no student who
[11:06] does not know that the seed of the woman
[11:08] was the Christ who came by the
[11:10] instrumentality of God apart from Human
[11:13] intercourse the Virgin birth it is also
[11:17] just as well known that the predicted
[11:18] bruising of the Serpent's head was in
[11:21] actuality a prophecy concerning what
[11:24] Christ would accomplish against Satan at
[11:26] the cross there at the cross Christ
[11:29] would bruise the head of Satan while
[11:31] Satan would bruise the heel of the Lord
[11:34] as the seed of the woman was literally
[11:35] God reproducing himself in human flesh
[11:38] so the seed of the serpent is the
[11:40] literal way that Satan found he was able
[11:43] to open the door to himself into the
[11:45] human race it was impossible for Satan
[11:49] for he is only a created spirit being to
[11:51] reproduce himself in the manner which
[11:53] God reproduced himself so the Genesis
[11:56] account tells how he produced his seed
[11:58] and into introduced or injected himself
[12:01] into the human race also recall that
[12:04] Satan is called the serpent it is his
[12:06] seed or injection into the human race we
[12:09] are speaking of in closing there is much
[12:12] more that can be taught from the Bible
[12:14] about the seed of the serpent but we
[12:16] pray that what has been taught through
[12:18] these nine proofs of the serpent seed in
[12:20] this video Series has helped shine more
[12:22] Gospel Light upon the original sin in
[12:24] the Garden of Eden again we do not
[12:27] believe that someone has to understand
[12:29] and believe the doctrine of the serpent
[12:30] seed in order to be saved as the
[12:33] doctrine of repentance unto salvation
[12:35] leads true worshippers to eternal life
[12:38] but we do believe that if someone is
[12:40] saved Sanctified and also Born Again of
[12:43] the Holy Ghost then they will surely see
[12:45] the truth of the original sin because
[12:47] Jesus promised that the Holy Ghost would
[12:49] lead Believers into all truth in John
[12:52] 16:13 and the truth of the seed of the
[12:55] serpent is part of the full revelation
[12:57] of the word of God
[12:59] the truth of the seed of the serpent
[13:01] only shines light upon the Glorious work
[13:03] of redemption through the Virgin birth
[13:05] of Jesus Christ that we are all trying
[13:08] to
[13:11] see if you would like more scriptures
[13:13] about the serpent seed or have questions
[13:15] about this Doctrine please contact
[13:18] us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[13:21] the desire of your heart
