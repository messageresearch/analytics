[36:04] [Music]
[36:10] me
[36:12] [Music]
[36:24] christ praise god let's
[36:28] go to a few scriptures here i'd like to
[36:30] look at prove all things one more time i
[36:32] think i can finish today if the lord
[36:33] will help me
[36:37] and then lord willing tonight i'd like
[36:38] to look at uh blessings and cursings
[36:40] tonight it's quite a
[36:42] a huge subject in the bible and i've
[36:44] been uh looking on
[36:46] numerous websites i'm sorry yeah
[36:49] listening to numerous sermons and
[36:50] um it's a huge subject i'd like to
[36:54] look at that tonight by god's grace i'm
[36:55] really excited about that message just
[36:57] because it's kind of
[36:58] feels kind of fresh it feels kind of new
[37:00] it basically just boils down to
[37:02] uh reaping and sewing many times so
[37:05] we'll look at that you know whatever you
[37:07] sow
[37:08] that's what you reap so i'm just really
[37:10] excited about that one by god's grace
[37:12] um there's a lot of scriptures today i
[37:14] think i've uh and there's so many to go
[37:16] to
[37:16] why don't we just go to colossians two
[37:19] we'll just start there i mean there's
[37:20] many places as i said
[37:22] i'd like to finish this uh debate here
[37:25] as far as going over it i hope it's okay
[37:28] i've got a lot of good feedback on it
[37:30] different people
[37:30] listening and around the around the
[37:33] nation i guess a couple people at least
[37:35] around the nation
[37:36] and it helps me like this is where i'm
[37:38] at church and i you know
[37:40] this is one area where i've really grown
[37:42] had to grow in the lord
[37:44] to kind of address some of these
[37:45] questions about brother branham i never
[37:47] knew before
[37:48] before i just avoided them but uh doing
[37:51] this debate it's forced me to
[37:52] face them face to face and try to
[37:55] do what the bible says search the
[37:57] scriptures diligently right
[37:59] each day whether these things are so and
[38:02] i found their so
[38:03] amen the bible teachings are so the
[38:05] brother brethren have a human side
[38:07] certainly did moses have a human side no
[38:10] doubt
[38:11] abraham how about us do we have a human
[38:13] side that we're not always proud of
[38:16] certainly but i i said i told my family
[38:19] last night i said this is one area
[38:20] where i've really grown in the grace of
[38:22] the lord i've seen how much grace god
[38:24] had on brother branham but probably more
[38:26] so me
[38:27] right you put your own self in there wow
[38:29] god has had a lot of grace on me as well
[38:32] because i fall short of god's glory so
[38:35] i appreciate everybody's support and i
[38:37] hope this will be a blessing
[38:38] here today let's let's go to colossians
[38:41] two
[38:42] we'll just read verses one two and three
[38:44] uh the question we'll finish today lord
[38:46] willing it was the
[38:48] trinity question i asked our brother
[38:49] about
[38:51] but uh just for a scripture the godhead
[38:54] is a mystery therefore it's not
[38:56] um it's not a salvation issue it's a
[38:58] mystery issue
[39:00] according to the scriptures
[39:04] colossians 2
[39:08] i'll read 1 and 2 and then we can all
[39:12] read verse three together so let me read
[39:14] one and two
[39:15] for i would that ye knew what great
[39:18] conflict i have for you
[39:20] and for them at laodicea and for as many
[39:23] as have not seen my face in the flesh
[39:28] that their hearts i'm sorry that their
[39:30] hearts might be comforted
[39:32] so paul was burdened that the the saints
[39:34] hearts were
[39:36] a little bit wavering right he wanted
[39:37] them to feel comfort
[39:40] being knit together in love he wanted
[39:42] the saints in in their churches
[39:44] to feel like their hearts were connected
[39:46] and the only way that can be is if we
[39:48] all care for the same things
[39:50] right our greatest care our greatest
[39:52] love should be jesus christ
[39:53] amen that's how our hearts are knit
[39:55] together
[39:56] right they're sewn together they're
[39:58] they're bonded together by the love of
[40:00] christ
[40:02] being knit together in love and unto all
[40:05] riches of the full
[40:06] assurance of understanding
[40:10] see god wants us to understand exactly
[40:13] what he's doing with our lives right he
[40:14] wants to understand what
[40:15] what jesus wants to do with the bride
[40:19] to the acknowledgement of the mystery of
[40:21] god
[40:22] and of the father and of christ notice
[40:25] he didn't say the holy ghost because
[40:26] god's not three persons those are not
[40:29] three separate titles for three separate
[40:31] persons
[40:32] they're all titles to the one self-same
[40:34] person
[40:35] let's read verse three together one two
[40:37] three in
[40:38] whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom
[40:42] and knowledge how many want treasure
[40:44] from god amen
[40:46] there's one place for it it's in christ
[40:48] amen let's have one more word of prayer
[40:49] you have a need on your heart let's make
[40:50] it known unto god heavenly
[40:52] father there's something about this name
[40:54] this name of jesus christ
[40:56] the lord jesus christ we know there's
[40:58] many jesuses
[41:00] in mexico texas or spain
[41:03] but there's only one lord jesus christ
[41:06] thank you lord that there is a name
[41:09] above all names that's the name we honor
[41:11] that's the name we praise that's the
[41:12] name we worship today the lord jesus
[41:15] christ so lord come in your
[41:16] strength and your power meet the needs
[41:18] of the saints today father
[41:20] we're glad to be in your house and let
[41:21] the holy spirit just
[41:23] control this atmosphere lord meet you in
[41:25] every heart be obedient to the
[41:27] atmosphere of the holy ghost
[41:28] we thank you for the song special we
[41:31] thank you for all the songs
[41:32] brother amen and the musicians lord god
[41:34] now just let me do my part lord to get
[41:36] out of your way
[41:37] let the holy ghost speak today in jesus
[41:39] christ's name
[41:40] the saint said amen god bless you is
[41:43] being seated praise god
[41:52] uh so we'll go to this here and uh
[41:57] i studied on this all day yesterday uh
[41:59] the morning and then this morning i
[42:00] studied on the
[42:02] blessings and curses so i'm just asking
[42:05] the holy spirit to remind me of all that
[42:06] i studied yesterday so
[42:08] but god is good before i start i just
[42:11] have one
[42:12] apology i got to make
[42:15] so this week i received a email from
[42:19] uh people that are supporting rod bergen
[42:21] and believe the sign and i
[42:22] i made uh a false statement so i need to
[42:25] apologize about that to you as well
[42:28] um so let me references okay
[42:31] so brother rod left his message church
[42:34] because of
[42:35] child abuse and i said something wrong
[42:37] about it i said it was never
[42:39] taken to the law but apparently it was
[42:42] and i don't know for sure so this
[42:44] this individual representing um the
[42:47] brother rod i i debated
[42:49] emailed me this week and said i said
[42:50] something wrong so i said i'm sorry
[42:52] that i said i said at the moment what
[42:55] was the best of my knowledge
[42:57] so at this point i still don't know for
[43:00] sure but i do want to apologize if i
[43:02] shed any
[43:03] light on the situation that was negative
[43:05] towards brother rod
[43:07] he and i of course disagree bitterly but
[43:09] brother man tells us we need to
[43:11] have love even if we disagree bitterly
[43:13] with somebody
[43:14] because love is the greatest force in
[43:16] the universe and you can't help anybody
[43:18] unless you love them
[43:20] so i do want to apologize i'm so
[43:21] apparently ever you know believe the
[43:23] sign is watching all my sermons that's
[43:24] good
[43:26] i hope that's a blessing to them praise
[43:27] god
[43:29] it's these are things i got to just
[43:31] preach like i said
[43:33] i know people need to hear these things
[43:34] because it's a question in many's mind
[43:36] you know some people church they can
[43:38] just go like this they can say
[43:40] i don't have any questions i just
[43:41] believe the message and some people
[43:43] are genuinely that way they don't care
[43:46] but some people are inquisitive some
[43:48] people want answers to questions
[43:50] i'm that kind i like to know i put it
[43:53] off for a while you know for like eight
[43:54] years but
[43:55] you know in the meantime i was i could
[43:56] answer some of those questions i made a
[43:58] document i remember i shared it with the
[43:59] albion church and
[44:00] i had a document and i watched all the
[44:03] the youtube videos of believe the sign
[44:04] and i had a response to all of them
[44:06] and i shared it with i remember the
[44:07] brother newmer not dominic but his other
[44:10] brother
[44:11] i can't remember his name right now fine
[44:13] brother he still goes to the church up
[44:14] there
[44:15] uh but anyways i've always had uh
[44:18] a desire to know i'm that kind of a
[44:20] person i like to have answers the bible
[44:22] said a pastor's got to be ready to teach
[44:24] and so i want to be ready to teach if
[44:26] anybody had a question on those things
[44:28] um and so again i want to offer apology
[44:31] to brother rod i didn't mean to give any
[44:33] negative
[44:34] slant on you so apparently there was a
[44:37] child abuse case
[44:38] and we all condemn all child abuse
[44:42] we all do and the church said amen no
[44:44] matter which church
[44:45] we don't side with the church we side
[44:47] with the word amen
[44:48] but the thing is we don't know i don't
[44:50] know i wasn't there
[44:52] okay so i just want to say that in love
[44:56] apparently there was apparently someone
[44:58] took it to the law but they couldn't do
[45:00] anything about it
[45:01] and that's a shame all abuse is always
[45:05] wrong
[45:05] all the time all right so let's get
[45:08] started here i just want to
[45:09] start with that by god's grace so um
[45:12] let's finish up wednesday night i don't
[45:13] know if you saw wednesday night but on
[45:14] wednesday night i showed how
[45:16] brother branham said the blood didn't
[45:18] save you remember that but then he said
[45:20] later the blood does save you
[45:21] so i started with that example to show
[45:23] you that we have to rightly divide
[45:25] everything
[45:25] amen right if there's any question
[45:29] we have a duty to do that and church uh
[45:32] you know brother man may i don't know
[45:33] why brother random said that
[45:35] but just for a moment let's take the
[45:36] other side can you imagine how somebody
[45:38] who's against brother graham they could
[45:39] take that one quote
[45:41] where brother brahm said the blood
[45:42] doesn't save you and see how they can
[45:44] make us out to be a cult
[45:46] you see that but yet maybe he read
[45:49] something maybe he had a slip of the
[45:50] tongue a slip of the mind
[45:52] and he just said it wrong but you see
[45:54] how people can take they can take quotes
[45:56] and you can listen to it on the tape
[45:58] and make us look like some kind of a
[46:00] cult like oh you don't believe in the
[46:01] blood
[46:02] you don't believe the blood saves you
[46:03] that's the only thing that did save me
[46:05] was the blood of jesus christ right amen
[46:08] and god's grace to let me believe it
[46:09] amen amen
[46:10] because we're saved by grace through
[46:12] faith it is a gift of god
[46:14] amen praise god but see church i can
[46:17] understand how people can take some
[46:19] quotes
[46:20] when a man makes his mistake like
[46:21] brother man made a mistake
[46:23] he's just a man we all make mistakes but
[46:25] i can see how people can take that
[46:27] and if they've got the wrong spirit if
[46:28] they don't search it out themselves
[46:30] they could come to a wrong conclusion
[46:33] and so it behooves us to be able to have
[46:35] we should have an answer ready
[46:37] right for the hope that lies within us
[46:40] praise god
[46:41] uh so uh i'm sorry getting back i said
[46:45] does god have three minds uh we showed
[46:47] on wednesday night
[46:48] um how god only has uh well there's a
[46:51] mind of god
[46:52] the invisible spirit but then there was
[46:53] the human mind of christ
[46:55] and we showed how the mind of christ was
[46:57] limited the human mind
[46:59] all right uh so we looked at that and uh
[47:03] lord willing i'll just hit a few more
[47:05] things about the godhead
[47:06] i preached on it pretty hard on
[47:07] wednesday that was a i hope you enjoyed
[47:09] that
[47:10] um the true giants of the faith i want
[47:12] to say this the true
[47:14] giants of the faith never taught three
[47:16] persons
[47:17] praise god some of the giants over the
[47:20] last 500 years like
[47:21] luther well maybe more than that not
[47:23] luther wesley
[47:24] uh all these saints yeah they might have
[47:27] believed in three persons but
[47:28] they were not the bible writers the
[47:30] bible writers never taught three persons
[47:32] right and so uh the real giant so like
[47:36] jesus
[47:37] right and the bible authors only taught
[47:40] strict monotheism
[47:41] and jesus preached there's only one god
[47:44] there's only one person praise god mark
[47:47] 12 29 hero israel the lord our god is
[47:49] one lord
[47:50] praise god and i love to say this about
[47:52] the godhead everything the bible says
[47:54] about the godhead we can say amen too
[47:57] amen they can't i don't think they can
[47:59] necessarily do that
[48:00] as far as i i don't know i don't know
[48:02] for sure uh but hebrews 1 3 says jesus
[48:05] is the image of god's one person
[48:08] so the invisible person has a visible
[48:11] image praise god
[48:13] now i want to just let you know this if
[48:15] you haven't watched the
[48:16] the debate when we're in the middle of
[48:18] this trinity debate the
[48:20] one brother and i love him he's a nice
[48:21] brother he he
[48:23] he kind of stops the debate and he says
[48:25] jesse are you a father
[48:26] i said yeah i said jesse he said jesse
[48:28] are you a pastor i said yeah
[48:30] jesse are you a son and i thought what's
[48:31] he he's trying to prove to me the
[48:33] godhead by using a
[48:34] the the same thing that we believe and i
[48:37] started smiling
[48:39] and he said that's how i that's how i
[48:41] see the godhead yet he's a trinitarian
[48:44] so he uses a modalistic argument which
[48:47] there's many titles to one person
[48:50] to try to convince me of the trinity so
[48:53] he uses a non-trinity argument
[48:55] to convince me of the trinity and rod
[48:57] stopped him and said no no that's a
[48:58] modalistic
[48:59] belief and he said he knew that he told
[49:02] rod he said no i know that
[49:04] he said i know i'm using a oneness
[49:06] argument he said but that's the only way
[49:07] i can understand god
[49:09] now isn't that something and i found
[49:11] that in my readings too
[49:13] even strict trinitarians
[49:16] they know god is one they know god just
[49:18] changes his mask
[49:20] but they use it whenever it fits them
[49:22] conveniently but when they want to say
[49:24] oh there's three persons that jesus
[49:25] baptism
[49:26] then they inject tritheism into that so
[49:29] they rotate from the truth to air from
[49:32] truth to error but we just stay with the
[49:35] truth praise god
[49:36] amen all right uh so i just thought it
[49:39] was so
[49:39] striking that they're trying to use uh
[49:41] oneness arguments
[49:43] to promote the trinity but you can't do
[49:45] that because
[49:46] it adds to the word of god now remember
[49:48] church we're not modalistic because
[49:51] modalistic makes every person totally
[49:53] equal
[49:54] i'm sorry motorism makes each of the
[49:56] manifestations totally equal
[49:58] well jesus's body human body was not
[50:00] equal to god
[50:02] it was a form of god but it wasn't equal
[50:04] to god
[50:05] so that's why someone asked you are you
[50:07] a modalist no
[50:08] but does god change his mask yes
[50:12] that's right but we are not modalistic
[50:14] by definition
[50:15] we're holy ghost filled i guess we'll
[50:17] just call it like that
[50:18] uh holy ghost fieldest i'm not sure how
[50:20] to say that we're not modalists we're a
[50:22] christianist
[50:24] or just adding that is on the end of the
[50:26] word
[50:27] uh and then but our brothers now he got
[50:30] the last word on it because
[50:31] uh i never got to respond if you ask the
[50:33] question you don't get the last word on
[50:35] it in the debate
[50:36] so he his last word was god died upon
[50:38] the cross not jesus or
[50:40] not uh not anything less and i disagree
[50:43] god's spirit did not die on the cross
[50:46] the
[50:46] god's image died on the cross because
[50:49] god's spirit could never die
[50:51] amen okay and so i and so i just
[50:53] disagreed on many things there
[50:55] uh and i just i wish i would emphasize
[50:57] this because the bible says
[50:59] if you add to the word god's gonna call
[51:01] you a liar
[51:02] in other words these people can be saved
[51:04] but on that day
[51:05] uh and when the books are read remember
[51:09] brother man said the books will be read
[51:10] the bible says you'll be judged by your
[51:12] works
[51:12] one of their works will be they lied
[51:14] about god
[51:16] but yet they'll still be saved because
[51:17] the bible says every man will be judged
[51:19] by his works
[51:20] those that are saved on the right hand
[51:21] of jesus those that are rejected on the
[51:23] left
[51:24] but as part of their testimony they'll
[51:26] be called a liar
[51:27] but church we'll have none of that
[51:28] praise god right because all of our sins
[51:30] are forgiven praise god amen they're
[51:32] under the blood of jesus christ
[51:34] they won't nobody be calling us a liar
[51:36] we're the bride of jesus christ amen
[51:39] because we already confessed them but
[51:41] they died these people many some of
[51:42] these people not all of them
[51:43] some of them will die and they'll be
[51:45] clinging to these lies that they know
[51:46] it's not the bible and so on judgment
[51:49] day it'll all be seen
[51:50] yes they were saved but they believe
[51:52] lies
[51:54] and they'll be judged they'll have to be
[51:56] judged by that
[51:58] so see we don't want to uh have any lies
[52:00] in our beliefs
[52:01] right we want we just want the truth of
[52:03] god praise god
[52:05] all right now
[52:08] uh yeah the theologians do the same
[52:10] thing whenever it's convenient
[52:11] they use tritheism three gods whenever
[52:14] they when it's convenient then they'll
[52:15] use
[52:16] our our understanding of god and you
[52:18] can't do that you can't rotate
[52:20] okay now like i said i'm going to try to
[52:21] go quick because we only had five
[52:22] questions for the debate
[52:24] so his fourth question to me was how can
[52:26] you justify
[52:27] god requiring the save like martin
[52:29] luther and john wesley
[52:31] to believe false doctrine like the like
[52:33] the trinity
[52:34] so actually his question was how how how
[52:37] can how can god require you to believe
[52:38] satanic doctrine
[52:40] to be saved because brother adam said
[52:43] the trinity is of the devil and it is
[52:46] right three persons is of the devil
[52:48] because it's a lie
[52:50] and so my reply i didn't just put it up
[52:52] here no i'm sorry i didn't put up there
[52:53] so let me just check my notes
[52:55] uh so my reply on number four
[52:59] was this uh i said i don't believe god
[53:03] requires
[53:04] anybody to believe false doctrine to be
[53:06] saved
[53:07] all god requires you to be saved is
[53:09] repentance
[53:11] because you're saved by grace through
[53:12] faith it is a gift and not of works
[53:15] lest any man boast and i use the thief
[53:17] on the cross he was
[53:19] casting rebukes in jesus face at the
[53:22] beginning
[53:22] while he's hanging on the cross but the
[53:23] holy spirit turned his heart the bible
[53:26] said
[53:26] he cast the same in jesus teeth the
[53:29] thieves also
[53:30] cast the same in his teeth and all that
[53:32] jesus required
[53:33] was for him to say sorry and recognize
[53:35] that jesus was innocent
[53:37] and they said remember me lord in your
[53:40] kingdom and jesus said you'll be with me
[53:42] in paradise praise god
[53:44] so i said that's all that's required is
[53:45] repentance for salvation
[53:47] and i said as for messengers of the
[53:49] trinity god doesn't save by the godhead
[53:52] doctrine
[53:52] he saves by grace through the blood
[53:55] right
[53:57] and i just i went on to show how the
[53:59] bible says
[54:01] there had to be restoration so the
[54:04] church ages
[54:04] had to lose revelation right the saints
[54:08] lost some revelation
[54:10] because they had to battle the depths of
[54:12] satan so as satan went to the very
[54:14] depths the saints would lose
[54:16] revelation but then god would restore
[54:18] praise god he would he would begin
[54:20] reforming in martin luther and john west
[54:22] and john wesley was the age of the open
[54:24] door there was never a greater
[54:26] missionary age than
[54:27] john wesley so god was restoring praise
[54:31] god
[54:32] but the bible said there must come a
[54:34] restoration praise god
[54:36] and so we're glad to be a part of it how
[54:37] many know that's scriptural restoration
[54:39] is a great part of this day amen
[54:42] and then i said i said brother but
[54:44] there's a wise and foolish version
[54:46] for every age and went down through that
[54:48] there's always
[54:49] four kinds of vessels there's two saved
[54:51] two lost
[54:52] four kinds of ground it's clearly seen
[54:54] all through the scripture
[54:56] now his reply to me was i was implying a
[54:58] lot
[54:59] so my verses about wise and foolish were
[55:01] making a lot of implications
[55:02] and yet the whole time i only quoted the
[55:04] scripture it's funny how
[55:06] they can say all those accusations but
[55:08] it ain't true
[55:10] and all i'm using is scripture uh
[55:13] so he doesn't believe in wise and
[55:14] foolish virgins well then you don't
[55:15] believe in jesus
[55:16] right you don't believe in all of jesus
[55:18] said jesus said there's wise and foolish
[55:20] praise god
[55:22] now he's and he shared this quote i'll
[55:24] read it in just a moment
[55:26] he says but brother branham said if you
[55:28] anyone who doesn't believe the messenger
[55:30] perished
[55:33] and then he shared a quote uh brother
[55:34] branham a vision of the plum and apple
[55:37] trees
[55:38] both trees were found on the cross and
[55:40] then he he shares a quote that he
[55:42] thought contradicted it
[55:43] okay so let's go through the quote so
[55:45] let's read this here by god's grace
[55:47] probably this is proving his word here's
[55:49] the one about you're not saved unless
[55:51] you follow the messenger
[55:53] now remember the message of noah's time
[55:54] was only by faith not a scientific
[55:56] proven
[55:57] but today the message is according to
[55:59] the word of god and scientifically
[56:01] proven
[56:01] elijah come first doing miracles not
[56:04] doing any preaching
[56:05] just going from place to place doing
[56:06] miracles the next time he come in the
[56:08] form of john the baptist
[56:09] he came doing no miracles just preaching
[56:13] and the third time he comes there's both
[56:15] miracles and preaching see
[56:17] how it is watch how in the continuity
[56:19] the scriptures run
[56:20] we just could spend plenty of time on
[56:22] that but we won't we'll admit it because
[56:23] i believe
[56:24] you get the idea how many got the idea
[56:28] in other words the elijah anointing it
[56:29] manifests differently each time
[56:31] you've got to look to the word to see
[56:33] how it manifests
[56:35] now he did that in the age just as he
[56:38] did in all ages
[56:39] and like he will do just as he promised
[56:41] to do
[56:43] god promises anything then he comes down
[56:45] and proves his word
[56:46] to be right all that believe all that
[56:49] believed the message of that age
[56:51] come in and was saved so it will it be
[56:54] in
[56:55] any age all who did not believe the
[56:57] message and the messenger perish now
[56:59] he's talking about
[57:00] noah if you disbelieve noah's message
[57:04] were you saved you're lost
[57:06] lost but what type was that that was the
[57:09] type of the what
[57:10] tribulation yeah so this is speaking of
[57:13] not
[57:14] soul perishing but body perishing
[57:17] right because we know there's going to
[57:19] be souls in the tribulation
[57:21] who have to die in the tribulation their
[57:23] bodies perish but they'll be saved on
[57:25] the judgment day
[57:27] so it depends how you apply the quote
[57:29] right in noah's day anyone who
[57:31] rejected noah died physically okay could
[57:34] there be
[57:35] soul saves and from nose i don't know
[57:36] looks like they're all lost because
[57:38] jesus was preaching to the souls that
[57:40] were in prison
[57:40] and rebuking them for not believing noah
[57:42] noah seems a type the foolish virgin
[57:45] right but we know there's other ages of
[57:48] course
[57:49] where people can perish physically but
[57:51] they can be saved
[57:52] right they can be saved spiritually
[57:55] praise god
[57:56] just like the fifth seal so all those
[57:58] saints uh that died in the holocaust six
[58:00] million
[58:00] six million souls church don't forget
[58:02] that six million died in this in the
[58:04] world war
[58:05] ii in the holocaust but the jesus
[58:07] promises them white robes
[58:10] right if they lived true to all that
[58:11] they knew
[58:14] so they may have perished physically
[58:16] they rejected
[58:17] christ they rejected brother man's
[58:19] message they rejected everything
[58:20] but yet they can still be saved and
[58:22] brother man said the fifth seal is thus
[58:24] saith the lord
[58:26] okay now i'm going to skip that because
[58:27] he just goes on to say more about it
[58:29] now later in the same sermon church he
[58:32] says lot
[58:33] escaped so he says again uses the
[58:35] foolish virgin escapes
[58:38] okay so that quote has to be balanced
[58:40] with the other one
[58:41] any who did not believe the message and
[58:42] the messenger perished
[58:44] okay so lot didn't follow abraham but
[58:47] yet he escaped right he escaped
[58:48] destruction
[58:50] uh so his his soul was saved in that
[58:52] case his body was saved because he typed
[58:53] the foolish virgin
[58:55] okay so i just feel like our brother
[58:57] misunderstands the quotes
[59:00] now here's a quote they asked brother
[59:01] brand what about people that believe in
[59:03] the lord and
[59:04] and not the way you preach the man said
[59:06] they don't have to believe this they
[59:07] don't have to believe the way i preach
[59:09] it see
[59:09] for the last day message will they be
[59:11] saved yes if they believe the lord
[59:14] praise god hallelujah and then he says
[59:17] this he says
[59:18] if they disagree and say i don't believe
[59:20] the word i don't believe this is right i
[59:22] don't believe in the baptism of the holy
[59:23] ghost
[59:23] that shows where they're headed for the
[59:25] tribulation period and that's what all
[59:27] these
[59:27] one works of grace believers believe did
[59:30] you catch that
[59:31] i didn't say three works of grace i
[59:33] called them one works of grace
[59:35] or one work of grace rather that's what
[59:38] our precious friend rod and
[59:39] many denominations they they believe
[59:41] there's only one work of grace and then
[59:43] you've got everything done
[59:45] they believe as soon as you come out of
[59:46] egypt you're in the promised land no sir
[59:49] you've only come out of egypt only
[59:51] you've only got one word
[59:52] there's two more works that must be done
[59:54] praise god
[59:55] there's two more works of a proving
[59:57] ground of your faith
[59:58] do you really want to possess the land
[1:00:00] do you really have faith in god's
[1:00:02] promise amen
[1:00:03] will you will you persevere and possess
[1:00:05] the land amen
[1:00:07] that's right see they don't believe in
[1:00:11] the baptism they just believe in one
[1:00:12] work of grace
[1:00:14] he says shows where they're headed for
[1:00:15] the tribulation period but those who
[1:00:17] that's what jesus taught right those who
[1:00:18] didn't have the oil tribulation
[1:00:21] those who can accept the word in his
[1:00:22] phone it's not me preaching it
[1:00:24] because as the bible says so those who
[1:00:27] accept is free
[1:00:28] because the word's already been judged
[1:00:30] so see what they do church they take one
[1:00:32] quote against another and they try to
[1:00:34] make brother brahm contradict himself
[1:00:35] now we know there's times he does
[1:00:37] contradict himself
[1:00:39] but we got to take it back to the word
[1:00:40] praise god
[1:00:42] all right now the vision of the apple
[1:00:44] and plum trees i'm not going to read all
[1:00:46] of it because it's
[1:00:47] it's from 1933 apparently from what i
[1:00:49] understand
[1:00:50] it brother saw the vision on the same
[1:00:52] morning that they laid the cornerstone
[1:00:54] for the tabernacle
[1:00:55] apparently if i read this right so he's
[1:00:58] talking about the morning i laid the
[1:00:59] the cornerstone in this tabernacle i was
[1:01:02] thinking of this great time the lord was
[1:01:04] going to give me a tabernacle so can i
[1:01:05] just
[1:01:06] dramatize brother brandt was excited
[1:01:08] they're going to go lay the cornerstone
[1:01:10] oh it's the morning our church is going
[1:01:11] to be established and brother man
[1:01:12] thought
[1:01:13] now i've got a church i've got a
[1:01:15] tabernacle where i can preach
[1:01:19] and what the angels say the angel comes
[1:01:21] to correct him he said i was so happy
[1:01:23] standing behind the boat and saying
[1:01:24] god how good you are to give me a
[1:01:26] tabernacle and at that time the angel
[1:01:28] lord spoke to me and said but this
[1:01:29] is not your tabernacle
[1:01:33] see what they're still trying to do
[1:01:34] today they're trying to make it brother
[1:01:36] branham's tabernacle it was never his to
[1:01:38] begin with
[1:01:40] the angel said that and they say they
[1:01:42] believe every word he said
[1:01:44] i believe the angel praise god and
[1:01:45] brother branham praise god
[1:01:47] it was never his because he was he had a
[1:01:49] different ministry
[1:01:51] he had a prophetic ministry and he was
[1:01:53] going to do the work of an evangelist
[1:01:55] in other words he had multiple gifts he
[1:01:57] had to minister
[1:01:59] he was so excited oh i finally got a
[1:02:01] church i finally got a pulpit i finally
[1:02:03] got a place to preach and the angel said
[1:02:04] it's not your tabernacle
[1:02:09] and then he had this vision now in the
[1:02:11] vision it's a little a little long
[1:02:14] but let's just read it he's taking me up
[1:02:15] in the spirit set me in a grove so
[1:02:17] trees and way down the grove was two
[1:02:19] rows of trees just setting level
[1:02:21] about 20 feet 30 feet tall and they
[1:02:23] looked like fruit trees and were
[1:02:25] uh in great big green buckets i'm gonna
[1:02:28] skip down a little bit so i can see
[1:02:32] okay and then he says uh and i notice in
[1:02:35] my right hand to my left hand there was
[1:02:37] an empty bucket on either side and i
[1:02:38] said what about these
[1:02:40] and he said you're to plant them so i
[1:02:42] pulled a limb from the tree to my right
[1:02:44] and placed it in the bucket on the right
[1:02:46] side
[1:02:46] and a limb on the left hand and placed
[1:02:48] in the bucket on the left side quickly
[1:02:50] they growed all the way
[1:02:51] to the skies and he said hold out your
[1:02:53] hands and gather the fruit thereof
[1:02:55] so they grew up and he had to gather the
[1:02:57] fruit and in one hand fell a great
[1:03:00] yellow apple mellow and ripe and the
[1:03:02] other hand fell a great yellow plum
[1:03:03] mellow and ripe and he said eat the
[1:03:05] fruit thereof
[1:03:06] because it's pleasant and i ate from one
[1:03:09] from the other very delicious
[1:03:10] you know the vision it's wrote in one of
[1:03:12] the books i think life story prophet
[1:03:14] visit south africa and just then i held
[1:03:16] up my hands and was shouting the glory
[1:03:17] of god
[1:03:18] and all of a sudden that pillar of fire
[1:03:20] come down over the tops of the trees
[1:03:22] and the roar and the lightnings flash
[1:03:24] and the winds blew real hard
[1:03:25] and the leaves began to blow him from
[1:03:27] the trees and i looked way down
[1:03:29] here's to the shape of this tabernacle
[1:03:31] the way it sets now
[1:03:33] so this is i think 1962.
[1:03:36] and at the end where the pulpit would be
[1:03:39] there were those trees and those
[1:03:41] three trees taking the shape of three
[1:03:43] crosses
[1:03:44] i noticed both plums and apples were
[1:03:46] gathered in clusters around the middle
[1:03:47] cross
[1:03:48] and i ran real fast screaming to the top
[1:03:50] of my voice and fell down upon this
[1:03:52] cross or by the cross
[1:03:53] threw my arms around it amen and the
[1:03:56] winds began to shake and the fruit from
[1:03:58] the cross had fell all over me and i was
[1:04:00] so happy just rejoicing i said
[1:04:01] eat the fruit thereof because it's
[1:04:03] pleasant amen
[1:04:05] in other words we should rejoice in any
[1:04:07] soul saved praise god
[1:04:09] amen in fact the most people brother
[1:04:11] bang that have told me i've helped lead
[1:04:13] them to the lord they go back to
[1:04:14] denominations
[1:04:15] but according to this we should rejoice
[1:04:18] as long as they are real
[1:04:19] as long as they're a real fruit of god
[1:04:20] amen as long as they're saved we should
[1:04:23] rejoice
[1:04:24] in any fruit break hallelujah
[1:04:28] because he interprets it later it says
[1:04:30] these are oneness
[1:04:31] and trinitarian souls that are saved not
[1:04:34] at the tabernacle
[1:04:36] right they were outside in other
[1:04:38] denominations
[1:04:42] and then this circling of fire caught
[1:04:45] out the harvest is ripe and the laborers
[1:04:47] are few
[1:04:48] he said now when you come to yourself
[1:04:49] again read ii timothy 4. let's read that
[1:04:53] so after he sees the vision of the of
[1:04:55] the the the tree plants the trees they
[1:04:57] grow up
[1:04:58] he catches all the fruit then he goes to
[1:04:59] the cross and there's more fruit there
[1:05:00] from those
[1:05:01] those trees those souls and i charge you
[1:05:04] therefore before god
[1:05:05] the lord jesus christ who shall judge
[1:05:07] the quick and the dead as
[1:05:08] at his appearing in his kingdom preach
[1:05:11] the word
[1:05:12] be instant in season out of season
[1:05:14] reprove rebuke
[1:05:15] exhort with all long suffering and
[1:05:17] doctrine for the time will not
[1:05:19] will come when they will not endure
[1:05:21] sound doctrine no that's not like today
[1:05:24] they can't even do or endure a simple
[1:05:26] teaching
[1:05:27] right from scripture from doctrine but
[1:05:29] after their own lust shall they heat to
[1:05:31] themselves teachers
[1:05:32] having itching ears like one of these
[1:05:34] women after the debate she
[1:05:36] emailed me and said oh no it's okay for
[1:05:38] women to cut their hair because
[1:05:39] uh in the nazarite valley how do you
[1:05:41] remember the nazerite vow
[1:05:43] it gives a woman a right to cut her hair
[1:05:45] at the end of the nazerite vow
[1:05:47] i said that's true i said but show me
[1:05:49] one woman that ever did do the nazirite
[1:05:51] vow
[1:05:52] can you think of one i can't think of
[1:05:55] one woman with a nazrite vow
[1:05:57] that never ever cut the hair and i asked
[1:05:58] her this brother bang i said
[1:06:00] i said is that why you cut your hair at
[1:06:02] the end of a nazrite vow is that why all
[1:06:04] those
[1:06:04] millions of christian women who cut
[1:06:05] their hair is that why they cut their
[1:06:07] hair
[1:06:07] because god fulfilled the vow and now
[1:06:10] they're they're rejoiced because god
[1:06:11] answered their prayer
[1:06:13] and i didn't hear anything back because
[1:06:16] it's a lush it's a lush for the things
[1:06:18] of the world right
[1:06:19] they want teachers uh that will itch
[1:06:22] their own ears right
[1:06:23] that turn away from the truth and be
[1:06:26] turned into fables see they don't want
[1:06:27] to get in dedication to god
[1:06:29] they don't want to fast before god they
[1:06:31] don't want to make a promise to god
[1:06:33] they don't want to be honest with god
[1:06:35] they don't want to diligently serve god
[1:06:36] amen
[1:06:38] see when i brought it down to what the
[1:06:40] word says if you're in a deep dedication
[1:06:42] of a bow
[1:06:44] and they they did it then they could do
[1:06:46] it but we don't see any examples of that
[1:06:47] in scripture
[1:06:48] and brotherhood tells in the new
[1:06:49] testament he said it is a woman's
[1:06:51] nazarite vow to not cut their hair
[1:06:54] he said so we so the women keep the vow
[1:06:57] to keep a separation
[1:06:59] and show that they're under the full
[1:07:00] headship of husband
[1:07:02] and then christ and god amen
[1:07:05] so my man shows us the real spiritual
[1:07:07] meaning of it
[1:07:08] just as samson grew out of his hair he
[1:07:10] had the power that was the type of the
[1:07:12] church right
[1:07:12] to let the hair grow and just let it
[1:07:14] grow as long as they
[1:07:16] didn't cut off the things of god amen as
[1:07:19] long as they didn't cut off any of the
[1:07:20] word
[1:07:21] god's power would be with them praise
[1:07:22] god amen
[1:07:25] they shall turn away their ears from
[1:07:27] truth say they'll stop listening to the
[1:07:28] preaching
[1:07:29] and shall be turned to fables they'd
[1:07:31] rather believe a fairy tale about god
[1:07:33] but watch thou in all things endure
[1:07:35] afflictions do the work of an evangelist
[1:07:38] make full proof of thy ministry see
[1:07:40] that's what we're doing right now
[1:07:41] proving all things
[1:07:42] amen praise god now probably
[1:07:45] in 1963 standing in the gap he says all
[1:07:48] wrote in the books
[1:07:50] then years ago i seen i never crossed up
[1:07:51] the oneness in trinity
[1:07:54] i stood between them and planted these
[1:07:57] trees and they were the only two trees
[1:07:58] that had fruit
[1:08:01] all the trees grew up about 30 and
[1:08:02] stopped these went plum into heaven look
[1:08:04] at that they went into heaven
[1:08:05] the trees of truly oneness went into
[1:08:07] heaven broke off the same branch one on
[1:08:10] one side one or the other broke them
[1:08:11] you remember the vision it's wrong books
[1:08:13] and my life story and all
[1:08:14] and they went plum up to heaven quickly
[1:08:16] and he said hold out your hands for the
[1:08:18] fruit and then
[1:08:19] i found the same fruit in the cross when
[1:08:20] i run down there and he said do the work
[1:08:23] of an evangelist make full proof of your
[1:08:25] ministry and the time will come when
[1:08:27] they'll not ensure endure sound doctrine
[1:08:29] don't quit them then keep going
[1:08:35] so brother bram knew these people are
[1:08:37] not going to receive
[1:08:38] all that i'm preaching but some of them
[1:08:40] will be saved praise god
[1:08:42] there will be some genuine ones glory
[1:08:45] that recognize the healing ministry
[1:08:47] praise god they can rejoice in the
[1:08:49] healing ministry and maybe they'll get
[1:08:50] saved just because they recognize
[1:08:52] there's a gift of divine healing brother
[1:08:54] man said don't stop going to the god
[1:08:56] don't stop keep going to them just try
[1:08:58] to save them because there's wise and
[1:09:00] foolish
[1:09:01] go out and try to save the foolish as
[1:09:03] well
[1:09:05] that all come to my mind he said
[1:09:10] and so then brother rod brings up this
[1:09:12] quote uh i think i got it on here let me
[1:09:14] see
[1:09:15] so the brotherhood has a vision so this
[1:09:17] is what they're trying to do they're
[1:09:18] trying to say see brother man
[1:09:19] had a vision and trinity and oneness
[1:09:21] were saved but then here and what in
[1:09:23] anointed ones at the end time he says
[1:09:25] they're lost so the brother man
[1:09:26] contradicts himself
[1:09:28] and i said no i said you got to take the
[1:09:30] quotes back to the word of god
[1:09:32] i believe that vision was right brother
[1:09:33] fang you believe that
[1:09:36] i believe trinity how many eternity can
[1:09:38] be saved absolutely if not then luther
[1:09:40] wasn't saved
[1:09:42] i believe oneness can be saved how many
[1:09:43] believe oneness can be saved they got
[1:09:45] the wrong you know they make jesus
[1:09:47] his human body fully god that's not
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:50] you know god can't die god the holy
[1:09:51] spirit can't die
[1:09:53] and so i told brother ryan i said i said
[1:09:55] this anointed ones quote we're going to
[1:09:56] read here
[1:09:57] i said you've got to take this back to
[1:09:58] the word and brother man may mean
[1:10:01] something but it just doesn't come out
[1:10:02] the right way
[1:10:03] he may mean the truth but then it just
[1:10:05] doesn't come out and so
[1:10:06] it sounds wrong i don't know for sure i
[1:10:08] wasn't there
[1:10:09] i can't ask him about it the brother is
[1:10:11] talking about faith what is faith
[1:10:12] it's a revelation of the will of god
[1:10:14] churches today don't even believe in
[1:10:16] revelation he says i'm going to skip
[1:10:17] ahead because i think you understand the
[1:10:18] quotes
[1:10:20] and he talks to a preacher the preacher
[1:10:22] said we don't accept revelations he said
[1:10:24] then you have to refuse jesus christ for
[1:10:26] he is the revelation of god
[1:10:28] amen he said and unless you see it
[1:10:32] you're lost
[1:10:33] now that may be true for some people
[1:10:36] uh it depends what he means
[1:10:40] it's like a muslim if a muslim clearly
[1:10:42] says
[1:10:44] jesus is not uh the son of god and then
[1:10:47] they blaspheme every christian they're
[1:10:48] lost
[1:10:49] they didn't do any good to any christian
[1:10:51] there's no hope for them at all
[1:10:53] they'll be lost because they rejected
[1:10:54] that revelation and jesus said except
[1:10:56] you believe that i am he you die in your
[1:10:58] sins
[1:10:58] he's the revelation of god the spirit of
[1:11:00] god revealed in human form
[1:11:02] if you can't believe that you're lost
[1:11:05] you put him a third person second person
[1:11:06] or any other person besides god
[1:11:08] you're lost so see see how they can they
[1:11:10] can twist this and make it sound
[1:11:12] but that may not be what brother random
[1:11:14] meant
[1:11:17] okay so that he says except you believe
[1:11:19] that i'm he you'll die in your sins of
[1:11:20] revelation
[1:11:21] now remember the the writer of you know
[1:11:24] john
[1:11:24] in first john said anyone that says
[1:11:27] jesus did not come in the flesh is the
[1:11:28] antichrist
[1:11:30] right so we know it's an antichrist
[1:11:33] spirit that will deny that the son of
[1:11:35] god even came in the flesh oh god didn't
[1:11:36] come in the flesh
[1:11:37] but the holy spirit says yes god did
[1:11:40] come in the flesh
[1:11:41] the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:11:42] amongst us amen
[1:11:44] so that may be what brother is talking
[1:11:46] about people say well
[1:11:48] muslims say well jesus is just a man no
[1:11:50] he's more than a man
[1:11:52] his flesh was different it was the word
[1:11:54] made flesh it didn't have a sin nature
[1:11:56] praise god
[1:11:57] see that's what we believe so see
[1:12:00] they're trying to quote
[1:12:01] or place this quote against the vision
[1:12:03] and say they contradict
[1:12:04] well they might or they might not it
[1:12:06] depends what he means
[1:12:08] but i told him this i said okay i said
[1:12:11] brother i said i take that back to the
[1:12:12] scripture i said
[1:12:14] i used colossians 2 i said the godhead
[1:12:16] is a mystery
[1:12:17] the godhead is not the salvation
[1:12:18] doctrine
[1:12:20] praise god because if you do that then
[1:12:23] martin luther wasn't safe because he
[1:12:24] believed in three persons
[1:12:25] john wesley see what you get into see
[1:12:28] man you get pretty deep in smith
[1:12:29] wigglesworth raise the dead and yet he's
[1:12:31] going to hell because he's a trinitarian
[1:12:33] and god you know he's a servant of god
[1:12:34] and larkin larkin was a three-person
[1:12:37] uh teacher so there's there's so much to
[1:12:41] take into consideration
[1:12:43] but we cannot be afraid perfect love
[1:12:45] casts out all fear praise god
[1:12:48] if there's a question there must if
[1:12:50] there's if there's a lot of questions
[1:12:51] and it looks all foggy then it must be a
[1:12:53] revelation and it is
[1:12:55] it is and we've got the answer we got
[1:12:57] the revelation of the mystery of god
[1:13:00] amen it's one god in three
[1:13:02] manifestations
[1:13:05] all right let me keep going here i'm
[1:13:07] gonna do it on time
[1:13:08] pretty good okay my so my fourth
[1:13:11] question is you stated brother branham
[1:13:12] is a liar but i've never heard you share
[1:13:14] any real proof because i was trying to
[1:13:17] say you're only assuming and jumping to
[1:13:19] conclusions based upon your own opinions
[1:13:22] and so he said um
[1:13:25] so these are the examples he gave in
[1:13:28] 1953 brother braham said he went to
[1:13:29] confucius's grave muhammad's grave
[1:13:31] buddhist
[1:13:32] and he said he said that was a lie but
[1:13:34] he gave no proof there was absolutely no
[1:13:35] proof
[1:13:36] and that was my whole point what proof
[1:13:38] do you have he didn't show any
[1:13:40] there was none the vatican brothers he
[1:13:43] went to the vatican and saw vacaris
[1:13:45] filet day on a three
[1:13:46] a triple crown he said that's a lie i
[1:13:49] said well show me some proof he had no
[1:13:50] proof
[1:13:52] he said brother man told a story of
[1:13:54] eaglets on their mother eagle's wings
[1:13:56] and the eagle would take him up
[1:13:58] and brother the brother brother rod said
[1:14:00] that's scientifically impossible i said
[1:14:02] well there's no proof there's no proof
[1:14:06] and then he gave many more stories of
[1:14:07] brother branham and
[1:14:09] no proof that i saw now the donnie
[1:14:11] morton when i need to research that i
[1:14:13] haven't researched that
[1:14:14] brother ram apparently told donnie
[1:14:15] morton a young boy that he'd be healed
[1:14:17] and they say he died so i got to search
[1:14:19] that one out
[1:14:20] i will i just didn't have time to do
[1:14:21] that yesterday i'll do that by god's
[1:14:23] grace because some of these other ones i
[1:14:24] did search out
[1:14:26] okay so my response was i don't believe
[1:14:28] brother branham was a habitual liar
[1:14:30] he admitted when he lied to the irs he
[1:14:32] brother ham admitted he exaggerated
[1:14:34] sizes of crowds
[1:14:36] um and i said newspapers and government
[1:14:38] papers can be wrong
[1:14:40] like if you watch the pattern of the
[1:14:42] exodus they show how egypt has no record
[1:14:43] of moses but yet we know moses went to
[1:14:45] egypt
[1:14:46] and i said brother i have lots of
[1:14:48] questions but there's no way for me to
[1:14:49] know
[1:14:50] i said there are conspiracies how about
[1:14:52] jfk's assassination
[1:14:53] remember when trump said he was going to
[1:14:54] release those papers and he had to do a
[1:14:56] 180
[1:14:57] because the government wouldn't let him
[1:14:58] do it we still there's still no really
[1:15:01] no one really knows there are real
[1:15:04] conspiracies out there right
[1:15:06] there are and so you can't trust the
[1:15:08] government
[1:15:09] right they're not the absolute i said
[1:15:12] what about 9 11. i told you on wednesday
[1:15:14] i met
[1:15:14] brothers from yvonne karen church that
[1:15:16] were there when the towers fell
[1:15:18] and they say it wasn't the planes were
[1:15:20] real but they had explosions set up and
[1:15:22] you can hear it on the video
[1:15:23] they have explosions to bring that those
[1:15:25] buildings down
[1:15:26] that wasn't just a plane that was
[1:15:28] planned out but they
[1:15:29] they make it today like oh the plane
[1:15:31] took that those that was down
[1:15:33] what are you going to believe you
[1:15:35] believe cnn or can leave the people that
[1:15:36] were there
[1:15:38] you can't make newspapers and uh these
[1:15:41] things
[1:15:41] uh absolutes so i said ultimately it
[1:15:44] comes down it's your word
[1:15:45] against brother branham's word so he
[1:15:48] went on
[1:15:48] his second response he claimed brother
[1:15:51] branham
[1:15:52] pretended to speak in tongues that's not
[1:15:55] true i studied that one yesterday
[1:15:58] and then he says he says see this is
[1:16:00] proof jesse i said it's not proof
[1:16:02] because brother adam uh oh yeah here's
[1:16:03] the let me read the quote so here's the
[1:16:05] quote brother rams giving discernment in
[1:16:07] 1959
[1:16:09] and he said there's a little woman there
[1:16:10] suffering with high blood pressure she's
[1:16:12] not from here she's a finn
[1:16:13] she's from finland if you believe sister
[1:16:15] you receive your healing
[1:16:16] joomla raise up to your feet and accept
[1:16:19] your healing
[1:16:20] and be made well god bless you ketos
[1:16:22] jesus hallelujah what was i saying if
[1:16:24] thou can't believe
[1:16:25] so rod reads this and he says brother
[1:16:28] ram was pretending to speak in tongues
[1:16:30] when he said jumila ruma and kitos
[1:16:32] that's not what brother brown was doing
[1:16:33] brother ram had been to finland and he
[1:16:35] knew those words
[1:16:37] okay he was not claiming to speak in
[1:16:39] tongues he was emphasizing what was i
[1:16:41] saying
[1:16:41] if thou can't believe so so brother man
[1:16:44] was preaching on
[1:16:46] if thou can't believe so let me uh go
[1:16:48] ahead here again
[1:16:50] yeah here we go so earlier i'm just
[1:16:52] going to go quickly through here
[1:16:56] earlier in the quotes here bubblegum was
[1:16:59] preaching and they said if thou can't
[1:17:00] believe
[1:17:01] radio audience so he's trying to raise
[1:17:03] their faith this is what he's trying to
[1:17:05] get them to do he says it again if thou
[1:17:06] canst believe do you not know these
[1:17:08] people i've never seen them in my life
[1:17:09] what is it friends
[1:17:10] now don't go thinking something
[1:17:12] mysterious it's the promise of god jesus
[1:17:14] said
[1:17:15] so brother ahm was twice teaching on if
[1:17:17] thou can't believe
[1:17:18] he wasn't pretending to speak in tongues
[1:17:21] the next day brother adam tells a story
[1:17:23] about speaking to a woman who her
[1:17:24] brother branham in her own language
[1:17:27] as took place at pentecost so it wasn't
[1:17:30] the finished woman plus brother ram
[1:17:31] never told the finnish woman her name
[1:17:33] so brother rod reads this quote and
[1:17:36] brother rod thinks that brother brown
[1:17:38] was pretending to speak in tongues
[1:17:40] but she couldn't understand me because
[1:17:42] she was from another country a finished
[1:17:43] woman
[1:17:44] and then the holy spirit to show he's no
[1:17:46] respected person
[1:17:47] spoke through here called her name
[1:17:50] and told her to bless god spoke in a
[1:17:52] language i didn't know and called the
[1:17:54] woman
[1:17:54] give who she was something to the lord's
[1:17:56] blessing upon her in finnish language i
[1:17:58] don't even know
[1:17:59] english let alone finish so goes to show
[1:18:01] that god speaks in all the languages
[1:18:03] and all human beings belong to him
[1:18:07] now brother brahm later admits in when
[1:18:09] he was talking about this
[1:18:11] it wasn't exactly a finished woman so i
[1:18:14] can again see how the brother
[1:18:16] rod confuses these quotes
[1:18:19] brother man says how do we hear every
[1:18:21] man in our own tongue where we were born
[1:18:23] god is still god
[1:18:24] now when i begin to say those words
[1:18:25] within myself she didn't understand it
[1:18:27] at all
[1:18:28] the holy spirit speaking english was
[1:18:30] interpreting her to spanish
[1:18:32] so brother and says i'll be preaching
[1:18:34] right in english and they'll hear in
[1:18:36] spanish
[1:18:37] praise god you'll be talking in english
[1:18:41] and somebody can hear it in mong right
[1:18:42] or some other language
[1:18:43] that's what brother rahm's talking about
[1:18:46] now look what he says next
[1:18:50] and i just want to put it there in blue
[1:18:52] so you can see and if we could only
[1:18:53] grasp that this afternoon his goodness
[1:18:55] to that little woman
[1:18:56] finnish or whatever she was so brother
[1:18:59] rand mixes these women up
[1:19:02] okay earlier he said it was the finished
[1:19:05] woman that i spoke in another language
[1:19:06] to
[1:19:07] but then he said i'm not sure whoever
[1:19:09] she was
[1:19:11] he says now many times we see happen in
[1:19:13] the foreign countries i'll be standing
[1:19:15] speaking
[1:19:16] it'll turn right back around and use my
[1:19:17] language to call people in their names
[1:19:20] and everything just like it does here in
[1:19:21] their own native language that's what i
[1:19:23] call pentecost
[1:19:24] i believe it's the holy spirit all right
[1:19:28] so here's my conclusion again they
[1:19:30] jumped to conclusion
[1:19:32] brother ram never called the finished
[1:19:33] woman's name so it wasn't her story
[1:19:35] brother adam was referring to
[1:19:37] he just mixed them up because he said a
[1:19:38] finish or another woman
[1:19:41] there's three women he called their name
[1:19:43] in the prayer line and
[1:19:44] my opinion it was mrs allen so let me
[1:19:46] read that one just so you you got it but
[1:19:48] i don't know for sure
[1:19:51] he's discerning he says here look this
[1:19:52] way just a moment right over this
[1:19:54] direction i see a little woman
[1:19:55] i do not know her but she's praying
[1:19:57] she's wearing a little flat hat she's
[1:19:58] suffering
[1:19:59] over here over her stands that light
[1:20:02] she's suffering something's wrong with
[1:20:03] her eyes and ears
[1:20:04] i'm afraid the woman's not catching who
[1:20:06] i'm speaking of lord god
[1:20:08] say something or do something that she
[1:20:10] won't miss it her name is mrs allen all
[1:20:12] right
[1:20:12] do you believe that you'll be healed
[1:20:13] then rise and be made well in the name
[1:20:16] of the lord jesus now be thankful that's
[1:20:18] the way to do it
[1:20:20] okay so i believe this is the one
[1:20:21] brother i was referring to this is a
[1:20:23] woman
[1:20:23] she she couldn't hear for some reason uh
[1:20:26] but then brother
[1:20:27] he prays god do something that she won't
[1:20:28] miss it he calls her name
[1:20:31] and i believe this is the one where the
[1:20:33] woman uh brother man was
[1:20:35] speaking in english and she heard it in
[1:20:36] her native language
[1:20:38] okay i know that's a that's a deeper one
[1:20:41] here so let me move on here
[1:20:44] i just want you to see that look how
[1:20:45] close to this church look how close it
[1:20:47] is
[1:20:48] and it boils down to this if there's a
[1:20:51] question we got to keep reading
[1:20:54] and the church said if you have a
[1:20:56] question and you're not sure if there's
[1:20:58] a supposed contradiction
[1:20:59] keep reading but that's what people
[1:21:02] don't want to do
[1:21:02] right they don't want to keep studying
[1:21:05] they already got a predetermined idea
[1:21:06] right brother
[1:21:07] they're going to persecute brother
[1:21:08] branham and everybody the message so
[1:21:10] they stop
[1:21:10] reading they jump to a conclusion but if
[1:21:13] you keep reading brother graham said it
[1:21:14] could have been finished or it could
[1:21:15] have been another woman
[1:21:16] and brother i never said i was speaking
[1:21:18] and i was speaking an unknown tongue
[1:21:20] they have a uh article on their website
[1:21:22] that says brother rand pretends to speak
[1:21:24] in tongues nonsense
[1:21:25] nonsense if you keep reading right if
[1:21:28] you say in the message
[1:21:29] if you keep reading he says it wasn't
[1:21:31] that i was speaking in tongue
[1:21:33] he said i was speaking in english and
[1:21:34] the woman heard in her native language
[1:21:38] so it's totally wrong and if they would
[1:21:40] they would have got it right
[1:21:41] if they just keep reading so this is the
[1:21:44] next one i'm going to email the brother
[1:21:46] okay so then he can see it hopefully
[1:21:48] he'll repent of that one
[1:21:50] so my his last question to me uh
[1:21:53] i've experienced no love in message
[1:21:55] churches now let's let's take a little
[1:21:57] bit of uh
[1:21:59] let's take a little uh examination of
[1:22:00] our lives and make sure we love one
[1:22:02] another here
[1:22:04] and the people that have left us amen
[1:22:08] because if you really love them you'll
[1:22:10] try to go after them or at least pray
[1:22:12] for them
[1:22:13] you might not church let me say like you
[1:22:14] might not feel led to go after them
[1:22:16] because you might
[1:22:16] be a little anxious about them attacking
[1:22:18] you or
[1:22:20] but somebody should have the spirit of
[1:22:21] meekness to try to bring them back to
[1:22:23] god
[1:22:24] right and you should desire for the you
[1:22:27] should let me say like this you should
[1:22:28] desire the best for them
[1:22:30] no matter what they say no matter if
[1:22:32] they persecute you and call you out and
[1:22:33] make fun of you
[1:22:34] then you should still desire the best
[1:22:36] for them not hell
[1:22:38] right no not hell but heaven you should
[1:22:40] still desire
[1:22:41] heaven for them
[1:22:45] so this was his last question for me how
[1:22:47] can be the seven church age messenger if
[1:22:49] there's so much corrupt fruit
[1:22:50] among his followers so my reply and i
[1:22:54] just said i'm sorry if you haven't found
[1:22:56] love
[1:22:57] in the messed churches then those people
[1:22:59] haven't obeyed the bible but i said i
[1:23:01] wasn't there in your situation i can't
[1:23:02] speak for others
[1:23:03] i wasn't a witness of your problems and
[1:23:05] i said this i said i hope and i said i
[1:23:07] believe there's some people in that
[1:23:09] church that have divine love
[1:23:12] right there's got to be some
[1:23:15] but i use galatians 6 let's go to
[1:23:17] galatians 6 1 2 then you can read it
[1:23:18] and see it for yourself because church
[1:23:20] we never know if someone leaves us again
[1:23:22] or
[1:23:22] if someone comes in and leaves us we
[1:23:23] need to have divine love for them
[1:23:25] there's no excuses right you got to have
[1:23:28] divine love
[1:23:28] if you don't it shows you're not born
[1:23:30] again you can't even love your enemies
[1:23:32] that's exactly what jesus and stephen
[1:23:34] did
[1:23:34] that was the proof they had the love of
[1:23:36] god that they could love their enemies
[1:23:38] that was their dying wish
[1:23:39] right forgive them lay it not to their
[1:23:42] charge that was their dying wish
[1:23:43] and that was paul's desire in romans 10
[1:23:46] he said i wish that i could be cursed
[1:23:48] for my brethren's sake
[1:23:50] well look at that tonight can you
[1:23:51] imagine that wanting a curse on you
[1:23:53] so other people could go to heaven can
[1:23:54] you imagine it
[1:23:56] that's the kind of love paul had he
[1:23:57] couldn't do it but he said god if only
[1:23:59] if i could be cursed
[1:24:00] that these people could be saved i don't
[1:24:02] want to see them lost
[1:24:05] that's sincerity to me church that's
[1:24:07] really god's divine love
[1:24:11] galatians 6 1-2 now isn't this
[1:24:15] interesting church
[1:24:16] look at chapter five what's in there the
[1:24:18] fruit of the holy spirit
[1:24:20] paul's saying either walk in the flesh
[1:24:23] if you walk in the flesh you can do the
[1:24:24] things of the flesh right
[1:24:25] but if you walk in the spirit you'll do
[1:24:27] the fruits of the holy spirit
[1:24:30] and then he starts right after that he
[1:24:31] says brethren if a man be overtaking the
[1:24:34] fall
[1:24:34] ye which are spiritual see you got to be
[1:24:37] spiritual when you try to correct
[1:24:38] somebody
[1:24:40] restore such and one in the spirit of
[1:24:42] meekness considering thyself
[1:24:44] lest thou also be tempted so church it
[1:24:46] is
[1:24:47] bible command you need to be cautious
[1:24:49] when you try to correct somebody
[1:24:52] because that spirit might jump on you
[1:24:55] that's what happened with a lot of these
[1:24:56] message people uh sister naomi they
[1:24:58] rejoice oh we we brought hundreds of
[1:24:59] people out of the message
[1:25:01] now what's happened is these people that
[1:25:03] come to correct them that spirit
[1:25:05] that was on these people that have left
[1:25:07] it jumps on them
[1:25:08] and they see all the human mistakes of
[1:25:10] brotherhood what about all the right
[1:25:11] bible teachings
[1:25:13] what about all the healings and what
[1:25:14] what about all the good things
[1:25:16] don't look at the bad things what if
[1:25:18] somebody only looked at your bad things
[1:25:19] in your life what would you say oh
[1:25:20] you say oh please don't look at the look
[1:25:22] at the good things the bad things under
[1:25:24] the blood look at what god did that was
[1:25:26] good in my life
[1:25:28] nobody wants you to just look at their
[1:25:30] bad things
[1:25:34] see you got to be careful when you go to
[1:25:35] people you got to wait for the right
[1:25:37] time in the season because you might be
[1:25:40] tempted and
[1:25:41] uh tested as well verse two bury
[1:25:44] one another's burdens and so fulfill the
[1:25:46] law of christ
[1:25:48] so if someone's overtaken you have a
[1:25:50] burden to see them
[1:25:52] delivered right how many have a burden
[1:25:54] to see somebody delivered from their
[1:25:56] sins
[1:25:57] or anything that's the law of christ
[1:26:01] when you see somebody fall short you
[1:26:03] want to try to help them out
[1:26:05] now it's going to be their choice
[1:26:07] ultimately right brother man you can't
[1:26:08] how many people we wish we could force
[1:26:09] them to be delivered
[1:26:11] but if they love that spirit and worship
[1:26:13] that spirit they're not going to be
[1:26:14] delivered
[1:26:15] but you can try to bring correction to
[1:26:17] them if you got the love of god
[1:26:19] if you're walking the spirit and if
[1:26:20] you're called to do it
[1:26:23] but you have to be called to do it
[1:26:27] verse three for if a man thinks himself
[1:26:29] to be something when he's nothing
[1:26:31] he deceives himself so see if you're
[1:26:33] just going there i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:26:35] blast that person you're not even trying
[1:26:37] to help them
[1:26:38] like the man said people have to feel
[1:26:40] your love first
[1:26:42] before you can help them they have to
[1:26:44] know that you love them first
[1:26:51] verse 4 let every man prove his own work
[1:26:54] and then shall he have rejoicing
[1:26:56] in himself alone and not another see
[1:26:58] it's good to rejoice oh other people
[1:26:59] have good testimonies
[1:27:00] but see you need to be you and i need to
[1:27:02] be obedient so we can rejoice look what
[1:27:04] god has done in my life
[1:27:05] praise god and just rejoice and give god
[1:27:07] praise
[1:27:10] verse 5 for every man shall bear his own
[1:27:12] burden so see ultimately we have our
[1:27:14] burdens we must bear
[1:27:15] and if you're led by the holy spirit
[1:27:17] then you can go help somebody who's
[1:27:18] overtaken
[1:27:19] they're weak they've stumbled over the
[1:27:21] stumbling stones satan not a place
[1:27:23] they're
[1:27:23] stumbling with black whatever it is but
[1:27:25] you got to have compassion to bear their
[1:27:27] burden but don't forget you've got to
[1:27:28] bear your
[1:27:29] burdens too
[1:27:34] it's an absolute command for those who
[1:27:36] are spiritual but you got it
[1:27:38] it's got to be the right time in season
[1:27:39] two like remember brother randy remember
[1:27:42] randy bernstein he's coming here in a
[1:27:43] couple weeks praise god
[1:27:44] he was away from the message for four
[1:27:46] years wouldn't call me back i called him
[1:27:47] a couple of times
[1:27:49] and he was watching simon's facebook
[1:27:51] page right there was a time and season
[1:27:53] simon knew he was watching so he said we
[1:27:54] had all tremendous revival services and
[1:27:56] we did
[1:27:57] brother brooks and i preached those
[1:27:58] meetings cam cam church it was so
[1:28:00] powerful
[1:28:01] people got healed and delivered and
[1:28:02] everything and as soon as he posted it
[1:28:04] it's like he said it's like pentecost
[1:28:06] randy come back at the right time in
[1:28:08] season
[1:28:10] see so it's you gotta figure out how to
[1:28:12] deal with that you got to
[1:28:13] be led by the holy spirit in each case i
[1:28:16] tried to reach out i never got a call
[1:28:17] back that's okay
[1:28:18] keep trying keep trying go to them if
[1:28:21] you're if they're over and taken
[1:28:23] over taking a fall go to them and try to
[1:28:24] relieve their heavy burden
[1:28:28] now i said another reason people didn't
[1:28:30] go to your brother rod is because some
[1:28:31] of them are not born again i said few
[1:28:33] there be that find it
[1:28:34] this this clearly says only the
[1:28:36] spiritual can help those that are fallen
[1:28:39] the carnal believers cannot help them
[1:28:42] right carnal people that sin and message
[1:28:45] churches and aren't
[1:28:46] spiritual they can't help anybody
[1:28:49] because they can't even help themselves
[1:28:51] it's got to be somebody's spiritual
[1:28:53] society amen this is what you and i and
[1:28:55] your wife
[1:28:56] that's what we've been talking about
[1:28:57] when people
[1:28:59] fight against us it we have to be led by
[1:29:01] the holy spirit
[1:29:02] and it's got to be we have to be
[1:29:04] spiritual recognizing this is a battle
[1:29:06] not with them but with spiritual place
[1:29:08] or spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:29:11] and we got to be very cautious and we
[1:29:13] got to have love we got
[1:29:14] a desire to see them delivered we got to
[1:29:16] have love but we got to watch ourselves
[1:29:18] too that
[1:29:18] we don't go into it trying to fight
[1:29:22] but we go in at trying to take their
[1:29:24] burden off them
[1:29:26] lay this down lay this down and it's got
[1:29:29] to be at the time the right time in
[1:29:30] season
[1:29:34] but if people aren't born again they're
[1:29:35] not spiritual so they won't do any good
[1:29:37] if they try to help them out they'll
[1:29:38] just go
[1:29:39] attack them or join them right they'll
[1:29:40] either attack them or join them
[1:29:43] and i told by the right i said many are
[1:29:45] afraid rod and i said i was i admitted
[1:29:47] on the debate it's got over uh four
[1:29:49] thousand five thousand views now
[1:29:51] i'm probably exaggerating it's probably
[1:29:52] like 4 500. but i said i
[1:29:54] i was afraid to debate you because i
[1:29:56] never studied a lot of these questions
[1:29:57] i'm just being honest
[1:29:58] that's one thing church i want to be
[1:29:59] honest before god and man
[1:30:03] i want to be honest that's why i
[1:30:05] apologize at the beginning i'll just not
[1:30:06] i'm just being honest
[1:30:08] i never studied them i said i had to
[1:30:11] wait for the time and season i said
[1:30:13] brother rod some people have the right
[1:30:14] not to go to you
[1:30:15] because the bible said if if someone's
[1:30:17] causing division avoid them
[1:30:20] see you got some you got the right not
[1:30:22] to go to them
[1:30:23] but the people that are spiritual that
[1:30:25] means led by the holy spirit not
[1:30:26] everybody's led by the holy spirit to
[1:30:27] bring
[1:30:28] reconciliation many times it is the
[1:30:30] pastor's job many times
[1:30:32] then you go to them but i still think we
[1:30:34] should go to our brothers in love right
[1:30:36] because galatians 6.
[1:30:38] i said brother brandon's message has not
[1:30:39] failed miserably because i see it
[1:30:41] working
[1:30:42] in my life i see it working in those
[1:30:45] around me
[1:30:46] i said in all my mistakes i found
[1:30:48] restoration with people if they wanted
[1:30:50] it
[1:30:51] in other words i went and confessed my
[1:30:52] sin and they forgave me
[1:30:55] but i said brother also the prophecy
[1:30:58] says there will be little love in the
[1:30:59] end time because iniquity abound
[1:31:01] the love of many shall wax cold evil
[1:31:03] seducers will wax worse and worse
[1:31:05] because of rejecting love many message
[1:31:08] church members
[1:31:08] go into iniquity
[1:31:15] now here's his reply he said jim jones
[1:31:17] the guy that went to guyana and killed
[1:31:19] 900 people with the kool-aid
[1:31:21] he said he was under obama's brother
[1:31:22] man's ministry i said i don't know about
[1:31:24] that i never heard of that
[1:31:26] he said leo mercer he was one of the
[1:31:28] tape boys was indicted in california
[1:31:30] for child abuse i've heard of that i
[1:31:31] can't prove it
[1:31:33] um joseph coleman and lee vale brother
[1:31:35] ram ordained both of them i don't know
[1:31:36] if he was ordained he baptized the veil
[1:31:38] i know he ordained joseph coleman these
[1:31:40] guys went off into some really crazy
[1:31:41] stuff
[1:31:42] uh and really hurt a lot of people
[1:31:45] and so his question for me was he said
[1:31:47] jesse why didn't god give brother around
[1:31:49] discernment of all these people
[1:31:51] my response was that's between god and
[1:31:53] brother branham
[1:31:54] and i just had this thought yesterday i
[1:31:56] was suddenly as brother
[1:31:58] rod my precious brother rebukes brother
[1:32:00] branham for lack of discernment then why
[1:32:01] didn't he have discernment
[1:32:03] for 40 years if the message was wrong
[1:32:07] see and i say that love
[1:32:11] they're attacking somebody for not
[1:32:12] having total discernment do you and i
[1:32:14] have total discernment over every
[1:32:15] situation
[1:32:16] where we can judge everything right no
[1:32:19] we don't let's be let's be honest
[1:32:22] and i said at the last supper 11 saints
[1:32:25] couldn't even discern judas's spirit
[1:32:28] only jesus could and he was the son of
[1:32:32] perdition
[1:32:32] why because he was doing it in secret
[1:32:34] right he was doing his sin in secret
[1:32:36] they couldn't see it
[1:32:37] they couldn't see the the bitterness or
[1:32:39] the the greed in his heart for money
[1:32:41] they couldn't see
[1:32:42] they couldn't see his deal when he
[1:32:43] slipped off and went to the temple and
[1:32:44] said let's make this deal
[1:32:46] because it was in secret but he had a
[1:32:48] nice religious iniquity right
[1:32:50] a iniquity mask on
[1:32:54] masking his iniquity rather and i said
[1:32:57] this i said
[1:32:57] how do you know right i said was brother
[1:32:59] vail or mercer maybe they were living
[1:33:01] true why brother branham was alive
[1:33:03] and maybe they fell later that's a
[1:33:06] possibility
[1:33:08] but i said i said don't look at the bad
[1:33:11] fruit
[1:33:12] i said look at the good fruit praise god
[1:33:15] right you if you want you can look at
[1:33:18] judas and say my look at that bad fruit
[1:33:20] gee what was wrong with jesus's ministry
[1:33:22] nothing was wrong with it
[1:33:24] i'll say it like this to me there's
[1:33:26] nothing wrong with our ministry praise
[1:33:27] god
[1:33:28] there's nothing wrong with it it's right
[1:33:29] with the word praise god that's my
[1:33:30] opinion
[1:33:31] and there's bad fruit around it well i'm
[1:33:33] doing all i can to try to get people to
[1:33:35] be connected to christ
[1:33:36] so the fruit is good fruit praise god
[1:33:40] because a good tree can only produce
[1:33:41] good fruit praise god when they're
[1:33:43] attached to the vine
[1:33:44] the life of jesus christ
[1:33:50] and jesus said it i said it's going to
[1:33:51] be a little flock it's prophecy there's
[1:33:53] only going to be
[1:33:54] some good fruit there's not going to be
[1:33:56] a ton of good fruit
[1:33:58] there's only going to be a little bit of
[1:33:59] fruit
[1:34:02] okay i'm trying to finish up so my final
[1:34:06] question for him was are you willing to
[1:34:07] admit three prophecies were spoken
[1:34:08] before the fact that's
[1:34:09] that's his big thing there's no prophecy
[1:34:11] spoken before the fact
[1:34:12] and so i gave him three for my video but
[1:34:14] man saw the usa church vision that was
[1:34:16] foretold smoking dancing
[1:34:18] cut hair immoral clothes
[1:34:22] i said brother man said no greater
[1:34:23] ministry to the gentiles
[1:34:25] than brother braham's gift and
[1:34:27] denominations won't return to apostolic
[1:34:29] ministry so his answer was
[1:34:30] no he said that's my plain answer no
[1:34:32] those were not prophecies before the
[1:34:33] fact i disagree i believe they were
[1:34:36] and his his reason was the cdc says 67
[1:34:40] percent decline in smoking because my
[1:34:43] man talked about how the church would be
[1:34:44] smoking
[1:34:46] and he says see there's a decline in
[1:34:48] smoking the church is not a bunch of
[1:34:49] smokers but that's not what brother
[1:34:51] branham said
[1:34:52] well the ram never said the whole church
[1:34:53] would be smokers he just saw the church
[1:34:56] smoking dancing to rock and roll immoral
[1:34:58] he didn't say how many would be smokers
[1:35:01] and my opinion is they don't preach on
[1:35:03] it anymore
[1:35:04] how do you know because i went to a
[1:35:05] church where they didn't preach it
[1:35:06] anymore
[1:35:07] that's how i know they don't preach
[1:35:09] against it because they'll lose members
[1:35:11] right but aren't you glad you go to
[1:35:14] church where they preach and those evil
[1:35:15] spirits have to go
[1:35:17] amen i'm so thankful for that so we're
[1:35:19] going to say it by the samuels church by
[1:35:21] the brooks's church
[1:35:22] and now our church we preach and those
[1:35:24] spirits they're not allowed to stay here
[1:35:26] because they're cast out
[1:35:27] in jesus christ's name to those who
[1:35:30] believe
[1:35:32] now he said this and i used wendy as an
[1:35:34] example uh
[1:35:36] he said see that vision was wrong
[1:35:38] because he's brother said the asian
[1:35:39] church was a filthy church
[1:35:41] and he said see there's 266 million
[1:35:44] uh asian christians in 2015.
[1:35:48] and what did i say oh i said this i said
[1:35:51] i said overall the asian church is
[1:35:53] filthy i said i gave the hong kong
[1:35:55] example so wendy knows a lot of people
[1:35:56] that just they go to catholic church but
[1:35:58] they don't live it right sister
[1:36:00] yeah that's most people right that she
[1:36:02] knows that's just one little microcosm
[1:36:05] but if what the bible says is true
[1:36:06] there'll be very few that find it
[1:36:08] in asia right how many how many message
[1:36:11] churches in hong kong was there
[1:36:16] they're not even hong kong yeah that's
[1:36:19] two and how many millions of people in
[1:36:21] hong kong
[1:36:24] almost eight million there's two
[1:36:26] churches
[1:36:27] and there's some doctrinal questions we
[1:36:28] have about some of them i remember you
[1:36:30] said like with women and
[1:36:31] authority but god bless their hearts you
[1:36:34] know at least they're trying to serve
[1:36:34] the lord
[1:36:36] so i i just said i disagree brother most
[1:36:39] asians do not serve god well
[1:36:41] no 4.6 billion people in asia and he's
[1:36:44] saying 266
[1:36:45] or million are believers that's not even
[1:36:47] one percent
[1:36:50] so to me that vision is right if you
[1:36:52] have 300 million people
[1:36:53] and not even one percent are really
[1:36:57] believers
[1:36:58] then i think brother bran's vision is
[1:37:00] right he said the american church was
[1:37:02] filthy he said the asian church was
[1:37:03] filthy most denominational churches are
[1:37:06] filthy
[1:37:08] and then he said no greater ministry to
[1:37:11] the gentiles his argument was
[1:37:12] brother ram is fading away and he said
[1:37:15] historians say fewer people were healed
[1:37:16] and reported
[1:37:17] god has done much greater things in the
[1:37:19] church than brother banner's ministry my
[1:37:21] response
[1:37:24] was all asia rejected paul so he was
[1:37:27] looking at the number
[1:37:28] brother man's numbers are going down
[1:37:30] well that doesn't
[1:37:31] that's normal when you're a real prophet
[1:37:34] of god
[1:37:34] the whole world doesn't repent right the
[1:37:37] whole world rejects you
[1:37:38] yeah so i wasn't talking about the
[1:37:40] number brother bang i was talking about
[1:37:42] the greater gift brother said there'll
[1:37:43] never be a greater gift
[1:37:45] to the gentiles so he didn't you don't
[1:37:47] understand the quote
[1:37:50] and i said brother brown's gift is
[1:37:51] clearly unmatched there's nothing that
[1:37:53] even comes close
[1:37:55] right next i'm almost done here i
[1:37:58] appreciate everybody's patience
[1:38:00] i just want to finish this today by
[1:38:01] god's grace it's been a long hard battle
[1:38:03] a lot of questions but god's given me
[1:38:05] many answers i appreciate you
[1:38:07] having patience with me and i said
[1:38:09] brother i said denominations will never
[1:38:10] come back to the word his response was
[1:38:13] all churches say this there's no way to
[1:38:15] prove it one way or other so my response
[1:38:17] was
[1:38:19] i said brother the apostolic fathers
[1:38:20] never called god three persons
[1:38:22] they only baptized using the lord jesus
[1:38:24] christ formula it's clear to me this
[1:38:26] prophecy is being filled
[1:38:28] which denomination do you see coming
[1:38:30] back to the word of god
[1:38:31] you don't see it and the other thing was
[1:38:33] all their leaders are becoming
[1:38:34] homosexual
[1:38:35] and married two three times i said this
[1:38:38] ain't returning to the bible word of god
[1:38:40] it's falling away it's getting worse
[1:38:42] right we know that
[1:38:44] okay so his reply to me was jesse has to
[1:38:48] disprove everything they have about
[1:38:49] brother brand to prove he's a prophet
[1:38:51] he says i've not shown any real proof of
[1:38:53] prophecies made before the fact but i
[1:38:55] disagree i believe i have
[1:38:59] and then we close so i'll close this in
[1:39:01] my closing i thanked everybody
[1:39:03] i said brother brown wasn't a scholar
[1:39:04] it's hard to remember all those details
[1:39:06] of visions
[1:39:07] when you get a hundred letters a week a
[1:39:09] hundred phone calls a day
[1:39:10] right you and you have to do sick calls
[1:39:13] all day
[1:39:14] there's no way you can remember all
[1:39:15] those details and i looked at him
[1:39:17] brother i said
[1:39:18] my youtube channel is expression of my
[1:39:21] love to you
[1:39:22] i've spent at least a thousand hours on
[1:39:24] that channel at least
[1:39:26] and the whole reason by the bang was to
[1:39:27] give people overseas
[1:39:30] teaching that i can't go preaching them
[1:39:31] because i want to take care of my family
[1:39:33] that was one of the reasons to give my
[1:39:34] family a chance that won't come to
[1:39:36] church
[1:39:36] give them a chance to hear the message
[1:39:37] so if you feel led to share my videos
[1:39:39] with your family do it just do it that's
[1:39:40] why i made it
[1:39:41] if you feel led right if you feel led
[1:39:44] and the third one was
[1:39:46] believe the signs started theirs in 2012
[1:39:49] i started mine in 2013.
[1:39:52] because i thought if they're going to
[1:39:53] come against the message i'm going to
[1:39:54] show where the message is right
[1:39:56] so one of my first one of my first
[1:39:57] videos was women angels and women
[1:39:59] preachers because they said there's such
[1:40:00] a thing as women angels
[1:40:01] and i showed that to you a few weeks ago
[1:40:02] there ain't
[1:40:05] so i told him i said brother rod my
[1:40:06] youtube channel is an expression of my
[1:40:08] love to you
[1:40:09] i put a thousand hours in at least to
[1:40:12] show that i love him
[1:40:13] but what i really mean is i love the
[1:40:15] word of god and if i love the word of
[1:40:16] god then i love all my friends and my
[1:40:18] enemies
[1:40:20] i love jesus christ with all my heart
[1:40:22] and so at the end i cast my neck i said
[1:40:24] get saved repent you're filled with the
[1:40:26] holy ghost god will lead you to a
[1:40:27] message church
[1:40:28] then you'll uh faithfully gather more as
[1:40:30] you see that day approaching
[1:40:31] you'll pay your tithes you'll recognize
[1:40:33] your gifts you'll try to win souls
[1:40:35] you'll send missionaries
[1:40:36] and you'll love the lord your god with
[1:40:38] all your heart soul mind and strength
[1:40:39] amen
[1:40:40] amen and his last casting of his net was
[1:40:44] thanks to all he said go to my podcast
[1:40:46] fulfill this uh
[1:40:48] search the scriptures daily rather than
[1:40:49] be so go to my website that's fair
[1:40:51] that's what i did too i i gave my
[1:40:52] youtube channel that's fair
[1:40:54] he said examine all the evidence about
[1:40:55] brother brown that's what we do his
[1:40:57] conclusion brother braham is not a
[1:40:58] prophet
[1:40:59] his love compels him to go after message
[1:41:01] believers there's some true christians
[1:41:03] in the message he said some are not of
[1:41:05] course
[1:41:07] and then there's another oh then the
[1:41:09] host he's a message believer he said
[1:41:10] this is an important vital conversation
[1:41:13] either god sent a prophet or he didn't
[1:41:17] and he said hopefully we'll have more
[1:41:19] conversations i think the word of god
[1:41:20] proves clearly god had to send a prophet
[1:41:22] before the end time
[1:41:23] amen because of we needed restoration
[1:41:26] we needed our hearts turned back to the
[1:41:28] word of god
[1:41:30] i'm so glad my heart's been turned back
[1:41:32] to the apostolic fathers praise god
[1:41:34] amen and church as i said i'm happy to
[1:41:37] have more debates and more discussions
[1:41:38] hopefully i have more time to study for
[1:41:40] him too that'd be good
[1:41:41] i'd appreciate that and right before he
[1:41:43] closed that brother who left donnie
[1:41:45] reagan's church he stopped it it was
[1:41:46] such a sweet moment if you haven't watch
[1:41:48] it
[1:41:48] go to that mark it's so precious he said
[1:41:51] brother jesse i said i just want to tell
[1:41:52] you
[1:41:52] i admire you for your research he said i
[1:41:55] can feel your incredibly genuine faith
[1:41:57] and love of scripture and honesty i
[1:41:59] almost started crying because i thought
[1:42:01] wow
[1:42:01] my enemies are telling me they can feel
[1:42:03] my love for me or for them rather
[1:42:06] right they can feel my love for jesus
[1:42:08] his word
[1:42:09] and feel my love and so i said brothers
[1:42:11] i said i feel the same
[1:42:13] i said i love you with the love of jesus
[1:42:15] i said pray for me
[1:42:16] i'll pray for you because it's all about
[1:42:20] love that's what that's the only thing i
[1:42:21] can do to help people is to love them
[1:42:26] now here's a few follow up let's stay
[1:42:27] into our feet here look just one more
[1:42:29] that's the last one
[1:42:30] here's i wish i would have challenged a
[1:42:32] little more like this and maybe going
[1:42:34] forward we'll do this
[1:42:35] we'll see what the lord does i wish i
[1:42:38] would have challenged and said give me
[1:42:39] one scripture where god asked godly
[1:42:40] woman to cut her hair where god
[1:42:42] and she actually cut it because church
[1:42:45] what does it come down to
[1:42:46] we either got thus saith the lord or we
[1:42:48] don't like either god has
[1:42:50] god either has clear bible teachings or
[1:42:53] god contradicts himself i believe god
[1:42:56] is a god of no contradictions
[1:43:00] i wish i would have labored on uh we
[1:43:02] have five water baptism examples from
[1:43:04] acts can you show me one that was in the
[1:43:06] titles father son holy ghost
[1:43:08] i wish i want to challenge a little more
[1:43:09] on homosexuality this is a reprobate
[1:43:11] mind this is
[1:43:12] in other words this is insanity right
[1:43:15] homosexuality is
[1:43:16] literal mental insanity
[1:43:19] a reprobate mind god has given you up
[1:43:24] and said i'll give you over to believe a
[1:43:26] lie
[1:43:27] now of course people have been delivered
[1:43:28] out of that there's numerous people
[1:43:30] right brother that's with ryan maybe
[1:43:32] maybe he'll tell us about that when he
[1:43:33] comes i got to remind him
[1:43:36] and then i wish i would have challenged
[1:43:37] them on any other doctor musicians if
[1:43:39] you'll come
[1:43:40] by god's grace so i'm finished
[1:43:45] is everybody happy amen you're not half
[1:43:48] as happy as i am
[1:43:51] and i i don't know if you remember
[1:43:53] church but when i preached on the
[1:43:54] philippians series i got one more
[1:43:55] message on there
[1:43:57] the holy spirit struck me that day and
[1:44:00] paul said i was set
[1:44:01] as a defense for the gospel and i
[1:44:03] started preaching brother bang and i
[1:44:04] believe it
[1:44:05] i was born to defend the message that's
[1:44:07] my purpose in life
[1:44:09] to preach and as soon as i said that we
[1:44:11] started worshiping brother
[1:44:12] bang i got an email from their podcast
[1:44:15] saying we're coming back on
[1:44:16] we look forward to debating people and
[1:44:19] i'm here praising god and i look down
[1:44:21] and i get an email pop up oh they want
[1:44:23] to debate me now okay
[1:44:24] and i just preached that i was born
[1:44:27] to defend this message amen i've had
[1:44:30] numerous people say
[1:44:31] wow they were so amazed they thanked me
[1:44:34] there was the holy spirit that debated
[1:44:35] that man it was the holy spirit
[1:44:37] it was god's nature that debate of that
[1:44:39] person
[1:44:42] in church i hope now just like you i
[1:44:46] hope
[1:44:47] the seeds that i've sown have fallen
[1:44:49] onto good ground
[1:44:51] and i hope the holy spirit can start
[1:44:53] rooting up some of those weeds
[1:44:54] in these in these hearts of these men
[1:44:56] and women
[1:44:58] and they'll start saying oh this guy
[1:44:59] really has love
[1:45:01] this must be the word of god because
[1:45:03] they have love
[1:45:05] that is my desire church
[1:45:12] remember brother brown he was in at
[1:45:14] least three debates i don't know if you
[1:45:15] heard my message a few wednesdays nights
[1:45:17] ago by the bank
[1:45:18] he debated a person about tongues of the
[1:45:20] evidence
[1:45:22] second he debate debated a person on
[1:45:23] divine healing who said
[1:45:25] oh uh people can't be healed going to
[1:45:27] witch doctors and brother graham said
[1:45:28] they don't think it's a witch and they
[1:45:29] think it's god or them so they can be
[1:45:31] healed
[1:45:32] because god heals by faith that's
[1:45:36] that's really something i still can't
[1:45:39] understand it
[1:45:40] but i believe it and then brother said
[1:45:43] the holy spirit told me to go down
[1:45:45] it was him against 300 ministers in that
[1:45:47] cafe
[1:45:48] and he challenged him on water baptism
[1:45:50] and serpent seed
[1:45:51] and he said come to you he said one of
[1:45:53] you come stand before me and hold that
[1:45:54] bible
[1:45:55] and show me where i'm wrong he said as
[1:45:56] the quietest group you ever saw
[1:46:00] and then that was that was three that at
[1:46:02] least he participated in at least
[1:46:04] himself
[1:46:04] but then he went to support brother
[1:46:06] bosworth in 1950 at the houston coliseum
[1:46:08] and that's where the pillar fired jesus
[1:46:10] christ come down and took a picture with
[1:46:12] this prophet
[1:46:16] bless my heads for a moment here uh you
[1:46:18] know every time i say that
[1:46:20] i feel like i want the holy spirit to
[1:46:21] show me which thoughts from the message
[1:46:24] do you want me to remind the people
[1:46:26] though so we can
[1:46:27] pray about them how about divine love
[1:46:29] how about
[1:46:31] going to people that have i'll say like
[1:46:33] this ties in with tonight
[1:46:35] going to people that have hurt you face
[1:46:36] to face

[1:46:40] overtaken in a fault
[1:46:45] and maybe you felt like you should go
[1:46:47] talk to them
[1:46:48] maybe not
[1:46:51] that was the first thought that came to
[1:46:53] me when i said let's close jesus the
[1:46:54] holy spirit will many times bring things
[1:46:56] from the serpent
