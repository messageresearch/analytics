[5:25] man Ministry that God gave to William
[5:28] brandham now want to show the Bible
[5:30] teaching that proves God foretold and
[5:33] promised to send William bram's Ministry
[5:35] which was a prophet or son of man
[5:37] Ministry a Ministry Anointed with the
[5:39] spirit of Elijah for the last days to
[5:42] preach God's message of the hour before
[5:45] the second coming of Jesus
[5:47] Christ Bible teaching on the message and
[5:51] messenger recall from our message of the
[5:54] hour video that God has sent an end time
[5:56] message for our day which is restoration
[6:00] restoration of all things including
[6:03] hearts of obedience to the word and
[6:05] Bible
[6:06] truths
[6:08] Revelation revelation of the Bible
[6:10] Mysteries of
[6:11] God and Rapture the catching away a
[6:15] Rapture of the Holy Ghost filled New
[6:17] Testament Church before the tribulation
[6:20] period this message is straight out of
[6:22] the Bible and is the message that
[6:24] William brandham the messenger preached
[6:26] as we will show through this video
[6:28] series the first part of the message of
[6:31] the hour today is
[6:33] restoration acts 3:20 and 21 state that
[6:36] Jesus must remain in Heaven until the
[6:39] restitution or restoration of all things
[6:43] and he shall send Jesus Christ which
[6:46] before was preached unto you whom the
[6:48] Heaven Must receive until the times of
[6:50] restitution of all things which God has
[6:52] spoken by the mouth of all his holy
[6:54] prophets since the world began this
[6:57] promised restoration before Jesus would
[7:00] return was taught again in scripture
[7:02] This Time by Jesus himself in Matthew
[7:05] 17:11 Jesus gave us more detail about
[7:08] this restoration stating that God would
[7:10] send Elijah to restore all things
[7:13] Matthew 17:11 and Jesus answered and
[7:16] said unto them Elias truly shall first
[7:18] come and restore All
[7:21] Things by the direction of the Holy
[7:23] Spirit we find the spirit of Elijah
[7:25] mentioned again in Malachi 4: 5 and 6
[7:29] which states the spirit of Elijah would
[7:31] be upon a prophet and his ministry would
[7:34] turn the heart of the children to their
[7:36] fathers before judgment strikes the
[7:39] world the great and Dreadful day of the
[7:41] Lord behold I will send you Elijah the
[7:44] prophet before the coming of the great
[7:45] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[7:48] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[7:49] the children and the Heart of the
[7:51] children to their fathers lest I come
[7:53] and smite the Earth with a
[7:55] curse the phrase turn the heart refers
[7:58] to a heart that lovingly obeys the word
[8:01] of God as seen by Romans 6:17 and acts
[8:05] 7:39 these scriptures plainly teach that
[8:07] a heart turned to God is an obedient
[8:10] heart but God be thank that you were
[8:13] Servants of sin but have obeyed from the
[8:15] heart that form of Doctrine which was
[8:17] delivered you to whom our fathers would
[8:20] not obey but thrust him from them and in
[8:23] their hearts turned back again into
[8:26] Egypt so to summarize what we see the
[8:29] Bible teach so far is that Jesus will
[8:32] remain in heaven and not return to the
[8:34] Earth until all things including the
[8:36] hearts of Believers are restored to
[8:38] obedience by a prophet Anointed with the
[8:41] spirit of
[8:42] Elijah later in this video series we
[8:44] will give a more detailed teaching on
[8:46] Malachi 4:5 and
[8:48] 6 the second part of today's message is
[8:52] revelation it is through this revelation
[8:54] of the word of God that the restoration
[8:56] of the hearts literally takes place for
[8:59] a heart cannot be restored until the
[9:01] true word of God has been revealed to
[9:03] the believer the Bible promised a
[9:06] finished revelation of the mystery of
[9:08] God before the end of the world
[9:10] Revelation 10:7 but in the days of the
[9:13] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[9:14] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[9:17] be finished as he hath declared to his
[9:19] servants the
[9:20] prophets we know this seventh angel must
[9:23] be a prophet for Amos 3:7 teaches that
[9:26] God only reveals his Secrets or
[9:28] Mysteries through proph prophets as God
[9:30] has never commissioned angels to preach
[9:32] the gospel to all the nations but rather
[9:35] men surely the Lord God will do nothing
[9:38] but he revealed his secret unto his
[9:40] servants the prophets so this angel of
[9:43] Revelation 10:7 must be a prophet and
[9:46] must be a man this does not contradict
[9:48] the Bible for numerous times in the
[9:50] Bible humans are called angels and that
[9:53] is the case with Revelation 10:7 David
[9:56] was called an angel in 1st Samuel 29:9
[9:59] and 2 Samuel
[10:01] 19:27 St Paul said he was received as an
[10:04] angel in Galatians
[10:05] 4:14 and a prophet in Revelation 22: 8
[10:09] and9 was called an angel or messenger of
[10:12] God we believe this seventh angel is the
[10:15] same person and same ministry as the
[10:17] Elijah anointed Prophet spoken of
[10:20] earlier in the previous scriptures as
[10:22] the finishing of the mystery of God is
[10:24] surely part of the restoration of all
[10:26] things and could only be done by a
[10:28] prophet
[10:30] Revelation 10:7 said the mystery of God
[10:32] would be finished and we believe William
[10:34] brandham preached and revealed the 12
[10:36] Bible defin Mysteries to the people of
[10:39] God if the Lord is willing we will
[10:41] produce a separate video detailing these
[10:43] 12 Bible Mysteries which
[10:46] include the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus's
[10:49] seven parables in Matthew
[10:51] 13 godliness restored to
[10:54] man
[10:57] iniquity God in Christ or the
[11:01] godhead Israel's blindness to the
[11:03] Messiah during the church age or Gentile
[11:08] dispensation translation of the living
[11:10] Saints with resurrected Saints or the
[11:14] Rapture the New Testament Church
[11:16] composed of both Jew and Gentile
[11:20] Believers the New Testament Church as
[11:22] the bride of
[11:24] Christ Christ dwelling in The Believer
[11:27] or the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[11:31] the Seven
[11:33] Stars mystery
[11:35] Babylon the mystery of God's
[11:39] will there were also many Bible truths
[11:42] that needed restored by the ministry of
[11:44] William brandham which he Faithfully
[11:46] preached these restored truths
[11:49] included marriage and divorce water
[11:52] baptism in the literal name of the Lord
[11:54] Jesus
[11:55] Christ Long uncut hair for women and
[11:58] short hair for for
[12:00] men separate garments for men and women
[12:03] no
[12:04] crossdressing the rejection of
[12:07] worldliness such as rejecting makeup
[12:09] smoking drinking and immoral sexy
[12:13] clothing the seed of The Serpent and the
[12:15] original
[12:17] sin the evidence of the baptism of the
[12:19] Holy
[12:21] Ghost true teaching on
[12:24] Grace the three works of Grace and
[12:27] salvation justification sanctification
[12:30] and the baptism of the Holy
[12:32] Ghost no women angels and no women
[12:35] preachers in the
[12:37] Bible predestination election and free
[12:40] more agency just to name a few as we
[12:44] summarize again we see the bible teach
[12:46] through all these scriptures that Jesus
[12:49] will remain in heaven and not return to
[12:51] the Earth until all things including the
[12:53] hearts of the end time Believers or
[12:55] children are restored to obedience
[12:58] through the m iies of the Bible being
[13:00] revealed by a prophet Anointed with the
[13:03] spirit of
[13:05] Elijah the Rapture is the third and
[13:08] final part of the message of the
[13:10] hour once the hearts of every holy ghost
[13:13] filled Christian or bride member are
[13:15] restored through the revelation of God's
[13:17] word then the Rapture can take place if
[13:21] God is willing we will produce a video
[13:22] and teach about the revelations God has
[13:24] given to his people today regarding the
[13:28] rapture
