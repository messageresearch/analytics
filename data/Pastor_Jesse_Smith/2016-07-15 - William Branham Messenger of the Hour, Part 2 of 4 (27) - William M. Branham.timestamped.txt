[0:12] William brandham in Malachi 45 and
[0:15] 6 we mentioned moments ago that Malachi
[0:19] 4: 5 and 6 promised that a man who was a
[0:22] prophet Anointed with the spirit of
[0:24] Elijah was promised to come in the New
[0:26] Testament before the Judgment of the
[0:28] world Mal 46 actually contains a
[0:32] compound Prophecy with two separate
[0:34] Elijah Ministries sharing the same verse
[0:38] we believe this interpretation has to be
[0:40] correct for Bible readers will know that
[0:42] half of Malachi 4:6 was already
[0:45] fulfilled in the ministry of John the
[0:46] Baptist according to Luke 1:1 17 which
[0:50] helps unlock the spiritual understanding
[0:53] of this important end time
[0:55] prophecy Luke 1:17 and he shall go
[0:58] before him in the spirit and power of
[1:00] Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:03] to the children and the disobedient to
[1:05] the wisdom of the just to make ready a
[1:08] people prepared for the
[1:10] Lord according to Luke 1:1 17 John the
[1:14] Baptist was anointed with the spirit and
[1:17] power of Elijah and fulfilled the first
[1:19] half of Malachi 4:6 and he shall turn
[1:22] the heart of the fathers to the
[1:24] [Music]
[1:27] children thankfully the Holy Spirit in
[1:30] his word has interpreted John's Ministry
[1:32] for us he John the Baptist shall turn
[1:35] the heart through an obedient repentant
[1:38] heart for repentance was his message
[1:41] according to Mark
[1:42] 1:4 of the
[1:44] fathers those who first confess faith in
[1:47] the Messiah Jesus
[1:49] Christ to the children those who be the
[1:53] last to confess faith in Jesus Christ
[1:55] the Messiah at his return
[2:00] this was exactly what John the Baptist
[2:01] did his preaching of repentance with the
[2:04] spirit and power of Elijah prepared the
[2:06] hearts of the first generation of
[2:08] Believers in Jesus Christ to receive
[2:11] Christ as Messiah their Savior and then
[2:14] the hearts of those early Apostolic
[2:16] Believers were now burdened in their
[2:18] hearts to see the children or last
[2:20] generation of Believers except Jesus
[2:23] Christ as their
[2:24] Messiah early Apostles like St Paul and
[2:27] St Peter were deeply burdened for the
[2:30] return of Jesus Christ to the Earth as
[2:32] evidenced by numerous scriptures urging
[2:34] the Believers to be patient and Trust in
[2:37] Jesus's Second Coming the early apostles
[2:40] were burdened for the children those
[2:42] Believers that would come after them and
[2:44] see The Return of Jesus Christ to Earth
[2:48] as we then examine Malachi 4: 5 and 6
[2:51] again we can plainly see that only the
[2:53] first half of Malachi 4:6 was fulfilled
[2:56] in the ministry of John the Baptist and
[2:58] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[3:00] to the children taught specifically by
[3:02] Luke
[3:03] 1:17 then the second half of the verse
[3:06] in our humble opinion wasn't fulfilled
[3:08] until God sent the Elijah anointed
[3:11] Ministry of William brandham to this age
[3:14] we believe the ministry of William
[3:15] brandham was and is still turning the
[3:19] heart of the children to their fathers
[3:21] meaning that his bible-based preaching
[3:23] of repentance and obedience like John
[3:26] the Baptist would burden the hearts of
[3:28] the Endtime Christians to love serve and
[3:31] understand God just like the early
[3:33] Apostolic Believers or the book of Acts
[3:36] fathers of our faith we can clearly see
[3:39] how the compound prophecy of Malachi 4:5
[3:42] and6 fits into the bible promises for
[3:45] this time period the last
[3:48] days Jesus will remain in heaven and not
[3:51] return to the Earth until all things
[3:53] including the hearts of the end time
[3:54] Believers or children are restored to
[3:57] obedience through the mysteries of the
[3:59] Bible being revealed by a prophet
[4:01] Anointed with the spirit of
[4:03] [Music]
[4:05] Elijah the prophet or son of man
[4:07] Ministry of William
[4:09] brandham as we showed briefly at the
[4:11] start of this video we believe God gave
[4:13] William brandham a prophet Ministry
[4:15] which can also be called a son of man
[4:17] Ministry the Old Testament Prophet
[4:20] Ezekiel was called a son of man by God
[4:22] himself in Ezekiel 2:
[4:25] 1-6 in the New Testament Jesus is the
[4:28] son of man the greatest Prophet the god
[4:31] Prophet according to Matthew
[4:33] 16:13 Luke 11:30 1 John 41 and 2 Matthew
[4:38] 1:23 and 1 Timothy
[4:42] 3:16 every Prophet would then be
[4:44] considered a son of man but Jesus is the
[4:47] son of man the god
[4:49] propit at Jesus's first coming he showed
[4:52] the sign of the Messiah the discernment
[4:55] gift of knowing the thoughts secrets and
[4:57] intents of the Heart by vision to both
[5:00] the Jews and Samaritans in John 1
[5:04] 35-51 and John 4:
[5:08] 4-30 but there's no scripture that shows
[5:10] Jesus showing the sign of the Messiah to
[5:13] the Gentiles at his first coming and
[5:16] that is because Jesus was not sent to
[5:17] the Gentiles at his first coming for he
[5:20] came to his own Israel but his own
[5:23] received him not according to John chap
[5:26] 1 but God being just and fair was
[5:29] obligated to send this Prophet Ministry
[5:31] this sign of the Messiah to the Gentiles
[5:34] before the times of the Gentiles was
[5:36] finished or fulfilled according to Luke
[5:39] 21:4 or else he would have given the
[5:42] Jews and the Samaritans a greater
[5:44] visitation than the
[5:46] Gentiles thankfully for the Gentiles two
[5:49] scriptures teach that the son of man
[5:50] Ministry of Jesus would again be sent
[5:53] but this time to the Gentiles just
[5:56] before the day and hour of his second
[5:58] coming and the end of the the world as
[6:00] Jesus taught this himself in Matthew 24:
[6:03] 36 and 37 and Luke 17: 26 to
[6:08] 37 and as it was in the days of Noah so
[6:11] shall it also be in the days of the son
[6:13] of man likewise also as it was in the
[6:16] days of lot they did eat they drank they
[6:19] bought they sold they planted they
[6:20] builded even thus shall it be in the day
[6:23] when the son of man is
[6:26] revealed but of that day and hour
[6:28] knoweth no man no not the angels of
[6:30] heaven but my father only but as the
[6:33] days of Noah were so shall also the
[6:36] coming of the son of man
[6:38] be this is where the Supernatural and
[6:41] prophetic Ministry of William brandham
[6:42] comes in as our three short clips showed
[6:45] earlier the son of man Ministry of
[6:47] William brandham manifested the power
[6:50] and discernment of Jesus Christ never
[6:52] before seen in this day and age no
[6:55] Ministry in recent history has
[6:56] manifested the sign of the Messiah the
[6:59] discern of the thoughts secrets and
[7:00] intents of the Heart by Vision like the
[7:03] ministry that God gave to William
[7:06] brandham this proves to us that God sent
[7:10] the spirit of Jesus Christ the son of
[7:12] man to anoint the humble Ministry of
[7:14] William brandham a son of man in order
[7:17] to show the Gentiles the sign of the
[7:19] Messiah before the Great Tribulation
[7:22] period we believe God has proven that
[7:24] Luke 17:30 is fulfilled the son of man
[7:28] has been revealed Jesus's son of man
[7:30] Ministry has anointed a prophet William
[7:33] brandham in order to reveal himself and
[7:35] his soon
[7:37] appearing this sign of the Messiah
[7:39] Ministry Christ anointing William
[7:41] brandham was the last sign to the
[7:43] Gentiles before the Rapture and the
[7:45] destruction of this sodomite world just
[7:47] as in the days of Abraham according to
[7:49] Genesis chapters 18 and
[7:51] 19 God came in a flesh body to Abraham
[7:55] and discerned the thoughts of Sarah's
[7:57] heart as she stood behind him in the
[7:59] tent revealing her thoughts according to
[8:01] Genesis 18:
[8:04] 9-15 please know that our church did not
[8:07] dream up or fabricate this
[8:09] interpretation of the son of man
[8:11] Ministry but God came and spoke it to
[8:13] this generation with thus sayeth the
[8:16] Lord and remember Abraham and his group
[8:20] never received one more sign from God
[8:23] until the promised son arrived how many
[8:25] knows that's true that sign of
[8:27] discernment and the Royal Seed of
[8:28] Abraham
[8:30] let me hear you let me tell you thus
[8:32] sayith the Lord you're receiving your
[8:35] last
[8:36] time that's according to the scriptures
[8:40] and the revelation of God that's in my
[8:42] heart that speaks that this is the truth
[8:45] and I trust that you will believe it to
[8:47] be the
[8:48] truth what more do you want to see
[8:51] remember I tell you in the name of the
[8:54] Lord if you regard me to be his servant
[8:57] this is the last sign that the church
[8:59] will see according to the
[9:01] scripture that's the last thing that
[9:03] Abraham seen done before the promised
[9:06] son arrived and we are the Royal Seed of
[9:09] Abraham and Jesus Promised the Royal
[9:11] seed to see the same thing that Abraham
[9:14] seen just before the Gentile World
[9:17] burned let me ask you how are you ever
[9:21] going to you'll never receive another
[9:23] sign this
[9:26] is Lord
[9:30] what a prophet of God make a statement
[9:32] like that
[9:33] wasn't you're receiving your greatest
[9:36] time and your life time before the
[9:38] appearing of
[9:39] chist
[9:41] come remember let me tell you thus say
[9:46] the spirit of God that's on me this is
[9:50] the last sign to the Gentile Church
[9:53] before the
[9:54] Rapture thus sath the word of God thus
[10:00] sayith the holy spirit that speaks that
[10:02] knows the secret of the heart thus
[10:05] sayith the Lord you are receiving your
[10:09] last
[10:10] call just remember thus saith the Lord
[10:15] you will never in any or more Gentile
[10:19] Church age ever see any sign to succeed
[10:24] this go greater this is the last sign to
[10:27] the church
