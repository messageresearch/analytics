[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the lord jesus christ
[0:10] are new testament ministers or preachers
[0:13] required to marry virgins
[0:15] i believe the bible-based answer is no
[0:18] and this video will present six bible
[0:20] proofs for this understanding
[0:23] and friends i want to say i have no
[0:24] personal hidden agenda here my wife and
[0:27] i both met these purity requirements
[0:30] when we took our wedding vows on our
[0:31] wedding day
[0:33] also friends i preached a full sermon on
[0:35] this subject so i'll leave a link in the
[0:37] description if you'd like to listen to
[0:39] the sermon it's about one hour long
[0:43] let's begin with an introduction
[0:46] this introduction may be helpful for
[0:48] viewers who may have not heard this
[0:50] subject addressed before
[0:53] some message churches or churches who
[0:55] follow the bible-based teachings of
[0:57] god's prophet
[0:58] brother william branham teach that
[1:00] ministers must marry virgins
[1:02] according to one
[1:04] and only one sermon the marriage and
[1:06] divorce sermon from february 1965
[1:10] while i respect both sides on this
[1:12] position
[1:13] scripturally i cannot see how the new
[1:14] testament requires ministers to meet
[1:17] this requirement
[1:19] i believe this statement by brother
[1:20] branham was his opinion as he never
[1:22] preached this teaching before or after
[1:25] february 1965.
[1:27] this is not a major doctrine in my
[1:29] opinion such as with salvation or the
[1:31] baptism of the holy ghost i believe it's
[1:33] a minor and as always i'm open to being
[1:36] corrected
[1:37] see divine healing is a minor you can
[1:39] never major with a minor see
[1:42] salvation is the main thing to the soul
[1:44] divine healing is just a minor thing
[1:49] he's a great man
[1:50] but he he just can't agree with me i
[1:53] appreciate that
[1:54] if there's sincerity though you don't
[1:56] just want these push over just have to
[1:57] grieve everything you say he's got his
[1:59] own convictions
[2:01] and he stands for i appreciate that and
[2:04] he's a good man of oh i am not a teacher
[2:08] a scholar at all but this man's full
[2:10] teacher and scholar but i i can't agree
[2:13] with him because i don't see him
[2:15] but it doesn't pertain to salvation it's
[2:18] pertaining to the coming of the lord
[2:22] before we listen to this quote from the
[2:24] marriage and divorce sermon consider how
[2:26] brother branham plainly taught that not
[2:27] every opinion of his was correct as he
[2:30] taught every teaching had to be proved
[2:32] true from genesis to revelation
[2:38] because that priesthood ended
[2:41] but god's urem today is god's word
[2:46] the word is his urine thunder
[2:49] war unto him that will add or take away
[2:52] anything from this bill
[2:55] this is god's eternal truth
[2:58] and in the day where there's people
[3:00] saying
[3:01] oh we don't need the bible it's been
[3:04] translated 15 times or more how do we
[3:07] know it's right so the heavens and earth
[3:10] passed away god's word will never pass
[3:12] away
[3:13] every doctrine and everything else of
[3:16] the bible that we have in the church
[3:18] must be based upon the word of god
[3:22] must come from the word
[3:24] not just one place
[3:27] but from genesis to revelation we have
[3:30] to say the same thing
[3:33] because we cannot base our thoughts upon
[3:36] one little scripture
[3:39] all the bible said in the mouth of two
[3:41] or three witnesses let every word be
[3:43] established
[3:46] and we have numerous examples of brother
[3:48] branham's doctrines and opinions
[3:50] changing over the course of his ministry
[3:53] such as these eight examples
[3:55] i'll start with four doctrines
[3:57] first the godhead doctrine brother
[3:59] branham believed in three persons in the
[4:01] godhead for many years but later changed
[4:03] to believing in only one person the
[4:05] godhead
[4:06] truly we're not much in this world we're
[4:09] looked down upon
[4:11] but god we believe we're accepted in
[4:13] christ jesus and he in return has given
[4:15] us the holy ghost
[4:17] we love him
[4:19] that great third person of the trinity
[4:21] who burns through our hearts
[4:23] and we love him
[4:28] is of the devil
[4:30] i say that just say it the law
[4:33] [Applause]
[4:35] the court come from
[4:38] it come from the nicene council
[4:42] when the catholic church become in
[4:43] rulership
[4:45] the word trinity is not even mentioned
[4:47] in the entire book of the bible
[4:52] and four is three gods
[4:54] that's from hell there's one god
[4:58] in my hand
[5:00] second regarding the baptism of the holy
[5:02] ghost at first he believed the baptism
[5:05] and filling were two separate events but
[5:07] later
[5:09] after the seals were opened he believed
[5:11] it was the one and self-same event
[5:14] i never thought there's a person believe
[5:15] that like me until this morning i heard
[5:17] charles fuller as it's going down he
[5:19] believes too that the new birth is not
[5:21] the baptism the holy ghost the new birth
[5:23] is being born holy ghost is a baptism
[5:26] and
[5:27] all right
[5:30] when god has given you the true baptism
[5:33] of the holy spirit
[5:34] then the life of jesus christ is within
[5:37] you now that's true every theologian i
[5:39] have to admit that to be history it's a
[5:40] new birth
[5:41] you're born in you of the holy ghost
[5:45] in other words to be born of the spirit
[5:47] is to be truly baptized with the holy
[5:49] ghost
[5:50] it is one and the same
[5:53] what is the baptism with the holy ghost
[5:56] it is the spirit baptizing you into the
[5:58] body of christ it is the new birth
[6:01] a third doctrine was man's three parts
[6:04] at first brother branham believed the
[6:06] human spirit or mind was the innermost
[6:08] part of man's being but later he
[6:10] believed it was the soul
[6:13] inside of the body is the soul
[6:15] and that soul is controlled by
[6:18] imaginations conscience memory reasons
[6:22] and affections
[6:23] that's the thing that controls the soul
[6:26] but the spirit is only has one sense
[6:32] the
[6:32] spirit oh
[6:35] let's get it
[6:36] the spirit has one sense
[6:39] that senses
[6:41] either dominates it is faith or doubt
[6:47] look here you are a outside person you
[6:50] have five senses that contacts that
[6:52] outside body god gave you five senses
[6:54] not to contact him your earthly home see
[6:56] speed or smelling here then you have a
[6:58] spirit on the inside of that and it has
[7:00] five outlets conscience love and so
[7:02] forth five outlets that you contact the
[7:05] spirit world with that
[7:07] but with your spirit
[7:09] your physical contacts are physical your
[7:11] spiritual context is spiritual but
[7:13] inside of that you've got a soul
[7:17] that soul is that gene
[7:21] a fourth doctrine was on the first seal
[7:24] at first brother branham believed it was
[7:25] the holy spirit
[7:27] but later preached it was the antichrist
[7:29] spirit with thus saith the lord
[7:32] the sixth chapter deals with the with
[7:34] the white horse which was the holy
[7:36] spirit went forth conquering the
[7:38] conqueror then come the pale horse
[7:41] death and hell followed it and each one
[7:44] of those riders on the horses now after
[7:47] these things after this great
[7:49] destruction first frank forces the holy
[7:51] ghost across the earth conquering and to
[7:54] conquer then come the one in the great
[7:56] famine time measure wheat fruit paint
[7:58] two measures of barley for a penny and
[8:00] um
[8:01] so forth but don't put my oil in wine
[8:04] and then on down to the open these these
[8:06] seals
[8:09] oh is that white horse rider you're not
[8:11] blind
[8:12] you see who it is
[8:13] that antichrist and that deceitful
[8:16] spirit has gone now and crept in
[8:21] now the vision plus the word plus the
[8:25] history plus the church ages and all
[8:27] blend together so i could
[8:30] truly say
[8:31] that to the best of my understanding and
[8:34] according to the word of god and the
[8:36] vision and the revelation
[8:38] the interpretation thereof is thus saith
[8:41] the law
[8:43] for opinions that seem to be human
[8:45] opinions only were
[8:47] first in 1951 brother branham believed
[8:49] billy paul was his promised joseph
[8:52] and that sarah was the baby he thought
[8:54] would be the promise joseph and of
[8:55] course we know later he had a son named
[8:58] joseph
[9:00] my little boy which is with us now
[9:03] soon be 16 years old
[9:05] even
[9:06] he seemed to be a good boy he reminded
[9:09] me him as very lovely little fellow
[9:12] but i talked to him about being baptized
[9:14] and making his public confession of
[9:16] christ
[9:17] he lived good and everything little
[9:18] fella but about a week after that i
[9:21] walked into the house
[9:23] and you come without me asking me
[9:24] anything said daddy i want to be a
[9:27] christian i want to serve the lord my
[9:29] joseph was right with me
[9:31] i didn't know it
[9:32] a little baby that i thought would be
[9:34] joseph a little girl and i called her
[9:36] sarah
[9:40] i'm thankful for her
[9:42] i love her with all my heart
[9:45] i had a boy and a girl in which way it
[9:47] went would be all right
[9:56] and i believe that god is calling my
[9:58] little boy back there who would be a
[10:00] minister of the gospel
[10:05] seeing the wisdom of god
[10:07] now i more understand
[10:10] if you ask god god will give you the
[10:12] desire of your heart
[10:14] i don't believe if the little baby would
[10:16] have been born to come up to the age to
[10:19] be a minister jesus will be here before
[10:21] that time i believe and god just hold it
[10:24] over on my little boy back there
[10:27] a second opinion is that brother brandon
[10:29] believed the usa would be totally
[10:30] annihilated before 1977 with only tree
[10:34] stumps remaining and we know this
[10:36] prediction didn't come to pass and it
[10:38] wasn't spoken with thus saith the lord
[10:40] and it'll a great woman will rise up and
[10:42] be president or something like that in
[10:44] the nation and then there will come a
[10:46] total annihilation the entire nation
[10:48] will be wiped out and that i predict now
[10:52] this is not the lord saying this the
[10:54] other about the woman in his is the lord
[10:56] but i predicted in 19 and
[10:59] 30
[11:00] 33
[11:02] that the world would be total
[11:03] annihilation before 77.
[11:06] so i didn't know then if they had
[11:08] something that could annihilate it like
[11:10] they got now but i seen the nation and
[11:13] total annihilation just stumps and trees
[11:16] and things like that
[11:17] so it's on its road
[11:21] third brother branham believed we could
[11:23] not have another generation after his
[11:25] generation because of mental retardation
[11:28] increasing among school children in
[11:30] arizona and of course we've had another
[11:32] 40-year generation so we see how this
[11:34] was his opinion
[11:36] look at this teenage
[11:38] insane well we haven't i told you the
[11:41] other day they've taken analysis there
[11:43] of the schools in arizona where i live
[11:45] and eighty percent of those children in
[11:48] school is mentally
[11:52] what will their children be
[11:54] we
[12:00] and a fourth opinion was brother branham
[12:02] believed martin luther king jr would
[12:04] lead millions into a death trap
[12:06] into a revolutionary war type of battle
[12:09] over school segregation in the south but
[12:12] he said i could be altogether wrong in
[12:14] my thought about martin luther king and
[12:16] of course there was no death trap where
[12:18] millions died in the south during martin
[12:20] luther king jr's lifetime
[12:22] one thing i that brother martin luther
[12:24] king
[12:25] will certainly soon wake up
[12:28] he loves his people there's no doubt but
[12:30] if you just only see where his
[12:31] inspiration what good would it do if you
[12:33] went to school in a million of you
[12:34] laying the other dead
[12:36] wouldn't just be going to school just
[12:37] the same not for for hunger if it was
[12:39] for something other slaves a man to be a
[12:42] martyr to give his life for such a cause
[12:44] a worthy cause and that would be a
[12:46] worthy cause but just to go to school
[12:48] and i i don't see it
[12:51] i don't think the holy spirit's agreeing
[12:52] with him at all on that it's got the
[12:54] people all worked up in a bunch of
[12:55] valley who you see just just like hitler
[12:57] did over in germany
[12:59] led him right into a death trap and
[13:01] precious germans and they're laid by the
[13:03] billions
[13:04] or millions piled up on top one another
[13:06] that's exactly the same thing and
[13:08] remember i'm on tape
[13:10] you see that maybe after i'm gone that's
[13:12] exactly what's going to happen now
[13:14] precious people die down there like
[13:16] flies starts a revolutionary both white
[13:18] and colored will fight again and die
[13:20] like flies and walk y'all it's all over
[13:22] a bunch of dead people
[13:26] did you prophesy that there be a million
[13:29] negroes uh killed
[13:34] did you just announce
[13:36] that there would be this happening now
[13:42] see
[13:42] i've always asked you to be careful what
[13:45] you're listening to
[13:48] there's so much of it that it's just the
[13:50] human side
[13:52] but always if there is something that
[13:54] goes forth it will speak it it's thus
[13:58] saith the law
[13:59] even divisions or anything
[14:03] no
[14:04] i just was talking about martin luther
[14:07] king
[14:08] on this great
[14:10] disaster that they're having in the
[14:11] south with the the colored people
[14:15] and that's reason i see that not that
[14:17] there is any uh any prophecy concerning
[14:20] it i have nothing on it from the lord
[14:22] and be sure now if i say anything from
[14:25] the lord like that to tell you it's
[14:27] always i'm speaking now but when he
[14:30] speaks i say it's not me it's thus saith
[14:32] the lord and i can't say it until he
[14:34] tells me i could be altogether wrong in
[14:37] my thought about martin luther king
[14:39] i don't know i can't say that's just my
[14:42] opinion
[14:44] now with this understanding of how
[14:45] brother branham's doctrines and opinions
[14:47] could change let's listen to brother
[14:49] ram's quote about marriage requirements
[14:51] for ministers
[14:53] in marriage and divorce 1965.
[14:55] now
[14:57] let us in view of these vindicated
[15:00] truths of god search a little further if
[15:02] you want to
[15:04] all right
[15:06] now this may hurt just a little bit till
[15:07] we get down to the bottom of it let me
[15:09] just go to show you the truth of it
[15:11] there is no minister that can marry a
[15:14] widow
[15:16] do you know that
[15:17] you want to read that
[15:19] all right you get leviticus leviticus
[15:22] 21 7 and ezekiel 44 22.
[15:28] and they'll show you that the priesthood
[15:31] was not to marry a woman has been
[15:33] touched by man
[15:35] this type is of the virgin bride of
[15:38] jesus christ because they handled the
[15:40] fire of god the priesthood aaron's sons
[15:44] we haven't got time to read it all and
[15:45] get out the noon we got 20 minutes yet
[15:47] and that was aaron's sons that handled
[15:49] the the fire of god so they could not
[15:52] marry a woman that had been touched by
[15:54] another man
[15:56] the unchanging god said soul
[15:58] they could not marry another woman at a
[16:01] woman being touched by a man
[16:02] showing in type here if you want to see
[16:04] it
[16:05] that's the church of the living god is
[16:08] purely unadulterated the word of god
[16:11] and now the denomination
[16:13] has been handled by man
[16:16] solomon can marry any woman that wasn't
[16:18] married
[16:19] he could marry any woman he wanted to a
[16:21] priest could marry only a woman that was
[16:23] a virgin solomon like david he married
[16:26] what was her name abigail which is a man
[16:28] called a fool he had a nice wife and he
[16:31] died
[16:33] and abigail was married to david he was
[16:36] a king not a priest
[16:37] thing
[16:38] so he he married but a priest could not
[16:40] do that because it touched a god a woman
[16:43] of his wife that was already been some
[16:45] man's wife so that shows the urgency of
[16:47] the church of the lord jesus christ of
[16:50] bridal had to be unadulterated the word
[16:52] not one word missing nowhere
[16:55] certainly
[16:56] could you imagine a correct bride one
[16:58] breast all from the other
[17:00] something another wrong you know that's
[17:02] not going to be the bride of christ
[17:03] she's perfect
[17:05] she's everything the word not one word
[17:07] failing anywhere
[17:08] no
[17:11] one reason some message believers cling
[17:13] to this quote is because they know the
[17:15] quote at the end of the sermon for
[17:16] brother branham in which he says the
[17:18] sermon was thus saith the lord all the
[17:20] way through
[17:21] but we have to understand this statement
[17:23] carefully to mean only the revelations
[17:25] in the sermon where thus saith the lord
[17:27] let's listen to this quote
[17:30] oh are you happy
[17:33] i told you the truth thus saith the lord
[17:36] all the way through
[17:37] now let us stand and raise our hands as
[17:39] we sing it again i love him i love him
[17:42] for his grace i love him for his mercy i
[17:45] love him for his word and the word of
[17:47] the lord came to the prophets
[17:49] [Music]
[17:52] friends be careful not to misinterpret
[17:54] this thus saith the lord's statement not
[17:56] every word in the marriage divorce
[17:58] sermon was from god and here's one clear
[18:00] example regarding jacob in which brother
[18:02] branham said he had at least a dozen
[18:04] wives
[18:05] but according to genesis jacob had only
[18:07] four wives and he promised his
[18:09] father-in-law he would not take other
[18:11] wives let's listen to this jacob quote
[18:13] and reference the scriptures
[18:16] look at jacob out of whom come the
[18:18] patriarchs
[18:21] he had at least a dozen wives
[18:25] he married two sisters and had concubine
[18:28] wives besides that common-law women that
[18:31] he lived with and those patriarchs was
[18:33] born right out of those concubine women
[18:39] is that right
[18:41] see you have to make the word run smooth
[18:43] oh i got pages on them
[18:45] if a clergyman ever questions me on it
[18:48] and then we get together we can talk
[18:50] but surely if he's got any spirituality
[18:52] at all he can see right here it's the
[18:54] truth
[18:55] there's no question to him
[18:58] friends in genesis 31 verses 47 through
[19:01] 55 laban makes jacob swear he won't take
[19:04] any more wives than the four he already
[19:06] had
[19:07] in genesis 32 verse 22 and chapter 35
[19:11] verses 23-26
[19:13] and chapter 46 verses 5-27
[19:17] these verses seem to show jacob's twelve
[19:19] sons by these four wives and we can't
[19:21] find jacob having a dozen or more wives
[19:24] anywhere else in scripture
[19:26] new testament minister requirements
[19:30] here are 20 requirements for new
[19:31] testament ministers and there could be
[19:34] more
[19:35] please notice only two pertain to his
[19:37] marriage
[19:38] which include one having one wife first
[19:41] timothy three verse two and two his wife
[19:44] being a christian in subjection to the
[19:46] word of god and her husband's rule in
[19:49] their household according to first
[19:50] timothy 3 verses 4 and 5.
[19:54] as a new testament author paul was never
[19:56] led to the holy ghost to write a merry
[19:59] virgins only requirement for new
[20:02] testament ministers from leviticus
[20:04] chapter 21. perhaps paul wasn't led to
[20:07] do this because paul's own i blemish
[20:09] according to galatians 4 verses 13
[20:12] through 15 would have disqualified him
[20:14] from being a new testament minister
[20:16] according to leviticus 21 20. let's look
[20:19] at the full list of 20 new testament
[20:22] minister requirements
[20:24] first in 1st timothy 3 verses 1 through
[20:27] 7 there are 15 requirements for a pastor
[20:29] or minister and i found five other
[20:32] requirements as well so number 16 is the
[20:35] minister must be born again or have a
[20:37] burning bush experience
[20:40] a 17th one is the minister must be
[20:42] called by god to be a minister the 18th
[20:45] 19th and 20th requirements are from the
[20:47] church age book where brother branham
[20:49] says
[20:50] all ministers must strive to have the
[20:52] same requirements as saint paul
[20:54] which the 18th would be the power of the
[20:56] spoken and written word
[20:58] the 19th would be fruit of the ministry
[21:00] and the 20th would be being completely
[21:02] true to the word of god
[21:05] six reasons why i believe ministers are
[21:07] not required to marry virgins in the new
[21:10] testament
[21:11] reason number one this teaching is based
[21:13] upon one sermon only friends if you add
[21:16] up the total amount of time brother
[21:17] branham talked about this doctrine it
[21:19] was a total of two minutes and 14
[21:22] seconds if my calculations are correct
[21:24] so this idea about new testament
[21:26] ministers and the marriage requirement
[21:28] is not expounded upon at all either
[21:30] before this sermon or after this sermon
[21:33] i cannot find one additional quote from
[21:35] brother branham before or after this
[21:37] sermon that support this teaching
[21:39] friends consider that the bible says in
[21:41] the mouth of two or three witnesses
[21:43] every word should be established
[21:45] so only have one witness of this
[21:47] teaching and it's in one sermon so i do
[21:50] not believe this teaching meets the
[21:52] requirements the bible establishes for
[21:54] doctrine
[21:55] brother branham said he was up all night
[21:56] preparing for this sermon so it seems
[21:58] perhaps he didn't have enough time to
[22:00] study these scriptures out all the way
[22:02] and just shared what he had found
[22:05] now
[22:07] i'll
[22:09] hope that the audience will not be
[22:11] nervous
[22:13] and i'm trusting to god that i will not
[22:16] be nervous
[22:18] or i've had a tremendous
[22:21] night
[22:22] a lot of strain
[22:24] or i realize that the things that i say
[22:27] this morning will be held against me in
[22:29] the day of the judgment
[22:32] and i
[22:33] i couldn't sleep
[22:35] and i know if i don't say them it'll be
[22:38] held against me in the day of judgment
[22:43] what's interesting is that there is one
[22:45] quote on the other side of this topic in
[22:47] which brother branham tells a woman who
[22:49] is guilty of prostitution that she would
[22:52] make a very good wife to a preacher
[22:54] let's listen to the quote
[22:56] and she said i they sent me to the good
[22:59] shepherd's home which is a catholic
[23:00] institution
[23:02] she said i served my time there three or
[23:04] four years and turned to be a catholic
[23:07] said when i come out
[23:09] of this institution said then
[23:12] i was a catholic i started right back at
[23:15] drinking and prostitution again
[23:17] the law picked me up and gave me
[23:19] four years in the woman's penitentiary
[23:23] when i was in there i served well and
[23:26] kept away from the things because i was
[23:28] i could not find the things in there to
[23:32] drink and so forth said when i come out
[23:34] it didn't do me one bit of good i joined
[23:37] another church i've joined two three
[23:38] churches and said now
[23:40] they finally declared me insane
[23:44] and i said have you ever thought of
[23:46] getting married and have a loving kind
[23:50] husband and a little babies like all
[23:53] real mothers long or real women like to
[23:56] have little ones like
[23:58] see your little girl pushing her little
[24:00] baby cart with a little dolly in it and
[24:02] you know of course she used to be a
[24:04] mother too that's reshaped the mother or
[24:05] something
[24:07] and i said you're in your heart
[24:10] you are telling me that you love to be
[24:12] mary and have a husband i said you're a
[24:15] beautiful girl you'd make a real
[24:18] sweetheart for some little tired
[24:20] preacher of god
[24:22] she said i couldn't promise to preacher
[24:24] no one else nothing in this condition mr
[24:26] branham i said but i want to tell you
[24:28] something
[24:29] your sins may be as black and smutty as
[24:33] hell
[24:34] but i know there is a fountain filled
[24:37] with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins
[24:41] where sinners plunged beneath the
[24:43] fuzzers all their jokes and stains it
[24:46] can make you as white as snow
[24:51] so because we don't have two or three
[24:53] witnesses in the scripture
[24:55] or quotes from brother branham plus a
[24:57] quote on the other side of this issue i
[24:59] do not believe it can be proven to be a
[25:01] genuine doctrine from the holy
[25:03] scriptures
[25:04] reason number two no new testament
[25:07] scripture teaches this doctrine
[25:09] the word virgin is used 14 times in the
[25:12] king james version of the new testament
[25:14] and it was never used in the
[25:16] requirements for a minister of the
[25:17] gospel or preacher
[25:19] and again i could add those 20
[25:21] requirements into this section but i've
[25:23] already covered that so you're aware of
[25:25] those truths and you're aware that the
[25:26] new testament never commands ministers
[25:28] to marry virgins
[25:30] reason number three the levitical
[25:32] priesthood was forever changed
[25:35] when brother branham taught this subject
[25:37] he was referencing leviticus chapter 21
[25:40] which shows the physical requirements of
[25:42] priests and the high priest
[25:44] now to balance this subject out i do
[25:46] agree that god can just use one
[25:48] scripture
[25:49] from the old testament and require in
[25:51] the new testament such as deuteronomy 22
[25:53] verse 5.
[25:54] but if we look at the full context of
[25:56] leviticus 21 we'll find that these
[25:59] priesthood requirements
[26:00] are either types and shadows or are done
[26:02] away with
[26:04] first of all leviticus 21 verses 5 and 6
[26:07] priests could not make baldness on the
[26:09] top of their head nor shave off the
[26:11] corner of their beard nor make any
[26:13] cuttings in their flesh
[26:15] so if this was applied to the new
[26:16] testament any minister who cut his hair
[26:20] and made it bald would be disqualified
[26:22] and any minister who didn't have a fully
[26:24] grown out beard would be disqualified as
[26:26] well verses 7 and 8 and leviticus 21 say
[26:28] a priest could not take a wife that is a
[26:31] or profane nor shall they take a
[26:34] woman put away from her husband
[26:36] recall that the new testament marriage
[26:37] requirement is that the husband must be
[26:39] the husband of one wife according to 1st
[26:42] timothy 3 verse 2. according to
[26:44] leviticus 21 verse 9 the daughter of a
[26:46] priest who played the or profaned
[26:48] herself and father should be burnt with
[26:51] fire and of course we cannot find that
[26:53] requirement in the new testament for
[26:55] ministers nor would we want to because
[26:57] we would hope the spirit of conviction
[26:59] would come upon the daughter and she
[27:01] would repent of her sins and be saved
[27:04] and god would wash her life clean
[27:05] through the blood of jesus christ
[27:08] in leviticus 21 verses 18 through 21 we
[27:11] have a most compelling argument to show
[27:14] how these old testament requirements
[27:15] cannot be applied to the new testament
[27:18] for the bible says the priest cannot
[27:19] have the blemish of blindness
[27:22] or blemish in his eye
[27:24] if this blemish in the eye requirement
[27:27] was also required in the new testament
[27:29] paul would be disqualified because he
[27:31] had a blemish in his eyes according to
[27:33] galatians 4 verses 14 and 15 and
[27:36] galatians 6 verse 11.
[27:39] and of course we know paul was not
[27:40] disqualified from being a minister he
[27:42] was a prophet teacher
[27:45] pastor in ephesus
[27:46] and he was the church age messenger to
[27:48] the age of ephesus
[27:50] more details from leviticus 21 could be
[27:52] shown
[27:53] but i'll stop there and hope these a few
[27:55] examples have proven to you that the
[27:58] levitical requirements are not applied
[28:00] to the new testament ministers and this
[28:02] is because hebrews chapter 7 verses 11
[28:04] and 12 state that the priesthood being
[28:07] changed we're no longer under the
[28:10] levitical aaronic priesthood we're under
[28:12] the priesthood of the lord jesus christ
[28:14] who's a priest forever after the order
[28:17] melchizedek
[28:19] reason number four the obvious double
[28:21] standard
[28:23] among message people i have talked to it
[28:26] seems there's a double standard and that
[28:28] is that
[28:29] only the women are required to be
[28:31] virgins and not men but that would break
[28:33] the old testament scripture
[28:35] and it would also break the type of
[28:37] jesus christ and the church
[28:40] jesus christ was never married so he was
[28:42] a virgin and a preacher is the anti-type
[28:46] of christ the husband
[28:48] also
[28:49] any levitical priest
[28:51] as well as any jewish man could not be
[28:53] impure
[28:55] when they married
[28:56] this is according to deuteronomy 22
[28:58] verses 28 through 30.
[29:00] the man had to marry the first woman
[29:02] that he laid with
[29:05] also in deuteronomy 22 verses 22 through
[29:07] 27 it was death for a man to lay with
[29:10] another man's wife and it was death to
[29:12] rape a woman
[29:14] and also leviticus 21 verse 15 says the
[29:16] high priest could not profane their seed
[29:19] so some who uphold this doctrine that
[29:22] ministers must only marry virgins
[29:24] contradict the word of god when they let
[29:27] men who are not virgins preach the word
[29:28] of god
[29:30] friends please know that god would
[29:32] desire that all would be virgins when
[29:33] they marry according to first
[29:35] thessalonians 4 verse 3
[29:37] that's his perfect will but of course
[29:39] god allows people to choose their own
[29:41] choice through free more agency
[29:43] and god gives them his permissive will
[29:45] but it's clear that many who hold this
[29:47] doctrine and require women to be virgins
[29:50] should also require the men to be
[29:52] virgins as well if they're going to be
[29:53] consistent
[29:55] reason number five this doctrine can be
[29:57] a form of legalism
[30:00] saint paul teaches that injecting any
[30:02] legalistic teaching into the gospel is
[30:04] 11
[30:05] and 11 leavens the whole lump in other
[30:08] words one small false doctrine will lead
[30:10] to many more false doctrines causing the
[30:12] believers to become in bondage to many
[30:15] sins
[30:16] galatians 6
[30:17] 13
[30:18] shows paul addressing the issue of
[30:20] circumcision and he said
[30:22] the evil men brought in circumcision
[30:24] that they made glory in your flesh
[30:27] i think it's clear some message
[30:28] ministers have used this
[30:30] teaching of ministers marrying only
[30:32] virgins to glory in their own flesh
[30:34] they've used it to hurt sisters and
[30:36] brothers and prop themselves up as being
[30:39] holier than other people when the new
[30:41] testament never commands this
[30:42] requirement
[30:43] i believe those who make this a
[30:45] legalistic requirement
[30:46] the wrong scripture the scripture of
[30:49] those who have left the message
[30:51] as brother branham taught in the
[30:52] ephesian church age in chapter 3 in the
[30:54] church age book
[30:56] brother bran taught that the false vine
[30:58] was rulership by man
[31:01] and they took control over the people
[31:02] instead of doing it god's way and they
[31:05] came out with a holy priesthood standing
[31:07] between god and the people
[31:08] they went right back to the old aaronic
[31:10] system
[31:12] but see what was happening back there
[31:15] that false vine was getting a hold and
[31:17] it was teaching that rulership by man
[31:18] was right
[31:20] it taught that the church had to be
[31:21] governed
[31:22] it taught a control over the people but
[31:25] instead of doing it god's way they
[31:27] simply took authority invested all the
[31:28] spiritual power in their own hands
[31:31] and came out with a holy priesthood
[31:33] standing between god and the people they
[31:35] went right back to the old aaronic
[31:37] system
[31:39] so i believe that's what some ministers
[31:41] have done
[31:42] around this message
[31:44] they've made this minister's mary
[31:45] virgins doctrine such an important issue
[31:48] that they've hurt many people in the
[31:50] process of it
[31:51] and created their own legalistic aeronic
[31:54] system
[31:55] and personally i've seen two men who are
[31:57] legalistic regarding this teaching make
[32:00] massive errors in their ministry the
[32:02] first one ultimately rejected holiness
[32:05] and other teachings
[32:06] and has now left the message and some of
[32:08] his children don't even believe in god
[32:10] anymore the second minister is still a
[32:12] pastor here in the usa and through this
[32:14] legalistic requirement has hurt many
[32:16] people in his church causing a church
[32:18] split
[32:19] he's broken up marriages and families
[32:21] and allowed them to remarry which is
[32:23] against the word of god as he basically
[32:26] lords over the heritage and in fact this
[32:28] minister was the only minister in my 17
[32:30] years of preaching who interrupted me
[32:32] when i was preaching on this subject
[32:34] my prayers go out to these ministers and
[32:37] all ministers who make this a legalistic
[32:39] teaching
[32:40] many men and women have suffered under a
[32:42] legalistic application of this teaching
[32:45] and so we're praying for god's people to
[32:47] be healed and delivered from legalism
[32:51] reason number six the blood of jesus
[32:53] christ changes the virginity requirement
[32:56] to spiritual virginity
[32:58] and forgives all sexual sin
[33:01] hebrews 8 6 says the new covenant or new
[33:04] testament is a better covenant
[33:06] established upon better promises
[33:09] additionally hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21
[33:12] say jesus's blood the blood of the
[33:15] everlasting covenant will make you
[33:17] perfect in every good work to do his
[33:19] will
[33:20] working in you that which is well
[33:22] pleasing in his sight through jesus
[33:24] christ to whom be glory for ever and
[33:26] ever amen
[33:28] this better blood covenant that makes
[33:30] christians perfect in every good work is
[33:33] clearly seen when comparing the
[33:35] requirements for old testament priests
[33:37] versus new testament preachers
[33:40] old testament priests had at least 22
[33:43] requirements in leviticus chapter 21
[33:45] while new testament ministers had about
[33:47] 15 requirements in 1st timothy 3 verses
[33:51] seven plus the five i observed in other
[33:54] scriptures
[33:55] notice the contrast between the
[33:56] requirements
[33:57] old testament requirements were mainly
[33:59] natural requirements such as marrying
[34:02] virgins not making your head bald not
[34:04] being lame or blind and so forth
[34:08] new testament requirements are mainly
[34:09] spiritual and deal with a man's
[34:11] spiritual character such as being
[34:13] vigilant apt to teach patient and
[34:16] blameless
[34:18] through the revelation of jesus christ
[34:20] we now see god has changed the virginity
[34:22] requirement from a natural virginity to
[34:24] a spiritual virginity
[34:27] this simply means the soul of the new
[34:28] testament preacher and his wife soul
[34:31] are born again by the baptism of the
[34:33] holy ghost
[34:34] the born-again soul of the christian has
[34:37] a spiritual seed that cannot sin as
[34:40] first john 3 verse 9 teaches
[34:42] whosoever is born of god doth not commit
[34:45] sin for his seed remaineth in him and he
[34:48] cannot sin because he is born of god
[34:51] this soul virginity is the new
[34:53] requirement for a minister and his wife
[34:56] and it's also the same requirement for
[34:58] every believer to be a part of the bride
[35:00] or wife of jesus christ as the following
[35:03] scriptures show
[35:04] second corinthians chapter 11 verses 1-3
[35:08] would to god you could bear with me a
[35:10] little in my folly and indeed bear with
[35:12] me
[35:13] for i am jealous over you with godly
[35:15] jealousy for i have espoused you to one
[35:17] husband then i may present you as a
[35:19] chaste virgin to christ
[35:21] but i fear lest by any means as the
[35:23] serpent begot eve through his subtilty
[35:26] so your mind should be corrupted from
[35:28] the simplicity that is in christ
[35:31] notice paul said it was possible for the
[35:33] church members at corinth to become
[35:35] spiritual chaste virgins
[35:37] yet this was the same church that had a
[35:39] man sleeping with his stepmother in 1st
[35:41] corinthians chapter 5 had adulterers
[35:44] fornicators homosexuals and even child
[35:47] molesters and paul wrote that all their
[35:50] sins could be washed away by the blood
[35:52] of jesus christ through the holy spirit
[35:54] in first corinthians chapter 6 verses
[35:57] 9-11
[35:59] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[36:00] not inherit the kingdom of god be not
[36:03] deceived neither fornicators nor
[36:05] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[36:09] or child molesters nor abusers of
[36:11] themselves with mankind or homosexuals
[36:14] nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards
[36:17] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[36:20] inherit the kingdom of god and such were
[36:22] some of you but ye are washed but ye are
[36:25] sanctified but ye are justified in the
[36:27] name of the lord jesus and by the spirit
[36:30] of our god
[36:31] so through these two portions of
[36:33] scripture we see the truth that jesus
[36:36] blood forgives all sexual sins if truly
[36:39] repented of and makes true believers
[36:41] chaste virgins in their souls unto god
[36:45] but of course those who committed sexual
[36:47] sins are not virgins in their flesh
[36:49] as they still have to live with the
[36:51] consequences of their previous sins but
[36:53] when forgiven and filled with the holy
[36:55] ghost they become virgins in their souls
[36:59] if the blood of jesus christ washes away
[37:01] the sexual and spiritual sin from his
[37:05] church his bride and makes her a virgin
[37:08] to him
[37:09] who is the word then surely god can do
[37:11] this with a new testament woman who
[37:13] would be married to a new testament
[37:15] preacher
[37:16] notice the type jesus christ is the
[37:18] husband a virgin husband and he calls us
[37:20] his virgin bride
[37:22] yet many of us have been impure sexually
[37:24] before marriage and yet he forgives us
[37:26] of that and still calls us a spiritual
[37:28] virgin
[37:29] and on the spiritual level many of us
[37:31] have been handled by a man-made
[37:33] denomination
[37:34] and yet jesus is able to draw us out of
[37:36] those man-made creeds and organizations
[37:39] and call us virgin by the word of god
[37:41] so if jesus can make his own wife who is
[37:44] many times a natural and spiritual
[37:46] fornicator a virgin to him how much more
[37:49] could jesus christ forgive a natural
[37:51] preacher and his wife
[37:53] of their sexual sins
[37:55] and make them virgins to him as well
[37:57] of course we know the physical act of
[37:59] fornication will have consequences and
[38:02] the physical act can never be done away
[38:03] with
[38:04] but the fact is jesus christ's blood can
[38:06] forgive those mistakes
[38:09] and make the heart and soul of the
[38:10] believer a virgin to jesus christ just
[38:13] as the scriptures say
[38:15] notice romans 7 verses one through six
[38:18] the bible says we were previously
[38:19] married to the law
[38:21] but then says that we should be married
[38:23] to another even christ
[38:25] so this proves all believers were once
[38:27] manhandled by another system whether the
[38:30] jews under the law or the gentiles who
[38:33] had the law written in their hearts
[38:34] according the book of romans
[38:36] in other words all people were either
[38:38] married to the law
[38:40] or a life of sin before coming to jesus
[38:42] christ but the bible says we've died to
[38:44] our first husband and now we're married
[38:46] to jesus christ and paul says we're
[38:48] chaste virgins to christ
[38:51] in fact in the sermon spoken word is
[38:53] original seed brother branham said
[38:55] christ the word
[38:56] is virgin so the bride will have to be
[38:59] just like him
[39:00] virgin by the word
[39:02] the
[39:03] true bride
[39:04] like nerdy
