TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now I'll read verse 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned no and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so Matthew 28 we saw one perspective of Jesus giving the Great Commission and he said it's recorded there just to teach but then here in Mark 16 we have another perspective of Jesus's last Great Commission and here we see the power of God here we see the supernatural work of the Holy Ghost praise God but we're not done I want to read verse 19 and 20 as well and so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God I love verse 20 and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen aren't you glad that God confirms his word with Supernatural signs amen hallelujah let's have one more word of prayer can we just bow our heads for a moment here and let's all agree together in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight God we thank you for this opportunity to be gathered with Saints of like Precious Faith Lord I love all those songs we sing Lord God thank you for paying the debt that we all owed we all owe to sin debt because the wages of sin is death but thanks be to God Hallelujah for giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ thank you Lord Jesus for taking all of our sin upon you all of our trespasses all of our iniquity and you paid the price for our forgiveness Lord God hallelujah you became our sin that we might become your righteousness so Lord we stand here as righteous Sons and Daughters of God today by Grace Lord God and no one can lay any charge to God's elect Hallelujah thank you God for the love of God for the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ God anoint me to preach tonight Lord God and I pray you'd anoint your people to receive the word of God and Lord I just I pray that your spirit would now flow like we sang Lord may you just flow through me flow through each and every person God for your glory in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated there praise God I'll try to preach just for an hour tonight you know by the grace of God I got a big trip home as well two and a half hour trip and my family sends their greetings you know my wife wanted to come but we had we had three little ones and we didn't want them driving in the car for 5 hours they kind of get cranky and a little tired you know uh but hopefully maybe next time my wife could come by God's grace uh so we're again happy to be here it was great to see all you when you come down or come up to akan rather uh a number of weeks ago that was such a wonderful time in the Lord and we sure appreciate the sacrifice everybody made and and uh I've been hearing about wonderful baptisms uh more people being baptized that's that's awesome it's just a wonderful blessing to know that people want to be identified with the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so may God richly bless uh each one of you is anyone here that was recently baptized okay not not here okay it would have been Marlin and Matt Marlon Barkman Matt Troyer and then my sister-in-law Mary Joyce all right praise God well I certainly thank the Lord for their souls being baptized praise prise God what a blessing Hallelujah God is really moving praise God hallelujah when a soul gets saved the Bible said there's rejoicing in the presence of the Angels so there's been a lot of angels rejoicing around here lately by God's grace these last few months Hallelujah so I want to just take this thought in Lord willing I'll try like I said try to preach for about an hour here and I want to uh I want to just uh show the importance of having the right Doctrine um and of course you know and show some examples from the Bible of solid Doctrine and then of course doctrine of devils so we can discern uh by God's grace between uh both of them so we saw our text here and and here we read the Great Commission from both perspectives from the perspective of Matthew uh in Matthew 28 and their perspective from Luke and we see in both cases here in both cases Jesus says we're to teach All Nations right and as we go and teach All Nations then God will give us signs wonders and miracles in other words God will do Supernatural things to vindicate that his word is being preached and I'm sure uh I'm sure as we've seen even brother John be healed right recently and uh and and brother Daniel talking about his Deliverance those are just two simple examples right of how God comes and he vindicates his truth right God was leading you into truth God's been leading you and God's been leading each one of you into truth and and uh and and amongst the believer God will do Supernatural things he his spirit will drop down and do something spontaneous something Supernatural so that the people will know that God is with them Hallelujah so I hope the church tonight I hope all of you know God is with you praise God if he's setting people free if he's saving people uh if he's healing people's bodies if he's giving you Supernatural dreams right sister Hallelujah if God is giving you Supernatural experiences then that's a it's a test that Jesus Christ is with you praise God his spirit is right here amongst us tonight praise God because we've invited him we've prayed to him we've worshiped to him and he said whether two or three are gathered there I am in the midst praise God so we're thankful that Jesus Christ is here hallelujah and I believe tonight he'll vindicate his word hallelujah some way or another like even last night uh after service you know uh and then today a sister come up and said I really enjoyed last night's service that's just what I needed to hear and and then a couple weeks ago I was preaching and someone come up come up after services and brother Jesse that was exactly I've been struggling with that thought all week and then you came and you came and preach exactly what I was struggling with and God has Set Me Free praise God Amen so that's just how Jesus works praise God the Bible said they that are led by the spirit they're the sons of God hallelujah and so church we always want to be led by the Holy Spirit we want to obey the Holy Spirit and then we want to see the Holy Spirit lead us to say things lead us to do things lead us move us it might seem strange at the time but if we're obeying the word of God and we feel a certain leading then we want to go through with that leading praise God like one time I was over there in Indiana preaching and and I kept going to this side I kept preaching on a certain I kept preaching on a thought about uh you know sexual sin for some reason I kept going to this side and I even during the sermon I'm like why am I going to this side and everybody was laughing well a young man probably about 18 he come up for prayer afterwards and he said brother Jesse I've been struggling with pornography he said and you kept coming to preach that right at me and I had no idea I had no idea and so that's just a testimony of of sometimes God's leading you to say things and do things and even might be leading in a certain direction praise God like he kept leading me to one side of the church and and it's just God God is trying to reach his people praise God and the and the young man was sincere he cried and I kept I kept in touch with him for a few weeks on the text and he was getting Victory by God's grace and uh I I haven't checked in with him lately but I trust by the grace of God that he's obeyed the voice of the Holy Spirit praise God and so you know that God is uh God is here and he's speaking to us here tonight I believe he'll continue to speak to us here by God's grace now I'd like to I'd like to get you to also look at a few verses here um let's let's look at 2 Timothy 4 if we can 2 Timothy 4 verse1 uh we I'll start reading at verse one um of course this is Paul's last letter before he was beheaded as a martyr in Rome and these are some of the last words the Holy Spirit had him write to us so these are beautiful words 2 Timothy 4:1 and I want to now look at the the phrase or the two words sound Doctrine he's going to say it in verse three but I want to get to my thought about sound do Doctrine verse versus doctrines of devils all right and you're a you're a group that's freshly come out of denomination right or man-made Creeds and man-made Rule and so and now you're free in Christ Jesus and so the Holy Spirit as he's here amongst you he's going to bring in Preachers and anoint preachers to teach you true Doctrine to give you the true teaching of the Holy Spirit and every now and then you know the enemy might come in and he might try to bring somebody in here and they might try to spread a a a false Doctrine among you just say have you heard about this and have you heard about that and you might want to do this and and youve got to have your guard up you got to be able to resist the devil praise God when the devil brings a false Doctrine or a false uh a doctrine of a devil you got to be able to resist that and you got to turn down that and you got to you resist that by the grace of God and you got to stay with true Doctrine and true teaching by the grace of God hallelujah all right so 2 Timothy 4:1 I charge the therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season and osas in other words our preachers must be always be ready to preach right sometimes we're not ready but God will be ready for us amen hallelujah that's happened to me many times I don't feel ready but then God will put some thoughts on in my mind and I'll preach it and it will bless the people anyway praise God I just got to be a willing vessel preachers just have to be willing vessels praise God and then if they're obedient and they have confessed their sins God will anoint them to preach exactly what the people have need of hallelujah amen glory preach the word now we finish that uh let's finish verse two reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine so preachers have to be very longsuffering in other words they they got to preach the truth but they got to be patient and let the people grow into the word of God I mean we wish we wish it was easy just we could you know tomorrow morning we could wake up and have all of our all our disciplines and we'd have no more trials and you know no no more no more battles to go through that'd be wonderful if I could just go from immature to mature one night I could go to bed immature wake up mature that'd be wonderful but that's not how character is made that's not even how plants natural plants right you don't plant them one day and the next day oh the fruit's here oh Glory no it takes patience you have to work through the season you got to Pray For Rain amen hallelujah you got to weed Hallelujah you got to you got to do your part pray you got to trust the process right but you have to do the work praise God you got to go through the process and the changes and the seasons so it is with us praise God we've got to preach the word of God and let the people receive it and it's got to grow up they have to grow up into the faith praise God they got to receive the word of God and they got to work with it and you got to be patient and you got to let them understand the word of God and you got to let them grow into a real Christian praise God Amen verse three now he says for time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine now that's a prophecy of this time most churches will not accept sound Doctrine now sound Doctrine just means healthy so you take a it means spiritual health when we preach by the Holy Spirit it produces healthy Christians amen it doesn't produce sick Christians who are depressed all the time addicted to pornography like we said right that's unhealthy Christians anger and bitterness and broken homes and divorces and and adulteries and fornications that's unhealthy living but the real Holy Spirit produces a healthy Christian Life praise God hallelujah and when we teach the truth of God's word it produces a real Christian Life like just an example two nights ago uh we had a Believers come over they're Christians but they don't believe all the Revelation God's given to us and the the the gentleman came over I think he's 45 years old he's a few years older than me I'm 42 and he said brother Jesse he said there's something different about your family I got eight kids he said I feel peace in this home and I said well that's just the grace of God that's just the Holy Spirit I kind of gave my wife a little pat on the back I said give all the credit to mom over there you you know Hallelujah I like to give her she she's with the kids most of the day right as I go to work you know but he said there's something different about your family and I tried to point him to the Bible the revelation God has given us the revelation of God the mysteries of God are finished the Bible says hallelujah and I just it was just a fresh reminder to me that when a a Christian and a family loves Jesus and keeps a healthy Christian Life people are going to notice it praise God he's like I want to read your book and he couldn't believe I could write 800 page book and I said it wasn't me it was Jesus if any good thing comes out of my life it wasn't me because Jesus said in John 15:5 without me you can do nothing praise God none of us can do anything good unless we yield to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit takes control of Our Lives amen and then God can do something with our lives hallelujah praise God Amen thank you Jesus just a fresh reminder to me that most churches don't do not carry sound Doctrine and we'll give us some examples uh later by God's grace why not because let's let's finish verse three but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears so doctrines of devils are are teachings that preachers teach or preachers preach and it allows the people to enjoy the lust of the flesh right so that's how you know that's how you're going to know as we go through some of these scriptures there's obvious examples in the Bible any preacher that allows you to enjoy the lust of the Flesh in a sinful way is a false teacher right and they're preaching false Doctrine but a man of God who's led by the holy spirit will teach you to live a holy life and a real Christian loves living a holy life praise God Amen because you love Jesus said if you love me you'll keep my commands praise God so the Gospel of Jesus Christ is based upon love if I love Jesus I love to obey him praise God now am I gonna have a fight yes I'm gonna have a fight every day with my worst enemy you know who my worst enemy Sister Sarah is you know who it is it's me Jesse Smith's worst enemy is Jesse Smith you say it's the devil well yeah he's he's my enemy but the Bible says Paul said that my greatest enemy is the sin that dwells within me remember that Romans chapter 7 amen he says I want to do good but then Evil's right there with me and then I hate what I do right he he ended up when he sins he hates what he does so in other words Paul's saying I'm my worst enemy right so we can't just blame Satan all the time sometimes well many times we give into our own fleshly desires right Hallelujah now IID like to uh I'll just stop right there well let's read verse four and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables I don't want to be a preacher of fables I want to be a preacher of Truth like a fable is oh just just say a prayer and everybody's going to heaven that's a fable oh you can be a Christian and really live any way you want God's going to forgive you eventually you can just sin however you want that's a favor the Bible says all that live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution and the Bible says without Holiness no man shall see the Lord praise God see we don't want to preach fables uh just you know stories to people we want to tell you the truth we want to tell you the real gospel the good news that Jesus Christ died for our sins and when we have faith in him it transforms our hearts and our lives hallelujah oh my thank God amen glory now this word Doctrine means to teach so Paul said the real Christians will have healthy Doctrine or healthy teaching but the false Christians right will have doctrines of devils that eventually lead to the lust of the flesh okay now let's I want to show this here uh it'd be important to show this by God's grace 2 Corinthians 11:20 and brother Daniel can you read that when you get that 2 Corinthians 11:20 for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt if a man SM you on the face amen now look at this verse friends this verse is essentially saying who's the one that's going to cause all the trouble sometimes in the church the preachers right so we got to make sure we got Holy Ghost filled preachers amen hallelujah amen the preachers are going to either build you up or they're going to tear you down thank God they build us up here hallelujah amen thank God Hallelujah now you guys left a preacher that tore you down I'm just going to be personal here for a moment tore down your faith tore down your freedom tears down all this but now you're free in Christ Jesus praise God and now the preachers are building you up Hallelujah they're preaching you the word of God and when you receive the word of God it strengthens you to fight against the enemy praise God to overcome Satan to overcome Temptation you're strengthened by the word of God hallelujah it's the word of God that gives you life it's the word of God that gives you Victory Hallelujah believing the true word of God and a man of God will preach you the word of God because he's preaching the words of Life Hallelujah and a real preacher will preach and the life of Christ will inspire you to live closer to Jesus praise God Amen read that again brother Daniel read that again buddy for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man Smite you on the face now look at that it says they suffer see the Corinthian Church was allowing false preachers to do that Hallelujah now you all wouldn't let it happen because you all one night before the preacher come up you took some oil and you prayed and you laid it on the chairs amen amen see you are all led by the Holy Spirit to get rid of that false teaching thank God that was a real Act of Faith praise God Amen I told that to our church that's a real testimony there by God's grace talk about the prayer the prayers of the Saints having effect that's beautiful praise God because a man will tear you down but we can't allow it right we can't allow men to tear us down if they got the wrong Spirit we got to get that man out and we got to get men who believe in the Holy Spirit praise God who believe the revelation of Jesus Christ for this hour hallelujah amen thank god oh that's beautiful thank you brother I appreciate that so see God is either going to use uh I'm sorry God is going to use men who are led by the Holy Spirit to build you up but Satan's going to try to send men that are not led by the Holy Spirit but you've got to turn them down you've got to refuse them as you already have experience doing that so if another false teaching would come in you'll be able by the grace of God to withstand it and to send it out of your midst by the grace of God hallelujah how many believe that by God's grace Glory thank the Lord now we just showed you then now in these last two verses we need sound Doctrine we need healthy teaching right but Satan's going to try to anoint men to bring in in false doctrines that hurt the people that harm the people all right now let me uh I want to go to this next thought go to Matthew 4:23 if you got your Bibles I want to just go back to this here before I move on to some of these examples Matthew 4:23 brother irin you want to read that brother Matthew 4:23 and Jesus about all G teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner decease among the people amen hallelujah thank you brother now reason I had him read that where's my scripture okay yeah the reason I had him read that was because look at the ministry of Jesus Jesus did both preaching and teaching how many know there's a difference does everyone know there's a difference between preaching and teaching there's a difference teaching is giving instruction so they said Master teach us to pray and what' he do he showed them how to pray here's how you pray Our Father out in heaven how be your name let your kingdom come let your will be done forgive us our debts as we he gives us the outline teach us he teach us where to pray where do we pray many times in our prayer closet Hallelujah he teaches us how to give arms Lord teach us how to give arms teach us how to fast and he said he shows us how to do that he gives us instructions this is how you do it praise God that's teaching whenever a man of God goes to the word of God and tells you this is how you do something that's teaching but preaching is different preaching is declaring the promises of God okay so you'll have a teacher and maybe he'll teach you about you know praying fasting or giving alms he'll be able to teach you right through the scriptures but then he may break into preaching and he'll declare that Jesus Christ Is A Healer amen Jesus Christ is a savior you can be he declare that he'll declare Jesus Christ can heal you today Jesus Christ wants to save you Jesus Christ can fill you with the Holy Ghost praise God Amen declaring proud Jesus cares about you Jesus uh is patient with you amen Jesus will forgive you all these statements are just preaching which is good we got to have both Hallelujah so Jesus would preach and say I I'm here to heal remember he read he read uh Isaiah 61 remember in Luke chapter 4 Hallelujah let's read that Luke chapter 4 and here's the the here's the preaching about Jesus what he would do and what he did Verse 18 Luke 4:18 brother John you want to read that when you got that Luke 4:18 sir the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to sit at Liberty them that are bruised amen and go read verse 19 brother beautiful preach the acceptable year of the Lord hallelujah what word did he use did he did he use teach in here no preach amen preach means to publish or declare good news hallelujah amen amen so here Jesus was saying I am anointed to preach I'm preaching good news to the poor hallelujah what's the good news that God will provide for you if you're poor praise God God will provide somehow Hallelujah that's good news and now that he'll provide for your spiritual needs because we're all Sinners we've all fallen short of the glory of God and God can provide us spiritual riches praise God because that's what's most important is spiritual riches not so much natural riches thank God for the jobs that we have in the homes and even this this wonderful garage we have here by God's grace thank God for them but the greatest riches we can have is the riches of God's grace hallelujah amen amen amen turn my page so so he would he would say I can heal the brokenhearted that's preaching Jesus would preach to the people I'm here to heal your broken hearts that's preaching Hallelujah he said I'm here to bring Deliverance to all those who are captive I'm here to set you free the holy spirit is here so you'll be free praise God Amen you'll not be a slave you'll not be a prisoner to uh evil addictions and and lust of the Flesh and pride of life you won't be addicted because I'm here to set you free he Saidi going to give sight to the blind Hallelujah I'm going to set at Liberty them that are bruised praise God oh my Hallelujah that's he was preaching he's declaring praise God and so you'll be able to recognize that now as ministers come in or God anoints your brothers here to preach over here they'll either be teaching giving instruction how to do something or they'll be preaching and declaring the word of God how many know that we need both of those because Jesus did both he bro he both preached and he taught irin read it right Irvin read it Jesus preached and he taught now go to acts 5 Acts chapter 5 I think it was 42 if I'm not mistaken yeah Acts 5:42 Acts 5:42 sister Ruth you want to read that for us when you get that acts 542 now look at the apostles now so we saw Jesus preached and he taught let's see if the apostles did the same thing or not go ahead sister whenever you're ready temp amen praise God see you got to have both Hallelujah there's some Services where it's going to be a preaching God's a savior God's a savior God can save you and then people will get saved afterwards or preaching God's A Healer God's A Healer and people some some person's body will be healed afterwards amen praise God or someone's brokenhearted and the the sermons on Jesus can heal your broken heart you can love and you can forgive again and all these things and someone's heart will be healed praise God oh my thank God but then there's other services where it's just going to teach you how to live a holy life it's going to teach you how to forgive praise God it's going to teach you the Seven Seals which I might preach next week by God's grace or in two weeks sorry two Thursdays teach you to understand and give you instruction here's what you need to do here's what you have to understand amen there's both preaching and teaching he amen thank God Hallelujah now some churches are guilty of too much preaching brother urvan it's all miracles all miracles all miracles and you never learn the word and you never get instructed on how to do anything it's just believe believe believe and trust God today's your day for a miracle today's your day for every service is a day for a miracle right but that's the Bible said do all work miracles no and then there's some churches that all those do is teach you this here's how you do this here's how you do this and they don't give you enough they don't give you enough preaching so what do we need we need both praise God we got to have both like for example our church we just had a brother from South Carolina come up and preach uh he's an evangelist so he just goes from church to church and he's a preacher he's not a teacher he'll he'll tell you he said if you want me to teach I can't teach anything I'm here to preach and boy he preached he really raised our faith I'm like Hallelujah I'd be like I could go stomp on uh 12 Devils right now just feel like I could just he just my faith is so high like God gives us all these promises and God is with me and God's C is never going to filine I felt like Abraham like I can just walk out every promise of God it raised my my faith and then we'll have like another we'll have a teacher come in and he'll teach us more insight on how to pray more sincerely oh I never I never thought about that now I now I can approach God through this scripture and I can I can pray more sincere this way oh such a great teaching see how there's a difference can everybody see how there's a difference by God's grace you know that the night Jesus was arrested do you remember what he said I think it's in Matthew let's go to Matthew I'm I I don't have it looked up here but let me see if I can find it Jesus said you come you said you're coming out you're coming to arrest me uh with staves and swords but wasn't I daily with you in the temple how many remember that yeah it's Matthew 26 I believe there it is 55 yeah there is 26 thank thank you Jesus I didn't have that scripture written down so the Lord helped me to me remember it praise God Matthew 26:55 in the same hour said Jesus to the multitudes are you come out as against a thief with swords and stains for to take me I sat daily with you doing what teaching in the temple and you laid no hold on me see not not every service was Jesus healing everyone in a prayer line not every service many services were like that but remember he go to Nazareth and could he do could he do prayer lines in Nazareth and heal everybody no the Bible said he was rejected by his own people the Bible said because of their unbelief he couldn't do Miracles he couldn't preach to them think about that God wanted to do Miracles there but they didn't believe and they had something against Jesus and so no Miracles could be done right but here today the holy spirit's here today to raise our faith so we can receive Miracles when God wants to do Miracles but the holy holy spirit is also here to teach us how to live a holy life praise Goden teach us how to pray teach us how to fast and give HS and be a real Christian teach us the Bible how to understand it how to live it how can I forgive how can I how can I be a real blessing to my neighbor how can I how can I witness to win souls because the Bible says he that's wise wins Souls Hallelujah Lord teach me how to save my mother or save my father from out of denomination or teach me how to do that see so we have both Saints we have both preaching to declare God's promises and raise our faith and then we have teaching to show us how to do things Hallelujah didn't the Bible say in Romans 10 that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God hallelujah so see the preaching is either raising our faith for Supernatural works of God God or to believe God or it's teaching us as well it's giving us more faith okay this is how I trust God this is how I become more faithful in my prayer life this is how I overcome Temptations of the flesh this is how I this is how I overcome these Temptations in my life it's teaching me how to do it like just for example uh you know the holy spirit's here to teach us how to how to serve God right away in the morning you know some people they get up and then they go get a pot of coffee or they got to eat like a whole bowl of cereal and they haven't even read their Bibles or they haven't even prayed now I'm not I'm not a legalist but you know the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God right and his righteousness so in other words some people are like Sinners well they'll get up and they'll just turn on the TV right away and they haven't even prayed they haven't you of course they're Sinners right they haven't sought God they haven't worshiped God they haven't read their Bibles but if we're going to be Christians we should be able to talk we should be able to be taught by the Holy Spirit how to seek God first amen how to keep God first cuz Jesus said if you seek me first what everything's going to be what added unto you all these other things the clothing the food and all the shelter and everything uh your your crops you know all that's going to be added but you got to seek God first hallelujah amen taught to seek God first taught to worship God first before going about your day amen praise God all right so what was Jesus doing all the time if he wasn't having healing Miracles what was he doing brother Irvin he was teaching the people he just sat down there the Bible said he'd sit on salomon's porch and he would just everybody would sit down he just instruct he he he teach about you know uh he teach about the second coming right he talk about the second coming he he teach Parables he teach all these things he teach about prayer and how you must become like a child to enter the kingdom of God so when he wasn't doing the Miracles and doing the healing and the prayer lines he was teaching the people how many would like to sat and listen to Jesus teach amen one thing we know for sure he would have been confusing all those smart educated Pharisees right because he was doing that at 12 years old Hallelujah and then by the time he was 33 they said we can't ask any more questions we're out of here we we can't handle this guy praise God amen he was such a wise teacher of the word of God hallelujah the father he said I I don't say anything except the father shows me first praise God Amen Hallelujah that's how we should be we shouldn't say anything we shouldn't do anything until God gives us an unction or God gives us a leading of the Holy Spirit God give us a leading tonight praise God Amen Hallelujah now go to 1 Timothy 4 we went to Second Timothy 4 let's go to 1 Timothy 4 now I want to start looking at this list now here let's look at some actual examples here of doctrines of devils most of us if you've been in the I know brother Irvin's been in the Bible most of his adult life is that right brother you've been Christian most of your adult life Hallelujah so most of these uh most of us have a good understanding of doctrines of sound Doctrine Holiness right but I want you to see some real examples of devilish doctrines so you'll be able to recognize the enemy right at every one of his trips praise God second I'm sorry 1 Timothy 4:1 now the spirit speaks expressly that in the latter times are we the latter times it's been 2,000 years since Christ right I I believe we're in the latter times so some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing Spirits which are deceiving seducing means deceiving spirits and doctrines of devils wow so we're I'm either teaching Doctrine from God tonight or doctrine from a devil and I believe it's from the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah and the way you know is test me by the word of God Paul said prove all things hold fast that which is good amen hallelujah Paul told Timothy rightly divide the word of truth hallelujah the Bible said in first John try every Spirit see whether it be of the spirit of God and how can you know God tells us we go back to the holy scriptures praise God Jesus said Thy word is truth sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth this is the truth praise God Amen and the Bible says in the Old Testament any man that doesn't speak according to this word does not have God in him praise God Amen Hallelujah so let's look at some ex uh specific examples of doctrines of devils all right so the first one now this might seem strange to you uh verse two speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience sear with a hot iron okay so these preachers will just lie to people and their conscience is seared in other words they don't have a Feeling Anymore of right or wrong I'm sure all of us know this if we've been serving God a long time right when we first become a Christian we're so sensitive to sin right oh there's a I don't want to lie I don't want to steal I don't want to think evil thoughts I don't want to say evil words but we all know if we've been serving God a long time if we're not careful we lose that sensitivity sometimes the church said amen in other words it it doesn't doesn't feel so bad to sin like it used to right like I told you with Paul Paul said I got good and evil right there and then sometimes I do what I hate see sometimes church we lose that but a sinner a false teacher has lost all feeling of that that's why they can say such ridiculous things that they don't feel bad about it unbelievable so we must keep our sensitivity to the Holy Spirit and the way to do that is to daily confess our sins and to stay in the word of God hallelujah brothers and sisters man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God if you haven't read your Bible today it's time to read your Bible praise God make sure you read it before you go to bed you should probably read it before you go to bed too even if you read it this morning praise God I'm in jobes I read job this morning by God's grace amen now here's the first example verse three what's the first doctrine of a devil forbidding to marry did everybody catch that forbidding to marry now which church is famous for forbiding people to marry the Roman Catholic Church they have Priestly celibacy right so we know right now it's an absolute doctrine of a devil to tell preachers they shouldn't get married it's from the devil and what do it cause child abuse homosexual priests and nuns that's what it calls the Bible said that's a doctrine of a devil Hallelujah now the second one and verse three and commanding to abstain from meat so anyone that says oh you must be a vegetarian you can't eat meat that's a doct of a devil think about that a devil would say just be a vegetarian and if you eat meat you're a sinner a devil would say that why because it's a it's an issue of Pride it's self-righteousness well I don't eat meat so I'm holier than brother Irvin I'm holier than Daniel because I don't eat meat that's Pride a devil imagine that a devil's trying to twist people's diets now it's okay to be a vegetarian if you want the sin is when you say you can't eat meat that's the sin that's the devil because it's building a denomination right it's a denomination of we're all we're all vegetarians or we're not saved right that's what the Bible says look how look how deceptive Satan is he tells the preachers they can't marry Roman Catholic Church then he says you can't eat Meats now the Roman Catholic Church does that on Fridays during Lent they can't eat meat but then they can eat fish but fish is meat according to the Bible so they contradict themselves it is the B Jesus said give me some meat oh thank you buddy I appreciate that God bless you Hallelujah right Jesus resurrected he said give me some meat right what they give him fish Catholic say we're not eating meat give me fish that's a contradiction right it's a doctrine of a devil oh we're holy and uh we're holy we we don't our preachers don't marry we don't eat meat on Fridays what difference does it make doesn't make any difference it's a self-made righteousness it's a man-made Creed it's a man-made denomination and it's from the devil I just showed it to you praise God that's not my opinion that's what the Bible says how many you believe the Bible praise God Amen now let me show you another one go to Second Timothy 2 Verse 18 2 Timothy 2:18 now Paul lists two men in verse 17 who are spreading this doctrine of a devil now look at this doctrine of a Dev Verse 18 who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthroweth the faith of some now look look just just stop for a moment here look what he says the two false preachers are saying the resurrection's already done in other words there's no more Resurrection there's no Rapture right there's not going to be any Resurrection uh Jesus Jesus and the Saints Old Testament Saints are the only ones who had a resurrection we're not getting a resurrection or there's no Rapture and the Bible says this overthrows people's Faith so a devil will say there's no Rapture we're just going to live here and die and that's that's the end of it that's a lie the Bible says some of us are going to be privileged enough to be alive when Jesus comes back amen hallelujah but the dead in Christ will rise first hallelujah amen Paul's going to rise Peter's going to rise John's going to rise James is going to rise and some of us may see them by the grace of God if we live to see it but a devil will say there's no Resurrection there's no Rapture coming that's a preacher who's anointed of the devil how do you know because look what it does in verse 19 I'm sorry oh I'm sorry yeah I got to read 17 I'm sorry 17 is what the Bible is what it's called in the Bible and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is H hus and fitus okay a canker is a flesh eating disease so how many ever heard of leprosy right leprosy will eat away right at your skin it's something similar to canker something similar to that in other words Paul is saying the preachers that say there's no Rapture if the people accept that it'll be like a flesh eating cancer will eat up all their faith it will just it will destroy them church that means we got to be looking for the coming of Jesus we can't stop looking for the coming of Jesus we got to be ready Jesus said Watch and Pray so that day doesn't come upon you as a thief in the night how many looking for Jesus tonight praise God he could come tonight praise God he can come tomorrow we got to keep looking for Christ don't let your faith get eaten up and get cankered away keep trusting in God hallelujah if we if we have to go to the grave and Jesus still hasn't come that's fine I'll go to my grave saying I'm looking for Jesus to come back praise God and I'll be the first one to rise Hallelujah Hopey those would be my last words if I go to the Grave you know if Jesus doesn't come back in my lifetime I hope those are my last words let me be the first to rise the dead in Christ will rise first first amen thank God Hallelujah there is a resurrection there is a Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ of the body of Christ amen now friends there's a whole there's a whole bunch of uh doctrines out there that are false doctrines and let me let me check my time here how much time have I been preaching I just want to preach out okay 46 minutes already that's hard to believe I just have a hard time believing that all right um the next one the fourth one I've showed you three already the fourth doctrine of a devil is a doctrine of no fasting right that's spoken of we're not going to read it but just write it down if you want or just you know I record this I can share with brother irin if you want Mark 2:20 and Philippians 3:19 in Philippians 3:19 Paul said false preachers make their belly their God in other words they're only interested in getting enough money so they can feed their big bellies right they only want to be a Christian or they only want to be connected to the church so they can get more food isn't that something that's what Paul said that's not what I said Paul said that they're God they worship their belly right they're more concerned about food than God's word it's a script it's a it's a it's a doctor of a devil more and and didn't Jesus say they'll be eating and drinking like the days of Noah at the end time all they're concerned about is eating and drinking all it's all they're concerned about they can't they don't fast for Jesus they don't fast to grow closer to God or bring healing to people they don't fast at all it's all about just eating and drinking eating and drinking that's all they do and they made their belly their God now I do want you to read this one go to um Jude 1 verse4 if you got your Bible there maybe Micaiah can you get Jude 1 verse4 buddy it's at the very back of the Bible the LA second to last book of the Bible Jude 1 verse4 here's the fifth doctrine of a devil and I mentioned this earlier the fifth doctrine of a devil is called lashious if you're familiar with the King James that word means lawlessness so the devil will come and say oh you're saved by grace live however you want I mentioned it earlier that's a Doctrine from hell you can't say well I'm under grace I'll just live however I want I can go sin and do whatever I want no sir that's the devil saying that go ahead buddy got it Jude one verse4 are Cain of our God Only Our Lord Jesus Christ great reading buddy boy you got a good teacher my friend you read pretty good compared to these public school kids I'm around you're good buddy Hallelujah so what do he say there are men that are ordained to condemnation other words God has forn knowledge they're going to be the false teachers and God knows they're going to come in and they're going to change Grace Grace is a gift right but Paul says shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid in other words should we keep sinning so God can have more grace on us and show more love to us Paul said God forbid that's in Romans chapter 6 I believe if I'm not mistaken see so Micaiah read it very well evil men will turn Grace into lawlessness well you know you can you can go ahead and divorce that woman and go ahead marry another one and if you want go ahead divorce again and just marry another it's okay you're saved by grace no it's not no it's not you can't do that you marry one Jesus said go back to the beginning with Adam and Eve praise God go back to the beginning it's one man one woman until death praise God The Vow lasts until death but see you know a lot you you guys may you may or may not know it but a lot of churches in America a allow people to marry two and three and four times that's from hell that's a doctrine of a devil Hallelujah and so it is when they say oh it's okay you can go get drunk like my wife was raised in the Lutheran Church and their preachers actually allow them to drink alcohol and get drunk but as long as they come to church on Sunday it's okay I had a friend brother Irving he was a Lutheran he's a paper Lutheran his whole wall was filled with empty beer cans I mean it looked like a stor shell and he was proud of that now that's sad friends that's sad but who allowed it the preachers allowed it what was it a doctrine of a devil right the their their God was their belly Hallelujah and the Bible says be not drunk with wine which is going to excess but the Bible said be drunk with the Holy Spirit praise God that's what we need today we need somebody drunk with the spirit of God hallelujah they're so in love with Jesus they look like they're drunk but I look like I'm drunk yet tonight praise God hallelujah drunk on the spirit of God they just love God they just want to give God praise they want to love God that's what that and they accuse him of being drunk on the day of Pentecost may may God granted that some in this church will be accused of being drunk on the Holy Ghost praise God oh let it be me Let It Be You praise God each one of us should be so full of the spirit of God that we're filled with God's love and power amen hallelujah I hope somebody in my life can accuse me you look like you're drunk y say not of natural wine spiritual wine amen hallelujah that's what I want my testimony to me praise God and then I want to live holy tomorrow too amen when I'm not shouting or Screaming or dancing I still want to live holy all the days of my life you know why cuz Jesus said be holy because I'm holy am but the Bible also said be uh rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice hallelujah praise God the Bible also says to be full of joy full of rejoicing praise God amen amen hallelujah and I preached that last time I'm going to say it here again remember last time I was dancing around here I had to make sure I didn't hit my head right I had to make sure I jumped over here I didn't hit my head on that metal piece right there because David danced with all of his heart and God God was blessed by it God looked down from heaven and said there's a man after my own heart right there Hallelujah other words you you each one of us need to be free to give God glory praise God like when we're singing that song like we sang today those three songs some of you can have the freedom just shout out praise God or can shout out Hallelujah praise God you just keep singing you know Hallelujah there's freedom in the Holy Spirit praise God even while I'm preaching you some of you can stand up and say amen that's not going to hurt my feelings that just shows you're really believing what you're hearing amen hallelujah praise God Amen one time I preached and the people were pulling so hard I had to stop preaching I couldn't preach anymore the whole church it was at Cam's Church my brother cam I was preaching about Elijah and Elisha and I was saying how elishah had to keep watching Elijah the whole time as long as he kept his eyes on Elijah he get that double portion so he just followed him around everywhere he went said I'm found Elijah I'm found Elijah and God sent us an Elijah this day too hallelujah praise God and he saw when Elijah went up he was watching he said oh my father my father the the Chariots of Israel the horsemen thereof oh my that that actually means Elijah you're more important to us than all the Chariots and horses and swords the man of God the daughters of God the children of God are more important for our safety and all the the F-15 Fighters and helicopters that this Army has your prayers protect us more than even the natural armies of America praise God Amen so Elisha waited and can you imagine when that mantle started falling you imagine he ran up and he just grabbed that mantle with all he had oh he said praise God I got what I wanted I got the double anointing so he walked over to the stream he took this mantle and he struck the water and he said where's the god of Elijah amen I got his anointing I got his mantle where is the god of Elijah and he struck the waters and the waters moved back oh what a what a a blessing praise God hallelujah and as I was preaching that at cam Church the people were so loud I said I and they're worshiping I said you just worship God I'm done preaching and we had a prayer line and numerous people got healed on that prayer line even even my grandpa my grandpa had diabetes and his leg was numb he come up for prayer this just a couple years before he died he come up for prayer he said after I prayed for him all the numbness left and all the feeling came back in his leg that's Jesus amen and it reminded me of when Solomon dedicated the temple and Moses and Aaron what happened when they dedicated the Tabernacle you remember when they anointed they took the the blood of the the the goats and they anointed all three courts what happened the Holy Ghost fell and the priest couldn't even Minister Hallelujah in other words when the church gets cleaned out when the church is on fire for God hallelujah then then the preachers don't need to preach anymore the people just enjoy the presence of God hallelujah oh my I've only seen it happen a couple times in my 19 years of preaching but it can happen here it can happen anywhere wherever people love God and worship God and preachers got to be longsuffering so we can have that someday by God's grace hallelujah amen thank God Amen thank you Jesus I don't know how I got to there but that's the fifth one that's the fifth doctrine of a devil oh you you you have Grace you can live however you want it's okay if you keep sinting and you keep doing wicked things that's a doctrine of the devil a sixth one is that a lot of preachers say it today it's called the Prosperity Gospel God wants everybody Healthy and Wealthy how many ever heard that one before that's a Doctrine from Hell God doesn't make everybody wealthy I got scripture where the Bible says the Lord makes some poor and some rich right and even healthy Paul cried out three times God heal me heal me what did Jesus say my grace is sufficient for you I'm not going to heal you this time right that was in second Corinthians chapter 12 some people will just the the preacher say well if you're not if you're not healthy it's your own fault and you don't have enough Faith well how do they know that did Paul have not have enough Faith No he had so much Faith he prayed three times and Jesus said no my grace is sufficient for you what about Timothy Timothy had often infirm infirmities in his stomach remember that and what did Paul say well let me just pray for you I'm going to cast that devil out of you no no Paul said drink a little wine for your stomach sake Timothy and your of in infirmities right does everybody hear me God doesn't always want to heal and always make you wealthy and Rich that's not always God's plan but these preachers are lying to the people it's a doctrine of a devil where oh if I'm not healed it's my fault if I'm not rich it's not it's my fault no it's not it might be God's will now sometimes it might be your fault right but sometimes it's God's will if you're sick or you're poor in church don't get me wrong I don't want anybody to be sick I hate being sick but sometimes God allows it in Paul's case to keep him humble or sometimes God will keep you sick for a testimony like the boy or the man who was who was born blind right that the Jesus disciples asked Jesus why is he born blind is it his sin or his parents' sin he said neither it's for the glory of God is everybody with me see so when a preacher says everybody's wealthy everybody should be wealthy it's your fault if you're not wealthy it's your fault if you're not healthy that's a lie each one of us have to seek God for God's will for our lives each one of us got to be like Paul and say Lord Heal Me Lord Heal Me Lord provide for me and even Paul in his last letter what' he tell he told Timothy make sure you bring that coat because it's coming the winter time think about that church Paul had had one coat and it wasn't even in the city where he was at he didn't he didn't have enough money brother Urban like we could we could go to any store and we can buy a coat like that in in this town Paul couldn't do that now was he God's man or not was he was he a prophet of God or not yes he was so apparently God didn't want him wealthy he couldn't even afford a coat we can all go to Walmart or whatever story you guys got here we'll just we we'll go tonight we'll get your car heart brother Daniel right we can do that but Paul wasn't he was so poor he said make sure you bring my parchments my my my my my uh my books and bring my coat because it's coming winter time hallelujah thank the Lord now there's a whole bunch more I'm just going to read a bunch of them now the one we got to battle today is there's a spirit of pride where preachers today and if you haven't seen it I can show you the videos preachers today that believe what we believe they call themselves The Greatest Christians of all time so really they don't believe what we believe that's the same thing the disciples were arguing about who's greater remember Peter and John and James well I'm greater than you and Jesus said why you argu about who's greater you're carnal see that's anytime we exalt ourselves we're the greatest or we're we're something special we're nothing but the only thing we're special is because Jesus saved us praise God that's the only thing that makes me special is that Jesus died for me and he let me receive salvation he gave me the gift of faith Hallelujah I think I'm at an hour now here so I better try to close here yeah I'm just pass an hour here and then some people will say brother Bram was the greatest prophet of all time and we're the greatest Christians of all time but there's no scripture for that there's no scrip scripture for that and even if they were like John the Baptist who is the greatest Old Testament person John the Baptist was the greatest Old Testament isn't that what Jesus said Jesus said no man is born of a woman greater than John so even if someone is the greatest Christian of all time they're not going to say it you got to let Jesus say it amen hallelujah praise God real Christians don't walk around say I'm the greatest ever was I'm no no no no Christians are servants a minister means a servant a preacher I should I'm serving You by preaching the word of God left my family tonight right to preach and labor and sweats running down my back right I'm preaching the word of God I'm bringing you the truth of God's word to serve you praise God hallelujah there's a whole bunch others here the Bible also says let's read 1 Timothy 1 here 1 Timothy 1:9 I want to show you some other doctrines of devils just so you got it in the scripture just so you know where it's at in the scripture you're probably aware of it but it's really wonderful the Bible lists these out these are doctrines of Devils first Timothy verse uh n knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but the for the Lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and the Sinners for Unholy and profane for murderers now notice so here's the first Doctrine now most PE most churches don't teach this but some might we know the U actually we know the Muslims teach this right they can if Muslims kill people when they die in the Jihad they're promised eternal life that's a doctrine of a devil because murder any murder that's acceptable is a doctrine of a devil right that's uh first one in verse n now for murders of fathers and murders of mothers for manslayers verse 10 for wh mongers so these are people that sleep around with all kinds of different people that's that's from hell right that's a doctrine of a devil oh you can sleep and you can you can have as many lovers as you want that's from hell that's a lie for wh mongers for them that defile themselves with mankind that's homosexual for men Stealers now that's from people that rob men for slavery men and women for slavery that's men Stealers so slavery is abomination to God and if there be any other thing that's contrary to sound Doctrine Hallelujah now let me read a couple more here as I close give me five minutes here let me set timer I'll try to close you've been a wonderful audience here tonight it's hard to that was already in hour it's hard to believe that's already an hour I I hardly believe it here's some more doctrines of devils here's a doctorine in the Pentecostal churches say everybody's got to speak in tongues that's that's the doctrine of a devil because Paul said not all speak with tongues second people wear immodest clothing now you guys got good modest clothing but most churches have immodest clothing and that's a doctrine of a devil some Churches allow women preachers that's a doctrine of a devil women are not called to preach God's word mandatory circumcision for righteousness now that's a Jewish thing right but it could it could impact some people you the boys have to be circumcised or you're not saved you're not in Abraham's Covenant that's a doctrine of a devil Paul said um when when Paul I'm sorry when Peter wouldn't eat with the Gentiles he was discriminating because of fear and that's a doctrine of a devil right I'm only going to eat with white people or I'm only going to eat with black people people and I'm going to not eat with white people that's that's a devil causing division because Jesus Christ is the spirit of love and unity praise God hallelujah amen adultery like we said divorcing and remarrying that's a doctrine of a devil we already saw murder putting any evil things before your eyes that's a doctrine of a devil if people allow that right that's Psalms 101:3 David said I will set no Wicked thing before my eyes and 1 Timothy 5 says uh abstain from all appearances of evil praise God praise God uh having a calling God three persons is a doctrine of from Satan because God never said I'm three persons it changes who God is right it's exactly right God never said I'm three persons the Bible said Jesus is the image of God's one person that's what the Bible said in Hebrews 1:3 another one is hair lengths when a man grows his hair that's the doctrine of a devil when a woman cuts her hair that's a doctrine of a devil that's true that's the Bible 1 Corinthians 11 adding books to the Bible is a doctrine of a devil like the Book of Mormon you're adding to God's word God's plagues will be added to them blaspheming or changing God's name is a doctrine of a devil like they call him Holy Trinity that's a Doctrine of a devil God God is not a trinity he's not a trinity of persons he's one God hereo Israel the Lord our God is one Lord amen hallelujah crossdressing is an Abomination women wearing pants is a doctrine of a devil men dressing up like women like they some people do today I saw one yesterday at Target dressing up that's probably the last time I'm going to Target too my goodness I hope it's the last time I got I got to go to Target oh my there's so many more I could keep going on and on but let me give you something here as we close here yeah let's do this let's end with this here go to Deuteronomy 32:2 Deuteronomy 32:2 oh yeah I got one more I got two more verses okay so I'm closing two two two verses Deuteronomy 32:2 brother Daniel can you read that when you got that brother my shall drop as the rain my still as as the amen hallelujah did everybody catch that what did God call his Doctrine this is in the Old Testament what is God's teaching like it's like a rain shower boy we really need rain don't we brother we need both amen we need natural rain and spiritual rain praise God God says when I teach you how to pray when I teach you how to to fast and give arms when I teach you about the church ages amen and the Seven Seals Hallelujah when I teach you all these things it's like you're getting a rain shower for your the the the seed of God in your soul see you're not going to grow right without the rain your soul is not going to grow to love God more unless you get the teaching reign of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen thank God Amen then you can really grow up into God oh brother Jesse came in here brother Irvin or brother Chad they come in here brother brother John they come in here and preach the word and they taught us the word of God and I felt like my soul was being watered oh I walk in here dry but I leave out here with a drink from the Holy Spirit praise God I walk out here saturated hallelujah amen I came in all dry and not really wanting to praise God or hear God's word but I walk out I'm satisfied I feel like God has watered my soul thank God Amen then Jesus says when you're born again sister wi Jesus said it flows up up out of you like a well of Living Water amen hallelujah praise God Amen the holy spirit will just flow up out of you so we get water from heaven and then water flows out of us as well praise God oh my beautiful Glory there's my five minutes so God said when I teach you it's like a rain sh hours Falling and let's pray for rain when we're done here brother we need it too at our place my wife planted all these plants and it hasn't rained much on him so last scripture it's my last one let's stand my last scripture second John go to this The Second Epistle of John towards the end of the New Testament I want you to see how important true Doctrine is sound Doctrine brother Urban brother John whoever is going to be preaching most of the time here true Doctrine is so important I go as far as saying this those people with the true Doctrine are the ones who have the true holy spirit because of this verse right here brother Urban would you read uh verses let's see 9 and 10 brother whoo transgresses and abideth not in the of Christ has not God he that abideth in the doctr of Christ he has both the father and the son if there come any unto you and bring not this do receive him not into your house neither him God speak amen and let's all say it together and the church said what amen so did did did we hear that right Church brother irin and I read this correctly whosoever abideth not in the doctrine or the teaching of Christ does not have God so all these churches that teach these doctrines of devils God is not there right they don't have God but if we abide or live in or dwell in the doctrine the teaching of Christ we have both the father and the son remember the father is invisible Spirit right so we have the invisible Spirit the Holy Spirit and we have the son and Jesus is the high priest amen so we got the Holy Spirit and we got the body of Jesus that makes intercession for us if we teach the right Doctrine and live the right Doctrine Church what else could we ask for we couldn't ask for anything else all we could ask for is to have the right teaching so the Father and Son can minister to all of our needs Hallelujah and the people said amen let's bow our heads for a word of prayer I told you that was my last verse I could preach a couple more hours probably tonight but I don't want to be driving past 1: a.m. tonight my God's grace Hallelujah let's bow our heads for a moment we want to pray for natural rain church but I also want to pray for Spiritual rain that the teaching of the holy spirit will be present in this place that the teaching will always point us to Holiness and not enjoying lust of the flesh like the sinful lust of the flesh it's okay to eat a steak right it's okay to eat chicken it's that that's not the sin I'm talking about of the lust of the flesh I'm talking about adultery fornication like abstaining from meats and priests not marrying you know preachers not marrying that's what I'm talking about and thank God for the true doctrine that we have how many can say thank god let's pray heavenly father I thank you for tonight Lord Jesus it's a wonderful place to be in here Lord where we worship where we can sing where we can praise you God I thank you Lord for tonight hallelujah thank you for the freedom of the Holy Spirit Lord God I'm so encouraged Lord God by Your Word Lord God thank you for these saints that they love you Lord God they'll sit in hear your word they'll sit and sing and praise you they'll stand and give you praise Lord God thank you God that your spirit is in this place Lord thank you God lord I come tonight Lord as a humble servant God I confess all my sins God forgive me of my sinful ways my sinful thoughts when I fall short God forgive me my sins God I want you to hear this prayer and I want the son as the high priest to make inter session Lord God lord I just humbly ask first for Spiritual Reign Lord that teaching can come forth to this congregation Lord God the true teaching sound Doctrine can rain down from heaven and the people will leave out feeling saturated with God's love feeling saturated and refreshed as we know the refreshing feeling of rain in the natural Lord God anoint brother Iran and brother John whoever preaches Lord Brother Chad myself anyone else that would come preach anoint us to preach so the reign of God can fall upon the people's hearts and they'll leave out of here so refreshed so encouraged Lord God Hallelujah to know that you're with them and that you are going to help them grow into mature Christians Lord God lord so I pray for Spiritual Reign Lord God hallelujah above all Lord God we pray for this Reign that we will abide in the doctrine of Christ and we will fulfill the Great Commission where Jesus said go and teach All Nations teach them to observe all things Hallelujah teach us God to observe your word in everything Lord God not because of legalism but because of our love for you Hallelujah bless this people with that spiritual Reign and lastly I think of some of the farmers in here brother John brother irin no doubt some others Lord I think of my wife planting those few little crops we got in our backyard lord it's small it pales in comparison to these brothers who do all these Aces ERS but Lord just thinking of her I have a feeling for her I have a feeling for these Farmers Lord God so Lord Jesus I ask God according to your grace and mercy God if it Be Your Will please send us some natural rain Lord God it may not be on the forecast it doesn't have to be on the forecast Lord God it can be in your forecast dear God man's forecast Lord it can be wrong but Lord I just ask that you would show Mercy Lord God to these Farmers God I don't know you maybe you have some type of a drought plan for this year I don't know what your plans are but Lord I just make my humble request before you Lord God remember these Farmers I pray you'd send abundant rain Lord God for their crops Lord God I ask it Lord I don't know your will I'm making my requests known to you Lord God so I ask for this natural rain along with the spiritual rain Hallelujah Lord as Jesus said I know you hear me always Lord and I
