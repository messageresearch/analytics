[29:11] like to do that at the beginning here
[29:14] and then we'll get into the word
[29:24] everybody happy this afternoon let's
[29:26] praise the lord we gather together again
[29:29] good to see everybody everybody that's
[29:31] able to see on the live stream and
[29:33] everything we're just grateful to
[29:35] hear good reports of the lord giving
[29:37] strength to the ones that were sick and
[29:39] fighting their battles but you know
[29:41] praise the lord the lord is a healer
[29:43] amen and his word never fails and
[29:47] we're certainly thankful for his mercy
[29:49] and his grace to meet us
[29:50] where we have need amen
[29:54] i'm gonna sing this song uh i am
[29:56] resolved no longer to linger
[29:58] amen oh i am resolved
[30:09] [Applause]
[30:12] [Music]
[30:20] my
[30:22] [Music]
[30:34] oh
[30:39] [Music]
[30:48] oh
[30:51] [Music]
[31:02] is
[31:06] [Music]
[31:30] yes
[31:36] [Music]
[31:58] is
[32:02] [Music]
[32:12] oh
[32:14] [Music]
[32:26] oh
[32:28] [Music]
[32:40] maybe
[32:45] [Music]
[32:54] is
[32:56] [Music]
[33:06] [Music]
[33:08] oh
[33:09] [Music]
[33:22] oh
[33:25] [Music]
[33:50] oh
[33:52] [Music]
[34:09] [Music]
[34:18] oh
[34:21] [Music]
[34:31] amen he is the greatest he is the
[34:34] highest
[34:35] amen praise the lord we come to worship
[34:37] him
[34:38] [Music]
[34:39] getting quite a bit of feedback there
[34:40] but i think we'll do all right
[34:42] and uh you know we've come to worship
[34:44] the lord jesus and lift him up
[34:46] he's the only one that we want to give
[34:48] glory to and praise to
[34:50] he's the one that we've come to serve
[34:53] and
[34:53] he's the one we come to hear from this
[34:55] afternoon so we definitely don't want to
[34:57] hear from a man because that wouldn't do
[34:58] us any good anyway perhaps
[35:00] maybe he could benefit you a little bit
[35:01] in the flesh you know maybe teach you
[35:04] something intellectually or whatnot but
[35:05] if
[35:06] if we want to get somewhere with the
[35:08] lord according to the spirit
[35:09] it takes the holy ghost to break the
[35:11] word of life to us and then it takes
[35:13] it takes the one who spoke the word the
[35:15] one who is the word
[35:17] to bring that to us so we're certainly
[35:20] grateful let's all stand
[35:22] and uh we're gonna turn to a couple
[35:24] scriptures we're gonna turn to the one
[35:25] we read last night
[35:26] uh but first we're gonna go to galatians
[35:29] chapter 5
[35:31] and then we're going to turn to hebrews
[35:33] chapter 5 after that
[35:43] now we're going to read verses 16
[35:45] through 18 in galatians chapter 5
[35:48] and then we'll go over to the book of
[35:49] hebrews and we'll read
[35:51] i believe it was 11 through 14
[35:54] and we'll go from there by god's grace
[35:59] so galatians chapter 5 verses 16 through
[36:01] 18
[36:02] says this i say then walk in the spirit
[36:05] and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the
[36:07] flesh
[36:08] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[36:10] and the spirit against the flesh
[36:12] and these are contrary the one to the
[36:14] other so that you cannot do the things
[36:16] that you would
[36:19] but if you be led of the spirit you're
[36:20] not under the law amen
[36:23] praise the lord for that amen let's turn
[36:24] to the book of hebrews
[36:27] chapter 5.
[36:34] where we read verses 11 through 14 we
[36:37] read this
[36:38] uh last evening but the lord kind of had
[36:40] us go in a different direction but we'll
[36:42] see what the lord will have for us
[36:43] the wonderful thing about the word of
[36:45] god is it's always fresh
[36:46] amen it's always timely the lord
[36:50] has what you have need of when you have
[36:53] need of it
[36:54] he supplies our every need amen he is
[36:55] jehovah jireh
[36:57] and so verse 11 through 14 of hebrews
[37:00] chapter 5
[37:01] of whom we have many things to say and
[37:03] hard to be uttered seeing your dull of
[37:05] hearing
[37:06] for when the time you ought to be
[37:07] teachers you give
[37:09] need that one teach you again which be
[37:10] the first principles of the oracles of
[37:12] god
[37:13] and ever become such as have need of
[37:14] milk and that of strong meat
[37:16] for everyone that useth milk is
[37:17] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[37:19] for he is a babe
[37:20] but strong meat belonging to them that
[37:22] are of full age
[37:24] even those who by reason of use have
[37:26] their senses exercised to discern both
[37:28] good
[37:29] and evil amen let's just bow our heads
[37:31] in a word of prayer
[37:32] lord we just thank you for your word
[37:34] this afternoon we thank you for giving
[37:36] us the opportunity lord to have the
[37:37] freedom to come together and worship you
[37:39] in
[37:40] spirit and in truth lord we thank you
[37:42] for revelation in this hour for eyes to
[37:44] see and here's to hear lord and
[37:46] in a heart that desires to serve you
[37:48] lord jesus and
[37:50] we just ask right now that you would
[37:51] come and break the word of life to us
[37:53] again
[37:54] this afternoon maybe just go forth lord
[37:57] and get glory to thy self
[37:58] may you just be lifted up we as we want
[38:01] to lift up the name of
[38:02] jesus christ lord we ask that you would
[38:05] just
[38:06] deliver where there needs deliverance
[38:07] lord heal where
[38:09] healing is needed and lord just edify
[38:12] your people by your word lord we just
[38:13] ask that your perfect will be done
[38:15] be with each and every one that is here
[38:17] and the ones that are
[38:18] listening over the the internet
[38:20] connection lord we just pray that
[38:22] you would be glorified and that your
[38:23] perfect will be done in the name of the
[38:25] lord jesus christ we pray
[38:26] amen and you may be seated
[38:29] so as we're you know we've been kind of
[38:32] speaking on
[38:34] uh the last few services here and
[38:37] and it's just kind of following my lot
[38:39] to
[38:40] and uh to end up speaking all these
[38:44] services as it was but
[38:46] we'll just try to go forward and by the
[38:48] grace of god and
[38:49] know that his perfect you know trust
[38:51] it's his perfect will and
[38:52] we're just trusting in the lord anyhow
[38:54] because it's not about the vessel
[38:58] but it's about the word of the lord and
[38:59] we certainly we believe that word and
[39:02] um i guess uh
[39:06] reading in hebrews chapter 5 verses 11
[39:08] through 14
[39:09] we really want to focus on the last part
[39:11] of that last verse
[39:13] uh it says but strong meat belin belong
[39:15] it to them that are full age
[39:17] even those who by reason of use have
[39:19] their senses exercised to discern both
[39:22] good and evil and
[39:25] we've been talking about in the last few
[39:29] uh
[39:29] evenings just on the idea
[39:33] of that the lord jesus in this hour he
[39:36] wants to express himself through his
[39:38] people
[39:39] he's put within you a portion of himself
[39:42] by the holy ghost
[39:43] and his desire is to push out
[39:47] that expression and express himself
[39:50] through you
[39:51] we understand that there's different
[39:52] attributes to the lord we even we've
[39:54] even i'm sure
[39:55] you've probably i'm sure been taught
[39:56] here and different things understand by
[39:58] the word of the lord
[39:59] you know we talk about the stature of a
[40:00] perfect man and faith virtue knowledge
[40:02] temperance all these different things
[40:04] these virtues and these attributes
[40:06] amongst all the other things of
[40:08] long-suffering and gentleness and
[40:10] meekness and the things that are
[40:11] described as the fruits of the spirit
[40:13] that god desires to manifest through his
[40:15] people
[40:17] and but we find that so many times it
[40:20] seems so difficult
[40:22] to allow these things to to just flow
[40:25] out of the believer
[40:26] and and what we want to speak on this
[40:28] evening is
[40:29] opening the channels so
[40:33] we understand by the message that we've
[40:35] received in this hour
[40:37] that god had placed within each believer
[40:39] a seed
[40:40] a portion of himself that by the word of
[40:43] god he quickened and brought to life
[40:45] you recognized who you were that you
[40:48] were a part of this body of christ
[40:50] you didn't know that you were wandering
[40:52] around in sin we were born and sin
[40:54] shaped in iniquity coming to the world
[40:56] speaking lives
[40:57] we wandered around for so much time you
[40:59] know even if you were born
[41:01] under the umbrella of this word and
[41:03] maybe grew up in it there had to come a
[41:05] time
[41:06] where there was a recognition that
[41:08] without jesus christ without the blood
[41:11] without the holy ghost you were lost
[41:14] that there was that there was
[41:15] there was something that had to be done
[41:17] in your life that god had to turn
[41:20] around and bring to a place of life
[41:22] because without
[41:23] anything outside of that life is death
[41:26] we understand anything outside this word
[41:29] is death
[41:30] just as it was in the garden of eden
[41:31] they didn't even couldn't understand
[41:33] even a
[41:34] concept of death except the fact
[41:37] that the lord said the day you eat
[41:38] thereof that that day you'll die
[41:41] they maybe didn't understand it
[41:42] intellectually but
[41:44] to them there was a simple enough
[41:46] revelation
[41:47] that everything within the word of god
[41:49] is life and everything outside the word
[41:51] of god is death
[41:53] and we understand that truth is becoming
[41:55] more and more
[41:56] prevalent and more and more obvious as
[41:58] we go as we talked about in the last few
[42:00] evenings about that contrast
[42:02] of the light and the darkness and we see
[42:04] that contrast is just becoming greater
[42:06] and greater as the dark and we find as
[42:08] the darkness has gotten darker and
[42:10] darker and darker
[42:12] the light becomes brighter and brighter
[42:14] and brighter
[42:15] see i was actually telling brother simon
[42:17] i texted him and i found out that today
[42:19] although they call it halloween there's
[42:21] also another little holiday that a lot
[42:23] of people don't know about but it's
[42:24] called
[42:25] reformation day they said today is
[42:27] reformation day
[42:29] it's a day that commemorates when martin
[42:31] luther nailed those 95 theses to the
[42:33] wall and said the just shot lit by faith
[42:36] and started that breaking away and
[42:38] coming
[42:39] coming out of her by people just the
[42:41] beginning of that
[42:43] revelation that we see culminated in
[42:45] this hour
[42:46] with a with a restoration of the word
[42:49] and bringing back a fullness of the word
[42:52] so as they're out celebrating their
[42:54] halloween or all these
[42:55] satanic things that they want to do well
[42:57] let's celebrate the fact that
[42:59] this day is a commemoration of god just
[43:02] beginning to draw his people and bring
[43:05] them back out of the darkness that was
[43:07] the catholic church and that nicholaten
[43:10] system
[43:11] and bringing us into a freedom of the
[43:13] word amen
[43:14] so we find that as that darkness has
[43:17] gotten darker and darker and darker
[43:19] that light has become brighter and
[43:21] brighter and brighter what started out
[43:23] with luther
[43:24] goes on to wesley and now at this age by
[43:27] a prophet of william branham comes forth
[43:29] it brings a word
[43:30] and it's just gotten higher and higher
[43:32] and higher
[43:33] and it's what is it doing it's bringing
[43:35] us to a place
[43:36] as we've been speaking to where god can
[43:39] express
[43:40] himself through the bride
[43:43] to stand against all the darkness of the
[43:46] world
[43:47] and it's not about anything that she
[43:48] does in and of herself
[43:50] but it's the very character of god that
[43:52] has the power
[43:54] to stand against the enemy just like it
[43:56] was in the garden of eden we're going
[43:58] back to that place
[43:59] where the only place to be fortified
[44:02] behind is behind that word
[44:04] the only thing that held death at bay
[44:06] from
[44:07] eve and from adam but when eve was
[44:10] tempted
[44:10] with the devil coming and saying you
[44:12] shall not surely die the only thing that
[44:14] fortified her
[44:15] was that word that said if you would
[44:19] stay within this word you'll live but if
[44:22] you go outside that word you'll die
[44:25] and so we find it it's the same way in
[44:27] this day god is desiring
[44:29] to express himself through his people
[44:33] to his people he wants to express
[44:35] himself to you
[44:37] and then as he expresses himself to you
[44:40] his desire is to express himself through
[44:42] you
[44:44] to the world amen as we've been speaking
[44:46] about those things
[44:48] so as when god has come into the
[44:51] believer
[44:53] we talk about it we've talked about it
[44:54] like a seed and it's growing like that
[44:56] little plant
[44:57] and we're watering it and we're we're
[44:59] watering it and watering it and we're
[45:01] feeding it nutrients from the word
[45:03] we talked about that fertilizer and how
[45:05] how the fertilizer it doesn't always
[45:07] smell good
[45:08] you know those trials and tribulations
[45:09] we go through and different things that
[45:11] we go through
[45:12] it doesn't know it doesn't always feel
[45:13] good at the time but we don't understand
[45:16] that the trial of your faith is more
[45:18] precious than gold
[45:19] that if you hold with patience it says
[45:22] we'll reap
[45:22] if we faint not it's it's it may not be
[45:26] though the trials are painful for a
[45:28] season it yields
[45:30] peaceable fruit it yields righteousness
[45:32] it heals holiness
[45:33] those things that are they're on their
[45:35] way that plant may
[45:36] maybe take a long time to it seems a
[45:38] long time to display the fruit sometimes
[45:41] but don't worry even though you can't
[45:42] see it it's growing
[45:44] it's growing and it's growing but what
[45:46] happens is sometimes
[45:48] as god is desiring in you see god
[45:52] sealed you with the holy ghost and now
[45:54] is desiring to take that nature that's
[45:56] in you
[45:57] and push itself out through every part
[46:00] of you
[46:01] he wants a full surrender from his
[46:03] people he wants
[46:04] every every part of you to be completely
[46:07] surrendered he wants a total prisoner
[46:10] for jesus christ in this hour he wants
[46:12] complete surrender
[46:14] just how and we understand jesus himself
[46:17] expressed this
[46:18] in the garden of gethsemane when he even
[46:21] himself expressed
[46:22] his own desire to not suffer the cross
[46:25] and any reasonable logical person would
[46:27] think the same thing
[46:29] knowing what lay ahead of him say lord
[46:31] if there be any other way
[46:33] let me not endure this but what did he
[46:35] say those great words
[46:37] where he gained the victory for you and
[46:38] i he said nevertheless
[46:40] not my will but thy be done so what is
[46:43] it
[46:44] we also have the same cry lord i would
[46:46] so desire
[46:47] maybe not to suffer some of the things
[46:49] i've had to suffer not to go through the
[46:51] trials i had to go through
[46:52] but i say if jesus as the scripture says
[46:55] had to learn obedience
[46:57] through the things he suffered how much
[46:58] for us
[47:01] if the perfect sinless son of god had to
[47:04] come
[47:04] and suffer and and suffer these trials
[47:07] and tribulations
[47:08] and go through these problems and he was
[47:11] perfect
[47:12] how much more us imperfect god trying to
[47:15] build us up in that character
[47:17] how much will we have to go through it
[47:19] but we can have consolation
[47:21] knowing that he's already done the
[47:22] conquering for us
[47:24] so as god is desiring to push out his
[47:27] attributes
[47:28] the whole world is trying to if i can
[47:30] say it this way invade
[47:32] through all these different channels
[47:34] that we have trying to
[47:36] from the inside from the outside in god
[47:38] wants to push from the inside out
[47:41] but satan is trying from the outside to
[47:44] push inwards
[47:45] to see remember he can't stop you
[47:48] because once that feed is planted he
[47:50] says he said
[47:51] who's god has predestinated us
[47:54] to the adoption said he that god has
[47:58] justified
[47:59] he's already glorified amen he's already
[48:02] called you
[48:03] he's already chosen you
[48:06] so now the question is what are we doing
[48:10] to make ourselves available to god to
[48:13] clear out all the channels
[48:14] so that god can work because at that
[48:16] point it comes just as the galatians
[48:18] paul had asked him he says what's
[48:21] hindering you
[48:23] what's hindering you
[48:26] galatians chapter 5
[48:31] he says he says this i say that walk in
[48:34] the spirit you shall not fulfill the
[48:35] lust of the flesh
[48:37] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[48:40] and the spirit against the flesh and
[48:41] these are contrary ones to another so
[48:42] that you cannot do the things
[48:44] that ye would so be
[48:48] the desire of the christian to live
[48:50] completely
[48:52] set aside to god and yet there's this
[48:54] battle going on
[48:57] satan in all the things he puts out
[48:59] there
[49:00] even if you could separate yourself from
[49:03] civilization
[49:04] satan's gonna still be right there to
[49:07] drop his try to drop his little
[49:08] inspirations
[49:09] trying to put his little thoughts in
[49:11] there trying to work through every
[49:13] little channel that he can
[49:14] and we understand by the grace of god
[49:16] that there are 10
[49:18] channels through the prophecy told us
[49:21] there's 10 different channels five into
[49:22] the flesh
[49:23] five into the spirit and then there's
[49:25] one channel into the soul
[49:28] and the five of the flesh we understand
[49:29] see taste feel smell in here
[49:32] and then to the spirit conscious memory
[49:34] reasoning affection imaginations
[49:37] and then to that soul there's only two
[49:40] possibilities there's faith
[49:41] and there's doubt and the only way in
[49:44] there
[49:45] is through your free moral agency it's
[49:46] for your free will you make the decision
[49:50] to either believe the word of god or to
[49:52] doubt the word of god
[49:53] and by the grace of god us being here
[49:55] this evening
[49:56] i trust we've all made that choice that
[49:59] we believe the word of god
[50:01] god comes and seals that in so there's
[50:03] nothing there's nothing to do
[50:05] there that's a finished work on its way
[50:08] so now what happens is god desiring to
[50:11] express
[50:12] through you what will happen so many
[50:14] times as we get gummed up in all these
[50:16] other channels
[50:17] and brother branham in the greatest
[50:19] battle ever fought he talks about how
[50:21] it's just like a little stalk of corn
[50:24] growing
[50:24] it starts out growing but if there's
[50:27] something there blocking it
[50:29] it can grow deform just how a tree
[50:32] if it's got like a brick or something
[50:33] laying near it and it's trying to grow
[50:35] straight
[50:36] that brick would push it off to the side
[50:38] or some stone
[50:39] why because there's something blocking
[50:41] the channel
[50:42] where whereby that tree can grow
[50:45] properly
[50:46] it doesn't stop the tree from growing
[50:48] but it does try to hinder
[50:50] it tries to pervert it it tries to make
[50:52] it less fruitful it tries to steer it
[50:54] from the straight path
[50:57] and so this evening we just want to talk
[50:58] about we're just going to overview a lot
[51:00] of these
[51:01] and i just trust it's a blessing to you
[51:02] but we just maybe go through some of
[51:04] these different channels
[51:06] so one of the very big channels that we
[51:08] have in this day
[51:09] starting with the flesh side is sight
[51:13] oh my doesn't the world love to work by
[51:15] sight
[51:16] how the devil everything out there it's
[51:19] working by sight
[51:20] throwing the televisions and when we
[51:22] finally decided we got enough sense to
[51:24] get the televisions out of the house
[51:26] he put one in your pocket right here
[51:29] put a television in your pocket let you
[51:31] access it wherever you want
[51:33] do whatever you want and what does he do
[51:35] he throws
[51:36] all the wickedness and different things
[51:38] at you but see
[51:40] though in matthew 6 22 the lord says the
[51:43] light of the body is the eye
[51:45] if therefore that i be single that whole
[51:47] body shall be full of light
[51:49] but if then i be evil thy whole body's
[51:51] body shall be full of darkness
[51:53] if therefore the light that is in me be
[51:55] darkness how great is that darkness
[51:58] no man can serve two masters for either
[52:00] he will hate the one
[52:01] and love the other else he will hold to
[52:03] the one and despise the other
[52:05] you cannot serve god and man
[52:08] how important that is so much so now the
[52:11] lord says
[52:12] if if that light that goes into the eye
[52:16] it's darkness it says thy whole body
[52:18] would be darkness
[52:19] and that you know they have a worldly
[52:21] saying what they call the eyes or the
[52:23] window to the soul
[52:25] and to a certain extent that's true
[52:27] because we take in so many things
[52:29] visually
[52:29] and it affects you in the spirit and so
[52:32] many times
[52:33] to all the wickedness that's out there
[52:35] just the devil is just throwing it to us
[52:37] day after day after day
[52:39] but david said i'm not going to set any
[52:41] wicked thing before my eyes
[52:42] amen the scripture says he says to take
[52:45] the word
[52:46] of god and bind it as fretless before
[52:48] your eyes
[52:49] he says i want the word of god before me
[52:51] all the time
[52:52] every second of every day we need to
[52:55] keep ourselves
[52:56] these are one of the greatest channels
[52:59] that is so easy to get mixed up
[53:01] because as we'll see all these things
[53:05] that the devil is constantly bombarding
[53:07] and bombarding and bombarding
[53:09] every day you go out and you see women
[53:11] dressed wickedly
[53:12] men doing whatever they're doing
[53:14] nowadays you know
[53:15] with the piercings and the tattoos and
[53:17] all all these visual things
[53:19] that that it just wicked this put before
[53:21] your eyes
[53:22] and if we're not careful and this goes
[53:24] for every one of these senses that we're
[53:26] going to talk about
[53:28] if we're not careful we become
[53:30] desensitized to it
[53:33] it's just like if you look at the sun
[53:34] for too long
[53:36] all of a sudden you can't see you'll see
[53:37] spots
[53:39] or if it's just like how they talk about
[53:42] how deep in the ocean
[53:43] there's fish and animals down there that
[53:46] have been down there so long
[53:48] in the darkness that they don't even
[53:50] their eyes don't work anymore
[53:53] and if we're not careful it happens to
[53:56] us when
[53:57] our eyes we could become desensitized
[54:00] and this will go for all these different
[54:02] senses
[54:03] but you let that one crude thing come
[54:06] across your computer
[54:09] you let that one time happen and you say
[54:11] oh lord
[54:12] you get away from it but if you let it
[54:14] keep going
[54:15] pretty soon it starts to desensitize
[54:18] desensitize
[54:19] desensitize just anything that gets hit
[54:22] enough
[54:23] it'll desensitize it just more and more
[54:25] and more and the devil's not going to
[54:27] stop
[54:27] so we need to be very careful about what
[54:31] we're putting before our eyes
[54:33] the bible says it says do not turn to
[54:35] the left or to the right
[54:37] don't even look upon the scripture says
[54:39] about even the wine
[54:41] it says don't even look on the wine when
[54:42] it's red
[54:44] you know we got to be so careful because
[54:46] sin is going to look
[54:48] appealing remember that that serpent in
[54:51] the garden
[54:52] was more handsome even even than adam
[54:57] looked great and powerful and strong and
[55:00] no doubt handsome and who knows
[55:02] but it looked nice it looked good to the
[55:05] flesh
[55:07] but we need as we talked about in
[55:08] hebrews there we need to have our senses
[55:11] exercised to discern good and evil
[55:15] we need to have our senses we and what
[55:18] does it say it says by reason of use
[55:20] it means that we've been using these
[55:21] senses use the spiritual eyesight of the
[55:24] word
[55:25] to help you discern what's wicked and
[55:28] what's not
[55:29] and so many times we just run right over
[55:31] and something looks a little off
[55:33] you know i'm just still talking a little
[55:34] bit about sight but this goes for
[55:36] everything something
[55:37] looks a little off and we'll just push
[55:39] it to the back of our mind well no i
[55:40] don't want to offend or
[55:41] no i don't want to do this but remember
[55:43] what brother branham said if there's a
[55:45] question about it leave it alone
[55:48] i'd rather i'd rather offend in the
[55:51] natural
[55:52] i'd rather offended the natural but have
[55:55] peace with god
[55:57] than to try to appease the people
[56:00] or appease just some little temp
[56:03] temporary desire of the flesh
[56:05] and find myself wanting at the end
[56:10] first thessalonians 5 22 says to abstain
[56:14] from every appearance of evil
[56:18] now that's that's something to
[56:19] definitely talk about on a day like
[56:20] today like halloween
[56:22] where you know even even when i was
[56:25] growing up
[56:26] in the church you know it used to be
[56:29] most of the churches the church i went
[56:31] to at least
[56:32] didn't at least actively seem to
[56:34] celebrate halloween
[56:36] we had like what we called a harvest
[56:37] party or something they did something
[56:39] at a similar time just to get together
[56:41] and i think brother jesse and
[56:43] listening would remember those when we
[56:44] were at the church back there in delta
[56:47] how they would do little harvest parties
[56:48] and stuff to try to at least get the
[56:50] children away from that and
[56:51] that was certainly a noble thing because
[56:53] even now i see so many
[56:55] what we say they claim to be christians
[56:58] and yet would let their children go out
[57:00] on such an obviously demonic day
[57:03] at night i mean it's bad enough
[57:07] that they do everything at night we know
[57:10] that they do things under the cover of
[57:11] darkness because they don't want things
[57:13] revealed by the light
[57:15] you know but we're children of the day
[57:17] by the grace of god amen
[57:19] so what so we're looking we want to even
[57:21] stay away from every appearance of evil
[57:24] oh brother that sounds like it's getting
[57:25] to legalism no it's not about
[57:27] that i'm see legal see we often times as
[57:30] we were talking about works
[57:31] we need to separate works as
[57:34] working for the lord as opposed to
[57:37] trying to
[57:38] salvation by works see i want to live my
[57:42] life
[57:42] and do the works of god because i love
[57:44] him not because i think it'll save me
[57:47] i want to do the works of god because
[57:50] he's changed my life
[57:52] he's shown me the truth of his word and
[57:54] my desire
[57:56] is to to live that close to him to be
[57:58] pleasing to him
[58:00] so i want to abstain from the appearance
[58:02] of evil even if someone else might say
[58:04] oh well you don't need to go that far
[58:05] that's fine
[58:06] you don't have to go that far but i want
[58:08] to go that far
[58:13] so we talk about sight that's everywhere
[58:15] now
[58:16] we're visual creatures everything you go
[58:18] and even even
[58:20] in so much as like even the television
[58:22] programs and things that
[58:23] i remember and this is just my own
[58:24] personal i don't know there's probably
[58:25] scientific stuff about it too i'm sure
[58:29] but i even thought it affects people
[58:30] even in the physical
[58:32] and so much that they wonder why they
[58:35] wonder why the children
[58:37] they say all the children now basically
[58:38] all of them have adhd and all these
[58:40] different things
[58:40] well it's no wonder if you see any
[58:43] children's
[58:44] things so-called children's programs or
[58:46] anything it's just one thing after
[58:47] another and constantly moving and
[58:49] this and that and it's over stimulating
[58:51] desensitizing to the
[58:53] to the children so where they've been so
[58:55] desensitized
[58:56] even if they bring them into the church
[58:58] to hear something like this that isn't
[59:00] as exciting and
[59:01] it isn't flashing and moving and dynamic
[59:04] as that television program they couldn't
[59:06] even sit still and hear the word of god
[59:08] even if they wanted to
[59:09] because they're so used to being
[59:10] stimulated according to the flesh
[59:13] oh we need to be so careful you got to
[59:15] be careful what you're showing your
[59:16] children
[59:17] you got to be careful what you're
[59:18] showing yourself
[59:22] amen and just as much as that we taught
[59:25] we've been talking about the sisters in
[59:26] their dress
[59:26] but that's even a visual a sight
[59:29] representation of
[59:30] what the work that god's done you know
[59:32] so we see
[59:33] god can work by sight see all of these
[59:36] senses
[59:37] are good if they be lined up with the
[59:39] word of god
[59:40] amen all these things are good as long
[59:44] as we can line them up with the word of
[59:45] god
[59:46] so second let's talk about
[59:50] the feeling now this is another big one
[59:53] that we have
[59:55] because everybody wants to feel
[59:56] something everybody wants to have a
[59:58] feeling and
[59:59] oh i've got to have this sensation i've
[1:00:01] got to have i've got to have this
[1:00:03] this this feeling manifestation
[1:00:06] otherwise
[1:00:06] nothing happened between me and god
[1:00:12] but see if i can say it this way
[1:00:16] oh you know people say oh i wanna i
[1:00:18] wanna i wanna feel the presence of god
[1:00:20] oh that's wonderful i do too but you
[1:00:22] can't go just by feelings
[1:00:26] say oh i felt goosebumps i know the lord
[1:00:28] is here that that may be true
[1:00:30] i'm not disregarding that i've felt the
[1:00:32] presence of the lord and
[1:00:33] in that and had goosebumps i said you
[1:00:36] knew the lord was there
[1:00:37] you could feel the the solemn atmosphere
[1:00:39] of the lord and the holy spirit just
[1:00:41] moving across the people
[1:00:42] but i tell you what i've had goosebumps
[1:00:44] listening to worldly music too
[1:00:47] so if you're basing everything on your
[1:00:49] feelings
[1:00:50] oh well we got to be so careful because
[1:00:53] feelings
[1:00:54] it's such a the whole world is so it
[1:00:56] says that the
[1:00:57] that carnal man is sensual that means
[1:01:00] they live
[1:01:00] by everything that's feeling and
[1:01:02] everything that they can feel
[1:01:04] and and that's that's exactly how
[1:01:06] they're living in this day
[1:01:07] the world's gospel now is if it feels
[1:01:10] good to you that's what you should do
[1:01:14] but i tell you when you like paul said
[1:01:17] he said when i became a man
[1:01:19] i put away childish things it's a child
[1:01:23] that won't clean their room because they
[1:01:25] don't feel like it
[1:01:26] but an adult will look at a situation
[1:01:29] overcome a feeling
[1:01:31] because i don't enjoy always cleaning my
[1:01:32] room or doing the dishes or
[1:01:34] working on the house but you put away
[1:01:37] feelings
[1:01:38] and you work with what you know to be
[1:01:40] right
[1:01:42] and if we're not now don't get me wrong
[1:01:44] again as long as they line up with the
[1:01:46] words your feelings are great
[1:01:49] many times i don't feel like going to
[1:01:51] work
[1:01:52] but i go because i have a family to
[1:01:54] provide for
[1:01:56] i have a job that i need to do and
[1:01:59] sometimes
[1:01:59] your physical nature doesn't feel like
[1:02:02] going to church
[1:02:03] because you're tired and you're weary
[1:02:05] and it's uh maybe it's
[1:02:06] for i know for our brother here it's a
[1:02:08] journey to get here
[1:02:10] but you know what by the grace of god
[1:02:12] brother you guys overcome feelings
[1:02:14] you overcome weariness you overcome
[1:02:16] these things and you press forward
[1:02:18] amen why because it's a sign of maturity
[1:02:22] when a person can push aside feelings to
[1:02:25] do what they know to be right
[1:02:28] because your nature someone offends you
[1:02:31] you don't
[1:02:32] feel like loving them at that moment
[1:02:35] in the flesh it's just the truth
[1:02:38] because the flesh is enmity with god
[1:02:42] we all want to act like the devil isn't
[1:02:45] only
[1:02:45] we all want to act as if you know
[1:02:47] there's never any temptation
[1:02:50] no we know that the temptation is there
[1:02:53] someone said something to you at work
[1:02:55] that hit you the wrong way and and the
[1:02:57] devil's right there to be dropping
[1:02:59] those little wicked thoughts in there of
[1:03:01] malice and strife
[1:03:04] but the child of god can take those
[1:03:06] feelings and say devil get out of here
[1:03:09] push aside feeling and go with the word
[1:03:13] and say yeah i'm gonna have perfect love
[1:03:16] i'm going to say
[1:03:17] love overc it covers up a multitude of
[1:03:20] sins
[1:03:21] amen love will make you pray for that
[1:03:25] person you know
[1:03:28] but we got to be so careful you know the
[1:03:31] scripture says
[1:03:32] in uh second corinthians 6 17 let's just
[1:03:34] read that
[1:03:36] probably do a few scriptures this
[1:03:37] evening if that's all right
[1:03:44] were talking about seeing
[1:03:49] and that's the first thing you do before
[1:03:52] you
[1:03:53] usually touch something is you have to
[1:03:55] see it first
[1:03:58] so just like eve she saw something that
[1:04:00] she went for it
[1:04:03] so we have to be careful if the
[1:04:04] scripture says here in
[1:04:06] the second corinthians 6 verse 17 says
[1:04:11] let's just read verse 16 and what
[1:04:12] agreement hath the temple of god with
[1:04:14] idols
[1:04:15] for ye are the temple of the living god
[1:04:17] as god hath said i will dwell in them
[1:04:19] and walk in them
[1:04:20] and will be their god and they shall be
[1:04:21] my people wherefore come out from among
[1:04:24] them and be
[1:04:25] separate saith the lord touch not the
[1:04:27] unclean thing
[1:04:29] and i will receive you and will be a
[1:04:31] father unto you and ye shall be my sons
[1:04:33] and daughters
[1:04:34] saith the lord almighty so
[1:04:38] don't even touch it don't even touch it
[1:04:41] and if i could even go to a spiritual
[1:04:43] aspect of it
[1:04:45] you know in the old testament when they
[1:04:47] came to the mount mount sinai
[1:04:49] the lord told them said don't even
[1:04:51] approach the mountain or even touch it
[1:04:53] or you'll be thrust through with a dart
[1:04:55] and as we've been talking as we spoke
[1:04:57] yesterday about
[1:04:58] finding your place it could be very
[1:05:01] dangerous
[1:05:02] to touch something that the lord has
[1:05:04] told you don't touch it
[1:05:07] a sister's with the ministry lord the
[1:05:10] lord said
[1:05:11] i suffered not a woman to preach or serp
[1:05:13] authority in the word
[1:05:15] don't even touch it what happened to the
[1:05:17] one
[1:05:18] that that went to touch the ark when it
[1:05:21] was on the cart
[1:05:22] when they weren't supposed to see it
[1:05:25] even goes for the things of god we need
[1:05:26] to be so careful
[1:05:28] to be able to discern right from wrong
[1:05:31] to be able to discern where we're at and
[1:05:33] who we're supposed to be
[1:05:35] if someone were to come in here and try
[1:05:37] to start usurping authority over brother
[1:05:39] jesse
[1:05:40] i i pray that the lord would have mercy
[1:05:43] on that person
[1:05:44] and that's not lifting up further jesse
[1:05:45] i'm just using it as an example because
[1:05:47] we're here but
[1:05:47] but you think about a a person that
[1:05:49] would come in and try to
[1:05:51] pull that nicholaten spirit and try to
[1:05:53] usurp something and what are they doing
[1:05:55] they're trying to put their hands upon
[1:05:58] something that's not theirs don't even
[1:06:01] put your hand to it
[1:06:03] doesn't the scripture say touch not mine
[1:06:05] anointed
[1:06:06] they do my prophets no harm oh we want
[1:06:09] to put that up there in lofty place just
[1:06:11] for the prophets no
[1:06:12] that's for the people of god you are the
[1:06:14] anointed
[1:06:16] for this hour amen yeah there may be
[1:06:19] false anointed ones there's true
[1:06:20] anointed ones right here that i'm
[1:06:21] looking at
[1:06:22] there's two anointed ones that are
[1:06:24] watching on a screen right now
[1:06:25] that god has declared don't touch that
[1:06:28] anointed
[1:06:29] amen so be careful how you treat one
[1:06:32] another
[1:06:34] i better be careful the way i talk about
[1:06:36] my brother amen here because
[1:06:38] he's anointed he's been placed here by
[1:06:41] god he's a child of god
[1:06:44] and i won't touch that amen so
[1:06:48] we got to be very careful touch it's one
[1:06:50] of those things
[1:06:51] and that's what if you find what a blind
[1:06:53] man
[1:06:55] a blind man what what's one of the sim
[1:06:57] what's one of the symptoms you're going
[1:06:58] to find
[1:06:59] of a blind person how do they go through
[1:07:01] life they go through life with feelings
[1:07:04] they're trying to feel their way through
[1:07:07] oh well
[1:07:08] i can't i can't see it so i'll just see
[1:07:10] how i feel about it
[1:07:12] no thank the lord for i said that we can
[1:07:14] see amen we're not children of the
[1:07:16] darkness but we're
[1:07:17] children of the day amen even though
[1:07:19] it's gross darkness
[1:07:20] light shining in goshen right now we can
[1:07:22] see our way
[1:07:24] lord said he said if you are in the
[1:07:25] light as i am in the light that's where
[1:07:28] we need to be
[1:07:29] we need to be in the light as he is in
[1:07:31] the light amen
[1:07:32] just like the children of israel in the
[1:07:34] wilderness wherever that pillar of fire
[1:07:35] went
[1:07:36] they had to go otherwise it was going to
[1:07:38] be darkness
[1:07:39] they better be following that pill or a
[1:07:41] fire the same with us
[1:07:43] we're following those bloody footprints
[1:07:45] we're following the light of the hour
[1:07:47] as god lights the way through this dark
[1:07:49] age and we're not feeling our way as
[1:07:51] blind man
[1:07:55] so if you find that everything decisions
[1:07:57] of your life
[1:07:58] are just based on your feelings you
[1:08:00] might want to get some isaf
[1:08:03] but he's offered it in this hour isn't
[1:08:05] that right laodicea said
[1:08:06] he's he brought out the eye salve for
[1:08:08] this hour
[1:08:10] amen amen so
[1:08:13] we'll move on to the next one here well
[1:08:15] i guess i'll just give you another
[1:08:16] scripture here
[1:08:17] also in james chapter 1 verse 27.
[1:08:21] i guess let's just turn there and read
[1:08:23] it we like to read the word of god
[1:08:35] james chapter 1 and verse 27
[1:08:41] pure religion and then defiled before
[1:08:42] god and the father is this to visit the
[1:08:44] fatherless
[1:08:45] and widows in their affliction and to
[1:08:47] keep himself
[1:08:48] unspotted from the world
[1:08:51] what are we doing we're trying to keep
[1:08:53] our robes clean amen
[1:08:55] we have white robes the lord has clothed
[1:08:56] us in that that
[1:08:58] white raiment the righteousness of the
[1:09:00] saints
[1:09:01] what is his righteousness that he's
[1:09:02] given to us right
[1:09:05] what's the one thing about a white
[1:09:06] garment that we all know even if you
[1:09:08] just brush up against
[1:09:10] just a little brush up against something
[1:09:11] dirty you're gonna see it
[1:09:14] and many times we get a little dirty
[1:09:17] because we're brushing up a little too
[1:09:18] close with worldly things but no doubt
[1:09:20] you know there's there's portions of it
[1:09:23] we have to understand that it's a battle
[1:09:24] it's a war
[1:09:26] you know uh us different ones that have
[1:09:28] to work we go out and we rub shoulders
[1:09:30] with the world every day
[1:09:32] but just because you rub shoulders
[1:09:33] naturally doesn't mean you have to do it
[1:09:35] spiritually
[1:09:36] you have an atmosphere that you can
[1:09:38] create god has made you a little creator
[1:09:40] create that atmosphere let that holy
[1:09:43] bubble
[1:09:43] that holy bale be over you so that even
[1:09:46] if you rub
[1:09:47] shoulders with the world when you come
[1:09:48] back at the end of the day you're just
[1:09:50] white as snow you're just as clean as
[1:09:53] you were
[1:09:54] the first the day you got saved but you
[1:09:56] know what even if
[1:09:57] you know the devil tries to get
[1:09:58] something yeah you touch something
[1:10:00] spiritually you weren't supposed to
[1:10:02] touch
[1:10:02] there's a fountain that's there's a
[1:10:04] fountain opened in the house of david
[1:10:06] there's there's a there's a blood that
[1:10:08] can cleanse that amen
[1:10:10] we thank the lord for his forgiveness
[1:10:12] and his grace
[1:10:14] amen smell here's another one another
[1:10:16] smell
[1:10:17] smell is a powerful sense it's a very
[1:10:20] powerful sense
[1:10:22] you know god called the sacrifices
[1:10:26] he wants it to be a sweet smelling savor
[1:10:28] unto himself
[1:10:29] it's a it's a pleasant thing you know if
[1:10:32] you
[1:10:32] smell is one of the very first signs
[1:10:36] that you could tell if you're in a good
[1:10:38] atmosphere or a bad atmosphere
[1:10:42] you say how do you say that well i tell
[1:10:44] you what if something's rotten
[1:10:46] in the house you ever had something
[1:10:48] rotten in the fridge
[1:10:49] and you open the fridge you're going to
[1:10:51] tailbone right away because you're going
[1:10:52] to smell it
[1:10:54] there's something there's something
[1:10:55] wrong in this atmosphere there's
[1:10:56] something there's death
[1:10:58] in the camp there's death in the pot
[1:11:03] also smell has a way of
[1:11:07] attaching itself to a person i remember
[1:11:09] when i was a child
[1:11:10] my parents used to be in a bowling
[1:11:12] league way back when when they still had
[1:11:13] those
[1:11:14] i'm sure they may still have them i
[1:11:16] don't know and and that was before all
[1:11:18] the smoking bans and all these different
[1:11:20] things
[1:11:22] and i used to hate it i didn't mind
[1:11:25] the bowling part i mean just throwing
[1:11:27] pit ball at some pins but
[1:11:29] they still allow the smoking in there
[1:11:31] and all the people seem to smoke and
[1:11:32] they're just an atmosphere about it is
[1:11:34] when you got home you knew
[1:11:36] you had been to the bowling alley
[1:11:37] because that smell of smoke and that
[1:11:39] atmosphere had clung to you
[1:11:42] so many i wonder sometimes if maybe some
[1:11:45] we're maybe not a stench
[1:11:46] to god sometimes by the atmosphere that
[1:11:48] we've allowed to come around ourselves
[1:11:51] and that we allowed to live in
[1:11:53] god wants us to stay in a holy
[1:11:55] atmosphere
[1:11:57] if we look at the book of esther when
[1:11:59] before she could go into the king
[1:12:01] the scripture said she had to go six
[1:12:03] months of purification
[1:12:04] with sweet smelling odors and oils
[1:12:08] why because she had to smell a certain
[1:12:10] way when they went into the temple
[1:12:13] into the holy place into the holy of
[1:12:15] holies they had
[1:12:17] they had a very special ointment that
[1:12:19] was made of a very specific concoction
[1:12:23] a very specific bit of ingredients that
[1:12:26] smelled a certain way
[1:12:28] when they that they had to go in
[1:12:30] smelling that way
[1:12:31] there had to be an anointing about them
[1:12:35] there had to be a smell that pleased god
[1:12:39] and what is it now it's our lives it's
[1:12:42] our prayers
[1:12:42] it's our worship that we want to send up
[1:12:45] to god of a pure heart
[1:12:46] to be a sweet-smelling savor to him
[1:12:51] but if we're out there rubbing shoulders
[1:12:54] with the world
[1:12:56] and and cozying up to the things of the
[1:12:59] world
[1:13:00] that smell will get on you that smell
[1:13:03] will get on you
[1:13:04] you don't know it but it'll be on you
[1:13:06] all of a sudden you start to get that
[1:13:08] prickly nature
[1:13:09] you don't even know but people people
[1:13:12] notice
[1:13:13] your atmosphere
[1:13:19] we have to be very careful about it
[1:13:23] in the scripture the lord said that your
[1:13:25] solemn feasts and your assemblies have
[1:13:27] become a stench in my nostrils
[1:13:29] what was it what did they lost they had
[1:13:31] lost the sincerity of it
[1:13:33] they had lost the meaning of it it used
[1:13:35] to mean something
[1:13:37] but now it was just a ritual we go to
[1:13:39] church just because that's what we do
[1:13:43] and many times we have to be very
[1:13:45] careful of that
[1:13:47] because it becomes a routine we don't
[1:13:50] want anything to ever
[1:13:51] become routine about our relationship
[1:13:53] with the lord jesus
[1:13:56] we don't want it to become a stench
[1:13:58] death is definitely
[1:14:00] a big stench you know if you remember
[1:14:04] when they were getting ready at the
[1:14:06] grave of lazarus at the tomb of lazarus
[1:14:08] he said roll away the stone they said oh
[1:14:10] lord
[1:14:11] it's been four days by now he's stinking
[1:14:14] what was it they knew
[1:14:16] that a stench of death was there but
[1:14:18] what do we find
[1:14:19] is that it may have been the case they
[1:14:21] may have wrote the stone away and people
[1:14:22] passed out from the smell
[1:14:25] you ever been to a hospital there's a
[1:14:28] certain smell
[1:14:29] it's a smell of death it's that smell of
[1:14:33] that atmosphere
[1:14:34] that's there but there's there's one
[1:14:36] thing that can cure that and that's the
[1:14:38] word of god
[1:14:39] amen because jesus said i am the
[1:14:41] resurrection in the life
[1:14:42] he said your brother shall live again
[1:14:46] amen so he says lazarus come forth all
[1:14:49] of a sudden
[1:14:49] the stink's gone life comes the word is
[1:14:53] the cure
[1:14:54] the word's always the cure amen
[1:14:59] even fire and brimstone has a very
[1:15:01] particular smell doesn't it
[1:15:03] if you ever smelled you ever smelled
[1:15:05] sulfur that egg water
[1:15:08] they call it egg water that's like some
[1:15:09] of the sulfur and the different
[1:15:11] minerals that are in that water yeah you
[1:15:12] can smell that fire has a certain smell
[1:15:15] oh but i love it the three hebrew boys
[1:15:17] went into the furnace but when they came
[1:15:19] out
[1:15:19] the smell of fire wasn't even on that's
[1:15:22] how it is for the bride
[1:15:23] that's how it is for the people of god
[1:15:25] yeah you go out to the world
[1:15:26] brothers sisters they have to work you
[1:15:28] go out there into the world and you have
[1:15:29] to work and deal with all the people and
[1:15:31] their attitudes and
[1:15:32] their cursing and their their dirty
[1:15:34] jokes and their stories and all the
[1:15:36] things that they do
[1:15:37] but i tell you what you keep yourself
[1:15:39] underneath the word of god and you'll
[1:15:40] come out of that and not even the smell
[1:15:42] of it'll be on you
[1:15:44] yes lord he can do that why because
[1:15:47] he's the god that that his angels in
[1:15:49] camp about is
[1:15:50] them that fear him they'll keep that off
[1:15:53] here the only thing
[1:15:54] that happened to them was the bounds the
[1:15:56] vines were broken they were free
[1:15:58] amen let's move on i don't we probably
[1:16:00] go forever you could go so long on any
[1:16:02] one of these
[1:16:03] but we just want to do a quick overview
[1:16:05] so hearing
[1:16:08] so we understand the scripture says
[1:16:10] faith cometh by hearing
[1:16:11] and hearing by the word of god god
[1:16:15] as we were talking about god chose the
[1:16:17] foolishness of preaching
[1:16:18] to save them that are lost why because
[1:16:20] of this scripture he said faith comes by
[1:16:22] hearing
[1:16:23] and hearing the word of god so those you
[1:16:26] hear the word
[1:16:27] and you receive
[1:16:30] we have to be careful what we're
[1:16:31] listening to what kind of music are we
[1:16:34] listening to
[1:16:35] what kind of what kind of stories and
[1:16:37] stories
[1:16:38] i could say testimonies let's put it
[1:16:40] that way testimonies are we listening to
[1:16:42] are you are you listen because
[1:16:43] everything's got a testimony
[1:16:45] everybody's got a testimony the world's
[1:16:48] got their testimony of fear
[1:16:50] and doubt and anger and frustration
[1:16:54] and absolute hopelessness are you going
[1:16:57] to listen to that testimony
[1:16:59] are you going to hear the testimony just
[1:17:02] like rahab
[1:17:03] what wasn't she it was in jericho and
[1:17:05] she said she received the spies
[1:17:07] and she said we've heard of what god did
[1:17:10] over there in egypt
[1:17:12] we heard the testimony of how god
[1:17:14] delivered and part of the red sea
[1:17:16] and has defeated every enemy along the
[1:17:18] way
[1:17:19] and what did she do she heard it and she
[1:17:22] received it
[1:17:24] but if we're not careful our ears get
[1:17:26] stopped up
[1:17:28] you ever had an ear infection i used to
[1:17:30] get them all the time when i was a child
[1:17:32] i had them so much i had to get tubes in
[1:17:33] my ears about like six times
[1:17:36] that was not pleasant but you get an ear
[1:17:39] infection
[1:17:40] you can't hear correctly you get stopped
[1:17:43] up all the fluid in your ear
[1:17:44] gets stuffed up you can't hear it gets
[1:17:46] muffled
[1:17:48] that hap you know that happens in battle
[1:17:49] a lot the concussion from the grenades
[1:17:52] and
[1:17:53] and shooting the rifles and all of a
[1:17:54] sudden they get tinnitus that ring in
[1:17:56] the ears
[1:17:58] there's a lot of soldiers sometimes we
[1:18:00] get that ringing in the ears we've been
[1:18:01] fighting for trying to serve the lord
[1:18:04] and the devil is always right there in
[1:18:06] your ear doing these things you're
[1:18:08] fighting the battles fighting the badger
[1:18:09] on the front line
[1:18:10] and it becomes harder sometimes to hear
[1:18:12] the word of god and
[1:18:14] and take it for yourself
[1:18:18] but god's got god's got healing for that
[1:18:22] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:18:25] the word of god we need to be careful
[1:18:26] because
[1:18:27] if we're not careful what if you
[1:18:29] wouldn't hear
[1:18:30] if you wouldn't hear the jubilee call
[1:18:34] and you said well i'm just content to
[1:18:36] remain
[1:18:37] they heard but they they didn't listen
[1:18:41] they didn't receive it the scripture
[1:18:44] says
[1:18:44] that the hearing of the word wasn't
[1:18:47] mixed with faith
[1:18:48] and then that heard it so we need to be
[1:18:50] careful that
[1:18:51] that this word that's being preached
[1:18:54] isn't just
[1:18:55] going as we say in one ear and out the
[1:18:57] other
[1:18:58] that that we receive it that we're
[1:19:00] receptive to the word
[1:19:03] because there's a difference between
[1:19:05] just hearing something
[1:19:07] and truly hearing or listening as we say
[1:19:10] there's a difference between hearing and
[1:19:12] listening
[1:19:14] i work in a job as an air traffic
[1:19:16] controller where that's really all i do
[1:19:18] is i'm supposed to listen
[1:19:20] and i'm talking and and that's what they
[1:19:22] tell us a lot is
[1:19:23] you a lot of times you have to be
[1:19:24] careful because when i give an aircraft
[1:19:26] an instruction
[1:19:28] i have to hear him say it back they're
[1:19:30] legally required
[1:19:31] if i give him an altitude and he's got
[1:19:33] to climb to this
[1:19:34] this altitude that he has to the pilot
[1:19:37] has to say it back to me and i have to
[1:19:39] verify that it was the right thing
[1:19:42] and if i don't catch it sometimes if
[1:19:43] you're very busy and you're busy talking
[1:19:45] talking talking
[1:19:46] and you tell this guy something and
[1:19:48] you're so busy you're thinking about the
[1:19:50] next thing you have to do and you
[1:19:51] you hear what they say but you don't
[1:19:53] really listen to it and then all of a
[1:19:54] sudden they do something you weren't
[1:19:56] expecting you say what happened
[1:19:58] and you can go back and listen to the
[1:19:59] recording and find out you told him to
[1:20:01] go to 30
[1:20:02] 000 feet you told him the right thing
[1:20:04] but he's he said
[1:20:05] oh we're gonna go to 35 000 feet and you
[1:20:07] didn't hear it
[1:20:08] well that's my fault because i didn't
[1:20:10] hear it so is it with the people of god
[1:20:13] you you say that so many are going to
[1:20:15] come on the end of the road
[1:20:17] and say lord i didn't hear this or hear
[1:20:21] that
[1:20:22] and no doubt they're going to bring up
[1:20:24] the preachers of the day
[1:20:26] and how they preach this word how they
[1:20:29] had a prophet come
[1:20:30] and preach this word and brother braden
[1:20:32] i think he even said in many places how
[1:20:34] my word my voice will echo out for
[1:20:37] eternity
[1:20:38] as a witness against them and so will
[1:20:41] your words echo out
[1:20:42] that's why it's so important that i i've
[1:20:45] posted out
[1:20:46] i want to be clear of the gift i don't
[1:20:47] want to be guilty of the blood of any
[1:20:49] i'm i'm clear of the blood of all men
[1:20:51] why because i'm not shunned to declare
[1:20:53] unto you the full gospel of jesus christ
[1:20:56] amen whether they'll hear it or not
[1:20:59] i don't know but the scripture says that
[1:21:02] having eyes to see they wouldn't see and
[1:21:04] having ears to hear they wouldn't hear
[1:21:06] so is it in this day many people say oh
[1:21:09] yeah i heard you i heard you i heard you
[1:21:11] but if you truly heard
[1:21:13] and you could accept and place it with
[1:21:16] faith
[1:21:17] then we'd see something happen
[1:21:21] now taste the last one of this natural
[1:21:24] ones
[1:21:25] i don't want to keep us too long so
[1:21:26] maybe we'll just kind of rush here a
[1:21:27] little bit we'll see what the lord has
[1:21:32] taste that's a very
[1:21:36] that's one that that's a big variety for
[1:21:39] people you know
[1:21:40] taste has so many applications when it
[1:21:42] comes to
[1:21:43] well you have a taste of what you hear
[1:21:45] people have different tastes of food
[1:21:47] people have different tastes of music
[1:21:49] some people like
[1:21:50] the more southern style and some people
[1:21:53] like the more
[1:21:54] gospel type of style of of music or
[1:21:56] whatever it is some people have their
[1:21:58] own little tastes
[1:21:59] some people you know and we have to be
[1:22:00] very careful about this because god has
[1:22:02] made each one of us unique
[1:22:04] we were talking about the other day and
[1:22:05] i said brother amen you know i like food
[1:22:08] but man blue cheese i just can't get
[1:22:10] behind that i just can't do it it tastes
[1:22:12] disgusting to me
[1:22:13] it tastes like death given
[1:22:15] personification and a cheese
[1:22:17] that's what it tastes like to me but
[1:22:19] that's my taste you see each one of us
[1:22:21] but see these are the variety and the
[1:22:23] characteristics god has made
[1:22:25] and if we're if we're before the word
[1:22:28] and we're we're honest before god he
[1:22:30] uses these things
[1:22:31] for his purpose you know not everyone
[1:22:35] preaches the same
[1:22:36] and some people have what we could say a
[1:22:38] different taste of the way they like to
[1:22:40] hear the word of god some people
[1:22:42] just have such an enjoyment for teaching
[1:22:45] they really love to go deep and don't
[1:22:47] get me wrong all the children of god
[1:22:49] love teaching but some
[1:22:50] maybe that's that's where they just oh
[1:22:52] they just really love that
[1:22:53] but some people like maybe how maybe
[1:22:55] some people don't like the way i
[1:22:56] minister uh maybe a little bit louder
[1:22:58] or some people have a taste for this or
[1:23:00] a taste for that and
[1:23:02] and you know what none of that matters
[1:23:04] that's fine
[1:23:05] whether you prefer the style of one or
[1:23:08] the other your tastes may differ
[1:23:09] but let's all agree that if it's the
[1:23:12] word of god
[1:23:12] we our spirit and our soul uh we can
[1:23:15] amen to the word of god
[1:23:17] no matter which which how it's prepared
[1:23:20] so so to speak some people like their
[1:23:22] stakes
[1:23:23] medium rare and some people like them
[1:23:26] wrong
[1:23:28] which you know in my case is anything
[1:23:29] other than medium rare you know
[1:23:33] but some people like the the different
[1:23:35] the different styles of doing it that's
[1:23:37] fine
[1:23:37] but let's just all agree we're eating
[1:23:39] the steak
[1:23:41] let's just let's just all enjoy the that
[1:23:43] nutrition
[1:23:44] that the words providing for you hey man
[1:23:46] let's just enjoy
[1:23:48] that but we got to be careful because
[1:23:50] taste
[1:23:51] can be such a thing that the enemy can
[1:23:53] use against the people of god
[1:23:56] because what happens is so all of a
[1:23:58] sudden because
[1:23:59] maybe your taste is a little bit
[1:24:01] different in the natural way
[1:24:03] we we need to come in a spiritual manner
[1:24:06] remember to put all the natural tastes
[1:24:08] aside
[1:24:09] and take a spiritual taste for the truth
[1:24:12] of god
[1:24:13] because if we're not careful we turn out
[1:24:16] to be just like the children of israel
[1:24:18] we're in the wilderness
[1:24:19] let's turn in the scripture to numbers
[1:24:25] numbers chapter 21.
[1:24:35] numbers chapter 21 verse 5.
[1:24:39] the scripture says and moses i'm sorry
[1:24:41] and the people spake against god
[1:24:43] and against moses wherefore have you
[1:24:45] brought us up out of egypt to die in the
[1:24:47] wilderness
[1:24:48] is there for there is no bread neither
[1:24:50] is there any water
[1:24:51] and our soul loatheth this light bread
[1:24:55] oh my let's turn the back also to
[1:24:57] numbers chapter 11
[1:24:59] verses 4 through 6.
[1:25:07] just talking about the taste we need to
[1:25:09] be very careful
[1:25:12] numbers chapter 11 verses 4 through 6
[1:25:15] and the mixed multitude that was among
[1:25:17] them fell
[1:25:17] lusting and the children of israel also
[1:25:20] wept again
[1:25:20] and said who shall give us flesh to eat
[1:25:23] we remember the fish
[1:25:25] which we did eat in egypt freely the
[1:25:27] cucumbers the melons and the leeks and
[1:25:29] the onions and the garlic
[1:25:30] but now our soul is dried away there is
[1:25:33] nothing at all besides this manna
[1:25:35] before our eyes oh my
[1:25:38] oh my isn't that something and then
[1:25:41] chapter 11 just go down a little bit to
[1:25:43] verse 33
[1:25:45] it says and wow so we understand that
[1:25:47] they they complained about this manna
[1:25:50] and so god brings the quail upon the
[1:25:52] land and they start eating
[1:25:54] it says and while the flesh in chat in
[1:25:56] verse 33 was yet between their teeth
[1:25:58] aaron was chewed
[1:25:59] the wrath of the lord was kindled
[1:26:01] against the people and the lord smote
[1:26:03] the people with a very great plague
[1:26:06] so what happened if their tastes got
[1:26:09] perverted
[1:26:11] god had provided them the manna the
[1:26:14] scripture says it tasted like
[1:26:16] honey wafers i can't imagine getting
[1:26:18] tired of honey wafers
[1:26:20] even in the natural i couldn't imagine
[1:26:22] it but it's a spiritual type
[1:26:25] amen because you think about the power
[1:26:29] of what they said it's no wonder the
[1:26:32] lord would see their carcasses fell in
[1:26:33] the wilderness
[1:26:35] because they said our soul loathed this
[1:26:38] light bread
[1:26:39] and jesus christ said i am that bread
[1:26:43] that came down from heaven and they said
[1:26:46] our soul
[1:26:47] loatheth jesus christ
[1:26:51] you say oh that's too far it's not too
[1:26:53] far that's what he said
[1:26:54] he was that bread there's sustaining
[1:26:57] power
[1:26:58] it was so powerful and important that
[1:27:00] god said you take a handful of that
[1:27:02] and you put it in the ark you put it in
[1:27:06] the holy
[1:27:06] holies to be remembered forever so you
[1:27:09] can always go back
[1:27:10] and take a bite of that and be sustained
[1:27:15] amen and god's brought this word to us
[1:27:19] and if we're not careful the devil tries
[1:27:22] to pervert our tastes
[1:27:25] and say oh i'm so tired of this
[1:27:27] preaching that brother jesse's been
[1:27:29] preaching on for months oh
[1:27:32] i wish something new would come some new
[1:27:35] thing
[1:27:37] not realizing that you're just as the
[1:27:40] children of israel
[1:27:41] oh we load this light bread we watch
[1:27:44] something deeper
[1:27:45] we want something greater we want
[1:27:47] something different
[1:27:49] they told the same thing to brother
[1:27:50] branham give him spiritual gifts
[1:27:53] teach him these great things he said i'd
[1:27:55] move past that
[1:27:57] if they could get the abcs first
[1:28:02] so it isn't for us we need to be so
[1:28:04] careful
[1:28:05] but what was it it was that mixed
[1:28:07] multitude
[1:28:09] see it wasn't the children of israel
[1:28:12] were wrapped up by that mixed multitude
[1:28:16] that came with them because the
[1:28:19] scripture says it was the mix
[1:28:20] verse 4 of chapter 11 the mixed
[1:28:23] multitude
[1:28:24] fell a lasting and so what happened
[1:28:28] they got caught up into that into that
[1:28:31] atmosphere
[1:28:33] because then the mixed multitude started
[1:28:35] to lust
[1:28:37] and then the children of israel joined
[1:28:39] in with them
[1:28:42] so we got to be careful with these
[1:28:44] murmurings
[1:28:45] backbitings complainings come don't get
[1:28:49] caught up in that
[1:28:51] it'll pervert your tastes you know one
[1:28:54] of the first
[1:28:55] and it's it's it's something isn't it
[1:28:57] that one of the symptoms they said a
[1:28:58] covet 19
[1:29:00] if you lose your taste in your smell
[1:29:02] right
[1:29:03] it's one of you and it's been like that
[1:29:05] forever even with like a cold or a flu
[1:29:08] what happens you start losing your taste
[1:29:10] in your smell
[1:29:11] food doesn't taste the way it used to
[1:29:13] you can't smell things anymore and
[1:29:14] remember
[1:29:15] we talked about even with smells smell
[1:29:17] is one of the things you can tell
[1:29:18] when the atmosphere is a little rotten
[1:29:21] you start to lose your ability to
[1:29:22] discern
[1:29:24] now the sudden you can't taste if that
[1:29:27] two week old casserole
[1:29:28] is that he could eat or not you can't
[1:29:31] smell
[1:29:32] you understand what i'm saying i know it
[1:29:33] sounds silly but these senses were used
[1:29:36] to contact the outs the world to help us
[1:29:39] discern
[1:29:40] and to understand what's going on but
[1:29:42] whatever if you find all of a sudden
[1:29:44] that your taste isn't for the word of
[1:29:47] god
[1:29:49] if you find that your life seems to
[1:29:52] stink a little bit
[1:29:55] maybe you're a little sick maybe you
[1:29:57] need a little bit of that bomb that's in
[1:29:58] gilead
[1:30:00] it doesn't mean that there's no hope for
[1:30:01] you but we need to recognize these
[1:30:04] things because they wanted it
[1:30:07] they they wanted it so badly we want
[1:30:08] these we want this meat
[1:30:11] just like we read in hebrews this meat
[1:30:14] belongs to them
[1:30:15] that are mature that have used these
[1:30:18] senses
[1:30:19] and exercise them for discernment
[1:30:22] but these children of israel they just
[1:30:24] wept all we wanted so god gave it to him
[1:30:27] and then he spanked him spanked him
[1:30:30] right away
[1:30:31] you say oh brother that couldn't happen
[1:30:33] to a believer
[1:30:34] oh sure it can because you say well all
[1:30:36] their carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:30:38] oh but i tell you what it can happen to
[1:30:40] a believer too turn to galatians chapter
[1:30:42] two
[1:30:46] how many of you think peter was a
[1:30:48] believer
[1:30:49] holy ghost-filled yeah absolutely he was
[1:30:54] absolutely but it doesn't mean that if
[1:30:57] we're not careful
[1:30:58] these things can't affect a believer
[1:31:01] we're talking
[1:31:02] about clearing out the channels we're
[1:31:04] talking about taking all of these
[1:31:06] avenues that have a way of
[1:31:09] contacting either our flesh or our
[1:31:11] spirit
[1:31:12] and cleansing them out so much so
[1:31:16] that god can start to express himself
[1:31:21] galatians chapter 2 verses 11 through
[1:31:23] 13.
[1:31:25] now if you understand the story they're
[1:31:27] getting together at jerusalem
[1:31:29] and they had the gentiles and the
[1:31:32] and the jews kind of gathered together
[1:31:35] and there was kind of little funny
[1:31:36] feelings there because the jews were so
[1:31:38] kind of caught up in there
[1:31:39] even though they were believers they're
[1:31:40] still kind of caught up in their ways as
[1:31:42] far as
[1:31:43] the old ways of all the unclean and all
[1:31:45] these different things
[1:31:46] you know the lord was working on him but
[1:31:48] it was little by little
[1:31:50] it was a new thing you know imagine all
[1:31:52] that time
[1:31:53] it's all unclean and then the lord comes
[1:31:55] along with a vision to peter
[1:31:57] and says don't call what i've called
[1:31:59] without cleanse unclean
[1:32:02] peter opens the door and now paul is
[1:32:04] going to the gentiles and they meet at
[1:32:06] jerusalem
[1:32:07] and they're trying to get together and
[1:32:09] now all of a sudden
[1:32:11] peter sees that the jews are kind of
[1:32:12] separating themselves because it's kind
[1:32:14] of a
[1:32:14] hierarchy type of thing of oh well we're
[1:32:17] jews though
[1:32:18] you know i know you may be believers but
[1:32:19] you're gentiles still
[1:32:21] and so peter goes along with that
[1:32:25] and verse 11 it's paul's saying but when
[1:32:28] peter was come to antioch
[1:32:30] i was stood him to the face
[1:32:34] because he was to be blamed for before
[1:32:36] that certain came from james
[1:32:38] he did eat with the gentiles but when
[1:32:41] they were come he withdrew and separated
[1:32:43] himself
[1:32:44] fearing them which were of the
[1:32:45] circumcision so what had happened
[1:32:48] peter himself had been carried away
[1:32:52] with this kind of a fear caught up in
[1:32:55] that atmosphere
[1:32:56] of these jews that didn't want any part
[1:32:58] with the gentiles
[1:33:00] and peter wanting to appease them
[1:33:03] went along with them and paul comes and
[1:33:05] says that's not right
[1:33:09] that's not right so much so in verse 13
[1:33:12] and the other jews dissembled likewise
[1:33:14] with them in so much that part of us
[1:33:16] also was carried away with their
[1:33:18] dissimulation
[1:33:19] we know barnabas was a man of god
[1:33:22] powerful warrior
[1:33:24] but i love it because god shows that
[1:33:27] there's no man perfect besides jesus
[1:33:28] christ
[1:33:30] amen he says but when i saw that they
[1:33:33] walked not uprightly according to the
[1:33:35] truth of the gospel
[1:33:36] i sent it to peter before them all if
[1:33:38] thou being the jew lives after the man
[1:33:40] or the gentiles
[1:33:41] and not as do the jews why compel us
[1:33:44] thou the gentiles to live as do the jews
[1:33:47] who are jews by nature and not sinners
[1:33:49] of the gentiles
[1:33:51] knowing that a man is not justified by
[1:33:53] the works of the law but by the faith of
[1:33:54] jesus christ
[1:33:55] even we have believed in jesus christ
[1:33:58] that we might be justified by the faith
[1:34:00] of christ
[1:34:01] and not by the works of the law for by
[1:34:03] the words of the law shall no flesh be
[1:34:05] justified
[1:34:06] amen paul even had to correct peter
[1:34:10] so it goes to show that we need to be
[1:34:12] very careful
[1:34:13] what we're associating ourselves with
[1:34:15] what we're all these senses
[1:34:16] what are we listening to what are we
[1:34:19] hearing
[1:34:20] why because that mixed multitude started
[1:34:22] to complain
[1:34:24] and pretty soon since the children of
[1:34:25] israel started to weep about it
[1:34:28] they got caught up in it they were
[1:34:30] hearing the wrong things
[1:34:33] and because they started hearing the
[1:34:34] wrong things
[1:34:36] look at these other senses in the spirit
[1:34:38] the memory conscious reason affection
[1:34:40] but
[1:34:40] the devil he weaves them all together
[1:34:44] because what does he start to do they
[1:34:46] get carried up in this dissimulation
[1:34:48] this
[1:34:48] this this contrasting idea of all of a
[1:34:51] sudden we load this light bread
[1:34:53] this man is not good enough anymore the
[1:34:55] word's not good enough anymore
[1:34:57] we want something better and bigger and
[1:34:59] better and deeper and
[1:35:01] more what we call revelation which just
[1:35:02] turns out to be intellectualism
[1:35:05] many times
[1:35:08] and what happens now what they heard
[1:35:11] from that mixed multitude whining and
[1:35:13] complaining
[1:35:15] alters their tastes now they want
[1:35:18] something just like that
[1:35:20] now all of a sudden it satan see how he
[1:35:23] weaves his web
[1:35:25] he starts working on these senses he
[1:35:27] starts clogging up all these avenues
[1:35:29] because now they change their tastes
[1:35:33] now the man is not enough and so much
[1:35:36] now the devil starts working on their
[1:35:38] memory
[1:35:40] now egypt looks like a paradise to them
[1:35:44] where they were slaves oh we remember
[1:35:48] the leaks and the garlic that we ate
[1:35:50] freely freely
[1:35:54] first of all it's wrong on two levels
[1:35:58] you didn't get to eat all you wanted so
[1:36:01] you didn't get
[1:36:02] freely as much as you wanted and you
[1:36:04] were slaves
[1:36:05] so you were quite literally not eating
[1:36:07] it freely
[1:36:10] on every level but you see then they
[1:36:12] start to reason
[1:36:13] so see how the devil starts to work all
[1:36:15] he starts to tie it together
[1:36:17] and what does he do he starts to paint a
[1:36:19] false picture
[1:36:21] and what happens is pretty soon you're
[1:36:23] just totally blinded
[1:36:25] just like this day eyes to see a kid
[1:36:28] here
[1:36:28] ears to hear or eyes to see they can't
[1:36:30] see ears to hear but can i hear
[1:36:34] they say oh we're rich and increase with
[1:36:35] goods and know it's not that you're poor
[1:36:36] miserable
[1:36:37] wretched blind naked
[1:36:40] and what is it all those things are just
[1:36:44] symptoms of all the other ones and it's
[1:36:46] just the devil just working that thing
[1:36:48] together
[1:36:50] so we got to be very careful
[1:36:53] don't think don't think you know yeah
[1:36:56] peter was a believer
[1:36:57] but he had his struggles just like we
[1:36:59] all do praise the lord
[1:37:01] you know for the word that can come and
[1:37:03] rightly divide
[1:37:04] point us out where we're wrong give us
[1:37:06] some i sav
[1:37:09] it may not be pleasant at the time think
[1:37:11] about
[1:37:12] taste again you know medicine most of
[1:37:14] the time doesn't taste too good
[1:37:17] i remember when i was a child we used to
[1:37:19] have the robitussin
[1:37:21] it was like for when you had like a
[1:37:22] fever a flu or a cold
[1:37:24] oh my goodness still even now i almost
[1:37:26] think about it almost makes me shudder
[1:37:27] it's so disgusting and i remember just
[1:37:30] like thinking with my parents always
[1:37:31] going to give you a
[1:37:32] big dose of robitussin i'd be almost
[1:37:34] crying please i just ran
[1:37:36] just i'll just you know i'll just deal
[1:37:38] with the cold i'll just deal with the
[1:37:40] flu
[1:37:40] i don't want to take the robot i almost
[1:37:42] be crying when i was a child
[1:37:44] but what they knew would do me good the
[1:37:48] but you know the the medicine that we
[1:37:49] get doesn't always taste good
[1:37:52] but the word sure does taste good it's
[1:37:54] sweet in your mouth like honey
[1:37:56] amen let's just always be singing the
[1:37:58] songs of zion oh is that the word on our
[1:38:00] lips always a positive testimony
[1:38:04] you know they talk about you know you
[1:38:05] can all these things go and you can you
[1:38:07] see where
[1:38:08] how the truth behind so many things that
[1:38:10] we say almost in everyday life you say
[1:38:12] oh
[1:38:12] well that thing it just left a bad taste
[1:38:14] in my mouth
[1:38:16] what is it there's something wrong with
[1:38:17] it there was something off about it
[1:38:20] but that taste it's very important it's
[1:38:23] very important it helps us to discern
[1:38:26] i had another scripture here i believe
[1:38:29] if i could find it lord willing
[1:38:34] job chapter 6 30. he says is there
[1:38:38] iniquity in my tongue
[1:38:39] he says cannot my taste discern perverse
[1:38:42] things
[1:38:45] and job 12 11
[1:38:49] says does not the ear try words and the
[1:38:52] mouth
[1:38:53] taste his meat
[1:38:56] so what is it we find out what is this
[1:38:58] this is all that discernment
[1:38:59] these senses not take it spiritually
[1:39:01] it's not just physically but you can
[1:39:03] take
[1:39:04] the spiritual aspect to all these things
[1:39:06] what kind of words are you speaking
[1:39:08] are you speaking positive words brother
[1:39:10] branham said that the man of god
[1:39:12] is always positive never negative
[1:39:16] i don't have the quote with me right now
[1:39:17] but i know that's exactly i believe
[1:39:18] that's almost exactly how he said he
[1:39:19] says the man of god he said he's always
[1:39:21] positive
[1:39:22] never negative why because regardless of
[1:39:25] what the situation
[1:39:26] is just like the shudomite
[1:39:29] is that it's all all well with thee and
[1:39:31] the child all is well
[1:39:34] that's a that's a sweet taste on the
[1:39:37] mouth that's that's a sweet
[1:39:38] and not only that that that testimony
[1:39:41] becomes
[1:39:41] a sweet savor in the in the nostrils of
[1:39:44] god
[1:39:45] he hears that testimony all things are
[1:39:48] going wrong he said yeah we're more than
[1:39:49] conquerors
[1:39:51] amen amen and that taste
[1:39:54] it helps you to discern it helps you to
[1:39:56] see the different things we'll just go
[1:39:58] through a few more here
[1:39:59] we'll just quickly go through a few of
[1:40:00] these other ones so we talk about memory
[1:40:03] going into the spirit now so we talked
[1:40:05] about see taste feel smelling here
[1:40:07] those different five natural senses that
[1:40:10] we deal with
[1:40:11] and now talking about
[1:40:14] the the spiritual so we think about
[1:40:17] memory
[1:40:20] and lord one this is probably one we'll
[1:40:22] expand on tomorrow lord if the lord
[1:40:24] allows
[1:40:24] so we won't dwell on it too long here
[1:40:27] but the scripture says
[1:40:30] i believe it was in romans it says that
[1:40:33] they did not like to retain god in their
[1:40:35] knowledge
[1:40:37] what happened they forgot god just like
[1:40:40] our nation
[1:40:42] just like the whole world really as it
[1:40:43] were now but we've seen in our nation
[1:40:45] even in the last
[1:40:46] you know i i can only speak for my
[1:40:48] lifetime because you know
[1:40:50] growing up and everything but even in my
[1:40:51] lifetime just the the direction of this
[1:40:54] nation as far as even an attitude
[1:40:56] towards god
[1:40:57] they not now they wouldn't even not even
[1:40:59] claim
[1:41:00] god at all to be even amongst the people
[1:41:03] let alone
[1:41:04] anything that they would be proud of or
[1:41:07] or desire to stand with
[1:41:09] they don't even want to have god in
[1:41:10] their knowledge anymore we want to erase
[1:41:12] it from history
[1:41:14] oh my peter says in
[1:41:18] second peter chapter 3 verses 1 and 2 he
[1:41:21] says
[1:41:23] i want to stir up your pure minds by way
[1:41:25] of remembrance
[1:41:27] that you mean mindful of the words that
[1:41:28] were spoken before by the holy prophets
[1:41:30] and of the commandment by the apostles
[1:41:32] of the lord and savior so what is it god
[1:41:35] wants you to always have these things in
[1:41:37] your memory always have these things in
[1:41:39] your mind
[1:41:40] this paul said he said whatsoever things
[1:41:42] are lovely whatsoever things are holy
[1:41:43] and virtuous and
[1:41:44] true he said think on these things keep
[1:41:47] these things in your memory
[1:41:49] but what does the devil do he uses the
[1:41:50] opposite side he always brings back all
[1:41:52] your failures
[1:41:54] he's always bringing back all your
[1:41:55] struggles amen we won't go that too
[1:41:58] into that too deep now but and then
[1:42:00] conscience
[1:42:02] conscience that's another one that the
[1:42:04] devil see and
[1:42:05] as you start as we go through some of
[1:42:07] these senses i hope you understand
[1:42:09] how the devil uses and tries to weave
[1:42:12] all these things together they just
[1:42:14] one right on top of the other see
[1:42:16] because that memory comes in
[1:42:18] and the devil's bringing up these
[1:42:19] memories and all of a sudden now your
[1:42:21] conscience
[1:42:22] oh now i can't live with the good
[1:42:24] conscience before god because of all
[1:42:25] these things
[1:42:26] what happens you've forgotten that you
[1:42:27] were purged from your old sins
[1:42:30] all of a sudden you're your sight and
[1:42:31] what does that do your spiritual sight
[1:42:33] starts to get filmed over
[1:42:34] all these things work together that's
[1:42:37] why
[1:42:38] we need to open up these channels clear
[1:42:40] them mouth by the word of god
[1:42:42] and let god work through them so that
[1:42:44] they're clear that there's no
[1:42:46] no hindrance to the people of god amen
[1:42:53] acts chapter 24 let's turn there i hope
[1:42:56] this is okay
[1:42:57] we'll close here in just a minute the
[1:43:00] book of acts chapter 24
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:07] verses 14 to 16. paul
[1:43:11] says but this i confess unto thee that
[1:43:13] after the way which they call heresy so
[1:43:16] worship by the god of my fathers
[1:43:17] believing all things that are written in
[1:43:19] the law and in the prophets
[1:43:21] and have hope toward god which they
[1:43:24] themselves also allow
[1:43:26] that there shall be a resurrection of
[1:43:28] the dead both of the just and
[1:43:29] unjust and herein do i exercise myself
[1:43:32] to have always a conscience void of
[1:43:34] offense
[1:43:34] toward god and toward men amen i love
[1:43:37] that that's what
[1:43:38] god that's what god wants for his people
[1:43:40] is to have a conscience
[1:43:41] void of offense toward god first
[1:43:45] and then towards men so many we reverse
[1:43:48] that
[1:43:49] so many times we'd we'd rather be clear
[1:43:52] of men and just
[1:43:53] oh i don't want to offend anybody no i'd
[1:43:56] rather offend men all day
[1:43:59] because even the lord said offenses
[1:44:00] shall surely come
[1:44:02] they're coming but i'd rather offend man
[1:44:06] all day
[1:44:07] but have my conscience clear before god
[1:44:09] amen
[1:44:10] then to have my oh well i didn't offend
[1:44:12] anybody
[1:44:13] and meanwhile the lord says yeah but she
[1:44:15] didn't stand for my word
[1:44:18] have a backbone instead of a wishbone
[1:44:21] amen
[1:44:22] hebrews hebrews 10
[1:44:26] verse 2. i'll turn there real quick
[1:44:29] let's go through a few scriptures here
[1:44:31] as we get ready close
[1:44:38] and we'll start at verse 1 for the law
[1:44:39] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:44:41] and not the very image of the things can
[1:44:42] never with those sacrifices which they
[1:44:44] offered year by year continually
[1:44:46] make the comers there unto perfect
[1:44:49] for then would they not have ceased to
[1:44:51] be offered because that the worshiper
[1:44:53] once purged should not have
[1:44:54] should have had no more conscience of
[1:44:56] sins and so is it with the believer
[1:44:59] god by the sprinkling of that atonement
[1:45:03] the blood of jesus christ has purged
[1:45:06] your conscience from sins
[1:45:07] you don't have to be weighed down by a
[1:45:10] conscience
[1:45:11] that's not clear before god because you
[1:45:14] have faith
[1:45:15] in the sacrifice that he gave but the
[1:45:18] devil's always on the other side
[1:45:20] pointing you not to calvary but to your
[1:45:23] failures
[1:45:24] he's always there to bring with that
[1:45:26] memory
[1:45:28] bring back your failures and so try
[1:45:31] to to make that conscience not before
[1:45:33] god
[1:45:34] perfect anymore because all of a sudden
[1:45:36] you start to
[1:45:37] lack that sight again you start to not
[1:45:39] be able to hear the word the way it
[1:45:41] ought to be that
[1:45:42] you've been purged from those sins that
[1:45:44] the scripture said
[1:45:45] their sins and iniquities i will
[1:45:46] remember no more
[1:45:49] but the devil's right there remember
[1:45:50] this then you've got this problem and
[1:45:52] you have this struggle
[1:45:54] and that problem and this failure
[1:45:58] but don't let your conscience weigh you
[1:46:00] down you say i've
[1:46:01] uh yes that may be true i had these
[1:46:03] struggles but i've put it underneath the
[1:46:05] blood
[1:46:05] i've gone before my lord i've asked for
[1:46:08] the forgiveness of sins
[1:46:09] and he said he's faithful and just to
[1:46:11] forgive me amen
[1:46:14] but if we're not careful that conscience
[1:46:16] is well is there what is it it's the
[1:46:18] holy ghost
[1:46:19] to prick you when something's wrong
[1:46:23] if we've got if you've gotten to the
[1:46:25] point where you
[1:46:26] you've overpowered the sight or we've
[1:46:30] overpowered the smell
[1:46:32] allowed yourself to get into a place
[1:46:34] where sin
[1:46:35] is even at the door it's right there and
[1:46:38] you put yourself in that situation
[1:46:40] you've ran over those senses and there's
[1:46:42] that conscience there
[1:46:44] there to prick you still trying to to
[1:46:47] nudge you in the right direction of the
[1:46:48] spirit and say there's something wrong
[1:46:50] take the lord for a supernatural sense
[1:46:54] a holy ghost that can prick that
[1:46:56] conscience but if we're not careful
[1:46:58] just like all these other senses could
[1:47:01] be desensitized
[1:47:02] your conscience you start barreling over
[1:47:05] that conscience too many times
[1:47:06] you'll do it too many times and pretty
[1:47:09] soon you get your conscience seared with
[1:47:11] a hot iron
[1:47:12] all of a sudden oh it doesn't
[1:47:16] doesn't my conscience is not affected by
[1:47:19] by drinking oh it doesn't it doesn't
[1:47:23] hurt me
[1:47:24] you know to watch those wicked movies
[1:47:27] not even think all my faith is i have
[1:47:30] enough faith i can do it
[1:47:32] oh i'm sure you do now because your
[1:47:35] conscience was seared
[1:47:38] first timothy 4 1-2 let's just read that
[1:47:41] i enjoy reading the scriptures
[1:47:51] first timothy 4 verses 1 through 2
[1:47:55] says now the spirit speaketh expressly
[1:47:57] that in the latter times
[1:47:59] some shadows of art from the faith
[1:48:00] giving heat to seducing spirits and
[1:48:02] doctrines of devils
[1:48:03] speaking lies and hypocrisy having their
[1:48:05] conscience seared
[1:48:07] with a hot iron
[1:48:10] and that's speaking about even preaching
[1:48:12] of the word and lies
[1:48:14] what is it the word has been right there
[1:48:16] to prick the conscience no that's
[1:48:18] not right that trinity that trinity
[1:48:20] doctrine is not right
[1:48:23] that baptism doctrine is not right but
[1:48:25] they just keep preaching it
[1:48:27] and they just keep speaking it and
[1:48:28] pretty soon they just run over that
[1:48:30] conscience enough
[1:48:32] you know it's just like all these things
[1:48:34] can become desensitized
[1:48:35] you think about you think about even in
[1:48:38] the natural
[1:48:39] you ever been on a on like a tractor or
[1:48:42] like a
[1:48:43] go card or something that has a lot of
[1:48:45] vibration to it
[1:48:46] and you're holding onto that steering
[1:48:47] wheel and by the time you're done you
[1:48:49] can't even feel your hands anymore
[1:48:50] what happened your hands became
[1:48:52] desensitized to that stimulation
[1:48:56] you ever been around to smell so much
[1:48:59] that you don't smell it anymore
[1:49:01] it's a scientific name it's called
[1:49:02] olfactory fatigue
[1:49:04] it's where you're smelling sense
[1:49:07] it smelled it so much that it just kind
[1:49:09] of shuts it off
[1:49:13] and it's we got to be so careful that we
[1:49:16] don't desensitize ourselves
[1:49:19] to wicked things by allowing these
[1:49:21] things to
[1:49:22] to stay may we just recognize and pull
[1:49:25] out the sword and go to chopping
[1:49:28] get on our knees and pray that the lord
[1:49:30] will help us to clear out all these
[1:49:31] channels
[1:49:38] affections just the last couple here and
[1:49:41] we'll just
[1:49:42] we'll just go really quickly and wrap up
[1:49:43] i don't want to keep us too long
[1:49:45] affections matthew
[1:49:48] 6 19-21 lay night up for yourselves
[1:49:51] treasures upon earth where moth and rust
[1:49:52] doth corrupt
[1:49:53] and where thieves break through and
[1:49:54] steal but lay up for yourselves
[1:49:56] treasures in heaven
[1:49:57] where neither moth nor rust do doth
[1:49:59] corrupt and where thieves do not break
[1:50:01] through nor steal for where your
[1:50:02] treasure is
[1:50:03] there will your heart be also amen amen
[1:50:07] galatians 5 24-26 and they that are
[1:50:10] christ have crucified
[1:50:12] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[1:50:17] so remember as we spoke in that first
[1:50:19] scripture how
[1:50:20] the flesh is lusting against the spirit
[1:50:22] and the spirit against the flesh and
[1:50:24] their contrary
[1:50:25] so there's affections that come from
[1:50:27] this flesh and there's affections that
[1:50:29] come
[1:50:30] from the holy ghost in the believer that
[1:50:32] are at war with one another
[1:50:35] and so what are we to do we're here to
[1:50:37] give our affections under the things of
[1:50:39] god
[1:50:41] crucify all the fl the affections of the
[1:50:44] the flesh all the lust of the flesh all
[1:50:47] those things that are
[1:50:48] pulling on the flesh crucify that die
[1:50:51] daily
[1:50:53] amen and then we'll just kind of go over
[1:50:56] this
[1:50:57] to reasoning we know reasoning obviously
[1:50:58] is such a big one in this age
[1:51:00] from from the very time you're born now
[1:51:02] it's just reasoning reasoning and
[1:51:04] science and
[1:51:05] and we understand from the very garden
[1:51:06] of eden that's what was gotten was
[1:51:08] reasoning
[1:51:08] you shall not surely die you see
[1:51:12] satan gets us with reasoning so much and
[1:51:14] that ties in to every other sense that
[1:51:16] there is
[1:51:18] and the devil we've been speaking about
[1:51:20] the whole time how he works on both
[1:51:21] sides
[1:51:23] you think about how how god
[1:51:26] how god could do something for a person
[1:51:28] you you need a healing in your life
[1:51:31] you need you need let's just use healing
[1:51:33] as an example
[1:51:34] i was talking with the brother there in
[1:51:36] texas and we were talking about this and
[1:51:37] it just
[1:51:38] it strikes me because that devil he's
[1:51:39] tricky
[1:51:41] and he's he's definitely wise he knows
[1:51:43] how to do it how to try to trick people
[1:51:46] but we're not ignorant of satan's
[1:51:48] devices we're not ignorant to his tricks
[1:51:51] but what does he do the whole time you
[1:51:53] may need a healing and you're praying
[1:51:55] and you're believing and the devil's
[1:51:57] right there god can't do it
[1:51:59] god can't do it god can't do it
[1:52:02] and then god does it and then he's right
[1:52:05] on the other side to say
[1:52:06] well god didn't do that it was the
[1:52:07] medicine or
[1:52:09] you never really had that problem to
[1:52:10] begin with well which one is the devil
[1:52:14] it's either it was there and god can't
[1:52:16] heal it
[1:52:17] or it was never there god didn't heal it
[1:52:20] you see how that devil works with that
[1:52:22] reasoning
[1:52:23] and he's always right there to jump into
[1:52:25] that reasoning and and i was thinking i
[1:52:27] was thinking about this today and i it
[1:52:29] struck me in a way i never
[1:52:30] i've never seen it before how so many
[1:52:34] times we equate that reasoning
[1:52:36] like with the garden of eden of things
[1:52:38] that we shouldn't do
[1:52:40] right of of says don't touch it
[1:52:44] don't even look at it neither should you
[1:52:45] touch it should at least you die
[1:52:48] and satan says ye shall not surely die
[1:52:50] so what does he do he reasons her away
[1:52:52] from something
[1:52:53] that she ought not to do that she does
[1:52:55] but reverse that
[1:52:57] how often does reasoning from the devil
[1:53:00] take us away from the things that we
[1:53:02] ought to do
[1:53:06] think about the sister we spoke of
[1:53:08] yesterday
[1:53:09] in brother braham's meeting how the
[1:53:11] devil worked with reasoning
[1:53:13] where the lord put it on her heart to
[1:53:14] pray for the baby and the devil tried to
[1:53:16] risen her away from doing the will of
[1:53:19] god
[1:53:21] how often does that happen in our lives
[1:53:23] oh i shouldn't go witness to this person
[1:53:25] because of this and this and this and
[1:53:27] this
[1:53:28] because my life is this and i've
[1:53:30] struggled with that
[1:53:31] and and i've said this before and i've
[1:53:34] done this
[1:53:34] and what does it do you start your
[1:53:35] reason away from the actual work god
[1:53:38] wants you to do
[1:53:41] we look at it on the negative so many
[1:53:42] times or we reason ourselves into doing
[1:53:44] something we shouldn't do
[1:53:46] but what about the times where satan
[1:53:48] gets us away from the things that we
[1:53:50] ought to do
[1:53:53] how so many out there that maybe have
[1:53:56] been witness to about the baptism in the
[1:53:58] name of jesus christ
[1:54:00] but they reason themselves out of doing
[1:54:02] the will of god
[1:54:04] how the even think of the children of
[1:54:06] israel
[1:54:08] at cadence barnea how they were told go
[1:54:11] possess the land typing the holy ghost
[1:54:15] and and satan put the reasoning into the
[1:54:19] heart of the spies
[1:54:20] oh it's too great we can't do it
[1:54:24] and reason them right out of the
[1:54:25] promised land and
[1:54:27] reason them to not do what god had
[1:54:29] called them to do
[1:54:31] we've got to be careful that that
[1:54:33] reasoning doesn't keep us
[1:54:35] from fulfilling the word of god amen
[1:54:38] from doing the things that god promised
[1:54:42] because we're always make a reason
[1:54:44] satan's only if you want a reason
[1:54:46] satan will give you a reason he'll give
[1:54:48] you a reason to do something that god
[1:54:50] doesn't want you to do
[1:54:51] and he'll give you a reason to not do
[1:54:53] something god does want you to do
[1:54:55] he's just full of it he's got all the
[1:54:57] reasons available
[1:54:58] he's got a he's got a whole oh
[1:55:02] board a whole book full of reasons he
[1:55:04] can give you
[1:55:08] so we need to cast down that reasoning
[1:55:10] get it out of your mind
[1:55:12] the only reasoning that matters is the
[1:55:16] word
[1:55:19] and then imagination the scripture says
[1:55:21] that
[1:55:22] that the imagination of man's heart was
[1:55:24] only evil continually i believe it was
[1:55:25] in the days of noah
[1:55:27] look at the day we're living is that not
[1:55:29] the way
[1:55:31] they come up with things that you don't
[1:55:32] even understand how they can come up
[1:55:33] with them
[1:55:35] what is it it's an imagination it's a
[1:55:37] it's a it's a it's a
[1:55:38] desire to do something but you know we
[1:55:40] think of imaginations
[1:55:42] and we think it's an evil thing but god
[1:55:44] can use it for good
[1:55:46] see we call it imagination but i think
[1:55:48] another word you could use for it would
[1:55:49] be inspiration
[1:55:52] when god inspires a child of god to
[1:55:55] write a song
[1:55:57] or something like that or god gives an
[1:55:59] inspiration for a sermon
[1:56:01] or god gives an inspiration to to build
[1:56:04] or do something for the lord that's an
[1:56:06] imagination
[1:56:07] that's that's an inspiration in the mind
[1:56:09] of the believer
[1:56:10] we talked about david david had an
[1:56:12] imagination
[1:56:14] and it is mine because what is they call
[1:56:16] the imagination like your mind's eye the
[1:56:18] way you
[1:56:19] the way you can see something in your
[1:56:20] mind you can come up with ideas and
[1:56:22] concepts and and something you want to
[1:56:24] do and david
[1:56:26] caught the mind of god god had a godly
[1:56:29] imagination said i want to build that
[1:56:31] temple
[1:56:32] was it wasn't an ungodly imagination
[1:56:36] because that temple was built that house
[1:56:39] was built
[1:56:40] it just wasn't for him to do but he had
[1:56:43] caught what was it that was a godly
[1:56:44] imagination
[1:56:46] we put that imagination thing so many
[1:56:48] times on the bad side
[1:56:49] it almost becomes a bad word but it's
[1:56:51] true that the evil if you let the
[1:56:54] flesh imagination rule you you'll come
[1:56:56] up with just about anything against the
[1:56:57] word of god
[1:56:58] against god
[1:57:03] i think i wrote down another couple
[1:57:04] scriptures here forgive me i know my
[1:57:06] notes sometimes get a little
[1:57:08] a little uh off with writing things down
[1:57:12] but maybe we didn't write it down that's
[1:57:15] okay
[1:57:23] romans chapter one
[1:57:31] forgive me if i've kept you too long
[1:57:34] we'll just we'll be wrapping up here
[1:57:35] just a second by god's grace
[1:57:38] and like i said any one of these you
[1:57:40] could probably just preach sermons and
[1:57:42] sermons on any one
[1:57:44] but we'll just kind of give you an
[1:57:45] overview we're talking about clearing
[1:57:46] out the channels
[1:57:47] all of these things if you find if you
[1:57:49] find that one of these things are
[1:57:50] clogged up
[1:57:51] maybe you find that the the devil lately
[1:57:54] has just gotten you with that conscience
[1:57:56] there's just something in there that the
[1:57:58] devil the devil's trying to
[1:57:59] latch some past sin or something that
[1:58:02] you've struggled with
[1:58:03] that the devil is just right there to
[1:58:04] try to drag you down god's got
[1:58:06] the answer for that it's the word
[1:58:10] it's the word of god it's faith in that
[1:58:12] word is
[1:58:13] that repentance and and a clear
[1:58:15] conscience before god that he can give
[1:58:16] you
[1:58:18] but we don't rely upon what we can do in
[1:58:20] and of ourselves
[1:58:21] we're relying upon the truth that lays
[1:58:24] within the word of god and what he said
[1:58:25] about the situation
[1:58:27] romans chapter 1 verse 21 it says
[1:58:31] because that when they knew not god when
[1:58:33] because
[1:58:34] because that when they knew god they
[1:58:36] glorified him not as god
[1:58:38] neither were thankful but became vain in
[1:58:40] their imaginations and their foolish
[1:58:41] heart was darkened
[1:58:43] professing themselves to be wise they
[1:58:45] became fools
[1:58:47] and change the glory of the
[1:58:48] uncorruptable god into an image
[1:58:50] made like to corruptable man into birds
[1:58:52] into four-footed beasts and creeping
[1:58:53] things
[1:58:55] and so what do we find they've got vain
[1:58:57] imaginations vain it doesn't even it
[1:58:59] doesn't profit anything
[1:59:01] they just come up with whatever they
[1:59:02] want to we find that's the way it is in
[1:59:05] this day they're just
[1:59:06] all over the place you can find people
[1:59:08] just coming up with all kinds of
[1:59:09] wickedness and filth and everything else
[1:59:11] but if we can get into the spirit of god
[1:59:13] we find that god
[1:59:14] has got a wellspring of godly
[1:59:18] imagination for his people
[1:59:19] whatsoever things are pure and
[1:59:20] whatsoever things are holy and what
[1:59:22] whatsoever things are good we think on
[1:59:24] these things
[1:59:25] we allow the inspiration of god to
[1:59:28] to draw us and to bring out we we we're
[1:59:31] glorify god when we hear some of the
[1:59:33] wonderful songs that god's inspired
[1:59:35] to different ones that they've given
[1:59:37] that inspiration to
[1:59:38] and and to even like you see different
[1:59:40] paintings and and things
[1:59:42] see satan's seeking all these things
[1:59:43] that we see and perverted them
[1:59:46] music and art and all these different
[1:59:48] things but god has a
[1:59:50] perfect perfect version of it he's got a
[1:59:53] holy version of it
[1:59:55] if we could if we could use it for that
[1:59:57] so really in the end
[1:59:58] i guess just to close is you see we
[2:00:02] battle so much with these senses
[2:00:04] but let's turn one last scripture here
[2:00:06] as we close
[2:00:09] in first john chapter 5
[2:00:17] all these things you know are just
[2:00:20] bombarding bombarding bombarding
[2:00:23] every day the different things of the
[2:00:26] world that you see
[2:00:28] the smells that you have to deal with
[2:00:30] all the the stinky lives that are out
[2:00:32] there if we can put it that way the
[2:00:34] the different atmospheres that you're in
[2:00:36] the things that you have to
[2:00:37] you gotta rub shoulders with the world
[2:00:38] because you got to go shopping or you
[2:00:40] got to go to work and you have
[2:00:41] certain things that we have to do in
[2:00:42] this life the things that you have to
[2:00:44] hear
[2:00:45] all the wickedness that's out there you
[2:00:47] know all these different senses
[2:00:49] that that we have that the devil is just
[2:00:52] trying to stop them all up and gum them
[2:00:54] up
[2:00:55] but god by his grace wants to show
[2:00:58] himself through you and we got to clear
[2:01:01] out those channels john chapter 5 verse
[2:01:03] 4
[2:01:04] and what we do is right here for
[2:01:06] whatsoever is born of god
[2:01:08] overcometh the world and this is the
[2:01:10] victory that overcometh the world
[2:01:12] even our faith who is he that overcometh
[2:01:16] the world
[2:01:17] but he that believeth that jesus is the
[2:01:18] son of god
[2:01:20] amen so what is it
[2:01:23] in the end what's gonna what's gonna
[2:01:25] clear out the channels
[2:01:28] if that's the victory it's faith in the
[2:01:30] word of god
[2:01:32] faith faith will overcome
[2:01:35] every one of these senses
[2:01:39] faith will cause your hearing
[2:01:44] to bring the word of god to fruition in
[2:01:46] your life
[2:01:47] faith will give you a holy site
[2:01:51] to look upon the things of god and to
[2:01:53] ignore the things of the world
[2:01:54] and and to see the depth of his word
[2:01:57] faith will make your life a sweet
[2:02:01] smelling savor before god
[2:02:02] and cause your atmosphere to be a sweet
[2:02:04] atmosphere
[2:02:06] to be a holy atmosphere to be something
[2:02:08] that's pleasant to be around
[2:02:10] faith will cause your tastes
[2:02:13] to be for the word of god we know that
[2:02:16] the sermon brother branham preached
[2:02:17] on a thinking man's filter for a holy
[2:02:19] man's taste
[2:02:21] faith will cause your taste to be for
[2:02:24] the things of god
[2:02:25] it'll you'll enjoy that manna when it
[2:02:28] comes you won't consider it light bread
[2:02:30] you won't loathe the word of god it'll
[2:02:32] be it'll be sweet
[2:02:33] in your mouth faith
[2:02:37] will cause you to to feel
[2:02:40] real love for your brother and when
[2:02:43] feeling in the flesh isn't there
[2:02:45] faith will overcome those feelings and
[2:02:48] cause you to love them anyhow
[2:02:49] and cause you to pray for them and to
[2:02:51] care for them
[2:02:53] faith will will overcome the memories
[2:02:56] that satan tries to bring up and cause
[2:02:59] you to remember the word of god
[2:03:02] faith will help your conscience to to be
[2:03:04] sensitive to the holy ghost
[2:03:06] and be able to take the the the moving
[2:03:09] of the spirit
[2:03:10] to move away from wickedness and into
[2:03:12] righteousness and then also
[2:03:14] to not be weighed down in your
[2:03:16] conscience of things
[2:03:17] that that that you've struggled with or
[2:03:20] had faults or
[2:03:21] failures faith will cause you
[2:03:24] in your imaginations to be inspired of
[2:03:27] god
[2:03:28] to imagine instead of a imagination
[2:03:31] of oh man man what could i have said
[2:03:33] that would have just
[2:03:34] zinged that person because they said
[2:03:36] something wrong to me
[2:03:37] no maybe your imagination will be go oh
[2:03:39] man what could i do for brother vang
[2:03:41] next time i see him
[2:03:43] god's a godly imagination a god of
[2:03:45] imagination will be like oh my
[2:03:47] what what what food could could i cook
[2:03:50] for my husband when he comes home
[2:03:51] that that would make him happy what what
[2:03:54] for the
[2:03:55] what what could i do for my children
[2:03:57] that would do something that would just
[2:03:59] excite them and make my children happy
[2:04:01] what what could i do
[2:04:02] you know for my pastor to make him feel
[2:04:04] appreciated or or the pastor to say what
[2:04:07] can i do for the people
[2:04:08] to help maybe have him have some
[2:04:10] fellowship that's a godly imagination to
[2:04:12] have
[2:04:13] what can i do for the kingdom of god
[2:04:16] faith will cause that
[2:04:18] faith will cause you to overcome all the
[2:04:22] reasonings
[2:04:22] of why god can't do something and say it
[2:04:25] doesn't matter why he could
[2:04:27] why it doesn't look like it could happen
[2:04:29] because the word said it would happen
[2:04:31] faith will cause you to overcome the
[2:04:34] reasoning when satan says oh you can't
[2:04:36] pray for that person
[2:04:37] because you're just a low down person
[2:04:39] who had this struggle or that problem
[2:04:41] and say i don't care the scripture says
[2:04:43] if we lay hands on the sick they shall
[2:04:45] recover
[2:04:46] faith will say i put that under the
[2:04:48] blood and i'm going to walk forward
[2:04:50] in confidence in the blood of jesus
[2:04:52] christ amen
[2:04:55] faith will overcome all of those senses
[2:04:59] faith will push out so we got we don't
[2:05:02] let
[2:05:02] the world gum it up with all these
[2:05:04] natural versions of it
[2:05:05] but faith will go through like a like a
[2:05:08] shotgun a holy ghost shotgun and just
[2:05:09] blast it all out
[2:05:11] it'll scrub it all out the fire of the
[2:05:13] holy ghost will go and
[2:05:14] fire up all those channels cleanse them
[2:05:16] all out and let the flus be unstuck and
[2:05:19] let the holy ghost
[2:05:20] come flowing out of your life
[2:05:23] faith will do it it's that simple oh it
[2:05:26] seems so
[2:05:27] it seems maybe so far away sometimes but
[2:05:30] it's just simple
[2:05:31] faith in the word of god
[2:05:37] faith
[2:05:40] faith will allow the lord to sever you
[2:05:42] from all the affections of the world
[2:05:46] faith will let the lord come in and
[2:05:48] separate your
[2:05:49] separate you so that your only affection
[2:05:51] is unto him
[2:05:52] and to his people faith will make it so
[2:05:55] that
[2:05:55] your your love is for the lord jesus and
[2:05:58] his bride and his people
[2:06:02] faith can overcome all that it seems
[2:06:04] really simple
[2:06:06] but how many of us have found maybe more
[2:06:08] than one time or another we've had some
[2:06:09] of those channels blocked up
[2:06:11] [Music]
[2:06:12] i'll raise my hand i know i have but by
[2:06:15] the grace of god
[2:06:16] the word never fails the word
[2:06:19] faith in the word of god will allow you
[2:06:23] not to to overcome so you don't become
[2:06:25] desensitized to all these things
[2:06:27] we don't want to become desensitized we
[2:06:29] don't want to become blinded
[2:06:30] we don't want to have that ringing in
[2:06:32] our ears from the battles that we've had
[2:06:34] we want to be
[2:06:34] we want to be able to hear that still
[2:06:37] small voice and be ready to go
[2:06:38] we want to be able to see every little
[2:06:41] bit of the word
[2:06:42] we want to be able to to to feel his
[2:06:44] presence when he does come
[2:06:46] and you know what if we don't feel faith
[2:06:48] we'll say it doesn't matter what my
[2:06:50] feelings say it's what the word says
[2:06:51] anyhow
[2:06:53] remember if it's like if all these
[2:06:55] senses are fine if they line up with the
[2:06:57] word
[2:06:58] and if they're not you take faith and
[2:06:59] you blast that thing out of there and
[2:07:01] say it doesn't matter what that sense
[2:07:02] tells me
[2:07:04] hey man let's just all stand i hope
[2:07:06] that's okay
[2:07:07] let's all stand
[2:07:12] let's clear out the channels let's get
[2:07:15] before the lord in prayer
[2:07:18] let's sing unto the lord songs of zion
[2:07:20] and
[2:07:21] and have that righteous a good
[2:07:23] atmosphere keep those things before you
[2:07:27] that'll allow those senses to be cleared
[2:07:29] up
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:31] you know if you get into a foggy
[2:07:33] atmosphere if you get into a
[2:07:35] a nasty atmosphere you won't be able to
[2:07:37] see
[2:07:38] you don't be able to sense what's going
[2:07:39] on you won't be able to but we want to
[2:07:41] stay in a clear atmosphere we want to
[2:07:43] be that like that eagle we want to be
[2:07:45] way up high where our vision's clear
[2:07:47] there's no clouds obstructing our view
[2:07:49] we're not worried about what we feel the
[2:07:51] unseen
[2:07:51] force the unseen power of the holy ghost
[2:07:54] is set on our wings and we're just
[2:07:55] flying high
[2:07:57] amen let's just bow our heads heavenly

[2:08:10] is our faith oh god and lord we don't
[2:08:13] even live by our own faith but we live
[2:08:14] by the faith of the son of god who loved
[2:08:16] us and died for us
[2:08:18] lord and we're trusting in that right
[2:08:20] now god to overcome all the senses
[2:08:22] all these senses that we deal with every
[2:08:24] day and the different things that we
[2:08:25] fight and
[2:08:27] in all these different things father but
[2:08:29] lord you're more than able

[2:09:00] way you can your life can just
[2:09:02] let itself be expressed through us lord

[2:09:08] and feel and
[2:09:09] smell and taste and our conscience can
[2:09:12] be clear lord our reasoning
[2:09:14] could be only with the word of god lord

[2:09:18] upon heaven lord our imaginations are
