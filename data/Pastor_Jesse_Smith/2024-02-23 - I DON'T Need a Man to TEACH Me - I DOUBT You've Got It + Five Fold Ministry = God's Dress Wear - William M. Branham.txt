TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh please church have faith just a little while see you must come under teachings you see I don't need no one to teach me if the Holy Ghost has come my friend that that gives me just a little room to doubt whether you've really got or not see see the way you're acting with it see see the same you're doing now why if there is no if the Bible said the a holy spirit is the teacher why did the Holy Spirit put teach in the church stand to set the church in har the same holy spirit amen sure we don't need any seminaries to go around a big bunch of man to look out these things the holy spirit is a teacher see it's a teacher and it gives a some fellow a gift of teaching then you must be subject to that gift if here's some man to when we're going here and he's got a gift of healing Faith and Healing and I'm sick I walk up to him and say brother what must I do he stands there he's a prophet and he stands there with a gift he said thus sayith the Lord William Brandon you know you've done a certain thing day before yesterday in a certain place and that's the reason you're sick today because you did something I'm subject to that gift I ain't going to say oh you're wrong I don't care what you say I know who I am not I'll die in that condition see I've done something wrong now the things me do when I see that I'm wrong I say yes my dear brother the holy spirit's upon you and that's the truth I did wrong you pray for me and I'm going to ask God to forgive me so that I can be right with God now you're getting back on the heeing line now God fortified his army what with himself in the form of prophets Apostles teachers pastors what do you do what was God doing listen did you ever think what that offices of the church is it's God's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a Seer for seeing before Satan never gets to it done told it what is it God dressed up in his church these offices is God's dress wear when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelist what is that that's God's Dr way God's presence God's spirit in working through man and if that office denies any of this word then it's not God dressing amen amen hallelujah that's that wolf and sheep's clothing watch that fell we of him but when he just takes what the word says remember that's God because to speaking his word but it says well it isn't oh get going sheep get going amen God only use his man to work with he doesn't use organizations he doesn't use Machinery he could have done it but he chose a man right he could chose the Stars the wind or anything to preach the gospel but he chose man he does not change himself he always the same God won't leave his program that's the reason we know that this day it's got to be simple amen amen see now he always works in Simplicity yes but God in the beginning that could have made the sun preach the gospel or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preach the gospel but he ordained man for that purpose and he never changes it he never ordained in he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups a man he ordained man to preach the gospel amen not Machinery mechanical devices or any Angelic being it was man and when he brought Deliverance to the people down there he sent a simple human being born of a simple family and a bunch of slaves oh my what a God he is unfolding himself in simplicity
