[0:02] and that hope I anchor to the soul
[0:05] that's steadfast and sure in time of
[0:08] storm and when the storms come the Great
[0:11] Waves are rolling we feel that by faith
[0:13] in him we can caress every
[0:17] wave greetings friends in the matchless
[0:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:22] purpose of this video is to share an
[0:24] inspired Bible thought I had a few years
[0:26] ago about the 13 metaphors of the Judas
[0:29] Escape Group which is the make Believers
[0:32] group if you'd like to hear the full
[0:34] sermon on this it was from August 14th
[0:38] 2022 and friends this makeb believer
[0:41] group is a wonderful Bible teaching
[0:42] brother bandham showed he labored on it
[0:45] at length in the church age book but he
[0:47] also taught it numerous times during his
[0:50] lifetime during his regular Ministry
[0:52] during his ministry he called it three
[0:53] kinds of Believers but then in the
[0:55] church age book he said there's another
[0:56] class of Believers so we find there's
[0:59] two kinds of believers and then two
[1:00] kinds of
[1:01] unbelievers but first my name is Pastor
[1:03] Jesse Smith I'm pastor of bride of
[1:05] Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio and
[1:08] I've been pastoring here for 17 years
[1:10] and I defend the Bible revelations that
[1:12] Jesus Christ revealed to his true
[1:14] Prophet brother William brandham and I
[1:16] also defend brother branham's Godly
[1:18] character so the inspiration from this
[1:20] video came of course from Brother
[1:21] branham's preaching and teaching about
[1:23] the three kinds of Believers then He
[1:25] adjusted it and said there was four
[1:27] classes of people in the church Church
[1:30] age book and this is in chapter 7 of the
[1:32] church age book The sardian Church age
[1:35] page 279 brother Ram talked about the
[1:38] bride being the first class of believer
[1:39] and then he said secondly there's
[1:41] another class these are the foolish
[1:44] virgins and Lord willing perhaps at some
[1:46] point I'll make a video on these four
[1:48] groups it's an extensive study it's
[1:50] fully taught in the scriptures it's most
[1:53] clearly seen in Jesus's parable of the
[1:55] four grounds from Matthew Chapter 13 but
[1:57] by God's grace let's look at this
[1:58] there's 13 met metaphors of the Judas es
[2:01] scarit group but of course as true
[2:03] believers we can take the positive
[2:05] application of these metaphors which
[2:06] we'll do at the end by God's grace and
[2:09] as you heard in the introduction brother
[2:10] Ram said a metaphor will crest every
[2:13] wave of life every storm of life that's
[2:16] a metaphor and a metaphor is a figure of
[2:19] speech in which a word or phrase
[2:20] literally denoting one kind of object or
[2:22] idea is used in place of another to
[2:25] suggest a likeness or analogy between
[2:27] them you might also call it a similary
[2:30] its figurative language so the figure is
[2:33] we're in a storm on the sea of life and
[2:36] will crest every wave we'll Crest every
[2:38] trial we'll make it through every trial
[2:40] by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:43] remember that Revelation 3:5 says Jesus
[2:46] says if you don't overcome he will blot
[2:48] out your name from The Book of Life of
[2:50] course this is what happened to Judas es
[2:52] scarat brother Ram said he was called to
[2:54] the highest office in the entire Bible
[2:56] the Apostle and he forsook that calling
[2:59] he fell from that office another man
[3:01] took his place Mathias and this proves
[3:04] Jesus blotted out judas's Garrett's name
[3:06] from The Book of Life so it also proves
[3:09] that people can have their names in The
[3:10] Book of Life and then lose salvation
[3:13] just like the Old Testament Exodus 32:
[3:16] 32 and 33 God told Moses they who sin he
[3:20] would blot their names out of the book
[3:22] of life so we see this is a Genesis to
[3:25] Revelation teaching that people can lose
[3:27] their salvation so we know the
[3:29] Calvinists go too far saying a person
[3:31] can never lose their salvation of course
[3:33] this is from the perspective of man but
[3:35] in God's eyes the elect the True
[3:38] Believers like you and I we can never
[3:40] lose our Salvation because of God's forn
[3:42] knowledge God knew we would never betray
[3:44] the faith we would never leave the faith
[3:47] we would never do any of these 13
[3:49] negative metaphors we'll do the opposite
[3:51] we'll do the positive element to these
[3:52] metaphors as again we'll show at the end
[3:54] of this video so let's begin the first
[3:57] metaphor is Shipwrecked faith this is
[4:00] what happened to Judas es scarat this is
[4:02] found in 1 Timothy
[4:03] 1:19 holding faith and a good conscience
[4:07] which some having put away concerning
[4:09] Faith have made Shipwrecked here's the
[4:12] first metaphor being Shipwrecked a
[4:14] person doesn't make it to their
[4:16] destination and then Paul named two of
[4:19] them hus and Alexander but of course
[4:21] this happened to judas's scarat he never
[4:23] made it to Pentecost brother Ram taught
[4:25] us Shipwrecked Faith does not make it to
[4:27] its destination Shipwrecked Faith
[4:29] blasphemes the truth by going against
[4:32] one's conscience and this is just like
[4:34] Jesus taught in Luke 8:13 the second
[4:37] type of ground the rocky ground they
[4:40] receive the word of God with joy in Luke
[4:42] 8:13 but they have no root which for a
[4:45] while believe and in a time of
[4:47] Temptation fall away that's what
[4:49] happened to judas's scarat so Jesus said
[4:51] people can believe for a while but then
[4:53] Fall Away of course falling away is
[4:56] another metaphor we'll get too
[4:58] soon second metaphor is Waring against
[5:02] God this is seen in numerous places one
[5:04] of them is acts
[5:06] 539 gilia said but if it be of God you
[5:09] cannot overthrow it less happily ye be
[5:11] found even to fight against God 1 Peter
[5:14] 2:11 says fleshly lust which war against
[5:17] the soul so giving into fleshly lust
[5:20] causes a personal civil war against your
[5:22] soul Romans 7:23 through2 Paul said I
[5:27] see another law my members War in
[5:29] against the law of my mind Paul says we
[5:32] should be in the Warfare of the Lord in
[5:34] 1 Corinthians 9:7 who goeth a Warfare
[5:37] any time at his own charges 2
[5:40] Corinthians 10:4 for the weapons of our
[5:42] Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[5:44] through God to the pulling down to
[5:46] strongholds 2 Timothy 2:3 therefore
[5:50] endure hardness as a good soldier of
[5:52] Jesus Christ no man that Warth and
[5:54] Tangle himself with the Affairs of this
[5:56] life God has chosen us to be a soldier
[5:59] of of the Cross Paul said in 2 Timothy
[6:01] 4:7 I fought a good
[6:03] fight the third metaphor is falling away
[6:06] of course Jesus mentioned this earlier
[6:08] in Luke
[6:09] 8:13 you also see it in 2 Thessalonians
[6:12] 2:3 let no man deceive you by any means
[6:14] for that day should not come except
[6:16] there come a falling away first Judas
[6:18] fell away he was an apostate he was a
[6:22] Defector he went out at the last supper
[6:25] and did not go to Pentecost 1 John 2:19
[6:29] they went out from us but they were not
[6:31] of us of course this reminds us of many
[6:32] people who've left good Godly Holy Ghost
[6:35] filled message churches the people that
[6:38] have left these good churches they've
[6:40] Fallen away they've gone apostate they
[6:43] are fighting against God 1 Timothy 4:1
[6:46] says in the latter times some shall
[6:48] depart from the faith giving heed to
[6:50] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[6:53] second Timothy 4:10 for Deus hath
[6:55] forsaken me having loved this present
[6:57] world so again this third metaphors is
[7:00] either falling away a deserter an
[7:02] apostate or running away so Deus was an
[7:06] apostate Deus had forsaken
[7:10] Paul the fourth metaphor is offended or
[7:14] stumbled this is found in Matthew
[7:18] 1321 again speaking of the Stony ground
[7:21] Jesus said he dth for a while but when
[7:24] tribulation or persecution ariseth
[7:26] because of the word by and by he's
[7:28] offended offended means to stumble to
[7:31] fall to be ens
[7:33] snared then Jesus said in Matthew 11:6
[7:36] blessed is he who shall not be offended
[7:39] in
[7:39] me of course we know the Pharisees
[7:42] Sadducees and so forth stumbled at Jesus
[7:45] verse Peter 2:8 said he was a stone of
[7:47] stumbling a rock of offense even to them
[7:50] which stumble at the word of God being
[7:52] disobedient many people today stumble at
[7:55] brother bram's Ministry they don't
[7:57] search the scriptures enough to see
[7:59] where his ministry is fully bible-based
[8:01] by the grace of God and they become
[8:03] offended at some of the Bible teachings
[8:05] from God's Prophet the fifth metaphor is
[8:08] cut off this is found in John
[8:12] 155 if a man abide not in me he's cast
[8:15] forth as a branch so cast forth means to
[8:19] throw or let
[8:20] go this is what judas's scarat did he
[8:24] was cast off from Christ the vine Jesus
[8:27] said I am the vine ye the branches
[8:29] reminds us of Cain who was cut off from
[8:31] the presence of God he left the presence
[8:33] of God the sixth metaphor is being Cast
[8:36] Away Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[8:39] 9:27 I keep my body and bring it into
[8:42] subjection lest by any means when I
[8:45] preach to others I myself should be a
[8:47] Cast Away Cast Away means rejected not
[8:50] standing the test not approved unfit
[8:55] for the seventh metaphor is returning
[8:58] back to Sodom
[9:00] Jesus warned everyone of this in Luke
[9:03] 177
[9:06] 31-33 Jesus said he that is in the field
[9:09] let him likewise not return back
[9:12] remember Lot's
[9:14] wife so Mrs lot attempted to return back
[9:17] to Sodom to save her life to save her
[9:20] family
[9:21] members but Jesus said don't return back
[9:24] to Sodom don't return back to your past
[9:28] life
[9:29] and this is a warning of course of our
[9:31] Lord Jesus Christ it's a warning to not
[9:34] be like judas's scarat to not be like
[9:36] Mrs
[9:39] lot the eighth metaphor is itching ears
[9:42] from 2 Timothy
[9:45] 42-4 Paul told Timothy to preach the
[9:47] word exhort with all longsuffering and
[9:50] Doctrine for the time will come when
[9:51] they will not endure sound Doctrine but
[9:54] after their own lust shall they Heap to
[9:56] themselves teachers having itching ears
[9:58] and they shall turn turn away their ears
[10:00] from the truth and shall be turned into
[10:02] fables Heap means to accumulate in piles
[10:06] and itch means to scratch or
[10:09] tickle so they accumulate the wrong
[10:12] teachers they pile up all the wrong
[10:15] sermons and they have itching ears they
[10:17] tickle their ears and they no longer
[10:19] accept the truth they're turn to
[10:23] fables the ninth metaphor is the
[10:25] hardening heart this is found in Hebrews
[10:29] 3
[10:30] 6-8 scripture says Harden not your
[10:32] hearts as in the provocation or the day
[10:35] of Temptation Harden means stubborn
[10:37] which is
[10:39] self-willed and this happened during the
[10:41] second stage of Israel's Exodus this was
[10:43] the Wilderness or this was the second
[10:45] stage of Grace called sanctification for
[10:48] New Testament
[10:50] Believers so a hardened heart is a
[10:52] stubborn heart against the truth of
[10:54] God's word Hebrews 3:12 said take heed
[10:56] Brethren lest there be in any of you an
[10:58] evil evil heart of unbelief in departing
[11:01] from the Living God so believer should
[11:03] have an heart of Flesh the scripture
[11:05] says and we should let the Holy Spirit
[11:07] right Upon Our fleshly tables of the
[11:10] heart the word of God as 2 Corinthians
[11:13] 3:3 says with the spirit of the Living
[11:16] God not in tables of stone but in
[11:18] fleshly tables of the heart this must
[11:20] mean an obedient heart and not a
[11:22] rebellious
[11:23] heart the 10th metaphor is crucifying
[11:26] Jesus aresh this is B basically What
[11:29] Judas a scariot did selling him out to
[11:32] be arrested and crucified it's found in
[11:34] Hebrews
[11:36] 64-6 it's found in Hebrews 6
[11:39] 4-12 verse 6 says if they shall fall
[11:41] away to renew them again unto repentance
[11:43] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[11:45] Son of God aresh and put him to an open
[11:49] shame so someone who crucifies Jesus
[11:52] aresh puts him to an open shame they
[11:55] publicly disgrace the word of God for
[11:58] their day they do it publicly on their
[12:01] videos on their Twitter account on
[12:04] Facebook they crucify the word of God
[12:07] for their day a very serious warning
[12:09] here from Hebrews chapter
[12:11] 6 the 11th metaphor is trampling
[12:15] underfoot the Son of God this is found
[12:18] in Hebrews 10:29 of how much sore
[12:20] punishment suppose ye shall he be
[12:22] thought worthy who hath trotten
[12:24] underfoot the Son of God and hath
[12:26] counted the blood of the Covenant
[12:28] wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy
[12:30] thing and ha done despite unto the
[12:32] spirit of Grace So in this metaphor it's
[12:35] trampling underfoot the Son of God so
[12:39] stomping on the truth of the Holy Ghost
[12:42] doing the opposite of the spirit of
[12:44] Grace reaching the second stage of
[12:46] sanctification because the Bible said
[12:48] wherewith he was Sanctified and then he
[12:50] Trot in underfoot the Son of God aresh
[12:53] so this Judas scarit group even today
[12:56] reaches the second stage of
[12:57] sanctification but then tramples
[12:59] underfoot the truth of the Holy Ghost
[13:02] and they disobey the spirit of Grace
[13:03] they don't go further into the third
[13:05] work of Grace the baptism of the Holy
[13:07] Ghost but their faith gets Shipwrecked
[13:10] and they fight against the word of God
[13:12] for their
[13:13] day the 12th metaphor is entangled again
[13:17] so we see entangling this is found in 2
[13:20] Peter
[13:21] 220 2 Peter 29 is important also because
[13:24] these false teachers promise them
[13:26] Liberty many people that have left the
[13:28] message say they have more Liberty but
[13:30] it's not true Liberty it's a deceptive
[13:33] Liberty where they're allowed to sin in
[13:35] other words Grace has been turned into
[13:38] lasciviousness as Jude verse 4 says
[13:41] these false teachers promise them
[13:43] Liberty give them a false Liberty to sin
[13:47] and they're brought into bondage to sin
[13:48] according to 2 Peter 2:19 but 2 Peter
[13:51] 2:20 says for if after they have escaped
[13:54] the pollutions of the world through the
[13:55] knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[13:57] Christ they are again ATT Tangled
[13:59] therein and overcome and the latter end
[14:02] is worse with them than the beginning so
[14:04] the Bible says people can become clean
[14:07] and escape the erors of life according
[14:10] to 2 Peter 2:18 but then they can fall
[14:12] under false teachers and those false
[14:14] teachers bring them back into bondage so
[14:17] they escape bondage but then they are
[14:18] brought back in bondage again so again
[14:22] entangled in bondage and their latter
[14:25] end is worse than their beginning and
[14:28] Peter calls it a dog returned to his own
[14:31] vomit again and a s that was washed to
[14:33] her wallowing in the me that's in 2
[14:36] Peter 2 verse 22 again reminding us of
[14:38] Lot's wife and judas's scarat the 13th
[14:42] and final metaphor is uprooted or
[14:44] plucked up this is found in Jude
[14:48] 1:
[14:50] 10-13 speaks of Cain balum and
[14:54] Kora the Bible said they are trees whose
[14:57] fruit withereth without fruit fruit
[14:59] twice dead plucked up by the roots Cain
[15:02] refused the perfect will of God the
[15:04] blood
[15:05] sacrifice bam desired the permissive
[15:07] will of God for money and core rebelled
[15:11] against Moses for personal
[15:14] position so they were uprooted out of
[15:17] the people of God they were separated
[15:19] from the people of God they chose not to
[15:22] remain planted in the word of God in the
[15:24] truth in the message of their hour the
[15:27] positive element ISS 1 veres 1-3 a man
[15:31] that walks in the counsil of The Godly
[15:33] he Delights in the law of God he
[15:35] meditates in it day and night he's like
[15:37] a tree planted by the rivers of water
[15:40] and brings forth his fruit in due
[15:43] season so now let's go through the
[15:45] positive element to these metaphors so
[15:47] the first metaphor Shipwrecked our ships
[15:50] as Believers will not wreck because
[15:52] Jesus is in our ship we will reach our
[15:56] destination the second metaphor you you
[15:58] and I will war against the devil and
[16:00] fight for Christ the third metaphor you
[16:03] and I will abide with Christ for we've
[16:06] deserted the world we've run to Jesus
[16:08] Jesus is our City of Refuge fourth God
[16:11] will keep our feet from stumbling we
[16:14] will not stumble or be offended by the
[16:16] word of God fifth we'll remain attached
[16:19] to Christ the branch and then we be
[16:21] gathered into his Garner six we will
[16:24] stand every test and be approved unto
[16:28] God we will not be Cast Away seventh we
[16:32] will remain out of Sodom like Abraham
[16:35] and pray for the Lots in our lives we
[16:38] will not return back to Sodom or have
[16:40] any part of Sodom eighth we will not
[16:43] have itching ears our ears will hear
[16:46] what the spirit is saying to the
[16:47] churches and reject anything contrary
[16:50] wise ninth we will let the Holy Ghost
[16:53] write his word upon the fleshly tables
[16:55] of our hearts we will not have hard
[16:57] hearts 10th we will crucify our
[17:00] affections and lust thereof and show
[17:03] forth the death of Christ in our lives
[17:06] we will not crucify Christ the word of
[17:09] our day 11th we will allow the Lord to
[17:12] put every devil under our feet we will
[17:15] not trample underfoot the word of God
[17:18] 12th we will remain free from Satan's
[17:21] tangling traps for he whom the son is
[17:24] set free is free indeed we will not be
[17:27] entangled again in The Heirs of sin and
[17:30] 13th we will remain planted in the word
[17:33] of God growing up into Christ in all
[17:35] things drinking of his holy Waters we
[17:38] will not be uprooted or plucked up we
[17:41] will not
[17:42] Wither in closing friends I hope this
[17:45] video has been a blessing this thought
[17:47] has kind of been returning to me the
[17:48] last few weeks so take courage here's 13

[17:53] encouraged by to help you overcome by
[17:56] the grace of God and the Bible says our
[17:59] Victory is our faith faith is a
[18:01] revelation faith is a substance of
[18:03] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[18:04] Not Seen so hold up your Shield of faith
[18:07] and you'll extinguish every fiery Dart
[18:09] of the Enemy by the grace of God we're

[18:15] can be the wise virgin group we can be
[18:18] the group of Holy Ghost filled Believers
[18:20] in the perfect will of God not the
[18:21] permissive will of God like the foolish
