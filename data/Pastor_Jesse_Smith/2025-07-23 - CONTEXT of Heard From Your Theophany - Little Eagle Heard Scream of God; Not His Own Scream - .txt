TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] You have then been formed into the living image of the living God. You heard from your theophony. If this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting. &gt;&gt; He hears that true rain scream of God. Nothing can keep him from it. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to do a fourth recording on the topic of hearing from your theophony. The focus of this video will be looking at the context in which God's prophet brother William Mariam Brandham spoke about hearing from your theophony in the sermon who is this mazdc 1965. The inspiration for this video came from a precious brother named brother Alex. So you know who you are precious brother. Thank you for sharing this profound yet simple and humble thought by the grace of God. And friends, this video is not made with a smart alec type of attitude. I know some people disagreed on this series so far. Some people still believe you can hear from your theophony. And to me, that's fine. This is a minor topic. This is not a major topic such as salvation or the blood of Jesus Christ or the baptism of the Holy Ghost. This video is made with humility and just a love for the truth because I just humbly believe in my own opinion that this thought from brother Alex helps us better understand this subject by the grace of God. Remember friends with this topic of hearing from your theophony I don't see any scripture that teaches it and the illustration that brother Brandham used in context of this quote about the little eagle. Even the illustration doesn't teach this. There is not a single sermon on this subject and there is no thus sayith the Lord statement on this subject. So, as I've said before, if I don't understand something or I'm not fully sure about something, I just set it up on the shelf and then God will reveal it in due time. I still have the same stance that I have before. I think we hear from God's theophony, not our own theophony by the grace of God. I was even thinking, you know, we've sang that song, My Theophony, I Hear It Calling Me, over the years, but I've changed the lyrics to God's Theophony, I hear it calling me. We sang it a few weeks ago, and I even sang it the wrong way just out of habit. So, God knows my heart. God knows I just want to be obedient. I just want to obey the word of God. I just want all my songs to glorify God and to be biblically accurate by the grace of God. I think I'll share these two quotes from God's prophet, brother Brandham, before we get started here. In the first quote, 1954, looking for Jesus, brother Ram says, "The Bible is the foundation of all Christianom. Anything outside that is untrue. It has to be based upon thus sayeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; Now, the ministers usually here is the basic and foundation of all Christianom. It lays right here in the Bible. Anything outside of that is untrue. That's right. It has to be based on thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; So regarding hearing from your theophony, if I can't see it in the Bible, if it's not specifically taught in scripture, then to me, I'm going to leave it alone by God's grace. I'm just going to stay with what's in the scripture because the scripture is thus sayith the Lord. Brother Ram repeated a similar thought in the spoken word is original seed. March 18th, 1962. Brother Bram said, "That's the reason I believe in divine healing. That's the reason I believe in visions. That's the reason I believe in angels. That's the reason I believe in this message is because it comes from the word of God. And anything outside the word of God, I don't believe it. It could be so, but still, I'll just stay with what God said and then be sure that I'm right. Now, God can do what he wants to do. He's God. But as long as I stay with his word, then I know that's all right. I believe that. &gt;&gt; That's the reason I believe in divine healing. That's the reason I believe in visions. That's the reason I believe in angels. That's the reason I believe in this message is because it comes from the word of God. And anything outside the word of God, I don't believe it. It could be so, but still, I'll just stay with what God said and then be sure that I'm right. Now, God can do what he wants to, he's God. But as long as I stay with his word, and I know that's all right. I believe that. So these quotes show brother Ram's emphasis on using just scripture scripture alone solos scriptor as it was said in the reformation by scripture alone it's so important to be solos scriptor because of the warnings about adding or taking away from the scripture in proverbs 35 and 6 and revelation 22:18-19 and also we're born again of the word of god the bible says in 1 Peter 1 verse 23 the incorruptible seed the word of god I'll briefly review parts one two and Three. In part one, we defined the three bodies, terrestrial, celestial, and glorified. The theophony is the celestial body. And we looked at the order of manifestation that we all come in from the mind of God. Jesus's manifestation was different than our manifestation. In part two, we showed a little bit of the context of Bill Ram's quote on hearing from your theophony. The scripture he used in context was 2 Corinthians 5:1. Now, in this Bible verse, Paul doesn't say anything about hearing from his theophony or building. It just shows Paul's longing for that body or that building. And then we showed how Jesus and King Saul heard from other theophanes, but the Bible does not record that they heard from their own theophony. And then in part three, we looked at possible scriptures of hearing from one's theophony. Although I didn't agree with them, I wanted to be respectful and show how other people use these scriptures to teach you hear from your theophony. The closest one was Revelation 5 where John heard from one of the 24 elders in heaven. Of course, he was one of them, but it's not specifically said that he heard from his own theophony. So, we don't want to add to that. We never want to add to the scripture, but I think that's the closest verse where it's possible that one person heard from their theophony. That would have been St. John. But again, it's not conclusive to me. And we don't have two or three witnesses as the Bible tells us. So, with part four, let's look at the context a little closer here. So when I was messaging with his brother Alex, he said to me, it's kind of simple and I'm just paraphrasing his words here. Now the context defined by the dictionary is the circumstances that form the setting for an event, a statement or idea and in the terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed. It's what is written or spoken immediately before and after something. So we need to look at when brother Ram said heard from your theophony. Look at what he said before and look at what he said after. That's the context. So the context directly before that statement heard from your theophony in paragraph 79 of who is this MKZDC? Now I'm using the voice of God app the table app. So your paragraph numbers might be different from mine. Brother Brandham in paragraph 79 quotes 2 Corinthians 5:1. And brother Ram said we have bypassed that speaking of our theophony. But brother Ram said Jesus went straight into his theophony from the mind of God. And then brother Ram goes into the little eagle story. It's the little eagle hatched out from under a hen. And this is taught in paragraphs 81 through 87. &gt;&gt; But one day his mammy flew over and she screamed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He recognized it. &gt;&gt; That sounded right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why was the eagle to begin with? Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way it is with the gospel of the word, the power of Jesus Christ. When a man has been predestinated to eternal life, he hears that true rain scream of God, nothing can keep him from it. &gt;&gt; And this is what brother Alex pointed out here. He said, "Did the little eagle hear from his own theophony or his mother's theophony?" We'd say, so in the story, he did not hear from his own theophony. He heard from his mother's theophony. &gt;&gt; He hears that true rain scream of God. Nothing can keep him from it. &gt;&gt; And that works scriptural that we hear from the Holy Spirit or we hear from God's theophony. The little eagle did not hear from his own theophony. And then in paragraph 88 is the actual quote. Brother Ram said, "You heard from your theophony." Now the context immediately after paragraph 88 is paragraphs 89-92. And brother Ram said, "Let's look at some other eagles." So the context again is eagles or believers who had interactions with theophones. Remember the first eagle was the Lord Jesus, the son of God. He went into theophony or the spirit form, the logos. And now brother gives us three more examples of eagles who've heard from a theophony. It was Moses, Elijah, and Samuel. In paragraph 89, brother Ram talks about Moses and Elijah. how they came down in their theophanes and talked to Jesus on Mount Transfiguration. So notice Moses and Elijah were in their theophanes. They did not hear from their own theophanes. They were giving communication about Jesus's decease or his death on the cross to the Lord Jesus. Then in paragraphs 90, 91,92, brother Ram tells the story of Samuel the prophet. He died and then King Saul used the witch of Endor to call him back. And brother Ram said he came up in his prophet garments or his mantle. Brother Ram said he was still a prophet there in his theophony. And if you go back and listen to the context of this quote, these paragraphs 79 down to 92, brother Ram never said that Jesus or the eagle or Moses or Elijah or Samuel heard from their own theophanes. So this is my thought. Brother Ram just said maybe the wrong word. Instead of saying you've heard from God's theophony, Brother Ram said the wrong words and said you've heard from your theophony. Because all the context shows people going into their theophony, but the context never shows someone hearing from their own theophony. So again friends, the context is so important. I'll use another example of how the context is super important. Uh from things that are to be 1965 December 5th, brother Ram was speaking about how people can have the Holy Ghost anointing them but still be lost. Brother Ram said, "You say well I prophesy. So did Caiaphas. So did Balum. That has nothing. I got the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That still has nothing to do with it. That's just only a temporal gift for you. Now, I'm going to tell a story about a minister's meeting I attended probably around 2010, maybe before, maybe a little after. And in that meeting, a minister brought up that quote, "Only a temporal gift for you." And this minister went on for a couple minutes just giving all of his different guesses about what that meant. and it just brought a little bit of confusion to the minister's meeting. Now, it was okay, but it's just a little uncomfortable. At that time, I didn't know the answer or the explanation to this quote. So, I went home and began studying that quote. And sadly, this minister has since left the message. But when I went and studied it, I looked at the context. I want you to see the very first sentence after brother Ram said, "Temporal gift gives the meaning of what brother Brandham was talking about." Brother Ram said, quote, "The real gift is your soul down in there. See, that was born of God, and that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God." End quote. &gt;&gt; I got the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That still has nothing to do with it. That's just only a temporal gift for you. The real gift is your soul down in there. See? Amen. &gt;&gt; That was born of God. And that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God. So this is a great example of confusion can be taken away if you just keep reading. In this case, look at the words and the context after the difficult phrase or the unfamiliar phrase that you don't understand. So what did brother Brandon mean by a temporal gift? He meant the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the human mind or spirit because he's talking about people that were lost but yet had the anointing. Caiaphas and Balum, they both had gifts to prophesy. So the spirit of God filled their minds for a very short time and then left. So they had the filling or they got the anointing in their mind, their spirit, but it left. Brother said, "The real gift, the eternal gift is down in the soul." In other words, we'll have the Holy Ghost in our soul. We'll be sealed unto the day of our redemption, and our soul will always have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But see, the anointing can come in the mind, but then leave the mind. That's why David cried out, "Take not thy holy spirit from me." In Psalm 51, he was speaking of the human mind. So all of the conjecture, all the confusion, all the guesses could have been done away with at that minister's meeting had we just read the next sentence. And I'm not blasting that minister at all. I'm just saying I didn't know the answer either, and God didn't reveal it to me till later when I went home and studied it for myself. But it's a good lesson, a good reminder about the context of a quote by the grace of God. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Again, I'm not trying to be a smart elk or anything like that. I'm just sharing this helpful truth about context from this quote from who is this Melzdc. Whether someone believes you hear from your theophony or not, it doesn't matter. I think everybody believes you have to hear from the Holy Ghost. Because Jesus says in Revelation 2 and 3, let he that hath an ear hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. So whether someone believes the Holy Spirit is anointing your theophony to talk to you or if it's just the Holy Ghost himself coming to talk to you, we all want to hear what the spirit is saying to the churches and that we are by the grace of God as we repent of our sins daily. We are empowered by the Holy Ghost to speak the word of God, to live the word of God. I think we can all agree we want to hear what the spirit is saying to the church today. Of course, we know what the spirit is saying. Revelation 22:17 is saying, "Come drink of the waters of life freely." The spirit is saying be on fire. Don't be lukewarm. Don't be cold. The spirit is saying rise. Trim your lamps. Make yourself ready. Behold the bridegroom cometh. So let's make ourselves ready continually by the grace of God in love and humility. You know, a precious brother shared a quote with me where brother Ram said, "God lives, dwells, works in humility, never any other way." It's a beautiful quote from the third seal. It's a great reminder for us to always be humble. If we're not sure about something, let's say, well, I could be wrong. And that's what I'm saying in this video series. I could be wrong. This is just my humble opinion. Let's listen to this beautiful quote from God's prophet. &gt;&gt; God lives, dwells, works in humility. &gt;&gt; Never any other way. &gt;&gt; Praise God for the foundation of all Christianom, the Holy Bible. Praise God. We believe this message because it comes from the word of God. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. is never fails. [Music]
