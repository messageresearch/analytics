[0:00] remember Moses also that great
[0:03] leader God should have killed him when
[0:06] he went down there to glorify himself
[0:08] but smiting that rock and said you see
[0:09] what I can do in other words you rebels
[0:12] must we fetch your water from this rock
[0:14] and he smote it and the waters didn't
[0:15] come he smoted it again what did he do
[0:17] he testified of the weakness of the of
[0:19] Christ because Christ was that rock
[0:22] That's The
[0:23] Headstone instead of smiting it or
[0:26] speaking to it it was smitten once
[0:28] remember God told Moses over ex says go
[0:31] out and I'll Stand before before you up
[0:33] on the Rock and smite The Rock and he
[0:36] smok The Rock and brought forth Waters
[0:37] God said the next time go speak to the
[0:39] Rock and he'll bring forth his water but
[0:41] Moses want to show he had a little
[0:42] authority a little power so he said I'll
[0:44] bring you water out of this Rock God
[0:47] should have killed him far God should
[0:49] have separated him now he broke God's
[0:51] law right there C he spoke of the
[0:54] weakness of Christ he has to be smitten
[0:56] the second time Christ is only smitten
[0:58] once now speak to the Rock and it brings
[1:01] forth its water but what was it let's
[1:04] look at the old man he's
[1:07] 120 someone said to me not long ago said
[1:10] God is an unjust God said because he let
[1:12] Moses down at you told them Hebrews for
[1:15] 40 years and that Wilderness out there
[1:17] he let him down and then when he let him
[1:18] go to Promised Land I said oh
[1:21] nonsense no he didn't let Moses
[1:25] down he went to the promised
[1:27] land about 700 years later he was saw up
[1:31] on top of Mount Transfiguration as loud
[1:34] as he ever was standing talking to Jesus
[1:38] before he went to Calvary him and Elijah
[1:42] standing together talking to Moses
[1:46] Elijah appeared to Jesus Peter James and
[1:48] John on Mount Transfiguration he was not
[1:51] dead he was alive God didn't let him
[1:54] down he was in
[1:55] Palestine now look before he died he
[1:59] climbed up Mount
[2:01] Neo that morning when he knew he was
[2:04] going you done stripped Aon put his
[2:07] clothes up
[2:08] another took his own Rob put up on
[2:11] Joshua commanded him to stay with them
[2:15] precepts and when he climbed up to the
[2:17] top of Mount Neo went through the valley
[2:19] of the Plains knowing he's going up
[2:21] there the die climbed up on Mount Nebo
[2:22] and up to
[2:24] pisga while he was standing up there God
[2:27] said look over in the land I want you to
[2:29] see it
[2:32] Moses you could have went over
[2:35] there but you know what you did down
[2:37] after the rock that day you glorified
[2:40] yourself I think that's why it's going
[2:42] to be a great trouble with a lot of us
[2:44] people
[2:45] today go down there at the Rock and you
[2:47] glorified yourself but
[2:49] notice when he got ready to die there
[2:52] stood The
[2:53] Rock Amen he must have stepped over on
[2:56] the Rock there
[2:57] pisga and God there cared
[3:00] him but he must have rose again
[3:02] somewhere because he was
[3:04] alive he's a type of Christ there he was
[3:07] then on Mount Transfiguration hundreds
[3:10] of years later over in Palestine see the
[3:12] grace of God provided the Rock Amen oh
[3:16] my when I think of Abraham of all the
[3:20] mistakes that he
[3:21] made and Moses and his
[3:23] mistakes but when Abraham's commentary
[3:27] was written when the div commentary was
[3:30] written when Paul wrote Abraham's
[3:33] commentary he never mentioned one thing
[3:36] about Abraham's
[3:37] unbelief no no there wasn't even
[3:39] accounted to him he said Abraham
[3:42] standard not at the promise of God you
[3:44] unbelief but was strong giving praise to
[3:47] God Amen my humble prayer is before the
[3:49] grace of God that you're this morning I
[3:51] hope mine wrote like that that he won't
[3:54] see my mistakes that when my commentary
[3:57] is written in my obituary that it won't
[3:59] be R out I made mistakes and done wrong
[4:03] but he'll only see the things that I
[4:04] tried to do for him may they just be
[4:06] coming what does that he'll take the
[4:08] grace of God that I believe in and
[4:10] that's where I'm solely trusting for
[4:12] upon my own marriage I can no more go in
[4:14] and under the rest but upon the grace of
[4:16] God I'm depending yes it's Grace
[4:19] Hallelujah that I'm depending on there
[4:22] was a rock there when Moses got ready to
[4:25] die Moses was a type of the church a
[4:28] type of the organization the law but
[4:31] Moses glorified himself and instead of
[4:33] glorifying God as a perfect type before
[4:36] they crossed over into the promised land
[4:38] and that's just exactly what Methodist
[4:40] Baptist Presbyterian Pentecost Lutheran
[4:43] and all has done tonight they're seeing
[4:45] who can have the biggest crowd or the
[4:47] best dressed or the biggest church or
[4:49] the finest pews they're trying to
[4:50] glorify their organization until God's
[4:53] moved out that's right that's right but
[4:56] remember Joshua was riding the church
[4:59] all time he was the one who Tak them
[5:01] over and today the very signs and
[5:04] wonders and phenomenals that's been in
[5:05] the church every time they had a Revival
[5:07] through any age these signs has broke
[5:09] out in the church and they've been all
[5:11] down through all these Church ages just
[5:13] like Joshua come with Moses all the way
[5:15] through but the church age ceased with
[5:17] Moses and Joshua took the children of
[5:20] God into the promised land and I believe
[5:22] that the age has come now the miraculous
[5:24] phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and
[5:27] power and signs and wonders this great
[5:29] pouring out of God's spirit in the last
[5:31] days and that's the thing that'll bring
[5:33] Faith into the people that'll take a
[5:34] Rapture in faith that'll take the church
[5:36] into Glory I believe it how can the
[5:40] church be raptured when we haven't even
[5:42] got faith for healing yeah we got to
[5:44] have Rapture in faith first that's right
[5:48] how that God moves by his Spirit signs
[5:52] and wonders begin to follow everywhere
[5:54] God begins to move signs and wonders
[5:56] follows God the world has always stood
[5:58] off and criticized from the from Adam
[6:01] down they've done it every time and it's
[6:04] nothing new today that you should be
[6:06] criticized for accepting Jesus Christ
[6:09] and for his now if you accepted in some
[6:11] fanaticism or are persecuted for the
[6:13] wrong thing while you deserve it but now
[6:15] look if you have really God is working
[6:18] with you proven himself by Bible
[6:21] evidence of signs and wonders then you
[6:24] rejoice and be exceedingly glad for
[6:27] great is your reward in heaven yes
