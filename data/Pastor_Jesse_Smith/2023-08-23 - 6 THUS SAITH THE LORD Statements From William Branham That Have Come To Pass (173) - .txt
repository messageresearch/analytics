TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] well the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord be prepared or you don't know what time something can happen greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show six thus saith the Lord statements by God's Prophet for brother William Branham that have come to pass or are in the process of coming to pass there's a few reasons I wanted to make this video first I want to update my sixth video called three Prophecies of brother Branham in order to give more proof about William Branham being a genuine prophet of God another reason to make this video was because I had a question about brother Brown's Ministry five months ago and I was asked could you advise what are the thus say the Lord statements that did come to pass give the date the prophecy was made what tape and how it came to manifestation so I thought I would make a video about my answer to this viewer's question and friends before we get started please share any thus saith the Lord statements that can be verified through personal testimony from the tapes of brother Brenham that have come to pass I would love to update this video make another video about that as encouragement for people to truly believe brother Branham was a genuine prophet of God pointing us back to the Holy Bible to the Eternal truths of the Lord Jesus Christ I want to say also that in Chapter 13 of my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed I covered 30 thus saith the Lord's statements from Brother Branham on pages 751 to 762. I started with six thus say the Lord's statements brother Branham gave about Mysteries and that was the foundation of my book there are 12 New Testament Mysteries the Bible defines as Mysteries and brother Branham gave us six of them with us say the Lord and then I showed eight more thus saith the Lord's brother Brandon gave us on Doctrine bringing the total to 14. then he gave to thus saith the Lord's statements that came to pass to Florence shakarian and Florence Humes that brings a total to 16 and then I listed three thus say the Lords that are in the process of coming to pass or have come to pass that was also what my sixth video was about three Prophecies of William Branham so that brings a total to 19 thus saith the Lords and then I showed eleven thus say the Lord future Prophecies of brother Branham that haven't happened yet but we believe will happen because these other prophecies have come to pass that brings it to a total of 30 thus saith the Lords friends this is just one reason we know brother Brandon was a genuine prophet of God because we do not know anyone else who has spoken so accurately with us saith the Lord in fact I've never heard of any other man any other preacher in any of the New Testament history prophesying with thus saith the Lord and having it come to pass other than Saint Paul agabus from the book of Acts and other New Testament authors by the grace of God and one more thing before we get started there are some questionable thus saith the Lord's people wonder about from Brother Branham and I addressed numerous of these on my 107th video called the brown bear Vision was a conditional promise plus brief responses to other accusations I cover these at about the 43 minute and 40 second Mark I showed over 10 Bible examples of how thus say the Lord's statements are sometimes conditional which is why the brown bear Vision God gave to brother Branham wasn't fulfilled because brother Branham didn't meet the conditions and yet he can be a genuine prophet of God because other prophets didn't meet the conditions of conditional Promises of God in that portion of the video I showed how I believe the tent Vision was fulfilled when brother Brandon preached the Seven Seals I showed how I believe the Ohio Municipal Bridge prophecy was fulfilled because it ultimately comes down to brother Brandon's word against brother Brown's accuser's word I covered the vision of the 300 1000 in brother Brandon's meetings and I believe that was fulfilled in Bombay India in 1954. the mayor Bombay told Brother Branham he estimated there were over 500 000 people in those meetings and the last one was the Arizona cloud from February 28 1963 twice brother random said thus saith the Lord or in the name of the Lord about the vision of the seven angels that was in December of 1962 and then it came to pass two months later in February 1963. so now let's get into the sixth thus saith Lord statements that have come to pass I'll go in chronological order the first is from 1958 the queen of the south in a prayer line and discernment line brother Ram told Marilyn Hickey thus saith the Lord go home and receive your child God will give it to you if you believe and if I'm not mistaken Marilyn Hickey is still alive of course she's a woman preacher with short hair and that goes against the Bible but either way God gave her a thus saith the Lord if she believed and it came to pass ten years later you can easily find her testimony online if you'd like to view it she was a stranger to brother Branham and brother Branham discerned her condition and gave her thus saith the Lord and it came to pass let's listen to the prophecy given to Marilyn Hickey I don't know you and you don't know me [Music] watch your ear claw you know something's going on that's the scene between you and I stand that line you're moving from and you're moving way away I can tell you right now you're not from around here because you're from a woody country where it's much heavy Timber and wood and you're suffering with a female trouble and you've got a desire in your heart to have a baby and you can't have the baby and you come from Denver Colorado just stay at the Lord that's right go home and receive your child God will give it to you the second thus saith the Lord was from May 19 1961 sirs we would see Jesus or the brand said thus saith the Lord you will never no more Gentile Church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign to the church and of course that has come to pass it has been 58 years since brother Brandon passed away and there has been no Christian Gift prophetic gift or discernment gift and come close to brother random's gifted discernment let's listen to the quote is right here among you you'll just remember it thus saith the Lord you will never in any or more Gentile Church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign to the church the third thus saith the Lord's statement is from February 11 1962 the sermon Oneness brother Brown was speaking about the condition of women in the last days and he said I've got thus saith the Lord God told him that the strain of women would come so immoral imputed in the last days they'd be the most defiled thing on earth shall continue to strip herself so by the ram said thus saith the Lord that women would continue to strip themselves and here we are 61 years later and that's what we witness in warm weather some women hardly wear any clothes they basically wear bikinis with yoga pants and even less clothes than that so clearly this thus saith the Lord has come to pass let's listen to the quote from Oneness you're wondering why a rapid women I've got the ministry he told me that the strain of women would come so immoral and imputed in the last days to be the most defiled thing on the Earth right she started at the beginning and Satan user at the end and look what is happening look down through the ears said she'll continue to strip herself and said there'll just be a little tiny group of the very elected it's predestinated we'll Escape that the fourth thus saith the Lord is the vision of the church in the United States dancing to rock and roll this is from January 24th 1965 brother Graham said now it's thus saith the Lord he saw the American Church come up it was the office I ever seen painted faces short bob hair twisting as they walk to rock and roll and friends I've shared this in numerous places but my mother was raised in the Assembly of God Church she was born in 1950 and she saw the progress all the way up to about the year 2000 2005 when she would go to the Assembly of God youth conventions and that's when they started introducing rock and roll rap hip-hop so my mother in denominations has literally seen this come to pass and now almost every mega church has rock and roll hip-hop or some type of worldly music just as division was told to brother Branham and not only do these churches celebrate rock and roll but most of their women Bob their hair wear makeup wear sexy clothes so let's listen to The Prophecy from Brother Branham vision notice just that's what led me to say this as thus saith the Lord the man would say that without putting it in his own thinking he'd be a hypocrite and should go to hellhart some of the dirtiest looking things I ever seen in my life and when the American Church come up it was the office I ever seen the heavenly father is my judge they had on these tattle-tailed gray skirts like one of these bar room girls would go back on it up here hold it up like a great looking piece of paper and like hula dancing paint short bobbed hair smoking cigarettes and twisting as they walked to rock and roll and I said is that the Church of the United States and the voice that yes it is a fifth prophecy is the death of Florence shakarian from 1965 brother Ram told us that on February 17th 1965 he said he had to go to Florence shakarian's family with thus saith the Lord that their daughter is going to die now I don't know the exact date of her death but by September 11 1965 she'd already passed away her brother Brandon Ford told the shakiran family a few years before she passed it she was going to pass now brother Adam's accusers will say it's not hard to prophesy of a person's death when they have stage four cancer and most of us would probably agree to that but the reason it was Supernatural is because all the preachers surrounding Florence you Karen were saying she was going to be healed with us saith the Lord so brother Adam was one of the few voices and the only voice would thus saith the Lord that was going against all these other false prophets who were saying thus saith the Lord she was going to be healed so we have all these prophets saying thus saith the Lord she's going to be healed and we have one Prophet saying thus say the Lord the Lord's going to take her home and who is right brother Brandon was right and friends it's scriptural for prophets to foretell deaths like in Second Kings 1 verses 1 to 18 Elijah foretold King has the eye's death and of course Elijah had the spirit of Elijah just like brother Branham had the spirit of Elijah let's listen to the quotes that I had to come to that family with thus saith the Lord their daughter is going to die too Florence I saw her in a vision it's our goal and I know she's going and I said pray just pray you know there's a prophet one time that's told to go tell a king to put his house in order and he prayed and he spared his life 15 years longer I said pray but so it'll put it just informants you'll know what we're speaking of and it's thus saith the law true as it was when the scene our sister Florence before she went away several years it's the truth and the sixth and final thus saith the Lord that's come to pass as brother Branham said in July 25th 1965 no denomination will ever break up and come back to the word this is an astounding statement here we are 58 years later and no denomination has ever broke up its denomination and come back to Saint Paul's gospel the original word the Bible Revelation that we call the message and so we Rejoice that we have thus saith the Lord we have a genuine Prophet who gave us thou saith the Lord and as message Believers we're so thankful we have the revelation of God's word brother Adam said God can always give us more information about the same Revelation but God is not going to give us a different Revelation for example there will never be a revelation different on the water baptism it's always going to be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but God could give us more scriptures backing that up regarding the godhead God's only one person God will never change that Revelation to God's two persons three or any more but God will give us more scripture more information about the same Revelation so let's listen to the quote from the anointed ones of the end time is predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it or just stay at the water they're going to do it you think them nominations will ever break up their denomination come back to the word it's thus saith the Lord they won't will they go into the Antichrist exactly it's the faith the Lord they will so what are you saying about I have to be a witness and so are you all believers now that I've gone through those six thus Faith the Lord's statements I just want to read a little bit of the comment that kind of inspired this video after I reply to this person's comment with these six prophecies their reply was quote none of it is super convincing end quote so my reply was simply Mercy six thus say the Lord statements are not convincing to you I just said I feel sorry for you how often do you hear people speak the future with us say the Lord and it comes to pass humbly say it may be your cognitive dissonance that is keeping you from recognizing the supernatural prophetic Ministry in brother Brandon's life and this person also commented that they didn't like the If part of some of my brother Adam's prophecies I told the person that's God's way sometimes sometimes God makes the prophecies conditional and I said it's scriptural Jesus Christ himself said in Mark 9 23 if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth and these were people believing for healing from demonic possession and we know there's other scriptures in the gospels that say Jesus could not do many mighty works because of people's unbelief so it just shows we need the humility of the Holy Spirit we have to recognize God works differently with each person depending on their spiritual condition some people will get thus say the Lords and it's unconditional but other thus saith the Lords are conditional so we need to be humble as Christians we need to be teachable by the grace of God and so I ended by saying hope this helps you God bless you in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing I love making videos like this I love looking at the Supernatural Ministry God gave to William Branham I'm so thankful I can preach his bible-based message I preached it for the last nearly 19 years along with 17 years of pastoring numerous times I preached a sermon called we have thus saith the Lord and what a comfort that is to us thus saith the Lord takes away all the doubts thus saith the Lord is what the church is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ because any thus saith the Lord is thus saith Jesus Christ so again friends if you have any of us say the Lord's statements on tape that can be verified as coming to pass whether it's healing or prophecy please let me know I'd love to do an updated version of this video and as always thank you for your support your prayers please pray and see if you feel led to share this video with people that need to be strengthened regarding the message of the hour recently in the last few weeks I've gotten numerous emails about how our podcasts and our videos are helping people to stay with the message believe the message understand the message and that's what we're here for part of my test testimonies I feel that I was born to defend this bible-based message that God gave to William Branham each of us have a purpose in this life and we want to find God's purpose for our life and do it as brother Brandon said if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart foreign
