to them and this is such a great atmosphere lastly we got some pamphlets from voice of God and I guess they have a new app out so it's called the Lifeline app so if you're interested in that you know I'll pass these out I just asked though you know with voice of God I agree on a lot of things but I don't agree on the idea of pastors not preaching and playing tapes so if you see things like that on the app my suggestion just ignore it because brother I've never taught that but anyways I preached a whole sermon on that I may preach it again by God's grace just to kind of give you update on some of the things that have been said and quotes that have been misinterpreted but I'll pass those out too so I've three things that pass out to you over here on the tape just a minute by God's grace okay

Ephesians 4 verse 1 we'd like to continue this series this is part 12 of this series we've been looking at the book of Ephesians it's been hunting the rock to me praise God and honey in the rock so we're grateful by God's grace well look at some thoughts here this morning you know as I just read through the book what you know just pray and ask God to bring thoughts to my mind you know for Adam's messages and so forth and look to go see what the Prophet said I believe it's so critical because remember will be judged by Paul's gospel and if our hearts are gonna be turned back to the Apostolic fathers we need to know what the Apostolic fathers wrote praise the Lord that's what the burden on my heart that's why I preached the book of Galatians last year the whole book and now we're in the book of Ephesians we'll pry Disko Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians we'll probably just go through there if the Lord tarries it's all about that by God's grace visions for one our text will be verses a 1 to 6 but let's just read the first two verses if you're there say Amen I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called now let's reverse to together 1 2 3 with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in let's just have a word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart just make a known to God as we pray Heavenly Father we love you you are awesome in this place mighty God you are awesome in this place Abba Father our hearts cry daddy daddy father thank you that we have a heavenly father who's so much more faithful than our earthly fathers although we appreciate our earthly fathers but Lord you're the ultimate father and we come to your Lord and we read this scripture this morning and see that you're asking us to live worthy of the vocation where we been called to lord help us to live worthy Lord God it's the burden of our our Lord God to keep our lamps trimmed and clear Lord God speak to us through thy word and thank you Lord for the gathering of the Saints we're happy to be in your house that's never forsake or abandon each other Lord God let us never forsake the assembling of ourselves together let us remain united as a body of believers sheep in their Shepherd ultimately Christ the great Shepherd Lord above us shepherding all of our souls or keep us strong and help us to be able to stand and withstand the devil in this hour and father will give you all the praise in Jesus Christ made the church said Amen god bless yous being seated praise God so as you probably see I think somebody gave us some speakers there to help out so I can hear the preaching a little better to help out my voice then sister Connie bought us the lapel so brother bang he sent me a text said well Jesse the church really loves you so I just want to say I love you to praise the Lord and thank you for thinking of me I really appreciate that and that's why I come back you know twice on Sunday every Wednesday because I love you if there's anything I can do to help you out I'd be happy to do that just let me know we're here to help and we're here to serve I know God sent me to a cur and I've no doubt about that in my life I know that God has that's the perfect will of God for me to serve him here in Akron I don't plan on going anywhere in fact I was just crying on my face yesterday saying god I just want to stay in Akron can you help me to be a full-time pastor so I'm looking for God to somehow make me a full-time pastor because I would just love to come here and pray and you know do everything more I just love to get my whole life to the Lord although I'd probably miss some of those children there at Arrowhead I probably missed some of them but I know you know spiritual things are more important than natural things although we're grateful for you know education I'm grateful for the education I received but I would just like to give my whole self to the Lord Jesus Christ and ministry so I'm just I'll just keep waiting on the Lord and ask him to move so and also like I said I'll pass out I've set a timer here so I'll set a timer for an hour and then we'll vote at the end and I'm expecting everybody to vote me back in but if not this be my last sermon here by God's grace I'm expecting to get voted back in this is the voting Sunday and also if you feel that to vote for brother Adam I think he'd be a good Deacon for us Wednesday night we went over the Deacon requirements at the end of service and if he does get voted in I'm going to talk to him and go through with more deacon quotes with the church I'll probably him sit right at the back probably about scottson right now perhaps maybe him to slide down you know in the future but I do want the deacon right there he's the guardian of the Word of God he's the protector of the word of God brother Branham said there's no stricter office than a deacon it is the most strict office to keep reverence in the house of God while the preaching of the word is going on because listen if he if a deacon can protect the atmosphere then you and I can receive supernatural revelation from God during the preaching of the word and God thought so highly of deacons that he had his prophets say that and that's in the scripture as well he has a high calling so I think it's very important and I just want to let you know I'll be voting from other atoms so if you feel that a lord you can vote that way as well and also like I said next Sunday brother Matt Lightner will be here I'll be out in Iowa preaching and then in two Sundays I'll be in North Carolina who will be preaching that time but I'd reached out to brother to see if he would come preach okay Malachi can you switch you over here buddy by God's grace I like to look at part 12 we're looking at these first six verses of Ephesians chapter 4 and Trust to be a blessing to your heart this evening I'm gonna preach on dull hearing I kind of mentioned that two Sundays ago I kind of ended the service with dull hearing I'm gonna preach on dull hearing tonight and of course the opposite is being able to hear the word of God and and that's what we are but I think it'd be good to show the attributes of dull hearing to make sure we're hearing the Word of God the right way every Christian will see that today every Christian should have tension but the RAM said every Christian should have pressure in fact he said when you become a Christian you have more pressure to make sure you're pleasing God your life actually has more pressure when you become a Christian because you want to please the Heavenly Father so we'll look at that this morning and by the grace of Lord I know you'll be blessed so we didn't read all of our text but we just read the first two verses so remember preaching of evens is preaching what Paul preached because the remember brother brand went beyond the curtain of time and they said brother Ram said is every leader have to be judged like that and the voice said yes he said what about Paul he said off to be judged but with his brother BAM said well if his droop goes in so will mine because I haven't preached exactly the same word he said that's it where he baptized in Jesus name I did too he said in the millions screamed out at once were resting on that I remember Paul said that God will judge every man secrets of their hearts by Paul's gospel that's quite a statement God will take the Word of God and the writings of Paul and he'll judge every person's heart by what was written so it's it's an extreme importance that we know what Paul said in the Gospels amen when God shall judge the secrets of men see all those secrets will be made revealed on that day they won't be able to hide any secret so we should confess all of our secrets now make sure they're under the blood of Jesus amen boat you get in some old little missions somewhere you know you might find a whole lot in there some spiritual vitamins God has got them for you to help your spirit up to pep you up a little that's the preaching of the gospel hallelujah if that won't pep up the church there's nothing that will if this preaching this morning can't pep you up nothing will drugs won't work the internet won't work money won't work if the preaching doesn't pep you up nothing will I feel sorry for that condition but there's one alternate repent amen it is the preaching but man said nothing will help you if the preaching doesn't give you spiritual vitamins because faith comes by hearing hearing by the word program said that's what we do he said as no men women brothers sisters why can't we now with one Accord say Jesus I believe you I'm accepting at all how glorious it would be how wonderful listen the Apostolic way of holding a healing meeting is to be preaching seeing what God is doing and then speaking it out where you find faith men and women to believe to have faith in God to believe on God and God will grant them to you this is the way to preach to preach God's Word and while I'm preaching I'm looking for people that will believe the Word of God every BAM says when you find people that believe the preaching he said then you're supposed to speak out the promise of God and believe the promise of God amen say yes I'm healed yes God's gonna humor here yes God is going to say my family or yes God is going to provide for me financially that's what we're looking for today for people to accept the Word of God because faith comes by hearing the preaching amen now remember as we get into this now let's review from two Sundays ago real quick remember the spirits in every church battles I'm sorry that churches mad on spirits in every every Church Galatian Church I just listed the chapters chapter 5 they battle legalism there was people that came in said no you got to be circumcised and Paul said no it doesn't profit you anything so they battled legalism right getting adding it was excessive adherence so adding something on to the Word of God and then they battled discrimination you know Peter was discriminating against the the Gentiles so really those churches can sometimes battle discrim nation they sometimes battle legalism the Corinthian church battle sensual temptations remember the brother was sleeping with his stepmother they battled that and Paul said you haven't mourned so the people got so cold on God that sin didn't grieve them anymore I just pray God always helps in to grieve us we should always be grieve we should always be offended when we hear about sin and say God have mercy bring that person back to Christ amen it should offend us it should hurt us when we hear about sin in people's lives and we should pray for them they battle fanaticism and extreme emotion and and so with the gifts and Paul had to kind of set them in order you know only two or three tongues and interpretations of service and and that they had to overcome that just being over emotional and not lining up to the word amen the Thessalonians battle laziness the history says some of men wouldn't work and Paul said if you won't work you shouldn't even eat because I said all the Lord's coming why should I work why should I get insurance why should I do these things and Paul caught that spirit said that's a lazy spirit amen he said if you won't work you don't deserve to eat if you don't provide for your children you're worse than an infidel and then they battle persecution in Chapter one of that second Thessalonians now the Church of Ephesus I still got question marks there there's not a lot of specific situations that Paul states in the book of Ephesians what's more of like a general letter so you could say witness of doctrine in chapter four which we're in right now and maybe maybe their children maybe weren't their parents because he talks about that in Chapter six he talks about marriage maybe their husbands weren't loving their wives or their wives weren't similar their husbands in Chapter five I just I'm not sure you know it doesn't list out specific battles so anyways you and I well you know in our I for a church a living God we're going to battle these spirits we're gonna battle legalism we may we may battle discrimination we may battle sensual temptations we may battle fanaticism we may battle laziness or persecutions but despite our battles we know we have a conquer we have a mighty Conqueror named Jesus Christ and he sends his Holy Ghost through the preaching of the word that we might receive that word and overcome the battle amen because he wants us to be more conquerors in Christ Jesus amen just because we've added doesn't mean we're lost it just means we're in the war praise God any church a dozen battles not a true church the Prophet said now see we've moved into the third theme now we've moved now into the walk and the warfare of the believer the walk is chapter 4 and 5 chapter 6 is the warfare as he talks about the full armor of God so we're moving in the three themes that that Scofield kind of points out where the believers exalted position hower and the second theme is one body of Christ you in Gentile and now we break into the third theme the walk and the warfare of the believer now let's go back to chapter four verse one if you have your Bibles I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called now Scofield met a quoted Scofield he said we must he said walk in accordance with that position so we have a certain position it's called Scofield calls it the exalted position that we've already preached on and read about in Ephesians 1:1 all the way to 2:10 let's rehearse some of these because these are glorious these are glorious remember Church that we are the faithful how many faithful to Christ in here you don't flirt with the world you don't Lea no compromise on the word you're faithful to Christ your version of the word Amen he said we are blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus you and I have access to every blessing that we know aren't you glad you can come here know a God can meet all of my needs God can bless me with everything I need because I'm in the body of Christ I come to church I come here to hear the word and I have all spiritual blessings amen see that the temptation is all I don't have the natural but we're supposed to forget the natural because that will burn that will gain rust that will gain dust but the spiritual treasures can never pass away man their eternal their memorials amen that God remembers we are chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love we are predestinated but that means predetermined it's already been predetermined unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ it's only been predetermined that he's he's bought me and brought me he's bought me and then brought me into his family praise God I'm adopted he brought me out of Satan's pawnshop and he brought me into the house of God in the courts of God into the love of the Lord and Here I am I'm adopted like Moses was adopted except a better adoption a man better than Pharaoh its the heavenly Pharaoh it's the heavenly father hallelujah adopted in Christ Jesus and now that but we are accepted in the beloved that means the bosom that means Jesus accepts you in his bosom in his heart also it also means the heavenly hosts there the throne of God he's already accepted you there how'd it happen because you believed in His Son Jesus amen see we must walk worthy of all this is this a lot of requirements you better believe that's a lot that's a lot too high calling that's an exalted position who are way higher as we said than the President itíd States were way higher than that our position in Christ is much higher because they're not guaranteed to be accepted above it just by being present or being mayor but we are guaranteed that heaven accepts us because we've accepted heaven amen we accepted heavens son Jesus Christ amen I don't know if you saw this week but I do want to mention that Trump did he said he wanted to recognize you know Jerusalem as the capital now if he does it we'll see because I saw a video where George W Bush Obama and who else who is the other one he there was three previous presidents what it must have been Oh Clinton I can't remember back to three presidents ago Clinton they all promised they'd make Jerusalem the capital none of them did it so here's Trump is saying he's going to do it we'll see but one thing we know brother branham said it's thus saith the Lord out of the Bible Israel is going to read though that temple and I think that's a good first step to rebuild the temple is making Jerusalem the capital that's a good verse step by God's grace and I subscribe to you know what is it called I can't remember now but it's the Jewish people the Temple Mount people on Facebook and they said the best way to start recognizing is res the capital is to get Jews on the Temple Mount praying so there they are by the western wall you know they're praying calling out to God they said the only way this is going to happen is through prayer I mean oh god will hear the prayers of Israel equal hell amen hallelujah there are always his people he cannot cast away his covenant people amen I just want to make sure I say that but it is thus saith the Lord they are going to rebuild that wall I'm sorry that whole temple because that's awesome Revelation chapter 11 if you know your Bible the book of Revelation now we're not this is for the spirit-filled now these are for people who are filled with the Holy Ghost these are exalted positions next we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace glory and God has made known to us the mystery of his will we have obtained an inheritance bring being predestinated according to his purpose aren't you glad you got a heavenly inheritance I might have known I have no inheritance here my parents can leave me nothing other than some paper which is alright I'll take the paper I'll take whatever they can give me I'm not interested in earthly inheritance but it's so encouraging to know we've got heavenly inheritance he said mansions you have mansions and now that you have a brand-new body amen hallelujah you get to walk with Christ and live in the New Jerusalem and never leave his side amen what greater inheritance can we ask for than that amen glory and we have the look that we have the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him that's what we have for our life right now wisdom revelation thus saith the Lord and I'm still not done we saw more benefits we're supposed to walk worthy of all these benefits we are strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man how many can thank the Lord for that for strengthened me in the inner man we are rooted and grounded in love we are planted we live in the love of Christ we see and we also see fellowship or the intimacy of the mystery of Christ which from the beginning of the world was hid in God and that intimacy is the Holy Ghost in the soul of man amen the most intimate place God could ever have is in the soul of man a little little place where he could come in his spirit could come in there and drown the human heart in the human soul amen and fill that human soul and seal it to the day of its Redemption amen and last is my last one and lastly we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him can you say praise the Lord we should walk worthy of all these blessings all these descriptions I've told you we should walk worthy of these that's what he's saying in chapter 4 verse 1 he said I beseech you now who knows what the word beseech means beg he says knowing all this I'm begging the church at Ephesus I beg you I encourage you I exhort you I comfort you calling for you I'm begging you to walk worthy or suitably of the vocation where which you are called now the word vocation we'll get to that and I'll just go to right now it means a calling or invitation to a feast how many like supper something like having a big supper I love having suppers big parties at every time of Thanksgiving we always have a carrion and Thanksgiving so all the parents bring in and the last years I always always bring the honey ham so I'll buy a ham and I'll put in the crock-pot my wife showed me how to put water in there can you imagine I'll learn how to do that water at the bottom of the crock pot and smother some brown sugar all over it and we have who doesn't like a feast I like a feast we love our gather with our families but that's what the word vocation means walk worthy of the vocation the feast to which you've been called - aren't you glad you're called to the feast you could have been called to so many other things but you're called to the great feasts of the marriage of the king's salad amen that's what we're called to we must walk worthy of this glory so that's your Greek definition there it's your divine invitation I didn't put the court on here but I've said it over and over brother Bram said the greatest privilege of a person in this whole world is to be invited to the marriage supper of the lamb and I saw a little false doctrine rises up one time I saw a man say the greatest privilege I ever had was meeting brother Branham and I said now that's a worship spear right there because the greatest privilege is not to know brother Branham thank God for a prophet the greatest privilege is to be invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb to escape the tribulation two feasts with Jesus to live and reign with him for a thousand years amen how could brother Branham be just as equal as Jesus he's not we respect him as a prophet but he's below God God is above Christ is above Christ as king of kings and Lord of lords Christ is the God prophet brother man was a prophet but Christ was a God prophet amen but you see how spirits slipping like that and it takes that it takes that uttering that unction of the Holy Ghost to pick up on things like that that man is not worship but all worship goes to Jesus Christ amen right now let me get back there now look at verse 2 he said I beg you that you'll walk worthy of the invitation you've been given verse 2 with all lowliness now all not so but all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love this is quite a scripture the way for me to walk worthy is to realize how little I am you and I for you and I to walk worthy of the marriage supper of the Lamb pulse is the only way is to realize how low you are how little you are huh how small we are that's the only way to walk worthy of the rapture don't get me wrong faith brings bonus we must speak the mystery in bonus but Paul said well how we treat one another how we treat each other in lowliness of mind that will show that we're walking worthy of the imitation of the rapture look at some of these words here I'm gonna go through these words he said I beg you walk worthy with all lowliness and meekness and long-suffering now and I looked at I was long suffering as a attribute of charity or love and it's a fruit of the Spirit for bearing and love so let's look at these here now when I saw a vocation I just something struck me as I studied here yesterday when I when I saw the word feast it reminded me of first Corinthians chapter five verse seven eight I said purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us let us therefore keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth you cannot keep the imitation of the marriage supper and have malice in your heart towards people anger hatred right you cannot have this that that's not keeping the feast that's actually rejecting the feast any wickedness any sin any any little compromising any wickedness keeps you out of the feast you're not in the feast because that's not keeping it with sincerity amen and I love this thought here if we're still keeping the Passover then it must be token time it was the time for the Holy Ghost to fill people's souls amen spiritually spiritually Paul says were still keeping the Passover we're still keeping that spiritual Passover of the death angel passing over you and I rather have said having the token he says it's knowing that every things alright amen you've got your ticket you're on the plane he says you're on the train nobody can take you off the tray because you've got the token amen you can show to the engineer I've got it the tickets been paid Christ paid for my ticket on the cross a man and I were looking worthy I want worthy he's given me the ticket he's seen my sincerity and I'm keeping the feast in this hour I've got the token going now that's probably too loud there so forgive me we'll have to get that worked out there I don't want to get too loud since I got rid of this mic now if y'all free now because I don't have to hold this mic get all the time I go just all the time I just feel free I feel like I'm a guest preacher somewhere you know but see that thought and see what we're doing here we're tying scriptures together we're tying scriptures together we're tying Ephesians 4:1 vocation we just tied it with feast because it's the same meaning location means feast and next Matthew 14 we're not going to read all this it's a long parable but Jesus give a parable brother Branham preached this in the message as your life words of the gospel 1963 Jesus gives a parable of the rapture and he said the King gives our invitations and people make three excuses for not coming to the rapture the first one is a piece of ground so property they're worried about earthly property they're worried about the earth rather than they're worried about heavenly treasures the second excuse is they're proven 5 yoke of oxen now 5yo gets it you can do a lot of farming with five yoke of oxen because the yoke normally has two right so five ten you got ten oxen you're really going to do a lot of planting they're worried about their seeds and their increase and all these things they made excuse well I've got all this I've got all this potential to make all this money so they're making light of the invitation to come to the marriage supper amen because of their potential to make money Church money should never take priority over the Word of God hallelujah and the third one was I'm married alive well I'm just a newly wedded I've got these relationships I can't I can't devote my time to go into church because of my relationships and Jesus said that's one reason miss the rapture they put relationships above the Word of God amen now the master got angry after that and then he went out invited the poor maimed halt in the blind brother BAM said that was the last healing revival of the 40 50 60 s Jesus had to send one if you listen that is your life were the gospel he says that he likens that to his ministry they have to have a healing ministry the poor of the heart main blind and then he said the last call was to go out to the highways and hedges and compel anybody to come in that's what we're doing right now by God's grace amen that's exactly right there's another parallel passage we're tying these together as chains of truth we're tying Ephesians 4:1 with 1st Corinthians 5 with Luke 14 now Italia with Matthew 22 1 to 14 this is a parallel passage of the parable the imitation was made light of see the going in the rapture is just you know we're all gonna make it oh I got time to make it in the rapture but I'm gonna put I'm gonna put the ground above that I'm gonna put the Occident above that I'm gonna put my marriage above that I'm gonna put all these things above during the rapture and they made light of the invitation to come to the wedding supper of the Lamb isn't that sad they went to the farm and merchandise instead of the wedding that's what we see a lot today the King burned their City which I thought might be Titus 80 70 it might be because he burned Jerusalem and Israel rejected the invitation one last attempt was made in the highways and hedges and the Bible said both good and bad gathered at the wedding the king came in and I believe brother and sister with all my heart I believe the King coming in is the latter rain the Kings going to swoop down one more time and he's going to come into the camp and he's going to take out all those that don't have the Holy Ghost and all those who got the Holy Ghost are gonna go in the wedding supper amen glory he's going to sweep in one more time because we're promised a restoration were promised a visitation a ladder Lane rapturing faith harvest time amen were promised at the man without the wedding garment can see that last call was bringing in anybody that wants to anyone that wants to come and good or bad anybody come to the message of the hour come here but the thing is make sure you got the wedding garment on make sure it's not your works of righteousness its Christ works of righteousness amen and how you do that you get washed in the water of the preaching of the word if you don't get encouraged today there's no way for you to get encouraged today because it's through the preaching of the word that that's done I was gonna hang on that quote for a few services that's a honey to my soul amen now here are excuses what is it is it B is because the people like they did in the days of Christ like they have in every age they find an excuse they have their own creeds you might not want to say well I bought a cow or I go to see whether she'll work out or not or give milk or what the stock is you might not have that excuse the program says Jesus just listening excuses but here's the kind of excuse people may say I'm presbyterian we don't believe in that now for us it could be people than the churches say oh I just don't believe it the way the pastor preaches right nobody here will say well I'm presbyterian I'm Baptists but here people will still make excuses like it every Church and the church said every Church people make excuses we're all hearing the invitation but people are making excuses Christ is not the number one priority see they say well we don't have to believe it like the preacher does we don't believe no such like that well I'm a Lutheran well that don't have anything to do with it that don't mean you're Christian now he talks about the Holy Ghost look at the evidence of the Holy Ghost he talks about which is John 16:13 when this Holy Ghost takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit that comes in you from the new birth you will believe and do everything that God says in his word for you to do how do ya if you really got the Holy Ghost you'll do everything the Bible tells you to do I like that hallelujah and everything the Bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen but see an amen without doing it it's just lip service they draw 9 to Christ but their heart is far from Christ when you can't obey the word of God and you look you will not stop day and night until you receive the promises of God glory he said and all this time you're certainly above above everything if you really got the Holy Ghost you'll bear the fruit of the Spirit now that don't stumble people who've been here for the last few years I've showed how the fruit of the Spirit is part of the evidence of the Holy Ghost I've showed that through the Bible there's just one quote people misunderstand where programs he said I'm taking the Pharisee side and the Pharisee say well our priests have more fruit than Jesus had but then brother Graham cranes that layer not correct it but he just explains it he said Jesus is the only one who had any fruit of the Spirit you can't have fruit without the right seed the Pharisees were not there were seed of the serpent they could not have fruit of the Holy Spirit because they were not genuine seed Jesus was the seed of the woman a man he was the seed of God and both both they're true fruit of the Spirit amen the man said will you speak in tongues you might wash out you might do that you might not but there's one sure thing you will do you will bear the fruit of the Spirit lay and the fruit of spirit is love joy peace faith long-suffering meekness gentleness patience your temple would not be blow up on people just remember when you go that that poisons the Holy Spirit away from you see when you get the place where you want to fuss with everybody you come along too there's something wrong when you get to the place where a minister will read from the Bible that's wrong to do a certain thing and you'll just know he didn't say it but he meant he means they're gonna blow up at the preacher when the preacher says you want to do this but man just remember there's no Christianity there at all when you can't submit to a preacher preaching God's Word there's no Christianity there something's wrong with the experience let me believe that see that's now see by their fruits you shall know them that's what Jesus said see now what I've just done for you Church by God's grace I've just given you honey in the rock for the word vocation because brother branham said honey in the rock is when scripture interprets Scripture and the example I gave you a two N's days ago was honey in the rock about I am the door but we have talked about the open door brother branham tie john 10:7 with Revelation 3:8 Jesus said I'm going to open the door brother man he goes oh that's in John chapter 10 verse 7 I tell you it's honey in the rock just them Nuggets out and shine them up I hope you feel like you've got honey in your spiritual mouth amen because that's what happens when you use the scripture to interpret the scripture it brings you to understanding it tastes good that's honey in the rock amen glory listen to it if you have listened to third of your church age which we preach eight sir they're nine services on it already you need to listen to it but if said that's how you tie scriptures together when you tied together it becomes honey in the rock hey man so there's the I believe we just had honey in the rock we typed this together with that with that and I forgot first Corinthians 5 so forgive me I forgot to write that one on there so that's honey in the rock to me now let's get back here to fusions for one how many grateful for the word of God in this hour I find it to be my strength I find it to be my absolute strength the joy of the Lord is my strength now chapter 4 verse 1 okay yeah oh yeah I got a quote here for a vocation I do have one quote from oh yeah here here's the the one chord I found for vocation there's not many here it is this from spiritual adoption and now when the child was training up so he's talking about being adopted by the Holy Spirit that didn't mean the child the child is certainly a child of the father but if it was disobedient child the trainer always had trouble with it always it was in and out up and down well then this message had to be brought to the father when the father required how is my child progressing then he would have to say it's not doing so well well then of course that grieves the heart of the father and it does today how many know the father's heart gets grieved when the holy freer we'd say in a forum in a symbol brings record and say our children or our adult children are not obeying the Word of God it grieves the heart of God that's right because that's Ephesians 4:30 you'd grieve not the Holy Spirit people grieve the Holy Spirit by disobeying the scripture and it does the day when the Holy Spirit has to bring our record before God let's say our ready hour I'll record you have a record I have a record we all have a record and the Holy Spirit our record before God the Father it's not three persons but it's just it's a parable like the Holy Spirit's a witness here we say my a better way to say it might be angels because you know the Bible says Angels record and angels watch and angels minister for God and so forth so perhaps we could said angels bring this report you know to God the Father just because we're not Trinitarian here we want to say a million miles away from that because that's from hell he said when we become children of God we ought to walk worthy of the vocation we ought to walk worthy of everything that God has laid down for us to do for the Holy Spirit straining us child training I look at my own my trials like many trials you know you do too we must look at them as it's just training for us it's training to get our faith perfected it's training to complete us so at the end of our life's journey we can be what we've always aspired to be amen glory I'm not going to live this life on this earth and look back and say my I wish I would have been on fire like I was when I was 25 what a awful testimony that would be same I was so in fire when I was 35 or when I was 17 or what an awful testimony that is we're not supposed to decrease in grace we're supposed to grow in grace we're supposed to walk worthy he said of everything that God has called us to do walk worthy of the calling that we have of God Almighty we don't want to grieve the heart of the father how many parents like it when your children grieve you you don't like it it all breaks our hearts just have our children grieve us well that should remind us about how we want to please the Heavenly Father and when a preacher reads the Word of God that's the Word of God we must believe that we must say amen to that we must believe all the Word of God now look at lowliness let's now break it on this stop how many were all lowliness that's gonna be quite a thing oh you are all lowliness okay let me show you what loneliness is then we'll see if you want it I sure hope you do it's having a humble opinion of oneself a deep sense of your moral littleness modesty humility lowliness of mind let me say it a little differently if someone has all lowliness they're constantly saying this in their heart they're saying I have my own self don't have good morals I need to rely upon the Holy Spirit in my flesh brother Adam I'll break many Commandments in my flesh I need to make sure I walk in the spirit brother Louis I'm weak and if I see something on my phone if I'm not prayed up I might give in to that temptation I need to stay prayed up is that right we have a low we should have a low estimation of our ability now I'm some great Holy Ghost message field person I we have to have boldness and confidence in those things but if we're to live worthy of the vocation we have to realize that you and I have much trouble keeping the commands we must rely upon the Holy Spirit at all times amen this is lowliness of mind I'm not a very good person in fact sin inside my members amen if there's anything good about me it's got to be Christ amen this is lowliness of mind I don't I don't have good morals my flesh doesn't have any morals then I need to constantly lean upon the Lord Jesus amen now who's got that that we know or you know we want we want to say it we do how many can say I'm getting I'm in training to have that that's easy to say man I like that I'm in training too all lowliness of mine I don't have much strength by the Amen I really have to rely upon the prayers of the Saints and I've got a I've got to beat my body and bring it under subjection I've got to pray and fast I've got a I don't have much moral strength I don't have the ability I've got to lean upon Christ's statement I've got to lean upon Christ I don't have the ability I thought that one would be a real blessing to you lowliness of mind I'm not a very good person what you see about brother Jesse I'm not a very good person I've got to remember I'm very little and I must rely upon his power all lowliness all this and this is with the body of Christ right because this is not breaking into the unity of the church the walk of the believer the third theme is walking warfare this is the walk this is how many of us walk in or act together meekness is gentleness I must have all gentleness towards God's family amen no one likes to be treated roughly praise God no one likes to be demonized undi Christianized no one likes to be treated roughly so let's let's be in training to be more gentle with one another if you want to walk worthy of the imitation of the marriage supper lamp we've got to learn to be gentle with each other the third one with long suffering now that's pretty familiar this is a fruit of the spirit its endurance constants constancy steadfastness can we suffer along with people can we just be a steadfast source of love to people and just suffer suffer with them you're suffering with their weaknesses you're suffering with their mistakes you just stand there and suffer with them and just be patient and just be a light and just be a friend and just be a family member just be a Christian to them all long-suffering not some all long-suffering not some loneliness all loneliness I have very little moral ability of my own my flesh would easily compromise I'm rough at times I need the strength of Christ to be gentle to God's people and lastly forbearing one another in love if we're gonna walk worthy we've got the forbear each other that means to hold them up what's the best way to hold people up in prayer in prayer pray for those that you see hurting or struggling or it looks like they're breaking the word pray for them hold them up before God and say God they're in your hands and do all you can do to live the life in front of them let your light so shine that they might see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven live the life in front of them encourage them yeah like you see if see somebody struggling try to pick them up right try to pick them up do something nice for them encourage them do something because that's how we forbear one another we hold them up before the Heavenly Father that's the scripture but rep said the Holy Spirit will make every movement like Christ remember although eNOS all meekness all long-suffering and all for bearing you know make you Christ like the fruits of the spirit is love joy long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience faith those things are what the Holy Spirit controls our emotions our emotions is not so much jumping up and down you could do that a shindig we'll bring that to you at the middle school I'm I'm teaching Bible club at the middle school and once they turn like fifth grade they just start getting really self-conscious like everybody's watching me from kindergarten to fourth grade I can teach Bible club and they'll shout and jump and say hallelujah you know praise God but as soon as I walked in the middle school doors like this aura of just self-conscious good morning middle scores like I'm like good morning praise the Lord does anybody want to pray this morning and they're so self-conscious they just know nobody wants a prayer I said can we sing no but if I put on like they asked me to do songs and what the reason I thought this because of the shindig quote there they asked me one time to play a song a Hillsong song which they have some good songs they got some questionable songs they're sweet people I'm sure anyways so they won't move all of a sudden I put on a hill so I didn't put it on I just listen to it and they started singing it I just was previewing it on my phone and it's makes me a rock and roll song and pretty soon these little middle school girls are dancing around like that and I like what a change I read the Bible every since they're like oh trying to not fall asleep I turn on a little shindig music and they're bop and hopping all over the place I thought that's not the Spirit of Christ cuz when the Spirit of Christ hears the Word of God that soul shouts amen oh yeah that soul says that's word food that's my ego food amen I'm feasting on manna from heaven amen you see such just one example the the worldly beats of rock and roll will get anybody excited but when the real thing is the Word of God the real thing is the preaching of the word amen then it really shows who's got Christ during the preaching of the word amen so I'm sorry sure all about shindig I'm really realizing in the middle school so Lidia is my first teenager so I can just try to keep her free in the spirit amen and they'll grow I've seen my children grow you know at first they were kind of raising their hands like this and now they raise their hands the higher said that's just how I was when I first got saved I love Jesus I would go to the church service and I feel like this and look around and pretty soon I'd go like two hands maybe look around and pretty soon I start serving God preaching and now I'm just like all over I'm just you know freed as a bird and I got to make sure I just don't go overboard I got to make sure I let the Holy Spirit keep it in balance but before it's just such a but as soon as I got the rock and roll song on man their head banging all kinds of crazy stuff like that because it's all flesh we want the inspiration from the soul praise God because the soul will control the rest of your body amen and it obey the word it'll agree with every word it's read from the Bible see but the Holy Spirit brings you in the operation or in control of God that you walk in peace and love and enjoy with long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience how many you want to walk in peace in love and enjoy if you can walk in that you've reached some great heights and Laodicea I was talking about sister there from Florida and she grew up in Brazil and she's like brother Jesse you don't me my husband we just want to move to Brazil because they treat each other like family and everybody just spends time together and there's not this American spirit over here and it's just so awful but I said now sister and she said oh it's a modern-day Babel and I said exactly right and just like in Babylon there's some Daniels Shadrach Meshach Abednego that still of the Lord that's still our family over here in this country amen don't get me wrong this is a spiritual wasteland brother vain but the way we stay alive is being all lowliness of mind right all meekness all long-suffering holding each other up in love before God that's how we become the family of God and I you know years ago I knew a brother that he was so fed up with America he moved and I told him I didn't think that was the will of God for his life he moved to a country and he'd made these financial investments and was going to do all this things and I'm not gonna give too many details but I told him I said I don't think that's the will of God because you don't have a church and they said well oh we can it's gonna take two hours ago to church and I thought that's not gonna work that's not gonna work and I emailed him a couple of times over the years and I've heard back and I said how is that working out for you do you still feel like that was God's will and he said yes I said why are you still going to church he said no and now his wife is wearing pants cutting her hair wear makeup all these things like that and I told him the importance of staying in the presence of God see they're running from something but we're not realizing they're gonna battle spirits over there - it don't matter where you go if I'm an overcomer in Africa I'll be an overcomer in the u.s. I'm an overcomer in Australia or Germany I'll overcome in the u.s. it doesn't matter where God's placed me if God has placed me somewhere then I'll be an overcomer wherever he is amen because he'll be with me amen we don't run away from problems we face them head-on we face them in prayer we go to God in prayer and Jesus will work it out amen glory don't run from your problem that could have ran for many problems of this church but I don't run from them I just pray and say God take me through this too shall pass this was this will perfect me this will bring me to what I'm supposed to be amen it isn't something that you do it's something the Holy Spirit does in you you see it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own it's subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit oh I wish I could shout the praise of God around the world to that church the Living God where there's Pentecost so moved that's where our Pentecostal move is failed we have some man-made musical clap hands jump up and down emotion when if we got back out on the street and the Holy Spirit doesn't govern our lives to cooperate with that then we have not got the Holy Spirit okay how much we dance or shod I love to do that I love to cry I love to raise my hands and pray but if I don't live for Christ out on the street nothing will happen to me it's not skim milk and that's what our message will look at tonight as we look at the doll of hearing program said this is not skim milk preaching but brother that's what the church needs only life can come by the Holy Spirit okay so let's read these scriptures through with all the definitions with all lowliness a deep sense of your moral littleness and meekness with gentleness and with long-suffering and dorrance enduring with people being steadfast for people for bearing or holding up one another in love endeavoring or which means to give diligence to keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bonds which means bands or ligaments and I think ligaments connect bone to bone am I right dr. Scott okay well that's what guess what Google taught me that last night ligaments connect bone to bone I got I got something write that on Google that's pretty good so see a piece which is harmony safety no rage or no havoc if we live with all lowliness remember how little we are that we must give all of our efforts and this is what I'm talking about at a home like our home Church here we are giving all of our diligence to keep the agreement of the spirit when people break the word of God they've disagreed with the spirit right and so we are endeavoring we're pleading we're preaching we're praying that people will agree with the Holy Spirit and obey what the Spirit says that's what we're doing we do this in love we're we're we're long-suffering we we have gentleness of people and we're trying to keep the unity or the agreement of the spirit with the ligaments of peace holding together peace ligaments like peace peace is what binds us together and we know that when I walk in the room with relevant Oh get nervous cuz he and I have peace between each other right that's how we should feel with everybody we should have peace as a bond they should unite the BOK brothers and sisters this unites the families it's just unites everybody when we have peace one with another this is the way to be prepared for the vocation or the invitation of the feast we must set now here's what I want to get an attention thought I got 10 minutes ok we must have a burden or attention to stay united in obedience to the spirit and the word we must have that burden so that everybody agrees with what's being preached everybody agrees with the Holy Spirit Lord Ram says speaking of tension having know this quote I was praying about it this morning what would you do if you didn't have tension what if you weren't had no nervousness at all to you just think of it tension is part of living that kind of encouraged me when I thought of that if you had no tension you'd be like a rag doll you wouldn't have no feelings who know who wants to be a rag doll for Christ just to push around no emotion no feeling for God I want to feel all that God has for me I want to feel his presence on my skin brother amen I want to feel his presence in my mind and I want to feel his presence in my soul I want to feel what Jesus feels about the word what if you had known ervices what if you had no burden or tension to keep the Word of God he said there'd be nothing you could work on and that's the attitude people get today they're lukewarm why should I come to church I've already believed a message I know about baptism I don't know about these but how much lowliness of mind do they have and the church said how much lowliness of mind do they have how much gentleness do they have how much agreement with the Holy Spirit do they have and how much urine tea did they have with family in the families in the church and individuals in the church I know you know the I know we know the mysteries but do we have this love operating that keeps the unity we should give all of our diligence to make sure everybody has this agreement of the Holy Spirit that all of us are keeping the Word of God there's nothing I can work on why should I hear the preaching why should I play tape at home why should I pray why should I read my Bible ready know the mysteries said that's the wrong attitude that's becoming a rag doll for Satan instead of a living soldier for Christ he said like a husband and wife maybe if she wants to do something and they're trying to work together especially Christians and the other one wants something and then when you come together find out what she's done finds out see the tension really bring you closer together let me know that tension a marriage actually makes you love each other more and somebody tells you well just think of a little wife that went under a lot of tension when he wasn't note so good or that husband went under some great tension when he wasn't so good then when it's all forgiven that's a key word they're forgiving when it's all forgiven look how you feel about him or her now Wow see you've just got to have tension just think of it a feelings what if you didn't have any feeling or no pains or nothing what if there be no pain at all you'd have no feelings at all see and if you have no feeling that one of your senses would be gone see so everything's just right anyhow so God just give us the grace to stand up to it what the tension the pressure we feel the trials in our lives just give us grace to stand up to those see that's the thing if I just stand up here with that grace and stand there say we know that when this life is over the great ones on the other side where we're looking to go to and now we remember all these things that there's attention some people tries to introduce Christianity that you're free from worrying he said no you're not you're free from tension oh no you add tension when you become a Christian because you were kind of a sloppy happy-go-lucky whatever it was not caring what you did did you know Christian has more tension than other people more pressure there's more I got it I got more responsibility I've got a higher calling than the lots I've got an Abraham calling Amen I don't have a lot calling to compromise I'm gonna be totally separated in the Word of God I've got a higher calling Amen I'm free from worry no Christian has concerns they are burdens they have desires now I'm not saying take it to the sinful side does everybody understand we have to worry but don't let it become sinful how you know it's become sinful it ruins your faith it robs your joy praise God it robs your victory we had to be concerned just like attention I had to come to church I always have attention to study that's good I need that what if I didn't have a attention to study and preach I just be reading off reading here reading here right here everybody still awake alright reading here reading here we're dismissed see you later there would be no feeling to it we have to feel with the Holy Spirit sealing this morning amen then we're in tune with the Holy Spirit we have to feel what he feels about the Word of God you can't let it go in this you have to have worried you have to have tension but you can't let it go into sinfulness which is where you start doubting the word you start pitying yourself you pity others you know you're not walking my faith we've got to walk by faith and not by sight so it's quite a balance you add tension but yet it doesn't decrease your faith it just makes you always wondering am i pleasing the Lord Jesus that's what he says next now when you become a real Christian real how many want to be real I love that song that Ashton and crooked as wives I want to be real I want to be like you I want to be true I can't say my children can sing it gerrae you want to sing it tonight I'm just kidding maybe good singing for some time they sang it before here Church and the other sanctuary when you become a real Christian every moment huh you don't take days off and moments off you don't take hours off you take a few weeks off I'm okay with God I'm sure he loves me well yeah he does love you but he once wants you to love about how you behave he wants he wants you to love what you feed on and feed on only the Word of God see every moment brother Scott you are not wondering am i pleasing my lord that's tension that's the right tension what am i doing for Jesus this moment it puts you intention puts you on guard that's what makes you what you are like that Hey how they do yeah your tension your desire to please him makes you what you are it's just the way you're looking at yeah so after all tension is a blessing the pressure you feel don't want to please God it's a blessing it's just the way you're looking at if you look at other side no matter how thin you slice anything you've still got two sides the intention there's the good side then there's the other side I'm saying don't let it go to the bad side keep it on the good side tension oh my what is tension part without tension what if I could have had this tension I wouldn't have had I wouldn't be what I am I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps if this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ aren't you glad a blessed thing to me what drove me to Christ I had attention like why aren't you raising your hands like this big lineman why aren't you serving Jesus Christ I didn't have this tension and I had to let off that tension amen I had to follow that tension serve Jesus and now I just got different tension what are you doing now for Jesus are you sir are you faithful to be pastoring and diecutting and being a treasure and be a strong leader are you faithful to those things now I've got that tension but I accept that tension with a hallelujah I'd rather have that tension then are you making enough money right or whatever you know I'm like you could go with there were many different areas I rather have that tension the tension of am i pleasing my lord I'm almost done I got three minutes so then as Paul said as though when he had tension or something other he consulted the Lord so now brother Burman likens Paul's trouble with his eyes as tension so see any infirmity any struggle or trial you have but the RAM said can be a cause of tension it depends how you handle it he consulted the Lord to take it away from him three times and the Lord said saw my Paul my grace is sufficient and then said then Paul said then our glory in my infirmities when I'm weak I'm strong see as long as it's tension to the will of God all right see we just have to seek God for his answer that's what I told the sister from Virginia on the phone last night if his answer is my grace is sufficient for your tension or your trouble or your trial then you and I should be able to live with that tension because we know God allowed that pressure that tension in our lives and it's gonna make us what we are nobody in here has had the tension of having six kids I know that so let me just give you an example and seven to be if Lord willing if the Lord tarries that's attention my wife has to bear most of that burden but I do take all my kids to Walmart I do take them all to Aldi I know it's like that tension in the grocery store that's attention and then financially and all these things its attention but if I prayed for those children and asked God to give us fruit to our marriage that I know that's the will of God and I just have to say God give me grace for this tension brother man said you were placed on earth to bring forth children that's your pleasure your honor to do that's one of your duties as a Christian bring forth children multiply and replenish the earth see as long as this tension is the will of God I'll be okay I can say Lord you're gonna give me grace for this tension I can get through this trial because it's your grace that's gonna bring me through it now look about Bramson he talks about one time he had a sickness I forget what this was I think it's might have been the me buzz or maybe it was that last one with the squirrel in 1965 when he got delivered from that the throat condition I don't know but I'd have to look this up I didn't have time looking up Loris could probably tell me afterwards cuz he likes he likes to straight me out I appreciate that and now I could solve to Jesus one time when it used to bother me so bad it scared me and he told me about eight or ten years ago so that would have been 53 or 55 he said it'll never scare you again and it never has had no sir I don't worry about it now look I just feel it but I know it's there do you understand this church brother man had some physical infirmity God said it's not gonna scare you anymore but it remain in this body as ever I understand now sometimes people just they just get on a they just get on a little bit of flesh they say oh you just need to you need to cast that devil out using to speak it using to speak it use need to speak it but if you pray and seek God and what if God tells you this is your lot in life right now then no matter how much you speak that's gonna lay right there just like for brother Graham a prophet of God God allowed something that used to scare him to lay there for eight or ten years but God he said God took this scare away of it see it was tension it was a trial it was a suffering that he had to go through and God said I'm gonna give you grace to go through it I just feel it I know it's there now look he doesn't even deny it like Justin I you got it Justin I you don't have it just tonight he doesn't even say that he said I have it I just feel I know it's there but I just go on because they don't scare me no more Dayman so see this is an example of having tension there's my hour let's stand in sorrow so I'm gonna keep preaching forever that's what we're talking about sometimes God lets us know this trial is for it's for my purpose in your life this tension this pressure I've let this pressure come upon you you've just got to accept my grace for it stop complaining about it now I think about me want to be a full-time pastor maybe that's my baby God let's show that to me soon that's just how gonna be my lot in life I've got to handle two jobs I gotta battle these balance these things I would like to just be a full-time pastor but you understand he said it he could have said now it won't be no more just as well as that he said but it won't scare you no more God never healed him of this whatever this was the stomach condition or whether was the amoeba I don't know I remember there's a quart on that but see God let him have the tension but just gave him grace to go through the tension now look I know it's his will that it happened see that he got sick or wherever this condition was it was God's will that he got sick so I just embrace it and say thank you Lord I walk away remember Paul got sick what was it to keep him humble I said I was to keep him lowliness of mind amen I think that's that's a good thought for today lowliness of mind you and I need to have a little a little moral or understand the littleness of our morality you and I are quick to make mistakes aren't we Church in our flesh we are quick to get angry we're quick to make mistakes we're quick quick to sin we have must remember we have a very small moral littleness and we must lean upon God's grace I had a lot more to preacher I'm gonna stop right now I was gonna get the one faith one Lord one baptism but let's just stop right there for the sake of time run Lord if you'll come to the piano when you're ready sir you can switch over Malachi how many love the Lord this morning and appreciate the preaching of the word of God I'm thankful for the Word of God let us endeavor let us be diligent to keep the unity of the Holy Spirit here making sure everybody agrees with God and if you see somebody doesn't lift them up hold them up in prayer to God help this individual help this family or or help help this person help help this child hold them up that's our calling with all lowliness of mind let's just bow our heads here for word of Prayer I'm sure something spoke heart because I believe it was the Holy Spirit preaching today but let's just take a few moments and pray here ask God to give us these things that we need we need a loneliness of heart how many want to walk worthy of the vocation how many want to be worthy and make no excuses for anything I'm not gonna make any excuses I'm going to punctuate every word I hear preached or read in the Bible I'm gonna obey everything I hear let's let's have that be our prayer and that God were revealed to us is the tension we're going through right now is this something we've done or is this something God has allowed and if so help us to see the blessedness of this tension Heavenly Father we love you today again we thank you for your mercy thank you for this word that we've heard Lord it is my desire to obey everything the Bible says I believe I have the Spirit of Christ the Spirit of Christ drives me to the church every time the doors are open as your prophet said it drives me to preach the word but also hear it myself and Lord let it be applied to my life I apply it to my life by grace help me to remember help us all remember how little morally we are were quick to make mistakes let's remember we're not great of ourselves help us never to exalt flesh because you will never exalt flesh help us
