[28:55] grace of god
[28:57] good to be back in the house of the lord
[28:59] as we kind of finish up the little
[29:00] meetings here
[29:03] um just uh grateful to have had the
[29:06] chance to be here and
[29:08] it's been a real blessing to me to be
[29:10] able to fellowship and just
[29:12] uh enjoy the word i guess even up here
[29:14] you enjoy the word you know the word's
[29:16] always good no matter where you are
[29:17] amen let's just turn if we can to
[29:21] second peter chapter one
[29:28] and we'll read verses 8 through 15. lord
[29:32] willing will try not to keep you long i
[29:33] always say that but
[29:34] it seemed like yesterday was i said that
[29:36] that seemed like the longest
[29:38] longest minister so we'll try not to
[29:40] wear you out but
[29:41] we'll just see what the lord would have
[29:42] for us this morning now second peter
[29:45] chapter one
[29:46] and we'll read verses eight through 15.
[29:51] it says for if these things be in you
[29:55] and abound they make that ye shall
[29:58] neither be barren nor unfruitful
[30:00] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[30:02] christ but he that lack at these things
[30:05] is blind and cannot see afar off
[30:07] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[30:08] from his old sins
[30:10] wherefore the rather brethren give
[30:12] diligence to make your calling and
[30:13] election sure
[30:15] for if you do these things ye shall
[30:16] never fall for someone entrance shall be
[30:19] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[30:21] everlasting kingdom
[30:22] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[30:24] wherefore i will not be negligent to
[30:26] put you always in remembrance of these
[30:28] things though ye know them
[30:30] and be established in the present truth
[30:33] yea i think it meet as long as i am in
[30:35] this tabernacle
[30:36] to stir you up by putting you in
[30:37] remembrance knowing that shortly i must
[30:39] put off this my tabernacle
[30:41] even as our lord jesus christ hath
[30:43] showed me
[30:45] moreover i will endeavor that he may be
[30:47] able after my decease to have these
[30:50] things
[30:51] always in remembrance for we have not
[30:54] followed cunningly devised fables when
[30:56] we made known unto you the power and
[30:58] coming of our lord jesus christ
[31:00] but we're eyewitnesses of his majesty
[31:03] amen let's bow our heads in a word of
[31:05] prayer heavenly father lord
[31:07] we just come here for this last service
[31:09] that you've ordained for this
[31:11] period of fellowship together lord we
[31:13] ask that you would just
[31:14] be with us once more lord as we hear in
[31:17] the scriptures lord just once more lord
[31:19] may just come amongst your people and
[31:20] speak to us this morning
[31:22] may anoint me as the speaker lord to
[31:24] just speak
[31:25] the the words that you would have for
[31:27] your people anoint the
[31:29] ears and hearts of the here lord to
[31:31] receive your word
[31:33] lord jesus and may it be a benefit to
[31:35] your children and to your bride lord
[31:37] we just pray right now in the name of
[31:38] the lord jesus christ that you would
[31:40] guide and direct us in all things get
[31:42] glory to yourself lord jesus we've come
[31:44] to lift you up father you said if we
[31:46] would
[31:47] lift you up that you would draw all men
[31:48] unto you father and we've come to lift
[31:50] up the name of jesus christ this morning
[31:52] we love you lord we ask that your
[31:54] perfect will and the way would be done
[31:56] in our lives may we just get
[31:57] ourselves out of the way and let your
[32:00] spirits speak to us this morning in the
[32:02] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[32:03] amen amen you may be seated
[32:06] so this morning kind of want to just
[32:09] kind of continue in a
[32:10] kind of similar line as we mentioned
[32:12] yesterday
[32:14] uh we speaking on opening the channels
[32:17] and
[32:17] just maybe just a really quick recap of
[32:20] how we were
[32:21] how we've kind of been speaking this
[32:23] whole time about how the lord
[32:25] in the believers in this hour is
[32:26] desiring to express
[32:28] the life that he put in the believer
[32:30] he's he's designed to express that out
[32:32] through you as the believer
[32:34] it's not just for a minister it's not
[32:36] just for a prophet or something that we
[32:38] put on a pedestal but
[32:40] it's actually for the believer as we
[32:43] even spoke in the scriptures when when
[32:45] peter would walk through the streets and
[32:47] he seen
[32:48] the the one that was lame and he said
[32:50] silver and gold have by none but such as
[32:52] i have
[32:53] there is something that the believer
[32:55] possessed
[32:56] that they can offer to to people that
[32:59] have need if that remember that contrast
[33:01] we talked about and then bringing it
[33:03] yesterday by god's grace
[33:06] and talking about opening up the
[33:07] channels all these different avenues
[33:09] that god is desiring to express himself
[33:12] in
[33:12] and to to allow himself to to influence
[33:15] the believer through the sight and
[33:17] through the
[33:18] the taste and the conscience and all
[33:19] these different things that we talked
[33:20] about and how
[33:21] the devil tries to clog those things up
[33:23] and gum them all up and
[33:24] we need to take faith in the word to
[33:26] allow the lord and the holy ghost
[33:29] with the fire of the power of the holy
[33:30] ghost to clean all those channels out
[33:32] so that way god can express himself
[33:34] because he's put something in you
[33:36] that he wants to show it's not
[33:40] it's not just we're not just oh we've
[33:41] just arrived here
[33:43] and we're just bumps on a log but god
[33:45] has a purpose for your life
[33:47] god has a work for you to do you know
[33:50] the devil will be right there to tell
[33:51] you
[33:52] oh this is insignificant or this is this
[33:54] or this is that but
[33:55] no matter how small it may seem you know
[33:57] it's just like a watch
[33:59] you know if you take out one little gear
[34:01] or one little spring from that watch
[34:04] they won't tell time anymore so is it
[34:06] with the body of christ that
[34:08] every little piece is important every
[34:11] little bit is important
[34:12] i tell you what you know we look at the
[34:14] body even just in the natural body
[34:16] and someone would say oh well maybe your
[34:19] your pinky toe
[34:20] doesn't seem so important you know what
[34:22] but i tell you what i don't think any of
[34:24] us
[34:24] would just willingly give up our pinky
[34:26] toe it's part of our body
[34:28] that's me that's that part of me and so
[34:30] is it with
[34:31] god's body the bride of jesus christ his
[34:34] his
[34:35] body in this hour he wants every part in
[34:37] its place
[34:38] every part performing the work that it
[34:40] has every little bit
[34:43] has a part to play and so what the devil
[34:46] does is he's always trying
[34:48] to hinder that body you know he's always
[34:50] trying to take it
[34:51] and and pervert it somehow and distort
[34:54] it and make it so it's not fruitful make
[34:56] it so the body can't
[34:57] work the way it ought to but it but we
[35:00] believe
[35:00] we've got the victory in the lord jesus
[35:02] christ amen
[35:03] so this this morning what we really want
[35:06] to focus on
[35:08] is if i could give a title for the
[35:10] service this morning would be i will
[35:12] remember
[35:14] i will remember and as we read in the
[35:17] scriptures here
[35:18] you know peter talking about these
[35:20] things he said
[35:22] if you lack these things you're blind
[35:24] you can't see it far off we understand
[35:25] if we go back he's talking about the
[35:27] statue of a perfect man and all these
[35:28] attributes
[35:29] and and all those attributes wrapped up
[35:31] in the holy ghost because it all comes
[35:33] to to a capstone of perfect love
[35:36] and perfect love has it in all of these
[35:38] attributes
[35:39] so if if that be in you and a pound
[35:43] we find you're not going to be
[35:44] unfruitful but if we find we're
[35:46] struggling
[35:47] then sometimes we forget what god has
[35:49] done for us
[35:50] and it's amazing he says how much is he
[35:53] in just these few scriptures
[35:54] how peter keeps really telling as he's
[35:57] writing
[35:58] this epistle out he says i want to keep
[36:00] you in remembrance
[36:01] he says i want to keep you in
[36:02] remembrance he says in verse 12 he says
[36:05] i'm not going to be negligent to put you
[36:07] always in remembrance of these things
[36:09] and i love what he says here though you
[36:10] know them so as we're talking this
[36:13] morning
[36:13] this isn't going to be anything maybe
[36:15] brand new or
[36:16] or groundbreaking or anything you say oh
[36:18] my goodness this is just
[36:20] to the intellectual mind it might not be
[36:22] stimulating
[36:23] but even as peter said i want to put you
[36:26] in remembrance of these
[36:28] things even though you already know them
[36:30] he said but i'm going to stir up your
[36:32] minds
[36:32] your pure minds by way of remembrance
[36:34] and he says i'm going to put you in
[36:36] remembrance
[36:38] i'm going to stir you up by remembrance
[36:39] he keeps mentioning these things i'm
[36:41] going to
[36:41] bring you into reference verse 13. i'm
[36:43] going to stir you up by putting you in
[36:45] remembrance
[36:46] moreover i will endeavor that after my
[36:49] decease
[36:50] you'll have these things in remembrance
[36:51] so what is he trying to say he says
[36:53] don't forget these things don't
[36:56] put these things out of your mind don't
[36:59] let the devil steal these things from
[37:01] you
[37:01] and as we're going kind of tying this
[37:03] into what we were ministering yesterday
[37:05] you know kind of by the grace of the
[37:07] lord we mentioned we wanted to focus on
[37:09] that part of memory
[37:10] today and that's what we really want to
[37:12] focus on that avenue of memory because
[37:15] in this day and age it seems like that's
[37:17] such a powerful
[37:19] sense in our spirit that the devil uses
[37:22] and remember he's very crafty
[37:24] he takes all of these different senses
[37:27] that you have
[37:28] and he weaves them together to try to
[37:30] paint you a picture
[37:31] of something that's not true so he's
[37:34] gonna take
[37:35] these senses of of memory and many times
[37:38] he'll bring back
[37:40] things in your life mistakes that you've
[37:42] made problems that you've had
[37:44] and all of a sudden what does he do he
[37:46] ties that he doesn't leave it there
[37:48] it's not just enough for you to remember
[37:50] but he wants to make you unfruitful
[37:52] he wants to clog up all those channels
[37:54] right so what does he do
[37:55] he takes these memories and different
[37:58] things that you may have had problems
[37:59] with and now what does he do
[38:00] it's not just memory now he runs over
[38:02] the conscience and i
[38:04] says oh you remember that time that this
[38:06] happened well
[38:07] because of that you should feel guilty
[38:09] you should feel so guilty that you can't
[38:11] you can't do anything for god how could
[38:13] you possibly do that don't you remember
[38:15] that
[38:15] and now he's laying on your conscience
[38:17] and all of a sudden your conscience is
[38:19] down
[38:19] and all of a sudden now now your
[38:22] affections
[38:23] become become kind of distorted because
[38:26] you start
[38:26] you start maybe getting depressed and
[38:28] you start getting down
[38:29] and all of a sudden it starts to affect
[38:31] even the natural senses and
[38:33] we take it to a spiritual place but
[38:35] where now your eyesight seems to kind of
[38:37] cloud over
[38:38] because you're so busy looking at the
[38:40] past you can't see what's in front of
[38:42] you
[38:43] there's a reason when you're driving a
[38:45] car that
[38:46] that that rear view mirror is really
[38:48] small but your windshield's really big
[38:50] it because we've got to focus on what
[38:52] lays ahead and not what's behind
[38:55] but what does the devil do he put your
[38:57] focus on that if you drove down the road
[38:59] in your car just staring at that rear
[39:00] view mirror
[39:01] you're going to get in an accident sure
[39:03] enough and that's what the devil does he
[39:05] starts tying these things together
[39:07] pretty soon your ego vision starts to
[39:09] get filmed over a little bit
[39:12] and then what what is that well as we
[39:14] spoke yesterday when these senses begin
[39:16] to get dulled
[39:17] what if it's a sign of sickness it's a
[39:20] sign that something's wrong
[39:21] somewhere if you can't see who you are
[39:24] that's what
[39:24] peter would say he said if you lack
[39:26] these things you you're blind and you
[39:28] can't see it far off
[39:29] to the point you forget that you were
[39:31] even saved at some point
[39:35] and i think there have been moments if
[39:37] we're all honest with ourselves there's
[39:38] been moments the devil's caught just
[39:40] about
[39:40] caught all of us probably in that place
[39:43] when we're down in despair
[39:44] you know we're human we have our
[39:46] struggles
[39:47] we have trials the devil's always there
[39:50] battering against you every day
[39:51] and sometimes he gets you down just
[39:53] starts kicking on it he just starts
[39:54] kicking you he starts kicking you
[39:56] and then what if he's not going to let
[39:58] up but there's got to be
[40:00] something in there's something in the
[40:02] belief there is something that's just
[40:03] there got to be
[40:04] there is something in the believer where
[40:06] that there's some that holy ghost raises
[40:08] up
[40:09] and says i will remember i'm gonna keep
[40:12] these things in remembrance
[40:14] i'm not gonna let it fall for me i i'm
[40:17] not gonna i'm not gonna just focus on
[40:19] the failures
[40:21] see because there's two sides to all
[40:22] these things so
[40:24] one of the first things that that we do
[40:27] is the devil brings up this memory it's
[40:29] such a powerful
[40:31] thing you notice in this day and age
[40:33] memory is one of the biggest tools even
[40:35] in the worldly realm
[40:36] memory is such a huge thing because we
[40:39] even see it
[40:40] in the political realm and in the
[40:41] societal realm and all these things now
[40:43] that you got twitter and facebook and
[40:45] all these things
[40:46] what is what do they do it's just a
[40:48] natural type of the spiritual
[40:50] when all of a sudden someone that was
[40:52] accepted in society
[40:54] they go back 15 years out of their
[40:56] facebook page
[40:57] or however long it was for their little
[40:58] twitter feed and they dig up a little
[41:00] tweet
[41:01] that they said 10 years ago then pretty
[41:04] soon the whole world just jumps on them
[41:07] that's what the devil does to the
[41:08] believer is he goes into your past
[41:11] he starts rooting around and tries to
[41:13] pull up something that says
[41:14] oh look at this and everything jumps on
[41:17] and starts kicking him down
[41:19] and pretty soon someone that might have
[41:21] even been accepted by the world
[41:23] gets cast out and ostracized it's
[41:26] amazing isn't it
[41:28] and that's what the devil's doing it's
[41:29] just a natural type of the spiritual
[41:31] of the condition of the people there's
[41:33] no love there's no forgiveness
[41:36] and what happens is we allow that to
[41:38] affect us
[41:40] in a spiritual way many times we get
[41:43] stuck we can't forgive others
[41:45] we can't even forgive ourselves because
[41:48] that like
[41:49] uh david i believe said in psalm 51 he
[41:52] said my sin is ever before my face
[41:55] you know if we're not careful we'll get
[41:56] stuck in that position
[41:58] the word where your sins just always
[42:00] before you and it's just constantly oh
[42:02] i'm just a failure
[42:03] i'm this and you've forgotten that you
[42:05] were purged
[42:06] you've forgotten the blood of jesus
[42:09] christ
[42:10] so what's the first thing with this
[42:11] memory is the devil starts
[42:13] there's it's like a positive and a
[42:15] negative version the positive version
[42:17] and i don't mean positive as in good i
[42:19] mean
[42:19] as in adding something to it is that
[42:22] what does the devil do he starts
[42:23] bringing up
[42:24] memories of the past he starts bringing
[42:26] up things that you've had
[42:28] issues with a brother or sister or just
[42:30] little things that you struggled with or
[42:33] places where you stumbled and fell
[42:34] because we've all stumbled and fallen
[42:36] we've all sinned and come short of the
[42:38] glory of god
[42:40] brother branham said we backslide every
[42:42] day
[42:44] every day we we have to ask forgiveness
[42:47] thank the lord for the blood of jesus
[42:49] christ i thank the lord
[42:50] and we even had brother bran with the
[42:52] vision where he was condemning that
[42:54] woman
[42:54] in the little restaurant or wherever it
[42:56] was i had a bit of a gassy i can't
[42:58] remember what it was
[42:58] but and then the lord has to take him
[43:00] back and show him that vision of that
[43:02] blood ring
[43:03] that that that protecting power that
[43:06] keeps
[43:07] the believer that even keeps that woman
[43:09] and gives her a chance
[43:12] and if we're not careful we lose sight
[43:14] of that so what the devil does
[43:15] is he starts bringing up these
[43:16] scarecrows from your past now i want you
[43:19] to think
[43:20] because it's a powerful thing and it
[43:22] happens you can look all through the
[43:23] scriptures
[43:25] i want you to think about adam and eve
[43:29] think about the guilt think about
[43:32] the power of memory that the devil would
[43:34] have had
[43:35] to try to attack adam and eve from the
[43:38] garden of eden could you imagine
[43:41] living eight nine hundred years seeing
[43:44] all the great great great grandchildren
[43:45] how many other greats it was
[43:47] coming up oh grandpa adam
[43:50] how was it what was it like in the
[43:51] garden oh man oh
[43:54] my goodness oh man it was wonderful yeah
[43:57] we didn't have any problems
[43:59] i could speak to that tree you'd be like
[44:01] oh
[44:02] little enoch you don't even you don't
[44:04] even know i could speak to a tree and it
[44:06] would move
[44:08] my name you don't see that line over
[44:09] there yeah grandpa adam
[44:11] the lord allowed grandpa adam to name
[44:13] that line that's why you call it a lion
[44:15] right now
[44:16] and then maybe the little one says but
[44:19] grandpa adam what happened and could you
[44:22] imagine
[44:23] the memories that fight in that channel
[44:27] of memory
[44:28] that they would have had to think back
[44:31] and say oh
[44:32] we lost it all we made a mistake
[44:35] grandma eve what happened i let the
[44:37] serpent get to me
[44:39] i didn't believe god's word and god
[44:42] kicked us out of the garden and now
[44:44] there's a flaming sword turning every
[44:46] which way to keep us from it
[44:48] could you imagine having to relive
[44:51] those memories having tasted of the good
[44:54] things of god in the garden of eden
[44:56] and then getting kicked out and having
[44:58] to live with those memories
[45:00] think about moses growing up knowing who
[45:04] he was he was raised to understand
[45:07] you are a deliverer this is who you are
[45:10] look at what look at this god put you
[45:12] here for a purpose
[45:14] raised for this purpose but then he has
[45:16] to live with the memory of just killing
[45:18] an egyptian
[45:20] of fleeing from the face of pharaoh
[45:22] after all of his successes
[45:24] after everything he thought was going to
[45:26] happen
[45:28] we've all been there i believe god gives
[45:30] you something
[45:31] say lord i'm gonna do this for your
[45:33] glory but we get out of the way we
[45:35] get our own ideas of it we fall fly on
[45:38] our face
[45:39] and we find ourselves running from the
[45:40] presence of god
[45:43] and he had to live with that memory of
[45:46] killing that egyptian
[45:48] and thinking about how he was rejected
[45:50] by his own brethren
[45:51] when he's trying to help them he's
[45:53] running from his own commission
[45:55] for 40 years in the desert just ignoring
[45:58] the call of god for his life
[46:00] what kind of what kind of memories don't
[46:03] you think when he was back there in the
[46:04] desert with those sheep and those quiet
[46:06] moments
[46:07] the devil was right there to say oh i
[46:10] thought you were a deliverer
[46:12] i thought i thought you were raised up
[46:14] to to deliver the children of israel
[46:16] what happened to you
[46:17] oh that's right there's a dead egyptian
[46:19] in the sand over there that you killed
[46:21] you're a failure you're nothing
[46:25] could you imagine and from a natural
[46:27] standpoint
[46:29] i'm sure moses at times would say yeah
[46:30] that seems to be right
[46:32] that sure seems to be right
[46:35] think about that think about joseph
[46:39] and all of his trials
[46:42] has betrayed by his own brothers the
[46:45] ones that
[46:46] you would think they love me they're my
[46:48] brothers
[46:49] cast into a pit sold into slavery
[46:53] no doubt the whole time you know even
[46:56] though he had no uh
[46:58] against himself there wasn't anything he
[47:00] did
[47:01] but what as a real believer you know
[47:04] even when we go through trials
[47:06] what's the first thing that happens lord
[47:08] what did i do you know because it's the
[47:10] desire of a believer to be right
[47:12] and many times we get before lord did i
[47:14] do something
[47:16] did i do is there something wrong no
[47:18] doubt joseph had to wonder what did i do
[47:20] to deserve this i wasn't trying i
[47:23] couldn't help that i was born
[47:25] a dreamer i couldn't help that that
[47:28] my father left me i didn't i didn't ask
[47:32] for this
[47:33] but those memories coming back
[47:35] throughout the devil trying to twist and
[47:37] distort oh you probably did this or you
[47:39] probably did that
[47:40] you know they have a scientific name for
[47:42] that it's called confabulation
[47:45] confabulation means you remember
[47:47] something that didn't actually happen
[47:49] you make up details and that that's what
[47:52] the devil gets us to do many times
[47:54] it's oh well you did something wrong
[47:56] over here and you thought well maybe
[47:58] that is right
[47:59] you start taking his words for it
[48:00] instead of getting down on your knees
[48:02] and getting before the lord and say lord
[48:03] you know
[48:04] i don't even know if that was the case
[48:05] but lord forgive me
[48:07] lord if i'd done any wrong let me lay it
[48:10] on the altar and get rid of it now
[48:12] so that there's nothing between us
[48:15] but no doubt joseph had to fight those
[48:17] battles he was a human
[48:19] we think our battles are something new
[48:21] no this has been going on since the fall
[48:25] and then to top it all off it seems like
[48:28] things are going okay
[48:30] and he ends up in potiphar's house and
[48:32] things need to oh
[48:33] well praise the lord things are kind of
[48:34] looking up i'm doing the best i can
[48:37] and then he's thrown back into jail
[48:40] thrown into jail for nothing and again
[48:44] don't you think the devil was right
[48:45] there and say yeah you know you did
[48:47] something
[48:48] you you know you know this you get you
[48:51] get paid back
[48:52] for all the stuff you did and joseph's
[48:54] praying like what what did i do
[48:56] but the devil's always right there to
[48:58] accuse he's the accuser of the brethren
[49:01] it's his job that's what he does
[49:05] but no doubt he had to question that no
[49:08] doubt
[49:08] he had the memories of thinking wow i
[49:11] remember
[49:12] i remember when the lord was giving me
[49:13] the dreams and showing me these things
[49:15] are going to happen i thought
[49:16] i thought these great things were going
[49:18] to happen
[49:19] but look at me down in a in a jail cell
[49:22] now
[49:24] think about david and the memories that
[49:26] he would have had
[49:28] just raised up to be king of israel all
[49:31] these wonderful things happen
[49:32] and then he goes with bathsheba
[49:36] and sins and on top of that commits
[49:39] murder
[49:41] don't you think that the devil was right
[49:44] there we know the devil was right there
[49:45] because
[49:46] the psalm 51 said my sins ever before me
[49:50] you know that you could you imagine that
[49:52] the torment
[49:54] that had to be there lord what have i
[49:55] done when nathan looked at him and said
[49:58] you're the man
[50:00] oh my you don't think the devil was
[50:02] right there trying to play on memory
[50:05] trying to bring it all back and hold him
[50:07] down
[50:09] absolutely he was and think about peter
[50:12] oh i love peter you think about peter
[50:16] imagine imagine put yourself in peter's
[50:20] shoes
[50:23] called of the lord to follow him
[50:26] recognize that but then think about
[50:30] the battles that he had to fight in
[50:32] between
[50:33] in between his betrayal in the in the
[50:36] resurrection
[50:37] and seeing the lord could you imagine
[50:38] the battles that peter had to face
[50:40] and even after that going to pentecost
[50:42] when when
[50:44] peter and we know he was a brash
[50:46] individual
[50:47] he wanted to get a head up he had a
[50:49] heart like a warrior he wanted to fight
[50:52] pulled out the sword and cut the ears
[50:54] off and just let's get him
[50:57] but then he then the lord says the the
[50:59] son of man
[51:01] will be betrayed and be crucified and
[51:03] peter says far be it from me o lord
[51:06] and he just imagine the one that he
[51:09] called the messiah
[51:10] looked right in peter's face and said
[51:12] get thee behind me satan
[51:15] you don't think and put yourself in
[51:17] those shoes
[51:18] if jesus christ looked at you and say
[51:21] get thee behind me satan
[51:23] could you imagine the guilt and the
[51:26] memory they had to follow peter around
[51:30] i imagine i imagine that there are
[51:33] probably whispers going around too
[51:36] i mean no doubt there had to be whispers
[51:39] i mean wasn't it so that jesus said
[51:43] i have chosen you 12 and one is the
[51:45] devil
[51:48] i wonder if when they heard that get the
[51:50] behind me saying i wonder if all said oh
[51:52] now we know
[51:54] now we know who it is oh my god that was
[51:56] fresh i never even thought about that
[51:58] before that wasn't that was the lord
[51:59] could you imagine
[52:01] you imagine the mind battles peter heard
[52:04] that
[52:05] had that i chosen you 12 when one of you
[52:07] is the devil
[52:09] and the lord says get thee behind me
[52:10] satan oh my goodness could you
[52:13] imagine the mind battles
[52:16] oh i i could i can't even imagine it
[52:20] to have your lord you said they said you
[52:23] are the lord
[52:24] thou art the christ the son of the
[52:26] living god declared it
[52:29] and to have the messiah look at you and
[52:32] say that
[52:34] and then on top of that come back and
[52:36] say lord i'll go with you wherever no
[52:38] you won't you'll deny me three times
[52:42] and then have it happen and then we know
[52:45] that satan played on his memory because
[52:47] as soon as the crew the third time
[52:50] it brought back to mind what the lord
[52:52] said
[52:54] and he went and wept bitterly why
[52:56] because he knew
[52:58] oh my you can't even imagine those my
[53:00] maps i can't
[53:02] and i've had we've all had a lot of
[53:04] light but i could not imagine that
[53:06] oh my
[53:09] think about paul
[53:12] paul greatest among the pharisees one of
[53:15] the greatest of all the pharaoh
[53:16] the pharisees and there he stands
[53:19] persecuting the church
[53:20] standing there at the stony of stephen
[53:23] causing many to blaspheme
[53:25] all these things happening and then
[53:29] the lord says why do you persecute me
[53:32] paul saw why why persecute his thou me
[53:36] it's hard for you to kick against the
[53:37] priests
[53:38] and the lord brings into that place but
[53:40] you don't doubt the devil
[53:42] was always there to accuse and we know
[53:44] that was the case because you can read
[53:45] through false epistles
[53:47] he says i'm the least of all the
[53:48] apostles who persecuted the church
[53:51] how how the devil was always there to
[53:54] accuse
[53:59] you know that's what that's the thing
[54:00] the devil does is he's right there
[54:03] to bring back up all your failures
[54:06] everything that you've done wrong
[54:07] he's more than more than willing more
[54:10] than willing
[54:11] to point you back to always point you
[54:14] back
[54:15] oh this is what you did this is why this
[54:17] is like this because you did that
[54:19] oh yeah the lord never forgave you with
[54:21] that don't you remember when he said
[54:23] this
[54:24] oh my i mean i can i'm just thinking
[54:26] still thinking about peter
[54:28] you imagine peter in those times
[54:31] when the lord jesus was crucified and
[54:34] died that had to be some agonizing days
[54:38] for peter
[54:40] oh my and no doubt there was probably
[54:43] gossip going on
[54:45] they weren't converted they weren't
[54:48] converted they were already fight no
[54:49] fighting with each other over who is the
[54:51] greatest in the kingdom
[54:53] they're already like whispering who is
[54:55] it that betrays you
[54:56] who's gonna betray him whispering one to
[54:58] another i wonder who it is and then
[55:00] to see peter called out like that not
[55:02] once but twice
[55:03] get thee behind me say no you're going
[55:05] to deny me three times
[55:06] oh you don't think the whispers were
[55:08] going around oh that had to be some
[55:10] agonizing days
[55:12] we've been through the i believe we've
[55:13] all been through some of those days
[55:14] sometimes when the devil's right there
[55:16] on your shoulder oh you you ain't no
[55:17] child of god
[55:20] how could you be a child of god that
[55:22] brother's up there preaching this
[55:23] your pastor's up there preaching that
[55:25] you know it was right for you
[55:27] you know he was just condemning you you
[55:29] know he's just and what is it
[55:31] now again the devil starts to weave his
[55:33] web
[55:34] now he takes those memories and he moves
[55:37] it
[55:37] right to reasoning he loves to use those
[55:40] two and
[55:41] those two are a lethal combination
[55:45] oh you know the reason why god can't do
[55:48] it
[55:49] is because of this thing you did in the
[55:50] past
[55:52] do you know the reason why you should
[55:54] have this guilty conscience
[55:56] is because this thing you did in the
[55:57] past
[55:59] do you know why you can't have love for
[56:02] your brothers and sisters it's because
[56:03] of this thing you did in the past
[56:06] the devil loves to bring that to your
[56:09] remembrance
[56:10] he loves to bring it back and just put
[56:13] it right before you like a big billboard
[56:16] and too many times as believers we fall
[56:19] for that
[56:20] we'll let the devil tell us the lies
[56:23] and we'll just take it because our
[56:25] reasoning he starts to work on that
[56:27] reason we're not our channels aren't
[56:28] clear
[56:29] we haven't taken the word in faith and
[56:31] cleared out that channel of reasoning
[56:34] to say devil the reason doesn't matter i
[56:36] put it under the blood
[56:38] devil this memory doesn't matter because
[56:40] just like paul said
[56:42] in philippians 3 13 and 14 he said i'm
[56:44] forgetting those things that are behind
[56:46] and i press towards the mark of the high
[56:48] calling in christ jesus
[56:50] so what did he do he said he had to
[56:52] forget those things that are behind
[56:54] so for with us we need to learn to
[56:57] forget
[56:59] our failures we've got to have the mind
[57:03] of christ
[57:04] and if the mind of christ who is god
[57:07] so eat the mind of god and if the mind
[57:10] of god
[57:12] can take these things and cast it into
[57:13] the sea of forgetfulness
[57:15] and we have the mind of christ that it
[57:18] behooves the believer
[57:20] to start filling up the sea of
[57:21] forgetfulness with all the failures
[57:24] with all the problems with all the
[57:27] issues that you've had
[57:28] and start casting them away stop looking
[57:31] in the rearview mirror
[57:32] stop looking at every one of your
[57:34] failures because like we spoke two
[57:36] nights ago
[57:37] it's not about my overcoming power
[57:40] i'm an overcomer because he overcame for
[57:43] me
[57:44] i'm not relying on my ability i'm
[57:47] relying
[57:48] on the lord jesus who already completed
[57:50] the work
[57:51] amen i just want to make myself
[57:53] available
[57:54] to put myself into the place where he
[57:57] can use me
[57:58] in the spot that he wants which it goes
[58:00] back to being in the part of
[58:01] being in the body just being in your
[58:04] position
[58:05] lord make me available lord let me be a
[58:07] prisoner to you
[58:08] let me be completely satisfied with who
[58:11] i am
[58:12] what you've made me what you've called
[58:14] me to do
[58:15] and let me whatever you put your hand to
[58:17] do it with all your might
[58:19] if the lord's called you to be a
[58:21] housewife be a housewife for god
[58:23] with all your might if he's called you
[58:26] to be a song leader brother amen and i
[58:28] see it
[58:29] that you do be a song leader with all
[58:31] your might
[58:32] he got brother bang back there in the
[58:33] computer brother is going to work that
[58:36] live stream and he's going to work the
[58:37] computer with all his mic
[58:39] why because it's a part of the body
[58:41] because it's a needful part
[58:44] you'd say oh no doubt that the devil
[58:46] might fight for the bank oh i'm just
[58:47] sitting back here on a computer not
[58:48] doing too much
[58:49] but if he wasn't what about all the ones
[58:51] on the live stream right now
[58:53] brother jesse who would desire to be
[58:55] here but can't and his family
[58:56] and different ones for whatever reason
[58:59] but god
[59:00] has a place for you to fulfill
[59:03] and no amount of the devil's bringing up
[59:05] memories can stop that
[59:07] except you allow it to hinder you
[59:10] and stop you in your tracks
[59:13] so that's the first thing he does the
[59:16] first thing the devil does with memory
[59:18] is in the positive sense is he digs up
[59:21] all the old things
[59:25] so what's the second thing he does so
[59:27] the devil likes to add
[59:28] to memory he likes to throw false
[59:31] memories in there a lot of times too oh
[59:32] did i do something wrong do that no
[59:34] sometimes trials are just trials
[59:36] sometimes trials
[59:37] just like job are meant for you to
[59:39] overcome sometimes god
[59:41] the lord jesus just wants to see how are
[59:43] you going to react
[59:45] let's let's put some tests to it so it's
[59:47] like uh
[59:48] it's like i know your brothers do like
[59:50] cnc's different things
[59:51] when those engineers make those parts
[59:54] they have to subject them to stress
[59:55] testing
[59:56] before they can put them on a machine
[59:58] because they got to make sure
[59:59] if i if i do it two millimeters too thin
[1:00:02] it's going to break when it's put under
[1:00:03] stress so what is the lord that's what
[1:00:05] he does with his people
[1:00:06] is he's holding you out he's shaping you
[1:00:10] he's molding you
[1:00:11] and every once in a while he's got to
[1:00:12] say okay i've i've done this little bit
[1:00:16] here let's put him to a test and make
[1:00:18] sure
[1:00:19] that this these things that i've been
[1:00:20] shaping are holding properly
[1:00:23] and sometimes you know what sometimes by
[1:00:25] the grace of god we pass the test
[1:00:27] and sometimes it seems like we crumble
[1:00:30] but you know what oh i say lord i just i
[1:00:33] want to be
[1:00:34] in the potter's hands lord if you got to
[1:00:36] break me down and mold me again that's
[1:00:38] fine
[1:00:38] i just want to be in your hands that's
[1:00:40] all i want amen
[1:00:42] so the first thing the devil does what
[1:00:44] does he do he brings up all those past
[1:00:45] thoughts
[1:00:47] the second thing he does is he makes us
[1:00:49] forget
[1:00:50] what god has done for you he makes us
[1:00:54] he's so what does he do he brings up all
[1:00:56] the negative
[1:00:57] and he makes us forget all the positives
[1:01:00] see there's nothing wrong remember all
[1:01:03] of these senses
[1:01:05] in particular right now we're talking
[1:01:06] about memory
[1:01:09] there's nothing wrong with them as long
[1:01:11] as they line up with the word
[1:01:13] they were they're meant to glorify god
[1:01:16] they're meant to to be part of the
[1:01:19] avenue which god
[1:01:20] can express himself we like to call
[1:01:24] we call it a testimony or a memory
[1:01:27] but what what is a memory of something
[1:01:30] that god has done for you
[1:01:31] and so what does he do he while he's
[1:01:34] busy pulling up scarecrows from the past
[1:01:37] he's sitting there like digging up holes
[1:01:40] and trying to shove in all the things
[1:01:42] that god has done for you he's like
[1:01:45] peter said
[1:01:45] he said you forget that you were purge
[1:01:47] of your own sins you start to forget
[1:01:50] that that there was one time you didn't
[1:01:52] even care about god
[1:01:54] and now you want to serve them with all
[1:01:55] your heart there was a time
[1:01:58] where you didn't even think about
[1:01:59] holiness or living holy and clean
[1:02:02] and now you you can't help but think
[1:02:04] about it almost
[1:02:05] all every day
[1:02:09] there's a quote i don't have here
[1:02:13] and i've been a lot of quotes and things
[1:02:15] but you can look them up
[1:02:18] and i'm paraphrasing but brother branham
[1:02:21] was talking about how
[1:02:22] the stress and different things in the
[1:02:24] life and how there's stress
[1:02:26] in your life and brother branham he's
[1:02:28] talking about everybody thinks stress is
[1:02:29] a horrible thing but stress is necessary
[1:02:33] without stress you wouldn't be able to
[1:02:34] live if there wasn't stress and tension
[1:02:38] in your body your muscles strength uh
[1:02:41] flexing and tension and
[1:02:42] ligaments and things holding intention
[1:02:44] holding things together you'd just be a
[1:02:46] big jelly ball
[1:02:48] if you didn't have stress in your life
[1:02:50] if there were
[1:02:51] molecular stresses holding this wood
[1:02:53] together it would just be it would be
[1:02:54] nothing
[1:02:56] and so is it with the believer see we
[1:02:58] think
[1:03:00] that when you become a believer and
[1:03:02] filled with the holy ghost
[1:03:03] that it's all easy street from there on
[1:03:05] out but brother branham says he says
[1:03:06] you'll have more stress in your life
[1:03:08] when you've received the holy ghost he
[1:03:10] said because there was one time
[1:03:12] you lived and you were just carefree now
[1:03:16] without many of us maybe struggled with
[1:03:18] certain things depression or something
[1:03:19] didn't feel like you were carefree
[1:03:20] but that was a personal selfish
[1:03:24] stuff when when the devil gets you in
[1:03:25] that place you're just saying oh
[1:03:27] what was me what was me i know because
[1:03:29] i've been there
[1:03:30] but you were just carefree you didn't
[1:03:32] think about it you know i die
[1:03:34] you know i just live my life you know
[1:03:35] i'll eat drink and be married for
[1:03:37] tomorrow we die i'm just gonna do what i
[1:03:38] want
[1:03:39] but then when you became a believer when
[1:03:42] the holy ghost came in and this word was
[1:03:44] revealed to you
[1:03:45] and you saw there's a life to be lived
[1:03:49] there's a standard that god has there's
[1:03:51] there's and then all of a sudden he puts
[1:03:52] a desire that holy ghost desire in your
[1:03:54] heart
[1:03:55] to live for him now there's stress
[1:03:58] because now
[1:03:58] one time you weren't thinking about god
[1:04:00] now you're thinking about god all the
[1:04:02] time
[1:04:02] and you're thinking about lord i want to
[1:04:04] live for you and my i want to i'm
[1:04:05] checking up all the time
[1:04:07] and what is it that will do he turns
[1:04:08] that against us he turns that that's a
[1:04:10] good kind of stress
[1:04:12] it's it's being there always aware
[1:04:14] always checking up lord i want to make
[1:04:16] sure i'm on the right path
[1:04:18] but if we're not careful we'll take it
[1:04:20] too far and the devil starts using that
[1:04:22] and now you start to forget you start
[1:04:24] focusing so much on it you start to
[1:04:26] forget what god did for you
[1:04:28] you start to completely forget what
[1:04:30] grace is anymore
[1:04:32] because we get so caught up in desires
[1:04:35] the proper desire the proper desire
[1:04:39] wrongfully executed
[1:04:42] is going to lead to nothing but pain
[1:04:46] your desire to live right before god
[1:04:50] executed in nothing but human ability
[1:04:53] will lead you to nothing but failure and
[1:04:56] depression
[1:04:56] and sadness and you'll you'll be in that
[1:04:58] spot where you'll forget that you were
[1:05:00] purged from your old sins
[1:05:01] like we read in galatians in a in the
[1:05:04] book of galatians he says what he said
[1:05:06] you started out in faith
[1:05:08] are you now made perfect by the wall
[1:05:11] no we're not we're made perfect by his
[1:05:14] grace
[1:05:15] he's perfecting the saints by his grace
[1:05:17] and by his word right now
[1:05:20] so what we got to do the devil is so
[1:05:21] busy doing that
[1:05:23] he starts to bury all those things and
[1:05:25] we understand
[1:05:26] there if you look even in the old
[1:05:27] testament especially how many times the
[1:05:29] lord
[1:05:30] speaks about bringing up a memorial
[1:05:33] i believe the stones on the ephod were a
[1:05:35] memorial before god
[1:05:37] and i'm just gonna we're not gonna take
[1:05:39] very long so i just give you these
[1:05:40] scriptures if you want to look them up
[1:05:41] but exodus chapter 12 verses 13 and 14
[1:05:45] he's speaking of the passover he says
[1:05:47] this day shall be a memorial for you
[1:05:49] and for the children of israel forever
[1:05:51] for all your generations
[1:05:52] what was it it was to keep them
[1:05:54] remembering
[1:05:56] remember secret memory is good if it be
[1:05:58] applied properly
[1:06:00] all these things are good your
[1:06:01] conscience is good when it's the holy
[1:06:03] ghost pricking that conscience to get
[1:06:05] you away from sin
[1:06:07] amen affections are good when it's a
[1:06:09] holy affection
[1:06:10] striving to to get closer to god
[1:06:14] all these things are wonderful like we
[1:06:16] talked about imagination and how it has
[1:06:17] such a negative connotation
[1:06:19] but imagination is good if it's used in
[1:06:21] an inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:06:23] all these things are wonderful so god
[1:06:26] says
[1:06:27] you're going to keep the passover as a
[1:06:28] memorial for all your generations
[1:06:30] so you can remember what god did for you
[1:06:33] joshua chapter 4 when they're crossing
[1:06:36] the jordan
[1:06:37] and they step through and the jordan
[1:06:38] drives up and the lord tell let's turn
[1:06:41] there actually i like this one
[1:06:43] i like it all but i like this one a lot
[1:06:44] too
[1:06:46] joshua chapter four
[1:06:50] verses five through seven they're
[1:06:52] getting ready to step
[1:06:54] through the jordan to the other side
[1:06:56] into the promised land
[1:06:58] they're filing we're making our way
[1:06:59] finally it's been all these years in the
[1:07:01] wilderness and we're going over
[1:07:03] so what do they do it says
[1:07:07] and joshua said unto them passover
[1:07:11] passover before the ark of the lord your
[1:07:13] god into the midst of jordan and taking
[1:07:15] up every man
[1:07:16] of you a stone upon his shoulder
[1:07:18] according
[1:07:19] unto the number of the tribes of the
[1:07:21] children of israel that this may be a
[1:07:23] sign among you
[1:07:24] that when your children ask their
[1:07:26] fathers in time to come
[1:07:28] saying what mean ye by these stones then
[1:07:31] you shall answer them
[1:07:32] that the waters of jordan were cut off
[1:07:34] before the ark of the covenant of the
[1:07:36] lord
[1:07:36] when it passed over jordan the waters of
[1:07:39] jordan were cut off
[1:07:40] and these stones shall be for a memorial
[1:07:42] under the children of israel forever
[1:07:45] so what was it it was a memorial it was
[1:07:48] something that they could look at
[1:07:50] it was a memory it was something to stir
[1:07:52] up peter said
[1:07:53] it was something to stir up their pure
[1:07:54] minds by way of remembrance
[1:07:57] to let them remember what god had done
[1:08:01] for them
[1:08:01] the supernatural power that god had
[1:08:04] displayed
[1:08:05] in their lives when they when they put
[1:08:09] the manna into the the holy holy
[1:08:12] was it they could take a bite of that
[1:08:14] manna and even though they were in the
[1:08:15] promised land that the manna had ceased
[1:08:17] they could still remember what god had
[1:08:19] done
[1:08:20] in providing for the children of israel
[1:08:24] all these things and and we even come to
[1:08:26] the point why
[1:08:27] one of the reasons communion is so
[1:08:29] important
[1:08:31] because first corinthians 11 23-26 we
[1:08:34] know these are communion scriptures that
[1:08:35] we read
[1:08:36] let's go there
[1:08:44] first corinthians 11 verses 23 through
[1:08:47] 26
[1:08:47] for i have received of the lord that
[1:08:49] which also i delivered unto you
[1:08:50] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:08:52] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:08:54] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:08:55] said take eat
[1:08:56] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:08:59] this do
[1:09:00] in remembrance of me after the same
[1:09:03] manner also he took the cup when he had
[1:09:05] stopped saying this cup is the new
[1:09:06] testament
[1:09:07] in my blood this do you this do he as
[1:09:10] often as you drink it
[1:09:11] in remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:09:15] eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:09:17] he to show the lord's death till he come
[1:09:20] so what is it jesus himself setting
[1:09:23] forth
[1:09:23] a memorial of himself of his sacrifice
[1:09:27] of his of his body and his blood that
[1:09:30] was given for the believer
[1:09:32] so that we can always have something to
[1:09:33] look back and to remember
[1:09:35] that's why we don't have to have enough
[1:09:37] another memorial now
[1:09:38] because we can look back on that and see
[1:09:41] that that was
[1:09:42] it that was the perfect sacrifice that's
[1:09:45] the one memorial
[1:09:46] that we can look at and know that it was
[1:09:48] finished amen
[1:09:49] so we can always with that communion
[1:09:52] it's the holy time
[1:09:54] to come and check your life and the
[1:09:56] devil will be all you shouldn't take
[1:09:57] communion because of this
[1:09:58] and because of that and because of this
[1:10:00] and you say you know what lord if
[1:10:02] there's any art
[1:10:03] i will make it right i'm going to put it
[1:10:05] under the blood and
[1:10:06] while the devil's bringing up those
[1:10:07] scarecrows at the same time he's trying
[1:10:09] to condemn you for that
[1:10:10] you can look at the communion and
[1:10:13] remember
[1:10:14] what that stands for which is the
[1:10:16] forgiving power
[1:10:17] of the blood of jesus christ that
[1:10:19] cleanses you
[1:10:20] and makes you holy and perfect before
[1:10:22] him amen
[1:10:25] but what does the devil do he starts he
[1:10:27] buries those things
[1:10:29] he makes it so you don't remember him
[1:10:30] anymore
[1:10:33] he he makes you forget the testimonies
[1:10:37] of your life oh how many of you here how
[1:10:40] many of you here have ever been healed
[1:10:42] i've been healed i've i've had things
[1:10:44] that i was struggling or suffering i
[1:10:46] prayed and got healed
[1:10:47] i could that's a that's a memorial in
[1:10:50] your life that you can look back
[1:10:52] that's a good memory that you can look
[1:10:54] back how many of you
[1:10:56] were out in the world doing whatever you
[1:10:58] want to do and then god came along your
[1:10:59] path
[1:11:00] revealed a word to you revealed the
[1:11:02] truth of this
[1:11:03] hour to you and brought you to it i'm
[1:11:05] here because of that
[1:11:08] that is a memorial you right now
[1:11:11] being here you right now that may be
[1:11:13] listening on the live stream
[1:11:14] you are a living memorial of what god
[1:11:17] has done
[1:11:18] in this hour while it's getting smaller
[1:11:22] and smaller and falling away left
[1:11:24] falling away to the right
[1:11:26] all these different things here you
[1:11:27] stand
[1:11:30] don't let the devil steal those memories
[1:11:32] from you
[1:11:33] you get that spiritual amnesia we know
[1:11:35] brother brandon talked about that
[1:11:36] that's spiritual amnesia you start to
[1:11:38] forget who you are
[1:11:39] you start to forget what your purpose is
[1:11:42] you start to forget
[1:11:43] that you're even a christian anymore you
[1:11:45] start to forget it's not
[1:11:46] see there's a thing that spiritual
[1:11:48] amnesia didn't change who you are
[1:11:51] it changed what you thought you were it
[1:11:54] changed what you thought about yourself
[1:11:56] it changed with what your recognition
[1:11:59] it's a failure of recognition
[1:12:03] and that's what the devil does with
[1:12:04] these memories and we're talking about i
[1:12:06] will remember
[1:12:09] so we go through with that with that
[1:12:12] before us we want to always that's why
[1:12:15] we would read our word
[1:12:16] that's why we think upon the things of
[1:12:18] god because that's why we listen to
[1:12:20] messages and different things then we
[1:12:22] listen to the preaching of the word why
[1:12:24] because it's a bringing of remembrance
[1:12:26] it's a memorial
[1:12:27] before you always of who you are because
[1:12:31] the devil is out there every day trying
[1:12:33] to steal that away
[1:12:34] trying to steal it away trying to steal
[1:12:36] it away he's clogging her
[1:12:38] trying to clog our minds with so much
[1:12:40] garbage
[1:12:41] he's trying to clog our arts all those
[1:12:43] senses up
[1:12:44] trying to clog those channels up to
[1:12:46] where now we can't even remember who we
[1:12:48] are anymore
[1:12:50] and when that happens that's where we
[1:12:52] become unfruitful
[1:12:55] so what do we want to do we want to
[1:12:57] remember
[1:12:59] the word of the lord we want to remember
[1:13:02] i will i want you to let's go to
[1:13:03] psalms 77 just one of my absolutely
[1:13:07] favorite scriptures
[1:13:13] you know we okay we didn't uh
[1:13:17] we didn't go into this yesterday i was
[1:13:19] thinking about it after the service and
[1:13:20] i was thinking you know
[1:13:22] when it comes to that taste sense
[1:13:25] you know one of the hardest things it's
[1:13:27] uh because we know the tongue
[1:13:29] is where we speak from and all these
[1:13:31] different things
[1:13:32] one of the hardest things to say is i'm
[1:13:35] sorry
[1:13:37] one of the hardest things to do is
[1:13:38] confess really confess
[1:13:40] our faults one to another why it leaves
[1:13:42] a bad taste on the tongue
[1:13:43] it's not easy to get that out you know
[1:13:47] and it's something because we we ought
[1:13:49] to be honest with ourselves
[1:13:51] we need to be honest with ourselves that
[1:13:52] doesn't mean we go around speaking
[1:13:53] negatively
[1:13:54] if we're truly honest with the holy
[1:13:56] ghost with conviction not
[1:13:57] not not these false memories okay not
[1:14:00] letting the devil just
[1:14:01] build up fortresses around you and cage
[1:14:04] you in and
[1:14:05] you're speaking all these negative
[1:14:06] things about yourself but if if there's
[1:14:08] something you're struggling with
[1:14:10] if there if there's a battle you're
[1:14:11] facing if there's deliverance that you
[1:14:13] need
[1:14:14] if there's healing that you need if you
[1:14:16] need faith
[1:14:17] if you're if you're lacking in faith if
[1:14:19] you're lacking something
[1:14:20] as you can ask god for it you can be
[1:14:23] honest with god
[1:14:24] amen amen and that's what we need to do
[1:14:26] is be honest that's why i love this
[1:14:27] scripture so much
[1:14:29] psalm 77 will read starting at the first
[1:14:31] verse
[1:14:32] he says i cried unto god with my voice
[1:14:35] even unto god
[1:14:36] with my voice and he gave here unto me
[1:14:39] in the day of my trouble i sought the
[1:14:41] lord
[1:14:42] my soul ran in the night and ceased not
[1:14:45] my soul refused to be comforted i
[1:14:48] remembered god
[1:14:49] and was troubled have you ever had that
[1:14:52] how many have ever
[1:14:54] devils get you to a place where every
[1:14:55] time you think about the lord it almost
[1:14:57] troubles you
[1:14:58] because sometimes the devil's got you in
[1:15:00] that corner it's just seeing how
[1:15:01] short you come so that even the very
[1:15:04] remembrance of god
[1:15:05] is almost just a fearful thing not in a
[1:15:07] holy reverential fear
[1:15:09] but oh my i'm just done for
[1:15:12] i've been there where it seems like just
[1:15:14] like uh
[1:15:15] david my sin is just ever before me
[1:15:17] every time i think about the lord all i
[1:15:18] can see is my failures
[1:15:21] this is what he's saying he said i
[1:15:23] remembered god and i was troubled
[1:15:26] i complained and my spirit was
[1:15:27] overwhelmed
[1:15:30] thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so
[1:15:32] troubled that i cannot speak
[1:15:35] i have considered the days of old the
[1:15:37] years of ancient times
[1:15:39] i called to remembrance my song in the
[1:15:41] night i commune with my own heart
[1:15:44] and my spirit made diligent search see
[1:15:46] that's a good thing right there if
[1:15:47] you're troubled
[1:15:48] just get down and start searching lord
[1:15:51] if there's something wrong
[1:15:53] lord if there be any wicked way in me i
[1:15:55] want to surrender it
[1:15:57] lord i don't want to be in this spot i
[1:15:59] don't want to be downtrodden like this
[1:16:01] because
[1:16:02] god is not looking for his people to be
[1:16:03] downtrodden and just somber
[1:16:06] and and all depressed all the time and
[1:16:08] oh whoa the world's going down and
[1:16:10] no we ought to be the happiest people
[1:16:12] amen
[1:16:13] because of what god's done for us and
[1:16:15] what he is doing for us
[1:16:17] and what he will do for us but he asks
[1:16:20] will the lord verse 7 will the lord cast
[1:16:23] off forever
[1:16:24] and will he be favorable no more is his
[1:16:27] mercy clean
[1:16:28] gone forever does his promise fail
[1:16:31] forevermore has god's forgotten to be
[1:16:34] gracious
[1:16:36] had he in anger shut up his tender
[1:16:37] mercies say
[1:16:40] think about that how many of you ever
[1:16:42] felt like that
[1:16:44] oh lord are you have you just forgotten
[1:16:46] about me
[1:16:47] have you cast off uh have i failed your
[1:16:49] mercy
[1:16:50] have i gone too far you know brother
[1:16:52] branham i believe brother branham said
[1:16:54] himself like he says
[1:16:54] he said if you have any the slightest
[1:16:57] desire for god
[1:16:59] then you hold on to that
[1:17:02] the worry you have is when you don't
[1:17:04] care about it anymore
[1:17:05] when there's no desire you don't have
[1:17:07] any any even
[1:17:08] inkling of desire but if there's any
[1:17:10] desire
[1:17:11] but he's wondering these things he's
[1:17:14] he's enough you can tell
[1:17:15] he's in a dark place
[1:17:18] i love verse 10 though he said and i
[1:17:21] said
[1:17:22] this is mine infirmity but i will
[1:17:25] remember
[1:17:26] the years of the right hand of the most
[1:17:29] high
[1:17:30] amen who's the right hand that's jesus
[1:17:32] christ
[1:17:33] amen i will remember jesus christ
[1:17:38] i will remember the words of the lord
[1:17:41] surely i will remember thy wonders of
[1:17:44] old
[1:17:45] i will meditate also of all thy work
[1:17:48] and talk of thy doings that's what we
[1:17:51] need to be doing brothers and sisters
[1:17:53] when you get into that spot you say see
[1:17:56] i like how he did it though he said this
[1:17:57] is my infirmity he wasn't trying to
[1:18:00] be like so many of us claim that we have
[1:18:02] faith and don't have he said lord i got
[1:18:04] this problem
[1:18:06] but i'm going to remember what you've
[1:18:09] done for me
[1:18:10] amen i'm gonna remember that you pulled
[1:18:13] me out of denomination
[1:18:15] you pulled me out of the world you
[1:18:17] brought me to this place and you're not
[1:18:19] gonna leave me
[1:18:20] because you said he had begun a good
[1:18:22] work is faithful and just to complete it
[1:18:27] amen he's not going to stop brothers and
[1:18:30] sisters he made you the promise
[1:18:32] don't let the devil bury that promise
[1:18:36] don't let him push it out of your memory
[1:18:39] say oh yes
[1:18:40] i have this struggle i have problems
[1:18:43] this is my infirmity this is the this is
[1:18:46] the wound that i have
[1:18:47] this is the sickness that i have but i
[1:18:50] will remember
[1:18:51] the right hand i would remember the
[1:18:53] years
[1:18:54] of the right hand i would remember jesus
[1:18:56] christ i will remember
[1:18:58] that communion i remember that blood
[1:19:01] that was shed
[1:19:02] that forgave me that cleansed me that
[1:19:04] gave me a promise of everlasting life of
[1:19:06] eternal life
[1:19:11] amen yes what we have to do is remember
[1:19:14] what he's done
[1:19:16] now we go back now you start thinking oh
[1:19:18] this is what we need to do is remember
[1:19:20] what god's doing
[1:19:21] remember what he's done now we can go
[1:19:24] back and look at adam and eve again
[1:19:26] all those memories brought up and say oh
[1:19:28] yeah we failed in the garden
[1:19:31] maybe adam and times where he got a
[1:19:33] little frustrated so yeah he blew it all
[1:19:35] up
[1:19:36] eve why'd you have to go and blow it all
[1:19:38] up memories
[1:19:41] we fight those it's real this is real
[1:19:44] life
[1:19:46] try to sugarcoat it as if we don't as if
[1:19:48] we don't fight
[1:19:49] it's a battle brothers and sisters
[1:19:52] i have to be honest i try to be
[1:19:54] transparent with you because
[1:19:56] i i can't come up here like a priest
[1:19:59] acting like
[1:20:00] i'm just some special somebody that's
[1:20:02] got something you don't got
[1:20:04] no sir saved by the same blood
[1:20:07] filled with the same holy ghost amen
[1:20:10] god's working the
[1:20:11] same work and i got the same battles
[1:20:14] maybe not in the exact same form but we
[1:20:16] all fight these things
[1:20:19] remember oh eve thinking about those
[1:20:23] when she's when she stumbled with the
[1:20:25] serpent and i'm thinking
[1:20:27] yes i know oh you know i i couldn't help
[1:20:30] but to take her back because of my love
[1:20:32] for
[1:20:33] all the battles they had to fight oh you
[1:20:35] gave up
[1:20:37] eternal life in the garden you gave up
[1:20:40] but then they could say i will remember
[1:20:44] even in our trial how god
[1:20:47] came and he ripped those big leaves off
[1:20:50] us and clothed us
[1:20:52] with with robes of skin aprons of skin
[1:20:56] a sacrifice i will remember how he
[1:20:59] showed forth a coming sacrifice
[1:21:02] that would bring us back to eden amen
[1:21:05] i'll remember
[1:21:06] that even in the midst of our fallen
[1:21:09] state
[1:21:09] god still came and said your seed
[1:21:13] will bruise the head of that serpent
[1:21:15] amen that there will be a seed that will
[1:21:17] come
[1:21:18] who will give us salvation they can
[1:21:20] remember that
[1:21:23] moses moses in the desert
[1:21:27] comes in has an experience with god goes
[1:21:29] back
[1:21:30] no doubt there were all the chorus and
[1:21:33] the dathan's
[1:21:34] and all the remember we talked about
[1:21:35] that mixed multitude
[1:21:37] that mixed multitude was there in egypt
[1:21:39] just as much as they were in the
[1:21:40] wilderness
[1:21:41] no doubt whispers going around oh yeah
[1:21:43] moses you couldn't do nothing
[1:21:45] you're nothing but a murderer anyway but
[1:21:47] he can sit there no doubt those memories
[1:21:49] popping back up
[1:21:50] oh you married this this woman on the
[1:21:52] backside of the desert who you shouldn't
[1:21:54] have married
[1:21:55] all these different things all these
[1:21:56] things talking about but moses said i
[1:21:58] can remember
[1:22:01] when i had no hope just hurting sheep
[1:22:05] on the back side of the desert and god
[1:22:07] called out to me
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:09] and he said i've come down to deliver
[1:22:11] him and i'm sending you moses
[1:22:14] he can remember the promise that god
[1:22:17] gave
[1:22:17] when he said put your hand in your bosom
[1:22:19] take it out again
[1:22:21] throw your stick down on the ground pick
[1:22:23] it up again i'll remember the commission
[1:22:28] think about joseph we'll go back to
[1:22:30] joseph now
[1:22:31] all the the accusations that probably
[1:22:33] followed him
[1:22:35] no doubt when he was put in prison after
[1:22:36] potiphar's wife
[1:22:38] the devil's right there oh you know you
[1:22:39] were flirting with her

[1:22:45] you were trying
[1:22:46] you know to do that and you're just
[1:22:48] scared because you knew it would get you
[1:22:49] in trouble that's the only reason you
[1:22:50] did it
[1:22:51] you know accusing that's how he does it
[1:22:53] even when things happen that you didn't
[1:22:55] want to happen
[1:22:55] the devil is right there to try to no
[1:22:57] matter what he remember he's playing
[1:22:58] both sides
[1:23:04] no doubt he was struggling but then he
[1:23:07] says i will remember
[1:23:09] i'll remember how god gave me those
[1:23:12] prophetic dreams to show me
[1:23:13] that i'll see my family again because
[1:23:16] those moon and the stars all came down
[1:23:18] and bowed down to me

[1:23:23] that i i have lived my life the best
[1:23:26] that i could

[1:24:46] peter oh here we go peter oh my
[1:24:54] i can see peter's struggling oh my
[1:24:59] oh could you imagine oh
[1:25:02] i can't try to imagine but i couldn't
[1:25:05] imagine what that's like
[1:25:07] when peter's sitting there thinking
[1:25:09] about all that oh you know you know
[1:25:11] the one you called messiah he said it
[1:25:13] was the messiah he stood there and
[1:25:14] called you he called you the devil
[1:25:16] he called you satan right to your face
[1:25:18] he was pointing at you
[1:25:21] oh and then he said one amongst you is
[1:25:23] the devil and then he pointed at you and
[1:25:24] called you the king of the devils
[1:25:27] you know that battle was raging and then
[1:25:30] peter
[1:25:31] but something had to tell him i will
[1:25:33] remember
[1:25:36] when i when he said but peter who do you
[1:25:39] say that i am
[1:25:40] he said thou art the christ the son of
[1:25:41] the living god he said flesh and blood
[1:25:43] has not revealed this to you
[1:25:44] simon son of jonas but my father which
[1:25:46] is in heaven and i say to you that thou
[1:25:48] art peter
[1:25:49] and upon this rock i shall build my
[1:25:50] church he said i will give you
[1:25:52] the keys to the kingdom and then jesus
[1:25:54] comes back and he says when you're
[1:25:56] converted
[1:25:56] you strengthen your brethren and then
[1:25:58] you know what he says he says i'll
[1:25:59] remember
[1:26:01] how he said i won't leave you
[1:26:02] comfortless but i will come to you
[1:26:05] and so peter goes to pentecost no doubt
[1:26:08] fighting those memories still fighting
[1:26:12] those memories no doubt but he said i'm
[1:26:15] going to remember
[1:26:16] the promise that he gave me i'm going to
[1:26:19] remember
[1:26:20] that he called me i'm gonna remember i'm
[1:26:23] not gonna let the devil
[1:26:24] try to pull it over on me and that's
[1:26:26] where the devil gets so many
[1:26:28] he gets them from going to pentecost he
[1:26:29] gets them from believing that full word
[1:26:31] of god for themselves
[1:26:32] they put themselves out
[1:26:35] oh you're just nothing but a devil the
[1:26:37] devil's putting up every roadblock
[1:26:39] to keep you from that holy ghost that he
[1:26:41] can
[1:26:43] date paul but peter would say i remember
[1:26:46] when when he called me out and said your
[1:26:49] name is simon
[1:26:50] you're the son of jonas he said you
[1:26:52] follow me i'll make you a fisher of men
[1:26:54] he could remember what god had done for
[1:26:56] him he wasn't gonna sit there
[1:26:58] and and let that deter him as crazy as
[1:27:02] it looked
[1:27:02] you don't think that maybe there are
[1:27:04] some people at first saw peter come in
[1:27:06] that upper room and said what is he
[1:27:07] doing here
[1:27:09] we heard about you peter we heard about
[1:27:12] what jesus said to you
[1:27:14] we heard about how you denied him and
[1:27:17] fled from the scene
[1:27:19] and peter said yeah but i remember how
[1:27:22] jesus said he said you go into jerusalem
[1:27:24] and you stay in that upper room you stay
[1:27:26] there do you be a dude with power from
[1:27:28] on high
[1:27:29] he said so i'm doing what he said i may
[1:27:31] have failed then
[1:27:32] but by his grace i won't fail now and
[1:27:35] it's the same way for you
[1:27:37] you the devil brings up those fails yeah
[1:27:39] i failed then
[1:27:40] yeah i might have fallen short but by
[1:27:42] his grace i won't fail now

[1:27:46] have fallen then
[1:27:47] but this bride will not fail now amen
[1:27:53] paul persecuting the church
[1:27:56] all that guilt all those memories
[1:27:59] coming back but he would say i remember
[1:28:03] when i was on my way to damascus and
[1:28:05] that light struck me down
[1:28:07] said saul saul why persecuted thou me
[1:28:10] he said who out there lord send out

[1:28:17] ananias
[1:28:19] when he prayed for me and the scales
[1:28:22] fell off my eyes
[1:28:23] and i could see clearly for the first
[1:28:26] time
[1:28:26] i could see the word of god clearly
[1:28:30] he said i'm going to show i'm going to
[1:28:32] show how much he's going to suffer for
[1:28:34] my sake
[1:28:36] oh my there's going to be a light
[1:28:40] to the gentiles
[1:28:43] he could remember that
[1:28:46] in closing
[1:28:48] [Music]
[1:28:51] we totally heard brother branham tell
[1:28:53] that story
[1:28:54] about the soldier with amnesia on that
[1:28:57] train
[1:28:59] that soldier many of us have i think
[1:29:02] many of us were on that train at one
[1:29:03] time brothers and sisters
[1:29:05] on that train he said he's going to the
[1:29:06] sanitarium where they're going to have
[1:29:08] to stay because they couldn't remember
[1:29:09] who they were
[1:29:10] couldn't know that nobody would claim
[1:29:11] them nobody even knew who they were
[1:29:13] thought they were dead didn't care about
[1:29:15] them didn't think anything of it but
[1:29:16] what happened
[1:29:17] they first they got off that train they
[1:29:20] got off the train for a little rest
[1:29:22] and what did they do they started
[1:29:23] looking around and i really like this
[1:29:24] because i never picked this up before
[1:29:26] but he says you said that soldier
[1:29:28] started looking around
[1:29:30] he said the first thing he started
[1:29:31] seeing he saw that water tank
[1:29:33] you know that was the first thing i saw
[1:29:34] was the baptism the water baptism that
[1:29:37] water tank
[1:29:38] was i saw the baptism in the name of
[1:29:40] jesus christ he said he saw that water
[1:29:42] tank
[1:29:42] something was familiar about that water
[1:29:44] tank you know when i saw that baptism
[1:29:46] there was something familiar about that
[1:29:47] baptism
[1:29:48] i didn't know at the time i had grown up
[1:29:50] not knowing i had amnesia
[1:29:53] but there was something familiar about
[1:29:55] that water baptism tank brother
[1:29:57] there's something familiar about the
[1:29:58] name of jesus christ
[1:30:00] to be baptized in it that was familiar
[1:30:03] and he said he looked around he said
[1:30:04] there's a little hill we had to look at
[1:30:06] a hill called calvary
[1:30:08] to take away the amnesia see if you ever
[1:30:10] find yourself
[1:30:11] in that amnesia go back go back to that
[1:30:15] waterway
[1:30:17] go back to that little hill he said when
[1:30:19] he saw that hill what'd he start doing
[1:30:21] he followed a little path yes yes
[1:30:24] when you see that hill you just start
[1:30:26] walking that little path
[1:30:28] you start walking that little narrow way
[1:30:30] yeah it's gonna weave around
[1:30:32] you're not gonna be able to always see
[1:30:33] what's around every corner you're not
[1:30:35] going to understand what's going on
[1:30:36] that little soldier didn't know either
[1:30:38] he didn't know why but something
[1:30:40] compelled him
[1:30:41] there's something that compelled him and
[1:30:43] i like it because that sold the other
[1:30:44] one that was watching him
[1:30:46] it's almost like the holy ghost just
[1:30:48] like yep he caught it
[1:30:50] i'm just gonna follow him on i'm just
[1:30:52] gonna i'm just gonna keep an eye on him

[1:31:06] corner now

[1:31:38] things that god's done
[1:31:39] for me how he brought me out of
[1:31:40] denomination how he brought me out of
[1:31:42] the depths of depression

[1:35:09] anything in our lives

[1:35:16] ourselves
[1:35:17] and just let you work on father but lord
[1:35:22] we stumble ourselves because we get in
[1:35:24] the way of the spirit that desires to
[1:35:26] work in us

[1:36:31] you know i'll tell you one thing is
[1:36:33] we'll have brother amen
[1:36:35] sing a song or two if anybody has need a
[1:36:37] prayer we pray for you
[1:36:39] the lord is here to do exceedingly and
[1:36:42] abundantly above whatever you can ask
[1:36:43] for
[1:36:45] i still want you to ask
[1:36:49] we can pray for you if need be but i
[1:36:51] want to just tell you this and the last
[1:36:52] little thing
[1:36:53] if i could leave you with this thought
[1:36:55] as we're kind of closing up these
[1:36:56] services
[1:36:56] take up talking about memory i tell you
[1:36:59] what
[1:37:00] the next time the devil you can keep
[1:37:01] playing brother that's fine
[1:37:04] and the next time that devil sits here
[1:37:06] and tries to remind you of your past
[1:37:08] i think you ought to remind him of his
[1:37:10] future
[1:37:12] it's the only reason he lives in that
[1:37:13] past is because you don't like to think
[1:37:15] what's going on
[1:37:17] he's trying to remember he's trying to
[1:37:18] hinder it it's like it's like a little
[1:37:21] it's like a little little man standing
[1:37:24] in front of a freight train trying to
[1:37:25] stop him from going he's trying to push
[1:37:26] all he can he can't stop
[1:37:28] he's trying to hinder it all he can but
[1:37:30] he can't stop it so when he's trying to
[1:37:32] point back to your past
[1:37:36] because that's already sealed your
[1:37:38] future's already sealed
[1:37:39] his future is already sealed so how
[1:37:41] about you remind him of those things
[1:37:51] head back to texas in the morning and by
[1:37:54] the grace of the lord i have a good
[1:37:55] report
[1:37:56] it is not 38 degrees in texas but it's
[1:37:59] like 60s and 70s
[1:38:01] but well we certainly love you all for
[1:38:04] those that
[1:38:04] are brother here that i had a chance to
[1:38:05] meet for the first time

[1:38:10] known already love each and every one of
[1:38:12] you
[1:38:13] pray that you just go forth and trusting
[1:38:15] in the lord jesus
[1:38:17] his word is true his promises are yea
[1:38:19] and amen
[1:38:21] and you're gonna make it you're gonna
[1:38:24] make
[1:38:24] awkward christian soldiers there's a
[1:38:26] reason that that's what they were saying
[1:38:28] when he saw that preview of the bride
