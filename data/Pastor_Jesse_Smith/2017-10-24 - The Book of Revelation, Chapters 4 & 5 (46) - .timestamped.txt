[0:02] revelation chapters four and five
[0:06] the themes of both chapters include the
[0:09] heavenly throne and the worship of the
[0:12] worthy Lamb who had the seven sealed
[0:14] book the heavenly throne is described in
[0:19] breathtaking detail as we see the one
[0:21] person seated on the throne and his
[0:24] colours a rainbow is round about the
[0:27] throne along with 24 seats for the 24
[0:30] elders clothed in white raiment and
[0:32] crowns on their heads lightnings
[0:35] thunderings and voices proceed out of
[0:38] the throne and seven lamps of fire
[0:40] burned before the throne which are the
[0:42] seven spirits of God a sea of glasses
[0:45] before the throne along with four beasts
[0:47] which rest not day and night and cry
[0:50] holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which
[0:54] was and is and is to come
[0:57] the lamb is said to be worthy to open
[1:00] and read the book because he prevailed
[1:03] he was slain on the cross and
[1:05] resurrected redeeming us to God by his
[1:08] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[1:10] and people and nation here we see how
[1:15] powerful the cross of Jesus Christ truly
[1:18] was and still is the mysteries of the
[1:21] book sealed with seven seals could not
[1:24] be made known without Jesus's work on
[1:26] Calvary Jesus's blood remitted or sent
[1:30] away our sins and we are now made nigh
[1:33] unto God through Jesus blood the sinless
[1:36] holy life of Jesus Christ
[1:38] made him worthy to take God's seven
[1:41] sealed book and reveal it to John and
[1:44] now to us the overcomers of our church
[1:47] age notice that no man or woman in
[1:50] heaven or earth was worthy except Christ
[1:52] not the Virgin Mary not Enoch not Elijah
[1:56] and so forth for all have sinned and
[1:59] fallen short of the glory of God God
[2:02] would only let his sinless holy son
[2:05] loose the seals and reveal the mysteries
[2:07] in his book
[2:10] the timing of the events in these
[2:13] chapters are unknown to us as we do not
[2:15] have a thus saith the Lord about these
[2:18] events but it is our personal conviction
[2:20] that the events of chapter 5 are history
[2:23] and took place sometime around 1963
[2:26] because that was the year that William
[2:28] Branham preached the revelation of the
[2:30] seven seals with thus saith the Lord the
[2:35] symbols and key revelations include the
[2:37] four beasts the four and twenty elders
[2:40] the seven spirits of God and the book
[2:43] sealed with seven seals
[2:46] the four beasts serve as throne guards
[2:49] to God's throne or mercy seat in heaven
[2:51] and our symbolic of the four Gospels
[2:54] Matthew Mark Luke and John that guard
[2:57] the book of Acts the four beasts also
[3:00] represent four powers or anointings of
[3:02] the Holy Ghost that will combat the four
[3:04] horse riders of the first four seals the
[3:08] four and twenty elders are the twelve
[3:10] sons of Jacob and the Twelve Apostles of
[3:13] Jesus Christ in their rightful position
[3:15] of authority as Christ promised in
[3:18] Matthew 19 verse 28 we believe st. Paul
[3:21] would have taken the place of Judas
[3:23] Iscariot and not Matthias for Paul said
[3:26] he was born out of season he was the
[3:28] least of the apostles and was the last
[3:30] to see Christ after Jesus's resurrection
[3:34] the seven spirits of God as lamps of
[3:37] fire are representations of the constant
[3:39] faithful presence of the holy ghost in
[3:42] each of the seven churches first John
[3:45] 5:7 said that the Holy Ghost bore record
[3:48] in heaven so we see this truth
[3:50] vindicated in Chapter four as these
[3:52] seven spirits or lamps are heavenly
[3:55] witnesses we know that the Holy Ghost is
[3:57] only one spirit based on numerous
[4:00] scriptures such as first Corinthians 6
[4:02] verse 17 first Corinthians 12 verse 13
[4:05] Ephesians 2:18 and Ephesians 4:4 so God
[4:10] is not seven different spirits God is
[4:13] showing us the truth that the Holy Ghost
[4:15] has revealed himself and acted the same
[4:17] in every single Church age all seven
[4:20] Church ages and heaven bears record of
[4:23] this glorious truth the book sealed with
[4:27] seven seals is a book of redemption for
[4:30] only the Redeemer Christ himself is
[4:32] worthy to take the book and reveal its
[4:34] mysterious contents to us this is the
[4:38] climatic event of chapters 4 and 5 the
[4:41] lamb coming to take the book open it and
[4:44] loose the seven seals which causes the
[4:47] four beasts the 24 elders and thousands
[4:50] upon thousands of angels and even John
[4:53] himself to worship this worthy one our
[4:56] Lord Jesus Christ as we will see shortly
[4:59] this
[5:00] conceal book contains the mystery of how
[5:02] Satan will attempt to come into the
[5:04] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[5:07] formal and powerless the loosing of this
[5:10] seven sealed book though also reveals
[5:12] how the true Christian today through the
[5:15] anointing of the Holy Ghost gains
[5:17] authority over the devil exposing his
[5:19] wicked ways so that the overcomer
[5:21] prevails against the gates of Hell and
[5:23] Satan's devices if you like more bible
[5:28] scriptures quotations or if you have any
[5:31] questions about the book of Revelation

[5:36] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
