TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's just been able to read and yes [Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to begin a series exposing the over 20 Lies coming out of random Tabernacle located in Jeffersonville Indiana and friends please know these videos are made with brotherly kindness after much prayer fasting seeking the Lord in an attempt to help the leadership repent of their lies and idolatry at Branham Tabernacle and by the grace of God hopefully save one or more souls out of this man-made denominational system that's been set up the tape Church movement or the Press Play movement headquartered of course in Jeffersonville Indiana as my previous videos have showed I've been in contact with the leadership at Branham Tabernacle they've always been kind and that's why I want these videos to be kind but the leadership has never repented they've never been able to receive any correction and they continue to influence Millions with their lies and false doctrines that contradict God's prophet of this church age brother William Branham and through this series I want you to hear the actual audio of the Branham Tabernacle leadership the actual words that they say and also I want you to see the words they actually post on their website because they are doubling down on their false doctrines and lies and I want you to see their lies compared to the audio of God's Prophet brother Branham and then we can all decide who's right today's leadership at Brenham Tabernacle or brother Bynum because it's obvious and apparent to any honest-hearted person that today's leadership at Branham Tabernacle contradicts the man that their Tabernacle is named after brother William Branham and friends I want to just briefly reference a video I made about this subject it's from March 25th 2020 called not every word William Branham said was thus saith the Lord and again this is the first video in a series that will show at least 24 lies or false doctrines coming out of the Branham Tabernacle so let's begin with the first lie the first lies that Branham Tabernacle says every word on brother Branch tapes are thus saith the Lord that's a lie and it's idolatry to make every word of brother Branham thus saith the Lord let's begin by watching the video of the leader from random Tabernacle speaking this lie believes everything that Brook Branham says is thus saith the Lord amen amen amen I believe everything friends say Amen thus saith the Lord as my previous video showed Branham tabernacle's leadership misunderstands a quote from trying to do God a service without being the will of God from 1965 where brother Brown said quote so say I in the name of Jesus Christ don't you add one thing don't take put your own ideas in it you just say what is said on those tapes you just do exactly what the Lord God has commanded to do don't add to it end quote the key to understanding this quote is that brother random said do exactly what the Lord God has commanded to do and based upon other quotes from Brother Branham we know not every word brother random uttered was from the Lord and friends I've made numerous videos about this subject such as my three-part series called 60 plus proofs the tapes of William Branham have mistakes yet he was a true prophet and by God's grace friends now I have over 83 proofs brother Brown's tapes have Mix-Ups and friends it's undeniable brother Brandon was human not every word he said was thus say the Lord any honest person could admit that most recently I found where brother Brandon said a woman has sperm he said quote it's infertile to the woman's sperm end quote and brother Brandon said Enoch served God for 500 years yet Genesis 5 23 says all the days of Enoch were 360 and five years by the ram said quote look at Enoch he walked with God for 500 years end quote so perhaps I'll make a video in the future showing numbers 70 through 83 on the number of honest mistakes brother Brandon made on the tapes and friends I have emailed the leadership at Branham Tabernacle numerous times asking five simple questions and I asked them just give me a yes or no answer and they cannot answer any of these five questions they will not even respond question one is Billy Paul the promise Joseph or not yes or no because brother Ram said he was the promise Joseph in 1951. number two does the third person of the Trinity burn in your heart yes or no because in 1952 brother random said the third person of the Trinity burned in his heart question number three does brother random have anything to do with the seven Church age messenger or not yes or no because in 1961 brother Brandon said he didn't have anything to do with him question number four did Arizona have another generation after 1965 yes or no because brother Adam said we can't have another generation due to the rise of mental retardation in Arizona and then question five did Rebecca in Genesis 24 marry a woman yes or no because brother random said Rebecca married her bride or woman in 1960. the fact that the leaders of Brenham Tabernacle will not answer these five questions shows they're breaking the word of God first Peter 3 15 commands us to always have an answer for questions brother Brando said I'm not infallible made statements it said this is not the Lord this is me speaking brother Branham said I make mistakes all the time well the ram said it's one of the most awfullest things to do to make him infallible so now let's play these quotes back to back we'll play the LIE from Brenham tabernacle's current leadership against brother Adam's truthful statements from his tapes so let's first do the quote where brother Ram said I'm not infallible [Applause] now let's do the quote where brother Branham said the tapes have Mix-Ups yes it was a great teaching there I didn't touch the age of it but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember looking when you see it's seven months let's play the quote where brother Branham said it's one of the most awfulest things to say he's perfectly infallible I believe everything Brandon says so friends who is right is Branham tabernacle's current leadership right or is brother Brandon Wright of course we know the answer brother branham's right and Branham tabernacle's current leadership is lying along with that video of Brenham tabernacle's current leadership there's three more blog posts where random tabernacle's current leadership doubles down and says every word on brother Rams tapes is thus saith the Lord or infallible where brother M's tapes can never be wrong so here's the second proof and Branham Tabernacle posted this blog post on April 10 2021 you can see it here on the screen the leadership said quote dear bride there's only one Sure Way press play and hear ye him the prophet said men can truly be anointed of God with a right Revelation from God and be wrong but the tapes can never be wrong end quote this is an awful lie to say that the tapes can never be wrong so let's again play the quote where brother random said there's Mix-Ups on the tapes and remember Branham tabernacle's leadership says tapes can never be wrong and yet brother Brandon says the tapes have Mix-Ups let's listen to the quote next here's a quote from Brother Branham where he said his wife said he's wrong on so many things and brother Branham said that's right so brother Branham admitted he was wrong on so many things yet Branham Tabernacle says brother Ram's tapes can never be wrong so who's right is Branham Tabernacle or brother Branham of course brother branham's right let's listen to the quote next here's a third Witness that the brand of Tabernacle worships the tapes of William Branham is from July 30th 2020 random Tabernacles said quote dear written word thus we learn what is on the tapes are the words of God and there are no mistakes in the words of God end quote I'm Tabernacle saying the tapes have no mistakes and yet brother random said he made mistakes all the time and they were mistakes that were on the tapes such as saying there was 700 that did not bow the need to bail but the Bible said there were seven thousand let's listen to brother Ram's quote that God doesn't make any mistakes I make thousands of mistakes in each month and each year so shall see him [Music] a fourth and Final witness is from October 23 2022 Branham Tabernacle wrote quote dear brother Joseph number one I have heard you say that you believe every word of this message is thus say the Lord from the depths on my heart and with every fiber of my being I believe that it is the very voice of God speaking lip to ear to his bride end quote so again we see the spirit of idolatry upon the leadership at Branham Tabernacle Branham Tabernacle leadership says they believe with every fiber of their being every word on the tapes is thus saith the Lord and yet brother Brandon said there's Mix-Ups on the tapes he's not infallible it's an awful thing to say he's perfectly infallible only God makes no mistakes and he can be wrong on so many things and he makes mistakes on tape all the time so who are we going to believe Brandon tabernacle's current leadership or brother Branham let's believe brother Branham and one more sad awful statement from this October 23rd blog post is that Branham tabernacle's leadership says quote the holy spirit is here to lead us to understand what is and isn't the word that is the same devil that spoke to Eve and said surely he didn't mean every word sound familiar end quote friends notice what Branham tabernacle's leadership is saying they're saying it is Satan who says we need the Holy Spirit to help us understand what is the word and what isn't the word on brother branham's tapes so Branham tabernacle's leadership is saying Satan is the one who says we have to rightly divide the tapes friends this is one of the most awful delusional statements I've ever heard from Branham tabernacle's leadership because it is the holy spirit that says we have to rightly divide the word of Truth according to the Bible and prove all things according to first Thessalonians 5 21 and second Timothy 2 15. even brother Branham himself said we have to be careful to discern The Human Side versus the prophetic side as he said and he cares do you care 1963. did you find [Music] you past announce there there would be this happening now see I've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to I think there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the Lord even to Visions or anything that and that's reason I say that now that there is any uh any prophecy concerning and I have nothing on it from the Lord and be your sure now if I say anything from the Lord like that to tell you it's always I'm speaking now but when he speaks I say it's not me it's thus saith the Lord and I can't say it until he tells me I could be all together wrong am I thought about Martin Luther King I don't know I can't say it that's just my opinion anything and Jesus Christ himself said the holy spirit will guide you into all truth so Saint Paul the Bible and Jesus Christ all say we've got to rightly divide the word of Truth and we need the Holy Ghost to help us understand what is God's word and what isn't God's word coming out of the mouth of every human born in sin shaped in iniquity but yet redeemed and called by God to preach like brother William Branham so friends let's keep praying for the leadership of Branham Tabernacle they keep doubling down there's no repentance no humility and they will receive no correction they are in a very sad spiritual state and in summary as future videos will show Branham Tabernacles leadership is always doing two things first they're always saying what the tapes do not say brother Brandon never said every word on my tapes is thus saith the Lord brother Graham never said just press play and obey brother Brown never said put the Tate Ministry first before living preachers and second Bram Tabernacle is always breaking the word of God in these six ways first they're idolizing brother Branham by making every word thus saith the Lord same thing that happened in Acts 14 verse 11 when heathens try to idolize Paul and Barnabas and said the gods are come down to us second they're deleting parts of the fivefold ministry which breaks Ephesians 4 8-16 third Branham Tabernacle leadership is always name-calling others which breaks Ephesians 4 29 and Colossians 4 verse 6. and of course our future videos will go through these topics fourth Branham Tabernacle is saying that preachers are anointed with the spirit of Satan for rightly dividing the word and proving all things which breaks first Thessalonians 5 21 2 Timothy 2 15. fifth they're encouraging preachers to neglect their gifts of preaching which breaks First Timothy 4 14 and Matthew 25 verse 18. and six they're decreasing their physical Church attendance which breaks Hebrews 10 verses 24 and 25. in closing let's have a word of prayer for the leadership at Branham Tabernacle dear heavenly father with all kindness and love in my heart I pray for the leadership of Branham Tabernacle that they'll repent of these lies this is just the first lie Lord there's at least 23 more so I pray you be merciful may they come to themselves may they overcome these complexes that they have may they admit their wrongs and their sins dear God and their false doctrines and may they finally receive the spirit of truth that will guide them into all truth I pray this humbly I pray this by your Holy Spirit In Jesus Christ's name amen Lord willing we'll continue this series soon if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
