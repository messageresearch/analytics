[0:00] but we find here that God in spite of
[0:05] all the failure that Moses had done he
[0:08] still had his hand on him and he called
[0:12] him to go do his service calling him to
[0:16] his
[0:17] commission and what a consolation that
[0:20] must have been to
[0:22] Joshua when he heard God say as I was
[0:26] with Moses so will I be with you amen
[0:30] although if I'm trying and I fail God
[0:33] won't leave
[0:34] me I don't have much confidence in
[0:37] anybody's too afraid to do
[0:40] anything I'd rather be found a failure
[0:44] than too lazy to
[0:47] try one time it was said that the
[0:50] Ballard and Ballard Flower Company hired
[0:53] a man and he was going to sign his
[0:56] name and the man had no eraser on the
[0:59] end of his p
[1:00] canel and Mr Ballard said to him said
[1:04] why haven't you got a
[1:06] razor he said I don't make
[1:09] mistakes he said then I can't use
[1:12] you because if you make mistakes you you
[1:15] don't make mistakes you won't do nothing
[1:18] that's
[1:20] true God don't hold you responsible for
[1:22] your mistakes he holds you responsible
[1:25] for all your will willful sins he that
[1:28] sins willfully after he has received the
[1:30] knowledge of the
[1:32] truth but a man that's going to do
[1:34] something's going to blunder he's going
[1:36] to fall he's going to make
[1:39] mistakes but if he's really divinely
[1:42] calling God in his heart he'll Rise
[1:45] Again
[1:47] amen used to be coming to the church
[1:50] here years ago and they may be here this
[1:53] morning a little man and his
[1:56] wife they used to sing a song that
[1:58] Thrill Me
[2:01] go something like this forgive me Lord
[2:04] and try me one more
[2:07] time I'll be yours if you be
[2:12] mine if I follow if I fail let me rise
[2:18] and try
[2:20] again forgive me Lord and try me one
[2:23] more time I like that amen for any good
[2:29] soldiers that to get wounded or hurt but
[2:32] if he's still a soldier and got a
[2:34] purpose and something to fight for he'll
[2:37] rise and try
[2:39] again any good soldier of the Cross will
[2:42] do the same
[2:43] thing and to Joshua the new commander of
[2:47] the army after Moses had passed on
[2:51] seeing that God stayed with him in his
[2:55] mistakes he held his commission up no
[2:59] matter what Moses done it was Moses
[3:02] office that God
[3:03] respected he was a prophet he was above
[3:07] all the prophets he was really more than
[3:11] any Prophet that had when his own sister
[3:15] laugh that him for marrying an Ethiopian
[3:17] girl he called him together and he said
[3:20] don't you fear
[3:22] God said if there be one among you who
[3:25] spiritually a prophet I will speak to
[3:28] him in visions and make myself known to
[3:31] him in dreams but it's not so with
[3:34] Moses I speak lip to ear with him don't
[3:38] you fear God see that's not a good thing
[3:42] to upon God's people you heard him
[3:45] when you do so God had commissioned
[3:48] Moses his failures meant nothing God
[3:51] know his heart and he one time Moses
[3:55] complained about having too much to do
[3:58] and so God took his spirit and divided
[4:00] among 70 they had no more Spirit than
[4:04] they had at the beginning but only a
[4:06] thing they just had more
[4:08] Machinery same amount of spirit God can
[4:12] put his entire Spirit Upon A man if he
[4:14] wants to he can scattered amongst
[4:16] thousands if he wants to one day he put
[4:19] his whole Spirit Up On A Man Called
[4:21] Jesus now he scattered it through his
[4:23] churches
[4:26] everywhere God keeps his Commission now
[4:30] Joshua the new Warrior only two left now
[4:34] that ever left the promised land that
[4:37] was Joshua and Caleb now Joshua the new
[4:40] Commander to lead an army to step into
[4:44] the place where a great man like Moses
[4:48] stood it was no little
[4:51] task I think of a minister today that's
[4:54] called of God to step into the tracks
[4:57] where Jesus
[4:58] stood am
[5:02] what a command what a commission but
[5:05] each is called of God is commission to
[5:08] stand in that same
[5:10] place I'll be with you even in you to
[5:13] the end of the
[5:15] way each minister is called to stand
[5:18] where he did the works that I do shall
[5:20] you do
[5:21] also each minister is our dained of God
[5:24] is commanded to stand in the tracks of
[5:26] Jesus Christ and perform the duties that
[5:29] Jesus
[5:30] perform that's quite a
[5:32] command and how it must have felt when
[5:35] Joshua standing there that morning
[5:37] talking to God he said I'll not fail
[5:42] thee and as I was with Moses so I be
[5:46] with you no man shall stand before you
[5:49] all the days of your life I will destroy
[5:52] and devire I'll make the way clear only
[5:56] be strong and very courageous be not
[5:59] dismayed that's wearied don't be afraid
[6:02] I'm with
[6:04] you I'll see you through what a
[6:08] commission to be given to this new man
[6:12] called
[6:15] Joshua
