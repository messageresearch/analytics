TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you say that message you're preaching brother random is wrong look at yourself a little bit let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the word you'll agree with the message greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share a second set of reasons why I'm a message believer why I follow the bible-based ministry that Jesus Christ gave to his Prophet The Late William brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 my name is Jesse Smith I'm pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet brother William brandham and also defend The Godly character of brother William brandom I'll leave a link in the description to part one of this series before I get into reasons 10 through 14 I just want to thank the Lord Jesus Christ for saving my soul as as I said I was raised in Assembly of God and they were good people but when it came down to receiving the full revelation of the word of God the church I was raised in did not receed the full Revelation and then when I went to college I went to a Baptist type of mega church got saved there then about two years after that my brother Simon introduced the message of the hour to me by God's grace so I want to thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for saving my soul sanctifying me and filling me with the Holy Ghost putting me into service for his glory I can do nothing without Jesus's help and I believe my life verse is John 15:5 where Jesus said without me you can do nothing and I'm a living walking testimony to that without Jesus I can do absolutely nothing if any good comes out of my humble little insignificant life then Jesus gets all the glory it was a moment when I yield to the Holy Spirit and Jesus was able to use me like a worker puts his hand in a glove as a human I'm just a glove Christ is the power behind me that's how it is with every Godly Christian also want to thank my mother for all the years of praying for me she'd prayed with me before school and before bed of course she'd pray with my siblings and I even as a single mother she would Faithfully pray for us take us to church so I believe me being saved is partly God's answer to all her prayers and then God used my brother cam to help me get saved as well he was the first one amongst his brothers who gave his heart to Christ cam was a wonderful example of Christ and he let me borrow his car and while driving in his car as a sinner I listen to his Christian music and it totally softened my heart to Christianity so I credit the Lord Jesus Christ using my mom and brother cam so I could be saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ then I also want to say thank you to brother Simon I put out a video recently about the revelation God showed to him and and I felt like I didn't thank him enough brother Simon has been a tremendous friend and of course natural brother to me he's been a tremendous help to our church and our ministry he comes in and teaches as as an evangelist and as a teacher does a wonderful job staying with the word of God building our faith stirring us up in fact in one sermon last year in 2023 brother Simon preached and during the sermon there were at least nine things that discerned the thoughts and intents of my heart things I didn't tell him things he didn't know things I'd preached that he didn't know I'd preached and I wept and cried after that service and I thanked the Lord and I told Brother Simon never doubt that Jesus Christ has called you to preach never in my entire life of being a Christian have I been so thoroughly discerned than that one service I think it was nine or 10 or more times secrets of my heart things I've been wondering about praying about preaching about things I'd gone through trials I'd gone through brother Simon was led by the Holy Ghost to discern my heart and life and I thank the Lord for brother Simon yielding to the Lord Jesus Christ so now by God's grace we'll get into reason number 10 reason number 10 I'm a message believer is because of amazing Bible revelations friends when I first came in the message I would Drive 3 hours across the state from akan to Lima Ohio and even Defiance Ohio just for Bible study sometimes we'd sit for an hour two three maybe four hours and brother Craig bu and brother Simon would take me through the scriptures just teach me all the scriptures about water baptism the godhead hell is not Eternal the three works of Grace serpent seed the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul the gifts of the Holy Spirit the mother Harlot the Roman Catholic church and so many more Amazing Revelations this recent video I put out was another amazing revelation God showed to my brother Simon about how rebaptism in the New Testament was typed in the Old Testament through Joseph's two burials what a beautiful Revelation that's why I'm a message believer because the word of God becomes more and more real and Vindicated we get more information about the same Revelations all the time recently I was listening to brother brandom and he said there's hundreds of the differences between the bride of Christ and denomination now take a good look for a moment with your own spiritual Insight at your soul just look around I'm speaking Across the Nation now look just if you met you out there in a brandom tabernacle you and the Tabernacles on the west coast in Arizona and everywhere you're at look at yourself for a few minutes you say that message you're preaching brother random is wrong look at yourself a little bit let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the words you'll agree with the message let Christ the anointed word search out your own conscience let him get into you see if that's right or not that's just one or two things that mention when there's hundreds of them does a Bible agree with a woman bobbing her hair no does the bible believe agree with three baptisms in the name of father son Holy Ghost no such a thing does the bible agree with woman wearing man's clothing I'll just take them three there one of these hundreds or more search it out in the light of God's word so I took about an hour and I listed 100 doctrines that are different for us as message Believers than the nominal Christians of course some of them are saved I don't mean nomino in a bad way but it's the group outside of the message of the hour so I made it to 100 and then I thought think of all the Creeds and bylaws that all these churches have and so it's without a doubt there's hundreds if not thousands of differences between the true bride of Christ who stays with all the word of God like brother random has taught us to do and we're doing by the grace of God we're not perfect but the blood makes us perfect or mature and of course we know we're forgiven or perfect in heaven and we have a theophany waiting in heaven an eternal body in the heavens as Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 but there are so many amazing Revelations the Bible became a new Bible to me when I heard the message of William bradam I just can't thank the Lord Jesus Christ enough for revealing all these amazing Revelations to me my family our church each believer who follows this end time message the 11th reason I follow the message of the hour is because I've experienced real genuine love Jesus said you know my disciples because of their love one for another when I first came in the message I was a college student message believer would walk up and I'm a college student and he'd give me a handshake and there'd be a $20 bill in there God bless brother Richard that's the brother who would do it and when we go to other churches like lima we were treated so well by Pastor Pastor Isaiah Brooks all the saints there we got to stay at their houses when we'd come for church services and so forth they'd Feed Us One time my wife and I went to Jeffersonville and we didn't have any money to go out to eat and one sister paid for our food even bought our little baby girl Lydia some clothes that she needed one time a family from Pennsylvania and numerous families in this church from Pennsylvania filled an entire truck bed full of frozen food after my wife had a baby in order to give us food so my wife didn't have to cook right after having a baby I was crying it was such a wonderful Act of Christian love so I could truly say I felt the genuine love of Jesus Christ in the message of the hour and on top of that one time about 10 years ago I had some complexes towards some preachers I prayed about it each time I reached out to them they just freely forgave me and moved on haven't treated me any different and so again I've seen so much love in this message and that's the proof as Jesus said that we'd be the Disciples of Jesus Christ the love that we have one for another the 12th reason is simply the life in the book of Acts the angel of the Lord told the disciples to go speak in the temple and speak all the words of this life the disciples were in prison the angel got them out and said go speak the words of this life and that's what this Christian Life is in the message of the hour is the same life as the book of Acts Saints we get to walk where the apostles have Tred by the grace of God we have the same Doctrine the same baptism we have many of the same signs wonders and miracles we have the same love and we see see Jesus Christ bringing every area of Our Lives into subjection to the Holy Spirit to the word of God when I first came in this message I was in college and I visited the home of these young Brothers they were single Brothers brother Dave brother Craig brother Freddy brother Dan and I'm of course used to living with college athletes worldliness worldly movies worldly music all these things yet they go to church but when I walked into this house of the message Believers these single men I was overwhelmed with the Holiness of the Holy Spirit that I felt it truly was a holy atmosphere and I thought in my mind either these guys are the biggest frauds or they got something I don't got and I found out they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and thank God now I got it by God's grace but friends it was the life the life of Jesus Christ being formed into the life of the message believers who believe the Bible revelations of this hour it's simply Paul's gospel restored to us the current believers who are live today and that's according to numerous scriptures there are six scriptures at at least that brother Randon fulfilled Amos 37 Matthew 17:11 acts 3:20 and 21 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 1-7 Malachi 45-6 and no doubt other verses all proving brother brandom had a bible-based Ministry to restore all things that have been lost down through the church ages restore them at the end time the mystery of God could be finished the 13th reason I love this message is because we get to see into a life of a genuine prophet of God and its on tape and also video I love seeing the highs and lows of brother Ram's life I love seeing his love for the Lord his love for the grace of God I love seeing his humanity and then his prophetic gift of the Holy Ghost as a prophet and having the gift to discern between the thoughts and intents of the heart I love the discernments in the prayer lines or just reading about the discernments from believers who wrote about their interactions with God's Prophet brother brandham I love seeing brother Bram zeal for the Gospel of Jesus Christ to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ and brother bam always gave Jesus all the glory and again friends this is why I made over 200 videos about brother Ram's Ministry how it's impacted mine because it's a bible-based Ministry I've written two books about brother bram's Ministry my second book is 812 Pages it could have been a lot longer but I had to shorten it in order to fit it into one volume I mean the amazing Bible revelations and the wonderful quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham I couldn't in a book Jesus Christ moved so mightily through brother Ram's life yet he was so humble and so that's what we want to have we want to learn from the prophet of God God will bless us as we honor His prophets such as brother brandom and may God help us to be humble 14th and finally reason I love this message is because the teachings of the message have given me a wonderful loving family on a personal note as you probably know I was raised in a family where we're broken family my parents divorced when I was around 13 or 14 years old if I'm not mistaken and so for those remaining five or six years at home I always wanted one thing just a loving home I wanted to see a mom and dad who loved each other and of course my parents had good times and good years but eventually after the divorce it just left us all heartbroken that's why the Bible said God hates divorce but through the message of the hour I heard quotes from brother brandom say things like make the home a great place for your children make it a happy place make your home nice make your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother and into their house and make home so happy that they'll be pleased in their home and brother Ram said always keep the honeymoon with your wife and he was talking about a man losing their affections for their wife and don't uh love them as they did when they were sweetheart shame on you you ought to do it she's always your sweetheart absolutely that's the part she should be and you should treat her like that all oh never let that little honeymoon cease cuz it isn't going to in heaven going to be just perfectly one there that's right so all well looks like some women order to Said Amen to that don't never me here always balling women out and talking like that sister Hickerson why did you say something or somebody back there say did you thank you sister Cox that's very good brother Cox that's for you where you are now all right yes sir and we should never forget the h honor each other always be sweethearts never let it cease and even before I proposed to my wife brother random said only marry her if you can't live without her and that's what I found I'm so thankful that's what actually moved me to propose to my wife cuz I realized I couldn't live without her young man asked me other day he said you think I could already get married brother Bram to such and such a girl I said how much do you think of her he said oh my I just love her I said well if you're not going to live without her you better marri her but if you can't live without her you better not so but if it's going to kill you you better you better go ahead and get married and so what I was trying to get to in this that if you love her so much and so there's so many wonderful quotes about family and parenting that brother Bram gave us and we're so thankful for them Lord willing I'd like to write a book about family using Brother bram's quotes and of course the Bible scriptures not sure when that will happen but that's on my bucket list Lord willing another thing is to brother the ROM taught us to go back to the word of God and in the word of God we see God loves family you know modern families limit the number of children they have I don't know how God's going to deal with that one thing's for sure birth control pills are literally abortion pills so it's just a great reminder brother Ram never sanction birth control pills because they can cause abortions so by God's grace my wife and I have eight children we're very grateful for that but it's because of this bible message that God gave us through brother random that we learn to Value all the teachings of the Bible about family and how God loves family God loves children they're arrows they are the heritage of the Lord children are God's Heritage God's possession as brother randam said just receive them as God sends them in closing friends I hope this short little video series on why I'm a message believer is a blessing if I think of more reasons Lord willing I make a part three by God's grace we're so thankful Jesus Christ revealed all these Bible revelations to his humble Prophet the late brother William Bram as time goes on we're just going to get more Bible Revelation from the holy spirit because the Holy Ghost guides us into all truth just like with this rebaptism video and just like the four classes of Believers brother taught us in the church age book and the three works of Grace we are so blessed to walk in the light of this Revelation that Jesus has given us in this hour believe in the Lord and His prophets and you shall surely prosper by the grace of God I'm a living witness of that the Lord Jesus Christ has prospered me spiritually naturally and it's all because of the grace of Jesus Christ Our Lord if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
