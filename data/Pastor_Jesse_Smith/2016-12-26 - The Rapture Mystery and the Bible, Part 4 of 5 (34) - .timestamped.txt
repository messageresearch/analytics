[0:03] where will the rapture take place at the
[0:07] rapture will be a universal event
[0:09] meaning it will take place on a global
[0:10] scale and believers will not have to be
[0:13] in one physical location in order to be
[0:15] a part of the rapture Holy Ghost filled
[0:17] believers might be working at the time
[0:19] of the rapture or sleeping in their beds
[0:21] according to Jesus's teaching in the
[0:23] following scriptures Luke 17 34 I tell
[0:27] you in that night there should be two
[0:29] men in one bed the one shall be taken
[0:31] and the other shall be left two women
[0:34] shall be grinding together the one shall
[0:36] be taken and the other left two men
[0:38] shall be in the field the one shall be
[0:40] taken and the other left Matthew 24:40
[0:44] through 42 then shall two be in the
[0:47] field the one should be taken and the
[0:49] other left two women shall be grinding
[0:50] at the mill the one should be taken and
[0:52] the other left
[0:53] watch therefore for you know not what
[0:56] hour your Lord doth come it will not
[0:59] matter where the true believer is
[1:01] physically located if they have the oil
[1:03] or the wedding garment of the baptism of
[1:06] the Holy Ghost they will be ready for
[1:07] the rapture and Jesus will call them to
[1:10] the air to meet the rest of the saints
[1:11] in the sky the only location a Christian
[1:15] must be concerned about for the rapture
[1:16] is their spiritual location
[1:18] a true Christian must be located in
[1:21] Christ according to Romans 8 verse 1
[1:24] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:26] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:29] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:31] spirit believers are in Christ when
[1:35] Christ is in them by the baptism of the
[1:37] Holy Ghost Colossians 1:27 to whom god
[1:41] would make known what is the riches of
[1:43] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:44] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[1:47] of glory Galatians 3:27 for as many of
[1:51] you as have been baptized into Christ
[1:53] have put on Christ acts 1:5 for John
[1:57] truly baptized with water but he shall
[1:59] be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[2:02] days hence Romans 8:11 but if the spirit
[2:06] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[2:07] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[2:10] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[2:12] your mortal
[2:13] these by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[2:17] Jesus foretold his disciples about his
[2:20] desire to dwell in them by his spirit
[2:22] john 14 17 even the Spirit of Truth whom
[2:26] the world cannot receive because it
[2:28] seeth him not neither knoweth him but
[2:30] you know him for he dwelleth with you
[2:32] and shall be in you then a few
[2:36] scriptures later Jesus revealed a most
[2:38] glorious truth about those he would
[2:40] dwell in he revealed that those
[2:41] believers were already in him in his
[2:44] mind and plan before the foundation of
[2:47] the world John 14 twenty day he shall
[2:50] know that I am in my father and ye and
[2:52] me and I in you Ephesians 1:4 according
[2:57] as he hath chosen us in him before the
[3:00] foundation of the world that we should
[3:02] be holy and without blame before him in
[3:04] love praise God for the revelation of
[3:08] where we need to be for the rapture we
[3:10] must be in Christ
[3:11] meaning that Christ is in us our souls
[3:14] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost why
[3:18] will the rapture occur the rapture will
[3:20] occur because Jesus Christ desires to
[3:22] take his Gentile bride to their wedding
[3:25] in the sky and then to their wedding
[3:27] supper in heaven
[3:30] first Thessalonians 4:17 then we which
[3:34] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[3:35] together with them in the clouds to meet
[3:37] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[3:40] be with the Lord Matthew 25 10 and while
[3:43] they went to buy the bridegroom came and
[3:45] they that were ready went in with him to
[3:47] the marriage and the door was shut
[3:50] revelation 19 verse 9 and he saith unto
[3:53] me write blessed are they which are
[3:55] called unto the marriage supper of the
[3:56] Lamb and he saith unto me these are the
[3:59] true sayings of God according to John 14
[4:02] verses one through three Christ desires
[4:05] to be married with his eternal companion
[4:07] the many membered bride of Jesus Christ
[4:09] Christ wants to receive his people his
[4:12] bride unto himself and take her to the
[4:15] place he has prepared for them to live
[4:17] eternally the future home of the
[4:19] heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride
[4:22] John 14:1 let not your heart be troubled
[4:25] you believe in God believe also in me in
[4:27] my father's house are many mansions if
[4:30] it were not so I would have told you I
[4:32] go to prepare a place for you and if I
[4:34] go and prepare a place for you I will
[4:36] come again and receive you unto myself
[4:38] that where I am there ye may be also as
[4:42] pilgrims and strangers on this earth the
[4:45] Holy Ghost fill bride shares the same
[4:46] desire as her husband and wants to leave
[4:49] this world and ever be with the Lord
[4:51] Christ desires to rescue his wife from
[4:53] the Great Tribulation Period
[4:55] that is coming upon the earth to judge
[4:57] and torment the unbelievers jesus said I
[5:00] will also keep thee from the hour
[5:01] temptation which shall come upon all the
[5:04] world to try them that dwell upon the
[5:06] earth Romans 5 verse 9 says much more
[5:09] then being now justified by his blood we
[5:12] shall be saved from wrath through him
