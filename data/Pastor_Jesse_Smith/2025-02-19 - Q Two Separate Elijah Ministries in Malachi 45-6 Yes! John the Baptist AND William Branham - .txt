TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] now watch and the hearts of the children to the fathers any second coming in the last days he turns back to the apostolic faith again amen see how perfect the scriptures line up greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question are there two different Ministries spoken of in Malachi 4: 6 it says and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so I got this question from a brother who believes the message but he has been challenged by an accuser of brother brandom claiming that there are not two Ministries here in Malachi 4:6 so I'll read the question of the viewer here hello Pastor Smith God bless you I have a question about Malachi 4:6 and Luke 1:17 I found an article by a Polish critic of the message who believes that there is no division into two persons here but that John the Baptist is the Fulfillment of the entire prophecy and believes that these words quote and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous end quote are the same as Sons to the fathers what do you think about it so my answer was God bless you good question my answer is the Polish critic is wrong there are two Ministries two different Ministries from two different men in Malachi 4:6 and the proof of that is found in John 1:21 and they asked him what then art thou Elias and he saith I am not art thou that prophet and he answered no so notice John the Baptist says he was not that Elijah Prophet but yet Luke 1:17 says he was anointed with the spirit of Elijah so either John the Baptist is lying or John the Baptist wasn't aware that he had the spirit of Elijah or there's two separate Ministries for the spirit of Elijah in Malachi 4:6 so we know the answer is that there are two separate Ministries two different men Anointed with the spirit of Elijah in Malachi 4:6 and friends I've seen numerous videos of Jewish priests and other Jews faithful Jews and they are still looking for Elijah to come before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord just as Malachi 45 and 6 speak about let's read Luke 1:17 though and he should go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord so truly it's thus sayith the Bible that John the Baptist had the spirit of Elijah and John the Baptist fulfilled that first Ministry turning the hearts of the fathers to the children in Malachi 4:6 but then John said I'm not that Elijah so John must have been speaking of the second part of that verse the second phrase and the Heart of the children to their father fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse we know John the Baptist wouldn't lie about his Elijah Ministry so then John the Baptist had the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers spiritual to the children spiritual as Luke 1:17 says I can't find any Bible proof that John the Baptist was dealing with the natural fathers the natural Jewish fathers or the natural Jewish children so this has to have a spiritual meaning this was meaning John the Baptist turned the hearts of the early church fathers to Christ giving them a passion for the coming of the Lord remember John pointed out Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world remember John the Baptist had a preparation Ministry Isaiah 40:3 said he was the voice to make ready a people prepared for the Lord so John the Baptist Was preparing getting them ready for the Messiah and brother William brandham was restoring the gospel so the hearts of the children were ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ at the second coming of the Messiah there was a follow-up question this brother had a great question he said but what does the phrase in Luke 1:17 mean and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous this precious brother wondered why this phrase wasn't in Malachi 45 and6 and this polish critic was trying to say that phrase the disobedient to the wisdom of of the righteous was fulfillment of the second part of Malachi 4:5 and 6 but they don't match turning the heart of the children to their fathers doesn't match with the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous I think another verse in the Book of Luke explains what Luke 117 means if you go to Luke 310-1 14 you see John the Baptist helping the disobedient giving them wisdom to be righteous so it's lukee 3 10-4 and the people ask him saying what shall we do then he anth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him Master what shall we do and he said unto them exact no more than that which is appointed you and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages so here John is helping the disobedient become righteous through the wisdom of the Holy Spirit and what was that wisdom if you have two coats give one coat away if you have meat and someone's hungry give them some of your meat and the publicans are Tax Collectors he said just ask for the amount of taxes that's appointed to you don't steal money from people don't take extra tax money and lie about how much the government wants and then keep some of it see John was giving them with wisdom to be righteous instead of disobedient and then he told the soldiers the same don't be disobedient and be violent don't accuse anyone falsely be content with your wages this is the wisdom of God to be righteous to even soldiers friends if you like more Bible teaching about brother bram's Ministry and Malachi 45 and6 I wrote an entire chapter about his ministry in my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed it starts on page 741 and goes to page 785 so I wrote almost 40 pages on brother br's Ministry I could have wrote more but I had to shorten the book it shows six scriptures God used brother random to fulfill one of which was Malachi 45 and 6 then of course there's 30 thus sayi the Lords in this chapter as well again just as another proof that brother Brenham was a genuine prophet of God hopefully this video was a blessing by the grace of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
