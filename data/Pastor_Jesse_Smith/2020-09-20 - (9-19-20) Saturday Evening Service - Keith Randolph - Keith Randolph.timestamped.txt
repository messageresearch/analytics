[28:47] are going to open your word look into
[28:50] the pages of your word
[28:52] and lord that you might speak to us
[28:55] in a special way and give us a clear
[28:58] utterance of speech
[29:00] anoint these words give me the right
[29:02] words to speak lord as your prophet said
[29:04] if
[29:04] if we can just say the right words i
[29:07] pray lord they would be
[29:09] pleasing to you and i can just say
[29:12] many times lord i know you you liked it
[29:15] when i would say something i pray that
[29:16] you like it tonight
[29:18] and i can feel your presence and those
[29:20] that are here would be blessed in a
[29:22] special way
[29:23] for you give you all the praise and the
[29:25] honor for we ask it in jesus name
[29:28] amen first turn in your bibles
[29:32] i wasn't going to read this but i think
[29:34] i need to
[29:36] micah chapter 7
[29:39] and i want to read a couple verses this
[29:41] is not my text tonight but i want to
[29:43] read this
[29:44] first in verse 18 and 19 micah chapter 7
[29:48] verse 18 and 19.
[29:50] i have this in my notes so
[29:53] a beautiful couple of beautiful verses
[29:55] here
[29:56] because if you've experienced this you
[30:00] know
[30:00] peter said freely i have freely i
[30:04] give it you know who is a god
[30:07] like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity
[30:10] and passes by the transgression of the
[30:13] remnant of his heritage
[30:15] he retaineth not his anger forever
[30:17] because he delighteth in mercy
[30:20] amen he will turn again he will have
[30:23] compassion upon us
[30:25] he will subdue our iniquities and that
[30:28] will cast
[30:29] all their sins into the depths
[30:33] of the sea don't you like that all right
[30:36] now turn with me to jude
[30:40] chapter one and we're going to be again
[30:43] reading
[30:44] in uh verse 17.
[30:49] i want to read this we're talking about
[30:51] it's going to be about some compassion
[30:53] and different things tonight
[30:55] but maybe in a little different way you
[30:57] know we're going to talk about
[30:59] casting out your net i'll go i might
[31:02] read that tonight i might read it again
[31:04] in the morning
[31:05] not very many here but now listen
[31:09] but remember ye the words which were
[31:11] spoken before the apostles of our lord
[31:14] jesus christ
[31:16] how that they told you there should be
[31:18] mockers
[31:19] in the last time who should walk after
[31:21] their own ungodly lust
[31:24] these be they who separate themselves
[31:26] central
[31:27] having not the spirit but ye beloved
[31:30] building up yourselves on your most holy
[31:33] faith
[31:34] praying in the holy ghost keep
[31:37] yourselves
[31:38] in the love of god looking for the mercy
[31:41] of our lord jesus christ unto eternal
[31:44] life now listen
[31:46] enough some have compassion
[31:50] making a difference and others save with
[31:53] fear
[31:55] pulling them out of the fire hating
[31:58] even the garment spotted by the flesh
[32:02] now unto him but is able to keep you
[32:04] from falling into birth
[32:05] sent you faultless before the presence
[32:07] of his glory with exceeding joy
[32:10] to the only wise god our savior be glory
[32:13] and majesty dominion and power both now
[32:15] and forever amen
[32:17] now i want to read this verse here again
[32:18] verse 21
[32:22] uh keep yourselves in the love of god
[32:25] looking for the mercy of our lord jesus
[32:27] christ
[32:29] unto eternal life and some
[32:33] having compassion making a difference
[32:36] you may be seated may god add his
[32:37] blessings to the reading of his word i
[32:39] want to just title this
[32:41] having compassion making
[32:45] a difference now first of all
[32:48] the word difference here you think well
[32:51] making a difference
[32:53] it is to discern
[32:56] its discernment it's to make a
[33:00] distinction
[33:01] you know now i have a
[33:05] gift you all have gifts
[33:08] it's just not the preacher it's just not
[33:10] the five-fold ministry
[33:12] everybody has a part you know so we all
[33:15] have brother
[33:16] brother jesse i have and we have
[33:19] different fields that we work in
[33:22] but here we're talking about the love of
[33:24] god first
[33:26] we talk about the love now we're not
[33:27] talking about filio between a man and a
[33:29] woman like brother banner said one time
[33:32] you know if if a man insulted your wife
[33:36] you'd like to kill me you know that's
[33:39] filial love
[33:40] i guess i'd be the same way now i have
[33:42] to admit
[33:43] if one was doing wife to my harm i'm not
[33:45] so sure what i would do
[33:47] you know i remember i i can remember
[33:50] when i
[33:51] when i got out of the service when i was
[33:53] in the service i
[33:54] thought i was the toughest guy in the
[33:56] world when i was in the server
[33:57] out of basic training and i was
[33:59] stationed in korea
[34:01] i mean i thought i was a tough guy i
[34:04] thought i could just
[34:05] beat any and there was this one big
[34:06] black off-duty mp
[34:09] and next thing i know i was on the
[34:11] ground i was seeing star
[34:13] he had knocked me up uppercut me and
[34:16] flipped me
[34:17] backwards and you know my buddy
[34:20] said to me let's get out of here
[34:23] we weren't stupid you know they're
[34:26] bigger than we are
[34:27] but you know what the devil may look
[34:30] big sometimes but if we have the
[34:33] strength of the armor of god
[34:35] we will not back down
[34:38] the love of god is agapeo
[34:42] it's affection but like i like this word
[34:45] it's benevolence
[34:47] you know what benevolence is it's the
[34:49] disposition
[34:50] to do good and act of kindness
[34:54] of a generous gift like peter said
[34:57] freely i give
[34:58] i've received freely i give
[35:01] making the difference some having making
[35:05] a difference
[35:06] you know that's what i i want to do is
[35:08] make a difference
[35:09] wherever i go i want to make a
[35:11] difference i i can't win everybody it's
[35:13] not my calling
[35:14] and you know we all have a field we all
[35:16] should be in the field
[35:17] working but here's compassion
[35:22] it's here to have
[35:25] and show mercy or pity
[35:29] know brother man said i know a friend
[35:30] that will stick closer than no matter
[35:33] no matter if i haven't got a penny
[35:34] whatever i got a friend that just stick
[35:36] closer than a brother
[35:38] he gave his life for me he died
[35:42] amen he went into the grave and said i
[35:44] am he
[35:46] that was dead i'm alive forevermore and
[35:48] have the keys of death and hell don't
[35:51] you like that
[35:52] you know why i had the keys he went into
[35:54] the middle of earth and stripped the
[35:55] devil of the king
[35:57] amen scripture you know i like to put it
[36:00] this way
[36:01] what power that the devil has is what
[36:03] you give him
[36:04] you know he's just like an old guy that
[36:06] got false teeth he gum you to death
[36:08] because he ain't got no
[36:09] teeth he lost his stinger at calvary
[36:13] he ain't got no power the power he has
[36:16] was what we let him have
[36:18] amen amen
[36:24] see
[36:26] godly love is to make a difference
[36:31] to judge and make a distinction
[36:35] and you know we've got one of the not
[36:37] god we seem like we've got one of the
[36:39] awfulest funny times that we ever went
[36:41] through
[36:42] now you i got my opinions on the
[36:45] situation
[36:47] you know i have my opinions and my
[36:50] opinions
[36:51] may not mean a lot but you're going to
[36:52] hear some opinions in the morning
[36:55] i'll save them for in the morning you'll
[36:56] go right along with what i'm going to
[36:58] preach
[36:59] okay now now
[37:02] compassion torah media let me turn let's
[37:06] just read this in hebrews
[37:08] hebrews the fifth chapter it's talking
[37:10] about our lord
[37:12] uh and uh verse one we'll start with
[37:15] verse one
[37:17] now uh
[37:20] for every high priest taken from among
[37:22] men is ordained
[37:24] for men and things pertaining to god
[37:26] that he may offer both gifts and
[37:28] sacrifices for sins
[37:31] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[37:35] and on them that are out of the way for
[37:37] that he himself
[37:38] also accompassed with infirmity
[37:42] and by reason hereof he all asked for
[37:44] the people so also for himself to offer
[37:46] for sins and no man
[37:48] taketh this honor upon himself but he
[37:51] that is called of god
[37:52] as was aaron so also christ
[37:56] glorified not himself to be made a high
[37:58] priest but
[37:59] he said unto him thou art my son today i
[38:02] have begotten him
[38:03] and he said to now thou art a priest
[38:05] forever after the order
[38:07] of melchizedek who in the days of his
[38:09] flesh when he had offered up prayers and
[38:11] suffocation with strong crying and tears
[38:13] in him that was able to save him from
[38:15] death
[38:16] was heard in that he feared though he
[38:18] were a son
[38:19] yet he learned he obedient by the things
[38:22] he suffered
[38:24] and being made perfect he became the
[38:27] author of eternal salvation unto them
[38:30] that obey him
[38:31] call of god as a high priest after the
[38:33] order of mecca dick now listen the word
[38:35] compassion changes just a little bit
[38:37] here
[38:40] that he has compassion
[38:44] and i hope i could have the same
[38:46] compassion
[38:49] the bible said the lord is merciful
[38:53] gracious slow to angle anger
[38:56] plenteous in mercy
[38:59] compassion here is to be affected
[39:01] moderately
[39:03] or in due measure to preserve moderation
[39:06] in the past especially in anger or grief
[39:10] one who is not unduly disturbed by the
[39:13] heirs and faults and sin of others but
[39:15] bears
[39:16] them gently ignorant not knowing or
[39:21] understanding or out of the wrangle or
[39:23] out of the way you know
[39:24] i said there's a couple quotes that just
[39:26] struck me brother man
[39:28] said it it changes kind of my attitude
[39:33] you know you can backslide and have the
[39:35] holy ghost
[39:38] brother brad said in the friends token
[39:41] ever was healed
[39:42] if you live long enough you're going to
[39:44] get sick again if you
[39:45] one time take that token you had it
[39:48] forever
[39:48] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[39:50] whereby you're
[39:52] sealed unto the day of your redemption
[39:54] not till the next revival you wasn't
[39:56] sealed
[39:57] you got emotionally worked up but you
[39:58] are dead and your life is hitting god
[40:01] through christ
[40:02] and you're sealed by the holy ghost if
[40:04] you are once
[40:05] baptized into the holy spirit now you
[40:08] can backslide
[40:10] that it's true but you can't get away
[40:12] from that ceiling
[40:13] you were sealed into it now listen
[40:18] you know this changed my mind you know
[40:21] uh oh my
[40:24] i got a bunch of stuff wrote down
[40:29] we're not we're just a few people here
[40:31] ah here
[40:38] you know that's okay i'm gonna i'm gonna
[40:40] i have it i might have left it
[40:43] back back at the uh
[40:46] uh motel hotel but you know brother
[40:48] branham said you could be completely
[40:50] insane
[40:52] completely insane and still have the
[40:54] holy ghost
[40:56] that has not got anything to do with
[40:59] your soul i got the quote i don't know
[41:01] what ever happened to it it's
[41:03] disappeared oh yeah
[41:05] many times you can see a person maybe of
[41:07] insanity
[41:08] they may not yet be that they may not
[41:11] get converted filled with the holy ghost
[41:13] yet totally insane that's right
[41:16] but has no one that has nothing to do
[41:19] with the soul it's a torment something
[41:22] that torments i'm going to read again
[41:25] now they may yet they may yet
[41:28] converted they may yet converted filled
[41:31] with the holy ghost they'd be converted
[41:33] and filled with the holy ghost but
[41:34] totally insane
[41:36] i used to think a man's totally insane
[41:38] how could he have the holy ghost
[41:39] but it happens it happens
[41:44] especially in this hour i remember
[41:47] reading one
[41:48] time there was a man called dr mercola
[41:51] in fact uh my wife was having uh
[41:54] thyroid problems going to the doctor
[41:58] and this guy's a renegade you know he he
[42:01] he told about
[42:03] uh the armor you know used to treat
[42:07] thyroid by armor you know what that is
[42:09] pigsty relay
[42:11] you know and uh remember the armor man
[42:14] brother ram talked about you know i must
[42:18] that says something for it don't it and
[42:19] i remember and i told my wife about it
[42:22] and she got that and she got all
[42:23] straightened out you know instead of
[42:25] taking the synthetic you know and all
[42:26] that
[42:27] but you know but he said one time there
[42:29] was like i forget
[42:30] like 90 of the american people have some
[42:33] form of mental illness
[42:35] depression whatever it is but we're in
[42:38] that hour
[42:39] we're in that hour evil men and seduce
[42:43] yourself
[42:44] works wax worse worse you know
[42:50] now now my notes are all
[42:54] out of whack but that's okay well i got
[42:57] some things to say yet
[42:59] you know i think
[43:04] can you think i may have told this story
[43:07] before
[43:08] but i'm gonna tell some stories here
[43:11] because
[43:12] having compassion and some
[43:17] making a difference yes
[43:20] and you know what other men said you
[43:21] could you can be you could be led in the
[43:23] spirit and you don't even know it
[43:25] you don't know it you just go ahead
[43:29] i mean you can be feeling down as can be
[43:31] and you haven't heard from god
[43:32] being led to the spirit
[43:36] but god knows and god will take you to
[43:39] the right place
[43:43] that's right you know
[43:48] i think so many people that i have met
[43:53] in fact there was a sister
[43:57] sent my wife uh
[44:02] a video of a scientist
[44:06] talking about implants you know those
[44:10] things you know
[44:12] and she said could that be that brain
[44:15] scientist that you flew with that time
[44:18] i flew with the brain scientist talked
[44:20] to him for about six hours
[44:22] told him everything that a hillbilly in
[44:23] kentucky told me
[44:25] you know he said i'm a baptist
[44:28] i'm not an atheist and i looked at that
[44:31] picture of that guy
[44:33] that guy was a stocky guy but he got
[44:35] converted
[44:37] it looked just it looked like him his
[44:40] voice
[44:40] sounded like it of a mind i believe it
[44:43] was him
[44:45] through a witness on a delta flight
[44:50] the hit stop was japan mine was the
[44:53] philippines
[44:54] you know you don't know what god is
[44:56] doing
[44:57] you don't know how god is leading
[45:01] and you see people so down and out and
[45:04] you feel like there's no
[45:05] hope there's no help you better be
[45:08] careful
[45:09] there's always a hope and there's always
[45:12] a way
[45:15] we throw people out the door we push
[45:18] them off the bus
[45:19] so to speak like there's no hope they're
[45:22] so steeped in sin
[45:23] they did this and did that what about
[45:25] the woman at the well had all them
[45:27] husbands

[47:04] i was getting ready to leave and i
[47:07] visited his church and meeting in a
[47:10] motel
[47:11] 2005 i believe it was
[47:15] and i was telling about the problems i
[47:18] was facing when i got there
[47:20] because i had come against a certain
[47:23] group
[47:24] of men an organization that
[47:27] under the name of the message that
[47:28] picked up every kind of fly by night

[47:36] in and i was telling him about it and
[47:39] and uh and i i couldn't believe it after
[47:42] this so i had never met him but there
[47:43] brother
[47:44] clem gave me a hundred dollar mission
[47:46] offering and i didn't even know the man
[47:49] we become very we're very close that's i
[47:51] could say that's my best friend there's
[47:53] no doubt about it
[47:54] but uh we've traveled many miles and the
[47:57] brother needs
[47:58] prayer for his body you know he's
[48:00] homesick for the philippines because
[48:02] he's got a filipino wife there
[48:04] and she's stuck by colby 19. we're going
[48:07] to talk about that and she can't get
[48:09] here

[48:17] only converse
[48:19] you know he's loved sick
[48:23] you would be too yeah yeah she would be
[48:26] too
[48:26] but see and i remember
[48:30] i told this many times i've told it many
[48:32] times but not many times but
[48:35] i i that's what this was not what i was
[48:37] going to say but just come out
[48:39] yeah i don't know and leading this way
[48:41] and
[48:43] and when i got believe it or not
[48:48] on the airplane on that trip over there
[48:52] i was so troubled in here i sat down
[48:56] by two men
[48:59] i got me an exit door seated and i said
[49:02] i called my wife oh i'm so glad there
[49:04] was first come first serve now you gotta
[49:06] pay for it
[49:07] and i got me an exit door seat and and i
[49:09] sat down and here come these two big
[49:11] guys sat down next to me
[49:13] and i was overheating i'm trying to
[49:16] catch what i'm hearing
[49:18] you know all the noise of the plane and
[49:21] i heard somebody say you can buy all
[49:23] your duty-free alcohol
[49:25] you know on here and then i heard them
[49:28] talking about
[49:29] the message you know
[49:33] and so i made a mistake i pulled out my
[49:36] book
[49:37] and that was it man we were in a turmoil
[49:40] the rest of the trip
[49:42] i won't go into detail i will not go
[49:45] into detail
[49:46] what i heard but i heard things like no
[49:49] man ought to hear
[49:52] and when i got there my brothers were
[49:55] waiting for me
[50:02] to confront me about what i've been
[50:04] preaching against this group
[50:10] and so and when i got to baguio city
[50:17] one brother was with me i said i'm
[50:19] getting out of here
[50:21] my i'm getting my i was there of my
[50:23] closest companion
[50:26] and i separated from him separated from
[50:30] him
[50:30] making his distinction now
[50:33] i made a distinction i had to
[50:37] and i separated for two or three trips
[50:41] and one time on my way to bag on my way
[50:45] we were headed up to mountains to visit
[50:49] a brother
[50:50] to dedicate his house and his ministry
[50:55] and my closest companion i won't even
[50:57] mention his name
[51:00] called the driver and symbol gone
[51:04] said well brother keith come and have
[51:06] coffee
[51:07] at the church and i told him no
[51:12] i said will he meet me at a restaurant
[51:14] and have coffee i told him no because i
[51:16] had a dream in that house
[51:18] that that brother came to that house
[51:22] with a certain colored shirt on and
[51:25] finally he said
[51:26] i'm coming to the house he's at when we
[51:29] got back to the house
[51:31] i don't know when it was he came to the
[51:33] house i told the brothers you watch and
[51:35] see
[51:35] when he comes in what color shirt he'll
[51:37] have on
[51:39] and when he got in there he began to
[51:40] weep like a baby
[51:42] he said what have i done what have i
[51:44] done
[51:45] what have i done now you know sometimes
[51:48] you have to make a distinction
[51:50] that's the kind of compassion true
[51:52] compassion
[51:53] is to do the will of god brother baby
[51:56] said elijah
[51:57] when he was on mount carmel with those
[51:59] uh
[52:01] witch doctors what do you want to call
[52:03] them
[52:04] he was doing the will of god when he
[52:06] made fun of him he was that was the will
[52:09] that was compassion i
[52:12] was showing compassion now work closer
[52:15] since 2007 probably than we ever been
[52:18] because we
[52:19] started traveling together in 1993 you
[52:22] know so
[52:23] you know that's to separate make a
[52:25] distinction
[52:28] see that's why the bible said and
[52:33] be not conformed to this world
[52:36] but be you transformed by the renewing
[52:39] of your mind
[52:47] that you may prove what is that good
[52:52] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[52:56] did you ever know what the renewing
[52:58] means
[52:59] you know what it means you know what it
[53:00] is what it is
[53:03] it means it's so easy
[53:07] if i was going to renew this building
[53:09] his room
[53:11] i would take every single thing out of
[53:12] here i'd rip the carpet
[53:15] i'd rip the eye i would rip everything
[53:17] out it well there would be
[53:18] nothing left at all by the renewing of
[53:22] our mind because
[53:23] our mind is a garbage disposal in this
[53:26] hour
[53:28] politics and everything i got now
[53:31] i'm i believe in voting voted for donald
[53:35] trump and i'll vote for him again
[53:38] if you don't vote for him
[53:42] you're a christian you don't vote for
[53:44] him it's a sin
[53:45] he either knows if you're gonna do it
[53:46] but not to tell me it's a sin
[53:49] my brother-in-law told me one time about
[53:51] he said one time about
[53:53] this preacher that was a tv
[53:57] he's got in houston texas got this big

[57:44] so you know so that's the way it is you
[57:47] know
[57:49] you know we need to prove all things
[57:54] know you don't know like brother branham
[57:55] the little little
[57:57] he called the little ancient woman you
[57:58] know and the plane stopped
[58:00] can you imagine he got off that plane
[58:03] and just started walking he didn't know
[58:05] why he was doing
[58:06] you know he didn't know why he kept
[58:08] walking
[58:09] and that plane there he didn't know why
[58:14] but he kept walking and there she was
[58:18] parson she had been praying how do you
[58:21] know i'm a person because i was praying
[58:24] i got a sick boy in her you know what he
[58:26] had he had a social disease
[58:29] i love this what what humility
[58:34] they begin to pray you know who brother
[58:37] branham asked to pray first
[58:40] their little aunt jemima and when she
[58:42] prayed brother ben
[58:43] talked about man what a prayer
[58:47] but you know it was some time after that
[58:50] he was somewhere
[58:51] and all of a sudden somebody said i
[58:53] don't know what they called him parson
[58:54] person person
[58:56] he looked around that was that boy god
[58:58] had healed him
[58:59] god had saved him god had set him free
[59:01] amen
[59:02] that's the way it is when i was on the
[59:04] plane one time
[59:05] i sat down next to these two boys
[59:08] filipino boys dressed to the hills
[59:10] man they had all kind i mean they they
[59:12] they're called their clothes had to be
[59:14] expensive for the filipinos you know
[59:16] and so they asked i asked him where are
[59:19] you going boys we're going to japan we
[59:21] got a nightclub
[59:23] and i said to myself lord why did you
[59:26] sit me now next to these guys
[59:30] or god will correct you real fast ask
[59:34] me where you been and i began to tell
[59:37] them
[59:38] and i began to witness to them and tell
[59:40] them before i knew it
[59:41] one of those boys was hugging on me and
[59:43] hugging on me wouldn't let go
[59:45] they wanted to hear more and more and
[59:46] more and more sometimes god gets you to
[59:49] play
[59:49] god's leading you and you don't even
[59:51] know you're being led but he's being
[59:53] leading you
[59:57] when i sit next to that brain scientist
[59:59] and we talked about
[1:00:01] i forget you know he told me he said he
[1:00:04] he said it was four ordained he believed
[1:00:07] must have believed in predestination we
[1:00:08] were for ordained to fly together
[1:00:11] yeah you know right i'll probably see
[1:00:13] him again one of these days in another
[1:00:15] another another world a better world
[1:00:18] a much better world and can you imagine
[1:00:22] i probably told these more because
[1:00:23] that's what i'm trying to say
[1:00:25] with making a making a distinction
[1:00:27] making a difference
[1:00:28] what i can do what i can do i can't be
[1:00:32] everywhere i can't do everything that's
[1:00:35] why
[1:00:35] the laborers are few the harvest is
[1:00:39] right
[1:00:40] why are not we in the harvest field
[1:00:44] yes sir
[1:00:47] and subongan been there many times
[1:00:55] sister bernadette now if you knew
[1:01:00] the church there and the facilities of
[1:01:04] the church
[1:01:05] it ain't very good so sister bernadette
[1:01:10] takes me in and brother clinton i've
[1:01:13] known her for years being before brother
[1:01:14] clinton
[1:01:16] and takes us into his her house
[1:01:20] and was sitting outside
[1:01:24] before going to service
[1:01:28] and she was talking to me and here comes
[1:01:31] her son
[1:01:33] talking to me and her mother left
[1:01:36] because she knew her son wants to say
[1:01:38] something said i believe i have a call
[1:01:40] in my life
[1:01:42] and i'm helping out in the church now i
[1:01:44] didn't condemn him see
[1:01:46] he said but my wife's not a believer i
[1:01:48] didn't say anything
[1:01:51] and she's roman catholic she was right
[1:01:53] there
[1:01:55] i said i talked to him for long i told
[1:01:57] him i told him about my experience
[1:01:59] my wife was a believer 12 years before i
[1:02:01] was
[1:02:02] i told him all about that trying to
[1:02:04] build it build his
[1:02:06] faith so that night my message
[1:02:10] was about rome in the catholic church a
[1:02:12] lot of it was
[1:02:13] and you know the old devil says this you
[1:02:15] better water
[1:02:16] it down i never watered it down
[1:02:20] a bit and when i give the altar
[1:02:23] call they were lined up and i was
[1:02:26] praying for these and i couldn't wait
[1:02:28] because his wife he was at the altar
[1:02:31] and his wife i took her by the hand
[1:02:34] would you like to receive jesus christ
[1:02:36] as your lord and savior and she said yes
[1:02:42] you know sister bernadette took us into
[1:02:44] our home
[1:02:47] the last trip her husband was always
[1:02:50] offish even when we were in the home
[1:02:55] and we were having an outdoor
[1:02:58] meeting and there he was
[1:03:02] a big smile on his face just as friendly
[1:03:06] as
[1:03:06] could be sister
[1:03:10] god honored sister bernadette i believe
[1:03:12] because she took
[1:03:13] us in and not only
[1:03:17] her daughter-in-law got added and her
[1:03:19] pop her
[1:03:20] husband got added to the phone
[1:03:24] you don't even know you don't know
[1:03:26] [Applause]
[1:03:27] you don't know what a difference you can
[1:03:29] make
[1:03:30] through discernment
[1:03:37] just like the the good samaritan
[1:03:42] you're the man you're the man where did
[1:03:44] he leave he left jericho
[1:03:46] you know what jericho the greek means
[1:03:49] alluring
[1:03:50] fragrance jericho
[1:03:54] he was left he left he left jerusalem
[1:03:58] i mean headed to jericho jerusalem was
[1:04:01] his place of safety
[1:04:03] and he was headed to jericho which was
[1:04:05] an alluring fragrance
[1:04:07] he was backslid you know
[1:04:11] and the robbers came and got him and
[1:04:13] just worked him over it's probably took
[1:04:15] everything he had
[1:04:17] here come you know the levites and
[1:04:21] the priests just passed on by they
[1:04:24] didn't want to get their hands dirty
[1:04:26] i don't want that i have preached in the
[1:04:29] leper colony
[1:04:30] i have hugged a pastor which has live
[1:04:33] leprosy
[1:04:34] whereas if knuckles would burst
[1:04:37] i've been there i've seen it
[1:04:40] if god is leading you there is nothing
[1:04:43] to fear
[1:04:44] amen but the good samaritan
[1:04:48] you know what he was half jew half
[1:04:49] gentile he was looked down upon
[1:04:52] but he showed mercy he gave him two pens
[1:04:56] you know what was it just wait now i'll
[1:04:58] come and make
[1:04:59] recompense for the rest jesus has been
[1:05:01] gone 2 000 years
[1:05:02] but he's coming back again one day and
[1:05:05] he's going to reward everything that
[1:05:07] everything every little every little but
[1:05:09] he's gonna also judge every idol word
[1:05:12] and everything that you did that you
[1:05:14] shouldn't do
[1:05:18] but when love
[1:05:22] god's mercies are new every morning i
[1:05:24] saw that
[1:05:26] picture in the men's restroom and i
[1:05:28] thought that's a good confirmation
[1:05:31] you know trying to decide what to preach
[1:05:34] tonight
[1:05:34] you know his mercies are new every
[1:05:38] morning
[1:05:39] every time i wake up in the morning you
[1:05:40] know
[1:05:43] i died
[1:05:46] and you know where i was at uh september
[1:05:50] 8th
[1:05:52] i was in the hospital having nuclear
[1:05:55] stress tests
[1:05:56] and so you know because i was having
[1:05:59] trouble breathing
[1:06:02] in different things dizzy
[1:06:05] and uh i went to the doctor he gave me a
[1:06:09] a physical and took a chest x-ray and he
[1:06:12] found a seven millimeter
[1:06:14] nodule on my right lung but he said
[1:06:16] don't worry about that
[1:06:18] it's no problem i'll take his word for
[1:06:20] it
[1:06:22] but he said i'm gonna give give you i
[1:06:23] got i can't run
[1:06:25] anymore i've got bad feet and knees
[1:06:28] so they give you a nuclear one where
[1:06:31] they inject this stuff in you
[1:06:34] and your heart races like you were on
[1:06:36] the treadmill
[1:06:38] and so i did that and
[1:06:43] you know then they took pictures before
[1:06:46] and after that took a bunch of pictures
[1:06:49] and they came out with the pictures
[1:06:51] and they would i think they were being
[1:06:52] nice he said to me he said now
[1:06:55] we know men have a different thing on
[1:06:57] one of their heart places and
[1:06:59] it showed black like it was uh you know
[1:07:02] it said uh we're going to take some more
[1:07:05] pictures and
[1:07:07] on your stomach you have to go in and
[1:07:08] think oh man i
[1:07:10] draw me crazy the third time one after
[1:07:12] another
[1:07:13] and you know the thing when it came back
[1:07:17] there was nothing my wife said
[1:07:21] god just took it away my breathing
[1:07:25] is back all right because the prayers of
[1:07:28] the saints and the prayers of my wife
[1:07:30] amen i mean i ain't finished
[1:07:34] i'm not finished
[1:07:37] when god takes my card out of the file
[1:07:39] when i'm gone ain't no way no prayer
[1:07:43] gonna stop it or anything i'll be gone
[1:07:45] and
[1:07:45] and i i ain't gonna be so sad about it i
[1:07:49] you know i don't mind going you know
[1:07:53] you know i try to make sure my wife be
[1:07:55] taken care of and everything but
[1:07:57] when love is projected with the right
[1:08:00] motive behind it
[1:08:04] divine grace has to step in
[1:08:07] divine love is projected in its object
[1:08:12] sovereign grace steps in and produces
[1:08:15] what
[1:08:15] it projected
[1:08:19] if we can just jesus
[1:08:25] said the son can do nothing himself
[1:08:30] but what he sees the father doing
[1:08:34] and see that's compassion when he walked
[1:08:36] through the pool of bethesda
[1:08:39] and you men they were sick i don't know
[1:08:42] how that mean they were probably really
[1:08:43] sick people but he walked past all those
[1:08:46] sick people
[1:08:47] to get one man why god was leading him
[1:08:50] to the jesus to that one man
[1:08:52] and brother branham said he might have
[1:08:53] had just prostate trouble you know
[1:08:55] and had it for years but
[1:09:00] he got in that because
[1:09:04] when those waters were troubled if you
[1:09:06] got in that pool you'd be healed but he
[1:09:08] went for that one man
[1:09:10] one man
[1:09:14] that's divine love is projected
[1:09:19] i think that's what we need to think
[1:09:20] about you know
[1:09:23] not what he sees not hears
[1:09:28] but what he sees the father doing
[1:09:31] do it that do it the son likewise
[1:09:34] and if you're a son and daughter of god
[1:09:37] you need to listen
[1:09:38] to your father papa god amen amen
[1:09:41] papa god yes amen you know i like that
[1:09:45] papa god
[1:09:46] he my daddy you know god is my father
[1:09:50] amen i'm begotten of the holy ghost
[1:09:52] being born again out of a corruptable
[1:09:54] seed but an incorruptible seed
[1:09:56] which is the word of god which liveth
[1:09:57] and endure forever
[1:09:59] amen amen you cannot
[1:10:02] confuse human sympathy with godly
[1:10:04] compassion or
[1:10:05] you know i i see people i feel sorry for
[1:10:08] them
[1:10:10] and you know if i could help i might
[1:10:12] help them but see
[1:10:15] god might use me for one thing
[1:10:18] you for another
[1:10:23] people don't know what compassion is
[1:10:26] it's the love is the will of god you
[1:10:29] cannot exercise that unless god gives it
[1:10:31] now
[1:10:32] turn on me i'm going to close but i want
[1:10:33] to read this i just added that to this
[1:10:36] message probably back in the
[1:10:38] in the hotel
[1:10:41] but i want you i want to read this in
[1:10:44] luke the fifth chapter this is what i
[1:10:48] feel
[1:10:49] you know i've got a message
[1:10:52] is our labor in vain and i haven't
[1:10:54] preached it yet
[1:10:56] but it seems like all we do is bicker
[1:10:58] and fight
[1:11:01] disagreements you know that's true
[1:11:05] sometimes i wonder if is our labor in
[1:11:07] vain
[1:11:09] one brother cannot cast his net out with
[1:11:11] the other brother because i
[1:11:13] i just don't see it
[1:11:16] and it came to pass that as the people
[1:11:18] pat pressed upon him to hear the word of
[1:11:20] god he stood by the
[1:11:22] the lake of genocide and he saw two
[1:11:25] ships standing by the lake
[1:11:26] but the fishermen were gone out of them
[1:11:28] and were washing their nets
[1:11:31] and he entered into one of the ships
[1:11:33] which was simon's and prayed him
[1:11:35] that he would thrust out a little from
[1:11:36] the land and he sat down and taught the
[1:11:38] people other
[1:11:41] now when he had left speaking he said
[1:11:43] unto simon launch out into the deep and
[1:11:45] let down your net
[1:11:46] for a drought and simon answered and
[1:11:49] said unto master
[1:11:50] we have toiled all night and have taken
[1:11:53] nothing nevertheless that thy word
[1:11:55] i will let down the net but when they
[1:11:59] had this done they enclosed a great
[1:12:03] multitude of fishes
[1:12:05] in their net break and they beckoned
[1:12:09] unto their partners partners which were
[1:12:12] in the other ship
[1:12:13] that they should come and help them and
[1:12:16] they came
[1:12:17] and filled both the sheds so they
[1:12:20] they that they began to sink still there
[1:12:23] man it was so great
[1:12:26] because they began to cast their nets
[1:12:28] together in obedience to what the lord
[1:12:30] jesus said
[1:12:32] when simon peter saw it he fell down at
[1:12:34] jesus this thing depart from me for i am
[1:12:37] a sinful man o lord
[1:12:39] for he was astonished and all that were
[1:12:42] with him
[1:12:43] as the drought of the fishes what they
[1:12:45] had taken
[1:12:47] so was also james and john the sum of
[1:12:50] zebedee which were partners with simon
[1:12:53] jesus said in simon fear not from
[1:12:55] henceforth thou shalt catch
[1:12:57] men listen that
[1:13:01] fear not from henceforth thou shalt
[1:13:04] catch
[1:13:04] amen amen and when
[1:13:08] they had brought their ships to land
[1:13:11] they forsook all
[1:13:12] and followed him i believe we could just
[1:13:15] cast their
[1:13:16] nets out together draw
[1:13:19] draw draw in the fishes sure we'll
[1:13:22] get some turtles and snakes and all
[1:13:25] kinds of things and ugly little things
[1:13:28] to draw them in there's all kinds of
[1:13:29] things in the sea
[1:13:30] all kinds of weird creatures but there's
[1:13:32] also fish
[1:13:34] amen there's also fish
[1:13:37] when they brought the fishes you know
[1:13:40] the little boy brought his fishes and
[1:13:42] loaves and
[1:13:43] jesus began to bless it and the they
[1:13:46] they were just fishings and loaves until
[1:13:48] they took their hand over and gave it to
[1:13:50] jesus and it began to get multiplied
[1:13:52] because a little boy took his hands off
[1:13:54] it couldn't be multiplied until
[1:13:56] his hands went off but what it was when
[1:13:58] his hands is off it begin to get
[1:14:00] multiple
[1:14:00] if we could just take our hands and let
[1:14:03] god's hands
[1:14:04] take over
[1:14:11] but our lord or to god full of
[1:14:14] compassion gracious
[1:14:16] long suffering plenteous and mercy and
[1:14:19] truth
[1:14:21] compassion might be healing
[1:14:25] it might be of rebuke precious
[1:14:29] or the wounds of a friend but the kisses
[1:14:31] of an enemy
[1:14:32] are deceitful
[1:14:35] you ever been rebuked we don't always
[1:14:38] like it
[1:14:41] but it you know that's a sweet kind of
[1:14:44] rebuke
[1:14:45] you know uh
[1:14:49] not like an enemy's
[1:14:52] the kiss of an enemy which is deceitful
[1:14:57] see love doesn't fear
[1:15:04] it's waiting on grace perfect love
[1:15:09] has no fear perfect love casteth out
[1:15:12] fear
[1:15:14] he that fear has not been made perfect
[1:15:17] with love amen amen we could say a whole
[1:15:22] lot more tonight
[1:15:24] but we'll save it for tomorrow
[1:15:29] morning by the help of god
[1:15:34] amen isn't it good
[1:15:39] and it good that god has given us the
[1:15:42] bible
[1:15:43] i believe god will give us the perfect
[1:15:45] interpretation of the word with divine
[1:15:47] vindication
[1:15:48] you know
[1:15:53] man i fought against this for years
[1:15:57] i mean i got whooped
[1:16:01] i had the flesh not literally whipped
[1:16:04] off of me but it felt like it
[1:16:07] i had so much trouble and trials
[1:16:11] because it was all in the leading of god
[1:16:14] and i
[1:16:14] didn't know it if i'd have just
[1:16:18] surrendered
[1:16:19] man i could have caused myself but
[1:16:22] save myself a lot of trouble because the
[1:16:25] peace of god
[1:16:27] that passive understanding will keep
[1:16:30] your hearts and minds
[1:16:32] is it to keep your hearts and your minds
[1:16:34] in christ
[1:16:35] jesus see people
[1:16:38] go insane backslide
[1:16:42] because they do not keep their hearts
[1:16:44] and minds
[1:16:45] in tune with god's perfect will
[1:16:48] with god's perfect word his authority
[1:16:52] it does not fail god cannot fail
[1:16:57] god doesn't make any mistakes he's the
[1:17:00] same yesterday
[1:17:01] today and forever his word
[1:17:04] is settled in heaven cannot train
[1:17:10] lord he doesn't move
[1:17:14] you know it didn't move for this side or
[1:17:17] that side
[1:17:18] you know i'm trying to think of the
[1:17:19] scripture i can't think of it
[1:17:21] i'll think of it back in my room
[1:17:25] you know when you get old you know i
[1:17:30] found out it ain't only old people that
